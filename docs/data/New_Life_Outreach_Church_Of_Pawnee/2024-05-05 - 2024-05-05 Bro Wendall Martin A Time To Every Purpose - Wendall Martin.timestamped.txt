[39:25] um uh this is this is a real I love
[39:29] dedicating babies back to the Lord you
[39:32] say um now I I remember when I was a kid
[39:36] and I was I I was I was 19 when I came
[39:40] to
[39:41] paon and I I was uh I I was baptizing
[39:47] I'm telling you what we I was we we had
[39:50] us a sister Carol you remember we we had
[39:53] a
[39:55] um we we had had
[39:58] a little um Bible studies there at the
[40:02] AA Center here in town and um and so we
[40:09] we started out um uh talking you know
[40:13] preaching to the drunks and drug addicts
[40:16] and and uh well we outgrew the place and
[40:20] so we needed a church so there was an
[40:22] old abandoned church building uh just
[40:25] right over here on Parks uh Street and
[40:28] and it was an Old Church of Christ
[40:30] building and uh I mean the walls were
[40:33] separating and and uh uh it it was in
[40:37] pretty rough shape and sister Carol she
[40:39] would come down there every day trying
[40:41] to clean that place up we were still
[40:43] having Church you know we started and so
[40:45] she'd be down there scrubbing floors and
[40:48] just just doing everything trying to
[40:51] make the place presentable but we had a
[40:53] we in that in that uh um uh in the
[40:58] platform there you could raise up the
[41:00] platform and there was a baptistry down
[41:04] low and um uh you you get and it was oh
[41:08] it was it was it was a piece of work and
[41:11] uh but we would fill that thing up and
[41:14] and uh we would I I'd baptize I mean we
[41:17] were baptizing people in the name of the
[41:20] Lord just uh you know um we were getting
[41:24] them off the streets and put and
[41:25] baptizing them in the water so one
[41:28] service I I was baptizing and uh uh
[41:33] bringing them in oh my it was just
[41:36] wonderful service and then sister Carol
[41:39] you'll remember
[41:40] this somebody somebody just
[41:44] immediately put this baby in my hands
[41:47] and said baptize it now I had all of
[41:51] these people looking at me they're all
[41:53] happy and I've got this little baby here
[41:55] in my hands
[41:57] and um
[41:59] and I'm 19 years old I don't have no one
[42:02] to talk to I don't have an elder to ask
[42:06] I don't know what to do and I said well
[42:08] listen well if I'm going to baptize this
[42:11] baby I'm dunking it all the way down and
[42:15] and they all looked at each other and
[42:16] said well whatever you've got to do and
[42:20] um I don't look at me like that it was
[42:22] wrong amen but I was 19 years old and um
[42:27] I I said all right I took this baby put
[42:31] my finger over its nose and just brought
[42:34] that under the water back out and it it
[42:36] came out of screaming and
[42:39] and well we don't do you that wasn't
[42:43] scriptural you're not supposed to
[42:44] baptize
[42:48] babies it's funny you look back in those
[42:50] those old back over your life and how
[42:53] you learn and that's right and I'm I'm
[42:56] thankful that God has Grace for for our
[43:01] mistakes but I will tell
[43:03] you I will tell you dedicating babies to
[43:07] the Lord is
[43:09] scriptural giving these babies to the
[43:12] Lord are very is very important part of
[43:16] our life and so as we I'm I'm just going
[43:20] to read and and we'll let the musicians
[43:22] continue to play there but I I want to
[43:24] read a a place out of the the the the
[43:27] Old Testament and then one in the New
[43:29] Testament but here in in 1 Samuel 1 and
[43:34] [Music]
[43:35] 24 and
[43:39] uh and when she had this is this is
[43:42] Hannah bringing Samuel uh to the
[43:46] Tabernacle the temple and when she had
[43:48] weaned him and took him up with her with
[43:51] three Bullocks and one eal of flour and
[43:54] a bottle of wine and brought him into
[43:56] the house of the Lord in Shiloh and the
[43:59] child was young and they slew a bullet
[44:02] and brought the child to
[44:04] Eli and she said oh my Lord as thy soul
[44:08] liveth my Lord I am the woman that stood
[44:12] by thee here praying unto the Lord for
[44:15] this child I prayed and the Lord ha
[44:18] given me my petition which I asked of
[44:21] him therefore also I have lent him to
[44:24] the Lord as long as he liveth he shall
[44:27] be lent to the Lord and He worshiped the
[44:30] Lord
[44:32] there I'd also like to look here in the
[44:34] Book of
[44:36] Luke and
[44:39] um Luke the 18th chapter in the 13th
[44:44] verse so this was the child that Hannah
[44:47] had prayed for and and now she's giving
[44:51] this child back to the
[44:55] Lord and it was so
[44:57] that
[45:00] um let's see I am in the wrong I'm in
[45:05] the wrong place
[45:08] here oh
[45:11] my praise the Lord where they brought
[45:14] the children to
[45:15] [Music]
[45:19] Jesus let's
[45:22] see
[45:23] Matthew L Luke I'm in the oh I'm sorry
[45:27] that's that's my problem I'm in the
[45:29] wrong
[45:31] place
[45:33] sorry
[45:37] amen I did notice I was in there
[45:41] okay praise the
[45:43] Lord yeah and they brought unto him Luke
[45:48] 1815 they brought unto him also
[45:51] infants that he would touch them and
[45:55] when his disciples saw it they re
[45:56] rebuked him but Jesus called them unto
[46:00] him and said suffer the little children
[46:03] to come unto me and forbid them not for
[46:08] of such is the kingdom of God verily I
[46:12] say unto you
[46:14] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[46:17] of God as a little child shall in no
[46:20] wise enter
[46:22] therein and so we can see how that Jesus
[46:26] blessed these Bab babies and you can
[46:28] bring you can bring your child up the
[46:30] Lancaster family if y'all want to want
[46:33] to come up
[46:34] but giving our children to the Lord and
[46:38] dedicating them to the Lord is is um is

[46:45] thing and I want to tell you this this
[46:48] young and is a very precious

[55:02] travail which God hath given to the sons
[55:05] of men to be exercised in it he hath
[55:08] made everything beautiful in his time
[55:13] also he hath set the world in their
[55:15] hearts so that no man can find out the
[55:18] work that God maketh from the beginning
[55:20] to the end for I thought here this
[55:23] morning I would like to take a Time
[55:26] for every purpose let's go to the Lord
[55:29] in prayer father we want to thank you
[55:32] for the many blessings that you have
[55:34] given
[55:35] us Lord I I can't express enough
[55:40] what it is meant these last couple days
[55:44] getting to Fellowship
[55:47] around your with your bride here in this
[55:53] uh this last weekend Lord
[55:56] Lord and it's just been a blessing to
[55:58] just rub shoulders and to Lord to be in
[56:01] one another's company and to work
[56:04] together in unity Lord for a common goal
[56:07] and cause and we're thankful that we
[56:10] have been able to witness Lord and to
[56:13] show your love to this
[56:15] community father we thank you for
[56:18] allowing us to do that now Lord we
[56:21] come and we want to give glory to you on
[56:25] this
[56:27] Resurrection Sunday Lord and what it
[56:29] means to us Lord
[56:31] is Lord it means so
[56:34] much now father I'm asking that you
[56:36] would take these few words that I would
[56:38] say
[56:39] today and that you would Lord make them
[56:42] real to our
[56:44] hearts father may I only say what you
[56:47] would have us to say and we'll give you
[56:50] glory and honor in the name of the Lord
[56:53] Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen
[56:56] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[56:59] seated here
[57:00] today amen there's a time for every
[57:05] purpose I also uh was thinking there in
[57:09] the book of Ephesians the the first
[57:13] chapter and and
[57:16] um there in would start there at the
[57:19] fourth verse according as he has chosen
[57:22] Us in him before the foundation of the
[57:25] world that we should be holy and Without
[57:28] Blame before him in love now that's his
[57:32] choosing that's what he's
[57:34] ordained having predestinated us that's
[57:38] amen that's before planned that's that's
[57:40] to said into motion unto the adoption of
[57:44] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[57:46] according to the good pleasure of his
[57:48] will to the praise of GL of the glory of
[57:52] his grace wherein he hath made us
[57:54] accepted in the Beloved in whom we have
[57:57] Redemption through his blood and the
[57:58] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[58:00] riches of his grace wherein he has
[58:03] abounded toward us sir in all wisdom and
[58:06] Prudence having made known unto us the
[58:09] mystery of his will according to his
[58:11] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[58:14] himself that in the
[58:16] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[58:20] might gather
[58:22] together in one all things in Christ
[58:26] both which are in heaven which are on
[58:28] earth even in him in whom we have
[58:31] obtained an inheritance being
[58:34] predestinated according to the purpose
[58:36] of him who worketh all things after the
[58:39] counsel of his own will yes sir can you
[58:43] say
[58:44] Amen now as we begin to think about this
[58:50] time God's got a time for every purpose
[58:53] everything that he has he has
[58:57] predestinated and I do believe in
[58:59] predestination I do believe God's got a
[59:02] plan I believe that plan was spoke
[59:05] through the spoken word and there are
[59:08] seasons there are times that God Amen
[59:12] has already got
[59:14] appointed for that purpose amen and I
[59:18] think finding our place in the scripture
[59:22] is a must because if we don't find Our
[59:25] Place in scripture then then we we have
[59:30] no place to really rest our faith we we
[59:34] rest upon we we we now many are resting
[59:37] upon opinions many are resting on well I
[59:40] see it this way but it's not really a
[59:43] grounded scriptural amen
[59:46] foundation and the prophet has has has
[59:49] told us that that that uh uh angel that
[59:53] came from the bottomless pit he he
[59:56] explained that it was amen belief
[59:59] systems without a Biblical Foundation it
[1:00:03] was someone something that they were
[1:00:05] standing to and holding to but really
[1:00:08] had no biblical Foundation to it at all
[1:00:12] and so amen so the prophet would say the
[1:00:15] bride must make sure that whatever we
[1:00:20] are basing our belief upon it's got to
[1:00:24] be scriptural
[1:00:26] therefore we there's there's the the
[1:00:29] mountain that you want to choose to die
[1:00:32] on there's what you want to stand and
[1:00:35] put out there amen you've got to have a
[1:00:39] resting place for your faith and it must
[1:00:44] amen our belief should be the word of
[1:00:47] the Lord now many of us go from camp
[1:00:50] meeting to camp meeting and I amen we
[1:00:53] love camp meetings and but many people
[1:00:55] go from preacher to preacher camp
[1:00:57] meeting to camp meeting Good Feeling to
[1:00:59] Good Feeling and amen and uh many many
[1:01:03] are are going looking for a feeling or
[1:01:06] going and looking for a uh a a uh you
[1:01:10] know to to know that they've got the
[1:01:12] holy ghost or amen or or even to get
[1:01:14] prophesied over amen and while there's
[1:01:17] definitely nothing wrong with with
[1:01:20] prophecy and there's definitely nothing
[1:01:22] wrong with with with with meetings and
[1:01:25] things of that nature
[1:01:26] amen but yet the position of the
[1:01:29] believer can only be found in the word
[1:01:32] of God Amen and there's there's not a
[1:01:35] special preacher that can give you that
[1:01:37] Foundation there's not a pastor that can
[1:01:39] give you that Foundation there's not one
[1:01:41] of the nine spiritual gifts that can
[1:01:43] give you that Foundation your foundation
[1:01:46] must be built upon the word of God and
[1:01:50] the word of God Alone yes sir amen
[1:01:52] because preachers are going to come and
[1:01:54] go gifts they can fail we can have all
[1:01:57] of these things there's only one thing
[1:01:59] that will never pass away Heavens will
[1:02:01] pass away Earth will pass away but the
[1:02:04] word of God cannot pass away therefore
[1:02:07] we put our our absolute in the word of
[1:02:11] God oh glory to the Lamb of God I'm glad
[1:02:14] that I can point you this morning to an
[1:02:17] absolute that will never ever change
[1:02:21] amen though cultures change and amen and
[1:02:23] though everything else around us changed
[1:02:26] it does not matter God's word cannot
[1:02:29] change and we stand solidly upon those
[1:02:33] can you say amen amen the Holy Spirit
[1:02:36] baptizes you into the body of Believers
[1:02:39] amen places you where you can you you
[1:02:42] can thrive in in the kingdom of God Amen
[1:02:46] and and and the fivefold ministry there
[1:02:49] is to equip you and bring you into to
[1:02:53] your position in in those in in through
[1:02:55] the word of God Amen you know there in
[1:02:58] Ephesians 4:16 it says from whom the
[1:03:00] whole body fitly uh joined together and
[1:03:04] compacted by that which every joint
[1:03:07] supplieth according to the effectual
[1:03:09] working in the measure of every part
[1:03:12] maketh increase of the body unto the
[1:03:14] edifying of itself in love so so we find
[1:03:18] that God places Us in we are baptized
[1:03:21] into that body amen and there we can we
[1:03:25] can grow together we work together we
[1:03:28] manifest the presence of God Amen as
[1:03:31] human
[1:03:33] beings amen and that that doesn't mean
[1:03:35] we're going around speaking in tongues
[1:03:36] to each other all the time and we're
[1:03:38] amen laying hands on each other all the
[1:03:40] time that means that we are amen we are
[1:03:43] a unified body of Believers amen
[1:03:46] promoting the kingdom of God and we are
[1:03:49] we are putting our shoulders to the
[1:03:51] wheels we are standing in the Gap amen
[1:03:54] we are we are there for one another amen
[1:03:57] and we are all United with one common
[1:03:59] cause and that's the word of
[1:04:02] God can you say Amen now when I when I
[1:04:06] was a when I you know I was raised in
[1:04:08] Pentecost and so we we were we were uh
[1:04:12] uh you know chasing gifted men
[1:04:14] everywhere amen we were looking for
[1:04:17] someone to prophesy over us amen and and
[1:04:20] and we did and amen we we were
[1:04:22] constantly needing a word from the Lord
[1:04:25] we we would go to this Gifted Man or we
[1:04:27] would have that Gifted Man I remember we
[1:04:29] would have gifted men in in the church
[1:04:31] that could prophesy and amen and and and
[1:04:34] see visions and things and and we would
[1:04:36] oh my amen I'd sit on the front row and
[1:04:39] just praying and praying and praying
[1:04:41] that they would call me out amen and I I
[1:04:43] I I even remember I even remember just
[1:04:45] sitting outside our pastor's office amen
[1:04:48] I had my own key as a kid and amen would
[1:04:50] come into the church and I I just sat
[1:04:53] outside there amen and and and and just
[1:04:56] you know on the on the Pew and just
[1:04:57] asking God cause the preacher to to say
[1:05:00] something I I need to hear something
[1:05:02] from my pastor and amen and the Lord
[1:05:05] would bless that the Lord would bless
[1:05:07] that I'd come to church amen the next
[1:05:09] service and amen and and and and our
[1:05:11] pastor would call would would call my
[1:05:13] name and say listen amen and and would
[1:05:16] and would tell me what I was thinking
[1:05:18] and that was a wonderful thing amen God
[1:05:21] heard my prayer God callused that man to
[1:05:24] call me but you see that only lasted for
[1:05:27] a week and then I was calling to the
[1:05:28] Lord again I needed another word from
[1:05:30] the Lord but when I came into the
[1:05:32] message I found out I God's got a very
[1:05:35] specific word for
[1:05:37] me it was right here God's word God's
[1:05:41] Got A Time God's got a place God has
[1:05:45] ordained and when I found that I am not
[1:05:48] just somebody that's that's that's just
[1:05:51] you know uh randomly finding scriptures
[1:05:53] to read I found out that I am the
[1:05:57] scripture for this
[1:06:00] day then it took everything else away
[1:06:04] whether someone amen said good words
[1:06:06] over me or whether they didn't say good
[1:06:08] words over me I was established in
[1:06:12] present day truth and there was nothing
[1:06:16] that could ever take me away from
[1:06:18] that well that's the kind of believer
[1:06:22] that God is looking for well come on
[1:06:25] Church
[1:06:26] amen the trials are going to come devils
[1:06:28] are going to come the enemy's going to
[1:06:31] fight us but when you've got a
[1:06:32] revelation of who you are and what you
[1:06:35] are there is nothing that can ever
[1:06:37] separate you from that call that
[1:06:41] gift can you say amen amen now that this
[1:06:45] day is calling for men and women to step
[1:06:50] up to their position this day is calling
[1:06:54] amen this just want you turn to your
[1:06:55] neighbor and say this day is calling for
[1:06:58] you to step up into your position amen
[1:07:01] now now the three-fold purpose of Christ
[1:07:04] amen the threefold purpose of God
[1:07:06] remember God in Christ amen and and and
[1:07:10] then uh Christ having preeminence all
[1:07:14] that was in Christ is now in you Christ
[1:07:17] having preeminence is that right taking
[1:07:20] us back to Eden amen so it can all be
[1:07:23] summed up in these words here where the
[1:07:24] Apostle Paul Paul says in bringing many
[1:07:27] sons unto Glory so God's got a specific
[1:07:31] purpose not for me to set in a Pew not
[1:07:34] for this this is not Christianity
[1:07:37] Christianity is a body of Believers Amen
[1:07:41] in acting act amen as a unified group
[1:07:45] together here on Earth
[1:07:48] manifesting amen his glory to those all
[1:07:51] around us amen God's not called us to be
[1:07:54] separate God's called us as a body
[1:07:59] together well that makes me want to
[1:08:01] shout I'm I I'm part of something that
[1:08:04] is bigger than than me can you say amen
[1:08:07] amen now now I I want to say that the
[1:08:11] that the promises of God are on
[1:08:15] condition these
[1:08:17] promises amen now you say now I thought
[1:08:20] I thought the the promises of God were
[1:08:22] without condition no the promises of God
[1:08:26] are on condition they've got to be in
[1:08:29] the right
[1:08:31] season they have got to be to the right
[1:08:35] person there's got to be you can't just
[1:08:38] come out and say Amen well I believe it
[1:08:41] well Noah couldn't amen couldn't come in
[1:08:43] and preach the message of of Moses Moses
[1:08:47] can't come and preach the message of
[1:08:50] Amen of Abel you've got to be in your
[1:08:54] season you've got to know who you are
[1:08:58] where you are and why you are
[1:09:01] there now brother Bram would say there's
[1:09:04] three things that you must not
[1:09:07] do you must not misinterpret the
[1:09:11] scripture you must not misplace the word
[1:09:15] you must not dislocate the word amen is
[1:09:18] that right amen now we know that God has
[1:09:22] a master plan he's got a plan that he is
[1:09:27] that he is working in this day now it
[1:09:32] it's more than just a plan of Amen today
[1:09:34] I I want to tell you amen you're not the
[1:09:37] only one that that has that that has
[1:09:39] been or ordained you're not the only one
[1:09:41] that that God has been interested in
[1:09:43] God's been working this plan for 6,000
[1:09:46] years this plan has been going on Amen
[1:09:50] for thousands and thousands and
[1:09:51] thousands of years amen we simply amen
[1:09:55] we're blessed to be in the finality of
[1:09:57] it we are here at the very end we're
[1:10:00] here Amen in the finality of Redemption
[1:10:03] where God is going to call you and me
[1:10:06] into a
[1:10:08] Rapture well glory to God Amen I'm
[1:10:11] thankful for what God done amen uh 2,000
[1:10:14] years ago I'm thankful for what God done
[1:10:15] in the first age I'm glad God I'm
[1:10:17] thankful for what God done in the fifth
[1:10:18] age but I'm in the age and I'm expecting
[1:10:22] a specific promise to be be fulfilled in
[1:10:27] my
[1:10:29] generation so it requires me to make
[1:10:32] sure that I'm lined up with what God is
[1:10:35] doing in this day and then the promises
[1:10:39] well glory to
[1:10:41] God Amen now the
[1:10:45] cogs of God's prophetic
[1:10:48] will are very
[1:10:51] slow amen they they grind very slowly
[1:10:55] but they grind very
[1:10:58] surely you say well I've been praying
[1:11:00] and I've been praying and I've been
[1:11:01] praying and nothing's happening I've
[1:11:04] been waiting and I've been waiting and
[1:11:05] I've been waiting and nothing's
[1:11:07] happening those cogs are turning yeah
[1:11:12] those prophetic wheel of God is turning
[1:11:15] God is hearing every prayer God is
[1:11:19] hearing you see you see but but but but
[1:11:22] brother wend let let me Hallelujah if
[1:11:25] you are the predestinated people for
[1:11:28] this season even your desires are placed
[1:11:33] there by
[1:11:34] God you're Desiring a Rapture you are
[1:11:38] Desiring a higher walk you are desire
[1:11:41] because this is the season and the seeds
[1:11:46] are already placed in Your Heart by
[1:11:49] predestination you're Desiring amen
[1:11:52] you're Desiring a higher walk than what
[1:11:55] than what Luther had than what Wesley
[1:11:57] had than what 1906 had you are Desiring
[1:12:01] a walk that is even greater than those
[1:12:05] that were before
[1:12:07] you
[1:12:11] Hallelujah because it's your season yeah
[1:12:16] you see Luther they had went for
[1:12:19] thousand the Catholic church had had
[1:12:22] celebrated the Thousand-Year Millennial
[1:12:24] Reign claiming that Christ was reigning
[1:12:26] on Earth through the Catholic
[1:12:27] Church they went 1,000 nearly 1,000
[1:12:32] years ruling the world through the Kings
[1:12:36] and the monarchs
[1:12:38] Hallelujah but there was something that
[1:12:40] was rising up in the predestinated seat
[1:12:43] of God amen amen hus stood up and says I
[1:12:48] want to tell you they were fixing to
[1:12:49] kill him amen and he stood up under
[1:12:52] prophetic word and says you might be
[1:12:55] able to you you might be able to burn
[1:12:57] this Goose I believe that's the the
[1:12:59] prophecy was there you might be able to
[1:13:02] burn this Goose but in 100 years there
[1:13:05] will rise a mind that you will not be
[1:13:08] able to
[1:13:09] kill oh oh they were mad they were mad
[1:13:12] they man they killed him exactly 100
[1:13:15] years later here come Martin Luther and
[1:13:17] Martin Luther there was he couldn't be
[1:13:20] satisfied he was a priest in the
[1:13:22] Catholic church trying to be happy
[1:13:25] trying to amen there he was trying to be
[1:13:27] a good monk he was trying to be a good
[1:13:30] amen and and there he is uh uh uh you
[1:13:33] know trying to earn his salvation amen
[1:13:36] and so his high high up authorities
[1:13:38] would say you need to try this and you
[1:13:40] need to do this and finally they sent
[1:13:41] him to Rome and said you need to do this
[1:13:43] and when you get up to this step and
[1:13:44] you've got to kiss this cross so many
[1:13:46] times and you got to do this and and and
[1:13:48] he would beat his back until it was
[1:13:50] Bloody amen there his knees were bloody
[1:13:52] as he's crawling trying to earn a
[1:13:54] Salvation and when he got to a certain
[1:13:56] place he had stopped and fixing a kiss
[1:13:58] across and then all of a sudden the
[1:14:00] scripture came to him and says the just
[1:14:02] shall live by
[1:14:05] faith all of a sudden A New World opened
[1:14:08] up into him he jumped up and says I am
[1:14:11] saved by the grace of God and that man
[1:14:15] single-handedly started a revolution
[1:14:18] amen the Reformation took place why
[1:14:21] there was a seat on the inside that was
[1:14:24] called calling out for the word of God
[1:14:28] to be fulfilled in that day through
[1:14:33] him the pope didn't know nothing about
[1:14:35] it others didn't know nothing about it
[1:14:37] but there was something that was burning
[1:14:39] on the inside of him saying I've got to
[1:14:41] know it I've got to know it and when the
[1:14:43] word begin to make its me itself real in
[1:14:46] that season in the right time in the
[1:14:50] right hour the word sprung up in his
[1:14:53] heart and we understand what what took
[1:14:55] place the Reformation began
[1:14:59] worldwide what was it it was the word of
[1:15:04] God coming in its season at its
[1:15:08] designated
[1:15:12] time some of us are praying for our
[1:15:15] children maybe they're out in the
[1:15:17] world I just want to tell you there's a
[1:15:20] designated
[1:15:22] season there's a designated time
[1:15:25] you keep on praying You Keep On
[1:15:28] Believing but God knows the time clock
[1:15:31] and when that time clock strikes 12 amen
[1:15:34] it doesn't matter it's not going to
[1:15:36] happen a minute before 12 and it ain't
[1:15:38] going to happen a minute after 12 God's
[1:15:41] got a
[1:15:42] season do you believe that God's got a
[1:15:52] time that makes me feel that makes me
[1:15:55] want to shout that's right amen Abraham
[1:15:59] Abraham went for for years amen waiting
[1:16:03] on that child waiting on that child then
[1:16:05] a lot had already given up and this one
[1:16:07] had already given up but but there and
[1:16:09] and Abraham's family Hallelujah but here
[1:16:12] he waited amen and then at the decreed
[1:16:17] season at the decreed time the son of
[1:16:21] man came Prophet God came and discerned
[1:16:24] the the heart amen of uh right before
[1:16:27] the destruction of Sodom in fact when he
[1:16:30] come in here come the Three Angels to
[1:16:32] him amen they were they were clothed in
[1:16:34] flesh and and there he says my Lord and
[1:16:38] then God says how can I keep anything
[1:16:40] from Abraham seeing that he is my friend
[1:16:43] and seeing that he is going to be the
[1:16:45] ruler of the earth and he tells them he
[1:16:47] says Sodom is fixing to be to to to be
[1:16:50] destroyed amen and and and Abraham even
[1:16:53] tried Amen to change God's mind he says
[1:16:56] oh that can't happen Lots down there in
[1:16:58] Sodom we cannot do that you amen if if
[1:17:01] there's if there's 50 in the city amen
[1:17:03] will you spare them if there's 30 in the
[1:17:05] city will you spare them and finally he
[1:17:08] comes back and says they're not there
[1:17:10] they're not there you see the plan of
[1:17:11] God will come to
[1:17:15] pass but he came to Abraham because
[1:17:18] Abraham had some Abraham had some family
[1:17:21] down there that he was interceding for
[1:17:24] that's right
[1:17:25] did you know that brother brandham says
[1:17:27] Amen brother brother Bram says that that
[1:17:29] that you are going that the elect the
[1:17:31] adopted sons of God are are going to go
[1:17:34] to the end of the
[1:17:35] road after the after their family after
[1:17:39] those that are lost well praise the Lord
[1:17:42] he says just as Abraham went to the end
[1:17:45] of the road after lot so will the
[1:17:48] adopted sons of God go to the end of the
[1:17:50] road why because you are destined for
[1:17:54] this
[1:17:58] Hallelujah well can you say Amen so here
[1:18:02] then he turns his attention to Abraham
[1:18:06] he says Abraham you've been waiting for
[1:18:07] a long time but The Season's coming
[1:18:11] seasons are changing something's fixing
[1:18:14] to take place and he tells Abraham amen
[1:18:17] he says according to the time of
[1:18:22] life you Sarah is going to have that
[1:18:24] shot now now now now now now now get
[1:18:27] this because Sarah had in her unbelief
[1:18:29] had already got Abraham to marry her the
[1:18:32] her maid amen they had tried different
[1:18:34] ways because they just did she didn't
[1:18:36] think it was going to happen but yet God
[1:18:38] had already planned it God had already
[1:18:41] spoken it was already decreed it was
[1:18:44] already set into motion but it could not
[1:18:47] come to pass until the appointed
[1:18:52] predestinated time of God
[1:18:57] amen well I feel a I I feel a purpose I
[1:19:00] feel I know God's called me but then
[1:19:02] brother Wendell I've not heard anything
[1:19:04] else there will be a specific
[1:19:08] time well glory to
[1:19:11] God did you know that the Israelite
[1:19:14] would be cut off from the
[1:19:16] people if he did not Worship the Lord at
[1:19:21] the designated time amen okay you see if
[1:19:26] they did not bring that offering to to
[1:19:30] uh to
[1:19:32] Jerusalem at that offering to the Lord
[1:19:34] in his appointed
[1:19:36] season the scripture says that he would
[1:19:39] be cut off from the people and he would
[1:19:42] have to bear his sin now think about
[1:19:44] that it was his
[1:19:47] responsibility to identify that season
[1:19:51] and to Worship the Lord in that season
[1:19:55] okay amen now I I'm I I I I'm talking
[1:19:58] about us in our personal walk but I I I
[1:20:01] I my my main focus this morning that I'm
[1:20:03] wanting us to see is the church as a
[1:20:06] whole that we are living in a specific
[1:20:10] time a specific season this is a
[1:20:14] glorious season that we're living in
[1:20:17] amen am I doing all right here this
[1:20:19] morning many many have tried to help god
[1:20:22] with his plan many have tried not saying
[1:20:25] you know claiming this is the way that
[1:20:27] God's going to fulfill his plan you know
[1:20:29] Sarah and and and say well this is the
[1:20:31] way it's got to happen or this is the
[1:20:32] way it's got to happen we must believe
[1:20:35] it this way or or that way and we get so
[1:20:37] many going every which direction but
[1:20:40] God's got his word god decreed it and
[1:20:43] God will fulfill it in his exact
[1:20:47] [Applause]
[1:20:49] time you can prophesy it and you can
[1:20:52] pray it and you can fast it and you can
[1:20:54] do everything else nothing's going to
[1:20:56] hurry the time clock of God if God's got
[1:20:59] you in a valley right now and you're
[1:21:01] going to be in that Valley till God
[1:21:02] brings you out of that
[1:21:04] Valley come on come on we are reliant
[1:21:08] upon the ways of God and God's looking
[1:21:11] for men and women who are going to trust
[1:21:13] him that's right trust him though I walk
[1:21:16] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:21:17] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:21:21] with
[1:21:22] me well glory to God Amen now brother
[1:21:27] Brandon would say the main thing is if
[1:21:30] we can find where God's word belongs in
[1:21:33] our life God sets times and time limits
[1:21:38] and then it works all to that same many
[1:21:42] of them before the coming of the Lord
[1:21:43] Jesus many they they were there was many
[1:21:46] uh false things rised up and said this
[1:21:49] is the Messiah and this is and many
[1:21:52] false things that taken place according
[1:21:54] to the scpt scripture just before the
[1:21:56] coming of the Lord Jesus you see people
[1:21:59] try to do it within themselves they try
[1:22:02] to make God's word fit in their program
[1:22:06] and but you but but that you got it vice
[1:22:09] versa you've got to fit in God's
[1:22:13] program we don't want God hallelujah
[1:22:16] we're we're we're we're amen today we've
[1:22:18] got this charismatic move everything is
[1:22:20] is God is answering your whim every whim
[1:22:23] that you've got God got to respond to
[1:22:25] your wh God ain't got to respond to
[1:22:27] nothing to
[1:22:28] you God is God God's got a purpose God's
[1:22:31] got a plan and you had better find that
[1:22:36] plan because he's working everything
[1:22:39] according to that plan not according to
[1:22:41] your whim not according to what you want
[1:22:45] he's got the
[1:22:49] plan can you say
[1:22:51] Amen so we must be careful
[1:22:55] to follow the scripture do you see where
[1:22:57] we fit in because I promise just as The
[1:23:01] Seven Ages were found in the
[1:23:03] word and just as the prophet of Malachi
[1:23:07] 4 was found in the word yeah and just as
[1:23:10] Jesus was found in the word so are you
[1:23:15] found in the
[1:23:16] word you are found in the written word
[1:23:21] come on Church you're not here by
[1:23:23] accident you are here because God built
[1:23:28] you designed you predestinated you and
[1:23:32] he's put you here to fit in his
[1:23:37] plan
[1:23:38] Hallelujah am I doing is this
[1:23:41] okay y'all think I should uh sorry guys
[1:23:46] having a problem with this thing
[1:23:53] today
[1:23:56] Hallelujah hallu glory to
[1:24:00] God Amen someone shout hallelujah
[1:24:03] hallelujah he's got a
[1:24:06] purpose I'm not here for my own I'm here
[1:24:09] for his purpose somebody say turn your
[1:24:13] neighbor and say you're not here for
[1:24:14] your own
[1:24:15] purpose he's got a
[1:24:18] purpose now brother Brandon would talk
[1:24:20] to us amen about the four stages of the
[1:24:23] wheat plant
[1:24:25] amen and he would say that it was a as a
[1:24:27] type of the church coming out of the
[1:24:29] Dark Ages and one of the Mysteries that
[1:24:31] was to be unveiled in this day was the
[1:24:34] mystery of the church there were all the
[1:24:37] Mysteries and it says amen that there
[1:24:39] that that the church was a mystery that
[1:24:42] had to be unveiled in this time in this
[1:24:45] time and when the mystery would be
[1:24:48] unveiled it would unveil certain times
[1:24:53] certain seasons
[1:24:54] amen certain
[1:24:56] timelines it would show us when the when
[1:24:59] the when the H the Mysteries were
[1:25:02] unscrambled when when when everything
[1:25:05] that was all in symbol form was uh uh
[1:25:08] made real and unveiled before us we
[1:25:11] would find that there are seven Church
[1:25:13] ages and that there were seven uh
[1:25:15] Messengers to those Church ages and
[1:25:18] there was a specific time for each one
[1:25:20] of those ages right amen that's that's
[1:25:24] what the scripture had told us that's
[1:25:25] what we found in this day but the
[1:25:27] scripture says that there in Revelations
[1:25:29] the 10th chapter in the first verse
[1:25:31] behold I I I I I that there was another
[1:25:33] angel that appeared amen and had a
[1:25:35] rainbow over him and amen came clothed
[1:25:38] with a cloud and he come with a book
[1:25:41] Hallelujah that was once sealed up that
[1:25:44] was once that was once closed and now
[1:25:47] the scripture says he comes with an open
[1:25:50] book amen and in that day with the open
[1:25:54] book would be a very specific time it
[1:25:57] would do a very specific thing for it
[1:26:00] says time shall be no
[1:26:02] longer it says that there would come a
[1:26:05] time when the Thunders would be uttered
[1:26:09] amen and the Seven Thunders would be in
[1:26:11] a amen would be unscrambled because down
[1:26:14] in the in in Revelations 10 and 7 it
[1:26:17] says but in the days of the voice of the
[1:26:19] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:26:22] sound the mystery of God concerning the
[1:26:26] church would be
[1:26:28] finished it's a specific time it
[1:26:32] couldn't be done in the second age or
[1:26:33] the third age or the fifth age it
[1:26:35] couldn't be done at the beginning of the
[1:26:37] seventh age it had to come according to
[1:26:40] God's
[1:26:44] timeline you realize that before brother
[1:26:46] brandom
[1:26:47] came did you realize that our Prophet
[1:26:50] was not the first one to say Amen that
[1:26:52] he was Elijah okay
[1:26:55] Alexander dwe built an entire built an
[1:26:59] entire complex amen and he was the
[1:27:03] Elijah that's right go look up Alexander
[1:27:06] Dowry great man of God great gift of
[1:27:09] healing wonderful had many followers you
[1:27:13] see but it was not the season it was not
[1:27:17] the time and it was not the
[1:27:21] person therefore it ended up it ended up
[1:27:24] in defeat it didn't mean that the word
[1:27:27] wasn't going to happen it didn't mean
[1:27:29] that the season wasn't coming it simply
[1:27:32] meant there was somebody trying to make
[1:27:35] it happen and it was not
[1:27:38] time but in the days of the voice when
[1:27:41] that Mighty Angel comes down in a cloud
[1:27:43] when that Mighty Angel come and he
[1:27:46] declares himself to the whole world then
[1:27:49] you know this is the season
[1:27:55] oh do you love him here this morning so
[1:27:59] I'm not following something that I'm
[1:28:00] thinking no this is something that God
[1:28:02] has come down to vindicate in our
[1:28:03] generation to say hey it's your time
[1:28:07] it's your season worship
[1:28:11] here amen now the prophet would tell us
[1:28:16] he would take the scripture that Jesus
[1:28:19] says except a corn of wheat fall into
[1:28:21] the ground and die it abides alone but
[1:28:23] if if it die it shall come up and bring
[1:28:27] forth much fruit and we understand that
[1:28:30] there was the blade and there was the
[1:28:32] tassel amen and then there was the Shu
[1:28:35] and then there was the seed within the
[1:28:37] Shu amen now am am I doing okay here
[1:28:40] this morning amen there was those things
[1:28:42] that were there that was going to come
[1:28:44] in at seas and there's no way that
[1:28:46] you're going to put something in the
[1:28:47] ground and then come up with a
[1:28:49] shock you couldn't you couldn't do that
[1:28:51] you could not put it in the ground and
[1:28:53] come up with a steel
[1:28:54] you've got to come if you put it in the
[1:28:56] ground and it dies there's got to be a
[1:28:58] blade that begins to come up a leaf that
[1:29:00] comes up that's the predestinated season
[1:29:03] that doesn't mean that that season
[1:29:05] wasn't the right season that doesn't
[1:29:07] mean that that season was not the plant
[1:29:09] that does not that doesn't mean that the
[1:29:10] season that you're in right now in your
[1:29:12] growth with God Amen maybe maybe you
[1:29:14] don't look nothing like the seed maybe
[1:29:16] you don't look nothing like this up here
[1:29:18] maybe you're down here but it doesn't
[1:29:20] matter you're part of the plant
[1:29:24] in your walk with God now this here is
[1:29:27] talking about the def the the the ages
[1:29:30] but you and I in our personal Walks With
[1:29:33] God we're all at many different
[1:29:37] stages amen some of us are in
[1:29:39] justification some of us are in
[1:29:41] sanctification amen some of us some of
[1:29:44] us still need amen some sanctifying some
[1:29:47] of us still need some purging eating of
[1:29:49] that book amen purging out our own ways
[1:29:52] our own thinking our own come come on
[1:29:54] now it says eat that book it's going to
[1:29:57] be sweet here but it's going to be woo
[1:30:00] rough in the belly that means you got
[1:30:02] some stuff on the inside of you that
[1:30:03] needs to be coming out can you say Amen
[1:30:07] you've got to be but but thank God for
[1:30:10] it because God gave you the open book
[1:30:13] God gave you the Revelation in this
[1:30:15] season and God is glorifying himself in
[1:30:19] the bride in this
[1:30:22] season this season came have your
[1:30:24] opinions right this season can't have
[1:30:27] what Mama thinks this season can't have
[1:30:30] what Daddy thinks this season has come
[1:30:33] through the Vindicated word of Malachi 4
[1:30:36] and you've got to
[1:30:38] purge your old thinking your own ways
[1:30:41] the old leav and come in to the revealed
[1:30:46] word can you say
[1:30:48] Amen you see the leaf identified the
[1:30:52] season and because the seed was in the
[1:30:54] ground it was going it was craving the
[1:30:57] seed couldn't stop amen with a with a
[1:31:00] with the blade the seed couldn't stop
[1:31:02] with a stock amen because it was
[1:31:04] predestinated for
[1:31:06] seeds it was predestinated to declare
[1:31:09] who it was Hallelujah and in your walk I
[1:31:13] just want to tell you right now maybe
[1:31:14] you're maybe you're thinking oh I don't
[1:31:16] look like nothing like the other wheat
[1:31:17] plant I don't look nothing like the seed
[1:31:19] I don't look oh but what do you have on
[1:31:21] the inside of you why is that that cry
[1:31:24] on the inside of you that is screaming
[1:31:26] out I want to be like my daddy I want to
[1:31:29] be what he ordained me to be amen why
[1:31:32] because you've got the seed on the
[1:31:33] inside of you and you've got to come out
[1:31:36] in your season and your time just keep
[1:31:38] on
[1:31:41] growing
[1:31:44] Hallelujah you don't want to remain in
[1:31:46] the blade if the life is in the tassel
[1:31:49] come
[1:31:50] on you say well what God done for me I'm
[1:31:56] ahhh if you want to keep walking with
[1:31:58] God you're going to have to keep on
[1:32:01] going yesterday's experience is okay but
[1:32:04] now God is calling you on up into the
[1:32:09] tassel Hallelujah you preachers know
[1:32:12] this when you look you can look back at
[1:32:13] some of your sermons that you preached
[1:32:15] 10 years ago you look at it and there's
[1:32:17] no life in it you know you just it was
[1:32:19] what God was dealing with you back then
[1:32:22] he would anoint that back then but God's
[1:32:24] not giving canned sermons to preachers
[1:32:26] today he's giving a real real a reality
[1:32:31] of himself the life of God is
[1:32:35] in this part of the
[1:32:37] plant can you say that it's God is
[1:32:41] dealing with us calling us a p you see
[1:32:45] maturity is so incredible because God's
[1:32:48] calling you to
[1:32:52] maturity that's good you can sit there
[1:32:55] in a church for a hundred years and not
[1:32:57] be mature that's God's calling us come
[1:33:03] up
[1:33:04] hallelujah amen he's calling us come up
[1:33:08] and I say the time the season he man is
[1:33:11] here oh glory to God brother Brandon
[1:33:14] would say he says God's got a time for
[1:33:16] all things he's he's got a time that he
[1:33:18] has we plant corn we got a time that we
[1:33:21] plant corn then at that time we and then
[1:33:25] uh then at at the time we harvest corn
[1:33:28] spring rains come the droughts come
[1:33:30] through the summer the fall rains and
[1:33:32] the the the Snows you just can't say I
[1:33:36] plant my wheat today and tomorrow and go
[1:33:39] out and harvest it God's got times
[1:33:41] someone say times for a season he has
[1:33:45] seasons for his word that's what God is
[1:33:49] doing oh I I I just want to just keep
[1:33:52] driving it home right now he me he's got
[1:33:54] seasons for his word he's got seasons
[1:33:58] for your life he's got Seasons you're
[1:34:00] saying does he hear me does he care does
[1:34:03] he understand I don't care what season
[1:34:06] you're in you're part of the
[1:34:11] plant amen
[1:34:15] now he would say the Sun comes across
[1:34:18] and ripens the grain it cannot ripen it
[1:34:21] all at once as it goes on maturing it's
[1:34:24] constantly ripening until it comes to a
[1:34:27] full ear and so it is today with the
[1:34:30] church it started in its infancy back in
[1:34:34] the Dark Ages where it was under the
[1:34:35] ground and it's grown now into maturity
[1:34:39] and now and we can see it perfectly how
[1:34:41] that God through nature always can you
[1:34:44] say amen hallelujah are y'all are y'all
[1:34:47] catching what I'm saying so the
[1:34:49] church if you look there in where you
[1:34:52] are today and if the season is calling
[1:34:55] for maturity you don't want to stay in
[1:34:58] the shock yeah because when the season
[1:35:00] of the word came the Shu enjoyed
[1:35:03] Pentecost enjoyed brother brandom amen
[1:35:06] they they they they they they ran him
[1:35:07] across the world seven times but when
[1:35:11] the word begin to come in a in a in a
[1:35:14] more personal way to them then all of a
[1:35:18] sudden they said no no I can't do that
[1:35:21] the life was going to continue and the
[1:35:23] shuck was going to have to pull
[1:35:28] back come
[1:35:30] on that was that that was that
[1:35:33] Pentecostal amen ideology that mama said
[1:35:36] and daddy said and grandma said and the
[1:35:38] preacher says and I think and you think
[1:35:41] and
[1:35:42] no it's the
[1:35:45] word manifesting itself living
[1:35:50] itself can you say am man it's the life
[1:35:53] yes you're a part of the plant you're
[1:35:56] living you're thriving you we there is a
[1:36:00] well uh organized group there you go
[1:36:04] that the Holy Spirit has put
[1:36:07] together he's put it together can you
[1:36:10] say amen amen yes
[1:36:14] now I hope this is okay here this
[1:36:18] morning now brother Brandon would say
[1:36:20] when he would ask he would say now when
[1:36:23] when
[1:36:24] that there there's got to be a changing
[1:36:27] of Seasons there's got to be a changing
[1:36:29] of
[1:36:30] times and he says according to scripture
[1:36:33] we can find those changing of times if
[1:36:36] we'll just be willing to
[1:36:38] follow Oh Glory to God he man brother
[1:36:41] Brandon would say an indictment he'd say
[1:36:44] now notice how appropriate was now
[1:36:47] showing that that Jerusalem was ceasing
[1:36:50] when it was in effect until that hour
[1:36:53] the blood of the Lamb was all right
[1:36:55] until that day but now at the
[1:36:57] crucifixion it changes the old the old
[1:37:00] system is done there was a new one the
[1:37:04] lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the
[1:37:06] sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they
[1:37:09] were condemning and doing the very thing
[1:37:12] there that they had to do that's right
[1:37:15] God be blessed for seeing this wonderful
[1:37:17] Heavenly light in this last day because
[1:37:20] the church is is doing the same thing
[1:37:22] today until the hour that
[1:37:25] organization religion is condemned and
[1:37:29] proved to be sacrificing Christ word he
[1:37:32] says from then on comes the word and the
[1:37:36] word
[1:37:38] only oh now the denominations were all
[1:37:40] built around an opinion good opinions
[1:37:43] wonderful
[1:37:45] opinions but brother Bram says those
[1:37:47] things separated
[1:37:50] Brotherhood he says it's SE
[1:37:52] denominational ISM separates
[1:37:58] Brotherhood
[1:38:00] separates but he says but from then on
[1:38:04] comes the word it's a word bride in a
[1:38:09] bride
[1:38:10] time Bride
[1:38:12] season word coming we are now focusing
[1:38:16] on the main thing and that is Christ his
[1:38:22] word can you say amen amen it don't
[1:38:25] matter whether I'm waking up on a on a
[1:38:26] on a on a good day or bad day it doesn't
[1:38:28] matter whether I've got I've got
[1:38:30] prophecy coming to me saying this or
[1:38:32] that it don't matter whether amen this
[1:38:34] happens or that happens what matters is
[1:38:37] is the word has come in this day God has
[1:38:40] Vindicated that and I refuse to go any
[1:38:43] other way well according to my opinions
[1:38:46] I refuse to do anything contrary to the
[1:38:50] revealed word of the hour God let me
[1:38:54] let me be the
[1:38:55] life in this final
[1:38:59] day let this be the resurrection time in
[1:39:02] me he says it comes the word and the
[1:39:04] word only from the old Pascal lamb
[1:39:06] that's passed away and the Christ become
[1:39:09] our lamb at the day of
[1:39:11] crucifixion and the day that the
[1:39:14] denomination crucified the word of God
[1:39:17] attempted a Creed in the stad of the
[1:39:20] word that's the day the word will come
[1:39:23] into full
[1:39:25] effect that's just been recently so
[1:39:27] what's brother BR doing he is pointing
[1:39:29] us now he's he's putting us right there
[1:39:31] showing the season where it changed from
[1:39:34] the
[1:39:35] shu to the life to the seed can you say
[1:39:41] Amen this bright age is far more than
[1:39:47] saying uh or you know just a saying well
[1:39:50] we're in the bride age or we're in
[1:39:52] adoption age or we're in it's a living
[1:39:54] reality it's the time where the bride is
[1:39:56] coming to
[1:39:57] maturity it's the time where the bride
[1:39:59] is is is no she's she's no longer she's
[1:40:03] no longer moved by all of
[1:40:06] the No No the little the the the little

[2:00:24] message it's because they're taking one
[2:00:27] little quote and building their
[2:00:30] denomination around
[2:00:33] it maybe they've got three quotes
[2:00:36] here and this seven Thunder Doctrine
[2:00:40] can't agree with this one and this one
[2:00:42] can't agree with this one and I'm just
[2:00:44] talking about the seven Thunders cuz I
[2:00:46] looked it up when they were trying to
[2:00:47] get me in it amen
[2:00:52] thought okay well there's something
