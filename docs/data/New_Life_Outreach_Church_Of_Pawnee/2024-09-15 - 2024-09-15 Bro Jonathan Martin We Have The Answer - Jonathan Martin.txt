day and and uh it's so good to be in the house of the Lord and we have uh just immensely enjoyed the meeting uh as I was saying last night it's been uh just a tremendous encouragement to me and uh just a real blessing and uh I can honestly say that uh it's been very good to be here and uh just uh enjoyed all of the songs and the music and uh the ministry I'm so thankful for present truth and I'm so thankful for uh uh for the revealed word of the hour and I'm so glad that I can see my name uh in The Inheritance and the reading of the will and as these brothers are preaching my I just seen my name all over the promises and uh something that I can recognize and identify myself and uh and uh I'm just so thankful for the grace of God you know uh what can we say about uh just all of the hospitality and the food and the snacks that were put in the room and we uh we just so appreciate uh brother Wendell and the church and uh you're just a great blessing great inspiration to us uh we're just uh we're just proud to be identified with you all and and uh know that God is doing a a great work in each of your lives and uh we just uh all the ministering brothers that are here uh we just want to say God richly bless you we appreciate your your friendship and uh you'll never really uh know uh just what you mean to us uh just uh to be able to put our shoulder uh to the whe with you and uh and uh just your just just the fellowship and the the comrad uh uh over the last couple of days it's been uh refreshing and uh we just want to say God richly bless you God richly bless your Ministries bless your congregations back home and uh the evangelists that are on the field we need evangelist on the field uh we need this message being preached and uh not ashamed of it but preach it in the in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and uh so if you have your Bibles we'll just turn over to Matthew uh the 16th chapter and then we'll turn just read a scripture out of Luke 17 and verse 30 and um our voice has been weak over the last seems like I've been struggling with it over the last couple three months and uh uh strained it a little bit last night and I know this is the last service and I know probably a little bit tired but uh if God God will just give us the grace we have it in our heart to just uh say something that'll that'll that you can just take home with you and it'll be a strength with you throughout the weeks and months to come and and uh we just uh we just pray that uh we can say something that'll be a blessing Matthew the 16th chapter verse 15 and down to the 18th verse and these are very familiar portions of scripture to us he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church now brother randam was show us that he didn't build it on Peter neither did he just build it on himself but he was building the church upon the revelation of who Jesus is and upon this Revelation I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against Ed now Luke 17 and: 30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated for a text I would like to just uh title this we have the answer and uh you know uh Paul would tell us that the preaching of the revealed truth is to bring us all into the unity of the faith it is to bring us into the knowledge of the Son of God into a perfect man which is a mature man and we understand that we're made perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ but the word is to bring a maturity in our lives and uh every age that portion of word that was preached brought forth uh a furtherance an advancement of the Gospel into the individual's life and so we have advanced from justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost unto the word itself the Holy Ghost living the word in the individual and this would be the full measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and it the purpose is that we would not be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning crafty craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive how many knows that we're living in a in an age of great deception it'll be so close it would deceive the very elected if it were possible but we're to speak the truth in love that we may grow up into him in all things how many remembers we've been restored unto all things and so we are growing up into Christ in all things and he is our head Christ is the head of the church and now brother bradam would preach a sermon Christ is revealed in his own word and he would say I would like to take this for a text he says now where I come to the conclusion to talk on this was pause knowing that we that what we say we mustn't just say because we're gathered together to just haphazardly speak on anything but it's something that will help stabilize the people for we are going to pass through dangerous treacherous Waters so the prophet knew that we were going to go through some dangerous treacherous Waters so he's going to bring something that is going to stabilize the Church of the Living God we're already selling through them and sometimes I guess it's with you like it is with me that seems like so much of it it's just scary how many can say we're living in treacherous times and sometimes we can it just flat out scary but you see the prophet is showing us that we've got something he's giving us something that is going to stabilize us now the prophet of God would say when a man once catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he's always present there it is he's always present there is something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen yet by promise so God is not wanting us to look around at what's happening around us but he's wanting us to look upward and catch uh the vision of the invisible God and so we see that that is what this great revealing what is revealing it's an un an unveiling that thing which was hid that thing which is invisible is now made known and this is the thing that is going to stabilize the Church of the Living God Amen so the pro uh Paul would say that I pray I've heard of your faith your Believers you're you're holy go you're a holy ghost fill church but this is my desire this is what I'm praying that God would give un to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding being Enlighten that you may know say that I may know what is he speaking of it's speaking of a revelation that it may be revealed to you what is the hope of your calling of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and then this is such a precious scripture to us because it's saying that the eyes of your understanding would be enlightened and here we are living in Leota Le oia is blind and don't know gross darkness is covering this age but you see here we are living in the Fulfillment of Paul's desire for the church that are eyes would be enlightened because even Jesus said at that day you shall know isn't that amazing at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you I don't know anything more stabilizing than to know that in this day when the word is revealed it is made known that all that it was a all that God is was poured into Christ and all that Christ is has been poured into the Church of the Living God and he'll never leave his church he'll never leave his church we're going through some trying times we're going through some great great great Winds of adversity but the stabilizing force of the revealing that it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen it's an unshakable unmovable revelation of who is in your ship who is in your flesh amen this is a mud ship friends it's just a little mud boo but that we are the dwelling place of the revelation we are tabernacling the revelation of God in morade in human flesh amen you see the Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the divine revelation of Christ and has been in all ages remember all ages who did the word of the Lord come to the prophet alone so the prophet of God would tell us that we're living in an hour that we've got to have an absolute because we've got so much turmoil so much Winds of adversity and so he would begin to preach to us an absolute and he would tell us Webster says that an absolute is perfect in itself Unlimited in its power primarily an ultimate Unlimited in its power perfect in itself and it really is and ultimate the word absolute and the prophet would tell us that now every great achievement is tied to an absolute now now remember the prophet would tell us that you are his achievement amen how many remembers that the prophet of God says that the bride of Christ is God's achievement you are what God has been building and working to achieve in Satan's own Eden amen so he says every great achievement is tied to an absolute you can can not run life without having an absolute you can't make an achievement without it being an absolute it is the final TI poost it's a place where you are tied to something and he says in the day that we're living in now and everything is so breaking up so fragile and carried away I think that this message would be a very appropriate thing especially to Christians when they are going through their deep Waters now the Christian church is passing through the deepest Waters it's had for the last 2,000 years because we are coming to a spot to where there is something presented to Christianity something they have to make a decision on and I think that the Christian Church ought to have something that they know that they are tied to instead of just floating about like a leaf upon the Water the wind as the Bible said carried about by every wind of Doctrine the winds come and blow the little leaf this way and then another wind Comes The North Wind the south wind the East Wind the West Wind you'll never get anywhere you're not stabled the Christian Life should be a stabled life are you hearing me the Christian Life should be a state AED life it should be something that's a principle that you're tied to that is more than life itself I tell you friends the absolute is more than life itself it's more than a good job it's more than a nice vehicle it's more than having money in the bank it's more than just having nice clothes it's more than where you live uh it's more than life itself and what is better than life is the loving kindness of God that would reveal himself in the son of man and show Mercy to your life by putting an absolute in your heart that you become unmovable unshakable you're something that anchors your soul though you may go through sickness though you may go through discouraging times though the devil they tried to shake your home though the devil is allowing that this Satan's eating is so perverted and filthy and Chaos abounds but there is an absolute God has achieved a church that is stable when everyone else is shifting sand everyone else is losing their minds everyone else is giving them giving over to depression giving over to to false false doctrines and false ideas but there is a people that is established there is a people that has grown up under the headship they're mature Sons and Daughters of God that's been positionally placed by the message of the hour you see Moses God sent Moses to give the people an an absolute he was an absolute in The Exodus and those that received his message it stabilized him now there was a lot there there was actually a a far greater majority that was following the message that couldn't surrender to the headship of that message and they were unstable always wanted to go back always longing for this always longing for that but you see there was a Joshua and Caleb they were staple you see they were going through the Temptations Just as much as everyone else but they were stable they were facing hardships just as much as everyone else they were stable they were thirsty just like everyone else but they were stable they were wondering where food was going to come from as well but they were stable hallelujah what stabilized them they knew that Moses had a direct contact with the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire was being a message was being released from the lips of Moses and they knew it was thus sayeth the Lord and it stabilized their actions it stabilized their emotions it stabilized everything about them and in turn they stabilized their home you see Paul Paul met that same Pillar of Fire and he gave an absolute to the church see the prophet of God would show us that there was a difference between the the Corinthian Church and the Ephesus Church and the Corinthian Church was always following a man they were always wondering about this teaching and wondering about what they're preaching and following this ministry and following that Ministry and it just led to caral impersonations it led to misplacing scra misplacing things of the church and ups and downs but you see but you see Paul was trying to establish that church always correcting that church all always trying to tell them hey don't do this you need to do this and but you see when it come to the Ephesian church he never had to do that because they submitted to the absolute they were all already submitted to the pillar of Fire by submitting themselves to the voice of God for the age and Paul didn't have to always set them in order he taught them you're chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world you've got an inheritance uh God has called you for a purpose uh God has called you to adoption he's predestinated you unto the adoption of sons that everything that Adam lost has been restored to you and under that absolute uh they could stand there stabilized uh and meet the challenge of the age thank you Lord I can't get to preaching like that I'll lose my voice too much so we'll just go along here you see they were established now the prophet of God says it don't make any difference what others want to believe how many can say Amen to that Amen to the individual now he's bringing it right down to your Pew right where you're sitting to the individual you are tied to that and then if he is the word then this must be the last word this must settle it whatever that says that's that Scarlet thread that is Christ and anything contrary to that I know nothing about it I just want to say that's where I want to stand anything contrary to this absolute I don't want nothing know nothing about it I don't care to know anything about it I don't need to be in the gossip section I don't need to know what this is preaching and that I really it doesn't matter to me I am establ I am stabilized under the headship of the Vindicated message of the hour I'll I I'll tell you friends let me just get real for a moment when I start hearing about what this and that and get know you know that that is something that tries to destabilize you this must be the last word this must settle it whatever that says that's that Scarlet thread that is Christ and anything contrary to that I know nothing about it that's what we want to know is what this word says for I am tied to Christ and Christ is the word you get it now and the portion of his word that's lotted for this day his holy spirit is here to manifest that portion of the word and remember the message is Christ now when Isaiah 9 six was made manifest it was fulfilled then that become the tpost of the word of God for that age Jesus Christ the word made flesh was the ti poost to the age and the prophet says the real Born Again people of this age that's filled with the Holy Ghost is the tyos of this scripture that's got to be fulfilled in these last days they are the alt it can you imagine this that the word made manifest the word prophesied for this day made manifest in your flesh you become the absolute unshakable unmovable stable standing upon the revealed word of the hour and the de and and the devil's trying everything and yet you stand there as an absolute I know you've got a lot of you you the devil's trying to tell you how could that be it's not you it's not your mind you have become pregnated with the mind of Christ you know what he wants done with the word and you're standing saying Amen to every word you're a Christian you're a Believer you are a son and daughter of God that is an absolute to your family an absolute to your community an absolute in this church you are an absolute you say well I what what does that have to do with anything well the prophet of God says it's God's ultimate because it's his word and the word is Christ the ti poost there is no way to get away from it something that holds you as I said it makes you do things that you ordinarily wouldn't do it made Paul do things he ordinarily wouldn't do it made Moses do things ordinarily he wouldn't do it makes every man and woman do things they wouldn't ordinarily it's something that you are Center to it's something it's your stabilizer do you appreciate that it's your stabilizer now you see the same Pillar of Fire that met Moses met Paul because the prophet of God says that Moses wrote the Old Testament Paul wrote the New Testament it was the pillar of Fire coming to these men but you see now it is the pillar of fire the same Pillar of Fire that has come to William Branham and has given us the correct interpretation of the scripture because the prophet says the mysteries of God made known to us in this day by the same Heavenly messenger that was made known to them in them days the same Pillar of Fire that sent Moses the same Pillar of Fire that was on Moses that wrote the Bible the same Pillar of Fire that met Paul on his road to Damascus and now and let's just go on down and think of it the same Pillar of Fire that come upon those men that wrote the Bible is the same Pillar of Fire here today interpreting the Bible how we thank him for that this is not just a prophet now how I thank him for that that I just want to put my voice with this Vindicated Prophet how I thank him for that I thank him for I I thank you more for that than the very breath that I breathe more than having money more than anything else I have found the correct interpretation of the word out of thousands of winds blowing out of all the doctrines and interpretations I have found something just stabilize my actions sir not flying this way and flying that way I have come back to an adopted son back to Authority back to what Adam was made in the image of God that my soul is stabilizing my emotions stabilizing my thinking stabilizing my imagination stabilizing reasoning stabilizing every sense that the devil can anoint I am anointed by the stabilizing force of the interpreted word of the hour and every other voice must surrender to the interpreted word of the [Applause] hour the devil can anoint your emotions the devil can anoint your reasoning the devil can anoint your imagination there's one thing he cannot do and that is get in your soul you are a predestinated genan seed and the only thing that can get into your soul is the word of God and it stabilizes you friends you've got to realize you it's got to strike your heart the Revelation must anoint you who you are and you bring that mind and subjection to the word you bring your desires under subjection to the word you bring your emotions all of this little this and that and this and that you bring that subject to the headship of the word hallelujah there's a right thing to do things do there's a right way to do things right yeah that's right so many I don't know why I'm going here but so many people think that they're Justified to do something but there's a right way to do it yes and it takes headship to know how to do it well they're wrong and yet you go half cocked you go out of order and you try to bring correction and yet you think you're doing God a service but you're out of the out of the order of the word now brother brandom says we thank him for that what a comfort what identification what identification y'all see that that's my Lord what identification that's my absolute that is the correct interpretation of this scripture oh I am more glad to be identified right there than anything else in this world I'm so glad to be identified in that I don't know what to do I'd rather be identified in that than all the Baptists Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran and all the rest of them identified in that word with a shik glory and Revelation lace the pillar of fire appearing visibly Among Us identifying that the message is right like he did at Mount Si remember before the true message come forth Moses preached and he led them out of Egypt but there before the real Commandments was laid down the seals was brought in God come down before the people and prove that Moses was sent from him in a pillar of fire that Moses said he had seen in a bush and talked to him oh in this last days to see that same Pillar of Fire right Among Us speaking the same word not only that but interpreting it by making it manifest and proving it is the truth see now the prophet of God would say that we've got the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication and now is coming to pass what Paul was said when I was a child I spake as a child but now I under I understood as a child but now when I become a man I put away childish things you're becoming stable you see God Reveals His word in his own predestinated season on he says how could the Catholic Church know Martin Luther's message how could John Wesley know uh Wesley know the Pentecostal message or how could the Pentecostals know this message he reveals it in his Seasons because it is a seed and as it grows and matures he reveals himself now Jesus would say in Luke 12:42 and the Lord said who then is that faithful and wise Steward whom his Lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season the prophet of God would let us know what we are eating and who we are eating in this due season he says the son of man is Christ he is the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man so the son of man the revealing of the son of man is Eagle's food and it's the food it's the diet it's the bread that has been broke for the bride spiritual food and due season that is establishing you it's establishing your heart it is dictating your mind it's dictating your desires it's dicta it is headship now the word of God is to be our covering it's headship it's our protection and Paul said we are to be we're to have the whole armor of God ain't that right now we believe that Jesus Christ has broke the curse of sin off of Our Lives He restored us back to what Adam lost he he he's redeemed Adam's Fallen human race he's restored us back to being Sons and Daughters of God now when Jesus came he came preaching the Jubilee year you see everyone that is in captivity can go free amen he would begin to say he's anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the Blind and set at Liberty to them that are bruised but you see there's another portion of that scripture we'll find it in in in Isaiah 61 and it says to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness they shall be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord H I just want to say briide tree you don't have to be in mourning H you don't have to look at the ashes of the past uh you don't have to have a spirit of heaviness uh you are of another anointing an anointing of beauty an anointing of oil of Joy an anointing of a Garment of Praise uh is because we've been stabilized uh we've been pardoned uh we are not going in the tribul we are not going in the tribulation we are not under judgment we are under the headship uh of the king of kings uh the wig judge uh the says you're pardon you're free uh you're delivered uh you have an absolute an anchor a TI POS tell that depressive Spirit to get away from you tell that LE ought to see a weary Spirit to get away from you you've got the Garment of Praise you've got the Garment of Salvation re voice the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready she's dressed in the pure word out of that pure word is coming out of that pure garment is coming the oil and the wine the stimulation of Revelation that you know who you are you know you're redeemed you know that you're saved you know that if you go in the ground you're not dead you'll come back up again you know that there's a theoy that is only 3 feet away it's in another dimension but we're speeding up that's clowing down and we'll step into it it's upon us it's upon us it's the oil of joy for mourning I know the devil keeps wanting you to look at your ashes yeah I know the devil keeps trying to get you to look at your past I know the devil keeps trying to destabilize you because you're looking at all the regrets and the devil keeps anointing your flesh and anointing your memory but I say he's a liar we are not under the spirit of of mourning we are not under the spirit of Ashes we are under the spirit of the glory of God the beauty of God is the Holiness of God and the Holiness of God is the holy ghost you've been born again You Are Holy you are spotless you never did it in the first place get that morning Spirit off now's not the time to cry now's not the time to Weep the joy of the Lord is your [Applause] strength than you've got a Garment of Praise right use it and every gospel preacher has got a responsibility to preach the revealed word of the hour and pour out the oil and wine upon the people to stimulate their hearts to believe in the absolute to believe in this Deliverance to Believe In This Joy to believe in this Rapture to believe for for them and their family I'm about to explode it's real friends that's the anointing that we're under we're not trying to get under it we're under the headship of this message the problem of it is it takes Faith to step out and whack some devils on how long you going to sit there and allow the devil to talk you out of your inheritance how long are you going to just sit at the foot of the mountain and say I know Moses gave it to me I know the prophet of God gave it to me children gather around that's a mighty mountain right there it's a beautiful mountain that's our inheritance but there's Giants on that mountain there's wall cities on that mountain and as long as you don't get some Gump about you and take the word of the hour and pull your sword and go take that mountain those Giants are going to laugh at you they're going to mock you they're going to scorn you but I say Caleb it's time to pull your sword and say that's my Mountain I've got the strength to go out and I've got the strength to return I've got the oil of Joy I've got the oil of Praise I'm Anointed with the oil and the wine I'm stimulated by this [Applause] absolute it's time to drink it up it's time to swim in it it's time this don't have a bottom to it it's the Eternal Waters of life it's time to get down in it it's time to do some backstrokes it's time to dive in it it's time to breathe the clear fresh air of the Holy Ghost and allow the joy of the Lord to return to the church I don't care what someone did yesterday and you shouldn't either there's a right way to handle things and there's a wrong way to handle things and there should be a love of God being poured out from the members of the body and there should be healing flowing through the body because we've come to maturity we've come to a we come to a revelation how to handle [Music] things tired of all the back biing well I better stop it it's anointing strong you see the Holy Ghost is the dissolver of doubts what we are preaching is a perfect cure for sin sin is unbelief it's a perfect loosing I tell you what the Holy Ghost doesn't want any more of blown Breakers the prophet of God said blown fuses we got enough electricians in this church and I'm sure everyone else is caught up to some kind of science that we know what a breaker is you know when the light goes out and you know that if your husband don't know how to reset a breaker I've been I've been called to plenty of blown Breakers and you almost feel guilty about charging them for a service call you just kind of want to Tinker around a little bit something they [Music] go because someone was in the bathroom with a curling iron or something you know and just put two anyways where am I going come on buddy now the Holy Ghost let me just put it like this the Holy Ghost is tired yeah of blown Breakers blown fuses I've been called to those old or ponies full of them take the fuse out put another fuse you know and then you you're called and they they got a pile of fuses we redid it and we redid it and we redid it and we thought it would hold oh obviously it didn't now we got 10 fuses the Holy Ghost is tired on of the church just trying they've been trying for seven Church ages and the Holy Ghost says I'm going to bring this church up to an age that they can handle the word now the only way that you can handle the word is a heart of Faith that's why Malachi 4 says I'm going to return them back to the original faith and that's why Revelations 10 said there's seven unknown Thunders that is going to speak in the end time and that's what's going to be revealed through that Mighty angel coming down with an open book The Seven Thunders is not a mystery to us any longer the seven Thunders is the word that's turned us back to the original faith of God so no excuses no excuses for blown fuses we've had a master we've we've had a master electrician we've had God himself self step in on the scene and say hey guys we've got a direct short your Creeds your interpretation that's what in that's what Creed is it's the it's the wrong interpretation and Jesus said by your Traditions you make the word of God of none effect I tell you why you can't have joy I tell you why you can't see Deliverance in your home you've got a direct short you're not believing the word you're not allowing the word to be the absolute to stabilize your life you're going after this you're going after that you're allowing your senses to go haywire and you're not coming submissive to the word we've got not the answer don't worry I'm preaching to myself we've got the answer now brother Brandon says the problem of it is it's grounded and we got blown fuses he says you know the prophet of God says what You' done is through your tradition your interpretation that's what the prophet of God said tradition is interpretation says through your interpretation you've made the Commandments of God of no effect the prophet of God would say Commandments is the promised word of the hour I know a lot of people try to make Commandments law but the prophet of God showed us Commandments is the promise of the hour so by your interpretation of scripture you are making the promise of the hour nonaffective Ive and the prophet of God says and through our Creed we have disassociated the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit to anoint the word of God that's laced out for this generation now I'm just showing you what we've been called out of then if we've been called out of it we should be called out of it you see the prophet of God in the greatest battle ever fought he says if we could just get that certain thing fixed he's talking about the greatest battle ever fought he's talking about all of your senses he's talking about your human mind and he said if we could just get that Faith problem fixed oh God just don't do that today if we could get that certain thing fixed oh I went through the prayer line but I don't know it may just happen another year or so if we could get that certain thing fixed well I I don't know if it's God's will for my life if we could get that certain thing fixed if we could just surrender to the absolute of the headship of this message and get that unbelief out of our hearts the prophet of God says right now church if we could be put together and knitted with such that every person would be in one Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere there would not be be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes there would not be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed you see what the prophet of God is showing us that the Holy Ghost wants to have a flow if you turn the switch on we want the light to come on don't we if we turn the PA system on and you step behind this mic and you start talking and there's nothing coming out there's going to be a problem isn't there you see when you've come to the revealing of the son of man God wants something to happen the power has been turned on the connection's been fixed a prophet has come the Divine interpreter of the word has come he wants the current flowing freely he don't want you getting in the way he doesn't want my feelings get in the way he doesn't want my Petty ideas getting in the way he just wants freedom to flow freedom to manifest freedom to heal freedom to deliver freedom to touch your mind freedom to bring you Joy Joy enough to dance Joy enough to shout Joy enough to get those sleeves putting together and clap for the glory of God he wants the freedom if he says speak speak if he says be silent be silent whatever it is he wants to move freely because he says the works that I do shall you do also now oh my goodness where does time go we're expected to to be tested do I have a little bit more time I know it's the last service and I'm probably should be quitting I just want to get this part to you you see we're we're expected to be tested and the prophet of God would show us that the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to us now he's going to take us back to the Garden of Eden and he's going to show us in the God of this evil age he says we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan are you still with me she is not like Eve talking about you and me that she is not that type of a woman that will commit adultery with against the word and she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word and AD Adam's bride believed every bit of the word oh listen all the word but confused on One Promise what is that promise that he's the same yesterday today say with me today say with me today there's the test there's the test we've got to come back around to the same test to prove to Satan in his own Eden that we will not be like Eve we will not put the word in history and we will not put the word in a future tense the bride's Revival is a present tense revelation of the word made flesh sis God can do great things in your life right now you don't have to put it off in the future young people masas and daddies claiming your children you don't have to start confessing it when you start seeing some kind of an Evidence speak that word confess that word he's the high priest uh over your confession claim itth speak it stand for it it'll stabilize you speak you're healed uh even though there's not one result uh but speak ith speak I uh speak it uh confess it uh whack that devil do it with joy do it with praise do it with Jubilee today he's God today he's healer today he's delivered you today he's filled you today he's raptured you today you're the bride today now we're understanding what it's all about now we're understanding why the battle that the God of this evil age who is interpreting the word keeps trying to interpret the word to you like he did in in the Garden of Eden when he interpreted the word to Eve and talked her out of her god-given rights if you'll do this you'll become a God and she already was if you'll do this your eyes will become enlightened and her eyes were already enlightened and her eyes were closed to the things that it need to be close to quit allowing that devil to open our eyes to a whole bunch of unbelief well I'm preaching quit allowing the Devil to interpret this message and you open up your mind to a whole bunch of hogwash there's one thing you need to believe that's where the oil and the wine comes from and that is the stimulation of the son of man anointing the revealing of the word get in this message your pastor preaches the message stand for it listen to it study it swim in it swim in it swim under this anointing we're not under a Pentecostal shuck we are not under a tassel anointing we are under an eagle anointing it's time to get caught up in the advancement of the word it's time to swim we've come in advancement there's nothing greater than the headship hall there's nothing Beyond intelligence and we have come to intelligence quit trying to add to it and don't take away from it but say what that absolute says it is the oil and the wine [Applause] if God needs to add anything in your life outside of this message he'll do it when he returns that's direct scripture that's exactly what scripture said and that's exactly what the prophet said you preach this message it's the oil and the wine and if there's anything that needs to be added to it he'll do it when he returns I feel bold as a line I got to be careful come on come on come on Budd that's good but confused to one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever today but fa on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face don't tell me that you are facing the devil face to face in this hour come on face to face but you see this is the thing you've the prophet of God says we are coming in contact with the same thing and you must believe every word that's right there was the test in the in the beginning to believe every word and it was Satan in a person of an animal called The Serpent that misinterpreted the word to her and was lost it must be every word in the middle of the Bible Jesus come and said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word when he was tempted by Satan the prophet of God showed us that it was the same exact Temptation right and he would tell us it's the L I'm just thinking of this it's help me out with this lust of the eyes lust of the Flesh and the pride of life exactly what John said in first John the lust of the flesh the lust of the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and Jesus stayed with the word if he would have left the word one iota then it would have there never would have been Redemption and the prophet of God says the God of this world will rise up in this last days and whosoever shall add one word to it or take one word from it his part will be taken from The Book of Life you see Satan is trying to Blind our eyes the prophet of God would show us are you are you still with me I Satan is show brother brandom is showing us that that he says the reason that he's that he's got schools raising up he's got hospitals raising up he says there's nothing wrong with hospitals there's nothing wrong with these things he said but the problem of it is Satan is inspiring these things how many can say Amen to that that's all we're looking at today Satan just inspiring everything and you know what he there's a purpose behind it the prophet of God says that he is trying to Blind your eyes to what God is doing today he said preach the gospel and the gospel is manifesting demonstrating the power of the Holy Spirit he says he keeps you from seeing the true Revelation and Faith of God's word being revealed and Vindicated today today by his schools libraries literature hospitals and so forth he keeps you from it he is now interpreting as he did to Pharaoh trying to keep you from seeing the meaning of the Vindicated word of his promised age in the evening light Vindicated and proved he has tried by his knowledge in schools and better better educated people and ethics and so forth to keep you away from seeing that anything anything so that you won't look at that and see that's Jesus Christ how you know it's Jesus Christ he is the word and he's the word of this this age he'll tack any dirty name he can on it he'll call you H roller or anything else he'll call you be El abub all of these things but you see he's trying to keep you from seeing the real meaning of the word he is interpreting it saying it means this don't you tell me don't don't tell me that he's not trying to interpret this message that's right when God's already interpreted it come on but you see the prophet of God would say he said the Antichrist would rise raise up and would almost deceive the elected if it was possible but said let them alone let them go ahead their Folly will be found out why the word test proves it you see what was Jesus manifested for to show God to reveal God now Jesus so seen it now let let let's just look at this the prophet of God says today he wants to get somebody that can see it oh Satan's trying to keep you from seeing it but God are you with me now Satan's trying to keep you from seeing it but God is trying to get you to see it now notice Jesus so seen it was so perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made he was God's revelation God revealed now he Sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed closing with this look at the Temptation we can go back to the Garden of Eden and they begin to reason these things what what was the what what was Satan trying to talk into she he was trying to talk her into becoming like God it was identity he was bringing her into an identity crisis but you see it was because she left headship somehow or another she wandered away from her head and Satan blinded her eyes to the reality of who she was look when Jesus was 12 years old and Mary and the and the Mary and Joseph and all the relatives went three days journey and they realized they didn't have Jesus look look when Jes when they came back and they found Jesus discussing with the teachers the the Pharisees and look her testimony was that he is conceived of the Holy Ghost that's been her testimony all of these years and there under the test she denied her own testimony she became ashamed of it before all of those false interpreters yes sir she caved under the pressure and she said your father and I have sought thee with tears notice Jesus at though young the word though young spoke up the prophet of God says the word correct the error says don't you know I must be catch this I must be about the father's business and the prophet of God says the father's business if he was of Joseph he would have been in the carpentry shop but the father's business was to manifest the promised word of the hour now fast forward and Jesus full of the Holy Ghost he's now on the mount he's he's he's in the wilderness he's being tempted of the devil but look what it's over look what the Temptation is over if thou be the Son of God prove it that's exactly where the devil tries to tempt every single one of us prove it prove it you're healed prove it you're going to the Rapture prove it he'll bring every memory he'll he'll he'll anoint your memory like never before prove it he'll try to make you feel like you're a pig when you're when when every one of your sins have been put in the God's forgetfulness and you have been delivered of those things but you see the prophet of God says the de that that that that that Jesus would not proposition with the devil he would he he knew Satan's tricks he knew he was trying to reason with him and Satan just and Jesus just kept taking him back to the word if thou be the Son of God do this the word if you're the Son of God do this back to the word if you do you see he's showing us how to combat the devil's interpretation of scripture he's trying to he's trying to get you uncomfortable that you deny your identity I don't care you don't have to prove nothing to the devil you see sat Jesus had the answer the word come on the word was correcting you see he even tried to interpret scripture and look Jesus knew he was taking it he was misplacing scripture taking it out of context so he put it back in context with another scripture now again it's all identity the prophet of God says I'm talking about the headship of Christ catch this now I'm getting ready close notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question amen oh you say you're the bride oh you say you're healed oh you say you're delivered oh you say you're going in the Rapture yes sir but being identified by the original headship what is that headship the prophet of God says we have the devil's answer we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and has paid the price and has raised up as the head over the body or has raised up the head or the body the devil can't stand it that's the reason these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his wickedness his scheme has been uncovered by the Risen resurrected Christ in the headship over his body Glory you think I'm beside myself I'm not we've got the devil's answer not me that liveth but Christ the word living in me it's not my idea it's not my idea I didn't come up with this I'm not the one that said you're The Virtuous sinless spotless Justified as if if you never did it bride of Jesus it's not my idea it's his I'm going to go back to last night before there was ever a th on a fish's back there was a water for that fish to swim in and before there was a word a revealing of the son of man there is prophecy concerning you for this last days and you are the Fulfillment of the word that you can believe in headship that you can take the devil back to the headship of the word and say that's my answer that's my answer that's my identification don't take it up with me take it up with the revealed word of the hour I don't have one word to say to you [Music] [Applause] devil you're not going to get me to disbelieve it you're not going to get me a question it take it up with [Applause] headship not me that liveth but it's Christ the word if thou be the bride oh you're the bride but you see I'm anointed to believe this I've honestly tried not to come on come on you say brother jonan why would you no I've got so weak I've got so discouraged I know what it is to be a young person I remember I remember staying with my brother's house when he lived over there on Timber Lane I can take you to the very spot that I told God I quit I can't live it I'll take you to the spot I show you where I tried to quit on God but God didn't quit on me it only took 10 minutes it may have and been sooner than that brother Bryce and I was pleading to God oh God forgive me I can't I can't quit you I love you there's something within me I just had to believe it I've just got to believe the message I've just got to believe this is the answer for every problem every marriage every depression every sickness every discouragement everything that you're facing in life is the answer to the ashes of the hallelujah it's the answer to the ashes of the past it's the oil of joy to restore your marriage it's the oil of joy to bring love back into a family it's the oil of Joy To Men broken hearts it's the oil of the wine of stimulation hallelujah it's what God's done for us God's did this God did this for you [Applause] friends musician I'm about to I'm about to run through that wall some musicians come hallelujah it's the same test you're facing the same test that Eve did in the garden the same test that Jesus did in the wilderness and the prophet of God would say it like this you are anointed by accept what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept see how that H breed conditioned again just exactly what he done Eve he told Eve don't you do this and don't you do that and you can do this and that and Satan said oh you know but she turned around and listened to him but the Eve in the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it before there was a water to swim in there had to be a fin on your back to believe the message uh you're predestinated to swim you're predestinated for the revealing of the word to be made manifest in your flesh Anointed with the oil of joy and gladness you're Anointed with a Garment of Praise don't you see why Satan's Eden is going insane You're the Reason Satan is throwing the biggest fit that he could ever throw because you won't believe his lies you won't accept anointing you won't give heed to his seducing Spirits so he's got politics he's got the Nations he's got Hollywood he's got your friends he's got your neighbor he's got plenty of churches but he can't have you I'm swimming I'm swimming I'm drunk I'm drunk on the stimulation of Revelation it's Joy BS it's the joy of the Holy Ghost that is buping in my soul it's a geyser it's an inexhaustable Fountain I can't get enough of it it's just flowing it's my Rapture it's my peace it's my soundness it's my marriage it's my family it's my church it's Christ Christ the anointed word made flesh we're striking the final climax we've come to our absolute we've come to the third pole the opening of the word and it's brought forth a faith that will Rapture the church into glory and she is laying in the messages for We Are really at the end time brother Matthew we're laying in this message we're ripening brother Sean we're ripening we've got that we've got that sheath waving it over the congregation it's not a dried old dead tradition No Effects it's a bloody word that has the oil and the wine and it's for the people it's for people that are hurting it's for people who's been wounded it's for the people who who Satan keeps anointing their minds and trying to tell them you're not going to make it you're going to lose your marriage you're going to lose your home and I'm telling you if you go contrary to God's provided way you may lose your marriage you may lose your home are you with me but for the real believer for that real believer sold out I don't care if the devil rack wrecks your home you're stable because I am the god that will restore God I'm standing on your word I believe your word I I'm not allowing any negative to come out of my mouth I'm guarding my heart cuz I need to see you move that's that's the real thing that we need not a 10-step program amen it's not just coming to your pastor over and over and over half of the time people don't even listen to what your pastor says anyways but you see what does the Holy Ghost say if you really want it will you surrender to headship will you come under the absolute I'm not the absolute these brothers aren't the absolute but they're preaching the absolute they're preaching the oil and the wine is for Comfort oh come on it's for comfort you got to let him Comfort comfort you quit fighting the comforter we get so So Satisfied in the Blues we actually want to stay in the Blues but friends you're predestinated to come out of it get get come get tired of being tired H get tired of depression get tired of the Blues get tired of people feeling sorry for you come on over where there's Deliverance come on over where there's the oil and the wine the joy of gladness come on over where the Holy Ghost is comforting your heart amen quit quit oh we got to be mature quit sucking your thumb amen it's time to quit being babies it's time to handle the word I'm talking about you boys I'm talking about you you you over here you girls I'm talking about the Church of the Living God it's time we're putting adoption off in the future it's time to be mature it's time to allow the sunlight to bake all the greenness out of us great just bake all of your ideas break all of your teaching break all a mama's ideas out of you it's time to be mature is that all right you're being faced with the same Temptation we can look back at brother Brandon's day and say yes I believe that we can look off in the future say yes I believe that but what about today can you say you're healed today thank Lord can you say you're going in the Rapture today we're just drinking we're not trying to push work anything up we're just drinking we're just swimming push out drink drink drink swell up SW oh our heart just swells up swells up SW and it just pushes out love joy peace gladness one minute you're one day you're were this way and everyone was so worried about you but you come in contact with Christ and that he anchored you stabilized you and all of a sudden just in a moment what happened changed friends that's what we need that's what we need I've seen people go to counselors for years and years and years and never change and they've always got an excuse I don't know why I'm here there's always there there's always an excuse but why not come with a real heart say Lord I'm tired of the [Music] ashes you're the anointed Messiah you've come in this day you've come to replace my my ashes with beauty you've come to take away that old depressive spirit and give me the Garment of Praise you've come to deliver me out of the prison house then I refuse I refuse to stay there you know what the prophet of God says then you've got to start acting different takes Faith you can't just say you're a Believer and then just continue on that's right but your Works testify of the Revelation that is in you we got to preach these things [Music] because this is the answer we're we're we're looking for some answer and yet the answer is the word but you got to allow the word to have effect in your life and then the prophet of God says before you see one evidence of your healing you got to testify I'm Healed I'm [Music] Healed you you you you you got to change your countenance I'm not depressed I I refuse that Spirit of depression is not going to rule my life any longer I am under the Vindicated word of the hour and that word says that I am no longer under depression I am under the spirit of the oil and gladness of the Holy Ghost you see you can be identified with whatever you want to but for me I'm under headship and headship says I've got a Garment of Praise oh I know sometimes we're human but that's why it's a battle [Music] are you with me do you understand what I'm saying it's a battle you got to fight against those things fight against those demons that are trying to torment you fight against those things that are trying to bring you down resist the devil and he'll flee from you go ahead Kobe praise the Lord oh I will praise the Lord oh will praise the Lord no matter what tomorrow breae what it have [Music]
