our song of Praise as brother Joel gets ready to come amazing grace shall be my s of praise for real it was Grace that b My Liberty thank you Lord I do not know just why he came to love me so but I'm

have looked like to the world he wasn't worth nothing but he saw that seed that was going to become something one day aren't you thankful for the grace of God in your life I'm thankful for the grace of God you can be seated for a few moments I just want to greet you if it's okay and I enjoyed that song brother Wendell I I threw that on him I I I thought about that song My Aunt Tracy sitting back here I I don't mean to tell this publicly you might get jealous but she gave me a song book it's a Henson song book and it it was signed by Kenny Henson and several of the other Henson and uh and I opened that book and I saw that song in there and I thought of brother wendle if anybody can sing it brother Wendell can you know that's a Kenny might have died but the voice didn't leave and so I I I love to hear your pastor sing and over at our meetings he preaches you know once or twice or whatever however often he preaches there but he sings sings every night you know two or three times a night so we we wear him out on singing he probably he probably sings for more hours than he does preaches over there but but we we love brother Wendell are do you love your pastor love your pastor he's meant a lot to me personally he told you this morning I come out of a a tape background where we didn't believe in Ministry we would go here I'd go hear ministers I went and he heard brother Wendell that's how I got to know him but we didn't really believe in ministers that we didn't believe the importance of the fivefold and uh brother Wendell you know he he treated me like I was his buddy even though I didn't like preachers and I I'll say this your pastor has a heart of gold for people he loves people and I I don't know that I've ever felt that from anybody like I have from Brother Wendell and part of the reason I would say I'm standing here tonight I know it's all God's grace but but he puts men in your life that that really influence you and that's what brother wendles meant and I I'll say this I don't see my wife in here she's probably in the nursery but uh you know we've we've had a lot of experiences here at this church in this building that don't make the building special but but it's a special place for us my wife was here at your meetings in September and uh brother Jonathan had preached that night and he preached uh on once more I believe is the name of the title sermon sermon that night and and at the end of the service that wasn't prayer line night but my wife walked up up she had been diagnosed with Alpha gal I don't know if you know what that is but it's a it's a tick bite and and she and she'd got it in her blood and she just broke out all over just red spots all over her body and when she would eat certain things uh and they told her that they diagnosed her with that and said you can't eat pork you can't eat beef anything that's got a hoof you can't eat it and so you know I we didn't we just kind of accepted it we didn't know what to do and so we come to the meetings that was about the beginning of August we come to the meetings and and that night when she come up uh she said I she said I just I I want my healing and she stood right there and she she left the building that night and went a pulled pork probably some of yours she went and ate that pulled pork that night she said I'm claiming my healing she said I don't I'm I don't care what the doctor said she ate the pulled pork no reaction she's ate she from then on she hasn't had any restrictions and has had no outbreaks not one not One symptom we serve a great big God he still does Miracles I tell you you say well how do you know because I I've seen it work in my family right here in this church I tell you you serve a big God don't ever let the devil tell you that a little church in py Oklahoma doesn't have a purpose it had a purpose in our lives I say keep the keep the fires burning in py Oklahoma you may look like a small group here but you're mighty in the power of God and and and so tonight I want to just say I appreciate brother Wendell in this opportunity I told him I didn't want to preach but I'd just as well hear him as anybody I know and so I I appreciate brother Wendell and but I but I do I I do take this very seriously I don't want to stand here and and take up all your time but I just wanted to say those things I felt like I I want to encourage you that's all I know to do and I love every one of you you've been you've been a blessing to me and and your meetings have just been have just been wonderful the meetings have been wonderful we had children we had uh uh two for sure that left your camp meetings that have been filled with the Holy Ghost and uh and they have changed it wasn't just the camp meeting experience but we've watched their lives at home and these are young people who they'd sit as far back as they could that they didn't want to participate in church they didn't even they didn't act like they wanted to be there but from from that time to now they're on the front row they're participating in church when you're preaching to them they're right there with you I tell you God's still God and God don't never change I believe it do you amen I I don't want to take up all your time tonight I appreciate my family for putting up with me and having me over and let's stand if we could for just a few moments and and that'll be all the singing I'm not going to sing tonight we already heard the best singer and I'm not going behind that so I uh I tell you what with Talent like that I'd never preach again I'd just sing but uh but I I I thank the Lord for every one of you if you if you have your Bibles just before we before I have you seated again can we do Revelations chap 22 and verse 17 just one verse there Revelations 22 and 17 very familiar verse there and if I could title this sermon to tonight I would I call it the spoken word authority and hope it's a blessing to you uh chapter 22: 17 Revelations it says and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is The Thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely and then if you could turn over to Mark 11 and verse 21 Mark 11 and 21 when you have it just say Amen I like to see your Bibles out even with the screens up that's that's nice Mark 11 and verse 21 and Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou cursed is withered away and Jesus answered answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt on his heart but Shall Believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatever he saith and may the Lord add His blessings to the word you could be seated I was just thinking on this thought a couple weeks ago back home and and it kind of come back to me today I I thought I I I thought you know we we we're not such a powerful people and I heard brother Wendell say we're a powerful church this morning we are so powerful but the power does not come from us ourselves it is it is not a fleshly power I think Samson experienced that Samson realized that the power had to come from somewhere else it wasn't it wasn't just in his own strength he thought well we can get rid of the locks and I can still defeat these Philistines no no what he had was a supernatural power and he could only have that power under the authority of the word and once he got outside of the word the power was gone and the authority is gone I'd like to say tonight you are a powerful people you are you are a people of authority but you lose that Authority when you're outside of the word of God so brother Brandon would say like this brother Brandon said as mortal being knowing that I have no power within myself well come on that's a prophet speaking now he said I have no power within myself I don't have power to stop you I don't have power to make any of these women excuse me women clean up and any of these men that's listening to this tape or wherever I have no way of making them clean up I'm powerless but I do have the authority of God's word as a servant to preach it and I'm Duty bound to that Authority and the preachers ought to say Amen it doesn't matter what what your opinion is or what you think but what the word of God says we are Duty bound to preach that word it doesn't matter you say Well it made somebody mad well we don't want to make anybody mad we don't want to run anybody off you know you want to you want to use wisdom when you can but but I'll say this if it's in the word of God we need to be a people that understands that the minister is standing there and he is Duty bound under the authority of God to say thus sayith the Lord you say well well the brother brandom had thus say no no you have thus sayth the Lord if you're saying what the word says see we we don't go off of thus sayith the lord well I I feel like this or or this could be right no that's not thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord is what he's already said in his word I can stand here and I can read this word to you I can I I can let you hear the word of God for our day and a minister can stand here under the anointing of God and you can say that's thus sayith the Lord because because he's saying what a prophet said it's a Vindicated word from a Vindicated prophet and so therefore that is thus sayith the Lord that is the voice of God to you you say well well God can't use that man well God could use a donkey God can use whoever he wants to if it's the word of God it doesn't matter the source it comes from the word of God is thus sayith the Lord and that is the voice of God to you it is not just on tape it is not just well come on somebody it's not just on tape but it is in the mouth of the bride and we will say what he said and we will do what he said to do and that is the voice of God today I'm not taking any anything away from a prophet I believe in a prophet I listen to a prophet I think we need to be listening to a prophet but that's not just where the voice of God is today it is in the bride because it says the spirit and the bride would say come listen that means you have a voice you have a voice I have a voice he didn't leave it all with one man because well I'll get there in a little bit I'm way ahead of myself but listen he has he has got a people in the land today who have a Voice come on somebody you have a voice voice the voice of God is in you you have ate the bookl you are an overcomer you are the bride well come on somebody if you are the bride then you have full authority of the spoken word you don't have to worry about what so and so says or what this group would say no it doesn't matter about their opinion it matters what the word of God has already said because if we or any another anybody else or an angel from Heaven would stand here and say something outside of the word let him be accursed but if we can say what a prophet said and do what a prophet said and just believe what he said and act on that word put it in action tonight and say I have the authority to cast out Devils I have the authority to walk on devils in my life let me tell you something that devil is trying to give you a complex that devil is trying to tell you you're not good enough cast that devil down you have the authority to cast out Devils you have the authority to walk on the heads of serpent what is it it's the devil that's trying to put those thoughts that you're not good enough and it's and your children can't be saved or it's too late well I've heard all those doctrines in my life but I'll tell you I heard a prophet say thy and thy house shall be saved and I've heard Ministers of the Gospel get under the anointing and preach what a prophet said and say in due season they're going to come back home well come on somebody this is an hour of restoration this is an hour when all things are coming back home I say if you're children are gone they're going to come back well where are they it don't matter how long it takes it don't matter how they come back but whatever means God would use they're coming back home I tell you you say well well we've got people in the church that have gotten cold well just lift them up in prayer and keep the word of God in the ppit and I'm telling you you'll see a church on fire again you'll see a church with Revival back in the I'll tell you what what we need is Revival but it's not something new let's revive what we already have that's what a prophet would call Revival a prophet would say take what you've got and revive that we don't need new gifts in the church well come on somebody we don't need a new preacher you don't need a new pastor what you need is to lift up your pastor pray for your pastor get behind the man and well come on somebody you've got a man of God that stands here and preaches the Vindicated word of God I say get behind him with all you've got and stand there at your post of Duty well come on now now you can you can sit there and get quiet on me but I'm going to preach to you for a minute this man of God was put here for a purpose and if you're sitting here you were put there for a purpose well come on now fulfill your purpose by being at your post you want to be under Authority be under the word of God and then you've got full Authority but when you get out of your position You've Lost Your Authority Moses had full authority to speak to the Rock he chose to Smite it and it kept him out of the promised land now brother Brandon would say Moses had had he said Moses was told to speak don't Smite it he said that meant speak see he said stay under your Authority you've got to obey what he says do but no man can do nothing in himself he's got to hear it first from God now where do you hear the word of God you can hear it from the tapes you can hear it you can read it in the word in the Bible it's a written word and there's a spoken word and there's another way to hear it that's coming to church and hearing your pastor here in the five-fold ministry bring the word forth and if they're saying what the written word said and they're preaching what the spoken word said then you can say Amen to it well come on somebody I think we get so quiet sometimes because we're scared of the man standing in the Pulpit don't worry about who's standing there if God has placed them there they have been placed there to bring the word of God to you because that is the program of God today the program of God God is not sit at home and press play you say well did you come out of a tape church I'll tell you I did come out of one I'll tell you I've seen the false doctrine of a tape only movement you just go ahead and forgive me for a minute but I'm going to tell you this I've heard you say what do you listen to tapes I listen to more now than I did when I went to a tape church I do I have a I I have a deeper desire for him now it was a form of godliness but I denied the power and the author of it and then when I realized this was a powerful word that could still have men of God stand and preach it with authority I then I realized this is a powerful message it's not a dead message where we have to go sit for two or three hours and just all sit there at a certain time in a certain place and say well you know this this is good you know hey we were blessed today we heard the prophet that was the token well come on somebody it's another Catholic dogma it's another Creed that has been raised up in the message just like a seven Thunders opinion there's a true seven Thunders but it's what a prophet taught about it there's a true third pole but it's what a prophet taught about it well come on now there's a true T Vision but it is not what you're going to hear out here today about him coming back and preaching well we don't need more preach from a prophet he already came with the full restoration of the message of the hour what we need is to say what he said leave your opinions out of it and go forward with your authority of the spoken word that's where my authority comes from I can only say what he said I can only preach what he said I can't take my opinion or take one quote and say well I like this quote better than that quote if I've got two quotes that I feel contradict each other then I better leave them alone until the Revelation comes to me it's not a prophet's fault that I can't understand it maybe it just hasn't come to me yet but I'll say it like this don't throw out those quotes don't throw out the one you don't like because that might be the balance you need don't well I'm just preaching to you I'm off my notes at this point but I want to tell you something Church you get a little bit depressed and you let anxiety get in your life and you let where you let little isms and things come in your life and you start believing things and you know that you know really aren't right and you start doing things and acting ways that you know just aren't right well come on now listen we all get cold yeah but don't stay cold don't stay cold you you you're going to have a bad day but don't let the devil keep you in the valley let that Valley be the place of restoration let the valley be the place where you're back on your knees and say Lord I need you again I need more of you that's the way it's got to be I need your presence back in my life I lost my joy but just as David was saved restore unto me the joy of my salvation take me back to the house of God take me back to where I've left my love take me back to the message of the hour to where I've left god well come on somebody I I tell you what we can sit there and we cannot say amen and we can look like well we can look like a bum on a pickle but let me tell you this what we need is to get the fire of the baptism of the Holy Ghost back in our homes back in our churches where we can say Amen to the word of God where you can pull on the gift of God You' got well I hate to embarrassing tonight but you've got one of the most gifted Pastors in the whole message right here in py Oklahoma you've got a man under the authority of the word of God right here in py Oklahoma he has taken the spoken word and he's preaching it he's preaching it all over the world but you have been you've been blessed to have him as your pastor but let me just go ahead and tell you something he can't do this on his own he needs people come expecting a move of God in this service he needs you to show up when them doors are open and pull on the gift of God it's hard to preach to a church that sits there and say well we've heard that before if you've heard it a thousand times if it's it's true say Amen to it back your pastor you don't have to back me so much cuz I can I can leave tomorrow but your pastor has to come here it's a labor of love that he stands here week in and week out and studies and preaches and and and I tell you what you're blessed you're a blessed people you're blessed to have a pastor that believes this message is his absolute he didn't come along and say well this message is good but this is my opinion of it no sir he don't want that in his Pulpit what he wants in this Pulpit is the message of the hour preached what he wants in this Pulpit is is Words of Life to go out the congregation and he wants to see you responding to it not just by saying amen but by your life you live on Monday morning he wants well I'll tell you what if you want to reward your pastor start witnessing to the people in this town if you want to reward your pastor I tell you what get your home in order Jo when you walk in those doors you start you can just feel the presence of God and you start well when the singer gets up here you just can't sit down no more well come on somebody you might as well have church cuz I'm not going to quit for a few minutes anyway what we need to do is get back to where the word gives us Authority the word has given you authority to say amen he sure has I tell you what he said it's like it's like telling the dog it's it's it's like telling that devil he said he said I go told told that dog sick him and he said that dog would go over there and and and and get that skunk I believe it was was the dog getting a skunk or aoon anyway I think it was a skunk he was telling that dog to sick him and he said the devil's the biggest skunk we got I tell you what I say if your pastor's preaching I say tell him amen sick him get after that devil get after that devil don't let that devil come in here chop his head off well how can I do it you've been given the authority to do it you can defeat that devil Yourself by The Authority that God has already given you in his word let's get on down here Jesus had been given all power but he couldn't do anything in himself until the father told him first can you say amen he said he had I tell you he had the power to come off of that cross but under the authority of the word he had to stay there because he had to lay that body down and in 3 days raise it up again that was what the word said to do he was Duty bound to the authority of the word it was God revealing himself manifesting himself the word manifesting itself in a body well come on somebody I tell you and so Jesus would go on to say in Matthew 28 Matthew 28:20 he was teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even un the end of the world so he didn't stay there he didn't stay on the cross it wasn't enough for him to fulfill that portion of scripture but now he's got to fulfill another portion of scripture I'm going to be with you even in you until the end of the world so he laid down his life and raised it up again in three days under the authority of the word and then he's got a well come on now I hope you stay with me for a few more minutes he said he said but then he had another portion to fulfill and under the authority of the word he would leave again he would ascended to heaven but he would send his power back and so that on the day of Pentecost they could receive a portion of his Spirit now now now brother Brandon would say it like this and brother Wendell mentioned this this morning I already had this in my notes but I'm going to say it anyway right all that was in God was poured out into Christ all that was in Christ was emptied out into the believer yes sir well come on somebody that ought to tell you who you are and the prophet of God would say if you could recognize who you are we would get out of here I think it's important that we know who we are it's important to know that we are not defeated and the fivefold doesn't have to sit down and shut up we are a powerful body we have the fivefold we have the well I tell you come on now we have teachers and preachers and pastors and evangelists what are they for therefore for the perfecting of the Saints and for the edification listen we are under the authority of that word if Jesus had to fulfill the word how much more do you have to fulfill that word well he fulfilled his part no you've got a part to fulfill you've got a part and he said all that was in Christ he emptied out into the believer the church he said God is with you though I am with you always even to the end of the world that's the Declaration of God's word that's what the Bible says and that's what I believe that's what a prophet says if he believed that I think I can too yeah I think I can say Amen to that I believe he said I believe it that's what Believers believe and I'm a Believer Amen brother Brandon would use illustration of the ocean he said if we have a spoonful of the ocean and we have then we have a portion of his spirit and it acts like him can you say Amen am if we only have a portion yeah now all the ingredients that are in the ocean are in the Spoonful yeah right yeah and so even if you only have a measure of Christ yeah you have a portion of Christ you are not the entire body but you are a part of the body and so you have all the power of Christ Christ in you under the word of God you have been given Authority you are not powerless you are not a people of defeat you are a people with full word Authority when the word spoke it you can act on it believe it come on somebody you don't have to well come on you don't have to sit there and say well what about me no just apply it to your life apply it to who you are apply the word to your situation and you have authority to overcome that situation well can you say amen amen Lazarus heard the voice of the Son of God and a man that had been dead four days stood up that was the voice of Jesus speaking to Lazarus now I would like to ask you what voice do you have in you all right oh come on all right if he had the voice of the Resurrection glory to God what voice is in you you say well who are are we we are sons of God we are heirs to every Divine promise we are a part of him you make up the the the body that is on earth now he has no hands but your hands he has no feet but your feet he has no voice but your voice that's it we don't put it all back on a prophet we have been given authority to speak the spoken word in our day so we say what a prophet said and with full Authority we can overcome Devils with full Authority we can cast out Devils with full Authority we could raise the dead where where do we get that Authority he did it and we will be doing the same thing he did I don't care if it's been dead 4 days or 10 years well come on now if God told you to go speak and raise a dead man then you can take your Authority and go down there and raise the dead man now we don't go down there on a Feeling we don't go down there on an emotion but we go down there on the word of God we go down there with full author that's where our Authority comes from it doesn't come from your pastor it doesn't come from the Evangelist it doesn't come from my pastor but it comes from the word of God and if he's saying what a prophet said and if I'm saying what a prophet said if my pastor's saying what a prophet said we are speaking as Oracles of God and we have full authority to say what he said brother Brandon would say this and I love this quote I've always loved that Jesus had all the fine qualities of God in him he said Do you believe it church can say Amen to that he had powers upon Powers but when he met Satan he never used his power okay he give an example for the weakest of Christians come on buddy that's any one of you I love it he said he give an example for the weakest of Christians when he met Satan he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that predes out of the mouth of God the weakest Christian can stand can take that stand hold it he said he said sure it's God in his word every time when he would meet the enemy he said it is written if Jesus could meet the enemy on it is written how much more can we said Jesus said it is written Malachi 4 a Vindicated Prophet would come he said he said I can stand here and preach the gospel he said I could pray for the sick well come on somebody I tell you you have more power and more Authority than you think you got you are not a powerless people but you have been given full Authority Under the spoken word of God because whatever he would speak you can speak brother go on he said he said ' I believe he had power to do it yeah but he met Satan on the same grounds with the same word that you could meet him with everyone it's written yeah everyone every word every word I I tell you I think we're living below our privileges brother Brandon would say there's resources that we haven't even tapped into yet there are I I tell you we we have never really reached our full potential if we're still down here fighting with one another well come on somebody we're still down here letting our complex divide Fellowship we're still down here letting the devil get in between us and cause us to have odd against our brother well come on somebody if we're still down here living like the chickens in the Barnard I think it's time we listen to Mama eagle and say I'm ready to get out of here I'm ready to fly higher than living down here where I'm living don't live below your privileges you don't have to live below your privileges you've been called to come up higher now some of you may still be living down here here trying to follow a chicken or something but I believe if you're in this age you have heard the voice of the eagle and you have heard the scream of a prophet saying come out of her my people be not partakers of her plagues come up higher live like you know how to live live with the authority of the word live under the anointing of the hour I think it's time that as preachers get ourselves out of the way and preach and let the anointing of the fire of God speak through usen I I don't think we need to stand up here and start preaching our thoughts and and start preaching what we want to preach no I don't want to come out here and say well I know about so and so I want to meddle no I'll leave the pastor and the pastor what I want to preach and tell you is the word said you are more than able oh come on down you are more than able you don't have to be sick you don't have to be fussing with one another you are more than able to defeat that devil that's trying to divide you you are more than able to defeat a devil that's trying to come into this church and cause complexes on the people well come on somebody you say well what about the pastor you know you can give him a complex by sitting there looking at him like that true true that's right yeah you think he enjoys preaching to people that don't like him up there what well praise the Lord I felt to say it and I did I'm sorry but if her hurt take it listen all right when we come in here somebody told me one time check your attitude at the door and I've tried to do that more often nowadays you know it's good you know work gets busy work gets hard if you deal with customers I know some of you you deal with customers and and that that gets you in a you know kind of a sour mood and and you're like well I don't even feel like going to church well go anyway yeah but I think it would do you real good yeah if on the way to church you'd say Lord if I did something or said something wrong forgive me I don't want to hinder the person sitting next to me from getting a blessing in church tonight I don't want to be the reason that God doesn't show up on my Pew tonight well come on somebody I don't want to be the reason I don't want to be the stumbling block for my pastor to preach with the authority of God tonight I don't want to be the reason he's looking out there and I'm sitting there and I'm and I'm mad at the Devil but he thinks I'm mad at him and and so now we've got complexes well I'm just preaching right now but I want to tell you something if we can make those things right be quick to repent be quick to forgive let's love one another and let the love of God which is a we've been given Authority to love one another did you know that you have authority to love one another you have no authority of a complex the Bible not one time says your complexes are blessed no okay cursed but blessed are the peacemakers there you go there you go that's true brother you're not I'm not going to be blessed walking around mad at everybody I'm not saying anybody's here like that but I'd say every one of us deal with a with a human condition every one of you do and you're going to deal with it until you're out of here but if we could just feed on the word of God and start loving one another come on and start really saying you know what maybe that brother didn't mean to say that maybe that sister didn't mean to say that see we have authority in the word to forgive we have authority to love that's good we have authority to be a peacemaker we have authority to live right we have authority to act right right we have authority to say Amen we have authority to raise the dead we have authority to cast out Devils you're a people of authority but what what are we doing we're using things that have no Authority we're going around and saying well I think your thoughts have no Authority yeah if they don't come from the word come on yeah that's it I got off my notes and I'm sorry brother R said I like the attitude of the Centurion he said we've just read it guess I better get this off I've got a few minutes left on he said we've just read it he was a man that felt unworthy as long as you're feeling Unworthy of the blessing you're asking you're pretty apt to get it all right well somebody ought to Said Amen to that if you're feeling unworthy sitting here tonight yeah look out you're about to be blessed if you're feeling Unworthy of the blessing you're asking you're pretty apt to get it but when you get to a place where you think God owes it to you that's when you're mistaken we're in debt to God God's not in debt to us we're indebted to God and this Roman he said Lord I'm not worthy that you'd come under my roof and and neither thought I worthy to come face to you in other words I sent your church to meet you and you and to ask you this question but I have faith I know that you're a man under Authority for I'm a man the Centurion talking I'm a man under Authority he said you don't have to come down to my house to put your hands on my servant you don't have to come here and say my prayer notice but he said be sure to get this Prophet said be sure to get this he said if I say to this man you go do it he'll do it and if I say to this man come here he'll come I'm under Authority and he said them who are under me has to obey me the Centurion talking and he knew that he was the son of God that's Jesus and he said that every sickness the Centurion knew he was a Son of God and that every sickness and every demon was under him and all he had to do is just speak the word not pray but just speak the word well come on somebody why cry speak you've already been given Authority speak and he said not just pray just speak the word that's all and he said it would have done he said he said because every demon would have to obey him he said you believe that tonight every demon will obey God it has to everything obeys God it'll obey you if you have faith every demon will obey you come on if you have faith you are a people of power and authority but we've got to use it and it's got to be according to the word outside of the word that's where we lose our Authority that's where we let the Devils come on us and cause us to be sick and say well maybe I'm just meant to be sick no you're not meant to be sick but raise up with your Authority from the word of God he said Joshua stopped the son is that true somebody said all things are possible with God nothing is impossible brother puts that in quotes he said but he said but nothing nothing he said uh he said but all things are possible to you also yeah you all things are possible to you also he said nothing impossible to them that believe all things are possible he said he brought it right down and made it you if you just know who God was well I'm afraid that the church doesn't know their Authority okay all right he goes on like this he said I have no power to heal I have no Authority when I re when I receive it from God to pronounce something God has done I have no power to heal I have authority let me reread that I have authority when I receive it from God now our Authority today still comes from God but what access do we have to God it's his word and his spirit and if his spirit's in you and you're feeding on his word then you I tell you what you are more powerful than you think you are a powerful people under authority of the word amen brother R talks about Samson I mentioned him a while ago told you I was ahead of myself he said Samson as long as he he said excuse me he said and like Samson as long as he could feel those locks hanging around it was all right when I see him moving Among Us like this I know he is here don't you amen that's what a prophet said is it important to have the spirit in our services it is it is it important to make him welcome in our services I say it is because when you see him moving around in a service when you see him heal people that come right up well come on somebody when I've seen him heal somebody it's important that I get here to where Jesus promised to meet me if he promised he's here and I have a need yeah and every one of you do yeah then is it important to come where he is it's important brother and we have authority to meet him here where two or three are gathered where two or three together in his name I am he's in the midst if he's here then we have authority to walk up and accept our healing amen we have authority this is the word of God to you that you have the authority you are a people of authority so when Samson felt the locks he said as long as he could feel the locks he knew it was going to be all right and I no doubt you've been defeated just like Samson got defeated no doubt you found yourself and you felt like the devil's had a hold of you and I tell you what I think we ought to cry out once more Lord once more restore your power back to me I may have went out and I may have sinned and I may have failed God I may have done things I'm not proud of but I say come back in the presence of God where all things are possible to them that Believe come back to where You've Lost Your Love come back to where you failed God come back to the house of God and say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word where the authority is that all things are possible to me my house is in a bad condition my family they're in a bad condition I say Lord restore unto me the joy restore my family to me you can speak as the Oracles of God you can speak with authority that everything that Satan has stolen from you is still yours you haven't lost nothing but the devil has tried to Bluff you and tell you well your children can't come back because they've went too far your well come on somebody your church can't on fire because they've just there's there's just too much between them right now there's no Unity I tell you what one service with the power of God in the church can bring Unity back between people one service in the presence of God come down it can cause people to love each other again it can cause Devils to be cast out a lot of times we're looking for the sick to be healed and the dead to be raised and we love it but sometimes it's just our spirit that needs to be changed some times it's our attitude that needs the healing true how do you know because I've been there and I I I every once in a while I still get there I get to the house of God and I I realize that everybody else is worshiping and I'm sitting there like what happened to me it's like you got a weight on your shoulders but do you realize he come to set you free you don't have to have that weight he has already taking your burdens so take them back to the Lord and leave them there I tell you what I think it's I I think it's time we quit doubting the word of God and use this word with full Authority use this word with the power that it was meant to be used in he said we don't need so much teaching all over the world but we need ministers preaching under the inspiration and the power of God I think it's time that we fulfill that commission and not just go around and try to say well let's get bigger churches and let's get more people no let's revive what we got and let you be the let you be the written Epistles to the world let's let you get on fire and watch the watch the community come back on fire well I tell you what you want your family saved you get so committed to God that you can't stay away from the church you get so committed to God that you love your pastor and you love your wife or your husband whatever the situation is you get so committed to this message and your family will see your commitment and your love and they'll want what you got I think it's time we quit trying to force them back and say I love you and I want to love you back to the kingdom of God a little bit of love will go a whole long way a little bit of love in a church will go a long ways a little bit of Grace toward somebody that's Fallen we'll go a long ways well I'm just preaching to you but you know what just a little bit of the word expressed in your life is the best testimony you can have believe it's not enough to say you believe a message I've been there it's not enough to listen to the message it's not enough to say well I I you know what I've listened to three tapes this week or I've listened to five tapes this week and I'm on a schedule of listening to tapes I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I it's all about them yeah true come on it's all about me yeah I I played a tape at a certain time I've got a literal tape as my token in my house beat that it's nonsense church we have the word of God that tells us what the token is we have a tape called the token all you have to do is go listen to it we don't have to take a man's opinion for what the token is you want to know what the Holy Ghost is we've got tapes on that you want to well come on somebody and your pastor will stand here and he'll say what a prophet said well come on now I I don't believe your pastor is a man full of mistakes I believe he's a man of God that preaches under the authority of God and the word of God well I why are you saying that because I think we're we're doubting the ministry so much thinking that they're just preaching their opinions all the time it tells me that you're not familiar with what a prophet said or you wouldn't sit on a man like that that's true come on now or you've let your opinion come in the way of the moving of God in your life because you think the church ought yeah you think the church ought to be run a certain way you think the pastor ought to be preaching a certain series I'm in so much trouble at least I can leave tomorrow praise the Lord listen to me I know it's funny but listen we we do we stop ourselves from a blessing all the time by putting Idols ahead of the word amen you can be an idol yourself you can make your life more important than the house of God you can make going to church secondary okay I'm not the pastor so I can say this I know the pastors they like to get up here and they they'll preach the word to you but they really don't want to run anybody off you don't have to leave on the account of me because I'm leaving but listen we we don't have to why why why should God ever have second place that's right when all of your Authority and my authority comes from him when you deliberately disobey the word of God you have lost your Authority you've lost your power we go back to Samson for a second and say this Samson had been called for such a time as he was in to slay Philistines and he could even he he didn't have to have a special weapon he just obeyed the word of God so he used what was in his hand that's all we've got take what's in your hand brother Brandon would preach a message on that all you've got if all you've got's Faith use it if all you've got's the word word of God if all I've got a sword use it all Samson would get was a was an old dried up Jawbone of a mule he had full Authority with that Jawbone that don't make no sense to science but it makes a whole lot of sense when you're under the authority of the word of God and but when he would flirt with the world I hope you hear me tonight I'm not trying to preach it anybody I I don't know you all that well but I'll say this when you start flirting with the world and you start saying well it's okay if I do this and it's okay if I do that and and just a little bit well come on now Samson hadn't even lost his power but when he when he gave away that secret which was what he was told by the word of God to keep he he he disobeyed the word of God and he was weak as any other man you are as weak as a drunk on the street without the power of God you are as weak as the lowest low down person in py Oklahoma without the authority of God in your life so do we want to go outside the word and try to be powerful on our own no sir we need God's Authority in our life and the only way to get there is under the spoken word of God for your day it has been revealed for this day it well it is not a man's idea it is not a man's opinion but it is the word of God for this day you have to come under subjection not to my opinion not to my idea not to brother Wendell's opinions but under the word that we are under you have to be under that word also it is an authority that you have been given now I want to read this out of the church age book and you may have already got there on your studies but brother Ram said notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed to him by by his father he quotes John 5:19 and and this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride I'll say that again the same Harmony between God and the son is now to exist between the groom and his bride how many's the bride in here tonight better put your hand up you better believe that you ain't getting out of here without being the bride I I'm not here for the tribulation I'm here for a Rapture i i i i the harmony that he had not my will thy will be done he didn't do his own will in the garden he didn't do his own will on the cross but he did the father's will he was under authority to the word he had to manifest the word the bride must manifest the word in this hour and to do that you've got to be in harmony with the groom and he said he shows her his word of life and she receives it re how do I know I'm bride I've received the word and I'm doing my very best yes I fail yes I'm in a body of Flesh yes I've done things I'm not proud of yes it's been a long road to get to where I am today but thank God he didn't leave me where I was thank God I'm not the man I was thank God that he took me out of a doubt and confusion State thinking I knew the truth out of a dead cold formal condition and is brought me into the Revelation that I am his and I have power it well come on somebody I have power I'm no longer just another tape boy I'm no longer just another uh just another tapeless but I want to be a doer of the word of God I have come under subjection to the word and I'm going to stand here and if a devil would come and say you know what that's a lie I'm going to stand there and say you know what it's not my will but his will be done not my will not my will not my word but his word be done in my life his word be done in your life it well come on now his word be done in my family his word I'm under subjection I'm under authority of a promise that if I will stay in the word of God I don't have to worry about my family I don't have to worry about my household because they're going to be there I tell you what it's just like leaving Egypt not one hoof will be left behind I'm taking everything that belongs to me every promise you know what Joy is a promise your family is a promise God has given you a promise and an authority of the word for this hour stay under your Authority Hall stay under your Authority brother man would say like this you thought I was done I'm getting there he said he said therefore nothing can harm her not even death can I say that again nothing can harm her not even death death can't take you out it can change your Dwelling Place but it can't take you out you say well we buried so and so we buried this one we buried that one no you they're not dead a Christian can't die they are just alive as you are well come on somebody a Christian can't die you can't die well I'm old you can't die you can't die because you have already conquered through him death hell and in the grave she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her I'd like to say it again not even death death ain't no big deal to a Believer it might hurt you but but when you know that just on the other side just a dimension away just a dimension away your loved one that you've lost is standing there waiting for you to come home why why why would we want to live outside of this word when that's a promise that we can have why would I want to live outside of the word when I can believe that if my children should well I'll say it if my children should go before me then I have a promise of seeing them again if I go before them they have a promise of seeing me again if the Lord carries and there's men of God who would leave this scene by way of the Grave we're going to see them again we don't have to worry about it because it's a promise and we're under authority of a res resurrection and a Rapture that's an authority to you that's authority Jesus was under under authority to the word you are under Authority as long as you stay with the word brother Bram said for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret to this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord amen not thus sayith Joel puit not thus sayith Brother wle Martin we can use any Ministry you want to there not thus sayith brother William not thus sayth listen to me if you're speaking the word of God it's thus sayith the Lord but it's not my words it's his words it's what has already been spoken I have no authority to speak on my own but I have authority to say what has already been said when the prophet said say what is said on tapes on the tapes he didn't say play what's on the tapes he said say it I am under authority to say what he said right I I'm not under Authority from headquarters I'm under authority of the word of the hour brother Bram said now we see in the Bible that Jesus Christ the son of God when he came to the Earth he came to rid rid sin and sickness and divorce it put it away for from his people and claimed that he would return again but in his absence he gave his church the same Authority that he had well where is he in you where is he in you where is the authority today in you well come on somebody that ought to make somebody shout you well i' I've heard it said that ought to make a presbyterian shout but I don't think it will but the bride ought to the bride ought to have joy knowing who she is the bride should have joy knowing that this message has come to to bring you back this that you have been presented to Christ already somebody said that's not true yes it is you've already been presented now I'm not talking about the literal Corporal body We Believe there'll be one of those brother Bram said Believers believe that but I'm talking about you've been presented to Christ the word in this hour there's been a word come that would well if you'll accept it it you have the same power that he had if you'll just accept it you have the same attributes of Christ in you you can do what he did you can say what he said you can cast out Devils just like he did you are a people of authority Amen brother R says Revelations 10:7 the days of the voice of the seventh messenger he's quoting the scripture that the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants of prophets we all know that he said there it is he is sending a Vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years he is sending someone who is so far from organization and education and the world of religion that's why wise people may not be able to pick this up but you can you are wise you are the wise men you've seen his star you've come but he said he said the world of religion as John the Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear only from God and will and will have thus sayith the Lord and speak for God he's talking about the seventh angel messenger and he will speak for God and he will be God's mouthpiece And he as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul I've always been read that part of it but they didn't read me the rest of it can I go ahead and tell you what he said he said he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manif EST the Lord and be his body and be his voice they all like to tell you oh yeah here's the voice of the Prophet you need to listen to it I do and he said that I had the voice in me to speak he said he said that the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works it those elect will knew that in the last days he said do you see it a momentary consideration of church history he said will prove how accurate this is you may have already read this in the church age book I'm not sure if you got this far but he said he said he will prove how accurate it is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word and the lutherans spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for the organization tends toward dogma and Creeds and not simple word yeah I'm thankful for simple word I'm not smart enough to understand some of these big words but I can understand a Kentucky hillbilly excuse what I I don't mean to I'm not being derogatory there what I'm saying is I thank God to use somebody that didn't come and speak over my head but he could speak just like a southern boy could speak and he could say things in a way that I could understand it he could well we don't want to make a mystery out of a mystery he come to make it so plain and so simple that he said you you can do the same works and if I understand him correctly he's talking about me God sent Wesley he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so has gone on through the years until in this last day in this last day somebody say in this last day last there is again another other people in the land well somebody ought to say that's me there's again another people in the land under their messenger who will be the final voice to the final Age and and listen he goes on the church is no longer the mouthpiece because the church he said it's they their own mouthpiece they and God has turned on her and he will confound her through the prophet and the bride and the voice of God will be in her Glory so are we going to put God back in 1947 or 1965 or 63 I know that was God's voice to the people I believe that was God's voice to the people he said I am God's voice to you but he didn't say I am God's voice and you need to know nobody else is is given this Authority and power no he came to reveal a living God to you so that you would not be like the dark agent and be left a powerless church with no God in your services and no God in the people but he said no he said Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever and if the apostles were told go speak go preach the word under the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost then a prophet would come and show you God is still God and God still does what he said now you young men take this message on to the coming of the Lord they're saying the same thing Jesus's last commission was telling you go into all the world and preach the gospel yeah and brother Brandon would say there's going to be young men take this message and preach it until they comeing to the Lord I accept the challenge yes in an age where the message in an age where the message is laughed at in an age where the message maybe there's not as many as there once was trying to follow this message but we don't need numbers we need need we need God so that we can be a people of authority I I it don't take but one man to have authority you do you do realize God deals with an individual he he may not take the whole church but he may be dealing with one of you tonight and say you need to accept your Authority in the word because you've been letting the devil steal your joy long enough you've been letting the devil get between you and that brother in the church long enough you've been thinking about yourself and putting yourself ahead of the church Church long enough I say thank you well Jesus never did anything for himself that's right he was always to going about the father's business doing what God told him to do with love and and he was going and doing the will of the father listen church I know in an age where the world has put a a pressure on us we're in a squeeze that that would make us to where it's almost hard to go to church because if you take a job that that you work on weekends you can make more money come on but is the money worth it in the end I I think we could go and ask the Rich Young Ruler was it worth it when he had the opportunity he was a man of good character but he couldn't follow Jesus I I think we've got good men and good women sitting here tonight but don't let the devil ever get you out of the word of God and try to get you cold on God because that will do nothing but steal your power and steal your joy and steal your children and well it'll steal the Holy Ghost right out of your life well you I know you can't be lost I know when you're saved you're saved but let me go aad and tell you this you can lose the joy of your salvation and you can absolutely get so cold and in a backsliding state to where you can't even work for God no more and you know God can't leave you like that if you're one of his you're going to have to go through a trial after a trial well come on somebody your life may get really hard for a while but let me go and tell you why not just walk in the in the blessings of God why not just tell that devil well you know what you're a bluff and you have no hold on me you have no power over me he's powerless he's already been stripped of his rights you have been given the rights of God I think we need to get ourselves out of our cold dead condition and realize that God is still God God is more than able to raise out I tell you what I believe there's a generation this is a generation that will not taste death I believe this is a generation that is going all the way way into the promises of God what do you mean by that I believe there's a promise of a Rapture and I'm looking forward to a promise of the Rapture I'm not looking well I tell you what I'm not going to be here when them bombs are falling and blowing this world to pieces you can stay here if you want to but I say call me gone because I'm going to believe it it may be in a moment of twinkling of an eye but I'll be gone oh I know you've heard it said before but some morning when we hear I tell you what we start seeing our loved ones together and they start walking around and you wh what's going on here oh look back to the scripture think about it this is just a promise being fulfilled and you are a promise being fulfilled here tonight why because he would have a people on the Earth under their messenger and you will be doing what a prophet said do you're sitting in the house of God when you could be sitting home and you could watch a basketball game or you could watch your TV and you well come on somebody you can sit at home and say well I can press play at home but you're under a authority of a prophet that said be at church every time the doors are open he said a Christian will be well you say my Ox is on the ditch well maybe he gave you Grace for that but quit putting it there quit putting your Ox in the ditch and say well H you know what we put we put a well we decided to take this job once just one Sunday a month it won't hurt nobody well I'm sorry buddy but let me go and tell you you have chosen money over the will of God how can you be blessed in that condition how can you be blessed I'm not saying you're not going to heaven I'm not preaching Anybody Out of Heaven but what I'm trying to tell you do you want the blessings do you want faith for your family do you want faith for a church to be on fire for God then you need to get in the will of God and be under the authority of the message of the hour I know I'm a little bit over my time right now but let's just close with this brother brandom says he said they were waiting in the upper room they they wasn't presuming they were not venturing without Authority they were waiting and they were waiting until the scripture was made manifest he said GL oh brother I wish it wasn't this late oh me too brother random how they'd like to stay there a little while he said they waited for scriptural Authority oh you want to be blessed like they were Pentecost wait under the scriptural Authority take your Authority you can have what they had under the authority of the word of God brother bam said once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the L of and age its Messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as he revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the benef will be will be the beneficient effect of that prophet's Ministry it's all on brother brandom you are the beneficiary of a man that came and gave his life for the gospel brother BR he he he quotes the scripture of 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come the corn of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground and I has come back to the original grain again word grain again excuse me he said praise God listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last stage what he says from God the bride will say what he says the bride will say so how do you know we're bride we don't want to say nothing a prophet didn't say we're not up here brother Wendell he was telling us this morning they tried to get him into that seventh Thunders uh there was some great preachers with gifts to preach in that movement there was men that could preach a house down in that movement brother Windle no doubt could have went in there with the gift that he's got and and been one of the biggest among them but but but he didn't choose Fame and money over the word of God how do I know he's a real servant of God he chose to stay right here in py Oklahoma he he didn't choose a bigger congregation he didn't choose the Finer Things but he has chosen the word of God you talk about a blessed man I don't care if he drives the nicest car or the nicest truck or lives in the best house in the message he's a blessed man why because he has stayed under Authority for this age he is you ought to be proud of your pastor yes sir a lot of men a lot of men would run after the money come on now 19 year old man you telling me he wouldn't run after the money I guarantee you you you telling me a man will stand up there and everybody leave his church he didn't want everybody to leave his church he didn't want to be be preaching to one person as great as you are he didn't want to just preach to one but that one is worth more than a church of 10,000 that don't know the message of the hour I'll take preacher to that one over preaching to a church like Joel O's I'll take preacher to that one over preaching to a church like TD Jak and Potter's house we got 35,000 people but there ain't one that knows what she knows she's under authority to speak what a prophet spoke there may be armies of Philistines come against you there may be armies of devils come against you but knowing what you know not one of them can harm you you or your family you say that's not brother Joel why are you telling her that because I'm under the authority of the word we don't need to get up here and start Discerning people that came sorry what we need to do is use the word let the word discern let the word tell you who you are let the word place you let the word say let the word say them devils are coming out of you let the word say your family's coming back I tell you you've been faithful over the little things you've been Faithful over a small group here in py Oklahoma but God has made you ruls over much you have been given the authority to preach this world word all over the world why because you stayed under authority of the word I say God bless brother Wendell I say God bless sister Carol sister fresa you stayed by him why I I'm not trying to butter them up they know I love them I tell them all the time is my favorite preacher I'm sorry you can disagree with me but outside oh listen I'm not trying to butter brother Windle up he's a human being we all are he he fights he fights I I I'm not speaking for him he he didn't tell me this but I guarantee you he fights the Devil he's fighting a headache tonight you think that's not the devil yes God didn't give him that headache he's fighting the devil Jesus fought that devil called a headache too yeah I used to fight them on a daily basis I thank the Lord I don't anymore but I still get them when I do it's hard brother Colby I'm with you it's hard to operate but he's sitting here telling the devil you can give me the headache but I ain't staying home you can I tell you what you can bind me to these pillars but just once more Lord Give Me That Power and I'm going to kill these Philistines again once more restore the power to the Church of God once more let me know that this word is a liive prove it alive in my life let me be a written epistle read of all men don't let me just be a hearer only of the word of God but let me be under the authority to do what he said to do and say what he said to say I don't have to just be a Halfway Christian I don't have to just be well come on now I don't want I don't want if I don't want fame I I ain't got nothing to be to be proud about but I'll say this I'm proud of the fact that God chose me when he didn't have to choose me he didn't have to love me he didn't have to di for me but he chose to do it anyway brother Kobe he chose you you didn't have nothing to do with it you didn't have nothing to do with be born in the Martin family but God before the foundation of the world knew that brother wendle needed somebody to help in the music department so he knew in a little town called py Oklahoma maybe there ain't going to be a lot of musicians at hand but he would raise up some of the best in the message why because in the weakness God has made strength God has made you strong God has given you Authority you say well brother Joel maybe things ain't going the way in the church we wanted to I say just let that devil go right on by and say thank you for stopping but we don't need you we are a people under Authority let me get out of here and and close my timer didn't do any good but tell me I'm late tonight I apologize brother brandom says this and he's praying so I'll close with this brother R's praying he says oh God how I could think when the church was on the move when Moses got a little scared down there at the sea he began to cry to the Lord and the Lord said why are you crying to me what are you crying for speak and go forward I wonder if we've been there before oh poor me Lord I don't know what's going to happen next well you've seen the miracles of god oh I haven't well you can look at one my wife's here tonight I I we've got proof we've got pictures of proof of her face that was solid red bumps and she had to go on a a diet of of of of of nothing but but but like chicken that's all she could eat and I tell you I was sick of buying chicken cuz I don't like chicken at home I want beef you know and we couldn't even cook it you know she didn't want to be around it but let me tell you something God who is rich in Mercy said you don't have to stay in that condition it ain't nothing I did it ain't nothing she did but it is God rich in mercy God was rich in his healing power on a Friday night of your meetings and I'm thankful I came you you said should we have those meetings are they doing any good well was it worth it for me yes it was worth it to come it was worth you putting those meetings on if nothing else I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for creating an atmosphere where healing can still take place thank you for creating an atmosphere where we have young people back home on fire for the Lord because they've been in an atmosphere that you people have labored for and that well come on somebody go ahead let that devil know where we stand tonight let that devil know where we stand tonight we ain't crying about it we're speaking and going forward I don't care about I you well some of you are saying what about this condition don't worry about your condition don't worry about your complex quit thinking about it cast that thing out quit letting that thing control you and let the authority of the word of God control your life quit letting it come between you and a brother and sister in the church I don't know why I'm talking about that but I want to tell you something I know as a message the devil's going to come in brother bandom spoke a word to the church and he said go the devil don't want to leave it like this he don't want that sweet little group to stay together he'll come in here and try to split you up oh you've got a wonderful little group here but don't you let that devil of unbelief come in here and try to separate you from each other if you start seeing that devil come in here you personally kick that devil out we're going to close musicians come but I want to tell you this brother Brom says he's still praying Lord God today I come in the name of the Lord Jesus I come yielding the sword of Faith claiming the Oneness of God and man by the Holy Ghost oh I think the church ought to think about that one for a second uh he said I'm claiming I'm claiming claiming the Oneness of God and man by the Holy Ghost and he said he said through the mercies and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ his son I defy every devil that's bound anybody in any way in this building is that the voice of God yes it is that's the voice of God to you if you're bound tonight you don't have to stay bound a prophet said I defy the devil that has bound anybody with any condition in this building anybody in any way that could be as bad as cancer or marriage problems all the way down to a headache [Music] all the way down to you young people I don't you don't know who to marry you don't know you don't know what job to get well I tell you this don't let a marriage ever come don't ever marry an unbeliever we've got Authority for that don't yoke yourself with that we've got authority to say I believe I can say this don't take anything that would keep you out of the house of God well don't take that job you think God's big enough to give you a job that can keep you in the house of God yes he is maybe quit crying about it and speak I don't mean listen I don't mean that bad but I think we're crying too much and saying the devil's done this and the devil's done that quit giving him so much credit quit telling that devil how much he's done for you lately we know he's on the job we know he's a good adversary but greater is he that is in you that he's in you the one that's in you is a god of authority it is a spirit of authority it is a word of authority brother brandom said just want to finish this prayer he said I defy every doubt if you're doubting tonight he defied that doubt I can say what he said I defy every doubt in this building tonight well I doubt that I've got that Authority cast that devil of Doubt out you are a people of Authority I defy everything that's ungodly come on [Music] now just think about it for a minute I don't know what's ungodly in your life you do if you have the Holy Ghost you [Music] know maybe you just got cold on God under the authority of what a prophet's saying right here I can tell you under his authority under the authority of God in the words of a prophet I can tell you I defy according to the word of God the ungodliness in your life did you know you can do that too I defy the ungodliness that would come up in my life I defy the unbelief that would raise up in my life I defy every devil oh somebody ought to be saying this for themselves you've got to defy that devil in your life I'm looking back there my aunt the other night she told me I don't mean to call you out but I want to tell you what she told me she said I don't want to be I don't want to be in a wheelchair the rest of my life you can defy that devil that's putting you in that wheelchair she's got a testimony of the devil took her farther than she wanted to go but she's [Music] [Applause] [Music] back Joel do you have a reason to be happy tonight oh I've got a reason to be happy I've got a wife that's been healed I've got a wife who found Deliverance in this church not just by healing but in her own life she found Deliverance about 5 years ago she come up here Bound by chains of of things that was trying to take her out and she found Deliverance here and she's never been the same [Music] [Applause] [Music] again I was standing I'm not bragging on myself you can put put yourself here I was in a prayer line at the meetings this year and I felt like I was no good I felt like I didn't deserve to be in a Pulpit no more I thought well well I ain't got I ain't got the anointing to preach maybe you've heard me tonight and you still think that's the case but God said otherwise there was a man of God got a hold of me that night he didn't know I didn't say a word to him he's your pastor if you must know I'm not lifting up the man but I'm telling you God spoke through him he didn't discern my heart but what he did was just prayed he told me you I'm proud of you sometimes you just got to tell somebody that they've been down they've been beat they're in trouble I'm proud of you I I knew where you I know what you were he knows what I was I tell you about seven or eight years ago I'd never see myself standing here I shouldn't have even had a friend in this message that would ever allow me to stand in their Pulpit but under the spoken word Authority he said young man take this gospel and preach it until the coming of the Lord I'm going to just go tell you something else I've never told your pastor and I've never told anybody else in this church my wife knows it we were here almost almost 3 years ago at your meetings you said Pon e is kind of a special place where you kind of is I was at a hotel and Cushing I believe it is and meetings the hotels were full and we kind of last minute we we usually stay with my cousin but that year we we stayed there and and a friend of ours paid my paid for my room that year he wanted to make sure we come Sunday morning we went down and ate break breakfast and a and after breakfast I went back up to grab my Bible and I had I had felt the call of God to preach but I wouldn't do it because I I really felt like we didn't need preachers no more I still felt that way I thought we got enough I was I was on I was on board with preachers but I just didn't think we needed anymore I thought we had plenty I opened my Bible and I I just read just a few scriptures I sat there on the bed and read it and it was the commission go you into all the world and preach the gospel and it touched me like it's never touched me [Music] before I put it I put it to rest I I Clos the Bible and I I started to walk out the room didn't mean anything to me other than I read it and I thought about it a little more I went to walk out the room out of the room and this ain't Supernatural this ain't vindicating me I I just want to say this for the glory of God he said just open your Bible again I just felt compelled not a literal voice just something open your Bible again I opened it and it was the same chapter wasn't book marked it was just the same chapter and when I looked down I read the exact same verse again I didn't think anything about it a month after your meetings my brother comes up to me on a Sunday afternoon an hour before service started he said I wanton I don't want to I want to ask you this again probably but if you got a sermon tonight's tonight the day before that I was supposed to work and I didn't work I never got called in they said we'll call you in the morning and tell you where to go they never called me I I sat down and studied and prepared a sermon as if I was going to preach the next day and had no idea that I would be I'm not saying that to glorify myself I'm saying God can take somebody who don't want to be here and I'm under the authority to say what he said maybe he wanted to get a witness out of a group that didn't believe in Preachers no more that God can raise up out of that and so I can stand here and say God has men of God Anointed with this message to preach the word of God today and I've I've been I've been privileged to stand in this meeting with men of God I've been privileged to stand here today behind a Pulpit of a man of God I'm a blessed man but I'm under the authority of the word of God why are you preaching because the word of God Amen why are we doing what we do because the word of God brother brand says this and I'll and I'll give it to the pastor he said May the power that made us one with God how can that devil squawk himself around the anointed oh think about that how can that devil squawk himself around the anointed how can the devil stand out there and squawk himself like a Goliath when David come into the camp and said you mean you let that uncircumcised Philistine stand there and defy the armies of the Living God he said oh God make men and women rise in the power of the spirit and let that unconverted that dejected devil that's harmed the human race down through the age stand here and divide the church of living God he said Satan come out and leave in the name of Jesus Christ I'd like to stand here under the authority of what a prophet already said and say Satan come out of this church under the authority in the name of Jesus Christ he has no he has no chains on you he has no power over you he has no Authority over you you have been given the word of God I say rise like the bride you are and say Lord I am your bride I don't have to accept sickness I don't have to accept disease I don't have to accept formality I don't have to lose my children I don't have to settle for nothing less than everything the word has promised I am yours and I thank you for it oh somebody ought to say praise the Lord thank you Jesus for the blood applied thank you Jesus thank you for giving me a powerful message that I can be under authority to when I could have been in the age of Luther when I could have been in the age of Wesley he chose me to live in a dark age but under a glorious light aren't you thankful for that oh brother wle you can come I'm sorry I held you along but I'll say this I love the message of the hour and I love his people and I hope you do too because one of these days we're going to be caught

under Authority looking at Jesus and there he is amen raising the dead and casting out devils and the and and and the centurions looking at him and said listen I'm not even worthy you to come into my house just speak that word cuz I see you're a man under Authority you've got an authority lot bigger than that little stature that you are he I an I'm under authority too and I say come and they come and I say go they go just speak the word and my servant will live and I say tonight I'm so glad I don't care whether you're a little child whether you're a housewife or whether you're you're a uh uh just a an usher or a a a deacon or a father or a whatever you are when you're under the authority of that word you can stand there Toe to Toe against any devil you have every right to stand hell is hell is afraid of you amen just as much as he would be afraid of of of the Prophet himself or Jesus J Christ himself hell is afraid of those that are under the authority of the word it's incredible this is the word age amen this is the Capstone age this is the authority age this is the adoption age this is the age where we're no longer children amen but we come under the authority of the very word of God think about it folks what's left preeminence in you and the next is going back to the eaten condition where you are Sons and Daughters of God ruling the entire world the Earth that God's put you over in the beginning this is who we are this is not just these aren't just good sermons this is real man this is real [Music] there's a song I don't know I've heard others sing it uh uh we come under the authority you anyone anyone know that song uh uh it's a fast song Under the authority of God's word amen all right we'll sing that song Amen huh I get so it's a Gaither song Amen is it an old one or new one new one old one oh I'm not that old old new amen I'm glad sing it I'm glad for you know it oh amen well I'm I'm but I I'm thankful I'm thankful for this that God's given us aren't you well I thought that was a beautiful message tonight you know and and uh and he he gave some roses towards me and but I understand what he's talking about listen God's the the dress wear of the bride of Christ is that five-fold Ministry and so you're not ever lifting up a mind but but having respect for God's gifts that he places in the church is so important because if you lose that respect you're losing your Authority that's right yeah that's that's the way God's that's the way God's given it amen and so those scriptures there we don't use them a lot that obey them that have the rule over you well there's a reason that God places those things in the scripture is that Authority he's wanting to get that Authority into the believer amen and and so we're thankful for for those things and I tell you what I I believe there's more Stevens I I I I I believe there's more of of those little girls amen that that brother brandham talked about you know and when uh in one of the meetings he was he was up and and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit just left him and the light came over that that crippled woman out there and uh and after he told her to get up that she's healed or that that that uh uh today was her day and when she got up there was a little girl there with tears running down her eyes as she was praying for the for the for the old lady oh a child with authority men and women with authority how many wants to surrender everything you are to the Lord Jesus Christ how many wants him to have total preeminence in your life amen I want preeminence to the word amen that's that's my heart's desire amen I I this this might not go with it but that song that sister Sharon uh taught us years ago consume me amen consume me Lord with a fire of your spirit consume me Lord and make me more like you oh Break Me Lord and Bless The Broken Pieces Of My Life I want to be used Lord I want to be used by you Lord I want to come under your Authority consume me Lord with the

were so quick to just put their husband down so quick to just dismiss their Authority and belittle their husband's Authority you see it you see it in church too but it's that it's that feminist spirit that you're nothing [Music] I but the husband is still the leader of the home [Music] and when you see a woman acting that way to her husband she's just wrong she's Anointed with an evil spirit but when we look as the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't want to be Anointed with an evil spirit I want to recognize him as my Lord I want to recognize him and put him in his rightful [Music] place I I want to say you you are my ruler you are my Lord You Are My leader I want to respect that when I come before you I want my attitudes to be correct I want I want to honor your word in every part of my life

it's brother brandom says the natural just simply reflects the spiritual points to it in the women's Liberation movement and and we see we see the the way that that's all went but we've also seen the way it's went in the church World till today it's just a mockery it's women out there jumping around dancing around claiming this that and the other and they have no Authority no power no nothing they're claiming that they and when I say women I'm talking about churches [Music] they flaunting their stuff and they broke the chain of command the word their husband has been put off to the side but the bride still has [Music] Authority because she still recognizes who he is he's the RO R he's the [Music] captain our husband is the is the god the king of all heavens and earth and when I come under that Authority when I come under that Authority I too am the possessor of all things Lord I want to love you more I want your words to be honored I want you I want you to be my Lord everything
