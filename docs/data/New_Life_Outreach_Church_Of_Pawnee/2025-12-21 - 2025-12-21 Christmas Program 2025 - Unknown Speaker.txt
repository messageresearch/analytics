========================================

Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention? On behalf of New Life Outreach Church's Sunday school classes, we thank you for being a part of our 2025 Christmas program. We are asking for your own safety as we begin our journey to keep your hands and legs in the pews at all times. for we will be having a group of soldiers, a cow, a donkey, and some adorable sheep walking through the middle. Also, when we dim the lights, please continue to stay quiet. We will be playing audio clips during this time. So, please sit back and enjoy the show. Our story begins one beautiful day when Mary, the mother of Jesus, was just a little girl. for all of your help with the chores today. &gt;&gt; You're welcome, mama. But I kind of wish I could have just played with my toys. &gt;&gt; I know you do. But it's good to learn to push aside our plans in order to be a blessing unto others. I know someday the Lord may use you in a very special way. Even if it's not the plan he had in mind, he has always been willing to surrender our lives to whatever class path he has planned for us. I know he must surely have something great in store for you. Now, several years have passed and Mary has grown up to be a beautiful young lady who has caught the eye of a local carpenter. Shalom. &gt;&gt; Good evening, sir. May I come in and speak with you for a few moments? &gt;&gt; Can I have a seat? &gt;&gt; Oh, hello, Joseph. &gt;&gt; What's on your mind today? &gt;&gt; Man, it sure has been a beautiful day. Doubt. &gt;&gt; It has. &gt;&gt; Really like the weather like this. &gt;&gt; It's been nice. &gt;&gt; I've been working a lot lately. &gt;&gt; You can have her, Joseph. &gt;&gt; You mean it. &gt;&gt; You're a highly respected man in our community. We know you'll take care of her. You have a blessing. &gt;&gt; Thank you, sir. I promise to always provide for her and love her with all my heart. And as custom was that after service is over. Why he would go home with her sometimes to her home for where her home was just across the hill where Joseph the carpenter was building a special little house. You know, it had to have that little special touch to it because it was the one he was going to bring his little bride to. The doors had to shut just perfect. The windows had to be plum for that was where he was to spend his life with his little wife. And after the noon meal, they would go out on the front porch perhaps and look across towards that little home and dream of the time that when they would be together, happy living at the house and how the roses would be around the windows and so forth. &gt;&gt; This seemed like a strange sermon today, Mary. What did you think? &gt;&gt; You know, I heard the rabbi say that this great God that brought us here and made us what we are today doesn't really have to do a thing for us now like he did then. But I've I've kind of been thinking that if this great God was so great in the days of our fathers and our grandfathers, then why isn't he just the same great God today? &gt;&gt; Well, Mary, I believe God's the same as he's always been. We can read some scripture to see where he's leading us. Is there anything you've been reading lately? &gt;&gt; I read in Isaiah about a son being born that I just really didn't understand. For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace. &gt;&gt; Who do you think the prophet was speaking of? &gt;&gt; Well, Mary, I believe the prophet is speaking of the Messiah that is to come. And that's why we stay true to Jehovah and not mix with other nations because one day Messiah will be among us. The very next morning, Mary was walking along the side of the street as the sun was rising. Usually, the women would go to the public well a little later in the day to get their water. But somehow Mary was led to go early that morning. As she walked along thinking about the things she and Joseph had spoken of the day before, she felt a strange feeling around her. As she moved along and she raised her head again, there stood this great light before her. &gt;&gt; Hail Mary, blessed art thou among women. Fear not, for thou sh favor with God. Behold, thou shalt conceive on thy womb, bring forth a son, shall call his name Jesus. But but my Lord, how how can these things be? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit shall overshadow thee, and the holy thing that shall be born from you will be called the Son of God. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Quickly testifying that she was going to have this baby. How is she going to have it? She's never known a man. There's never been such that ever happened. But she just took the word OF THE LORD AT WHAT it meant and begin to rejoice. If we could just do that, that's the only thing. That's what God loves. That's the only way to get RIGHT WITH GOD IS TAKE HIM AT his word. That's the only way that there is to please God. Take his word. Don't trust your knowledge. You'll reason. How can it be done? It cannot be done. When you reason, then you lose the victory. WE MUST CAST DOWN reasoning and believe what God has said to be the truth. Mary took him at his word and change the whole COURSE OF NATURAL LIFE for her. And he'll change the course of your life tonight if you'll take him at his word. If you are a sinner, he'll straighten that crooked life of yours out. If you're bound and immortal, HE'LL MAKE YOU AS PURE AS A LILY. If you'll just take him at his word, that vile conscience of sin that makes you look at immoral things and use the name of the Lord in vain have tempering up the fight above all. He'll change that course of life for you and make you a new creature in his son Christ Jesus by just taking him at his word. As our journey continues, we see Mary traveling to her cousin Elizabeth's house. Elizabeth had never been able to have children, but the same angel had told her that she was also with child. &gt;&gt; Oh, look. It's my cousin Mary. I've never seen her so beautiful in all my life. Look how happy she looks. I'm coming. I'm coming. Hi. &gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; why are you so happy? Is it because you and Joseph were to be married? &gt;&gt; No, not yet. &gt;&gt; Why are you happy then? Is it because I'm mother? &gt;&gt; Um, I mean, yes. Uh, no. Okay, that's kind of part of it. I'm really happy. &gt;&gt; I've been hate hiding myself for six months now. And I'm just a little worried, Mary, because the baby has not yet moved. I'm just a little bothered. Okay, I've got something to tell you. I'm going to be mother, too. &gt;&gt; Didn't you just tell me you and Joseph aren't married? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you're to be a mother? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; no. No. Okay. Okay. So, the other day I was on my way to the well and the same angel that came to Zachariah came to me and said that I was to I was to bring forth a son knowing no man I should call his name Jesus. Why am I so favorite? That the mother of my Messiah would come as soon as you spake his name. My baby leaps in joy for my in my belly for joy. Truly nothing is impossible for God. &gt;&gt; You were the word of the one with God the Lord high. Your hidden glory in creation now revealed in you are Christ. What a beautiful name it is. What a beautiful name it is. The name of Jesus Christ my king. What a beautiful name it is. Nothing compares to this. What a beautiful name it is. The name of Jesus. You didn't want heaven. &gt;&gt; You didn't want heaven without us. &gt;&gt; So Jesus, you brought heaven down. My sin was your love. &gt;&gt; What could separate us now? What a wonderful name it is. What a wonderful name it is. The name of Jesus Christ, my king. What a wonderful name it is. Nothing compares to this. What a wonderful name it is. The name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Once Mary arrives back home, she begins to prepare for the baby's arrival. We find her heading to the market to gather some things she was needing. Do you really believe that an angel brought you a message that you yourself will bring for the Messiah? &gt;&gt; Yes, I believe with all my heart. &gt;&gt; It seems so impossible to believe. &gt;&gt; Listen, I don't know how, but I know that God has chosen me and I know that he will fulfill his word. &gt;&gt; Isn't that Mary he is carrying a child at a little log? Mary claims that the angel told her that she's came the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Is she really crazy enough to believe that message she said she heard? &gt;&gt; Surely the Messiah wouldn't choose somebody as lowly as her to fulfill his prophecy. By the cre of the emperor Caesar Augustus, it has been resolved that a census be held in the entire world. All citizens return to their ancestral home to be registrated is the will of the emperor. Now when Joseph heard the news of the decree, he was concerned about Mary traveling in her condition. But Mary assured him that she had been given a sacred promise and that this baby would be born to save God's people from their sins. She knew she would find the strength to endure the journey. Although it wouldn't be easy and there would be many difficulties along the way. She reminded Joseph that they weren't the only family that would be traveling. There would be many others along the road that could help them if they had need. Mary and Joseph had now traveled for several days, and due to the many stops along the way so that Mary could regain her strength, they had fallen behind the rest of the group. That evening, when they had reached the top of the hill that overlooked Bethlehem, Joseph could see the town was already crowded and begin to wonder if they would ever find a place to stay. Mary had been in pain throughout that day, and he was thinking that maybe the baby may even come that very night. As he was looking around, he noticed a strange sight. A star bigger than he had ever seen before hung right over Bethlehem. When he mentioned it to Mary, she said it had stood out to her as well, and she had been watching it since the sun went down. She felt very strange, like something was about to happen. So they continued into town and begin to search for a place to stay. But as Joseph had feared with the amount of people that had come into Bethlehem, they were having a hard time finding a room in the inn. I'm sorry. There are no rooms available. Okay, thank you. Wait, it's not the most comfortable, but you can stay in my barn for the night. &gt;&gt; I'm willing to do whatever it takes. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And isn't he just perfect? &gt;&gt; The angel's message was right, Joseph. We believed and prepared for this moment to come, and God kept his word. Everything we've been through, all the ridicule, doubts, and struggles along the journey has all been worth it just to see him born through me. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus, there's just something about that name. He's my master, Savior, Jesus. Oh, like the fragrance after the rain. Oh Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Oh, let all heaven and earth proclaim. For kings of kingdoms will all pass away. God, there's something about &gt;&gt; that name. Once again now. Jesus. Oh Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Oh, there's just something about that name. &gt;&gt; He is my master, Savior. Jesus. Oh, like a fragrance after the rain. Oh Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Oh, let all heaven and earth proclaim. For kings and kingdoms will all pass away. But there's something about Saints of God, we must never settle for anything less than the new birth. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about an oldfashioned experience of God's life in our souls. the same life in our souls as it happened in the womb of Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. What an experience. The day that God overshadows your soul &gt;&gt; and you and be God becomes one. I want you to think about it. when the pillar of fire that once descended upon the Old Testament tabernacle coming down upon that little teenage girl, that teenage girl by the name of Mary and God would then create his own blood cell in her womb. &gt;&gt; Now, now I want you to think about that in her own belly. And Mary's baby boy was truly God's very own son. &gt;&gt; God living in a human body. And all of God dwelt in the body of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus would be the first the first human being to ever Amen. be without sin. And I can imagine Mary regularly attending the synagogue or church today and on the Sabbath. And she loved to read her Bible in the devotions and and and and she had read of the promises of a virgin given birth to the body of God and that his name would be called Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace, Everlasting Father. Amen. She had this crazy longing in her heart. Mary, could you imagine as she's reading it there and she had THIS THIS THIS CRAZY LONGING, AMEN. to be that girl &gt;&gt; there? THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS as as she would spend much time on her knees in prayer and she thought throughout the day asking God, "Let it be me. IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE to use a virgin girl, let it be me. Amen. Did you know that that is the way that God usually works? When he has a special purpose for somebody, he begins to put holy desires within the heart of the one that he wants to feel. &gt;&gt; That's the way he wants to do it. Hallelujah. He creates that craving in in their heart to want his promise to be lived through you. &gt;&gt; And he is the author and the finisher of our expectations. &gt;&gt; God gives expectation IN OUR HEART. HOW MANY WANTS GOD TO USE YOU all here tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I want y'all to think about it. MARY GAVE BIRTH TO JESUS, THE BODY OF THE INVISIBLE GOD. Oh my. Amen. His actions proved that he was more than a normal human being. &gt;&gt; He healed the sick. &gt;&gt; He raised Lazarus from the dead. HE TURNED THE WATER INTO WINE. &gt;&gt; And he went about doing the works of God. &gt;&gt; And no one could dispute that God was living in Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But now I can hear you say, &gt;&gt; I can hear someone in here say, "Now, pastor, what about me? &gt;&gt; I have a longing, too. &gt;&gt; I really desire for God to use me and to DO SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL in me, too." &gt;&gt; Maybe you may be thinking in your heart, "Well, I guess that could only happen in the Bible days. I mean, there there can only be one virgin girl, right? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Oh, but that's where the story gets really good. &gt;&gt; That's where it gets really really good. And actually, that's where it all begins. Jesus grew up and was killed for our sins. &gt;&gt; Everyone was sad. Amen. But this was part of God's plan. If Jesus chose to die for our sins and that made a way FOR THE PILLAR OF FIRE THAT WAS OVER THE TABERNACLE, for the pillar of fire that came down upon Virgin Mary, the same pillar of fire that filled Mo that filled Jesus is THE SAME PILLAR OF fire that'll fill you. Hallelujah. It's that same pillar of fire. That's what God's looking for. Amen. Hallelujah. Now, remember this. After the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, he told his disciples, he says, "Now listen, there's still some prophecies &gt;&gt; that must be fulfilled, &gt;&gt; and I've chosen you to be the ones &gt;&gt; that he uses." &gt;&gt; Oh, that does my heart so good. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It would happen in them. And then they began TO HAVE THOSE SAME DESIRES THAT MARY HAD. &gt;&gt; Let it be me. Let it be me. They went up into the upper room and they begin to 120 OF THEM GOT TOGETHER and they begin to say, "COULD GOD USE ME? LORD, WILL YOU FILL ME? IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE SOMEBODY, USE ME." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. As they begin to prepare themselves in prayer, the Bible says that same pillar of fire came down in that upper room and it filled them all with the Holy Ghost. GLORY TO GOD. FILL THEM ALL WITH A BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. Then it happened. Amen. God's spirit came down upon them and filled them so full that they would never be the same again. They had something more than Mary had. Now Mary gave birth, Amen, to the body of God. But these men and women, these men and women were born again and they became the body of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Did you know that Virgin Mary was up in the upper room with them? Mary Mary gave birth to Jesus. &gt;&gt; But Mary wasn't satisfied. &gt;&gt; Mary says, "I want something happening in my soul, too." &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh, can't you say amen to that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Then that same pillar of fire was now in his church and they had a virgin birth and their souls were born again and their lives would forever more be changed and they spent the rest of their lives doing the works of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now I want to say here today, the spirit of Jesus that was living in them and quickening their bodies is the same spirit of Jesus &gt;&gt; that'll come down upon every one of you here tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. On that day, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ON THAT DAY, THE APOSTLE PETER, AMEN, he stood up and he said, "This is part of the Bible. &gt;&gt; This is the PART THAT JOEL THAT THAT THE PROPHET JOEL PROPHESIED OF." &gt;&gt; AMEN. For Joel had prophesied there in Joel 2 and 28. And it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh. And I love this part right here. and your sons and your daughters, the children shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream dreams. And here you go. And the young men shall see visions. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, pastor, we don't we don't see anything like that going on. Is God still doing these things today?" &gt;&gt; But I want to say, yes. Yes. God is still doing this today. &gt;&gt; He's still doing it today. There are still mamas and daddies. THERE'S STILL BOYS AND GIRLS &gt;&gt; WHO HAS THAT CRAZY DESIRE. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE GOT THE CRAZY DESIRE SAYING, "JESUS, won't you use me? JESUS, WON'T YOU FILL ME? JESUS, WON'T YOU DO TO ME what you done to those of the Old Testament?" Hallelujah. Amen. I say today, Amen. as as as as the Holy Spirit has been here on the earth and as we see this rapturing time of coming. If there's ever been a time, Amen, that God is moving upon children. It's in this hour. &gt;&gt; There's a moving of God upon the young people in this day. We see the moving of God in the youth camps. We see the moving of God in our churches. I say IF THERE'S EVER A TIME, LET'S GIVE EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT TO JESUS. LET'S GIVE EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT TO JESUS. HALLELUJAH. Peter continued and he said, he said, "For this promise is unto you, to your children, &gt;&gt; and to as many as the that are a far off, as many as the Lord our God should call." &gt;&gt; How many wants God to use you today? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want him to use you today. &gt;&gt; There there is there there is a cry. THERE IS A DESIRE WITHIN us today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many's going to raise your hand and say, "I want to be that one." Hallelujah. Why don't we sing that song to him here? Amen.

This is for adults, too. So, uh, we're going to try this here tonight. And, u, So, have y'all got the scoreboard up there? I don't see a scoreboard. Um, so we're going to ask um some of the questions out of the sermon that brother Brandham preached. Um, uh, good to see Brianna. See, you're feeling better. Amen. Um, all right. Who wants to start? We &gt;&gt; Yeah, because we're not doing it, boys and girls. We're going to do it. Yeah. Let's do it left and right. &gt;&gt; Left. Right. I feel right at home when I'm doing that. Left and right. Amen. All right. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. All right. So, who's going to go first? Who? Who? Brother Merl, you gonna flip a coin? &gt;&gt; Do we Do we need to flip a coin here tonight? &gt;&gt; I don't have a coin. &gt;&gt; You don't have a coin, brother. Brother Merl's poor. Okay. All right. So, who's going to be heads and who's going to be tails? &gt;&gt; Um, Rahab and her husband. That That's That's exactly right. Uh, she was married to um uh what what who was she married to? &gt;&gt; Salmon. That's right. He was She was married, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; I know. I probably should have done that to be honest. Yeah, but but yes, Rahab and Salmon. &gt;&gt; Huh? So, okay. Well, but since I didn't make that clear at the beginning, uh we're just going to give it We're going to give it to the girls or &gt;&gt; to the left. To the left. Oh, this is going to get bad. Okay. All right. Okay. Um All right. When listening to the message, what shadow was Jesus born under? Well, y'all y'all better y'all y'all got to find your answer on that one. &gt;&gt; What shadow was Jesus born under? All right, come up with your answer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Y'all y'all need y'all need each other's help. Go. Y'all y'all help each other. It's informal here. You're You guys are going to need each other's helps on a few of these answers. All right. Anyone want to steal it? Anyone want to steal it or not steal it? We don't steal in the house of God. Okay. All right. Um, why did the angels Why did the angels come to the shepherds? the religious leaders wouldn't accept &gt;&gt; that. That's right. It was God's wisdom because the theologians of the day wouldn't receive the message. The prophet would tell us it might not amount The prophet would tell us it might not amount to very much, but I want to pass my opinion. I believe it's because it's the wisdom of God that he knew they wouldn't receive the message the way it came. It wasn't in the taste, their taste of learning. It was different. It wasn't what they had been trained to believe he would look like, he would be like. And I want to say amen to that. When the word of the Lord comes in this day, God can come in so such a precious way in his word being fulfilled and the majority of the people will not accept it because it it's not according to what their church teaches. &gt;&gt; That's right. God is just as real today as he's always been. And God is fulfilling prophecy right now in his bride. But people get a rank attitude and uh and and God doesn't reveal himself to them. All right. So that's another point. So that is two zero. All right. This this side over here. How many years had they been waiting for the Messiah? &gt;&gt; 4,000 years is right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm going to say, come on. Got to get some finger going on there. All right. Over here to the left. What did brother Brandham say a common habit of the people uh were? What what common habit do the people have? What habit is common among people today or among among people &gt;&gt; of yeah of of of all days of of all days there's a common habit among the That is exactly. Did you help come up with these with these questions? they they they are always praising God for what he has done and saying what he will do. &gt;&gt; So so they always so that is a correct answer. So they they always um uh that's the way they do. Now back over here to the right. Did everyone see the star? &gt;&gt; Good question. That's that that is correct. The wise men followed them for two years or or followed that star for two years. And when when the wise men got into Jerusalem, which was the most holy city among the most holy people, God God had used the Jews. God was dealing with the Jews. And they asked, "Where is he the king of the Jews?" And they say, "We don't we don't know anything. We don't know anything." So they never seen the star. So, it takes a a special a special group. And I'm glad today that we can see that gr and that's the way it is with revelation today set in the same church and God will reveal himself to one and then and then two other people might not ever see it. But aren't you glad God reveals to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, uh over here to the left, who does God choose to reveal himself to? I I heard something over here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Overall, who who does he reveal himself to? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we we'd accept that. The nobodies. Brother Brandham would put the nobodies. He choose God chooses the nobody. That's the reason he chose the shepherds. The shepherds was completely at home with the God lamb in their midst. His word made flesh among them. The proud and the wise never received it and passed them and passed by them. Isn't that Isn't that just incredible? Amen. All right. Over here to the to to the right. What is always common at the birth of a king? &gt;&gt; Singing. Singing is correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. Always. All right. To the left. Throughout all scripture, redemption has been represented through blank and blank. This will be interesting. Throughout the scripture, redemption has been represented through blank and blank. Mercy and grace. &gt;&gt; That's your final answer. &gt;&gt; Told me to say it. &gt;&gt; No. throughout the scripture. You guys, y'all have y'all y'all can get y'all can get a bonus point here. I can't use that word steel. Throughout all scripture, redemption has been represented through blank and blank. Shepherds and sheep. We were listening to the sermon why it had to be shepherds. &gt;&gt; Okay. Shepherds and sheep. Amen. All right. So, And as and as we go remember God always used the sheep uh and and and and so the the to bring man into his presence. All right. So over here to the right there can't be the presence of God without what following? No, it's it's uh it's over here on the right side. &gt;&gt; You guys, y'all need to be back there with those guys. &gt;&gt; What type of tie does Santa Claus wear? No, that's there can't be the presence of God without what following. &gt;&gt; No. What is it? &gt;&gt; We'll accept that. the supernatural. &gt;&gt; All right, guys. They're they're they they've caught back up over here. All right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You guys have had all the easy ones. What you talking about? The prophets &gt;&gt; were usually what? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; What? What? What's your What's your answer? I I can't. &gt;&gt; Seers. &gt;&gt; No, that's not what we're looking for. But they gave that one. &gt;&gt; Why did the herds &gt;&gt; uh prophets were usually what? So So did we did Did you guys give y'all's answer? Did y'all say &gt;&gt; seers? &gt;&gt; All right. So that's seers, but that's not what we're looking for. So over here, prophets are usually what? &gt;&gt; Shepherds is right. They're usually herdsmen. Now, now it is important you you guys should all get together and do your talking and that way that that way u you know y'all's not saying two different things. But that's right. All most of the prophets of the o testament most all of them that you read about were all shepherds. They were herdsmen. All right? Isn't that what crazy? Abraham a shepherd. &gt;&gt; Isaac a shepherd. &gt;&gt; Jacob a shepherd. &gt;&gt; Moses a shepherd. David was a shepherd. Most all of these were shepherds. So, it's pretty incredible that God comes to the shepherds instead of to the preachers when he was born. All right. All right. So, you guys, that was a bonus point for y'all, right? All right. So, why did the herdsman wear sheep skin? &gt;&gt; Yes. It's y'all sight. Is that y'all's answer? &gt;&gt; All right. So, Okay. So, what's what's the answer? &gt;&gt; Why did the herdsman wear sheep skin? All right, y'all. Y'all's choice. Y'all's chance to get a bonus point. Why did the herdsman wear sheep skin? Is &gt;&gt; that y'all's answer? &gt;&gt; No, I was telling them what they said. &gt;&gt; All right. They believed there was coming a perfect lamb sacrifice. &gt;&gt; So they there it was symbolic not just clothing but it was symbolic. They they had the revelation of God even way back then. Revelation were in those prophets and their clothing was even symbolic of what they believed was coming. Abel slew a lamb because he had a revelation that there was going to be the perfect lamb. All right. So, all right. Um, okay. Back over here to the left or yeah, to the left. What did brother Brandham liken Moses rod to? &gt;&gt; A shepherd's staff is correct. That is exactly right. &gt;&gt; That's That's exactly right. What uh over here to my right? What does the name Bethlehem mean? &gt;&gt; No, it's the house of God's bread. &gt;&gt; You did say that. Oh, okay. All right. All right. So, you get that point. All right. So, over here to my right, left. How old was John the Baptist when he went into the wilderness? &gt;&gt; Nine. &gt;&gt; Nine is correct. &gt;&gt; No clapping. Hey, they're catching back up over here, by the way. &gt;&gt; Not Ah. All right. So, what prophet said, "But thou, Bethlehem, Euphr, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler of Israel, whose going forth have been from old, from everlasting." No looking at phones. Which prophet said that? Yes. That that's a that's a scripture. I'm going to tell you, we had I done a youth camp and if those guys, you know, they were doing a little they were doing little skit or little little quizzes between the the the the teams, the boys and the girls. And then they all voted that they would they would do the the the kids against the preachers. Oh man, they were giving us a run for our money here. All of us preachers were lined up and those kids, they were pretty smart. They were pretty smart. All right. What What do we have over here? What prophet That's a long That's a long scripture, so I'm not reading it again. Okay, I'll read it again since this other one's going to take it. What prophet said, but thou Bethlehem Euphr, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel, whose going forth have been from old, from everlasting. What prophet? &gt;&gt; I figured dad would know this one &gt;&gt; cuz he quotes it &gt;&gt; was Micah. &gt;&gt; So Micah is the one who quoted that. All right. Are we back over here to the left? &gt;&gt; Sheep aren't born in a house. This This is a quote. Sheep aren't born in a house or a pink decorated hospital room. They are born in Sheep aren't born in a house or a pink decorated hospital room. Where are they born? stable. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I I should put it I I should he he gave when he was in with with the quote here. I was I was reading through the quote and um so he he specifically he lists three things. So maybe I should be saying blank blank and blank. Yes, stable is is is one of the answers where sheep are are are born. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Three different places. &gt;&gt; So that's one of our answers &gt;&gt; of That's another one. &gt;&gt; Barn was the other one. &gt;&gt; Barn, stables, and fields. &gt;&gt; So, so they're saying you didn't get that third one. But he he but but he did say barns and stables the same. Right. So that was sort of &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. We're going to give it to you. All right. Over here to my right in the slaughter yards. What leads the sheep &gt;&gt; to the killing place? the goats. That is correct. &gt;&gt; Over here to my left, who did Jesus tell feed my sheep? You know who said &gt;&gt; Jesus told my &gt;&gt; you guys just gota knows it. &gt;&gt; Michaela knows it. What is it? &gt;&gt; PETER. NOW, Sister April didn't whisper it in your ear, but No, &gt;&gt; no, she got that one fair and square. &gt;&gt; That That was fair and square. All right. Didn't she didn't she do a good job on her on her verse? &gt;&gt; All of y'all done a good job. I I All three of them. Uh I I I was sitting there just listening to brother uh uh Devin and I thought, "Wow, he's he's a good singer." And and so I was I was still sitting there listening to that and then and then here comes Charity and I'm going, "Whoa, &gt;&gt; Charity's got it going on." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh so I All three of y'all just done an amazing job. And so God bless y'all. All right. Um All right. So who am I talking to now? &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Get &gt;&gt; Hey, I gave I gave y'all an easy one earlier. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Who said &gt;&gt; to my right? Who? To your right. Who said that he had to forget all he ever learned that he might know Christ? Yes. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now, uh now so according listening to I I tell you what I have enjoyed going over I've enjoyed going over why it had to be shepherds. It's a it's an incredible thing, huh? Oh, it's it's such an incredible message. Just, you know, the revelation is just is just amazing. But u All right, you you guys over here, right? &gt;&gt; Okay. What is the biggest hypocrite in the world? &gt;&gt; Don't be giving them answers. the biggest hypocrite in the world. &gt;&gt; What is the biggest hypocrite in the world? &gt;&gt; And and again, there was a reason I said it's it's nice listening to that tape because you you want to get it off that tape, &gt;&gt; that sermon. &gt;&gt; How sure are you? Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is the biggest hypocrite in the world? and and and there are I mean there it's it's it's used a lot um and there's different answers different different times but this is this sermon &gt;&gt; you have to you have to be listening to this sermon Is it religion? &gt;&gt; All right. Have y'all got your answer? All right. So, you you guys have got a you guys have got a chance &gt;&gt; to to to get a bonus point. What is the biggest hypocrite in the world? &gt;&gt; Hey, we can't interpret what you're saying back there. &gt;&gt; We need an interpreter for for her. She knows the answer. All right, you either know it or you don't. What is the biggest hypocrite in the world? And the answer is, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; The crow. I heard you say it, too. &gt;&gt; Are y'all Y'all need to start listening to Brother Joe a little bit? A crow can set out here and eat on dead horse all day and fly out there in the field and eat grain with the dove. But a dove cannot fly over there and eat on the dead horse and then eat grain. It would kill him. All right, man. Y'all had your chance. So, and and that's a good that's a good that's a good sign. Okay. When Jes or when Moses Moses when Noah let out the he let out two birds. He let out the crow or he let out the dove and and and the and the dove went flying around and came back. Now, he he he let out the dove twice. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then he and then he lets out the crow and the crow stays out there. So, you know, he don't know. They could they don't know whether they're still And then he got to thinking, what? Wait a minute. The dove was going around trying to land on a tree. The crow the crow stayed out there. He had plenty of food to eat. &gt;&gt; So, the crow stayed out there eating on all the dead bodies. So he waited a little bit longer and then and then Noah puts out the dove again and then the dove comes back with a little with a little tree, a little limb in her beak to let her know and let them know that that uh uh land is is ready to inhabit. Isn't that isn't that something? So So that is all right. Now, so uh uh so Kobe is that have we went have we went through 20 questions already? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. So y'all y'all want to go through? Y'all want to go through? Let's Let's do Let's do 10 more and this will be on anything. All right. How's that sound? &gt;&gt; Y'all want to do it? Huh? It's It's your turn. We don't We don't believe in stealing in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, who gets it? &gt;&gt; It's &gt;&gt; it's it's your turn. Okay. How many miles did Mary and Joseph have to travel to Bethlehem? Hey, hey, when when you you know watching that play today and um you know you're listening to the narrator um I uh I I'd went back you know they wanted me to listen to to the quotes that they that they had picked and everything and um so I went back and listened to you know some of those sermons and you know to uh the cruelty the cruelty of Herod um uh to to do what he was doing out there was just it was just so it was cruel. How how many how many miles from Nazareth to Bethlehem? Don't worry, we have all night long. 10 9 8 seven &gt;&gt; six &gt;&gt; five What do you mean I give them more time? &gt;&gt; Six. Five. &gt;&gt; Four. &gt;&gt; We need an Yeah, we need an answer. &gt;&gt; Y'all y'all have the answer. Is that your Is that the answer? Man, you guys got a lot of voices over here. &gt;&gt; All right, we're going to go to the left. How many miles did Mary and Joseph have to travel to go to Bethlehem? 42.7 &gt;&gt; and 90 miles. &gt;&gt; 90 miles. &gt;&gt; Mary, &gt;&gt; she was 90 miles that she had to travel on the back of a mule. &gt;&gt; Uh uh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you knew now you know when she was says, "I'll do anything." That's the reason. Huh? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, now we're back over here. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. What else did the wise men do? What else did the wise men do than give Jesus gifts? There's two. There's the answer is two. It's got &gt;&gt; they done two things. Yes. Worshiped and warned Mary and Joseph. That's true. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Huh? worship. &gt;&gt; Well, I was just asking Kobe um uh we have down here they knelt and worshiped him. So I, you know, I would I would almost say that's really just one answer. Um they they worshiped him. I I don't I don't even know if that's if that's even if I was asking them if that's scriptural that that they kneel. Did they kneel? I mean, I I I don't I don't know. I I'm okay. All right. &gt;&gt; All right. Over here to my over here to my right &gt;&gt; or to the right. All right. True or false? True or false? The three wise men were present at Jesus birth. &gt;&gt; Well, that was a hard one. &gt;&gt; All right over over here to the left, &gt;&gt; Christmas wasn't a true or false. Christmas wasn't celebrated for over 300 years after Jesus died. &gt;&gt; True. True. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; That is correct. Christmas was not celebrated um until December 25th 3000 336 AD. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So the very first Christmas, the very first worshiping of of celebrating of his birth was 336 years after Jesus was born. &gt;&gt; 11 years Yes, that's that's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, but that but that just goes to show the dogma, you know, the dogma's just starting every year. They just add on and and add on and add on and and that's the reason why if you get away from the word in one point and and listen and I and and and you say, "Well, are you are you for Christmas or against Christmas?" There's nothing scriptural about Christmas about about celebrating his birth at all. They didn't do it. And they didn't do it in the f the apostles didn't do it. The disciples didn't do it. Uh they went for 300 years. Hey, we hadn't even been a country for 300 years. Okay? The USA hadn't even been a country for 300 years yet. And so, but it was it was these guys trying to add dogma to the church and then they started adding this and that and the other. And that's the reason why I don't want to be an old Scrooge. Uh well, that's part of Christmas, too. I don't want to be I don't want to be, you know, a bad a bad guy. It it's just the stuff that we put in our kids and and and and their minds is it's it's it's pagan. It's not right. It's not real. You have a quote. Go and read it. The cruelty of sin. And it says, "And every man and woman that goes to church." Today, I was thinking of the cathe the cathedrals ringing out, the bells tolling and so forth like that. People going to church, making ready and women buying their Easter hats and so forth. And what what does it come to? My how I can't understand where a rabbit has anything to do with the resurrection. See, no sir. How a Christmas tree has anything to do with the birth of Christ. It's pagan, friends. You've got off the path somewhere. That's right. And he says, uh, but now a real born again man or woman re realizes because there's life within you tells you that that's wrong. Isn't that right? So, that's a good quote. Amen. So, so we're thankful for the spirit of the Lord that that gives us these these things in our in our in our lives. Amen. All right. So, here here where we at. How many how many more questions have I just done? Okay. All right. So, we I I'm we've only got two two questions that I've done since we started the 10. So, we got to hurry this through. Okay. Yeah. All right. Which one's next? &gt;&gt; All right. What lineage did the three wise men come from? What lineages? &gt;&gt; Yes, we're on this side. You you'd be getting you &gt;&gt; the answer to &gt;&gt; I hear a duck. All right. All right. You guys You guys about ready? What What's your answer? &gt;&gt; There's the the the lineages and there's and there's there's there's three there there's going to be three answers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I I I should have brought that to you. There's three answers. That's it. &gt;&gt; That's That's it. That That was a tough one, too. Hi. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Over here to my or to to to your left to your to your left. Um, okay. What was the name of Jesus early or earthly grandfather? moderator talking. We'll give him our answer. All right. So, who what what was Jesus earthly grandfather's? &gt;&gt; All right, y'all have y'all's answer. &gt;&gt; Jacob. &gt;&gt; Jacob is correct. I didn't think that was correct. I was asking Kobe. I don't know. But he just came and showed me in the scripture in the lineages. So, Jacob was his grandfather. All right. Okay. Um, let's see. The uh uh o over here. Y'all keep track of my of my How many is that? Is that four? Is that four questions? All right. Over here to this side. Did the star lead the wise men straight to Jesus? &gt;&gt; Noah is correct. &gt;&gt; They Noah is correct. Led him to the general vicinity. They went to they went to Jerusalem asking around. The star had disappeared. They they were asking they were all saying we don't know what's going on. And then they went back the wise men started looking through the scrolls and they found that in Daniel it says that uh or in in in the uh prophecies that that Jesus would be born in Bethlehem. So when they left Jerusalem then the star appeared to them again and led them to Bethlehem or or to where the child was at. And so, uh, that was that was incredible, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; And so, um, uh, it says the star led them to there in Matthew 2, uh, the star first led them to King Herod, and after they saw the star again leading them to Jesus. Um, but they were two two separate sightings. All right. Um let let's see over here to the left. How deep was the snow uh when Jesus was born? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; There was no snow. Why wasn't there snow? &gt;&gt; Jesus was not born in December. Jesus was born in the spring. Why? Jesus was a lamb. That's right. He was God's lamb. Born in a barn. Born in a stable. All right. &gt;&gt; All right. If you all think that they've done their job, let's come over here and ask you all, what song did the angel sing when they appeared to the shepherds? That is right. That is right. And if we want to get down to the nitty-gritty, they didn't sing. &gt;&gt; They proclaimed. &gt;&gt; They were wrong. &gt;&gt; So I guess that was the first rap song ever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because actually Luke says that the heavenly host said, so there was a whole group of angels. So it doesn't necessarily say that they sang. It's just it's just common knowledge or it's it's it's just tradition and and and the prophet went along with that. So, um let's see here. Okay, so that's six. Is that right? Six. So, we have four more to go. All right, let's count down as we go. Um man, I'm I'm trying. Um All right. who said,"Lord, now let us thy your servant depart in peace according to thy word, for my eyes have seen your salvation." &gt;&gt; Simeon is correct. All right. What is the name of the city of David, also uh known as in the Bible? Don't forget their point. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to have 13. &gt;&gt; You lost. &gt;&gt; Hey, don't be watching the scoreboard. Yeah, that'll be that' be that'd be a cute one. &gt;&gt; Okay, have y'all answered? &gt;&gt; Bethlehem is correct. Two more to go. Two more to go. Okay. So, what are the names brother Brandham gave the three wise men? This is in everlasting life and how to receive it. &gt;&gt; You have to think deep and wild. Get all three, right? &gt;&gt; All three. We should not get them all. You got to be brotherly. Come on. Come on. Got to help them out. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Have y'all forfeited or what are y'all going to do? Give us what you got. &gt;&gt; Johnny and Jim. &gt;&gt; We don't We don't know the third one. &gt;&gt; You better come up with a third one. &gt;&gt; Is that what you want to go with? &gt;&gt; You know, it's not exactly right. I don't know if any of it's right. Let's try over here. What do y'all have on this side? &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. So, &gt;&gt; yeah. All right.

The first story I was going to take a year off from my uh my acting uh but uh but by popular demand I was asked to do uh the man and his birds and the birds. again. So, uh, just kind of scoot back a little bit. Just just give me this. Okay. You're in you're in this. So, yeah. So, just scoot back a little bit. Just And then on the when I when I read after this story, then I'll have y'all come up real close. Okay. So, I don't want to uh get up there. I don't really need this right now on this story. The man to whom I'm going to introduce to you was not a Scrooge. He was a kind, decent, mostly good man, generous to his family, upright in all his dealings with other men. But he just didn't believe all that incarnation stuff which the churches proclaim at Christmas time. It just didn't make any sense. And he was too honest to pretend otherwise. He just couldn't swallow the Jesus story about God coming to earth as a man. I'm truly sorry to distress you, he told his wife. But I'm not going with you to church this Christmas Eve. He said he'd feel like a hypocrite, that he'd much rather just stay at home, but that he would wait for them. And so he stayed and they went to the midnight service. Shortly after the family drove away in the car, snow be to fall. He went to the window to watch the flurries getting heavier and heavier. And then he went back to his fire side chair and begin to read a book. Minutes later, he was startled by a thuting sound. Then another, and then another, sort of a thump or a thud. At first, he thought someone must be throwing snowballs against his living room window. But when he went to the front door to investigate, he found a flock of birds huddled miserably in the snow. They've been caught in the storm and in a desperate search for shelter had tried to fly through his large landscape window. Well, he couldn't let these poor creatures lie there and freeze. So, he remembered the barn where his children stabled their pony that would provide a warm shelter if he could only direct the birds to it. and pause. So quickly he put on a coat and boots. 30 minutes later. So quickly he put on a coat and boots, trampled through the deepening snow to the barn. &gt;&gt; He opened the doors wide and turned on a light, but the birds did not come in. Well, he figured food would entice them, so he hurried back to the house. Oh, sorry, Russian there. Eddie fetched some breadcrumbs and began sprinkling them on the snow, making a trail to the yellow litted wideopen doorway of the stable. But to his dismay, the birds ignored the breadcrumbs and continued to flap around helplessly in the snow. Well, he tried to catch them. He even tried shoeing them into the barn by walking around waving his arms. Instead, they scattered in every direction except into the warm litted barn. And then he realized that they were afraid of him. To them, he reasoned, "I'm a stranger and a terrifying creature. If only I could think of a way to let them know that they can trust me, that I'm not trying to hurt them, but to help them. But how? Because every move he made tended to frighten them and confuse them. They just would not follow. They would not be led or shued because they feared him. If only I could be a bird, he thought to himself, and meagle with them and speak their language, then I could tell them not to be afraid. Then I could show them the way to the safe, warm barn. But I would have to be one of them so they could see and hear and understand. At that very moment, the church bells begin to ring. The sound reached his ears above the sounds of the wind. And he stood there listening to the bells. Oh, come all ye faithful. Listening to the bells, pearling the glad tidings of Christmas. Oh, he sank to his knees in the snow. Oh Lord, now I understand why you came in flesh and blood. So we could hear you and see you and touch you. So we can understand and believe why you were born to live and die and rise from the dead, ascend, then return as the Holy Spirit to live in us and with us. When his family returned, he excitedly shared his experience that he just had. The next day they had the best Christmas ever and seen. Too close. testing testing. Thank you, brother Caleb. So, did you kids understand that story about the man and the birds? Who understood that story about the man and the birds? But that man couldn't become a bird. But God is so great. He He could become a human. Isn't that wonderful? This is a story. I've got one fairly short story and then a longer story. Excuse me. My wife's trying to help me uh learn how to uh use uh electronic devices. Brother Wendell, I sure appreciate y'all coming up here and this is a really privilege to uh to read stories to you every year. I don't remember what year did we start, Brother Wendell? &gt;&gt; 15 years. I know it was before Adam, so I don't know how many years, but uh I hope you all enjoy these stories. And uh this is a story of the shepherds. The hundreds of sheep were quiet now, except for an occasional night had fallen. The stars are sharp in the nippy sky, and the shepherds relaxing on a steep hillside above Bethlehem, watching over their flocks. The men talked quietly among themselves, their voices low, somewhat soothing to the animals. Old Delias, he had spent his lifetime on these sheep fields. Then there was Judah bin Ozri just 20 years old and he was angry. His uncle had been imprisoned by Roman occupation troops for some minor offense. And when he could, Judah plotted secretly with a unit of zealot guerillas. David, Israel's greatest king, had been a shepherd on Bethlehem's heels a thousand years before. As a teenager, David had defeated the giant Goliath and thrown off the yoke of the Philistine tyranny. Judah bin Ozre vowed he would do the same. If only a leader, a deliverer would come and and drive the cursed Romans from their land. The lambs will all die before long, he muttered. Only the mama sheep will survive. Said Elias, the old man. His hearing had faded over the years. Judah spoke a little louder. The youth's will be sheared next summer and bear more bear more lambs. But these little lambs themselves, what asked Elias? The lambs said Judah, won't live beyond Passover in in the Jerusalem temple. They'll be sacrificed. Ah, Passover in the temple, said Elias. On the holy day, they'll s sacrifice a lamb for each family. Jerusalem and its temple were just six miles north of Bethlehem. and supplying lambs for the Passover sacrifice was these shepherds livelihood. Passover, reflected the old man. I wish I could have seen the first Passover. You'd have said you're not you weren't around then. Not quite, young shepherd boy. Elias would rather talk than listen since it was hard for him to hear to catch the words when others spoke. Moses was our deliverer on that first Passover night when God's judgment fell upon all of Egypt. As he spoke, his listeners could picture the destroying angel that had passed through Egypt. The Egyptian firstborn were killed, said Elias. But each Israelite slave family who had sacrificed a precious lamb and put its blood across the top and on both sides of their doorways. Their sins were atoned for. The lamb's life given for theirs. And God's terrible judgment passed over them. The use will live on, repeated Judah, but the lambs will be sacrificed. I don't think I'd like to be a lamb, the youngest shepherd said sadly. The shepherds now fell silent, tugged their heavy cloaks about them to shelter them from the whistling wind. Their eyes were accustomed to the blackness, and every mo every few moments they would look up up to the scan the hills for wolves or thieves. They weren't about to lose sheep by being careless. All of a sudden, their hillside was flooded by the light of a thousand lamps, blinding them with it with its intensity when they could finally see a man shining of peril stood before them. "Do not be afraid," he declared in the ringing voice of a herald. I bring you good tidings of great joy that will be for all people. Today in the town of David, a deliverer has been born to you. He is the Lord's Messiah. The Messiah, the deliverer, breathe Judah bend Azri. He has come at last to set our people free. They could scarcely comprehend. Good news, great joy in the town of David. The son of David is born this night, the Lord's Messiah, the shining man glowing with the very shikina glory of God and declared it. It must be so. The angel continued, "This will be a sign to you. You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger." What a strange sight. But there was no time to think. Now the shining angel drew himself to full height. As he opened out his arms, the radiance and glory upon him began to spread until it covered rank after rank of other angels. The heavenly host, the army of God himself, more and more company after company began to fill the sky. And they began to chant to shout in unison, "Glory to God in the highest." The sound bounced off the hills and echoed from the valleys like the rumble of thunder, like the great of a roar of a great waterfall. The shout of triumph, the shout of worship, the shout of honor, the shout of glorious praise. Glory to God in the highest, they shouted together with one enormous voice. Glory to God in the highest, they chanted, the overwhelming resonance blotting out everything else. and giving the shepherds just utter joy. The host of God overcome with awe at the archangel's words now shouted again. Glory to God in the highest and on earth shalom, peace, goodwill toward men. Again and again the waves of praise rolled over the hillsides until finally the voices began to fade. And only in the distance could the shepherd still hear the shouts that finally diminished into silence. The bright light too was fading like the final streaks of sunlight dipping below the horizon, painting the clouds red and pink. Old Elias was first to speak. Praise the Lord, dear friends. We have witnessed what the prophets only dreamed of. Angels breathe the youngest. The host of God's army, said Judah. Something greater still, Elias said, the chance to see the Lord's Messiah with our own eyes. You heard the angel. He's here in Bethlehem, and we must find him. The angel told us how. A baby wrapped in swaddling bands of a newborn lying in a manger. A manger. Well, you could find dozens of cattle troughs if you searched all the outlying farms. But a manger with a newborn baby laying in it, that was the that would was the sign. In Bethlehem itself, Elias could think of just one. Inside a dugout at the very edge of town where travelers animals were quartered, the old man careened down the hillside at a pace that left the younger shepherds breathless. He was ahead of them now, almost running to the cave behind the inn. When they finally caught up, the old man was standing at the doorway to the cave. Dear, tears running down his cheeks. The son of David, he was saying, the Lord's Messiah, the deliverer has come. The shepherds moved inside and knelt at the manger, peering at the sleeping baby boy, all tightly wrapped in swaddling bands. The youngest explained to the mother, and angel told us. And then thousands, maybe millions of angels filled the sky, lit it up with God's light, shouting, "Glory to God." and we we joined them until we we were horse until they were all gone. Then Elias addressed her, "Young woman, mother of this blessed child, you are one of the favored ones of whom the Lord spoke of the the angel spoke upon whose God whom God's glory and grace is resting tonight." You could see her lips form the words Yes, I know. Yes, I know. But no voice came. The old shepherd went on, "The angel told us that your child is God's promised Messiah, our deliverer." Then the old man was silent. He just knelt there for a few more moments. Finally, he rose, took the mother's hand, pressed it with his own. "God has entrusted you to raise his own son, my dear. Our prayers are with you. He motioned his friends towards the door and they got up, leaving the cave in its manger and its Christ child. Nor were the angels silent about what they had seen. They spread the good news far and wide. Then they went back to their flocks and carefully tended lambs that were destined for sacrifice on Passover. And though they could not know or understand it, the baby deliverer in a manger would not challenge the Roman oppressors, but instead deliver us from sin and death that oppress us all. For these simple shepherds had seen God's lamb born to be a pac a Passover sacrifice for the sins of the whole world. Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace. Shalom for us all. &gt;&gt; The end. How'd you like that one? Can I Can I read one more to you? &gt;&gt; All right. Glad you teenage boys are joining us. Austin and Dylan used to be right there. Where they at? They gone. They're right there. Oh, they backslid on us, Brother Wendell. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh, I've done this one before. I didn't do it last year, but I'm going to uh so y'all probably do not remember this. Okay, this is called Christmas at widow Jensen's and a a widow is somebody who has lost their their husband. Okay, it was Christmas Eve 1942. Brother Torrance was just a little bitty toddler. He's not with us tonight, is he? He was like two years old. Well, this is a story of a of a of a boy who was 15 years old. I was 15 years old and feeling like the world had caved in on me because they there just wasn't enough money to buy me that rifle that I wanted for Christmas. Who who who's gotten a rifle for Christmas? He did we did the chores early that night for some reason. I just figured daddy wanted a little extra time so we he could read the Bible. After supper, I took was over. I took my boots off and stretched out in front of the fireplace and way waited for daddy to get down that old Bible. I was still feeling sorry for myself. And to be honest, I wasn't much in a mood to read scriptures. But daddy didn't get the Bible. Instead, he bumbled bundled up and he went outside. I couldn't figure it out because we had already done all the chores. I didn't worry about it long though as I was so busy wallowing in my self-pity about not getting a rifle for Christmas. Soon he came back in and it was it was a cold, clear night and there was even ice in his beard. Come on, Matt. Bundle up good. It's cold out tonight. I was really upset then. Not only wasn't I not getting a rifle for Christmas, now he was dragging me out into this cold. And for no earthly reason that I could see, we'd already done all the chores and couldn't think of anything else that needed doing, especially not on a cold night like this. But I knew he was not very patient at one dragging his feet when he told him to do something. So I got up and put my boots back on and got my coat. Mama gave me a funny smile as she opened the door to leave the house. Something was up, but I didn't know what. Outside, I became even more dismayed. There in front of the house was the horses already hitched to the big sled. Whatever it was we were going to do wasn't going to be a short quick little job. I could tell I could tell. We never hitched up this sled unless we were going to haul a big load. Daddy was already up on the seat. The rain's in his hand. I reluctantly climbed up beside him. The cold was already biting at me. I wasn't happy when I was on the sled. Daddy pulled the pulled it around the house and stopped in front of the woodshed. He got off and I followed. I think we'll put on the high board, son. Help. Help me. High sideboards. It was it was going to be a bigger job than I wanted to do uh with just the low sideboards on, but whatever it was we were going to do would be a lot bigger with the high sideboards on. Then daddy went into the woodshed, came out with a arm load of wood, the wood I'd spent all summer hauling down from the mountain and all fall sawing into blocks and splitting. What is he What was he doing? Finally, I said something. I asked, "What? What are what are you doing?" He said, "You've been by Widow Jensen's lately?" Well, I knew Mrs. Jensen lived about two miles down the road. Her husband had died a year or so before. Left her there with three children. The oldest was only eight. Sure, I'd been by their house, but so what? Yeah, I said, "Uh, why?" I rolled by their house today, Matt. Little Jakey was out digging around in the wood pile, just trying to find a few chips that were left. They're out of wood, Matt. That's all that he said. And he turned and went back into the woodshed for another arm load. I followed him. We loaded the sled so high that I began to wonder if the horses would be able to pull it. Finally, he called a halt to our loading. Then he went to the smokehouse and he took down a big ham and a side of bacon. He handed them to me and told me to put them in the sled and wait. When he returned, he he was carrying a sack, a flower over his right shoulder and a smaller sack of something in his left hand. What's in the little sack? I asked. Shoes, Matt. They're out of shoes. Little Jakey had just little gny sacks wrapped around his feet when he was out in the wood pile this morning. I got the children a little candy, too. It just wouldn't be Christmas without a little candy. We rode the two miles to Mrs. Jensen's pretty much in silence. I tried to think through what daddy was doing. We didn't have much by worldly standards. Of course, we did have a big wood pile, though most of what was left now was still in form of logs that I would have to saw and split before we could even use it. We alo also had some meat and flour and we we could spare that. But I knew that we didn't have any money. So why was he buying them shoes and candy? Really? Why was he doing any of this at all? Miss Jensen had closer neighbors than us. It shouldn't have been our concern. We came in from the blind side of the Jensen house where we wouldn't be noticed and unloaded the wood as quietly as possible. And then we took the meat and the flower and the shoes to the door. We knocked. The door opened crack and a timid voice said, "Who is it?" Lucas Miles ma'am and my son Matt. Could we come in for a bit? Mrs. Jensen opened the door and let us in. She had a blanket wrapped around her shoulders. The children were wrapped in another blanket and were sitting in front of the fireplace uh by a very small fire that hardly gave off any heat at all. Mrs. Jensen fumbled with a match and finally lit a lamp. We brought you a few things, ma'am," Daddy said, and set down the sack of flour. I put the meat on the table. Then he handed her the sack that had the shoes in it. She opened it, took the shoes out, one pair at a time. There was a pair for her and one for each of her children. Sturdy shoes. I thought the best shoes that I'd ever seen. I knew they would last. I watched her care carefully. She bit her lower lip to keep it from trembling and then tears filled her eyes and started running down her cheeks. She looked up at my daddy like she wanted to say something, but it just wouldn't come out. We brought you a load of wood, too, ma'am. And turned to me and said, "Matt, go bring in enough to last a while. Let's get that fire up to size and heat this place up. I wasn't the same person when I went back out to bring in the wood. I had a big lump in my throat. As much as I had to admit it, there were tears in my eyes, too. In my mind, I kept seeing those three little kids huddled around the fireplace and their mother standing there, tears running down her cheeks with so much gratitude at a heart. She couldn't say a word. My heart swelled within me and in a joy I'd never known before filled my soul. I'd given at Christmas many times before, but never when it made so much difference. I could see where we were literally saving the lives of this this family. I soon had the fire blazing and everyone's spirit soared. The kids started giggling when Daddy handed them each a piece of candy and Mrs. Jensen looked on with a smile that probably hadn't crossed her face for a long time. She finally turned to us. God bless you. I know the Lord has sent you. The children and I have been praying that he would send one of his angels to spare us. In spite of myself, the lump returned to my throat and the tears welled up in my eyes again. I'd never thought of my daddy in those exact terms before, but after Widow Jensen mentioned it, I could see that it was probably true. He was an angel. I was sure that a better man than daddy had never walked this earth. I started remembering all the times he'd gone out of his way for mom and me and many others. The list seemed endless as I thought on it. Daddy insisted that everyone try on the shoes before he left. I was amazed when they all fit, and I wondered how he'd know what sizes to get. Then I guessed that if he was on an errand for the Lord, that the Lord would make sure he got the right sizes. Tears were running down Widow Jensen's face again when we stood up to leave. My daddy took each of the kids in his big arms and gave them a big hug. They clung to him. They didn't want us to go. I could see that they missed their daddy. I was glad that I still had mine. At the door, he turned to Witter Jensen and said, "The Mrs. wanted me to invite you and the children over for Christmas dinner tomorrow, Mrs. Jensen." The turkey will be more than the three of us can eat, and a man can get quite canankerous if he has to eat turkey for too many meals. We'll be by to get you about around 11:00. It'll be nice to have some little ones around again. Matt here, he hasn't he hasn't been little for quite a spell. He uh I was the youngest. My two brothers, two sisters, they had all gotten married, moved away. Mrs. Jensen nodded and said, "Thank you, Brother Miles. I I don't have to say, "May the Lord bless you. I know for certain that he will." Out on the sled, I felt a warmth that came from a deep within. I didn't even notice. I didn't even notice the cold. And when we had gone away, daddy turned to me and said, "Matt, I want you to know something, son. Your mother and me had been tucking a little money away here and there all year so we could buy that rifle for you, but we just didn't have quite enough, son." Then yesterday, a man who owed me a little money from years came by to make things square. Your mom and me were really excited, thinking that now we could get you that rifle. And I started into town this morning to do just that. But on the way, I saw little Jakey out scratching in that wood pile with his feet wrapped in those gunny sacks. And I knew what I had to do. Son, I spent that money for shoes and a little candy for those for those children. I hope you understand. Oh, I understood. And my eyes became wet again with tears. I understood very well. And I was so glad my daddy had done it. Now, the rifle seemed very low on my list of wants and priorities. He had given me a lot more. He had given me the look on Mrs. Jensen face and those smiles on her three children. For the rest of my life, whenever I saw any of the Jensen's or split a block of wood, I remembered. Remembering and remembering brought back that same joy I felt riding home beside of my daddy that night. He had given me much, much more than a rifle that night. He had given me the best Christmas of my life. The end. And I just wanted to say a couple of words before I let you go back to your seats. And uh there's one person that loves you more than your mom and daddy loves you, more than your mama and papa's and grandparents. Do you know who loves you the the best and the most? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right. And I if you were listening this morning, I read a scripture about when when some parents who had heard about Jesus, uh they didn't come just by themselves. They brought their children. Do you remember that? They brought their children to Jesus that he might touch them. And the disciples who were kind of like bodyguards to Jesus to kind of keep people away. Uh they were like telling the parents, "Why did you bring the kids? That's just more you don't need to have your kids here." Well, Jesus overheard and he he became upset. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he turned to his disciples and he said, "Allow the little children &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; to come to me. &gt;&gt; And do not prevent them, for of such is the kingdom of heaven." &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he said he took him took them up in his arms and and and he blessed them. That's how much Jesus loves children. &gt;&gt; So that means Jesus loves every one of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And of course, God so loved the world that he gave us Jesus, &gt;&gt; his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. So Jesus wants to he wants to know you as you get older and stronger and bigger and wiser and and he wants to make himself known to you. And he wants you to know him and through his word and by his spirit that he sent back to earth after he uh died and was crucified and rose from the dead. Where did he go after he rose from the dead? Did he go to heaven? &gt;&gt; But did he come back in the in in spirit form in the Holy Spirit? And that's what he wants you to understand that you to have the Holy Spirit have have have the the real Jesus in you. Amen. So, how many loves Jesus? And how many knows Jesus loves you? Amen. Wonder if we could just sing that. Jesus loves me. This I know. Brother Kobe. Oh Jesus loves me. This I know. For the Bible tells me so. Oh little ones to him belong. They are weak but he is strong. Oh yes Jesus loves me. Oh yes Jesus. How about it parents? Oh yes Jesus loves me. The Bible tells Oh, we have another verse. Oh, Jesus loves me. He who died, heaven's gates to open wide. For he has washed away my sin. Oh, let him of our church um uh is for the young people. you know, I uh was getting a little goodie sacks back there in the back and and uh ready. And by the way, I've got I've got some goodies back there in the office for for all you youngans. and um started started counting them all and and uh I lost track at around 25 and I thought, you know, 25 kids, young people go to church here. And um you know, we're a small church, but we're a healthy church because when there's young people and and mamas and daddies that love the Lord, raising their children, mamas and daddies, what's what's the next generation going to be? And that's why we mamas and daddies, what's what's the next generation going to be? And that's why we that's why we do these kinds of things. That's why we we work so hard with youth camps and for everything that we do. And sometime we get so tired uh uh sometimes and and especially those who have been working on this. I know y'all must be tired. Uh but I mean you think you're tired being here in church for three hours. Uh you know those ones that been laboring putting this all together. I want to say your labors are never in vain. Never in vain. And uh so we just want to say God richly bless you and uh may the Lord be with every one of you. Now we've got we we've got some more goodies and things as I say for you kids. Uh I've got I've got stuff for you teenagers, too. So uh they're in the office. Then we've got we've got food over at the fellowship hall uh that's prepared. And um y'all may notice that the fellowship hall has been a little bit cooler lately. And um uh our furnaces went out uh our heater. And so um you know when a heater that size goes out, it it it's a little bit of money and it's a little bit of a little bit of time getting everything ordered and and um so we're putting your offering money to work. Amen. So, uh, it's woo, man. Those things are expensive these days. And, uh, so we appreciate, uh, brother Michael, brother Merl getting that getting that figured out and done. Um, all right, let's let's not one that's on the road. And, um, but for those that are here, um, come on to church and we'll we'll we'll have some fellowship. And uh you know if you've got I I'd realize if you've got family in and they're only here for a day or two, you know, I I understand. But uh but for those who can and and want to come to church, we're going to have the doors open. Um Stacia is going to be having her baby on Tuesday. They're going to be inducing her. And so so just because you know we found out just because they induce you uh Tina found out that might be a day or two. But but u they're going to be inducing her on u on this this Tuesday and so you know I So, so, uh, she's going to be having that, uh, say she's going to be having her baby on Tuesday. So, let's be let's all be praying for her. And, um, I think she says she's going in at at 4:30 in the morning. So, man, 4:30 in the morning, that's that's rough. Um, all right, Kobe, is there anything else we need to think of? Say, "Amen." Have you enjoyed yourself tonight? Amen. I thought these kids done really, really good. &gt;&gt; And um so uh you know, we just we we we thoroughly appreciate or just so you know, when you start naming names, you just always miss somebody. But uh um the you know Nathaniel, brother Nathaniel getting things together and trying to we we bought these cheap mics uh for them to to wear this time which which was which was a blessing. Uh uh we couldn't we couldn't afford to get the um get get the nice ones. So uh but but we we've got eight of them running through one channel and uh uh and and he was scrambling around. Brother Nathaniel was having to buy parts and adapters and whatever else to try to get things to work. And so we got them to work. And uh but the only thing is there's only one channel. So uh you know if if a person didn't have their theirs up to their mouth or they weren't talking loud enough, they were just all on one control. But I thought they all done very very well. And so we just say, God richly bless every one of you. All right. Amen. Let's let's uh go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we just want to thank you for this beautiful day with our families. Thank you for our families. Thank you for the mamas and daddies who have invested so much of of their life into raising them in the fear and admiration of the Lord.
