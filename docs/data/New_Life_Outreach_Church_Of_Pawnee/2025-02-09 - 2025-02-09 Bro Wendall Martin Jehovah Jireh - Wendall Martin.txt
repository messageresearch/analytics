Lancaster and um we appreciate her very much and and uh we appreciate uh sister Brianna and and her team and um uh I've seen sister titha and sister Angie and yeah over there working brother Robert was they even had brother Robert a working amen and uh so and all the cooks and and everyone that was involved would putting those kinds of things on it requires a team effort and so uh we we certainly appreciate uh everyone that was involved in that and it was a a beautiful evening and um amen you know um one of the these days amen birthdays will not even be a thought we'll live a thousand years and never even have our first birthday amen won't that be wonderful amen and uh so uh we're just we're just looking forward to that day preparing for that day let's look here in Genesis 22 and 1 and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham or test him is the better word and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am he said take now thy son thine only son whom thou lovest and give and get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clav the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went to the place which God had told him of Now Catch the picture Abraham had waited for 25 years the child is now 13 years old somewhere in there God comes and says this child that you have waited for 25 years and I have given you 13 years with the child I want you to take this promise and I want you to go and kill him and the Bible says and Abraham woke up early saddled his mule and or his donkey and and and and went to the mountain that God told him and then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said unto the young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to thee to you and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon his son uh Isaac and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto us unto Abraham as father and said my father he said here am I my son he said the behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham said my God shall provide himself a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called out and out of unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham he said here am I he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know thou fearest God seeing thou Hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and behold and looked and behold there uh behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by his thorns and Abraham took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of Isaac his son and Abraham called the name of the place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen God bless you you can be seated here this morning want to minister a few moments on Jehovah jyra God my provider God loves to test his people he will he tests his people and and he knows what is in you amen but there's something about the expression expressed being expressed from the heart amen and God allows God loves to test his people the prophet said many a time that he expresses he will test you so that he can get an expression of Eternity from you Sister Sarah it sure is good to have you and your friend with us here God bless y'all enjoyed uh visiting with y'all a little bit last night and um but he wants to see an expression from you amen he's he he's um amen he'll he'll allow the devil as he done job sort of pull back from the man from the uh uh just lift his hand a little bit how many's ever experienced when God lifts his hand a little bit and and everything's going good and wonderful and then amen will hit or you know you'll amen your car will break down or amen the things will begin to happen and and if you're not careful amen you you'll get out of the flesh or you'll get out of the spirit and and and you'll start uh judging things by the flesh but Abraham even though uh it was it was now at least you know 33 34 years or or no 37 years 38 years in in the process since God had given the promise God had now amen all of these many years later after Abraham had walked with God by faith after he had believed for 25 years after God had fulfilled the promise amen the scripture says that God was still testing Abraham amen even 30 something odd years later still testing ABR abam and Abraham his heart was right he was willing to obey God as even as an elder uh walk with God believing God and I want to say Amen that God is taking you to to uh to the fullness of this Rapture amen and and there are going to be testing times along the way and God is looking for an ET Eternal sound to come amen from you from deep within you can you say amen and so we we can see that we walk by by faith with God Amen we walk with God by faith and obedience and and and and he is responsible for fulfilling his word in you now we just say what God says because what God says says is never wrong amen we believe what God says because what God says he will always back up no matter what you're seeing in your present situation or your current situation or the the situation you may Face Tomorrow amen just believe it the way God said it and God will bring it to pass for you amen I I I I I like that you see amen the elect has been given a key and it the key of divine revelation Abraham was given Revelation and that Revelation when God appeared unto Abraham there was nothing that could ever turn him away from the promise that God had given him more able to to pull him aside now he had many of his uh of his wanderings or his ups and his Downs his ins and out but the scripture says that he staggered not at the promise of God but he judged God Faithful who gave the promise now I want you to look at that this morning because I I I want you to know that this great mysterious God Amen the one that that is that fills all space and all time amen he he was then seen through the pillar of fire and and the the natural Sun that we see today that was not the First Sunlight the First Sunlight amen was the logos the pillar of fire when God spoke amen and then out of God the invisible God come a tangible Pillar of Fire that was that was the first expression of God Amen but you see God's desire was not to just remain invisible and not to just be seen in the pillar of fire but his desire was to be made manifest in humans in a human being and that's why Jesus came Jesus came as a redeemer to redeem you so that he can be expressed through you amen and so Revelation was coming to Abraham amen and this Revelation if you were to if you were to look through Abraham's life amen the Revelation it was Progressive and it grew and it grew and it grew until amen this this great Jehovah Gyra and I I want to say here today Amen in our in in in our finite conditions that we live in then in you is a revelation and remember you aren't responsible for the Revelation you didn't give the Revelation and you cannot fulfill the promise of God in your life there's nothing there's nothing about you that can fulfill amen Divine Healing there's nothing about you that can fulfill a Rapture there's nothing about you that can overcome sin there is nothing about you that can defeat the Devil am amen but you see it's the revelation of Christ in you the hope of glory that's the Revelation that brings you through well blessed be the name of the Lord amen I I I'm so thankful for that here today he is the Revelation now if I'm a little bit too loud you can you can turn that down a little bit but don't turn me off Allelujah amen so he is responsible for fulfilling his word amen so today I just want us to to to just say What God Says amen when we testify to one another it should be amen of what God says and so I want to say here that the elect has been given a key we walk with God in a world alone we walk with God Amen not everyone's going to see my Revelation not everyone's going to understand my revelation but I have a revelation from God Amen well praise the Lord amen I I I I like what brother brandham said here he says I I'm just an oldfashioned Backwoods preacher that believes in the old time heartfelt sky blue kin sin kill and religion that's right that believes the oldfashioned way I believe that man when he's born of God he becomes a Son of God the supernatural power of God dwells in him I we have a supernatural God we have a supernatural life I believe that any man that's born of the Spirit uh the supernatural Spirit believes in the Supernatural we got a supernatural Resurrection we got a supernatural Heaven we'll have a supernatural Rapture I believe the whole thing is built up around the Supernatural and if a man is born of the spirit of God he believes in the Supernatural can I hear an amen he can't help it because he's a Son of God it's a revelation to him amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord he said Christ couldn't help being what he was he was the son of God that's it see what I mean now see if you were intended amen you see the word of God you believe you believe it amen because why there's there's something new see why you have have you ever heard of a strain in a f family a son will have will kind of uh impersonate his father or the mother or the grandfather the grandmother it's the strain in the family amen you've heard of it haven't you well that's the same thing from predestination you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but being You Came the way you did you're subject to the fall amen you're subject to your flesh you're subject to Decay you're subject to sickness you're subject well praise the Lord heart you're subject to family issues amen but that doesn't that doesn't change the fact he says you're subject to the fall but because you're predestinated you hear the word of God and it brings you right back to where you were predestinated amen brings you it says what makes you believe the word and turn down these other things is because there is something in you way back Yonder you're supposed amen what you are made to live here forever I just want to shout hallelujah amen he says the Revelation is never wrong speak it anyhow no matter what it sounds like or what goes It goes right with that word amen you say it anyhow you believe it anyhow oh that's a positive confession amen the confession is not that I'm sick not that I'm defeated the confession is that I have been redeemed so that the supernatural God can have his way in me I am redeemed so that God can be expressed well praise the Lord amen oh we got we we go around too many times frowning amen every time yeah somebody it's a amen how they're doing some people it's just always well you know well you know oh man h I well I'm Mr defeat I'm sister defeat amen oh man oh you just don't know amen oh we do know ever since we've known you you've been defeated but I want to say today we're not here to glorify defeat we're here to glorify God Amen it is the god of Heaven that has become the god in your body that wants to express himself like he did to Abraham amen it was a willing heart of Abraham and he never got away from it that it is God that gave the promise and it is God that will fulfill the promise oh can you say amen amen the prophet of God would say the word the evening message must carry evening results the evening message must so evening seed not morning seed evening seed is is that right the midday scene is it seeds back there amen it was denomination it died and it perish but the evening time message will show evening time light and will bring show evening time results the evening time message he said Jesus time was the midday message it showed the midday results amen the beginning the message showed the beginning results amen he made his son in his own image in the midday in the evening time he makes a bride for him amen you see it by what his word how did he form the Earth how did he speak it into existence by his word who was his son the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh how will he take the bride by the word not a new cart not theologian idea but according to his word he will identify her well can you say Amen why did Abraham get up early that morning it he could identify with the word that he had been walking with for 30 some odd years he could identify amen it was the same one that revealed himself there in the land of her it was the same word that had spoke to him Amen in m it was the same word that appeared to him before the body changed and I want to say today amen when you become accustomed to walking with the spirit of the word amen you're not listening amen for anything else but what God says because God has has quickened You by divine revelation and he is showing himself strong and real in your behalf can you say Amen amen man now the prophet of God says you have something that you can go back to because the God who called you at the beginning is the god that you're walking with today Hallelujah the God my provider he is my provider every every new opportunity every new trial is a new opportunity amen everything about this bride amen every test somebody say every test you say brother W let's just bunch of test amen he may be looking for you to start overcoming one or two of them he may be looking for someone Amen to get a little bit of grit about them and amen get up out of bed and and put your britches on and say I'm going to show the devil who I am today I'm going to show what I'm made of today I am the word living in a body can you say amen he says but by his word he'll identify her how am I identified today by the word this is who I am why we don't just come and say Amen to the preacher well that's good but that's not what God's wanting you to do God's not want this ain't just a book of ethics and a code that make makes you feel better to live by I'm talking about the power of that invisible light or that invisible God who come come in the power of the logos amen that Pillar of Fire that lives in the adopted sons of God if you knew that the pillar of fire lived in you amen wouldn't you be ashamed of going around moping around all the time if you had a revelation that that great Pillar of Fire amen that led the children of Israel that appeared to William brandom all the time if you had the reel ation of what the prophet said that that Pillar of Fire lives in you you think God is pleased with you going around moping and groaning and crying and belly aing about your amen your sickness and belly aing about your trial and belly aing about the well come on Church the pillar of fire has returned because there is Sons and Daughters who can take that word and defeat the Devil why don't you start defeating the devil in your [Applause] life and you say Amen you'll identify her don't put one thing to it don't take one thing from it now leave it the way it is the evening time he's promised he would reveal through the opening of the seals and show them churches that missed it back there amen Revelations 10 and and and he and Malachi 4 Revelation Luke 17:30 said he would do it now let's not mix it up let's keep it right together can you say Amen so as the revelation of God Amen comes to its fullness it must be in a body amen it must be somebody say it must be in a body amen somebody say it might as well be in my body hallelujah amen you see all of the Mysteries all of the types of the Old Testament was made manifest in the body of Jesus Christ I would encourage amen for us to go back and just listen to those and really ask God for Revelation Christ is the mystery of God revealed amen Christ revealed in his own word amen go back and listen to these things and then understand what brother brandham is trying to say the spirit of the Lord God is here upon his word to live in some bodies right here can you say amen amen Christ the viory of God revealed he says because it's just gradually let loose as it dipped through the prophets and so forth till it was perfectly made known the godhead bodily in Christ and now the Christ in the church is just just being made known the whole thing is the revelation of God to take Eve back to her right position well that should make you want to jump and Shout Amen to take you back what is that that means you're not the tail that means you're the head that means you're not defeated that means you're an overcomer that means you are Hallelujah someone says we're just Sinners saved by grace I'm just a sinner we're all sinners I told a man one time I said you know don't call me sinner don't you put that over me I am a Son of God I was a sinner I've been saved by grace the grace of God is upon me amen I come on church I am a Son of God I am who God came to redeem amen hallelujah amen oh come on God let let let let inspiration drop into into a heart here this morning you are not that you're going to be now we are the sons of God well can you say Amen now we don't know what we're going to be amen we we we but we know one thing here as he is we shall be like him as he is word made flesh we shall be well glory to God Amen now now now remember hallelujah amen inspired word hallelujah inspir ired word what what is inspired word that's when the word amen becomes Revelation to you now I I I want to I want to dwell on this for just a few moments because I want this message Amen to become Revelation to you and and and and and we all in our different walks and the stages of our life amen no matter whether you're you you you you're a backslider who has come back to the Lord whether you've been raised in a Pew whether you're a nine-year-old boy or girl or whether amen you are 80 something years old we identify ourselves with that Revelation amen that inspiration drives us well praise the Lord in the natural Rim you do that in in in the natural you get something going in your heart you you get to thinking about a rifle they that hunting season and and before you know it all you think about is that rifle and every I mean you you you go to work and and and you see rifles everywhere you amen you're you a scope or and and you can't get your mind off of it is because there is an inspiration that is upon you amen well can you say amen amen you buy the thing within two years it'll be it'll be in a closet somewhere and amen you'll forget about it amen but you're not forgetting about it then because you're under an inspiration there is something that is inspiring what can you say amen amen it's like you boys amen wanting to drive a car amen oh my you eat it you drink it you sleep it you do amen why because you there there is something about it you it is energizing you amen and so this holy spirit is telling us today the spirit of the Lord God is upon me and hath anointed me I'm under an inspiration I'm am under well what's that inspiration it's the inspiration of the word I am the word I am an overcomer well can you say amen Amen brother bam says and you've seen a man pick up a certain scripture and brother that man can take that scripture and make it live new and make it live exactly just exactly what it is Promised in the Bible the next man you'll see him do it and he'll come around and try to do it and fall I hope you're reading now he'll fail why the scripture is not inspired to him he's only trying to impersonate he's trying to act like something that he wasn't May well maybe maybe he he's he was a sent by man but you see Revelation comes from God can you say amen hallelujah well glory to God a man sent by a man has to have the inspiration of a man denominationalism has to have the inspiration ation it has to have amen the motivation of that organization it there has to be a boss has to inspire his his uh uh uh uh his employees amen that employer is is not there just uh uh uh uh handing out paychecks amen but he's got to keep he's got to keep the vision before his his his people amen those that are working with him amen they are they have a goal they have uh missions to accomplish they have things to do or or or they'll become swampy amen the vision must be and and I want to say here today amen that's what that that's what why we come to church to keep the vision before your eyes but you see it's not just a man inspiring a man it's not just amen and we have a lot of wonderful things in in in in the world we have we have seminars for everything we have marriage seminars we have amen we have everything they're trying to Amen to keep the inspiration going but you see who's who's going to inspire this supernal I I'm I'm a mortal man you're a mortal woman we are all Mortals how can we do this God is in his church and God the great Holy Spirit has got the Breath of Life he's breathing he's inspiring he's giving life of inspiration unto you if you lose that inspiration then you've lost your purpose when you lose your inspiration in a marriage you're your marriage becomes dull when you lose your inspiration on the job it becomes dull and mediocre amen when the church loses their inspiration of the breath of the supernatural amen then we lose who we are a come on church amen we are not a mortal Church we're an immortal Church uh where we not a natural Church we're a supernatural church with a supernatural god with a supernatural power in you and me breathe upon me can you say Amen Time After Time Abraham did not lose he did not lose the inspiration or he did not lose the value because the anointing or the spirit of inspiration was there to anoint that word oh hallelujah hallelujah how is it how is it that an old man old woman am man can have tears screaming down their face after they served God for 60 years is because the same one who started the flame is the same one who is keeping the flame come on church amen it's the same one I am still walking in the Supernatural yes amen the devil is trying to tell me and identify me with this and that but that is not who I am by predestination God has brought me back can you say Amen there is a strain in that family not the strain in the natural can you say amen amen oh Hallelujah I just love it you're ordained turn to your neighbor and tell them right now you're ordained to be here hallelujah you're ordained to be here now you can be mediocre if you want but there's a God that's calling to Abraham and say you're going to have to be willing to walk with me in the Supernatural Rim all your life and don't worry even after you have been walking with me now for amen 47 48 years however long it had been up to that point Hallelujah for 37 38 years again he had already had 25 years amen now here's 13 years here's here we got and yet God visits with him and he's so knows that inspiration he so knows that that is God he gets up early he's not begging he's not questioning he's walking with God it don't matter it does not matter he's walking with God can you say man Hallelujah brother Brandon would say look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation now catch it these words are not just a play on words listen to him as he's finishing his paragraph Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing of what God is trying to do what is the new birth then well you say brother Brandon what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now now now before we go any further Christ in you makes him the life of the Revelation it's not knowledge knowledge puffs up but the life when we say Christ in you amen Jesus loves me this I know Amen in my come into my heart divine revelation divine revelation becomes the life of the Bible to you the life the very life of God live that Pillar of Fire on the inside of you makes that Bible to become wow oh my goodness oh my God the word is very tangible that word is very much touchable it makes the Bible live in you he says you want to know what the B New Birth is it's that Revelation personally to you oh if I could jump and shout and speak in tongues if I could what good is all of that is when you come back to earth well woe is me well woe is me well clus amen that's all right you you can you can go to the Grave with a Woe Is me and lose all of your purpose but I've got a purpose greater than woy wowy me I've got a purpose greater than well can you say Amen oh yeah oh yeah it's going to be a fight but I just want to tell you amen this kind of a fight God's not going to fight for you he overcame you so that you can overcome it how am I going oh I just believe it's going to happen one of these days yes it's going to happen when you change that confession and you say my name is Abraham H I am the father of Nations I am believing God's promise what are you doing killing that baby amen that God promise yeah I don't understand it all but I know that God gave the promise and if he has to raise that child up he will do it well praise the Lord now Christ amen it's the Revelation not that you joined a church you shook a hand oh you've done something different you've got a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he's the word that was revealed to you no matter what anybody says what takes place Christ it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you can you say amen he who gave you the promise will make you able to possess the promise somebody say he who gave the promise promise will make me able to possess it you're insufficient in yourselves the Apostle Paul says we are insufficient within ourselves amen have you ever looked up the word insufficient it means pathetic it means it means lacking incomplete pathetic inadequate measly wanting amen so we are who is sufficient of these things we are all insufficient we're all pretty pathetic but we're not walking according to what we feel what we see what we hear what we well can you say amen hallelujah amen oh God now I'm going to tell you I I amen I I I I I just choose to walk with God you know what I'm going to I know I've got some pains and I know I've got some failures and I know I got some Amen brother brother uh uh you know Merl says that he would probably be the one with the most mistakes and I think we're both running a race hallelujah amen I I I've always said that I'm the guy with all of the mistakes amen and all of the wrongs that I'm having to deal with but you know what I've got a seat on the end there is a family resemblance and it's not that of Durant Martin it's not that of Wesley Martin amen it's that of God I was a Son of God a long time before I was a son of durren Martin I was a Son of God a long time before mama ever thought about me and I want to tell you I'm going back I'm pressing forward I'm believing the promise and God's going to take this measly Wretch like this body that I live in and make me who he wants me to be the Seed of Abraham will always have to rely on the efficiency of God or you will be a failure well praise the Lord but God gives us the evidence oh God is so good you know the evidence of that land that we're going God gives us that evidence in this new land of the word that we have been brought back to the word is where we came from the word is ours but we have found that there is an enemy squatting on our land that there's Giants on that word that's our inheritance I'm not talking about a dead letter I'm talking about the Loos living in you making the word to live there is a devil setting upon that word there's a de come on church but what did God do when God took the people the children of Israel when he took them over to the promised land he did not just send them over amen as a whole and them be defeated amen when they saw the so you know what he done he says now I'm going to send some spies over that direction and they're going to bring back the promises to you and show you the milk the honey the grapes the pomegranates everything that I've said because there's going to be Devils there that is going to try to twist your mind if you look at the Giants you'll never see the graves if you look at the wall cities you'll never see the milk and honey so I'm going to come and show you all of my promises are true all of my promises are real oh come on church amen what did the prophet of God do amen when he come in Le osia he says the promise of Eternal land is yours amen but there's a lot of devils a lot of denominationalism there's a lot of man's ideas but I'm going to show you amen I'm going to show you Divine Healing I'm going to show you the supernatural I'm going to bring those things into your view so that you can see clearly that this is your land When God says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man God sends a prophet to make it clear this is what I've always said this is now there's going to be a lot of Walled cities and there's going to be a lot of devils out there and there's going to be a lot of things to try to get your mind this way way or the other but I'm saying look at the inspiration look at the inspiration that is here on the earth and with this inspiration now that those those Witnesses brought back the evidence but sad to say 10 of those Witnesses 10 of those Witnesses mingled mingled the promise with unbelief 10 of those weakness Witnesses says yes the milk and honey but yes but yes but and it convinced two million people God was faithful to supply their every need God was faithful to heal their bodies God was faithful to to to to to sin Quail God was Fai their their shoes grew upon their feet they never had to get any more well come on Church you talking about the supernatural presence of God but Tim DeWit preachers was able Amen to to to to to cause an entire congregation to say we're not able to make it the pillar of fire was with them but they never could get Egypt they never could get that slave mentality out they never could wake up in the morning and say I'm H I'm feeling tired but you know what greater is he that is in me I'm going to get up and I'm going to fight the devil I'm about 10 o' that Devil's going to know and he's going to leave me alone and I'm going to have a good day and I might have to do that every morning for the next 50 years but this is what I'm doing they couldn't get rid of the slave mentality everything about them was whoa wowy wowy me I'm a I'm a slave I I've been beat by this Taskmaster and I'm been defeated by this Taskmaster I I'm just defeated I I was I was defeated when I was a kid I'm defeated when I'm an adult I'm defeated when I'm an elder I'm just oh you poor miserable excuse for Abraham's seed amen Abraham would disown you first thing he would say lot get away from me I've got a revelation you and your herdsman that's Dr you get get out of my don't don't I don't even well praise the Lord you say oh brother wend that's pretty rough brother brandham said that you got God's word calls for a total somebody say total separation from unbelief he says amen those things that are derogative to your faith you better kick them out because they will hinder you and paralyze your faith amen now but there were two men Hallelujah Caleb jumped up there on the Soap Box Caleb jumps up hey hey hey hey hey thank you for these guys you guys are wonderful preachers it's wonderful you prophets of Doom but let me tell you I'm here to tell you this land is everything that Moses had told us this land I'm sorry I I I I'm fixing to get out of order but This Land is Our Land This what Moses has been preaching to us all of these years here we are we are more than able I am 80s something years old but I am able to take the land well can you say Amen what was it there was a there was a purpose that was driven by the inspiration of that word you know what I believe you know what I believe Joshua and Caleb they were hearing the same voice that Abraham heard 400 and something years earlier it was the same inspiration saying it is yours it is yours it is yours oh can you say Amen it is yours come on say can somebody hear the inspiration the same inspiration that fell on the day of Pentecost the same inspiration that the prophet of God entered into can you hear that same inspiration time is almost over and it's time for the sons of God to come into their position I say we're here we're in the position amen now now brother Brandon would say now the general went out and picked went out and picked him up out a man from each tribe and he he took off and he took Caleb his side buddy because he know Caleb believed and they went over that Promised Land come back with a bunch of grapes and taking two men to pack and and he said now anyen now that Israel will have the evidence before they get into the promise they'll have the evidence that God what God said it's a good land and it's filled with milk and honey it's a grand land it's a good land amen he he he he says uh he says now we're taking you to a land with milk and honey you probably never tasted of either one milk or honey down in Egypt all these years just they they gave you the you slaves rationing and now but you're going to this land amen and and and it says just at the time they got in uh one Day's Journey where where kades barnea the great judgment seat of of the world was they stopped under these great palm trees out there the springs and and camped and and and and he said now to let the people know watch what a perfect what a real perfect evidence it is how God does that just as he does today he said now God said the land is great now before you go over I want to you to see the land is great so go bring me some evidence of the land to show it to the people you know what Divine Healing is it's the evidence that there is a land where there is no sickness Hallelujah hallelujah oh can you say amen amen what what I I I I I when I when I come to church and we begin to feel the presence of the Lord how many ever feels that amen you're can to have a bad day and you come in and you just you just you have to fight those Devils amen you literally amen you ain't got a real sword but you literally have to fight those Devils of tiredness and those Devils of criticism or those Devils of whatever when we're first coming in but as you press and you fight against the enemy and then the presence of God begins to settle down over your soul amen it's a fight for you even show up to church but when you get there and you see the evidence it makes you all know that there's coming a land you were tired but you're not tired you were discouraged but you're not discouraged it's showing you that there is a land amen can you say Amen now to move on Amen now remember God has provided us this living word hallelujah now he says he spoke of this age and what would be now that the Believers of this age has to believe this and what he promised today just the same as they had to come into the ark to be saved go into Egypt come go out of Egypt to be saved they have to come into Christ to be saved now into this word message that he's the same yesterday today and forever how do you get into it by baptism baptism baptism of what water by the Holy Ghost he promised his word you won't have to interpret it he will interpret it through you one more time you won't have to interpret I say thank you Jesus what what are you doing what he promised to do I like that what are you doing what he promised to do what am I doing what he promised he would do through me oh come on church he says now the church that follows him will be so much like him until the people will know amen we don't get too egotistic there's no room for arrogance there's no room for Amen to presume that I can act any way I want to there's no I'm in the land that this is my land I'm free from slavery I'm Hallelujah they they found out while they were in the land and they got content and they also found out that they get removed can you say amen amen amen but I'm glad for a Caleb that says Don't You Worry one thing God's going to provide back to Abraham God says I will provide go Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide Isaac's carrying the wood Daddy's got the fire Isa looking to Dad and says I see the wood I see the fire but where's the lamb he says don't worry my son I know God he asks some strange things he leads us in strange paths he takes us down some roads that are crazy but I know it's him and I know God will provide for himself a lamb I I I've been walking with the word an awful long time Isaac and you're a promise you're a promise out of you Isaac is going I don't I God I the the the the the men were asking where are you going my son and I are going to worship and my son and I shall return I don't understand how oh I I got a knife I've got the wood I I've got the fire amen and I'm going up there to slay my promise but if God gives me the grace to slay him God will also raise him up I want to tell you now amen oh my amen all the situations are all around me but I know God is leading me I know I'm being led of God God's leading me down there oh but my car broke down and and I've got this and I've got that and I've got but I know in whom I have trusted I know in whom I have believed and I am persuaded that God's got a lamb for me can you see man then then the angel says Abraham he's not calling him Abraham he's calling him Abraham because the last Revelation brought the promise Hallelujah now he's under the promise he's experienced that what that word do now Abraham Abraham hold with old your hand to kill your only son for God has seen your heart and God Is providing a lamb the greatest confession Abraham could have ever made by getting up the next morning by having what we would all term a nightmare what we would all term that couldn't be of God he was walking with God he knew him he identified with him he obeyed him and God didn't abandon him the greatest the the greatest of the abrahamic Covenant was when when he was willing go go go go go go read that you know uh Clea put that up there on that next verse we didn't finish that next verse that the the 14th verse Abraham called that there in in Genesis 22 and 14 and Abraham called the name of the place Jehovah Gyra as it is said today in the mou of the Lord shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called from Heaven to Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn sayith the Lord that because thou Hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven the Sands which is in the sea and the seed thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice he is amen you're walk talking with me even though it's not pleasing even though it's one thing to have the promise I'm going to give you a child and God giv little signs I'm going but then when the whole thing turns around and says now I'm going to take everything that I've been promising you and him waking up the next morning I I just that that that that that just touches my heart I'm willing to give it up because my Revelation was never about Isaac my Revelation was that God that I met in the land of Earth the Revelation is that mesc the Revelation is that one who come and I fed that's the one who gave the it's not about the promise it's about the promise Giver promises come promises go but the giver is with me and I love him can you say amen Israel got in their promised land in their land of the holy spirit that Holy Ghost Land they walk across the overflowing Jordan River as the priest puts the ark upon the shoulders amen the overflowing river is is is is is is way out of its banks and God says now I want you to go over at this time of the year man tells him takes take the priest and put the Arc of the Covenant the word and as they walk out the waters are going depart is it Supernatural it just it's just you can't figure it out folks you just figure this thing out and if you start trying to figure things out in your life right now amen in this stage of your journey you just you're just messing it all up man God leads you to the impossibility so he can show himself real come on and as they walk across he done it he done it in the Red Sea but now he's fixing to do it in Jordan and the Jordan River parts and they walk with the word going before them and they go in and well pra praise the Lord and then the Bible says that they come one of the first cities the first city they come to is Jericho this great big wall City it God just doesn't do anything easy he just does it and you just you're asking for him to do this this come on come on while it's easy do it God don't want to do it when it's easy he wants to show it because lots of times he's trying to show himself real in your circumstance well come on church he did not come to Sarah and Abraham because they won all of the the first couple Awards they were young and no he pick them when they're in their 70s and he picks a girl that never could have a baby and says I'm going to raise up a nation from you well praise the Lord he picked you and you can't say that you're a you want any awards of being Mr and Mrs Faith he picked you praise the Lord and He leads them over Amen to this Jericho now and and it's very important because this is where the church has been and and and I want to I want to leave this to you they were to March seven days around Jericho the wall City Seven Days Seven Church ages each day they were to go around one time there was a mystery living out in that first day second day there was a mystery lived out in that second day the third day there was a mystery third seven days but in the for six days but in when they got to the seventh day they were to March seven times amen and well that seventh time on the seventh day the walls came crumbling to the ground on the seventh time on the seventh day they were to shout the trumpets of Victory they were to shout with voices of Praise they were to do this on the seventh day at the seventh time around they were not to do it the third time around fourth time around fifth time around they were to do it on the seventh time around we've had seven Church ages living out their Mysteries but in the seventh Church age amen is when the Myst hisory of what took place in the first and the second and the third the Sevenfold revelation of God Amen the Seven Seals were unveiled brother bradam says in the opening of these seals amen talking about the seventh he says is the time where everything must worship he says John which was the top of the Bride when he saw those Mysteries and he saw his name written in the land when he knew he was predestinated to be in that book when he seen that he is the reason the lamb came well come on church when he saw in the revelation of the seventh angel messenger the all of the Mysteries of the O of of the church for these last 2,000 years and what you are to be right now when he saw the completion of the whole thing he began to shout the Bible says those in heaven heard him shout everyone on Earth heard him shout everyone under the Earth heard him shout you know why because God had provided a lamb God had provided a lamb the lamb had come to open the book to him the lamb had come and said I'm GNA show you the mystery what had taken place in that J in Jericho Amen on that seventh time around amen the opening of those Seven Seals amen there was a declaration that Jericho belongs Amen to me it does not belong to to anyone it doesn't belong to the Heathen it doesn't well can you say Amen it belongs to the elect of God they saw their name in the book it's in the seventh time now you know before I leave this that they followed the promise I I just don't believe that that Joshua was just doing thing blindly in the dark he was doing what God told him to do now remember Moses took them up but Joshua took them over and positioned them in their land can you see man now the land the wall CI stood in their way but the opening of this seven sealed book to you the Revelation says the inspiration of the Revelation the life of the Revelation says that I'm meant to be here the pillar of Fire is going before us leading us around all seven times revealing himself what has he been doing he's revealing to this last day Church what he has been doing throughout all seven ages to increase our faith to let us know who we are can you say Amen to build our faith that I am with you the Supernatural is here the walls came tumbling down walls are not to remain in the seventh Church age when we have walked around the walls for seven times oh yeah you're still having to fight oh yeah you're still having to press but you ain't laying in your tent amen with your covers over your head Hing that all of the amalekites and hites the malachit and all of those eyeses don't find you in your tent no you're in the land you belong in the land it's your land God gave you the land you're the possessor your faith will carry you through and you're going to act like an overcomer even before you pull your sword out you you know who you are deep down inside you're going to get up you're going to get your sword you're going to polish it up you're going to sharpen it up you're going to amen get in front of the mirror and just learn a little bit of Amen whatever you have to learn to fight amen whatever you've got to do then you're going to leave your tent and get out and possess the land that God has given [Applause] you can you say Amen well praise the Lord amen God will provide himself a miracle make this Valley full of ditches God will take care of the rest when your city is shut up by the enemy when the word of God Says by this time tomorrow they'll be eating in this City and the King's right-and man says if the Lord should open up the window of Heaven maybe that thing would happen Prophet looked over at him and said it's going to happen but you're not going to possess of it well where's the Army going to come from we are surrounded we are totally surrounded where where how's this going to happen oh don't y'all worry those lepers that y'all didn't want in the city they're out there and I'm doing something on the inside of them they're starving to death the lepers God anoints those lepers they come under the inspiration of that word because the word has already been spoke it's got to come to pass God's God God's going to fulfill that by tomorrow morning God done said he was going to do it now that inspiration falls upon those old sorry lepers one leper looks over to the other one says man I'm hungry they said yeah we're hungry too the lepers said why sit here till we die we're lepers we ain't got anything but let's go let's go to the camp of the enemy might be some food over there and those dudes got cured and when they walked the Bible says the Bible says that God brought in such a confusion that the enemy started killing themselves all the commotion going on like crazy and these these four leopard dudes are walking in and thinking whoa Hallelujah one picks up a big old lamb leg and starts eating on it and the other one say well it's not good for us to be eating over here all by ourselves let's go to the city let me they might be hungry too they start beating on the gates and saying open it up man we we got food out the Bible says that the gates opened up and they went out and the guy that was Mr doubt Mr skeptical the guy amen that was just Mr defea in his mind the one that says I know it can happen but God God will have to open up Windows in heaven to do it I'm just that's all I got to say the Bible says he was trampled underfoot while the people were going to find their food well I just want to tell you God don't let me be an unbeliever not when I've been called to possess you're going to call me crazy call me crazy anyway I believe the word of God can you say Amen second Timothy 1 and 11 it says for which cause I suffer also suffer these things nevertheless I'm not ashamed for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed and unto him unto that day brother brandom says I'd like to drive this home when you catch that faith when you're going to be healed every circumstance everything else all signs all symptoms can point you or dying you'll never move it's a resting place in it it's resting places in the sanctuary of God's word When Faith genuine Faith sets itself there not make belief now in faith not hope but faith hope hope is out here hoping it'll it'll it'll hoping it was it in but faith is already in looking out and saying it's done that's faith and there's where faith is taking its resting place for it knows that God will never never let the enemy R over the top of him someone shout yes he never has Faith knows that so regardless of what the thing looked Noah knowed the ark would float certainly did Daniel know that God could close the mouth lion's mouth Hebrew children knew that God could stop the fire Jesus knew God would raise him again because the word said I'll not leave his soul in Hell neither suffer my Holy One to see corruption he know corruption said in 72 hours within 3 days I'll raise it up it took its eternal resting place in the sanctuary of God's word and there it's to it reason will try its best to recognize well this system is is bound to be better this is that amen it looks better because uh you you're looking in within that intellectual mind amen you can prove reasonings but you cannot prove Faith someone shout yes amen cuse it you can it if you can prove it it is no longer Faith but Faith knows only the word and the promise and it looks to the thing that you do not see faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you can't reason it I can't prove how it'll be done I don't know how it's going to be done I don't know it but I believe it I know that it's so because God said so and that settled it's the reason I know that this is right I know the word is right I know this message is right for it's in the word I see the Living God moving among it to prove we're at The Exodus certainly true even death itself can't shake Faith man stand right in the in death right in the face of death and Shout the victory of the Resurrection Paul oh death where is thy stink grave where is your Victory because Christ raised up and those that are in Christ will come forth with him at his coming it can't change it Faith makes the word of God its sanctuary of its Eternal rest it lays in the word of God God can you see man Hallelujah just keep what what what are you looking at this morning can you see yourself in that word can you see yourself right now in that word y'all remember y y'all remember brother brandom having the vision of the of the caribou and and the grizzly and that he was going to kill this caribou and and then and then he would kill a Grizzly on at the same on on the same day as he's coming back and and he he was asked to go hunting and and he had never seen one of these with those panels before he had never he he he was trying to describe him they well it sound like it might be a caribou he's talked about that big old silver tip Grizzly so some some friends had ask him to come hunting up in up in Canada he told him and they said no that we don't have that around here at Caribou there there's there's the panel animal which we it's probably the Caribou but but no there ain't no Silver Tip Grizzlies around here he okay all right well maybe it's not for this trip but amen so uh so they they get up there and and and they're and they're they're they're hunting and and U and you know God God gives him God gives him the

climbed all the way into the glaciers there and shot the caribou and uh you know they're packing the meat and and and as they're coming back down they're just rejoicing brother Brown says now remember The God Who told me that I got the Caribou has also said that I'm going to get a Grizzly I'm going to get a Grizzly before we get down to those Brothers down there he said there'll be a man down there there'll be a young man you man with a with a green checked shirt on and old bud bud was excited man he's excited he couldn't wait he couldn't wait to get on back down there and and and then bud got to thinking he says now brother Brandon from what you said that we're going to have to find a grizzly bear on the way down and he says yeah that's what that's what the vision said he goes no brother brand there's never been a I'm a guide I've been a guide around here all I know these I know these mountains there's never been there's there not even been a story of one of those around here brother brandom says have you ever heard of the story have you ever read of Abraham needing a lamb and Abraham was just simply trusting God and believing that God was going to provide and he says and God provided a lamb way up in that mountain where there was no Lambs Rams could ever be he says have I ever told you about the time that The Inspirations come upon on me and I spoke squirrels into existence he said why did God do that he said because I had need of them he says the same God the same God that spoke that RAM and spoke those squirrels is the same God that says I'm going to kill a a silver tip Grizzly before I get down to that man with a well praise the Lord hallelujah man he says well I told him I told him those visions and what would happen coming down the mountain which shot the Caribou on top of the mountain he said brother brandom according to that Vision we was in the Caribou Moss you know you you can see it for miles and miles nothing but yellow moss according to what you told me that that man's going to have a that shirt on Eddie down there he said that the checkered shirt on you're you're you're going to kill a a nine foot Silver Tip Grizzly I said it's thus saith the Lord he's now brother Brandon I'm not I'm not doubting your word brother how how could I doubt your word but look I can see every Speck of the ground there's nothing there isn't a bush that high there's nothing but Caribou Moss where's that bear at and I said he's Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide for himself God gives the vision and God will fulfill fill it God gives his word and God will fulfill it he says did you and then I asked did you ever I I I ever hear the story of the squirrels he said Eddie told me about it and I said well he's still God he's still there amen but brother brandom I I I want to ask you I I can see all the way around the mountain to to where the timber line is them horses are standing there's nothing there there isn't a speck of grass there isn't a rock there's nothing Caribou Moss which is about two inches high on above the timber lines for a mile or more above the timber line said where is that bear going to be I said God is Jehovah JRA if he told me there will be a bear there there will be one there oh Saints of the Living God can you be sure can you be sure today that God's going to keep his if God said it put your faith in it down the mountain every every time we'd get a half a mile or so he' say brother random about about time for that bear to appear I said don't worry he'll be here when we're almost within 500 yards of where the horses was he had to rest again with them heavy horns and things on our back and we had to rest again and he looked around again and I seen his face says he looked at me as as if down in his heart he was wandering see he had hoped it would be there but he didn't have the key he had hoped it would be there but he didn't have the key the Revelation but somehow by the grace of God he's never failed me when he told me there would be a silver tip there I had the key I didn't doubt it one bit not a bit I turned to him and I said Bud it'll be there and just as I turned there was the bear standing right up above us about a half a mile he throw the glasses on he said Billy so help me it's a big Silver Tip Oh Glory to God I said glory to God glory to God glory to God he says now according to that brother Brandon we're going to we're going to go down and we're going to see we're going to we're going to there's going to be a man with a with a small hand that's that's got this that's got the a checkered shirt on he said yep it'll be there Hallelujah he said well you asked brother BR or you had asked earlier at the beginning of the trip if anyone brought a check or chirt and they all said no

you didn't have a checkered shirt he said you know what I I my wife must have ped it he said when I I I I fell in the water and I had to go back and change clothes and there that green check shirt was amen and and and he said he was a little upset with his wife because he had told his wife throw the thing away because it was getting old and had it was it had holes in it and he didn't want to wear it anymore amen and there the old the old holy green checkered shirt was part of the vision his wife couldn't throw it away because God gave a promise if the musicians would come if God gives a promise where do we where do we fall then we've got to spend time with the Lord say Lord open my eyes to the Overcomers of the Le oans your eyes were blinded too the elect of the leas were blind too and God says come take this IA put it on your eyes so that you can see and buy of me some gold so you can be rich lay OS and say we're not blind and we're not poor but the elect says I needed something you see so we're born in this but this really this here this here is meant to exhibit his glory that can only happen is if that Soul walks with that Supernatural God and that Supernatural
