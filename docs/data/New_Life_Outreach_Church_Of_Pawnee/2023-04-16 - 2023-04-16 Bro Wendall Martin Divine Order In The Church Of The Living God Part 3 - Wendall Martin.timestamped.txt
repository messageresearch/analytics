[50:24] father
[50:27] we Look to You Lord and
[50:31] as you would see
[50:34] Patrick

[50:37] been dealing with him in his life
[50:41] and Lord how he is
[50:43] wanting to look to you and looking to
[50:46] you for changes and
[50:49] we've seen you working in his life
[50:51] already
[50:54] but God I'm asking that you would
[50:56] complete that work and that you would
[50:58] rebuke every demon that would try to
[51:01] Hinder
[51:03] that wayward son to come home
[51:06] I'm asking God that you would touch
[51:09] Patrick and whatever is wrong and that
[51:11] you would heal him
[51:13] but Lord we ask that you would keep
[51:16] after that soul and that you would bring
[51:18] him right back to Total 100 Redemption
[51:23] I thank you for it Lord and we look to
[51:25] you for that and we thank you for what
[51:26] you're doing and what you're going to do

[52:10] them to come back home where they belong
[52:12] amen
[52:16] amen

[52:26] one of them
[52:28] can you say Amen

[52:40] there's a chance that there's a big huge
[52:42] chance that they're going to go follow
[52:44] the same cycle of Brokenness that I'm
[52:47] here to tell you when you confess that
[52:49] token over those children God's going to
[52:52] break that break that that cycle of
[52:54] Brokenness and can bring them in to that

[53:50] let's look here in first Chronicles 17
[53:54] and one now it came to pass
[53:56] as David set in his house that David
[53:59] said to Nathan the prophet lo I dwell in
[54:04] a house of Cedars
[54:06] but the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord
[54:08] remaineth under curtains
[54:11] then Nathan said unto David do all that
[54:15] is in thine heart for God is with thee
[54:19] and it came to pass the same night that
[54:21] the word of the Lord came to Nathan
[54:22] saying go until David my servant thus
[54:25] saith the Lord Thou shalt not build me
[54:27] in house to dwell in
[54:29] for I have not dwelt in a house since
[54:31] the day that I've brought up Israel unto
[54:35] this day but have gone from tent to tent
[54:38] from one Tabernacle to another
[54:41] and who wheresoever I have walked well
[54:43] with all Israel spake i a word
[54:46] to any of the judges of Israel whom I
[54:48] commanded to Feed My People saying why
[54:51] have ye not built me a house
[54:55] of Cedars
[54:57] therefore thus shalt thou say unto my
[55:00] servant David thus saith the Lord of
[55:03] hosts I have taken thee
[55:06] took thee from the Sheep coat and from
[55:09] following the sheep that thou shouldest
[55:11] be Rooter over my people
[55:13] and I have been with thee where
[55:16] theresoever thou Hast walked and have
[55:18] cut off thine enemies from before thee
[55:20] and have made thee a name like the name
[55:23] of Great Men that are in the Earth
[55:26] and I will ordain a place for My People
[55:28] Israel
[55:29] and will plant them and they shall dwell
[55:31] in their place and shall be moved no
[55:33] more neither shall the children of
[55:35] wickedness waste them anymore
[55:38] as at the beginning can you say Amen
[55:43] amen let's go to the Lord once again in
[55:45] prayer father we thank you for your love
[55:48] we thank you for your grace we thank you
[55:50] for the anointing that we feel this

[55:55] be with us as we Minister your word in
[55:57] Jesus name we pray can the Church Say
[56:00] Amen

[56:11] Levi it's good to see you and your
[56:13] sister here with us this morning God
[56:15] bless you
[56:16] we want to continue a thought that we
[56:19] administered on a couple of weeks ago
[56:22] divine order
[56:24] in the Church of the Living God and we
[56:28] have dealt with the
[56:31] um the deacons
[56:32] during that time two weeks ago as we as
[56:36] as we looked at those offices and and so
[56:39] today I want to to uh continue in my
[56:45] thought if we will
[56:47] um we want to have we're going to be
[56:49] voting here before long or this this
[56:52] morning on on
[56:54] um Deacon and trustees and Treasurer and
[56:58] and but I I want us to look here this
[57:02] morning
[57:04] about our what what God is doing
[57:08] what God's desire is
[57:11] to be with his people
[57:13] the Church of the Living God the church
[57:15] is not a
[57:16] it's not a building
[57:18] but you are the Church of God
[57:21] David desired to build a house for
[57:24] Jehovah David lived in in a great house
[57:28] it was a house of Cedar and
[57:30] with great Grandeur and and he was it
[57:35] was beautiful and and
[57:37] um different ones from the kings of the
[57:40] different nations that had sent and and
[57:45] um they there was the soft Cedar there
[57:47] was the hard Cedar there was the Cedar
[57:50] uh from from all over the world that was
[57:53] brought in
[57:55] and one day as David was looking there
[57:57] at the at the blessings that God had
[57:59] given him
[58:00] and um amen he began to think of that
[58:04] Ark as he as he looked out and and the
[58:07] Ark was still behind
[58:09] skins and
[58:11] and as he beheld it he said God deserves
[58:16] the best God God deserves he man I here
[58:20] I am living in a nice house and God is
[58:22] living in a tent
[58:24] is the the the the the Ark of the
[58:26] Covenant
[58:27] and as
[58:29] the prophet Nathan listened to the heart
[58:32] of David his heart was overwhelmed as as
[58:36] he listened to David expressed his love
[58:39] for God and
[58:41] and and the observation and the honor
[58:44] for that David had for the Ark of the
[58:47] Covenant and for God
[58:49] and and the prophet responded and said
[58:52] do all that is in thine heart
[58:56] for I'm sure God is pleased with it and
[59:00] and while God was truly pleased with it
[59:03] yet God wouldn't let David build it he
[59:06] said David you're a man of war
[59:08] man if you would continue to read you
[59:10] would find that God says you have you
[59:13] have shed blood you have you have won
[59:17] many battles you fought many battles
[59:19] then you have you have done great feats
[59:22] for My People Israel
[59:24] but I'm not going to allow you to build
[59:27] a tabernacle Iman but he says your son
[59:31] your son Solomon shall build me a house
[59:36] Solomon is not going to have to do all
[59:39] of the war like you have Solomon is
[59:41] going to reign in peace
[59:43] and I'm going to anoint Solomon to build
[59:48] me a house and man God gave great
[59:52] consolation and if you had finished
[59:54] reading the chapter amen God promised
[59:57] David I love you David and I love your
[1:00:00] heart I I love your sincerity for me and
[1:00:04] toward me and I promise you David I I'm
[1:00:07] going to remember your seed amen forever
[1:00:12] I'm going to remember your seed and amen
[1:00:15] so here Solomon built a temple it was a
[1:00:19] more permanent Temple than than Moses is
[1:00:22] now he's still built according to Moses
[1:00:25] Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:00:27] amen Moses had built a tabernacle that
[1:00:30] he has seen in heaven of course Moses
[1:00:33] Tabernacle was a portable Tabernacle it
[1:00:35] was one that could man be put up and
[1:00:39] then let down as they went through them
[1:00:41] through the uh Wilderness for the 40
[1:00:43] years going into to canaan's land and it
[1:00:46] remained behind the badger skins amen
[1:00:50] and it would move from place to place
[1:00:52] but you see that Tabernacle it it was
[1:00:55] not just the Tabernacle that that made
[1:00:59] Israel so so special or so powerful
[1:01:03] within that Tabernacle was the Ark of
[1:01:06] the Covenant
[1:01:08] the Ark of the Covenant is where amen
[1:01:11] Jehovah dwelt he dwelt he would come
[1:01:15] down in between the cherubims amen and
[1:01:19] that great light would would come down
[1:01:22] the Shekinah Glory would rest over that
[1:01:25] Mercy Seat
[1:01:27] and there the priests would come in amen
[1:01:31] once a year and and would offer
[1:01:33] sacrifices for Israel and God would come
[1:01:36] down and God would forgive him of their
[1:01:39] sin and God's glory was with them the
[1:01:44] anointing would be there they were
[1:01:46] god-separated people Israel was God's
[1:01:50] chosen Nation they were ones they were a
[1:01:53] people that God a man had chosen to
[1:01:56] themselves and he would fight their
[1:01:58] battles he would he would be there and
[1:02:01] heal the sick he amen wore that Ark of
[1:02:05] the Covenant was God was there amen did
[1:02:09] you know that Ark of the Covenant
[1:02:10] represents the word of God today amen
[1:02:14] the word the word of the Lord is there
[1:02:17] is where the glory of the Lord is you
[1:02:20] know why the devil wants to come and
[1:02:22] take the word out of your heart because
[1:02:24] he wants to take the glory of the Lord
[1:02:26] from you he wants to take the presence
[1:02:29] of the Lord from you why has God left
[1:02:32] laodicea and all of the nominal churches
[1:02:35] is because the word has been taken away
[1:02:38] God dwells with his word
[1:02:43] anytime that Israel would sin and we've
[1:02:47] we've read through the history of Israel
[1:02:50] amen through the scriptures they're in
[1:02:52] Chronicles in the Kings and and and and
[1:02:54] the different books there where amen
[1:02:57] when the when the Iraq was was taken
[1:03:00] away Israel was as helpless as any other
[1:03:02] Nation they would become slaves
[1:03:06] unto the Conquering Nations because the
[1:03:10] word of God was not with them
[1:03:14] so Israel learned a man to treasure that
[1:03:18] word treasure that Ark of the Covenant
[1:03:20] not the Ark of the Covenant man it was a
[1:03:23] it was a box
[1:03:25] made of wood and then it was over laid
[1:03:28] with gold amen inside and outside
[1:03:31] speaking of the divine nature of Christ
[1:03:34] he would be God and man and how that he
[1:03:38] would come and and within that Ark was
[1:03:42] the was the Commandments was the two
[1:03:45] tables of stone Hallelujah now was one
[1:03:49] stone but two tables the new and the Old
[1:03:51] Testament was inside that Ark it was a
[1:03:54] type that Christ the man God would be
[1:03:58] word made flesh
[1:04:01] can you say man are you understanding
[1:04:08] a song a Solomon was building a temple
[1:04:11] and it was a magnificent Temple it would
[1:04:14] be a temple that wouldn't it would be a
[1:04:16] more permanent Dwelling Place it would
[1:04:19] be a grand place a grand Tabernacle that
[1:04:22] would be known and become famous all
[1:04:24] over the world and the god of Heaven
[1:04:26] would come and visit among his people
[1:04:28] can you say man
[1:04:30] and I I like looking at them
[1:04:33] at the amen the different uh
[1:04:36] characteristics of this temple in Iman
[1:04:39] and the many years that it took Solomon
[1:04:41] to build the temple amen did you know
[1:04:43] that there was material that was shipped
[1:04:45] from all over the world
[1:04:48] into Jerusalem amen it was a temple it
[1:04:53] was a uh there was material brought in
[1:04:57] from all the nations of the Earth
[1:04:59] and another thing that I want to I I
[1:05:02] thought was pretty fitting is everything
[1:05:04] was pre-cut
[1:05:06] that there was a a blueprint that was
[1:05:10] made up and they would cut the end and
[1:05:14] the the lumber and fashion the stones
[1:05:18] to pray to fit precisely into that
[1:05:21] building
[1:05:23] did you know that the scripture says
[1:05:25] that there was not the buzz of us all
[1:05:28] or a ding of a hammer
[1:05:30] the entire time that they were putting
[1:05:33] that building together
[1:05:35] amen there in First Corinthians or first
[1:05:38] first Kings six and seven and it says in
[1:05:41] the house when it was in building
[1:05:43] was built of stone made ready before it
[1:05:47] was brought thither
[1:05:48] and so that there was neither Hammer nor
[1:05:52] ax nor any tool of iron heard in the
[1:05:55] house while it was in the building
[1:05:58] now think about that
[1:06:07] are a hammer that was ever hit on the
[1:06:10] property there was never an ax that was
[1:06:13] used it was also precisely put together
[1:06:17] that when they got together they just
[1:06:21] simply put the kit together
[1:06:25] you say brother Wendell what are you
[1:06:27] trying to say here you see
[1:06:29] the scripture says that you are the
[1:06:32] Tabernacle of the Living God
[1:06:35] are Lively Stones you I want to say here
[1:06:39] this morning amen that you are the
[1:06:42] Living Stones you're a predestinated
[1:06:45] people God has placed you in his
[1:06:49] building just exactly where you belong
[1:06:53] you see Solomon's billing was an
[1:06:55] incredible building
[1:06:57] but what did what what did the scripture
[1:06:59] say Amen if you were to to to read there
[1:07:03] in amen uh acts 7 and 47 it says but
[1:07:07] Solomon built him in house albeit the
[1:07:10] most high dwelleth not in temples made
[1:07:12] with hands as saith the prophet Heaven
[1:07:16] is my throne and Earth is my full
[1:07:18] footstool what house will you build me
[1:07:21] saith the Lord what is the place of my
[1:07:24] rest hath not my hand made these things
[1:07:27] when Jesus came he said sacrifices and
[1:07:31] offering thou wouldest not but a body
[1:07:34] body thou has prepared for me
[1:07:39] they're in they're in First Corinthians
[1:07:41] the 13th chapter I believe it is or the
[1:07:43] sixth chapter I'm sorry amen and the
[1:07:45] 19th verse the Apostle Paul says what no
[1:07:48] you not that your body is the Temple of
[1:07:52] the Holy Ghost which is in you which you
[1:07:55] have of God you are not your own you are
[1:07:58] brought with a price therefore glorify
[1:08:01] God in your body and in your spirit
[1:08:03] which are gods
[1:08:07] you see it wasn't God's desire to live
[1:08:10] in a great big amen the Mormon
[1:08:13] Tabernacle there in Utah
[1:08:16] it's not God's desire to to to to live
[1:08:19] in the Great Big Majestic Temple there
[1:08:22] in Jerusalem
[1:08:25] God was going to live
[1:08:27] in another Temple
[1:08:29] it was going to be a holy Temple it was
[1:08:31] going to be
[1:08:33] it was going to be a fleshly temple
[1:08:35] it was going to be made of mortal men
[1:08:38] and women boys and girls a temple that
[1:08:42] the Holy Spirit could it would be a
[1:08:44] living Temple
[1:08:46] oh can you say Amen
[1:08:48] amen yes sir oh how we should be
[1:08:51] surrendered in our hearts today how
[1:08:53] there should be a surrender saying God I
[1:08:56] want to fit exactly where you want me to
[1:08:59] fit in your kingdom I want your spirit
[1:09:02] to so live and abide and move and and it
[1:09:06] was in me
[1:09:08] can you say Amen a total surrender to
[1:09:12] God's will
[1:09:13] the
[1:09:15] Apostle Peter
[1:09:16] man says that you are living stones
[1:09:20] and that you make up the temple of the
[1:09:23] Living God well praise the Lord
[1:09:26] you see what a type
[1:09:31] that God has already
[1:09:35] designed you for the age that you live
[1:09:38] in
[1:09:40] has already designed your gift your
[1:09:44] talent your calling everything about you
[1:09:47] has been ordered and designed of God
[1:09:53] sometimes you wonder
[1:09:54] amen where do I fit in
[1:09:58] I want to tell you you're going you fit
[1:10:00] in
[1:10:01] sometimes you think I'm just the oddest
[1:10:03] person in the church
[1:10:05] amen no one loves me or amen I just wish
[1:10:08] that I was a little I wish I could just
[1:10:10] fit in the click a little bit more you
[1:10:13] know God gives us nature sometimes as
[1:10:15] just a little bit odd and that's okay
[1:10:18] William Branham was just a little bit
[1:10:20] odd compared to all of the other
[1:10:21] preachers Jesus was just a little bit
[1:10:24] odd compared to a lot of others amen
[1:10:27] Saint Peter was just a little bit odd
[1:10:29] compared to the rest of the eleven
[1:10:32] can you say Amen sometimes we're wanting
[1:10:35] to fit in sometimes we want to be
[1:10:37] somebody else no God's ordained you
[1:10:39] God's called you God's designed you and
[1:10:42] there is no way the kingdom of God can
[1:10:44] work there's no way this church can
[1:10:46] survive there's no way that we can come
[1:10:49] into a completion and a Perfection like
[1:10:51] this body of Believers is ordained to do
[1:10:53] without your peculiarness
[1:10:58] we need you
[1:11:01] well can you say man
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:05] you see you as a stone was ordained of
[1:11:10] God
[1:11:11] you see my brother Wendell I'm so
[1:11:12] different Hallelujah
[1:11:14] that means you're going to matter

[1:11:25] orgains you to have a part is that right
[1:11:29] not everybody can be singers not
[1:11:31] everybody can be musicians not everybody
[1:11:33] can be preachers but we must all accept
[1:11:37] that God has placed us
[1:11:39] in his kingdom
[1:11:44] there were many stones can you imagine
[1:11:45] all of these thousands and thousands and
[1:11:48] thousands of stones that were all coming
[1:11:51] in
[1:11:52] and every one of those stones had a
[1:11:56] place
[1:11:57] amen many of those stones looked odd
[1:12:01] but there was a place in the temple for
[1:12:04] every God peculiar Stone God had a place
[1:12:08] for them can I hear a great big amen
[1:12:12] it's a beautiful type because our
[1:12:14] Ministries which is amen it's an
[1:12:16] anti-type it shows that our peculiarity
[1:12:20] our way of worship amen our our out of
[1:12:25] the way we are designed the way that
[1:12:27] we're built the way that we think

[1:15:41] of the body of Christ
[1:15:43] till we all come into the unity of the
[1:15:46] faith of the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:15:49] unto a perfect man somebody say perfect
[1:15:52] man unto the measure of the stature of
[1:15:56] the fullness of Christ Christ was the
[1:15:59] body of God singular you and I are the
[1:16:04] body of God plural we are members of one
[1:16:09] body let's go to the next verse there
[1:16:11] and then henceforth be no more children
[1:16:13] tossed to and fro carried about with
[1:16:16] every window Doctrine by the slide of
[1:16:17] men in the cunning craftiness whereby
[1:16:19] they lie in sieve and lie and wait to
[1:16:21] deceive speaking the truth in love may
[1:16:24] grow up into him in all things which is
[1:16:29] the head
[1:16:30] even Christ
[1:16:32] can you say Amen there's my scripture
[1:16:34] for from the home the whole body
[1:16:38] somebody say the whole body
[1:16:40] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:16:45] that which every joint supplyeth
[1:16:48] according to the effectual working in
[1:16:51] the measure of every somebody say every
[1:16:54] part

[1:16:59] edifying
[1:17:00] of itself in love
[1:17:03] can you say Amen
[1:17:04] so I can't say the hand can't say Amen
[1:17:08] well I don't have no need of you or the
[1:17:10] the toe can't say it because I'm not the
[1:17:12] eye I don't no we are all in this
[1:17:16] together the building of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:19] Christ
[1:17:21] brother Brennan would say I think in the
[1:17:24] building today of the spiritual house
[1:17:25] that God worships in
[1:17:28] I think that's been a great failure
[1:17:30] today among the builders we have come
[1:17:33] with our denominations and have laid
[1:17:35] them in sincerity we have sent our boys
[1:17:37] to school to educate them to speak well
[1:17:39] before a congregation learn them
[1:17:42] psychology and Bible History and we have
[1:17:45] did everything and built fine pews and
[1:17:48] made towering Steeples and beautiful
[1:17:50] music and so forth we have built but we
[1:17:53] find out that there's something wrong
[1:17:55] we've tried to build it out of man-made
[1:17:58] material
[1:17:59] what education could produce what
[1:18:01] seminaries could bring out of them what
[1:18:03] scholarship we've tried to build it upon
[1:18:07] education upon scholarship upon
[1:18:08] denomination all these things will not
[1:18:10] work as long as we have not accepted the
[1:18:12] odd storm The Peculiar Stone and we know
[1:18:15] that as the Cornerstone Christ Jesus
[1:18:18] but as the building began to materialize
[1:18:20] they realized that the hall was left and
[1:18:23] the Odd Stone
[1:18:24] fit it to the DOT
[1:18:26] and that's where the spiritual Builders
[1:18:28] are today that's why the bride building
[1:18:30] of Christ is not ready for the
[1:18:32] bridegroom is because the builders have
[1:18:34] rejected the Chief Cornerstone which was
[1:18:36] laid on the day of Pentecost which is
[1:18:38] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:40] it's been odd people act funny they
[1:18:43] don't they don't come into the order of
[1:18:45] our psychology of our educational our
[1:18:48] learning our Creeds that don't fit in
[1:18:50] there they've kicked it out because it
[1:18:52] was too odd too peculiar too
[1:18:55] disagreeable with the plans that we have
[1:18:57] made is the ideas of what the church
[1:18:59] ought to be and it ought to be a group
[1:19:01] they say it's all to be a group of
[1:19:03] polished Scholars it ought to be a group
[1:19:04] of fine dress people it ought to be a
[1:19:06] group of something where where we have
[1:19:08] tried to make an educational program or
[1:19:10] something that we could please our five
[1:19:12] senses something that we could see taste
[1:19:14] feel or something most of it has been
[1:19:17] through the site look at our fine people
[1:19:20] look at our best crowds in the city the
[1:19:22] mayor comes to our place the executive
[1:19:24] of our city the chief of police comes to
[1:19:26] our church
[1:19:27] and then we find out that it comes down
[1:19:30] to the actual building and all we've got
[1:19:32] is mortar and some rock the building did
[1:19:35] not go on they rejected the way the
[1:19:37] stone had been so prepared the stone
[1:19:40] that God had so prepared for it they
[1:19:42] rejected it can you say amen amen now
[1:19:48] God we find that in the in in laodicea
[1:19:51] today
[1:19:52] we have found that the Chief Cornerstone
[1:19:56] Jesus Christ the word the Living God the
[1:19:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost is not where
[1:20:02] it need can we can you say man
[1:20:05] but I want to say today
[1:20:07] that God's got God God still got a
[1:20:09] building
[1:20:11] and those denominations might have
[1:20:13] pushed him out and those others might
[1:20:14] have pushed him out there is a people
[1:20:17] though in minority
[1:20:19] that is going to say God put me in your
[1:20:21] building
[1:20:23] put me in your bill use me now I want to
[1:20:26] tell you I don't care whether you're a
[1:20:27] little kid or whether you're you're
[1:20:28] you're an elder it doesn't matter God's
[1:20:31] got a purpose for you or you would not
[1:20:34] be here
[1:20:36] God's got a place for you or you would
[1:20:40] not be here he has designed you what can
[1:20:43] you say man amen what kind of a house is
[1:20:46] God going to live in it's not a big
[1:20:48] building with a big Bell on the top of
[1:20:51] it amen it's not a high steeple but a
[1:20:55] body thou has prepared me it's a body
[1:20:59] that God can walk in it's a body that
[1:21:02] God can see in it's a body that God can
[1:21:06] talk in it's a body that God can work in
[1:21:09] it's a living body of Jesus Christ
[1:21:13] Church of the Living God I say today
[1:21:16] Amen Let us let us remember that without
[1:21:21] me without you this church cannot thrive
[1:21:27] can you say Amen
[1:21:29] but it's a life that's in Christ be in
[1:21:31] you it shall Quicken you
[1:21:34] now
[1:21:35] Iman
[1:21:37] we look here
[1:21:40] David prophesied
[1:21:42] they're in Psalms 46.
[1:21:44] and four
[1:21:46] not talking about a temple but he was
[1:21:49] talking about the Temple's plural of God
[1:21:51] if you look there at
[1:21:52] Psalms 46 and 4 it says there is a river
[1:21:56] the streams whereof shall make glad the
[1:21:59] city of God
[1:22:01] and the holy place of the Tabernacles
[1:22:03] plural
[1:22:04] of the most high
[1:22:06] God
[1:22:08] is in the midst of her
[1:22:11] and she shall not be moved God shall
[1:22:15] help her
[1:22:16] and that ride early
[1:22:18] you see this church building this
[1:22:20] morning is simply the meeting place of
[1:22:22] the Tabernacles of God
[1:22:25] this is just simply the meeting place
[1:22:27] this is where all the Tabernacles of God
[1:22:28] come in
[1:22:29] and the Shekinah Glory comes Among Us
[1:22:33] through the temple of God
[1:22:35] the Holy Spirit lives in you
[1:22:37] what we must that
[1:22:40] Paul
[1:22:42] he he oh he he he he's so demonstrated
[1:22:45] that that the church must work
[1:22:48] effectually together that when the gifts
[1:22:51] come together amen we we should all feel
[1:22:56] like we have a part
[1:22:58] right not just a song leader singing and
[1:23:01] a preacher preaching
[1:23:03] but that we all belong into this great
[1:23:06] body of God
[1:23:08] we want every gift in this church
[1:23:12] to be used to its fullest
[1:23:14] whether it's in song
[1:23:17] whether it's in music
[1:23:19] whether it's in amen ushering or
[1:23:23] or or
[1:23:25] checking on the elderly or
[1:23:28] being a deacon or a trustee
[1:23:32] we must dedicate
[1:23:35] ourself with great sincerity
[1:23:38] to what God has called us to be
[1:23:43] praise the Lord
[1:23:45] did you know that even you singers
[1:23:48] that there was high priority placed on
[1:23:51] over the singers did you know that
[1:23:58] that singers
[1:24:00] that would go ahead
[1:24:03] did you know
[1:24:05] that there were sinner
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:11] did you know that Levites we're singers
[1:24:17] and musicians now we sometimes we look
[1:24:19] at the Levites as just the preachers but
[1:24:21] there were also Levites that were
[1:24:23] singers and musicians
[1:24:26] and those singers and musicians
[1:24:30] had to be consecrated just the same as
[1:24:35] every other priest
[1:24:40] well it don't matter what lifestyle I
[1:24:42] live I'm a singer hey I'm not a preacher
[1:24:45] you are required the same dedication
[1:24:54] if the preacher has to prepare and the
[1:24:57] song leader has to prepare in prayer
[1:25:00] every musician should be preparing in
[1:25:02] prayer
[1:25:06] every singer should be in prayer listen
[1:25:08] you've been given a gift
[1:25:12] don't just use your songs and and and
[1:25:14] and and still singing songs that you
[1:25:16] learned 20 years ago amen be fresh let
[1:25:20] your gift let your gift be real you say
[1:25:23] brother Wendell that's you ought to
[1:25:25] learn that one amen
[1:25:27] hahaha
[1:25:29] no you got to keep singing that song you
[1:25:32] that we like your song brother Michael
[1:25:33] amen
[1:25:38] Michael and Joel Forney is the only one
[1:25:40] that can get by was singing the same
[1:25:42] song Amen
[1:25:44] [Laughter]
[1:25:49] given you
[1:25:50] I think I think we ought to be serious
[1:25:54] with our gifts
[1:25:56] praise the Lord
[1:25:58] we should be powerful in choosing our
[1:26:01] songs
[1:26:02] I I I I don't think we should just get
[1:26:04] up and sing songs because they rhyme
[1:26:07] I think we need songs that can bring the
[1:26:09] glory of the Lord down that can
[1:26:11] encourage the bride in her position
[1:26:14] because we are in the very last of the
[1:26:18] milliseconds of time and what we do

[1:26:56] the enemy The Last Enemy is death
[1:27:02] death has spiritual death has struck all
[1:27:05] of the churches it is totally strictly
[1:27:08] odyssia until people have no conscience
[1:27:11] they have no conscience at all they can
[1:27:13] claim to be a man they can claimed to
[1:27:16] love God and carry his word and and
[1:27:19] still they man be lesbians and
[1:27:22] homosexuals and and still live filthy
[1:27:24] lives than in pure lives their

[1:27:39] you you you live in a world of
[1:27:43] lukewarmness and godlessness you live in

[1:28:35] be a bride without spot
[1:28:38] wrinkle
[1:28:41] or any such blemish
[1:28:43] he's coming after one that is subject to
[1:28:47] him as the head
[1:28:49] he's coming to one who has made him the
[1:28:52] headship what can you say man
[1:28:54] everything about my life it should be
[1:28:56] done in seriousness it should be done in
[1:28:58] prayer there should be prayer ringing
[1:29:01] all the time in the homes of the elect
[1:29:05] because this is the Midnight Cry
[1:29:08] him and the Death Angel is passing over
[1:29:10] it's already struck all of the world it

[1:29:21] church that is not under the blood of
[1:29:23] Jesus Christ it'll strike anybody in
[1:29:26] this church that is not right with God
[1:29:31] the death angel don't matter it don't
[1:29:33] matter it don't matter whether you
[1:29:34] belong to this Tabernacle here this is
[1:29:37] just a shell
[1:29:39] what matters
[1:29:40] is the God of all glory living in you
[1:29:44] are you a tabernacle
[1:29:46] for the most high God
[1:29:48] can you say math
[1:29:50] amen
[1:29:52] now let me just be a singer
[1:29:54] let me be a consecrated singer
[1:29:57] don't let me just be a man
[1:30:01] you know a a cleaner one that's cleaning
[1:30:04] the the church
[1:30:06] now let me just be hey man one that is
[1:30:09] that that is you know
[1:30:12] let me be a dedicated one
[1:30:16] let me be a consecrated one in
[1:30:18] everything that I do
[1:30:21] can you say man
[1:30:23] amen
[1:30:25] I want to be anointed
[1:30:28] I want to sing songs that are anointed
[1:30:31] I want the blessings of God
[1:30:34] because I am a priest
[1:30:38] and as a live I had or as a minister I
[1:30:41] am singing song and that anointing and
[1:30:44] that word must hit at the heart of
[1:30:47] somebody else
[1:30:49] that's the only reason I'm singing I'm a
[1:30:51] minister
[1:30:52] well praise the Lord
[1:30:55] amen they're in first Chronicles
[1:30:59] they're 25 and one this is moreover
[1:31:01] David
[1:31:03] and the captains of the host separated
[1:31:05] to the service of the sons of asaph and
[1:31:08] human and uh Jennifer
[1:31:12] who should prophesy with harps
[1:31:14] with sultry
[1:31:16] and with
[1:31:17] symbols
[1:31:19] now this is amazing because when you
[1:31:22] when you look at it it's not that they
[1:31:24] are going to be prophesying
[1:31:27] as in a prophet prophesying
[1:31:30] Iman but you see
[1:31:33] there with their music there is
[1:31:36] something that is that is coming coming
[1:31:39] out it's it's an expression should
[1:31:43] prophesy in other words should accompany
[1:31:45] their music and their instruments
[1:31:49] you're prophesying how
[1:31:52] am I prophesying with music
[1:31:56] you're taking the word of the Lord just
[1:31:58] as God said there in the book of uh in
[1:32:00] there in in Revelations 10
[1:32:03] and and nine for Thou shalt prophesy
[1:32:07] again
[1:32:09] it's not that you're a prophet it's not
[1:32:12] that but you are taking the revealed
[1:32:15] word of the hour you're singing it
[1:32:18] you're putting it on your music you're
[1:32:21] putting it in your vocal course you are
[1:32:24] prophesying the words of the Lord to the
[1:32:28] people
[1:32:31] I've been in Services where the
[1:32:33] anointing so comes upon a singer as he
[1:32:36] or she is singing the glory of the Lord
[1:32:39] so come down in that church
[1:32:43] the people would just begin to weep
[1:32:46] they have seen people fall prostrate
[1:32:49] or just all over the building laying
[1:32:52] down
[1:32:53] in such reverence and respect
[1:32:58] coming from a song
[1:33:00] he said well we don't believe in songs
[1:33:01] brother when we just believe in the word
[1:33:03] well your Prophet believed in songs
[1:33:06] and the Bible believed in songs
[1:33:09] I believe in songs and so should you
[1:33:13] anointed songs
[1:33:16] that can bring the presence of the Lord
[1:33:19] down in the congregation oh can you say
[1:33:21] Amen
[1:33:22] you could go on down and and and and you
[1:33:25] know it goes down to the second verse of
[1:33:27] the amen of the sons of asaph and it
[1:33:31] talks about the singers which prophesied
[1:33:34] according to the order of the king and
[1:33:36] then the third verse amen it's it's
[1:33:38] talking about the sons of uh Jennifer
[1:33:40] and goes on down and it says at the end
[1:33:43] who prophesied with the harp to give
[1:33:45] thanks and to praise the Lord amen and
[1:33:49] you go on down to the fifth verse and
[1:33:52] Herman has has 14 sons and three
[1:33:56] daughters and the Bible says all these
[1:33:58] were under the hands of their father the
[1:34:00] sixth verse for a song in the house of
[1:34:03] the Lord with symbols and sultries and
[1:34:05] harps for the service of the Lord can
[1:34:08] you see man
[1:34:10] and the total of everyone that was there
[1:34:12] was 204 score and eight
[1:34:15] that would come in
[1:34:17] and would worship
[1:34:19] they would come in and sing the songs
[1:34:21] that was quite it must have been quite a
[1:34:24] band quite a it was quite the deal
[1:34:26] can you say Amen
[1:34:28] you see but they had to be consecrated
[1:34:31] dedicated to the Lord is this okay this
[1:34:35] morning
[1:34:36] you see what we want we want the
[1:34:40] presence
[1:34:42] of the Lord
[1:34:44] when Solomon got through building his
[1:34:46] house and it was a it was a beautiful
[1:34:47] glorious Temple
[1:34:50] but yet it was an empty Temple
[1:34:52] it had it had all of the furniture in it
[1:34:54] but it was an empty Temple
[1:34:57] and the Bible said that when Solomon
[1:35:00] killed I can't remember how many how
[1:35:03] many uh uh
[1:35:04] sacrifices he offered but they were
[1:35:06] thousands of sacrifices
[1:35:09] and as the blood of the Bulls and the
[1:35:12] goats were where where where where amen
[1:35:15] were sacrificed and the blood was
[1:35:17] rolling and the spirits of those Lambs
[1:35:20] was coming off
[1:35:22] the Bible says
[1:35:24] that God came into the temple
[1:35:30] the Shekinah presence of God so come
[1:35:32] into Solomon's Temple that the priest
[1:35:34] could not even Minister anymore
[1:35:36] the glory of the Lord the blood of bulls
[1:35:39] and goats because they were so at one
[1:35:42] with their call and their desire they
[1:35:46] were so at one and their willingness to
[1:35:48] make this go and it's it's an incredible
[1:35:50] story if you go back and look at the
[1:35:52] history if you go back and read these
[1:35:54] scriptures
[1:35:56] when you looked here at
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:02] come down so strongly
[1:36:06] I'd love to see the glory of the Lord
[1:36:07] come down strongly
[1:36:10] I'd love to for this for this place to
[1:36:13] be such
[1:36:14] a beautiful place that for God not a
[1:36:17] beautiful place because of the beautiful
[1:36:19] building but a beautiful place because
[1:36:21] of the character of the people
[1:36:23] a beautiful place because all of the
[1:36:25] Tabernacles
[1:36:26] amen are all coming in together the
[1:36:30] character and the beauty of the people
[1:36:31] and God being so pleased with what we
[1:36:34] are and what he's made us to be oh can
[1:36:37] you say amen hallelujah and emplacing us
[1:36:40] and molding us and making us in his
[1:36:43] place
[1:36:44] oh my
[1:36:46] they're in second chronicles the fifth
[1:36:48] chapter it's got 14 verses and I'm not
[1:36:50] going to read it but
[1:36:52] you man if you you could you could look
[1:36:54] there when Solomon had finished the
[1:36:56] house and everything that was dedicated
[1:36:58] and everything was in place and he made
[1:37:01] sure everything was right according to
[1:37:03] the word of God
[1:37:05] and that's when the glory of God
[1:37:08] came down
[1:37:10] can you say man
[1:37:12] amen
[1:37:14] and and if you were to break in and and
[1:37:17] uh amen it you know they said that the
[1:37:21] uh man uh we just we just go ahead and
[1:37:26] these men started this seventh verse
[1:37:28] they're in a second chronicles five and
[1:37:31] seven
[1:37:32] it says then the priest and brought in
[1:37:34] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and
[1:37:36] to its place to the Oracles of the house
[1:37:39] into the most holy place even under the
[1:37:41] wings of the cherubims and the cherubim
[1:37:43] spread forth their wings over the place
[1:37:44] of the Ark and the cherubims covered the
[1:37:46] ark and the staves thereof above and
[1:37:49] they drew out the staves of the Ark and
[1:37:51] the ends of the staves were seen from
[1:37:53] the ark before the oracles but they were
[1:37:56] not seen without
[1:37:58] and there it is unto this day and there
[1:38:01] was nothing in the ark save the two
[1:38:04] tables which Moses put in at horrible
[1:38:06] therein in horrible when the Lord made a
[1:38:09] covenant with Israel children of Israel
[1:38:11] when they came out of Egypt and it came
[1:38:13] to pass when the priests came out out of
[1:38:16] the Holy place for all the priests that
[1:38:18] were present were Sanctified and did not
[1:38:21] wait but course and also the Levites
[1:38:23] which were the singers and all of them
[1:38:25] of asaph and him and Gibson with their
[1:38:30] sons and their the Brethren being a raid
[1:38:33] in white linen having symbols and
[1:38:34] sultries and harps stood at the East End
[1:38:36] of the altar with them 120 priests
[1:38:39] sounding with the trumpets
[1:38:41] then it came even to pass as the
[1:38:43] trumpeters and the singers were as one
[1:38:45] to make one sound to be heard in
[1:38:47] praising and thanking the lord
[1:38:49] when they lifted up their voice with the
[1:38:51] trumpets and the symbols and the music
[1:38:52] instruments of music and praise the Lord
[1:38:55] saying for he is good for his mercy
[1:38:57] endureth forever
[1:38:58] that then the house was filled with a
[1:39:01] cloud
[1:39:02] even the house of the Lord so that the
[1:39:04] priest could not stand
[1:39:06] to minister by reason
[1:39:08] of the cloud for the glory of the Lord
[1:39:12] had filled the house of God
[1:39:15] if that can be done through the Bulls of
[1:39:17] goat and a temporal Tabernacle how much
[1:39:19] more
[1:39:20] right here today
[1:39:24] worship brings us into his presence and
[1:39:26] so I wanted to
[1:39:28] I wanted to bring that in this morning
[1:39:30] as we as we are still talking about the
[1:39:33] divine order of the house of God
[1:39:35] and I wanted you singers and you
[1:39:37] musicians to know how sacred
[1:39:40] of a call your gift is
[1:39:44] amen
[1:39:46] how sacred you're called
[1:39:49] is is that right
[1:39:53] I I think we have wonderful
[1:39:58] musicians and wonderful singers I think
[1:40:00] we have
[1:40:02] we have wonderful song leaders
[1:40:05] I I
[1:40:07] think leaders of worship
[1:40:10] leaders of worship should be uh
[1:40:12] prayerful
[1:40:14] I I think that
[1:40:16] I think every song leader should should
[1:40:19] be a well adapted into entering into
[1:40:22] that Supernatural rim with God
[1:40:25] because if you've not been there and if
[1:40:27] you're not there on a regular basis
[1:40:29] communing with God and you don't know
[1:40:31] how to come into His presence how are
[1:40:34] you going to lead people into his
[1:40:35] presence
[1:40:37] you've got to come into His pre you've
[1:40:39] got to know how to get the people there
[1:40:41] and the only way you can get the people
[1:40:43] there is to come out in his presence
[1:40:46] and bringing them lifting them out of
[1:40:49] this Rim into that most holy place with
[1:40:53] God come on
[1:41:02] this building right now
[1:41:04] but some have never entered into that
[1:41:06] Realm
[1:41:08] and we must enter into that Realm can
[1:41:11] you say Amen
[1:41:12] so those those of you you you song
[1:41:15] leaders
[1:41:17] I I just as we as we are going through
[1:41:21] some of these things back through some
[1:41:24] of the basics
[1:41:26] remember Brothers
[1:41:28] that you who help to create that
[1:41:30] atmosphere for the word
[1:41:33] you sound
[1:41:39] must not hear the word with this
[1:41:43] they must hear the word with this
[1:41:45] and depending on what atmosphere is in
[1:41:48] the building
[1:41:49] is what takes place whether it's here or
[1:41:51] here well praise the Lord
[1:41:55] I think that the the the the the the
[1:41:56] song leaders
[1:41:59] should know how to enter into that
[1:42:01] presence of God I think every preacher
[1:42:04] you don't just sit down and read your
[1:42:06] Bible and get your computer out and put
[1:42:08] you a sermon together I think every
[1:42:11] preacher needs to be anointed of God
[1:42:14] now listen
[1:42:17] you say well that's just not no no no no
[1:42:19] no no
[1:42:20] every preacher must be anointed
[1:42:25] I don't care whether he's a teacher
[1:42:28] evangelist
[1:42:33] yes sir whether it's just a a minister
[1:42:36] as a as the helps here at a local
[1:42:38] congregation we should all know how to
[1:42:44] come under the anointing
[1:42:47] not just reading notes
[1:42:50] not just saying words
[1:42:52] but where the unction of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:55] comes down and makes those words live
[1:42:59] praise the Lord
[1:43:02] because everything about us
[1:43:04] is for his presence
[1:43:07] amen
[1:43:09] but now I'm not just putting that on the
[1:43:10] preachers and the song leaders
[1:43:14] because the scripture says we are all
[1:43:16] Kings and Priests
[1:43:18] unto our God
[1:43:21] that means we've got a responsibility
[1:43:23] we've got to know how to enter in so
[1:43:25] when you've got well praise the Lord
[1:43:28] when you've got an anointed song leader
[1:43:31] and you've got an anointed preacher
[1:43:34] and the people
[1:43:36] are just there to listen to songs
[1:43:38] and they're there just to hear a sermon
[1:43:43] you ain't coming in
[1:43:45] because you're not consecrated
[1:43:50] well you say Amen to me while ago that
[1:43:52] these singers boy this yes sir they
[1:43:54] better be consecrated
[1:43:57] but you're a priest too
[1:44:00] you are the temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:06] that means Your Vessel must be
[1:44:11] consecrated
[1:44:15] that means you can't come in here and
[1:44:17] sit
[1:44:18] well praise the Lord
[1:44:20] I'm here you can't come in and sit on a
[1:44:23] Pew amen and you've been out there
[1:44:25] listening to your sports channel all the
[1:44:26] way up to the time that you walk into
[1:44:28] the church come in here and sit down and
[1:44:31] expect to feel the presence of the Lord
[1:44:35] that means you can't just come in and
[1:44:37] sit down and just you know just sit down
[1:44:39] on the preacher as if well
[1:44:43] Hallelujah
[1:44:45] man this is a boring service well where
[1:44:47] are you at
[1:44:51] it requires every one of us consecrated
[1:44:56] to God in our positions
[1:45:05] that brings his presence down Among Us
[1:45:11] so when the church why do we come early
[1:45:16] is because Lord knows you need it
[1:45:20] when you're coming in on a Wednesday
[1:45:21] night and you're just as carnal as the
[1:45:23] day is long can I hear it amen Brothers
[1:45:26] you've been working all day you're tired
[1:45:29] you're weary you're wore out you don't
[1:45:31] want to be here
[1:45:33] well you shouldn't even come
[1:45:35] if you can't prepare that heart to come
[1:45:37] why do we come on a Wednesday night
[1:45:40] is because you need him
[1:45:43] well why come why come
[1:45:46] if you're not going to enter into his
[1:45:47] presence
[1:45:51] why come to church any service and
[1:45:54] you're not willing to do what is
[1:45:56] required to enter into his presence
[1:46:00] I'm preaching better than you're a man
[1:46:05] the scripture says come into His courts
[1:46:09] with praise and into his gates with
[1:46:12] Thanksgiving
[1:46:15] [Applause]
[1:46:18] now that's that's that's Old Testament
[1:46:20] saying come into His courts with praise
[1:46:22] enter into his gates with Thanksgiving
[1:46:24] praise ye the Lord bless his name but
[1:46:26] the Apostle Paul says that you give
[1:46:30] praise or sacrifices
[1:46:33] of Praise by the lips
[1:46:36] of your mouth
[1:46:40] well praise the Lord
[1:46:42] so if I am a priest offering sacrifices
[1:46:46] then I am required to be dedicated are
[1:46:51] y'all with me
[1:46:52] so it don't matter whether it's the
[1:46:54] preacher behind the pulpit whether it's
[1:46:56] the song leader whether it's the
[1:46:58] musician or whether it's the
[1:47:00] congregation we must all be consecrated
[1:47:09] it takes all of us
[1:47:12] you know what the Catholic Church done
[1:47:15] the Catholic Church took all of the
[1:47:17] spirituality from the congregation
[1:47:20] he says you all shut up sat down
[1:47:24] we'll do your praying
[1:47:26] we'll do everything for you
[1:47:29] that's right
[1:47:31] they took all of the gifts out took all
[1:47:34] of everything out now there's a few
[1:47:36] sacred men that's anointed
[1:47:39] to take care of everything for you we'll
[1:47:40] do your praying we'll do your singing
[1:47:42] we'll do everything for you and all you
[1:47:44] have to do is just repeat after us a
[1:47:45] couple times a few times then go out
[1:47:47] there and sin
[1:47:52] that's the Catholic Church
[1:47:54] that was what you called nicolaitanism
[1:47:57] it was to conquer the laity the Catholic
[1:48:01] church that nicolaitan Spirit conquered
[1:48:05] the church till the church had no
[1:48:08] responsibility that God
[1:48:11] or each other
[1:48:13] it was now a few holy men that was
[1:48:16] dictating what they were going to do how
[1:48:18] they were going to do it and then they
[1:48:20] would all agree and say oh man go home
[1:48:23] and live like the devil
[1:48:25] praise the Lord
[1:48:28] what's different about laodicea now
[1:48:30] laodicea is the people's rights so the
[1:48:33] first church age that spirit that was
[1:48:36] striking the first church age was the
[1:48:38] amen was the spirit of Nicola which was
[1:48:40] to conquer the laity
[1:48:43] seven Church ages later now it's
[1:48:45] people's rights it was the it was the it
[1:48:49] was the clergyman saying shut up do what
[1:48:52] we say say some Hail Marys this that and
[1:48:55] the other
[1:48:56] took the word took the song took
[1:48:58] everything away from the people right
[1:49:00] but now we're in laodicea now the people
[1:49:06] Hallelujah the people are demanding that
[1:49:10] the preacher does it all
[1:49:15] now it's the people demanding
[1:49:18] entertainment
[1:49:20] now it's the preach now it's the people
[1:49:23] comes in sits on the Pew drinks their
[1:49:25] coffee
[1:49:27] amen
[1:49:28] checking their tax and their stocks and
[1:49:31] whatever else while the singers are
[1:49:33] entertaining and the preacher is
[1:49:36] compromising
[1:49:39] and they'll pay them they'll pay their
[1:49:42] fee to be in the service and go home
[1:49:43] that ain't Church
[1:49:49] before it was the Catholic hierarchy
[1:49:52] that was going to kill you
[1:49:54] if you don't buy
[1:49:56] now it's the church seven days later or
[1:49:58] seven Church ages later that said
[1:50:00] demanding
[1:50:01] the same thing
[1:50:03] that the first we'll praise the Lord
[1:50:08] amen
[1:50:10] and so now everyone just dismantling now
[1:50:12] Hallelujah you say thank God we don't
[1:50:14] belong to those kind of churches yeah
[1:50:16] but you bring that same Spirit into this
[1:50:17] one
[1:50:19] come in here and sit down and just act
[1:50:21] like I ain't got nothing to do yes you
[1:50:23] do
[1:50:24] you'd be better off going and drinking
[1:50:27] coffee with the guy down the road at his
[1:50:29] church
[1:50:30] than to come in and sit in the house of
[1:50:32] the Living God
[1:50:33] and not have no love and adoration and
[1:50:36] offer praise and sacrifices from the
[1:50:39] heart of genuine love and genuine
[1:50:42] worship thanking God for everything that
[1:50:45] he is in your life
[1:50:51] I want his
[1:50:52] friends in our church I want his friends
[1:50:54] in my life of what his presence to be
[1:50:57] found by all around me oh God I want
[1:51:02] your presence in me
[1:51:04] [Applause]
[1:51:08] but we're as selfish people living in a
[1:51:11] selfish culture
[1:51:13] and we demand everyone else to do it
[1:51:18] you can't find anyone that's willing to
[1:51:20] be servants as trustees anymore servant
[1:51:23] says Deacon what do I got in it what
[1:51:25] kind of money is in it what kind of
[1:51:26] person that's too much work for me I
[1:51:28] ain't doing it
[1:51:30] you can't find anyone that wants to to
[1:51:32] just lay it on the line
[1:51:35] I'm not necessarily talking about it
[1:51:36] here but I'm just saying people want it
[1:51:38] they want
[1:51:39] what's in it for me
[1:51:43] everything is without me what about the
[1:51:46] work of God
[1:51:50] well praise the Lord I told you I'm here
[1:51:59] we're just set empty dead
[1:52:03] it's because somebody
[1:52:06] has not had that consecrated life
[1:52:09] that'll keep his presence
[1:52:11] with us
[1:52:13] can I hear an amen
[1:52:16] consecrated lives
[1:52:18] keeps the Holy Ghost
[1:52:21] real
[1:52:23] therefore when it's all of the temples
[1:52:26] of God come together
[1:52:30] it's just like a great big Glory
[1:52:33] Festival
[1:52:34] the city of our God is made glad because
[1:52:37] all of the temples of God are together
[1:52:40] and we are in love
[1:52:44] can you say Amen
[1:52:47] amen
[1:52:49] yes the preacher needs to be consecrated
[1:52:51] this sacred desk should be held to the
[1:52:55] highest
[1:52:58] should not be any hypocritical lines
[1:53:00] behind this desk
[1:53:03] there should be no man preach the gospel
[1:53:06] living a sinful life
[1:53:10] but we are to be first partakers we are
[1:53:13] to be those that live that life before
[1:53:18] the people
[1:53:20] not amen and in the church but they can
[1:53:23] see it in our lives out those doors
[1:53:27] can you see mine
[1:53:29] the song leaders should be one that
[1:53:32] their lives reflect this
[1:53:36] not a hypocritical life
[1:53:39] not one that is that is that is that is
[1:53:42] singing and and and and and and and and
[1:53:44] you know
[1:53:46] anointed behind the pulpit but outside
[1:53:49] the doors there's something else
[1:53:56] oh God
[1:53:58] I don't care whether you're boys
[1:54:01] whether you're girls or whether you're
[1:54:03] grandpas and grandmas
[1:54:06] our lives have got to be dedicated to
[1:54:09] this cause
[1:54:12] I don't care whether you're a well-known
[1:54:15] preacher or a or a little known for each
[1:54:19] lies my screen flat the presence
[1:54:24] of God
[1:54:29] because it's the anointing upon us
[1:54:33] it's the anointing upon us
[1:54:36] that is that is going to break the yokes
[1:54:39] can you say man
[1:54:41] amen yes
[1:54:45] do you love him here today
[1:54:48] that's for the order
[1:54:51] of our of Our Lives
[1:54:54] order of our services depends upon the
[1:54:56] order of Our Lives
[1:55:01] I don't want to look back in yesteryears
[1:55:02] and say huh I remember the good old days
[1:55:09] I I want to say that the that the glory
[1:55:11] of the latter
[1:55:13] is greater than the glory of the former
[1:55:18] [Applause]
[1:55:25] I believe the supernatural should be in
[1:55:27] every service I believe that and I am
[1:55:29] willing to put myself on the line
[1:55:33] because it's not the preacher it's not
[1:55:34] the song leaders not just the musician
[1:55:36] but it's all of us together making this
[1:55:40] happen
[1:55:43] can you say Amen
[1:55:46] now
[1:55:49] we have a little bit different we we
[1:55:51] stand to sing
[1:55:54] we worship
[1:55:57] uh there's other churches might sit and
[1:56:00] sing and others but I've just always
[1:56:02] thought you know he's worthy of
[1:56:03] everything that we can give him
[1:56:05] all of us participate in it and all of
[1:56:08] us is that right
[1:56:09] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:56:11] God's blessed it and honored it over the
[1:56:13] years but while we're doing it
[1:56:16] man we'll see what some some people have
[1:56:18] got it all together where amen song
[1:56:20] leader don't even have to tell you to
[1:56:21] stand up you just jump up anyway as well
[1:56:23] he's fixing to ask so I'm going to do it
[1:56:25] before he asks amen
[1:56:28] there's nothing
[1:56:30] enthusiasm for the presence of God and
[1:56:34] enthusiasm to sing and well praise the
[1:56:37] Lord
[1:56:38] I don't believe it's a sin to to smile
[1:56:41] in church I don't believe it's a sin to
[1:56:43] to lift my hands up and glorify God I
[1:56:46] don't believe it's a sin a man to to
[1:56:49] distract the service
[1:56:51] myself
[1:56:53] through my through my prayer and praise
[1:56:56] can you say man
[1:56:58] amen
[1:56:59] so
[1:57:01] I think the divine order
[1:57:04] yes all of us
[1:57:07] have a responsibility
[1:57:11] now I've noticed something while we're
[1:57:12] on this and I'm
[1:57:14] and
[1:57:16] we have sort of
[1:57:19] gotten away with the opening prayer
[1:57:21] ain't no sorta about it we have gotten
[1:57:23] away I don't know how we've done it but
[1:57:26] it just well I know sometimes we'll just
[1:57:29] come up and start singing the song
[1:57:30] that's already been sung or played and
[1:57:32] then we but I think I think we should I
[1:57:35] think and
[1:57:36] um and all of our song leaders have done
[1:57:38] it we've just we've just overlooked it
[1:57:41] but we should start our services with
[1:57:43] prayer
[1:57:44] you know if they're singing and we can
[1:57:47] finish that song out or whatever and
[1:57:49] then
[1:57:50] have a have a word of Prayer
[1:57:54] I think that's I and and uh and that was
[1:57:57] something that was brought to my
[1:57:58] attention thanks to brother Ken amen
[1:58:01] and uh hey and that's a good that that's
[1:58:04] a good suggestion
[1:58:06] amen if we're a Christian church we
[1:58:08] ought to open with prayer amen
[1:58:11] now
[1:58:13] and then another thing that I would like
[1:58:15] to ask while we're here is this okay
[1:58:17] today
[1:58:20] I'm not too keen on doing the the
[1:58:22] praying for a prayer request and praying
[1:58:25] for the for you know the way that we
[1:58:27] just changed that around that that sort
[1:58:29] of I don't like that idea amen the
[1:58:32] monetary things needs to be a separate
[1:58:34] prayer and
[1:58:35] and and and and prayer for one another I
[1:58:39] I don't know how that got started but we
[1:58:41] but what I would like to do is we could
[1:58:43] start bringing our
[1:58:45] we could start bringing our prayer
[1:58:47] request
[1:58:48] right break before the people right at
[1:58:51] the beginning of the church service for
[1:58:52] for you uh song leaders and that way we
[1:58:54] could we just do it right there as we're
[1:58:56] praying opening the service in prayer we
[1:58:58] can pray for the people
[1:59:00] and then later on if uh and hey it's
[1:59:03] it's it's it's okay to pray more than
[1:59:05] once in church
[1:59:07] and then and then we pray over the
[1:59:09] offering the offering is is something
[1:59:11] that we need to pray over that's that's
[1:59:12] for sure because that's where we're
[1:59:14] we're doing it as unto the Lord it is it
[1:59:18] is an offering it's it's it's it's
[1:59:20] something that you offer unto the Lord
[1:59:22] y'all understand that
[1:59:24] and we want God's blessings upon that
[1:59:27] and um uh so but but I I think that the
[1:59:31] you know we could start it with a prayer
[1:59:32] request and then and and just start
[1:59:34] right at the beginning and if brother
[1:59:36] Merle or brother Kobe or whoever's
[1:59:38] leading songs wants to um you know have
[1:59:40] someone to come up and start the service
[1:59:42] off with prayer I I you know I think
[1:59:44] that's fine too uh uh or or you don't
[1:59:46] have to you can do it yourself but but
[1:59:48] the thing is I what I what I like is
[1:59:51] just to keep that order we want to keep
[1:59:54] the order flowing
[1:59:56] if you notice we try to keep things
[1:59:58] flowing I I don't I don't like a song
[2:00:00] leader having everyone sat down you know
[2:00:03] you can be seated and now we want
[2:00:05] brother semi to come up and um and sing
[2:00:08] and see me saying huh I don't have a
[2:00:10] song prepared I've got to go find my
[2:00:12] phone I've got to go do this and then
[2:00:15] we're okay let's sing it one no let's
[2:00:16] just let's have let's let semi know
[2:00:19] ahead of time that he's going to be
[2:00:20] singing and then say semi if you would
[2:00:22] get ready and then we'll continue to
[2:00:24] sing the song and while he's over here
[2:00:27] and brother Harry's helping him get his
[2:00:29] microphone and then when that song stops
[2:00:32] then it's ready to go and and
[2:00:34] everything's flowing if you all notice
[2:00:35] that's why we try to do it around here
[2:00:36] we try to keep it flowing
[2:00:39] why because we we with this this ain't
[2:00:42] entertainment this is worship
[2:00:45] and when he comes up
[2:00:47] Simmy I want I assume he's already
[2:00:50] praying Lord let me be anointed Lord I
[2:00:54] Surrender my voice I Surrender my mind
[2:00:56] to you help me Lord
[2:00:58] and when he comes up and the anointing
[2:01:00] that's already on the musicians and the
[2:01:02] anointing that semi's already in because
[2:01:04] he's already been asked to sing he's
[2:01:07] prepared he's ready to go now the
[2:01:11] anointing and what it does there's no
[2:01:13] break in the continuity the presence of
[2:01:16] the Lord is still continuing
[2:01:18] y'all understand what I'm saying that
[2:01:20] way we can keep and I and I and I I
[2:01:23] learned that I I I I I I got to be
[2:01:26] honest I'm not the originator of that
[2:01:27] amen I I found that at brother brother
[2:01:30] musgrove's church and I I loved I loved
[2:01:34] the order I loved the the continuity and
[2:01:37] I and I came in and said I'd like to do
[2:01:40] that where we just sort of where we
[2:01:42] where we keep the continuity going and
[2:01:45] everything is Flowing the people yes
[2:01:48] it's another gift being used but it is a
[2:01:52] gift
[2:01:56] right because it's a gift I don't care
[2:02:00] whether it's the children singing or
[2:02:02] whether it's it's it's it's it whether
[2:02:04] it's a a professional singer or whether
[2:02:06] it's a an amateur singer it don't matter
[2:02:09] the anointing is what we're after
[2:02:12] you say ah well you said we have to be
[2:02:14] prepared but listen prepared in the
[2:02:17] presence of the Lord is not being
[2:02:19] prepared with your vocal doing scales on
[2:02:22] in your vocal cords before you get up
[2:02:23] there
[2:02:24] I'm talking about we want the anointing
[2:02:27] of the Lord no matter where and what we
[2:02:31] well am I doing all right
[2:02:34] Hallelujah
[2:02:35] [Applause]
[2:02:37] I want that because our whole reason for
[2:02:41] being here
[2:02:42] dear God I hope you all have that same
[2:02:45] desire
[2:02:46] her whole purpose were coming
[2:02:49] is his presence
[2:02:52] that's our whole purpose
[2:02:56] I want him to be pleased in my life
[2:03:00] and I have to take care of business
[2:03:01] before I even come to church in order
[2:03:04] for that
[2:03:05] I have to live a consecrated life before

[2:03:11] and then I'm preparing throughout the
[2:03:13] week

[2:03:16] when the Martin's got to spend time in

[2:03:27] them all
[2:03:28] I'm representing the word itself
[2:03:31] is that right

[2:06:48] musicians my house shall be called the
[2:06:51] house of

[2:07:00] together
[2:07:04] I'll tell you right now I'm not good
[2:07:06] enough to preach A good sermon you know
[2:07:08] that
[2:07:09] but it's the prayers of the people
[2:07:12] that can help their Pastor friends I
[2:07:15] need your prayer
[2:07:17] sometimes the weight gets a little heavy
[2:07:18] and I just sometimes it's just Spirits
[2:07:21] even when things are going good and
[2:07:22] spirits will will try to attack me as as
[2:07:25] as pastor
[2:07:30] brink of crying all the time you know
[2:07:33] and I know what that is that's a that's
[2:07:35] a devil of depression trying to take
[2:07:37] over Wendell Martin
[2:07:40] well if I'm if I'm Bound by the devil
[2:07:42] how can I free anybody else
[2:07:46] well praise the Lord
[2:07:48] but prayer for one another prayer for
[2:07:51] your pastor prayer for these leaders
[2:07:53] prayer for these officers of the church
[2:07:55] prayer and and and and we're all praying
[2:07:58] for one another
[2:08:01] can you say Amen
[2:08:03] now
[2:08:04] I think that should be that should be
[2:08:06] wonderful
[2:08:08] so we want to keep that and and
[2:08:13] and wow and and the ushers should be
[2:08:17] looking to the deacon uh for
[2:08:20] for the uh
[2:08:23] you know guidance and and and and just
[2:08:26] making sure that that we've got the
[2:08:27] Deacon's mind and and and and keeping
[2:08:30] things together because we we have
[2:08:33] elected a deacon and that Deacon is
[2:08:37] there to make sure that everything is
[2:08:40] carried out can you can I hear an amen
[2:08:43] we talked a couple Sundays ago sometimes
[2:08:45] the Deacon's going to be right there and
[2:08:46] he's going to be telling he's going to
[2:08:48] come up and tell him hey he might even
[2:08:50] come up to the pastor's kids and say hey
[2:08:52] uh your child is out of line and the
[2:08:56] pastor's kids have got to say yes sir Mr
[2:08:58] Deacon amen right
[2:09:02] no man can no no no no we've elect we're
[2:09:05] electing that man to keep things pure
[2:09:08] and it's up to us to keep our hearts
[2:09:11] pure
[2:09:13] come on you come on you you have to keep
[2:09:16] your heart pure against me
[2:09:19] how many times you're going to want to
[2:09:21] get mad at me
[2:09:24] but the moment you allow it
[2:09:26] and you allow bitterness
[2:09:28] I can't help you anymore
[2:09:32] but when you understand that hey brother
[2:09:34] Wendell's got a job and if he's saying
[2:09:36] something that's pretty that's a little
[2:09:37] on the sharp side well there's a reason
[2:09:38] he's saying it Lord Lord let me consider
[2:09:41] what he's saying help me show me let me
[2:09:43] let me be right let me let everything
[2:09:45] about me let me have a pure heart before
[2:09:48] you so that I can accept what you're
[2:09:51] trying to say
[2:09:52] and then there's going to be times where
[2:09:54] the Deacon just flat out gets it wrong
[2:09:56] and you're still going to love him
[2:09:57] because he's a human being
[2:10:00] and your pastor is going to flat out get
[2:10:02] it wrong and you're going to have to
[2:10:04] forgive me and love me
[2:10:08] just like I have to I have to forgive
[2:10:10] you and love you amen
[2:10:12] they tasty it takes us all
[2:10:16] we're humans
[2:10:19] amen
[2:10:21] so
[2:10:22] so we we think we I thank the Lord for
[2:10:25] that now
[2:10:26] we are going to be looking at trustees
[2:10:30] brother Joe has been a faithful trustee
[2:10:32] and we appreciate him
[2:10:35] and um and so we're looking to elect
[2:10:38] some trustees uh another trustee and a
[2:10:41] Treasurer here today
[2:10:43] and I just want to look over the the
[2:10:45] office of a of a trustee
[2:10:48] in the bylaws it's the body of men that
[2:10:51] shall govern the welfare of the church
[2:10:53] as a business group
[2:10:55] they're elected to protect the church in
[2:10:57] financial manners it's business and
[2:10:59] Investments the supervision of its
[2:11:01] properties and as it as expenditures
[2:11:03] they shall strongly consider every move
[2:11:05] of progress step by step which involves
[2:11:07] Church funds
[2:11:09] for they shall be responsible to keep
[2:11:11] the church from indebtedness
[2:11:13] and the Saints from burdens that are too
[2:11:16] great to Bear financially so so I I you
[2:11:19] know we are the we have got we can't go
[2:11:21] out there be getting loans and be doing
[2:11:23] this and that and the other fleecing the
[2:11:25] people we've we've got to uh and and I
[2:11:28] think we've got men these men that are
[2:11:31] uh that that understand that
[2:11:34] in the undertaking of any project
[2:11:36] regardless of what it is they are to
[2:11:39] bring the matter to the pastor the
[2:11:40] consultation by the pastor and by and
[2:11:43] consultation by the pastor only for
[2:11:46] every Financial project the the church
[2:11:48] wishes to invest and engage itself in
[2:11:51] is absolutely required now that's that's
[2:11:54] according to the Tabernacles uh that's
[2:11:58] that's the the bylaws and so the
[2:12:01] trustees take care
[2:12:03] of the maintenance of the property I
[2:12:05] think I think uh we understand that as
[2:12:09] we went over a little bit a couple weeks
[2:12:10] ago they take care of the maintenance
[2:12:12] part the the
[2:12:14] the lawn care
[2:12:18] which would include the flower beds and
[2:12:20] and and you know make sure everything's
[2:12:22] all cared for the trustees would inspect
[2:12:25] the buildings and and and and and repair
[2:12:28] the buildings as as they see need
[2:12:31] you know and it's and sometimes it's not
[2:12:33] a it's it's not a fun project because
[2:12:36] sometimes it's leaky Folly toilets and
[2:12:38] faucets
[2:12:40] sometimes it's leaky roofs sometimes
[2:12:42] that's what the trustees are there for
[2:12:45] now we understand that the trustees are
[2:12:47] as as we went over a couple weeks ago
[2:12:49] are not
[2:12:51] the trustees are not the ones that have
[2:12:53] to do all the work right
[2:12:56] but they are the ones that bring that
[2:12:58] that that are keeping up you can't have
[2:13:01] you can't have a bunch of uh
[2:13:04] a bunch of chiefs
[2:13:06] and no Indians right
[2:13:08] and so we've gotta
[2:13:12] brother Mike amen
[2:13:15] and so trustees are there to to
[2:13:21] make sure that that the church law and
[2:13:23] everything is is running good
[2:13:25] uh uh we that that that that that that
[2:13:27] that the monthly uh uh you know that uh
[2:13:34] any kind of a progress that is going to
[2:13:36] be made
[2:13:38] um you the uh the trustees are there
[2:13:45] and US brothers and I appreciate you
[2:13:47] Brothers I I've noticed there's been a
[2:13:49] lot more uh communication going on these
[2:13:51] last couple weeks which is a good deal
[2:13:53] and again we appreciate brother Joe for
[2:13:54] that
[2:13:56] um
[2:13:56] but we We join in behind the goal and
[2:14:00] try to get things done you know we we
[2:14:02] all jump in there and and try to
[2:14:06] um get get those things done now
[2:14:09] you know the treasurer is not it's not a
[2:14:12] trustee per se
[2:14:14] but he takes care of the money and the
[2:14:16] finances of the church
[2:14:19] the treasure
[2:14:21] um deposits the offerings he he makes
[2:14:24] the monthly bills keeps the records of
[2:14:27] the of the church's Financial dealings
[2:14:31] and um
[2:14:33] and so uh uh the the treasure attends
[2:14:36] the trustee meetings
[2:14:38] and acts also actually takes uh acts
[2:14:41] acts as a secretary actually you know
[2:14:43] takes takes
[2:14:45] the minutes or the record of the meeting
[2:14:48] uh you know to keep keep the keep
[2:14:50] everything all on the same page and then
[2:14:52] sharing notes whatever with the trustees
[2:14:54] and um especially when the trustees are
[2:14:57] considering a project
[2:14:59] now
[2:15:01] so these men are
[2:15:05] are incredible I I I I remember at one
[2:15:08] time when I used to do the I was
[2:15:10] treasurer
[2:15:12] secretary
[2:15:14] uh
[2:15:15] pastor
[2:15:18] I was the maintenance guy
[2:15:21] and
[2:15:23] huh
[2:15:25] I was a song leader too and musician
[2:15:28] I've done that all for years some some
[2:15:31] people say oh you just don't yeah and
[2:15:32] you just got it so easy oh you should
[2:15:34] have seen that the other years we are
[2:15:37] blessed here today
[2:15:41] I I did I played the piano
[2:15:45] I just got to tell you a story I was
[2:15:47] just a kid
[2:15:48] I was just a kid
[2:15:50] I'm I'm 19 20 years old and I'm getting
[2:15:53] people saved
[2:15:55] and
[2:15:58] praise the Lord
[2:16:00] what
[2:16:01] my my pastor in growing up that I was
[2:16:03] growing up but he was he was going to
[2:16:05] help me he said I'm going to set you up
[2:16:08] he says you're gonna need you a song
[2:16:09] leader you're gonna need you
[2:16:11] so he comes up
[2:16:13] and he finds this woman
[2:16:16] says you're going to be Wendell song
[2:16:18] leader and his and his piano player
[2:16:21] and um so we had us we we she so she she
[2:16:25] was leading songs and
[2:16:31] and uh
[2:16:33] leading songs and playing piano on
[2:16:36] Sundays
[2:16:39] and playing at bars on Saturdays
[2:16:44] no joke true story
[2:16:47] and uh or plan on it might not have I I
[2:16:51] think there were bars they were they
[2:16:52] were they weren't they weren't Christian
[2:16:55] settings I'll tell you that all right
[2:16:57] and um
[2:16:59] and so I'm thinking
[2:17:02] this ain't good this ain't good
[2:17:06] and uh
[2:17:10] my bass player was a cigarette smoker
[2:17:13] I'm telling you I
[2:17:15] I'm telling you it was a wonderful thing
[2:17:17] back in Pentecost when I when I was a
[2:17:19] kid
[2:17:21] and so
[2:17:23] we had to end up
[2:17:27] taking over being piano player and song
[2:17:29] leader
[2:17:32] so I played
[2:17:34] sung songs
[2:17:36] took offerings
[2:17:38] preached the sermon
[2:17:41] [Laughter]
[2:17:43] I mowed the lawn

[2:17:46] that line right over there that big old
[2:17:49] Hill and all that over there that we all
[2:17:50] get together on oh yeah yours truly I'm
[2:17:54] the guy
[2:17:55] I used to mow that thing
[2:17:57] you know how many times I've and my
[2:17:59] lawnmower was the most I was a I was a
[2:18:01] poor 19 year old poor 20 year old I I
[2:18:06] listen I was poor
[2:18:09] and I had a lawnmower that was almost
[2:18:11] poorer than me
[2:18:17] and I'm here to tell you buddy I could
[2:18:19] tell you some stories of me and that
[2:18:21] lawnmower and me tumbling down that Hill
[2:18:26] and the Lord has blessed us
[2:18:28] the Lord has blessed our little church
[2:18:30] here we've got we've got
[2:18:32] wonderful men and women
[2:18:33] [Applause]
[2:18:39] and we appreciate these trustees just
[2:18:42] because y'all's not Deacons
[2:18:46] does not mean that you're not important
[2:18:52] we need and appreciate these men can you
[2:18:58] say Amen
[2:18:59] [Applause]
[2:19:03] now I know we're a big family we're all
[2:19:06] a big church family and we just now
[2:19:08] listen
[2:19:10] um I mean I I listen people come over
[2:19:13] and borrow stuff from me all the time
[2:19:14] and tell me a couple weeks later oh I've
[2:19:15] got your saw or I've got you know I mean
[2:19:17] hey that's you know because y'all y'all
[2:19:19] know it's somewhere out there in that
[2:19:21] junk and um
[2:19:24] and so uh and I've probably done it to
[2:19:28] you too
[2:19:29] but we've just borrowed and we just
[2:19:32] we're just one big happy family what is
[2:19:35] yours is mine and what is mine is yours
[2:19:36] and and uh
[2:19:39] usually when I can't find mine no one
[2:19:42] else has it
[2:19:43] and um in the same way with you right
[2:19:48] but no one
[2:19:49] can I hear an amen
[2:19:52] you don't even know what I'm saying
[2:19:53] you're saying I'm not going to say Amen
[2:19:54] except for Kobe he's trusting amen no
[2:19:57] one has the authority to put anything on
[2:20:01] the church accounts
[2:20:03] except for the trustees
[2:20:07] amen
[2:20:09] no one has the authority unless the
[2:20:12] trustees have has given you that
[2:20:14] authority to go down to the lumber yard
[2:20:16] or whatever and then and and and so that
[2:20:21] anything that is bought with the church
[2:20:23] money or going to be put on Church
[2:20:25] property needs to go through a certain
[2:20:28] Channel
[2:20:31] Hallelujah
[2:20:32] amen anything bought for the church even
[2:20:36] if it's your own money
[2:20:39] must go through the right Channel
[2:20:44] you want to put a basketball court
[2:20:46] outside there you're not either until
[2:20:49] you talk to brother Joe
[2:20:51] well I talked to everyone else no no no
[2:20:53] no no no no no no no
[2:20:55] the Chan
[2:20:56] the trustee is the channel
[2:21:01] can I hear an amen
[2:21:03] well I I want to do that that is
[2:21:05] wonderful and we're
[2:21:08] you must
[2:21:11] go
[2:21:13] through the proper Channel
[2:21:15] so any idea any proposal concerning
[2:21:20] anything on the church property
[2:21:22] must go through the proper channels
[2:21:26] no one should act alone without the
[2:21:29] authority
[2:21:30] of the trustees and pastor
[2:21:34] now if the trustees accept the idea the
[2:21:38] treasurers verify that there's money in
[2:21:40] the funds that are there all of this
[2:21:43] then we can proceed but we want we want
[2:21:46] to get this sort of we we are we're
[2:21:49] we're a country church and we've got
[2:21:52] that country feel and I want us to
[2:21:54] continue having that country feel listen
[2:21:56] a country church is just it's awesome
[2:21:59] we love our elders
[2:22:01] we treat our kids good and we love the
[2:22:04] Bible that's a good country church amen
[2:22:06] we just we just we just love one another
[2:22:08] we're all family right
[2:22:12] well we love the in between the kids and
[2:22:14] the elders too we love everybody but
[2:22:17] that's that's our feel
[2:22:20] but we want that proper Channel
[2:22:24] amen
[2:22:26] no one should raise money
[2:22:28] uh for projects except for the trustees
[2:22:33] God is not the author of confusion and
[2:22:36] neither should we allow it money should
[2:22:38] be raised through the channels and
[2:22:41] that's through the trustees only can I
[2:22:45] hear it amen
[2:22:46] now so we we want to now there's there
[2:22:51] are things where
[2:22:53] um there's going to be
[2:22:57] um you know I've authorized sister
[2:23:00] Stephanie to purchase Church supplies
[2:23:02] and stuff of that nature well so she
[2:23:04] don't have to go through the trustees
[2:23:06] she can go she can just go straight to
[2:23:08] the treasurer and and pick up and pick
[2:23:11] up the cleaning supplies for whatever
[2:23:14] you know a toilet paper or uh um you
[2:23:18] know and and whatever else that she is
[2:23:20] you know that she is needing here
[2:23:21] there's no needing of a board meeting
[2:23:23] and and things like that so but yet
[2:23:25] sister Stephanie is responsible to bring
[2:23:27] the receipts and and get those to the
[2:23:30] treasurer so that the treasurer will
[2:23:32] know and and have that in the records
[2:23:35] y'all understand that so I I'm not
[2:23:37] saying that no one can go get it it just
[2:23:40] got to go through the right connection
[2:23:41] if if the trustee says yes uh you know
[2:23:44] you you we need 10 gallons of paint well
[2:23:47] we can go get that but make sure you get
[2:23:49] that re uh uh get get the receipt to the
[2:23:52] treasurer because they are responsible
[2:23:55] they are responsible
[2:23:57] for the upkeep yes they're every for the
[2:24:01] maintenance yes and they're also
[2:24:03] responsible for that keeping the money
[2:24:06] uh in clear and keeping us out of debt
[2:24:10] amen
[2:24:11] you know uh uh another thing comes
[2:24:14] mindset uh sister Keys when she's buying
[2:24:16] the food well it's not like she's going
[2:24:18] to have to go and and talk to no it's
[2:24:20] something that's that's that
[2:24:23] um uh we we have her to to go and and
[2:24:25] actually it's you a sister uh sister
[2:24:28] Katrina is right there buying food and
[2:24:30] sister Stephanie I mean they're they're
[2:24:32] you know they're all there together so
[2:24:34] it's not like it's it's you know we
[2:24:36] require a big old board meeting for this
[2:24:38] well we know that the food's going to
[2:24:39] have to be bought we've we've we've got
[2:24:41] that accounted for this that and the
[2:24:43] other and so uh uh but but what I'm
[2:24:47] saying is is everything everything is
[2:24:50] going has got to go through our trustees
[2:24:55] when we do that now how many believes
[2:24:57] that's right
[2:24:58] amen

[2:26:20] so ago and then I I he sort of shrugged
[2:26:22] it off and I thought well okay maybe he
[2:26:25] don't want to do it so uh but uh here a
[2:26:28] couple weeks ago he he said if you still
[2:26:31] want me to do it I'll do it I'm thinking
[2:26:32] good Lord where you been and
[2:26:36] but uh
[2:26:38] I think I think brother Merle would fit
[2:26:41] the job very very well
[2:26:45] and
[2:26:46] and I mean that
[2:26:50] um and so uh he's retired he can it's
[2:26:54] it's he can help with the uh bank
[2:26:57] account and that kind of thing and so I
[2:27:00] think he's he would be very good now
[2:27:03] um
[2:27:05] there's going to be thinking I'm closing
[2:27:07] I'm fixing and I want us to have our I
[2:27:09] want us to have a vote here in just a
[2:27:11] minute
[2:27:13] I I I I want us to um
[2:27:17] uh
[2:27:19] consider these men I have I have prayed
[2:27:22] hours in in
[2:27:24] asking the Lord for for leadership
[2:27:28] in this direction and because
[2:27:33] we're we got to be a team
[2:27:35] you can't be a Maverick and and be a
[2:27:38] part of a team you have got we've all
[2:27:41] got to flow together you ushers have got
[2:27:43] to flow with with with uh the Deacon the
[2:27:48] trustees and Treasurer has got to flow
[2:27:50] together the pastor has to flow together
[2:27:52] with everyone we've all got our
[2:27:55] different uh positions and places but we
[2:27:59] all uh
[2:28:01] are working toward that goal
[2:28:05] and I'm thankful I I as I've discussed
[2:28:08] these this with the with the brothers
[2:28:10] individually they don't know what I've
[2:28:12] talked about or what anyone anyone else
[2:28:15] has talked about but their desire is for
[2:28:17] the church the trustees especially it's
[2:28:21] you know would love to see uh the you
[2:28:24] know would love to see that house put on
[2:28:27] the market and and and get some money
[2:28:29] and the end goal is is is to be able to
[2:28:32] get the money to move to get the
[2:28:34] fellowship hall over on this side and
[2:28:37] that way we're not paying utilities and
[2:28:39] taxes and whatever else for two
[2:28:41] buildings
[2:28:43] which would be quite an undertaking
[2:28:47] planning a lot of a lot of that and and
[2:28:50] and time you know down the road but
[2:28:54] I don't think that these brothers are
[2:28:55] are in this thing just just to have
[2:28:58] position that's what I'm I guess that's
[2:28:59] what I'm trying to say I think they've
[2:29:01] got the best interest of our church and
[2:29:03] they want that
[2:29:05] I believe brother Harry
[2:29:08] is a is a good man he's got a he's got a
[2:29:12] good nature about him
[2:29:14] and he loves you
[2:29:18] I believe we have seen that exhibited
[2:29:20] over the years and and and and back
[2:29:23] again to the trustees brother Merle has
[2:29:26] has got a track record Among Us
[2:29:28] brother Michael brother Joe
[2:29:31] have got track records
[2:29:33] brother Harry's been here with us now
[2:29:35] how many how long have you been with us
[2:29:36] now brother Harry
[2:29:40] four years
[2:29:41] and he's been a a just a tremendous
[2:29:44] blessing
[2:29:45] working helping wherever he can
[2:29:48] and and we appreciate that
[2:29:52] what I would like to do and this is we
[2:29:54] I'm not going to send out papers today
[2:29:57] um what I would like to do I would like
[2:29:59] for
[2:30:00] I would like for brother Harry as a
[2:30:03] deacon to come brother Merle if you had
[2:30:05] come brother uh Joe and brother Michael
[2:30:08] if y'all would come up to the front
[2:30:11] and um
[2:30:15] and I want you to just face this
[2:30:18] direction toward me
[2:30:20] and um
[2:30:26] I I have found that these these um these
[2:30:31] brothers
[2:30:32] uh are good men
[2:30:36] I what we're going to do
[2:30:39] who whoever
[2:30:40] is uh who who can vote and who can't
[2:30:43] vote
[2:30:45] if you have good church record you've
[2:30:48] been coming here
[2:30:50] and you've got uh uh and you've got
[2:30:54] um
[2:30:55] and you pay your tithes and offerings
[2:30:56] here then we'll let you vote here today
[2:31:00] now if you're not paying tithes
[2:31:02] uh
[2:31:03] and your offerings you're then you're
[2:31:06] not at that age to vote yet
[2:31:08] and um
[2:31:10] let's let's just let's just read let's
[2:31:13] just redo this 16 and up
[2:31:15] will have a right to vote
[2:31:18] uh as long as you're in perfect
[2:31:20] attendance or you you attend to this
[2:31:22] church and you've got your um
[2:31:25] uh you you pay your tithes and offerings
[2:31:28] now
[2:31:30] I want to start with the deacon
[2:31:33] I think the deacons uh life is is is is
[2:31:37] is important
[2:31:39] and I
[2:31:40] um I'm going to read this to you here
[2:31:42] real quickly before we have the vote
[2:31:45] and um
[2:31:50] praise the Lord I thought I had that
[2:31:52] here already
[2:31:55] praise the Lord do you love him
[2:32:00] who's yeah
[2:32:03] uh yeah you can you can you can cut you
[2:32:06] can cut that off or no keep it going
[2:32:08] we'll shut it off right afterwards
[2:32:09] because there's there's others that are
[2:32:11] watching that couldn't make it this
[2:32:12] morning
[2:32:13] amen
[2:32:16] all right so the qualifications of of a
[2:32:19] deaconesses likewise must the deacon be
[2:32:22] grave not double tongued not given to
[2:32:26] much wine not greedy a filthy looker
[2:32:29] holding the mystery of faith in a pure
[2:32:31] conscience
[2:32:32] let these also be first proved let them
[2:32:36] use the office of a deacon and be found
[2:32:38] blameless
[2:32:39] even so must their wives be grave not
[2:32:42] slanderers sober faithful in all things
[2:32:46] let the Deacon be husband of one wife
[2:32:49] ruling their children and their houses
[2:32:51] well
[2:32:52] for they that have used the office of a
[2:32:55] deacon well purchased to themselves a
[2:32:57] good degree a great and great boldness
[2:33:00] in the faith which is in Christ Jesus
[2:33:05] and so I I feel that that brother and
[2:33:09] I'm going to give that opportunity to
[2:33:11] all of these
[2:33:12] we will elect these these four brothers
[2:33:15] today
[2:33:17] we'll give them a month
[2:33:19] and if they don't uh if if they don't
[2:33:21] feel like it's the job for them then
[2:33:24] then we'll let them out of their out of
[2:33:27] this but at in a month if you guys feel
[2:33:31] like this is something that you all want
[2:33:32] to continue then
[2:33:34] um the church would be honored to do so
[2:33:36] so I'm going to start with Deacon right
[2:33:39] now
[2:33:40] um could everyone bow their heads with
[2:33:44] no no peeking around
[2:33:46] everyone
[2:33:48] that finds brother Harry an honorable
[2:33:50] man
[2:33:51] filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:33:54] that would lead that would be able to
[2:33:56] lead and to love our congregation I want
[2:34:00] you to raise your hand if you're in
[2:34:01] favor
[2:34:03] everyone in favor
[2:34:06] okay all right you can put your hands

[2:34:29] trustee
[2:34:30] and has done a wonderful job
[2:34:33] and I we want him to stay on everyone
[2:34:36] that is in favor of brother Joe would
[2:34:39] you raise your hand

[2:35:01] and um has has loved the church as and
[2:35:05] even though he has gone through some
[2:35:08] incredible uh trials these last a couple
[2:35:11] years brother Michael has been faithful

[2:35:15] and uh kept he's just a he's been a
[2:35:19] wonderful man to this congregation

[2:42:17] amenity
[2:42:21] praise the Lord
[2:42:24] Hallelujah
[2:42:29] praise the Lord
[2:42:42] I was
[2:42:44] I was going to get brother Torrance up
[2:42:46] here and let us shake his hand real
[2:42:47] quick as he's
[2:42:49] I think he just went back to the
[2:42:51] restroom
[2:42:53] we appreciate uh
[2:42:57] brother Torrance
[2:42:58] and um
[2:43:02] and his his uh dedication over the years
[2:43:07] and so
[2:43:15] brother Branham talked about the unified
[2:43:17] body
[2:43:20] he says now when one member would talk
[2:43:22] against the other member you know that's
[2:43:24] wrong
[2:43:26] you're commanded to pray for one another
[2:43:27] and not to talk against one another but
[2:43:29] to love one another
[2:43:31] if someone is down let's pick him up and
[2:43:33] help him let
[2:43:35] you know that makes us a unified group
[2:43:37] of believers
[2:43:39] and when they don't obey that then they
[2:43:42] don't obey God and we displease God
[2:43:45] therefore our church or people cannot
[2:43:47] prosper
[2:43:48] the church cannot go on
[2:43:50] is because we're a disunified together
[2:43:54] little 11 11's the lump
[2:43:58] he said now if the church board or the
[2:44:00] deacons would would come and say
[2:44:02] thinking they'd build a new
[2:44:04] Tabernacle and if that is the votes of
[2:44:07] the deacons and the trustee are
[2:44:08] consulted
[2:44:09] they don't have the money to do it and
[2:44:11] they have a building program like we
[2:44:14] have going on now
[2:44:15] the general lot then it's taken before
[2:44:17] the general audience as it should be and
[2:44:20] all the church being Sovereign Church
[2:44:22] votes for the new Tabernacle then we
[2:44:24] should all cooperate with new Tabernacle
[2:44:27] frankly
[2:44:28] myself when I when they spoke of the new
[2:44:30] Tabernacle to me I was against the
[2:44:33] thought that's right I said we don't
[2:44:36] need exactly a new Tabernacle
[2:44:38] I'll probably be leaving here pretty
[2:44:40] soon
[2:44:40] as as
[2:44:42] the Lord will it what he showed he comes
[2:44:45] to pass then
[2:44:46] what what do we need a new Tabernacle we
[2:44:49] haven't got the money and then I come
[2:44:50] down and felt the feeling of the church
[2:44:52] and the church and the majority seem to
[2:44:53] want it
[2:44:54] well
[2:44:56] then what did I do I sacrificed my own
[2:44:58] thoughts
[2:44:59] and thrown it in with the church let's
[2:45:02] do that
[2:45:04] if it's the way that we cast the Lots
[2:45:07] that's that's the way it was in the
[2:45:08] Bible time
[2:45:10] the way the church voted the sovereignty
[2:45:12] the groups of the people come together
[2:45:13] in unity their strength therefore I said
[2:45:17] certainly if that's the way the church
[2:45:19] wants if that's what God is wanting he's
[2:45:22] got more authority to vote among a whole
[2:45:24] group and then than it has to me because
[2:45:26] I have no vision to say it shouldn't be
[2:45:30] so we throw in with the church move with
[2:45:32] the church and I'm behind it to do all
[2:45:35] that I can to help
[2:45:37] that should be the motive of every
[2:45:39] Christian every person in the church is
[2:45:42] for it to unify ourselves and stick
[2:45:44] together whatever the church votes for
[2:45:47] is what we should stand for can you say
[2:45:50] Amen
[2:45:51] now if our idea seems to be different a
[2:45:54] little different from the whole church
[2:45:56] lets the SEC let's sacrifice that idea
[2:45:59] because that's the only way we can stand
[2:46:01] Unified
[2:46:03] is if this church will just go on the
[2:46:06] way we're going now unified together
[2:46:08] it's unlimited what he'll do if we will
[2:46:12] stick together
[2:46:14] amen
[2:46:15] amen amen
[2:46:18] [Applause]
[2:46:22] we thank the Lord for that and we
[2:46:24] appreciate that
[2:46:26] we're going to dismiss and
[2:46:29] brother brother brother Torrance would
[2:46:32] you come would you come up front here
[2:46:33] for a minute we want we want people to
[2:46:35] shake your hands just real quick as we
[2:46:37] dismiss you just after you shake your
[2:46:39] hands you're dismissed
[2:46:41] we appreciate this elder
