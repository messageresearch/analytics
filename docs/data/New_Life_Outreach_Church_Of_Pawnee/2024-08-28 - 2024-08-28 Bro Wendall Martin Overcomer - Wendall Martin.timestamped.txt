[33:18] purpose and we want to look at that as
[33:23] we have as we have found in the message
[33:26] amen thankful for the messenger of the
[33:29] age that he would let us know that the
[33:33] lamb had three uh specific works that he
[33:38] was going to be doing amen there was the
[33:41] purchasing of the
[33:42] Bride man this was when he was going to
[33:45] be the lamb sacrifice where the Lamb of
[33:50] God would would lay down his life amen
[33:53] the second work was going to be the
[33:56] mediating this was going to be the lamb
[33:59] interceding for the church ages for you
[34:02] and for me throughout the amen these
[34:05] Church ages but as we have just read the
[34:08] lamb was also to come at a specific time
[34:13] at the at the end of this Gentile Church
[34:17] dispensation and he would claim those
[34:21] that he had purchased yes that he had
[34:24] been interceding for and he would CL CL
[34:28] you and me amen and ultimately take us
[34:32] back home where we belong amen so you
[34:36] see that amen each work of Grace does
[34:39] not each one each working of the Lamb
[34:41] does not nullify the other it was the
[34:44] lamb who's gave his life it is the Lamb
[34:47] who is interceding and then it was the
[34:50] lamb who has come to take the book to
[34:53] Amen to give this book now we know that
[34:56] he didn't just come and make the book
[34:58] and he didn't just open the book but
[35:00] Revelations 10 says he comes to Earth
[35:03] and he hands the book to the believer
[35:06] aren't you glad for that amen it's what
[35:09] God does and so we are we are thankful
[35:12] and and and many times we don't we can't
[35:15] really comprehend what amen what the
[35:18] work of the Lamb is is really about and
[35:21] that's why I I I think today many many
[35:25] times we we are amen we we try to limit
[35:28] or we we don't try but we do limit god
[35:32] with our with our finite mind we're
[35:34] we're really amen little PE brains
[35:36] compared to the infinite knowledge of
[35:39] God Amen but it's God's desire for you
[35:43] and I to come back to the position that
[35:47] we had with him before the foundation of
[35:49] the world you and I amen now we're we're
[35:53] here today in Fallen bodies we are here
[35:56] today in amen Amen in these flesh with
[35:59] the genetics that go back for hundreds
[36:01] of years we are amen our our complexes
[36:05] our genetics our everything about us
[36:07] that we are amen today amen we're just
[36:10] we're just a bottled up amen uh we're
[36:13] just a we're we're we're a bottled up uh
[36:17] creature of Amen of the past and we've
[36:20] got so many of these things within us
[36:23] but I I I I I want to say and and I and
[36:25] I hope tonight that you can see that the
[36:28] lamb has come to redeem you the lamb has
[36:33] come to take you back amen where you are
[36:37] today even in in your body of complexes
[36:40] there is a lamb that paid the price for
[36:43] you not just paid the price not just
[36:46] interceding but the Lamb's job is to
[36:49] take you back to your rightful place as
[36:53] the as as the owners of this Earth Amen
[36:56] to take us back that's and we're in that
[36:59] process of claiming right now where he's
[37:01] where he's saying Satan you can have no
[37:03] more can you say amen amen when John the
[37:06] Baptist amen looked at Christ he
[37:08] declared him this as the Lamb of God
[37:11] Amen the world really didn't know and
[37:13] didn't understand what John was saying
[37:15] and they turned around looking for a a
[37:18] four-legged lamb and amen they were
[37:21] trying to find out where the lamb was at
[37:23] they didn't understand the importance of
[37:25] God's lamb amen but John was using the
[37:28] metaphor of a amen of a of a of a lamb
[37:32] out of a out of a a herd amen but God's
[37:35] lamb was going to be the perfect
[37:38] sacrifice it would be the Lamb of God
[37:41] Jesus Christ can you say Amen they were
[37:44] looking for a messiah they were looking
[37:46] for someone to come and deliver them
[37:48] from Rome uh the Roman Empire they were
[37:50] looking for that but you see amen God
[37:53] had a lamb and it was in the body of
[37:56] Jesus Christ Christ amen God they they
[38:00] now they wanted again they wanted God to
[38:03] amen come down the Golden Ladder from
[38:04] Heaven amen they wanted God to come down
[38:07] and and and fight for Israel and to
[38:10] liberate them from that Roman oppression
[38:13] amen and the last thing they had on
[38:15] their mind was a lamb amen they they
[38:19] they they wanted someone to fight them
[38:21] and get them out of the oppression are
[38:23] you hearing me amen but they had been
[38:25] sacrificing Lambs for 4,000 years amen
[38:28] they had been offering Lambs Abraham
[38:31] offered a lamb God offered a lamb for
[38:33] for for uh H Adam and Eve and amen there
[38:36] was Lambs were part of the worship for
[38:39] those 4,000 years amen but this was
[38:42] going to be a different lamb amen this
[38:45] was going to be amen a a a a a God man
[38:49] coming down and sacrificing his life for
[38:54] you and for me amen so God used the
[38:57] metaphor of a lamb it's not that God
[39:00] that Jesus Christ was a four-legged
[39:02] wooly lamb it was that there was
[39:05] somebody who could pay the price for
[39:09] Humanity for your sins can you say Amen
[39:13] it had to be a kinsman redeemer to bring
[39:17] us back amen that that knew what it was
[39:20] to have sin that knew what it was to
[39:23] have have mind battles that knew what it
[39:25] was to to belong on to an Earthly family
[39:29] and yet he paid the price for your sins
[39:33] and for my sins so that we could come
[39:36] back in fellowship with
[39:38] god oh can you say Amen the the the the
[39:41] the natural lamb had been the amen uh
[39:45] the the Keystone to worship since the
[39:47] garden amen and they had so perfected
[39:52] that worship amen that you know they
[39:56] just didn't see that need for Christ
[39:59] amen but I I want to say John amen the
[40:03] John the Baptist he declared Behold the
[40:06] Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of
[40:09] the world Amen this was not going to be
[40:11] just any ordinary lamb amen there was no
[40:14] one else that was worthy to take this
[40:17] sin it had to be a god lamb that come to
[40:22] pay the price for you and for me now I
[40:25] want to tell you today amen you will
[40:27] never be worthy to make it to Heaven you
[40:29] will never be worthy to come in contact
[40:31] with God you cannot will not there's no
[40:34] good in you whatsoever the the amen the
[40:38] good has been found in God's lamb can
[40:41] you say Amen now you couldn't put the
[40:44] holiest of prophets next to him amen the
[40:47] holiest of all a holy would would have
[40:50] to bow their their heads Amen in the
[40:53] presence of him in shame whether it was
[40:56] the Cherub or the S or Elijah or Malachi
[40:59] or Isaiah they all had to hang their
[41:02] heads in the presence of this lamb amen
[41:06] you see the question that we just read
[41:08] that was going throughout the earth and
[41:10] the and throughout the heavens who is
[41:12] worthy to take the book The Inheritance
[41:17] of the earth amen the title deed to the
[41:20] Earth who is worthy to take that book
[41:24] and to loose those seals and to have it
[41:27] back to the rightful owners Hallelujah
[41:30] just in case you've forgotten Humanity
[41:33] it was Adam that was given the title
[41:35] deed to the Earth he was told to rule
[41:38] and to Reign he was told Amen to govern
[41:41] the fish and the foul of the air he was
[41:43] the one that could could speak like his
[41:45] father God Amen he could he could call
[41:48] for the tree to come he could call for
[41:49] the clouds he could call Heen he was in
[41:52] Dominion are you hearing me but when sin
[41:55] came he lost the title to the Earth amen
[41:58] it's now gone now we're hiding from the
[42:00] storm now we're hiding from Leo the life
[42:03] now we're hiding amen but God's got a a
[42:06] desire and that's to bring you back into
[42:10] that rightful position that he called
[42:12] you for hey can you say Amen we needed a
[42:17] lamb who could represent
[42:21] us
[42:23] amen but you see when they looked amen
[42:26] when joh seen the vision and he and and
[42:29] he heard the cry who is worthy to open
[42:32] the book and loose the seals and they
[42:35] searched through heaven and there was no
[42:37] one worthy they searched through Earth
[42:39] and there was no one worthy they
[42:41] searched under the Earth there was no
[42:43] one worthy no one at all not even to
[42:46] look at it can you say Amen so this book
[42:49] must be of high regards amen whatever
[42:52] that book was it was in high regards not
[42:55] a prophet could open it not an angel
[42:57] could open it these guys were not even
[43:01] worthy to look at it that's right that's
[43:05] true but then God says I've got a lamb
[43:09] Hallelujah and that lamb has been in my
[43:11] mind from before the foundation of the
[43:13] world God already well praise that the
[43:16] Bible says the lamb was already slain in
[43:18] the mind of God before the foundation of

[44:21] written in the Lamb's Book of Life and
[44:23] that Redemption of the Lamb that

[44:31] come into its fruition and to come into
[44:33] the realities of the promises of God for
[44:35] each generation amen every Church age

[44:41] God to overcome for that age but we're
[44:43] living in the age not of just amen uh

[45:25] that is the believer the words in the
[45:28] book and the word is him and all that's
[45:31] in that he came for this book of

[48:04] say
[48:05] man I'm not even worthy there there
[48:08] there in John 1:27 when he's discussing

[48:14] after me who is preferred before me
[48:16] whose shoe latchet whose Sho strings I'm
[48:19] not worthy to un
[48:22] loose but then on the 29th verse John

[48:26] coming unto him and said Behold the Lamb
[48:29] of God which takes away the sin of the
[48:31] world this is he of whom I had said
[48:34] after me cometh a man that is preferred
[48:36] before me for he was before me and I

[55:04] Judgment he told him he said that
[55:06] serpent is going to be there to crush
[55:09] your heel to bruise your heel amen
[55:13] Genesis 3:15 I will put enmity or hatred
[55:17] between thee and the
[55:18] woman now he's telling the serpent
[55:21] there's going to be a
[55:24] hatred there's going to to be a
[55:27] hatred between the woman's seed sexual
[55:31] born
[55:34] seeds that has another genetic on the
[55:37] inside see sometimes we sometimes we
[55:39] don't understand that sometimes we don't
[55:41] realize amen that that that we forget
[55:44] that we've still got genetics that that
[55:46] go up our family tree we we've still got
[55:48] genetics coming from our great great
[55:49] grandpa and great great grandma amen and
[55:52] and and that's just on the dad's side
[55:54] and then you've got some stuff coming
[55:55] from the mom's side and we sit there and
[55:57] we wonder why we're so confused all the
[55:59] time we wonder why we're up and we're
[56:00] down there is nothing good about this
[56:03] flesh amen and if you judge yourself
[56:05] according to the way you think and the
[56:07] way are you hearing me you got to
[56:10] understand that there is an eternal seed
[56:13] on the inside of you it was a
[56:15] predestinated seed of God so that's why
[56:17] the Apostle Paul says there are two laws
[56:20] on the inside there's those that are
[56:22] born of the sexual seed and then there's
[56:24] those that are born amen of the Eternal
[56:26] seat and those laws go back and forth
[56:29] when I would do good I find that evil is
[56:31] present amen when I when I would just
[56:34] it's just a confused mess going on on
[56:37] the inside of me all the time but I want
[56:39] to tell you thanks be to God there is a
[56:43] lamb and that lamb has says I'm going to
[56:47] take you through to your Perfection you
[56:50] will not be lost I will take you
[56:56] amen praise the Lord can you say
[57:00] Amen now he says I'll put enmity hatred
[57:03] between thee and the
[57:05] woman and between thy seed and her
[57:08] seed and it her
[57:12] seed shall bruise
[57:15] Crush I don't know why they put
[57:17] bruise literally means Crush thy
[57:22] head and the Serpent's going to
[57:24] bruise the Heat
[57:27] can you say man
[57:30] now am I making an
[57:33] excuse for anyone that has the Holy
[57:37] Ghost and still letting and still
[57:40] letting the genetics rule
[57:43] us no I'm
[57:45] not the New
[57:48] Birth has empowered the sons of God yeah
[57:54] to take Dominion
[57:56] yes sir over the devil
[58:00] right he didn't say that the genetics
[58:04] you say why do you say the genetics
[58:06] Hallelujah don't take too very far to go
[58:08] back from when that conversation was
[58:10] taken place Eve had not even had
[58:13] children yet Eve was impregnated by The
[58:18] Serpent and he's letting her know
[58:21] because of all of this nonsense that's
[58:23] going

[58:44] it's it's the the world is going to be
[58:46] full amen of of Flesh beings and it's
[58:51] and are you hearing me but he's give the
[58:53] promise but the genetics of God will
[58:57] still be on the earth that's
[59:01] right and there's going to come a time
[59:03] now you're going to have to have these
[59:04] natural Lambs I'm slaying a lamb right
[59:06] now for you before you go outside this
[59:09] Garden amen Abel's going to have to slay
[59:11] a lamb the man Noah is going to have to
[59:14] slay a lamb and Abraham's going to have
[59:17] to slay a lamb and David bless his heart
[59:20] he's going to have to have a lamb amen
[59:23] there's going to have to be Lambs
[59:24] there's going to be lambs and when these
[59:26] little wooly Lambs these little
[59:27] four-legged Lambs when you kill them I'm
[59:30] not going to look at your sin you're
[59:31] going to hang on to the horns of the
[59:33] Altar and as you hang on and as you're
[59:35] slaying the lamb and the blood's coming
[59:37] all over you and it's and it's gurgling
[59:39] for its life the the life of that
[59:41] innocent lamb is going to come upon you
[59:45] amen I'm not going to look at your sin
[59:47] I'm not going to look at your failure
[59:49] I'm not going to look at your Humanity
[59:51] I'm going to look at that L and I'm
[59:53] going to come down and visit with you
[59:55] are you hearing me amen but you see the
[59:58] life of that lamb could never make me
[1:00:02] perfect the life of that four-legged
[1:00:05] creature could never change my
[1:00:08] genetics the life of that lamb could
[1:00:12] never amen bring me in True Fellowship
[1:00:15] and back to Dominion it took a living
[1:00:18] God coming down in a body of Flesh to
[1:00:22] pay the
[1:00:24] price amen
[1:00:28] I'm a human and that four-legged
[1:00:31] lamb I don't understand lamb talk and he
[1:00:35] don't understand human talk can you say
[1:00:38] am man but when God became a
[1:00:42] human God felt like you felt yeah sure
[1:00:46] did God hurt like you hurt that's right
[1:00:48] God was a teenager like you were a
[1:00:51] teenager
[1:00:54] God suffered
[1:00:58] and I'm going to blow you kids away but
[1:01:01] the Bible
[1:01:03] says that
[1:01:06] Jesus amen he
[1:01:09] learned he was
[1:01:12] perfected by the things that he
[1:01:15] suffered are you hearing me in other
[1:01:18] words he had to have a mom and a daddy
[1:01:19] too and he had to have somebody to call
[1:01:21] him down occasionally too well I'm
[1:01:23] talking about Jesus he was he was a boy
[1:01:26] just like you he was a teenager just
[1:01:27] like you he knows what it is come on now
[1:01:31] but that man became My
[1:01:35] Sacrifice he died on a calvary's cross
[1:01:39] so that that
[1:01:41] perfect genetics of God the life that
[1:01:45] made him holy comes back upon me so it
[1:01:48] does not just forgive my sins but the
[1:01:52] life through the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:54] Ghost comes back and lives within me
[1:01:57] now I've got something to
[1:02:05] overcome I've got something to overcome
[1:02:08] the fell that was born amen June 22
[1:02:13] 1970 Within Me is full of all this
[1:02:15] nonsense Within Me amen but I've got to
[1:02:18] do it the way God says to do it I've got
[1:02:20] to recognize that I'm a sinner I've got
[1:02:21] to recognize that I've got some things
[1:02:23] in me that needs to be taken care of and
[1:02:25] I can take those things that's in me I
[1:02:27] can take those sins those rebellions I
[1:02:29] can take I can take Mr wend Martin and I
[1:02:31] can come to Calvary and I can expect God
[1:02:34] to come down and wash me and cleanse me
[1:02:38] and give me the power to overcome and to
[1:02:40] keep that devil down can you say Amen
[1:02:43] it's the lamb who is interceding for
[1:02:51] this well praise the Lord praise the
[1:02:54] Lord hallelujah

[1:03:09] got the Holy Ghost now it's all done and
[1:03:12] I want to walk out of here no more
[1:03:14] battling with me and my genetics and
[1:03:17] what my mama was and my daddy was and my
[1:03:19] grandpa was and my grandma was and no no
[1:03:22] more having to deal with anything the
[1:03:23] Apostle Paul says I have to
[1:03:27] Die
[1:03:30] daily that means that if I'm going to
[1:03:33] rule and Reign I've got to feed the
[1:03:36] white dog and not the black dog I've got
[1:03:40] to come on church amen the realities of
[1:03:43] this glorious gospel for the church is
[1:03:46] that there is a lamb that is greater
[1:03:49] than anything you're
[1:03:52] facing
[1:03:53] Hallelujah can you say Amen
[1:03:57] now Adam's race has been in slavery
[1:04:00] since the fouring of that book he's lost
[1:04:04] his position of authority here on the
[1:04:05] earth wandering in miserable slavery
[1:04:09] Satan by default is the acting owner of
[1:04:11] the
[1:04:12] earth
[1:04:14] amen though we know he's not the
[1:04:16] owner the book has been waiting for the
[1:04:18] sons of
[1:04:19] God now the prophet would say
[1:04:23] this he would say now the forfeited TI
[1:04:25] itle deed is in the hand of the original
[1:04:27] owner almighty God the title deed to the
[1:04:30] Earth and to eternal life when Adam
[1:04:32] forfeited it then Satan's dirty hands
[1:04:36] could not take it it went back to its
[1:04:39] original owner God
[1:04:43] himself now does that mean anything to
[1:04:45] you yes that does that means a whole lot
[1:04:47] to you because you were given the
[1:04:49] authority Satan tripped Adam and Eve up
[1:04:51] and has taken the title deed and says ha
[1:04:54] I've got it for myself now he claiming
[1:04:56] he's the owner of the Earth but the
[1:04:57] prophet says oh no when Satan was taking
[1:04:59] it and was gloating God just reached
[1:05:01] right over grabbed the title deed and
[1:05:03] says it's coming back to me until I
[1:05:05] redeem my
[1:05:11] sons that ought to mean something to you

[1:05:26] claim your salvation of your children
[1:05:28] right now you can do it right now

[1:05:35] you the lamb has prevailed for
[1:05:41] you can you say
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] amen but Satan what keeps you Austin
[1:05:50] from taking this title deed the opening
[1:05:53] of the book what takes what what keeps
[1:05:55] keeps you from reaching out and
[1:05:59] just killing the devil in your
[1:06:03] life Satan

[1:06:25] though the lamb has redeemed you you
[1:06:28] can't come and willingly accept what God
[1:06:30] has already paid for I said it's already
[1:06:33] paid for I said the title deed has been
[1:06:36] handed back Revel Revelations 10 has
[1:06:39] already transpired no it's not the
[1:06:42] literal we're not walking on the ashes
[1:06:44] of the wicked yet but it's every bit

[1:06:50] you who you
[1:06:52] are you're not a w to be you are a son
[1:06:56] of

[1:07:09] off crash his head and say I am going to
[1:07:13] stand as a Son of God and I'm going to
[1:07:16] overcome
[1:07:19] hallelujah
[1:07:21] hallelujah and the prophet would tell us
[1:07:24] Satan is still here

[1:35:56] Creator but all the chemicals that was
[1:35:58] manufactured and put together they broke
[1:36:00] it up there's no more of
[1:36:04] it that's what the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:36:06] does to the true child of God when he

[1:52:36] for and the Great Mighty angel of God
[1:52:39] the spirit of that lamb has come greater
[1:52:43] than any other time in this day to

[1:53:32] religious you've got to have a new
[1:53:35] birth you've got to ask forgiveness of
[1:53:38] your

[1:53:43] living on the inside of
[1:53:45] you he makes all things
[1:53:49] do he gives you the desire to love him
[1:53:52] and to serving he makes sin really
[1:53:56] sinful cuz the Holy Spirit living on the
[1:53:58] inside of you just ain't it ain't going
