a little while since we've got to see her amen it is really good to have you tonight amen second Kings chapter 6 amen 2 Kings chapter 6 verse 12 through 17 amen it says and one of his servants said none my Lord oh King but elishah the prophet that is in Israel tth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber and he said go and spy where he is that I may send and fetch him and it was told uh and it was told him saying behold he is in Dothan therefore sent Heath thither horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of uh and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth Behold a host uh uh compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with him and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha amen may the Lord have blessings to the reading the word you can be seated amen if I were to give a title tonight I would like to title more are they with us amen I um uh you'll have to forgive me if it sounds like I repeat myself from this morning but maybe I could U maybe give this maybe a part two so uh I might just uh go into to what we talked about this morning a little bit but more are they with us and and uh now we're living in a world of of great fear amen there's so many things in the world today that's that's caused great fear among the people in the world Amen but to the bride of Christ it should cause us to lift our heads amen we know that the world is is living in darkness and fear and they're scared about tomorrow they're scared uh uh when we was having the election they were scared of who was going to be elected and they're worried about their job they're worried uh about this about that scared that uh to go in the grocery store scared to to walk down the streets anymore and it's and it's caused a great fear today and and and Satan is trying to get uh the people and just we know that we're living in Satan's Eden and and he's trying to do the same in our churches amen he's trying to get our minds off the promises of God and get us focused on our problems amen he's he's trying to get us focused on the circumstances amen where we get worried about the sickness in our bodies we we get scared that our kids will never come back to God we get scared our church is going to fall apart and fear and scared to believe for a Rapture scared to believe God cuz what if it won't happen you know and that's what Satan is trying to put in the church today and and that's what he's doing he's causing a fear to get us to doubt God's word Amen brother brandham says the worst thing the devil can put on you is fear amen and fear doesn't come from God Amen we all know that fear doesn't come from God 2 Timothy 1 and 7 says for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen and 1 John 4:18 says there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear amen because fear hath torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love amen so fear doesn't come from God Amen brother brandham says love and faith are are the same thing amen love produces Faith amen and there are two uh fa uh uh faculties that that govern a human and one of them is Faith which brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all amen and Faith cometh by hearing the word of God Amen Faith cometh by believing the word of God we all know the saying you are what you eat and uh we can feel beat off the things of the world Amen we are like a sponge human the human is like a sponge we can soak up the things of the world or we can soak up the things of God Amen we can soak up in uhh in the politics we can soak up the entertainment we can numb our minds to the world uh to the word a and that if we're not careful we can let fear take over if we indulge in politics if we indulge in the things of the world we indulge in in entertainment and not the things of God then we leave the door open for Satan to come in with fear amen and we don't want fear to take over but if we can just forget about the politics if we can just let go we forget about the entertainment we forget uh about numbing our minds to the things of the world and if we can just soak up the things of God then we can have faith in the word that will bring the power of God in our midst tonight amen Faith cometh by hearing the word of God Amen not in your favorite audio book amen not in your favorite TV show amen not in man's ideas and his own Revelations but in the word of God for this hour amen Faith cometh by hearing the word of God Amen now each messenger had a word for their day and hour amen Noah had a message for his day and that was it's going to rain amen the people had to obey the voice for that day or they perished amen and by faith Noah built an ark amen his faith rested upon God's Eternal world uh word and brother brandom says no matter how much the people said it can't be done no matter how much science comb the globe and said there'll never be clouds up there there's no rain to come down if God's word said it's going to rain it's up to God to make a way for the rain and if God said so then that settles it amen and that's the way our faith should be if God said so then that settles it amen it doesn't matter what the world says it doesn't matter uh what what what your friends say or what your family says if God said it then that settles it and he's got to make a way for it to happen amen amen bless the Lord excuse me amen Wesley had a message for his day amen Luther had a message for his day and on down to this final day a message for our brother righted in this hour there had to come a final message Amen in this day and this message has come like we said this morning this message had come to get us ready for a Rapture Luther's message couldn't do it Wesley's message couldn't do it but there had to come a final message in the final day amen to get us ready to go home amen now it may look strange to the world it may look odd and they and they may come up with every reason why we shouldn't make this message our absolute but this mess message is not to the unbeliever this message to is to the children of God amen amen God has an elected people who has put their faith in the word of God and has made herself ready amen come what may trials will come sickness will come amen and all hell has been loose to get you to doubt but you've got to put your faith in the word of God Amen put your faith to the test amen the world is growing darker fear is growing everywhere those fires in in Los Angeles is caused a great fear among the people amen and and as long as you're feeding off the word of God for this hour as long as you're feeding off the off the word of God for your day then you have nothing to fear amen some has put their faith in the pope some has put their faith in in the bishop of what the bishop says or or what their grandpappa used to say but if it don't line up the word with the word then it's totally wrong amen but the uh you've got to put your faith in the word of God Amen the Pope's word is going to fail amen The Bishop's word will fail grandpappy's word will fail but the word of God cannot fail amen I would be ra I'd rather be standing on God's promises on God's word than than on someone's idea I would rather be standing on God's word than in heaven I would rather be standing on God's word than Earth because heaven and Earth shall fail but my words will remain amen the word of God is a sure Foundation amen and that's the promise that God gave to us amen when you build your faith on the right foundation then nothing can bring it down amen depression can't bring it down amen sickness will come death will come doubt will come but the word of God is sharper and more powerful than any two-edged sword amen we just got to take God out his word and possess every promise he has made for you amen amen God told them the land is yours amen we talked about it this morning God told him the land is yours I've given you the promises now go get it amen can you imagine can you imagine if they would just stood there and said well it sure would be nice to have that land man it would sure be nice to just go over there and just relax and man the fruit looks so juicy and the land looks so nice I wish we could have it yeah amen are you sure that the promise is for us today oh I know he made the promise to to Moses but Moses is gone are you sure that that that word still alive and Still Remains for us and are you sure that the message that the prophet declared is for us in this day amen no no they knew who they were amen they knew that God had called them and they went and possessed the promise that God gave them amen and when God gives a promise it doesn't mean that you ain't going to have to fight for it amen when God gives a promise you got to fight for every inch of that promise amen God says I've already provided a way amen Satan is going to to do everything he can to get you from claiming your inheritance but God says I give it to you I've given it to you just possess it amen it's yours it's yours you just have to believe me don't fear don't fear just believe brother brandom takes hold fear drops away amen Faith's got big muscles in a hairy chest when it speaks everything else keeps quiet cancer has to shut up and get out of the way tumor TB the rest of them moves out when Faith raises up and says sit down that settles it amen fear has no place in a child of God tonight amen fear has no place in your homes come on now let your faith in God speak over your home let faith in God uh speak for your children let your faith take hold over your life brother brandham says faith puts Satan to shame Faith puts Satan to shame and it doesn't matter what comes your way fear not and claim every promise of God Amen well glory to God I've gotten a little ahead of myself but if we were go to back uh go back to the opening scripture we know that uh we find out there was a war between Syria and Israel yeah and every time the enemy would try to lay a trap for the armies of Israel God would reveal it to his Prophet amen Elijah amen and how many knows that the word of the Lord comes to a prophet only amen always he comes to a prophet always amen and I want you to catch this now the enemy was all was always exposed anytime he tried to get to God's people amen the enemy was exposed any time he tried to get to God's people and the Bible says that the king of Syria was very troubled about this and and sought after Elijah amen and do in so in the cover of Darkness he sent a great host and surrounded the city amen he sent a great host and surrounded the city and it's the same thing today Satan has released all the host of Hell to surround you and to cause you to fear amen and this great Army it's in its horses it's in its chariots and it surrounded the city and the Bible says that Elijah's servant went out the next day and and that he seen the armies of Syria yeah and he cried out to Elijah he said master master what are we supposed to do yeah we're surrounded there's no way out what are we going to do now Elijah didn't fear he didn't so oh well man I should have kept my mouth shut oh man I I shouldn't have told israels that what what what what what the king of Syria was saying in his bed Chambers oh I should have just kept my mouth quiet no no he didn't say that at all he looked at his servant and he said fear not fear not oh my that's a powerful statement fear not and in the carnal eye it looked impossible amen he probably looked at Elijah and said man Elijah woo I think you slept a little too long I don't I think you need to go get your coffee before you come to and and look out here you know you ain't had a cup yet this morning and I think you're a little crazy but all Elijah said was fear not amen do you not see that great host before us do you not see the circumstance that's lying before you right now do you not see the trouble that we're in Elijah Elijah says just fear not fear not amen for they that be with us they that be with us are more than they that be with him oh my and as his servant says well you know Elijah I only see the two of us I don't know what you're talking about Elijah and Elijah said Lord I pray thee Open the Eyes of the young man that he may see and God opened his spiritual eyes and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots I fire round about them amen and if we can apply that to our day Satan has Unleashed his Demons of fear and torment to surround you to put you in a bind but do not be in despair don't fear more are they with us than they that be with him yes sir amen Psalms 91 and9 says because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy th in thy habitation thy Dwelling Place there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plag n thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways amen it may seem helpless darkness is covering the Earth people in great fear the world in utter chaos but if you could Unleash Your Faith tonight there are more with us and they that be with him amen he shall give his Angel charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways amen that's a promise for us to hold on to amen he's faithful to his word amen Moses brought the people out of Egypt then they came to the Red Sea and the people began to ask Moses what now Moses you brought us out here to die we are trapped between Pharaoh's Army and the Sea what shall we do Moses Moses cried out as we said this morning stand still just stand still and that's the same thing with us we get our spirits and our up we we we we we get to worrying about this we get to worrying about how that is going to happen how is this going to happen and woring about our jobs and how we're going to make the money how how we going to pay the bills and well my friend is really sick and on the deathbed oh Lord I don't know cuz I can't lose them come on we get our Spirits in an uproar and Moses says just stand still and see the salvation of the Lord he brought us this far he's got to make a way to take us all the way amen it's the same for us he's brought you this far he's brought you out of Egypt now he's got to take you to the promised land amen if he brought you this far he's going to take you all the way yes he is amen he'll send his angels to hold back the sea so you can get across oh my he'll hold back the situation he'll hold back the troubles that you're in just so you can get on the other side oh my if you feel like you're in a lion's den and and you're going to get swallowed I know a God who can send angels to shut the mouths of lions tonight amen don't fear don't fear have faith in God Amen fear Makes You Weary God fear will make you doubt fear will make you wonder if you're going to go in a Rapture or not fear will make you wonder if this message is the truth or not oh my we've got a lot of fear going on Amen fear will make you wonder fear will give you questions in your mind brother Brenham says the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always amen the angel of the Lord accompanies this message not just some sometimes not when it feels like it should but always through the thick through the thin the angel of the Lord is there amen as as long as you're staying with message as long as you're preaching the message the angel of the Lord will be there to back up every word amen we may not understand everything but but God didn't ask us to understand everything he didn't ask us to to memorize every scripture in the Bible to to memorize every quote he says just believe you just got to believe this tonight amen if you just put your faith on what the word of God says you will find that your doubts will fade amen you will find that your doubt will fade away and this message came to dissolve all your doubt if you've got doubt this morning or tonight get under the message of the hour amen the angel of the Lord is here to to dis off all your doubt amen this message came to produce a faith to get us ready for our Rapture to produce a faith to believe for all things amen don't fear about your lost children don't fear about your lost loved ones but hold on to God's word and believe God is going to bring them through he has to he made the promise amen he's obligated to his word don't fear amen Psalms 34:7 the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver them the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him amen when you mothers are teaching your kids the message and you're telling them the promises of God and you're are listening to that message every day and you're playing that message over and over in your homes and and you're teaching your kids of the way of the of the word and and of the way of the Prophet just know that the angel of the Lord is there with you oh my when your brothers are are working and your sisters go out to the grocery store just know that the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him amen you don't have to fear what the devil might do to you you don't have to fear that sickness I'm telling you you don't have to fear that sickness quit babying that sickness don't fear Fe it amen don't fear that depression don't fear that anxiety for the angel of the Lord encampeth round about you amen you you may not be able to see them we may not be able to hear them amen but uh but Jesus said blessed are they for they have not seen and yet have believed amen and Jesus said uh I will be with you even in you till the end of the world then you can place your faith and watch it become our reality to you hallah oh my faith knows no fear Faith knows no fear amen don't be afraid to possess the promise of God Lord amen they're yours the promises Belong To You amen amen every promise that God made belongs to the children of God Amen you know Satan will still whisper in your ear Satan will tell you that you're too weak we Satan will tell you that the promises don't belong to you that you don't belong and and Satan will tell you that you're that you're too sick to get well amen but perfect love casteth out fear and when fear is gone faith is perfect oh my faith in God will move mountains it's faith in God that will calm the troubled Seas amen ask what you will and it will be given to you have faith in God brother Bram says have the faith of God Amen God has given you the power to cast out fear yeah do you believe that yes God has given you the power to cast out fear a lot of times we want to leave it up to the pastor a lot of times we want to leave it up to the preachers to the deacons we want to leave it up uhh to Mommy and Daddy but God has given you the power to cast out fear and when Satan tries to bring fear in your home God has given you the power through the through the baptism of the Holy Ghost to cast out that fear amen if Satan is trying to cause fear in your life he's trying to cause fear in your church God has given you the power to catch that Spirit out you don't have to carry that spirit of fear amen you don't have to you don't have to carry that fear come on Amen bless the Lord we uh a little testimony men uh my wife some of you uh most of you already know uh that we moved uh to Camp Christie where we have our spring meetings and uh we we become the new caretakers there and uh we moved into the house there and and uh it was the older man and his wife and their grandson used to stay there with them a lot and their a Church of God denomination and uh well when we moved in you know we stayed a couple nights there in the house and but every night there come a great fear on autumn autumn autumn would just wake up scared she she wouldn't go look in the closet because she just felt this fear she wouldn't go from her kitchen to the bedroom or from the kitchen to the living room without saying Mama I'm scared m i I don't know what this is and and and so I I called Dad and and I didn't tell tell Dad the situation yet and and I told him I said I would like for you to come dedicate the house and and brother Andrew was there and so I asked them both to come over and we was just going to dedicate the house back to the Lord and when Dad got there I begin to tell him the situation that that that that just this great fear and and when actually me and my wife when we'd go to bed our dreams were just plagg by fear our dreams were just it was just we just couldn't hardly sleep there was just a great fear in that house and so we sat there and we gathered around in the living room and Dad began to pray and he began to call out on the Lord to just drive that SP spirit of fear out and I just begin to tear up and I begin to thank the Lord for for what he's done for us and begin to thank the Lord for for driving the spirit of fear out and I tell you what my daughter that very night hasn't been scared one time in that house we've been sleeping soundly because that spirit of fear was welcome no longer hallelujah hallelujah Spirits are real they are bu Spirits are real yes sir amen and if you constantly feed off the ungodly movies if you constantly feed off the ungodly audio books and the the the worldly entertainment you've opened up the door for evil spirits to creep into your house amen I'm a witness of that amen I'm going to tell off on myself I I wasn't going to do it but uh it's just another great testimony a couple years ago I was telling brother KOB and Caleb this the other day but a couple years ago I I gotten to a a real just a real deep deep spot in my life that I just was just depressed and and things and I'm going to admit we we welcomed a lot of things in the house that shouldn't have been there and we watched a lot of things that that was ungodly and you know they had this new thing out that you know you can plug into your movie and when you watch it it bleeps all the words out it bleeps all the ungodly scenes out and that's just a way for the devil to come in I tell you what and we we were sitting there and autumn autumn was just born and she was an infant I'm telling you she was an infant and we would be there and Autumn would go to sleep and then me and my wife would spend time together and we'd watch watch a movie and every morning my daughter would wake up just scared in the middle of the night and she's a baby she would just scream like a scream that I've never heard before and and I didn't know what to do I I didn't know what was going on and the next day something ministered to me and says it's them things that you've been watching and I B broke I I I cried and I said' Lord you got to forgive me that I would I would do this to my daughter I would welcome this in my home and I didn't mention it to my wife and I got home and and uh we go uh uh I went into the room and she come in and she said Daniel I think I know what's what's been causing this fear on on Autumn and I said well what do you think it is and she says well something come to me that it's the things we were watching and I said yes it is I said it is and I tell you what God has given us the Deliverance God has given us the spirit that he would feel welcome in our house now and our daughter has been sleeping fine amen oh GL to God Amen fear will come in anxiety will come in if you open up amen if you if you but if you made it a place where God was welcome amen if you played the tapes and and you played this message the day and and you begin to pray constantly that fear will feel uncomfortable and leave your home amen anxiety would feel uncomfortable and leave your home amen the angel of Lord encampeth round about them that fear the Lord amen it doesn't mean you ain't going to have to fight Amen to keep them out but the power and but he's given you the power and the authority to keep them Spirits out of your house amen Adam and Eve were hidden by behind the word and when they stepped out from behind the word it opened the door for Satan to come in do you believe that Amen brother brandom says they were hidden behind the word and when they stepped out from behind the word that's when Satan came in amen but I want to tell you tonight you're not hidden behind the word you are the word amen the first Adam was behind the word and he fell but the second Adam was the word and if his word Can't Fail then you can't fail amen Jesus said I will be with you even in you amen and we become one with Christ amen you're no longer behind the word but you become the word oh my it's the word made flesh once again in a many membered part amen we cannot fail he's already made a way he's already made the way just keep walking keep pressing don't give up amen the angel of the Lord is there with you you're not alone fear not you're not alone go and possess every promise of God for more are they with us than they that be with him amen don't be afraid if you fall down don't be ashamed when you make a mistake you're going to fall down many of times oh many of times I've fallen your pastor oh many of times he is falling but it's not how many times you fall it's how many times you get back up again and keep pressing and keep going Amen brother Brenham says when you fall down there's a great host of Angels standing there to pick you up oh my don't fear about tomorrow Don't Fear the Future we don't know what the future holds but We Know Who Holds Tomorrow bless the Lord we know who holds the future yes yes the world is putting their faith in the next president oh my there's a lot of people putting their faith in Trump to be our deliverer amen they're putting their faith in the next president they're putting their faith in their money they're putting faith in their guns but the Bride of Jesus Christ has put her faith in her husband Jesus Christ amen cuz I've tried him I've tested him and he's never failed me not one time amen he's always been faithful his promises are always true am fear not fear not here tonight faith faith brings results amen yes watch God move on your behalf if you would just release your faith tonight yeah Faith brings results one time hundred years ago or hundreds of years ago Pharaoh made a decree to kill the newborns in Egypt one night and there was a mother who put her trust in God and made a little basket a little Arc and put Moses in it and pushed her down the Nile River full of crocodiles and trusted God to watch over him amen she she trusted God she stepped out in faith she trusted God to watch over him and brother brandham says or said that God called 10,000 angels to go along the Nile to to to to keep that baby safe to Watch Over Baby Moses that no harm would come to him and he said as that little Ark was going down the river Gabriel the Angel rode on top of the basket and anytime a crocodile would come up upon that little Ark he would drive that crocodile back amen they took their watch because a little mother placed her faith in God that God would do the Imp Possible Oh my God sent angels to Watch Over Baby Moses amen don't be weary don't be scared amen don't be upset just have faith and believe hallu brother Bram says fear Makes You Weary fear makes you wonder and if I was going to die in the morning what good would it do me to get all up stewed up about it what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning morning and in my life had to end in tomorrow morning what good would it do to me to worry about it well you say what good would it do you to have faith faith can sign my pardon sure there's value in faith amen another place she says lady sitting back there right back at the end of the row there has got a hard trouble sitting there looking at me like that don't fear don't fear your faith saved you just then you believe with all your heart do you if you do you may have your healing amen don't fear that cancer don't fear that that diabetes don't fear that liver and lung trouble why cuz greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world just release your faith and you will see the results oh my another quote he says and if you notice it's when you are discouraged that's when the the devil can really pour it on you oh yeah yeah that's when he gets you if you come to the church and say well I don't know I don't know whether I'll get any better or not I've been prayed I've been prayed for twice oh my you might as well go home that's all and when you can cast that aside God don't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset just walk in his love amen knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you there's neither Powers things present things future nothing can separate us from him we're in him and we never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and brought us into him amen so it's his business to take care of what he took himself no man can PL them from my father's hand cuz he's the greatest one of them all amen it's the father who takes care of it who's got more power than God so what kind of power have you got over to take care of you the whole powers that created the universe amen that took the solar system and blew it like that and every Star went to it Place sure he watches over you amen that's the kind of father we have can you give the Lord a hand clap of Praise thank you Jesus he by choice elected you and it's up to him to take care of you oh my Hallelujah we have nothing to fear tonight we can walk down the streets of pony Oklahoma of Still Water of Tulsa and not not fear amen we can drive down the road in a rainstorm and not fear we can be on our home in a tornado come by and we not fear amen bones can be bursting all around us and why be and we not fear because more are they with us tonight more are they his angels are en are encamped around them that fear Him amen yes yes yes yes if the musicians will come praise the Lord more are they with us than they that be with them he said I will give his angels charge over thee amen just another testimony me and me and uh the family was Britney and the girls were in Ohio not too awful long ago a month or two ago and uh I don't remember why we was there we stopped at Uncle Jonathan's and visited with him for a little bit and uh we was on our way back to Seth's house and uh it was raining it was dark and it was just oh it was wet cold and uh we had stopped and grabbed a little snack and we pulled out and and my wife prayed for the food and she said Lord protect us and this rainstorm watch over us till we go home and we was sitting there at this red light and our light was red and you everybody knows Martins don't have patience and they can be stubborn and we sitting at this red light for a long time and all the lights were red that side this side in front of us or here all of it was red and no one was going and it was dark and raining and and I was getting impatient I was just like come on come on turned green and when that light turned green I didn't move I just stood there staring at the green light and and right when I was about to go a car ran through red light and come right in front of us we could it was on my side it was on Autumn side but the angel of the Lord was encamped round about us and he protected us and I couldn't help I we teared up we both were shaken a little bit because I should have went yeah I mean everything was in me was ready to go but I just sat there and I stared it's because the angel of the Lord was there and he watches over his children God will do anything he can to protect you he'll call a great host of angels oh the world is looking dark oh the world is looking Bleak oh it don't look like we have much of a future but don't look at the darkness of the world don't look at your problems don't look at your situations for more are they with us than they that be with them oh are you thankful for that tonight oh my I just love the Lord Amen brother Kobe we are standing on Holy Ground are [Music] stand on Holy Ground [Music] I know that there are angels they're all [Music] around Let Us [Music] Praise Jesus now [Music] for we are standing in his presence on Holy Ground can you just worship him tonight we are standing oh are still don't fear tomorrow Don't Fear the Future given his

thank you let us prise [Music] Jesus now oh yeah we are stand Hallelujah [Music] one Apostle Paul says we we don't come to the mountain that burnt with fire but we come to Mount Zion to an innumerable company host of angels all around us those angels are there oh fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom but we've got to walk by faith fear closes the supernatural presence of God up from us when you let your spirit get troubled when you've got the vibration ations in your spirit that that that is creating that doubt that's the reason why I always say those vibrations are there deal with it if you've got something against your spouse or you're allowing something and that that vibration in your spirit it keeps the supernatural away deal with that forgive or talk it out whatever you've got to do or or you know Satan will get us get you all worried about you know about this you know your family or about the job or about something and and and and and he does it for a reason just to keep and before you know it that spirit is just just hovering over that home the prophet says right when the spirit of the Lord is fixing to do something in the church service he says those babies are really sensitive he'll hit one of those babies and get them to crying just to get just to get that that that part of the audience uh troubled to keep somebody from a blessing well if that can happen in the middle of a church service what about in your home as brother Daniel was saying you allow those things in your home but if you keep the heart pure and you keep that home a sanctuary and you say Lord let Faith live here well my goodness his presence will be right there with you he's right there how many of times he's right there with you right when you're when you're when you're battling it's just the devil of battling amen and sometimes it is a battle to keep your spirit right and when I say your spirit right you know I I I I just always call it that vibration I know when my spirit is troubled I know when the vibrations are there when I'm nervous when something is trying I know it's the devil that's making me nervous I know it's the devil trying to to to get me uptight in a certain situation Hallelujah well glory to God Amen the boys remember when we were there in Canada that time uh I believe it was uh Michael Kobe and Caleb and U we had just we had we got got up there to go preach a on this side in the back started screaming and um and said uh he's dead he's not breathing he's dead and she had this baby and um and she was scre just all of us I mean me I just I the way she done it it just the musicians everyone took off running from the front and um and just that pandemonium hit the place and and brother the brother Danny was there and he and he took me and just pushed me out and uh and so once I knew that I had the floor then I said everyone let's stop and the and by this time the woman was running over to us and and the the baby was just black just couldn't breathe and and um had was having a seizure or something there and and um and I said please please let's stop never run don't get fearful in these kind of times so I said only believe let's start singing so the musicians went back we started singing and as the congregation got their thoughts together then we took the baby and I said Satan you tried you tried to kill this child and you have tried to get our hearts off of the promise but I rebuke you now in the name of Jesus and then all of a sudden a a deep breath he came back and um was back in in his grandma's arms just looking back around again see Satan he wasn't just trying to kill the child but he was trying to keep the Deliverance for the child that was the best place to be is there with the Believers that believes in the Supernatural but Satan wanted to come and get all of our hearts including me as I say I'm mean I I Shak it I mean the way she screamed in the way I mean it was it it was not a time uh uh another it was another time at that same camp and a young man came up and since I've been here immediately fear took over because I knew the situation and I'm and I'm going oh oh now now my brother listen you can't do that you've got to ask your mother we don't want to be liable you've got to talk and then all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord was with me and the pastor was there too and and the spirit of the Lord just spoke to me and said I've touched that boy and I looked at him and at first doubt started to coming back in as if he started and I says young man man if you feel like God has touched you then don't you let that enemy because I'm here to tell you buddy when he went a few days without his he he' swallow his tongue and I want it would be violent that young man would just just that those seizures were so bad on him something that he had had all of his life amen and he looked at me and I said I'm I'm going to keep track of you and I'm going to be celebrating with you well I seen his sister I seen his sister a year or so ago and I asked how is he doing she says he's never had another seizure since never had another one since you see when Faith steps up oh don't let fear interpret anything when Faith steps up just believe that and let God let God do the work in you can you amen I believe that and it's nothing that we make up we don't we don't make these things happen we simply choose to trust in God and you can trust in God while taking your medicine you can trust in God Amen it there that's that's that's not the problem the medication is is is nothing the prophet has already taught us those principles the thing is is we're not going to allow fear allow the the angels of God to encamp around you and when the holy spirit amen comes upon you accept it don't you be so entrenched in your Traditions don't be so entrenched in the way you do things when the angel of the Lord comes down and bring troubles that Waters in your heart and let you know that it's yours just accept it right there amen aren't you glad for God's holy spirit did you enjoy that message tonight oh God I don't want fear I let don't don't allow fear in me Lord amen and I I at the beginning of the message brother Daniel mentioned amen that that faith and love are twins amen they they're they're connected together amen you can't have true faith without love and you can't have true love without faith and God is the one that gives you the faith God so loved you that he gave himself for you and he called you if we could just rest in that and love him oh how their faith is unlimited faith is unlimited let me look to him believe in him can you say amen amen what's that I'm no longer I'm no longer a Slave to [Music] fear for I am a child of
