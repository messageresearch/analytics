it just means something to the Lord too he'll just come right on down amen praise the lord well it's good to be here tonight amen and and good to see all of you here that is here and and uh what wonderful weather we have had uh We've we've actually got us a spring this year and so we're sure thankful to the Lord for that and we we thank the lord for keeping his hands upon everyone this week and I trust everyone is is doing well I'd like to look here in in first Timothy 1 and 17 and um we're going to do something a little bit different here tonight and uh I I would like for those who know how to read to to have Bibles and um uh Forest now I think for if if there's if there's folks that do not have Bibles um uh brother Harry I think there's some Bibles there in the in the Sunday School room or or in that room there the uh Deacon room or the song leader room so uh when we sat down we'll see who all needs Bibles and and then make sure we we get those to you but they're in in first Timothy 1 and um and 17 it says now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise God be honor and Glory forever and ever a man I'd also like to turn to First Timothy 6 and 14. 6 and 14. praise the Lord it says that thou keep this commandment without spot uh unrebukable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ now we've just talked about the king amen Immortal invisible the only wise God says wait until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ which in his times he will show a man or manifest or openly Express who is that blessed and only potentate the King of Kings the Lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honor and power Everlasting amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you tonight for your blessings upon us we thank you for your words and Lord the presence of the Lord that we have felt during these songs and we ask Lord that you would Lord just continue to be with us and that you would Lord Enlighten our understanding and Lord let us leave this place here with a with a deeper appreciation for you and a greater revelation of Who You Are father I'm just asking that you would be with us in this service this remainder portion and Lord that you would receive all glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated praise the Lord so if there's anyone who is who is needing a Bible just raise your hand up here and um because what we're going to do we're going to we're going to have a quiz uh or not not necessarily I guess it's going to be like a quiz um but I'm wanting to put some scriptures out and and maybe maybe divide this portion of the church up from this portion of the church and um uh see how fast we can find some scriptures and um and things like that and I because you know we're we're in a there's there's a two purpose here and we're going to be dealing with a godhead tonight and I I uh so number one I want you to know uh who you uh why we believe what we believe and you need to have scripture for it you need to be able to um there's only one needing a Bible while I'm talking amen are you pointing at her Lily so Lily needs one anyone else here no you got to have a Bible okay he's got a Bible he's got he's going to get you one Robert Angel oh hey and and actually yeah no we're not looking these things up with tablets tonight now brother William oh my word you bring you don't bring that thing that you that you've already that you've been playing games and everything on you gotta bring your Holy Bible okay um all right so so first of all you always bring your sword to church Amen brother Michael always bring your sword to church brother Michael learned that early on as a kid and so hey we're almost to the point look at here we've got Bibles amen you know he's expecting a bunch of you not to have your Bibles and so um you've got a testimony okay go right ahead Fresca's got a testimony praise the Lord that's that's awesome Hallelujah amen Okay so I we want we want to now I want you guys not to just turn there but if you've got a pin or something Mark some of these in in the if you got a tablet uh but uh but I want us to know why we believe now I've put some scriptures together and I'm I'm hoping I'm putting them in order now um um and to to where we can um uh it I want you to see the the Oneness of God in the in the body of Jesus Christ and I I want you to see it that you in the scripture and but I don't want you just taking my word for it so what we're what we're going to do now I think that number one he that wins Souls the scripture says is what wise now imagine they're they're in Colossians 4 and 5 it says walk in wisdom toward them that are without Redeeming the time let your speech be always with Grace seasoned with salt that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man in order to know what you're how to answer every man you need to know what you're talking about now when we talk about when we listen there is not a greater revelation than to than this Revelation that God became flesh to save you he did not just save you but that but God is now in another body he's in you through the same spirit that was in Christ amen now so so we want to uh there in First Peter 3 and 5 it says sanctify the Lord God in your hearts be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ so so there's going to be a lot of people who don't understand you and they're going to be a lot of people that talk about you they talk about our church they call us whatever and and that and and that would hurt my feelings amen uh if if it wasn't based on Bible but we everything we have is based on Bible and I want to say if we turn it around and start asking them about their belief system well amen if you can't back it up with Bible then they are the cult amen you're following a man we follow Jesus Christ the word amen and that Revelation amen so then there and before we get started there in second Timothy 2 and 14 it says of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no Prophet but to sub uh to the subverting of the hearers study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth is that right now I'll tell you um brother Branham says the Oneness of God is all the way from Genesis 1 and 1 to Revelations 22 1. but the people have been so Blinded By An unscriptural dogma of a trinity and the Dogma is so universally accepted that to try to see a one God person is all but impossible if people can't see the truth of the godhead but fight it they can't ever see the rest of the truth because the Revelation is Jesus Christ in his church and his works in the midst of The Seven Ages and so these are that this is something that I I thought as we're as we're beginning to start going into Revelations and and we dealt a little bit with the and and the Beast the uh the other day and um now I now listen I asked for folks to give me uh questions if you were in the slightest bit confused I mean Austin says listen I didn't even I I quit taking notes and I just started writing questions you lost me at the beginning amen and and so if if you've got questions especially when we start when we start getting into these things hey I I would rather have class participation because if I'm if if I'm confusing you then we're not doing any good so you got to just you got to say hey hey um I'll start over amen and then and then we'll we'll see we'll see what we can do because um some of these things are are very important and I want us all to catch them so if you're not catching it amen throw your hand up and say hey but you know or what or something like that can you say Matt so I I um okay so this is uh sister go ahead and put that first one up now what we're going to do we're just going to sort of make this uh we're going to divide this one up and whoever finds whoever finds the answer first let you just let us know we're not keeping score or anything tonight and we're definitely not wanting this to get out of control like like we did at Christmas amen and uh but but I want us to um amen so so we we have it here that God created and lived in the body of Jesus Christ he mediated as a human what scripture where is this found for there is one God and one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus now if you boys want to go with some of the elders and you you and you girls too want to get with some of the others and let them show you how to find that there's a concordance in the back of your Bibles that that'll um and this is one of the reasons why I'm wanting to do it all right you've got it [Music] Hallelujah Okay so well that what what how well that's going to do you amen okay so that is all right so that was what that is two that is first Timothy 2 5. so mark that down make make sure and make sure you're writing this down this this these are incredible scriptures that we're going to be studying if anyone wants any markers if you want to if you want to mark your scriptures here I've got I've got some highlighters in here if someone wants to use one which which color do you want I want my I want my highlighters back amen you want green now now put it on the side of it just in case it it might be too dark all right I've got two more left these guys already asked as I say I don't know how dark those are going to be on the on the deal there so oh we've got we've got a couple more here one more two more you okay who was that with each these two were asking for them while ago all right so all right so here now now I want you to we got to see this God created a blood cell in the womb of a of of a virgin and then God lived in the body of Jesus Christ it was not there is no no such a thing as the Eternal Sun there it don't make sense a son is begotten a son is born there is no such thing as the trinitarians put it Eternal sin no that's not scriptural there is an eternal God who created a body and that body became uh is now the dwelling place of the Eternal God and there's only one God you'll ever see and that is Jesus Christ he lives in the body of Jesus Christ now again anything you all want want to do this you just you just go ahead and let's go to the next one sister keys amen and so yet he so he mediated as God as man but then he also mediated as God that's not going to quite work hey that no no that didn't do it amen he was almost there right there right right there okay so now all right answer this question whoever can find that I've given you exactly where it's at to with that blank was in Christ reconciling the blank blank not imputing their trespasses unto them hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation yes you got you gotta fill in the blank Amen to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself this is this is big news buddy this is big news we're talking about the very God of all creation is out to redeem amen all right now once God entered into the body of Jesus Christ once you not then you're going to find that that it is synonymous Jesus and the father were synonymous once God moved into that body amen uh uh they're they're in Saint John uh 12 and 44. that next one there sister kalila foreign I'm sorry I gave the answer amen all right go ahead and turn there uh yeah okay so but let's go and turn there anyways Saint John 12 and 44. and Jesus cried and said because they were having a hard time with Jesus Jesus was saying he he he he was saying that that he's the son of God and they're saying God don't have a son you can't the the Eternal God can't have a a body and Jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me amen I I I I messed that one totally I'm all right but on him that sent me so so what we're seeing here amen Jesus is here for one purpose he is the body that God created moved on the inside amen now he you've got to believe that sacrifice of that body amen it was God in Christ all right khalila I I want to look on your report there because I've got my answers all right here amen all right so um all right so Jesus was the invisible God's Earthly image now now Colossians 1 and 12. it says giving thanks unto the blank amen which which made us uh uh meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who delivered us from the power of Darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is blank blank blank blank blank who is the image of the invisible God now do you see what now I want you to see what is taking place here when Jesus was on Earth it was God coming in for Redemption he created this body to do the work in amen all right praise the Lord we'll go to the next one now amen and um all right what what uh what's what what what book does it say for it please blank blank that in him should all fullness dwell thank you amen it's Colossians that's right what does it say it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell are you boys catching it are y'all are y'all able to find the scriptures because if y'all need help get with some of these other guys to help you because I want I this is this is good here too because we're we're in a day of of of uh tablets and uh but I I'd like for you all to know how to find these these scriptures in the back of your uh by using your concordance as well all right another scripture amen there in John 14 and 7. let's go let's let's look at that praise the Lord are you there okay if ye had known me you should have known my father also from henceforth you know him and have seen him Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it suffices us Jesus said unto him have I been so long a time with you and yet hast thou not known me Philip he that hath seen me hath blank blank blank hath huh seen the father how sayest thou then show us the father believeth thou not that I'm in the Father the father in me the words I speak unto you I speak not of myself can you say Amen now uh oh or I'm sorry but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth what he doeth The Works amen so now these are these These are are are things I want you to really put down there don't don't we're not blindly following anything you've got to have Bible for what you believe amen see some people think well well we we got to believe in a trinity because it keeps saying Father Son and Holy Ghost those are three dispensations it's three offices of the one god Jehovah above us it was God walking with us now it is God living in US if you don't see that you're missing Redemption this is this is the beauty of redemption we are not wanting to someday achieve we are his sons he lives within us we're his body can you say Amen now so the great is the mystery of godliness uh if you go to that next one God manifest In the Flesh now now there in first Timothy 3 and 16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness so when you find that you can complete that amen all right that's that's wonderful all right Colossians Colossians 2 and 9. praise the Lord and when you find when you get to Colossians 2 and 9 y'all y'all let me know praise the Lord amen all right who wants to read it Dylan wants to read it for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily amen so Jesus now you and I have the spirit by measure you you and I just we get we we've got and it and together we we we we are I I might be an ankle you might be a leg we're all together the body of Christ and we all have a portion of the spirit within us Jesus did not have a portion of the spirit now remember on the day of Pentecost cloven tongues of Fire split up amen it was the great Pillar of Fire split up and a portion of God went into to all of the Believers now but Jesus had all of God somebody say oh of God now now let's let's look here at the uh at the next one here let's look here at John 3 and 34. now as again we I didn't do this as we do a quiz to try to I I want I want us to get there and um and and see this because and and and you need to have an answer for yeah I I you know I man there's so much there's so much scripture in the Bible that I'm not even putting in there tonight it's just the the the Redemption and and God God's plan for redeeming you and I it's just from Genesis to Revelation guys amen I'm just putting a few scriptures in here uh that I think would would would uh do good for our young people and for us adults as well but John 3 and 34 for he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God for God giveth not the spirit blank blank unto him he giveth not the Spirit by measure in other words he's not just giving a little bit he emptied the entire godhead in the body of Jesus Christ and the father loved the son and hath given all things into his hands now this is something uh now I think this one here everyone knows uh uh you know this next scripture and um they're in there in Isaiah nine and six we could probably all Quote it uh without even looking at it maybe you wouldn't even have to turn to it I wonder if any of you I wonder who can finish that without even looking at the Bible right now For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given a senior hand and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called amen all right wonderful that's that's wonderful praise the Lord so who is Jesus Jesus his name is wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace now this is for unto us a child is born Isaiah nine and six a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulders his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace amen now what did what did Gabriel say on the next one there sister Keys amen now what scripture is this found in Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us um Matthew you're exactly right amen all right amen Jesus there in John Hallelujah I didn't put nothing in that and Jesus Jesus said there in John 5 and 43 I come in my father's name ye receive me not if another should come in his own name him will you receive now see now the Oneness the Oneness we're not Oneness like the Oneness uh denominations the Oneness do not accept the sonship they do not accept that Jesus could become uh sin they do not accept that they they they they they try to and and you can't make the Bible I mean it plainly says that he has a father he has a father but that God lives in that body amen my God lived in that body now let's go to the next one there sister keys amen for this cause I bow my knees what what not did I did I not I'm just giving all the answers here amen okay amen all right so Jesus says I come in my father's name now here in Ephesians 3 and 12 for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family of Heaven and Earth is named amen Jesus came in his father's name I I tell you the father's name is Jesus the son's name is thee are synonymous when God moved into the body of Jesus Christ that's right God the spirit that Spirit there's only one Spirit we're fixing to get into some of that there's only one spirit there's only one Lord there's only one God and he lives in the body that flesh of Jesus Amen so yes Jesus Took on that that name of which the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named now people ask what Jesus had to come as a savior Jesus God is is the great God but then the second person of the godhead had had to come he's the Savior he's the one that had to come down and take care of business well the scripture says very plainly there's only one God and he is the savior now let's just look at it here amen to the next one there yes that's that's exactly right he had to pay the role of a Kinsmen Redeemer and here's the deal here's the deal a Kinsman had to be the one to redeem so so if you didn't if you weren't if you weren't kin then you couldn't do it now here's the double whammy because these were God's children God Sons and Daughters they they come from eternity amen and yet here they are in a fallen condition Satan's claimed them now as his he's the first he's the first of kin according to the flesh he's he's that next of kin that came before and Boaz that that came in and says you know I'll redeem them but you see God came down in a with a greater cause God had to step out of Eternity create a body to do the work of a Kinsmen God could have just said you know just just just don't worry about it I'll you know the dinosaurs have all been wiped off will will let them be wiped off too no no no no no no God had Sons he can't wipe them off they're real legitimate Sons their Spirit of his Spirit they're as Eternal as he is eternal but they're trapped in sin in a body of decay and God says I'm going to get them back I'm going to redeem them I'm going and I don't care what kind of a hell hole you came out of God says I will get to them I will not lose one of them they are mine man Hallelujah now he always was a savior but he couldn't save he couldn't redeem now he would he would roll back the Red Sea he would but there was no way that anyone could that he could even save your soul you couldn't be saved unless you paid the price of that Kinsmen Redeemer it was going to have to take a body to die and go to hell let's look at this amen they're they're in Hosea 13 and 4. I guess you've probably already turned there by now amen who's got the answer to that one all right so let's read it together yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt Thou shalt know no no God but me for there is no savior beside me amen all right let's go to the next one praise the Lord they're in they're in Isaiah 43 and 10. Hallelujah now whoever gets there the first you got to yell it out because yeah right you're here all right Kobe's man he's got you all right so Kobe you read it the next one I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior he's a savior but in this spirit remaining in the spirit he can't he can't redeem you he can't redeem you he's got to be kin folk not just in the not just in the spirit but he's got to be Kinfolk in flesh amen now let's look at another one praise the Lord all right we're at an Isaiah does it say tell ye and bring them near yea let them take counsel together who hath declared from this from this from ancient time who have told it from that time have not I the Lord there is no God else beside me a just God and a savior there is none beside me look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else huh all right 45 and 21. that's that's exactly right amen now it's got some more that goes with it just needs to go up a little bit more I have sworn by myself the word is going out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return that unto me blank blank blank blank huh every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess shall swear is that right but he didn't have a body to bow to the savior he was God he was savior but he didn't have a body let's leave let's see what the Apostle Paul says amen they're in Philippians 2 and oops did I did I did I go beyond that amen oh good I didn't give away anything all right Philippians 2 and 6. let's all go over there real quick praise the Lord and we're going to go uh Cleveland that's going to go from six all the way down to 11 here in a minute now it's so it's going to show the plan here's going to plan God had to take on the form of a human being he had to live like us he had a hurt like us he had to die like us now watch who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself become obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God has highly exalted him who that body and given him a name which is above every name that at the blank blank blank every knee should bow huh at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things in Earth things under the Earth that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory oh Hallelujah God was able to accomplish what he was looking for God came crafted a body moved on the inside of that body and he purchased the the Redemption for every one of you can you say Amen amen now now let's look now you know we'll let's we'll just go on let's just see what God has done so now here he's he's got the body he was born and said it'll be God With Us amen then Jesus in his Works he's saying hey if you can't if you if if he when you see when you see the works that I'm doing you you've got to believe it as it's from God because it's God in my body doing these things amen and he's and he says and and he says if you know if if you just go to the Bible whom you think you have eternal life and they're the very ones that testify of me he's talking about the redeem then he comes now here he comes Jesus God there in Isaiah is needing a uh he says I am I am the Savior and there will come a time when the every knee shall bow every tongue is going to confess to me the Apostle Paul comes in and says here it is here's the body to the glory of God every knee is going to bow to Jesus now let's look at what Jesus says here in in uh in the next one amen now and what scripture is this found God who at sundry times Hallelujah in diverse manner spoken time past unto the fathers by the prophets and hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things Hebrews Hebrews 1 and 1 that's exactly right amen appointed heir of All Things by whom he he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the blank blank of his person being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had made by by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high now the Apostle Paul would not be talking about this this glory and then and and and and and then come in and tell us sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty then we then we stop and we think well oh no well now we got now we've got two gods in heaven no no no when the Apostle Paul is using the right hand he's talking about Authority his son an adopted son was placed amen he just talked about how he has appointed Heir he is up he is appointed as uh uh the right hand it in the Bible signifies a Authority dominionship adoption especially if you look back in the Old Testament when they adopted the sons it was it was in a day that was set and and and and everyone would come and they would adopt this son uh and place him over the kingdom amen so so we we look to that let's see amen okay so what's the next one there sister keys praise the Lord all right we just we just done that one didn't we we sure did we just done that one that's the one that had a lot of good stuff in it amen okay uh let's go on to the next one we don't we don't use this uh that projector often on on this kind of thing and so she's she's having to really work with it to get it to do something do anything amen so um all right now through that body when Jesus because Jesus it's a man a man I I I I I I want you to really catch this now God took a man and placed that man high in the heavens now that's the body of God and it's showing what he's going to do with every one of you mortal beings that is coming to bring man and women back into that relationship it's all God's plan God's so loves people that God became a mortal man and God exalted that body and placed him in the highest oh he didn't place the Angels the scripture says unto which of the Angels did he say to sit on my right hand he says he took a mortal man matter of fact before we go any further let's read on down there in Hebrews Hebrews the first chapter real quickly and and then and then we'll finish our our little our thoughts here praise the Lord amen they're in they're in Hebrews um amen Hebrews one and three who being the brightness of his glory one and three the brightness of his glory the express image of his person upholding All Things by the power of His a word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins set down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being so much better than the angels as he hath by Excellence obtained a more excellent Name than they were talking about Immortal we're talking and then God would place that man in a position to represent you I love it amen for unto you of which of which the Angels said at any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be to him a father and he will be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith let all the angels of God worship him all the angels He said who maketh his Angel spirits and his and his Ministers of flame of fire he says but unto the son he saith thy Throne o God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou Hast loved righteousness and hate iniquity therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows and thou Lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens or the works of thine hands they Shall Perish but thou remain us they are shall wax old as a garment and the vesture shall fold shall thou fold them up and they shall be changed but Thou Art the same thy ears shall not fail to which of the Angels said he at any time set on my right hand until thine enemies uh until I make thine enemies thy footstool are not they all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister to them who are The Heirs of salvation who are The Heirs of Salvation he through Christ God through Christ has reconciled to us you and I are The Heirs well glory to God I love it I love it amen all right let's let's go down to the next one here amen um okay they're in they're in second Corinthians 5 and 21. have you already turned there second Corinthians 5 and 21. you boys there it's pretty good you girls there wonderful wonderful all right so second Corinthians 5 and 24. for he and I put in princes the father hath made him Jesus to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the blank of God in him the righteousness you see God couldn't die God had to create that body to die God never died God didn't die at Calvary in fact when God separated himself from Jesus that's when Jesus said father why hast Thou forsaken me amen Hallelujah but he had a purpose he had a plan bloody he suffered you think you said for rejection Jesus took all of the penalty of your sin your shame all of your wrongs upon him and died as the most horrible Sinner's death went to hell for you to pay that price amen praise the Lord praise the Lord all right now because of Jesus victory you become the righteousness of God through him now the prophets could only point to what was coming amen now now Romans 3 and 24 look at this Hallelujah Romans 3 and 24. and when you get there you can say Amen Hallelujah all right who's got it who's who's there first all right lynnae you want to read it to us amen whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through blank in his blood faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus well praise the Lord amen Hallelujah now this is a familiar past this next one is a familiar passage of scripture amen but where is this found be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which the builders said it not which said not a view Builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is blank blank blank under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved huh no other name under Heaven Can you say Amen all right now amen weak we've got it clear that God is Jesus father but I want you to know that that God is your father too amen now you you look there uh they're in in Matthew 23 and 9. it says call no man your father upon the Earth for one is your blank which is in heaven that's right amen that's that's that's your father which is in heaven you've got a Heavenly Father amen all right the next one I'm sorry if I'm going too fast there amen it says but now Our Father we are the clay Thou Art the Potter and we all are the work of thine hand so it's not only Jesus father but he's your father but where's that found at Isaiah 64 and 8 that's exactly right amen Ephesians 4 and 6 oops amen finally I got an interesting there where you'd have to search a little bit amen there's one God and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all amen so there's one God and Father amen it's above us he's in he's manifesting can you say Amen now we went through this here here some time ago but but it I think it Bears who is who is the father of of Jesus amen is it is it God the father or is it the Holy Ghost amen it's it's the same thing it's the same thing and and and you you look there and um uh where is that at going to the next one there kalila uh Luke 1 35 amen let's look there at Luke 35 135. praise the Lord amen and the angel said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God all right the next one where is it found where it says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph and before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost Now where's that found at Matthew that's right amen all right if you're going down to the 20th verse uh well there I go again but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost now you see you you to me it's a lot harder to make a trinitarian Doctrine out of out of out of the Bible than it is to just accept that God is manifesting himself in three offices same one God it's the same God but he is manifesting himself he's come with the with with with the verbiage of of son so that you as a being a mortal man can identify with what God is doing he is he is trying to get you to understand he brings it down to our level to where we can understand and and I want you and again you are a son of God I'm not talking about I'm not talking about a Son of God uh because you're going to church you also were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and there were you had to be redeemed amen praise the Lord amen so uh uh now let's look here at this spirit for just a moment the Bible says they're in Ephesians 4 and 4. if you want to turn that amen praise the Lord Ephesians 4 and 4 there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling on up amen First Corinthians 12 and 13. praise the Lord now I think we we want to we want to see this here now I'm fixing to show you here in a minute how that okay the the the the spirit of Christ the spirit of God and the Holy Spirit I'm fixing to show you scriptures where they are all synonymous they all work right in together the Apostle Paul uses it many times and and um and and I'll show you there's one God one spirit amen now so it says uh First Corinthians 12 and 13 it says for blank blank blank four by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been made to drink in two one spirit amen now let's look at the Spirit what is this spirit it's the Holy Ghost it's the promise that God had said it's the promise that God gave that we would receive the Holy Ghost through Jeremiah through Isaiah now but let's look here at Joel and let's just see amen uh as Joel says it uh pretty plainly there in Joel 2 and 27. amen we'll give you time there to go uh uh Joel 2 and 27. you guys are already there all right amen for ye shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour blank blank blank I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions so while the Apostle Paul is constantly making he is constantly making a a a a a a a difference between the spirit the father and the son there is no difference between the Holy Spirit and the father God now are you saying well brother Wendell now you're making two Gods no we're not making two Gods it is the Jesus had a time he was born he had a time that he died he had a time he was resurrected he had a time and father God lives in that body when you get to heaven and you're looking for three and if you do see three when you get to heaven you probably won't be there in heaven because you'd have to be drunk amen you'd have to be drunk to see three of them in Heaven There is not three that you're going to see Hallelujah now they're they're in the fourth chapter of the Book of Revelations the Bible says and and he was caught up into heaven and there was one one that set on the throne one amen one that said on the throne so so yes Jesus set on his father's Throne oh when you see the beauty of it do you see how you you wouldn't even you wouldn't even be able to overcome the devils in any way shape or form if God didn't live in you amen but this one here Jesus Christ he is God Amen that was God that was God living there that was that was that was that was God laying in the manger that was God that was that that departed the uh or that that that calmed the Seas that was God that raised up Lazarus that was God it was God in his body then you'll never ever ever ever separate God from his body again amen now are we all are we all clear on that now you you you're again got anything you want to say make sure you let me know all right so where are we at sister keys amen okay there now here it is now there he told us I will pour out of my spirit my spirit upon All Flesh amen so when we when we look there at um amen I'm I'm I'm lost here okay amen Acts 2 and 16 but blank blank blank huh this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out of blank blank I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy well you're and your your young men shall see Visions your old men shall dream dreams now so huh well it is it's the same it's the same spirit it's the spirit of God amen it's one God living that life can you say Amen there are many Visions one Ephesians four and four amen praise the Lord I'm gonna I'm gonna keep that now that you're moving it up ahead of me I'll I'll quit looking at this amen well you can't you you can't separate okay you you look there it well yeah he's got uh when you're looking there in in the um especially like if you okay you look you take their um Revelation 5. that that's a that's a that's a scripture I love preaching out of okay so you've got one on the throne and then you've got a lamb that is coming over and taking the book so you want so so the trinitarians will say see see so you've got you've got one on the throne and then you've got a lamb well first of all you you've gotta you've got to miss you you don't you you uh you've got to understand in the way that these that these uh that the Apostle John was seeing it first of all there is not a woolly lamb in heaven there's not a woolly lamb that woolly lamb is there he put that there so that we can understand in our finite condition what God is doing there is no woolly lamb but it is showing you that lamb he God could never take the book without that lamb God could never redeem though he was the Savior without that body so he's showing us that that the body is showing us what it's for the body come in to fulfill the purpose of redemption take that book the title deed to the Earth and to uh redeem us back to that place with God so when you when you look there amen um you know let's just look here real quick let's let's just look at it now you're and again uh hey I'm glad I'm glad you're saying uh you you bring this up let's look here at Revelations five and one I seen in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals amen these are symbols these are symbolic and I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with her loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loosen the seals thereof no man in heaven neither in the earth neither under the Earth was able to take the book neither to look upon God him himself could not open the book he's got the God can't open it until he gets a body then the lamb steps forth takes the book there has to be a Kinsmen Redeemer to come in and to take that book and to open it there had to be a Kinsmen Redeemer there had to be a Kinsmen there had to be somebody that knew that could fill your pain that could do your soul Christ so it's showing here that God's got the book the one on the throne he's got the book no one is worthy to open it it was lost by man man is in sin and God in his own law says there has to be a Kinsman no one else can come and take that book no one else can come and redeem that that's that's the Old Testament uh a law of redemption oh but then the Lamb of God the body of God God through Christ took the book opened that book you were in that book the title deed to the Earth your position as sons of God going back to to the Garden of Eden again it was in that Lamb's work y'all see that so so you can see now now is there is it now if there's anything that's if if if there's any questions uh make sure make sure you ask that because amen uh because Sunday night there was a lot of you saying so so make sure you ask questions you're not gonna hurt my feelings if even if you think I'm wrong you can still you know you as long as you say it nice don't hurt my feelings amen yes yeah but you're never gonna but you're you're you'll you'll never do away with the body that body of Christ God will forever be in that body he will reign as king that's right there's not two no no it doesn't make two it makes yes yes taking that back God made us God made us in that image uh-huh yes bingo that's beautiful that's that's it's you and you're one person different offices different that's right that's right yeah that that that is exactly what God is he took it's it's it's he takes off one hat and puts on another hat still the same God but he takes off the one hat puts on another are you kidding you can you can't understand that um okay so when you all played somebody uh who some of y'all played two two different deals in that in our last play didn't you did when there's someone that done two different parts two different rows Brianna so what were you okay there you go see she took off the one she she acted in the one part and she and and and and and she was an angel and then in the next part of the scene she takes that disaster moth off puts in what were you again a guard going from Angel to killing people and then you better watch out amen but but the but the it's one God living oh what a plan it was something that only God could do there was no one else that could live this there was no one else that could play that part and no one could live that part no one could do it God had to come and live that life amen any other questions comments I like I appreciate that amen yes now the scripture says that his name shall be called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father and the reason is is once God moves inside that body then it becomes synonymous it becomes they become one Jesus says I and my father are one that that was the Holy Ghost that was God that was the all of God I'm fixing to show you here in a minute where where where the Apostle Paul uses the spirit of Christ spirit of God and the Holy Spirit all the same and all in one body all wrapped up in one body all wrapped up in one body now now but where where people get mixed up and and and and and this is where sometimes if you don't understand the sonship if you take away the sonship you've taken away Redemption that's the beauty God done what no one else could I love him I I I'd like to cry right now I'm telling you I love him so much What A Plan of Redemption and then Satan comes in with this Trinity thing and he comes in trying to do all of these other things and before you know it it's taking away it's taking away the preciousness of what God is trying to do what God is doing in our lives because I'm going to tell you right now uh uh uh sister Kaylee when we talk about the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're not talking about the third person the Trinity we're talking about the same God that done all of this in creating that body so that he could get to you and live in you he'd done all that was his path to get to you to you and he couldn't get to you to you until he'd done all of this other oh how beautiful how beautiful amen where am I at such keys all right so what scripture is there is hallelujah Ephesians amen now let's look let's look here amen the spirit of God and the spirit of Christ are interchangeable now let's look here on a few things here amen what you saying something oh all right so Ephesians 3 and 16 that he would Grant you I'll let you turn to it are you guys already there that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love now now what I want you to want you to look at this now we just settle it there's only one Spirit he said there's only one spirit so now he's saying that be that strengthened by his Spirit and the inner man that Christ May dwell in in your hearts uh by faith now let's let's go down to the next one sister keys amen all right let's look here at Romans 8 and 9. praise the Lord now I want you to watch how he's how he's talking about the spirit of God and then below him the spirit of Christ spirit of God Spirit of Christ Romans 8 and 9. but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his so there you are the the moment that God moved in that body it becomes synonymous it's now the spirit of God Spirit of Christ holy spirit it's all the same thing in that body all right now I'm fixing to I'm fixing to bring a wrapper up here guys amen right yeah are you all understanding Kaylee are you understanding that it's a it's the same spirit Hallelujah you all understand when when you when you kids when the Sunday School teachers teaching you you want Christ to accept Christ in your heart well you're thinking of you're thinking of how can a little Jesus Come into my heart no it's the same spirit that made Jesus who he was is now coming into you by the Holy Spirit making you like him Oh Glory all glory he makes he's making you like him the the life of the Eternal God living in you makes you jump just like Jesus amen amen now amen so with the spirit of God dwell in you and now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his amen now first first Corinthians 12 and 13. amen it says by one Spirit somebody say one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all been all made to drink in one spirit all right just write these down in your books in your deals because I'm going to just I'm gonna I'm gonna start spitting some stuff out to you and you can read it in your devotion all right so I'm going to show you Holy Ghost spirit of Christ spirit of God are all the same are you ready Acts 2 and 4 they this is about the Holy Ghost they were all filled with the Holy Ghost Acts 2 and 38 ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost acts 4 and 31 they were filled with the Holy Ghost all right now let's see what he says what what God Said and what he promised to send Acts 2 and 17 saith God I will pour out of my spirit on All Flesh Romans 8 9 the spirit of God dwell in you let's look at the Spirit of Christ Romans 8 and 9. if any man has not the spirit of Christ he has none of his Galatians 4 and 6 God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart Ephesians 3 and 16 that Christ May dwell in your hearts so when they're talking about the Holy Ghost spirit of God and the spirit of Christ it's all the same thing are we understanding all right now to me this here this here just Nails it down I want you kids make sure we all get to this place here when you have seen me I've I passed that over Cleveland I don't amen yes yes I think I've said that it's called the spirit of Christ because once the spirit dwelled in the body of Jesus now God's spirit is synonymous with Jesus amen that's why Jesus said when you have seen me you have seen the father amen the spirit of the father dwelt in him now let's go to that next one there in first John 5 and 7 and I want everyone to to go to this one amen Hallelujah I did not mean to take so long I've talked I've talked a little bit too much in between time amen Hallelujah now when we get into these others that we're going to talk about you say well why you know you talked about the Beast last week and and and the deal that was talking on the Beast was I was trying to get you to see there are kingdoms that makes those kingdoms act the way they are the United States and the world and the transgender and the adulteries and all these things that are going on the Anarchy that's going on that is the spirit of that's behind the kingdoms so when we're seeing all the lawlessness and stuff out there what we're trying to show you is that fourth Beast is a conglomeration of all the other beasts of Daniel it was it was the other world Empires that is now that has now come into one and now this guy is just causing Havoc we don't see it I mean all we see is kingdoms and legislations and all of this kind of stuff but there are spirits behind it amen so so we got that but when you look there in in the first and second chapter of the Book of Revelations it is dealing with the deity of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is God now you tried now now there's where there's where I sort of differ you that that's one God Amen now I know we've got some that that try to say that we're going to see two and they're you're not going to see two you're not going to see two you will never ever Hallelujah the Bible says well uh Hallelujah amen he is the invisible God now he shows himself with a rainbow he shows himself with the cloud he shows himself with a whirlwind but no one's ever seen God Jesus is the only one that is every Hallelujah and he's declaring him unto us amen all right now here's the deal right here I want no one installed I want you kids this here this here we'll put it all together where you kids can understand exact this this here will just clinch down what I've said all night long all right first John 5 and 7. there are three oh there are three that bear record in heaven and you're saying Oh Oh Brother winner you've been preaching some false Doctrine amen there are three that bear record in heaven the the the and these three are Trinity these three are and there are three that bear witness in Earth the spirit the water the blood and these three agree in one now how can how can the three in heaven be one it's the three offices that they are known for it was god Jehovah now living in in a body of Flesh now living in The Bride of Jesus Christ one God one God three offices but now there is a difference in the spirit baptism and the blood you can have the blood you can be justified and not be sanctified you can be Sanctified and not be filled with the Holy Ghost but when you get Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost then they agree in one in the consummation of a new birth there's a lot of people sitting in church they're Justified and they're not sanctified there's a lot of them that are Sanctified and they're not they don't have the Holy Ghost but what we want amen the three here on Earth that consummates a new birth what you know my wife when she had her he's got to break the water there's got to be blood there's got to be water and then there's got to be life amen the life comes into that baby and he he begins to breathe and so so once again amen we're thankful for that so once again uh uh the next one sister Caleb we just we've done that before but once again First Timothy 2 and 5 help me out here for there is one God and one mediator between God and man the man Jesus Christ oh we should forever more love him amen you know I I was when I was preparing I I I read some of the I read some Billy Graham had made a comment he said when they asked him in an interview explain the Trinity he says no one can understand the Trinity it's a it's it's it's a mystery no one no one can understand it they're in the Baptist the the big Baptist University in Texas uh Dr Bowles I think he's died now too but he says this will be something that you never understood that that's it's unexplainable and I say it's a wonderful thing when you can truly see what God has done and how precious his work is can you see man amen did you know as the musicians come did you know that this the same anointing the same anointing the Bible says they're in Luke 4 and 1. Luke 4 and 1 it says and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost return from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness now being full of the Holy Ghost the Bible says that he was led into the spirit to be tempted of the devil God was proving now this is where that question that you asked the other night or the the other day sister Steffy about Okay so if the dove if if the Dove came down at that point which was again it was another symbol it was a symbol of adoption then does that you was asking did he become God when he was 30 we thought he was God when he was born well I want to tell you that was a that was that was Jehovah laying in that Manger that was Jehovah playing with the kids that was Jehovah living in that body then why why the ceremony why is it that when he went to the when he went to the uh Jordan [Music] and the heaven opens it and you hear the voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell and you see lightning unto a dove coming and resting upon him what John had already been told the one that you see the dove rest upon he will be the Lamb of God he will be that lamb now he didn't know John didn't know John was just out there as a prophet saying the lamb cometh but he didn't know who the lamb was but when that anointing came down it was did you know that the priest in the Old Testament times the priests were not allowed to even enter into the priesthood until they were 30 years old then when they entered into the 30 years old then they would go in they would have the oil the anointing all would be poured on which is symbolic of the Holy Spirit coming up on them and placing them into the ministry placing them so at here we had God Emmanuel living in a body but Jesus never performed a miracle Jesus never had a sign until he come up out of that water what was it he was put into service that vessel that vessel even fulfilled the Old Testament priesthood here he was the very Lamb of God and when he walked out now here's the here's here's the kicker and this is something that's so beautiful to me [Music] the same word anointing when Jesus said the spirit of the Lord God is upon me and he hath anointed me is the exact same word that is used when the Holy Ghost comes upon you as the believer the exact same word in the Greek is used of you when you are anointed and put into service by the Holy Ghost it's no wonder that he says in my name you'll cast out devils The Works that I do shall you do also I hope I hope I I hope you're getting a a picture of what Christ come to do he come to tear down that middle wall of partition so that the spirit of God could come to you the spirit of God could not come to you until that body come to take care of redemption and you know what God didn't put away his body that body is still representing you tonight [Music] that body is still representing you there he is in a position of authority man God took a man God took a body chose to leave he could have he could have lived in a in a temple he could have lived in Gold he could have lived in anything but he chose to create a human being to live in foreign [Music] I know sometimes in our minds we get weary and and and and sometimes in our frailties and our failures and there's so many but I want to tell you God didn't abandon that body that body is still there that body is still representing You In Heaven There is a body there in heaven and God says I'm living in that body and this body that I used to redeem you that blood that was shed to save you that blood will be there to take you all the way [Music] you get weary you get tired but I've overcome I've overcome and I'm already here and I'm I'm waiting for you I'm waiting for you I'm waiting till all of my enemies become my footstool the body of God still dripping with blood to remind God of what he's done for you to remind God [Music] when God looks at the blood he sees the finished work [Music] and God looks the blood of his own hands in the body that he created to redeem you God sees you it reminds him I'll not lose a one of them I'll not lose one of them I love you laughs you might have scars tonight but I just want you to know that his scars you know what I believe I believe when we get to the other side those scars will still be there I believe we're going to see those scars those scars are trophies those scars are what it took to redeem your team you he loves you tonight Oh How He Loves You he was led up into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil you know what I believe God was proving that the spirit of God can overcome every Temptation by the word of the god and the Bible says they're in Luke 4 4 and 14 when he come down out of that Wilderness when he come back out of that Wilderness he stood there the Bible says he returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went a fat of Fame and it went to the temple that's the day that he proclaimed the spirit of the Lord God is upon me and he hath anointed me he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted preach Deliverance to the captives the recovering of sight to the blind to set all Liberty at Liberty them that are bruised preached the acceptable year of the Lord that body because he knew you were hurting he's seen your pain he's seen where you were going to be he felt that he knew it you were lost he was looking for a way he was he was slogging for way to redeem you [Music] wants that body went through their customs 30 years old the anointing comes upon him he goes to the Wilderness to be tested and tried and proven that it that that Satan can't take him and he walks straight to that Temple he's a little spirit is upon me and I'm here to deliver and said it Liberty my love my love can now be expressed I've got a beak I've got a body I've got something I can work with I'm your kin I am how redeem you I'll set you free I understand you [Music] the word annoying is
