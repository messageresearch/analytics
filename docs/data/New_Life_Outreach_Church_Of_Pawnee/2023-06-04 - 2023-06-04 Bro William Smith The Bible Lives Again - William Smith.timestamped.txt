[40:12] I was talking some Elders here
[40:16] and uh
[40:18] they're all concerned that we're so
[40:21] consumed in just reading quotes
[40:24] and not reading our Bibles to make sure
[40:28] not just be not to say well we want to
[40:31] make sure brother Brown is preaching it
[40:33] but a lot of times then their minds are
[40:36] thinking a lot of the trouble of the
[40:39] doctrines that's coming out there is
[40:41] they're not lining up with the word of
[40:43] the Bible and the message together and
[40:46] they're coming out making their own
[40:48] Doctrine and it's contrary to God's word
[40:51] we know that the message of the hour
[40:55] is Malachi 4.
[40:57] it told us in Malachi 4 exactly what
[41:01] Malachi 4 was supposed to do for us
[41:04] we can go into Revelations and it'll
[41:06] tell us exactly what that Malachi 4 was
[41:09] supposed to do we can go into Luke 17
[41:12] 30.
[41:14] we know these things
[41:16] but I want to tell on myself the other
[41:18] Wednesday night when brother window was
[41:20] asking us all to have our Bibles
[41:23] I didn't have my Bible
[41:25] and when brother Colby gave me his Bible
[41:30] it was a book
[41:31] and I couldn't find scriptures to save
[41:34] my neck
[41:35] and I said oh God
[41:38] first book they gave me I couldn't see
[41:39] because the letters were so small
[41:42] I don't even think I could have solid
[41:44] microphone glass
[41:45] then he gave me his precious little
[41:47] bible with bigger words
[41:49] but it was just like this Bible that was
[41:51] given to me over the weekend it didn't
[41:53] have these little things over here that
[41:55] I can find it real fast
[41:57] and I thought oh God I feel so bad
[42:01] so I went home and repented
[42:05] and so but it's good to be in the house
[42:07] of God and and we just love you and we
[42:10] just sure do appreciate each and every
[42:12] one of you and I am sorry that you have
[42:15] to listen to me instead of Pastor this
[42:17] evening
[42:18] but if we can open our Bibles this
[42:20] evening I got three scriptures
[42:22] or three different places to go and not
[42:25] going to hold you up too long but Romans
[42:29] 9
[42:30] and we can turn me way down
[42:34] I
[42:35] I don't care if I hear myself
[42:38] one of these days I'll get used to that
[42:40] but
[42:42] I haven't got used to it for 52 and a
[42:45] half years so
[42:46] uh that's why I don't talk to myself
[42:52] so Romans 9 and 23 and 24.
[42:56] he says
[42:59] and that he might make known The Riches
[43:02] of his glory
[43:04] on the vessel of Mercy which he had for
[43:08] prepared unto Glory even us
[43:12] whom he hath called
[43:14] not of a Jew only but also of the
[43:17] Gentile
[43:18] Gentiles let's go to John
[43:23] 12.
[43:32] and let's start at the 24th verse
[43:36] John 12 24.
[43:40] verily verily I say unto you except a
[43:43] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[43:46] die it abides alone
[43:49] but if it dies it bringeth
[43:51] forth much fruit
[43:54] he that loveth his life shall lose it
[43:57] and he that hateth his life
[44:00] in this world shall keep it unto eternal
[44:04] life
[44:05] amen let's go to John 5.
[44:13] John 5 and let's just read 1 24th verse
[44:18] verily verily I say unto you
[44:21] he that heareth my words and believeth
[44:24] on him that sent me hath everlasting
[44:27] life and shall not come unto
[44:30] condemnation
[44:31] but his past from Death unto life
[44:35] amen let's just bow our heads
[44:37] gracious Heavenly Father
[44:40] Lord we just love you father God
[44:45] and Lord the last couple of weeks Lord
[44:47] just kind of going over these
[44:50] messages of what brother Wendell has
[44:52] been preaching and the things that I
[44:54] have been
[44:55] studying on Lord and
[44:58] just
[44:59] been overwhelming Lord
[45:02] been a Christian Lord for
[45:05] 32 and a half years Lord and
[45:08] and you still amaze me Lord of your word
[45:12] thinking that I know something and then
[45:14] find out I didn't know it all
[45:17] and still learning
[45:20] it's amazing
[45:23] Lord I just ask you Lord to help me to
[45:25] get away
[45:27] and let you come and speak to your
[45:30] children
[45:31] Lord I pray only say what you want me to
[45:33] say Lord help me Father God
[45:36] Lord we just love you we thank you for
[45:39] your mercies and Grace those that
[45:41] couldn't make it Lord I pray that you
[45:43] help them Father God whatever they're
[45:45] doing Lord
[45:46] knowing that Brianna and now Robert is
[45:51] not feeling well
[45:52] Lord the devil's out roaring as a lion
[45:56] and we just ask you Lord God to be with
[45:58] them and those that are not feeling well
[46:00] father God
[46:02] and Lord those that couldn't make it
[46:03] because they had to go here there we
[46:05] just ask you father God to be with them
[46:08] we just love you we thank you for your
[46:10] mercies and Grace in Jesus name we pray
[46:12] amen
[46:16] God has a provided way
[46:19] oh you may be seated there's a little
[46:21] germ of Life lying there somewhere
[46:25] just as sure as the sun rise Yonder in
[46:28] the East and begins to shine warm upon
[46:32] the ground
[46:33] it lives again
[46:34] why
[46:36] God provided a way
[46:39] for
[46:41] for to it live again for it to live
[46:43] again
[46:44] if God
[46:47] if God
[46:49] made a way for the flowers to live again
[46:51] what about a man that's made in His
[46:56] image
[46:58] how God has made a way for us to live
[47:02] again
[47:04] my little thought
[47:06] than it is little
[47:09] it's not a big open up book of thousands
[47:13] of words like it usually is but the
[47:15] Bible lives again
[47:18] I was reading a message
[47:21] and brother random was talking about
[47:24] when he was over in India
[47:27] there was a man that was at the
[47:30] at the uh
[47:31] he got off on the airplane and there he
[47:34] was and he rose to his motel and there
[47:36] was
[47:37] hundreds and thousands of people there
[47:39] and they were going to a bunch of
[47:42] ministers were there and and they were
[47:45] getting ready and this one come up to
[47:46] brother Branham and told Brother Branham
[47:48] he says
[47:50] he says
[47:52] we have seen this and we've seen that
[47:56] but
[47:57] God has come with you
[48:01] and he says we are thirsting we're
[48:03] hungry for the word of God
[48:05] and we see in your gift
[48:08] the Bible lives again
[48:11] that caught my attention the Bible lives
[48:15] again
[48:18] and I
[48:20] I thought and it has been since the
[48:23] first or second time I ministered here I
[48:25] preached on if you remember some of you
[48:27] remember preaching on preparing the
[48:30] ground
[48:32] now since I've been here almost
[48:34] 10 years
[48:36] I see the way that the farmers here is I
[48:40] see the way the weather is here it's
[48:42] different than it is in New Mexico here
[48:45] your phrase line is about six to seven
[48:47] inches
[48:48] you can put a water line at eight inches
[48:50] nine inches in the ground and it'll
[48:51] never freeze here
[48:53] unless it gets below you know 20 to 30
[48:55] below zero then it freezes
[48:58] but in New Mexico it has to be below two
[49:02] feet
[49:04] if it doesn't get below two feet it will
[49:07] freeze and you have to dig it up
[49:10] because in New Mexico
[49:12] even if the ground is dry after a foot
[49:15] it gets solid hard Frozen
[49:19] it it has a little bit of moisture there
[49:21] it will actually turn into ice
[49:26] and so as I was telling ones last time I
[49:29] ministered this that when we go in there
[49:32] and we get the ground prepared and ready
[49:36] for corn or for wheat
[49:39] we got to go below the two the two foot
[49:42] mark
[49:44] and what it is this machine goes down
[49:46] and it digs it up and as it digs it up
[49:48] it curls it and brings everything that's
[49:51] on the very top and puts it on the
[49:53] bottom
[49:55] so that in the winter time it freezes it
[49:58] it kills all the seed that was laying on
[50:01] top of that ground
[50:02] into the ground now so it would freeze
[50:05] it it would kill it totally dead that
[50:07] would not come back up
[50:09] and so then it when spring starts coming
[50:12] right before spring you get back out
[50:15] there and you have plow you plow it up
[50:17] and you get it get it to where you can
[50:19] have it where you be able to and the
[50:22] farmers out there a lot of them Farmers
[50:24] out there the big ranchers and things
[50:26] like that their Farmers also
[50:28] so what it is is you got one brother's
[50:31] the Rancher the other one's the farmer
[50:33] and so what they end up doing is the
[50:35] Rancher has this big old feedlot
[50:38] and he takes his little tractor out
[50:40] there little John Deere tractor and he
[50:43] pushes cow manure into big old piles
[50:47] and his brother brothers in there going
[50:49] oh this is going to fertilize my ground
[50:52] and he goes and he picks it up and he
[50:54] puts it on his on the ground that he
[50:57] just trying to prepare to put corn in
[51:00] there or weed in there or maybe he's
[51:02] changing a ground from from seven years
[51:05] of alfalfa now they're taking it from
[51:08] there because after so many years their
[51:11] soil has to have something else to build
[51:13] that soil up so that it would be perfect
[51:16] to grow in and so now they have all
[51:19] kinds of stuff today that they don't
[51:21] have to wait like they did in years
[51:23] before that they would have to leave
[51:25] that ground alone for a year or so that
[51:28] the nature that mother nature take care
[51:30] of it and then bring it through
[51:33] but now they've got all kinds of ways
[51:35] today that they can just keep on and
[51:37] keep on because they're putting stuff in
[51:39] it well in this cow manure it has all
[51:42] the vitamins that you they need to grow
[51:45] any kind of wheat any kind of corn or
[51:49] any kind of alfalfa or grass
[51:51] and so they go in there and they spread
[51:54] that out there
[51:56] but the old farmer
[51:59] is a farmer
[52:01] he has to use what he's got
[52:04] but he's not realizing that that same
[52:07] cow that did that that stuff in the
[52:10] catalog ate all those weeds all winter
[52:13] long
[52:15] and all those weeds had seeds in them
[52:18] and all that grass and all these things
[52:21] and when they go and they drop their
[52:23] droppings
[52:27] he's spreading out
[52:29] all those seeds on his ground his
[52:31] fertile ground
[52:35] I cut a lot of corn for silage
[52:38] man you would see corn 12 feet high in
[52:42] New Mexico
[52:45] corn corn that long
[52:47] juicy when I was a little boy
[52:51] but underneath about this high
[52:54] was tumbleweeds as far as you can see in
[52:57] underneath those
[52:59] that crop
[53:01] because a mother nature blows them in
[53:04] there
[53:05] those cows provided a whole bunch of
[53:07] them
[53:10] but brothers and sisters
[53:13] just imagine
[53:15] some of you right now got a little
[53:17] garden out here
[53:19] and if you're not out there daily you've
[53:21] got a bunch of weeds popping up in grass
[53:23] growing
[53:25] and if you let those things take over it
[53:27] will kill your plant it will suck all
[53:31] the moisture out of it
[53:33] that's why you see all these Cowboys
[53:35] cutting all these oh not oak trees but
[53:38] all these cedar trees out they're saying
[53:40] that one tree
[53:43] one tree a day
[53:46] drinks like
[53:48] hundreds and hundreds of gallons of
[53:50] water a day
[53:53] yeah and you wonder why in my front yard
[53:55] on the side yard around that tree that
[53:58] my wife thinks is so beautiful when she
[54:01] looks out that window washing dishes
[54:03] that I have to hit my head on because I
[54:05] gotta get way down here and it's pretty
[54:08] hard for this boy to bend over and get
[54:10] hit by that big old 48 inch mower I got
[54:13] that pulls me around like a like
[54:15] anything
[54:17] she loves it but underneath it there's
[54:19] no grass growing
[54:21] one little twig of this and that's there
[54:23] that's it everything else is dead
[54:26] because it's sucking all that water out
[54:28] of the ground
[54:31] so a real farmer or a real Rancher gets
[54:34] rid of them kinds of things even they
[54:36] look pretty they get rid of it there's a
[54:38] lot of
[54:39] beautiful weeds out there as beautiful
[54:43] flowers
[54:45] if you don't believe you come to my
[54:46] house I got a bunch of yellow little
[54:47] yellow flowers all over my yard
[54:51] they're beautiful
[54:53] but they'll take over your yard
[54:56] and so you have to make sure you
[54:58] get into your yard and take care of your
[55:01] yard
[55:03] but one thing about this that I saw here
[55:05] with this you got to put that that seed
[55:08] in the ground in Fertile ground
[55:10] and it has to die as brother Wendell is
[55:13] saying it very very good the other night
[55:15] it has to die but it can only just die
[55:18] but it has to rot
[55:20] prophet of God said
[55:22] back in the 50s they couldn't figure
[55:25] they couldn't open that thing up stick
[55:27] it in the ground in the water it for
[55:28] about a week or so and then pull that
[55:30] thing up and find life there
[55:34] they can't find it but there's life in
[55:37] that seed
[55:39] when it is sitting there on your table
[55:41] and you're getting ready to plant it
[55:42] there's a life in there that's dormant
[55:44] it will produce if it's in the right
[55:47] kind of ground it will produce
[55:50] that's why in the mind of God he created
[55:53] now you can go in the scriptures and see
[55:56] the first chapter and second chapter
[55:59] Genesis
[56:01] it was made by the hands of God by
[56:04] spoken words speaking it he created
[56:07] heavens and earth he created life he
[56:10] created the animals he created the
[56:11] animals for the sea he created the sea
[56:13] he created everything
[56:16] he put seeds in the ground
[56:19] he was a a master farmer of building
[56:24] this this world for you and I this Eden
[56:27] that we're supposed to be going back to
[56:28] that Eden That was supposed to be
[56:30] perfect
[56:31] was perfect
[56:33] Adam walked and breathed in perfection
[56:37] he lived and breathed as a Son of God he
[56:42] was able to say tree I want you to move
[56:44] from here and move over here I don't
[56:46] want you lying here I want you in the
[56:48] other Kingdom over here
[56:50] they would listen to him
[56:52] he was a me a a small man but he had
[56:57] power of God living in him
[57:00] he had Heaven and Earth wrapped around
[57:03] him he was able to be a god upon the
[57:06] Earth
[57:08] and those two chapters
[57:12] was perfect
[57:14] in chapter three
[57:16] that's when
[57:18] sin come along
[57:23] that Beast that was standing there
[57:26] was in the first two chapters
[57:30] and God said it was good
[57:32] but he created that Beast for a purpose
[57:36] and Satan took that beast and perverted
[57:40] something that was good
[57:42] so that God
[57:45] could be a redeemer
[57:48] God used that vessel
[57:52] for a purpose as just as brother Wendell
[57:55] said that he used
[57:57] Pharaoh for his purpose to show his
[58:00] power
[58:02] that was the only way that Satan was
[58:05] able to come
[58:07] in the race of a human race
[58:10] brother random made it very clear that
[58:13] that that Beast was some kind of like an
[58:16] ape but he was more like a man but he
[58:18] was able to transfer back and forth
[58:23] with a woman
[58:27] and that's why we had these two seeds
[58:30] this we have today
[58:32] because of one
[58:34] vessel was able to be used
[58:37] and God planted seeds
[58:40] Satan planted seeds and they
[58:44] came up
[58:46] he planted more seeds he planted more
[58:48] seeds they came up and they harvest he
[58:51] planted these seeds and he planted seeds
[58:53] and they kept coming up and came up
[58:57] before long
[58:59] those two started mingling together
[59:02] made Giants in the world
[59:04] made all kinds of sin and Corruption
[59:08] I believe Seth was a man of God I
[59:12] believe he knew who he was he knew who
[59:15] his father was and he knew who his God
[59:17] was
[59:17] and I believe he stood on the Promises
[59:20] of God that what his daddy taught him
[59:22] sitting there lit to ear by the fire
[59:25] every evening what God did for them in
[59:27] the Garden of Eden I believe he was
[59:30] taught right I believe that he was
[59:31] living right
[59:33] but his grandchildren and grandchildren
[59:36] and grandchildren
[59:38] started mingling
[59:42] Sciences has taken corn today and you
[59:45] can't you cannot find real corn
[59:49] you can't go in there and take that corn
[59:52] that you buy today and you plant it
[59:55] and harvest it and say I'm going to keep
[59:57] this bag and I'm going to replant it
[1:00:00] it cannot produce nothing
[1:00:02] it's dead
[1:00:04] only thing you can produce
[1:00:07] is cornmeal
[1:00:09] that's it because there's no life in it
[1:00:14] that's why
[1:00:16] Church of God that them two seeds
[1:00:20] you can look at man here and you can
[1:00:22] look a man here you don't see nothing
[1:00:24] different they're both men
[1:00:26] but one has the Seed of Abraham and the
[1:00:28] other one has the seed of Satan is
[1:00:30] because they started mingling and when
[1:00:33] they started meedling with each other
[1:00:36] caused more damage to the mind
[1:00:40] because now they have the mind of Cain
[1:00:42] and they have a mind of be religious
[1:00:46] but then you have the seed of God in a
[1:00:49] person that stays away from the sins of
[1:00:52] the world because their father is of the
[1:00:55] Heavenly Realm
[1:00:58] there's a difference
[1:01:00] this mind only works
[1:01:02] is it what gets fed right here
[1:01:05] this mind can deceive you just like it
[1:01:08] did Eve
[1:01:12] but we have to make sure that you and I
[1:01:14] are living and breathing Bible
[1:01:19] because if we're reading our Bible every
[1:01:21] day we're listening to tapes
[1:01:26] not only have a quote against the devil
[1:01:28] now you'll have scripture against the
[1:01:31] devil right
[1:01:34] you have to take both of them and eat
[1:01:37] the book
[1:01:38] and when you eat the book
[1:01:40] you gotta digest it
[1:01:43] you've got to place it down into your
[1:01:45] heart and let your heart use that for
[1:01:48] strength
[1:01:50] the reason why we let the devil come in
[1:01:53] and fight us and fight us and beat us
[1:01:56] and everything else is because brother
[1:01:58] William is not in the book
[1:02:01] but when I'm in the book
[1:02:04] my wife is a lot happier
[1:02:07] I'm not a grump I'm doing other things
[1:02:10] that I should be doing
[1:02:13] I have more faith
[1:02:16] and all things are a little bit
[1:02:18] different
[1:02:19] through my trials
[1:02:20] I'm not sitting there going oh me
[1:02:22] brother Joe
[1:02:23] no I'm saying all right devil you're
[1:02:26] fighting me must be good something's
[1:02:28] good coming up
[1:02:29] and I fight you and I fight feel like
[1:02:32] I'm going to go under but my nose is
[1:02:34] still up above the water and then one
[1:02:37] shiny day there's a God that comes down
[1:02:40] and says no more Satan here he comes and
[1:02:43] he pulls me out of that water and I cut
[1:02:45] that devil's head off why because I'm
[1:02:48] Son of God
[1:02:50] he lets me learn how to swim he teaches
[1:02:52] me how to fight he teaches me how to
[1:02:55] talk he teaches me how to love
[1:02:59] because God
[1:03:01] cultivated
[1:03:04] his thoughts
[1:03:06] when he spoke him into existence and he
[1:03:09] planted the Earth for an Eden for his
[1:03:12] children because he loved him he wanted
[1:03:15] them to have something special to live
[1:03:18] on and to grow on and to be just like
[1:03:22] his dad their daddy a god a miniature
[1:03:26] God to the Earth
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:32] amen God is good church
[1:03:35] when we can recognize
[1:03:37] what our brother's been preaching on
[1:03:40] and not only have it in had knowledge
[1:03:42] but go home and get into the scriptures
[1:03:45] and find out
[1:03:47] for 20 years I've been trying to find
[1:03:50] this one quote
[1:03:52] that I can find and say okay I got it
[1:03:55] I've Heard lots of people say
[1:03:58] that the tree of life and the tree of
[1:04:02] Good Good and Evil
[1:04:04] one was Jesus and one was Satan for some
[1:04:08] reason I was Satan I could never find it
[1:04:10] for some reason but today the day this
[1:04:13] afternoon before I showed up God showed
[1:04:15] it to me
[1:04:16] for 20 years I had I knew Christ
[1:04:20] was way back then too
[1:04:22] but Jesus came through a birth
[1:04:25] but something inside of me just believed
[1:04:28] that that was something more there I
[1:04:30] believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
[1:04:33] God but I believe a God that was inside
[1:04:35] of him was God Almighty when he was
[1:04:37] standing there said peace be still
[1:04:41] Lazarus come forth I believe there was
[1:04:44] something in that body there was more
[1:04:46] than just the Sun
[1:04:48] I believe that God spoke through him all
[1:04:51] the healing come from God the Bible says
[1:04:53] in the Old Testament
[1:04:55] all the healings come from God
[1:04:58] amen
[1:05:01] you and I can lay hands on the sick but
[1:05:04] who heals them
[1:05:05] God
[1:05:07] but God takes your faith and he goes on
[1:05:10] action with it
[1:05:11] Hallelujah that's why a man can stand up
[1:05:14] here and people can be walking by and
[1:05:16] not say a word and just lay hands
[1:05:18] because he already knows that God's
[1:05:20] going to heal him
[1:05:23] and God recognizes that faith for that
[1:05:26] person
[1:05:27] and now when that person comes through
[1:05:29] maybe has diabetes and walks through
[1:05:31] there
[1:05:33] healed why because it's the word
[1:05:37] God planted it in the Garden of Eden it
[1:05:41] was there for us
[1:05:42] as long as we're living on that life of
[1:05:45] God
[1:05:46] taken into his word
[1:05:49] he took care of them
[1:05:51] Hallelujah
[1:05:53] Matthew
[1:05:55] 13 37.
[1:05:59] he answered and said unto them
[1:06:01] he that soweth good seed is the son of
[1:06:04] man
[1:06:05] the field is the world
[1:06:08] though good seed are the children of the
[1:06:11] Kingdom
[1:06:12] but the tares are the children of the
[1:06:15] wicked one the enemy that stowed them
[1:06:18] is the devil
[1:06:21] the hardest is the end of the world
[1:06:24] and the Reapers
[1:06:26] are the Angels
[1:06:28] we just heard that the other night
[1:06:29] didn't we
[1:06:32] but I wanted to take something God gave
[1:06:34] this to me right here this this one
[1:06:36] these scriptures
[1:06:39] that was God putting his seeds in there
[1:06:42] from his mind
[1:06:45] and then Here Comes Satan
[1:06:47] throwing his seats out there
[1:06:51] and brother ham says this he says and
[1:06:53] the gospel isn't word only
[1:06:57] through Power and the manifestation of
[1:06:59] the Holy Spirit which was produced the
[1:07:02] signs of Mark 16 when he said go into
[1:07:05] all the world preach the gospel to Every
[1:07:08] Creature these signs shall follow them
[1:07:10] the word isn't it's
[1:07:13] the word itself is dead until it becomes
[1:07:18] into an action
[1:07:19] and produces life
[1:07:24] oh saints of God
[1:07:26] we've got a lot of people walking dead
[1:07:28] in the in our churches
[1:07:31] they don't know nothing
[1:07:34] they're sitting there
[1:07:36] relying on Pastor window to tell him
[1:07:39] everything
[1:07:41] and then another person comes by and
[1:07:43] maybe says something just a little
[1:07:44] different
[1:07:45] but but brother Wendell said this but he
[1:07:48] says the Bible says this and they get
[1:07:50] confused
[1:07:52] or because they just gone off their mind
[1:07:55] and their mind is telling them well you
[1:07:57] know it's all right as he was saying
[1:07:59] this morning it's all right to drink a
[1:08:01] little and it's all right to smoke a
[1:08:03] little
[1:08:05] it's not
[1:08:08] brother Brown made it very clear that
[1:08:10] those things are just attributes of
[1:08:12] unbelief
[1:08:13] if you believe you wouldn't do those
[1:08:16] things I wouldn't do those things if I
[1:08:19] believe
[1:08:23] we've got to stick with what the word of
[1:08:25] God has brought us to do
[1:08:29] we've got to cultivate our hearts we've
[1:08:31] got to we've got to clean it out every
[1:08:34] day as we're growing Christians we've
[1:08:36] got to go out there I guarantee you
[1:08:38] brother Merle's out there and he's
[1:08:40] pulling weeds and I guarantee he starts
[1:08:43] about to this corner before he gets out
[1:08:45] there and he's probably pulling weeds on
[1:08:46] the way out there
[1:08:49] my wife gets out of the car as soon as
[1:08:52] she looks down I mean this happened to
[1:08:54] us the other day and I couldn't believe
[1:08:55] it
[1:08:56] she got out of the car
[1:08:57] a screw about that big
[1:09:00] we go in we can we get we get out our
[1:09:03] grass
[1:09:05] we go to the store she gets out
[1:09:08] she picks up a nail
[1:09:10] she just she's a magnet
[1:09:13] brother Merle is a weed killer
[1:09:17] he's always pulling weeds
[1:09:19] I go around the corner to go to my house
[1:09:21] he's at he's at the neighbor's house
[1:09:23] pulling weeds
[1:09:27] we've got to take care of what we've got
[1:09:29] we've got to cultivate
[1:09:32] you can't just pull a weed they got them
[1:09:35] little teeny machine a little uh little
[1:09:37] uh thing it goes like this and when you
[1:09:40] roll it it teals the ground up do you
[1:09:42] know what that does
[1:09:44] it tills the ground up so when you water
[1:09:46] it the water goes in and separates into
[1:09:48] your to your root system
[1:09:51] and it gets the water down there faster
[1:09:53] it makes mixtures all the water gets
[1:09:55] there we want the word all to come into
[1:09:58] our hearts so if we can cultivate this
[1:10:01] ground and get it softened up so when
[1:10:03] the word starts coming what is it going
[1:10:05] to do when the water of the word comes
[1:10:07] it's going to soak down into that seed
[1:10:10] and that seed that was predestinated
[1:10:12] before the foundations of the world it's
[1:10:14] going to produce exactly the word
[1:10:19] but brother Brian brother window brother
[1:10:21] Brandon myself cannot cultivate your
[1:10:24] mind we can throw thoughts out there we
[1:10:26] can give you word out there but you've
[1:10:28] got to take that word and you've got to
[1:10:30] apply it to your life and you've got to
[1:10:32] cultivate it so that it goes down into
[1:10:34] the side of your body and you say I am a
[1:10:37] Christian not because somebody says it
[1:10:40] because you have an experience of the
[1:10:43] Holy Spirit that's drawing you closer to
[1:10:46] him
[1:10:47] Hallelujah
[1:10:49] praise be to God
[1:10:53] except a corn of wheat
[1:10:56] Falls in that ground it abides alone
[1:10:59] and when
[1:11:01] the word is brought into a heart of
[1:11:04] faith that makes that very promise in
[1:11:08] the Bible living again
[1:11:11] see
[1:11:13] it's got to live
[1:11:16] it's
[1:11:18] germanized word oh I like that
[1:11:21] germanized word and it must live if it's
[1:11:26] received in the right place under the
[1:11:29] right condition
[1:11:31] every seed will live again
[1:11:35] if it's put under the right condition
[1:11:41] you want to be greater Christians you
[1:11:44] want to have signs and wonders following
[1:11:46] you
[1:11:47] and I'm not talking about preachers I'm
[1:11:48] talking about you individuals
[1:11:52] cultivate
[1:11:54] cultivate
[1:11:55] get all them weeds out of your head get
[1:11:58] all the unbelief out so the only thing
[1:12:00] that's in your mind
[1:12:03] you turn that Battlefield in a big old
[1:12:05] field
[1:12:07] so you can grow
[1:12:08] and grow in the presence of God
[1:12:12] you just work it and you work it every
[1:12:14] day how do you do that brother William

[1:14:58] Hallelujah
[1:14:59] look
[1:15:01] it comes to a place friend
[1:15:04] when the word world is so awful it's
[1:15:08] going to make you prove every inch of
[1:15:12] ground you stand on Satan's going to do
[1:15:15] it and it's coming to a time where
[1:15:19] impersonators and Cardinal thinking is
[1:15:23] going to be circling from the real true
[1:15:27] Body of Christ
[1:15:28] oh my
[1:15:30] oh my God
[1:15:34] that's why it's so important to stick
[1:15:35] with the word
[1:15:37] because if you're not sticking with the
[1:15:40] word any kind of winds of Doctrine comes
[1:15:42] you're going to follow it oh he said
[1:15:44] brother Brandon what brother Amber must
[1:15:45] said it but if you're reading the word
[1:15:48] and you're in the book your antennas
[1:15:50] will go up and say oh wait a minute
[1:15:53] prophet of God said this brother William
[1:15:57] I'm sorry brother William I can't
[1:15:59] believe the two Soul Doctrine sorry
[1:16:01] brother William I don't believe it
[1:16:06] I don't believe in those things because
[1:16:07] it doesn't line up with scripture
[1:16:12] it wasn't my fault
[1:16:16] when I was born in sin speaking lies but
[1:16:20] it is my fault if I stay in that
[1:16:22] condition
[1:16:25] I came to this world
[1:16:28] I didn't ask to come to this world
[1:16:31] but I came and now I have a decision
[1:16:34] that I have to make am I going to serve
[1:16:37] the Living God or am I going to live in
[1:16:39] this flesh and if I live in this flesh
[1:16:41] I'm going to die and rot and go to a hot
[1:16:44] house
[1:16:45] or I can serve a God here and sacrifice
[1:16:49] the things of the world and go to a
[1:16:51] Heavenly place called Eden and that Eden
[1:16:54] is a peace and a love when my God will
[1:16:57] come down in the evening time and
[1:16:59] fellowship with me and see me in love
[1:17:02] means watch and I can see the animals
[1:17:04] why do the animals that I would love
[1:17:05] just to touch I will be able to touch
[1:17:07] them
[1:17:09] and I won't have a heart attack when my
[1:17:11] wife walks up to a moose 20 feet and
[1:17:14] wants to take pictures
[1:17:16] hmm
[1:17:19] but I want that love
[1:17:21] I want the power of God living in me I
[1:17:24] want the signs and wonders to follow me
[1:17:26] not because I'm a preacher I want to be
[1:17:29] able to let people see that's a man of
[1:17:32] God he's not a hypocrite
[1:17:35] oh he doesn't smile very much
[1:17:40] but you get around him a little while he
[1:17:42] starts getting goofy and he's a Paul a
[1:17:45] big ball of fun
[1:17:47] but I don't want somebody to look at me
[1:17:49] and say
[1:17:50] that's a hypocrite
[1:17:52] he says that he's a Christian
[1:17:56] he's up there preaching the gospel
[1:17:59] and he's living in sin he's doing this
[1:18:01] he's doing that I don't want that behind
[1:18:03] me I want my my body cultivated so that
[1:18:07] God can come and water
[1:18:11] that I can have overcoming power of this
[1:18:14] flesh myself
[1:18:16] because my worst enemy is this right
[1:18:18] here
[1:18:19] These Eyes cause me in lots of problems
[1:18:23] this tongue causes lots of problems
[1:18:26] but if I can keep my eyes and keep my
[1:18:29] tongue in the word of God
[1:18:31] I will use my tongue of praising him
[1:18:33] I'll use my eyes to see the word of God
[1:18:36] that I can put down into my heart that I
[1:18:39] can be an overcomer of the things of the
[1:18:41] world
[1:18:42] Hallelujah
[1:18:46] I want to be a
[1:18:48] a moving Bible brother I want the Bible
[1:18:52] to live in me again Hallelujah
[1:18:58] I was dead one day but now I was found

[1:22:13] priests
[1:22:15] who walk in there and those Chimes not
[1:22:17] working right he was a dead man
[1:22:20] if my life ain't according to the word
[1:22:22] of God that's for this day I'm a dead
[1:22:24] man
[1:22:26] I don't care how many quotes I quote how
[1:22:28] much scriptures I quote if I'm not
[1:22:31] walking and according of the word of God
[1:22:33] and those bills are not ringing right
[1:22:35] I'm a dead man
[1:22:39] how can I say I love you if I don't love
[1:22:42] you
[1:22:43] don't speak nothing if you can't say the
[1:22:45] truth
[1:22:46] you'd be better off saying I don't like
[1:22:48] you brother Joe
[1:22:49] and then guess what gotta fix it
[1:22:52] sometimes we have to speak things
[1:22:54] so that God can understand grab a hotel
[1:22:56] and say wait a minute
[1:22:58] let's work this out
[1:23:02] what is it
[1:23:03] we're a cultina fading our heart and our
[1:23:06] mind so the word the fullness of the
[1:23:09] word can come and drop right here and
[1:23:13] produce Jesus Christ
[1:23:15] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:23:21] oh Hallelujah
[1:23:23] what's something's real something's real
[1:23:26] there's hunger and thirst to find the
[1:23:29] real thing
[1:23:31] they don't want theology
[1:23:34] they don't want some intellect speech
[1:23:38] they want something that gives them an
[1:23:42] insurance something that makes the Bible
[1:23:45] live again
[1:23:48] living in where in me in you you want
[1:23:52] God to live in you you want to be a son
[1:23:55] or a daughter of God that you can stand
[1:23:58] there and say Satan you're a liar
[1:24:03] thank you
[1:24:06] I had this one guy that used to irritate
[1:24:09] me to knowing I had to work with him
[1:24:10] every single day
[1:24:13] and he always teased me
[1:24:16] finally one day I'm just a working
[1:24:17] instead of hollering back at him
[1:24:19] spitting at him things I just ignored
[1:24:22] him
[1:24:24] the whole day brother Kobe I did say a
[1:24:27] word to him
[1:24:28] he would tell you William you need to do
[1:24:29] this
[1:24:30] I stopped and I go do it and I come back
[1:24:32] and I've been finishing
[1:24:34] the end of the day he goes William
[1:24:35] what's wrong with you nothing
[1:24:38] he goes what have I done to you why are
[1:24:40] you mad at me
[1:24:42] I said I ain't mad at you
[1:24:46] and I went home
[1:24:47] he went to the boss that says this guy
[1:24:48] doesn't like me no more
[1:24:50] and the boss looks at him says
[1:24:52] wonder why
[1:24:54] you keep running your mouth all the time
[1:24:56] to him he's tired of it so he's ignoring
[1:24:58] you so maybe you'll flee
[1:25:04] ended up being my buddy
[1:25:07] instead of fighting back and forth
[1:25:10] I loved him
[1:25:12] By ignoring him for just a little while
[1:25:14] so he would leave me alone
[1:25:16] and that leave alone caused him
[1:25:21] he wanted to be my buddy
[1:25:23] and now we're buddies to this day
[1:25:28] but it's what you're going to do on the
[1:25:31] circumstances that's in your life today
[1:25:36] we can be puffed up and I can tease
[1:25:39] brother Kobe and he can get mad at me
[1:25:42] beat me up very easily
[1:25:45] but what would that do to him
[1:25:47] cause him
[1:25:49] to be wrong
[1:25:52] I don't want to be wrong
[1:25:54] I want the flow of God coming out of me
[1:25:57] and shine is so bright
[1:26:00] when that sun comes from the East and it
[1:26:03] hits that ground brother Mike I want the
[1:26:06] seed that said me to shine the
[1:26:09] beautifulest flower that I got
[1:26:13] why
[1:26:17] Prophet God said watch out
[1:26:20] he said friends watch out this world is
[1:26:23] going to get awful
[1:26:24] it's going to be sick
[1:26:27] it's going to be so so dark
[1:26:32] you're going to have to have his light
[1:26:34] to be able to get through this world
[1:26:38] we're going to have a lot of fight
[1:26:41] but we've got to be strengthened by God
[1:26:43] to go through those fights
[1:26:45] Hallelujah
[1:26:50] oh my
[1:26:54] God that's the truth saint
[1:26:57] brother Brown was talking here and I
[1:27:00] already said it a little bit but he
[1:27:01] talked about this guy and this guy Saint
[1:27:04] Thomas went out and brought the gospel
[1:27:07] to India
[1:27:09] but didn't they didn't do
[1:27:11] they turn into intellectual theology
[1:27:16] there is Lays he said and this guy was
[1:27:20] talking and he says he's talking to
[1:27:22] brother Brown and I want to just re redo
[1:27:24] this because I didn't really say it like
[1:27:26] brother random really said this he says
[1:27:28] he goes he said we here over
[1:27:32] here in India that God was giving you a
[1:27:35] gift to make this Bible live again
[1:27:39] that's what we're interested in to make
[1:27:43] the Bible live again
[1:27:47] every true pastor
[1:27:49] who wants the Bible to live in every
[1:27:52] human that comes into church
[1:27:55] he might get a little rough he might get
[1:27:57] a little soft and he might cry a little
[1:28:00] but brothers and sisters if we can just
[1:28:01] take the words that he says
[1:28:04] and take them home
[1:28:07] and digest it slowly if you have to
[1:28:10] but digest it
[1:28:14] brother Brown loved beans and and uh
[1:28:18] onions
[1:28:19] but the belly didn't like it
[1:28:22] but he knew that God healed him
[1:28:24] and he would spin it up and hit suck it
[1:28:27] right back down until that Faith kicked
[1:28:29] in
[1:28:30] sometimes we got to eat the word that
[1:28:32] comes across this pulpit
[1:28:34] and we got to eat it and just keep it in
[1:28:36] keep it in because it's the best thing
[1:28:37] for us it might be a fertilizer it might
[1:28:41] be a
[1:28:42] when back home
[1:28:44] after we plant the ground
[1:28:47] and it's wheat we got wheat out there
[1:28:49] and it's all nice and smooth and it's
[1:28:50] pretty looks like like grass when it
[1:28:52] starts growing it grows and it grows and
[1:28:55] it grows
[1:28:56] well you can't go out there in a tractor
[1:28:58] and just drive through it because you
[1:28:59] kill
[1:29:00] your Harvest
[1:29:02] so you hire this guy in this plane and
[1:29:04] this plane got these big old sprinklers
[1:29:06] with a big old tank on the back of his
[1:29:08] his little teeny uh plane called a crop
[1:29:12] duster
[1:29:14] and he flies down there and you think
[1:29:16] this guy's gonna hit the ground and he's
[1:29:18] about two feet and you all of a sudden
[1:29:20] you see this white puffy steamy stuff
[1:29:24] just boiling up behind you
[1:29:26] anything how in the world did that
[1:29:28] little motor do that it's not the motor
[1:29:31] it's the pesticide
[1:29:33] the fertilizer that's in that tank
[1:29:35] that's being spread upon that
[1:29:38] on that because wheat you do not want no
[1:29:42] weeds you don't want no bugs to get into
[1:29:45] your wheat
[1:29:47] and so they spray this thing once a
[1:29:49] month they keep it clean they keep it
[1:29:52] fertilized
[1:29:53] and sometimes the things that brother
[1:29:55] Wendell preaches across the pulpit it's
[1:29:58] fertilizer sometimes it's a pesticide
[1:30:01] that wants to kill that root
[1:30:04] I was telling a man this weekend I said
[1:30:06] you the things that you got from that
[1:30:08] preacher that hurts you
[1:30:10] is those words that that man said to you
[1:30:13] for years after years and you believed
[1:30:15] it now they're growing and they're
[1:30:17] growing but now you're trying to get rid
[1:30:19] of them but if you grab a hotel and just
[1:30:21] pull it
[1:30:22] it'll break off
[1:30:23] but I said if you get the Holy Ghost and
[1:30:26] you feed and use that fertilizer and use
[1:30:30] the pesticide Holy Ghost and bring it
[1:30:33] down into your heart it will kill the
[1:30:36] roots
[1:30:37] and the body will Decay those roots into
[1:30:41] nothing
[1:30:44] it takes God
[1:30:46] to clean it out
[1:30:48] takes the word of God it takes a real
[1:30:52] farmer a real man of God that is your
[1:30:56] Shepherd
[1:30:58] to help root out some of these things
[1:31:02] and what does it do
[1:31:03] it makes you free
[1:31:05] because now you're not only you're
[1:31:07] working on you you got a brother that
[1:31:10] loves you and come over so let me help
[1:31:12] you with your garden today you come on
[1:31:14] Sunday to
[1:31:15] I want to help you out a little bit
[1:31:18] we have to help each other out
[1:31:21] that's why we've got to love our enemies
[1:31:23] we've got to love us one another to a
[1:31:26] place that the word of God can flow
[1:31:28] Among Us
[1:31:31] I was sitting there
[1:31:33] fellowshipping with brother Samuel and
[1:31:36] and another black brother and his name
[1:31:38] was uh Moses and I can't remember the
[1:31:41] little skinny guy that played the guitar
[1:31:42] couldn't play that guitar good but he
[1:31:44] was setting them and we were sitting
[1:31:47] there and then brother Tim the preacher
[1:31:49] that preached first he came come down
[1:31:50] and we were sitting there talking
[1:31:53] and all of a sudden oh brother Tim was
[1:31:56] just bawling
[1:31:58] and we were just talking about the Lord
[1:32:01] just tears running and and brother Sammy
[1:32:03] goes is it everything okay here he goes
[1:32:08] to this Fellowship
[1:32:10] I need this Fellowship I don't have
[1:32:13] Fellowship like this

[1:32:19] goes this is what's Lifting me up this
[1:32:21] is giving me a drink of water you guys
[1:32:23] are giving me a drink of water
[1:32:26] how a sudden a few minutes later he
[1:32:28] starts speaking I start crying I'm
[1:32:30] thinking man this is great we were there
[1:32:33] for two hours just just back and forth
[1:32:36] talking about God and talking about our
[1:32:38] experience in the Lord and seeing the
[1:32:40] lift up and the lift up in that little
[1:32:43] time that we was there something
[1:32:46] happened
[1:32:47] something good happened
[1:32:51] oh I love the fellowship around the word
[1:32:54] of God
[1:32:57] because why
[1:32:59] he comes down you start talking about
[1:33:01] him
[1:33:03] that rain falls and oh it's so sweet the
[1:33:07] smell when the rain comes through and
[1:33:09] you smell the
[1:33:11] that odor that it brings across cleans
[1:33:14] the air cleans everything up makes the
[1:33:17] trees look pretty makes the cars look
[1:33:19] good makes the house look good what is
[1:33:21] it it's the rain Mother Nature coming
[1:33:25] down
[1:33:26] and breathing us a little moisture a
[1:33:29] little blessing here
[1:33:31] the ranchers here was all put out they
[1:33:34] were working on their their all their
[1:33:36] pumps getting them ready to go because
[1:33:38] they thought they're going to have a dry
[1:33:39] and then Here Comes god with rain and
[1:33:42] all the ponds are filled up again what
[1:33:44] is it the mercies of God
[1:33:47] God is good to his people God is good to
[1:33:50] you and I why because he loves you and
[1:33:52] me Hallelujah now
[1:33:56] if this God who made the Bible
[1:34:00] who wrote the Bible
[1:34:02] you believe God inspired
[1:34:05] the Bible is inspired God's word
[1:34:08] you believe it
[1:34:09] do you believe it with with all your
[1:34:13] heart all right he says it's God's
[1:34:16] inspired word then if it's God's
[1:34:18] inspired word then if inspiration of God
[1:34:22] is here with us to make this word live
[1:34:25] to prove what
[1:34:29] we're here surely you can receive him
[1:34:32] isn't that right Romans 8 says this he
[1:34:35] says Romans 8 and 6 says
[1:34:37] for for to be Cardinal minding his death
[1:34:41] but to be spiritual minded is life and
[1:34:45] peace because the carnal mind is an
[1:34:48] enemy against God for it is not subject
[1:34:52] to the law or of God neither indeed can
[1:34:55] be so then they that are in the flesh
[1:34:59] cannot please God but
[1:35:02] ER not in the flesh but in the spirit if
[1:35:07] so be that the spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:35:10] you now if any man have not the spirit
[1:35:14] of Christ he is none of his
[1:35:17] and if Christ be in you
[1:35:19] the body is dead because of sin but the
[1:35:23] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:35:27] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:35:31] Jesus from the dead
[1:35:34] dwells in you he that raised up Christ
[1:35:38] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[1:35:42] moral bodies by the spirit that dwelleth
[1:35:45] in you
[1:35:47] what is it
[1:35:49] when you're cultivating you're
[1:35:51] cultivating your heart you're called
[1:35:53] royalty and you're reading the word and
[1:35:54] you're reading the word and then all of
[1:35:55] a sudden something quickens you
[1:35:58] the Bible lives what is it I'm a son I'm
[1:36:02] a daughter of God
[1:36:04] oh and predestination comes and you
[1:36:06] understand it oh the Bible lives what is
[1:36:10] it God living in a vessel again he lived
[1:36:13] in Jesus Christ one day but he died and
[1:36:16] Rose and went to heaven that body the
[1:36:18] Corporal body but God Spirit come down
[1:36:22] to living man so the Bible can live
[1:36:25] again
[1:36:26] Hallelujah I want you to know church God
[1:36:29] lives in his people and if you are his
[1:36:32] people we're going to act like him we're
[1:36:34] going to talk like him we're going to
[1:36:36] breathe like him and we are going to say
[1:36:39] Sin is Sin but spiritual Things Are
[1:36:42] Spiritual things we're not going to be
[1:36:44] Cardinal we're going to be spiritual
[1:36:46] we're going to live for him because he
[1:36:49] quickened this body
[1:36:50] he's the one that made this body live
[1:36:53] he's the one that had created you before
[1:36:56] the foundations of the world that that
[1:36:58] feeling lay inside of you one day was
[1:37:01] dormant but now it lives
[1:37:03] because it rotted and it died
[1:37:08] and if you're a follower that comes back
[1:37:11] in the spring
[1:37:12] you might have to die out a little while
[1:37:15] in the wintertime
[1:37:17] but little Miss Lily you're gonna come
[1:37:20] through again and you're going to

[1:44:58] or all malnourished and diseased
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:05] I wanna
[1:45:07] I wanna take every advantage that God
[1:45:11] has put in my life to grow
[1:45:14] to build muscle with
[1:45:17] because brother William said we're not
[1:45:20] none of us none of us are victims
[1:45:23] absolutely not victims
[1:45:27] the situations that God allows
[1:45:30] in our lives
[1:45:32] and God's put those things in our lives
[1:45:34] to grow with to grow by
[1:45:38] to mature in
[1:45:40] but the problem is many a times we're
[1:45:43] not feeding on that word we're not
[1:45:45] taking that word and really applying it
[1:45:48] and therefore amen
[1:45:51] the the the weight that that you should
[1:45:55] be building muscle is tearing muscle up
[1:45:58] amen you're wise because if you're going
[1:46:01] to be if you're going to be
[1:46:03] lifting weights amen you're going to
[1:46:06] have to have a special diet you can't be
[1:46:08] eating just cheeseburgers all the time
[1:46:10] you're going to have to have a lot of
[1:46:11] protein
[1:46:12] you got to be able to build those
[1:46:14] muscles and strengthen those muscles
[1:46:16] because it's tearing muscles up
[1:46:19] and it's got to have something to
[1:46:20] replenish them back and the situations
[1:46:23] in our lives that come the reason why it
[1:46:26] tears the church down a man tears the
[1:46:29] individual down is because we're not
[1:46:32] feeding on those other things that God
[1:46:35] has ordained to bring us up
[1:46:38] amen so we don't want to have torn
[1:46:41] muscles we want to be big old muscled up
[1:46:44] people amen
[1:46:46] Scott's going to give us the task God's
[1:46:48] going to send us the trials he's going
[1:46:49] to give these things to us and he's
[1:46:52] given us he's given us the regiment Amen
[1:46:55] to overcome by he's given us the word to
[1:46:58] overcome by amen he sent us a prophet he
[1:47:02] said eat this amen he this no don't eat
[1:47:05] the you carry and eat this this here
[1:47:07] this Ariel's strengthen you and make you
[1:47:10] who you are what you are what I want you
[1:47:12] to be amen everybody believes that we
[1:47:15] need to be so
[1:47:18] healthy spiritually amen that the old
[1:47:21] hatred bug just can't just can't do
[1:47:24] nothing to us
[1:47:25] the old malice bug just can't do nothing
[1:47:28] to us
[1:47:29] [Applause]
[1:47:31] hurt feelings just can oh yeah they'll
[1:47:34] come to every one of us because we are
[1:47:36] human
[1:47:36] amen but you see when it comes now

[1:47:42] that's got all of the diseased apples
[1:47:44] and the worm he says it shows that
[1:47:47] there's something wrong with the tree
[1:47:48] it's not able to push off the insects

[1:47:54] healthy tree this is a restored tree

[1:49:18] and
[1:49:19] um

[1:49:46] situations that seemed like I just I
[1:49:49] thought I was going to die
