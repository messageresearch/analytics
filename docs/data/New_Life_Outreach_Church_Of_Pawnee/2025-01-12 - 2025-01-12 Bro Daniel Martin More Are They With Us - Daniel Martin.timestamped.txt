[32:04] Rapture scared to believe God cuz what
[32:07] if it won't happen you know and that's
[32:09] what Satan is trying to put in the
[32:11] church today and and that's what he's
[32:14] doing he's causing a fear to get us to
[32:16] doubt God's word Amen brother brandham
[32:19] says the worst thing the devil can put
[32:22] on you is fear amen and fear doesn't
[32:25] come from God Amen we all know that fear
[32:28] doesn't come from God 2 Timothy 1 and 7
[32:31] says for God hath not given us the
[32:34] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[32:37] and of a sound mind amen and 1 John 4:18
[32:40] says there is no fear in love but
[32:44] perfect love casteth out fear amen
[32:47] because fear hath torment he that fearth
[32:50] is not made perfect in love amen so fear
[32:52] doesn't come from God Amen brother
[32:55] brandham says love and faith are are the
[32:58] same thing amen love produces Faith amen
[33:02] and there are two uh fa uh uh faculties
[33:06] that that govern a human and one of them
[33:09] is Faith which brings results and the
[33:11] other is fear which has no value in it
[33:14] at all amen and Faith cometh by hearing
[33:18] the word of God Amen Faith cometh by
[33:21] believing the word of God we all know
[33:23] the saying you are what you eat and uh
[33:27] we can feel beat off the things of the
[33:28] world Amen we are like a sponge human

[33:34] up the things of the world or we can
[33:36] soak up the things of God Amen we can
[33:38] soak up in uhh in the politics we can
[33:41] soak up the entertainment we can numb
[33:43] our minds to the world uh to the word a
[33:46] and that if we're not careful we can let
[33:48] fear take over if we indulge in politics
[33:51] if we indulge in the things of the world
[33:53] we indulge in in entertainment and not
[33:56] the things of God then we leave the door
[33:58] open for Satan to come in with fear amen
[34:02] and we don't want fear to take over but
[34:04] if we can just forget about the politics
[34:07] if we can just let go we forget about
[34:09] the entertainment we forget uh about
[34:12] numbing our minds to the things of the
[34:14] world and if we can just soak up the
[34:17] things of God then we can have faith in
[34:19] the word that will bring the power of
[34:21] God in our midst tonight amen Faith
[34:25] cometh by hearing the word of God Amen
[34:28] not in your favorite audio book amen not

[41:09] myself but if we were go to back uh go
[41:12] back to the opening
[41:14] scripture we know that uh we find out
[41:17] there was a war between Syria and Israel
[41:20] yeah and every time the enemy would try
[41:22] to lay a trap for the armies of Israel
[41:26] God would reveal it to his Prophet amen
[41:30] Elijah amen and how many knows that the
[41:33] word of the Lord comes to a prophet only
[41:36] amen always he comes to a prophet always
[41:39] amen and I want you to catch this now

[41:44] anytime he tried to get to God's people
[41:47] amen the enemy was exposed any time he
[41:50] tried to get to God's people and the
[41:53] Bible says that the king of Syria was
[41:55] very troubled about this and and sought
[41:57] after Elijah amen and do in so in the
[42:01] cover of
[42:02] Darkness he sent a great host and
[42:06] surrounded the city amen he sent a great
[42:10] host and surrounded the city and it's
[42:12] the same thing today Satan has released
[42:15] all the host of Hell to surround you and
[42:19] to cause you to fear amen and this great
[42:23] Army it's in its horses it's in its
[42:25] chariots and it surrounded the city and
[42:29] the Bible says that Elijah's servant
[42:30] went out the next day and and that he
[42:33] seen the armies of Syria yeah and he
[42:36] cried out to Elijah he said
[42:39] master master what are we supposed to do
[42:42] yeah we're surrounded there's no way out
[42:45] what are we going to do now Elijah
[42:48] didn't fear he didn't so oh well man I
[42:51] should have kept my mouth shut oh man I
[42:54] I shouldn't have told israels that what
[42:56] what what what what the king of Syria
[42:58] was saying in his bed Chambers oh I
[43:00] should have just kept my mouth quiet no
[43:02] no he didn't say that at all he looked
[43:05] at his servant and he said fear not fear
[43:08] not oh my that's a powerful statement
[43:12] fear not and in the carnal eye it looked
[43:16] impossible amen he probably looked at
[43:18] Elijah and said man Elijah woo I think
[43:21] you slept a little too long I don't I
[43:24] think you need to go get your coffee
[43:25] before you come to and and look out here
[43:28] you know you ain't had a cup yet this
[43:29] morning and I think you're a little
[43:31] crazy but all Elijah said was fear not
[43:36] amen do you not see that great host
[43:38] before us do you not see the
[43:41] circumstance that's lying before you
[43:43] right now do you not see the trouble
[43:46] that we're in Elijah Elijah says just
[43:48] fear not fear not amen for they that be
[43:52] with us they that be with us are more
[43:56] than they that be with him oh my and as
[44:00] his servant says well you know Elijah I
[44:03] only see the two of us I don't know what
[44:05] you're talking about Elijah and Elijah
[44:08] said Lord I pray thee Open the Eyes of
[44:12] the young man that he may see and God
[44:15] opened his spiritual eyes and behold the
[44:19] mountain was full of horses and chariots
[44:22] I fire round about them amen and if we
[44:26] can apply that to our day Satan has
[44:29] Unleashed his Demons of fear and torment
[44:31] to surround you to put you in a bind but

[1:12:55] to an
[1:12:56] innumerable company host of

[1:13:14] faith fear closes the supernatural
[1:13:18] presence of God up from us when you let
[1:13:21] your spirit get troubled when you've got
[1:13:24] the vibration ations in your spirit that
[1:13:27] that that is creating that
[1:13:30] doubt that's the reason why I always say
[1:13:34] those vibrations are there deal with it
[1:13:37] if you've got something against your
[1:13:40] spouse or you're allowing something and
[1:13:42] that that vibration in your spirit it
[1:13:45] keeps the supernatural away deal with
[1:13:48] that forgive or talk it out whatever
[1:13:52] you've got to do or or you know Satan
[1:13:55] will get us get you all worried about
[1:13:58] you know about this you know your family
[1:14:01] or about the job or about something and
[1:14:04] and and and and he does it for a
[1:14:07] reason just to keep and before you know
[1:14:10] it that spirit is just just hovering
[1:14:13] over that
[1:14:16] home the prophet says right when the
[1:14:18] spirit of the Lord is fixing to do
[1:14:20] something in the church service he says
[1:14:22] those babies are really sensitive he'll
[1:14:24] hit one of those babies and get them to
[1:14:25] crying just to get just to get that that
[1:14:28] that part of the audience uh troubled to
[1:14:32] keep somebody from a
[1:14:34] blessing well if that can happen in the
[1:14:36] middle of a church
[1:14:38] service what about in your home as
[1:14:40] brother Daniel was saying you allow
[1:14:43] those things in your
[1:14:45] home but if you keep the heart pure and
[1:14:48] you keep that home a
[1:14:50] sanctuary and you say Lord let Faith
[1:14:53] live here
[1:14:55] well my goodness his presence will be
[1:14:58] right there with you he's right
[1:15:00] there how many of times he's right there
[1:15:03] with you right when you're when you're
[1:15:05] when you're battling it's just the devil
[1:15:07] of battling amen and sometimes it is a
[1:15:10] battle to keep your spirit right and
[1:15:13] when I say your spirit right you know I
[1:15:16] I I I just always call it that vibration
[1:15:18] I know when my spirit is troubled I know
[1:15:22] when the vibrations are there when I'm
[1:15:24] nervous
[1:15:25] when something is trying I know it's the
[1:15:28] devil that's making me nervous I know
[1:15:30] it's the devil trying to to to get me
[1:15:33] uptight in a certain
[1:15:35] situation Hallelujah well glory to
[1:15:38] God Amen the boys

[1:16:20] musicians everyone took off running from
[1:16:22] the
[1:16:23] front and um and just that pandemonium
[1:16:26] hit the place and and brother the
[1:16:30] brother Danny was there and he and he
[1:16:32] took me and just pushed me out and uh
[1:16:36] and so once I knew that I had the floor
[1:16:39] then I said everyone let's stop and the
[1:16:42] and by this time the woman was running
[1:16:43] over to us and and the the baby was just
[1:16:46] black just couldn't breathe and and um
[1:16:50] had was having a seizure or something
[1:16:52] there and and um and I said please

[1:16:59] fearful in these kind of
[1:17:01] times so I said only believe let's start
[1:17:04] singing so the musicians went back we
[1:17:07] started singing and as the congregation
[1:17:09] got their thoughts together then we took
[1:17:12] the baby and I said Satan you
[1:17:15] tried you tried to kill this child and
[1:17:19] you have tried to get our hearts off of
[1:17:22] the promise but I rebuke you now in the
[1:17:25] name of Jesus and then all of a sudden a
[1:17:28] a deep breath he came
[1:17:31] back and um was back in in his grandma's
[1:17:35] arms just looking back around
[1:17:37] again see
[1:17:40] Satan he wasn't just trying to kill the
[1:17:42] child but he was trying to keep the
[1:17:45] Deliverance for the child that was the
[1:17:48] best place to be is there with the
[1:17:51] Believers that believes in the
[1:17:53] Supernatural
[1:17:54] but Satan wanted to come and get all of
[1:17:57] our hearts including me as I say I'm
[1:18:00] mean I I Shak it I mean the way she
[1:18:02] screamed in the way I mean it was it it
[1:18:05] was not a time
[1:18:07] uh uh another it was another time at
[1:18:10] that same camp and a young man came up
[1:18:15] and since I've been here
[1:18:17] immediately fear took over because I
[1:18:20] knew the situation and I'm and I'm going
[1:18:23] oh oh now now my
[1:18:26] brother listen you can't do that you've
[1:18:30] got to ask your mother we don't want to
[1:18:31] be liable you've got to
[1:18:33] talk and then all of a sudden the spirit
[1:18:36] of the Lord was with me and the pastor
[1:18:39] was there too and and the spirit of the
[1:18:40] Lord just spoke to me and said I've
[1:18:44] touched that
[1:18:46] boy and I looked at him and at first
[1:18:50] doubt started to coming back in as if he
[1:18:52] started and I says young man man if you
[1:18:56] feel like God has touched you then don't
[1:18:59] you let that enemy because I'm here to
[1:19:01] tell you buddy when he went a few days
[1:19:03] without his he he' swallow his tongue
[1:19:07] and I want it would be violent that
[1:19:10] young man would just just that those
[1:19:13] seizures were so bad on him something
[1:19:15] that he had had all of his life amen and
[1:19:19] he looked at me and I said I'm I'm going
[1:19:22] to keep track of you and I'm going to be
[1:19:24] celebrating with you well I seen his
[1:19:27] sister I seen his sister a year or so
[1:19:30] ago and I asked how is he doing she says
