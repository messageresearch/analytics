[32:22] the house, they that build it labor in

[36:17] Praise the Lord.
[36:22] It's not with
[36:25] uh disdain or content or contentiousness
[36:30] that we surrender.
[36:32] It's because of a divine love. We are in
[36:36] love with the Lord Jesus.
[36:39] And he is he's everything to us. and I
[36:44] surrender everything that I am to him.
[36:48] Aren't Aren't you glad that you can do
[36:50] that here this morning?
[36:53] You can be seated for a few minutes.
[36:56] Brother Caleb and Sister Tina
[37:00] have their baby here this morning and um
[37:04] we are are are so grateful and so proud
[37:08] for them. if um there and you welcome to
[37:12] have the whole family to come up
[37:16] and uh
[37:18] this is brother Ezra Elias Martin
[37:24] and um
[37:26] I'd like to read a a scripture. I
[37:29] usually read a scripture before we do
[37:31] this. They're in Psalms 127 and3 this
[37:34] morning.
[37:36] It says, "Lo, children are inheritage of
[37:39] the Lord."
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; And the fruit of the womb is his reward.
[37:44] As arrows are in the hand of a mighty
[37:47] man,
[37:48] so are the children of the youth.
[37:51] Happy is the man that has his quiver
[37:54] full of them.
[37:56] They shall not be ashamed, but they
[37:59] shall speak with the enemies in the
[38:02] gates.
[38:03] And so we are um
[38:07] we're going to dedicate
[38:11] Ezra to the Lord and and um uh just like
[38:16] to say that we are just so uh so proud
[38:19] of of uh brother Caleb and Sister Tina.
[38:22] I hope I don't wake him up. Oh, lookie
[38:25] there. Isn't he a dandy?
[38:28] He's all cute this morning. Handsome.
[38:33] And uh and so I think the greatest thing
[38:36] we could do is give our children back to
[38:38] the Lord as as he has blessed them. And
[38:44] um I want us to all to pray here as we
[38:46] dedicate this child. Father,
[38:50] we want to thank you for your goodness
[38:53] to brother Caleb and Sister Tina,
[38:57] Lord, in blessing them with another
[39:00] child, a healthy child.
[39:03] And Lord, bringing Sister Tina through
[39:06] her labor and and keeping her healthy
[39:10] and keeping the baby healthy.
[39:14] And today, Lord, we're coming to give
[39:17] him back to you, Lord, as you have only
[39:21] loaned them to us,
[39:23] Lord, to raise in the fear and
[39:26] admonition
[39:28] of your grace.
[39:30] And Father, I ask that your blessings
[39:32] would be upon this child,
[39:34] that the anointing of God would cover
[39:37] him all the days of his life.
[39:41] I pray Lord that you would keep him
[39:43] healthy
[39:45] Lord and that you would protect him from
[39:48] all of the evil spirits
[39:51] around Lord but that your hand of
[39:54] protection would be upon his body upon
[39:58] his spirit upon his soul
[40:01] that Lord you would use him even as a
[40:03] child that your grace would be seen upon
[40:07] him father.
[40:09] Oh God, deal with him, Lord, and speak
[40:13] to him and show yourself real.
[40:16] Father, we give him to you. He is yours,
[40:20] Father. I pray that you give wisdom and
[40:23] grace to Brother Caleb and Sister Tina
[40:27] &gt;&gt; as they raise him. Father, meet their
[40:29] every need. always be with them, Lord,
[40:34] whenever they have a question or they're
[40:36] fearful or not knowing which way to go,
[40:40] Lord, in counsel for any of their
[40:43] children, always be there. And we'll
[40:46] give you glory and honor in Jesus name.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[40:54] Oh, he's awake.
[40:57] Amen.

[41:48] Amen. to make sure that our children are
[41:51] ready to go. Is that right? Amen. and
[41:54] that we're all ready to go. If you
[41:55] wouldn't mind standing to your feet
[41:56] again and Amen. I'm going to read here
[42:00] in the book of Genesis and the 18th
[42:05] chapter and um Amen. We sure um uh
[42:11] appreciate every one of you. We we're
[42:13] looking forward to next week. The
[42:15] children's been working on a play, a
[42:17] Christmas play, and so we're we're sure
[42:19] looking forward to that. You don't want
[42:21] to miss that. In fact, you want to tell
[42:23] your kids and everyone that you that you
[42:26] know or your your your family members.
[42:29] Amen. Um I know it's going to be a a
[42:32] wonderful time.
[42:34] Um there in we're going to just break in
[42:37] here
[42:39] um to Genesis 18 and 17.
[42:44] And the Lord said, "Shall I hide
[42:46] anything from Abraham,
[42:49] or shall I hide from Abraham that thing
[42:51] which I do?"
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[42:57] a great and mighty nation,
[43:00] and all the nations of the earth shall
[43:02] be blessed in him.
[43:04] For I know him, that he will command his
[43:08] children and his household after him.
[43:13] And they shall keep the way of the Lord
[43:15] to do justice in judgment, that the Lord
[43:18] may bring upon Abraham that which he
[43:22] spoke hath spoken of him. I I want to I
[43:29] want to uh take a a text out of this. I
[43:32] know him that he will take charge of his
[43:36] family, of his household. Let's go to
[43:39] the Lord in prayer. Father, we want to
[43:41] thank you today for your your greatness,
[43:44] your goodness. Thank you, Lord, for
[43:47] always being so kind to us, Lord.
[43:51] And we are with great love and respect
[43:56] and reverence,
[43:58] Lord, giving you the lordship of our
[44:00] lives. and of this service. And Lord, I
[44:05] forgot to give to uh brother Merurl the
[44:09] prayer request from Henrietta. Lord
[44:12] there, brother Wallace is having
[44:14] problems with his heart. Is going in for
[44:16] a test this week, not feeling good at
[44:19] all. Lord and Sister Applegate, Father,
[44:23] is is is hurting and her leg is really
[44:27] giving her a a fit again. Father,
[44:32] oh God, I got a request from Brother
[44:34] Donald that Aunt Angie's just so hurting
[44:38] so bad this morning. And Father, you you
[44:41] hear the request of your children. I
[44:45] pray, Lord, that you would send your
[44:48] word and that you would heal them even
[44:50] now where they are, Father. Now Lord, we
[44:54] look to you and we love you and we know
[44:56] that your you're faithful and that your
[45:00] word will come to pass when you said
[45:02] that you will heal everyone that has the
[45:06] faith. Now, Father, we just thank you
[45:09] for it. Ask that you would Lord just
[45:12] open your words of life to us this
[45:14] morning and we'll give you glory and
[45:16] honor in Jesus name. Can the church say
[45:20] amen?
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[45:24] seated here this morning. Amen. We want
[45:27] to
[45:28] uh thank God for his
[45:32] mighty hand. We talked a little bit last
[45:36] week on Amen. Abraham's life and and how
[45:43] that meant God had appeared to him in
[45:47] the form of Melzdc and and um and how
[45:52] that um it was a great happening there.
[45:58] Amen. the the um the the
[46:05] elect of God, if you will, that had the
[46:08] promise of God. Amen. And then God comes
[46:12] down through Melzdc. And
[46:16] &gt;&gt; and um and we understand that Melzdc is
[46:20] uh appeared to Abraham after the battle
[46:22] of the king. He was he was the he was
[46:25] prophet, priest, king. Amen. He was
[46:29] eternal without father, without mother,
[46:32] without beginning uh of days nor ending
[46:35] of life.
[46:37] And um Amen. And so God would come in a
[46:41] theophony.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; And so the great logos of God, Amen,
[46:45] would come and and appear in a temporal
[46:49] body unto Abraham. And and we believe it
[46:54] was none other than God himself.
[46:57] And God would appear to Abraham and and
[47:01] um he appeared again as we here in the
[47:04] 18th chapter. God is appearing again to
[47:06] Abraham and he's he's giving Abraham the
[47:10] uh uh God first of all Abraham sees God
[47:15] and he recognizes him as the one that he
[47:18] had been talking to and and so amen. The
[47:22] Bible The Bible says that God or that
[47:24] Abraham knew him. He knew uh God and he
[47:28] he he made a feast for him and and and
[47:32] so um Amen. when he come to visit with
[47:36] him, there was a reason for for a for
[47:39] God coming to Abraham. Amen. Was because
[47:44] he was the one he was the possessor of
[47:46] the promise. He was going to inherit the
[47:49] land. Yeah.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; And there would uh and and and and so
[47:54] the the time was getting closer. It was
[47:57] coming in to the promise, closer to the
[48:00] time of promise when God was uh going to
[48:04] Amen. take care of him and uh uh uh
[48:07] fulfill his word as he had promised.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, um, and and I I I think
[48:14] it's it's a wonderful thing because the
[48:16] promise is that he would come again in
[48:18] this last day that God would reveal
[48:21] himself. If you remember, Amen. There he
[48:24] says, "As it was in the days of Sodom,
[48:28] &gt;&gt; so shall it be in the revealing of the
[48:30] son of man." Yes.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Well, the 18th chapter is is is this
[48:35] scripture uh being fulfilled that Jesus
[48:38] was talking about as it was in the days
[48:40] of Sodom. When the son of man appeared
[48:42] to Abraham, so will it happen in the
[48:45] last day.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; And and so you can read that 18th
[48:49] chapter. Amen. And as as as God appears
[48:52] to him, he's fixing to go down. The two
[48:55] angels are fixing to go and to down to
[48:58] Sodom and and and to destroy Sodom.
[49:02] Amen. And and God says, "Can I can I
[49:05] hide anything from Abraham?" Amen. The
[49:10] thing that I do because I I I've GOT
[49:13] GREAT CONFIDENCE in Abraham. I've got a
[49:16] lot invested in Abraham
[49:18] &gt;&gt; and I know Abraham. I've given him a
[49:22] promise that he will inherit this land
[49:25] and that Amen. and he's going to produce
[49:28] a natural seed and a spiritual seed.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; AND AND SO GOD IS APPEARING unto uh the
[49:37] the natural seed and and he is letting
[49:40] him know, amen, he's he's saying the cry
[49:44] of Sodom and Gomorrah has risen up to
[49:47] me. Their sin is grievious and I'm going
[49:50] down to investigate.
[49:52] AND AND AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT ABRAHAM
[49:55] was so comfortable with God that he
[49:59] interceded with God. Abraham was so at
[50:04] one with God. He had recognized God so
[50:08] much that he is HE IS NOW TALKING WITH
[50:11] GOD, feeding God. God is eating there in
[50:14] his theophony body. Well, praise the
[50:17] Lord. Abraham called him Lord Jehovah.
[50:20] Can you say amen? and and and so he he
[50:24] was he you know he he was he was saying
[50:27] if there's 50 would you spare them and
[50:29] God says yeah I'll do that and then
[50:31] Abraham if there's 40 if there's 30 and
[50:34] he goes down and and he says listen if
[50:37] IF IF THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THERE but my
[50:40] family will you will you pull them out
[50:43] before the destruction isn't that just
[50:45] incredible how comfortable that Abraham
[50:49] was with this great God who had come
[50:53] talking to him in a body. And remember,
[50:55] as it was in the days of Sodom, so shall
[50:59] it be in the revealing before Jesus
[51:03] comes. Can you say amen? That there was
[51:06] going to be a relationship with God and
[51:10] his church. Amen. And and SO I I I I've
[51:14] always loved this and how that Abraham
[51:17] God appeared to Abram and God separated
[51:20] him to himself and God gave Abraham a
[51:24] promise and he God nurtured his faith
[51:27] and God changed his body to receive the
[51:30] promise. Everything all was centered
[51:32] around God.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; There was nothing that Abraham could do.
[51:35] All he could do was just the only thing
[51:37] Abraham had going for him was that God
[51:40] showed him kindness.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; God's grace was upon Abraham. Well, can
[51:46] you say man? You can't buy that favor.
[51:49] YOU CAN'T BUY THAT LOVE from God. IT WAS
[51:52] GOD WHO ELECTED. IT WAS GOD WHO CALLED.
[51:55] IT IS GOD WHO GAVE THE PROMISE. AND IT'S
[51:58] GOD WHO IS GOING TO FULFILL HIS WORD IN
[52:00] YOU.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE THE THE BIBLE EVEN SAYS THAT
[52:04] ABRAHAM WAS WAS GOD'S FRIEND. AMEN.
[52:08] Isaiah 41 and 8 it says he was the
[52:11] friend of God. Chron 2 Chronicles 20
[52:14] and7. Amen. It says Abraham was your
[52:17] friend. Uh uh this the writer talking to
[52:20] God. James 2:23 the scripture was filled
[52:24] which saith Abraham believed God and it
[52:27] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[52:29] and he was called the friend of God. You
[52:32] know, I want it to BE SAID THAT I AM A
[52:36] BELIEVER.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; OKAY. YES, SIR.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY WANTS THAT TO BE SAID IN your
[52:39] life?
[52:40] &gt;&gt; That you believe God. You You don't You
[52:44] might not have everything else going for
[52:46] you, BUT IF IF YOU'RE A BELIEVER, you've
[52:48] got a lot You've got a lot going FOR
[52:50] YOU.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT A LOT GOING FOR
[52:53] YOU. AND AND GOD IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
[52:56] TO BELIEVE HIM IN this day to believe
[52:59] him AND TO HAVE A CONFIDENCE IN HIM and
[53:03] to stand for that word in this day. I I
[53:07] BELIEVE THAT AMEN. IT WASN'T IT WASN'T
[53:10] JUST UH uh always uh uh uh uh uh uh just
[53:14] you know peaceful around Abraham's place
[53:17] because at ONE TIME LOT WAS THERE WITH
[53:20] ABRAHAM. AMEN. He didn't fully obey as
[53:23] we talked about last Sunday. Amen. He
[53:26] didn't fully surrender and and Lotus AND
[53:29] AND HIS DAD AND ALL OF THESE OTHER
[53:31] PEOPLE come with him and Amen. And it
[53:33] was it was not a good thing. And there
[53:35] was a A A REQUIREMENT from God to
[53:39] separate himself, Amen. from his family.
[53:44] HE HAD TO SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM LOT.
[53:47] That that doesn't necessarily mean that
[53:48] you have to when you get saved, you have
[53:50] to leave all of your kin folk. Amen. But
[53:53] I'm here to tell you, you do have to
[53:54] separate yourself from unbelief. You do
[53:58] have to separate yourself to God. And
[54:00] sometimes, AMEN. YOUR KIN FOLKS are
[54:03] you're going to have to separate
[54:04] yourself from your kin folk. Sometimes
[54:06] you're GOING TO HAVE TO SEPARATE
[54:08] yourself from your friends BECAUSE IF
[54:10] YOU'RE NOT GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION
[54:13] THAT YOU ARE GOING IN, you've got to
[54:16] walk alone with God.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? BUT SO HERE LOT
[54:23] WAS LOT DID NOT HAVE the same perception
[54:26] as Abraham had. Amen. They started
[54:29] together but they had two different
[54:31] goals. One was looking to the eternal
[54:33] value and there was the other that was
[54:35] looking to the earthly value. There was
[54:37] one, amen, that was just sort of out of
[54:39] his mind looking for a a a city whose
[54:43] builder and maker was God. Amen. A city
[54:46] and HE AND HE WAS CONSTANTLY looking for
[54:48] this. He was a revelation in his heart.
[54:50] Lot on the other hand, all he all he was
[54:52] interested in is more money, more
[54:55] things. And and when they finally
[54:56] separated, Amen. uh he looked down to
[55:00] the well-watered plains of Sodom and
[55:02] said, "I'll pitch my tent down there,
[55:03] and I there's where I can make some
[55:05] money, and there's where I'm going to
[55:07] raise my family." That was not what God
[55:11] had in mind for Abraham. God did not
[55:14] appear unto Sod UNTO LOT IN SODOM. He
[55:17] appeared unto Abram. He appeared to him.
[55:21] And and and WHY DID HE APPEAR? HE SAYS,
[55:24] "I CAN I keep anything away from
[55:27] Abraham?
[55:29] seeing that he is going to uh uh uh take
[55:33] charge of his children and his family.
[55:37] He's going to walk in my ways AND SHOW
[55:41] THEM THE ways of life. LOT IS NOT DOING
[55:45] THAT. BUT I DO KNOW ABRAHAM. I'VE HAD
[55:48] CONTACT WITH HIM. I AM A friend of
[55:51] Abraham. And there's where I want to
[55:54] speak here for a little bit this
[55:55] morning. Amen. as the head of the
[55:59] household, Lot failed. He failed his
[56:03] wife. He failed his children. They
[56:05] suffered for it is because there was not
[56:08] divine revelation in the in the uh in
[56:13] the HEART OF LOT. LOT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
[56:16] GOD WAS DOING. GOD COULDN'T HE COULDN'T
[56:18] SEE, AMEN. that the sin was killing his
[56:22] children. He couldn't see that that the
[56:24] that the children were uh UH WERE BEING
[56:28] AFFECTED IN SUCH A WAY. AMEN. HE
[56:31] COULDN'T SEE THAT GOD WAS FIXING TO BURN
[56:33] IT UP. But Abraham could see,
[56:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:38] &gt;&gt; I wonder today I wonder today as we as
[56:41] we stop and think about where we are at
[56:43] this A THIS MORNING, HOW GOOD IT IS TO
[56:46] KNOW. AMEN. NOT just hearing it, not
[56:49] just reading it that the B, you know,
[56:52] that that the earth is going to burn
[56:53] with fire and heat. Amen. But to have
[56:56] the revelation deep DOWN INSIDE THAT GOD
[57:00] IS CALLED YOU, elected you,
[57:03] predestinated you to COME AND YOU HAVE
[57:06] SEPARATED YOURSELF FROM THE WORLD.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE SEPARATED YOURSELF, AMEN, unto
[57:13] him. Not separating yourself unto me.
[57:16] not separating yourself unto William
[57:18] Brandham or to uh uh whoever else. YOU
[57:22] ARE SEPARATING YOURSELF UNTO GOD. GOD
[57:25] GIVES HIS word and you separate yourself
[57:30] unto him.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when they had started together,
[57:36] Amen. One had eternal value, other was
[57:39] just looking at the earthly, the here
[57:41] and the now. AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "BE
[57:44] there in 2 uh Corinthians 6 and:14, be
[57:48] not unequally yolked together with
[57:49] unbelievers. FOR WHAT FELLOWSHIP HATH
[57:52] RIGHTEOUSNESS WITH UNRIGHTEOUSNESS? WHAT
[57:54] COMMUNION HATH LIGHT WITH DARKNESS? WHAT
[57:57] CONCORD HATH CHRIST WITH BAL? WHAT PART
[58:01] HATH he that believeth with an infidel?
[58:04] What agreement hath the temple of God
[58:06] with idols? For you are the temple of
[58:09] the living God. AND AS GOD HAD SAID, I
[58:12] WILL DWELL WITH THEM and walk in them,
[58:15] and I WILL BE THEIR GOD, and they shall
[58:18] be MY PEOPLE. SOMEONE SHOUT HALLELUJAH.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; WHEREFORE COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM, and
[58:25] be ye separate, and I uh uh saith THE
[58:31] LORD, AND TOUCH NOT THE UNCLEAN THING,
[58:34] and I will receive you. I AND WILL BE A
[58:37] FATHER UNTO YOU and you shall be my sons
[58:40] and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
[58:42] Can you say amen? YOU ARE NOT PART OF
[58:46] THEM.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; You're not part of them. Amen. God's
[58:51] calling us for separation.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; THE REASON WHY AMEN. We we we do not
[58:57] take AND AND AND PULL in every game into
[59:00] our home and AND AND AND PULL IN EVERY
[59:03] SPIRIT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE
[59:06] SPIRITS.
[59:08] THERE ARE SPIRITS THAT ARE OUT THERE
[59:10] TODAY. LOT DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. ABRAHAM
[59:14] KEPT HIS family away from it.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Abraham was going to believe for the
[59:19] things of God. LOT HAD NOTHING TO CHANGE
[59:22] HIM BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE THE
[59:23] REVELATION. LOT DID NOT HAVE THE
[59:26] REVELATION. GOD DID NOT APPEAR TO LOT.
[59:29] GOD APPEARED TO ABRAHAM. GOD DID NOT
[59:33] TELL LOT THAT IT WAS FIXING TO BURN UP
[59:35] IN FIRE, BUT GOD APPEARED UNTO ABRAHAM.
[59:38] AND ABRAHAM THEREFORE COULD INTERCEDE
[59:41] for his lost family. Can you say amen?
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Denominations have turned into
[59:48] just a big uh the church is nothing more
[59:51] than just a game. Churches are nothing
[59:53] more than just a BUNCH OF ENTERTAINMENT,
[59:55] ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC FOR WORSHIP AND
[59:58] LIGHTS AND AND AND and there's there's
[1:00:00] there's there's no Amen. When you come
[1:00:02] to church and earn a sto trying to come
[1:00:04] to church ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT, AMEN.
[1:00:06] ALL THERE IS IS NOTHING BUT GAMES AND
[1:00:08] PLAY. AMEN. THERE'S JUST GAMES AND AND
[1:00:11] AND AND AND the and YOU KNOW, EVEN THE
[1:00:13] SUNDAY MORNING SERVICES ARE NOTHING but
[1:00:15] a 20 minute little sermonet. But I'm
[1:00:17] here to tell you if you REALLY TRULY
[1:00:20] BELIEVE THAT GOD'S HAND IS UPON YOU AND
[1:00:23] IF YOU HAVE HEARD THE VOICE OF MELZDC
[1:00:26] AND IF THAT VOICE HAS SAID LISTEN AMEN
[1:00:29] THE TIME IS GROWING NEAR THAT I WOULD
[1:00:31] SAY GOD GIVE ME THE CONVICTION to stand
[1:00:35] and to be separate.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:00:40] Only the revelation of the son of man
[1:00:44] produces the change.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT VISITATION, AMEN, WAS DOING A
[1:00:49] LOT OF THINGS. IT WAS SHOWING HIM what
[1:00:52] was happening in Sodom, but it was also
[1:00:54] enabling him to have a child. Abraham
[1:00:58] and Sarah were dead. Amen. BARREN. BUT
[1:01:01] WHEN GOD, THAT VISIT ON THAT day
[1:01:05] produced the ability to change their
[1:01:08] lives.

[1:01:54] morning. AMEN. TO PARALYZE IS TO
[1:01:57] DISABLE. TO PARALYZE IS TO INCAPACITATE.
[1:02:01] TO PARALYZE IS TO BECOME IMMOBILIZED, to
[1:02:05] render ineffective. AMEN. TO PARALYZE IS
[1:02:09] TO BRING TO a a grinding halt. THE
[1:02:12] PROPHET OF GOD WOULD SAY LOT could see
[1:02:15] the GLAMOUR AND OF PROSPERITY DOWN IN
[1:02:18] EGYPT OR DOWN IN SODOM. AND LOT COULD
[1:02:21] SEE THE POSSIBILITIES OF MONEY. AMEN.
[1:02:24] AND LOT'S INTELLECTS LED HIM TO THE
[1:02:26] GLAMOUR OF PROSPERITY. Lot's intellect
[1:02:29] led him to to see the blessings of
[1:02:31] glamour, BUT HIS FAITH WAS SO PARALYZED
[1:02:34] BY IT THAT HE DIDN'T SEE THE FIRE THAT
[1:02:38] WAS GOING TO DESTROY that sort of life.
[1:02:40] AND IT PARALYZED, AMEN. WHAT LITTLE
[1:02:43] FAITH you've got. Amen. IT OR IT
[1:02:47] PARALYZES WHAT LITTLE FAITH YOU HAVE
[1:02:49] GOT. AMEN. LOT COULD SEE THE GLAMOUR,
[1:02:52] BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FAITH to see
[1:02:54] the fire that would destroy such
[1:02:56] glamour. ANOTHER PLACE IT IT JUST
[1:02:59] BECOMES SO CALLOUS TILL IT BECOMES A
[1:03:02] REGULAR routine of PEOPLE DOING IT.
[1:03:04] AMEN. TALKING ABOUT THE PLEASURES OF
[1:03:06] THIS LIFE, IT BECOMES SO CALLOUS UNTIL
[1:03:10] IT BECOMES A REGULAR routine of the
[1:03:12] people doing it. I WONDER IF THEY DON'T
[1:03:14] PARALYZE WHAT LITTLE FAITH, THE VERY
[1:03:16] LITTLE FAITH THAT YOU HAD. AMEN. even to
[1:03:19] go TO CHURCH. AMEN. LOT DID THAT AND IT
[1:03:23] PARALYZED HIM AND IT PARALYZED HIS
[1:03:26] PEOPLE DOWN there and they couldn't see
[1:03:29] it. Can you say amen?

[1:21:20] will wax cold IN THE LEOTY AND LAST AGE,
[1:21:23] SELF-LOVE AND LOVE FOR MATERIAL THINGS
[1:21:26] WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF the true love of
[1:21:27] God. AND WE NEED TO GUARD AGAINST THE
[1:21:30] POWER OF SIN in these LAST DAYS. SO MANY
[1:21:35] ARE GETTING SO HARD BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T
[1:21:39] REALIZED THE EFFECTS of this last day.
[1:21:44] IT'S TIME TO DRAW NIGH TO GOD AND LET
[1:21:47] HIM FILL OUR LIVES WITH HIS LOVE OR WE
[1:21:50] will feel the coldness of the last day
[1:21:53] church and reject the truth which God

[1:22:02] we want this morning is courage.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; If if there's if there's somebody that's
[1:22:06] feeling a little empty, a little down, I
[1:22:09] just want to tell you take courage here
[1:22:11] this morning. MATTER OF FACT, WHY DON'T
[1:22:13] YOU JUST TURN TO YOUR NEIGHBOR and say,
[1:22:14] "Take courage." Hallelujah. Amen. The
[1:22:17] Bible says THAT THAT DAVID ENCOURAGED
[1:22:19] HIMSELF in the Lord. Why don't you JUST
[1:22:20] ENCOURAGE YOURSELF? AMEN. CALL YOURSELF

[1:22:39] kind of teachings, these kind of
[1:22:40] teachings, you boys SHOULD BE ON THE
[1:22:42] EDGE OF YOUR SEAT AND SHOULD HAVE A
[1:22:43] PENCIL IN YOUR HAND AND WRITING THESE
[1:22:45] THINGS DOWN BECAUSE YOU ARE THE NEXT
[1:22:48] GENERATION.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THAT NEXT GENERATION. AMEN. I
[1:22:52] KNOW I, YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE THAT I'M
[1:22:54] PREACHING THIS. THE THESE ELDERS HAVE
[1:22:56] ALREADY HEARD AND READ AND AND LISTENED.
[1:22:59] PERHAPS THEY DON'T EVEN NEED IT. I THINK
[1:23:01] WE ALL NEED IT OCCASIONALLY, BUT I TELL
[1:23:03] YOU SOMEONE THAT DOES NEED IT. THAT'S
[1:23:05] YOU YOUNG MEN.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOU YOUNG MEN. AMEN. SO THERE
[1:23:08] SHOULD NOT BE AMEN PLAYING AROUND OR
[1:23:11] FALLING ASLEEP OR ANY OF THESE KINDS OF
[1:23:14] THINGS. THERE SHOULD BE A REALITY THAT
[1:23:16] SAYS I WANT TO KNOW WHAT GOD REQUIRES of
[1:23:20] me.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Courage to open our hearts for the
[1:23:24] Holy Spirit. WELL, AM I ALL RIGHT HERE

[1:23:44] anywhere. No leaven anywhere. IT WAS THE
[1:23:48] RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE.
[1:23:51] AMEN. To take the candle. Amen. And to
[1:23:55] go through the cupboards AND TO MAKE
[1:23:57] SURE THERE WAS NO LEAVEN. THEY WERE TO
[1:23:59] LOOK IN EVERY CORNER OF THE HOUSE, UNDER
[1:24:02] THE BEDS, EVERY THERE HAD TO BE. AND
[1:24:04] THIS WAS A TYPE LEVAN WAS SIN. AND IN
[1:24:08] THIS PASSOVER THAT WE ARE IN, THE
[1:24:11] REQUIREMENT IS STILL THE SAME. THE
[1:24:13] RESPONSIBILITY TO US MEN IS TO ENSURE
[1:24:18] TAKE THE CANDLE OF GOD'S WORD AND MAKE
[1:24:21] SURE THERE'S NO SIN IN THE HOUSE.
[1:24:28] If you leave that sin in that bedroom,

[1:24:55] MAN OF THE HOUSE.

[1:25:12] This thing here could lead I don't want
[1:25:13] that happening." Amen. Honey, there's a
[1:25:16] reason that we're we we we don't watch
[1:25:18] this. There's a reason we don't have
[1:25:20] Amen. those things in the in in our
[1:25:23] house and that we're NOT AMEN. DON'T

[1:25:49] HAD TO DO THIS EVERY TIME. You say,

[1:25:55] every Passover,
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; And we are living under the Passover,
[1:25:59] Jesus Christ, our sacrificial lamb.

[1:30:14] HAVE

[1:30:19] on in the church." And

[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Come on.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I'm coming to Abraham
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; because I've got this confidence that
[1:34:17] Abraham
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; is going to take charge.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now
[1:34:29] man,
[1:34:30] when we
[1:34:32] attitudes and feelings and emotions
[1:34:37] have become so rooted in the belief
[1:34:39] system,
[1:34:41] it's become so rooted inside the belief
[1:34:43] system
[1:34:45] until the church has become paralyzed.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Families become paralyzed.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE'VE GOT A GOD THAT'LL THAT'LL
[1:34:54] THAT'LL PERFORM A MIRACLE RIGHT NOW,
[1:34:55] RIGHT THERE. RIGHT NOW, right there for
[1:34:57] somebody that's willing to stand up and
[1:34:58] take him at his word.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; But we have served,
[1:35:05] we're not serving the masculine god of
[1:35:07] Jesus Christ. We might as well go and
[1:35:09] start serving the feminine God of Diana
[1:35:12] or whatever
[1:35:19] BECAUSE GOD IS NOT A GOD OF EMOTION,
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? GOD IS A GOD OF HIS WORD.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; AND IF WE EXPECT ANYTHING FROM GOD,
[1:35:30] WE'VE GOT TO BELIEVE AND HAVE CONVICTION
[1:35:33] THAT HIS WORD IS RIGHT. AND IF YOU TRULY
[1:35:36] BELIEVE THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO RALLY YOUR
[1:35:38] FAMILY AROUND THAT WORD AND SAY, "THIS
[1:35:40] IS WHERE WE STAND."
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Not following your pet peeve. Amen.
[1:35:46] Well, I'm the man around here. So, you

[1:35:53] WHATEVER. WHAT? WHATEVER. YOU KNOW, JUST
[1:35:55] CRAZY THINGS THAT comes up.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:00] Anything.
[1:36:02] But why don't we just come back and
[1:36:03] establish our families upon this?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Cuz one of these days, I'm going to be
[1:36:08] gone.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; All right, brother.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; And Kobe, you'd better have this. And
[1:36:14] one of these days you're going to be
[1:36:15] gone. And CNN, you better have this.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; One. And when he's gone, Mary,
[1:36:24] you better have that.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Think about it.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; When I go, I don't know. I COULD DROP
[1:36:31] DEAD. I SOME OF THE STAIRS I'M GETTING
[1:36:33] RIGHT NOW, I could drop dead anytime.
[1:36:35] Hallelujah. But but uh
[1:36:38] I'm just trying to get y'all back
[1:36:40] smiling. HALLELUJAH. WHAT I'M TRYING TO
[1:36:43] SAY IS, AMEN. YOU HAD BETTER GET YOUR
[1:36:47] BELIEF SYSTEM IN THIS.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; DON'T PUT YOUR BELIEF SYSTEM AND WHAT
[1:36:55] YOU FEEL, WHAT YOU THINK.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; WON'T YOU STAND ON THE WORD OF GOD? WHY
[1:37:01] DON'T FAMILIES STAND? I'M TALKING ABOUT
[1:37:03] A PARALYZED FAITH. I'm talking about a
[1:37:06] miracle working God. Amen. where that
[1:37:08] word will START PUMPING THAT THAT BLOOD
[1:37:10] BACK INTO OUR VEINS AGAIN. AND WE'RE NO
[1:37:12] LONGER AMEN WE'RE NO LONGER ANEMIC.
[1:37:14] WE'RE NO LONGER LETHARGIC. WE'RE NO
[1:37:16] LONGER JUST AMEN HERE AND THERE. BUT WE
[1:37:19] GOT A BACKBONE ABOUT US TO STAND UP AND
[1:37:21] SAY, "I BELIEVE GOD IS MY HEALER. I
[1:37:24] BELIEVE GOD IS MY SAVIOR. I BELIEVE GOD
[1:37:26] SHOULD BE THE ONE THAT MY FAMILY should
[1:37:29] live with."
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen."
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[1:37:37] we're not to go by emotions.
[1:37:41] You'll end up feeling lost more than
[1:37:43] times than not.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; You'll be defeated. Amen. Because of
[1:37:49] worship feelings. Can you say amen?
[1:37:52] But remember,
[1:37:54] we ought to thank God.
[1:37:57] We ought to thank God for for men.
[1:38:01] The the the Bible says there in Hebrews
[1:38:04] 13 and 77, remember them which have the
[1:38:08] rule over you.
[1:38:11] For they watch
[1:38:14] who have spoken unto you the word of
[1:38:16] God, whose faith following
[1:38:19] considering
[1:38:21] the end of their conversation or
[1:38:22] consider the outcome of their life and
[1:38:24] mimic or imitate their faith.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:29] For they must give an account. Amen.
[1:38:34] Let's go to the seventh. Is that is that
[1:38:35] the next part of it? Amen. Where they
[1:38:37] must give an account. Amen. Oh, the next
[1:38:40] the next one is um he Hebrews 13:17.
[1:38:45] Obey them that have the rule over you
[1:38:46] and submit yourselves for they watch for
[1:38:49] your souls.
[1:38:51] Amen. Did I mess those two scriptures
[1:38:52] up? Hebrews 13:7. Remember them which
[1:38:55] have the rule over you who have spoken
[1:38:56] unto you the word of God whose faith
[1:38:58] follow considering the end of their
[1:38:59] conversation.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; So the responsibility is there not not
[1:39:04] not for us men to lead how it to to to
[1:39:09] leave according to our own dictates.
[1:39:11] We've got to live according to the
[1:39:13] dictates of scripture.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sisters, you're not to lead
[1:39:18] the family.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:39:22] You say, "Well, don't don't don't isn't
[1:39:24] isn't the husband supposed to support
[1:39:26] the wife?" Yes.
[1:39:28] That is true. We play that supportive
[1:39:30] role.
[1:39:33] But the man
[1:39:36] is the He's the president.
[1:39:40] He's the executive.
[1:39:44] And he's called you to be his chief of
[1:39:46] staff.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; He's called you, but the chief of staff
[1:39:50] has still got a Sure.
[1:39:53] Okay.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I think I'm just going
[1:40:00] to keep on going.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. The family.
[1:40:07] The family, if it is ran by the woman,
[1:40:11] will always be under a curse until the
[1:40:14] family gets in order.
[1:40:18] The husband is not TO SUPPORT THE WIFE'S
[1:40:20] DECREES. THE H WIFE IS TO SUPPORT THE
[1:40:23] HUSBAND'S DECREES. AND THEN DON'T LEAVE
[1:40:27] YOUR WIFE. Don't leave her HOLDING THE
[1:40:30] BAG IF SHE'S DOING SOMETHING SHE YOU'VE
[1:40:32] TOLD HER TO DO.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; That takes that TAKES THAT TAKES ALL OF
[1:40:41] the that takes all of the emotion or it
[1:40:44] takes all the load off of the lady.
[1:40:47] Because the man is stepping up and
[1:40:49] saying, "Listen,
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not being mean." No, I I am not I'm
[1:40:54] not I'm not advocating mean. I'm not
[1:40:57] advocating being belligerent. I'm not
[1:40:58] advocating being Amen. A JERK. I'M
[1:41:01] ADVOCATING BEING A SHEPHERD.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; BEING A SHEPHERD, WATCHING OVER THAT
[1:41:08] HOME, LOVING YOUR WIFE, LOVING YOUR
[1:41:11] CHILDREN AS GOD LOVES THE CHURCH.
[1:41:17] Can you say amen?
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Wives, you should support your husband.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; If your wife, if your husband says you
[1:41:25] shouldn't, you know, those girls
[1:41:26] shouldn't wear that kind of a blouse,
[1:41:31] don't jump in.
[1:41:34] He's a man.
[1:41:40] Maybe go talk to him at the side off to
[1:41:42] the side in the bedroom.
[1:41:45] Well, honey, I I don't and let the man
[1:41:47] talk the peace. But when it comes to
[1:41:48] that family, your husband is to lead
[1:41:52] that family.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and for those who are still I
[1:42:01] mean I mean I I brought these these
[1:42:05] scriptures here just in case it did go
[1:42:07] south. But 1 Corinthians 11 and3 I would
[1:42:10] have you to know that the head of every
[1:42:11] man is Christ and the head of woman is
[1:42:14] the man
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; and the head of Christ is God. Second 2
[1:42:18] SECOND 2 TIMOTHY 2:12 BUT I SUFFER NOT A
[1:42:21] WOMAN TO TEACH NOR USURP AUTHORITY OVER
[1:42:24] THE MAN.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; We're not to usurp authority.
[1:42:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; OH, DON'T BE MAKING HIM LOOK GOOD IN
[1:42:35] FRONT OF YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE
[1:42:38] THE ONE AND AND AND AND YOU'RE YOU'RE
[1:42:40] MAKING HIM DO EVERYTHING according to
[1:42:42] you, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF
[1:42:44] AND YOU need to get right with God.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; A woman IS NOT TO USURP AUTHORITY OVER
[1:42:54] THE MAN.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; That is not her call.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Boy, this is serious, ain't it, brother
[1:43:04] Windle? Yeah, it is. Right?
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; He's the shepherd.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; He's the shepherd
[1:43:18] over y'all's little flock.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I'm just going to
[1:43:26] go ahead and do a jig right now because
[1:43:28] I know some of you are wanting to.
[1:43:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:31] Good.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; I suffer not a woman to teach, nor usurp
[1:43:35] authority over the man, but to be in
[1:43:37] silence. For Adam was first formed, then
[1:43:40] Eve, Adam was not deceived, but the
[1:43:42] woman being deceived was in the
[1:43:43] transgression. Notwithstanding, she
[1:43:45] shall be saved in childbearing, if they
[1:43:46] continue in the faith and charity, and
[1:43:48] holiness with sobriety. When God visited
[1:43:51] Abraham, when God visited Abraham, God
[1:43:54] came to Abraham.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. He come and reveal himself to
[1:43:59] Abraham.
[1:44:01] You know what the prophet said over and
[1:44:02] over and over in the messages?
[1:44:05] He said, "You will notice
[1:44:08] SARAH DIDN'T JUMP INTO THE CONVERSATION
[1:44:10] LIKE WE SEE A LOT OF OTHER WOMEN DO."
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; She said, "Back then
[1:44:18] there was a respect for Abraham."
[1:44:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Wasn't with women wasn't as brazen as
[1:44:25] they are today. They stayed back and
[1:44:27] take care of their business in them
[1:44:28] days. Amen. She was back in the tent.
[1:44:31] Today, she has to run her husband's
[1:44:33] business and all the rest of the
[1:44:34] business and everything else. Now, I'm
[1:44:37] not saying that to you sisters. Of
[1:44:38] course, you all don't wouldn't do that.
[1:44:40] I'm talking about the women of the
[1:44:41] world. Sarah stayed back in the tent
[1:44:44] where she belonged.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; SO, I'M GLAD I'M GLAD HE CLARIFIED THAT.
[1:44:50] WE DON'T HAVE TO have worry about that
[1:44:51] in the church. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, AMEN. HERE THE APOSTLE
[1:44:56] PETER 1 PETER 3:1 LIKEWISE YOU WIVES BE
[1:45:00] IN SUBJECTION TO YOUR OWN HUSBANDS THAT
[1:45:02] IF ANY OBEY NOT IN NOT THE WORD THEY
[1:45:06] ALSO MAY WITHOUT THE WORD BE ONE BY THE
[1:45:08] CONVERSATION OF THE WIVES WHILE THEY
[1:45:10] BEHOLD YOUR CHASE conversation or
[1:45:12] lifestyle covered with fear uh uh whose
[1:45:16] adorning let it not be the outward
[1:45:17] adorning of the plating of hair and the
[1:45:18] wearing of gold and the putting on of
[1:45:20] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[1:45:22] the heart in which is not corruptible
[1:45:24] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[1:45:26] spirit which is in the sight of God of
[1:45:28] GREAT PIES. FOR AFTER THIS MANNER IN OLD
[1:45:33] TIMES, BROTHER brother Merl's talked
[1:45:35] about going back to THE OLD LANDMARKS.
[1:45:37] OLD TIMES, HALLELUJAH. SEE, you was used
[1:45:40] to the Lord more than you thought this
[1:45:41] morning. Amen. Other times THEM WOMEN
[1:45:45] ALSO WHO TRUSTED IN GOD ADORNED
[1:45:47] THEMSELVES BEING and subjected to their
[1:45:49] own husband, even as Sarah obeyed
[1:45:52] Abraham, calling him Lord. HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:56] WHOSE DAUGHTERS ye are as long as you do
[1:45:58] well and are not afraid with any
[1:46:00] amazement.
[1:46:02] Now,
[1:46:03] am I is this is this Bible? Are you are
[1:46:06] you are you pulling this stuff up out of
[1:46:07] the Bible? Amen.
[1:46:14] Where's the family today?
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Why is the family?
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh.
[1:46:28] Smite the shepherd.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; And scatter the sheep.
[1:46:36] Oh,
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; so we do need
[1:46:43] one of those
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; cruel,
[1:46:50] worthless,
[1:46:54] egotistic,
[1:46:56] loud men in our lives.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; They're shepherds.
[1:47:04] Yes,
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; well, glory to God.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; So, God's not calling God's not calling
[1:47:12] just this thing. This this ain't a a
[1:47:15] This ain't just a little picnic. This
[1:47:18] thing ain't

[1:47:31] AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS THAT THE
[1:47:33] DEVIL WANTS TO DESTROY EVERY ONE OF
[1:47:35] THEM.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; PREACH IT.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; THEY WANT TO SATAN WANTS TO DESTROY YOUR
[1:47:41] CHILDREN. DOG IT. THAT DEVIL IS A LIAR.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; HE'S A THIEF. HE WANTS TO DESTROY OUR
[1:47:50] FAMILIES. BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME
[1:47:52] SHEPHERDS THAT'S GOING TO STAND UP AND
[1:47:53] SAY, "NO, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ON MY
[1:47:56] WATCH.
[1:48:00] NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ON MY WATCH.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.

[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; emotionally.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Emotionally,
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; spiritually. Amen.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; I'm coming and talking to you, Abram. I
[1:48:29] ain't talking to this guy. He He don't
[1:48:34] He don't know the sky from the ground.
[1:48:37] But Abraham,
[1:48:41] I called you and you have separated
[1:48:44] yourself.
[1:48:46] And now I'm coming to tell you some
[1:48:48] secrets
[1:48:50] because I know that you are going to
[1:48:53] take me serious.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; You're going to take your family
[1:48:57] serious. You're going to take your call
[1:48:59] serious. You're going to take my word
[1:49:01] serious.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen?
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; In order to be an effective leader,
[1:49:08] Amen. you must have the same convictions
[1:49:11] that Jesus has. You boys, if you're
[1:49:13] going to be a coni a a if you're going
[1:49:16] to have be a SUCCESSFUL LEADER, YOU'VE
[1:49:19] GOT TO HAVE THE SAME CONVICTIONS THAT
[1:49:22] JESUS JESUS CALLED US MEN. AMEN. TO BE
[1:49:26] LEADERS. HE CALLED US MEN TO BE
[1:49:29] SHEPHERDS. AND IN ORDER FOR US TO BE
[1:49:31] EFFECTIVE, WE HAVE WE HAVE GOT TO TO TO
[1:49:35] TO HAVE THE SAME EXACT CONVICTIONS THAT
[1:49:38] JESUS HAD when he gave them to us.
[1:49:42] Okay.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; He must be my Lord
[1:49:47] if I'm going to be an effective leader
[1:49:49] to my wife.
[1:49:52] I've got to bow at the cross.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; His word must be my everything.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; If I'm going to be that
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; if I'm going to be that shepherd, I've
[1:50:05] got to have THE BANNER OF HIS WORD. I'VE
[1:50:08] GOT TO HAVE THIS END TIME BANNER.
[1:50:13] GOD.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Oh God give us the convictions.
[1:50:26] OH GOD
[1:50:28] TO WHERE your word is our everything, to
[1:50:31] where your spirit is our everything.
[1:50:34] I pray God that these YOUNG MEN WILL
[1:50:36] RISE UP TODAY AND SAY, "LET ME BE
[1:50:39] ACCOUNTED FOR." EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN
[1:50:41] MARRIED,
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN MARRIED, STAND
[1:50:43] UP TODAY AND SAY, "LET ME BE ACCOUNTED
[1:50:45] FOR. LET ME BEAR THE CROSS OF JESUS. LET
[1:50:49] ME LET RAISE IT UP AS an end sign."
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; John 12:26, "If any man serve me, let
[1:51:00] him follow me. Where I am, there shall
[1:51:03] also my servant be.
[1:51:06] And if any man serve me, him will my
[1:51:09] father honor.
[1:51:11] We want to be honored of the Lord. We
[1:51:14] want God to bless us. Then let me
[1:51:18] follow him that called me.
[1:51:22] Oh, praise the Lord, brothers. We've
[1:51:24] only got one one agenda, and it's not to
[1:51:27] cowell. Amen. To your wife. And it's not
[1:51:30] to make sure that your children have all
[1:51:33] the latest digital
[1:51:35] demons. And it's NOT TO HAVE THE FINEST
[1:51:38] CLOTHING in the church. Amen. You've got
[1:51:41] one priority, and that's to please the
[1:51:44] one who has called you to be a minister
[1:51:47] to your family.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; To please the one who has called you.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Again, I I I I'm
[1:51:55] not I'm not advocating to be indifferent
[1:51:57] and cruel and mean and belligerent.
[1:52:00] I'm saying that the responsibility for
[1:52:03] my family that I'M THE SHEPHERD OF MY
[1:52:06] FLOCK, IT'S NOT MY WIFE'S
[1:52:08] RESPONSIBILITY. I KNOW I KNOW SOME MEN,
[1:52:11] AMEN, THEY'VE WORKED ALL THEIR LIVES,
[1:52:12] AMEN, AND THEIR CHILDREN DON'T EVEN KNOW
[1:52:14] WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A A YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
[1:52:16] THEY'VE always been gone, always been
[1:52:18] all over the countryside and let the
[1:52:19] wife raise. That's not the way GOD
[1:52:22] INTENDED IT. A MAN IS TO RAISE. A MAN IS
[1:52:26] TO SHEPHERD. A MAN IS TO WATCH THOSE
[1:52:28] SAY. A MAN IS TO BE NOT THE WOMAN. THE
[1:52:31] WOMAN IS NOT THERE. THANK GOD FOR THE
[1:52:34] WOMAN. THE WOMAN HAS HER PLACE. I'M
[1:52:36] TALKING ABOUT LEADERSHIP THIS MORNING.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; AND YOU ALL YOU LADIES KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
[1:52:42] I THINK ABOUT Y'ALL. I think you guys
[1:52:44] are y'all's way up here in my books.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:51] I have no problem with
[1:52:54] women helping me here at the church all
[1:52:56] the time. I mean, Sister Leah runs the
[1:52:58] the cleaning. Uh uh Sister Keys over the
[1:53:01] kitchen. Sister Sister uh
[1:53:05] Brianna takes care of the decorations.
[1:53:08] Uh uh we've got we've got we've got uh
[1:53:11] uh you know uh sister uh oh I know
[1:53:15] better than to start calling names but
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Huhose
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Rose. Sister what? Yeah. Just tell me
[1:53:22] your name. Amen. Rose. Sister Rose.
[1:53:24] Amen. On the Sunday school we got we've
[1:53:26] got women in here. Amen. And you're an
[1:53:28] incredible blessing. My wife my my my my
[1:53:31] wife everyone knows my wife don't have
[1:53:33] to walk five feet behind me. My My wife
[1:53:36] and I are buddies and we we're we're in
[1:53:38] life together. We're we're in it. Amen.
[1:53:41] RIGHT.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN IT COMES, SHE BETTER RESPECT
[1:53:47] THAT. SHE BETTER RESPECT THIS POSITION
[1:53:49] THAT GOD'S PUT ME IN.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; IF NOT, IT HURTS HER.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Am I doing all right?
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:54:08] I AM THE ONE RESPONSIBLE
[1:54:11] for watching for those spirits.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; I am the one and my desire.
[1:54:20] I'm going to have to answer to God for
[1:54:22] my church. I'm going to have to answer
[1:54:23] to God for the community. I'm going to
[1:54:25] have to answer God for my family. I'm
[1:54:27] going to have God's called me as a man.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, can you say amen? But
[1:54:32] I I I think us men are a lot like this
[1:54:33] one right here. John 4:34, Jesus said
[1:54:36] unto them, "My meat is to do the will of
[1:54:39] him that sent me and to finish his
[1:54:43] work."
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Can Can I Can I Why don't us men, why
[1:54:46] don't you just raise a right hand to the
[1:54:48] Lord and say, "My meat
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; is to do the will of him that sent me
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; and to finish his work."
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; That's my That's my desire. I'm making
[1:54:58] that commitment to the Lord. I want to
[1:55:01] do the will of him that has sent me. Can
[1:55:04] you say amen? Amen. Second 2 second
[1:55:07] Timothy 2 and4. NO MAN THAT WARS
[1:55:10] ENTANGLE HIMSELF WITH the affairs OF
[1:55:13] THIS LIFE THAT HE MAY PLEASE him who had
[1:55:16] chosen him to be a soldier. AND IF A MAN
[1:55:19] ALSO STRIVE FOR THE MASTERIES YET HE IS
[1:55:22] NOT CROWNED EXCEPT HE STRIVE LAWFULLY.
[1:55:26] AMEN. A SOLDIER, A A LEADER, ONE THAT IS
[1:55:30] CALLED IS NOT GOING TO BE amen
[1:55:36] in ALL OF THIS JUNK THAT'S THAT'S
[1:55:38] INTERFERED TO where he is not sensitive
[1:55:41] to the THINGS OF GOD. THE POWER OF GOD
[1:55:44] IS NOT FLOWING. BROTHER, I KNOW IT'S
[1:55:47] HARD. I'M A MAN, TOO. But I'm telling
[1:55:49] you, if there's ever a time for us to do
[1:55:52] it,
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; today the day.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do you love him?
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; The call today, take courage.
[1:56:05] Take courage.
[1:56:07] Amen.
[1:56:08] Well, we strive to be worthy vessels of
[1:56:11] grace.
[1:56:14] Everyone in this assembly here this
[1:56:15] morning,
[1:56:20] every one of you are flawed.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; I'm flawed.
[1:56:25] You men are flawed.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; You women are flawed.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; And our children are flawed.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:36] But I I I I want to say here this
[1:56:38] morning that the blood of Jesus didn't
[1:56:40] come for anybody else but for the
[1:56:42] flawed.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; For the flawed sons and daughters.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Melzdc came to the flawed Abraham who
[1:56:49] could not produce. But Abraham had to
[1:56:52] believe it. Are you hearing me?
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; And when God looked at his report card,
[1:56:57] when God gave Abraham the report card
[1:56:59] there in Hebrews 11,
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; he said, "Abraham staggered not at the
[1:57:05] promises of God."
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; That makes you want to turn your head.
[1:57:09] Some of you ladies were to say, "Oh, I
[1:57:12] doubt if Sarah would say that.
[1:57:15] I doubt if Sarah would give him straight
[1:57:19] A's.
[1:57:21] But when God looked at him, God said a
[1:57:25] man or or or God says that he staggered
[1:57:29] not at the promises of God and he was
[1:57:31] imputed righteous and was called the
[1:57:34] friend of God.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Now brothers, if you want that kind OF A
[1:57:43] GRACE FOR YOURSELF FROM FROM those that
[1:57:44] are following you, you give that kind of
[1:57:46] grace to those that you're leading too.
[1:57:49] That's true.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; We lead in spite of our inadequacies and
[1:57:56] imperfections. None of God's earthly
[1:57:58] ministers
[1:57:59] are free from flaws.
[1:58:02] God's prophets did not fall from the
[1:58:04] sky.
[1:58:06] They were born from flawed human beings
[1:58:10] as flawed human beings.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Right? Right?
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; They were made up of men,
[1:58:19] mortal men, but on the inside of them,
[1:58:21] they had conviction.
[1:58:24] AND THEY WOULD STAND IN THE FACE OF
[1:58:26] LIONS FOR THAT CONVICTION.
[1:58:30] They would STAND IN THE FACE OF FURNACES
[1:58:33] for that conviction.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD STAND UP AT KINGS
[1:58:42] AND CURSE them
[1:58:45] because of their convictions.
[1:58:49] THEY WOULD STAND OUT. GOD ELEVATED THESE
[1:58:52] MEN.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; GOD PLACED CONVICTION ON THE INSIDE OF
[1:58:56] THESE FLAWED HUMAN beings
[1:59:00] to fulfill a purpose.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Every one of you men, whether whether or
[1:59:05] not Amen. I I'm I'm talking to you
[1:59:08] teenage young men, too. Every one of you
[1:59:11] young men,
[1:59:13] maybe in the light of my sermon here
[1:59:15] this morning, maybe you're feeling like
[1:59:16] maybe you need to you you feel like
[1:59:18] crawling under a bench or something.
[1:59:21] Hallelujah. And that's not what we want
[1:59:23] to do. God's not wanting us men to crawl
[1:59:25] under a bench. God's wanting us to get a
[1:59:27] little bit of conviction about us. God
[1:59:29] wants and first of all, conviction.
[1:59:31] Amen. Conviction is God is right and I'm
[1:59:34] wrong. God is always right and I'm
[1:59:36] always wrong. Conviction is is I'm going
[1:59:38] to bow
[1:59:40] beneath that cross and I'm going to let
[1:59:42] the blood of Jesus Christ, Amen, run
[1:59:44] over me and wash me, WASH MY MIND, WASH
[1:59:48] MY HEART, WASH THESE THINGS AWAY. OH,
[1:59:51] can you say amen? I I BELIEVE THAT'S
[1:59:53] WHAT WE NEED HERE THIS MORNING IS GOD
[1:59:55] LET US GO BACK TO AN OLDFASHIONED
[1:59:57] BAPTISM WHERE GOD WILL TAKE HIS SCRUB
[1:59:59] BRUSH AND BEGIN to wash our Well, I I
[2:00:02] believe I BELIEVE EVERY ONE OF US MEN
[2:00:04] YOU YOU'VE been a you you you've BEEN A
[2:00:07] EVEN YOU ELDERS, GOD CAN WASH YOU AND
[2:00:09] RENEW YOU, strengthen you again.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:19] Five-fold ministry
[2:00:21] is made up of men who need the blood of
[2:00:24] Jesus.
[2:00:27] The responsibility
[2:00:29] to being a father, to being a mother has
[2:00:32] been given to flawed human beings.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; But I can hear the commission
[2:00:40] to Joshua as Joshua is now going
[2:00:43] Joshua now is still having to do with
[2:00:46] Abraham. Now I'm I'm I'm fixing to shut
[2:00:48] up. Amen. But Abraham
[2:00:52] Abraham, the Bible says that God given
[2:00:54] him that promise that there's going to
[2:00:56] be 400 years in a strange land. Then
[2:00:58] he's going to bring them back out. Now
[2:01:00] Moses has brought them out. Now Joshua
[2:01:03] is leading them in the land and placing
[2:01:06] them.
[2:01:08] And and and here Joshua is looking at
[2:01:11] his humanity. His leader is not allowed
[2:01:14] to even go over into the promised land
[2:01:16] because of a decision his leader made.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; He had done seen a lot of
[2:01:24] a a lot of a lot of stuff happened.
[2:01:32] But you know what God tells him? Be
[2:01:35] strong there. There one Joshua 1 and7 I
[2:01:40] believe it is. Amen. Maybe one and six,
[2:01:42] but I think it's one and seven. Only be
[2:01:44] thou strong and very courageous,
[2:01:49] that thou mayest observe to do according
[2:01:51] to all the law which Moses my servant
[2:01:54] commanded thee. Turn not from it to the
[2:01:56] right hand or to the left that thou
[2:01:58] mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest.
[2:02:02] And the book, this book of the law shall
[2:02:04] not depart of thy mouth, out of thy
[2:02:06] mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein
[2:02:09] day and night. Thou shalt meditate
[2:02:12] therein day AND NIGHT. THOU SHALT
[2:02:14] meditate
[2:02:16] therein.
[2:02:19] Meditate
[2:02:25] is the therein. YouTube
[2:02:28] is the therein.
[2:02:33] Games
[2:02:36] is the therein.
[2:02:40] I'M TALKING ABOUT PARALYZED FAITH.
[2:02:46] Thou shalt meditate
[2:02:50] in my laws
[2:02:52] DAY AND night
[2:02:56] so THAT YOU CAN OBSERVE TO DO ALL THAT
[2:02:59] IS WRITTEN AND REQUIRED OF YOU.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; THAT THERE'S NO MEDITATING. THERE'S NO
[2:03:09] OBSERVING TO DO.
[2:03:12] I know I'm keeping you long, but
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; there's no meditating.
[2:03:18] Oh, THERE'S A LOT OF MEDITATING GOING ON
[2:03:20] BECAUSE SATAN HAS FOUND OUT HOW TO TAKE
[2:03:22] OUR MIND.
[2:03:33] Tell it's easy to just
[2:03:36] church ain't important. The body of
[2:03:38] Christ ain't important. This ain't
[2:03:41] important. That ain't important.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; And we fail to realize that that younger
[2:03:48] generation is watching our hypocritical
[2:03:50] lives.
[2:04:06] I want a responsibility.
[2:04:12] Put that back up, Sister Keys. And then
[2:04:14] now we're going to close now.
[2:04:16] This book of the law shall not depart
[2:04:18] out of thy mouth. But thou shalt
[2:04:20] meditate therein day and night, and thou
[2:04:22] shalt observe to do according to all
[2:04:23] that is written therein. For then shalt
[2:04:27] thou make thy way prosperous, and then
[2:04:32] thou shalt have good success.
[2:04:37] Have I not commanded thee? Be strong and
[2:04:40] of good courage.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; BE NOT AFRAID, NEITHER BE THOU DISMAYED.
[2:04:45] FOR THE LORD THY GOD is with thee,
[2:04:47] whethersoever thou goest.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; My burden this morning is I I've what
[2:05:03] I've done is I I've been looking I've
[2:05:06] been looking at
[2:05:10] the closeness of Abraham.
[2:05:14] It got me amazed as I as I've been
[2:05:16] studying through Hebrews and and I've
[2:05:19] you know we we've studied for over the
[2:05:21] years and things but as I've gone around
[2:05:24] it Abraham and Melzdc was all through
[2:05:26] it.
[2:05:28] It's all through it. Abraham
[2:05:31] there he is going through his battles
[2:05:33] but he's believing God. Melzdc is right
[2:05:35] there and it's going down it's going
[2:05:36] down this this priesthood
[2:05:40] and how that God is there. And so I then
[2:05:44] I looked up the words or you know when I
[2:05:46] when I was going back and looking at
[2:05:48] Abraham's life and says I'm going to I
[2:05:51] want to talk to you because I know you.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; We've got a relationship together.
[2:05:58] Can you say amen?
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Amen.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Now, now sisters,
[2:06:06] I I I I I want to tell you, your husband
[2:06:10] did not petition heaven
[2:06:13] to be a leader.
[2:06:17] That was God's job. Or that that was God
[2:06:19] that had that and decreed that in his
[2:06:21] mind. and his and he
[2:06:24] he's put every one of these men in your
[2:06:27] lives
[2:06:29] or you put that man in your life.
[2:06:36] Your man didn't ask for it.
[2:06:39] But if there's something that
[2:06:43] we know, I I know half this stuff that
[2:06:44] I'm preaching here this morning. I I am
[2:06:46] preaching uh under conviction. I believe
[2:06:49] the Lord is has been here to minister.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that it it's that I think
[2:06:54] everyone I as far as I know, we're all
[2:06:57] good people. Amen.
[2:07:02] But what if that man is struggling? What
[2:07:04] if that man is feeling like he's not
[2:07:07] what he needs to be?
[2:07:15] I say today
[2:07:20] to give him respect.
[2:07:28] I'm going to tell you this. I'm going to
[2:07:29] say give him respect even if he's not
[2:07:32] worthy of it.
[2:07:35] because
[2:07:37] he has he's under a respect the office
[2:07:41] because what I have found out is a lot
[2:07:42] there's a lot of people in counseling
[2:07:43] over the my
[2:07:45] 30 something years of pastoring
[2:07:48] is there's there's there there's always
[2:07:50] a reason not to respect your man.
[2:07:54] I found out there's a bunch of them.
[2:07:59] But we respect the office. It's the same
[2:08:01] way as the pastor.
[2:08:03] You don't might not always understand
[2:08:05] and agree with every decision made or
[2:08:08] every whatever else,
[2:08:11] but you do have to have respect for the
[2:08:13] office.
[2:08:16] And when I let you down, the office is
[2:08:20] not. That's God's call. Amen.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; And as it's a call of a leader to your
[2:08:31] family, it's a call.
[2:08:35] And many of times us men are not going
[2:08:38] to hit the mark.
[2:08:42] In fact, I would say most of us miss the
[2:08:45] mark. Amen.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; But my rally this morning is
[2:08:52] don't forsake your call.
[2:08:58] Don't
[2:09:01] forsake it.
[2:09:03] AND IF YOU GOT A GOOD MAN THAT'S
[2:09:06] PROVIDING FOR YOUR FAMILY, LOVING YOUR
[2:09:09] CHILDREN, YOU ought to love him and
[2:09:12] respect him.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:17] And then
[2:09:20] IF THERE'S EVER A time
[2:09:24] to get into prayer or consecration to
[2:09:26] God,
[2:09:27] I say today, let's get into let's get
[2:09:30] into that consecration to the Lord. Can
[2:09:34] you say amen?
[2:09:42] You say, "I'm not addicted to to my
[2:09:44] phones." I'm just going to talk to you
[2:09:45] men and you women need to listen to me,
[2:09:48] too. But I'm talking to you men.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Why don't you Why don't you do it for a
[2:09:53] week?
[2:09:54] Set your phone down.
[2:09:57] Look at your text.
[2:09:58] Unless you have for jobs or whatever,
[2:10:00] you know,
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; I would tell you to just lay it beside
[2:10:07] you three minutes and you'd have that
[2:10:09] thing picked up.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; It's a trick of the devil.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Am I old fogy?
[2:10:25] Am am I am I just getting to where I'm
[2:10:27] just I I can't I have I gotten to the
[2:10:29] point where I just can't fit in with
[2:10:31] modern times or is this still the gospel
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; is is I I KNOW IT'S SO OUT THERE. THIS
[2:10:41] MESSAGE IS SO OUT THERE THIS MORNING,
[2:10:44] BUT IT'S BIBLE.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you that that the
[2:10:52] inventor God is not the inventor of the
[2:10:55] internet.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; And neither was Al Gore.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; That's for you old people that remember
[2:11:03] Al Gore said he invented the internet.
[2:11:12] This online affair is so anti-God,
[2:11:15] anti-urch body, anti- family
[2:11:20] that a person can hide. Now, daddies, I
[2:11:23] want you to really catch this.
[2:11:26] Your children, mas and daddies too, can
[2:11:29] hide behind the computers and phones
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; and never come out from behind.
[2:11:37] The rich face-to-face interactions
[2:11:41] are replaced with the superficial online
[2:11:46] texting.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; The ease of digital communications have
[2:11:54] has
[2:11:56] dwarfed our minds
[2:11:59] until they are saying today. go uh uh
[2:12:04] they're saying today that the attention
[2:12:06] spans
[2:12:07] has has shrunk so much in in in the
[2:12:10] kids.
[2:12:13] I get these I get these tutorials
[2:12:17] and
[2:12:19] on on church media
[2:12:23] and they say you don't want
[2:12:27] you don't want just a camera on you that
[2:12:32] people's going to lose they're going to
[2:12:34] lose they're going to lose track of you
[2:12:37] within five minutes.
[2:12:40] So, what they try to tell you is you
[2:12:42] need all these cameras and it is just
[2:12:44] needs to be constantly going. That's the
[2:12:45] reason why they're moving. They change
[2:12:47] the lights. Uh, you know, one minute the
[2:12:49] backdrop is red and the next church
[2:12:52] service it's blue and it's, you know,
[2:12:54] it's whatever else. Well, they're the
[2:12:56] big wigs are telling them how to run
[2:12:58] their church services so people won't
[2:13:00] fall asleep on them.
[2:13:02] Maybe ought to try.
[2:13:10] But
[2:13:13] they say the attention span has so
[2:13:16] shrunk these days because of the YouTube
[2:13:19] and Facebook
[2:13:23] that this generation
[2:13:26] mindset minds are being trained so
[2:13:29] differently
[2:13:30] than what they were even 30 years ago.
[2:13:34] It's a it's it's a big study. It's it's
[2:13:36] quite a it's quite an interesting thing
[2:13:39] because everything's done online
[2:13:43] now and you don't you you're not just
[2:13:44] getting on your phone. You're not just
[2:13:46] getting on your phone and saying one
[2:13:47] thing. Now, if I come to visit you,
[2:13:49] Kaylee, if I visit you, you're stuck
[2:13:52] with me for two hours or whatever and
[2:13:53] we're just sitting there in the living
[2:13:54] room and trying to think of something
[2:13:56] else to say, right? You don't have to do
[2:13:58] that with your phones.
[2:14:01] Take the phone. You can
[2:14:04] you can you can be doing you can you can
[2:14:06] be texting three people and watching a
[2:14:07] movie at the same time. Hallelujah.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; You're con you're con you don't stay on
[2:14:14] the same deal. You're constantly moving
[2:14:15] from this shopping to this to this to
[2:14:17] this this. It's fast-paced. It's
[2:14:19] fast-paced.
[2:14:22] You can shop online.
[2:14:25] Your friends are online.
[2:14:28] Your hobbies are online. Your games are
[2:14:31] online
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; and you can do this all
[2:14:36] while working.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Don't know how
[2:14:44] but they say there's FOUR THINGS THAT
[2:14:46] ARE LOST.
[2:14:49] the non-verbal communications
[2:14:54] you have lost the nuanced body language
[2:14:59] the eye contact the vocal tones and the
[2:15:03] commitment required in relationships
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; you say why are we saying this because
[2:15:11] I'm saying we need some shepherds
[2:15:15] and I am saying
[2:15:19] there might be a wolf in your house
[2:15:23] with a child that smiling at you every
[2:15:25] morning.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Make sure we know our children and make
[2:15:30] sure we know what spirits.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; They say these four things are so
[2:15:44] crucial for understanding emotions.
[2:15:47] thus making in-person interactions
[2:15:49] harder.
[2:15:51] I'll just block you.
[2:15:54] There's no working things out in here
[2:15:58] in the here and now with the real people
[2:16:01] in your church, in your community, in
[2:16:03] your family. It's just you can just you
[2:16:05] can just block. And
[2:16:07] social media promotes the ability to
[2:16:09] disengage
[2:16:11] and abruptly
[2:16:13] in contact People
[2:16:18] have lost the ability to navigate
[2:16:20] through conflicts. It has made it easy
[2:16:22] to shut just shut others off
[2:16:25] by unfriending them, by blocking them
[2:16:27] from their social accounts, from their
[2:16:29] lives.
[2:16:31] But they say what it's done is it's made
[2:16:33] people less confident.
[2:16:36] The psychologists are saying people are
[2:16:39] less confident today
[2:16:43] because they're hiding now. They've got
[2:16:45] they've got a rage in them, but they
[2:16:48] don't have confidence.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; I want our I want us to stand in the in
[2:16:54] the power of the Holy Spirit.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? If the musicians would
[2:17:00] come.
[2:17:04] Oh God.
[2:17:09] Oh God.
[2:17:14] I know us all here. We all We're all
[2:17:16] God-fearing
[2:17:18] people.
[2:17:23] But don't you take for a minute that
[2:17:26] Satan don't want to kill every one of
[2:17:27] you.
[2:17:35] And here's the deal.
[2:17:37] The spoken word is the original seed.
[2:17:43] Mysteries open. Word has come back to
[2:17:45] us. If it lays dormant on a computer, it
[2:17:50] lays dormant on a phone. It lays dormant
[2:17:57] while we are down enjoying the pleasures
[2:17:59] of Sodom.
[2:18:01] The words of the son of man are not
[2:18:03] going to have the effect in our lives.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Let's take Sodom out.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Let's take these valuable
[2:18:22] God. Give me conviction for these words
[2:18:23] of life that have been restored to us
[2:18:25] this day.
[2:18:30] I'm not a saying that God's wanting us
[2:18:32] to all become nuns.
[2:18:38] Put oursel in a con.
[2:18:45] We're in the world. We're not of the
[2:18:47] world.
[2:18:48] We have to brush shoulders with those at
[2:18:51] school, those at work,
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; but we're not of them.
[2:18:59] When our heart becomes hardened like
[2:19:01] them
[2:19:04] until we can't look at our wife and say
[2:19:06] sorry, the wife can't look at the
[2:19:08] husband and say sorry.
[2:19:12] Then it's passed down to the next
[2:19:14] generation to the kids can't say sorry.
[2:19:17] Mamas can't say sorry to their children.
[2:19:23] Boys grew up hearing me say sorry.
[2:19:28] I was a flub.
[2:19:30] I am a flub.
[2:19:36] And I don't want anything
[2:19:39] in my flubbiness
[2:19:46] to distract them from the Christ of
[2:19:48] Calvary.
[2:19:51] I'm a mortal. I can fall, but I can also
[2:19:55] repent.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; I can say things that I shouldn't, but I
[2:20:02] want to say I'm sorry.
[2:20:08] I can act ways that I shouldn't and I
[2:20:10] want but I can also say sorry
[2:20:17] because we have
[2:20:19] without us
[2:20:22] without this body here who do we have
[2:20:24] without the body of Christ who do we
[2:20:26] have
[2:20:31] we're Yeah.
[2:20:39] Praise the Lord.
[2:20:43] Praise the Lord.
[2:20:49] I am nothing
[2:20:53] without you.
[2:21:01] Take
[2:21:07] it up.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; For I am not the street to pray.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; near enough.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; for I am nothing.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; I am nothing
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; without you.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:21:30] Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Oh take
[2:21:35] my voice.
[2:21:37] Yes Lord. Pour it out.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Let it see it all mercy.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; I have found
[2:21:50] my feet
[2:21:54] on your mercy.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Help me Jesus.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Help me Jesus. without
[2:22:00] you.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Oh
[2:22:06] my soul,
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; here your love
[2:22:18] to cover me.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus all
[2:22:26] we see. Oh Jesus that I am nothing
[2:22:33] help
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; without you.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; And take
[2:22:42] my body. Yes Lord.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; There God.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Build it up.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; May it be broken as an offering of love.
[2:22:58] I am nothing.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; I am nothing
[2:23:06] without you.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; We bless you, Lord. Oh
[2:23:14] my soul
[2:23:19] needs
[2:23:22] your love
[2:23:26] to cover me
[2:23:29] so
[2:23:33] help me see Jesus that I
[2:23:40] people
[2:23:42] without you. Oh, bless the people
[2:23:48] and take
[2:23:50] my life
[2:23:53] here on this earth
[2:23:57] and let it glorify
[2:24:01] all that you are worth.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; For I am nothing.
[2:24:10] I
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; without you
[2:24:20] and all my soul
[2:24:29] is your love
[2:24:33] to cover me.
[2:24:36] to all
[2:24:38] the world.
[2:24:41] We see
[2:24:45] that I am nothing
[2:24:49] without you.
[2:24:52] Take my life
[2:24:55] and take my life here on this earth.
[2:25:01] Here on this earth.
[2:25:05] Let it glorify
[2:25:08] all that you are worth.
[2:25:12] For I am nothing,
[2:25:16] Lord. I am nothing
[2:25:21] without you.
[2:25:24] Oh my soul,
[2:25:27] it all my soul.
[2:25:35] is
[2:25:37] your love
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; to cover me
[2:25:43] so all
[2:25:45] the world
[2:25:48] will see. Yes,
[2:25:51] that I am nothing
[2:25:56] without you.
[2:26:04] In the morning
[2:26:08] when I rise.
[2:26:12] In the morning
[2:26:16] when I rise.

[2:27:09] Oh, when I
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; feel alone, oh my.
[2:27:16] Oh, when I am alone.
[2:27:23] Oh,

[2:27:27] am the Lord, that's my prayer. Give me
[2:27:31] Jesus. Give me Jesus.
[2:27:39] Oh, give me Jesus.

[2:29:42] I'll have Jesus.
[2:29:50] I'll have Jesus.
[2:29:56] You
[2:29:58] can have
[2:30:00] all this world.
[2:30:05] I let you
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; when I lost my direction.
[2:30:20] You're the compass for my way.
[2:30:25] You're the fiery light. When nights
[2:30:28] alone get cold
[2:30:34] in sadness,
[2:30:36] you're the laughter
[2:30:39] that shatters all my fears.
[2:30:43] And when I'm alone, your hand is there
[2:30:47] to hold.
[2:30:51] Oh Jesus,
[2:30:54] you're the center of my joy.
[2:31:00] Oh, all that's good and perfect
[2:31:04] comes from you.
[2:31:09] You're the heart of my content.
[2:31:14] Oh, for all I do.
[2:31:18] Jesus,
[2:31:19] you're the center of my joy.
[2:31:23] Oh my.
[2:31:27] You are why I find pleasure in the
[2:31:31] simple things of life.
[2:31:34] You're the music in the meadow and the
[2:31:38] streets.
[2:31:43] Voices of the children.
[2:31:47] my family and my home.
[2:31:51] You're the source and finish of all my
[2:31:54] highest dreams.
[2:31:59] And Jesus,
[2:32:01] you're the center of my joy.
[2:32:08] All that's good and perfect
[2:32:12] comes from you.
[2:32:16] You're the heart of my content.
[2:32:21] Oh, for all I do.
[2:32:25] Jesus,
[2:32:26] you're the center of my joy. Once again
[2:32:30] now.
[2:32:32] And Jesus,
[2:32:34] you're the center of my joy.
[2:32:41] And all that's good and perfect.
[2:32:45] comes from you, Lord.
[2:32:49] And you're the heart of my content.
[2:32:54] Oh, for all I do.
[2:32:57] Jesus,
[2:32:59] you're the center of my joy.
[2:33:05] And Jesus,
[2:33:07] you're the center of my joy.
[2:33:14] All that's good and perfect
[2:33:18] comes from you.
[2:33:22] You're the heart of my content.
[2:33:27] Oh, for all I do.
[2:33:31] Jesus,
[2:33:32] you're the center of my joy.
[2:34:14] In moments
[2:34:17] like these,
[2:34:20] I sing out a song.
[2:34:27] I sing out a love song
[2:34:32] to Jesus
[2:34:38] in moments
[2:34:41] like these.
[2:34:44] I lift up
[2:34:47] my hands.
[2:34:50] I lift up
[2:34:53] my hands to
[2:34:56] the Lord.
[2:34:59] Seeking
[2:35:02] I
[2:35:05] love
[2:35:08] you.
[2:35:11] Seek
[2:35:13] him. I
[2:35:16] love
[2:35:19] you, Lord.
[2:35:22] Seek
[2:35:24] him. I
[2:35:28] love
[2:35:30] you,
[2:35:33] Lord.
[2:35:36] I
[2:35:39] love
[2:35:42] you.
[2:35:47] When I
[2:35:49] after sermons
[2:35:51] that are direct,
[2:35:54] any time that I come out of the
[2:35:56] anointing, I I feel like
[2:36:00] crawling under a rock somewhere.
[2:36:14] I love our church.
[2:36:18] I love every one of you.
[2:36:23] And I I hope that it didn't sound
[2:36:26] derogatory towards you sisters at all.
[2:36:32] I'm saying is
[2:36:35] the way God's built the lady,
[2:36:39] he's not called the lady to be the
[2:36:40] leader.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; He's just not called the lady to be the
[2:36:47] leader.
[2:36:50] God's called the man.
[2:36:57] And a woman is not to be directing that
[2:36:59] house. whatsoever
[2:37:03] leading the house.
[2:37:11] But that doesn't take the value away.
[2:37:19] I have the highest
[2:37:22] regard for every one of you sisters.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; I
[2:37:31] I do.
[2:37:38] But I know if there's going to be
[2:37:39] spirits that's cast out of a home, it's
[2:37:41] going to be a man that's going to have
[2:37:42] to stand up to his position.
[2:37:48] We want headship.
[2:37:51] We want headship.
[2:37:54] And the head of Christ is God. The head
[2:37:58] of man is Christ
[2:38:01] and the head of woman is man.
[2:38:07] God did not appear to Sarah because
[2:38:10] Sarah had no business talking to Abraham
[2:38:14] about any spiritual revelation.
[2:38:17] God appeared unto Abraham
[2:38:20] because Abraham had every responsibility
[2:38:23] to share it with Sarah.
[2:38:30] And he appeared to Abraham
[2:38:33] because he knew he would do it to the
[2:38:36] letter.
[2:38:40] I'm sharing it
[2:38:42] because he's the heir and he's going to
[2:38:45] direct his children and household after
[2:38:50] him.
[2:38:54] Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[2:38:59] Love every one of you.
[2:39:01] I love you, Lord.
[2:39:06] Singing
[2:39:09] I
[2:39:13] love you,
[2:39:17] Lord.
[2:39:20] God bless you. Now,
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; as our brother dismisses us
[2:39:29] in moments
[2:39:32] like these,
[2:39:35] I sing out.
[2:39:41] I sing out a love song.
[2:39:47] Jesus
[2:39:52] in moments
[2:39:54] like these
[2:39:57] I lift up my hands.
[2:40:03] I lift up my hands to
[2:40:08] the Lord.
[2:40:11] Seek
[2:40:13] it high.
[2:40:20] Oh,
[2:40:22] see
[2:40:24] it high.
[2:40:28] I love you, Lord.
[2:40:33] Deep
[2:40:35] in our
[2:40:38] love
[2:40:41] you,
[2:40:44] Lord.
[2:40:47] I
[2:40:49] love
[2:40:52] you.
[2:40:55] Deep
[2:40:56] in high
[2:41:00] love
[2:41:02] you, Lord.
[2:41:05] Seeking
[2:41:08] I
[2:41:11] love
[2:41:13] you, Lord.
[2:41:16] Speaking
[2:41:19] I
[2:41:21] love
[2:41:24] you,
[2:41:27] Lord.
[2:41:30] I
[2:41:32] love
[2:41:35] you
[2:41:40] in moments
[2:41:42] like this.
[2:41:47] Sing out song.
[2:41:51] I sing God
[2:41:54] loves
[2:41:57] Jesus.
[2:42:02] In moments
[2:42:04] like this,
[2:42:08] I
