know you can get parasites and and and all that kind of stuff out there and uh it it used to be in the foreign countries you used to have to worry about that but now you have to worry about it in the states too I guess because both of them have been have been uh both these evangelists been fighting in their uh digestive systems and so uh We're still praying for you uh Brother David and um so uh we but we are good really good to see brother John here on a Wednesday night amen uh it's but it's good to be here in the house of the Lord and and did you enjoy brother Nathaniel special tonight amen praise the Lord amen let's look here in the book of um uh or in the church age book at on page 169 and we're going to start down here at the one to the thir paragraph and um Hallelujah amen I'm already fighting Devils amen that's all right amen we come loaded for bear amen we'll cast The Devil out of the microphone amen praise the Lord um so we're we're wanting to deal with the word and the effect of the word I I I want us to um we're just going to look here at maybe maybe only read three of or four uh pages from the church age book and deal with those pages uh tonight um but we we we want to look here uh let's let's start here at the um the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of Our Lord it is the receiving of the truth for the day in which you live somebody say the re deceiving now remember we we just read uh uh I believe it was two Wednesday nights ago where it says only a special class amen can hear he that hath an ear brother brandom says that is a spiritual ear that is only given to the elect others it just can't they cannot hear it and so um and so here it is receiving amen we we don't want to just be hear we want to receive that word so that it can have an effect in our lives it says so it's the receiving of the word of the truth in which you live Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word The Works would follow that is Bible now Jesus knew there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in per uh pergan 8 age which was as yet 200 years off from the Pat's Vision he knew that drift would cause them to go into the Dark Ages he knew that the way man originally got away from God was by leaving the word if you leave the word you've left God thus he is presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages I am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive there's a difference in welcoming and receiving we got to welcome but then receiving is bringing it on down for myself it's one thing to say hello and another thing to receive you into my home amen so so we we don't want to say amen and and then the word still being separate we want that word becoming one with us that's the only way that the word of this generation will have any effect in our lives amen so if you want deity in your midst then you welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone get in between you and that word that which I am giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that yeah I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in jesus' name don't we we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in first John 5:14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know we have the petitions that we desired of him now we ask what is the will of God there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God Lamentations 3:37 who is he that saith and it cometh uh and it cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth it not there it is if it isn't the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word will you can't separate God and the word they are one now then this word he has left behind the printed page is part of him when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said that his word was life John 3 or 6 uh 663b but that is exactly what he is John 146 I am the way the truth and the life Romans 8 and9 be if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his there it is he is the spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man can someone shout hallelujah hallelujah if the church way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the Living Word you've heard me mention that many of times uh since we've been reading Living Word the logos not a letter living the spirit of the Bible Living Word in their midst the power of God would not have faded as it did in those Church ages and right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful Acts of God will be in her midst again one night I was seeking the Lord and the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write and I grasped the pen to write and his Spirit gave me a message for the church and I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride somebody say has to do with the word word and the bride now don't let that for don't don't put the word separate from you youen man that's the reason we had to have this word brought to us it's a uniting time we are in a marriage we have we are no longer courting we're no longer dating we are no longer amen the boyfriend in one house the girlfriend in another house the bride and the word has United together we are married we are producing children word children we're going to produce a Rapture and it's going to because be because of the Union between the bride and the word that's how we're going to produce these new bodies amen amen so here is what I'm I I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species uh brings forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 1:11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree uh yielding fruit after its whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into the fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone she will be a super Church a super race as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him they will be e they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God oh Hallelujah denominations cannot produce this it's the wrong seed they will produce their Creeds and their dogmas and mix with the word this monging brings forth a hybrid product the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself and that's why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to Die the second son Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was given a bride like as was Adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like Adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of God and live or doubt and die now live believe and live or doubt and die she doubted she left the word she died from a little group of the true seed of the word God will somebody say God will present Christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but the Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that had brought the uh her the message but the Angel's message was the word of God Isaiah 9 and6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her oh accepted his word to her the members of the Virgin bride will love him they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads notice the harmony of the father and son Jesus never did anything until till it was first showed him by the Father John 5:9 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again and here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what she wants what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while he was here in his Earthly Ministry uh so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride the work which he left for this specific time now how is this word going how is this bride going to fulfill it's got to be God's word in her manifesting in other words she becomes impregnated with that word amen now it was God him Jesus said you know the apost or brother Brandon was just saying it was God himself in Mary amen it was an angel that spoke it but he took the words of Isaiah 9:6 and placed them in the wombs of her mind and it dropped down into her heart not into her womb it would drop down into the womb of her mind and it came on down into her heart she accepted it and then God's creative word produced Jesus Christ can you say Amen now now there's got to be and I want to I I want to deal uh uh a few moments tonight we don't want that word to be circling this room tonight amen these the the words of God the words of that Prophet are circling the globe I don't want it to just be circling the globe I want to be a receptor to where that's that comes right down into my heart I want to see the Supernatural and the only way that I'm going to see the supernatural in me is for me to grab that and bring it down into my heart now Brothers there's only one way that you're going to do that it comes through the Mind first it comes through this mind here and there's where too many of us miss it this is why we miss our healing this is why we miss our Miracles is because when the healing presence of God is here we we accept other things in our mind and we marilize the word of God instead of saying I don't care what the doctor says I don't care what I feel I don't care what situation let me let me let me tell you friends amen if we're going to see the supernatural it's got to come out of here in here and down here and if we shut this off amen and if you have uh I I would encourage everyone to go back there amen and listen and and and listen to that uh the greatest battle ever fought and don't just try to listen to it all in one day but I I'm I I am saying listen to 30 minutes of it one day and then go and and and if you've got to go back and listen to that 30 minutes uh uh two or three days go back and listen to that amen and then when you do start start 15 minutes into the sermon and go another 30 minutes and and and just dissect that again and then and then start the I just it's going to be it it'll take you about as long as it is to do this church age book hallelujah amen but I want you to catch because brother Bram was in a he was in a rim when he was dealing with this it is a prophet telling you how he operates in that Supernatural real it was a prophet telling us sometimes we we we're wanting something real big and and big old huge thing to come but but he's letting us know that you've got to receive it right here right here and this is the carnal part of you amen this right here is the carinal part where you refuse well I don't feel good you're either going to have to refuse it or accept it you you're well well my children are you know are are lost you're either going to have to refuse it or accept it you're going to have to take God's word in every situation if we want to see the Supernatural how many wants to see the supernatural the only way it's going to happen is for the supernatural to get from here from here to here to here now I in the greatest battle I'm just going to read a little bit to you here it says one night what drew me to this conclusion here I was standing with brother wood and brother sofman and it was about 10:00 at night and I was looking towards the skies and and and and a great a came over me and I said just look all the great Heavenly Host I said everything is perfectly in harmony brother wood said looking at at at the two little stars so close together it made it look like a light and I said oh you know brother but brother wood according to science in that Dipper the Little Dipper and the Big Dipper those Stars don't look over 2 inches apart and they are farther away from each other than we are from them and if it would start towards to the Earth it would take at 1,000 M an hour it would take hundred and hundreds of years for them to reach the Earth and I said in all this great vast system yet they tell us that they look through the glasses can see 120 million years of light time away from there and there are still Moons and stars yet God made every one of them he sets in the midst of them and I said somewhere in there I I had pointed out to me one time in the obervatory the Zodiac beginning with the Virgin coming down through the cancer age on down uh until the last was the lion Leo the Lion the first coming of Christ by the Virgin the second coming of the Christ by the lion of the tribe of Judah I said I've tried my best to see the Zodiac but I can't see it but it's yet it's there and those who are trained can see it job saw it men who used to look it it it was a Bible at one day but in that whole great mass of millions and billions of light years God sits in the midst of it all and he looks down Paul is in there my mother's in there somewhere looking down I I thought of the order of of the heavenly host and how that none of them is out of place and every one of them keeps its time perfectly God's Great Army I thought of the soldiers how that if the moon would ever would happen to get out of order the Earth would be covered again with water in just a few minutes the Earth would be just as it was when God decided to use it to have us here on with uh without form and void and darkness and water up on the face of the Earth and and if that Moon would ever move it would do the same thing again rocks the moon rocks a little bit back from the earth and the tides come up when it goes down it it just follows the tithe it's God's Great Army and when I thought about this being God's Great Army we went to bed and I began to think that one that that not one of those get out of order they're all set in place and if there's a moving anywhere it's for a cause and will affect the earth I I I we we just see the results of it now for some of them moving into another spot and it's a fact and it's effect on everything and I thought then if that great Heavenly Host like like that has to keep its place to make everything in order how about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole things out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should con uh should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit I I would to God this morning that we could bring this down to a real healing service that we could keep this part this group that that we have gathered under the roof this morning in such a Harmony that the whole the Holy Spirit would place every member of the body here in such a Harmony till it would be such a spontaneous healing of soul and body if we'll just hold our positions now as I said the in the beginning this lady who had the cancer Dr Dr HRI was was going to take off that God the the god that caused the fluttering noise to come into the clinic and took this cancer without even leaving a scar don't you know the same Gods here the only thing he's waiting for is his arm Army to get to position like the stars to get to your position can you say Amen now brother brandham would say the church can never progress until it knows what grounds it's progressing on and to me this is what this church age book is so incredible for and and and the revelations of the Mysteries he says I believe that before anyone can ever move or have a real confidential Faith it's first they have to know where they stand and how to stand if they're going to make their stand I believe that's essential you cannot just uh uh you cannot just headlong plunge into something with faith when you don't know where you're plunging you've got to know if our faith is set right and in the right position it gives a constant satisfaction can you say Amen now as we as I was as I was reading the other night the last maybe it was the last service and I was and and and the Holy Spirit just settled down on that on that spot right when we we were reading that where brother where brother Brandon was saying you've got to make it yours you've got to believe it and receive it he says believing it is not enough receiving it well that that that that that done something to me I felt the Holy Spirit just settled down in the in the building and and you all noticed that too you could feel just a a real a real settl of the spirit of the Lord come down and and so as I've went back I it it it's it's really uh uh come to my mind and in my spirit and and I I I thought now how can we go from just amen believing it to receiving it and as I begin to look as some of y'all read on your quotes today Amen on the Mind brother brandham says it starts with the mind your mind has got to be as a man thinketh in his heart so is he the mind has to open it up in order for that word to become faith in the in in in and I'm going to be quoting a bunch from the the greatest battle ever fought he says now there's where the battle begins right in the mind now remember it's not Christian Science Now mind over Miner the mind accepts the life which is the word of God and there brings the life just your thought doesn't do it but the word of God brought through the channel of your thought so taking that word and meditating upon it he says he says now just your thought doesn't do it but the word of God brought through the channel of your mind it's not it's not the thought as Christian Science makes it mind over matter no that isn't it your mind accepts it and grasps it now what what is your mind controlled by your spirit or if he meant your soul and your soul catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it it brings life into you so your soul is the one that dominates your soul is the is the one that has the New Birth your soul is created in the image of God your spirit man is simply the nature of your body but that Spirit mind is your mind that's the one that's in between the body and the Soul it's the in between world it's what has to come in through here in order to get down to the soul so when you now whatever that desire is amen if you're a sinner you do your your your your mind is is roaming on girls pornography uh alcohol this that it is it is it is bringing other things through the filter of of your mind down into your soul to be satisfied when you're born again amen there is a cry for the supernatural there is a cry to overcome there is a cry to be what God created you to be Therefore your mind begins to reach out for those things you're you're now looking at the scripture and you're listening to the messages and you're you're coming to church and that mind is is your your your soul is bringing everything through the filter of your mind and you're now accepting truth and rejecting doubt you're now accepting healing and rejecting doctor's reports you are now you you see what I'm saying because your soul is is that is in the image of God is longing amen to express itself and the only way you can do that is bringing your mind under that control and brother brandham says those right thoughts will eventually bring your body right in line with it can you say Amen now he says it brings it in he says oh brother then what what takes place when life comes into uh down that channel into you the word of God is Manifest in you if you abide in me my words abide in you then you shall ask what you will and it will be done then what does that do from the middle of the heart amen and the so there it goes forth feeding every channel the trouble of it is we're standing in here with a lot of Doubt trying to accept what is out there you've got to stop that come down that Channel with the true word of God and then it goes out itself automatically it's what's on the inside that's the thing that counts is the inside can you say Amen now now he would say now he said well I don't steal or drink or don't do those kinds of things he said that has nothing to do with it amen there's got to be that hunger down on the inside now so I I want to deal with our mind for just a minute and this is where we miss it many times and I I just want to because I'm I'm not going to keep you long tonight but I want you to catch I want I want that word I want listen Malachi 4 is to bring us back to that word it's to rebuild the stones that were taken down amen but what good is the stones to be rebuilt if we're not worshiping at those stones if we're not worshiping at that altar revealed word has come we've got to make that revealed word ours now and the way it happens it's we we we miss it brother randam says when they when they applied the blood he says you were to take now this was an incredible thing this was the this was the time of The Exodus this was the time where Egypt where Egypt was fixing to lose their Hol as taskmasters were fixing to die this was this is the time that the first that the death angel was coming and and God says I want you to slay the lamb and I want you to apply the blood and he says I want you to take hup brother Bram says hup was just a common weed yes if was a weed you went out in the front yard and you plucked it up an old common weed and you took the blood of that precious lamb and you applied it over the doorpost and the Lin of the door your mind is an everyday thing but your mind is important it's what God is using to get down into your heart right when you're listening to those tapes if you ain't got your mind into those tapes those tapes do you no good right right if you're reading and you're just trying to read the Bible in a year and you're not really comprehending it's not coming it's just it's it's it's shutting off it's not getting down to here it's got to come through this mind and I'm going to give you a bunch of quotes on this all right and if you want to write some of them down I think they're I think they're powerful I sent some of them to y'all today amen he says the biggest part of our faith is mental Faith H by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of the word but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there is a Godly spiritual Faith then what does that Faith do that Faith recognizes only the word but he says it starts here hallelujah you know want to know what are the battles that fought I believe in healing and then tomorrow morning when you don't get when when you don't feel good or when things go you and all of a sudden you you're just your mind is just going this way and that way and no no no no no no no no either you believe this word or you don't and that word is either going to be the door brother brandom says you're either going to accept or reject whatever down into your heart can you say Amen another place he say say and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation upon this Foundation I'll build my church see not upon the mental conception of church joining a mental conception of that but upon the Revelation amen another place he says number one coming to you your mental Faith right here comes the Holy Spirit coming down into your mental Faith making it a spiritual Faith the spir spiritual Faith then only recognizes the word now you can understand why the Apostle Peter there in First Peter 1 and 13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind GT up don't let just anything come through your mind because it's going to affect God's word in you amen uh uh Proverbs 12:5 the thoughts of the right of the righteous are right there in Philippians 4 and 6 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God the peace of God which passes all understanding should keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally my brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things praise the Lord that's amen Still Still quoting from the greatest battle ever fought he says that word if you can ever get everything out of the way all of the conscience all senses and just let the word come in the word will produce just exactly here see what's covered o over with see uh see what it's covered over with it says well these consciences thoughts uh senses the so forth don't don't have anything to do with it brother brandom certainly it does now now once again amen now want you to read there I'm stuttering a little bit and now let me let me see if I can get it better the well these conscience which is thoughts and senses and so forth don't have anything to do with it brother brandom I believe I believe the Bible I believe the word that don't matter he says certainly it does but if you let the word come in and cover it with the conscience then it can't grow it'll be a deformed word so you've got the word coming but we're allowing the things and that's Hallelujah you allow things in your mind you allow that's that's the reason why again going back to the sports channels going back to whatsoever we put in our mind our phones the internet and things like that it hinders it clogs up and deforms can you say amen amen because remember as a man thinketh so is he now now brother uh brother brandham would say on still in the in the greatest battle he says you can have little consciences thoughts little feelings little Sensations and all these things has nothing to do with it that's just little Sensations things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friends God let none of them miss it see if your mind that that opens it's it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door I I I tell you do do you do you see how how letting your mind go crazy letting your mind go wild letting your mind dwell on things that it shouldn't dwell on Amen how it keeps you out of that Supernatural he says when it comes to the reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts or rejects it that's it friend don't let nothing in miss it it's it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and lets God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of that stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there is nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that that is the truth can I hear an amen amen we know that that is a truth another place he said what was the matter you had to open the Channel first you got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed in the Battlefront to take God's word and there's only one way to get the spirit out of the [Applause] Soul open the door and let the Holy Spirit the the mind's going to either keep the Holy Spirit locked up or it's going to open it up and say I'm going to let you have your way in my life amen you have to open the Channel first you got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit place at the front of the battle uh to take God's word he's the word he stands there there's nothing going to stop it every other channel is cleared out it's just like an old boiler when the flu is stopped up you put a fire it'll blow your thing up it says that's that's what's matter with so many blowed up Christians is because they don't clean the channels out they don't go down to the inside you've got to get it clean your conscience your memories your thoughts laying aside everything coming from the inside of that unadulterated word that it is the truth can you say am man when your mind opens up that door or closes that door listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to all to these things and let go God the spirit of his word come in it'll blow the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle that no sir he cannot battle against that can you say Amen so so now once again it's not that there's you're going to find all kinds of quotes we've heard it over and over you cannot be healed by mental faith brother Brandon say you just can't mental Faith does not heal you so you can't do it here but what brother brandom so what we do is we don't pay any attention to our thoughts we're not paying any attention to what we're listening to and the on the job we're not paying it's creating thoughts we're not paying any attention to to what we're looking at it's creating thoughts we're not paying attention to anything of those things but now remember it's got to come through that channel and lots of times a lot of this is shutting off that Faith down in our heart that can bring about that word that God's wanting brought about can you say Amen now he did say he says your intellectual Faith might believe it fine but unless the faith goes down into your heart your intellectual faith can accept it do that just keep believing it amen with all your heart until God does reveal it to you just keep believing it till God reveals it amen he even goes even goes to say this on on mental faith and I he says but I say tonight just closing I want to talk to you a moment and say this if you can't receive Faith to be healed instantly then you take the adopted baby root do do did you ever hear of the adopting of a baby he says if you take a young woman maybe she's married and she and her husband she's scared she isn't going to have a baby she wants one she's so scared she won't have it and she won't because just like job the things that I feared most has come upon me but you take that same woman now if there's doctors which probably sitting here by nurses you can take that same woman and let her adopt a baby and she will have one herself it quietens her and if you haven't got enough Faith to receive it right now as a miracle then take the adopted at baby attitude lord it's mine because you promised it I will go from here tonight praising you just the same as I was well watch what happens you'll receive it it has to happen God has promised it can you say Amen so he says if there's just one little speck of faith that you'll be all right you just believe it and go on thinking so he is saying that even even if it doesn't even come just supernaturally during a service train your thoughts to believe the word [Music] regardless train your thoughts to believe it amen can you say Amen now he says uh it's that's why many times I tell the people go on start praising the Lord because that's that adopted baby because it's their intellectual until it comes into their soul that they're healed then Faith makes it right you got to know what you're doing you've got to have confidence in what you're doing and that's the way it is with us sons of God it might not be just a supernatural lightning bolt coming down and saying you're healed or God's got your children or God's got your job situation or God's going to but you just go right on trusting him you train your mind and don't you let don't let that wandering mind go this way or that way or the other way you train that mind I'm going to bring everything in line right here amen keep that channel open because what we're looking for is to get out of this and drop it right on down into that Soul he says then God is your joy God is your strength knowing the message knowing the truth that it's our sufficiency now he is my all sufficiency in him all things I have need of is in him that's our strength My Help Cometh From The Lord you Christians Look to Him for your joy Look to Him for your strength Look to Him for your happiness he's my peace he's my joy he's my love he's my life that's a covenant and that is the token up on the door oh praise the name of the Lord what what what is it the message has come the message is in action in your life amen now now brother brandham would talk about amen he would talk about Mary and and and when that amen who knew the scriptures uh who else knew the scriptures that she was thinking you know and and and and when the word was coming to her he says she she never waited little Mary didn't she had to believe something that had never happened but look at her little childish heart I'm going to think her to be just a young woman about 18 20 years old she had never taken the the second thought but as soon as she seen and know that there was was an angel of the Lord and know these things and told her exactly according to the scripture that she had been thinking on and told her her name she knowed that the messenger came from God and the scripture that she had been thinking on was confirmed right there to her Mary the Holy Ghost will come upon you the almighty shall overshadow thee and that Holy thing that'll be born will be uh will not be of a man but it will be called The Son of God she threw her little hands up and tears running down her face and said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word she didn't wait till she was positive of this she didn't wait till she felt life some kind of a sensation to prove that she was a mother she just took the word and that was enough and when God wants you that's what God wants you to do tonight not wait till you feel better not wait till you can move your hand better or to to walk a good step nor to wait till the doctor says you're improving God but take God at his word and begin to believe it that's the only way to please him take his word that's the way Miracles are performed amen when God is took by his word the impossibilities Are Made Real and when God is took at his word not question but just get it in your mind be reverent you must respect that Holy Spirit only way you'll ever get anything from God is to respect his message can you say Amen now you say it's a lot of reading tonight well that is a lot of reading I but but I I you know I I what I what I wanted to do is that Harmony that we just read those those three uh uh pages that Harmony amen he shows her the word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her it's got this right here you you you you it's you've got to train this mind you got to you got to train that mind you say well brother wend we just don't believe in that that's that's Mind Over Matter brother Wendell that's just you're you're going to thinking you see it's the soul that is it's the word of God in this last day that is telling us listen that's what the Pentecostals are doing it don't matter what I what I do what I think it does it does this right here is so important and that's why Satan is battling so hard it's why you have your mind battles that's why you wake up sometime and you're just in a dark you you you you feel like you're in a dark room amen gloomy depressed it's the devil it's the devil that wants to get to your mind you can you can be all happy how many's ever been there where you're all happy and then it just seems like an invisible cloud is comes right over your mind and things get so gloomy and then that produces that chemical in your body amen and before you know it you were all energetic and now there's no energy and now you just want to go you just you're depressed you want to go hide in a room somewhere I've been there I I've been there and science science says that's a real thing when your mind amen something that what whatever you know what I can't I don't know all their definitions to it but it it it lets go that that that melatonin or whatever in in your body and before you know it amen you're just weary you're dreary an hour ago you were full of joy and a certain thought came in that you thought on and then all of a sudden it is just taken everything away from you you can reverse that come on you say I can't reverse it yes you can you can the Soul says I will look to the Lord I will look to the heels which cometh my I am a supernatural being amen again again brother brandham says amen he says the the the law of reproduction and and he's going whatever the life was in the seed is in this plant the very same law applies to the church whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed and in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to that headstone what is The Headstone it's the open book it's nothing else there is nothing else if you're expecting a Revival If You're Expecting brother brandom to raise from the dead if you're expecting anything else to happen then what has happened you're going to miss it the book is open [Music] well but I just don't feel I don't care what you feel like whatever life is in that church it says in these it says uh it says because it is the same seene in these last days the true bride Church Christ SE will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image what is his image predestinated to be conformed to the word that is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations can't produce that it's the wrong seed they produce Creeds and dogmas mixed with the word can you say amen he says the pro word The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that word was was he himself to be made manifest and when he when he says now who was he how did he do it when he says he himself well let me just read it to you amen God was made Manifest this is at the last bottom of the 171 God was made manifest he himself acted somebody say he himself acted at the time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin okay so you're wondering okay something great is going to happen something great then he tells us how it done it an angel brought her the message but the Angel's message was the word of God Isaiah 9 and6 okay all right having a hard time brother Wendell how's this Computing with me no angel has showed up to me what do you think that is on the angel came with this open book to you and you've got to accept it and believe it with everything within you you've got to accept this regardless amen you see what I'm saying see when he's saying he himself God himself came God how did God himself well he sent an angel and brought I and quoted Isaiah 9 and6 and that word was materialized in her womb I just want to say right now I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this narrow way for the comforter or something like that abides in me amen and that Harmony amen if you go down this one 171 or 172 and and the second paragraph notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first show of him the this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life again now we don't need a prophet we don't need an angel I'm not a prophet so I couldn't I'm Not Jesus was a prophet Jesus could hear God Jesus could see the Visions I'm not a prophet and I don't need an angel the Angel's already come to a prophet and the seventh angel messenger already brought that word and I'm here saying be it unto me you see that that oh isn't that beautiful you say well I I don't know what to do just pick up some weeds and start applying the token take it take that natural take that natural faith that you've got and just start amen just start painting that up there and saying I'm going to apply that token I'm believing for my children I'm believing for my healing I'm believing that God's going to do it I'm I'm in the Rapture I'm part of the Rapture I don't care what anybody else or anything else says amen I I thought about the um I you know I I've I I fought some depression in my life and so I know how it is when it gets dark I can I can I I can I can sympathize and pray for people that that have go because it's something that you cannot you cannot get away from when depression comes upon you there's just no there's no way to get out of it there's just no human possible way to get out of it you you can't think the right kind of thoughts enough you can't you just you it just gets in that dark room and and and you're just like you're just beating your head up against the wall sometimes it' feel better to beat your head up against the wall because Satan's got all those negative thoughts coming at you Satan's got all those things and it's just but now listen to me but I have also taken the word of the Lord and I've applied it to my life in those situations ations when that depression is coming around and I say no I refuse to think those thoughts those are and and I'll just start I

God right here starts speaking those words of life and it's like it's coming from the very lips of God and before you know it that that yuckiness that's in the pit of my gut begins to subside and that devil has to walk out and or he don't want to walk out but amen I drive him away because I'm a Son of God and the message has come to me and told me that I am in harmony the headship has came and it's not depression the headship has come and it's not sickness the headship has come it's the word hallelujah amen hallelujah amen all right any questions tonight pray praise the Lord amen I know I done a
