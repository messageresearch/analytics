in a revelation but to be the Revelation to be the Rapture can you say Amen to that I can say amen that's me can you say amen amen well what a wonderful time the meetings have been and brother Jonathan just he just outdone himself last night holy ghost got a hold of him foreign I believe brother Branham would be proud today of this five-fold ministry a man that is preaching this message and keeping it right exactly the way the spirit was intended it to be and um I I'm thankful for the ministry and I'm I you know what the the ministry is preaching to the cream of the crop amen we're preaching to God's very own bride and how blessed it is a man to to have a part in this great winding up of redemption amen well have you enjoyed yourself during these meetings so far praise the Lord amen well we're fixing to turn the man of God loose brother Sean Martin is going to be ministering this morning and um brother Sean doesn't need an introduction at least uh for for around these parts I uh brother Sean was was at the very beginning with with us here in Pawnee and has has labored with us for uh many years we man before we came into the message we used to carry a tent around and go go preach and we helped many Street meetings we we um uh brother Sean and I uh were were just hand in glove with one another um we preached all over Canada and up to the tribes and a way up North we we just done everything uh everything we've done together and um so uh when somebody had given us the adoption series some tapes Iman we we sat there and listened to those messages and we'd both sat there in the living room and and just cry as we're listening to the prophet of God saying there's more to this there's more to it you've got the Holy Ghost but there's more to it and we would sit there and just weep and and listen to these tapes and and so the lord gave us the revelation of this message we grew together and we fought together we we have overcome together and so it is it is a wonderful privilege to have my brother brother Sean Martin to minister for us here this morning and I know that you will be blessed uh Great Men of God and so we just want to amen now I know we can get a little bit tired these these morning Services can be a little a man can be a little bit slow but how many believes that God is still God thank you and I I just want to tell you if you've got a poll this morning the holy spirit is still here to meet that need can you say man amen and we're going to sing that song again pour your Spirit out I want more of you this morning oh yeah saturate my

just a a few moments and uh like to um just say that we're we're always delighted to be here and call me Amen to come home amen and see uh not just uh well uh natural family but also to see the family of God that the people of Lord here in Pawnee and we certainly love and appreciate you very much and we want to thank brother Wendell and sister Fresca the hospitality they have shown a man is just been over the top I tell you what he's uh whether they praise the Lord amen the the uh the place they put us up in is just incredible and but we really appreciate that very much and I I want to just thank the congregation here in at New Life as well for your labor of love amen and uh just some fine cooking as always amen and uh it's just hard for a God to stay skinny uh when you come to the meetings you know and and uh so uh but we just everything I um just watching the brothers and the sisters you know you uh you can't we we have a meeting every year of course and and the Lord has blessed me with a congregation that that works just just you know you you can't do it on your own and uh thought many times of Moses that God gave Moses The Vision on how to build the Tabernacle but he also gave Moses people Amen to carry on that vision and anointed them and gave them the spirit of wisdom and and I have uh I have seen that here time and again at the people here and uh that have the vision as brother Wendell has and working and together and I say God bless you God bless you very much we um uh you know it's hard to find good faithful people these days and but when you got them God bless you and uh uh I tell you what Paul knee is a uh this church is a is a lighthouse to Pony and we've got the greatest message on the face of the Earth and God established this church I believe in and uh and have sent people here to work uh under the vision and and we thank the Lord for that I appreciate these uh musicians amen [Applause] amen musicians they make the service as well and uh create an atmosphere and and to think that we used to be there you know and uh uh playing music and now you got these young people playing and my goodness and so God bless you that you had lend your talent to the Lord to this message amen and we just love the Lord and um seinfold from my wife and my children being here today and able to come in these meetings and as any Pastor knows your family they they know all your ins and outs and uh but to have them to not just be it there but to be pillars in the church and and uh appreciate them I appreciate the the ministry a man that here and and been able to share a meeting together with such men as as are here and I sure love them dearly and uh all uh have just been an inspiration to me and and in my Ministry and we love them very much and the services I've been building I've enjoyed them and tell you what uh I felt sorry for myself every night I thought well I thought I thought when to like me you know and and uh he'd put me on the first night and then you know brother Daryl preached and I'm thinking oh Lord you know I got to come after that one then brother Manuel now I got to come up and then last night I just just cried and just blew my nose and just cried you know and but here we are today and uh not much of a Preacher but we uh love to talk about the Lord and I love this message amen so let's just stand to our feet and we'll just get right on into the word and just pray the Lord will help us and to say something that would edify you amen but first of all we want to turn to the Book of Mark the eighth chapter amen The Book of Mark the eighth chapter praise the Lord when you're there Say Amen sounds like most so it says whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words and this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels amen then if you'll turn with me the uh The Book of Matthew the 16th chapter The Book of Matthew the 16th chapter the 27th verse says for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works amen one more scripture if you'll turn with me to the Book of Psalms the 34th chapter amen we're going to read um the fifth verse they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed amen may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord Lord Jesus we come as your children this morning we're so thankful Lord of what you have done Lord in the meetings Lord and helping your people father I believe you later on brother Wendell's hard as the pastor Lord to have these meetings and so you could come and meet with us Lord and then you could do a work and father I pray that you would just help me to get myself out of the way and that you could anoint the gift that you placed Within Me and Lord that you would anoint your people anoint their ears to hear and their hearts to understand and father may you would have the preeminence in this place this morning to walk the aisles Lord and as your Prophet even prayed one time that the angels of God would just come and take their position around each pew may you do it this morning Father oh Father we commit this service into your hands Lord these are your people your blood bought your redeemed you thought of them Lord more than your own life father Lord you gave your blood for them oh Father we just love you and we thank you for what you're going to do in Jesus Christ's name and the church says a man and a man you can have your seats this morning and I I just have a a simple thought and um this morning and and trust that it will be a a blessing to you um uh here but my title if if I would have one is they were not ashamed uh when they looked and it has already been said uh that that God allotted a portion of his word to to each age and God could do that by his foreknowledge and uh you see he has an infinite mind and so he knows the end from the beginning therefore he could declare what will be before it ever happens ain't that right and then and and to be honest this is the Bible is it's a book of History it's it's a book of songs it's it's a book of of love it's a book of poetry but it it in all of it it's a book of Prophecy it's foretelling of something even though you look at the Bible and you can say well that event happened but if you could look at really what's going on it's telling of what will happen and what will be and so uh God God uh could predestinate by his foreknowledge certain things to happen at certain times and not only that but he he predestinated a certain group of people for the age to fulfill his word and so brother Branham would tell us in order to have Believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age he said did you get it did you feel it did you see it do you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated it to this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated in Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and he predestinates anything in his word he had to prove his word to be so when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen he knows everybody say he knows he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride she's going to be there there's going to be a Rapture she's going to be there she's predestinated it by his or he's predestinated it by his foreknowledge and there's nothing going to stop it aren't you glad for that there's there's nothing that that is going to stop it in another place he says if you're a Son of God or a daughter of God you were in God all the time see but he knew what bed and time that you would be planted so now you're made a creature a Son of God manifested son or a daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time can you say Amen so if I could say it uh paraphrases brother Manuel had said the other night we are the actors a man fulfilling the word for this day and age do you believe that amen we're not just here floating along we're not just here as an accident but God in his script amen planted us here for this age to act out his word for this day and if you really want to say it he's the actor a man that is coming into the vessels of of of this body right here amen it's Christ in you ain't that rhyme a man see so because the seals have been loosed and the book has been opened and revealed to us well we see what scriptures are applicable to us for our day aren't you glad you can look at the Bible and and apply the scriptures and apply yourself to them scriptures for the day that we lived in you know we before we come into the message we read the Bible but we didn't understand it we didn't know how to play scriptures and and and and and we would look at these things we would look at the stories and yet we wouldn't know how to apply it for the day and age but thank God for the lamb coming and opened the book A man that we could see amen what is to take place and so we know in this age by God's grace we know amen what scriptures a man pertained to us and that we have been predestinated to fulfill now I believe a man that God foretold of our day in our opening scriptures he foretold of Christ being revealed and also foretold of a people looking unto him and not being ashamed a man that when he would be revealed there would be a group of people a man that would look and would not be embarrassed and be ashamed ain't that right now you know the word ashamed is mentioned in these scriptures and and so um which in in my thoughts of it it gives the impression that there's going to be the majority of people that will be ashamed a man that will amen but but God would want to solidify in the scriptures a man that I've got a People reserved in that age that that will not be ashamed and he declared that they would not be ashamed amen and I'm not ashamed because the scriptures has already declared that I I see myself in the word do you see yourself in the Lord word we're not ashamed I'm not ashamed to say that God sent a prophet in this age I'm not ashamed to say that I'm going in a Rapture I I've been revealed in this age I'm not ashamed to quote quotes I'm I'm not ashamed to to shout amen because the lamb has opened the book I'm I'm not ashamed can you say amen amen yes sir see and and so uh it's already written that there will be a people who will look unto him and not be ashamed amen and you know what Paul mentions that group of people they are the ones who love his appearing and well do you do you love his appearing amen they love his appearing amen now this word is shame the prophet amen gives us the meaning of what ashamed means it means embarrass in other words you're faced with something that you're embarrassed about it's like Simeon you know uh he invited Jesus to his uh I believe it was Simeon or Simon invited Jesus to his party ain't that right amen but as we know in the scriptures and the prophet actually speaks about it and said several places there that that Jesus entered in unnoticed and he he was left in the corner with dirty feet and it was because salmon amen even though he had invited him was embarrassed of him he was ashamed of him ain't that right amen and God forbid that we would be ashamed amen of our Lord Jesus Christ God would have forbid that we would be ashamed and embarrassed to worship God Amen is can you say amen amen we we even look at Esau that had the birthright and the prophet said he was ashamed of that Birthright he was embarrassed of that Birthright and therefore he despised it amen that's right and the prophet said he represents the carnal believer of today amen but there was a man that wasn't ashamed and that was Moses amen when he looked at the people of God he wasn't ashamed and a man to suffer Affliction with them it didn't embarrass him to be refused to refuse to be called a man Pharaoh's uh uh the son of Pharaoh's daughter amen it didn't embarrass him or uh to be to to esteem the the reproach of Christ as the greater riches than the treasures of of of Egypt amen it it he wasn't ashamed Amen to forsake Egypt can you say amen amen the word ashamed also means that it shows that you're not sure of what you're talking about can you say amen I find a lot of people don't want to talk about the message to others and and and and just to be honest they're ashamed of it is because they don't they're not sure of what they're talking about people that are not sure that the seventh seal is open they won't preach it they won't talk about it if they're not sure that the lamb has come and opened the book they won't talk about it they don't want to preach it they want to just ignore it can you say Amen if they're not sure that this message is the absolute they they won't quote the quotes they'll say oh we need to get them to Jesus instead of the message amen they don't understand see that the message is Christ you you can't separate this message from Christ ain't that right amen see we're not ashamed to say that I'm not embarrassed to say that because I know what I'm talking about amen that's right see so so brother Branham said see if you know what you're talking about and have the assurance that you know what you're talking about you can tell everybody that see you're not ashamed but if you feel out of place it shows you're not sure it shows you're not sure if you're embarrassed about it so you'd rather not discuss the subject can you say amen amen well the prophet said if you're going to be ashamed or embarrassed of it you would want to hold back and not discuss said ain't that right but I I look at some wise men in the New Testament that looked and they saw a star amen and they weren't embarrassed about what they saw they weren't ashamed in what they saw they knew what it was all about they they knew amen that something on Earth was about to happen amen and they left everything they had to follow the star because they weren't embarrassed of it amen and they went to the critics and they went to the scoffers and they began to ask where is it where is the king of the Jew where is the king can you say Amen they went to the church and nobody would talk about it the amen they wouldn't because they didn't know they didn't know what they were talking about but there were some people on the Earth that would declare amen that he was on the earth because they looked and saw and knew what they were talking about amen I thought of John the Baptist he wasn't ashamed of his sermon he was ashamed you declare that the Lamb of God Amen was in their presence he had looked amen and he saw and he knew who he was and he wasn't ashamed to tell the people Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world now Psalms 34 again it says they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed now another scripture amen that I believe is applicable to our day and foretold of our day is Isaiah 45 and 22 God says look unto me everybody say look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else ain't that right amen see so he is to be revealed at the ends of the Earth amen and we are commanded to look amen and not be ashamed to look and not be ashamed and be saved ain't that right amen so so we look now I'm not ashamed to say a man that that scripture uh there in Psalms ties with Luke 17 and 30. amen it's the revealing of the son of man can you say Amen I'm not ashamed to say that that Isaiah the one that we just read there in in in uh uh 45 22 is tied to the revealing of the son of man in Luke 17 30. amen see and God would tell us look unto me and be ye saved ain't that right amen at the time of the revealing it's time to look not at a denomination not at a preacher not at a personality not at a Doctrine not at this and not at that not at that it's in the time of the revealing that you must look because there's no salvation in looking in a denomination there is no salvation in looking at a preacher there is no salvation can you say amen and I'll say this there's no salvation in looking at a prophet amen you've got to look at what the prophet brought us and what he revealed in this age can you say amen amen that's right look unto me and be ye saved people are looking for salvation today they're looking for well I don't want to get overhead of myself but but I will tell you this not everybody is going to see him for Jesus already said the world will no longer see me but you will see me you will see me can you say Amen aren't you glad for that amen see not everybody believed that Jesus was the Christ when he walked the Earth the prophet said they tried to throw them Shadows on the name of Jesus and on Jesus to get it before the people I think that's what people are doing today they're trying to show throw Shadows Amen on this message amen they're trying to throw amen sayings Amen to Blind the people amen from the real truth of this message can you say Amen this message is not legalism this message ain't legalism this message isn't to bind you to a preacher this message isn't to bind you into what you can't lift up your hands and praise the name of the Lord amen they're doing exactly amen the way they done it back then amen they tried to throw amen the baggage on the name of Jesus they tried to destroy the name of Jesus they tried to Blind the people from The Name of Jesus but to those who were predestinated to see him and to know his ministry there he was can you say Amen well that's what the prophet said there was a people that would not be blinded they would not take amen anything else because they saw who he was they were predestinated to see him and to know his ministry now brother Branham said no matter if he ever opened his mouth about anything they knew he was they knew he was I don't care if they keep saying well that was brother Brandon's opinion I don't give a hoot I know what he was I know what this message is about you ain't going to take this message from me you ain't gonna get me to disbelieve this message you ain't gonna get me to dissect this message this message is a Rapture this message is the truth this message is right can you say amen and it's not because I say so God said so and if God is bold enough to say this is right I'm bold enough to say this is right if God wasn't ashamed to declare amen say I'm behind this message then I'm not ashamed to say I'm behind this message I'll preach this message I'll quote this message I'll read this message I'll teach this message I'll eat this message up amen because it's my life they looked upon him and we're not ashamed the woman with the issue of blood wasn't to shame to say if I can just but Touch the Hem of His Garment I know I shall be whole Martha wasn't ashamed to say Lord if thou hadest been here my brother had not died but I know I know even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it to thee she was not ashamed can you say Amen the Centurion man wasn't embarrassed was not a shame Amen to approach him and say just speak the word and my servant shall live amen that little lady that prostitute wasn't ashamed Amen to go in the middle of all of the critics amen she had no position there she had no place there she had no right there hey remember she wasn't embarrassed she wasn't ashamed Amen to foul at the feet of Jesus and begin to wash his feet with her very tear amen and to dry his feet with her very hair amen somebody is going to entertain him because they're not ashamed somebody is going to get what they need because they're not ashamed he's standing here his presence is here and somebody is going to get victory is going to get delivered is going in a router because they're not ashamed Glory God said look unto me and be saved the word save means to be free to be delivered rescued to get victory to be saved look unto me and be delivered look unto me and be free Church we're the most freest people on the face of this Earth no we're not waiting to get to heaven to be free we're free there is no devil in hell that can bind us we are a people that the devil don't know what to do with amen it's because we've looked amen we've looked at something and we found salvation I am free by the name of Jesus Christ I am free to lift up holy hands I am free to say Satan get thee behind me I've been delivered I've been set free I'm not worried about a rat a tribulation I'm not worried about what the the economy is going to do I looked and I found salvation in this message we're living they have a church we're living at the ends of the Earth time has come to its end politics has come to its end church annity has come to its end the Nations have come to its end corruption and Mortal life has come to its end the church ages and denominational ages have run out I want you young people to understand now why God would send a message amen the time has come amen time is no more can you say man nations are against Nations because time has come to its end for them amen the politicians are loony because time has come to its end for them the economy is rocking and rolling amen because time is no more for it this civilization is shot because time has run out [Applause] so the salvation that is to come by looking unto him listen now we're told to look unto him look unto me all yens of the Earth amen so the the Salvation that is to come by looking unto him is the greater salvation than just a man coming to the Altar and claiming to be saved it's a greater salvation amen than a man receiving amen he is healing from a physical Affliction in his body can you say amen amen because now look here's another scripture that is applicable to our day Jesus said in Luke 17 26 as it was in the days of Noah so shall also be in the days of the son of man can you say Amen in a time that the son of man is revealed it'll be just exactly like it was in the days of Noah ain't that right now just just bear with me now but in the days of Noah the world had come to its first 2000 years and brother Brown said every two thousand years the world comes to its End Amen there's an end to something amen ain't that right he says every two thousand years the world has come to the end of its World System religious system to the end of all systems and God had to step in ain't that right so in the days of Noah see it had come to its 2000 years and now God was going to bring an end amen and his wrath was fixing to be poured out upon the people and upon the Earth and all everybody say all was going to perish amen but there was an elect amen man that God had in his thinking amen and so therefore God provided a way of Escape for those who wanted to escape the judgments of God aren't you glad that God is rich in Mercy I'll say it this way God's sending them a prophet and that day was Grace to the elect God sending a message in that day was Grace to the elect and all I can tell you is God sending a prophet in this day his grace to you amen the message is raised to you don't you let them turn this into legalism don't you let them turn this into psychology it's the race of God Amen to you amen for those who need a way of Escape God sent a prophet on the earth to forewarn the people of judgment but notice what the prophet also done he prepared an ark he wasn't just one that would say well there's coming a storm there's coming rain there's coming a flood the Earth is at its end everything's added in everybody's going to perish amen the message also prepared an ark see God's art the ark was God's provided way so the prophet of God not only declaring judgment he introduced The Ark to the people aren't you glad for that amen and those that got in the ark would be taken from the old world into the new world Amen that's right see and Not only was the prophet Noah predestinated to preach the message in his day but the ark was predestinated to be there in that day amen to carry the elect amen over into the new land amen it was predestinated oh can you say Amen it's all I can tell you is get in the thing that's predestinated [Applause] something's predestinated to work politics ain't working marriage seminars ain't working Bible schools ain't working denominations ain't working amen and the world don't know what to do but God's got something that's going to work he's already predestinated it it's going to work amen and you are the people that are predestinated to get in the ark amen the thing that's going to work to take you away from this troubled world you see we are at the end of 6 000 years it's come to an end again can you say man and every one of us knows that the wrath of God is upon the Earth and it's it's coming worse and the Bible already says amen that the hot men's Hearts would fail them for fear for looking upon those things that are to come and the people are as hearts are there's no there is a such a spirit has never been before of a spirit of anxiety that has gripped the people in this age people are troubled people are in insane people are losing it families are falling apart homeland's falling apart marriages are falling apart but you're not that statistic God's prepared God's prepared can you say amen amen every one of them that Moses said that Noah was preaching to the majority of them were going through the floods amen but there was an elect that God knew amen that would not be destroyed amen they would get in that Ark [Applause] you realize that this is the only time this is the only time that the mighty Angel has come down and it set his foot both on land and sea and has declared that time shall be no more it didn't do it in Noah's day but you would see what it was it was an End Amen it didn't do it in Jesus day but we see it was an end a dispensational law into Grace ain't that right but it's in this day that we're at the ends ends of the Earth and what has made it not just an end of an age not just the end of a of a message but it's the ends of the Earth amen everything is coming to its end because a mighty Angel has put his foot on land and sea amen if you really could understand what 1963 was all about amen right there amen it was an angel putting his foot on the land putting his feet on the sea he was the Overcomer and you're putting you're part of the body amen you're nowhere's Elsa but you're up on the land in the sea if I could put it that way yeah amen you're conquering you're an overcomer amen but he declares something time shall be no more [Applause] all right now notice what the prophet said we're we're ending everybody say we're ending the seventh Church h the church age the Pentecostal age oh so what do we do now is there an eighth ages or the eighth messenger is there an eighth people is there whatever what what where are we at he said we're entering that Holy convocation can you say amen amen a prophet not only is preaching amen the flashing signs of the red light amen amen but now he's saying we're entering amen he's not preaching uh Doom and Gloom to all people he's looking at a people and said now we're entering into a holy convocation now you know what the holy convocation is that's the eighth day it's an eternal age it has nothing to do with time it has nothing to do amen was here upon the Earth amen you are now going back to what was in God's mind at the foundation of the world that Eternal thought about you that Eternal representation about you amen that's where you're headed to we're entering back into what God had already thought all right the new day new day ain't they speaks of Eternity can you say Amen you see in this age in this time in time we are sons of Adam amen we're finding out we're more than sons of Adam we're sons of God [Applause] can you say amen and I'll set this way there's never been an age like this age for the time for the sons of God to be manifested outside of this time oh that's what a prophet said so you can deal it with him amen but he says when has there ever been another time outside of this time amen that the sons of God were to be manifested outside this time right now can you say Amen think of it young people think of it you're living in the time for you not to manifest yourself as the genealogy of I know a lot of folks are going back to wanting to know their genealogy and where they come from all that that a prophet told you of a greater genealogy he told you you were in the mind of God Amen you are sons of God oh praise the name of the Lord I've identified myself not as the son of Duran Martin amen I don't care about the genealogy about my past in my pastors nothing about me that's good I remember there is a representation I am an eternal Son of God we're entering into that Holy convocation you know what that means it's we're all things everybody say all things become new a new Heaven A New Earth a new city a new people a new people No More Tears I knew people no more sadness I knew people a new civilization Donald Trump ain't gonna control this one Biden ain't going to control this one it ain't gonna be a Democrat versus Republican and versus independent and it ain't going to be Russia American Canadian or whatever amen this is a new contract this is a new city amen and the lamb will be the light thereof and believe it or not we already worshiping the king City we have already saw the city or the king of that City we've already seen that King Melchizedek in demonstration in this age and we're not ashamed to say it now I hope I'm not too scattered but it's a new kingdom it's going to be a new government then you say man the prophet said we are entering into that real genuine eternity where the church is called not to some station or some denomination but into eternity with their Eternal King no voting him out and no voting you out the prophet already said there's no one can take your place [Music] not ashamed to say that we're living in the age of rapture this is the age where the dead in Christ is going to rise first and we which are alive and remain are going to be caught up to meet them to meet the Lord in the air this is the age where we are all going to be changed in a moment in twinkling of an eye you see this salvation is a change from Mortal to immortality it's a change from corruption to incorruption it's a change from the Earthly to the Heavenly it's a change from destruction and turmoil to Eternal peace amen what is it it's a full restoration are you with me you're following see it's a full restoration what Adam lost we are redeemed back to see this layout of CNA Church age is the age of restoration the prophet said it is also the age of complete uh blackout in apostasy it's the age of apostasy it's the age of the finished cycle with this it's all over then you say man do you understand you know I I've I've you know I've I've heard you know some preachers say you know they get on they just bad mouth message folks is saying that they're they're they're just stuck up they're you know they they high and mighty and this and that and this and that well I'm going to take up for him it's it's it's not that they're high and mighty they're just not as vulnerable as we used to be when we were in Pentecost when someone had a vision we and we followed when someone had a dream we followed when someone said they had a word from the Lord we were just so vulnerable and we just gulped it up amen we were gullible people but we have seen him can you say man we have seen him and we realize God ain't raising up another personality God ain't raising up another Ministry for us all together amen we don't have together in Jeffersonville to be in a rapture we don't have to gather in in Tucson to be in a rapture we don't have to gather eight men in Virginia or in Paul need to be in a Rapture can you say amen God is now coming and bringing us together to take us home then you say man it's a finished cycle hello it ain't your cycle after cycle after cycle it's not a repeat of what lives this is a change this is something new God God has a provided way in this day as he did in the days of Noah notice God had his Prophet know what to identify his promised word and the Ark was very fitting to the word of God that he spoke that he would destroy man but he saved what he could you say amen and God has an ark today do you believe that God's got an art today and I say it this way it's very fitting to the word of the age that has been spoken for this age now the prophet Noah pointed the people to a natural Ark but you know there were a lot of boats the prophet tells us there was a lot of boats being built amen and and they probably looked more promising than the one that Noah was building can you say Amen but see God's Prophet only pointed to one boat to one boat to one boat can you say man and that was the ark ain't that right so I'll say it this way there was no confusion about Noah's message amen it was just plain and simple get in the ark this is the one that's going to ride I believe with all my heart that Noah saw the vision of that Ark riding above the storms amen I just believe that he just was known in his heart amen that that God would show him know what don't be scared to build this art don't be afraid afraid to preach this art don't question this art don't don't just be assured and here's why Noah I'll show you and he saw the Ark of floating above all the storms he saw the Ark of floating can you say Amen oh yes sir amen see but do you you find amen that in this age amen we had a prophet in this age and and there's no confusion about his message amen it's the people it's the preachers that bring confusion amen whether we should have a five-fold minutes whether we should have just played tapes or whether we should do this or whether we should do that just say what the prophet said about it amen and you don't have to worry about it at all amen but he did not Point Amen to a natural Ark he pointed to another heart attack and that Ark is Jesus Christ [Applause] he introduced Jesus Christ to you and I then you say Amen now I'll say it this way the Christ that he introduced isn't the same that the Baptist and the Pentecostals and apostolics and methodists and denominations and most Independents are pointing us to they've introduced to Jesus Christ for years that wasn't the right Christ amen but in this day Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever has been introduced to us again can you say Amen so we find that the ark was the answer in Noah's day but Christ is the answer in this day look unto me and live ain't that right well can a person escape the wrath of God that's coming upon the Earth yes can a man live forever and ever yes can a man stand in the presence of God and not be condemned yes can a person actually be forgiven of their sins to where God doesn't remember them yes can you say Amen can a person actually live in a place where there's no sin and there's no sickness and there's no siren there's no loneliness and there's no trial and there's no Temptations oh yes amen Christ is the answer look unto me and be ye saved now if we are to look unto him then where do we look now notice the prophet said the Bible has the answer because it is the revelation of Jesus Christ being revealed since the foundation of the world he says Christ has been revealed in the form of prophets Christ has been revealed in in the form of Kings he has been revealed in the form of law givers you all know this quote he is the principal theme of the entire Bible if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse of it go back and read it again if you can't see Christ in every verse of the Bible then you read it again because you miss something the Bible is Christ and he is the word can you say that with me Christ is the word Christ is the word oh aren't you glad for that now the prophet asked the question how will the people that's believe in him know it in other words know him unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is can you say amen amen if he's going to be revealed we got to look at him in other words in order to be saved ain't that right amen but you won't know it unless you're constantly in the word to know what he is brother Brown I'm in another place said if we're going to have an understanding of God it must come out of God's word so let's look at this now for a moment is this okay amen according to Revelations 3 and 9 Christ is true can you say that with me Christ is true Christ is true but the prophet said now this isn't saying that he is true versus that which is false so this isn't the comparison of true and false amen but Christ being true means that he is the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization in other words for example in the wilderness the bread Came From Heaven in the Old Testament came down from heaven but Jesus was the true bread which came from Heaven ain't that right so so the partial realization was the the natural bread amen the natural manner but the perfect realization was when Christ come and he says I am the true bread ain't that right in the Old Testament Israel had a lamb as a sacrifice amen but Jesus was the true lamb of sacrifice ain't that right Moses was a prophet a man of God but Jesus likened to Moses was the true prophet of God ain't that right they David was king of Israel but Jesus was the greater David for he was the king of kings and Lord of lords amen Solomon had a gift to discern between right and wrong amen but Jesus Christ was the true he was the greater than Solomon ain't that right amen see so what the world should have seen when they looked upon him back then amen they should have see Saul the perfect realization amen that the church World they had been offering the Lambs they had been offering their sacrifices they had been building the altars they had their high priest but when he came they should have seen the perfect realization amen for when he came the lamb was done away with when he come the high priest was done away with when he come the altar was done away with when he come the rituals and the religious systems was done away with for he was the perfect realization can you say amen he is the truth see everything in the Old Testament were just types and shatters amen that spoke of him but when Jesus is revealed there's no need for a type and Shadow there's no need for a natural lamb or a natural high priest for the true has come there's no need for a natural altar or a natural blood of an animal to be shed for we now have the true aren't you glad we have the true you don't have to go to God by building an altar and having a lamb and then the blood is all over you we've already got a blood that is a greater blood we've got a high priest that's a greater high priest amen it's not a natural high priest that he's at the very Throne of God sitting on the right hand of the father and he's interceding for you day and night he does not stop it's a greater intercession than what the pope can do it's a greater intercession than what a priest can do it's a greater thing brother Branham says the blood of the Lamb was all right until that day but now after crucifixion it changes the old system is done there was a new one the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds oh aren't you glad for that amen I'll tell you this there's no need amen for Solomon to come and Reign and bring on a millennium amen you know the prophet said that Solomon's natural Reign amen represented the Millennium but we don't need him to come amen the true the true son of David has come and he's bringing on the true Millennium amen where there's no there's no uh enemy there there's no sin there's it's a millennial rain ain't that right so notice God is the word when the word the prophet said was in Moses he was God in flesh when it was in Jesus it was God in flesh they the only thing he'd done was change his mask not his word not his nature he is the same yesterday today and forever he only changed his form he changed from Noah to Moses he changed from Moses to David from David to Joseph on down till he come into the fullness of the godhead bodily so God was fully manifested in Jesus Christ can you say Amen you see the prophet told us that Moses was the word for he portrayed Christ Joseph was the word in his day amen portraying Christ each of them was the word portraying Christ but when Jesus come he was the word the true in its fullness can you say man the perfect realization amen had come well aren't you glad for that amen see so we we find a man that that God fully manifested now now notice the prophet said the spirit of God working down through the prophets till it come to full manifestation in Christ Jesus the whole Plan of Redemption laid in him it didn't lay in Moses it did lay in David it didn't lay in Joseph it didn't it only laid in him amen they were the word pointing to him can you say amen amen even the full Redemption didn't lay in that natural lamb or the high priest but what they were they were pointing pointing pointing he's coming he's coming he's coming hey remember when Jesus came he said I am him I am him I am that lamb I am that true bread I am the one I am that water can you say man he was the perfect realization see brother Brown said the whole plan wasn't in them they were pointing to it see uh but therefore after him the fullness we can't point to something else it points back to him the word so then after John uh introduced him what did he say he said I must decrease but heat must increase it had changed from the prophet to the prophecy and you say Amen well you love me is one thing to walk with John but what a greater thing to walk with the word it's one thing to be a part of the uh of John the Baptist ministry but it's another thing to be a part of Jesus's Ministry [Applause] then you say man I think people get confused of why brother Branham come [Applause] I thank God for a prophet [Applause] I'd love to be there in them days but I think I'm walking with something greater I think I'm part of something greater now I'm one I'm a big advocate of listening to them tapes and you should listen to them teeth but don't you get to the point that you can't have Revival because brother Branham ain't here that you can't walk with God because brother Branham ain't here we don't need another prophet Prophet come on the scene amen amen you are that Revival you're part of something that's greater than you say man [Applause] now notice when Jesus walked the Earth the Jews didn't look upon him or they did look upon him but they didn't know who he was and notice what Jesus said in John 5 9 39 search the scriptures search the scriptures search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me [Music] as brother Randall said brother Emmanuel he come out of the book come on come on he come out of the book his ministry come out of the book The Works that he did come out of the book the words that he said come out of the book his life that he lived come out of the book and he said every part of me is in the scripture search them in them you think you have eternal life that I don't care read Moses he testifies of me read Joseph he testifies of me read David he testifies of me read about Elijah he testifies of me can you say man why he come out of the book and it wasn't strange to those who were predestinated to see it that's all they could see now the prophet said the veil of tradition blinded the people to where they couldn't see him yet the Bible declared his full coming he come in the full revelation of the word and they were ashamed the church world was ashamed of him I want to just say this it's incredible how people get embarrassed of the truth but yet they'll accept anything that's not truth let David caress rise and see who follows let the Jim Jones's rise and see who follow us that when we say God sent a prophet Your Mother by oh you're of an occult we've seen the blood come out of hands we've seen the oil come out and we've seen gold teeth being filled with gold remember brother Bryce would you I don't know if he was there in them times LH Connors come held a meeting Dynamic preacher big old preacher had a three week I think almost a month at the Tulsa World to come out to the meetings carried a flashlight with him he had people come and needed the teeth filled with teeth field he'd have them to open their mouth and have anyone to come and watch it lay hands on them with that flashlight and you could sit there and watch gold come out of the teeth but it ain't scriptural come on now it's not scriptural [Music] but they'll accept anything that's not truth because that's the way people are even Jesus told him John 5 43 I come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him when he receive can you can you say amen amen but there's no promise of anything like that in the Bible see brother Branham says if there's a truce it must be by the word and Jesus said I am the truth [Applause] then you say amen I am the truth so when we look into him we're not looking at a lie we're not looking at some gimmick that a man has amen that's why we're not as vulnerable we've already seen him the truth we're not embarrassed to Proclaim he's the truth come on Church you're believing the truth this isn't a workup this isn't trying to get you into amen uh I'm buying the thing it ain't trying to reform you this is the power to change you it's the truth it's the truth it's God's provided way it's the truth [Applause] so Prophet says then what he does will be word based it will come from the word so as I said earlier God allotted his word to each age brother Brown said each generation reveals him in the full Revelation that's allotted for that time and he says this generation must everybody say must now we're going to get a personal must reveal Jesus Christ this generation must reveal Jesus Christ that's the revelation of him that's promised in the word it must be revealed to this generation oh my in the word allotted for this day Jesus Christ is to be revealed but how is he to be revealed here's another scripture that's applied for our age John 14 18 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you [Applause] ain't that right amen the prophet said in the Old Testament when he came he came to the prophets for the word always comes to the prophet and his method has never changed can you say Amen his method has never changed oh so we'll go on 19th verse yet a little while and the world sees me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also at that day can you say that with me at that day now if you was in a Pentecostal if you was in a Baptist if he was all whatever you as Catholic or just none nothing amen and you were to read that scripture you would say what what day what day are we looking at was it the days of Jesus was it the days of Paul was it the days of ireneus what what day it is well here's a prophet that says at that day this day can you say that with me this day amen you shall know that I am in my father you and me and I in you so what was the Revelation the word that come to a prophet in this day was the revelation of where he is and who he is and it's in that day this day amen that we've heard a voice we've heard the Revelation we've caught it and now we know that he is in the father we are in him and he is in US can you say Amen so notice now that you shall know when the Revelation comes forth brother Brown said then it's I in you and you in me I don't care how smart you are in this message if you miss the revelation of where Christ is you're missing it are you with me now if you've got to feel like that I've got to lay hands on you to get anywhere with God you're missing it if you got a feeling that the only way you can have a good meeting is for me to come and preach to you you're missing it [Applause] hello if you're thinking that you've got to have a good word set over you you're missing it [Music] [Applause] the revelation of this message if you catch the revelation of a prophet's message and his ministry it will be he and you Christ in you and you and him the Revelation unfolded is Christ in you and you in him aren't you glad for that [Applause] listen now we're not supposed to make Christian converts to Christianity by government but by the Revelation everybody say by the Revelation the Christ in you the Christ in you what's the Revelation to Christ in you see as God was in Christ see as God was in Christ Christ in you now don't get quiet on me now as as God was in Christ Christ is in me can you say that with me as God was in Christ is in me that's the revelation can you say Amen when see what God did in Christ Christ doesn't you what signs God did in Christ God does in you it ain't all up to a minister it's to a bright body yes sir [Applause] notice Zechariah 14 6 and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light [Applause] thank God for the light why because at the evening time there shall be light there's gross Darkness upon the people and gross Darkness upon the Earth but here's another verse I Rise and Shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon the amen so if you believe this message you'll believe that this this this scripture is fulfilled in this day and brother Branham called back like the evening light because it shines in the evening time ain't that right now in John 8 12 Jesus says I am the light of the word aren't you glad that he's the light of the world oh yeah that's been preached and and testified about and sung about he's the light of the world Amen but notice in Matthew 5 14 Jesus said you're the light of the world a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid you think God's Gonna hide that Revival that he's having you no sir you think God is going to hide himself in you amen no sir you think God is going to hide this move that is happening in this bride no sir the devil will come against you but he'll never shut you up amen the devil tries to stop the ministry then he'll never shout him out the devil try to stop your joy stop your dance stop your song stop your faith then he'll never do it for it cannot begin there ain't no trial big enough there ain't no Darkness strong enough there ain't no devil demon life amen step powerful enough to stop this Pride you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid but notice it's not a Different Light it's the same line Jesus says I'm the light then he says you're the light amen but he just changed masks it's the same light oh yeah we got Bible for it Matthew 24 27 for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be can you say Amen he said brother Brown says what the same son s-o-n that was revealed in flesh at the morning time back there will be revealed again in the evening time look look come to me and be saved and don't be ashamed [Applause] so sad that message people that claim to be a message or ashamed of our joy ashamed of our praise of our dancing ashamed of the gifts ashamed [Music] you think I'm going to just sit here and just wiggle a toll when I've looked and I saw him [Applause] in me and I'm just going to sit there and be quiet [Applause] don't be ashamed of us going too far brother Brian said he ain't say nothing out of order yet this ain't this ain't fast songs going to work you up we were in Pentecost I know what it was like I know how to sing the songs that get you excited but this ain't it this is the word coming forth then you say Amen this is the revelation of God in you that has been made known in this day and you want me to sit there and act like I don't know it and act like I can't feel him and I clap I don't know what his power has done to me you're out of your mind Luke 17 28. like I like also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it ringed fire and brimstone from heaven and Destroy them all even this now we all know that we're living in the days a lot we're living in the days of Noah and if you're a real message believer you'll know this one even thus it shall be in the day when the son of man is revealed how many believes the son of man has been revealed the son of man the son of man can you say Amen yes sir see so the prophet said the same light that Rose in the East is here in the west the same head that was here in the East is here in the west again can you say Amen but here it is he's not revealed to us he's not revealed to this world as a partial realization he's revealed as the true perfect [Applause] he's the perfect realization for he is true then you say man brother Brown said down through the church ages the word is taken on a veil through the reformers but it has finally come out into the complete [Applause] y'all ain't getting it are you it's finally come out to the complete see look he says this he said on the day of crucifixion the old Paschal Paschal Lamb passed away and Christ become our lamb at the day of crucifixion and the day that the denomination has crucified the word of God and accepted a Creed instead of the word that's the day the word has come into full effect and that's just been recently now I have to tell you I'm glad they crucified it because out of that crucifixion here I am can you say Amen I'm glad that the denominations kicked him out but also have a verse that says let us go beyond the camp go unto him beyond the camp and bear his reproach and I'm here to tell you there's a people that's not ashamed to bear his approach hey they've kicked him out amen but I'm not a part of that age I'm not a part of the layout of CN age I'm not a part of that denominational age that ran out when they crucified him but I've come unto him and the word has come into full effect I feel the word in my bones it's like a fire shut up I know I'm going in around Son of God I know I'm going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the word has come into effect bless the name of the Lord bless the name of the Lord what do you love him can you lift your hands and worship him Glory Glory Glory Glory blessed be the name of the Lord the word has come into full effect Hallelujah Hallelujah brother Brown said in the evening time the clouds will move away the denominations will fade and the same gospel everybody say the same gospel the same word made flesh as he promised in Luke 17 33 which was I believe he meant it's 30-30 the same gospel with the same thing would take place in the evening time just when the Shadows are getting low the same gospel the same Christ that lived in flesh back Yonder at the beginning on the Eastern people shall live again in not one in everybody say in notice the difference on the Eastern people shall live again in the western people at the end time and you can't miss it there's no way you'll miss this revival you did not stumble into this messenger God brought you to this message because he saw you in the beginning yes sir it's an evening light the son of man is revealed what is the evening like to do the prophet said to restore God is going to restore the whole word of God again the full manifestation of Christ in his church by shining forth the evening light notice in another place God in his fullness died for the sin of the people that he might bring to his church a Sanctified life that he might have the preeminence in fullness in his church to manifest every promise in these last days that he promised for the last days aren't you glad for that Amen brother Ram says what was Jesus manifested for to show God he was God he had to be no man could die no Prophet could die he was God he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the king he was the history he that was he was that was to come he was that was he that is and he that to be in this day the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested for that purpose and through that purpose he achieved a church not going to achieve he's already achieved it that the he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days when he gets the preeminances in the church the position his place in the church somebody say his place his place don't worry about your position amen his place in you in the church then you say Amen you can be seated Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall you he do also even more than this shall he do for I go unto my father see that was his purpose there was the manifestation now everybody say now today he wants to get somebody that can so see it that they can let the word stop trying Slayer but I'll tell you what did I believe let the word flow let the word flow through them can you say Amen now notice Jesus so seen it so it was so perfectly born for that day until God expressed every move that he made he was God's revelation God revealed now he's Sanctified with his spirit and bloody church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed now see he could go back and pick up what these other fellas has left off talking about that seventh angel in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mystery of the Seven Seals he is everybody say he is expressing himself that's his purpose that's why he died that's his SEC the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in Christ then to express himself through the church and the same thing Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them so if I can say it this way the church if I say the church which is the body of Christ today is God's revelation Christ in a physical body was God's revelation but I'm telling you right now Christ in you is God's revelation the Church of the Living God today is God's revelation look look don't be ashamed when you look and be saved what's the mystery the mystery is revealed Christ in you he that is true can you say that with me he that is true is revealed in his bright body she has bone of his bone she is life of his life she is power of his power she is him look don't be ashamed when you look notice Enoch was our type Rahab was our type Esther was her type Ruth was our type Elisha was her type Caleb was her type the shunamite woman was her type I'm going to say something here The Ark was our type [Music] oh I don't know and we could go type after type after type after type after type that spoke of you and you say man so can I say it now we are not the shadow we are not the type we are the truth we are the perfect realization everything that they spoke of we are it what the ark spoke of we are hit what that shooting my woman then she spoke of us can you say Amen what Esther done she spoke of us we are it can you say Amen notice the church the prophet said the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when now no no notice now amen that was years and years and years ago I believe there's a church come into an adoption we're not waiting and waiting and waiting when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection he didn't pour into Ruth his fullness she was attacked [Music] that when the church in Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us I hope it's making sense and raises the dead and we go into the rapture I tell you this we are not waiting any longer the sons of God are being made manifested right now so again no longer a partial realization when you look when you look unto him you're not seeing him in a partial realization anymore you're not seeing him in a type and shot anymore we're not pointing to something to come he's coming he's coming he's coming we've been identified oh Church come on now we've been identified there is no need anymore for a natural Lester to sit on a natural throne there is no need for a natural ruse and a Boaz of the Old Testament to come there is no need for an Enoch to come in this day to fulfill the rapture there's no need for Samson to come and to destroy a natural enemy they were just types and shatters of what the church is today we are the perfect realization we are the true church can you say Amen so when he the perfect realization has come there is no need for partial realization that's why Baptist Doctrine ain't got nothing on us that's why there's nothing in this world that's appealing to us that's why revivals come and go it's not has nothing to do with us [Music] notice now the prophet speaking of Christ sit down through the age he showed it showed it in types knowing that someday the last type would be fulfilled and the full manifestation of his promise Messiah would be there and when the full promise come though he typed it day after day year after year he typed it and when it come to the reality they didn't believe it he has done the same thing typed it and showed it in the church ages and everything to the hour that we're living and people are in Gross Darkness seem like they just can't comprehend it such a sad thing if you allow me to go for a few more moments as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in this day and I say so it is in this day so there's no need for a natural Noah to build a natural Ark God has sent a prophet to build a bride brother Brown brother Jonathan talked about it but here's brother Brown saying it amen God has chopped his bride from the denominations by his word promised by Malachi 4 in the last days chopped out his bride hewed her from the rest of the churches hewed out his bride another place just think right out of the midst of all of that and the church denominations and all their Seminary lewdness and everything God has took prophets His prophets words word and chopped out a bride that we'll believe said he would do it he's hewed from that thing what he promised he would do another place Malachi 4 is to bring back back to the original the bride smitten from the church because she is the word another place I think brother Jonathan quoted it she stands alone she is smitten from all the denominations according to Revelation 3 say don't don't be ashamed to stand alone don't be embarrassed to stand alone you go you know you you go to work and and no one knows that God sent a prophet don't be embarrassed to stand alone boys when you go to school wherever you're at don't don't don't you know my my daughter asked the other day says well why why doesn't people know if brother Brandon was so was so uh uh popular and well no why doesn't people know that today because gross darkness is upon the the people though God would come in flesh he is very physical body and do the works the people wouldn't know him but God never promised think of that God never promised to come in a physical body and land on the earth he promised to come into a bride can you say man it's all scriptures it's there's so many scriptures that pertain to this day more about his second coming than his first coming and he has done greater things in this in this time than he'd done in that time [Applause] that gross Darkness to traditions of of the veil of tradition is keeping the people blinded can you say Amen but she is smitten from all the denominations according to Revelations 3 she is smitten out of the church age layout is in church age that she was raised up in now notice and we get ready to close now God is preparing a church today to be saved just as he did in the days of Noah and that Ark and the body of Christ today is that Ark no need for a natural Ark you're the greater the natural Ark wouldn't Float On this day the natural Ark would not take you from this Earth to another Earth come on now God knows what Ark will meet the challenge for this day you will float you will make it because I don't and now I told you I I just think that Noah saw a vision of that art but I know the the prophet of this day saw the vision of this Ark I know he saw the vision of this Ark and he did not see her going down he saw her going up up up up up up and there was a people in that body in that Ark that was being carried away into the real Millennium into a new world Amen to where it is a new king a new city a new righteousness a millennial Reign the church his art today coming into his church which is no more than his own spiritual body here on Earth and I will tell you this Ark is very fitting to the word that's been spoken for the day and you say Amen so as Noah introduced The Ark in his day so as the prophet introduced The Bride of Jesus Christ in this day and he says she's him she is the very virtuous spotless sinless bride she stands justified in his sight what an introduction no he didn't introduce Baptist denomination Pentecostal Apostolic he didn't introduce all these denominations he says away with all of that away with all that oh man you love him only a prophet could know why nature is acting the way it is he says listen close when the little baby Christ was born three stars went together and made the one morning star that reflected the coming of an infant Christ a perfect one now what's happened we see a roar in the paper across the television across the Nations where five stars just fell in line with the world what's five a number of Grace every time those stars come then something happens on the earth what taking place five stars fell in what was it and introducing of what since then notice just look what's taken place Germany almost washed off the map some of the Mad guys says that the world would burst like a watermelon every distressful things that's prophesied by them for the last days look what's taken place England the other day a storm that blowed away 70 000 houses in one day disasters everywhere California Los Angeles like to wash into the ocean what is it the beginning of Sorrows earthquakes have picked up everywhere why five stars come in line Grace God's grace what's happened why now he's not going to give us a scientific answer he's not going to even give us a church answer he's going to give us a revelation a prophet could give an infant Church Hallelujah a bride infancy that the power of God has begun to fall on her she's taking form a bride for this bridegroom that three stars meant his Perfection of the heavenly father of the Trinity becoming one on earth Among Us God's office is becoming one what happened now is the Church of the Living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach do you love him oh my I love him First Corinthians 12 13 for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body and we know that is the body of Christ the church is his body ain't that right and when you're baptized into the body the ark then you're free from sin ain't that right so God doesn't see you no more he sees Christ God can the problem said God can't judge that body he's already judged it he took our sins took our judgments and has invited us in so see as the Ark of Noah's day was predestinated to meet the challenge so is the church predestinated in this day to meet the challenge of of of this can you say man hey man uh we we we can go uh hear uh the church being identified brother Brown said she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she alone stands by it another place by the Holy Spirit baptized baptism we are baptized into that body and are free from sin God don't see you no more he only sees Christ aren't you glad for that and when you're in that body God can't judge that body he's already judged it he took our judgments and invited us to him another place if you're born again into the body of Christ and God looks upon you as a perfect as Christ was himself oh Lord and the traditional Veil is keeping the people from seeing him he says it's a spiritual Veil that's over the people say well I'm Methodist I'm as good as anybody I'm Baptist I'm Pentecostal don't you realize it that thing is a traditional Veil and it's hiding God from you that's the things that's keeping you from enjoying all CC oh you say well I'd shout and I jump up and down he said every word every Eve believed every word but one see it's the full word of God the promise of this hour made manifest another place he says if a man can't break that veil of tradition and break through that that wall of denomination to see God in his power it's death can you say Amen so again as I've said we're not seeing him through a type and a shadow anymore or as a type in a shadow but we are seeing him that is true a perfect realization can you say amen and where are we looking at him where are we we're looking at the open book and Paul said it's a mirror and you say Amen what is the word of God it's a mirror and you say man notice if you remember there in in Revelations 5 when the lamb had taken the book and loosed the seals thereof John says every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all them that are in heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and brother Brown says why what would cause John to do this he said he must have saw his name in the book can you say man he must have saw his name and as I said before amen I don't believe it was just that he turned a book uh you know turn now you know the book open and he saw his name on just a page but I believe that every promise every promise of God in the book John saw his name there then you say amen and we know that that was a type John was a type of the Bride for this age for it was in this age amen Revelations 10 the mighty Angel come down with an open book in his hand and Revelations 10 7 it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets the prophet said this the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he took the book he opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people can you say Amen to reveal see and I say to you the Revelation has been made known we don't need him to come back and make the Revelation known to us we just need to look oh not to the veil of tradition not to your own the veil of your imagination but through the veil of Revelation can you say Amen the eye of Revelation and we see him as not he is the alpha can you say that with me he is the alpha but it doesn't stop there he is omega he is the beginning he is the ending he is the first he is the last can you say Amen now notice first John 5 20 and we know that the Son of God has come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life so think of that we are in him that is true what an understanding amen Ephesians 1 4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him unless so you are the attribute of his thinking we talk about the word bride becoming word bride well you couldn't be word bride unless you was a thought because the word is an expression of a thought can you say man so to be word bride you had to be in his thinking his thoughts again you say amen and so the types and shadows are only ex only expressing what was in God's mind it's just like Adam and Eve and I'll close but Adam and Eve was not the real thing they only reflected the real true thing Adam was not Jesus Christ he was only a type of Jesus Christ Eve was not the Bride of Jesus Christ she only reflected the Bride of Jesus Christ can you say Amen in the mind of God he wanted to be bridegroomed but he couldn't be that an Adam only in Jesus Christ could it be in God's thoughts he wanted to come bright but he couldn't be that in Eve only in the church he could become bright then you say Amen but yet through Adam and Eve there it shows the relationship of Christ and his bride ain't that right yes sir so we see how we are his wife amen as I've said before there's a three-fold revelation of Adam in spirit form God said let there be let us make man in our own image brother Brian said the man existed you just couldn't see him he was in spirit form but then we see the second fold of Adam and that was Adam in flesh form if you had something in him that you could not see that needed to be expressed in the third revelation of Adam was Adam and Bride for him she was Adam and so much that her name was Adam can you say Amen but we don't need Adam and Eve to come back we are the true and we will not be deceived we will not what a communion with our Lord water relationship we have with him if the musicians will come oh we could go on and on and on you know there had to be a door to that art right the Bible says only once by one spirit it wasn't a denominational spirit it wasn't a church spirit religious spirit it wasn't a politic Spirit it wasn't the world spirit it had to be one spirit one spirit that would get you into the ark the prophet said at Noah that day when he introduced the art and began to tell preacher's message come Noah stood at the door of the Ark Noah the prophet stood at the door of the Ark he didn't stand at the end of the Ark he didn't stand away from the ark and say go go he stood at the door of the Ark and anybody that come into the ark had to pass through the prophets you had to look in the direction of the prophet don't get your eyes all on the prophet look at what he was standing at can you say man he was standing there introducing the door this is the way so there'd be no confusion on how to get into the the ark this is the way here I am come come come come come right here see the prophet was he didn't want no one to miss it right if I stood on the end of the Ark say it's over there but where well over there but where I don't know no no I gotta stand by the door y'all stand out the door and say come right here don't get any other ideas that there's another North there's another way into this Ark I'm right here [Music] I'm going to tell you something Jesus says I am that door and you know what even in Revelations John the third chapter said he saw an Open Door and in the in the fourth chapter of Revelations John said I saw a door open in heaven sign door Christ is the door see he this this prophet in this day wasn't inducing a natural door he didn't point to a natural Church he didn't point to a natural thing Peter says that an entrance shall be preached unto you I know the Pentecostals think they've got the spirit and everybody else is claiming to have their Spirit but I'm telling you this there's a one door into this body and the prophet stands at that door it ain't emotions that's going to get you in it's not Sensations that's going to get you in can you say Amen it's not gifts that's going to get you in you've got to stand beside the door can you say Amen look at it where the Prophet is standing he's introduced to us Christ and Christ is the Dynamics and the prophet said in this in another place the message is Christ don't you separate Christ from this message you'll miss the door [Music] well we need to be more like Pentecostals you better just stay at the door go into the door where the Prophet stood [Applause] oh now I wish I could preach let's stand to our feet God bless you you love him what song you playing ah it's Upon Jesus look full [Music] the things of this Earth will grow strange [Music] have you ever wondered why the prophet would tell the story of that boy [Music] he had never seen the mirror before [Music] he didn't know what it was like never saw himself [Music] they went into the city and his mother visiting a relative I believe first time he had ever saw a mirror looks to that mirror and he sees a boy [Music] he left his hand the boy lifted his hand [Music] he moved a certain way and the boy moved a certain way [Music] his mom's standing back there watching him as he's discovering himself and the Revelation the understanding caught he said but mama that's me I thought how proud God must be in this age he would send a prophet to labor and labor and that profit wouldn't be bought the prophet wouldn't be dissuade they brought the mirror before the people God stands there watches [Music] as we're hearing the message we're playing the tapes you're coming to church and you're hearing your pastor labor over the message and all of a sudden something strikes your heart I'm not a sinner no more I'm a Child of God [Music] I'm not a son of grand Martin anymore I'm a son of God [Music] my sexual blood has been dismissed it doesn't matter what the heritage of my family was it doesn't matter what traits have been carried down I'm a gene seed of God mama that's me God must be proud to see us when we come to the discovery of Who We Are [Music] must make him proud to know that he's been able to have preeminence in us and so much [Music] powers expressed to us there's some young people in this day that won't be defiled by the devil [Music] oh yeah you go through your valleys and you go through your Temptations young people you're going through trials that you've never that I've never gone through you're going through things that I've never gone through sometimes I Marvel and I just say oh God keep them but then I look and I think oh God you've gotta you got young people that's going to make it in the Rapture they're part of this Ark [Music] their part and they're looking and they're not ashamed they're not ashamed to tell the devil devil get away from me they're not ashamed when they fall to get back up again say I claim the blood they're not ashamed that's why you're here today is because you're not made by denomination it's the message that has made you what you are it's the message that is created parents it's a message that's created you young people just to believe to love the Lord to walk with him you're a people that God chose before the foundation of the world just to walk hand in hand together with you and have intimate relationship with you oh do you love him can you lift your hands and just Worship the Lord I love you the longer I live I just love him can't thank God enough for the message in the hour what he's done for me he's been so good I thank God for these preachers thank God you should be thankful I know you are but you should be thankful you got a pastor that'll just preach the message it just dies out to his own thinking and just labors over this message sometimes we spend hours upon hours just studying but it's not to be it's not to be knowledgeable it's not to prove our smarts we just want to know what promises belong to you and just preach the promises for we know the angel of the lord always accompanies this message and as long as we just brace the message the angel of the Lord is here he'll help you young people he'll deliver you he'll set you free you don't need Psychology you don't need you don't need counselors you don't need the world you just need God leave the message and watch the world watch the angel of the Lord just come and sweep and break the fatters in your life I've seen it I've seen it in my children I've seen it in my own life seen it in my church amen this message is real God bless you brother Wendell oh and the things [Music] of this Earth will grow strains [Music] you in the light Glory [Music] before
