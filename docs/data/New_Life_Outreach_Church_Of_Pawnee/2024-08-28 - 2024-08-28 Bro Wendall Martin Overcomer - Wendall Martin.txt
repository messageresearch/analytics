and I know by the look on this guy's face that you're he's really glad to have you here tonight good to have you amen just good good to have everyone here this evening if you have your if you want to stand to the reading of the word we'll we'll um amen look here in the Book of Revelations the fth chapter we've been reading the church age book but I think tonight we're just going to minister a a little bit um in just preaching and um amen uh we I want to just preach on the this just a simple text Overcomer and um so let's look here at Revelations 5 and one I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the book and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept uh much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God s sent forth into all the Earth and he come and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beast and four and 20 Elders fell on before the lamb having every one of them Harps with golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you tonight for your love we're asking Lord that you would just come and minister to our hearts as we feel your presence we've enjoyed the songs father we're so glad to be uh reun United with old friends father and and even having a new friend among us we're just asking Lord that you would Minister to every heart that you would open your words of life and that you would encourage father we love you and we're so thankful for what you are in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated amen I want to Minister here tonight on the Overcomer and man we as we have just read the scripture a man of this lamb that was he was slain before the foundation of the world in the mind of God the lamb had a specific purpose and we want to look at that as we have as we have found in the message amen thankful for the messenger of the age that he would let us know that the lamb had three uh specific works that he was going to be doing amen there was the purchasing of the Bride man this was when he was going to be the lamb sacrifice where the Lamb of God would would lay down his life amen the second work was going to be the mediating this was going to be the lamb interceding for the church ages for you and for me throughout the amen these Church ages but as we have just read the lamb was also to come at a specific time at the at the end of this Gentile Church dispensation and he would claim those that he had purchased yes that he had been interceding for and he would CL CL you and me amen and ultimately take us back home where we belong amen so you see that amen each work of Grace does not each one each working of the Lamb does not nullify the other it was the lamb who's gave his life it is the Lamb who is interceding and then it was the lamb who has come to take the book to Amen to give this book now we know that he didn't just come and make the book and he didn't just open the book but Revelations 10 says he comes to Earth and he hands the book to the believer aren't you glad for that amen it's what God does and so we are we are thankful and and and many times we don't we can't really comprehend what amen what the work of the Lamb is is really about and that's why I I I think today many many times we we are amen we we try to limit or we we don't try but we do limit god with our with our finite mind we're we're really amen little PE brains compared to the infinite knowledge of God Amen but it's God's desire for you and I to come back to the position that we had with him before the foundation of the world you and I amen now we're we're here today in Fallen bodies we are here today in amen Amen in these flesh with the genetics that go back for hundreds of years we are amen our our complexes our genetics our everything about us that we are amen today amen we're just we're just a bottled up amen uh we're just a we're we're we're a bottled up uh creature of Amen of the past and we've got so many of these things within us but I I I I I want to say and and I and I hope tonight that you can see that the lamb has come to redeem you the lamb has come to take you back amen where you are today even in in your body of complexes there is a lamb that paid the price for you not just paid the price not just interceding but the Lamb's job is to take you back to your rightful place as the as as the owners of this Earth Amen to take us back that's and we're in that process of claiming right now where he's where he's saying Satan you can have no more can you say amen amen when John the Baptist amen looked at Christ he declared him this as the Lamb of God Amen the world really didn't know and didn't understand what John was saying and they turned around looking for a a four-legged lamb and amen they were trying to find out where the lamb was at they didn't understand the importance of God's lamb amen but John was using the metaphor of a amen of a of a of a lamb out of a out of a a herd amen but God's lamb was going to be the perfect sacrifice it would be the Lamb of God Jesus Christ can you say Amen they were looking for a messiah they were looking for someone to come and deliver them from Rome uh the Roman Empire they were looking for that but you see amen God had a lamb and it was in the body of Jesus Christ Christ amen God they they now they wanted again they wanted God to amen come down the Golden Ladder from Heaven amen they wanted God to come down and and and fight for Israel and to liberate them from that Roman oppression amen and the last thing they had on their mind was a lamb amen they they they they wanted someone to fight them and get them out of the oppression are you hearing me amen but they had been sacrificing Lambs for 4,000 years amen they had been offering Lambs Abraham offered a lamb God offered a lamb for for for uh H Adam and Eve and amen there was Lambs were part of the worship for those 4,000 years amen but this was going to be a different lamb amen this was going to be amen a a a a a God man coming down and sacrificing his life for you and for me amen so God used the metaphor of a lamb it's not that God that Jesus Christ was a four-legged wooly lamb it was that there was somebody who could pay the price for Humanity for your sins can you say Amen it had to be a kinsman redeemer to bring us back amen that that knew what it was to have sin that knew what it was to have have mind battles that knew what it was to to belong on to an Earthly family and yet he paid the price for your sins and for my sins so that we could come back in fellowship with god oh can you say Amen the the the the the natural lamb had been the amen uh the the Keystone to worship since the garden amen and they had so perfected that worship amen that you know they just didn't see that need for Christ amen but I I want to say John amen the John the Baptist he declared Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world Amen this was not going to be just any ordinary lamb amen there was no one else that was worthy to take this sin it had to be a god lamb that come to pay the price for you and for me now I want to tell you today amen you will never be worthy to make it to Heaven you will never be worthy to come in contact with God you cannot will not there's no good in you whatsoever the the amen the good has been found in God's lamb can you say Amen now you couldn't put the holiest of prophets next to him amen the holiest of all a holy would would have to bow their their heads Amen in the presence of him in shame whether it was the Cherub or the S or Elijah or Malachi or Isaiah they all had to hang their heads in the presence of this lamb amen you see the question that we just read that was going throughout the earth and the and throughout the heavens who is worthy to take the book The Inheritance of the earth amen the title deed to the Earth who is worthy to take that book and to loose those seals and to have it back to the rightful owners Hallelujah just in case you've forgotten Humanity it was Adam that was given the title deed to the Earth he was told to rule and to Reign he was told Amen to govern the fish and the foul of the air he was the one that could could speak like his father God Amen he could he could call for the tree to come he could call for the clouds he could call Heen he was in Dominion are you hearing me but when sin came he lost the title to the Earth amen it's now gone now we're hiding from the storm now we're hiding from Leo the life now we're hiding amen but God's got a a desire and that's to bring you back into that rightful position that he called you for hey can you say Amen we needed a lamb who could represent us amen but you see when they looked amen when joh seen the vision and he and and he heard the cry who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals and they searched through heaven and there was no one worthy they searched through Earth and there was no one worthy they searched under the Earth there was no one worthy no one at all not even to look at it can you say Amen so this book must be of high regards amen whatever that book was it was in high regards not a prophet could open it not an angel could open it these guys were not even worthy to look at it that's right that's true but then God says I've got a lamb Hallelujah and that lamb has been in my mind from before the foundation of the world God already well praise that the Bible says the lamb was already slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world well can you say amen amen you see God knew you were going to fail God knew that you were going to be bottled up with with a bunch of complexes God knew that your genetics were going to keep you and keep you and end up in this last day amen in Total Insanity amen but God provided a remedy for you and for me amen well I I I think that that that deserves someone doing some shouting on right there amen this book are you hearing me you see you and the book are connected the scripture says that your name is written in this book and the lamb had to come and redeem the book in order to take you back to your rightful place the lamb hallelujah oh come on now it's hard for you to see that you say my name's written in that holy book that the Angels can't even look at my name's written in that book that no one's worthy to look at yes your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life and that Redemption of the Lamb that intercession of the Lamb is for every name that is written in that book to come into its fruition and to come into the realities of the promises of God for each generation amen every Church age every member of that age was ordained of God to overcome for that age but we're living in the age not of just amen uh the the lamb sacrifice not just in the age of the lamb intercessor but we're in the age of the Lamb claiming you and me taking us well you ought to be shouting right now amen there is a redeemer there is a redeemed and we are here at one with Christ yes right can you say amen amen your name's written all over it brother Brandon would put it this way he said now you see the seals when it was he in his medori work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get the book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that is the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in that he came for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world where he was slain as a lamb someone shout hallelujah the book is your inheritance but there were leans on it amen you are no longer you you could not take Dominion you could the Adam's race could no longer amen have authority over anything why because they sinned Satan put Lings on the book that's right well praise the Lord amen you can say you own your house amen but if you don't pay your taxes you're going to lose your house even though it's paid for hallelujah amen you can say that you you want to go try to sell your truck amen and and the truck could be paid for but if you've used that truck if there's leans on another loan somewhere you can't sell that truck until you take care of all of these other loans there's leans on your truck you say it's mine amen I bought it it is mine but you cannot it is not yours because there are [Music] leans and God gave human God gave Adam's race this Earth and told him to have dominion and told him to take possession but Satan's got all of these Lanes amen you've been born in in a flesh you've been amen you were born speaking lies you were born shaping in iniquity you're born with complexes and the devil's got all of these Lings on you amen you don't have the faith like you need to have and walking in perfect love and walking in perfect Faith because Satan's got the leing but the lamb Has Come Oh somebody shout hallelujah the lamb has come to redeem you back amen this evening if you could understand that the leans have all been taken care of I don't care about your complexes I don't care about yesterday I don't care about what your family tree looks like if you can look to a lamb and understand that there is a lamb here tonight that can help you to [Applause] overcome man oh God we needed a lamb and John declared Behold the Lamb of God he who takes away the sins of the world can you say am ma'am John would say man I'm not even worthy there there there in John 1:27 when he's discussing this lamb he said he it is who cometh after me who is preferred before me whose shoe latchet whose Sho strings I'm not worthy to un loose but then on the 29th verse John 1:29 the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and said Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world this is he of whom I had said after me cometh a man that is preferred before me for he was before me and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am I baptizing with water John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and a bol upon him I knew him not but that he had sent me he that sent me to baptize with water the same said to me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining upon the same is he that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost can you say Amen you see John didn't even understand can you can you see John did not even understand the extent of what this Lamb's job was going to be John didn't John didn't know what was going to be happen in the first age or the third age or the fifth age or the seventh age John John didn't understand the extent of that lamb right other than that he's the lamb that's to take take away the sin of the world H well praise the Lord but it took the prophet of the first church age to come in and say hey the lamb is not just amen he's not one to just pay the sacrifice but he's also the intercessor that intercessor is here he's here to intercede for you he's in heaven right now interceding Paul is saying listen this lamb is still at work oh somebody ought to be happy here tonight amen there is a L that is still at work for is he like matters of fact the John or or there the Apostle Paul would say there in Hebrews 724 but this man because he continu with forever hath an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost somebody look at your neighbor and say he is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them there is a high priest making intercession tonight for anything that is pertaining to you amen if you're feeling weak if you're feeling sick if you're if if you're in a sin amen if you've got addictions amen if there's things of the family tree that are hanging on to you I want to say there is a lamb here tonight that'll work for you and interceding for you you he says for such a high priest become us who is Holy and harmless and undefiled separate from Sinners made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those High priests to offer a sacrifice for his own sins first and and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself for the law maketh men High priests which have the infirmity in other words they're human beings with a lot of faults but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh a son who is consecrated forever more what am I trying to tell you tonight I'm here to tell you there is one that is standing in it for you you might be confused tonight but you've got a lamb that is there representing you amen you we're not talking about amen another mortal man like me that's going that's just nothing but a failure but I'm talking about the God of Heaven coming down in a b and giving himself amen as the ransom like a lamb would do and he is now there in a perfect body that is interceding for you amen he's there praying for you he's there believing for you are you come on church he was tempted like you were tempted but he was not defeated amen he was tempted at all points but the scripture says he never sin I just want to tell you if you if I'm going to have an intercessor give me somebody that's bigger than me give me somebody that is greater than me amen if God is going to intercede for me that I rely upon his finished work that's right going through a trial that's good God's not amen I'm in I'm I'm in sickness that's okay God's not amen I'm in an impossibility in my life amen that's okay God is not in any impossibilities God is God and God has paid the price and that lamb is interceding for you tonight well praise the Lord amen Hebrews 9:14 how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might have the promise of the in of the of Eternal inheritance can you say Amen are y'all with me here tonight now does that not mean that does that mean that you're free uh from a from trial does that mean that you're free from accusation amen no because the Bible says that that that that that Satan's going to be there accusing all the way up to the time that we go home Satan's going to be right there accusing you Satan's going to be right there trying to give you sickness he's going to try to he's going to fight your mind he's going to try to trip you up he's going to try to amen take your faith away from you come on church amen listen just because you're a Christian doesn't mean that amen you are trialfree that might mean that all of hell is against you all of hell trying to destroy you all of hell trying to get to your faith but I just want to point out a very important and crucial element to this story we have a lamb we have a lamb that is interceding for you tonight but I fail yesterday that's okay get back up because the lamb did not fall Hallelujah I'm going through a trial amen and it's a really a brutal trial that's all right hang on endure God's going to see you [Applause] through the Bible says there in Genesis 3:15 man God told Adam and Eve right there when he was given the Judgment he told him he said that serpent is going to be there to crush your heel to bruise your heel amen Genesis 3:15 I will put enmity or hatred between thee and the woman now he's telling the serpent there's going to be a hatred there's going to to be a hatred between the woman's seed sexual born seeds that has another genetic on the inside see sometimes we sometimes we don't understand that sometimes we don't realize amen that that that we forget that we've still got genetics that that go up our family tree we we've still got genetics coming from our great great grandpa and great great grandma amen and and and that's just on the dad's side and then you've got some stuff coming from the mom's side and we sit there and we wonder why we're so confused all the time we wonder why we're up and we're down there is nothing good about this flesh amen and if you judge yourself according to the way you think and the way are you hearing me you got to understand that there is an eternal seed on the inside of you it was a predestinated seed of God so that's why the Apostle Paul says there are two laws on the inside there's those that are born of the sexual seed and then there's those that are born amen of the Eternal seat and those laws go back and forth when I would do good I find that evil is present amen when I when I would just it's just a confused mess going on on the inside of me all the time but I want to tell you thanks be to God there is a lamb and that lamb has says I'm going to take you through to your Perfection you will not be lost I will take you amen praise the Lord can you say Amen now he says I'll put enmity hatred between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it her seed shall bruise Crush I don't know why they put bruise literally means Crush thy head and the Serpent's going to bruise the Heat can you say man now am I making an excuse for anyone that has the Holy Ghost and still letting and still letting the genetics rule us no I'm not the New Birth has empowered the sons of God yeah to take Dominion yes sir over the devil right he didn't say that the genetics you say why do you say the genetics Hallelujah don't take too very far to go back from when that conversation was taken place Eve had not even had children yet Eve was impregnated by The Serpent and he's letting her know because of all of this nonsense that's going on your seed is going to come out come on as spiritual retards come on they're going to come out diseased they're going to come out in death they're going to come out there there's going to there it's going to it's it's the the world is going to be full amen of of Flesh beings and it's and are you hearing me but he's give the promise but the genetics of God will still be on the earth that's right and there's going to come a time now you're going to have to have these natural Lambs I'm slaying a lamb right now for you before you go outside this Garden amen Abel's going to have to slay a lamb the man Noah is going to have to slay a lamb and Abraham's going to have to slay a lamb and David bless his heart he's going to have to have a lamb amen there's going to have to be Lambs there's going to be lambs and when these little wooly Lambs these little four-legged Lambs when you kill them I'm not going to look at your sin you're going to hang on to the horns of the Altar and as you hang on and as you're slaying the lamb and the blood's coming all over you and it's and it's gurgling for its life the the life of that innocent lamb is going to come upon you amen I'm not going to look at your sin I'm not going to look at your failure I'm not going to look at your Humanity I'm going to look at that L and I'm going to come down and visit with you are you hearing me amen but you see the life of that lamb could never make me perfect the life of that four-legged creature could never change my genetics the life of that lamb could never amen bring me in True Fellowship and back to Dominion it took a living God coming down in a body of Flesh to pay the price amen I'm a human and that four-legged lamb I don't understand lamb talk and he don't understand human talk can you say am man but when God became a human God felt like you felt yeah sure did God hurt like you hurt that's right God was a teenager like you were a teenager God suffered and I'm going to blow you kids away but the Bible says that Jesus amen he learned he was perfected by the things that he suffered are you hearing me in other words he had to have a mom and a daddy too and he had to have somebody to call him down occasionally too well I'm talking about Jesus he was he was a boy just like you he was a teenager just like you he knows what it is come on now but that man became My Sacrifice he died on a calvary's cross so that that perfect genetics of God the life that made him holy comes back upon me so it does not just forgive my sins but the life through the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes back and lives within me now I've got something to overcome I've got something to overcome the fell that was born amen June 22 1970 Within Me is full of all this nonsense Within Me amen but I've got to do it the way God says to do it I've got to recognize that I'm a sinner I've got to recognize that I've got some things in me that needs to be taken care of and I can take those things that's in me I can take those sins those rebellions I can take I can take Mr wend Martin and I can come to Calvary and I can expect God to come down and wash me and cleanse me and give me the power to overcome and to keep that devil down can you say Amen it's the lamb who is interceding for this well praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah now you say I understand we brought it I've come to Calvary so now so now since I've come to Calvary and I've got the Holy Ghost now it's all done and I want to walk out of here no more battling with me and my genetics and what my mama was and my daddy was and my grandpa was and my grandma was and no no more having to deal with anything the Apostle Paul says I have to Die daily that means that if I'm going to rule and Reign I've got to feed the white dog and not the black dog I've got to come on church amen the realities of this glorious gospel for the church is that there is a lamb that is greater than anything you're facing Hallelujah can you say Amen now Adam's race has been in slavery since the fouring of that book he's lost his position of authority here on the earth wandering in miserable slavery Satan by default is the acting owner of the earth amen though we know he's not the owner the book has been waiting for the sons of God now the prophet would say this he would say now the forfeited TI itle deed is in the hand of the original owner almighty God the title deed to the Earth and to eternal life when Adam forfeited it then Satan's dirty hands could not take it it went back to its original owner God himself now does that mean anything to you yes that does that means a whole lot to you because you were given the authority Satan tripped Adam and Eve up and has taken the title deed and says ha I've got it for myself now he claiming he's the owner of the Earth but the prophet says oh no when Satan was taking it and was gloating God just reached right over grabbed the title deed and says it's coming back to me until I redeem my sons that ought to mean something to you yes sir that ought to mean something to you you say well I'm waiting on the Sweet By and By I'm here to tell you the claiming is going on right now the lamb is interceding right now you have authority over the devil right now you can claim your healing right now you can claim your salvation of your children right now you can do it right now because the lamb has prevailed for you the lamb has prevailed for you can you say amen amen but Satan what keeps you Austin from taking this title deed the opening of the book what takes what what keeps keeps you from reaching out and just killing the devil in your life Satan holds sin over your head that's right Satan holds your mistakes over your head Satan holds genetics over your head Satan holds well praise the Lorden and so here you are you can't come before God even though the lamb has redeemed you you can't come and willingly accept what God has already paid for I said it's already paid for I said the title deed has been handed back Revel Revelations 10 has already transpired no it's not the literal we're not walking on the ashes of the wicked yet but it's every bit ours the book has been opened up to show you who you are you're not a w to be you are a son of God can you say Amen but as long as you're walking in condemnation then you get the I don't care attitude well you know I'll never be and so you're just going to go on out there further in sin why don't you cut that Serpent's head off crash his head and say I am going to stand as a Son of God and I'm going to overcome hallelujah hallelujah and the prophet would tell us Satan is still here and that's the reason all these things happen he's still here now remember he don't own it but he's here and all of his evil forces are still here notice that's why Earth now is so filthy that's why the scum and the ridiculous things that goes on the Bloodshed War politics sin adultery all kinds of filthiness goes on is because Satan is the ruler of this Earth and this atmosphere you say this atmosphere yes sir both the heavens and the Earth is contaminated with Devils that can accuse us before God you mean the atmosphere yes sir both the heavens and the Earth is contaminated with Devils that can accuse us before God but Jesus is there to intercede for us and while the accusers keep pointing a finger they did this they did this they did this the blood still covers because he come to redeem that elect that he foresaw I'm fixing a shout because you're not hallelujah amen well I got to read it to you again because it didn't quite hit home the heavens and earth is contaminated with Devils that can accuse us before God but Jesus is there to intercede for us while the accusers keep pointing a pinger a finger they did this they did this they did this the blood still covers he came to redeem the elect that he foresaw woo can you say that amen now the Book of Job declares it shows us what Satan does the Book of Job shows how that Satan comes in and accusing accusing accusing accusing doing everything he can to accuse can you say amen and if you're doing a lot of accusing you might be anointed by a spirit that likes to accuse Hallelujah which is none other than well praise the Lord that Old Devil just wants to accuse accuse accuse accuse accuse accuse amen but I remember Jesus saying when the accuser was coming to coming to Amen to Stone all of the accusers were all around to Stone the girl found with adultery amen but when Jesus just snooped down and started writing didn't even say just just amen turn his back on him and started right and before you know it Rock started thuing to the ground amen he turns around and he looks at the woman and he says where are your accusers amen and she turned around and looked around and she says sir there is none that accuses me they're all gone he says neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more I come to redeem you bring you back to what you originally was I say we need to kick that condemnation devil out and we need to take authority over those Devils that are fighting us can you say amen amen I'm not saying ignore that devil I'm saying fight that devil defeat that devil you're a Son of [Applause] God then you got the other goost they they they want to just amen they they they they you know Satan wants to come in on the other hand and make you ignore it all the time you keep ignoring that thing it's going to kill you that's right so you got one devil that's telling you you're not worthy you got another devil says I don't care I'm I'm saved it don't matter to me how I act it don't matter to God how I act it does matter that's why he sent the lamb you say yes yes yes interceding that's that's what he's been doing Hallelujah let me go sin no the end work of the Lamb is to claim you back someone say sacrifice intercessor intercessor and claiming you can you say amen and Satan comes in he's trying to hinder your prayers tonight he's trying to tell you one minute he'll tell you that you don't you know it don't matter what it don't matter and then on the other hand he's got you so condemned to where you feel like you're not you're you're not worthy of anything but I'm here to tell you amen there's you are worthy when the lamb makes you worthy amen you're only Worthy when there is a lamb that has prevailed can you say amen amen and he was there accusing job to God Amen but and and and and I'm here to tell you amen you I I and and and he's telling God he says he's only serving you because you've protected him let me have him once and I will have him to curse your face amen I want to tell you I think the devil's been doing some of that going on in this church here lately amen the devil's telling you you've got cancer amen or you've got this or you've got that and trying to make you think that you're not a son of God I want to tell you today amen I want to put my finger right into that amen the devil's nose and I say you're defeated there is no condemnation that is going to keep us back we are sons of God we are Daughters of God we've been put here to fight we've been put here to overcome and this we shall do this we shall do amen did you know according to job the Devil comes before the Lord every day yes sir Hallelujah job 1:6 now there was a day when the sons of man or the sons of God come to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down Hallelujah so he's got a job he's got a job and then if you go on to the if you go on on to the amen and uh second chapter first verse and again there was a day when the sons of God come to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord and the the Lord said unto Satan from whence comest thou and Satan said answered the Lord and said from going to and throwing the Earth and walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth God and asseth Evil and still he holdeth his Integrity although thou movest me against him to destroy him without a cause and Satan answered the Lord and said skin for skin yay all that a man hath will he give him for his life but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse you to your face now this is after Satan's already he's already taken all of his cattle he's already taken all his sheep he's already taken his children he's T and now he's coming back to the Lord again and the Lord didn't wasn't trying to hide job on the second conversation I didn't read the whole chapter of the first he man he wasn't trying to hide job he says hey have you considered job now he was rubbing it in the Lord's fa or in Satan's face because Satan had just taken everything that he could and job was still there saying the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and now he's coming in and he's and he's just and he's rubbing it in the devil's face I come on he said now but if you give me give me permission to take his life you give me he says you can do whatever you want to him but you can't have his life and so he struck him with boils he gave him everything now he's got and then he gave him his dear old wife looking at him and telling him how how wretched of a man he is amen just really just poking it in there just poking it amen and job would stood right there and says you you you speak like a foolish woman I am not going to curse God I'm going to judge God faithful God well praise the Lord I'm not looking at this bag of bones I'm looking at a promise that God gave you see if there was a lamb a a little four-legged lamb that was a substitute for job and job knew he was perfect how much more should you and I know that we're perfect tonight if we've got the blood of Jesus Christ can you say Amen Peter tells the church he tells the church I want you to be clearheaded yes sir be sober minded know who you're dealing with he's come to kill he's come to steal he's come that that's 1 Peter 5:8 I'm not making it up I'm putting it in layman's terms but be sober first 1 Peter 5:8 be vigilant because your adversary the enemy the opponent the devil as a roaring lion Ro walketh seeking whom he may devour whom you must resist steadfast in the faith knowing you've got to resist won't you turn to your neighbor just in case they forgot you've got to resist you've got to resist Hallelujah resist that devil that's telling you that you're not going to be and you never will be resist that devil resist that devil that tells you that you'll never rise above your genetics resist that Devil's trying to tell you the things that you're that that you're going through amen right now amen whether it be the blood pressure that great grandma and great grandma great great great great great great all you can go all the way down why don't you resist that devil CU he wants to take you out just like he's taking everyone else out resist that devil amen amen that took out Grandpa amen and made a Looney Tune out of him and amen took out uh you know mama and and and and daddy or what the preacher or whatever else resist that devil and stand on the word of God and say I'm coming to stand backf footed against you I'm going to stand because I've got a lamb that's representing me he's empowered me I can have faith because I'm perfect in his sight I'm perfect because the lamb is perfect I can have faith the genuine Faith the pure faith that God gave me at the beginning because Satan has no authority over me am amen can you see man I feel like chopping Devil's heads off about right now Joshua the high priest weary tired torn clothes he was a high priest he had been representing his people he had done it day in and day out he was taking the lamb going into the most holy place he he was doing all of these work and he representing the people he loved God he loved people but Satan had another day before the throne and he's got Joshua and his clothes are dirty tattered torn he's weary he's tired and the devil the scripture says that the devil is accusing him Zechariah 3 And1 and he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him write it on down there and he's pointing to all of his weaknesses he's pointing to everything that he can't that that that he should be and that what he's not he's pointing to all of these things finally the Lord stood up and says the Lord rebuke thee Oh Satan is not this a brand that has been pulled out of the fire have not I placed my seal upon Him have not I called him and then he orders for the Angels come here angels I want you to take away his old filthy garments I want you to place new garments upon him are you hearing I'm saying we have an intercessor when Satan is telling you you have no right to intercede you have no right to pray you have no right to believe you have no right to stand I say tonight amen may we hear the voice of the Lord I rebuke you Satan amen May the angels of God come forth tonight and say give them new clothes give them fresh rainment I've got my hand upon them I'm interceding for them Hallelujah there's war going on in the heavens right now there's a war taking place right now I said there's a war in the heavenlies going on right now who is it the prophet says it's you you are fighting a spiritual warfare yeah the Apostle Paul says that you are casting down down those spirits that are in high places the place that you're supposed to be sitting in the place the Heavenly places that God's ordained for you God's called you to rain but Satan is right there through condemnation fighting against you can you see amen I said can you say amen amen Hallelujah but I've got some good news for you someone shout hallelujah hallelujah Revelations 12: 7 there was a war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against the angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven brother brandham says now when does this take place when the Saints Prevail and go up Satan has to come well glory to God you're saying I just wish I could Prevail I just want to Prevail I just God please get me when the saints Prevail that means you're going to have a weapon in your hands and you're going to be fighting how is this going to be taking place well let me quit preaching and start reading and the scripture says and the great drag was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he is cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they somebody say they who God God know the bride the church the elect the Brethren and they overcame them by the blood of the lamb and by the words of their testimony hallah there is a war going on yes sir and it all happened when God become a l the perfect lamb of sacrifice who was interceding second work but he's coming this day in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished and then he comes and tells the elect take that book it's yours eat that book and then speak this Mighty Angel comes down seventh angel catches the Revelation he declares the mystery the elect takes the book and starts eating it and they start speaking it that's all in the 10th chapter on and they overcome him by the [Music] word of their testimony but the word of the testimony could not have come the open book the third part of the of of the Lamb's work could not happen except the lamb would have given his life right and interceding yes so that you can speak so that you can believe can you say Amen Satan knows his days are numbered when Satan comes down the Saints goes up we are fighting our way to heaven you ain't going to be picnicking your way to heaven you're going to have to fight your way to heaven cancers are going to come up in your body but that's all right amen you might believe you might look down and say well your brother died of cancer and this one in the family tree died of cancer and this one di amen and so you're going to have to die of cancer that's a bunch of nonsense we are sons of God in a flawed genetic body but we're here under the genetics of the word of God and we're standing Hallelujah I wish somebody would stand against that enemy and say I ain't taking it no more am can you say Amen it was at one time Angelic Wars the first battle started in heaven right but now it's been human battles human battles I just want to tell you you've got the genetics of Michael in you Michael the Archangel come on you got the genetics of God on the inside of you amen y'all got the genetics of Michael on the inside of y'all too amen but this Michael's a greater Michael amen praise the Lord my oh my the genetics of God are on the inside oh come on now amen there is something that is that the holy spirit is here fighting through you you believe Christ is fighting for you oh yes say what God says you can have the right to say you couldn't do it before but because there's a sacrifice because there's an intercessor there is one that is interceding there is a goet you have all right every right to stand in the place of Christ because all of the righteousness of that lamb you the scripture says you are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus that means there's no sin held you are this Paul says you are just as righteous as Jesus the devil don't want you knowing that can you say Amen cuz he wants to look here here I say greater is he that is in you than anything that this old world could ever produce amen Christ in you the hope of glory won't you turn to your neighbor and tell him Christ in you is the majority oh what would I think tonight Lord let us look past the curtain of time just look over just a peek and see what it's all about we're fighting here tonight a great Warfare right and wrong the word of God against Mo modern theology trying to make the word of God bring it to the people while the enemy would try it to try to beset it in every way but one is the majority in God don't you just love that quote one is the majority now we're a part of God you always was you don't remember it because you only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking your very name every what it was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew you who he knew what you were I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and skar you don't know what who you are you're not going to be but now are you sons of God you always were the sons of God for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there well when he before the F before when he before he even become material here on Earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes he' know what your name would be he know your color of hair he knowed all about you the only things happen is when you being a sinner you look to the Lord can you say Amen so he seeing you in your natural genetics he seen everything about you you seen your color of hair you got it from Dad he seen your likes and dislikes you might have got that from great great grandpa he seen all of that but he also knew that on the inside of you was something greater than any kind of a natural seed amen you love him sorry for holding you so late toight I just the preacher making me feel good thank you Lord for your sacrifice thank you Lord thank you Lord when you wake up in the morning you look at yourself in the mirror and you think I don't know if this is Rapture material you mess up say something you shouldn't have attitudes you shouldn't do things that you shouldn't don't you ever let that devil tell you you'll never be because you already are amen the blood was shed for sons the lamb is interceding because sons are still in faulted bodies I'm so glad for a lamb tonight let's put our faith not in what we're looking at in the mirror let's put our faith don't look at me I've been proven to fail don't look at any man don't look at anyone in this church but there's a lamb and he's not just come to pay the price if you accept it good if you reject it but that lamb has been exalted to the right he's risen again set it on the right hand of God interceding for you so those of you that believed in the finished work of Calvary there is a lamb right here tonight that there is nothing no time anywhere any place any condition that can ever take away that love that God has for you and the promise was that at the end of this seventh Church age there would come a prophet messenger that the lamb would hand the book to and give you something that would strengthen your faith greater than any other age amen I've been praying hard the window but it sure don't seem like I'm overcoming it sure don't seem like I'm getting any better still sick still fighting is the Lord not hearing me Where's God at well he's resisting you and then he's accusing you he's resisting you keeping you because there's only one way you're going to fight there's only one way you're going to over come there's only one way you will ever win and that's through perfect faith that comes from him alone and if he can cut the line and make you think anything contrary than what you are you'll do it can you say Amen praise the Lord Brother brandham says look as long as that intercessor is still on the throne Satan can stand there and the musicians can come can stand there and accuse because he's the attorney of the other side he's the opponent of Christ he's standing there the opponent is standing there waiting saying but wait Adam fell Adam done this I conquered him I got his wife to believe a lie and you said she'd be damned by it I got it but here's the mediator standing here if you turn those um Panet off of my mon ear monitors the Kinsman he says but there is a mediator standing there the kinsman redeemer standing there with the blood that can take the viest sinner's heart and change it a mediator is on the throne yes Satan says but they're guilty Jesus says they're not that Clorox was invented or manufactured to take the stain take the coloring out of the ink or any other stain they got it it'll break it up

where it come from it's a creation had to come from a Creator but all the chemicals that was manufactured and put together they broke it up there's no more of it that's what the blood of Jesus Christ does to the true child of God when he confesses that sin and stands there Justified Mercy goodness even it's so great till God says I can't remember it anymore and is absolutely my son verily I say

priest who is interceding for everything he prayed for and the Great Mighty angel of God the spirit of that lamb has come greater than any other time in this day to assure it to your hearts that's what the open book means divine revelation that you're the one that he died for amen now if you ain't got that then I want you to start spending some time in prayer and say Lord let that anchor in my heart that's the only way we're going to make a Rapture is for that to get anchored in our heart amen you're the one he came for he came for you believe it if there's someone here tonight that needs to accept the Lord you've been a church member but you you haven't been serious with your walk with God you'll not make it to Heaven by being religious you've got to have a new birth you've got to ask forgiveness of your sins and then the life of God coming and living on the inside of you he makes all things do he gives you the desire to love him and to serving he makes sin really sinful cuz the Holy Spirit living on the inside of you just ain't it ain't going to it ain't going to be wanting to do the drugs ain't going to be wanting to drink the alcohol it's not going to want to go to The Honky Tonks the holy life of God coming back in you wants to live his life through you [Music] and there's nothing greater than to know that the great God Almighty can so change our lives and take every habit that is wrong every sin that is that we have in our lives come down upon us and him call you son him call you daughter you look into him and say I've got a heavenly father that loves me there's nothing [Music] greater how do I know because there's something that's tugging at our heart even right now something tucks and says you ought to listen to what the preacher's saying that's right there's something that God it's just it's incredible how God works and all we have to do is open up her heart let him do it I want us just to sing and I know it's an elementary song and but
