[22:11] wouldn't fall. Did not leave all of
[22:16] heaven just to die for your sin. I
[22:21] searched until I found you. And I do it
[22:25] all again.

[22:36] once again this evening, Lord. And Lord,

[22:47] and those that aren't. Lord, may you
[22:48] just be in the remainder of the service,
[22:50] Lord. Accept our worship, Lord. And
[22:53] Lord, may we just leave here knowing
[22:55] that we've heard from you. We just

[34:23] Oh yes, my Lord. Yes, my Lord.
[34:27] I hear the call.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; I hear the
[34:36] I know his spirit
[34:39] is moving
[34:43] through
[34:45] my all.
[34:51] He speaks
[34:53] to me.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; And I
[35:04] glorify God.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, please come
[35:11] and take
[35:13] my
[35:14] [Music]
[35:21] bless the Lord.
[35:23] He's so wonderful.
[35:29] I'm so thankful
[35:31] that we can come into his presence and
[35:37] you you sense his presence when he's
[35:40] near
[35:42] and when he comes he's he's got a reason
[35:44] to
[35:46] he's he's always wanted to be among his
[35:49] people.
[35:51] The Lord has always wanted to be among
[35:53] his people.
[35:55] And I I'm so thankful that that he made
[35:59] a way. He become a human being.
[36:03] He become flesh and blood like me and
[36:05] you. pay the price of sin
[36:10] to restore us back to fellowship to
[36:12] where we can love him, worship him, and
[36:18] we can actually literally enter into
[36:21] that that other dimension and feel his
[36:23] presence and know that he's with us. And
[36:27] there's just no telling what God's going
[36:28] to do here this weekend.
[36:31] I believe God's a miracle worker. I
[36:34] believe God's a divine healer.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And I believe that there is a people who
[36:40] are lining up their thoughts with his
[36:43] thoughts so that heaven can come on
[36:45] earth so victory can be felt and known
[36:49] among his people. And we so we love his

[42:34] &gt;&gt; Here's my cup,
[42:38] Lord.

[43:46] [Music]
[43:59] this mercy
[44:01] of
[44:03] my soul. Oh,
[44:10] [Music]
[44:18] I want
[44:19] [Music]
[44:25] my
[44:30] it
[44:32] and make Amen.
[44:37] Is that your heart's desire tonight?
[44:40] Amen. Ain't it good to be gathered into
[44:41] his presence? Why don't we just go
[44:43] before our Lord in prayer? Lord Jesus,
[44:48] we're so thankful that we could be
[44:52] gathered together
[44:54] and know that we serve a living God
[44:56] who's not dead, but you're alive forever
[44:58] more.
[44:59] And you're not just a god far off
[45:01] somewhere in the sky somewhere, but
[45:04] you're an everpresent help in the time
[45:06] of trouble. And Lord, you told us that
[45:08] I'll be with you even in you.
[45:11] And Lord, many times in these natural
[45:14] bodies and our senses of emotions and
[45:18] feelings,
[45:19] we might not know by those things that
[45:22] you're here, but there's another sense
[45:24] of faith that declares that you're the
[45:26] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[45:29] by divine promise, we know that you are
[45:31] present here with us right now. And
[45:34] Lord, that means we are right now
[45:35] gathered into a place where all things
[45:37] are possible to them that believe.
[45:41] Lord, it's good to be gathered together
[45:43] with our brothers and sisters of
[45:45] precious like faith and to see the
[45:47] smiling faces and to be able to greet
[45:50] one another.
[45:53] But Lord, I know there's some real needs
[45:55] that are represented here. Lord, there's
[45:58] some life situations, decisions, and
[46:00] answers, and
[46:03] trials that your children are going
[46:05] through. And
[46:07] Lord, we just want you to come by.
[46:11] Lord, I I have some notes. I I have some
[46:15] scriptures,
[46:16] [Music]
[46:18] Lord. I need you to come and take it
[46:19] into your hands,
[46:22] Lord, and break the bread of life and
[46:24] start distributing it to your children.
[46:27] as they have need of. Lord, as we just
[46:30] surrender oursel to you, may you anoint
[46:32] our lips and anoint the ear of the
[46:34] hearer. Lord, there's those that are
[46:37] even traveling now that are coming. May
[46:40] you be their protection. May they be
[46:42] encouraged on their way. Those that
[46:45] couldn't be with us. May you bless them,
[46:47] Lord. And we just are looking to you to
[46:51] be our portion. So we say, "Lord, here's
[46:53] my cup.
[46:56] Fill it up, Lord."
[46:59] Lord, sometimes if we want to be filled
[47:01] up, we got to be emptied out.
[47:04] So Lord, as we start these meetings, may
[47:06] we just start by a a total surrender,
[47:09] Lord, and an emptying out of
[47:12] maybe of disappointments and heartache
[47:14] and things we've gone through and maybe
[47:16] grudges that we're holding on to and
[47:18] maybe a certain outcome or expectation
[47:21] of of the service. May we just say,
[47:23] Lord, you have the right of way.
[47:26] Lord,
[47:28] may I speak for each individual? Lord,
[47:30] we want to invite you to come into our
[47:31] life,
[47:33] into our house, and our heart and walk
[47:37] up and down the corridors of our heart
[47:39] and Lord, the secret places maybe we
[47:42] haven't made available to you. We say,
[47:44] "Lord, I'm ready now. Just come and have
[47:47] your will and way." We pray. We commit
[47:50] the service to you. In the name of the
[47:52] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Praise
[47:55] the Lord. If you have your Bibles, we'll
[47:57] just we'll be reading out of Romans. We
[48:00] just thank Brother Wendell for the
[48:02] opportunity uh to be gathered here with
[48:05] you. It's um we never take the
[48:08] invitation to stand before the redeemed,
[48:10] the elect of God lightly, and it's just
[48:13] a a great privilege to serve with
[48:14] brother Nathan and brother Zachary and
[48:16] brother Ronnie. Uh it's great privilege
[48:19] to be able to serve beside those men.
[48:21] And so we're we're just uh in great
[48:24] expectation and it's a great honor to
[48:26] stand before you. God's elected. God's
[48:28] called. God's redeemed. And maybe
[48:30] there's somebody here that don't know
[48:31] that. And I pray that this weekend you
[48:34] will by revelation
[48:37] find out who you are.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; It's good to see many familiar faces and
[48:41] some from our church, the Bennett. And
[48:43] each one that's come. Are are you you
[48:45] looking forward to the word? Amen.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Well, I know some people are tired, so
[48:50] maybe we'll just get right into it and
[48:52] we'll just move right along. And as
[48:54] we're moving along, if you know, like a
[48:56] road trip, if they fall asleep or
[48:57] something, we'll hit a bump and wake
[48:58] them back up and we'll just
[49:00] &gt;&gt; we'll just keep on rolling. How does
[49:02] that sound?
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, we'll just get
[49:05] right into it. Romans 8 and 28. Just
[49:08] some familiar scriptures here.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:28 through31. It says, "And we
[49:15] know that all things work together for
[49:17] the good to them that love God,
[49:19] &gt;&gt; to them who are the called according to
[49:22] his purpose."
[49:23] &gt;&gt; So you are called according to his
[49:26] purpose.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; For whom he did predestinate, he also
[49:29] did. For whom he did forno, he did also
[49:32] predestinate to be conformed to the
[49:34] image of his son, that he might be the
[49:37] firstborn among many brethren. Moreover,
[49:38] whom he did predestinate,
[49:41] them he also called. And whom he called
[49:43] them, he also justified. And whom he
[49:46] justified, them he also glorified.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. And you
[49:54] know, just to point out, it's to them
[49:56] who are the called
[49:58] &gt;&gt; according to his purpose. And I'd like
[50:00] to read out of second Peter 1:10. We'll
[50:03] just try to move through here and just
[50:05] see how the Lord would um just break
[50:08] this out by his grace. Uh we have maybe
[50:11] a lot of highlights in here and uh we'll
[50:13] just uh uh uh see how the Lord would
[50:16] just pull this together. Second Peter 1
[50:19] and10
[50:22] for it says
[50:25] wherefore the rather brethren give
[50:27] diligence to make your calling
[50:30] &gt;&gt; and election sure
[50:32] &gt;&gt; for if you do these things you shall
[50:34] never fall. And this make means to do or
[50:37] to bring forth or to bear. And I just
[50:40] love how he goes on to say, "For an
[50:42] entrance shall be ministered unto you."
[50:44] And and he goes on to talk about how
[50:46] though we would be established in the
[50:48] present truth. And I'm just so thankful
[50:50] for a message that could come and and
[50:53] could identify who we are and and it
[50:55] could start to bring forth the very
[50:57] purpose of the seed, the predestinated
[50:59] seed that God has placed inside of us.
[51:02] And I just want to read this very
[51:04] familiar quote out of the Pergamium
[51:05] church age. And uh uh this is mentioned
[51:08] also in spoken word as the original
[51:09] seed. He says, "Jesus never did anything
[51:11] until it was first showed him by the
[51:14] father." John 5:19. This harmony is now
[51:17] to exist between the groom and his
[51:20] bride. He shows her his word of life.
[51:22] She receives it. She never doubts it.
[51:24] Therefore, nothing can harm her, not
[51:25] even death. For if the seed be planted,
[51:27] the water will raise it up again. We
[51:29] don't do we have any interpreter
[51:31] interpreting going on? I'm going to run
[51:33] then. All right. For if the seed be
[51:35] planted, the water will raise it up
[51:37] again. Here is the secret of this. The
[51:38] word is in the bride as it was in Mary.
[51:40] The bride has the mind of Christ, for
[51:42] she knows what he wants done with the
[51:44] word. She performs the command of the
[51:46] word in his name. For she has thus
[51:48] sayith the Lord. Then the word is
[51:49] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[51:51] pass. Like a seed that is planted in
[51:54] water, it comes to full harvest serving
[51:57] its purpose. And so I'm just wanting to
[51:59] maybe lay in there that you have a
[52:02] purpose. You have a calling. And we want
[52:04] to know what is that purpose? What what
[52:06] is that calling? I I I want to serve it
[52:09] just like a a seed that is planted
[52:11] within that seed is the power of
[52:13] transformation to become what it was
[52:16] predestinated to be. And pro the prophet
[52:19] would say this. He said you are nothing
[52:20] but the manifestation of the gene of
[52:24] life that was in God. And I say I want
[52:26] to express his life. I want to express
[52:28] his attributes. I want to express his
[52:31] purpose.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; You know, and I was just thinking about
[52:33] like Moses, you know, he was born for a
[52:36] purpose. He was born to fulfill
[52:38] prophecy. And and and you know, as
[52:40] unqualified as Moses felt and as as
[52:43] incapable as Moses felt, he would use
[52:46] all of his excuses and I'm not able, I
[52:49] can't speak, I can't go. Well, what
[52:51] happens if this and what happens with
[52:52] that? Well, and the Lord kept telling
[52:54] him, I I Well, you know, I I I'll I'll
[52:56] give you Aaron and Well, what happens if
[52:58] I go and and they don't believe me?
[53:00] Well, I'll be with you. Well, what
[53:01] happens if they don't receive me? Well,
[53:03] what is that you got in your hand? Every
[53:05] excuse that Moses could try to bring up
[53:08] and say, "Lord, I'm not able. I'm not
[53:10] capable. I can't do it." God kept
[53:12] telling him over and over, "I've called
[53:14] you. I've elected you. I've chose you.
[53:16] You were born for this purpose." And I
[53:18] say, "Oh church, when we recognize that
[53:20] you were born for a purpose, regardless
[53:22] of your insufficiencies, regardless of
[53:24] your ability, regardless of your faults
[53:26] and failures and how many times you
[53:28] tried, I don't care if you've come to
[53:30] the altar a million times and you've
[53:31] walked back out there in sin." God comes
[53:33] back and he tells you, "I've ordained
[53:35] you. I've called you. I've elected you.
[53:37] You are my bride. You're going to go in
[53:39] a rapture. You will put every devil
[53:41] under your feet because you ordained.
[53:43] You are elected. You are called. You are
[53:46] bone of my bone. You are flesh of my
[53:48] flesh. You can't do the greater works.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; But Lord, I'm a failure. I I can't do
[53:54] this. And what does he come right back
[53:55] around and do?
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Tells you again
[53:59] &gt;&gt; over and over and over.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; And I just want to say that Moses was
[54:04] what God
[54:06] made him.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; You are what God made you.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; So many times we look at what we can do.
[54:14] We look at our our abilities.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you, he's Jehovah
[54:18] Gyra.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; He is able to provide for himself.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Isaac said, "Oh, oh Abraham, oh father,
[54:27] where is that ram going to come from?"
[54:29] He said, "All I know, son, he's Jehovah
[54:32] Gyra. He will provide for himself. Where
[54:35] is there going to come a bride without
[54:37] spot or wrinkle? He is Jehovah Gyra. He
[54:40] can speak a bride into existence. How is
[54:43] there going to be a mighty invincible
[54:45] army rise up and do the great works? He
[54:47] is Jehovah Gyra. He will provide for
[54:51] himself.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; And I say that same one is here amongst
[54:56] us tonight.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah Gyra.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; He will provide for himself.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; He'll provide himself a bride.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says this in why
[55:13] Christ speak. He says, "And when Moses
[55:14] saw that he was raised up for this
[55:17] purpose and he had met face to face this
[55:20] great God who had made the call."
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Now God's calling you. We want to meet
[55:24] the God who's making the call. I say,
[55:26] "We got an opportunity this weekend.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; You you might there might be something
[55:30] in your heart that believes just like
[55:32] Moses. Uh uh uh the prophet of God would
[55:34] say Moses had intellectual faith. He
[55:36] knew he was born for a purpose. He was
[55:38] born his me he had message believing
[55:40] parents that told him, "Hey, you were
[55:42] born for a purpose. We're going in a
[55:43] rapture. You're going in a bride. You
[55:45] can do the greater works." He listened
[55:46] to tapes. He sat on the church pews. But
[55:49] the prophet of God said he had
[55:50] intellectual faith. But there came a day
[55:52] out on the back side of the desert that
[55:54] the one was calling and was caught up in
[55:56] a burning bush. And he said, "Moses,
[55:58] you're standing on holy ground. I say
[56:00] he's Jehovah Gyra. He is right here
[56:03] tonight. The burning bush is present
[56:05] amongst us. If you want an audience with
[56:07] your creator, I say Christ Jesus is here
[56:10] to speak to you and your time and need
[56:13] to show you that you are called, you are
[56:15] ordained, you are elected.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; He said when he met this God face to
[56:24] face, this great God who made the call
[56:26] and had anointed him and identified him,
[56:30] &gt;&gt; I say, is there somebody here that wants
[56:31] to be anointed and identified? Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is your call, Moses.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; I'm sending you. I'm going to show you
[56:38] my glory."
[56:40] &gt;&gt; And here I am in a bush burning. Go down
[56:42] there. I'll be with you. He didn't even
[56:44] need a stick.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; He had the word,
[56:48] &gt;&gt; the vindicated word.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; And there he went. It anointed the faith
[56:52] that was in him. And the prophet of God
[56:53] said, "Oh, it anoints us when we see
[56:57] that we're living in the last days."
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just coming to my inspiration
[57:02] here. Out of the trial, Brother Brandham
[57:05] says this. I challenge you to believe
[57:09] that Jesus Christ is revealed in the
[57:12] form of son of man
[57:15] &gt;&gt; in human flesh.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll just uh say this out there. If
[57:19] you go look it up on the table, it'll
[57:21] say through. But if you listen to it, he
[57:23] says in. I I I just I like it to be in.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; In because I'm a participation. That's
[57:30] me. He's talking about I challenge you
[57:33] because we I don't have time to go into
[57:35] the trial, but he's there at, you know,
[57:37] he he said he didn't get a fair trial in
[57:39] the at at the first time. And here comes
[57:42] a vindicated prophet. I'm going to give
[57:43] him a fair trial. And he shows beyond
[57:45] infallible evidences that he's the same
[57:48] yesterday, today, and forever. And he
[57:50] stood there discerning the thoughts and
[57:52] intents of the hearts. And then he says,
[57:53] "I challenge you to believe that Jesus
[57:56] Christ is revealed in the form of the
[57:59] Son of Man in
[58:00] &gt;&gt; human flesh, in the bride's body."
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Accept his call.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; That's what I'd like to minister to you
[58:09] this evening by the help of God.
[58:12] Accept his call.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; I believe that that is our purpose. That
[58:17] Christ,
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; would be revealed in human flesh.
[58:23] in your body,
[58:25] &gt;&gt; in your life,
[58:27] &gt;&gt; in your marriage,
[58:29] &gt;&gt; and your family.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Let let's let's just not leave it out
[58:34] there generic.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4:5.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, the the collective bride body. No,
[58:40] &gt;&gt; no. Because when you come to this
[58:41] message and you meet this word, you have
[58:44] to stand alone.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Accept his call.
[58:50] And I just want to say that during these
[58:51] meetings, I I believe God is is coming
[58:53] to call individuals and families to to
[58:56] restoration and to to healing and to
[58:59] deliverance and reconciliation and a and
[59:02] maybe uh men have h have have have been
[59:06] doing things they shouldn't have done
[59:07] and they they've just been laying in a a
[59:09] pit of despair and and they haven't had
[59:11] any strength or ability on on how they
[59:13] could make that right with their life.
[59:15] But I believe God is going to create a
[59:16] way uh during these meetings to to
[59:19] reconcile marriages and and to give men
[59:21] the strength and ability to lay down
[59:23] their pride and to to lay down the
[59:25] things that have been haunting them and
[59:26] to make it right with God and to be
[59:29] broken with a contrite spirit and his
[59:31] presence and be able to go to a to to
[59:34] his family and to be you know what I
[59:36] haven't been the father that I've wanted
[59:37] to be. I I really haven't been the
[59:39] believer that I wanted to be. But oh,
[59:41] I've met Jehovah. He's dealing with my
[59:43] heart. He's the I saved church. We got
[59:46] to lay down our pride. We We got to come
[59:48] to him in some humility and and meekness
[59:50] and fear and trembling and say, "Look, I
[59:53] really don't got it all figured out. I
[59:55] can quote the quotes and I can tell you
[59:56] the sermons and I can say all these
[59:58] things, but oh, I need to be walking
[1:00:00] with Jehovah. I Lord, I need another
[1:00:02] refilling of the Holy Ghost. Lord, bring
[1:00:05] back my joy. Restore the joy of my
[1:00:08] salvation. Lord, I just don't want it to
[1:00:10] be some good meetings and they and they
[1:00:12] go back by and I'm I'm back down in the
[1:00:14] ditch and I'm back over there. Lord, I
[1:00:15] need a real change.
[1:00:17] [Applause]
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; I believe God is is going to call.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; And I just believe in opening these
[1:00:27] meetings, my heart's cry to you. Accept
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; his call.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to accept your call. I I I
[1:00:39] want to accept
[1:00:40] my position. I want to accept
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; my calling. Lord, I I want to be a
[1:00:46] placed son, and an adopted son. I I I I
[1:00:51] don't want to just be up and down and
[1:00:53] topsyturvy all the time. You know, Jesus
[1:00:56] would say, "Except a man be born again,
[1:00:58] he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Except a man see, except a man be born
[1:01:04] again, he cannot understand.
[1:01:07] That's the right word there in the in
[1:01:09] we've been taught in the translation.
[1:01:11] Except a man be born again, he cannot
[1:01:13] understand. And I say that's a good
[1:01:14] place to start the meetings off. I say
[1:01:16] except he be born again. Look, look, if
[1:01:19] if if if we get to preaching this
[1:01:21] message to a place where we leave out
[1:01:22] Calvary, I'm sorry, we've left the word.
[1:01:25] If we ever get to a place where we're so
[1:01:26] predestinated, we don't know how to
[1:01:28] preach Calvary, we don't know how to
[1:01:30] preach a bleeding bloody word, we don't
[1:01:32] need how to preach a repentance, I say,
[1:01:34] oh, I say repent. The prophet of God
[1:01:36] said that that was the that should be
[1:01:39] the zeal for the age. He said, what was
[1:01:41] it? A zeal to say I am wrong. I say we
[1:01:45] need to get some people back into the
[1:01:47] house of God that are sincere and that
[1:01:49] are able to say, you know what, I'm
[1:01:51] wrong. I was wrong. I said that about my
[1:01:54] sister. I said that about my brother. I
[1:01:56] said that about that church. I said that
[1:01:57] about that preacher. But you know what?
[1:01:59] I'm wrong. Lord, forgive me. I'm wrong.
[1:02:02] I say we ought to get back to some real
[1:02:04] repentance.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; We get so puffed up and so elevated, so
[1:02:11] high in the sky. We're so ordained, we
[1:02:14] don't even know how to repent. We don't
[1:02:16] even know how to make something right.
[1:02:17] Well, if that's just the way the brother
[1:02:19] feels, then so be it. That is not the
[1:02:21] nature of Christ. the nature of Christ.
[1:02:23] You you can be in the right. They can be
[1:02:26] dead wrong. But the nature of Christ
[1:02:28] will go to your brother and say, "I'm
[1:02:29] sorry, brother.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I'm sorry that you were
[1:02:35] offended."
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; God's calling.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; The word says in Romans 8:14, "For as
[1:02:43] many as are led by the spirit of God,
[1:02:45] they are the sons of God. For ye have
[1:02:47] not received the spirit of bondage again
[1:02:48] to fear, but you have received the
[1:02:50] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
[1:02:52] "Aba, Father." The spirit itself bears
[1:02:55] witness with our spirit, that we are the
[1:02:57] children of God. And if children,
[1:03:00] Hallelujah, than heirs,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; heirs of God and joint hes with Christ.
[1:03:05] If so be that we suffer with him, that
[1:03:07] we may also be glorified together. Is
[1:03:10] there anybody that's suffering? If you
[1:03:12] ain't suffering, well,
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; I tell you, but when you find a church
[1:03:17] that's suffering, when you find a family
[1:03:20] that's suffering, you know, they just
[1:03:21] might be right with God. Because I want
[1:03:23] to tell you, we are a persecuted church.
[1:03:26] We are sought after to be destroyed by
[1:03:28] devils. The lid of hell has been ripped
[1:03:30] off. And the devil is trying to attack
[1:03:32] your family. He's trying to attack your
[1:03:33] church. He's trying to attack your
[1:03:35] ministry.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; But if we suffer,
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; all right. Hallelujah.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; If we suffer with him, then we may also
[1:03:47] be glorified together. For I reckon that
[1:03:50] the suffering of this present time are
[1:03:52] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:03:54] which shall be revealed in us. For the
[1:03:57] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:03:59] waitth for the manifestation of the sons
[1:04:02] of God. I want to tell you, he is not
[1:04:04] dead, but he is alive forever more in
[1:04:07] his people. He is the same yesterday,
[1:04:09] today and forever. The prophet of God
[1:04:11] said his messianic anointed ones believe
[1:04:13] that. What is the Messiah? What is the
[1:04:16] Messiah? Messiah is anointed one. And
[1:04:18] now if he was the Messiah by being the
[1:04:20] anointed one for that day to fulfill the
[1:04:22] word of God to be the redeemer and the
[1:04:24] anointed one. And God raised up that
[1:04:27] body, his bride is the anointed one for
[1:04:30] this day. It's already raised with him.
[1:04:32] It's the resurrected because these two
[1:04:35] are one. I want to tell you this message
[1:04:37] is more than belt buckles. This message
[1:04:39] is more than good sermons. This message
[1:04:41] is more than I'm better than Pentecost.
[1:04:44] This message is more than look at our
[1:04:46] church and look at that preacher. This
[1:04:48] message is the very invisible union of
[1:04:50] Christ, the capstone coming down and
[1:04:53] taking on union and flesh with a people.
[1:04:57] And just as he was anointed in that day
[1:05:00] to fulfill every word, this bride is
[1:05:02] anointed to fulfill every word that was
[1:05:05] spoken by the son of man.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Accept his call.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; God wants to take individuals
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; and prove to Satan
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; that as God was in the body of Christ,
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; he is now in the bride. In the body of
[1:05:25] the bride. Yes,
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; don't put that off for somebody else.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, the prophet said in invisible union,
[1:05:34] he said, "Oh, the spiritual union of
[1:05:36] Christ and his church now when the flesh
[1:05:38] is becoming word and the word is
[1:05:40] becoming flesh manifested, vindicated,
[1:05:43] just what the bride said would happen.
[1:05:45] Just what the Bible said would happen in
[1:05:47] this day. It's happening day by day.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; You might not feel like it. You might
[1:05:54] not see it. But I want to tell you, if
[1:05:56] you are walking with this word day by
[1:05:59] day,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; look, you are predestinated to meet the
[1:06:04] challenge of the age.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "This bride is not
[1:06:09] spoiling and breaking our scars for no
[1:06:11] man."
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to preach to accept his call.
[1:06:16] If it if it's gotten familiar to you,
[1:06:18] well, let's just act like you ain't
[1:06:20] never heard it again. Because what we've
[1:06:22] done is we've made rituals and
[1:06:24] traditions and we've heard it so many
[1:06:26] times it just becomes knowledge and we
[1:06:28] get puffed up. But I say, "Oh God, give
[1:06:30] me more than a man's knowledge of it.
[1:06:33] Give me a revelation."
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you that you are
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; that word that was prophesied.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will have a bride without
[1:06:45] blemish. I will have a bride without
[1:06:47] spot. I will have a bride without
[1:06:49] wrinkle." I want to tell you, you are
[1:06:51] that spoken word. You are prophecy being
[1:06:55] fulfilled. The devil tells you, not you.
[1:06:58] It's too late. You failed too many
[1:07:00] times. You've gone to church for so many
[1:07:02] years and you done messed up. You made a
[1:07:05] mess of your marriage. You made a mess
[1:07:06] of your testimony. Oh, I want to tell
[1:07:09] you something that my Bible says in
[1:07:12] Romans 9, it says, "For the children
[1:07:14] being not yet born,
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; neither having done any good or evil,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; it ain't the good you do, and it ain't
[1:07:23] the bad that you do."
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; That the purpose of God,
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your purpose.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your calling.
[1:07:38] Come on.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; That the purpose of God according to
[1:07:41] election might stand not of works,
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; but of him that
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; calleth.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Can you hear your name?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Can you hear him calling?
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; I say he's calling you tonight. He's
[1:07:57] going to be calling you throughout these
[1:07:58] meetings. I say accept his call.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Who me? Yeah, you. Gideon.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; What? Who am I? If God be God, where are
[1:08:09] all the miracles? What can I do?
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; But what'd he say? Thou mighty man of
[1:08:16] valor. He didn't look like a mighty man
[1:08:19] of valor. He didn't feel like a mighty
[1:08:21] man of valor. But I want to ask you,
[1:08:23] what was he?
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Because capital L,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; capital O, capital R, capital D said you
[1:08:32] are. I don't want to say capital L,
[1:08:34] capital O, capital R, capital D has
[1:08:38] descended in the lady age to call a
[1:08:41] pride out of Ladyia and say you are bone
[1:08:44] of my bone. You are flesh of my flesh. I
[1:08:47] don't feel like it. I don't look like
[1:08:49] it. Could I be me? Yes, it's you.
[1:08:52] Because I said you are.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, you are what he made
[1:08:59] you. And God is calling to you. I say
[1:09:03] accept his call.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "And have not I
[1:09:09] sent thee." He said, "Good to see you,
[1:09:11] Brother David, Sister Julia. I'm glad
[1:09:12] you made it." And when he spoke to
[1:09:14] Gideon, Gideon was a little surprised.
[1:09:15] He said, "Now, mighty man of valor,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; he didn't know he was.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't know you are.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; You might be many of those mighty men of
[1:09:28] valor tonight sitting here. You say the
[1:09:30] little church,
[1:09:33] small group. Oh my, there was only two
[1:09:36] there.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Him and his daddy. There only has to be
[1:09:40] two here. You and Christ.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; That's all it takes to be a mighty man
[1:09:46] of valor.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm starting to feel pretty good.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; You mean it's not about all the good I
[1:09:52] did. It's not about all the bad I did.
[1:09:54] It's not about if I can overcome this
[1:09:56] and I can overcome that, but if I can
[1:09:58] recognize that Christ is here and he's
[1:10:00] calling me and he's telling me, "My son,
[1:10:02] you are a mighty man of valor. You can
[1:10:05] do the greater works." I say, "Oh God,
[1:10:06] more than anything, may there be a
[1:10:08] revelation strike this church that we
[1:10:10] recognize we are standing in your
[1:10:12] presence and you are the same yesterday,
[1:10:14] today, and forever. You are still
[1:10:16] calling. Your voice is still sounding
[1:10:18] out. You are still calling your bride.
[1:10:20] You're still calling yours to
[1:10:22] repentance. You're still calling them
[1:10:23] and sanctifying them and justifying them
[1:10:26] and filling them with the Holy Ghost. I
[1:10:27] say accept his call.
[1:10:32] [Applause]
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; God is still speaking. He's still
[1:10:36] calling.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Well, we look into our Bibles and we see
[1:10:39] in Genesis 12 when the Lord called
[1:10:41] Abraham,
[1:10:42] it was God's election. He was speaking
[1:10:46] to bring forth something
[1:10:48] that was in his thoughts.
[1:10:50] I want you to understand when when God
[1:10:52] started to call Abraham, we have to know
[1:10:55] that God knew right where Abraham is. He
[1:10:57] knew right when he would be born. A
[1:10:58] matter of fact, he protected the
[1:11:00] seedline since Adam to make sure Abraham
[1:11:02] would be right there at that time and
[1:11:05] then he would come. And it wasn't so
[1:11:06] much that he was calling, he was
[1:11:08] speaking,
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; something that was in his mind to now
[1:11:13] come into manifestation.
[1:11:17] Just as the scripture would say in
[1:11:19] Genesis 12:28, he said, "And I
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; will make thee a great nation,
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; and I will bless thee
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; and make thy name great, and thou shalt
[1:11:29] be a blessing."
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; There there was nothing in there where
[1:11:33] he said, "I will if you do."
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Abraham, I will. It was an
[1:11:42] unconditional covenant. God said, "I
[1:11:44] will make you a mighty nation. I will
[1:11:47] number your seed as the stars." It was
[1:11:49] something that was in the mind of God
[1:11:52] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:11:53] now, he was calling for the
[1:11:56] manifestation of what was already in his
[1:11:59] mind. Oh, don't you see why you're
[1:12:01] sitting here this evening? God was
[1:12:03] calling for an expression of something
[1:12:05] that had been in his mind. And he's been
[1:12:07] waiting through seven church ages to
[1:12:09] have a bride without spot or wrinkle.
[1:12:11] And right here in Pontie, Oklahoma, she
[1:12:15] stands here tonight. The vindicated
[1:12:17] word.
[1:12:19] I said the vindicated word. You are the
[1:12:22] vindication of the message of the hour.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Because you're anointed messiahs.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; You are the word made flesh.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say it was just like in the
[1:12:35] beginning when God said, "Let there be
[1:12:37] light." Right?
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; He was calling for something that was in
[1:12:41] his mind to be manifested.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; And God knows how to take the the
[1:12:46] darkness and the confusion and the chaos
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; that's in your life.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Maybe something he says, "I know I'm a
[1:12:52] son of God. I know I was predestinated.
[1:12:54] I believe this message, but I just can't
[1:12:56] live it. I've tried over and over and I
[1:12:58] go back and I fall and I pick back up
[1:13:00] music and I pick back up habits and I I
[1:13:02] just can't ever seem to get the
[1:13:04] victory." Well, I want to tell you, God
[1:13:05] is here.
[1:13:07] He's bruting now out over your life. I
[1:13:09] want to say, why are you still here? Cuz
[1:13:11] he's been keeping you. You would have
[1:13:13] thrown in the towel a long time ago, but
[1:13:15] for some reason, you're still here.
[1:13:17] Maybe you're at home and you're
[1:13:18] streaming. You're still listening
[1:13:20] because I believe God is pruding out
[1:13:22] over your life. He's still calling.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; I say, why don't you accept his call
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; and let the light of God's word start
[1:13:32] driving the darkness out of your life?
[1:13:36] drive the darkness and the confusion of
[1:13:38] of the things that you're going through.
[1:13:40] I want to say the sen light is here.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; The manifested word is here to start
[1:13:45] dealing with your trial,
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; to start dealing with your family
[1:13:48] situations.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Start dealing with your life and your
[1:13:52] private life and the things that you've
[1:13:54] been doing and the things that you've
[1:13:56] just made a a truce. Okay, fine.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; You know, I'll just do a little bit, but
[1:14:01] this is just the way it's going to be.
[1:14:03] No, God is calling you to total victory.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; God is calling you to total deliverance.
[1:14:08] God is calling you to total separation.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; God is calling you to a total filling of
[1:14:14] the Holy Ghost. And I just want to say
[1:14:16] just as as Abraham was and just as God
[1:14:18] brooded out over the earth, you are that
[1:14:21] predestinated seed that was
[1:14:22] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:14:24] the world to what? Be fashioned into his
[1:14:26] image.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; What does the scripture say? It says, "I
[1:14:30] know my thoughts that I think toward
[1:14:31] you. Not thoughts of evil, but thoughts
[1:14:34] of peace. What? To bring you to an
[1:14:36] expected end. Now, I want to say this
[1:14:39] out of the masterpiece. He says, this is
[1:14:41] speaking about you. Look, I'm hitting
[1:14:42] some high points because this is the
[1:14:44] call of God in your life that he has
[1:14:46] called you to for a purpose that you are
[1:14:48] the word living and action. The Bible
[1:14:50] bride, not some man-made bride. The
[1:14:53] Bible bride, smitten and afflicted of
[1:14:54] God. No beauty would would we desire
[1:14:56] her, but yet we did esteem her smitten
[1:14:59] and afflicted of God. That's right. She
[1:15:01] stands alone.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; She is smitten from all the
[1:15:04] denominations according to Revelations
[1:15:06] 3. She is smitten out of the lady.
[1:15:08] You'll see a church age that she was
[1:15:10] raised up in. I want to say if she was
[1:15:12] smitten out of the lady you'll see a
[1:15:14] church age, then I want to ask you where
[1:15:15] is she?
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; I said if she was smitten out of a lady
[1:15:19] you'll see a church age. I want to ask
[1:15:21] you where is she? She is seated in
[1:15:23] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. She is
[1:15:26] in an eagle age. She is in a pride age.
[1:15:28] This is bride time. This is eagle time.
[1:15:31] This is seat time. This ain't time to
[1:15:33] back up. This ain't time to sit down.
[1:15:36] This is time to go in a rapture. This is
[1:15:38] a time to get your family. This is a
[1:15:40] time to get your neighbors. This is a
[1:15:41] time to possess your vessels and
[1:15:43] sanctification and honor because we are
[1:15:46] going in a rapture.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said she, the bride, is
[1:15:53] an independent from all others. She's an
[1:15:55] independent woman, a great speckled
[1:15:57] bird. That's the difference from all
[1:15:59] others. She has his name. She has his
[1:16:02] life.
[1:16:03] [Applause]
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Look, this this bride don't need no man
[1:16:06] to tell her how high she can go.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; She don't need no man to tell her how to
[1:16:10] preach. She don't need no man to tell
[1:16:12] her how to worship. He don't she don't
[1:16:14] need no man to tell her how to sing.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said his eagllets, his
[1:16:23] messiahs, they look like him. They act
[1:16:25] like him. They preach like him. They do
[1:16:28] the works that he did.
[1:16:29] [Applause]
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we are spiritual
[1:16:33] astronauts.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, I'm above the
[1:16:38] arguing.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and fuss and fight down in the
[1:16:42] airplane age and down in the automobile
[1:16:44] age and keep fussing about our ABCs and
[1:16:47] how we should worship and and if we
[1:16:49] should get excited or if we shouldn't
[1:16:51] get excited. You go ahead and fuss all
[1:16:53] you want to. But I'm somewhere up in the
[1:16:55] heavenlies. I'm an astronaut. I'm in
[1:16:58] heavenly places in Christ Jesus in an
[1:17:01] invisible union. I know how to worship
[1:17:03] my God. I know how to preach like my God
[1:17:06] wants me to preach. I know what music to
[1:17:08] listen to. I know how to dress.
[1:17:13] There is no limits to how high you can
[1:17:15] go. Men try to put limits on. Malachi
[1:17:18] 4:5 took the limits off.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; If you can believe for it, you can have
[1:17:24] it.
[1:17:26] Hallelujah.
[1:17:32] Paul said in Colossians 3:1, "If then be
[1:17:35] risen with Christ, if ye then be risen
[1:17:38] with Christ,
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; seek those things which are above,
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; where Christ siteth on the right hand of
[1:17:45] God.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Set your affections
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; on things above,
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; not on the things of this earth.
[1:17:57] Men want to fuss and fight in these
[1:17:59] atmospheres of airplanes and automobiles
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; looking back to what the church was
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; fighting about these things. But my
[1:18:07] prophet said we're astronauts.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; We're beyond that.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Let's go on. Christ said so. I want to
[1:18:16] say if the same spirit that raised up
[1:18:19] Jesus Christ from the dead
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; dwell in you, it will also quicken your
[1:18:24] mortal body. I want to say not just
[1:18:26] then. I know there's coming a quickening
[1:18:29] in the final adoption phase of the the
[1:18:31] transformation of our body. But right
[1:18:33] now, ye are quickened. Now, ye are the
[1:18:38] sons of God.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; I said, right now, ye are the sons of
[1:18:42] God. Now we are the sons of God. Now we
[1:18:46] are redeemed. Not then.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Now prophet of God said in rising the
[1:18:52] sun, he said upon this rock I'll build
[1:18:54] my church and the gates of hell can't
[1:18:55] prevail against it. And I give unto the
[1:18:57] keys to you. Whatever you bind on earth,
[1:18:59] I'll bind in heaven. And whatsoever you
[1:19:01] loose on earth, that's the divine
[1:19:04] revelation of the word made flesh.
[1:19:06] If it was flesh in that day by the son,
[1:19:09] the groom, it's the flesh today by the
[1:19:12] bride. See, whatsoever sin you remit to
[1:19:15] them, they are remitted. Whosoever sin
[1:19:17] you retain to them, they are retained.
[1:19:18] He said it's not through a church
[1:19:20] system. It's not through some preacher.
[1:19:22] It's not through some bishop. He said
[1:19:24] it's through the spiritual revealed word
[1:19:26] that does it. Oh, I believe God is
[1:19:27] calling to you tonight and through these
[1:19:29] meetings that we would catch a greater
[1:19:31] revelation, a revelation of the
[1:19:33] spiritual revealed word. Amen.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; I say he is calling to you.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Let there be. It's a call to
[1:19:44] righteousness. It's a call to holiness.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; It's a call to look. It's a call to the
[1:19:50] fruits of the spirit.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; It's a call to the stature of a perfect
[1:19:54] man.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; So many times we get focused on all the
[1:19:58] other things and we want to do all the
[1:20:00] big things and and we want the spiritual
[1:20:01] gifts and everything. And I say, "But
[1:20:03] what about the stature of a perfect man
[1:20:05] that you be built up just like Jesus
[1:20:07] Christ?" I say, "God, I hear your
[1:20:09] calling to me, Lord. I want more faith.
[1:20:11] I want more temperance. I want more
[1:20:13] virtue. I want more godliness. I want
[1:20:14] more brotherly kindness, Lord. That that
[1:20:16] capstone of love by the Holy Ghost can
[1:20:18] just settle down upon my life.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; I say he's calling to you."
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; And and I just for a moment, I just want
[1:20:28] to lay this in there. You know, the
[1:20:31] scripture says, you know, uh uh leave
[1:20:33] those things which are behind behind and
[1:20:34] press toward the mark of a high calling.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we we get this idea or
[1:20:40] something in our head that that seems
[1:20:41] like the very word that we're preaching,
[1:20:43] it's just so far off somewhere in the
[1:20:45] heavenlies and and we see how the word
[1:20:47] was manifested in Malachi 4:5 and and we
[1:20:50] just go back and like I'm raising kids.
[1:20:52] I'm a wife at home. I'm doing clothes.
[1:20:54] How can that ever be me? You know, I I
[1:20:56] got a 9 to5. I work at Taco Bell and and
[1:20:59] and I barely can pay my rent and and how
[1:21:02] how could that's so far up in the
[1:21:03] heavenlies. No, God wants to take
[1:21:05] somebody like you.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; He wants to take the wash woman. Come
[1:21:09] on. There's too many stories of the wash
[1:21:11] woman or the woman at the well or some
[1:21:13] harlot or some Rahab or some some
[1:21:15] insignificant Gideon. God wants to take
[1:21:17] nobodies and make them somebody. He
[1:21:19] wants to take somebody that doesn't
[1:21:21] think nothing of himself and is able to
[1:21:23] say, "Oh God, I need you more than I've
[1:21:25] ever needed you before. I've tried to be
[1:21:27] religious. I've tried to serve you. But
[1:21:29] in my own efforts, I failed you, oh God.
[1:21:31] But I'm here to repent and lay it all
[1:21:33] down. I hear your call, Lord. Fill me
[1:21:35] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "Don't look at what
[1:21:45] you were.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Look what you're going to be."
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; So, why don't we just take a moment
[1:21:53] there? I want to say if you can't see it
[1:21:55] now,
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; I want you to at least see what's
[1:21:59] coming.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Watch out, devil.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes it's hard to accept it
[1:22:06] right now. Present tense,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; but he's called for it.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; And there ain't no demon in hell that
[1:22:12] can stop it.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; There's no Red Sea. There's no trial.
[1:22:16] There's no Pharaoh.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; There's no army.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; There's no Jordan. There's nothing.
[1:22:22] There ain't no plague, no sickness.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; He's called for it.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; But sometimes it's like, oh, who me?
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to just say, okay, if you
[1:22:32] can't see it now, then let's just see
[1:22:35] what's coming. Because what is a sheath
[1:22:38] wave? It's a first one
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; that comes to maturity. What is it
[1:22:43] testifying of? It's testifying of all
[1:22:45] the wheat that's in the field.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; So then we can see not not I wasn't
[1:22:50] there in the meetings. I I I wasn't
[1:22:52] there to to to to to stand in the
[1:22:54] meetings or or to see the prayer lines,
[1:22:56] but I see by faith a first one to
[1:23:00] maturity that what this word that was
[1:23:02] prophesied to be in this day, how it
[1:23:04] would act and how it would look and how
[1:23:07] it would conduct itself in somebody's
[1:23:10] life. Now look, I want to tell you, we
[1:23:12] are past the days of trying to wear the
[1:23:13] belt buckles. We are past the days of
[1:23:16] trying to imitate his mannerisms. We are
[1:23:18] past the day. Look, look, that was back
[1:23:20] in the 70s where everybody wanted to
[1:23:21] carry their Bible like and I don't blame
[1:23:23] him for it because they saw Christ in
[1:23:25] the individual. But Christ wants to be
[1:23:27] in you and your life in Pontie,
[1:23:29] Oklahoma. He wants a southern draw. If
[1:23:32] you're German, he wants a German draw.
[1:23:34] If you're Texan, he wants to say howdy.
[1:23:36] God bless you. He don't want you to try
[1:23:38] to talk and walk like everybody else. He
[1:23:40] wants to get in your skin. He wants to
[1:23:42] get in your body. He wants to borrow
[1:23:44] your flesh. He wants to come in a union
[1:23:47] and use your accent,
[1:23:49] use your neighborhood, use your
[1:23:51] profession
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; to be the living word made manifest.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; We've seen a first one to maturity.
[1:24:08] As the prophet would say in the bride
[1:24:10] coming of Christ,
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; a coming out of the church age, he says,
[1:24:14] "There has to be another one waved over
[1:24:16] the people."
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; And I like this. He says, "I'm sure you
[1:24:19] see what I'm talking about."
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; And all the believers say, "Amen."
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Just as what? The sheath wave, Christ,
[1:24:27] the word made flesh was waved over the
[1:24:31] people on Calvary, he was waved back
[1:24:33] over the people on the day of Pentecost.
[1:24:36] But he said, "There's coming a time, a
[1:24:38] resurrection in the end time that the
[1:24:40] word made flesh will be waved back over
[1:24:42] the people again." It was the bride. It
[1:24:45] was Christ coming in the form of the son
[1:24:47] of man. But Christ has come again and a
[1:24:50] son of man ministry. But it was a bride
[1:24:52] member who was the first one to maturity
[1:24:55] testifying to the whole bride. You, this
[1:24:57] is what's coming.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; If you can't see it now, I want to tell
[1:25:01] you it's coming. You can do the greater
[1:25:04] work. You are that invincible army. You
[1:25:06] can't put every devil under your feet.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "Hallelujah. I sure
[1:25:16] you see what I'm talking about. Look,
[1:25:18] we're going to keep running. I'm sure
[1:25:19] you see what I'm talking about. It was
[1:25:21] waved over the people in the first time
[1:25:23] there will come forth for a bright age
[1:25:25] for resurrection out of dark
[1:25:26] denominations will be a message that the
[1:25:29] full maturity of the word has turned
[1:25:32] back again in its full power. Look, quit
[1:25:34] trying to water it down. Quit trying to
[1:25:36] weaken. It's it's in its full power
[1:25:39] being waved over the people by the same
[1:25:41] signs and same wonders that he did back
[1:25:44] there. Because I live also.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Because I live, ye live also.
[1:25:50] speaking to
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; his wife.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Because I live, ye live also. What a
[1:25:56] resurrection that was. And what a
[1:25:58] resurrection this is. To be quickened
[1:26:00] from the dead, to be made alive in
[1:26:02] Christ Jesus by God's quickening power.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Look, I haven't lost my mind. I know
[1:26:08] what I'm talking about. I was out there
[1:26:10] in the dark ditches of sin. I was out
[1:26:12] there in the doom and gloom of Lady
[1:26:14] Osia. But God rich in mercy, he called
[1:26:17] out to my name, said, "Son, you don't
[1:26:19] belong down there in the chicken yard.
[1:26:21] You don't belong out down out there in
[1:26:22] the drug house.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Who me?"
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, you, son.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Come up higher.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Come up out of the chicken yard. Come up
[1:26:34] out of your confusion. Come up out of
[1:26:36] your hurt.
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Paul said in Romans 4:19, "And being not
[1:26:42] weak in faith." Look, I'm trying to say
[1:26:43] like this. If you can't see what you are
[1:26:46] now, at least see what's coming.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; I say at least get happy about that.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; I might not be putting every devil under
[1:26:54] my feet right now, but guess what?
[1:26:56] Hallelujah. I am going to put every
[1:26:59] devil under my feet. Sickness is going
[1:27:01] under my feet. Death is going under my
[1:27:03] feet. Pornography. I don't care what
[1:27:06] you're going through. Why don't you
[1:27:07] start speaking the word? Darkness,
[1:27:09] demons, depression.
[1:27:12] I don't care what it is. If you got some
[1:27:14] nervous type of feeling that's been
[1:27:16] tearing you out. Why did you speak out?
[1:27:18] I'm going to put that devil under my
[1:27:20] feet. I hear his call and he has come to
[1:27:23] anoint me. I am a messiah.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; I was born for a purpose. I was born to
[1:27:30] be a devil defeating demon stopping.
[1:27:33] Born of the Holy Ghost child of God.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; I know who I am.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; And I am what I am by the grace of God.
[1:27:43] Amen.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; God's quickening power
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; and being not weak in faith.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Let's not be weak in faith.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; He considered not his own body now dead.
[1:28:01] when he was about a hundred years old,
[1:28:03] neither yet the deadness of 100 years
[1:28:06] old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[1:28:08] womb. He staggered not
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; at the promise of God through unbelief,
[1:28:13] but he was strong in faith.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Saying maybe, possibly,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; you know, I think I'm elected. Think I'm
[1:28:25] going in the rapture.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe God will give me another
[1:28:29] handmade. But even I can't even do it
[1:28:31] now. That won't work. No. My Bible says
[1:28:35] he staggered not at the promise. I I I
[1:28:38] want to say this. Did God give you the
[1:28:40] promise?
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Then I want to tell you, we have a
[1:28:43] pattern in our Bible that the disciples
[1:28:46] were in the upper room
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; and they were praising God for the
[1:28:52] promise. They were just excited
[1:28:55] about having received the promise as
[1:28:58] they were to re receive the fulfillment
[1:29:00] of it.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; My prophet said they were in the upper
[1:29:02] room praising God for the promise. I
[1:29:05] want to tell you, stagger not. If God
[1:29:07] has given you a promise, stagger not
[1:29:09] through unbelief, but be strong in
[1:29:11] faith, giving glory unto God.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; I am going in a rapture. Yes.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; My body will be changed.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; My girls will be saved.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; My boy will be born again. I will be
[1:29:30] healed. I'm taking my mama with me. I'm
[1:29:33] taking my daddy with me. I'm taking my
[1:29:36] brother with me. I'm taking my I don't
[1:29:38] have a halfway religion. I'm going all
[1:29:41] the way. And I ain't leaving a hoof
[1:29:43] behind. I'm gonna fight for my brothers.
[1:29:46] I'm going to fight for my sisters. I'm
[1:29:48] going to start professing the word of
[1:29:50] the Lord. I can do all things through
[1:29:52] Jesus Christ that strengthens me.
[1:29:55] Greater is he that is in me than that
[1:29:57] cancer. Greater is he that is in me than
[1:30:00] that depression. Greater is he that is
[1:30:02] in me than that anxiety.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Hey, that's what's coming.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Get ready for it.
[1:30:14] Prophet of God said, "No circumstance
[1:30:18] will be considered when faith finds its
[1:30:20] betting ground."
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Here's the bedding ground, Lord.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Look, friends, I I am not screaming and
[1:30:33] shouting
[1:30:35] to work something up.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; I get excited.
[1:30:40] I scream and shout because something has
[1:30:43] come down.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Some people just can't see it.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Some people can't see the capstone.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Some people can't see capital L, capital
[1:30:58] O, capital R, capital D standing the
[1:31:00] same yesterday, today, and forever
[1:31:01] before us.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Look, I've been called a fanatic.
[1:31:06] I've been made fun of. Come on. I
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; I've had people call me names, but you
[1:31:11] know, just like my prophet said, a
[1:31:13] matter of fact, I brought it out here.
[1:31:14] Just like my prophet said about that
[1:31:16] calf that come out of that stall, had
[1:31:18] his big old barns and his concrete
[1:31:20] floors and he he got out there and and
[1:31:22] looked through the the crack in the
[1:31:24] fence and he saw all the screaming and
[1:31:26] shouting. He saw that calf out there
[1:31:28] kicking up his heels. He said, "What was
[1:31:29] it?" It was the spiritual vitamins. He
[1:31:32] might not have had a big church. He
[1:31:33] might not have had all the things of
[1:31:35] Lady Osia, but what did he have? He had
[1:31:36] the spiritual vitamins of the revealed
[1:31:38] word. And the prophet of God said, "And
[1:31:40] when a man is filled with the Holy
[1:31:42] Ghost, there is something in him that's
[1:31:44] full of God's spiritual vitamins makes
[1:31:46] him praise God, shout and act
[1:31:49] different." Because why? He is no longer
[1:31:51] earthbound. He's in heavenly places,
[1:31:54] sailing around in heavenly places in
[1:31:56] Christ Jesus. Well, you want to know
[1:31:58] what the matter of me is? I'm in
[1:32:00] heavenly places. I'm an astronaut. I am
[1:32:03] not earthbound any longer. I am soaring
[1:32:06] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; I'm shouting and acting up because
[1:32:11] something has come down. The capstone
[1:32:14] has come crying grace, grace. Oh, I said
[1:32:17] it's amazing grace. Do you know grace?
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; He said you're free.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but do you Does
[1:32:27] anybody here know what it's like to be
[1:32:29] bound in sin? Does anybody here know
[1:32:31] what it's like to be bound in
[1:32:33] denominational tombstones and then have
[1:32:35] the Lord Jesus Christ come to you and
[1:32:37] say, "You're free.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; You're free." I believe God is calling
[1:32:42] to individuals during this meeting. Go
[1:32:44] ahead and come out of your prison.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and come out of your darkness.
[1:32:48] Go ahead and walk out of that darkness.
[1:32:50] Go ahead and walk out of that confusion.
[1:32:51] You don't belong down there in the
[1:32:53] chicken yard. Come up higher. I am here
[1:32:55] to set you free. You are loosed. You are
[1:32:59] free.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, preacher?
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; There is therefore now no condemnation
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man whom the Lord will
[1:33:14] not impute sin.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about accepting his call.
[1:33:19] Now,
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; I know I've hit a billion points,
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; but something by God's grace laying in
[1:33:26] there, I want you to accept
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; his call.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Call to righteousness, a call to
[1:33:30] holiness, a call to separation, a call
[1:33:33] to be,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; a call to be the very word made manifest
[1:33:40] in you,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; a Messiah, an anointed one.
[1:33:45] I say if you can't see it now, can you
[1:33:49] see what's coming?
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; I think we can be a little like Abraham
[1:33:53] then.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; We can be strong in faith.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Look, it ain't my faith. I am not living
[1:34:00] by the faith of Matthew McGary. That
[1:34:01] faith will fail.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; But I am living by the faith of the son
[1:34:06] of God who loved me and gave his life
[1:34:08] for me.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; This whole thing is rigged.
[1:34:12] He said, "Faith comes by hearing the
[1:34:14] word." And he gave you the faith to get
[1:34:15] the faith to hear the word or what?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; It wasn't my ability to hear. It was his
[1:34:22] grace.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't wake up one day and say,
[1:34:26] "You know what? I think I'll do." No, it
[1:34:28] was God's grace.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Behold, I send
[1:34:32] you."
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Come on. You were that you
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; by his grace
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; unmmerited grace. I didn't do anything
[1:34:46] to deserve it.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; But God called me. God elected me. He
[1:34:53] died on Calvary for my sins. Every bad
[1:34:56] thought, every bad deed. He was whooped.
[1:35:00] He was bruised. He was beaten for me.
[1:35:04] and he took it all up to Calvary and
[1:35:07] said, "It's finished." And if you'll
[1:35:09] just identify with the sacrifice,
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; he says, "You're justified."
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; But Lord, I did this. I don't know what
[1:35:20] you're talking about.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; You see what he's doing?
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; He's removing all the guilt.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; How can you be the word made manifest
[1:35:30] with the baggage? Because every time you
[1:35:33] try to step out and do the greater
[1:35:35] works, oh yeah, but you're not worthy.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Every time you say, "I am the bride,"
[1:35:40] the devil's trying to pull you back
[1:35:41] down.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Look, friends, Luther did not have a
[1:35:45] full revelation of justification.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; He had a sliver.
[1:35:50] But when the caps don't come,
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; he said, "When I say it's finished,
[1:35:55] you're redeemed
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; all the way back
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; to a needen condition
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; before sin ever started."
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; the three-fold mystery of Christ, the
[1:36:09] mystery of God revealed was what? To
[1:36:11] reveal himself in Christ Jesus.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; To then have preeminence in you.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; And in that preeminence, what is he
[1:36:17] doing? He's taken you back to an Eden
[1:36:18] condition to restore the original
[1:36:20] marriage covenant
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; to where the two are one.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; You never did it. Oh, I'm telling you,
[1:36:28] God, help us get a real revelation of
[1:36:30] justification.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if somebody here will let
[1:36:33] the true revelation of justification
[1:36:35] strike your soul, you won't even know
[1:36:37] what to do with yourself. You mean I,
[1:36:38] Brother Windle, I I never sinned in the
[1:36:41] first place.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that, devil?
[1:36:47] You're going to you're going to hell for
[1:36:49] my sin, devil,
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; because Jesus Christ already pardoned me
[1:36:54] and paid the price and he set me free.
[1:36:57] Take that, old devil. I am the bride of
[1:36:59] Jesus Christ and it don't matter what my
[1:37:01] past was. I already know my future. I am
[1:37:05] going in a rapture in a moment, in a
[1:37:07] twinkling of an eye. I am going to be
[1:37:10] changed.
[1:37:13] I'm justified. What did it? Grace.
[1:37:16] Grace. Grace.
[1:37:19] [Applause]
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; I say we ought to be strong in faith.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't let me hold you back.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; We ought to be giving glory unto God.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; I said we ought to be giving glory unto
[1:37:40] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. the
[1:37:44] mighty conqueror who took all of our
[1:37:46] sins, all of our faults, all of our
[1:37:48] failures. He nailed it to a cross on
[1:37:50] Calvary and said, "It is finished." And
[1:37:53] he went down to hell and he rose on the
[1:37:55] third day to declare, "I am alive
[1:37:58] forever more. I am the mighty
[1:38:00] conqueror." What a resurrection that
[1:38:02] was. And what a resurrection this is to
[1:38:05] be quickened. To be made alive by the
[1:38:07] quickening power of God that you never
[1:38:10] did it in the first place. You are
[1:38:13] perfect.
[1:38:15] I say that out of war shouting that I
[1:38:18] ain't trying to work you up. I'm trying
[1:38:20] to tell you the grace of God is here to
[1:38:23] call you out of all your dark
[1:38:25] situations, out of all your your your
[1:38:27] diseases, out of all your unbelief.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:36] No circumstance,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; glory to God,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; will be considered
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; when faith finds its bedding ground.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, I'm starting to feel pretty
[1:38:47] good.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; I feel like preaching now. Come on.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; The capstone,
[1:38:54] the mighty angel,
[1:38:56] the ancient of days,
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; what they all longed for,
[1:39:05] what they all prophesied about has come
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; in this day
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; and called your name.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; We're talking about being called, right?
[1:39:14] Accept his call.
[1:39:16] Call means to utter in a loud voice to
[1:39:20] give a name.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; I no longer call you church.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; I call you bride.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; It's to call by name.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Well, what do you mean, brother? Brother
[1:39:33] M. Who are you talking about? Who's
[1:39:34] calling?
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Master, if you would have been here,
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; my brother wouldn't have died.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; He'll rise again. Oh, I know.
[1:39:44] I know he'll rise
[1:39:47] in the resurrection.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; the resurrection."
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; I like to say it like this.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; I am the rapture.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; See, as long as you're with him, you're
[1:40:02] with resurrection.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; As long as you're with him, you're with
[1:40:06] rapture. As long as you're with the
[1:40:08] conductor,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; you will hit the sheet music, whatever
[1:40:12] it calls for.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; So, I'm just walking with him. He said,
[1:40:19] "I am the resurrection."
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; And then what did he do? That same voice
[1:40:25] said, "Lazarus,
[1:40:29] come forth."
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; I believe he's the same yesterday,
[1:40:34] today, and forever. And I believe it's
[1:40:35] the same voice calling to you right now.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; And I just want to say it like this.
[1:40:42] When he said, "Lazarus, come forth." It
[1:40:45] wasn't a suggestion.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Lazarus. If you can somehow
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; No, he was calling.
[1:41:02] And the same one is here tonight
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; calling.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell that old devil, this
[1:41:09] ain't a suggestion.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; It's prophetic.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; It's the same voice that said, "Let
[1:41:16] there be."
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; It's the same Jehovah that said, "I'll
[1:41:21] provide for myself."
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; I will have a bride.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; He's calling to you. Look, I tell you,
[1:41:30] if these stones don't cry out,
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; I mean, if you don't cry out, he's going
[1:41:35] to raise up stones.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Ain't no stone going to take my place.
[1:41:39] Ain't no tree going to take my place.
[1:41:41] Ain't no man going to take my place. I'm
[1:41:44] going to bless them. I'm going to praise
[1:41:45] them. I'm going to worship them. Why?
[1:41:48] Because I heard my name. When those
[1:41:50] seven seals were opened and those
[1:41:53] thunders thundered out, it uttered my
[1:41:55] name. Matthew McGary, son of God,
[1:41:58] predestinated, come forth out of Ladya,
[1:42:02] come up higher into a bride age and sit
[1:42:05] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Now
[1:42:08] ye are the sons of God. Now you are
[1:42:11] redeemed.
[1:42:14] [Applause]
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; What shall we say to these things?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; If God be for us,
[1:42:26] Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:42:27] God's elect?
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; It's God that's justifith.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; It's God that declares us righteous.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; So, I'm trying to hone in on something.
[1:42:38] The same voice that cried Lazarus
[1:42:42] is now speaking to you.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; You are the pure.
[1:42:46] Now, I I want to go back. This isn't a
[1:42:49] suggestion.
[1:42:51] I'm sorry. I'm starting to feel good.
[1:42:53] This wasn't a suggestion.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; This was a call for a manifestation of
[1:42:59] the purpose of the seed that was already
[1:43:03] put there.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; You are the pure virtuous. I'll try not
[1:43:07] to be too much longer, but I am starting
[1:43:09] to have fun.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; You are the pure, virtuous, sinless
[1:43:13] bride of the son of the living God.
[1:43:15] Every man and woman that's born of the
[1:43:16] spirit of God and washed in the blood of
[1:43:18] Jesus Christ and believes every word of
[1:43:20] God stands as though you never sinned at
[1:43:22] the first place. You are perfect.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; I want to say like Abraham, I am fully
[1:43:27] persuaded.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; That he which made the promise will
[1:43:31] perform it.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; It's not a suggestion.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Look, I'm telling you, he's calling to
[1:43:38] you. Are you going to accept his call?
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; We try to move towards a close here. I I
[1:43:42] believe God is calling to people. And I
[1:43:44] I I just want to say this. Accept means
[1:43:46] to receive,
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; to allow, to expect the fulfillment of
[1:43:51] promises,
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; second Peter 1:3 says, "According as
[1:43:55] divine nature hath given unto us all
[1:43:57] things." Everybody awake?
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Well, we're going to get down the home
[1:44:00] stretch. Just maybe 10 more minutes. All
[1:44:01] right, we feeling good. We got some
[1:44:03] people that traveled 14 hours and 20
[1:44:05] hours. We got some people that are
[1:44:07] sleepy, some people that aren't, and we
[1:44:09] got all this. But you know what? Home
[1:44:10] stretch. Are we ready? All right. Second
[1:44:12] Peter 1:3. according as his divine power
[1:44:15] hath given unto us all things that
[1:44:18] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:44:20] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; to glory in you're called to glory and
[1:44:26] virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:44:28] exceedingly great and precious promises
[1:44:31] that by these
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; ye might be partakers of divine nature
[1:44:36] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:44:38] the world through lust. Yes.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said in a statue of a
[1:44:44] perfect man, lust for money, lust for
[1:44:46] big things, lust for popularity, these
[1:44:49] things are dead to the believer.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, if they're not,
[1:44:53] you do not have to leave tonight.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you hear anything under the sound
[1:44:59] of my voice, there is a risen savior
[1:45:01] here that is ready to perform in you the
[1:45:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost. that that
[1:45:05] first nature might be dead and you might
[1:45:08] be married to another none other than
[1:45:09] Jesus Christ. The literal life of Jesus
[1:45:12] Christ pouring out through your body.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Lust for money, lust for big things,
[1:45:17] lust for popularity. These things are
[1:45:19] dead to the believer. We don't care.
[1:45:20] Attend or cottage. Why should I care?
[1:45:22] Live or die, sink or drown. This is the
[1:45:24] thing that I'm interested in.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God. Whether I maintain
[1:45:29] my home,
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; whether I maintain my family,
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; whether I maintain whatever it is, let
[1:45:35] me maintain Christ,
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; our hope of glory. Build me up, oh Lord.
[1:45:40] This is a prayer now. Build me up, oh
[1:45:42] Lord, into this.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Let Christ be my head.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; That working through me on my
[1:45:49] foundation, my faith that's in him. Let
[1:45:52] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:45:54] godliness, and brotherly kindness work
[1:45:56] in me, oh Lord, is my prayer.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer?
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; I believe God is calling through these
[1:46:04] meetings.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; And I want to say, oh, let's accept his
[1:46:09] call.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; We got five more minutes.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; I should I should end.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in Matthew 20, many are
[1:46:17] called,
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; but few are chosen.
[1:46:21] But I'm so glad to be the few and the
[1:46:23] chosen sir
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; called to glory and virtue except his
[1:46:29] call. As in Revelation 174 would say
[1:46:32] this. These shall make war with the lamb
[1:46:34] and the lamb shall overcome them for he
[1:46:37] is the lord of lords
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; and the king of kings and they that are
[1:46:42] with him are called
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; and chosen
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; and faithful.
[1:46:51] That's what he called me. And I just
[1:46:53] want to say what he said. I am the
[1:46:55] called. I am the chosen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; I am the faithful.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; I want to say you are supernatural
[1:47:02] elected believers.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; You are the supernatural bride of Christ
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; and you are predestinated for a plan and
[1:47:10] purpose.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; You are the bedding ground of promise.
[1:47:18] You are prophecy.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Is there somebody that wants to accept
[1:47:22] the call?
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural gathering.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; The supernatural is here.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Every once in a while, I don't mind
[1:47:39] talking to my arch enemy. Devil, you
[1:47:43] showed up to the wrong meetings.
[1:47:48] Because this is a supernatural
[1:47:49] gathering.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; This is the God called, the God elected,
[1:47:53] the God ordained,
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Bible believing, demon stopping, Holy
[1:47:57] Ghost fil, tongue talking.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Matthew, you're a Pentecostal by
[1:48:02] experience.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; I thought Malachi 4:5 was to restore me
[1:48:07] back
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; to what they had.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; And we start fussing and we ain't even
[1:48:13] got it.
[1:48:15] But I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[1:48:17] of them.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; They were in the upper room.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; They were all in one accord. And the
[1:48:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost fell and they
[1:48:25] busted out of there so filled with the
[1:48:27] Holy Ghost. They said, "Men and
[1:48:29] brethren, this is we are not drunk as
[1:48:30] you suppose, but this is that was
[1:48:33] prophesied by Joel. I want to tell you
[1:48:35] this is that that was prophesied by
[1:48:37] Malachi 4:5. I will have a bride."
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:43] [Applause]
[1:48:48] Glory to God.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; What shall we say to these things? If
[1:48:55] God before us,
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; who can be against us?
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; I like to say it like this. In other
[1:49:04] words,
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; devil, you ain't got enough.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; You can't have my children. You can't
[1:49:12] have my health. You can't have my
[1:49:14] family. You can't have my mama. You
[1:49:17] can't have my daddy. You can't have my
[1:49:19] joy. You can't have my dance. You can't
[1:49:22] have my praise. I said if God be for us,
[1:49:25] who can be against us? Devil, you are
[1:49:28] defeated. This is the victorious,
[1:49:30] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ. We are
[1:49:33] going in a rapture.
[1:49:36] We are going in a potty change. We will
[1:49:39] put every devil under. I say it's time
[1:49:41] to praise him. It's time to worship him.
[1:49:43] Oh, lift ye up, oh ye everlasting gates,
[1:49:46] who is the Lord of glory, the Lord
[1:49:49] mighty in battle.
[1:49:53] There ain't no sea.
[1:49:55] There ain't no devil. There ain't no
[1:49:58] trial. There ain't no sickness that can
[1:50:01] separate you from the love of God if the
[1:50:02] musicians would come.
[1:50:10] What can separate you
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; from the love of God?
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Not your mistakes, not your failures.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; If you didn't know where I'm from, just
[1:50:26] hold on, brother Kobe. I'm not done
[1:50:28] preaching. I just wanted the people
[1:50:30] think I was.
[1:50:34] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:4.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Hey, don't sit down on me. We're just
[1:50:40] having fun.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:4. According,
[1:50:44] hey, I it don't get old to me. I I look,
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; I needed a God
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; to tell me over and over and over again,
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; some people get past it.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; But I'm sorry. Call me vain. I can't
[1:50:58] hear it enough.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Call me ordained. Call me predestinated.
[1:51:02] Call me the bloodbought.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; I I need to hear it because I live in a
[1:51:07] a lady you'll see a world out there in
[1:51:10] this realm.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; In my soul, I'm in a bride age.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; But I have to go out there and that lady
[1:51:15] you'll see a world.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; We don't got to get all caught up on
[1:51:17] that. You know what I mean?
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; And I go out there and there's enough
[1:51:20] Tommy rod out there to try to drag me
[1:51:23] down.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; There's enough stuff out there I say, I
[1:51:26] need to hear. I need to hear it on
[1:51:27] Wednesday. I need to hear it on
[1:51:29] Thursday. I need to hear it on Sunday. I
[1:51:31] need to hear it in my car listening to
[1:51:32] the prophet. I need to get down in
[1:51:34] prayer. I can't hear enough of what the
[1:51:36] word says that I am.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; According as he has chosen us in him.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; When did he do it?
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; When you pledged your love to him?
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; When you came to the altar?
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; When you said you'd be a good boy?
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; When you went to church three times in a
[1:51:52] row?
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; According as he has chosen us in him
[1:51:56] before the foundation of the world.
[1:52:00] Now remember, he's calling
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; not in a way of he might respond. I'm
[1:52:05] saying he's calling like he called for
[1:52:07] Lazarus.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; It's not an option.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; That we should be holy
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; and without blame
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; before him in love.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "My sheep know my
[1:52:23] voice and a stranger they won't follow."
[1:52:25] Quit listening to the devil who tries to
[1:52:27] tell you you won't make it. You're not
[1:52:29] bride. You messed up. Don't listen to
[1:52:32] that. Why? It was put there by
[1:52:35] predestination. You were for ordained to
[1:52:37] a son of God. You were in God before the
[1:52:40] foundation of the world. You're only
[1:52:42] manifested in this day for his honor and
[1:52:46] glory.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Kind of like that. Good. Oh, I'm sorry.
[1:52:53] You're over there. See, I do that to
[1:52:54] remind myself
[1:52:57] because if not, it's okay. I'm I'm
[1:52:59] coming. I'm getting close.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Kind of like that eagle
[1:53:05] just hatched out in Lady Oia.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Why am I eating this?
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; I guess it's all there is to eat.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Now, now we're being hatched out maybe
[1:53:16] in the wilderness or maybe we're being
[1:53:17] hatched out on message pews. But see, if
[1:53:20] you've never been born again,
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; you're still in the chickenard.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; You're in the chickenard of sin. You're
[1:53:27] in the chickenard of a oneman
[1:53:28] denomination.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; You're in the chickenard of your
[1:53:31] thoughts. You're in the chicken yard of
[1:53:33] what you can muster up.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; But see, that eagle was predestined. He
[1:53:37] got to pecking around. After a little
[1:53:38] while, he's like, I don't you know what?
[1:53:40] What is this? Well, you know what? I
[1:53:42] guess I'll just do what they do. But you
[1:53:44] know after a little while
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; because that chicken was what? He was
[1:53:51] predestinated to be in the heavens
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; and then when he saw Malachi 4 I'm
[1:53:56] talking about us now
[1:53:58] something of 60 years ago.
[1:54:01] But when you see a living word made
[1:54:03] flesh,
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; when you see sons and daughters of God,
[1:54:09] bride members who are anointed with the
[1:54:11] same spirit,
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; the same manifestation that came in
[1:54:14] Malachi 4:5 is now testifying in the
[1:54:17] wheat field of many more wheat seeds
[1:54:20] coming to maturity. And something in you
[1:54:22] when you hear the spoken word and you
[1:54:24] see the life of the prophet and you see
[1:54:26] it echoing out in the lives of the
[1:54:28] people, something in you starts to call
[1:54:30] within you. Hey, I want to be that.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; And I like this. We'll just end along
[1:54:36] these lines.
[1:54:39] Prophet of God said he saw a being like
[1:54:42] he wanted to be. Remember we were
[1:54:43] talking about the sheath wave.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; I could just take it back there. We know
[1:54:47] Christ was the original sheath wave. He
[1:54:49] was waved back to us in this day and
[1:54:51] came to maturity in a first one in
[1:54:53] Malachi for in brother Brandon. Is that
[1:54:55] okay? And now it's testifying to the
[1:54:58] rest of the wheat field of what we are
[1:55:00] going to be.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, see,
[1:55:02] talking about that eagle, he said he saw
[1:55:04] a being like he wanted to be. Go ahead
[1:55:06] and play, brother. Selling in the air.
[1:55:08] Maybe we can do that. Uh, set your wings
[1:55:10] to the wings of faith.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; He said being what he wanted to be.
[1:55:14] Selling in the air, screaming free.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; I wonder, do you ever feel like that?
[1:55:19] You see another believer or you see
[1:55:21] something or you see something at a camp
[1:55:22] or special meetings and something you
[1:55:23] says, I want that.
[1:55:26] [Music]
[1:55:27] Now, Satan will try to get you to try to
[1:55:29] imitate somebody
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; or manufacture an experience.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; And some people will preach against that
[1:55:37] in such a way that they devalue the
[1:55:39] desire inside of you
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; to want to come up higher.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; I feel his presence right now.
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:50] He saw a being that he wanted to be
[1:55:53] sailing in the air,
[1:55:56] screaming free
[1:55:59] up in the highs,
[1:56:02] above all the vultures and things of the
[1:56:04] earth.
[1:56:06] [Music]
[1:56:08] The prophet said he wanted to be that
[1:56:13] because it was in him to be that.
[1:56:20] Does anybody hear what I'm saying?
[1:56:24] I want to manifest every word that's
[1:56:28] been spoken by Malachi 4:5.
[1:56:31] Not because I can.
[1:56:34] Not because I have ability.
[1:56:38] Not because who my mom or daddy was, but
[1:56:43] there's something in me.
[1:56:46] I got to be that.
[1:56:48] I want to be that.
[1:56:51] Because you see, the prophet said,
[1:56:55] you want to be that because it's in you
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; to be that.
[1:57:03] I wonder if somebody's ready to accept
[1:57:05] his call.
[1:57:07] Do you believe it?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Do you accept it?
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandon would say
[1:57:14] hundreds of times, "Do you accept me as
[1:57:16] God's prophet? Do you accept your
[1:57:19] healing? Do you accept Jesus Christ as
[1:57:21] your savior?"
[1:57:23] You know, accept means to receive,
[1:57:27] to take hold of.
[1:57:30] And and I was thinking about this
[1:57:34] just to give a natural type. I thought
[1:57:36] it was profound.
[1:57:39] But in last year in 2024,
[1:57:42] there was a lottery that was worth 1.13
[1:57:45] million billion 1.13 billion.
[1:57:50] Somebody had purchased the winning
[1:57:52] ticket
[1:57:54] and they never came to claim it.
[1:57:58] Now, I don't know what happened to that
[1:57:59] individual,
[1:58:02] but could you imagine
[1:58:04] when the deadline passed,
[1:58:07] maybe you got back in town,
[1:58:10] maybe you came back out and you heard
[1:58:12] the news and you're like, I wonder if
[1:58:14] that was me. And you opened it up and
[1:58:16] you said,
[1:58:18] I I had the winning ticket,
[1:58:22] but it's too late now.
[1:58:25] It's the dispensation of grace is over.
[1:58:28] You failed to accept it. It was in your
[1:58:31] possession.
[1:58:33] I thought, can you imagine that in the
[1:58:36] natural
[1:58:37] here? They were calling this is the
[1:58:39] winning number. Does anybody have it?
[1:58:41] And here it's in our possession and
[1:58:44] we're walking around poor and
[1:58:45] downtrodded.
[1:58:47] Reminds me of that story. You know, you
[1:58:49] heard about
[1:58:51] woman had a good son and he went
[1:58:54] overseas for business.
[1:58:57] [Music]
[1:59:00] He was a good son and
[1:59:03] she said he sent pictures every once in
[1:59:05] a while, but she got into all kinds of
[1:59:07] troubles financially and she couldn't
[1:59:10] pay for anybody. And she started to
[1:59:13] somebody come over and was trying to
[1:59:14] help her and say, "You mean your son?
[1:59:17] He's he's never sent you any money. He's
[1:59:19] never he's never gave you anything to
[1:59:22] help you out.
[1:59:24] She said, "No, no, but he's he sent me
[1:59:28] some really beautiful pictures."
[1:59:32] And the man said, "Well, let me see it."
[1:59:36] He started to look at all these pictures
[1:59:37] and he said, "These are banknotes.
[1:59:41] You're you're rich."
[1:59:43] The prophet of God said, "If we would
[1:59:44] just take our fingers through the Bible
[1:59:47] of God's promises, we're more than
[1:59:49] millionaires of the riches of his
[1:59:51] grace."
[1:59:53] He said, "Those he has called,
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; he's justified.
[2:00:01] He called them before the foundation of
[2:00:02] the world. Those he called, he's
[2:00:04] justified. And though he's justified,
[2:00:06] he's already glorified." The same God
[2:00:09] that before the foundation of the world
[2:00:11] called you your name and wrote it on the
[2:00:13] Lamb's book of life in the book from the
[2:00:15] foundation of the world has already made
[2:00:17] a place in you for glory.
[2:00:21] Maybe we'll just bow our heads.
[2:00:28] The prophet of God went on to say, "All
[2:00:30] the devils out of hell can't erase it
[2:00:31] out of there. God's word has done spoke
[2:00:34] it. It's just as sure as to happen as
[2:00:36] God wrote it in there before the
[2:00:38] foundation of the world. Amen. How
[2:00:39] glorious our heavenly father is in his
[2:00:41] infinite love and his mercy to do that
[2:00:43] for us. Said, "Be ye therefore perfect
[2:00:46] even as your heavenly father is
[2:00:47] perfect." How can you be? It's not my
[2:00:49] perfection. It's not your perfection.
[2:00:52] It's his perfection of his word that he
[2:00:56] chose you. You never chose him
[2:01:00] and he brought you to Christ and you are
[2:01:03] secured with Jesus Christ. And just as
[2:01:06] perfect as Christ was before God
[2:01:11] for you're not standing with your own,
[2:01:14] you're standing in him with one thing.
[2:01:17] I believe God
[2:01:21] and I love him.
[2:01:24] I challenge you to believe that Jesus
[2:01:26] Christ is revealed in the form of the
[2:01:29] son of man in human flesh in your body.
[2:01:33] Is there somebody here that wants to
[2:01:34] accept his call?
[2:01:38] I'm not looking for any type of
[2:01:40] response.
[2:01:42] I just know he's calling.
[2:01:45] You accept it
[2:01:48] as he comes to you.
[2:01:54] Why don't you just talk to God? Why
[2:01:56] don't you worship God?
[2:01:59] Just let God deal with your heart.
[2:02:04] [Music]
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just welcome to where
[2:02:08] you're at?
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Start dealing with your heart and your
[2:02:15] life.
[2:02:16] what you've been doing in your
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; private time, the way you've maybe been
[2:02:21] treating your wife.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe you haven't been a good example to
[2:02:26] your kids.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Look, I say God's going to be calling
[2:02:30] during these meetings. I say
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; if you need to repent,
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; let's let's take care of that tonight.
[2:02:39] If you need to make things right, let's
[2:02:40] make make it right tonight.
[2:02:43] If you've been shunning the call of God
[2:02:45] in your life, let's let's accept it. You
[2:02:48] let God deal with you
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; with where you're living.
[2:02:52] [Music]
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, and it's great.

[2:03:13] you may take
[2:03:18] one by one.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Feel free to stand. Feel free to worship
[2:03:21] just the way you would.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, and take the word of God.

[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural call.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Man has made it religion.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; But God wants relationship.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Relationship is more important to him.
[2:12:36] than any status quo.
[2:12:38] A relationship with him.
[2:12:42] God living in you, reflecting his life
[2:12:45] through you.
[2:12:47] And to know that he has called me for
[2:12:49] that.
[2:12:52] He's just not calling me at a whim.
[2:12:58] But I've been forever in his mind.
[2:13:02] And here I am in my season
[2:13:06] to reflect him.
[2:13:08] It would have been nice to be back in
[2:13:10] the days of Jesus
[2:13:12] to hear him call, "Come follow me."
[2:13:17] It would have been nice
[2:13:20] to been down through the ages, but this
[2:13:22] is the final age,
[2:13:25] the final day just before the rapture.
[2:13:29] This is the day that God's calling us to
[2:13:32] a faith that is so divine.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; And our faith is going to believe like
[2:13:37] no other age
[2:13:40] until these bodies will be changed.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; And these words on this book has got to
[2:13:47] become divine revelation.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; You can't do it. It's not you making it
[2:13:53] happen. It's just you saying, "Lord,
[2:13:55] here I am.
