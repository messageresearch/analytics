[28:35] that is done and said in the name of the
[28:38] Lord Jesus Christ can the church say
[28:41] amen and amen God bless you you can be
[28:45] seated here this
[28:47] evening and um we
[28:50] are uh back in the church age book and I
[28:54] we're going to start here on page 274
[28:58] and um going to going to deal with the
[29:01] white Throne judgment now last week we
[29:04] um we had ministered on uh Mercy versus
[29:10] judgment and uh we want
[29:14] mercy and God has provided Mercy to his
[29:19] elect and um and and mercy should be
[29:23] something that we're very thankful for
[29:25] amen now we I when I say very thankful
[29:28] we ought to be very very thankful that
[29:31] God shown us mercy and um because he has
[29:35] been so very good to us and um by
[29:40] showing us his Mercy
[29:42] now we we spoke um uh last week and how
[29:48] that we are being judged right now and
[29:50] you remember the scriptures there in in
[29:53] 1 Timothy uh 4 and 24 some men sins are
[29:59] open
[30:00] beforehand uh going before the judgment
[30:03] and some men they follow after and so uh
[30:08] so we're going to see tonight that that
[30:11] there is the white Throne judgment uh
[30:14] that the majority of the people of the
[30:17] Christian World believe that that's
[30:19] that's where we all will appear but
[30:22] we're um the the The Sinner and the
[30:26] saint but we we uh are not to to appear
[30:31] before that white Throne judgment
[30:33] because our sins have been judged amen
[30:36] by the the cross of Calvary and so amen
[30:41] and so how how does faith come faith
[30:44] comes by hearing hearing by the word and
[30:47] so we that's the reason there in first
[30:50] uh Peter 4 and 17 we read last week the
[30:54] time has come that judgment must first
[30:56] begin at the house of God and if it
[31:00] first begin at us what shall the end be
[31:03] of them that obey not the gospel of God
[31:05] so so remember amen um matters of fact s
[31:10] kees if you'd put that John 5:24 up
[31:13] there there is no more judgment to come
[31:17] amen for the for the believer and that's
[31:20] the reason why amen make sure our
[31:23] garments are spotless here uh John 5 and
[31:27] 24 verily verily I say unto you he that
[31:31] heareth my word and believeth on him
[31:34] that sent me hath present tense
[31:37] everlasting life and shall not come into
[31:41] condemnation or judgment amen but is
[31:44] already passed present tense has p is
[31:48] passed from Death unto life he says
[31:52] verily verily I say unto you the hour is
[31:54] coming and now is when the dead children
[31:58] hear the voice of the Son of God and
[32:00] they that hear shall live now he's given
[32:03] the two distinctions there's two there's
[32:05] two times coming there's one that's
[32:07] coming and there's one that is and those
[32:10] that are hearing shall live for as the
[32:13] father hath life in himself so hath he
[32:15] given to the son to to have life in
[32:18] himself and hath given him authority to
[32:23] execute judgment also because he is the
[32:26] son of man Marvel not at this the the
[32:29] hour is coming in which all the graves
[32:33] shall hear his voice and shall come
[32:35] forth and they that have done good under
[32:37] the resurrection of life and they that
[32:39] have done evil unto the the resurrection
[32:41] of of damnation so there there is two
[32:44] resurrections that are taking place the
[32:47] Jesus is saying he that hears my word
[32:50] has already passed from Death unto life
[32:54] now there's going to come one to where
[32:57] the judge judement there's there will be
[32:59] amen the white Throne judgment and
[33:01] that's what we're going to be dealing
[33:03] largely with here tonight so I want to
[33:06] say Lord don't let me stand before the
[33:08] white Throne judgment I'm going to be
[33:11] there and I want to be there but I want
[33:14] to be there with the Lord Jesus Christ
[33:16] ministering to him amen how many
[33:19] believes that's all right and so uh uh
[33:23] um I I love this here it says SEC there
[33:26] in 2 Corinthians 5 21 says for he hath
[33:30] made him to be sin for us somebody read
[33:36] it with me for he hath made him to be
[33:41] sin for us who knew no sin that we might
[33:46] be made the righteousness of God in him
[33:51] amen oh doesn't that make you want to
[33:53] shout hallelujah praise the Lord and so
[33:57] so uh so we as we get get ready to look
[34:02] into this amen I I want us to to
[34:06] remember we are judged in Christ Jesus
[34:10] we as I as I was saying Sunday amen we
[34:13] came from Christ we were part of Christ
[34:16] the husband come to redeem his wife Amen
[34:21] to bring this wife back to him that's
[34:24] his whole goal there in in Ephesians 5
[34:27] and 25 it says husbands love your wives
[34:32] even as Christ also loved the church and
[34:37] gave himself for it that he might
[34:40] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[34:43] of Water by the word that he might
[34:47] present it to himself a glorious church
[34:50] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[34:53] thing but that they should be holy and
[34:56] without blemish so want men to love
[34:59] their wives as their own bodies he that
[35:02] loves his wife loves himself amen aren't
[35:07] you glad for that so now this this
[35:09] message has brought to us that we're not
[35:12] trying to become there is a
[35:15] predestinated seed within you to become
[35:18] and I want to read one last thing before
[35:20] we get started in our reading here in in
[35:23] The Invisible Union of of the Bride Amen
[35:26] brother Brenham says now now now notice
[35:28] the anointed word of his day of which
[35:31] you are part by
[35:34] predestination you immediately like knew
[35:37] when you heard that you knew right quick
[35:41] that you was an eagle you also realized
[35:44] that you wasn't a denominational chicken
[35:46] to begin with you know there was
[35:49] something wrong there there is something
[35:51] wrong that's right for you know that you
[35:54] were trapped into it at the beginning
[35:57] but he the bridegroom took away your
[36:00] shame and put it in the sea of
[36:03] forgetfulness by the washing of the
[36:05] water of the word and blood of life
[36:08] that's what the Bible said your first
[36:10] husband that you were married to the
[36:12] world the anointed bridegroom which
[36:14] foreordained you has washed you by the
[36:17] washing of the Water by the church no
[36:21] that does that don't sound right does it
[36:24] you might find that in the almanac but
[36:26] not in God's Bible you are Washed by the
[36:28] word he says you are the pure virtuous
[36:32] sinless Bride of the son of the Living
[36:36] God every man and woman that's born of
[36:38] the spirit of God and washed in the
[36:40] blood of Jesus Christ and believes every
[36:43] word of God stands as though you never
[36:46] sinned in the first place you are
[36:48] perfect the blood of Jesus and if you're
[36:53] perfect how can you be judged as a
[36:55] sinner he says if I was supposed to die
[36:58] in the morning and a man took my place I
[37:01] cannot die for that sin someone somebody
[37:04] took my place and Jesus the word took my
[37:09] place become me that I a sinner might
[37:14] become him the word he says let me hold
[37:18] true to it not the church the word all
[37:21] that spiritual union of Christ and his
[37:23] church now when the flesh is becoming
[37:26] the word and the word word is becoming
[37:28] the flesh
[37:30] manifested Vindicated can you say Amen
[37:33] to that amen so there is a judgment that
[37:37] is going on right now you're that word
[37:40] now remember the blood has washed you
[37:43] and now the word is telling you who you
[37:45] are and that blood is still there the
[37:48] word as you're beginning to grow in the
[37:49] Lord and the blood the the word of the
[37:52] Lord tells you hey this is what God
[37:53] likes God doesn't like that attitude
[37:55] well what are you doing you're taking
[37:57] God's blood and you're washing that
[37:59] you're washing that spot off amen when
[38:02] there's when there's things that are
[38:03] that are going on what are you doing you
[38:05] are you are you it's your desire to
[38:08] please him but you never could please
[38:10] him you never could you that law could
[38:13] never be lived in and through you amen
[38:16] but now the righteousness of God through
[38:18] Christ has come back upon us and I want
[38:21] to shout hallelujah thank you Lord for
[38:24] your grace now let's look here and and
[38:28] we're going to look at the very last
[38:31] paragraph as as brother brandham um is
[38:34] dealing with the um the the white Throne
[38:39] judgment it says there is another Point
[38:42] here to see and this is Page 274 last
[38:45] paragraph in that great white Throne
[38:48] judgment there will be a separation of
[38:50] people the book of life will be opened
[38:53] and another book will be open Matthew 25
[38:56] and 31 1- 46 when the son of man shall
[39:00] come in his glory all the Holy Angels
[39:03] with him and then uh shall he sit upon
[39:07] the throne of his glory and before him
[39:10] shall be gathered all nations and he
[39:13] shall separate them one from another as
[39:15] a Shepherd divides his sheep from the
[39:18] goats he shall set the sheep on his
[39:21] right hand but the goats on the left
[39:23] hand then shall the king say unto them
[39:27] on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my
[39:29] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[39:32] you from before the foundation of the
[39:35] world for I was a hungered and you gave
[39:37] me meat I was thirsty you gave me drink
[39:41] I was a stranger you you took me in
[39:45] naked you clothed me I was sick and you
[39:48] visited me I was in prison and ye came
[39:52] to me then shall the righteous answer
[39:54] him saying Lord when saw we thee and
[39:57] hung hungered and fed thee or thirsty
[39:59] and gave thee drink when saw we thee a
[40:02] stranger and took thee in or naked and
[40:05] clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or
[40:09] in prison and came unto thee and the
[40:11] King shall answer and say unto them
[40:13] verily I say unto you in as much as you
[40:17] have done it unto the least of these my
[40:19] brethren ye have done it unto me then
[40:22] shall he say also unto them on his left
[40:26] depart for me ye cursed every or into
[40:31] Everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[40:34] and his angels for I was a hunger you
[40:37] gave me no meat I was thirsty you gave
[40:40] me no drink I was a stranger and you
[40:43] took me not in naked and you clothed me
[40:45] not sick and in prison and you visited
[40:48] me not then shall they answer also also
[40:52] answer him saying Lord when saw we thee
[40:55] and hungered or a thirst or a stranger
[40:58] or naked or sick or in prison and did
[41:01] not Minister unto thee and he shall
[41:04] answer them saying verily I say unto you
[41:08] in as much as you did it not to one of
[41:11] the least of these ye did it not to me
[41:15] and these shall go away into Everlasting
[41:17] punishment but the righteous unto ever
[41:20] uh uh unto life
[41:22] eternal Revelations 20
[41:25] 11-15 I saw a great white
[41:28] throne and and him that sat on it from
[41:32] whom from whose face the earth and the
[41:34] heaven fled away and there was no place
[41:38] found for them and I saw the dead small
[41:42] and great stand before God and the books
[41:45] were open and another book was open
[41:48] which was the book of life and the dead
[41:50] were judged out of those things which
[41:52] were in the books according to their
[41:54] works and the Sea gave up the dead which
[41:57] which were in it and the death and Hell
[41:59] delivered up the death the dead which
[42:02] were in them and they were judged every
[42:04] man according to their works and and
[42:08] death and hell were cast into the Lake
[42:10] of Fire this is the second death
[42:13] whosoever was not found in the book of
[42:15] life was cast into the Lake of Fire
[42:18] there will be both the righteous and the
[42:20] unrighteous in this judgment it says so
[42:25] these righteous will not be the bride
[42:28] for the bride sits with him in judgment
[42:32] 1 Corinthians 6:2
[42:34] and3 do ye not know that the Saints
[42:37] shall judge the world if the world shall
[42:40] be judged by you are ye unworthy to
[42:43] judge the smallest manner know ye not
[42:46] that we shall judge Angels how much more
[42:50] things that pertain to this life
[42:53] Revelations 3:21 to him that overcometh
[42:57] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[43:00] even as I also overcame and am sat down
[43:05] with my father in his throne see the
[43:08] bride is with him in the throne as she
[43:12] is to judge the world she has to be
[43:14] sitting in judgment with him that's
[43:17] exactly how what Daniel saw Daniel
[43:20] 79 through
[43:22] 10 and I beheld the Thrones were cast
[43:25] down and the Ancient of Days did had sit
[43:28] whose garment was white as snow and the
[43:31] hair of his head like the pure wool his
[43:35] throne was like the fiery flame and his
[43:37] wheels as burning fire a fiery stream
[43:40] issued and came forth uh from before him
[43:45] thousand thousands ministered unto him I
[43:48] want you to remember or maybe even just
[43:50] circle that unto him and 10,000 times
[43:55] 10,000 stood be before and then you can
[43:58] Min you can also Circle that before the
[44:01] Judgment was set and the books were open
[44:05] see in at the same scene thousand
[44:08] thousands are ministering to him are the
[44:12] bride for who ministers to the husband
[44:14] but the wife the question now arises why
[44:18] are these righteous ones in the
[44:21] Judgment there is no other place that
[44:24] they can come up for there are but two
[44:27] resurrections since they could not
[44:30] qualify for the first resurrection they
[44:33] must come up in the second which is a
[44:35] resurrection under judgment the ones who
[44:38] qualify for the first resurrection the
[44:41] bride are not in the Judgment John 5 and
[44:44] 24 verily verily I say unto you he that
[44:47] heareth my word and believeth on him
[44:50] that sent me hath everlasting life that
[44:54] is the believer is already the recipient
[44:56] of eternal life which he has in
[44:59] possession now and shall not come into
[45:03] condemnation shall not come into
[45:05] judgment is what it really says but is
[45:07] passed permanently from Death unto life
[45:11] but notice carefully Jesus must have yet
[45:14] another group in mind who at a certain
[45:17] Resurrection will receive eternal
[45:19] life they will receive it at the
[45:22] resurrection not H not having
[45:25] previously received it as a member of
[45:28] the Bride John 5:28 Marvel not at this
[45:32] for the hour is coming in which all that
[45:35] are in the grave shall hear his voice
[45:37] and shall come forth they that have done
[45:40] good under the resurrection of life and
[45:42] they that have done evil unto the
[45:44] resurrection of damnation now we all
[45:46] know that John
[45:48] 5:28-29 is not the Rapture for only the
[45:52] dead in Christ shall arise from the
[45:55] graves at that time
[45:57] along with the living bride who is still
[45:59] on the earth 1 Thessalonians
[46:04] 4:16-17 for the Lord himself shall
[46:06] descend from heaven with a shout with
[46:09] the voice of the Archangel with the
[46:11] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[46:13] shall rise
[46:14] first then we which are alive and remain
[46:18] shall be caught up together with him in
[46:19] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[46:22] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[46:25] but in John but it says in John 5:28-29
[46:28] that all are going to come forth from
[46:32] the grave this is very this is the very
[46:35] same resurrection that is spoken of in
[46:38] Revelations 20
[46:40] 11-15 wherein the dead were brought
[46:43] forth before the Lord judged according
[46:46] to their works and all whose names were
[46:49] not written on the Book of Life were
[46:52] then cast into the Lake of Fire we now
[46:55] face the question as to why they should
[46:58] be given eternal life after the Judgment
[47:01] since the Epistles seem to be conclusive
[47:04] seem to conclusively point out that one
[47:08] must possess the spirit of Christ or
[47:10] perish though it seems thus we must not
[47:14] discredit the words of Jesus who most
[47:17] pointedly sets forth that there are some
[47:20] found in the Book of Life who will
[47:22] either receive eternal life before the
[47:24] general Resurrection or after it
[47:27] now Paul does not evade this Truth for
[47:30] he most clearly says in Philippians
[47:32] 3:11 if by any means I may obtain to the
[47:36] resurrection of the dead now this
[47:38] statement is most peculiar we all know
[47:41] that we are all going to be in the
[47:44] resurrection whether we want to be or
[47:46] not all will be
[47:49] resurrected so Paul could could hardly
[47:52] be saying if by any means by any means I
[47:55] might attain to the resurrection ction
[47:57] of the Dead the truth of the matter is
[47:59] he's not saying that the literal reading
[48:01] is this is if I if by any means I might
[48:05] obain to the out Resurrection from among
[48:08] the dead that is not the attaining to
[48:11] the general or the second Resurrection
[48:13] but the attaining to the first
[48:16] resurrection uh of which it is said
[48:18] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[48:22] the First Resurrection on such the
[48:25] second death hath no power but they
[48:28] shall be Priests of God and of Christ
[48:31] and shall reign with him a thousand
[48:32] years the first resurrection has nothing
[48:36] to do with the second that is at the end
[48:40] of the Thousand Years when all the rest
[48:42] of the Dead live again and in that day
[48:46] there will be those who come forth to
[48:49] eternal life and those who are caught in
[48:52] the second death now we do not need to
[48:55] guess about those who
[48:57] in the second Resurrection or given
[49:00] life we are told it is given to them on
[49:04] the grounds that they have been kind and
[49:07] good to the
[49:08] Brethren those who are raised and cast
[49:11] into the Lake of Fire will be so treated
[49:15] because of their mistreatment of the
[49:17] Brethren since this is the word of God
[49:20] we simply accept it there is no argument
[49:23] here just a simple statement of fact to
[49:28] further
[49:29] clarify notice specifically the words of
[49:32] Matthew
[49:34] 25:31-46
[49:35] it does not say that a Shepherd is
[49:38] literally sheep separating sheep from
[49:41] the goats but it is a as a Shepherd
[49:45] dividing sheep from the
[49:47] goats these are not sheep in this
[49:50] particular uh area of time the white
[49:53] Throne judgment the Sheep are in his
[49:56] fold
[49:57] they heard his word the his voice the
[49:59] word they followed him they have already
[50:02] have eternal life and cannot come into
[50:05] the Judgment but these do not have
[50:08] eternal life and they are in judgment
[50:12] they are allowed to go into eternal
[50:15] life but upon what grounds do they enter
[50:18] into eternal life certainly not upon the
[50:21] fact that they already had his life as
[50:23] does the bride but they receive it
[50:27] because they were kind to his Brethren
[50:30] they are not his
[50:32] Brethren that would make them join HS
[50:34] with Jesus they are not HS to anything
[50:37] but life they share No Throne Etc with
[50:41] him their names have been in the Book of
[50:45] Life and not removed now because of
[50:48] their love of the people of God they are
[50:51] recognized and saved no doubt these
[50:54] served and helped the children of God
[50:56] perhaps like Nicodemus and Gale who
[50:59] stood for the children in in the time of
[51:02] trouble if if this seems to smack
[51:06] restoration watch carefully now for the
[51:09] wicked are not restored but turned into
[51:12] the Lake of Fire uh into the Lake of
[51:15] Fire the names of many of those
[51:17] destroyed were in The Book of Life also
[51:20] but they were blotted out because they
[51:23] failed to honor the people of God who
[51:26] were living the Living manifested Word
[51:29] living Epistles for their day let us be
[51:33] very clear here these are not Nations
[51:36] being judged and going into the
[51:38] billennium because they have harbored
[51:40] and helped the Jews that is very clear
[51:44] because of the conclusion of this of
[51:46] these verses and these the wicked shall
[51:50] go away into Everlasting punishment Lake
[51:52] of Fire but the righteous unwe
[51:55] everlasting life
[51:57] there is no record of two judgments set
[52:00] where the wicked are cast into the Lake
[52:02] of Fire only the Beast and false prophet
[52:05] are judged at the end of the tribulation
[52:07] no this is the white Throne judgment
[52:10] they are judged according to what is
[52:13] written in the books it is the second
[52:16] resurrection that the souls under the
[52:19] altar as set forth in the fifth seal
[52:23] Revelations
[52:24] 6:9-11 are given white r robes and of
[52:27] course eternal life and or there would
[52:30] be no point of white robes when he had
[52:33] opened the fist seal I saw under the
[52:36] altars The Souls of them that were slain
[52:38] for the word of God and for the
[52:40] testimony which they held they cried out
[52:43] with a loud voice saying how long oh
[52:46] Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge
[52:49] and avenge our blood on them that dwell
[52:52] on the earth and white robes were given
[52:55] unto every one of them and it was said
[52:58] unto them that they should rest for a
[53:01] while yet for a while a little season
[53:04] until their fellow servants also and
[53:07] their Brethren should be killed as they
[53:09] were and should be
[53:11] fulfilled now note particularly here
[53:14] that none of these under the altar were
[53:17] killed for the testimony of Jesus they
[53:21] were not like Antipas who was slain for
[53:24] holding fast his name these are not born
[53:28] again ones with eternal life as their
[53:31] possession they come up in the
[53:33] resurrection and receive life because of
[53:36] their stand on the word notice how these
[53:39] are crying out for vengeance they cannot
[53:42] be bride material the bride turns the
[53:45] cheek and cries father forgive them or
[53:49] forgive them Father for they know not
[53:51] what they do these are chws they have to
[53:56] be because they are in the fifth seal it
[53:59] is the fourth seal that the bride is
[54:01] gone up in the Rapture so these Jews
[54:04] aren't born of his Spirit they don't
[54:07] even believe that Jesus is the Messiah
[54:10] but as they were blinded by God for the
[54:12] Gentile sake God gave them eternal life
[54:17] on the grounds that though they could
[54:19] not come to him yet they were truly
[54:22] faithful to all the word they knew and
[54:26] died died for it as multitudes died
[54:29] under Hitler Stalin Etc and will yet die
[54:33] so so you now the these are he's given
[54:35] us the two classes of people there's
[54:37] going to be those that were good to the
[54:40] bride going to be given eternal life
[54:43] just because they were good to you how
[54:46] many how many when you think about that
[54:48] you just you it makes you it makes you
[54:50] want to be kind to people makes you want
[54:53] to just be very salty because
[54:57] you your life to them you your your uh a
[55:02] testimony and them being kind to you
[55:05] will will someday pay off in the
[55:07] future and then the next one and this is
[55:10] where a lot of theologians uh a lot of
[55:13] them uh matter of fact most every
[55:16] commentary that Ive that I have read uh
[55:19] they always look to those
[55:21] Souls a lot of them look to those Souls
[55:23] that amen um you know they were
[55:26] Christians just waiting but brother
[55:28] Brandon brings it out that no God
[55:31] blinded the eyes of the Jews so that we
[55:35] could have salvation and then God
[55:39] rewards them with eternal life now they
[55:43] lost their Nation the Jews what they're
[55:45] going through right now I mean they
[55:47] listen they had to pay for their sins
[55:49] they they had to pay for it but those
[55:51] faithful Jews that have been doing their
[55:54] best uh uh to to to follow Jehovah and
[55:58] his word in in in the best that they
[56:01] know even though they're blind to the
[56:04] Messiah God gives them eternal life the
[56:08] good thing about it is is once the bride
[56:10] is gone did you know that the Jews are
[56:13] fixing to receive the same gospel that
[56:16] you have and will be filled with the
[56:19] same holy ghost that you and I have been
[56:22] re have received amen sister Tracy we
[56:24] missed you on Sunday God bless you back
[56:26] there amen so all right so let's let's
[56:31] go on down here to this um to this next
[56:34] paragraph it is the second Resurrection
[56:37] so those are the two remember the those
[56:39] that were good to the bride then the
[56:41] Jews now he's talking to the five
[56:43] foolish virgins it is the second
[56:46] Resurrection where the five foolish
[56:48] virgins come up notice they were virgins
[56:52] they did not have the Holy Spirit so
[56:55] they missed being in the bride while the
[56:58] five who had oil become part of that
[57:01] bride but these people being separated
[57:05] god-loving people trying to abide in the
[57:08] word according to what they knew of it
[57:11] and being a help in the work of the Lord
[57:14] will come up at the end of time they
[57:17] will miss the
[57:18] Millennium which you can begin to see by
[57:21] these truths is much more important and
[57:24] wonderful than we have ever thought or
[57:27] believed are you catching that it's much
[57:30] more important all these people have
[57:33] their names in The Book of Life and
[57:36] their names remain but whose names did
[57:39] not remain those of the world system
[57:42] churches who fought the bride will be
[57:44] those whose names are removed that is
[57:47] who will lose out they will be cast into
[57:49] the Lake of Fire now let us go another
[57:52] step but before we do let us review our
[57:56] case thus far first of all we know most
[58:00] assuredly that the purpose of God stands
[58:03] in election Can someone say Amen it was
[58:07] purposed in himself it was God's purpose
[58:11] to bring forth a people like unto
[58:16] himself that would be a word bribe she
[58:19] was chosen before the foundation of the
[58:22] world in him she was forn and beloved
[58:27] before she was ever brought forth during
[58:29] the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed
[58:32] by his blood and can never come into
[58:36] condemnation she can never be in
[58:39] judgment because sin cannot be imputed
[58:42] unto her Romans 4 and8 blessed is the
[58:46] man to whom the Lord will not impute sin
[58:50] but indeed she will be with him in his
[58:53] throne of judgment judging the world and
[58:55] even the Angels her name each of her
[58:59] members was written in a section of the
[59:02] Lamb's uh book of life before the
[59:05] foundation of the world secondly there
[59:08] is another class their names were also
[59:12] in the book of life and they will come
[59:14] up in the second Resurrection such are
[59:17] the foolish virgins and the righteous
[59:19] are spoken of in Matthew 25 in this
[59:23] class
[59:24] also are those who do not worship the
[59:26] beast but or become involved in the
[59:29] Antichrist system but die for their
[59:32] faith even though they are not in the
[59:34] bride and not having been born again but
[59:37] they will come up in the second
[59:38] resurrection and go into eternal life
[59:41] thirdly there are the bordering
[59:44] Christians such as we saw in Israel
[59:47] coming up out of Egypt these have their
[59:50] names in The Book of Life and their
[59:51] Works were written in the books these
[59:53] have failed to obey God being void of
[59:56] the spirit and though even the signs and
[59:58] wonders were amongst them will have
[1:00:01] their names removed from The Book of
[1:00:03] Life amongst this group will be the ones
[1:00:06] like Judas who though entirely void of
[1:00:09] the spirit but are
[1:00:11] religious will have manifestations in
[1:00:14] their lives and though on the books were
[1:00:17] not elected in
[1:00:18] him uh such as balum will will be in
[1:00:22] that group fourth and finally are the
[1:00:26] ones whose names have never been or will
[1:00:30] ever be written on the books such are
[1:00:33] found in Revelations 138 and Revelations
[1:00:37] 178 all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[1:00:40] worship Him whose names are not written
[1:00:43] in the Book of Life of the lamb slain
[1:00:45] from the foundation of the world the
[1:00:47] Beast which thou sawest was and is not
[1:00:50] shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit
[1:00:53] and go into predition and they that
[1:00:56] dwell upon the Earth shall wonder whose
[1:00:58] names are not written in the Book of
[1:01:01] Life from the foundation of the world
[1:01:03] when they behold the Beast that was is
[1:01:05] not yet is Jesus said that a certain
[1:01:09] group would accept one who came in his
[1:01:12] own name that one is the Antichrist that
[1:01:15] is exactly what he says of them in
[1:01:17] Revelations 138 And1 178 these were
[1:01:21] ordained of God but not unto
[1:01:24] election with this group is such that
[1:01:28] are as Pharaoh it says of him even for
[1:01:31] this same purpose have I raised thee up
[1:01:35] vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction
[1:01:37] Romans 9:17 and 22 none of these would
[1:01:41] be placed on the records of life I'm not
[1:01:44] saying that there is no record of them
[1:01:47] no doubt there is some kind of record of
[1:01:49] them but not in the books of uh the
[1:01:50] records of Life their purpose of
[1:01:53] existence has been dealt with slight ly
[1:01:56] in the rest of this
[1:01:58] book um but we can add two more
[1:02:01] scriptures Proverbs 16:4 the Lord hath
[1:02:04] made the wicked for the day of evil job
[1:02:08] 21 and3 the wicked is reserved unto the
[1:02:12] day of
[1:02:13] Destruction they shall be brought forth
[1:02:16] to the day of
[1:02:18] Wrath since this portion of the word is
[1:02:20] hard for the human mind to grasp it must
[1:02:24] be accepted and be believed by faith
[1:02:28] some will be offended by what I have set
[1:02:30] forth because they failed to understand
[1:02:32] the sovereignty of God which sets forth
[1:02:35] that God is God and because he is God
[1:02:40] one cannot defeat his counsels or thwart
[1:02:43] his will and purpose but he being
[1:02:46] omnipotent is ruling in all Affairs and
[1:02:49] is doing whatever he will with all his
[1:02:52] creation because all were created for
[1:02:55] his good pleasure
[1:02:56] therefore as Paul says if God should
[1:02:59] take one lump of uh take one lump of
[1:03:02] clay and make of that same lump one
[1:03:05] vessel unto honor and another vessel
[1:03:08] unto dishonor who can be offended and
[1:03:11] cry against him that he has the right to
[1:03:15] do uh that that he that he has the right
[1:03:19] to do this on the grounds of creation
[1:03:21] alone we cannot deny yet he went even
[1:03:24] further according to Roman Romans 14
[1:03:27] 7-9 we have the ref irrefutable proof
[1:03:31] that Jesus Paid the purchase price of
[1:03:34] the whole world therefore he can do as
[1:03:38] he Wills with his own for none of us
[1:03:41] lives to himself and no man dieth to
[1:03:44] himself for whether we live we live unto
[1:03:47] the Lord whether we die we die unto the
[1:03:50] Lord whether we live therefore or die we
[1:03:53] are the Lords for this for to this end
[1:03:57] Christ both died and Rose and revived
[1:04:00] that he might be Lord both of the dead
[1:04:04] and the
[1:04:05] living this is ownership not
[1:04:08] relationship is meant here this is also
[1:04:11] set forth in John
[1:04:12] 17:2 as thou Hast given him Power Over
[1:04:16] All Flesh that he should give eternal
[1:04:19] life to as many as thou Hast given him
[1:04:22] now if we impute omniscience to God we
[1:04:26] must also accept that he is perfect in
[1:04:28] wisdom and
[1:04:30] righteousness this plan of election and
[1:04:33] reprobation is the wisdom of God
[1:04:36] revealed in all ages even as it is said
[1:04:39] in as it says in Ephesians
[1:04:43] 13-11 blessed be the God and father of
[1:04:47] our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[1:04:50] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:04:52] places in Christ according as he has
[1:04:55] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:04:57] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:04:59] Without Blame before him in love having
[1:05:02] predestinated us into the adoption of
[1:05:04] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:05:07] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:05:09] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:05:11] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:05:14] in the Beloved in whom we have
[1:05:17] Redemption through his blood the
[1:05:19] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:05:22] riches of his grace wherein he has
[1:05:24] abounded Us in all wisdom and prudence
[1:05:28] and having made known unto us the
[1:05:29] mystery of his will according to his
[1:05:32] good pleasure which he purposed in
[1:05:34] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:05:37] fullness of times he might gather
[1:05:39] together in one all things in Christ
[1:05:42] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:05:44] on the earth even in him in whom also we
[1:05:48] have obtained an inheritance being
[1:05:51] predestined uh predestinated according
[1:05:53] to the purpose of him who worketh all
[1:05:55] all things after the counsel of his own
[1:05:57] will thus if God has so designed that
[1:06:01] there be those whose names are placed in
[1:06:04] the section of the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:06:06] and cannot be erased for they are the
[1:06:09] names of his bride then we must accept
[1:06:12] that if it also states that there are
[1:06:15] those whose names were placed in the
[1:06:17] record of life but in the for knowledge
[1:06:20] of God they were to fall and have their
[1:06:22] names removed we must accept them that
[1:06:26] if there are those
[1:06:28] names if if those if there are those
[1:06:31] whose names were never placed uh on the
[1:06:35] record of life we must accept that also
[1:06:38] and if there are those who will enter
[1:06:41] into eternal life after the white Throne
[1:06:44] judgment solely on the grounds of being
[1:06:46] good and kind and just to the elect who
[1:06:48] are his Brethren then we can not but
[1:06:52] accept that for who knoweth the mind of
[1:06:55] the Lord that we should instruct him
[1:06:59] rather let us subject be subject in
[1:07:02] faith to him who is our
[1:07:05] father and
[1:07:08] live can you say
[1:07:10] Amen Now isn't that a powerful reading
[1:07:14] yes that's that's a that's a powerful
[1:07:17] reading
[1:07:20] now it's it's an incredible thing you
[1:07:23] you know well the the the the natural
[1:07:26] mind would say well then I'm not going
[1:07:27] to miss it one either way I want to be
[1:07:30] good to all of God's people and that way
[1:07:33] uh uh so if I don't if I don't make the
[1:07:35] first boat I'll take the second boat
[1:07:38] well you know I don't like that kind of
[1:07:41] attitude I I'm in love with the Lord
[1:07:44] Jesus
[1:07:46] Christ you
[1:07:48] know it's it's a love affair and and I
[1:07:51] and the reason I I I read that where
[1:07:53] brother brandom says this is this is
[1:07:55] this is the groom this is husband and
[1:07:58] wife this is uh this is God's God's
[1:08:03] desire it's it's it's God's God's whole
[1:08:07] plan the word your
[1:08:10] word you know if I'm if I'm God I'm word
[1:08:14] and My bride is word amen and and and
[1:08:18] Satan come in through the flesh to to
[1:08:20] pull her off I want to redeem her back
[1:08:24] and so he's got to come come and take on
[1:08:26] flesh so when brother bradam put it and
[1:08:29] it's so beautiful I have never heard
[1:08:31] another preacher ever put it the way
[1:08:32] brother bradam put it it was the word
[1:08:36] that
[1:08:37] bled it was the word bleeding for you to
[1:08:42] wash away all of everything that was
[1:08:44] held against
[1:08:47] you then then we should then then it
[1:08:50] should it should it should drop all
[1:08:53] resistance from us there should be no
[1:08:56] resistance well I don't well I it's it's
[1:09:00] love and you can't resist love now your
[1:09:04] wife will res can resist you if it's all
[1:09:06] laws and and and negative and you know
[1:09:09] there there ain't a person there ain't
[1:09:11] any person that'll that'll that'll
[1:09:14] willingly give themselves to just um a a
[1:09:17] a criticism and um and and telling them
[1:09:20] what they're doing wrong all the time
[1:09:22] that and that's not what the Bible
[1:09:24] that's not what the what God is put in
[1:09:25] the Bible it's just not that way the law
[1:09:29] was put in there to let you know that
[1:09:34] you cannot live it there's no way you
[1:09:38] could do this in
[1:09:40] yourself so that Christ could come and
[1:09:44] express himself to you you see what I'm
[1:09:47] saying even in the heart preaching even
[1:09:49] when the even even and brother brandom
[1:09:51] can can preach but I I I've never I've
[1:09:54] never taken brother brandom's sermons I
[1:09:58] don't care whichever one you think is
[1:09:59] the
[1:10:00] hottest I've never taken that as brother
[1:10:03] brandham putting me as a bride down and
[1:10:06] telling me how worthless I am he is
[1:10:09] saying come out from underneath the
[1:10:12] shadows of Babylon that's making you
[1:10:14] feel your good in your own Works he's
[1:10:18] saying come to this word believe it
[1:10:22] don't resist it accept it by faith and
[1:10:25] say be it unto
[1:10:28] me that's how that's that that's how
[1:10:30] Mary got pregnant not resisting it but
[1:10:33] saying be it unto me amen and I want to
[1:10:37] be that kind I I want I I I want to be
[1:10:40] that kind of a husband to my wife amen
[1:10:43] uh uh uh to to to to to my my my love
[1:10:47] for her amen Even in our disagreements
[1:10:50] where she can't see eye to eye with me
[1:10:51] and if I know I'm right then God give me
[1:10:53] the grace to be to leader and and to
[1:10:56] show and to show her that this is not Uh
[1:10:59] u a male chauvinistic thing but I've got
[1:11:02] to lead my my family I must lead my
[1:11:06] family my wife is not ordained to lead
[1:11:08] my family I'm the guy that's got to do
[1:11:10] it and and I and it's I'm not on an ego
[1:11:13] trip but I've got I I'm want to make
[1:11:16] sure that we're
[1:11:19] successful wives that's the way y'all
[1:11:21] should look at your husbands
[1:11:24] listen you know we as guys weren't we we
[1:11:27] didn't ask for we didn't ask for the
[1:11:29] respect we weren't born asking to be a
[1:11:32] man or to be a but that's apparently
[1:11:35] that's what God wanted because we're
[1:11:36] males Hallelujah and um and so I heard
[1:11:40] one of the executive things that Trump
[1:11:42] put out there is males are males again
[1:11:43] and females are females again so that's
[1:11:45] good so we got that all taken care of
[1:11:48] now uh uh so so now males need to take
[1:11:52] care of what God called them to be and
[1:11:54] females need to be what God's called
[1:11:56] them to be amen but us guys as Leaders
[1:12:00] oh how we should be how how we should
[1:12:03] reflect that love that Jesus reflected
[1:12:06] to us that's incredible folks while we
[1:12:09] were yet sinners Christ died for the
[1:12:12] ungodly help me Lord amen amen so let me
[1:12:16] be that kind uh uh of an individual amen
[1:12:20] we're the presence of the Lord now I'm I
[1:12:23] I so I I broke it loose there because um
[1:12:26] because we're fixing to get in uh this
[1:12:29] this other this other one is going to be
[1:12:31] really meaty um and and and and brother
[1:12:35] brandom is now going to take this next
[1:12:38] reading is going to show how that the
[1:12:40] names were put on for a specific purpose
[1:12:43] and how they come off and and he's going
[1:12:45] to go through denominationalism had
[1:12:48] their place how they were the carriers
[1:12:50] of the seed and how that it had to come
[1:12:53] through Luther and it had to come
[1:12:55] through Wesley it had to come even
[1:12:57] though uh uh it was the organization
[1:13:00] that was that was holding that seed and
[1:13:03] going on up and going on up but the
[1:13:05] truth but they weren't the true seed now
[1:13:07] they were they were they were a part of
[1:13:09] the elect of each age but but the
[1:13:13] genuine seed time could not come until
[1:13:17] the Rapture time and this is the Harvest
[1:13:19] Time right here and this is the most
[1:13:22] beautiful time that's the reason why the
[1:13:24] Mysteries are being unveiled to us so
[1:13:27] that you can recognize what you look
[1:13:31] like oh
[1:13:34] you now how are you going to do it if if
[1:13:37] if you're under judgment how are you
[1:13:40] going to be free to live everything that
[1:13:43] God's called you to live if you're under
[1:13:48] condemnation amen and that's the right
[1:13:51] that's why if if if you're hearing and
[1:13:53] you need to hear it I need to hear it we
[1:13:55] need to hear that screaming back get in
[1:13:57] line we need to hear that screaming out
[1:13:59] amen get away quit quit quit uh uh uh
[1:14:03] leaning upon this and that come straight
[1:14:05] to the word and believe only what that
[1:14:08] word says but I will say only the elect
[1:14:11] can do it my sheep hear my voice and
[1:14:15] another they will not follow they have
[1:14:19] to that's what God is called and so he's
[1:14:22] coming to pull you back woo you back to
[1:14:26] himself to make you part of him can you
[1:14:29] say amen amen so so as we get ready to
[1:14:34] dismiss amen and um uh I you remember he
[1:14:41] he says these he says he Christ loved
[1:14:44] the church gave himself for it that he
[1:14:46] might sanctify it and cleanse it that he
[1:14:48] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:14:51] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[1:14:53] such thing that it should should be holy
[1:14:56] and without blemish now watch he
[1:14:59] says he says um he says Jesus the word
[1:15:04] took my place he become me a sinner that
[1:15:07] I might become him the
[1:15:10] word all that spiritual union of Christ
[1:15:13] in his church now when the flesh is
[1:15:15] becoming word the word is becoming flesh
[1:15:18] manifested and Vindicated he says you're
[1:15:22] standing
[1:15:23] completely you never sinned at the first

[1:16:20] father before the beginning the same as
[1:16:22] he was he was the Great great attribute
[1:16:25] of God Called Love he says because
[1:16:28] there's only one thing could do it that
[1:16:31] would be God come down himself took your
