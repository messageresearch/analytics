[0:28] man
[0:30] and Daddy's got to have a respect for
[0:32] Mama

[1:52] investing in you
[1:55] as children
[1:56] Hallelujah now
[2:00] but fathers are more
[2:02] than that father's
[2:05] amen they equip
[2:07] the sons and the daughters for the
[2:10] struggle of life
[2:13] and there is where the father steps in
[2:17] that he's not
[2:19] he doesn't have the prettiest of words
[2:22] in fact many times he might hum all
[2:25] around
[2:25] trying to come up with the right words
[2:28] it's not the dad a man is is polished
[2:34] the fact is
[2:36] that that is The Rock
[2:38] of
[2:40] jabbar's or whatever
[2:43] that one
[2:45] here's that rock that defends
[2:49] he's that man that is standing there
[2:52] a man that is that is causing a man the
[2:57] the waves to to stop at the door can you

[3:12] mad and throw temper tantrums like Papa
[3:14] Bear

[3:31] will kill them you know and now and and
[3:34] all of that because it's Amen that's
[3:36] that that's that Papa Bear coming out
[3:38] with any but then at the same time after

[3:42] about things he understands a man that
[3:46] that that you know there you you that
[3:48] life isn't fair and that the boys are
[3:52] going to have to go through life and
[3:54] there's going to be struggles and
[3:55] there's going to be things and they make

[4:00] there is training that is taking place
[4:02] to his offspring

[4:51] investment investment has another
[4:53] meaning it's
[4:55] investment is to endow somebody with a
[4:58] rank or position or class
[5:03] so when a father is is is investing in
[5:07] you
[5:08] is is showing the son or the daughter
[5:12] how to navigate through this life
[5:16] but the Father
[5:18] endows the Son
[5:22] he endows him with himself
[5:27] in other words he's giving him a front
[5:31] row seat
[5:33] he's giving him well praise the Lord
[5:37] he has given him a front row seat to
[5:40] manhood
[5:42] a father is
[5:44] a father's one that gives the the
[5:47] backstage pass or behind the scenes
[5:51] knowledge of the play that is at hand
[5:56] a father is not is not one that is
[5:59] perfect it's not one that makes the
[6:01] perfect decisions it's not one but a
[6:04] father is one
[6:06] that is looking for that way to find the
[6:09] answer
[6:11] he's looking for that way to remedy the
[6:13] situation
[6:14] he's looking to God for well praise the
[6:17] Lord
[6:19] and that boy and that girl that is in
[6:22] the home
[6:23] are watching that man
[6:27] it is a father to show you how it is
[6:30] done
[6:31] well praise the Lord
[6:33] life in this easy in this evil age of
[6:36] Sodom and Gomorrah is not an easy life
[6:41] but there's a father there
[6:43] even with his mistakes
[6:46] even with his UPS his Downs it's a
[6:49] father that is showing you how to remedy
[6:53] the situation
[6:56] Hallelujah
[6:59] willing to say I'm sorry
[7:02] willing to come before the Lord and say
[7:04] I want to I I'm asking God for help
[7:07] willing to say I've blown it
[7:11] but I'm not going to stay in this pick
[7:13] style I'm not going to stay in this mess
[7:15] we're not here to stay we're not
[7:17] building a house in the wilderness we're
[7:20] going on to the promised land
[7:22] it's a Father's Heart that is being
[7:24] exhibited
[7:25] amen when the church trouble is all
[7:28] around and everything is all they men
[7:30] look like it's wanting to fall apart but
[7:31] a father is going to stand there and say
[7:33] Jesus answers
[7:34] Jesus is there and we're going to make
[7:37] it through
[7:39] how are you going to do it Dad I don't
[7:41] know I don't know I'm torn up too but
[7:43] I'm here to tell you just follow my
[7:45] footsteps because I'm trying to follow
[7:46] his footsteps
[7:49] a father is one who blows it blows it
[7:52] blows it big and cries
[7:55] and the family is hurt
[7:57] but he's one that says listen guys
[7:59] hey man I'm a better man than that I'm
[8:02] going to rise to the occasion we're
[8:05] going to make it through
[8:07] a father is warned that when Mama messes
[8:10] up majorly or maybe you as the children
[8:13] rest up majorly amen that steps up with
[8:17] the compassion and say listen we're
[8:19] going to make it through
[8:21] divorce isn't the answer and amen
[8:24] running away isn't the answer we are see
[8:28] it's a fun he does not have all the
[8:30] answers
[8:32] but he's got the instinct to lead
[8:35] he's got the instinct to say we're going
[8:39] to make it through
[8:45] you say brother Wendell this is not
[8:47] really a deep sub this is a very deep
[8:49] subject today
[8:51] you can look at your band and you can
[8:53] scowl at him
[8:55] and you can be bitter because he just
[8:58] doesn't do things the way you want it
[9:00] done
[9:01] your family is still intact
[9:07] you ought to give that man a hand clap
[9:17] statistics
[9:19] says one in four nearly 20 million
[9:23] American children are raised in a home
[9:25] without a father or a father figure
[9:28] compared to the 1960 we're just one out
[9:32] of ten

[9:41] are far more likely
[9:44] to substance abuse

[9:50] crimes
[9:52] they are far more likely to be abused
[9:55] and neglected at home

[10:02] seven times more likely to become
[10:05] pregnant teenagers
