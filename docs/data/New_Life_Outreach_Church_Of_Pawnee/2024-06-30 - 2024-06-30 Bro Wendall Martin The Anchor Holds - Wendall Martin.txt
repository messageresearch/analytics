yes in spite of the storm praise the Lord so thankful for the Blessed Assurance of Jesus the anchor that holds amen we do have a quite a solid anchor in Jesus Christ and I am sure thankful for that here tonight amen sure in enjoyed uh sister khila special tonight and U enjoy the song service and I I just uh this this week has been a a a busy week brother Kobe was had his birthday on Friday and

to all three of them and and um we we sure do love uh brother Kobe and sister kalila what a blessing they are Amen to us here and um uh I I was sort of in the same channel that Sister Amy was in yesterday when she sent those pictures and and uh uh going back I um I guess it was uh that that Friday um uh there with Kobe and and um just thinking of how uh how this generation how um that the generation of young people how proud I I am of the of of the um of them as they have come into uh their own families and and um uh raising their families and things and and uh I tell you what here the Lord has made uh uh preachers and singers and musicians and amen uh just uh I tell you what we have we were really really blessed uh with that amen with with uh this that that that group of young people and how proud of we are of you all today so we say happy birthday brother Kobe and happy birthday sister Kila and um uh how much that means to us Amen to have you all in our lives let's look here in Hebrews the 6th chapter and we're going to start at the 11th verse and and um man the the song that brother Kobe uh brought me out on is actually what I'm going to title this tonight uh The Anchor Holds and I'm so glad for the anchor amen it's a secure anchor it's a steadfast anchor let's look here in Hebrews 6 and 11 it says and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end in that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely I Will Bless thee and multiply I will multiply thee so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and oath for confirmation is to the an end of all Strife wherein God more willing uh more willing more abundantly to show un The Heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it with an oath that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us which hope we have as an anchor to of the Soul both sure and steadfast which entereth into that within the veil whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made a high priest Forever After the order of MDC can you say Amen aren't aren't you glad for that amen I'm thankful for this blessed hope and consolation let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for for your love and your your blessings upon us Lord and we just ask that your anointing would be here this evening on this portion of the service and ask Lord that you would Lord just Minister your word to your to our hearts tonight help Lord both the speaker and the hearer as our prayer father we love you and we thank you for this Blessed assurance that we have in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning or this evening amen now I want to I want to just speak um uh for a few moments here tonight on The Anchor Holds I think it's important that we have an anchor I think it's important that we know who we are and what we are and we we need to make sure that we have the right anchor amen and um uh because as as brother Brandon would say amen he said tonight my brethren your soul is over hell on a chain and that chain is not some Theological Seminary teaching that chain is not some denomination or Creed that you're living by that chain is the word God's word Jesus gave the human race his word to live by and Eve broke it only broke one one little link of it and any chain is no stronger than its weakest link and when you take one word out that was the first of the book Jesus came in the middle of the book and said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God that was the middle of the book The Last of the book he said whosoever shall take one word mistranslate one word take one word out of here I'll take his part out of the book of life you're passing over hell hanging on the word of God don't let somebody squeeze something into your heart that's not thus saith the Lord can you say Amen so if God put his word and gave you the strongest as brother bradam would put it amen the strongest uh support the strongest anchor right he he didn't give you just amen a religious a a a religious cycle but he gave you the very best he gave you his word he gave you his word I I well sometimes we say well I you know I wish I had this or I wish I had that the greatest thing that you could ever have is God's Vindicated word in this hour amen now two immutable things it said amen the first immutable thing of course it is that God cannot lie amen that every word word that God says is the truth you cannot amen you cannot put your faith in the word of God and come out amen a loser because God gave the promise and it was just as good amen fulfilled as it is the day that he gave it now I I want you to know that because whatever promise God gives he's going to keep it amen now now we want the Fulfillment but I want to tell you as long as you've got it from God Amen you know it's going to come to pass God's word will come to pass everyone say God cannot lie can lie amen God simply cannot change his mind amen if God says well I'm going to do this amen and then a week later he says well I've just I've changed my mind then it can't be God because God never changes he is it's one of his great in uh characteristics he cannot change his mind he cannot lie his word once it is spoke it is just as as forever settled forever and ever well can you say amen amen but then the second thing that God wanted to do this now remember by two immutable things amen that God wanted to let you know he the second one is he confirmed it with an oath Amen in other words he made a covenant with you now now he he he he's he's not just saying well I've given you my word amen that should be enough but he swear and when he when he couldn't find anyone to swear by or anything greater to swear by he swore by his own character and and and so this is the this is what he's saying my character is so great I my reputation is so great I will put all I am on my word everything that I have said I'm going to bring it to pass well can you say amen amen now amen today uh uh there there's not there there's not you know Oaths just don't make uh uh you know don't carry too much weight amen you know we sign contracts and and uh that that have the weight of law behind them and and and if you renig on that contract amen uh uh then you will face legal action in front of a judge and so uh you you you you if you want someone's word today you you just can't go and anymore and and and and just they give you a promise but there's got to be a covenant or a contract sign that that that if You Ren dig they've got something that they can take back uh uh to a judge somewhere can you say Amen well God says I'm going to tell you right now amen I will swear by myself I will swear on my righteousness I've never told a lie I cannot lie it's not who I am but I'm willing to swear and also to give you a covenant he I I I I I want you to know here right now that amen that the Covenant of Jesus Christ Christ hanging on Calvary was God's covenant with you God made a covenant when he slew that lamb Jesus Christ and he said your soul is forever settled with me well that should make you want to shout amen hallelujah now now in the Bible days uh in in times past men swore in the name of their God Amen and and uh who would require it of him should he break it so the oath was taken by a name greater that that that couldn't be broken and so the the the fear again the fear of the one that was greater would would uh amen come upon those who were making the Covenant uh fear of Retribution amen that would come upon the breaker of the oath and amen so it kept them loyal but God I I I I just want to let you know God is so powerful God is so big God Is So magnificent amen God there is nothing that can stop God from doing anything there is no there's no hurricanes that can change God's mind for you there's no family problems that can change God's mind for you amen he is he he could stand there and say I'll be the author and I'll be the finisher of your faith I have started you and I will keep you Body Soul and Spirit until the day of the Lord oh that's a great God Amen that's a great God so he says I give you my promise I swear upon my very own righteousness now this was going to be a great hope now as we read there in in the scriptures that this consolation would be a hope that says there in the 19th verse this hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast with enter which entereth into that within the veil it's a it becomes a hope because though God can't change you can change right though God can't change your circumstances are changing all the time you wake up in a new world every morning amen you you you don't have uh uh you you don't have the say over you know what germs are coming into the world and and what sicknesses that that that you can endure and the things that you go through you but but it but but it does not matter it does not matter uh on what you're facing the anchor is he gave his word that I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen he cannot lie amen hallelujah someone says God cannot lie God swore it and he proved it by Jesus Christ every time you see a cross amen that was the sacrifice now in in the old days they would amen they would uh uh take a uh that you know uh they they would take a um uh an animal and they would kill the animal and amen and and the blood of that animal uh uh you know they would write a contract up and place that blood upon it amen and then they would say if any one of you if any one of you renig on that promise you will be as this dead animal amen that that this is a covenant this mean this is this is Life For Life you keep your promise amen and so when God gave the church that promise God put it Upon Jesus Christ God says he he gives his word he gives that atonement and every time you see Jesus Christ every time God sees Jesus Christ he is reminded of the oath concerning you he's reminded of his promise concerning you and this was meant as an anchor to our souls that no matter no matter what the situation is we have that anchor lodged to the Rock within that Veil amen now he says and as Abraham was was given that promise amen I he says you as the Seed of Abraham have been given that promise I I I wonder you know sometimes as as as healing we know we we we we get uh uh uh war in these bodies and and and with the foods we eat and the situations you know that we're in round uh you know with uh working in certain plants and different things there's you know we got all kinds of sicknesses we got all kinds of diseases amen but I I I believe that healing is part of that Covenant that is still with us today and God wanted to make that Covenant sure unto Abraham amen I I read I I look there at Abraham's Covenant amen uh there with matters of fact let's just turn there uh not going to hold you long here tonight but I want you to look let's look here in Genesis the 15th chapter and uh let's look at this Covenant that God made with Abraham and I don't know let's um uh we will start amen uh there in the in the ninth verse now God is God has just told him amen fear not Abraham I'm your Shield I'm your exceeding uh uh uh your your your exceeding a great reward and and and he's telling him you're going to have that promise you're going to have that son Abraham's looking back and say Lord I there's no way I can have the son this is what this is what it says in the verse the previous verses amen there's no way I can do this amen and God tells him listen I want you to go he says ninth verse take me an heer of 3 years old and a she goat of 3 years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these divided them in the midst and lay each piece one against the other but the birds divided he not and when the fouls came down upon the carcasses Abra Abram drove them away and when the sun was going down and and a deep sleep fell upon Abraham and low and horror of great Darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abraham know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and they shall serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with a great substance thou shall go to thy uh thy fathers in peace and shall be buried in old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again uh for the am iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and when the sun came down went down uh when the sun went down it was dark and behold a smoking furnace a burning lamp that passed between the pieces in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt into the Great River the river of euph Fades the Canaanites and the Kites and the catamites and goes on down through there God made this Covenant with him now brother bradam would tell us that he separated the Covenant because this was going to be amen it it was it was going to be the dividing it was it was was God uh uh shedding his blood and he would separate his spirit amen and and and and one would go to hell and then the other would be taken up to the to the throne of God Amen it would be it would it would be God making a covenant with his people he would become an intercessor for his people can you say Amen but then the dove the pigeon the he did not divide this dove in the pigeon amen because brother Brandon would tell us it would it was because healing they were from the same family and that healing would be in the old Covenant and the New Covenant amen that God loves uh to heal his people and and as Abraham as brother bradam would talk about this Covenant he would say Amen that Abraham had to make sure that he kept the car uh the the birds and the Animals off of the carcasses Amen to keep that word clean that sacrifice pure it was his job it was important now that he kept the the amen the the contamination off of those sacrifices talking about the word of God having to be pure and clean in your mind you've got a you've got you got to keep your those those thoughts off that Covenant you've got to keep you you you you've got to keep every filthy Spirit off of that Covenant you've got to make sure that you honor that Covenant just as God Honors that Covenant because this is a covenant that God is making with you and you've got to make sure amen that that that unbelief and amen and skepticism and and and whatever else in our lives keep sin off of that Covenant well praise the Lord I think that's important amen as we talked about the other night a little bit on thoughts your thoughts are important what you think about what you allow what you act upon amen that that sacrifice God made this sacrifice with you can you say Amen brother Bram would say then we find that that that God put uh Abraham into a deep sleep amen he says this was going to to reflect the Covenant that God was going to make with us Gentiles amen that many were going to go to the grave and and and and and you were going to and he allowed him to experience the dark horror amen he allowed Abraham to see how sinful he was and how rotten he was was and how rotten that you and I would be now brother bradam says every one of these things had a significance of what God was trying to show Abraham that in himself he he just Abraham couldn't have the baby Abraham couldn't attain to the righteousness Abraham would never be able to fulfill the any kind of a covenant with God but God is showing you you you you you're a people of of of Darkness you're a people of Amen of wretchedness but I'm not looking at your wretchedness I'm looking at the sacrifice he's telling him now your people are even going to go into into captivity amen these things are going to come he begin to show amen the things that were going to to happen to his seat but he said but I will keep my promise with you Hallelujah can you say Amen the next thing we find out amen is while Abraham is in a deep sleep amen and he's experience the horror of hell and he's experiencing amen where where all of his seed would end up going that's when the the the white light that's when the pillar of fire begin to come in and walk in between those broken pieces amen as the lamb was separated and the or the heord was separated and the she goat and the did you notice there was two shees a there and there was one he amen it was it was God it was Christ dying for the natural seed and that spiritual seed now you can see here now this is so important to me it's so beautiful is the light did not come amen and and and circle around Abraham the light was going in between and walking in between the broken pieces the Covenant that he was making with Abraham he was sanctifying that sacrifice he was letting Abraham know that my Covenant is based upon that sacrifice and not upon the horror of your race oh that should just make you rejoice you know many of times we look at our lineage amen and we can see our children and we see a lot of us amen that we were hoping did not pass amen well can are any of y'all there amen where you look and you say oh I I I I don't want amen that to pass on down to the Next Generation but because of the bloodline amen it goes down through the Next Generation but I'm so glad that you can tell your children listen the same sacrifice and the same Covenant that God made with me it is good for your generation and for every generation he's making the promise to all of Abraham's seed so it doesn't you you you see Abraham now this was all happening while Abraham was in this great deep horror he was experiencing a loneliness like no other loneliness now this was simply a type this was a type of Calvary who was going to be torn apart well glory to God you remember the Chinese Laundry hallelujah amen you remember how that would rip they would take that piece and they would rip it apart and and they would keep one and you would keep one hallelujah amen and that's exactly the way it is when God comes after you you're going to have your part he's going to have his part you've been given the flesh the word he's got the spirit and it's going to come down and just dovetail right together the promise he's made I'm leaving you my word and the supernatural spirit is going to come and fulfill everything that I've given you oh can you say Amen but the but the the the turtle dove and the pigeon amen that now they were from the same family and they weren't divided and this meant healing it was going to be be healing in the new uh Covenant and it was going to be healing in the old Covenant it was the same God the same Covenant each of these covenants amen now again they were divided there was the Old Testament there was the New Testament amen but when Christ came amen the New Covenant uh uh uh brought had healing in it as well and so when we think about the our our our healing amen when we think about here we are and and we are living in horror we we listen we we we we we we're living in a this world has so much complexes and so much amen our our this Our Generations are just so full amen as as as as as the wise man said amen a man is born of a woman is few days of sorrow and grief amen it's so much grief and so much sorrow and so much the older you get the more Sorrows you see and the sicknesses and you you see the limitations of mind I mean I it it's everywhere around you but again the promise is while you're walking in this world I'm going to be a Healer to you I'm going to be a deliverer to you I promise you I've got your soul anchored behind the veil and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter where you at or how how rotten the world goes I'm giving you an anchor but I'm also going to promise you healing healing for your body I am the Lord that Health thee of all thy diseases amen there in Psalms 103 and2 bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me amen and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thy uh iniquities and Health all thy diseases hallelujah amen if God done it in the Old Testament he does it in the New Testament if God started it once if God's ever healed he'll bring that healing to you sometimes we we we we we don't understand the amen where we are because many many times am man we look at ourselves well aren't aren't you glad that God's A Healer I I think I think that we could all we can have testimony service of what God the great healings that God has done I don't think we should ever have to question whether God heals God does heal and we've got to keep amen we we've got to keep the the the the the the any evil thing off of our covenant amen we've got to keep keep the sacrifice clean it's important for you and for me to keep that sacrifice clean heal feelings unbelief amen uh uh you know you anything that is contrary to the Covenant don't let the Covenant become contaminated because once the Covenant is contaminated it becomes just like you amen listen I don't want me involved in the Covenant I want the Covenant kept clean I want it the way God gave it because when it becomes contaminated then it's no good for you amen before you know it you don't have the the faith that you need to to just reach up and grab the healing that God's already given you amen you find it hard to be able to amen why because you have allowed amen circumstances and situations to cause your mind Amen to to to allow devils and bir and amen all of this junk to get on your to get on your sacrifice I am here to tell you today let's get the junk off the sacrifice and let's lift Calvary up high tonight amen God gave the Covenant it's not a New Covenant it's the Covenant that he gave Amen in Jesus Christ if he healed yesterday he'll still heal today if he done it amen for your family yesterday he'll still do it for your family today so what what's important now important is keep that anchor not what the doctor says no that that that that anchor won't hold keep your anchor in Christ who made the Covenant at Calvary 2,000 years ago amen amen now the Situation's comeing that you can just just fill in the blank man there's plenty of inhibit take it would take amen all the notebooks in the world to fill in the blanks of what we can put in the place of that Covenant but there's only one Covenant that God made right come on and that was through Jesus Christ and that Covenant is still alive and well today amen it don't matter whether it takes a little while amen there there there there's always when God gives the promise amen there's always the intervals between when the promise was given and and and when the promise is fulfilled and and and sometimes that interval can be a little lengthy sometimes amen from the time that you pray or even even I'm not even saying when you're pray I'm talking about when Revelation strikes your heart when Revelation strikes your heart that it's done that God's that that God has saved uh a Johnny and got God got and you have that Revelation in your heart it might been a service amen that went back 10 years years ago and that service in that service God says I've given you your son now it might be 10 years down the road and and and you might think well God didn't go God must not he must have forgot about it or maybe I just misheard it or maybe it was just a sensation or if God gives the Covenant amen it's all based on Jesus Christ and when God reveals to you that you are healed or that he saved your child or whatever he's done amen it doesn't matter how long it takes sometimes it takes a long time God gave the Covenant H H uh to to Joseph that his brothers and his and and and and his father would be bowing to him he gave him a promise but that promise did not come to pass last for another 20 years amen it did not you but there there were many a times I'm sure he was thinking as he was sold as he was thrown in the dungeon maybe maybe I missed it amen as he was pulled up and and sold to to to uh uh uh uh the the the uh uh Piper and and and and then sold uh into Egypt and and and all of these all of these things in his life it did not hinder circumstances does not hinder we have an anchor behind the veil the one who placed it in your heart that says Johnny is saved is going to save he ain't going to save Johnny he saved Johnny when he gave you the promise can you say Amen but you've got to have an anchor when the when when the when the rivers are pulling you every which direction and the trial are pulling you every direction and the time seems to go and go and go and go you've got to have an anchor in that Veil and say I believe God and he cannot lie praise the Lord there's an interval between Hallelujah and you know what God gave that promise God gave that promise to Abraham and when he put him to sleep sleep he says now truly there's going to be some things here I'm telling you that your seed is going to possess and that all the nations of the Earth are going to be blessed by you and all and then God begins to show it now but I must let you know amen they're going to go in they're going to be servants for 400 years and there's going to be Hallelujah don't look at the horror look at the sacrifice I've Anointed The Sacrifice i i i i if you don't look at the sacrifice you're go your world is going to fall apart every other week amen you're going to be so up and down don't look at the circumstances or the feelings or at your ability or the lack of your ability place your anchor in that Veil you can't see Jesus Christ he has passed behind that Veil amen but there is still something that is tugging there's something saying it's real there's something saying it is Anchor tonight I don't care what you're feeling don't care what's going on around in your world The Anchor Holds and is steadfast Hallelujah healing is mine salvation is mine can you say Amen yes sir God says go go go God tells the disciples go wait in Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high and then he's taken up so the guys go to Jerusalem and it didn't happen the first day it didn't happen the second day it didn't happen the third day it didn't well can you sayen but they waited because the word was true right God told Noah build an ark for the saving of you and and your household it's going to rain build that art 10 years went by 20 years went by 50 years went by 80 years went by a 100 years went by 110 years went by 120 years went by but he anchored in that word are you hearing me God will not everyone say it with me God will not lie right can you say Amen you see we when he gives that promise then we've got to wait that that delay that delay is the trying time for the believer hallelujah it's the trying time try your heart is that right amen hallelujah and and uh I don't know if I should even fit this in here but but just uh Austin knows what a delay means amen likeed the girl but there was a delay amen but I I told him it's it's it's a good thing it's it's a good to just tries your heart see where amen I but I I told him I said I don't think the girl's worth it you go get you another girl Hallelujah and uh he says no I think she is worth it and uh amen he see we Hallelujah that's a year of your life wasted amen but he's looking at it saying oh no this is an investment amen and uh and and and so but God God's got that in in your in every one of you there's if God's delayed there's a reason God's delaying when God gives the promise you remember what the scripture says whom he did for know them he also did predestinate that's before the foundation of the world Amen to whom he predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son he also called whom he called he justified amen and whom he's Justified he is already glorified so the day that God gives the promise is the day that you're already glorified but you're stuck in the delay you're stuck in the interval amen God predestinated you and then he calls you out of the world he justifies you and you're going through this stage but in God's mind you're already glorified Hallelujah it's done in God's mind now you're the ups and the downs and the ins and the outs can you say amen amen so the end design of the oath is is to make the promise sure and to encourage those to whom the promise was given amen Hebrews 6 And1 we desire that every one of you do so the same diligence to the full assurance of Hope until the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who faith and patience inherit the promises amen a delay are you in the delay tonight are you are you in the interval if as God spoke to you and you're waiting and you're wondering you can wait but you don't have to wonder the anchor it's it's just as it's just as solid in the heavens it's just as solid in the heavens as as the foundation holding amen more solid than the heavens and the foundation holding this this uh this building up here this morning can you say Amen we wait upon God we walk with God we trust God and we will see the promises come to pass I want to be one of those amen that the scripture says be followers in them who through faith in and patience have inherited the promises let's somebody say that about me let God tell somebody follow brother Wendell amen he's he's got the faith and the and the patience and he's inherited the promises learn from that one amen how how many wants to be a h h how many wants to be an example an example of Faith an example that God's word is true an example amen let me prove prove to the world that God is faithful amen the anchor halts though the ship is tattered The Anchor Holds though the Sails are torn I have fallen on my knees as I've sailed the stormy cease but the anchor holds in spite of the storm you musicians can come the Anor holds though the ship is battered the anchor hold though the Sails are torn hi have fallen on my knees as I face the rageing Seas but the anchor holds in spite of the storm Hallelujah God is faithful he's he's he's just as faithful as he was when he gave the promise you have to sweat it out sometimes he's going to come through I promise he's going to come through keep the birds off the Covenant sacrifice he's going to come through but will I find faith when I return he's going to come through keep the sacrifice clean keep the sacrifice pure don't let it be contaminated with your thinking or someone else's thinking or situations around you keep the anchor the anchor is that sacrifice the anchor that is your faith in that sacrifice believe it can you say Amen let's sing it now the anger holds

given and when those promises when those promises start coming to pass right here on this Earth and in this church it's going to be enough to bring about a Rapture because God's given some pretty big promises to you and me he's given some promises and he can not lie y'all remember when brother brandham was told he was going to have [Music] Joseph he says he couldn't find it written in the Bible it wasn't written in the Bible but he loved Joseph so much the character of Joseph in the Bible and he says the anointing was so strong and he he said he found himself in a closet as he was just pulling himself away and talking to God how how great of a character that man was and and just reflecting and the presence of the Lord was in the room and then the Lord told him you're going to have a son and his name will be Joseph huh well brother brandham just knew he it was just it was just something right here in his soul something right in his heart that said you're going to have that son well he went around telling everyone all over the all over the world well sister ma got [Music] pregnant and I can't I think it was it was with this second girl am I am I thinking right the second he he got he got pregnant everyone says is this Joseph well this must be Joseph and he says well I I'm hoping it is and God says it's going I'm going to have a Joseph and when the baby came it was a girl oh all of his critics started saying H you meant Josephine oh you m this and started really criticizing and and and then it started a rift around all of the circles or some of the circles around of Doubt camps of Doubt brother brandham says God promised me Joseph and I'm going to have Joseph well it was another I don't know 34 years and his wife got pregnant again now the doctor had already said amen after the after the birth of Sarah don't let don't don't let uh s sister M to get pregnant again she she just can't handle it amen well when they found out that she was pregnant again you know there was there was scoffers there the doctor the doctor had sister ma all tore up and [Music] and which is in turn was tearing brother brandom up and they were worried as the baby was coming she says I am I going to die this was the things that these were the things that brother Brandon was having to endure and his wife having to endure man she said oh if if Margie could come and he said listen we don't need Margie God gave the promise God promised a Joseph and we're going to have that [Music] baby Hallelujah well he went up River he went up to the mountain so torn up he was just so tore up she was tore up and got him tore up and he ran up to the mountain and then God confirmed the promise to him says you're going to have the baby he'd come right back down he ran you remember that he ran down to M and said ma everything's going to be okay he's going to be okay God's confirmed it to my heart it's going to be fine about that time amen she went into labor had her [Music] baby nurse comes out and says Mr brandom you are the father of a so many pound boy and he and he and he looked at he looked at him and he said Joseph son welcome he had been waiting for a long long time for that promise to get here and when everything was looking like it was just going to tear his faith apart was going to tear sister ma apart God heeld the promise God gave him the promise is that right you you you might say I just don't know my world's about to just hang on to the promise The Anchor Holds if you don't get anything else for my message tonight I hope you get the title The Anchor Holds and it's within the Veil and you can't see Jesus Christ because he's in the veil you don't see the anchor down in the waters neither amen but it's hooked to a rock down low that is anchoring you you can't see Jesus Christ but I promise you just follow the Rope it'll lead you right to it every now and then you can just sort of feel a tug that's what you're feeling when you come to church or when you're praying or whatever it is when you're there amen and and and and you just the presence of the Lord comes down amen you'll feel a little tug on your on your heart that's that's that's that's the anchor that's that's that little something saying hey I got you buddy it's going to be okay going to be okay amen if you're sick you're going to be okay if you're discouraged you're going to be okay if your world is up and down you're going to be okay God made a covenant he could have just said hey just trust me but then he confirmed it with an oath through Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is has made it official come on your names were there in the Lamb's Book of Life for a long time but the lamb come just for you praise the Lord The Anchor [Music] Holds though the ship is battered

uh okay [Music] okay okay so Trent sister Carol grandson is in the hospital so we want to keep Trent in our prayers amen praise the Lord and um just believe the [Music] Lord uh sister sister Angie has has been dealing with a whole lot in her uh in her body and not just her body but her um uh those her husband going through a a divorce and uh just the things that that that sister Angie's going through and and uh we want you to know sister Angie that we love you and that we're praying for you and U I know it's a rough time for her as she is uh selling her things and and um and as far as making money that's that's how she is making money to to uh survive to to to go and I know it's a dark time uh for you sister Angie and um and I we pray God's blessings on those who are buying uh some of her things and and I just pray that that the Lord lead you to just throw in some extra uh money than in in in whatever you do to help her in her time of need and um but ultimately God's faithful

we're praying with you sister Angie and believing just just praying with you diligently amen we [Music] um and that's the way we should be with one another I I I think that we should have that love for one another and pray with one another and believe with one another we're all connected to that same sacrifice we're all connected to Jesus Christ and so um we where we should have that that love and that prayer for one another and and reaching out amen amen we're attacked uh matters of fact there is there there is there is one quote where brother bradam says in a church he says now he says that church you know talks about the hail uh uh you know hanging over it and and he says the weakest link the weakest link in that church is the weakest Saint he uses that he said that's your weakest Saint he said so secure the weakest link in your chain so that the church can Su uh uh uh succeed and be blessed and so I I I I think that's that that's the reason why we love our elders we love our those that are going through the trials we want to be there for one another amen because God's God's allowed it amen to show his love through his body show his power through his body can you say amen amen so as we dismiss and and we get ready to go we we missed uh brother sister Cochran this is are they doing okay uh her shoulder I tell you what I feel so bad I missed her call uh last week and and

went through that that shoulder surgery and uh she's another one that's really gone through it my goodness and so let's let's just be in prayer I I just hate them being way over there and US way down
