[2:49] But Jesus went to the wilderness to fast
[2:53] after the Holy Ghost had come upon him.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; John bear records seeing the spirit of
[2:58] God come up on him and he was filled
[3:00] with the power of God, God in him. And
[3:03] then he went into the wilderness to fast
[3:06] afterwards, not before for the Holy
[3:08] Ghost to come on him, but he went in and
[3:10] fasted after the Holy Ghost came on him.
[3:13] See? And now in the vision, I might say
[3:18] this, I mentioned it once. I was going
[3:21] to cut it off the tape, but I believe
[3:22] I'll just leave it on.
[3:26] I was about uh 3:00 in the morning, I
[3:30] suppose. I'd gotten up
[3:34] And I looked were in front of me and I
[3:37] was coming down to the Jordan. Looked
[3:41] like I was standing on the map of
[3:42] Palestine.
[3:45] And I was coming down to the Jordan.
[3:49] And seemed like I could hear the song,
[3:52] I'm going down to the Jordan. Someone
[3:55] was saying it.
[3:57] And as I drew near the river, I looked
[4:01] back and seen which way I had come. And
[4:03] I was twothirds of the way there to the
[4:06] Jordan.
[4:09] And uh I looked across Jordan and I
[4:12] said, "Oh, praise God. Just on the other
[4:16] side is where all the promises lay."
[4:22] Every promise lays in the promised land.
[4:27] And then I came to myself.
[4:30] I thought, could I possibly have could
[4:34] it been
[4:36] that I was dreaming?
[4:38] Uh because it's nighttime. See, a vision
[4:41] is something that you see with your eyes
[4:43] open just like a dream. You're looking
[4:45] right at it and you're you're conscious
[4:47] that you're standing like here on the
[4:49] platform and you're you're standing
[4:51] here, but yet you look like you're in a
[4:53] dream. It's you can't explain it.
[4:54] There's no way to do it. See, it's God's
[4:57] works and God's ways are unexplainable.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; They have to be accepted by faith.
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Then as I uh sit there a little bit the
[5:07] side of this chair, then all of a sudden
[5:10] hear it come back again. Then I knew
[5:12] then it was vision.
[5:15] And then when I come into the vision
[5:18] again, it seemed that I was lifted up
[5:22] and sitting on a a highway, a narrow
[5:27] highway with some brother. I never knew
[5:30] who the brother was. I looked around. I
[5:33] said, "Now I am sure and know this is
[5:36] vision. The Lord God is here."
[5:41] afraid. I said, "What's everybody so
[5:44] afraid of?" And a voice came and said,
[5:46] "There's such danger in these days.
[5:50] There's a great hideous thing that's
[5:52] death when it strikes you." And I heard
[5:55] the weeds are mashing down and I looked
[5:58] and here come a huge monster snake
[6:01] crawling through the weeds. I thought,
[6:03] "Now, knowing this is vision, then I
[6:05] shall see what this uh this animal or
[6:08] this beast is." and he crawled up on the
[6:12] highway and as soon as I got sight of
[6:14] him, I knew it was a mumba. Now, a mumba
[6:18] is an African snake, which is the most
[6:21] deadly bite of all things there is.
[6:26] There's nothing as poison as a mumba.
[6:29] And the snake of course represents sin,
[6:31] death.
[6:32] And uh there is the the we have in this
[6:35] country the rattlesnake and the copper
[6:38] head and the cotton mouth moccasin. Many
[6:40] of those snakes that if you're in bad
[6:42] health and want to bite you, it would
[6:44] perhaps kill you, but if you didn't get
[6:47] aid of some sort right away. And then uh
[6:50] then we go into Africa and India and we
[6:53] find the cobra. There's a black cobra.
[6:56] He's a bad snake. He's a death bite,
[6:59] too. And there's the yellow cobra which
[7:01] is far beyond him. And the yellow cobra
[7:05] uh the patient dies with such a horrible
[7:07] death it dies from suffocation. It it
[7:10] paralyzes a breathing system and they
[7:12] they can't breathe and just open their
[7:14] mouth and gapping trying to and die like
[7:17] that. And that was the type of snake
[7:19] with just one lick from getting Billy
[7:22] Paul when we got the snake in Africa.
[7:25] And then there comes the mamba. He's
[7:28] dead. Just when he he's so fast you
[7:30] can't see him. He goes over the top of
[7:33] the weeds and propels himself with the
[7:35] back of his tail. Just he's gone. Hits
[7:38] you in the face usually stands up high
[7:41] and strikes hard. And when he hits you,
[7:43] you've just got a few breaths till
[7:44] you're finished. Turn real. It don't
[7:46] only paralyze to get in the bloodstream.
[7:48] It gets nerves everything. You're just
[7:50] die just in a few seconds. them native
[7:53] boys and track boys, you can say, mumble
[7:55] and they'll butt their heads together
[7:56] and scream cause it's death just in a
[7:59] few seconds. See, when one hits him and
[8:01] here he was on the highway.
[8:03] I thought, well, this is it. So, I
[8:06] looked at him and he looked angry at me
[8:09] and he licked his tongue and here he
[8:11] come. But when he got right close to me,
[8:13] he'd run up fast and then he'd get
[8:15] slower and slower and just quiver and
[8:17] stop and then something hold him off. He
[8:19] couldn't bite me.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; And he turn around on the other side and
[8:22] try to approach from this side and he'd
[8:24] get back get a start and he sw towards
[8:26] me get slower and slower and slower and
[8:28] then to a stop and I just shake like
[8:30] that and move back. He couldn't strike
[8:32] him. Then he turned and looked at my
[8:35] friend and away he went after my friend
[8:38] and I seen my friend just jumping way in
[8:40] the air over him and over him and over
[8:42] him trying and a thing was striking at
[8:44] him. I thought, "Oh, if it ever hits
[8:45] him, it'll be instant death. No wonder
[8:48] everybody's so scared because when this
[8:50] thing hits you, it's an instant death.
[8:53] And and it was just striking him like
[8:55] that. I threw my hands up. I said, "Oh,
[8:57] God, have mercy on my brother." I said,
[9:00] "If that serpent ever strikes him, it'll
[9:02] kill him." And just then the serpent
[9:06] turned to me when I said that and looked
[9:09] at me again. And a voice came from above
[9:11] me and said, "You have been given power,
[9:16] &gt;&gt; dividing,
[9:18] &gt;&gt; the worst are any."
[9:21] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, God, what must I do?"
[9:24] He said, "There's one thing you must do.
[9:26] You must be more sincere.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; You must be more sincere." I said,
[9:32] "Well, God, forgive me for my
[9:34] uncincerity and let me have sincerity."
[9:37] And when I raised up my hands to him
[9:39] again, there was a great something came
[9:41] over me. Just lifted me up. Seemed like
[9:45] it my whole body was charged with
[9:47] something. And I looked at the serpent
[9:50] and then he started towards me and he
[9:52] couldn't do it yet. And I said, "Satan,
[9:55] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I
[9:59] bind you." And the serpent a blue smoke
[10:03] flew out of him and he curled up and
[10:06] made that sign like a S capital S made
[10:09] backwards. An sign and means bind this
[10:13] one or anything below him because he was
[10:15] the worst. Blue smoke fell out of him
[10:18] and his tail choked his own self to
[10:20] death around his head when he made this
[10:22] backwards s that and sign like a
[10:25] conjunction you see. Choked it to death.
[10:27] and the brother was free and I went over
[10:30] and mashed on it. I said, "Now I've got
[10:32] to find out about this because it's
[10:34] vision." And I hit on the on the thing
[10:36] and it turned like that looked like a
[10:38] handle on a glass handle on a pitcher
[10:41] just made it solid crystal. And I said,
[10:44] "Think of that how quick that blue smoke
[10:46] was life and everything it left it all
[10:48] the elements and it's turned to glass."
[10:51] And just then a voice came again and
[10:53] said, "You can unbind him also." So I
[10:57] said, "Then Satan that I might know, I
[11:00] unbind you." And when he did, he started
[11:03] coming to life again, wiggling. And I
[11:05] said, "I bind you back in the name of
[11:08] Jesus Christ." And when he did, the
[11:10] smoke flew out of him again. And he
[11:12] choked himself right back again and
[11:14] turned to crystal.
[11:16] And then when he did that, that voice
[11:18] said, "Now you must be more sincere than
[11:22] what you are to hear this." Oh, glory.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Then it left me and I was standing in
[11:28] the room.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; A few moments I heard the clock go off
[11:31] and my wife had got getting up. The
[11:34] children, you know how it is. I guess
[11:36] it's your house. One, what am I going to
[11:37] wear today, mama? Where are my books?
[11:39] And what did I do? You know, you just
[11:41] like any home, you can't you hear
[11:44] yourself think hardly for all of them
[11:46] trying to get ready at once. And and so
[11:48] I slipped off into the den room and I
[11:51] got out on my knees and I said, "Lord
[11:53] Jesus,
[11:55] I don't know these things and what must
[11:58] I do?" And the children me called me to
[12:01] take them to school in a few moments.
[12:03] What must I do? And I looked around and
[12:06] my Bible was laying there and I said,
[12:08] "Lord,
[12:09] if you will forgive me, I do not believe
[12:13] in just opening up the scripture and
[12:15] taking something out of the Bible and
[12:16] saying that, but there is times that
[12:20] when God can comfort you by such a
[12:22] thing,
[12:23] &gt;&gt; and I said, Lord, in this case of
[12:25] emergency right now before your spirit
[12:28] leaves me and I I don't know what to do,
[12:30] the kids will be an hour yet before they
[12:32] be gone. would you just show me if that
[12:34] was something you're trying to get to
[12:36] me, heavenly father, then
[12:39] let me know. And I took this Bible and
[12:42] just pulled it open like that. And my
[12:44] thumb was laying at first Corinthians
[12:47] the 5th chapter, the 8th verse. When
[12:50] something reads something like this,
[12:52] when you come, I was planning on taking
[12:54] a fast to the Lord.
[12:57] I told him I'd go out and fast. said
[12:59] when you come to this feast which a fast
[13:02] in the body is a feast with the Lord. We
[13:05] know that. So when you come to this
[13:07] feast, don't come with the old 11 or the
[13:11] leaven of malice and so forth, but come
[13:14] with the the unele
[13:21] truth. Just exactly what he had told me
[13:23] in the vision. Come, God is my solemn
[13:25] judge. come with the uneven bread of
[13:28] sincerity and truth. That is the word.
[13:32] Then I seen what he meant as he years
[13:34] ago when I seen the Bible come down. I
[13:36] got it wrote right here. Come down and a
[13:39] hand came from heaven and pointed down
[13:41] to Joshua and read the first nine verses
[13:44] and stopped there. That's Joshua
[13:48] come through the wilderness. But never
[13:50] did he was ready. When he got near
[13:53] Jordan, God called him out.
[13:56] said, "This day I'll begin to magnify
[13:58] you before the people." And then he took
[14:00] the children of Israel across Jordan to
[14:04] the land where give them divided to them
[14:06] the promised land.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; I went to the woods and prayed and
[14:11] prayed and fasted.
[14:14] And now
[14:16] I went back to that tree where I met
[14:20] where those squirrels was that you've
[14:21] heard in other messages. See where those
[14:24] squirrels was. And standing there along
[14:26] about 3 or four o'clock in the morning,
[14:28] Ed staggered through the brush for what
[14:30] light I could see to get to the tree,
[14:32] coming early because I was led there.
[14:35] Then I met him.
[14:38] God helped me to ever live true.
[14:43] But
[15:30] Oh my
[15:36] [Music]
[15:38] with me through fire.

[1:03:34] Ain't nobody got a right like the
[1:03:37] children of the Lord who seen the light.
[1:03:39] Been redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[1:03:45] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[1:03:50] Well, glory.
[1:03:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:03:56] Amen.
[1:03:58] I've got it right. Well, aren't you glad
[1:04:00] you've got this right?
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus paid that we could have the all
[1:04:11] the benefits
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; all the benefits
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; of Calvary. And I'm so thankful for that
[1:04:17] here today. Amen. And we enjoyed that.
[1:04:19] Did you enjoy that song?
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] And what can we say for sister Phelise?
[1:04:31] Amen. Come Jesus, come.
[1:04:39] As we were as she was singing that song
[1:04:42] and Amen.
[1:04:45] Uh I had never heard of of uh that that
[1:04:50] man. What's his name? Kurt. Kurt.
[1:04:53] Charlie Kirk.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Charlie Kirk.
[1:04:57] Uh, I guess I'm behind times,
[1:05:00] but you know, um, a conservative figure
[1:05:04] that's that's, um, that you young people
[1:05:06] would, I guess, probably know. And how
[1:05:10] he was assassinated the other day there
[1:05:13] there on on the campus and
[1:05:16] and you look at this world and it and it
[1:05:18] is just it's just it's just crazy. It's
[1:05:21] insane.
[1:05:23] And we we see these things and
[1:05:27] and um
[1:05:30] there's no answer.
[1:05:32] There's there's no answer. Whether
[1:05:34] you're a conservative,
[1:05:36] Republican or a or a Democrat, it's it's
[1:05:39] it's all just it's all just filth.
[1:05:46] And there's not there's no one there's
[1:05:47] no Superman here on the earth. And we
[1:05:49] know that the earth is looking for a
[1:05:52] superman and a superman will come and
[1:05:56] we're really near where there's going to
[1:05:58] rise the man of sin that is that is
[1:06:01] going to try to console the world and
[1:06:03] lead the world.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; But it's pretty incredible
[1:06:09] that the very one God's Messiah
[1:06:14] God's Messiah is here.
[1:06:17] the bride of Jesus Christ. That's
[1:06:20] we've got something for the world, but
[1:06:22] the world doesn't want it. World doesn't
[1:06:25] want what you have.
[1:06:29] But I'm so thankful that we can take
[1:06:31] this take the words of life and the Holy
[1:06:34] Spirit as we have heard this weekend
[1:06:37] just service after service line upon
[1:06:40] line the presence of the Lord coming in
[1:06:44] and and confirming your faith. Listen
[1:06:47] friends, you have something that the
[1:06:49] world is looking for.
[1:06:52] You have a reality
[1:06:55] that no conservative figure can give
[1:06:57] you.
[1:06:58] And we're thankful for a little shine
[1:07:00] light shining. Amen. I've listened to a
[1:07:02] few clips of of Charlie and and uh we're
[1:07:06] we're glad for for light shining. But
[1:07:09] brother, you're more important than any
[1:07:12] kind of a figure. Just live Jesus
[1:07:14] Christ.
[1:07:15] Live Jesus right there in your schools,
[1:07:18] right there in your community. You have
[1:07:21] what this world needs. And though as a
[1:07:23] whole the world has turned it down, but
[1:07:25] there is still somebody out there
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; that needs to hear what you have,
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; they need what you've got.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] As we get ready for the word of the Lord
[1:07:38] here tonight, we What can we say about
[1:07:41] the service this morning?
[1:07:45] My
[1:07:47] Well, glory
[1:07:55] That was that was a wonderful wonderful
[1:07:57] message this morning and we we
[1:08:00] appreciate our our brother Zachary.
[1:08:03] Amen. Rapturing faith and uh brother
[1:08:07] Ronnie Long is is not a he's not a
[1:08:10] stranger to any of us. Uh, brother
[1:08:13] Ronnie is is um
[1:08:16] uh you know, give him a little rose here
[1:08:20] in in on this side then then wait till
[1:08:24] he's gone. But brother Ronnie is one of
[1:08:27] the most giving men that I I have ever
[1:08:29] known. If you're around Ronnie, he's
[1:08:31] going to be serving you somehow someway.
[1:08:35] And and and we we love brother Ronnie.
[1:08:39] We were we were building the building
[1:08:41] here and and uh he he pulled in when we
[1:08:44] were doing some concrete work, you know,
[1:08:46] doing the footers and and uh uh he he
[1:08:50] beat us to the concrete truck to to pay
[1:08:53] for the bill. And you know, just little
[1:08:55] little things of that. And and um every
[1:08:58] one of these men that that have
[1:09:00] ministered are are some of the most
[1:09:03] giving men. And I I say I'd say today
[1:09:06] that that uh all of these ministers,
[1:09:10] Amen. whether they've preached uh this
[1:09:13] meeting or or or not, we have got
[1:09:16] ministers who are examples.
[1:09:20] They're not just wanting to preach, but
[1:09:23] these guys have got a heart for the
[1:09:24] kingdom of God. And I I appreciate all
[1:09:28] of these. And I I and I'm not just
[1:09:30] saying it just to say they're because
[1:09:32] they're my buddies. I'm saying we are
[1:09:35] blessed
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; to have men who care for the people.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're very blessed to have men
[1:09:45] that have given their lives for the
[1:09:47] cause of Jesus Christ. And we we just
[1:09:51] want to say God bless them all. As we
[1:09:54] get ready for brother Ronnie to come,
[1:09:56] we're going to have a prayer line if the
[1:09:58] Lord leads brother Ronnie that way. Uh
[1:10:00] we're not going to put God in a box.
[1:10:02] just however the Lord wants to work. But
[1:10:05] um Amen. And so we just want him to just
[1:10:08] preach as the Lord would lead him. And I
[1:10:11] wonder if we could just all stand here
[1:10:13] tonight and and um as we change the
[1:10:16] order of the service.
[1:10:19] How many needs the Lord?

[1:10:30] got to be.

[1:10:36] of
[1:10:38] you.

[1:11:39] to surrender everything that I am to
[1:11:41] you. I want to dedicate myself to the
[1:11:45] cause of Jesus Christ.

[1:11:51] want to be faithful to believe it. Give
[1:11:54] me courage to believe. Lord, give me
[1:11:58] courage to stand up to the plate as a
[1:12:00] believer and say, "I'm going to stand
[1:12:02] against all the odds tonight, and I'm
[1:12:04] going to believe your word.

[1:13:36] is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great
[1:13:43] is our God and all will see how great,
[1:13:51] how great
[1:13:54] is our God. How great, how great,

[1:14:16] and all will see how great
[1:14:21] how great
[1:14:24] is our God. Oh, I like this part right
[1:14:28] here. He's the name above every name.
[1:14:31] He's the name above
[1:14:35] all name. Oh Lord, you're worthy of
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:54] Oh, I don't know what they name the
[1:14:55] devil, but his name is above every other
[1:14:58] name. Oh, he's the name above.
[1:15:05] Oh yes, he's worthy.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Worthy of our praise.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; And my heart will sing.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; My heart will sing. Oh, how great.
[1:15:21] Oh, I just want to lift his name one
[1:15:24] more time. He's the name above every
[1:15:26] name. Oh, he's the name.
[1:15:33] Yes, Jesus. Oh Lord, you're worthy of
[1:15:40] all praise.
[1:15:43] And my heart will sing. How great
[1:15:50] is our God.
[1:15:54] Let's just sing it now. How great. Oh,
[1:15:58] how great
[1:16:01] is God.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, you are great and greatly to be
[1:16:04] praised, Lord.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Your name is above every name, Father.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One day all men will see how
[1:16:15] great you are.
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:18] Yes, Lord.
[1:16:20] [Music]
[1:16:22] Oh, hallelujah. Can you give the Lord a
[1:16:24] clap offering tonight?
[1:16:27] He's the Lord of Lords and the King of
[1:16:29] Kings. He's worthy of our praise. He's
[1:16:32] worthy of all that we could give him.
[1:16:34] There is no other name to be lifted up
[1:16:37] on high but the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:39] There is no other name by which we can
[1:16:41] be saved but the name of Jesus. There is
[1:16:43] no name by which we can be healed, but
[1:16:45] the name of Jesus. And I believe it
[1:16:47] should be on everyone's lips in this
[1:16:49] age. The name of Jesus Christ is what
[1:16:52] set the captive free. Amen. Amen. It's
[1:16:55] going to be in the house of the Lord.
[1:16:57] Such an honor to be here tonight, a part
[1:16:59] of these services and this meeting. Of
[1:17:01] course, to be able to stand behind a
[1:17:03] pulpit like Brother Wendles and just put
[1:17:06] my shoulder to the wheel with, you know,
[1:17:08] it's just you, you think as a,
[1:17:11] you know, growing up in some of these
[1:17:13] some of these seats as just a young boy
[1:17:14] looking at some of these heroes, you
[1:17:16] know, you you see preaching and you
[1:17:18] think, my, you know, I wish I could do
[1:17:21] something to help, but then you just let
[1:17:22] time go on a little bit and and u it's
[1:17:25] such an honor to just be standing with
[1:17:27] you, Brother Wendell, and all these
[1:17:29] brothers and men
[1:17:31] men of God that are gathered here
[1:17:33] together. And as we know, we're not here
[1:17:35] to hear any man, but we're here to hear
[1:17:37] from the throne of heaven.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; I believe that if we just call on his
[1:17:41] name, he comes where he's invited. I
[1:17:43] believe we feel him amongst us. We feel
[1:17:45] him in the praises of his people. But I
[1:17:48] wonder just now if you could just have
[1:17:49] something specific on your heart that
[1:17:52] you just like to bring before the Lord
[1:17:53] now. And I believe I believe he's still
[1:17:56] a discerner. I believe the person of the
[1:17:59] word is still a discerner.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for another Messiah
[1:18:03] sign or another gift in a man, but we're
[1:18:05] looking for the word to come
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; and discern what we have need of. Just
[1:18:10] lift that specific need to the Lord
[1:18:12] tonight. Father, we love you, Lord. We
[1:18:15] thank you for your word to us, Lord.
[1:18:18] Your grace that continues to abound,
[1:18:20] Father. Lord, when we were Lord
[1:18:23] unworthy, unmmerited, Lord, nobody
[1:18:25] desired upon us, Lord. Your grace has
[1:18:28] found us, Lord. Father, and you gave us
[1:18:30] this word of eternal life, Lord, that we
[1:18:32] could draw from you, Lord. And Father,
[1:18:34] be partakers of your cup tonight, Lord.
[1:18:37] Be partakers of your body, Father. Lord,
[1:18:40] what an honor it is, Father. Lord, to
[1:18:42] come and gather, Lord, with so many of
[1:18:44] like faith that have come with a desire
[1:18:46] from you, Lord. Lord, knowing that
[1:18:49] there's no way out of our situation, but
[1:18:51] less it be by you, Father. And Lord, I
[1:18:54] pray, Lord, as those needs were, Lord,
[1:18:56] brought to the mind and brought to the
[1:18:58] heart of these believers tonight, Lord,
[1:19:00] you're the God that can fix every
[1:19:01] situation, Lord. You're the God that can
[1:19:04] Lord, break loose every chain, every
[1:19:06] shackle, Father, every fear is defeated
[1:19:08] in your presence, Lord. For, Father,
[1:19:11] we've just sung about it. Your name is
[1:19:12] above every name, Father. Lord, some
[1:19:15] might call it cancer. Some might call it
[1:19:17] anxiety. Some might call it fear, Lord.
[1:19:20] Some might call it unrest, confusion.
[1:19:22] Lord, whatever the name of it is, Lord,
[1:19:24] your name is greater than that thing,
[1:19:26] Father. And Lord, we lift your name up,
[1:19:28] Father. We lift you high in this place,
[1:19:30] Lord. We ask that you would take the
[1:19:32] high place among us, Father. We exalt
[1:19:34] you, Lord. We, Lord, we cast down our
[1:19:36] problems. We cast down our opinions, our
[1:19:39] ideas, Lord, but we exalt your name high
[1:19:41] and lifted up in this place, Father, for
[1:19:44] Lord, you're worthy of all we could
[1:19:45] give. Let every breath, Lord, go to
[1:19:47] praise you, Father, tonight. Lord, may
[1:19:50] you just have your way, Father. Thank
[1:19:52] you for a group of believers that would,
[1:19:54] Lord, uh, dedicate themselves, Father,
[1:19:56] that would provide a building, Father.
[1:19:58] Lord, a Lord, a place we could gather
[1:20:00] out of the wind and out of the rain.
[1:20:02] But, Lord, as we heard, we are the
[1:20:03] tabernacles of your Holy Ghost, Father.
[1:20:06] And Lord, we thank you that there's
[1:20:07] tabernacles gathered tonight, Lord, that
[1:20:09] could come under the shed blood of Jesus
[1:20:11] Christ, Lord, where we're created equal,
[1:20:14] Father. Lord, we're all made in your
[1:20:15] image and in your likeness, Lord.
[1:20:17] There's not any big ones or little ones
[1:20:19] among us, Lord, but you are the God of
[1:20:21] every life in this building, Lord. And
[1:20:23] Father, we just ask that you would have
[1:20:25] your way tonight, Lord. Let your word
[1:20:27] come forth, Father. May you anoint,
[1:20:29] Lord, the lips to speak it. And may you
[1:20:31] anoint the ears to receive it tonight,
[1:20:32] Lord. Father, we we know that we have a
[1:20:35] great need of you in this hour, Father.
[1:20:38] Lord, where the world is in turmoil and
[1:20:40] Lord, where they're tossed to and fro,
[1:20:43] Lord, you have promised us a direction
[1:20:45] in this age, Lord, that we could have a
[1:20:47] straight line followed to to follow,
[1:20:49] Lord, that we could take it on home into
[1:20:51] eternity, Lord. That's our desire
[1:20:53] tonight, Lord. And may it even be so,
[1:20:56] Father, that Lord, in just these few
[1:20:58] moments left in this world, that Lord,
[1:21:00] we would march into that eternal home in
[1:21:03] complete victory. Father, I pray that
[1:21:04] you would break chains tonight. Lord,
[1:21:07] let your word do the work. Father, we
[1:21:09] pray as we give ourselves to you, Lord,
[1:21:12] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:15] Amen. And amen. If you have your Bibles,
[1:21:19] we'll turn to the book of Philippians,
[1:21:20] the fourth chapter.
[1:21:24] Amen. What can we say about these
[1:21:26] services so far?
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; It's been a
[1:21:30] real blessing and just a privilege to
[1:21:32] preach alongside such men of God. and uh
[1:21:35] you know
[1:21:38] traveling around some and you know
[1:21:40] people ask well what calling are you or
[1:21:42] what what office do you fill and man I
[1:21:45] always thought of brother Zachary as a
[1:21:46] as a missionary but today
[1:21:51] I heard a whole another level of brother
[1:21:52] Zachary's ministry and my goodness I was
[1:21:55] just
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; I just I look what the Lord has done
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; look what the Lord is doing through
[1:22:02] through his his surrendered vessels.
[1:22:04] Amen. Amen. Of course, just preaching
[1:22:07] alongside some buddies and some old
[1:22:08] buddies and some new buddies. And
[1:22:10] there's just no greater place than
[1:22:12] around the carcass. Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Like to read Philippians 4 and we'll
[1:22:17] just begin at the fourth verse.
[1:22:20] Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I
[1:22:23] say, rejoice.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Let your moderation be known unto all
[1:22:27] men. The Lord is at hand. Be careful for
[1:22:31] nothing, but in everything by prayer and
[1:22:34] supplication with thanksgiving, let your
[1:22:36] requests be made known unto God. And the
[1:22:39] peace of God which passes all
[1:22:42] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:22:44] minds through Christ Jesus. And the 19th
[1:22:47] verse would read, but my God shall
[1:22:50] supply all your need
[1:22:54] according to his riches in glory by
[1:22:56] Christ Jesus. Now unto God our father be
[1:22:59] glory forever and ever. Amen. You could
[1:23:03] be seated tonight as God could bless his
[1:23:05] word to us.
[1:23:07] Like to just take a title out of that
[1:23:08] context of scripture.
[1:23:11] Rejoice again. I say rejoice.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we just trust the Lord to help
[1:23:17] us tonight as I just want to share some
[1:23:20] of this inspiration I gathered from the
[1:23:22] word and just did a blessing for me and
[1:23:23] I felt that maybe it would bless some of
[1:23:25] us tonight
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; that we are rejoicing in the Lord. Amen.
[1:23:28] Now many of the afflictions of the
[1:23:30] righteous but the Lord delivers us out
[1:23:33] of them all. Amen. There's so many
[1:23:34] things going on in this world. So many
[1:23:36] indecisions, so many confusions, so many
[1:23:38] directions being made. And but I believe
[1:23:41] that that those under the shed blood
[1:23:44] word in this hour, they have a direction
[1:23:46] set. There's a light turned on. We're
[1:23:47] not groping in darkness, but we have a
[1:23:49] sure destination that we're headed for.
[1:23:52] And I believe that it's the devil's
[1:23:53] desire, he cannot stop us from reaching
[1:23:56] our destination, but he can distract us
[1:23:58] from looking at where our destination
[1:24:00] is. And he can distract us to the right
[1:24:02] and to the left. And though he cannot
[1:24:03] take away our elect seed, he can sure
[1:24:06] take away the victory on the way there.
[1:24:08] But I would like to present the idea
[1:24:10] tonight that we can go all the way there
[1:24:12] with victory. We don't have to go
[1:24:14] ashamedly or burdened down, but we can
[1:24:16] go all the way there with victory in our
[1:24:19] voice and victory in our atmosphere and
[1:24:22] victory in our worship. I believe that
[1:24:24] God has made a way and the word is more
[1:24:26] powerful in this age than any oppression
[1:24:29] that the devil can put on. If you're
[1:24:30] waiting for the lid of hell to be lifted
[1:24:32] off, you don't need to wait any longer.
[1:24:34] But the lid of hell has already lifted
[1:24:36] off into this age. There's already
[1:24:38] 200,000,000 demons released into this
[1:24:40] age. They're already attacking you. So,
[1:24:43] you're not waiting for a squeeze to
[1:24:44] come, but the squeeze has already come
[1:24:46] on the bride. And I say we're still here
[1:24:48] because greater is he that is in us than
[1:24:51] he that has come out of hell. And
[1:24:53] whatever has come out of hell, it could
[1:24:55] not stop you or it would have done it
[1:24:57] already. But you're still here because
[1:24:59] greater is the experience of the message
[1:25:01] of the hour than those unbelieving
[1:25:04] spirits that would attack your mind and
[1:25:05] get you to go to and fro. But he's
[1:25:07] already come. And I believe I believe if
[1:25:09] the devil has already come, then Christ
[1:25:11] has already come as well. We're not
[1:25:13] waiting for a bride's revival as we
[1:25:15] heard this morning to come. We're not
[1:25:16] waiting to be awakened to the to the
[1:25:19] opening of the word, but we have already
[1:25:20] entered into the opening of the word.
[1:25:22] And I believe it's time that we enjoy
[1:25:24] the blessings of an open word. Let's not
[1:25:27] be sorrowful and fast and pray wondering
[1:25:29] if one day he'll come. But he has
[1:25:32] already come. And when he comes, he
[1:25:34] comes with healing in his wings. He
[1:25:36] comes with power and his authority. And
[1:25:38] I believe Christ has come down this age
[1:25:40] not that we could be wanting for
[1:25:41] anything but that our joys might be
[1:25:44] full. Because what is the point of
[1:25:46] living under a manifested word if
[1:25:48] there's no manifestation of it taking
[1:25:50] place? But I believe it's time to put on
[1:25:52] the word and manifest the power of God.
[1:25:55] Now, we know as men, there's no power in
[1:25:57] us. You could not defeat the devil if it
[1:25:59] was toe-to-toe with just you and him.
[1:26:00] But it's not you verse the devil. It's
[1:26:03] God verse the devil because the one
[1:26:05] inside of you is the one who already
[1:26:07] defeated the devil. So therefore, it's
[1:26:08] not your experience or your testimony
[1:26:10] that's defeating the devil, but it's
[1:26:12] that Holy Ghost experience inside of you
[1:26:14] that has already defeated the devil. And
[1:26:17] when he looks at you, he can say, "I've
[1:26:19] seen those eyes before and they have
[1:26:21] defeated me before." This is a battle
[1:26:24] that the devil has already lost. and
[1:26:26] that Holy Ghost experience inside of you
[1:26:29] will win the victory every time. I don't
[1:26:33] believe we need to back up.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; I don't believe this is a time as a end
[1:26:37] time believer that we should retreat or
[1:26:39] lay low under a rock somewhere. I
[1:26:41] believe this is a time to press the
[1:26:43] battle. I believe this is a time to go
[1:26:45] to war. I I believe that what happens in
[1:26:47] the natural types of spiritual. And I I
[1:26:49] noticed the other day that that our
[1:26:51] president Trump, he changed the name of
[1:26:53] the Department of Defense.
[1:26:55] He changed it to the Department of War.
[1:26:58] And I thought, "Yeah, it's about time
[1:26:59] for the bride to change from being on
[1:27:01] the defense to being on the offense. We
[1:27:04] are not defending anything, but we are
[1:27:06] men of war. And he has instructed our
[1:27:08] hands how to war against the devil. We
[1:27:11] are not defending anything, but this
[1:27:13] message has already been vindicated, and
[1:27:15] it has already been proven. And I am not
[1:27:18] in defense of anything, but I am
[1:27:20] marching forward in victory because I
[1:27:22] have been given a token possession that
[1:27:24] takes me across into the promised land.
[1:27:27] I believe we ought to exercise our
[1:27:28] rights in this age.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; I don't believe we ought to back down to
[1:27:31] what the devil tells you your experience
[1:27:33] could be.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; What would the devil know about having a
[1:27:35] victorious experience? He's never had
[1:27:37] one.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; The devil has never had a real victory.
[1:27:40] So, how would he know what it feels like
[1:27:42] to have a victorious experience? Amen.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says in second Timothy
[1:27:46] this, "Know also that in the last days
[1:27:48] perilous times shall come."
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; I believe we're there.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Believe you can look around and see that
[1:27:54] we're in perilous times.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; For men shall be lovers and their own
[1:27:58] selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
[1:27:59] blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
[1:28:01] unthankful, unholy,
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; without natural affection, truce
[1:28:05] breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
[1:28:07] fierce, despisers of those that are
[1:28:08] good.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; My, are we there or are we not there?
[1:28:13] traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of
[1:28:15] pleasures more than lovers of God,
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; having a form of godliness, but denying
[1:28:21] the power thereof,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; from such turn away.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; For of this sort they have they they
[1:28:27] which creep into houses and lead
[1:28:28] captives silly women laden with sins,
[1:28:31] led away with diverse lust, ever
[1:28:33] learning, and ever able to come to the
[1:28:36] knowledge of the truth. Now, as Janice
[1:28:38] and Jambre withtood Moses, so do these
[1:28:40] also resist the truth. Men of corrupt
[1:28:43] minds reprobate concerning the faith.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad we don't stop there.
[1:28:47] There's another verse.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; But they shall proceed no further.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; They shall proceed no further, for their
[1:28:58] folly shall be made manifest unto all
[1:29:01] men as theirs also was. Speaking of
[1:29:04] Janice and Jambas. So just as Janice and
[1:29:06] Jambas fell to the anointed word of the
[1:29:08] hour, so will all this list of
[1:29:10] characteristics fall to the anointed
[1:29:12] word of the hour, they shall not proceed
[1:29:15] any further. They shall not succeed in
[1:29:17] your life. Can I say it like Isaiah said
[1:29:19] it? No weapon that is formed against you
[1:29:22] shall prosper. But no weapon, I don't
[1:29:25] care what it's called. I don't care what
[1:29:26] you put in. Isaiah 54, we'll just read
[1:29:28] it. In righteousness shalt thou be
[1:29:30] established. Now, Brother Zachary
[1:29:32] covered this this morning. I I thank you
[1:29:34] for the groundwork. In righteousness of
[1:29:36] grace shalt thou be established. Thou
[1:29:38] shalt be far from oppression, for thou
[1:29:41] shalt not fear from terror, for it shall
[1:29:43] not come near thee. Behold, they shall
[1:29:45] surely gather together, but not by me.
[1:29:47] Whosoever shall gather together against
[1:29:49] thee shall fall for thy sake.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; You ever think that your enemies have
[1:29:54] gathered together against you? I believe
[1:29:56] this prophecy is for you. They shall
[1:29:58] fall for thy sake. Behold, I have
[1:30:00] created the smith that bloweth the coals
[1:30:02] in the fire, and that bringeth forth an
[1:30:04] instrument for his work. And I have
[1:30:06] created the waster to destroy. No weapon
[1:30:10] that is formed against thee shall
[1:30:12] prosper, and every tongue that shall
[1:30:14] rise against thee in judgment, thou
[1:30:16] shalt condemn. This is the heritage of
[1:30:19] the servants of the Lord, and their
[1:30:21] righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.
[1:30:24] Somebody say, "No weapon."
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; No weapon.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; No weapon.
[1:30:28] I don't care what you call it. I don't
[1:30:30] care what spirit of unbelief it is. I
[1:30:31] don't care what discouragement it is. I
[1:30:33] don't care what sickness it is. No
[1:30:36] weapon that is formed against you shall
[1:30:38] prosper. Thus saith the Lord.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; And I believe those weapons were
[1:30:43] designed in this age. We're not fighting
[1:30:45] the same weapons that they fought back
[1:30:46] there. But there's weapons that the
[1:30:48] devil has designed for you. But I want
[1:30:50] to declare to the devil tonight, no
[1:30:52] weapon that he can make will prosper
[1:30:54] against the anointed bride in this hour
[1:30:57] because she is built to be an overcomer.
[1:31:00] She will not fall to the weapon of
[1:31:02] unbelief. She will not fall like Eve
[1:31:04] fell. Eve is not our type. But we are a
[1:31:07] true bride that will stay with the word
[1:31:10] no matter what comes, no matter what
[1:31:12] goes. We are going to stay with the word
[1:31:15] of God. and no weapon of unbelief shall
[1:31:17] prosper against me because I was not
[1:31:19] formed in that way. I was formed before.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; I didn't come after the weapon. I came
[1:31:25] before the weapon.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; I believe that we're anointed for the
[1:31:33] challenge of the hour.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; And I believe the message meet end time
[1:31:36] challenges. Is that right?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; I believe that this is a season that we
[1:31:40] rise in victory. I don't believe that
[1:31:41] this is a time to to go down in defeat.
[1:31:44] Amen.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord spoke very clearly to
[1:31:47] me. I want to preach to you this
[1:31:49] weekend.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; And I I He told me to come here and tell
[1:31:51] you this is not a time to go down in
[1:31:53] defeat, but this is a time to rejoice.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Again, I say rejoice.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; This is not a time to get discouraged.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Of course, there's disappointments. Of
[1:32:06] course, there's defeats. Of course,
[1:32:08] people are going to leave you. And
[1:32:09] people are going to forsake you. And
[1:32:11] your body might be sick. And you might
[1:32:13] be yelling tonight, but this is not a
[1:32:15] time to give up. This is a time to g up
[1:32:18] your loins and rise to the occasion as
[1:32:20] an overcomer of Leodysia. You knew the
[1:32:23] battle was going to be hot, but you were
[1:32:25] built to overcome the battle. You knew
[1:32:27] that the devil was going to release the
[1:32:29] best he had. Let me say, Miguel, in this
[1:32:31] age, the devil has brought his best. But
[1:32:34] I want to let the devil know, God has
[1:32:36] also brought his best. And God's best
[1:32:38] will defeat the devil every time. You
[1:32:41] are the best that God's got. He didn't
[1:32:44] just send you into this age just by
[1:32:46] happen stance, but he sent the best that
[1:32:49] he had in the back part of his mind as
[1:32:51] an overcomer in this age. You are the
[1:32:54] best.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; I am not preaching to a watered down
[1:32:57] Leodysian bride. I am preaching to the
[1:33:00] unadulterated, spotless, perfect bride
[1:33:03] of Jesus Christ. And I came to tell you,
[1:33:06] you're the best God's got.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:11] [Applause]
[1:33:18] And I believe if God made something to
[1:33:20] be an overcomer, to be a victor,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; then there is nothing that can come to
[1:33:25] defeat that purpose.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; There is nothing that can come to
[1:33:28] supervent the purpose of God. But what
[1:33:30] God has made is perfect the first time.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; I believe he made us for a position. I
[1:33:37] believe he made us to carry out his
[1:33:38] work. I believe the fullness of times
[1:33:40] has come in this age.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And while they could not be made perfect
[1:33:44] without us, I believe we have a position
[1:33:46] in that.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; I believe we have a part to play. You
[1:33:50] might think that you're just going to
[1:33:51] church tonight or you might have come
[1:33:52] this weekend just to sit in a pew and
[1:33:54] hear some songs and maybe get some
[1:33:56] buffet afterwards, but you actually came
[1:33:58] in the back part of the mind of God.
[1:34:00] Before there was a trial, there was you.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Before there was ever a trial of
[1:34:06] Leodysia, you were already here. You're
[1:34:09] already wearing what you wear. You
[1:34:10] already look like what you look like.
[1:34:11] Because in the mind of God, he was not
[1:34:14] surprised by 2025.
[1:34:16] But God has predestinated you. And I
[1:34:19] don't believe he predestinated you to be
[1:34:21] an almost made it. I believe he
[1:34:23] predestinated you to be an overcomer,
[1:34:26] victorious in every battle. Yes, we're
[1:34:28] going to we're going to have some
[1:34:30] defeats and discouragement, but that's
[1:34:31] not the end of our story. The end of my
[1:34:34] story is an eternal destination.
[1:34:39] Everything the devil can put on you is
[1:34:41] temporary.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; There is nothing permanent. Cuz when the
[1:34:45] devil ceases to exist and he is he is
[1:34:47] lost in the lake of fire, I'll still be
[1:34:50] singing Amazing Grace and glory. When
[1:34:52] the devil of cancer has been cast into
[1:34:54] the lake of fire, you will still be
[1:34:56] shouting the praises of God. The devil
[1:34:59] is a temporary enemy, but you are an
[1:35:02] eternal victor. The devil will not win
[1:35:04] this battle because God has already
[1:35:07] fought it for you. It's not you versus
[1:35:09] the devil. It's not your works versus
[1:35:12] the devil. It's God's perfect sinless
[1:35:14] son that has already defeated the devil.
[1:35:19] This is the awakening of the bride. This
[1:35:21] is what it means to be in the bride's
[1:35:23] revival. Where is the revival in Ponyie,
[1:35:26] Oklahoma? It better be on the inside of
[1:35:28] you. It's not coming one day. We're not
[1:35:31] waiting for another big preacher or
[1:35:33] another big meeting. This is the bride's
[1:35:36] revival in this stage.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; We have recognized the awakening of
[1:35:40] Christ.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Not looking for him.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; I know where he is.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; I know he's come down.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; And I know he's brought me into a
[1:35:50] position. I would like I I would like to
[1:35:53] just tell the devil his position for a
[1:35:55] few minutes.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; I believe all weekend we've heard about
[1:35:59] your position. I know the devil's
[1:36:01] listening.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; I know he's trying to plague minds and
[1:36:04] cause, you know, distractions and cause
[1:36:07] you to think about this. But I want to
[1:36:08] draw his attention to the word just now.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; I want to tell the devil what his
[1:36:12] position is.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; I believe if we have one, he also has
[1:36:16] one.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And I believe the hour has come for the
[1:36:19] son of man to be glorified.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; But I believe the hour has also come for
[1:36:23] the devil to be defeated.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; What side of what side of the victory
[1:36:27] are you on?
[1:36:29] Come on.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Matthew 20 would read like this. Then
[1:36:32] came to him the mother of Zebed's
[1:36:35] children with her sons worshiping him
[1:36:37] and desiring a certain certain thing of
[1:36:39] him. And he said unto her, "What wilt
[1:36:40] thou?" She said unto him, "Grant that
[1:36:42] these my two sons may sit, the one on
[1:36:44] the right hand, and the other on the
[1:36:47] left in thy kingdom." But Jesus answered
[1:36:49] and said, "You know not what you ask.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Are you able to drink of the cup that I
[1:36:54] shall drink of, and to be baptized with
[1:36:55] the baptism that I'm baptized with?"
[1:36:57] They said unto him, "We are able." And
[1:37:00] he said unto him, "Ye shall drink indeed
[1:37:01] of my cup and be baptized with the
[1:37:03] baptism that I'm baptized with, but to
[1:37:04] sit on my right hand and on my left is
[1:37:07] not mine to give,
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; but it shall be given to them."
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Somebody say them.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Them.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; It is prepared of my father.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; So there's somebody coming to fill that
[1:37:25] position.
[1:37:26] there's somebody that's going to come
[1:37:28] and fill that position. Now, this mother
[1:37:29] of the sons of Zebedee, she knew what
[1:37:31] she was asking for. She knew where the
[1:37:33] power laid in his kingdom. She knew
[1:37:36] exactly by revelation what she was
[1:37:38] asking for, but he said that position
[1:37:40] has not has not been given to you. It's
[1:37:42] been given to those that are prevailed
[1:37:44] of by my father. Now, she was referring
[1:37:46] back to Psalms 11:0. The Lord said unto
[1:37:49] my Lord, sit thou at my right hand until
[1:37:52] I make thine enemies
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; thy foottool. Yes, sir.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; She knew what she was asking for. The
[1:37:58] Lord shall send the rod of thy strength
[1:38:01] out of Zion, rule thou in the midst of
[1:38:04] thine enemies. Thy people shall be
[1:38:06] willing in the day of thy power. In the
[1:38:08] beauties of holiness from the womb of
[1:38:10] the morning, thou hast the due of thy
[1:38:13] youth.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; The Lord hath sworn, and he will not
[1:38:18] repent. Thou art a priest forever after
[1:38:21] the order of Melzdc. The Lord at thy
[1:38:23] right hand shall strike through kings in
[1:38:26] the day of his wrath. She knew exactly
[1:38:28] what she was asking for. She was asking
[1:38:30] for her sons to have a right to have
[1:38:32] their enemies as their foottool. But
[1:38:34] what he's telling her is this position
[1:38:36] to be over the devil has not yet been
[1:38:39] created.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; It's not mine to give, but it's of my
[1:38:44] father to them that are coming in the
[1:38:46] future. In a future day, there are those
[1:38:49] that can come. Now, this is not just a
[1:38:51] metaphor of sitting at the right hand of
[1:38:52] him in heaven, but this is an actual
[1:38:55] positionally placed believer over the
[1:38:58] the top of the devil. So, that means
[1:39:00] whatever the situation is, the devil is
[1:39:02] under your feet. Now, this could not
[1:39:04] come until the fullness of the word had
[1:39:06] come. And Jesus could not jump the cycle
[1:39:09] of God's plan. But to everything there's
[1:39:11] a season, and to everything there's a
[1:39:13] dispensation. He knew that it is not yet
[1:39:15] time for this to be fulfilled, but at
[1:39:18] the appointed time.
[1:39:22] Hallelujah.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; At the appointed time, this position
[1:39:26] will be given.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Cuz he knew
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; that it was coming.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Luke the 10th chapter. And
[1:39:34] he said unto them, I beheld Satan as
[1:39:35] lightning falling from heaven. Behold, I
[1:39:37] give unto you power to tread on serpents
[1:39:40] and scorpions, and over all the power of
[1:39:42] the enemy, and nothing, somebody say
[1:39:44] nothing. Nothing shall by any means hurt
[1:39:48] you.
[1:39:49] My that's enough room to dance right
[1:39:51] there. That serpents and scorpions. Now,
[1:39:53] he's not talking about the literal bug
[1:39:55] and the literal, he's talking about
[1:39:56] demon anointings, right? In Revelations
[1:39:58] 9, it would describe these demons,
[1:40:00] right? As having women uh like hair like
[1:40:02] women, and they would be scorpions, they
[1:40:03] would be snakes. And John the Baptist
[1:40:05] would deal with these things. And
[1:40:06] brother Brandon would deal the these
[1:40:08] things in the wilderness. They would
[1:40:09] look like he's telling you, you have
[1:40:10] power over every demonic force that is
[1:40:14] coming and now is.
[1:40:18] And I believe that they rejoiced in
[1:40:20] this.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Notwithstanding in this,
[1:40:23] rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[1:40:26] unto you, but rather rejoice because
[1:40:29] your names are written in heaven."
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, we have a reason to
[1:40:37] rejoice. The devil would like to tell
[1:40:39] you that your problem is bigger than the
[1:40:41] word of God. But the word told me that I
[1:40:44] have an appointment. My name has already
[1:40:46] been written on the book of life. And I
[1:40:49] cannot be defeated. This is not my end.
[1:40:52] This is not where I cease because I have
[1:40:55] to fulfill a work. Rejoice that your
[1:40:58] names are written in heaven. I don't
[1:41:01] believe that those names were written
[1:41:03] with an ink pen or a pencil or something
[1:41:05] you could erase. But before the
[1:41:07] foundation of the world, when the lamb
[1:41:09] was slain for the sins that would come
[1:41:11] forth, his blood was slain. And your
[1:41:14] name was written there by the lamb's
[1:41:16] blood. And it cannot be blotted out.
[1:41:20] Satan doesn't have any racer big enough
[1:41:22] to blot out the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:24] But what he wrote, it will last forever
[1:41:27] and forever.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; I believe we have representation in
[1:41:31] heaven. I believe we're predestinated to
[1:41:33] be here this morning or tonight.
[1:41:36] I believe you just happened here.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; But I believe at the same time your
[1:41:39] theophony
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; I believe the same time that your
[1:41:46] theophony was in the back part of the
[1:41:48] mind of God, your representation was
[1:41:50] done. The battle
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; was already over.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; You know the devil lost this battle
[1:41:58] before he ever fell from heaven.
[1:42:01] Lord,
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; you know, the devil was already defeated
[1:42:04] before. If if iniquity would have never
[1:42:07] been found in Lucifer, you would still
[1:42:10] be over him.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; You would still be above him. Who has
[1:42:16] more authority in heaven, an angel or a
[1:42:19] son of God? Before Lucifer ever was
[1:42:22] found in iniquity, you were already over
[1:42:24] the top of him as a son of God. He has
[1:42:28] no authority over you. He's a fallen
[1:42:30] angel out of his position and you are a
[1:42:33] bloodbought redeemed son of God coming
[1:42:36] back to the fullness of adoption in this
[1:42:38] age saying ye him.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; You realize that Satan will never have
[1:42:44] the power to hear ye him. He will never
[1:42:46] have a voice inside of him of authority.
[1:42:49] But you have already been given the
[1:42:50] voice of authority in this age.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; It's not coming. It's here.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; I believe we ought to put it to work
[1:42:56] tonight.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; I don't believe we should be defeated.
[1:42:59] Yes, we have we have circumstances, but
[1:43:02] you're not defeated.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; You have trials, but you're not giving
[1:43:07] up.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; You have questions in your mind, but
[1:43:11] you're still here.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Maybe you started out with some folks
[1:43:15] that aren't here today, but you're still
[1:43:17] here.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Rejoice that your names are written in
[1:43:26] heaven.
[1:43:28] It may look like a dark trial, but you
[1:43:31] can't lose.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; I know this is simple, simple preaching.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said it like this. When you
[1:43:37] become a Christian, you just can't lose.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; I love that quote. I put that on my
[1:43:44] fridge. I need to see that sometimes
[1:43:46] because when you become a real believer,
[1:43:48] it doesn't matter what the devil throws
[1:43:49] at you, you can't lose.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; You cannot be plucked from my father's
[1:43:54] hand. He cannot forget about you. For I
[1:43:56] know the thoughts that I think towards
[1:43:57] you. They are very specific thoughts.
[1:44:00] They are named Sam Parker. They are
[1:44:01] named Judah Martin. They are named
[1:44:03] Andrew Wheeler. They are very specific
[1:44:05] thoughts that I think in the back part
[1:44:06] of my mind. I know the thoughts that I
[1:44:08] think towards you. And I will not forget
[1:44:11] my thoughts. But I will give you an
[1:44:13] expected end. And that expected end is
[1:44:16] returning back to where we came from. I
[1:44:18] came from God and I'm going back to God.
[1:44:21] This is not the end of my story. And the
[1:44:25] devil would like you to wear all kinds
[1:44:26] of defeat and discouragement and you
[1:44:28] just don't understand. Oh yes, I
[1:44:30] understand. I'm also drudging through
[1:44:31] Leodysia. But I refuse. I refuse to let
[1:44:35] the anointing of a fallen angel dictate
[1:44:38] how I worship my God. I say we praise
[1:44:41] him when we feel like it and we praise
[1:44:43] him when we don't. We praise him when
[1:44:45] the spirit's moving. We praise him when
[1:44:47] we can't feel it because we are not
[1:44:50] circumstantial worshippers. But we came
[1:44:52] from God and we're going back to God.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; We are not just basing our walk on how
[1:44:58] we feel.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; But we have pre predestinated to
[1:45:02] overcome 2025.
[1:45:04] [Applause]
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; There is no one else that can do what
[1:45:08] you're doing or God would have sent
[1:45:10] them.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; But he sent you because you are an
[1:45:14] overcomer in this age.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; You're not defeated.
[1:45:20] You're on the winning side.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Didn't let the devil win.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; You're on the winning side. You got to
[1:45:28] recognize what side of the battle you're
[1:45:29] on. Stop identifying yourself with a
[1:45:32] defeated enemy. You are a risen child of
[1:45:35] God.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; You've been put here for the purpose of
[1:45:40] treading on serpents.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; There's no power within me. The devil
[1:45:45] would have destroyed me. But thanks be
[1:45:47] to God, he's not fighting me.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; He's fighting one greater than me that I
[1:45:53] have allowed to come on the inside of
[1:45:55] me. And when I surrender to him, he
[1:45:57] says, "Stand still. This is not your
[1:46:00] battle. For I will fight for you today.
[1:46:03] And these tormentors that you see today,
[1:46:07] you will see again no more forever. I am
[1:46:10] the Lord and I am mighty in battle." Oh,
[1:46:13] you've seen the Lord. You You seen him
[1:46:15] heal. You've seen him deliver, but why
[1:46:17] don't you watch him in battle tonight?
[1:46:19] Why don't you watch the Lord go to war
[1:46:21] over your situation? He knows how to
[1:46:24] fight.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; He's the greatest general that there
[1:46:26] ever was and ever is. And he's leading
[1:46:29] the charge tonight in your personal
[1:46:31] battle.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; This is not a man speaking or a man's
[1:46:35] idea of this message. This is Christ has
[1:46:38] come to give you the equipment that you
[1:46:40] need to overcome every enemy in this
[1:46:42] age.
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:45] I think it's time you recognize.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Take the ear muffs off.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Why am I here?
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Why have I been sent here to this age?
[1:46:54] Brother Windle mentioned that at the
[1:46:55] beginning of the service. If a man with
[1:46:58] limited understanding of the gospel
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; can give his life for the cause of
[1:47:03] Christ, how much more are we, the
[1:47:06] believer in this age that have a
[1:47:07] fullness of revelation, ought to live
[1:47:09] our life for the cause of Christ.
[1:47:11] I believe we ought to be the inspiration
[1:47:13] in this age, not another voice
[1:47:15] somewhere. I believe that the bride is
[1:47:17] the elected voice of this age and there
[1:47:20] is no other. But God has elected you to
[1:47:23] carry the mana for this time. It's not
[1:47:26] putting it off on somebody else. But I
[1:47:28] say, let the light shine among all men.
[1:47:32] This message is not something to be
[1:47:34] ashamed of. I am not ashamed to stand
[1:47:36] next to William Brandon. I am not
[1:47:38] ashamed to have a picture of Jesus
[1:47:40] coming in this age in my home or in my
[1:47:43] church.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; I believe it's a false anointed one that
[1:47:47] would try to get you to pull this
[1:47:48] picture out of the church. This is what
[1:47:50] makes us different than everybody else.
[1:47:53] I don't want to go back to denomination.
[1:47:56] I want to live the message of the hour.
[1:48:00] I don't want to be Pentecostal. I don't
[1:48:02] want to be Methodist. I am a message
[1:48:05] believer.
[1:48:07] I have been sent here for one purpose,
[1:48:09] to manifest the word of the hour.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; I believe it's time we become unashamed
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; of what we have been chosen to do.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Zachary laid it out so
[1:48:22] beautifully this morning with that
[1:48:24] example in his daughter.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; When somebody elects you,
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; they just pick you.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; When somebody picks you, they just pick
[1:48:34] you.
[1:48:36] She's the one,
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; brother Merl. When you picked her, you
[1:48:39] just picked her.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; That's the end of the story. Period.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; She's the one.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Now, imagine if you would pick somebody
[1:48:47] and then later they would be ashamed to
[1:48:49] claim you.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; That you would be given divine election
[1:48:53] of the message of the hour. Let me ask
[1:48:55] you, what did you do to earn this?
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Dale, what'd you do to get in
[1:48:58] the message of the hour?
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; It was grace, right? We heard it so
[1:49:01] beautiful this morning. race came down
[1:49:03] to your situation and imparted to you
[1:49:06] eternal life. And yet we find so many
[1:49:09] churches today and so many discouraged
[1:49:11] believers that are ashamed.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; I believe we should be unashamed.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; I believe that if you are ashamed before
[1:49:20] men, I'll be ashamed of you at that day.
[1:49:22] But I say I that is not my scripture.
[1:49:25] That is not my description. But I will
[1:49:28] claim to be a message believer with all
[1:49:30] that is within me. I will not back up on
[1:49:33] this word. I don't care what kind of
[1:49:35] distraction, what kind of negativity,
[1:49:37] what kind of question, what kind of
[1:49:39] circumstance. I am a message believer.
[1:49:44] [Applause]
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus Christ to me.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; This is why I was put here.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; I was preaching at a friend's a dear
[1:49:56] pastor friend's uh church in another
[1:49:59] country. And he said, 'You know, you you
[1:50:01] preach like that out somewhere and
[1:50:03] you're all over these these websites
[1:50:04] that that that are against the message.
[1:50:06] I said, "Well, praise God.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach it even harder now.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; You can take what I say and you could
[1:50:12] broadcast it across the world. I want
[1:50:14] the message to get out.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; I want to be identified, Brother Matt.
[1:50:18] They might call us fanatics, but I want
[1:50:20] to be the right fanatic. I want to be a
[1:50:22] fanatic for the right team. I don't want
[1:50:24] to just blend in with denomination and
[1:50:26] just to be a church member, but I am a
[1:50:29] son of God adopted in this age and I've
[1:50:32] been given full authority. And that only
[1:50:35] comes under the anointing of this
[1:50:37] message of the hour. You will not get
[1:50:39] that under TD Jake. You will not get
[1:50:41] that under under Dr. Dobson. You will
[1:50:44] not get that under Billy Graham. That
[1:50:46] only comes by a Melzdc priesthood that
[1:50:49] has descended in this age. And he has
[1:50:52] given you authority
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; and position. Rejoice. I say again,
[1:50:58] rejoice.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; You have been given power in this age,
[1:51:01] not just to tread on serpents,
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; but to have a confidence that your name
[1:51:06] is eternally written in the lamb's book
[1:51:09] of life, and it cannot be removed.
[1:51:16] I believe we ought to rise to the
[1:51:18] occasion.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Anybody can come to church and fulfill a
[1:51:21] Leodysian believer.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Anybody can do that.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Why are we fighting to stay in Leodysia?
[1:51:27] Anybody can blend in with Leodysia.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; But that's not the call of this age.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; The call of the age is to come out of
[1:51:35] her.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of her.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Do not blend in.
[1:51:44] I shouted amen too much this weekend. Do
[1:51:46] not blend in
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; with this age.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; You are in it, but you're not of it.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; There's not a there's not an eighth age
[1:51:54] coming. You're in this age, but you
[1:51:56] don't have to be of this age.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; You don't have to act like this age. You
[1:51:59] don't have to look like this age.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Anybody, anybody can come to the house
[1:52:05] of God under a burden and be
[1:52:07] circumstantial worshipper.
[1:52:13] Well, bless the Lord.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; I sure wish so and so was preaching
[1:52:18] today.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; I do too.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Anybody can do that.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; But it takes a real called out elected
[1:52:28] believer.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; The covenant that Abraham made or God
[1:52:33] made with Abraham, it was unconditional.
[1:52:35] Yes, I think brother Matt mentioned that
[1:52:37] the other night. unconditional covenant
[1:52:39] that God made with Abraham. And that
[1:52:40] means whatever Abraham did, it didn't
[1:52:42] change the way God felt about him.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Right? If Abraham messed up or he
[1:52:46] tripped or he fell, it didn't change the
[1:52:49] way that God felt about him. And I
[1:52:51] wonder tonight if we could get some
[1:52:52] believers in the house of God that will
[1:52:54] be unconditional believers. Will you be
[1:52:57] the other side of that covenant with God
[1:53:00] that no matter what discouragements
[1:53:02] come, no matter what trials come, no
[1:53:04] matter what fiery things the devil puts
[1:53:07] on you, you will praise God anyway. It
[1:53:10] will not change the way that you feel
[1:53:12] about God. He will not change the way
[1:53:14] that you feel about this message. He
[1:53:16] will not change it because it's
[1:53:17] unconditional.
[1:53:19] It's not based on conditions of God. Is
[1:53:21] if the skies are sunny or the skies are
[1:53:23] cloudy. No, this walk is unconditional.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; We serve God no matter what comes, no
[1:53:30] matter what may. The boat might be
[1:53:32] rocking in the ocean, but I'm going to
[1:53:34] serve him anyway.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; I was not called for a flowery bed of
[1:53:38] ease. I was called to a battle.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; And if I was called to battle, it means
[1:53:43] I am ready for war.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; This message has come to resurrect life.
[1:53:53] If you are hearing this message of the
[1:53:55] hour, chances are you've already been
[1:53:57] resurrected.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; You just haven't recognized it yet.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Resurrection power is not coming.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Stop notes. I can't read them anymore.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Lazarus was dead for 4 days.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; And when he came on the scene, he wasn't
[1:54:15] late, but he got there right on time.
[1:54:18] And you think, well, if this revival
[1:54:19] would have come to my home, my children
[1:54:21] might be still be here, or my church
[1:54:23] might still be intact. He's never late,
[1:54:25] but he comes right on time. And he may
[1:54:28] look like he's 4 days late or 5 years
[1:54:30] late, but he comes right on time. And
[1:54:34] when he says, "Lazarus,
[1:54:37] come forth."
[1:54:39] It must obey the authority of the word.
[1:54:44] But that wasn't the end of the story for
[1:54:45] Lazarus. And you've all heard the shout,
[1:54:48] "Come out of her. Be not partakers of
[1:54:51] her." But that's not the end of your
[1:54:53] story.
[1:54:55] Cuz Lazarus was still bound hand and
[1:54:58] foot. There was still a veil over his
[1:55:00] face. But there was another commission
[1:55:02] for him.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; This anointing in this age has been sent
[1:55:09] to loose the bears.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; It has been It has been sent to untie
[1:55:14] the captive.
[1:55:15] [Applause]
[1:55:18] You've been loosed by the message of the
[1:55:20] hour.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; You just need to recognize it. And he
[1:55:24] shook loose the bands on his feet. And
[1:55:26] he shook loose the bands on his arms.
[1:55:28] And he removed the veil as it were over
[1:55:30] his face.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; So he could see the opening of the word.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; He would have still been in the tomb,
[1:55:39] but he had to take the napkin off his
[1:55:41] face that he could behold the glory of
[1:55:43] the Lord. that this word would be open
[1:55:45] to him that he would have a reason to
[1:55:48] rejoice.
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; You've already been resurrected to life.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Now notice this great moving power of
[1:55:57] God comes into a son of God. It quickens
[1:56:00] him. The spirit of life enters into him
[1:56:02] and that's what it does. It seats them
[1:56:04] in heavenly places
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; right now.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Not they will be.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; We are now.
[1:56:16] We've already resurrected the dynamics
[1:56:20] and the mechanics has gone to work,
[1:56:22] quickened us, and we're quickened up
[1:56:24] into the presence of God where his
[1:56:26] spirit is. And now we are seated
[1:56:28] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:56:30] Jesus, sitting in there, the great seat
[1:56:34] that's already fired up,
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; been raised from the dead. We're part of
[1:56:41] it. If you're part of the bride, you are
[1:56:43] because the bridegroom is part of the
[1:56:45] groom. The bride is part of the groom.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; You already been called up to heavenly
[1:56:51] places. So that means I'm in Leodysia,
[1:56:54] but I'm not of Leodysia. I'm walking in
[1:56:56] a Leodysian world in heavenly places in
[1:56:58] Christ Jesus. Because brother said, an
[1:57:00] adopted son has the authority to speak a
[1:57:03] world and go live on it. And I believe
[1:57:05] you've been given the authority where
[1:57:06] you don't have to be subject to the
[1:57:08] spirits of this age, but you can speak a
[1:57:10] word. You can speak a word of a world
[1:57:13] that you can step into and you can live
[1:57:15] in the riches of Christ where you're not
[1:57:17] tossed about by every wind of doctrine,
[1:57:19] but your eye is on the destination.
[1:57:23] [Applause]
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; There has to be a trial, friend.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; And we're in a battle,
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; but there's a reward.
[1:57:37] You can endure the cause of Christ if
[1:57:39] you remember. There's a reward.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; If you can remember, there's a victory
[1:57:43] waiting just over there. And if I could
[1:57:45] just endure one more day,
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; you're already resurrected. You want
[1:57:52] another quote? I'll give you one. And
[1:57:54] now, see, now you are already
[1:57:55] resurrected. When God raised him up, he
[1:57:58] raised you.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; The sun s o n is just now on you. And
[1:58:03] now you're growing into a blossom of
[1:58:05] life like he was to be resurrected
[1:58:07] completely in that last day. The
[1:58:10] potential of resurrection power was
[1:58:12] already in you.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; And because I live, ye shall live also.
[1:58:21] What a resurrection that was. What a
[1:58:23] resurrection this is. This is the
[1:58:25] resurrection of Christ in this age. I
[1:58:27] don't believe it's a sealed tomb, but
[1:58:29] the tomb has been opened. And I believe
[1:58:31] the v victors are marching out because
[1:58:34] they have been called by name.
[1:58:37] [Music]
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; You recognize this message as eagle
[1:58:40] food.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Then you have heard from your theophony.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; A name is a representation or a symbol
[1:58:52] of an entity.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; It means there's something that
[1:58:54] represents that name.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; It means that name is on that lamb's
[1:58:57] book of life, but it actually represents
[1:58:59] an entity. And when you have heard this
[1:59:02] message is eagle food. You have heard
[1:59:04] from your entity. You have heard from an
[1:59:07] eternal entity that has never been lost,
[1:59:09] that has never been defeated, that has
[1:59:11] never tasted a sin. But you had to
[1:59:13] bypass that so that the redeemer could
[1:59:16] express his attributes of redemption in
[1:59:19] your life. That you could sing songs
[1:59:20] that angels will never sing. They will
[1:59:24] never be able to sing. Amazing grace.
[1:59:26] How sweet the sound. An empty place. A
[1:59:30] hopeless case. That was never an angel
[1:59:32] song. But you had to come down and be
[1:59:34] redeemed that you could sing the victory
[1:59:37] song. That you could sing the victory
[1:59:39] march. And that resurrection power has
[1:59:42] come down in this age in your life.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; We are not a dead cold formal church.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; You see, the devil would like us to
[1:59:53] point guns at each other.
[1:59:55] Hope it's okay, brother Window. Are we
[1:59:57] okay?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Like us to point guns at each other in
[2:00:00] this church and this brother in that
[2:00:01] church.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he's trying to stop the true
[2:00:04] move of God.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; And what happens is you correct this
[2:00:07] over here and then you damage this over
[2:00:10] here. So you've got to preach a balance
[2:00:12] down the middle of the road and let the
[2:00:14] word do the correcting. Let the spirit
[2:00:15] do the correcting that we might maintain
[2:00:17] a victory in the house of God that we
[2:00:20] are not ashamed to worship God. Nor are
[2:00:22] we a we are we a dried up old corpse
[2:00:24] over here. But we're right in the middle
[2:00:26] of the road. I believe the devil's
[2:00:28] trying to put it to the believer. You
[2:00:30] got to choose one side or the other. No,
[2:00:32] I'm a middle of the road believer.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; I don't believe the opening of the seals
[2:00:36] took away our worship.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; I believe it opened true worship. I
[2:00:40] believe the opening of the word released
[2:00:42] true worship to us. And I believe it
[2:00:44] would be perfect order with the word.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; I don't believe you have to choose. I
[2:00:49] believe the I believe we ought to
[2:00:50] rejoice in the coming of the son of man
[2:00:52] and we ought to be able to dance about
[2:00:53] it.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to have liberty
[2:00:56] about it. Who else is going to shout
[2:00:58] about it? Who else identifies John in
[2:01:01] Revelations 5 where he shouted because
[2:01:03] the lamb opened the book to him and
[2:01:06] revealed his name was on there. You
[2:01:08] don't have to pick one side or the
[2:01:09] other. Take it down the middle of the
[2:01:11] message.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; You would have to throw away 10,000
[2:01:14] quotes to make that fit. I say we ought
[2:01:17] to believe the message.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; I say we ought to believe it in purity.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; The way that God spoke it. The message
[2:01:24] does not need my idea.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; It doesn't need me to fix it or to
[2:01:28] tinker with it. Just preach the message.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; The message will correct the error.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; I believe we ought to have something to
[2:01:37] shout about. And I believe if the word
[2:01:39] is open to you and the revelation to
[2:01:42] know that you are not a Pentecostal
[2:01:44] leodyian, it ought to give us some room
[2:01:46] to shout.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Oought to give us some room to rejoice.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; The word has been open to you.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Again, I say rejoice.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; I don't believe we should be tied down
[2:02:02] to one side or the other.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Well, this is just me. I hope that's
[2:02:06] okay.
[2:02:09] This is what we've been called to do.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; You have been called here and given the
[2:02:14] power to bind.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; And to loose.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; I don't believe we should have to choose
[2:02:24] whether we're going to be a, you know,
[2:02:26] we're going to be the more reserved
[2:02:28] kind, we're going to be the more
[2:02:29] fanatical kind. I believe we ought to
[2:02:31] just be believers.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; I believe you ought to let God work
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; in the church. That's right.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; It's not a funeral possession.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Neither is it a frolic.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; It's a feast. A feast with Christ. When
[2:02:48] the believers come and dine, the master
[2:02:50] calleth, come and dine. You may feast at
[2:02:52] Jesus table all the time. He that fed
[2:02:55] the multitude turned the water into
[2:02:57] wine. The same Jesus is alive tonight.
[2:03:00] The hungry call him now. Come and die.
[2:03:03] We're not feeding on dead carry and
[2:03:05] brother Sean of a Pentecostal age. We
[2:03:07] are feeding on the body word son of man
[2:03:10] that has come down in this dispensation
[2:03:12] that no other age could put claim to
[2:03:14] until this age.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; It's your meal.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; He's called you to a banqueting table.
[2:03:21] His banner over you is love. The
[2:03:24] capstone of this age is love. And he's
[2:03:26] called you to come eat at this table.
[2:03:28] It's a feast.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; So forgive me if I slobber a little bit.
[2:03:32] I get a little excited. This is a feast
[2:03:34] with Christ. I didn't come to a funeral.
[2:03:37] I came to a feast. I came to dine on the
[2:03:41] master's table. I came to dwell in the
[2:03:44] word.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; You are what you eat. And
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; I don't believe we should be eating some
[2:03:50] idea of a man or some way a man spins it
[2:03:53] down to us. I believe we ought to be
[2:03:54] feasting on the son of man.
[2:04:00] That's what's come down this age. It's
[2:04:02] Christ.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; That's who you're feeding on.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; What good does it do to have a bird if
[2:04:08] he's still in a cage?
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Remember, brother man talks about that
[2:04:13] zoo in Cincinnati. That eagle was
[2:04:14] trapped in that cage.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Did it change what species he was?
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Not at all.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; No, he was still an eagle.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; He was just trapped in a cage.
[2:04:25] What good does it have the ability to
[2:04:27] soar in the heavenlies if you're going
[2:04:28] to stay down here?
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? What good does
[2:04:32] it do to fight the devil on his ground?
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Why would we stay down here in three
[2:04:37] dimensions?
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; When we've been given access to rise
[2:04:43] above whatever the devil can throw at
[2:04:45] us. It's your decision if you want to
[2:04:47] stay down here and fight with the devil.
[2:04:48] But as for me, I've heard a call to come
[2:04:50] up higher.
[2:04:53] Good.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; He says, "What good's your faith going
[2:04:57] to do if you can't turn it loose?"
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; What good is it going to do you if you
[2:05:01] don't use it? We could talk about the
[2:05:02] message.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Sure, we can quote. We can exchange
[2:05:04] scriptures and quotes and you can, you
[2:05:06] know, say, "Well, you missed this quote
[2:05:07] here and you missed that quote there. We
[2:05:09] can exchange that." But what good does
[2:05:10] it do to talk about it?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; What good does it do to play a tape
[2:05:15] every Sunday if you're not going to put
[2:05:18] it into action?
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; I wish I got to pick a tape for them. I'
[2:05:21] I'd say put faith and action in. Let's
[2:05:23] listen to that one. What good does it do
[2:05:25] to sit on your couch? Anyways, I don't
[2:05:26] know what we got here.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to bring it on closer to
[2:05:29] us.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; What good does it do to come into this
[2:05:31] this church every Sunday and on a
[2:05:34] Wednesday night and expect God to come
[2:05:36] down with a supernatural blessing for
[2:05:38] you and you won't pour out anything for
[2:05:39] him?
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; It's simple business mechanics,
[2:05:46] investments.
[2:05:48] You expect God to do something for you,
[2:05:50] but you won't do anything for him.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; And you think your sacrifice isn't worth
[2:05:53] anything because you're unworthy. News
[2:05:55] flash, God knows you're unworthy. He
[2:05:57] knows every mistake you've ever made. He
[2:05:59] knows every trial that you failed. He
[2:06:01] knows every battle that you've lost. But
[2:06:03] yet, he's still seeking.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; God is actively looking for those who
[2:06:11] will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; I say look no further than right here,
[2:06:16] Lord. Yes. Yes, I'm unworthy. Yes, I
[2:06:18] made mistakes. But I will worship you. I
[2:06:22] will worship you ahead of the victory. I
[2:06:24] will worship you ahead of the dance. I
[2:06:26] will worship you ahead of the healing. I
[2:06:28] will worship you before I can see the
[2:06:30] next corner because I will worship you
[2:06:33] in the spirit and in the truth.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Look no further than right here. Where
[2:06:38] is the Welsh revival?
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; There is a worshipper who will worship
[2:06:43] him in spirit and in truth.
[2:06:47] Hallelujah.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; You're preaching fanaticism. Well, maybe
[2:06:51] I am.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; No wonder the mountains jumped and
[2:06:58] shouted on that day. No wonder the sun
[2:07:00] hid its face and screamed for joy. No
[2:07:02] wonder all nature broke loose. The wind
[2:07:04] shook the trees and they shook and joyed
[2:07:06] and jumped. They seen the prophet
[2:07:08] shepherd on the mountain redeem every
[2:07:12] name in the book of life.
[2:07:16] We're not fanatics just cuz we feel like
[2:07:18] it. But I see my name. When I was
[2:07:21] unredeemable, I saw my name. That's why
[2:07:25] I rejoice. That's why I shout cuz my
[2:07:29] name has been revealed.
[2:07:32] That's why the mountains cried. Cuz they
[2:07:34] saw their name. Where were you, Job?
[2:07:38] When I laid the foundations, I was
[2:07:40] there.
[2:07:43] You ever ask yourself why they were
[2:07:45] shouting? Because they saw the plan of
[2:07:47] redemption coming in full view.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be lost for a season, but
[2:07:55] my redeemer's coming for me.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; I was there when they shouted for joy.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; So what are you then? You're a morning
[2:08:05] star,
[2:08:10] sir. No wonder all nature broke loose.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; And they seen that their own nature was
[2:08:17] redeemed.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; They screamed and jumped and the world
[2:08:21] went into an earthquake and the
[2:08:22] mountains ran and the rocks fell out and
[2:08:24] the sun went down and everything taken
[2:08:26] place. Like any meeting when the
[2:08:28] shepherd reveals to you that is
[2:08:31] finished.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching this out of my
[2:08:34] emotion. I have authority to preach this
[2:08:35] by the message of the hour. like any med
[2:08:38] meeting will be when the Lord reveals to
[2:08:41] you,
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; it's finished.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; I've seen jumping spells. I've seen joy
[2:08:46] spells, but there was nobody hurt. The
[2:08:48] mountains rung out and the sun went down
[2:08:50] and everything took place, but there was
[2:08:52] nobody hurt. And I've seen meetings
[2:08:54] where the power of God was revealed to
[2:08:56] the people that they were free from the
[2:08:58] world and the things of the world,
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; and the joy of the Lord filled the
[2:09:04] congregation.
[2:09:06] [Applause]
[2:09:09] They stood and screamed and cried and
[2:09:11] shouted to the top of their voice for
[2:09:13] the glory of the Lord.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; I never did see anything disorderly.
[2:09:18] They was always right in order because
[2:09:21] they had recognized that their name that
[2:09:24] had been written on the lamb's book of
[2:09:26] life before the foundation of the world.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; The great prophet shepherd had brought
[2:09:32] them the message and they were
[2:09:35] delivered.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:38] This is not a message of arguments. This
[2:09:41] is not a message of squables. This is a
[2:09:44] message of deliverance. This is a
[2:09:47] message of freedom. This is a message of
[2:09:50] victory. This is a message of loosing.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Because they had recognized the
[2:09:57] authority of the message. No man has
[2:10:00] ever healed anybody in his life but the
[2:10:02] message Christ.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham never looked into
[2:10:06] anybody's life but the Christ in him.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Come on friends. We don't baptize in the
[2:10:14] name William Brandon. where we baptize
[2:10:16] the name of Paul. There's only one name
[2:10:18] that could bring a message like this. It
[2:10:21] must have been Jesus. Only could it be
[2:10:24] him? It couldn't be anybody else. But it
[2:10:26] had to be Jesus.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; This message is Christ.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; How could we be ashamed of Christ?
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; How could we say, "Well, we just believe
[2:10:35] this, we believe that." No, we believe
[2:10:37] Christ. I believe Christ has descended
[2:10:39] with a shout in this age. And I believe
[2:10:41] he has released an anointing to the
[2:10:43] people of God where we are not supposed
[2:10:45] to look like Leodysian church members.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; But we've heard a shout.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; There's something in the hearing of this
[2:10:54] word.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Hearing
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; produces faith.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing of the word of
[2:11:02] God. And how could they hear less there
[2:11:04] be a preacher?
[2:11:10] There's
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; something in the hearing.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Brother man would tell us earlier in his
[2:11:13] ministry about about the way the deaf
[2:11:16] and dumb spirits work.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; He said that that spirit would attach
[2:11:20] itself
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; around the hearing nerve
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; and it would clamp down on it.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; It would constrict it.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; It would drive out the life from the
[2:11:28] nerve. Right? And as long as that spirit
[2:11:30] was there, there would never be life in
[2:11:33] that nerve.
[2:11:34] Come on.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; But rejoice friends.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Brother said it was like a transparent
[2:11:44] band
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; that came down around that that that
[2:11:47] that hearing nerve, right?
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; And it would clamp down on it and then
[2:11:50] you wouldn't be able to hear.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; And I wonder sometimes if some of us sit
[2:11:56] in service after service and there's
[2:11:58] some spirit clamping down on our
[2:12:00] hearing.
[2:12:06] And if you identify with that, I've got
[2:12:08] a solution for you.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; That's not the end of your story.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; But there's a victory promised in this
[2:12:14] age. That every band will be loosed by
[2:12:17] the preaching of the message and every
[2:12:19] spirit will be subject under your feet.
[2:12:22] You remember I wanted to tell the devil
[2:12:23] what his position is. It's my foottool.
[2:12:26] is underneath my foot because I have
[2:12:29] been given power to tread on serpents
[2:12:31] and snakes and any other demon power in
[2:12:34] this age. And I've also been given the
[2:12:36] power to stand on unbelief and put it
[2:12:39] beneath my feet and say you will not get
[2:12:41] me. But I have been given power over
[2:12:44] you. Before you ever were, I was. And
[2:12:48] when you will cease, I will be. And when
[2:12:51] you take your last breath, I'll just be
[2:12:54] on round 10,000 of Amazing Grace. I'll
[2:12:57] sweep the sound that saved a wretch like
[2:13:00] me and loose the bands over my life.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; This message is lie, friends.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Brother said, he said, "I was a critic
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; other than people dancing and shouting."
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "I didn't have enough victory.
[2:13:23] He said, "I was critical of those people
[2:13:25] because they had the victory."
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Now, why are we rejoicing?
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; There's no music playing right now.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; There ain't no drums beating right now.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; This is stimulation by revelation of
[2:13:38] your of your name revealed on the lamb's
[2:13:41] book of life. and that you cannot lose,
[2:13:44] you cannot be removed, but you will
[2:13:46] always be in his hand, in the right hand
[2:13:49] of his power. In fact, you will always
[2:13:52] be
[2:14:02] going to see you.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; But there's a reward.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; We're doing okay.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; He that has an ear,
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; let him hear what the spirit says to the
[2:14:17] church.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; You got to have your hearing unlocked.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Well, this is just this is just how I'm
[2:14:26] going to live my life. I'm always going
[2:14:27] to be this way. I'm always going to have
[2:14:28] this complex. I'm always going to have
[2:14:30] anxiety. I'm always going to have this
[2:14:32] sugar diabetes. I'm always gonna have
[2:14:33] this fear in my life. I'm always going
[2:14:35] to have crowd anxiety where I can't even
[2:14:37] enjoy a service and I can't even get in
[2:14:38] the glories of God because everybody's
[2:14:40] shouting and it makes me nervous. And
[2:14:42] you think that's the end of your story,
[2:14:43] but that's not the end of your story.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; But there's a solution for you.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; There's an opening of your ears to hear
[2:14:52] what the spirit is saying to the church.
[2:14:54] And the spirit is not saying to stay
[2:14:56] down there in your condition or stay
[2:14:59] down there in your circumstance or in
[2:15:01] your pain. You know, I want to say this
[2:15:02] to the church today. Never let the voice
[2:15:05] of your pain become louder than the
[2:15:07] voice of your worship.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it again. Never let the
[2:15:13] voice of your discouragement become
[2:15:15] louder than the voice of your worship.
[2:15:19] Come on.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Never let the voice of the devil putting
[2:15:24] it on you become louder than the voice
[2:15:26] of your worship. Let the voice of your
[2:15:29] praise be louder than the circumstances
[2:15:32] that you're facing today.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil win that. Don't let
[2:15:37] him steer your truck.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's going to attack you. But you
[2:15:42] have a choice to make. You can go down
[2:15:44] and the woe is me or you can come up and
[2:15:46] the praise my God.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Like what brother Matt said, you may not
[2:15:54] feel it, but can you see it?
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; You going to praise him in advance.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, anybody can praise him after,
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; but it takes a real warrior
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; to praise him in advance of the victory.
[2:16:13] You've got to know. You've got to have a
[2:16:16] relationship that though he slay me, yet
[2:16:19] I'll trust him. Though he put me down,
[2:16:22] yet I'll serve him. Though I don't get
[2:16:24] everything I want and everything I ask
[2:16:26] for, yet I'll give him all my praise.
[2:16:29] Though I don't feel good, though my
[2:16:30] body's aching. Though cancer's riddled
[2:16:33] my body, I'm going to give him praise
[2:16:35] anyway. Because that is the purpose that
[2:16:38] I was sent to this age for. Not to give
[2:16:41] the devil praise, but to give my God
[2:16:44] praise.
[2:16:47] Don't use your voice to praise the wrong
[2:16:49] entity, but recognize that your praise
[2:16:53] is not circumstantial.
[2:16:55] [Applause]
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; And it comes in hard trials.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; You know, the Lord loves it more than
[2:17:03] anything
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; when you can praise him through a trial.
[2:17:07] It's a sweet savior in his nostrils.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; You want to do something for the Lord?
[2:17:12] Praise him in the middle of your
[2:17:13] circumstance.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; He that has an ear. There's a reward for
[2:17:19] overcomers. Press on, lily, if it's in
[2:17:22] you, lay lay aside the mud and
[2:17:24] everything else and press towards the
[2:17:26] top to sit with me on my throne.
[2:17:31] You know, one time the mother of James
[2:17:32] and John, the mother of James and John
[2:17:34] came and asked for this place. You know
[2:17:36] that
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; let my son on the one side and my mother
[2:17:39] said on the other on the other there's
[2:17:40] the mother's desire for her son. But
[2:17:42] watch that place Jesus said was
[2:17:44] predestinated.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe in predestination,
[2:17:47] you're probably uncomfortable. But I
[2:17:49] believe what the prophet taught.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; That place was predestinated. This
[2:17:53] position was not in existence at that
[2:17:56] time.
[2:17:59] But it will be granted to them and who
[2:18:01] it is meant for.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; The one to sit at the right hand and the
[2:18:05] other closest to him was yet an
[2:18:07] overcomer. See, he said, "I don't grant
[2:18:09] this. I can't grant this, but it will be
[2:18:11] given after the trial comes." I can't
[2:18:14] give this, but after the trial comes,
[2:18:16] they'll set on the right hand and on the
[2:18:18] left. There's a predestinated seed
[2:18:20] waiting out yonder for that, and it will
[2:18:22] be given to the ones that it's promised
[2:18:24] to. It will be given there. But the test
[2:18:27] hasn't come yet. He hasn't overcome yet.
[2:18:30] See, the person was to take this place
[2:18:32] on the side and on the other and take it
[2:18:34] on the other side next to him in the
[2:18:35] kingdom. It wasn't yet given.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hadn't overcome.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; The test hadn't fell yet, but it will
[2:18:43] fall in the future.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; You've been positionally placed
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; by the message.
[2:18:56] in the hand of power.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; You take that back to Psalms 110, which
[2:19:00] we read, "Now your enemy is your
[2:19:02] foottool." So the position that she was
[2:19:04] asking for for her sons to have power
[2:19:07] over every spirit could not be given to
[2:19:09] them because it was safe for you.
[2:19:15] [Music]
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wish I could get it out.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; You ever been somewhere and you're
[2:19:20] sitting down, somebody says, "Is anybody
[2:19:21] sitting there?"
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; "No, I got it saved.
[2:19:25] got save for my wife.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; You can't sit there. Oh, there's nobody
[2:19:30] sitting there now. Yeah, but you can't
[2:19:32] sit there.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; It's been reserved.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; It's a saved position.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; That's been reserved for such a time as
[2:19:44] this when the sons and daughters of God
[2:19:47] come into the fullness of adoption.
[2:19:49] That's why I don't understand why you
[2:19:50] would try to run away from adoption.
[2:19:52] It's what gives us authority in this age
[2:19:55] to overcome every spirit of Leodysia. If
[2:19:59] you're going to turn the corner in the
[2:20:00] word, you've got to be under adoption or
[2:20:03] we're just a bunch of Holy Ghost
[2:20:04] shouting Pentecostals. But we have been
[2:20:07] given a message in this age that has
[2:20:10] placed us over the enemy. You are not
[2:20:14] subject to whatever the enemy throws at
[2:20:16] you, but you are an anointed adopted
[2:20:20] joint heir with Christ.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Every right that he has, you also have.
[2:20:28] As I overcame the world, you will also
[2:20:30] overcome the world. And because I live,
[2:20:33] you will also live. Resurrection power
[2:20:37] has come back to the church.
[2:20:40] [Applause]
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got to recognize what
[2:20:43] dispensation and season we're in. We're
[2:20:46] not in the season of Leona and Fodder.
[2:20:49] We are in a bride's revival, in a
[2:20:51] bride's age. You got to rise up to the
[2:20:54] occasion and take flight. And there's
[2:20:56] enough rocket fuel in this message that
[2:20:59] it'll take you so far past the moon.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Mount up with wings, eagles.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; It's time to soar.
[2:21:11] I believe it's time to recognize the age
[2:21:14] and the dispensation that we're living
[2:21:15] in
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; after Jesus. I'm not going to preach to
[2:21:17] you all night. We're going to have a
[2:21:18] prayer line here in a minute.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; And you might think this interesting
[2:21:22] text for a prayer line. Well, I want you
[2:21:24] to approach it different than you've
[2:21:25] ever approached one.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; I want you to approach it with authority
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; to know the ground that you stand on.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; You're not a beggar. You're a son.
[2:21:39] That's right.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; To recognize the season and the
[2:21:42] dispensation that you're in. Jesus comes
[2:21:45] out of the wilderness after being
[2:21:46] tempted by the spirit of unbelief.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; Who are you anyway? If thou be a son, if
[2:21:53] you are a daughter, if you are a real
[2:21:55] believer,
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; after coming down off the mountain, he
[2:21:59] walks right into the synagogue. He opens
[2:22:01] up the scripture and he reads Isaiah 61.
[2:22:07] The spirit of the Lord God is upon me.
[2:22:10] Because the Lord hath anointed me to
[2:22:12] preach good tidings unto the meek. He
[2:22:15] has sent me to bind up the
[2:22:17] brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to
[2:22:20] the captives.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; And the opening of the prison to them
[2:22:25] that are bound
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[2:22:35] Lord. and then closes the book.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; And that's the end of our story.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; No, there's more to the story.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; There's You mean there's another corner
[2:22:48] to turn
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; after God sent a prophet?
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; You mean there's another corner to turn
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost experience?
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; You mean there's another corner to turn?
[2:22:58] There's a deeper water to wait in.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. I'm so glad you asked.
[2:23:02] Thank you for asking.
[2:23:04] Yes, there's another corner to turn.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; And so he identifies this day, this
[2:23:10] scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; to proclaim liberty to the captive. And
[2:23:17] what he did in his first coming, he must
[2:23:19] magnify in his second coming.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; So we see the book closed in his hand.
[2:23:25] But then when we find it again in
[2:23:26] Revelations, it's not a closed book,
[2:23:28] Zachary.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; It's an open book.
[2:23:32] And he he finishes the rest of the verse
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; and he says, "And the day of vengeance
[2:23:38] of our God, to comfort all that mourn,
[2:23:40] to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion,
[2:23:42] to give them beauty for ashes, the oil
[2:23:45] of joy for mourning, the garment of
[2:23:47] praise for the spirit of heaviness, that
[2:23:49] they might be called the trees of
[2:23:51] righteousness, the planting of the Lord,
[2:23:53] that he might be glorified."
[2:24:00] You know what that word vengeance means?
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; It comes from the Latin vindicati, which
[2:24:06] means to be vindicated
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; in the day of his vindication.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; Now, what season are you in? You could
[2:24:17] say, "Well, brother, you're preaching a
[2:24:18] mighty strong position for the bride in
[2:24:20] this age, but I know where I'm getting
[2:24:21] it from.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; I didn't put you there. He put you
[2:24:25] there.
[2:24:26] I couldn't put myself there. He put me
[2:24:28] there
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; in the day of his vindication. This word
[2:24:31] vindication means to free from
[2:24:33] allegation or blame,
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; to confirm.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; To provide justification or defense for,
[2:24:40] to justify, to set free, to deliver, to
[2:24:44] loose.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the day of vindication,
[2:24:49] the church, the bride has been loosed.
[2:24:52] They are not bound down by chains of
[2:24:54] circumstance. They are not bound down by
[2:24:57] chains of what the devil puts on them.
[2:24:59] But you are living in the day of
[2:25:01] vindication when all the bride is loosed
[2:25:05] under the anointing of the hour. You
[2:25:07] have been loosed. And you know what the
[2:25:08] word loose there means? It means a call
[2:25:11] to come higher.
[2:25:13] You've got to take the band off your
[2:25:15] hearing. If you're still in Revelations
[2:25:17] 3, you've got to hear Revelations 4.
[2:25:20] You've got to hear a voice shout to you.
[2:25:23] Come up higher. And I looked and there
[2:25:26] was a door. You could choose to stay on
[2:25:28] the outside or you could choose to walk
[2:25:30] through the door. But I have heard my
[2:25:32] name.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And yes, the enemies of
[2:25:38] Leodysia are all around us. But you
[2:25:40] know, you have been elected to be
[2:25:41] anointed in the presence of your
[2:25:44] enemies.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; You know what it means to be anointed in
[2:25:47] the presence of your enemy? He doesn't
[2:25:48] know a somber thing. It means victory
[2:25:50] struck in the middle of the battle. It
[2:25:52] means that you got a revelation that you
[2:25:54] are victorious through Christ who
[2:25:56] strengthens you in the middle of your
[2:25:58] battle. You know what I like the devil
[2:26:00] to see? I like when he puts it on me and
[2:26:02] he puts the battle high to me. And I
[2:26:05] like to dance right in front of him. I
[2:26:07] like him to know that you will not
[2:26:09] control me. You will not tell me how I
[2:26:11] can worship. You will not dictate to me
[2:26:14] how I serve my God. that I have been
[2:26:16] given authority over you and every
[2:26:20] circumstance of this age. I have been
[2:26:22] anointed in the presence of my enemy.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; I have been anointed
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; in the middle of Leodysia. A call to
[2:26:35] come higher
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; loose from it.
[2:26:46] And it's Acts the 16th chapter. Paul and
[2:26:49] Silas would be going down the road
[2:26:50] performing acts of the apostles. They
[2:26:53] run into a woman possessed with a spirit
[2:26:55] of divination. Right?
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; That's what would get them in prison
[2:26:59] ultimately, right? What did he do?
[2:27:00] Because he took
[2:27:04] he took the money maker out of
[2:27:05] denomination.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; You know what that word Divination means
[2:27:12] in the scripture, you take that to the
[2:27:13] strongest concordance, it means a
[2:27:15] python,
[2:27:18] something that constricts, something
[2:27:20] that chokes the life out of you.
[2:27:23] You know, tonight you've been given
[2:27:24] power
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; to tread on serpents.
[2:27:29] You've been loosed by the message
[2:27:31] anointing in this hour. That there is no
[2:27:34] spirit that can hold you down, no spirit
[2:27:36] that can bind you. But by the liberty of
[2:27:38] the gospel of Jesus Christ, you have
[2:27:40] been given a clear pathway to freedom.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; This is an age for hearing and
[2:27:47] understanding. I was in Mexico last year
[2:27:49] with brother Diego and we had a prayer
[2:27:51] line like we're going to have here in a
[2:27:52] minute and the anointing of God came
[2:27:54] through there and brother Wendle and
[2:27:56] older sister came through there was
[2:27:57] actually the pastor's mother-in-law came
[2:28:00] through there and and and I met her
[2:28:02] before when we were there once and she's
[2:28:04] a she's deaf. She's been deaf since she
[2:28:05] was six years old. She got some kind of
[2:28:07] fever uh when she was a child and it
[2:28:09] actually burst the the the the bones
[2:28:11] that make up the eardrums in your ear
[2:28:13] and there was no way for her to ever
[2:28:15] have hearing. And now here she is 78
[2:28:18] years old
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; and she comes through this prayer line
[2:28:22] and the Lord heals her instantly.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Total miracle heals her instantly.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Sam, I wondered I kind of
[2:28:36] scratched my head. I said, "Lord, why
[2:28:38] would you heal this sister in her 70s?
[2:28:41] She lived her whole life like this and
[2:28:44] now she makes it what might look like
[2:28:45] the end of her of her road and you bring
[2:28:48] healing to her ears. And as clear as I'm
[2:28:50] talking to you right now, brother Ben,
[2:28:51] the Lord spoke to me and said, "There's
[2:28:52] never been a better time to hear the
[2:28:54] message than right now."
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends, there's never
[2:28:59] been a better time to unlock your ears
[2:29:01] than right now. You might have had some
[2:29:04] python preached on you by some false
[2:29:06] anointed preacher that told you that you
[2:29:08] can never rise to the occasion that told
[2:29:10] you that you would never be the the
[2:29:11] pride of Jesus Christ that told you
[2:29:13] you'd always have to live in the slop of
[2:29:15] Leodysa. But there's never been a better
[2:29:18] time to take the binders off your ears
[2:29:21] and hear the liberated word of God that
[2:29:24] has loosed the captive in this age. It's
[2:29:27] not coming. The loosening has already
[2:29:29] come. The victory is not coming. The
[2:29:32] victory has already come. This word has
[2:29:36] loosed the captive. It has broken the
[2:29:38] binds. It has loosed the bands off of
[2:29:42] your life. Now, I believe it's time to
[2:29:44] change our clothes. Even Lazarus had to
[2:29:47] come out of that grave. And you know
[2:29:49] what? They said he stinks because
[2:29:51] religion stinks in God's nostrils. Vain
[2:29:54] worship stinks in God's nostrils. But I
[2:29:57] believe there was another commission. I
[2:29:59] believe he said change his clothes. Take
[2:30:02] off his grave clothes and put on the
[2:30:04] garment of praise. Your destination is
[2:30:07] not the grave. Your destination is
[2:30:10] victory.
[2:30:12] Your destination is not bowing down to
[2:30:14] some sickness or some spirit. Your
[2:30:17] destination is at the right hand of
[2:30:20] power to sit on the throne.
[2:30:24] Hallelujah. I'm preaching some
[2:30:26] overcomers tonight to know they are
[2:30:28] positionally placed in the body of
[2:30:30] Christ that we are risen up with him.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; Let the music players come.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; You have been positionally placed at the
[2:30:42] right hand of power.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; You know what that word, you know what
[2:30:47] it means? A foottool.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; It means something to trample on.
[2:30:57] Hallelujah.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; That means the devil sent his best and
[2:31:00] you know what you did?
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; You trampled on it.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; You've been Did you know he saved that
[2:31:11] spot? That's brother Windle seat. That's
[2:31:13] where he was sitting.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; Saved it for him.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; At the right time, in the right season,
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; you would come to your right position.
[2:31:23] And he's been saving that for you before
[2:31:26] the foundation of the world. Before
[2:31:28] there ever was a devil, before there
[2:31:30] ever was an enemy, before there ever was
[2:31:32] a sickness plague in your body, before
[2:31:34] there was ever a false teacher that ever
[2:31:36] rose on the earth, he was saving a
[2:31:38] perfect spot for you that you might walk
[2:31:40] into the fullness of your position.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; I believe the hour has come.
[2:31:48] I
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; believe the time has come for the bride,
[2:31:51] but I believe the time has also come for
[2:31:52] the devil
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; I believe it's time for the devil to be
[2:31:59] defeated
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; once and for all in your situation
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; because you don't have to deal with what
[2:32:04] the devil gave you.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; I want to proclaim to you by a
[2:32:10] vindicated prophet's words, your future
[2:32:14] is clear.
[2:32:18] The doctors told him, "You'll have those
[2:32:20] parasites your whole life." And the
[2:32:22] devil might have told you, you'll carry
[2:32:23] that your entire life. You'll carry that
[2:32:25] regret and that condemnation, those
[2:32:28] family traits,
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; that family cycle that you're burdened
[2:32:31] under, that unstable mind, you'll carry
[2:32:34] that your whole life. He said he would
[2:32:36] carry parasites his whole life.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; But the Lord came down and told him,
[2:32:40] "Your future,
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you today, bride your
[2:32:45] future's clear.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; He said,
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; just as soon as that anointing said
[2:32:50] that, he said it was like sheets of
[2:32:51] paper with writing on them, just paved
[2:32:53] the way for me. I want you to come down
[2:32:55] and walk in this line in a few minutes
[2:32:57] and I want you to know your future is
[2:32:59] clear. You're walking on paper that's
[2:33:01] already got your name on it. You just
[2:33:03] walk in the line that God has made for
[2:33:05] you and it will level you up. He said it
[2:33:07] leveled him up. And as he walked knowing
[2:33:09] with the confidence that his future was
[2:33:11] clear, that the devil will not win this
[2:33:13] battle because you have already been
[2:33:15] anointed to be king. You have an
[2:33:18] appointment to make
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; and you can't miss it.
[2:33:23] &gt;&gt; You just can't miss it.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; You're not going to miss the rapture.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; You can't miss it.
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; It's you.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; What are these great mysteries? It's
[2:33:34] you. The seventh seal has been opened.
[2:33:37] In you
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; will I ever attain the stature of a
[2:33:41] perfect man. It's the word in you.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; The stature of the fullness of Christ.
[2:33:46] Your future's clear.
[2:33:58] There's nothing I can do to merit this.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; I just need to accept it.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; I just need to accept it.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:34:11] Graham said, "It doesn't take what we
[2:34:13] would think a great thing. It only takes
[2:34:16] a hand that's completely anointed with
[2:34:19] the Holy Ghost,
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; with God's power to strike down any
[2:34:24] enemy
[2:34:25] under any circumstance.
[2:34:30] Tonight, by the word of the Lord, these
[2:34:31] men of God are going to lay their hands
[2:34:32] on you by the same commission that Jesus
[2:34:35] spoke over Lazarus to say, "Loose him
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; and let him go."
[2:34:41] I want you to come to this prayer line
[2:34:42] with authority to know that you have
[2:34:45] been given power over serpents, over
[2:34:49] scorpions,
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; over every demonic power in this age.
[2:34:53] But even more than that, I want you to
[2:34:54] know that your road is clear because
[2:34:56] your name has been revealed in the
[2:34:59] Lamb's book of life and the devil
[2:35:01] doesn't have access to stop you.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What you got, brother Kobe?
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:10] I
[2:35:12] will praise
[2:35:14] the Lord.
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, I
[2:35:21] will praise
[2:35:23] the Lord.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; No battle
[2:35:29] tomorrow.
[2:35:32] [Music]
[2:35:36] I
[2:35:38] will praise
[2:35:40] the Lord.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, I
[2:35:46] will praise
[2:35:48] the Lord.
[2:35:51] [Music]
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; I
[2:35:54] will praise
[2:35:56] the Lord.
[2:36:00] No matter what mar
[2:36:07] [Music]
[2:36:09] I
[2:36:10] will praise.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; And man I believe I believe that one
[2:36:16] time in the scripture there was a
[2:36:17] tormentor that like to torment the
[2:36:19] children of God. He lived his whole life
[2:36:21] that he would torment them.
[2:36:25] I believe that the devil has tormented
[2:36:27] you for years and years and your whole
[2:36:29] life. But I believe you were born for
[2:36:32] such a time as this. That I believe that
[2:36:34] even what the enemy has meant for evil,
[2:36:36] God will work it for your good. And no
[2:36:39] weapon, no gallows built to hang you
[2:36:42] will prosper. No weapon formed against
[2:36:44] you will prosper. But you were born for
[2:36:47] such a time as this. Not a time of
[2:36:49] defeat, but a time of victory. A time of
[2:36:52] healing. A time for deliverance. A time
[2:36:55] for resurrected life. A time to come out
[2:36:57] of dead works and dead traditions. A
[2:37:00] time to come out of just being a
[2:37:01] lukewarm leodyian wishy-washy church
[2:37:04] member. But a time to rise up on eagle's
[2:37:07] wings as a real believer in this age.
[2:37:10] You were born for such a time as this.
[2:37:14] And I believe they have a feast in their
[2:37:16] in their country called the feast of
[2:37:17] Purum. And they write that name of Hmon
[2:37:19] on the bottom of their shoe. And every
[2:37:21] time they think about or mention the
[2:37:23] name of Hmon, they do a little dance.
[2:37:25] Well, I want you tonight to write on the
[2:37:27] bottom of your shoe something that
[2:37:28] you're going to claim here in this
[2:37:30] prayer line. And I want you to recognize
[2:37:32] that you are treading in your position
[2:37:35] over the top. You might be the weakest
[2:37:37] Christian in this building. You might be
[2:37:38] the bottom of the skin of the foot, but
[2:37:41] you are still over the devil. You are
[2:37:43] still in your position. You might be the
[2:37:46] doormat in the house of the Lord, but
[2:37:48] you are still over the greatest
[2:37:50] principalities of the air of this
[2:37:52] demonic kingdom that we live in. You
[2:37:55] have been given dominion rights as an
[2:37:57] adopted child of God to tread on
[2:38:00] serpents.
[2:38:03] I don't know what everyone has need of,
[2:38:04] and I couldn't fix it, but I know a God
[2:38:06] that knows every single individual need
[2:38:08] in this building, and he is more than
[2:38:10] able to supply. So why don't you take
[2:38:13] him at his word tonight and recognize
[2:38:15] you've been anointed for such a time as
[2:38:17] this that you might overthrow the
[2:38:19] devil's kingdom in your life and say
[2:38:22] devil you've had your way with me all
[2:38:24] these years all these times through this
[2:38:26] whole trial but tonight
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; tonight I am rising up to my position
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; my future's clear devil your future has
[2:38:38] a certain end you will die in the lake
[2:38:40] of fire you will cease to torment people
[2:38:43] and my future is clear to walk in into
[2:38:46] the kingdom of God where I can hear the
[2:38:48] words, "Well done, my good and faithful
[2:38:50] servant. Enter into your reward."
[2:38:52] There's a position that I have made for
[2:38:54] you. I have prepared it for you. Enter
[2:38:57] into your blessing tonight.
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; Why don't you enter into your
[2:39:01] Hallelujah?
[2:39:03] Oh, I
[2:39:06] will praise
[2:39:08] the Lord.
[2:39:11] No, no matter what tomorrow brings,
[2:39:17] what it has store,
[2:39:20] I
[2:39:22] will praise the Lord.
[2:39:26] Oh,
[2:39:28] I
[2:39:30] will praise
[2:39:31] the Lord.
[2:39:34] I love you, Jesus. I
[2:39:37] will praise
[2:39:39] the Lord.
[2:39:41] Hallelujah.
[2:39:43] [Music]

[2:39:49] line,
