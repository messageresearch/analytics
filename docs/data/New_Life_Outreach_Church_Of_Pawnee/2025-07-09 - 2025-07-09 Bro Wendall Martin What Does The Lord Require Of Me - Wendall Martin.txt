As I look back down the pathway up the mountain, I'd have tried weary warm and feed a little sore. Thought by now I'd be much further up the road than where I am. I've cast aside some weight. I must do so much more. There's no time to waste my fleeting precious time. Besetting wait with haste. I will swiftly cast aside. &gt;&gt; No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost home. [Music] Oft [Music] gaze across the valley of decision where I was and thank the Lord he led me from that place. The heights I've gained are greater than were all my yesterdays. But I must press on to see my Savior's face. There's no time to waste my fleeting precious time. Setting weight with haste. I will swiftly cast aside. No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost home. [Music] When I reach those gates of glory, only then will I take rest. But the first thing I will do when I get home. I'll crawl up to my Jesus and I'll weep down at his feet. My source of joy, the savior of my soul. Oh, there's no time to waste. My fleeting precious time setting away with haste. I will swiftly cast aside. No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on. I can hardly wait. I'm almost home. Oh, there's no time to waste my fleeting precious time. &gt;&gt; He's setting way with haze. I will swiftly cast aside. &gt;&gt; No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost home. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost home. [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's stand to our feet. Amen.

Well, it's good to be here this morning in the house of the Lord and uh good to see all of our of our visitors. Amen. The whole Curtis clan. Amen. Hallelujah. Good to have have you all here with us today. And uh Amen. Don't y'all just love Brother Steve's that thing? I know what it's called. Dorbro. Amen. Drob bro. Amen.

And so just wonderful. Well, brother Merl has already went through all of our visitors here, so I'm not going to go through all that again, but it is good to see everyone that is here today. And uh while you're standing, we'd like to look here in the book of uh Micah, the sixth chapter. And uh and I tell you what, I still don't have any any monitors on my on my ear. I had the Doro real good and loud, but no. Uh I &gt;&gt; No, no, that's good. I enjoyed it. I had my own concert. Amen. And uh uh so I I don't know. A Oh, it may be coming in. Did you? Hallelujah. There. where I'm getting a little bit. Amen. Just a tad more would be awesome. Amen. All right. Uh Micah 6 and6 says, "There wherewith shall I come before the Lord and bow myself before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams and with 10 thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He hath shown thee, oh man, what is good. What do the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God? I want to minister this morning, what does the Lord require of me? Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful for your many blessings and the anointing that we feel here this morning. And Lord, we count it a privilege to be able to come and to lift up our voices in our hands and sing praises to you and give love to you, Father. And Lord, we it means so much to every one of us to know that you are here. And Lord Jesus, as we quieten our spirits now and and settle down for you to speak to us, we ask Lord that you would speak directly to every one of our hearts. Lord, that you would meet every need that is present. Father, we're so thankful for all that you are and all that you will always be. And Lord, we give ourselves to you just now. If there be any that is sickly and or not feeling well this morning, I pray that you'll help them and strengthen them and heal them, Father. And we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be seated here this morning. We as I was thinking throughout the week um these last well several weeks I've I think the the last Sunday we we ministered on a full surrender to God's call and we Wednesday night I ministered on desperation desperation for the living God the God of the Bible And then today I my my thought is what does God require of me? We don't know exactly when the Lord is coming but each of us have gifts and callings in our lives. We we are amen uh we have been placed here on the earth by predestination. God had a purpose for you being here. You're not here by accident. Amen. The Bible says before your members were even formed, your your body was even formed, every member was already written in his book of remembrance. &gt;&gt; So he knows that you were to be here. He's ordained for you to be here. &gt;&gt; He brought your grandma and grandpa together, your mama and your daddy. He brought all he he worked this whole thing to bring you here today because God's got a purpose for you in this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Each of us have been given gifts. This the the the I'm not the only one with a gift here this morning. The musicians are not the only one with with gifts. We've all got gifts and and we all amen are duty bound to surrender our gifts unto the Lord. And I will say that we will even be held accountable for those gifts that God has given us. Last week we talked about the rich young ruler and amen that couldn't quite amen heed the master's call because of his riches when he had come and asked Jesus what what can I do to inherit eternal life and he said amen well and he keep the commandments and he went through these things and he says I've done this from my youth amen I I've kept the commandments but then he he said there's one thing that you lack back. Amen. You you you've put your stock on your riches and he says, "Go sell all that you've got and follow me." Well, amen. When when when Jesus asked of that, he was very sad. And he turned around, Amen. and walked away. We find that later on in in Luke the 12th chapter that that this rich young ruler become more wealthy. He tore down old barns and built bigger ones. And but there come a time that God said, "Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee." And then Jesus would sum it up and he would say, "Amen." So he that layeth up treasure for himself is not rich toward God. So So you can have everything put together in this natural world. You can be a banker. You can be a a electrical contractor. You can be a Amen. You you can have a lot of things put together. But if we have not fulfilled the purpose, Amen. that which God desires of us to be, Amen. then then it profits us nothing. And Jesus would go on to say, Amen. After this parable, he says, "Take no thought of what you will wear or eat or drink. For your father in heaven cares um takes care of the lily and the sparrow, and he'll take care of you." Can I hear an amen? Jesus would sum it up, amen, at the end of this chapter. And he would say, "But rather seek ye the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all of these other things will be added unto you." And then he says there in that 32nd verse, he says, "Fear not, little flock. It is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." It's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Now he is going through this. This man who lost it all. Amen. Because he failed to surrender everything to God. Amen. And now his soul is required of him. And then he turns to the elect, those who seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. And he says, "I will be a god to you. I will be one that clothe you and feeds you. Well, praise the name of the Lord. Amen. When he says it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom, that word kingdom is is is royalty. It's kingship. It's dominion. It means rule. Amen. Not to be confused with an actual kingdom, but rather the right or the authority to rule in God's kingdom. So God's desire, Amen. God's purpose for calling each of us is to rule and reign in the kingdom of God. Many people think the kingdom of God is when we get on the other side. But the kingdom of God is in you through the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Every one of you who has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, Amen, that is the power or the spirit of God within you. and he has deputized you, amen, to rule and reign in the kingdom of God. Well, praise the Lord. There's no beggars in the kingdom of God. Amen. There's no there's no wannabes in the kingdom of God. When you surrender everything to the kingdom of God, when you surrender your life to Christ, you come under the headship of that word. Amen. You have just taken on an authority through his spirit. Hallelujah. Can you say amen? It's the father's good pleasure. In other words, amen. It's the delight. It's the deep and earnest sincere desire. It's my joy. It's my heartbeat. It's my it's it's my very pleasure to give you the kingdom. Oh, glory to God. Amen. To give you the authority, the right to reign. Amen. I've called you for this purpose. I've ordained you to cast out devils, lay hands upon the sick. I've called you, Amen, to further my kingdom. That's that's what I have called you for. I've not called you just to raise families. I've not called you just to work on jobs. I've not called you uh uh just to Amen. go through this natural life. But I have called you, placed you, ordained you to further my kingdom. What does the Lord require of me? I think kingdom being kingdom- minded is better than things. Amen. Which would be best, things or the kingdom? You can have things and not have kingdom. But you cannot have the kingdom without the provisions provided while in the king's presence and the king's service. Can you say amen? Jesus would also say, "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also your treasure." Amen. Your treasure, your your your valuables, those precious things that you hold dear to your heart. Many today are so material oriented and they forgot their call. I I know many preachers mind because they because being a a preacher is can can be it's not it's not as uh glamorous as what uh the church world has tried to make it to be and they'll they'll become a they'll become a you know car salesman or they'll they'll get into business and amen because of the gift that they have in their lives and they can succeed but yet that and yet not fulfill their purpose. &gt;&gt; But you see, God's not wanting us to be material oriented. There's many there there's many listen when preachers surrender their gift to the carnal things of the world, then the then the church or the world is going to suffer because of it. When the church, amen, surrenders their lives to the carnal things of the world, then the world that the the kingdom of God will suffer because of it because God has placed gifts and callings within each of our lives. Amen. What is our purpose? Well, first of all, the purpose, amen, that Jesus came was for redemption. Amen. To go back where we came from. Can you say amen? So what is my purpose? My my purpose should be oozing redemption. Jesus gave his life. He sacrificed everything so that he could bring his sons and daughters back to their position. And I think the church should be kingdom- minded. Amen. Kingdom minded is God. Your purpose is my purpose. Your desire is my desire. Well, praise the name of the Lord. Amen. I am an ambassador and I represent the kingdom. Amen. That I have come from and bring as many in. Can you say amen? In consideration of this final age, we understand that the two seeds have come into the climax. Jesus gave us the parable of the two seeds that would be sown into the world. Amen. The good seed was sown in by the son of man. Amen. Jesus would later on say that was the word that he sown into the world. And then the bad. Amen. Here come the evil one, Satan. Amen. Coming in and sewing his seeds. And then we've we have seen that it has come. The two seeds have been growing. They've been maturing. But we know that we there must come a harvest time. And we are at the rapturing of the church. This will be this. Bible says that he's going to gather all the tears up, gather them for burning. And then he's also going to gather the wheat, you and me, into his great garner. He's going to take us home in the rapture. I think it's something to be rejoicing about. I I I think. Can you say amen? We are in this final age. These two seeds have come into maturity. The Antichrist church and the bride. We're we're we're here at the climax. And I want to say there is not a greater time than the time that you are living in right now to serve God and give him your everything. &gt;&gt; What would the Lord require of me? With the mysteries being unveiled and the symbols interpreted, the open book is available to the sons of God. Surely there are responsibilities that would come with it. Amen. Now, the opening of the seals is not a new form of legalism, earning God's acceptance. God's not interested in what? Amen. In in in legalism, God is interested in a surrendered heart unto him in this hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Think about the day that we're living in. The preciseness and the accuracy of prophecy. And here we stand with the word of God being being uh uh uh interpreted right before our eyes by manifestation. Look at Israel. Look at Russia. Look at these things in the scripture where we're standing right at we are at the the the cusp of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are at we are at the the the brink of of of leaving this world into that immortal world. It's something that we have preached about. It's something we have sung about. It is something we have dreamed about. It is something that we have longed for. And we are there on the cusp of entering in to that land of eternal life. &gt;&gt; We're there at that place. Can you say amen? Amen. I What what is God requiring of me today? Amen. What would God require as we as we read there in in in in there in Micah where where he's asking would would he be pleased with burnt offerings and thousands of rams or 10 thousands of rivers of oil. And he says, "Oh, what does the Lord require of thee?" Amen. But to do justly and to love mercy and to walk in humility before your God. Amen. In other words, amen, the requirement that God is asking is all of you. Amen. He is asking you to surrender everything you've got so that he can finish his purpose that he has placed you here on this earth for. Oh, now listen. Don't let that leave you here today. Amen. I I dare say that we've got some preachers that are sitting in here that has never preached a sermon. I dare say that there are gifts in this church right now that the that God has placed you here for. Amen. That is still got to come to its fusion. And it's still going to require just as every prophet of old. It still requires every one of us to say, "Amen, woe is me. I am a man of unclean lips." But God, if you will sanctify me and if you will give me, then I will go for your kingdom. &gt;&gt; A surrendered life. It was a surrender there in as Isaiah. Amen. He the great prophet Isaiah when he was a young man, he had amen sort of taken he was taken under the wing by by the king of Judah Uzziah. And Uzziah loved him. And amen Isaiah was a good man. And he stayed in the palace with the king. And but one time, amen, there come a time where Uzziah uh he he he got lifted up in his heart and and and uh had sinned against God, done the things of the priest and and and he was struck with leprosy and and and Uzziah died. And now here is Isaiah who had looked to this great man, this great king of great wealth and character and status. And he's looking at him and he's gone. And the Bible says that Isaiah walked into the temple. And when he walked into the temple, he said the glory of the Lord came down inside the temple. And he saw the glory of the Lord fill the whole place. And and as he as he was there in the presence of God, amen, the seraraphims were there. And he talks about the glory of the Lord. But there was the question that was asked, who will the Lord send? Who will the Lord anoint? Amen. Isaiah in the presence of of this great God. He says, "I and my people are are are people of unclean lips. I come from sin. I there's nothing that I can offer." Hallelujah. I I cannot go. But then the Bible says one of the saraphims took the coal from off the altar and he took the coal and he touched his lips. Amen. And says, "You are now cleansed." And what was the next thing that Isaiah would say? Isaiah would stand and say, "Lo, here am I. Send me. Here am I." You see the difference was he he he he he had seen the fickleness of man. He had seen the great king fall. He knew in himself that he was not great at all. But when God comes in and gives a call that it is required of a man to answer that call and say, "Lo, send me." &gt;&gt; Now not all of us are preachers. Not all of us can evangelize the world. Not all of us can play a music musical instrument. But yet, God has called every one of you for a divine purpose. You say, "Well, I'm too poor. I'm too old." Amen. I I don't have enough of an education. All God is looking for is not what you can present. He don't want your education. He doesn't want your wealth. He doesn't want what you He wants a surrendered heart, &gt;&gt; a surrendered life to him that he can use for his glory. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. What is God looking for? Amen. He's looking for that humility. The prophet would say, "Brother, if you amount to anything, you've got to love God better than your wife, than your husband, better than your children, better than your pastor." Yeah. Anything that there is, you've got to love God first. God gets the first place. Can you say amen? But we give him about the 10th place, but he deserves the best we've got. Can you say amen? Now, I know this is a different message here this morning and and and I I I I as I have labored in the spirit over these this last week and asking God what he would want us to say, it it seems like my heart has has has been has has been uh uh uh uh just wounding up within me because I I I want God to be pleased with me. I want God to be pleased with our church. I want to be that that God has ordained me to be. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, the carnal intellectual church will unwittingly become totally sold out to the antichrist. Now, we know that there in the book of Revelations, amen, that the whole world is going to follow after that that council of churches. They're going to follow after that beast system. Amen. It is all through the book of Revelations. It has plainly been declared and we see it coming to pass. Rome is beginning to take her place again. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that these things are there. Amen. And the church because she has just been on cruise control, has just sort of gulped everything in that that that is that's not even in scripture. Amen. Gulped it all in as if it's of God. But I want to tell you little bride, God's put you here for a purpose. And if you'll surrender everything that you've got, the book of Acts will come to living. Amen. Kodak h a living color right here in Lelaya if he can find some surrendered hearts. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. The church world is taking on that spirit and amen. And she'll give birth. The scripture says there in there in 2 Thessalonians 2. Amen. That there will come a time where the man of sin will stand up. Amen. And and and they will he will take dominion or he'll Amen. He'll stand up in the place of Christ. But brother, there is a church that is going to walk with God. Hallelujah. Someone asked me the other day, can we still expect miracles and healings? I said, "Brother, the church should better be living in miracles and healings." &gt;&gt; You You say, "Well, Brother Wendle, we don't seek after signs." We do not seek after signs. It's the signs that are supposed to follow the believer, not the believer following the signs. You get somebody that is believing the word of God, then you're going to see the supernatural that'll come in and manifest itself. Well, can you say amen? Amen. just recently uh uh there with her wi-i with with with with our our sister Denise. Amen. There she had and and we you know with her uh uh her uh um uh pancreas and the pancreatitis and Amen. They were giving her the enzymes and and and and you know how sickly that she's been and how that it's been just so so rough on her. Amen. And having to give her the shots. But you see, when the anointing come down during that service, she was not even she didn't have someone lay the hands upon her, she was in the back holding a baby so someone else could go through the prayer line. Amen. She come talking to me and she says, "Now, Brother Win, I know you're probably upset with me, amen, for not going in through that prayer line, but I I I I just felt that I needed to hold this baby." But she said, "I want you to know that I felt the presence of God in the back right there where I was at." Amen. She went back to the doctor for her shots. And the doctor says her pancreas is now working perfectly. It's been working perfectly since, amen, the beginning of March. So, it's not what we have. It's not what we can give him in the natural. It's a surrender of heart to his call upon us. &gt;&gt; Many of times we say, "I don't know if I can do it." Amen. Well, the church world, Amen, the world out there is surrendering their lives to to to Satan's purpose. Why can't the church, why can't the bride surrender her life? Well, praise the Lord. Amen. The prophet would say, "Notice, just a minute, a nun in a Catholic church. That woman to to become a nun, she takes the last veil. She's absolutely sold out to that church. She is soul, body, and spirit property of that church. She has no mind of her own. She she can't have when she takes that last veil. No mind of her own. No will of her own." See out there, Satan makes them his bogus. Amen. Like the true. Amen. Somebody says, "But the true church of Christ, the bride is so sold out to him and his promised word till the very mind that's in Christ is now in you." What a what a difference. Amen. We find the modern church, a modern church world. Amen. I it it all also there is that church modern church but there is also that spiritual church that are pregnantated to give birth to sons. Amen. I just as the natural church is set in order to give amen to that antichrist and that antichrist will rule the world and believe me amen that anointing is upon the earth right now. Amen. Trump might think that he can he can fix all the world's problem, but the antichrist is going to come and he is going to be like a superman for the church and for the world. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But the bride of Jesus Christ is to give birth unto the word. We're going to give birth to Jesus Christ. Amen. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. The word was made flesh and dwelt among us. The church, what are we doing? Amen. We're groaning and we're earnestly contending. We're saying, "God, Amen. Your word has promised. Your word has promised healing. Your word has promised deliverance. Your word has promised, Amen, victory for my family. Your word has promised a a salvation for my children." What are you doing? You are taking God back to his word. You are standing there and saying, "God, I believe your word is true. I believe what you said. I know your word can come to pass." And you're you're you are giving birth to word promises all around you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, I'm not talking about the natural birthing. I'm talking about the spiritual bride. being impregnated with the word, being impregnated with the promises. I believe what God says. I believe his word is true. I believe everything. And what are you doing? You are accepting the supernatural seed into your life. And you are confessing that word and it must come to pass. It's just as much of a b a virgin birth as as Mary producing Jesus. It's the accepting of the seeds and believing the words of promises to come to pass. Now you say this is really strange. I'm asking what does the Lord require of me? You see, while the church world has sold their birthright for scientific leadership as and and and and and she's caused the whole world to accept this scientific uh leadership of the educational programs that Satan had given to her. The church like Eve ha has was offered God's word. But what did she do with it? Instead of tearing for the baptism of the Holy Ghost, now she comes and shakes the preacher's hand. Well, praise the Lord. She has let her scient science proved to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples. Instead of continuing on with divine healing, we've we've made our excuses and amended Satan by the leadership of religious man to take the word of God and to try to say it was for another age. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. But there is a bride who is standing there and saying, "I am not here just to be here. I have been called with divine purpose. I have a divine order. God has given me a supernatural birth." Amen. I have an authority that is greater than the job I'm sending or working at, greater than my position that I hold in the community. I've got a position in Christ Jesus. And I'm going to take that responsibility seriously before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Hallelujah. What does the Lord require of me? What has he called me for? Well, if we're to be his bride, we're to be his body. We're to continue on his works. You see, this is where the total surrender. You say, "Well, I don't see any of that anymore." Why don't we see it anymore? Is because there's not enough surrender. &gt;&gt; I was 16 years old when I was seeing miracles in my in my little ministry. Ronnie and Linda back there and Sister Carol. I don't see Sister Carol this morning. Oh, she's in she's in Denver. Amen. But but but y'all remember I was 19 years old when I come to Pawne. Stupid as all get out. Just as ignorant as a as a rock. Hallelujah. Amen. But there's one thing that I did. I wanted to do something for the Lord. And I didn't mind yielding myself to the Lord to do that. I didn't know what I was doing. But you see what God is looking for here this morning. God will give you what it takes. But he's looking for someone to surrender everything to him. Amen. There's got to be a total surrender. There's got to be somebody that is willing. &gt;&gt; You take brother Joshua. Amen. Out evangelizing. Evangelizing isn't isn't is is is far from glamorous. He and he and Loretta going from church to church throughout the week, going from motel to motel, living out of a suitcase for months at a time. Amen. And and getting offerings that that that many times they they can't even make it through the to to the next place hardly with the offering that they've got. But yet it is somebody who has surrendered. They've had them out Calvary. They had a place where they had to die to themselves and say, "Lord, not my will but thy will be done." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's not a glamorous job. I look there at, you know, Caleb's house and how beautiful his is becoming. and well, I just don't work on mine. But I look at Josh's and and and and what he started and how quickly that's coming along. Hallelujah. You see, you you look at these things, you can't have both worlds, you've got to surrender. And whatever you give your life to, then you give your life to it. &gt;&gt; When you surrender your life to God, it's not God plus me. It is God. You give everything you've got to God and then let him take care of the rest. Can I hear an amen? God wants all of us. Many a times a sinner will come in. It used to be that people would come to an altar and they would weep and cry because of their sins and the burdens and they would ask and beg God to give and forgive them and want deliverance from their habits and sins and they man the wrongs they've done. But today it seems that it seems that surrender is hard for us all. It's hard for the sinner. It's hard for those that are the believer that's in the church. But I'm here to tell you there is a place there is amen a a a a resting place in God. And that's what I'm preaching here this morning is God don't let me be satisfied with the status quo. Don't let me just come to church and sit here. But God, I want you to look at me. I I want you to say, "When will you go?" And I want to have a heart saying, "Yes, I will go. Send me." &gt;&gt; God's still the deliverer. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; He's still the baptizer. He still speaks in tongues. He still prophesies. He still works miracles. When it was asked of me, a preacher asked me of of a of one of our leading preachers in our in in you know a very well-known preacher said, "Brother Wendle, why why don't we see a lot of things?" And I said, "It's quite simple. When we were poor, we were able to surrender. &gt;&gt; But now when we have money and we then we have a little bit of prestige, we're not as desperate as we once were. We're not crying. Well, I'm preaching better than your amening this morning. We're not crying out and asking God for his mercy and for his help because we've got all the doctors and we've got all the money and we've got everything. Oh yes, even the poorest of us have nice things. But God is looking for somebody that he can take his hand and put upon. I don't know. I don't know which one of these boys, Amen, would would be a who's going to be the preachers or who's going to be the next song leaders or who's going to be the next deacons. But I guarantee you this one thing here. If the Lord should terry, it's going to be young men like you, Connor. That's got to surrender your life to God. It's got to be young men like you, Dylan. It's got to be young ladies that's got to surrender their lives to God. Everything they have. &gt;&gt; Mistakes are going to be there. Failures are going to happen. Getting it right all the time is for the other world. There's going to be a lot of mistakes. There's going to be a lot of failures. There's going to have to be a lot of times where we come back to an altar and say, "The Lord Jesus, forgive me. Put me back in service again." Hallelujah. Can you say amen? You see, there's going to be those times of of But but you see, the sinner isn't desperate like it should be. the the the cry the cry for more of God, the cry like it should be. But I'm here to tell you, God's got a bride who's going to make it her business to follow him. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Is this okay this morning? &gt;&gt; See, his word has to live itself out for every generation. Amen. Now, two churches. There's always been twins. There was Abel and Cain. Amen. There was There was Jacob and Esau. You could go down through the scripture. There was Isaac and Ishmael. There was Jesus and Judas. Every time God wants to do something, Satan will come up. And every one of these, whether it be Cain, Ishmael, they were all religious. &gt;&gt; Judas was very religious. He cast out devils. &gt;&gt; So, you can't look at the church natural and say, "This is all God's doing." We've got to look at the church spiritual &gt;&gt; and we got to say, I'm going to surrender everything I've got to this word. &gt;&gt; What does the Lord require of me? Well, all he wants is you. &gt;&gt; Well, if I come and I I maybe if I fill up the church, that's that's good. But he wants you. Well, I I I I'll bring a whole bunch of money and put it in the in the coffers. Well, that's good. But he wants you. He wants to walk with you and talk with you and Well, praise the Lord. Am I making sense here this morning? &gt;&gt; He wants that word to be so living within us that he becomes our everything as we have become his everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, one of the churches a denominational birth and it's going to give one of these days to that world council of churches which will produce to the world the antichrist. Amen. Through denominationalism. That's the truth. Amen. It's going to be there. But the other is pregnant by the word of God and will bring forth the body, the finished body of Jesus Christ, which is his bride. The body of Christ alone isn't enough isn't finished yet. H how many knows that a man or a woman, a man is and and a woman is one. Christ is one body the word and the bride will have to be the rest of that body. The two together makes one body again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife or one. how she, the true bride, is so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own. But it's his mind. Of course, it's his will. And his will is his word. Can you say amen? The word in action, living the Bible. That's the Bible pride today. We stand alone like the bridegroom, rejected and despised. Amen. But the bride stands that way knowing that Christ is her everything. When I look at the world and I look at my my calling, as we talk just a little bit more about the callings that God has given us, I can't look at my ability to write songs or to play music or to pastor a church. Those are gifts that God gave me. Those are things that but what he wants of me is me. Cuz I can sing and it not be from here. I can preach and it not be from here. I can give money and not be from here. &gt;&gt; So when God gives you these gifts and talents and yet just remember Amen. The scripture says that there were the there were the the the talents that were given as the man was going to go on a long journey. And so he gives five talents to one and he gives three to another and and and and one to another. And the one with the five, he when he when the goodman came back, he he gave the he had gave him his five back and also gave him the interest of the other five. And then he those I believe he was either two or three and and then he had multiplied that and but the one that didn't have much. He didn't have he was only given one talent. The other guys were given a whole bunch and he was only given one. And the Bible says that he buried that talent in the dirt. &gt;&gt; Well, I mean I'm not like I'm not the preacher and I'm not the song leader and I'm not Amen. All I got is my little talent and I you know and so I just ah who cares. Apparently the one who gave the talent cared because when he found that he just presented to him the single talent that he had originally given him. He says why did you hide that talent? You should have at least taken it to the useries. Well, praise the Lord. Boy, this is the quietest group I've preached to in a long time. &gt;&gt; You You You knew that I was wrathful. You knew that I sold places that didn't belong. I You know the kind of man that I am. You didn't put that gift to work. You hid that in your dirt. &gt;&gt; You went and the Bible says he hid it in the dirt. And I think there's there's Hallelujah. I don't want to stand before the Lord. Amen. And I've got I've got I've got my gifts hiding in this dirt. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I want to give it to the Lord. Chances are I won't need it on the other side, but I do need it now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There are souls to be saved. Now, when I heard the other day about the uh sister Brianna talking about her work uh worker there, the guy had cancer. Gower guy. Yeah. Her brother-in-law. Yeah. Mother-in-law. And and and still young. Still still young. and cancer's got it. And I I look at my dad with this Parkinson's and he wants to be here this morning, but he can't. Just just so weak. You got you got you you you hear these things. Uh uh uh you know, we just heard that that that that Sister Denise has now got a uh she she's got cancer there in her uterus. And and and we hear these things. What should it do to us as the bride? because our commission has been to cast out devils, lay hands on the sick. Do do you understand how that God has placed you here in his face? You see, when the sun is is gone and and and it is set, then it's time for the moon to rule in its place. And Christ, the son of God, the God of all glory, amen, has has went on to heaven uh uh before us. But the bride is the moon. We are standing here to hold back the tide. &gt;&gt; That moon has a responsibility to hold back that tide. &gt;&gt; If that moon gets out of place, this whole earth would be covered with water. &gt;&gt; Those stars, they stand in place. They're God's army. What about you as the living church of the living God? &gt;&gt; Pentecost. We shot all of our steam out the whistle. I remember. I remembers those times. We ran around here. Not here at the old building. Run around. We Hallelujah. I could tell you all kinds of stories. Amen. Having a wonderful time. But God didn't send his power for us to have a wonderful time. You don't want to blow all the steam out your whistle. You want to blow that steam is to put the train down the road &gt;&gt; or down the tracks. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. We're thankful for all all of the wonderful zach, but I'm here to tell you there is a powerful church here, &gt;&gt; but God wants I praise the Lord. You can have water over here on this part of the country. Maybe there's a hundred acres over here and it's and it's got it's got water in it and it's got a nice beautiful stream. And then you got a 100 acres sitting next to it and it's burning up because it's not had no rain. And this guy over here is wondering what what am I going to do about it? I I wish I wish I had the blessings over there. All you have to do is do things according to God's law and find a way to get that stream over there in your part of the country. All you have to do is to divert get over get some water over there in your Are y'all hearing me? All we have to do is say, "God, let me yield myself." God still saves souls. God still saves children. God still heals the sick. God still do does these things. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; A surrender. That surrender that I've been talking about, Lord, what would you require of me? You see, owning up to those responsibilities, he says, when you see then in this day now, when the word of God has made these promises and things that we see happening, then we've got the responsibility to either face up to it or get away from it. You can't stay neutral. You've got to do something about it. Some move has got to be made. You can't come in the church door and go out the same person you came in. you either further away or closer to God. Can you say amen? God can only use what we give him. &gt;&gt; Now, as we as I begin to as I begin to wind my thoughts down here this morning, oh God, I've been having I've been I don't know. Something's been happening these last three or four weeks in my heart. There's been like a really a renewing or a a real nudging. Wendell, are you giving me everything? Are you are you putting it all on the line? Are you leaving it all on the line? Are you holding a reserve? And I've been looking in the mirror of God's word and I said, 'Well, I don't miss church. I try to be faithful uh to to my preaching. I try to. But then the the answer comes back, but are you doing all the Lord is requiring of thee? And I I say, well, what else could I do? And the question comes back, are you giving me your everything? I can't bring the full potential out until you give me everything. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm I'm a singer. Well, I'm a preacher. Well, I'm a this. Well, I'm a that. Amen. God wants everything. Can you say amen to that? Now, now there's a lot that will say, "Well, 15 minutes on a Sunday morning, you know, and if the preacher goes in, he preaches any longer than that. I'll just get up and go home." That's all they can handle. Some says, "Well, I can do a little bit more than that. I'll do I'll I I I'll do an hour." Amen. Well, that's good. But what can you give? God will receive whatever you'll give him. That's just that's just a fact. God will receive whatever you want to give him. But he wants every bit of us. He wants our all. He wants your life. He wants your testimony. He wants every minute you live. He wants He wants every action. He wants everything you are. Amen. Oh, can you say amen? He wants everything. Somebody say everything &gt;&gt; perfectly surrendered to him so he can lead you and guide you and put you in places where he wants you to go. led of the spirit. &gt;&gt; I say to you young men and young women, boys and girls, there's never a better time than to serve God where you are. Don't sit on a pew and dry and die and and then go outside and when you get older and and go and live for the devil. Why not find Christ right now and right here where you are and surrender your talents and your gifts to the Lord right now where you are and serve him with everything you've got right now where you are. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I remember going but as a kid to the nursing homes. Now all I had was me and my bike and my guitar and my little brother's wagon. Amen. And uh so I'd take Jonathan's wagon, hook it up to my bike, and I'd grab my guitar and I' I'd be going out singing. uh go to the funerals or uh uh nursing homes and and uh not funeral homes, nursing homes and and sing and and testify. And when when some of those elders to the Lord, God could use that. I remember when I was 16 and they finally let me go into the jail and uh I got to go and and I' I'd take my guitar. would go every every week and I' I'd go preach to them guys in jail and sing. What was I doing? I had a desire. I had a gift and that gift had to come forth. And the only way that gift could ever come into maturity is for me to use it. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every good preacher's got to start somewhere. Every good singer's got to start somewhere. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ronnie, you you and Sister Linda, y'all y'all remember when Sean preached his first sermon, Jonathan preached his first sermon. Now, those guys are incredible preachers today, but they had to start somewhere. &gt;&gt; A surrender. You see, when we the the the the the old saying is idleness is the devil's playground. And if you're not under the loan and you're not taking your your position responsibly, Satan will find a way for you and make sure that that that that that you're busy. So, what I say today is, Lord, I'm going to take it upon me. I'm going to enter into prayer. I I think that's the best place to start right there for every one of us. Lord, I'm going to surrender everything I've got. I I'm going to pray. God, I don't know what you've called me to do. I don't know what you've called me to be, but you've called me for something, and I want you to use me. if the musicians would come. Hallelujah. I I I want us, Lord, I I I've been feeling something. Maybe there's someone here today and deep down inside your heart, you're you're you're saying, "I I've been feeling something in my heart for a while, Brother Wendell." Well, that the way you do that is just go before the Lord in prayer and say, "Lord, I'm going to surrender everything I've got to you. You're not too young. You're not too old. You're not too far in sin. You don't have too too too bad of a past. We're living in the present. And we've got a bright future. And I say the labors, the harvest is great and the laborers are few. the harvest. There's plenty of to do for the Lord. There's plenty of work. There's plenty of things that I can be active in. But the laborers all want us to go sit in the house instead of going out there in the heat and gathering the harvest. easier easier just to do nothing and say, "Brother, good job you're doing there." God wants to say, we want to hear God saying to us, "Good job." Can you say, "Amen." That's right. That's right. I think the greatest I think the greatest thing that we could ever have is when we stand before the Lord and we find out the souls that have been saved because you surrendered your life to Jesus. [Music] Hey, when I was a kid, I wonder if my pastor that that brat. He he knew if he knew that that brat would end up being a a preacher. I wonder if he knew that those three Martin boys would end up pastoring churches. Wonder if my mama ever thought about that. She's thinking, "Oh, dear Lord." Right? But somebody had to stay faithful. Good days, bad days, somebody had a purpose and a call. I don't know. I I I I I just I just say when we get on the other side, there's going to be a lot of people there's going to be a lot of people that maybe you're thinking, I I just I've been faithful. I've been a faithful mama. I've I've been a faithful Sunday school teacher. I've been a what whatever. I it it just don't seem like it's it don't seem like I've I've got much to offer or but I believe when we get on the other side there's going to be there's sister Emily there's going to be a lot of souls that were touched by your gift by your singing by being who you are. There's going to be a lot of there's going to be a lot of souls on that other side because somebody surrendered [Music] because it takes us all. It takes us all right here in our in our little church here. It takes it it it takes a big a great big team before for us to even get a service for where everyone enjoys themselves. Takes musicians getting here early, tuning up. Takes preacher praying and laying before God and studying. Takes song leaders giving their all, calling out to God, asking for the anointing. It takes all of us. But isn't it wonderful when the effects when the spirit of the Lord comes down upon us? Isn't it wonderful when the anointing of the Holy Spirit just comes in and puts a sanction on it and says, "Ah, I want to come to that church service. [Music] Lord, let me take my let me take your calling serious upon my life." Song leaders, if there's ever been a time for you to dedicate, now's the time. Preachers, if there's ever been a time, now's the time. We're in the final thrust. Oh God, don't let us just be a another preacher, another sermon, but let the anointing of the Holy Spirit come and break the yolks. Mama, you're your position is so important. Oh, you say, "I'm just a mama." You're anointed for this. You're anointed. You're raising sons and daughters that's going to go in a rapture. Take it serious. Call unto God and say, "God, give me I I I I I I need your strength. I need your help. I'm desperate for your anointing. I want you upon my life. Don't want to sing without you. Don't want to preach without you. Don't want to raise children without you. Don't want to go to work without you. I want you in me." Praise the Lord. Thank you Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Here I am.

What would the Lord require of me? I stand up today and I say, "Our God is greater than the devil. I say our God is greater than addiction. I say our God is greater than anything that the devil can do. Hallelujah. That's what God is wanting. Somebody that's so surrendered to him that believes every word. And I believe God can still save the lost, heal the sick, deliver cancer, set us free. God can still deliver our children from alcoholism. God can still deliver our young people.

Do Do Are Did Did you catch the gest of my of my thoughts? God's looking for somebody that's going to look at her man, the bride, looking at her man, and say, "He can do anything. I've got so much confidence in him. I've got so much I'm I'm really I I'm I'm I'm ready to put the whole bank on the line. Amen. God's able. &gt;&gt; I believe God's able.

You know, may maybe you got some sons and daughters out there and saying she was 40 years old or close to 40 years old. Uh how old were you, Stephanie, when you gave your heart to the Lord? 39 years old, living on the streets and uh [Music] given drugs at 12 years old by her mother, giving her a I don't know what you call that thing when you're 16 for your 16th birthday. Cocaine and stuff that was given to her. She smoked it with her. She'd done it with her mom. Her mom died of drugs in the hospital. She died as a very young a young lady. Stephanie come her and Joe come addicted to heroin. They had been to many, many programs, many programs. [Music] when she came to the church almost 10 years ago, God didn't just and she also came with her liver aid up. She had been in the hospital for months liver aid up. Doctor wouldn't put her on a wouldn't put her on the transplant list because she was a druggie. Glory to God. But God didn't just save Stephanie, [Music] but God healed her liver. Gave her a brand new liver. [Applause] That's what God's looking for you and me. He wants somebody to be sold out and believe this stuff, man. He wants somebody that'll that'll take our position as the bride of Jesus Christ seriously. &gt;&gt; God God delivered her. Made her a Sunday school teacher of all things.
