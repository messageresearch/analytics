[36:57] and and um man the the song that brother
[37:01] Kobe uh brought me out on is actually
[37:04] what I'm going to title this tonight uh
[37:07] The Anchor Holds and I'm so glad for the
[37:12] anchor amen it's a secure anchor it's a
[37:14] steadfast anchor let's look here in
[37:17] Hebrews 6 and 11 it says and we desire
[37:21] that every one of you do show the same
[37:23] diligence to the full Assurance of Hope
[37:26] unto the end
[37:28] in that you be not
[37:30] slothful but followers of them who
[37:33] through faith and patience inherit the
[37:36] promises for when God made promise to
[37:38] Abraham because he could swear by no
[37:41] greater he swear by himself saying
[37:43] surely I Will Bless thee and multiply I
[37:47] will multiply thee so after he had
[37:49] patiently endured he obtained the
[37:51] promise for men verily swear by the
[37:54] greater and oath for confirmation is to
[37:57] the an end of all Strife wherein God
[38:00] more willing uh more willing more
[38:03] abundantly to show un The Heirs of the
[38:05] promise the immutability of his counsel
[38:08] confirmed it with an oath that by two
[38:11] immutable things in which it is
[38:12] impossible for God to lie we might have
[38:15] a strong consolation who have fled for
[38:18] Refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is
[38:21] set before us which hope we have as an
[38:25] anchor
[38:27] to of the Soul both sure and
[38:31] steadfast which entereth into that
[38:33] within the veil whether the Forerunner
[38:36] is for us entered even Jesus made a high
[38:40] priest Forever After the order of
[38:44] MDC can you say Amen aren't aren't you
[38:47] glad for that amen I'm thankful for this
[38:51] blessed hope and consolation let's go to
[38:53] the Lord in prayer father we want to
[38:56] thank you today for for your love and
[38:59] your your blessings upon us Lord and we
[39:02] just ask that your anointing would be
[39:05] here this evening on this portion of the
[39:07] service and ask Lord that you would Lord
[39:10] just Minister your word to your to our
[39:13] hearts tonight help Lord both the
[39:15] speaker and the hearer as our prayer
[39:18] father we love you and we thank you for
[39:20] this Blessed assurance that we have in
[39:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can
[39:27] the church say amen amen and amen God
[39:30] bless you you may be seated here this
[39:33] morning or this evening amen now I want
[39:37] to I want to just speak um uh for a few
[39:40] moments here tonight on The Anchor Holds
[39:45] I think it's important that we have an
[39:46] anchor I think it's important that we
[39:50] know who we are and what we are and we
[39:53] we need to make sure that we have the
[39:55] right anchor amen and um uh because as
[40:00] as brother Brandon would say amen he
[40:03] said tonight my brethren your soul is
[40:05] over hell on a chain and that chain is
[40:09] not some Theological Seminary teaching
[40:12] that chain is not some denomination or
[40:15] Creed that you're living by that chain
[40:18] is the word God's word Jesus gave the
[40:22] human race his word to live by and Eve
[40:25] broke it only broke one one little link
[40:28] of it and any chain is no stronger than
[40:30] its weakest link and when you take one
[40:33] word out that was the first of the book
[40:36] Jesus came in the middle of the book and
[40:38] said man shall not live by bread alone
[40:40] but by every word that proceeds out of
[40:42] the mouth of God that was the middle of
[40:44] the book The Last of the book he said
[40:46] whosoever shall take one word
[40:48] mistranslate one
[40:50] word take one word out of here I'll take
[40:54] his part out of the book of life you're
[40:56] passing over hell hanging on the word of
[40:59] God don't let somebody squeeze something
[41:03] into your heart that's not thus saith
[41:06] the Lord can you say Amen so if God put
[41:11] his word and gave you the strongest as
[41:14] brother bradam would put it amen the
[41:17] strongest uh support the strongest
[41:20] anchor right he he didn't give you just
[41:24] amen a religious a a a religious cycle
[41:29] but he gave you the very best he gave
[41:32] you his word he gave you his word I I
[41:36] well sometimes we say well I you know I
[41:39] wish I had this or I wish I had that the
[41:41] greatest thing that you could ever have
[41:43] is God's Vindicated word in this hour
[41:47] amen now two immutable things it said
[41:50] amen the first immutable thing of course
[41:53] it is that God cannot lie amen that
[41:56] every word word that God says is the
[42:00] truth you cannot amen you cannot put
[42:04] your faith in the word of God and come
[42:07] out amen a loser because God gave the
[42:11] promise and it was just as good amen
[42:15] fulfilled as it is the day that he gave
[42:18] it now I I want you to know that because
[42:21] whatever promise God gives he's going to
[42:25] keep it amen now now we want the
[42:28] Fulfillment but I want to tell you as
[42:30] long as you've got it from God Amen you
[42:33] know it's going to come to pass God's
[42:36] word will come to pass everyone say God
[42:39] cannot lie can lie amen God simply
[42:44] cannot change his mind amen if God says
[42:47] well I'm going to do this amen and then
[42:50] a week later he says well I've just I've
[42:51] changed my mind then it can't be God
[42:54] because God never changes
[42:57] he is it's one of his great in uh
[43:00] characteristics he cannot change his
[43:04] mind he cannot lie his word once it is
[43:09] spoke it is just as as forever settled
[43:14] forever and ever well can you say amen
[43:17] amen but then the second thing that God
[43:20] wanted to do this now remember by
[43:22] two immutable things amen that God
[43:26] wanted to let you know he the second one
[43:29] is he confirmed it with an
[43:32] oath Amen in other words he made a
[43:35] covenant with you now now he he he he's
[43:39] he's not just saying well I've given you
[43:41] my word amen that should be enough but
[43:44] he swear and when he when he couldn't
[43:47] find anyone to swear by or anything
[43:50] greater to swear by he swore by his own
[43:54] character and and and so this is the
[43:57] this is what he's saying my character is
[44:00] so great I my reputation is so great I
[44:03] will put all I am on my
[44:08] word everything that I have said I'm
[44:12] going to bring it to pass well can you
[44:14] say amen amen now amen today uh uh there
[44:19] there's not there there's not you know
[44:21] Oaths just don't make uh uh you know
[44:23] don't carry too much weight amen you
[44:26] know we sign contracts and and uh that
[44:29] that have the weight of law behind them
[44:32] and and and if you renig on that
[44:34] contract amen uh uh then you will face
[44:37] legal action in front of a judge and so
[44:40] uh you you you you if you want someone's
[44:43] word today you you just can't go and
[44:46] anymore and and and and just they give
[44:49] you a promise but there's got to be a
[44:52] covenant or a contract sign that that
[44:55] that if You Ren dig they've got
[44:58] something that they can take back uh uh
[45:01] to a judge somewhere can you say Amen
[45:04] well God says I'm going to tell you
[45:06] right now amen I will swear by myself I
[45:11] will swear on my righteousness I've
[45:15] never told a lie I cannot lie it's not
[45:19] who I am but I'm willing to swear and
[45:22] also to give you a covenant he I I I I I
[45:26] want you to know here right now that
[45:28] amen that the Covenant of Jesus Christ
[45:31] Christ hanging on Calvary was God's
[45:35] covenant with you God made a covenant
[45:39] when he slew that lamb Jesus Christ and
[45:44] he said your soul is
[45:46] forever settled with
[45:49] me well that should make you want to
[45:51] shout amen hallelujah now now in the
[45:56] Bible days
[45:57] uh in in times past men swore in the
[46:00] name of their God Amen and and uh who
[46:04] would require it of him should he break
[46:06] it so the oath was taken by a name
[46:09] greater that that that couldn't be
[46:11] broken and so the the the fear again the
[46:14] fear of the one that was greater would
[46:17] would uh amen come upon those who were
[46:20] making the Covenant uh fear of
[46:23] Retribution amen that would come upon
[46:25] the breaker of the oath and amen so it
[46:28] kept them loyal but God I I I I just
[46:32] want to let you know God is so powerful
[46:35] God is so big God Is So magnificent amen
[46:40] God there is nothing that can stop God
[46:43] from doing anything there is no there's
[46:47] no hurricanes that can change God's mind
[46:49] for you there's no family problems that
[46:52] can change God's mind for you amen he is
[46:55] he he could stand there and say I'll be
[46:57] the author and I'll be the finisher of
[47:00] your faith I have started you and I will
[47:04] keep you Body Soul and Spirit until the
[47:07] day of the Lord oh that's a great God
[47:11] Amen that's a great God so he says I
[47:14] give you my promise I swear upon my very
[47:19] own
[47:20] righteousness now this was going to
[47:24] be a great hope now as we read there in
[47:29] in the scriptures that this
[47:32] consolation would be a hope that says
[47:36] there in the 19th verse this hope we
[47:39] have as an anchor of the Soul both sure
[47:43] and steadfast with enter which entereth
[47:46] into that within the veil it's a it
[47:50] becomes a hope because though God can't
[47:53] change you can change right though God
[47:57] can't change your circumstances are
[48:00] changing all the time you wake up in a
[48:02] new world every morning amen you you you
[48:06] don't have uh uh you you don't have the
[48:09] say over you know what germs are coming
[48:11] into the world and and what sicknesses
[48:14] that that that you can endure and the
[48:16] things that you go through you but but
[48:19] it but but it does not matter it does
[48:23] not matter uh on what you're facing the
[48:27] anchor is he gave his word that I'll
[48:32] never leave you nor forsake
[48:35] you amen he cannot lie amen hallelujah
[48:39] someone says God cannot lie God swore it
[48:44] and he proved it by Jesus Christ every
[48:47] time you see a cross amen that was the
[48:51] sacrifice now in in the old days they
[48:54] would amen they would uh uh take
[48:57] a uh that you know uh they they would
[49:00] take a um uh an animal and they would
[49:05] kill the animal and amen and and the
[49:07] blood of that animal uh uh you know they
[49:10] would write a contract up and place that
[49:12] blood upon it amen and then they would
[49:15] say if any one of you if any one of you
[49:18] renig on that promise you will be as
[49:21] this dead animal amen that that this is
[49:24] a covenant this mean this is this is
[49:26] Life For Life you keep your promise amen
[49:30] and so when God gave the church that
[49:33] promise God put it Upon Jesus Christ God
[49:37] says he he gives his word he gives that
[49:41] atonement and every time you see Jesus
[49:44] Christ every time God sees Jesus Christ
[49:48] he is reminded of the oath concerning
[49:51] you he's reminded of his promise
[49:54] concerning you and this was meant as an
[49:58] anchor to our souls that no matter no
[50:02] matter what the situation is we have
[50:06] that anchor lodged to the Rock within
[50:10] that Veil amen now he says and as
[50:14] Abraham was was given that promise amen
[50:18] I he says you as the Seed of Abraham
[50:23] have been given that promise I I I
[50:26] wonder you know sometimes as as as
[50:29] healing we know we we we we get uh uh uh
[50:33] war in these bodies and and and with the
[50:36] foods we eat and the situations you know
[50:39] that we're in round uh you know with uh
[50:41] working in certain plants and different
[50:43] things there's you know we got all kinds
[50:45] of sicknesses we got all kinds of
[50:48] diseases amen but I I I believe that
[50:51] healing is part of that Covenant that is
[50:53] still with us today and God wanted to
[50:56] make that Covenant sure unto
[50:59] Abraham amen I I read I I look there at
[51:02] Abraham's Covenant amen uh there with
[51:05] matters of fact let's just turn there uh
[51:07] not going to hold you long here tonight
[51:09] but I want you to look let's look here
[51:10] in Genesis the 15th chapter and uh let's
[51:14] look at this Covenant that God made with
[51:17] Abraham and I don't know let's um uh we
[51:21] will start amen uh there in the in the
[51:25] ninth verse now God is God has just told
[51:28] him amen fear not Abraham I'm your
[51:31] Shield I'm your exceeding uh uh uh your
[51:34] your your exceeding a great reward and
[51:37] and and he's telling him you're going to
[51:39] have that promise you're going to have
[51:41] that son Abraham's looking back and say
[51:44] Lord I there's no way I can have the son
[51:47] this is what this is what it says in the
[51:48] verse the previous verses amen there's
[51:51] no way I can do this amen and God tells
[51:54] him listen I want you to go he says
[51:58] ninth verse take me an heer of 3 years
[52:01] old and a she goat of 3 years old and a
[52:05] ram of three years old and a turtle dove
[52:08] and a young pigeon and he took unto him
[52:11] all these divided them in the midst and
[52:14] lay each piece one against the other but
[52:17] the birds divided he not and when the
[52:21] fouls came down upon the carcasses Abra
[52:24] Abram drove them away and when the sun
[52:27] was going down and and a deep sleep fell
[52:30] upon Abraham and low and horror of great
[52:34] Darkness fell upon him and he said unto
[52:37] Abraham know of assurity that thy seed
[52:40] shall be a stranger in a land that is
[52:42] not theirs and they shall serve them and
[52:45] they shall afflict them 400 years and
[52:47] also that Nation whom they Shall Serve
[52:50] will I judge and afterwards shall they
[52:53] come out with a great substance thou
[52:55] shall go to thy uh thy fathers in peace
[52:58] and shall be buried in old age but in
[53:01] the fourth generation they shall come
[53:04] hither again uh for the am iniquity of
[53:07] the amorites is not yet full and when
[53:09] the sun came down went down uh when the
[53:13] sun went down it was dark and behold a
[53:16] smoking furnace a burning lamp that
[53:19] passed between the pieces in the same
[53:22] day the Lord made a covenant with
[53:25] Abraham saying unto thy seed have I
[53:29] given this land from the river of Egypt
[53:32] into the Great River the river of euph
[53:34] Fades the Canaanites and the Kites and
[53:38] the catamites and goes on down through
[53:40] there God made this Covenant with him
[53:44] now brother bradam would tell us that he
[53:47] separated the Covenant because this was
[53:50] going to be amen it it was it was going
[53:53] to be the dividing it was it was was God
[53:57] uh uh shedding his blood and he would
[54:00] separate his spirit amen and and and and
[54:04] one would go to hell and then the other
[54:08] would be taken up to the to the throne
[54:10] of God Amen it would be it would it
[54:13] would be God making a covenant with his
[54:17] people he would become an intercessor
[54:21] for his
[54:22] people can you say Amen but then the
[54:25] dove the
[54:27] pigeon the he did not divide this dove
[54:31] in the pigeon amen because brother
[54:33] Brandon would tell us it would it was
[54:35] because healing they were from the same
[54:38] family and that healing would be in the
[54:40] old Covenant and the New Covenant amen
[54:44] that God loves uh to heal his people and
[54:48] and as Abraham as brother bradam would
[54:51] talk about this Covenant he would say
[54:53] Amen that Abraham had to make sure
[54:56] that he kept the car uh the the birds
[55:00] and the Animals off of the
[55:02] carcasses Amen to keep that word clean
[55:05] that sacrifice pure it was his job it
[55:08] was important now that he kept the the
[55:13] amen the the
[55:15] contamination off of those
[55:18] sacrifices talking about the word of God
[55:21] having to be pure and clean in your mind
[55:25] you've got a you've got you got to keep
[55:26] your those those thoughts off that
[55:29] Covenant you've got to keep you you you
[55:31] you've got to keep every filthy Spirit
[55:33] off of that Covenant you've got to make
[55:35] sure that you honor that Covenant just
[55:39] as God Honors that Covenant because this
[55:43] is a covenant that God is making with
[55:45] you and you've got to make sure amen
[55:50] that that that unbelief and amen and
[55:53] skepticism and and and whatever else in
[55:56] our lives keep sin off of that Covenant
[56:00] well praise the Lord I think that's
[56:02] important amen as we talked about the
[56:05] other night a little bit on thoughts
[56:06] your thoughts are
[56:09] important what you think about what you
[56:12] allow what you act upon amen that that
[56:16] sacrifice God made this
[56:20] sacrifice with you can you say Amen
[56:24] brother Bram would say then we find that
[56:26] that that God put uh Abraham into a deep
[56:31] sleep amen he says this was going to to
[56:35] reflect the Covenant that God was going
[56:37] to make with us
[56:38] Gentiles amen that many were going to go
[56:41] to the grave and and and and and you
[56:44] were going to and he allowed him to
[56:46] experience the dark horror amen he
[56:50] allowed Abraham to see how sinful he was
[56:54] and how rotten he was was and how rotten
[56:57] that you and I would be now brother
[56:59] bradam says every one of these things
[57:01] had a significance of what God was
[57:05] trying to show Abraham that in
[57:09] himself he he just Abraham couldn't have
[57:13] the baby Abraham couldn't attain to the
[57:16] righteousness Abraham would never be
[57:19] able to fulfill the any kind of a
[57:22] covenant with God but God is showing you
[57:26] you you you you're a people of of of
[57:29] Darkness you're a people of Amen of
[57:33] wretchedness but I'm not looking at your
[57:37] wretchedness I'm looking at the
[57:41] sacrifice he's telling him now your
[57:45] people are even going to go into into
[57:47] captivity amen these things are going to
[57:50] come he begin to show amen the things
[57:52] that were going to to happen to his seat
[57:55] but he said but I will keep my promise
[58:01] with
[58:02] you Hallelujah can you say Amen the next
[58:05] thing we find out amen is while Abraham
[58:09] is in a deep sleep amen and he's
[58:11] experience the horror of hell and he's
[58:15] experiencing amen where where all of his
[58:18] seed would end up going that's when the
[58:21] the the white light that's when the
[58:23] pillar of fire begin to come in and walk
[58:26] in between those broken pieces amen as
[58:30] the lamb was separated and the or the
[58:32] heord was separated and the she goat and
[58:35] the did you notice there was two shees a
[58:38] there and there was one
[58:39] he amen it was it was God it was Christ
[58:43] dying for the natural seed and that
[58:46] spiritual seed now you can see here now
[58:50] this is so important to me it's so
[58:51] beautiful is the light did not come amen
[58:55] and and and circle around Abraham the
[58:59] light was going in between and walking
[59:03] in between the broken pieces the
[59:06] Covenant that he was making with Abraham
[59:10] he was
[59:11] sanctifying that sacrifice he was
[59:14] letting Abraham know that my Covenant is
[59:19] based upon that sacrifice and not upon
[59:23] the horror of your race
[59:26] oh that should just make you rejoice you
[59:28] know many of times we look at our
[59:30] lineage amen and we can see our children
[59:32] and we see a lot of us amen that we were
[59:34] hoping did not pass amen well can are
[59:38] any of y'all there amen where you look
[59:40] and you say oh I I I I don't want amen
[59:43] that to pass on down to the Next
[59:45] Generation but because of the bloodline
[59:48] amen it goes down through the Next
[59:50] Generation but I'm so glad that you can
[59:54] tell your children listen the same
[59:57] sacrifice and the same Covenant that God
[1:00:01] made with me it is good for your
[1:00:03] generation and for every generation he's
[1:00:06] making the promise to all of Abraham's
[1:00:11] seed so it doesn't you you you see
[1:00:15] Abraham now this was all happening while
[1:00:18] Abraham was in this great deep horror he
[1:00:22] was experiencing a loneliness like no
[1:00:25] other loneliness now this was simply a
[1:00:27] type this was a type of Calvary who was
[1:00:30] going to be torn apart well glory to God
[1:00:32] you remember the Chinese Laundry

[1:00:47] way it is when God comes after you

[1:01:15] the the turtle dove and the pigeon amen
[1:01:19] that now they were from the same
[1:01:21] family and they weren't
[1:01:23] divided and this meant healing it was
[1:01:25] going to be be healing in the new uh
[1:01:28] Covenant and it was going to be healing
[1:01:30] in the old Covenant it was the same God
[1:01:34] the same Covenant each of these
[1:01:36] covenants amen now again they were
[1:01:38] divided there was the Old Testament
[1:01:39] there was the New Testament amen but
[1:01:41] when Christ came amen the New Covenant
[1:01:45] uh uh uh brought had healing in it as
[1:01:47] well and so when we think about the our
[1:01:51] our our healing amen when we think about
[1:01:54] here we are and and we are living in
[1:01:57] horror we we listen we we we we we we're
[1:02:01] living in a this world has so much
[1:02:05] complexes and so much amen our our this
[1:02:10] Our Generations are just so full amen as
[1:02:13] as as as as the wise man said amen a man
[1:02:18] is born of a woman is few days of sorrow
[1:02:21] and grief amen it's so much grief and so
[1:02:24] much sorrow and so much the older you
[1:02:26] get the more Sorrows you see and the
[1:02:29] sicknesses and you you see the
[1:02:31] limitations of mind I mean I it it's
[1:02:34] everywhere around you but again the
[1:02:37] promise is while you're walking in this
[1:02:41] world I'm going to be a Healer to you

[1:02:47] promise you I've got your soul anchored
[1:02:52] behind the veil and it doesn't matter it
[1:02:55] doesn't matter where you at or how how
[1:02:57] rotten the world goes I'm giving you an
[1:03:00] anchor but I'm also going to promise you
[1:03:03] healing healing for your body I am the
[1:03:06] Lord that Health thee of all thy
[1:03:10] diseases amen there in Psalms 103 and2

[1:03:16] is within me amen and forget not all his
[1:03:20] benefits who forgiveth all thy uh
[1:03:24] iniquities and Health all thy
[1:03:29] diseases
[1:03:31] hallelujah
[1:03:33] amen if God done it in the Old Testament
[1:03:37] he does it in the New Testament if God
[1:03:41] started it once if God's ever healed
[1:03:44] he'll bring that healing to you
[1:03:48] sometimes we we we we we don't
[1:03:51] understand the amen where we
[1:03:54] are because many many times am man we
[1:03:57] look at ourselves well aren't aren't you
[1:03:59] glad that God's A
[1:04:01] Healer I I think I think that we could
[1:04:03] all we can have testimony service of
[1:04:05] what God the great healings that God has
[1:04:07] done I don't think we should ever have
[1:04:09] to question whether God heals God does
[1:04:12] heal and we've got to keep amen we we've
[1:04:16] got to keep the the the the the the any
[1:04:20] evil thing off of our covenant amen
[1:04:24] we've got to keep keep the sacrifice
[1:04:27] clean it's important for you and for me
[1:04:30] to keep that sacrifice clean heal
[1:04:33] feelings unbelief amen uh uh you know
[1:04:37] you anything that is contrary to the
[1:04:40] Covenant don't let the Covenant become
[1:04:43] contaminated because once the Covenant
[1:04:45] is contaminated it becomes just like you
[1:04:49] amen listen I don't want me involved in
[1:04:52] the Covenant I want the Covenant kept
[1:04:55] clean I want it the way God gave
[1:04:58] it because when it becomes contaminated
[1:05:01] then it's no good for you amen before
[1:05:04] you know it you don't have the the faith
[1:05:07] that you need to to just reach up and
[1:05:09] grab the healing that God's already
[1:05:11] given you amen you find it hard to be
[1:05:13] able to amen why because you have
[1:05:16] allowed amen circumstances and
[1:05:19] situations to cause your mind Amen to to
[1:05:23] to allow devils and bir and amen all of
[1:05:27] this junk to get on your to get on your
[1:05:29] sacrifice I am here to tell you today
[1:05:33] let's get the junk off the sacrifice and
[1:05:36] let's lift Calvary up high tonight amen
[1:05:40] God gave the Covenant it's not a New
[1:05:42] Covenant it's the Covenant that he gave
[1:05:44] Amen in Jesus Christ if he healed
[1:05:48] yesterday he'll still heal today if he
[1:05:51] done it amen for your family yesterday
[1:05:53] he'll still do it for your family today
[1:05:56] so what what's important now important
[1:05:59] is keep that
[1:06:02] anchor not what the doctor says no that
[1:06:05] that that that anchor won't hold keep
[1:06:07] your anchor in Christ who made the
[1:06:11] Covenant at Calvary 2,000 years
[1:06:15] ago
[1:06:17] amen
[1:06:19] amen now the Situation's comeing that
[1:06:21] you can just just fill in the blank man
[1:06:24] there's plenty of inhibit take it would
[1:06:27] take amen all the notebooks in the world
[1:06:29] to fill in the blanks of what we can put
[1:06:31] in the place of that
[1:06:33] Covenant but there's only one Covenant
[1:06:35] that God made right come on and that was
[1:06:38] through Jesus Christ and that Covenant
[1:06:42] is still alive and well today amen it
[1:06:46] don't matter whether it takes a little
[1:06:47] while amen there there there there's
[1:06:50] always when God gives the promise amen
[1:06:53] there's always the intervals between
[1:06:55] when the promise was given and and and
[1:06:57] when the promise is fulfilled and and
[1:07:00] and sometimes that interval can be a
[1:07:03] little lengthy sometimes amen from the
[1:07:05] time that you pray or even even I'm not
[1:07:09] even saying when you're pray I'm talking
[1:07:10] about when Revelation strikes your heart
[1:07:13] when Revelation strikes your heart that
[1:07:15] it's done that God's that that God has
[1:07:17] saved uh a Johnny and got God got and
[1:07:20] you have that Revelation in your heart
[1:07:22] it might been a service amen that went
[1:07:24] back 10 years years ago and that service
[1:07:27] in that service God says I've given you
[1:07:30] your son now it might be 10 years down
[1:07:33] the road and and and you might think
[1:07:37] well God didn't go God must not he must
[1:07:40] have forgot about it or maybe I just
[1:07:42] misheard it or maybe it was just a
[1:07:44] sensation or if God gives the Covenant
[1:07:48] amen it's all based on Jesus Christ and
[1:07:52] when God reveals to you that you are
[1:07:55] healed or that he saved your child or
[1:07:57] whatever he's done amen it doesn't
[1:08:00] matter how long it
[1:08:04] takes sometimes it takes a long time God
[1:08:07] gave the Covenant H H uh to to Joseph
[1:08:12] that his brothers and his and and and
[1:08:16] and his father would be bowing to him he
[1:08:20] gave him a
[1:08:23] promise but that promise did not come to
[1:08:25] pass last for another 20 years amen it
[1:08:29] did not you but there there were many a
[1:08:31] times I'm sure he was thinking as he was
[1:08:33] sold as he was thrown in the dungeon
[1:08:34] maybe maybe I missed it amen as he was
[1:08:37] pulled up and and sold to to to uh uh uh
[1:08:40] uh the the the uh uh Piper and and and
[1:08:44] and then sold uh into Egypt and and and
[1:08:47] all of these all of these things in his
[1:08:49] life it did not hinder circumstances
[1:08:53] does not hinder
[1:08:56] we have an anchor behind the veil the
[1:09:01] one who placed it in your heart that
[1:09:04] says Johnny is saved is going to
[1:09:08] save he ain't going to save Johnny he
[1:09:11] saved Johnny when he gave you the
[1:09:15] promise can you say Amen but you've got
[1:09:18] to have an anchor when the when when the
[1:09:21] when the rivers are pulling you every
[1:09:23] which direction and the trial are
[1:09:25] pulling you every direction and the time
[1:09:28] seems to go and go and go and go you've
[1:09:32] got to have an anchor in that Veil and
[1:09:36] say I believe God and he cannot
[1:09:41] lie praise the
[1:09:43] Lord there's an interval
[1:09:47] between Hallelujah and you know what God
[1:09:50] gave that promise God gave that promise
[1:09:53] to Abraham and when he put him to sleep
[1:09:55] sleep he says now truly there's going to
[1:09:58] be some things here I'm telling you that
[1:10:01] your seed is going to possess and that
[1:10:03] all the nations of the Earth are going
[1:10:04] to be blessed by you and all and then
[1:10:06] God begins to show it now but I must let
[1:10:09] you know amen they're going to go in
[1:10:11] they're going to be servants for 400
[1:10:13] years and there's going to be Hallelujah
[1:10:16] don't look at the
[1:10:19] horror look at the
[1:10:21] sacrifice I've Anointed The Sacrifice

[1:10:31] you're go your world is going to fall
[1:10:32] apart every other week amen you're going
[1:10:34] to be so up and down don't look at the
[1:10:38] circumstances or the feelings or at your
[1:10:41] ability or the lack of your ability
[1:10:44] place your anchor in that Veil you can't
[1:10:49] see Jesus Christ he has passed behind
[1:10:52] that Veil amen but there is still
[1:10:55] something that is tugging there's
[1:10:57] something saying it's real there's
[1:10:59] something saying it is Anchor tonight I
[1:11:04] don't care what you're feeling don't
[1:11:05] care what's going on around in your
[1:11:07] world The Anchor Holds and is
[1:11:12] steadfast
[1:11:14] Hallelujah healing is mine salvation is
[1:11:18] mine can you say
[1:11:22] Amen yes sir God says go go go God tells
[1:11:26] the disciples go wait in Jerusalem till
[1:11:28] you be endued with power from on high
[1:11:31] and then he's taken
[1:11:33] up so the guys go to Jerusalem and it
[1:11:37] didn't happen the first day it didn't
[1:11:39] happen the second day it didn't happen
[1:11:42] the third day it didn't well can you
[1:11:45] sayen but they waited because the word
[1:11:49] was true right God told Noah build an
[1:11:53] ark for the saving of you and and your
[1:11:55] household it's going to rain build that
[1:11:59] art 10 years went by 20 years went by 50
[1:12:04] years went by 80 years went by a 100
[1:12:07] years went by 110 years went by 120
[1:12:12] years went by but he anchored in that
[1:12:16] word are you hearing me God will not
[1:12:19] everyone say it with me God will not lie
[1:12:27] right can you say
[1:12:30] Amen you see we when he gives that
[1:12:33] promise then we've got to wait that that
[1:12:37] delay that delay is the trying time for
[1:12:39] the believer hallelujah it's the trying
[1:12:42] time try your heart is that right amen
[1:12:46] hallelujah and and uh I don't know if I
[1:12:49] should even fit this in here but but
[1:12:52] just uh Austin knows what a delay means
[1:12:56] amen likeed the girl but there was a
[1:12:58] delay amen but I I told him it's it's
[1:13:01] it's a good thing it's it's a good to
[1:13:03] just tries your heart see where amen I
[1:13:06] but I I told him I said I don't think
[1:13:07] the girl's worth it you go get you
[1:13:09] another girl Hallelujah and uh he says
[1:13:13] no I think she is worth it and uh amen
[1:13:17] he see we Hallelujah that's a year of
[1:13:21] your life wasted amen but he's looking
[1:13:23] at it saying oh no this is an investment
[1:13:27] amen and uh and and and so but God God's
[1:13:31] got that in in your in every one of you
[1:13:35] there's if God's delayed there's a
[1:13:37] reason God's delaying when God gives the
[1:13:40] promise you remember what the scripture
[1:13:42] says whom he did for know them he also
[1:13:45] did predestinate that's before the
[1:13:46] foundation of the world Amen to whom he
[1:13:49] predestinated to be conformed to the
[1:13:51] image of his son he also called whom he
[1:13:53] called he justified amen and whom he's
[1:13:56] Justified he is
[1:13:58] already glorified so the day that God
[1:14:02] gives the promise is the day that you're
[1:14:04] already glorified but you're stuck in
[1:14:06] the delay you're stuck in the interval
[1:14:09] amen God predestinated you and then he
[1:14:12] calls you out of the world he justifies
[1:14:15] you and you're going through this stage
[1:14:18] but in God's mind you're already
[1:14:23] glorified Hallelujah
[1:14:25] it's done in God's
[1:14:28] mind now you're the ups and the downs
[1:14:31] and the ins and the outs can you say
[1:14:33] amen amen so the end design of the
[1:14:38] oath is is to make the promise sure and
[1:14:42] to
[1:14:43] encourage those to whom the promise was
[1:14:46] given amen Hebrews 6

[1:14:51] so the same
[1:14:53] diligence to the full assurance of Hope
[1:14:55] until the end that ye be not slothful
[1:14:58] but followers of them who faith and
[1:15:01] patience inherit the
[1:15:04] promises

[1:15:14] waiting and you're
[1:15:16] wondering you can wait but you don't
[1:15:19] have to wonder the
[1:15:21] anchor it's it's just as it's just as

[1:20:55] when those promises start coming to pass
[1:20:57] right here on this Earth and in this
[1:21:00] church it's going to be enough to bring
[1:21:02] about a
[1:21:05] Rapture because God's given some pretty
[1:21:07] big promises to you and
[1:21:09] me he's given some
[1:21:14] promises and he can not
[1:21:21] lie y'all remember when brother brandham
[1:21:24] was told he was going to
[1:21:25] have
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:32] Joseph he says he couldn't find it
[1:21:34] written in the Bible it wasn't written
[1:21:35] in the
[1:21:37] Bible but he loved Joseph so much the
[1:21:40] character of Joseph in the Bible
[1:21:43] and he says the anointing was so strong
[1:21:45] and he he said he found himself in a
[1:21:47] closet as he was
[1:21:50] just pulling himself away and talking to
[1:21:53] God how how great of a character that
[1:21:56] man was and and just reflecting and the
[1:21:59] presence of the Lord was in the
[1:22:01] room and then the Lord told him you're
[1:22:05] going to have a

[1:35:47] with one another and believe with one
[1:35:51] another we're all connected to that same
[1:35:54] sacrifice we're all connected to Jesus
[1:35:57] Christ and
[1:35:59] so um we where we should have that that
[1:36:05] love and that prayer for one another and
[1:36:07] and reaching out
[1:36:10] amen amen we're attacked uh matters of
[1:36:13] fact there is there there
[1:36:16] is there is one quote where brother
[1:36:18] bradam says in a church he says now he
[1:36:21] says that church you know talks about
[1:36:23] the hail uh uh you know hanging over it
[1:36:27] and and he says the weakest link the
[1:36:29] weakest link in that church is the
[1:36:32] weakest
[1:36:33] Saint he uses that he said that's your
[1:36:36] weakest Saint he said so secure the
[1:36:39] weakest link in your chain so that the
[1:36:42] church can Su uh uh uh succeed and be
[1:36:47] blessed and so I I I I think that's that
[1:36:51] that's the reason why we love our elders
[1:36:55] we love our those that are going through
[1:36:57] the trials we want to be there for one
[1:36:59] another amen because
