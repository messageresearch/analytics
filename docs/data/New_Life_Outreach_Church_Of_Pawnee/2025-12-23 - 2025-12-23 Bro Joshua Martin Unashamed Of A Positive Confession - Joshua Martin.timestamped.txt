[9:21] We're missing them. [applause]
[9:23] Always a pleasure to see them tonight.
[9:25] Amen. Like to go to prayer [music] if we
[9:27] may. Can you just play that song because
[9:30] of who you are? As we get ready to go to
[9:32] prayer, we don't have any written
[9:35] [music] request, but like to remember um
[9:38] brother Patrick, sister Staca, uh
[9:41] they're in the hospital now. Last time I
[9:43] heard she's [music] a six. And so I know
[9:46] they're excited. That's where mom and
[9:48] dad is. They're [music] up there with
[9:49] them tonight. So let's just remember
[9:51] them that the Lord would just keep his
[9:53] hands upon them tonight. and my wife
[9:56] hasn't been feeling good the last few
[9:58] days and the only reason she's here
[10:00] tonight [music] is because of the
[10:02] medication that she has. So, let's
[10:04] remember her as well. Uh if there's any
[10:07] other needs, Brother Robert's not here.
[10:09] Um Sister Tibbetha's still in Kansas.
[10:13] Let's remember
[10:15] on her way back, so let's just ask the
[10:16] Lord to keep his hands upon her. If
[10:18] there's any other needs upon your heart,
[10:20] just [music] make it known by the
[10:22] lifting of your hand. And brother John,
[10:24] would you mind leading us in prayer here
[10:26] tonight? Amen.
[10:38] Amen.
[10:40] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we come
[10:42] before you tonight. Father, we we love
[10:44] you. We're thankful that you promised
[10:46] that you'd be with us, Lord. So, we know
[10:48] you're here, Father. And Lord, while
[10:50] we're in your presence, we'd like to ask
[10:52] you to touch all the ones that are
[10:54] feeling bad or sick, Lord, or [music]
[10:56] anything that they have on their hearts
[10:58] and minds. Lord, I ask you just to come
[11:00] down and touch that need, Lord. And
[11:03] Lord, our precious brother and sister
[11:04] that's in the hospital having a baby.
[11:06] Lord, there's there's nothing like new
[11:08] life coming into the world. I know you
[11:11] blessed us to have five, Lord. And
[11:13] [music] and Lord, we're so thankful for
[11:15] every one of them. So Lord, I know
[11:16] they'll be thankful, too. So Lord, we
[11:18] ask you to go and help them and let it
[11:20] [music] be quick and good and relatively
[11:23] easy, Lord. We ask that, Father. And the
[11:25] ones that are traveling, Lord, we ask
[11:27] you to keep your hand on them, Father.
[11:29] And Lord, we [music] put this service
[11:31] into your hand for we're looking forward
[11:32] to hearing your word, Father. We're
[11:34] looking forward to hearing what you have
[11:36] to say to us, God. So Lord, we hand
[11:38] [music] this service over to you,
[11:40] Father. We thank you. In Jesus name we
[11:42] pray. Amen. Thank you. Appreciate you.
[11:46] Can we sing this as the man of God
[11:48] comes? Because of who [singing] you are,
[11:51] I give you glory.
[11:56] And because of who [singing] you are,
[12:00] I give you praise.
[12:04] And because of who you [singing] are,
[12:08] I will lift my voice and say, "Lord, I

[12:20] Lord, I worship you.

[12:46] And because of who [singing] you are, I

[15:41] Lord. I worship you [singing] because of
[15:46] who you are.
[15:50] Amen. [music] Do you have a praise upon
[15:51] your lips this this evening? Has he been
[15:54] good to you? [applause and music]
[15:57] I believe that we can all testify of the
[15:59] goodness of God and what he's done in
[16:02] our individual lives. He would save us,
[16:05] justify us, sanctify us, fill us with
[16:07] the Holy Ghost, and just incredible what
[16:10] [music] what the Lord has done in all of
[16:12] our journeys and what he's continued to
[16:14] going to do for [music] us as we walk
[16:17] our our path of life. Amen. But it's you
[16:20] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[16:21] this evening. It's good to see Brother
[16:23] Joe and Sister Stephanie. Man, we sure
[16:26] have been missing them around here. It's
[16:28] so [applause] good so good to see y'all.
[16:30] I'm sure y'all are getting settled in
[16:31] and and everything there there in
[16:33] Louisiana. It's so good to good to have
[16:36] y'all with us here tonight. But if you
[16:38] would have your Bibles, let's open our
[16:40] scriptures to Mark 8 and38.
[16:44] Amen. I know we we have a few out
[16:47] tonight, but where two or three are
[16:49] gathered in his name, he promised to be
[16:51] in our midst. And are you thankful for
[16:53] that promise?
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. It don't matter the the crowd size
[16:56] or the the amount of people that's here,
[16:59] the Lord can still speak and touch
[17:01] hearts. Amen. I had some wisdom teeth
[17:04] pulled Thursday. And so, if uh hopefully
[17:07] I don't pull those stitches here
[17:08] tonight. So, just pray pray for me and
[17:10] and we'll we'll preach and and trust the
[17:13] Lord to keep us through it. Amen. But
[17:15] Mark 8:38,
[17:18] "Whosoever there therefore shall be
[17:20] ashamed of me and of my words in this
[17:23] adulterous and sinful generation, of him
[17:26] also shall the son of man be ashamed
[17:29] when he cometh in the glory of his
[17:31] father with holy angels." Amen. Can we
[17:34] bow our heads this evening? Dear
[17:36] gracious heavenly father, Lord, how
[17:39] humbled we are by your presence we feel
[17:41] here this evening, Lord. God, we ask
[17:43] that you would just take preeminence in
[17:45] their service. Father, we lay lay
[17:47] ourselves aside, Lord. We lay aside our
[17:50] thoughts and and Lord, our our ideas and
[17:52] our motives, Father. And we ask that you
[17:54] would just have preeminence here among
[17:57] us, Lord. You know the needs and the
[17:58] hearts of the people that is here
[18:00] tonight, Father. We ask that the word as
[18:03] it would come forth. May it be anointed,
[18:05] Father, and inspired here. Father, we
[18:08] ask that you would just be pleased here
[18:09] among us. Be with Patrick and Staca.
[18:11] Father, we ask that you your angels just
[18:13] be around them, Lord. Give a peace,
[18:15] Father, and may everything just go
[18:17] smoothly and may it go easily, Father.
[18:20] God, we're thankful for your grace and
[18:22] your mercy in Jesus name. Amen. You may
[18:25] be seated here tonight. I just I have a
[18:27] simple thought, but it would be
[18:29] unashamed of a positive confession.
[18:32] These are some things that I have been
[18:34] just just studying on in in my de
[18:37] personal devotion. So I I pray it's a
[18:39] blessing to you here tonight. But here
[18:42] Jesus would say, "Whosoever is ashamed
[18:44] of me and of my words in this adulterous
[18:48] and sinful generation, I'll be ashamed
[18:50] of him." And brother Brandham, he would
[18:52] preach a message on this scripture
[18:54] called ashamed. And he would say, you
[18:56] notice there was so much of that today,
[18:59] especially on the subject that I'm
[19:00] speaking of, ashamed of the word. Now he
[19:03] and the word are the same. In the
[19:06] beginning was the word. The word was
[19:07] with God and the word was God and the
[19:10] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[19:12] The same yesterday, today and forever.
[19:14] So whosoever is ashamed of me and my
[19:17] words and he and the his word are one.
[19:20] So being ashamed of his word in this
[19:22] sinful present generation, I'll be
[19:26] ashamed of him. So, brother Brandham, he
[19:28] would put this as a a present tense
[19:30] scripture, not something of the past or
[19:33] something that's going to come, but he
[19:35] would put it that this is the evil and
[19:37] wicked and adulterous generation that
[19:40] that Christ is talking about. And and
[19:42] and we're living in the day where where
[19:45] it's hard to be satisfied with
[19:48] something. And brother Brandham would
[19:50] would preach the message ashamed and
[19:52] would say it's to be ashamed is to be
[19:54] embarrassed.
[19:55] And we would know if you're embarrassed
[19:57] of something, you're not necessarily
[19:59] satisfied with it. And we're living in a
[20:02] society where nobody is satisfied. You
[20:04] know, if you you have a blue car,
[20:06] there's a green car you can have. Or you
[20:08] have a white car, there's a black car
[20:09] you can have. If if you don't like the
[20:11] way you look, you can you can dye your
[20:13] hair. You can pull some teeth. You can
[20:16] you can do do whatever it is. And you
[20:18] can change the change the the the look
[20:21] you may have. or if you have a house
[20:23] that's too small, you can buy one that's
[20:25] bigger. It's easy to come in the mindset
[20:28] of of it's it's it's greener on the
[20:30] other side of the fence. And brother
[20:32] Brandham, he would ask the question, are
[20:34] we sufficiently impressed with the word
[20:36] in our midst? In other words, it's easy
[20:39] to be unsatisfied with what God has
[20:42] given us. And and I believe that that
[20:45] we're living in the time of famine. And
[20:47] the Bible would tell us we're living in
[20:49] the time of famine. And and it's
[20:50] incredible because the Bible tells us
[20:53] this ain't a normal famine. This ain't
[20:55] this ain't something that it's a lack of
[20:57] food or a lack of water. But the Bible
[21:00] would tell us it's the lack of hearing
[21:02] the word of God. And normally when you
[21:04] think of a famine, you think of lacking
[21:06] something. You think of you don't have
[21:08] enough food or there's not enough water.
[21:10] But this ain't the case in this famine.
[21:13] The Bible tells us in Amos 8:11,
[21:15] "Behold, the days come, sayaeth the
[21:17] Lord, that I will send a famine in the
[21:20] land, not a not a famine of bread, nor
[21:22] thirst for water, but of hearing the
[21:25] words of the Lord. And they shall run
[21:27] from wonder from sea to sea and from
[21:29] north, even to the east. They shall run
[21:32] to and fro to seek the word of the Lord,
[21:35] and shall not find him." So, in other
[21:37] words, it ain't missing something, but
[21:40] the answer is there, but they're not
[21:42] satisfied with it. So, it's not that
[21:44] they're lacking the word of the Lord.
[21:46] They're lacking ears to hear the word of
[21:49] the Lord. But, but it's incredible
[21:51] because the Bible says they're wandering
[21:53] from east and to the north looking for
[21:56] the word of the Lord. And you would
[21:58] think if they had a desire for the true
[22:00] word of the Lord, they could see it's in
[22:03] their midst. But they're looking for
[22:05] something, but they don't know what's
[22:07] what. They don't know what can satisfy
[22:09] the hunger. And brother Brandham, he
[22:11] would preach a thinking man's filter,
[22:13] right? And would say that that you you
[22:15] smoke a cigarette, you're you're you're
[22:16] you're wanting a certain taste, right?
[22:19] He says many people say is I'm just
[22:21] saking on it. And he says, "Well, suck
[22:23] on your finger." And he says, "That
[22:24] ain't going to satisfy it." He says,
[22:26] "Suck on a stick." He says, "That ain't
[22:28] going to satisfy because he's looking
[22:30] for a certain taste. And that taste can
[22:33] only be satisfied by the nicotine that's
[22:36] in that cigarette. So in other words,
[22:38] not anything not not anything can
[22:40] satisfy the taste that he's looking for.
[22:43] So here the world is going from church
[22:46] to church, denomination to denomination,
[22:48] from seed to sea, because they're in a
[22:51] famine, but they don't have a they don't
[22:53] have a thinking man's filter. They don't
[22:56] have a taste for the word of the Lord.
[22:59] But the Bible would tell us where the
[23:00] carcass is there, the eagles will be
[23:03] gathered together. So in other words,
[23:05] while one people is in a famine, the
[23:08] other one is eating of plenty. And the
[23:11] Bible would tell us in Joel 2:25, "And I
[23:14] will restore to you the the years that
[23:16] the locust has eaten, that the
[23:18] cankerworm, the caterpillar, and the
[23:20] palmer, my great army, which I sent
[23:22] among you, and you shall eat in plenty
[23:25] and be satisfied. and praise the name of
[23:28] the Lord your God that have dealt
[23:30] wondrously with you and my people shall
[23:34] never be ashamed. And I think it's
[23:36] incredible that he links being satisfied
[23:39] and not being ashamed together. So once
[23:42] you're satisfied with what God has given
[23:45] you, then you're not ashamed of it. So,
[23:47] in other words, while while the world is
[23:49] roaming to and fro looking for
[23:51] something, we are in a we're in a
[23:53] restoration where we're eating of plenty
[23:56] and we're satisfied with what is in our
[23:59] midst. And it would be the Apostle Paul
[24:01] that would say, for I am not ashamed of
[24:03] the gospel. For it is the power of uh uh
[24:06] the power of salvation to everyone that
[24:09] believes it. It's incredible because the
[24:12] reason he would not be ashamed of it is
[24:15] because he was persuaded of it. He would
[24:17] say, "I'm persuaded that nothing can
[24:19] separate me from the love of God." So,
[24:22] and so since he was persuaded of it, he
[24:24] was satisfied with it. Then he was not
[24:27] ashamed of it. And I believe we have too
[24:30] many Christians that is unsatisfied with
[24:33] what God has given us. So, they're
[24:35] looking for something. They're trying to
[24:37] satisfy their hunger with this. They're
[24:40] trying to satisfy this with with with
[24:42] this church doctrine. But little do they
[24:44] know that God has given us something to
[24:47] restore us back to original condition
[24:50] where it's fellowship with God and God
[24:53] alone. Not fellowship with a priest or a
[24:56] preacher or a church doctrine, but it's
[24:58] FELLOWSHIP WITH ALMIGHTY GOD. JOB, WHERE
[25:02] WAS YOU WHEN THE SONS OF God shouted for
[25:04] joy? In other words, you was before YOU
[25:06] WAS IN THIS TRIAL. YOU WAS IN MY MIND
[25:09] AND AFTER THE TRIAL YOU'RE going to be
[25:11] back in my mind. So be satisfied with
[25:14] what I am giving you. So I believe that
[25:17] the meat of the word satisfies the taste
[25:20] of the eagles. And brother Brandham in
[25:22] that message of thinking man's filter
[25:25] then he's tasted of heavenly things.
[25:27] He's got the word of God in his heart.
[25:30] He sees it manifested before him and his
[25:33] whole soul is wrapped into it. and the
[25:36] world and all of the things around him
[25:38] is dead. I think that's a powerful
[25:41] quote. He's tasted of heavenly things.
[25:44] So once he's tasted of it, he's willing
[25:46] to he's willing to wrap his whole soul
[25:49] into it. See, not partially wrap
[25:52] yourself into it, but once you're tasted
[25:54] of heavenly things, you're willing to
[25:57] wrap every part of yourself into it. If
[25:59] it's your family life, I'm going to wrap
[26:01] it in two. If it's my children, I'm
[26:03] going to wrap it in wrap them in two. If
[26:06] it's my church, I'm going to wrap it
[26:08] because I've tasted of heavenly things.
[26:11] Have you tasted of heavenly things this
[26:13] evening? That it's more than just quotes
[26:15] and and scriptures and doctrines, but
[26:17] it's heavenly things in the midst of
[26:20] famine that can satisfy the taste that
[26:23] we are looking for. So, we're not just
[26:26] just tasting of anything, but we're
[26:29] eating of the word that God has given us
[26:32] in this generation. And brother Brandham
[26:34] would say, "Have you ever thought how
[26:36] great that is? What could you give in
[26:38] exchange? In this day of confusion, this
[26:41] day when people don't know what to do,
[26:43] which way to go, the Bible said these
[26:46] days would come that there would be a
[26:48] famine in the land, not for bread or
[26:50] water, but for hearing the true word of
[26:53] God." And the people would go from east
[26:55] to the west, the north to the south,
[26:58] seeking to hear the true word of God.
[27:01] And here we are privileged tonight to
[27:03] see the message of God. So here, brother
[27:06] Brandham says that they're seeking to
[27:08] hear the true word of God because every
[27:11] every lie has a portion of truth in it.
[27:13] Brother Brandham would tell us that that
[27:15] the Baptist had a portion of truth, but
[27:17] then they denominated around it, right?
[27:19] And so they have a portion of it and
[27:21] they're looking for something, but
[27:23] they're stuck in the portion and the and
[27:26] the denominational filter that has been
[27:28] built around that. and they're looking
[27:30] for something but THEY CANNOT FIND IT.
[27:33] BUT the bride is privileged to see the
[27:36] message of God. And I like it whether
[27:38] Brandham puts it. We're not just looking
[27:40] at something but we understand it.
[27:42] Right? Brother Brandham tells us to see
[27:44] means to understand. Unless you're born
[27:46] again, you cannot see the kingdom of
[27:48] God. So we're not just looking at a
[27:50] message, we're seeing the message. We
[27:53] are privileged to understand what God
[27:55] has given us. And then he he would say,
[27:57] "We're privileged tonight to see the
[28:00] message of God, the angel of God." And
[28:02] I'm so thankful that we have seen the
[28:04] star that God has given us in this
[28:07] generation. We're a privileged people.
[28:10] THAT'S ENOUGH TO SATISFY every hunger.
[28:13] That's enough to satisfy every part of
[28:16] our life. And so, we're not looking for
[28:18] the word of the Lord, but we have found
[28:20] it. You remember the parable of the lost
[28:22] coin that she will look everywhere. She
[28:24] looked under the vase. She would look
[28:26] under the carpet. She was trying to find
[28:28] her lost coin. But the Bible says once
[28:31] she found the coin, she went from
[28:33] looking to rejoicing. She would say, the
[28:36] Bible says she got all the neighbors
[28:38] together and would say, "I have rejoice
[28:40] with me for I have found the peace which
[28:43] I had lost." And I thought, "Oh my, we
[28:46] have a right to rejoice because the
[28:48] bride has found what humanity lost IN
[28:51] THE GARDEN. GOD HAS GIVEN us back in
[28:54] this generation. So it ain't a time to
[28:56] to look for something. It's a time to be
[29:00] satisfied with what God has given us.
[29:03] And brother Brandham would would in the
[29:04] message of shame would say I want to
[29:06] take a little text from there if to be
[29:09] called that called ashamed. You know I
[29:11] like that. Whosoever is ashamed of me
[29:13] and of my words I'll be ashamed of him.
[29:16] Now the word ashamed could also be
[29:18] translated embarrassed. You know, you
[29:21] know something, you're faced with
[29:22] something that you're embarrassed about.
[29:24] Being ashamed, that another thing being
[29:26] ashamed does, it shows you're not sure
[29:29] of what you're talking about. If you
[29:31] know what you're talking about and have
[29:34] the assurance that you know what you're
[29:36] talking about, you can tell anybody that
[29:39] cuz you're not ashamed. And so here,
[29:42] brother Brham is putting it that if
[29:45] you're ashamed, you're not sure of what
[29:47] you're talking about because you have no
[29:49] assurance. But I believe the word of the
[29:51] Lord has assurance behind it. I believe
[29:55] that we're not just the blind leading
[29:56] the blind and stumbling around in
[29:59] confusion, but there's an assurance
[30:01] behind it that if we can wrap our soul
[30:03] into it, there's promises that God has
[30:06] given us that we can accept and be
[30:09] fulfilled in our lives. And and the
[30:12] Bible would say in Psalms 37:18, "The
[30:15] Lord knoweth the days of the upright,
[30:17] and the inheritance shall be forever,
[30:20] and they shall not be ashamed in the
[30:22] evil time. In the days of famine, they
[30:24] shall be satisfied." And so, we're
[30:27] living in an evil time. And brother
[30:29] Brandon, he would tell us it's the most
[30:31] deceitful age. And and we're and we're
[30:34] living in a time where where you can't
[30:36] trust anybody's word. And and you have
[30:38] AI. You don't know if it's true or if it
[30:41] if it's just a robot or if it's fact or
[30:43] fiction. And and it's incredible that
[30:46] brother Brown would put it that this is
[30:48] the most deceitful age because if you
[30:50] look around, you can see it. And I
[30:53] believe that is by design of the devil
[30:56] that people is roaming to and fro
[30:58] looking for something and the truth is
[31:01] here to snatch the bride. But yet it's a
[31:03] deceitful time. And what the
[31:05] deceitfulness is trying to do is to get
[31:08] us unsatisfied with what God has given
[31:11] in our midst. And brother Brandon would
[31:14] say as I stood there looking at it and
[31:16] thinking of how deceitful it was. The
[31:18] question came to me and I stood back and
[31:21] looked at the pack again and this is in
[31:23] the message of thinking man's filter. It
[31:25] just seemed like like something said to
[31:27] me the slogan is all right but a
[31:29] thinking man a thinking man's filter a
[31:32] smoking man's taste. It it came to me
[31:34] that's that's deceitfulness also in the
[31:37] natural realm there in the tobacca is
[31:40] something on the order of the churches
[31:42] today. See a deceitfulness. It's come to
[31:45] the whole world has become a of a great
[31:48] deception of what really truth is and
[31:51] what right is. And brother Brandon would
[31:54] tell us in one place that that uh uh uh
[31:57] that there's many truths out there but
[31:59] there's only one truth and that is
[32:01] Christ. And he says that's that's
[32:02] heavenly born truth. And so a lie is
[32:05] going to have a little portion of truth
[32:07] in it. And and you can brother Brandon
[32:09] would would would see a commercial one
[32:11] time and and how that it was a dish
[32:13] soap. Y'all remember the story and how
[32:15] that I believe he was at an airport I
[32:17] think he said and he would see a
[32:19] commercial about some dish soap. He
[32:20] would order the dish soap and he would
[32:22] tell his wife that don't worry about the
[32:24] dishes. I'm going to wash them. You just
[32:26] go and relax. And brother Brandham says
[32:28] he got that dish. He he put it into that
[32:31] bucket, pulled it out, and it was just
[32:33] as dirty as it was before it went into
[32:36] the bucket. And then he would say this
[32:38] here. So I said, when I see anything
[32:41] highly advertised, I just bypass from it
[32:44] then don't bother it because I know it
[32:47] did not work on that. And I thought, oh
[32:50] my, CUZ THAT THAT THAT THAT'S HUMAN
[32:52] NATURE. YOU FOOL ME ONCE, YOU AIN'T
[32:54] going to get me again, right? And here
[32:55] we are in a deceitful age where there's
[32:58] LIE ON EVERY CORNER, LIE on every
[33:00] street. And it's easy to get the
[33:02] mentality. Oh, it's too good to be true.
[33:05] But this message IS THE TRUTH. NOT ONLY
[33:08] a truth, but it's the truth, the life,
[33:11] and the way. AND IT IS THE POWER TO SEE
[33:14] A RAPTURE. IT'S A POWER TO SEE A BODY
[33:17] CHANGE. IT'S THE POWER WHERE WE CAN SEE
[33:19] LOST LOVED ONES IF THEY WENT BY THE WAY
[33:21] OF THE GRAVE. It has an AUTHORITY BEHIND
[33:24] IT TO BACK UP THE PROMISES THAT IT HAS
[33:28] given because that commercial gave
[33:30] promises but it DIDN'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO
[33:33] BACK IT UP. You see, these ain't just
[33:34] EMPTY PROMISES THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US.
[33:37] BUT it there's AN AUTHORITY BEHIND IT TO
[33:41] BACK UP EVERY PROMISE THAT GOD has
[33:43] promised us. And I believe that that
[33:46] while we're living in this deceitful
[33:48] age, what the what the devil's trying to
[33:50] do is destroy the influence of the word.
[33:54] And brother Brandham, he would tell us
[33:56] that when Jesus was upon the earth, he
[33:58] says the people hated him. The the
[34:00] Pharisees and the Sadducees, they hated
[34:02] him because they were jealous of him.
[34:04] And he says what they done was they
[34:06] tried to destroy the influence of Christ
[34:10] before the people. And he says, "So is
[34:12] it today trying, the devil's trying to
[34:14] destroy the influence of this message
[34:18] before the people." And brother Brandham
[34:20] says, "If the devil can do that, he's
[34:22] got the whole thing whipped." And I
[34:24] think that's incredible that it that
[34:26] that that it's the influence of the
[34:28] message that is transforming lives. It's
[34:31] the influence of the message that that
[34:33] that is taking sinners and and drug
[34:35] addicts and alcoholics and and
[34:37] TRANSFORMING THEIR LIVES. THERE'S AN
[34:39] INFLUENCE BEHIND IT. SO if the if the
[34:42] devil can get it watered down to just
[34:45] another portion of truth like a creed or
[34:48] a dogma, it takes away the influence of
[34:51] it to change lives. It takes away the
[34:53] influence to keep marriages together. It
[34:56] takes away the influence THE THE
[34:58] AUTHORITY TO transform lives and
[35:01] individuals. But I believe that whether
[35:04] people are coming under ungodly
[35:06] influences, I believe the bride IS
[35:09] SATISFIED WITH THE influence of the word
[35:12] of the Lord and is clinging on TO IT.
[35:15] NOT PUSHING IT AWAY, BUT IS clinging on
[35:18] to the influence of the word of the
[35:21] Lord. And brother Brandon would say this
[35:24] here, the church can never progress
[35:26] until it knows what grounds it's
[35:28] progressing on. And I believe that
[35:30] before anybody could ever move or have
[35:33] real confidential faith is first have to
[35:36] know where they stand, how to stand
[35:38] after they make the stand, I believe
[35:40] that's essential for you cannot just
[35:43] head long plunge into something with
[35:45] faith when you don't know what you're
[35:47] plunging. You've got to know. And if our
[35:50] faith is set right in the right
[35:52] position, it gives constant
[35:55] satisfaction. So once we know where
[35:57] we're going because you can look at
[35:59] Abraham, you know, as I was thinking on
[36:01] these lines and the Bible says by faith
[36:03] Abraham when he was called out to go to
[36:05] a place that he would not know and and I
[36:08] think that that and that's an incredible
[36:10] thing. You know, human nature would be
[36:12] like, God, where am I going? God would
[36:14] say YOU I AIN'T TELLING YOU just leave
[36:17] your kindred, leave your folks behind.
[36:19] Leave your leave your family, leave your
[36:21] home, everything you know. leave it
[36:23] behind to a PLACE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU.
[36:26] And and if it would have been me, I
[36:27] would have said, "Well, can you show me
[36:28] now?" No, I need you to WALK BY FAITH.
[36:31] YOU SEE, SO HERE ABRAHAM WOULD WALK holy
[36:34] upon faith without knowing the direction
[36:38] HE WAS GOING. BUT THE BRIDE HAS BEEN
[36:40] GIVEN A DIRECTION. WE'RE NOT JUST
[36:42] WALKING and Lord, I'm trusting you. I
[36:44] DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. BUT WE KNOW
[36:46] WHERE WE'RE GOING. AND WE KNOW HOW WE'RE
[36:48] GOING TO GET THERE. WE KNOW GOD HAS
[36:50] GIVEN US A A A WORD TO give us a
[36:53] rapturing grace, a rapturing faith to
[36:55] get us CAUGHT UP INTO THE HEAVENLIES
[36:57] THAT ONE DAY we're going to STEP INTO
[36:59] OUR BODY CHANGE SO WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE
[37:01] GOING AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE.
[37:04] AND THAT GIVES A CONSTANT SATISFACTION.
[37:07] ON THE BAD DAYS, I'M SATISFIED ON THE
[37:10] MOUNTAINTOP. I'M SATISFIED IN THE
[37:12] VALLEYS. I'M SATISFIED WHEN IT FEELS
[37:14] LIKE MY WORLD IS FALLING APART. I AM
[37:17] STILL IN A CONSTANT SATISFACTION BECAUSE
[37:21] I KNOW the direction that I am going.
[37:24] And that's an incredible thing that WE
[37:26] CAN BE SATISFIED WITH THE WORD OF the
[37:29] Lord and and know that God has given us
[37:32] an assurance. The Bible would say in 1
[37:34] Thessalonians 1 and5, for a gospel came
[37:37] not unto you in word only, but also in
[37:40] the in power and in the Holy Ghost and
[37:43] in much assurance. In other words,
[37:46] there's an influence behind it to assure
[37:48] you that this word can satisfy. That
[37:52] this word is not just empty promises,
[37:55] but you can put it upon your lips. And
[37:57] as you're speaking the word, YOU'RE
[37:59] YOU'RE YOU'RE SATISFIED THAT GOD IS
[38:02] GOING TO BACK THAT WORD UP. WE'RE NOT
[38:04] EMBARRASSED to speak THE PROMISES OF
[38:06] GOD, BUT WE KNOW THAT GOD CAN BACK THEM
[38:09] UP. AND AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE you
[38:12] can look at Noah. Brother Brandon would
[38:14] say that it was a scientific age and yet
[38:17] Noah would say it's going to rain. And
[38:19] here brother Brandon would say there
[38:20] there was instruments in the sky to
[38:22] prove there was no such thing as rain.
[38:24] It had never RAINED BEFORE. BUT WHAT
[38:26] WOULD NOAH DO? GET UP FOR 120 YEARS.
[38:30] IT'S GOING to rain. AND COULD YOU
[38:31] IMAGINE the the scoffing and the
[38:34] RIDICULE THAT NOAH WOULD GET FOR ONLY
[38:37] CONFESSING THE WORD? HE WASN'T
[38:39] CONFESSING HIS OWN IDEA, HIS OWN
[38:41] THOUGHTS. IT WAS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD
[38:44] THAT HE WAS CONFESSING. AND I COULD JUST
[38:46] IMAGINE him getting up on A SUNDAY
[38:48] MORNING, PUTTING HIS clothes on, going
[38:50] to church, and they said, "No, you're
[38:51] not welcome here. We don't believe it's
[38:54] going to rain. There's no such thing as
[38:55] rain." AND HERE, NOAH MAY HAVE BEEN CAST
[38:58] OUT OF THE CHURCH, BUT YET THE GRACE OF
[39:01] GOD WOULD EMBRACE HIM. HE WAS CAST OUT
[39:03] OF ONE PLACE, BUT ACCEPTED INTO ANOTHER.
[39:07] AND WE MIGHT BE RIDICULED FOR FOR
[39:09] BELIEVING THE PROMISES OF GOD. WE MIGHT
[39:11] BE ABLE TO BL MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BLEND
[39:13] IN WITH SOCIETY. BUT YET THERE'S A PLACE
[39:16] THERE'S A SAFE HAVEN THAT GOD HAS GIVEN
[39:19] US THAT HE'S WRAPPED THIS WARMING BRACE
[39:21] AROUND US THAT WE CAN BE SATISFIED.
[39:24] HALLELUJAH. WHILE THE WORLD IS GOING TO
[39:27] AND FRO, I AM IN A CONSTANT SATISFACTION
[39:30] BEHIND THE VEIL, FEASTING ON HEAVENLY
[39:33] THINGS, FEASTING ON THE ORIGINAL MAN.
[39:36] THAT IS WHAT I AM FEASTING UPON.
[39:38] HALLELUJAH. So you might NOT FIT IN ONE
[39:41] PLACE, BUT GOD HAS accepted us in
[39:43] another. You remember that the Bible
[39:45] would talk about how there was a man
[39:47] that was born blind and how that Jesus
[39:49] would open up his eyes. Y'all remember
[39:51] the story? And the Bible would say that
[39:53] that the parents would go that the that
[39:55] the Jews would go to the parents, right?
[39:57] And would say, "Is this your son that
[39:59] was blind?" And what would they say?
[40:01] They would say, "Yep, that is our son."
[40:03] And they would ask them, "How did he get
[40:05] HIS SIGHT?" AND WHAT WOULD THEY SAY? ASK
[40:08] HIM, HE'S OF AGE. ASK HIM, HE'S of age.
[40:11] He can speak FOR HIMSELF. IN OTHER
[40:14] WORDS, I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS JUST OF a
[40:16] certain NUMBER, BUT HE WAS OF MATURITY
[40:19] WHERE HE WAS NOT ASHAMED TO SPEAK WHAT
[40:22] GOD HAD DONE FOR HIM. ASK HIM. HE'S OF
[40:25] AGE. They were ASHAMED TO TESTIFY OF
[40:28] WHAT GOD WAS DOING. BUT THIS ONE WAS OF
[40:31] MATURITY. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY IN
[40:33] one place THAT THE PENTECOSTAL SHOULD BE
[40:36] of age but they're not. BUT HE SAYS THE
[40:39] BRIDE, HE'S CALLED THE BRIDE OUT OF THE
[40:41] PENTECOSTAL AGE. SO IN OTHER WORDS,
[40:44] WHILE THE PENTECOSTAL SHOULD BE OF AGE,
[40:46] OF MATURITY, THEY ARE NOT. BUT THERE'S A
[40:49] BRIDE THAT HE'S CAUGHT OUT OF THEM AND
[40:52] IS PLACING THEM IN AN AGE OF MATURITY
[40:55] WHERE THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED TO SPEAK THE
[40:58] PROMISES OF GOD. OH, THIS MAN WOULD THEY
[41:01] WOULD COME UP TO THIS man and he would
[41:02] say, "I don't I don't know IF HE'S A
[41:04] SINNER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
[41:05] ABOUT. ALL I KNOW IS WHAT THE INFLUENCE
[41:08] OF HIS WHAT HE DONE FOR ME. IT CHANGED
[41:11] MY LIFE. I ONCE WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I
[41:14] SEE. LET ME TESTIFY OF THE GOODNESS OF
[41:17] GOD. LET ME TESTIFY OF THE INFLUENCE OF
[41:21] THE WORD MADE FLESH IN MY PRESENT DAY.
[41:24] In this evil, DECEITFUL AGE, THE WORD
[41:27] STILL HAS AN INFLUENCE. WHILE THE THE
[41:30] LEOIAN SPIRITS IS TAKING OVER CHURCHES,
[41:33] YET IT IS NOT TAKING AWAY THE AUTHORITY
[41:36] OF THIS WORD. THIS WORD IS STILL
[41:38] CHANGING LIVES. IT IS STILL HEALING THE
[41:41] SICK. HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE HE CAN STILL
[41:44] FIL WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[41:46] THIS WORD HAS NOT LOST ITS POWER. IT HAS
[41:49] NOT LOST HIS AUTHORITY, BUT IS THE SAME
[41:51] YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER.
[41:55] HALLELUJAH. IT HAS NOT LOST HIS ABILITY
[41:57] TO SAVE, but it can still do it. AND THE
[42:00] BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT THAT HE WOULD
[42:03] HE would say, "I was blind, but now I
[42:05] see." And and so they would go to the
[42:06] parents would come back to the man and
[42:09] would say, "We're going to ask you
[42:10] again. How did you GET YOUR SIGHT?" AND
[42:12] THE MAN WOULD SAY, "IF I TELL YOU, will
[42:14] you believe me? I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU."
[42:16] AND THE BIBLE SAYS HE BE TO PREACH to
[42:19] the Pharisees. You can look at uh John 9
[42:22] and 30. The man answered and said unto
[42:24] them, WHY HEREIN IS A MARVELOUS THING
[42:27] THAT YE KNOW NOT from whence he is and
[42:30] yet he hath opened my eyes? NOW WE KNOW
[42:33] THAT GOD HEARETH NOT SINNERS. BUT IF ANY
[42:35] man be a worshshiper of God, and doeth
[42:38] his will, him he heareth. Since the
[42:41] world began, WAS IT NOT HEARD that any
[42:44] man open the eyes of the one that was
[42:47] born blind? IF THIS MAN WERE NOT OF GOD,
[42:50] HE COULD DO NOTHING. AND THEY ANSWERED
[42:52] HIM, answered and said unto him, THOU
[42:54] WAS ALLTOGETHER BORN IN SIN, AND THUS
[42:57] THOU TEACH US. And they cast him out.
[43:00] AND I THOUGHT THAT WHAT'S SO POWERFUL
[43:02] ABOUT THIS STORY IS THE next verse. The
[43:05] Bible says Jesus heard that they cast
[43:08] HIM OUT AND HE WENT AND FOUND HIM. SO
[43:11] WHILE HE WAS CAST OUT OF THE CHURCHES
[43:14] FOR NOT BEING ASHAMED OF THE INFLUENCE
[43:17] OF THE WORD, THAT WORD WOULD CLAIM HIS
[43:20] LIFE. HALLELUJAH. IT WOULD BE JESUS
[43:23] COMING AND SEEKING HIM OUT AND WOULD
[43:25] SAY, "YOU STOOD FOR ME. YOU WASN'T
[43:27] ASHAMED OF ME. I'M NOT GOING TO BE
[43:29] ASHAMED OF YOU." AND I BELIEVE THAT
[43:31] EVERY TIME SOMEBODY STANDS UPON THE WORD
[43:34] OF THE LORD, GOD GETS A LITTLE BIT PROUD
[43:36] AND WOULD SAY, "YOU'RE STANDING FOR ME.
[43:38] I'M GOING TO STAND FOR YOU. YOU'RE NOT
[43:41] ASHAMED OF MY WORD. I'M GOING TO ANSWER
[43:43] YOUR PRAYER. YOU'RE SPEAKING FOR YOUR
[43:45] CHILDREN. I'M NOT GOING TO BE ASHAMED OF
[43:47] YOU. I'M GOING TO ANSWER THAT PRAYER.
[43:49] WHILE YOU'RE BEING REJECTED BY ONE, I'M
[43:52] GOING TO ACCEPT YOU." HALLELUJAH. THAT
[43:55] YOU CAN BE SATISFIED WITH THE WORD OF
[43:58] THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. AND SO WHILE HE
[44:01] WAS CAST OUT OF ONE PLACE, he was being
[44:03] embraced in another. And it's incredible
[44:06] because Jesus wouldn't even tell him his
[44:09] name, you know, cuz he he didn't even
[44:11] know what what Jesus' name was. He would
[44:13] have say, "I was blind. Now I see. I
[44:15] don't even know his name." And here
[44:17] Jesus would come up to him and would
[44:19] say, "Do you can can you confess that
[44:21] THAT THAT THAT CHRIST IS THE LORD?" HE
[44:23] WOULD SAY, "WHO IS IT?" And he would
[44:25] say, "I am he." AND THEN HE WOULD FALL
[44:27] DOWN AND WORSHIP HIM. I THINK THAT'S
[44:30] INCREDIBLE THAT HERE HE WAS ATTRACTED to
[44:33] that influence before he ever knew WHO
[44:36] HE REALLY WAS. WHAT IS IT?
[44:38] PREDESTINATION. YOU WAS ATTRACTED TO
[44:41] THIS WORD BEFORE YOU EVER REALIZED WHAT
[44:44] IT WAS. AND ONCE YOU STARTED TO EMBRACE
[44:47] IT, THEN GOD WOULD COME AND SAY, "HEY,
[44:49] I'M GOING TO CALL YOU INTO MY FOLD."
[44:52] HALLELUJAH. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AN
[44:54] EMBRACE THAT YOU CAN FILL ME IN EVERY
[44:57] SITUATION. AND IT'S incredible because
[45:00] brother Brandham would tell us that. But
[45:02] if you just rely on hope, you hinder
[45:05] faith. He says, "Now hope looks for
[45:07] something way off, but faith claims it
[45:10] right now." See, faith says GOD SAID SO
[45:13] AND IT'S MINE. That settles it. See, I
[45:16] don't care if I'm still crippled, if I'm
[45:19] still blind, if I'm still sick. That has
[45:22] nothing to do with it. I believe it
[45:24] anyhow. It's mine right now. God said
[45:27] so. That settles it. See, that is faith.
[45:31] He continues on and says, "BUT HOPE SAYS
[45:33] GOD SAID SO. I'm expecting to get it
[45:36] someday. You see, I'm expecting someday.
[45:40] As long as Satan can put you off another
[45:43] day, that's as good as he wants." He
[45:45] says, "That's right. You'll never get
[45:47] it." AND THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT THE
[45:50] JEWS WERE DOING. the the the the
[45:51] Pharisees were doing. THE MESSIAH IS
[45:53] COMING, BUT THIS AIN'T HE. And here,
[45:56] this blind man saying he's doing WHAT
[45:57] THE WORD SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO. SO, HE
[45:59] WASN'T pushing it off in the future, BUT
[46:02] HIS FAITH WAS CLAIMING IT RIGHT THEN.
[46:05] SO, Brother Brandham continues on in
[46:07] that quote. He says, "You'll never get
[46:09] it. JUST BELIEVE THAT YOU GOT IT RIGHT
[46:12] NOW." HE SAYS, "It's your personal
[46:14] property. Faith is the substance of
[46:16] things hoped for. The evidence of things
[46:19] not seen is that right faith ACTS NOW
[46:23] IT'S POSITIVE. HE SAYS OH MY I TELL YOU
[46:25] SICKNESS and everything ELSE WHEN FAITH
[46:28] STEPS IN IT'S LIKE A SNOWBALL on a hot
[46:31] stove. It just melts away. Everything
[46:34] goes away from faith because faith
[46:36] stands up and takes over. When faith
[46:39] speaks, EVERYBODY ELSE KEEPS STILL. And
[46:43] I thought that's a powerful thing THAT
[46:45] HE SAYS FAITH has a VOICE AND IT'S A
[46:47] POSITIVE VOICE. When faith speaks,
[46:50] EVERYTHING ELSE SHUTS UP. SO IN OTHER
[46:52] WORDS, hope is pushing it off. GOD CAN
[46:55] DO IT. GOD can do it. God can do it. AND
[46:57] THAT VOICE IS SPEAKING SOMETHING IN THE
[47:00] FUTURE AND IT HAS NO ASSURANCE OF TODAY.
[47:04] But when faith speaks, IT AIN'T PUSHING
[47:06] THE PROMISES OFF TILL TOMORROW, BUT IT'S
[47:09] CLAIMING THEM RIGHT NOW WITH AN
[47:11] ASSURANCE. HALLELUJAH. AND WHEN THE
[47:14] VOICE OF FAITH SPEAKS, EVERY DOUBT SHUTS
[47:17] UP. EVERY OTHER INFLUENCE, IT HAS TO BE
[47:20] QUIET BECAUSE FAITH HAS SPOKEN A
[47:23] POSITIVE VOICE. HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S
[47:26] WHAT I WANT TO BE. I WANT MY LIFE TO
[47:28] SPEAK FAITH. I DON'T WANT IT TO SPEAK
[47:30] DOUBT OR NEGATIVITY, BUT I WANT MY
[47:33] TESTIMONY TO BE LIKE ENOCH'S TESTIMONY.
[47:36] You can LOOK AT HEBREWS 11:5. BY FAITH,
[47:38] ENOCH WAS TRANSLATED THAT HE SHOULD not
[47:41] see death and WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD
[47:44] HAD TRANSLATED HIM. FOR BEFORE HIS
[47:46] TRANSLATION, HE HAD THIS TESTIMONY THAT
[47:49] HE PLEASED GOD. BUT WITHOUT FAITH, IT IS
[47:52] IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE HIM. IN OTHER
[47:55] WORDS, HIS LIFE WAS SPEAKING A VOICE OF
[47:58] FAITH. HALLELUJAH. YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO
[48:00] SPEAK A SERMON LOUDER THAN YOUR VOICE.
[48:03] RIGHT? SO IN OTHER WORDS, ONCE HE WAS
[48:05] OFF OF A SCENE, HE HAD A VOICE OF FAITH
[48:08] THAT WAS TESTIFYING THAT I AM NOT
[48:11] SPEAKING NEGATIVE THINGS, BUT MY LIFE IS
[48:14] A POSITIVE REFLECTION OF THE WORD OF THE
[48:17] LORD. AND YOU KNOW, ENOCH IS YOUR TYPE.
[48:19] COME ON NOW. SO IF HIS LIFE WAS A
[48:22] REFLECTION OF POSITIVE FAITH, WHAT ABOUT
[48:25] US? I BELIEVE AS WE'RE WALKING IN THE IN
[48:28] THE WORKPLACES OR AT SCHOOL OR AT THE
[48:30] GROCERY STORE, I BELIEVE OUR LIFE CAN
[48:33] TESTIFY OF POSITIVE THINGS. HEY, IT'S
[48:36] EASY TO COME UNDER THE GLOOM. IT'S EASY
[48:38] TO COME UNDER THE CLOUDS OF HEAVINESS.
[48:41] BUT GOD HAS NOT GIVEN US A SPIRIT OF
[48:43] FEAR, BUT OF POWER AND OF A SOUND MIND.
[48:46] HE HAS NOT CALLED US TO BE UNDER THE
[48:49] CLOUDS of gloom. Come on NOW. HE HAS NOT
[48:51] CALLED US TO BE UNDER THE CLOUDS OF
[48:53] DISCOURAGEMENT WHERE OUR LIFE IS
[48:55] SPEAKING NEGATIVE VOICES BUT ARE WE ARE
[48:58] CALLED TO SPEAK A POSITIVE VOICE IN THIS
[49:02] GENERATION. WHAT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD
[49:04] SAY WHAT WE NEED IS THOUSANDS OF LIVING
[49:06] VOICES. WHAT IS IT? IT'S PEOPLE THAT HAS
[49:09] COME IN CONTACT WITH THEIR GOD AND
[49:12] THEY'VE GOT AN ASSURANCE AND IT'S
[49:14] SOMETHING POSITIVE THAT IS TESTIFYING
[49:17] THROUGH THEIR LIVES. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S
[49:20] THOUSANDS OF LIVE VOICES THAT is
[49:22] declaring the word of the Lord. And I
[49:26] want that to be my testimony that my
[49:29] life is pleasing unto God. And it's
[49:31] impossible to PLEASE HIM BUT WITHOUT
[49:33] FAITH. I WANT MY LIFE to be pleasing to
[49:35] God. And the Bible would tell us in
[49:38] Romans 10:8. But what saith it the word
[49:41] is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in
[49:43] thy heart. The word and that is the word
[49:46] of faith which we preach. And if you
[49:49] look up that word nigh, it means at
[49:51] hand. So the word is at hand even in thy
[49:54] mouth and in THY HEART. AND THIS is the
[49:57] word of faith which we preach. And and I
[49:59] like how the apostle Paul he's putting
[50:02] him. The word of faith ain't something
[50:03] to come, but it's what I'm preaching to
[50:05] you now. And I believe that brother
[50:07] BRANDON PREACHED WHAT PAUL PREACHED. AND
[50:09] SO THE WORD IS AT HAND. THE WORD IS NIGH
[50:13] THEE AT HAND. BELIEVE IT IN THY HEART
[50:15] AND IN THY MOUTH WHICH THIS IS THE WORD
[50:18] which we are preaching. And the Bible
[50:20] said the next verse Romans 10:9 that if
[50:23] thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[50:25] Lord Jesus and shall believe in THINE
[50:27] HEART THAT GODATH RAISED HIM FROM THE
[50:29] DEAD THOU shalt be saved. For with this
[50:32] heart the man believeth unto
[50:34] righteousness, and with the mouth
[50:36] confession is made under salvation. For
[50:38] the scripture saith, whosoever believeth
[50:41] ON HIM SHALL NOT BE ASHAMED. SO ONCE WE
[50:45] are taking the the word of faith into
[50:47] our hearts, NOW WE'RE NO longer ashamed
[50:50] to speak them. Cuz I don't believe the
[50:52] word is just just to be in THE HEART,
[50:55] BUT IT'S TO BE IN THE MOUTH AS WELL.
[50:57] RIGHT? BECAUSE WHAT'S IN THE HEART'S
[50:58] going to be in the mouth, right? You
[51:00] speak WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART. AND THE
[51:02] BIBLE WOULD TELL US IN PSALMS 119 and
[51:04] 80, let my heart BE SOUND IN THY
[51:07] STATUTES that I be not ashamed. In other
[51:11] words, let me BE SO SO SOUND OR OR MY
[51:14] SOUL SO WRAPPED IN YOUR STATUTES THAT I
[51:18] AM NOT ashamed of a positive faith. And
[51:21] I believe that that this word is our
[51:24] identity. THE APOSTLE PAUL WOULD say in
[51:26] Colossians 2 and 10, you are complete in
[51:29] him. Colossians 3 and4 WHEN CHRIST WHO
[51:32] IS OUR LIFE IN OTHER WORDS this message
[51:35] is our completion THIS MESSAGE IS OUR
[51:38] LIFE THIS MESSAGE IS OUR ALL and all and
[51:42] what it is is it's not just IN OUR HEART
[51:45] BUT IT'S IN OUR MOUTH AND IT'S A
[51:47] TESTIMONY OF A POSITIVE FAITH BRANDON
[51:50] WOULD SAY LIKE ABRAHAM WHO CALLED those
[51:53] things which were not as though they
[51:55] WERE HE TOOK GOD AT HIS WORD BELIEVING
[51:58] THAT HE was able to perform perform what
[52:00] he had promised. He says the trouble of
[52:03] it is with the church today we come with
[52:06] hope instead of faith. He says FAITH IS
[52:09] POSITIVE. FAITH HAS NO booster or faith
[52:12] needs no booster. FAITH KNOWS WHAT IT'S
[52:14] TALKING ABOUT. Faith is strong. Faith
[52:17] has hairs on its chest. It speaks and
[52:19] the rest of them shuts up. He says
[52:22] symptoms can't not can't even speak when
[52:25] real godly faith speaks. And and I like
[52:29] how brother Brandon, he would put that
[52:31] he don't he didn't say that the that
[52:34] faith takes away the voice of the
[52:37] symptoms, but they have no right to
[52:39] speak. In other words, they still have a
[52:41] voice to speak, BUT WHEN FAITH is
[52:44] speaking, their voice can't even be
[52:46] heard. You see, because this message
[52:47] ain't going to take away your symptoms.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Come on now. This message ain't going to
[52:52] take away your heartaches. It's not
[52:53] GOING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR TROUBLES. IT'S
[52:55] NOT GOING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR STRUGGLES.
[52:57] BUT WHAT IT DOES, IT gives you a faith
[52:59] THAT SPEAKS LOUDER THAN THOSE TROUBLES.
[53:03] It gives you a faith THAT SPEAKS LOUDER
[53:05] THAN THE HARD TIMES. IT SPEAKS LOUDER
[53:08] THAN THE THAN THE BACKSLIDEN CHILD OR OR
[53:10] THE THE THE MARITAL PROBLEM THAT IS
[53:12] GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE. THAT FAITH IS
[53:15] SPEAKING LOUDER THINGS INSTEAD OF
[53:17] GETTING BOGGED DOWN ON THE NEGATIVE. THE
[53:21] POSITIVE IS CONSTANTLY LIFTING YOU up
[53:24] and saying, "Hey, there's a promise for
[53:25] you." YOU TURN ON A MESSAGE AND THAT
[53:27] ENCOURAGES YOUR HEART WHENEVER YOU'RE
[53:29] HAVING A BAD DAY. WHAT IS IT? IT'S FAITH
[53:32] SPEAKING POSITIVE THINGS THAT IS
[53:34] DROWNING OUT THE NEGATIVE that you are
[53:37] WALKING THROUGH. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[53:40] REMEMBER JONAH, THE BIBLE WOULD SAY THAT
[53:42] THAT he was in the belly of a well. You
[53:44] remember that story? As a child, brother
[53:46] Brandon would say he looked over here,
[53:48] wells belly. He looked over there, wells
[53:50] belly. HE SAYS SEAWEED WAS WRAPPED
[53:52] AROUND HIS NECK. HE SAYS, "WELL, WHAT
[53:54] WHAT AND WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS THE BIBLE
[53:56] WOULD SAY THAT HE WOULD COUNT ALL OF
[53:58] THOSE THINGS AS LYING VANITIES." In
[54:01] other words, he wasn't saying that the
[54:04] voices of those vanities WERE GONE, BUT
[54:06] WHAT they were speaking were lies
[54:09] compared TO THE TRUTH. HALLELUJAH.
[54:12] YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS
[54:14] SPEAKING AGAINST YOU. BUT WHEN it comes
[54:17] to THE TRUTH, THEY ARE BLINDED. THEY'RE
[54:19] DUMBED OUT BY THE VOICE OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[54:23] AND WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS JONAH 2:9, "But
[54:26] I was sacrificed unto thee WITH THE
[54:28] VOICE OF THANKSGIVING." SO WHILE THE
[54:31] LYING vanities were speaking, instead of
[54:34] speaking those same lies, he would BEGIN
[54:37] TO SING PRAISES UNTO GOD. YOU SEE, THE
[54:40] DEVIL'S GOING to speak negative things.
[54:42] WHY DO YOU SPEAK THEM, TOO? INSTEAD of
[54:44] getting down there with him and speaking
[54:46] the negative things, START TO PRAISE GOD
[54:48] WITH A POSITIVE WORD, WITH A POSITIVE
[54:51] FAITH. DID YOU SEE THOSE LYING VANITIES
[54:54] WASN'T GOING TO GET JONAH OUT OF THAT
[54:56] OUT OF THAT THE WELL'S BELLY? I ALWAYS
[54:59] GET THAT BACKWARDS. THE LYING VANITIES
[55:01] WASN'T GOING TO GET HIM OUT OF IT. BUT
[55:03] ONCE HE STARTED TO SING POSITIVE THINGS,
[55:06] brother Brandon WOULD SAY, "HOW DID HE
[55:08] KNOW which direction the temple was?" HE
[55:10] SAYS HE DIDN'T. IT WAS INSPIRATION. SO
[55:13] ONCE HE STOPPED LISTENING, COME ON NOW,
[55:16] TO LYING VANITIES AND BEGIN TO SPEAK
[55:19] POSITIVE THINGS, INSPIRATION WOULD
[55:22] STRIKE THAT HEART AND WOULD POINT HIM TO
[55:25] THE PROMISE THAT SOLOMON WOULD SPEAK
[55:28] MANY YEARS BEFORE THAT TIME. AND I SAY
[55:31] IT'S TIME TO STOP DWELLING ON THE
[55:32] NEGATIVE AND START SPEAKING POSITIVE
[55:35] THINGS. THAT INSPIRATION CAN STRIKE THAT
[55:38] HEART AND CAN CHANGE SITUATIONS, CAN
[55:41] CHANGE THE SIT THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU
[55:44] MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH. You see, because
[55:47] a negative word will never go, it's not
[55:49] going to bring you out of depression,
[55:50] RIGHT? A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE IS NOT GOING
[55:53] TO BRING YOU OUT OF OUT OF
[55:54] DISCOURAGEMENT, BUT THE WORD of the Lord
[55:57] will, right? You see, brother Brown, he
[55:59] would say this here. I want to ask you a
[56:02] question. WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO us to
[56:05] come to church and sit in a meeting and
[56:07] ponder and maybe be discouraged because
[56:10] we didn't get a prayer card or maybe be
[56:12] discouraged because of some ill thing a
[56:15] neighbor did or or discouraged about one
[56:17] little matter or the other that keeps
[56:20] Christ away from you. IT'S WHEN YOU'RE
[56:23] THINKING ON HIM. AND AS I CAME ACROSS
[56:26] THAT QUOTE, I thought that's a powerful
[56:28] thing. WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO BE
[56:31] SITTING IN the present? You remember
[56:32] when it was Martha THAT HERE JESUS WAS
[56:35] AT WAS AT HER HOUSE, RIGHT? AND HERE
[56:37] MARTHA WAS WAS TROUBLED ABOUT MANY
[56:40] THINGS. And what WOULD JESUS SAY?
[56:42] MARTHA, MARTHA, YOU'RE TROUBLED ABOUT
[56:44] MANY THINGS, BUT MARY HAS CHOSEN THE
[56:47] GOOD THING. SO HERE HERE MARTHA was
[56:50] troubled. SHE HAD TROUBLES IN HER LIFE.
[56:52] BUT LITTLE DID SHE KNOW that the answer
[56:55] to her troubles was in the building. So
[56:58] instead of thinking and GETTING IN THE
[57:00] PRESENCE OF THE ANSWER, SHE GOT WRAPPED
[57:02] UP IN HER TROUBLES. COME ON NOW. WE CAN
[57:05] DO THE SAME THING. COME IN THE PRESENCE
[57:07] OF CHRIST. AND GOD'S MOVING AND THE WORD
[57:10] IS COMING FORTH TO ANSWER QUESTIONS, BUT
[57:13] WE'RE THINKING ON THE TROUBLES. WE'RE
[57:15] WRAPPED UP IN THE HARD TIMES. WE'RE
[57:17] WRAPPED UP IN BITTERNESS. WE'RE WRAPPED
[57:18] IN WHAT THIS ONE SAID, WHAT THAT ONE
[57:20] DID. AND HERE CHRIST IS SAYING THINK
[57:22] I'VE GOT THE ANSWER IF YOU CAN GET AWAY
[57:25] FROM THE NEGATIVE AND THINK ON THE
[57:28] POSITIVE.
[57:29] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[57:31] MY HE says brother Brown in that QUOTE
[57:34] HE SAYS THAT KEEPS CHRIST away from you.
[57:37] And I thought I don't want my my
[57:39] negative thinking to keep Christ from
[57:40] me. I'm sure that's your attitude as
[57:43] well. I don't want my negative
[57:44] confessions to keep the word keep Christ
[57:47] away from me. BROTHER BROWN WAS SAY SO
[57:50] WE WANT TO change from hope today to a
[57:53] positive faith. He says there's only one
[57:55] way we CAN GET POSITIVE FAITH. THAT'S BY
[57:58] POSITIVE THINKING OF POSITIVE THINGS.
[58:01] THERE WE GO. THERE'S OUR ANSWER. HOW DO
[58:03] I GET THIS POSITIVE FAITH, BROTHER JOSH?
[58:06] BY THINKING ON POSITIVE THINGS. AND AND
[58:08] BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE WOULD DEAL with
[58:10] with positive thinking. He would say,
[58:12] you hear so much of it today, positive
[58:14] thinking. Think on positive things.
[58:16] Brother Brandham would say this here.
[58:18] You just put your mind on anything and
[58:20] think and THINK POSITIVE ON IT. HE SAYS
[58:23] THE DEVIL can do that. He says there's
[58:25] only one thing that rules over ALL AND
[58:28] THAT'S GOD'S WORD. If you are thinking
[58:30] contrary to the word, forget your
[58:33] thinking. Think on the word. So we're
[58:36] not JUST THINKING POSITIVE THINGS. WE'RE
[58:38] THINKING THE POSITIVE things that THE
[58:40] WORD HAS PROMISED US. THIS AIN'T
[58:43] PSYCHOLOGY LIKE YOU KNOW THOUGHT OVER
[58:45] MATTER. YOU'RE TRYING TO THINK YOUR WAY
[58:46] into it. You're trying to think YOUR WAY
[58:48] OR OR PROMISE TO DO BETTER. BUT WE'RE
[58:50] THINKING ON THE POSITIVE WORD AND THAT
[58:53] WORD HAS AN INFLUENCE. AND AS WE'RE
[58:56] THINKING ON THAT WORD, INSPIRATION CAN
[58:59] STRIKE. THAT WHEN THE WORD'S COMING
[59:01] ACROSS, THAT WORD IS FOR ME. THE WORD IS
[59:04] FROM MY FAMILY. THE WORD IS FROM MY
[59:06] SITUATION. THE WORD IS FROM MY CHILDREN.
[59:08] THE WORD IS FROM MY MARRIAGE. THE WORD
[59:10] IS WHAT I HAVE. THAT'S THE ANSWER TO MY
[59:13] QUESTION. WHAT IS IT? WHILE YOU'RE
[59:15] THINKING ON THE POSITIVE THINGS OF THE
[59:18] WORD OF GOD, THEN INSPIRATION CAN STRIKE
[59:20] IT. HALLELUJAH. And I CAN TESTIFY THAT
[59:24] THAT THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME MANY TIMES,
[59:26] you know, where you be on the work the
[59:28] on the on the job site or driving down
[59:30] the road and and you're listening to a
[59:32] tape and and you're thinking of what's
[59:33] on the tape, right? IT AIN'T JUST BACK
[59:35] BACKGROUND NOISE, BUT YOU'RE THINKING ON
[59:38] THE WORD OF THE LORD AND INSPIRATION
[59:39] STRIKES THE HEART AND YOU THINK, "OH MY,
[59:42] THAT'S WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT." YOU
[59:43] KNOW, OH THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT.
[59:45] WHAT WAS IT? WHILE I WAS THINKING ON THE
[59:48] POSITIVE THINGS OF THE WORD, INSPIRATION
[59:51] WOULD STRIKE THE HEART. AND I BELIEVE
[59:53] THAT DON'T JUST HAPPEN TO PREACHERS.
[59:55] COME ON. NOW, I BELIEVE THAT CAN HAPPEN
[59:56] TO LEOTY. BUT THE PROBLEM OF IT IS WE'RE
[59:59] NOT SATISFIED WITH IT. RIGHT? IF YOU'RE
[1:00:02] NOT SATISFIED WITH IT, YOU'RE NOT GOING
[1:00:04] TO TURN ON THE TAPES, RIGHT? WHENEVER
[1:00:06] YOU'RE WASHING THE DISHES, YOU'RE NOT
[1:00:07] GOING TO TURN ON THE TAPES WHENEVER
[1:00:09] YOU'RE WHENEVER YOU'RE AT THE JOB SITE.
[1:00:11] YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TURN ON THE TAPES.
[1:00:12] BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY SATISFIED WITH IT,
[1:00:15] HALLELUJAH, THAT'S YOUR ENTERTAINMENT.
[1:00:17] IF YOU'RE REALLY SATISFIED WITH IT,
[1:00:19] THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FEAST UPON.
[1:00:21] NOT ON WHAT THIS ONE SAID OR WHAT THAT
[1:00:23] PREACHER SAID, BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT DID
[1:00:25] THE VOICE OF ALMIGHTY GOD SAY IN THIS
[1:00:28] GENERATION? Brother Brand, I'm going to
[1:00:30] say this here. We got our mind on too
[1:00:32] many things of the world. If we could
[1:00:34] throw those things off of our mind and
[1:00:37] think about him and his soon coming,
[1:00:40] there be more revelations and power in
[1:00:43] the church. Ain't that powerful that our
[1:00:46] thinking can keep revelations from
[1:00:49] striking our heart? Not don't keep
[1:00:52] revelations from coming, BUT IT KEEPS
[1:00:54] REVELATIONS FROM STRIKING THE HEART. AND
[1:00:56] HE SAYS, BUT WE KEEP thinking about
[1:00:59] things. What am I going TO DO TOMORROW?
[1:01:01] WHAT WILL I DO NEXT WEEK? WHILE WILL I
[1:01:03] HAVE MY JOB? WILL THIS BE? And this
[1:01:06] really spoke to my heart. Brother
[1:01:07] Brandham says this here. All those
[1:01:09] things are in THE HANDS OF GOD. THINK ON
[1:01:13] CHRIST. AIN'T THAT POWERFUL? WHY WORRY
[1:01:16] ABOUT IT WHEN GOD'S ALREADY GOT IT? JUST
[1:01:18] THINK ON HIM. SOMETIMES WE CROSS THE
[1:01:21] BRIDGE BEFORE WE EVER GET THERE. AND
[1:01:24] HERE CHRIST IS SAYING, "I'VE ALREADY GOT
[1:01:26] THE SOLUTION. I'VE ALREADY GOT THE
[1:01:28] ANSWER. QUIT THINKING ABOUT THAT." AND A
[1:01:31] HEAVINESS COMING OVER YOUR HEART AND
[1:01:33] THINK UPON MY WORD AND THAT WILL TAKE
[1:01:36] YOU THROUGH EVERY SITUATION.
[1:01:39] LET INSPIRATION STRIKE THAT HEART.
[1:01:43] HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:44] ALL THOSE THINGS ARE IN THE HANDS OF
[1:01:46] GOD. THANK CHRIST. RIGHT. Seek ye first
[1:01:50] the kingdom of God AND ALL OF THESE
[1:01:52] THINGS WILL BE ADDED UNTO YOU. You know,
[1:01:55] I heard I was at a youth camp one time
[1:01:57] and that brother was preaching on on on
[1:01:59] couples and he was like, you know, many
[1:02:02] people, young people are trying to find
[1:02:04] their spouse. They're trying to find
[1:02:05] their husband and their wife. He says,
[1:02:07] the Bible would say, "Seek you first the
[1:02:09] husband and all these things will be
[1:02:11] added unto you." He says, "No, seek ye
[1:02:13] first Christ, THEN ALL [screaming]
[1:02:16] OF THOSE THINGS WILL BE ADDED UNTO YOU."
[1:02:19] YOU SEE? SO, WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GETTING
[1:02:21] SO FAR AHEAD THAT, OH, I WONDER IF I'M
[1:02:23] GOING TO PAY THE LIGHT BILL. I WONDER IF
[1:02:25] THIS IS going to work out. I WONDER IF
[1:02:27] THAT'S GOING TO WORK OUT, BUT I'M
[1:02:29] THINKING UPON CHRIST, AND IF I'M DOING
[1:02:31] MY BEST, GOD HAS GOT EVERYTHING ELSE
[1:02:34] UNDER CONTROL. THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY
[1:02:37] ABOUT IT. HALLELUJAH. YOU REMEMBER
[1:02:38] WHENEVER THE TORNADO IT WAS THE BOMB THE
[1:02:41] bombs were coming down I believe in
[1:02:42] World War II I believe and here uh and
[1:02:45] hear that there was a grandmother and
[1:02:46] her grandchildren were in the house and
[1:02:48] THE THE SIRENS WERE GOING OFF SAYING YOU
[1:02:50] NEED TO GO GET TO THE BUNKERS AND
[1:02:52] GRANDMA WOULD GO AND GET INTO bed and
[1:02:54] and SHE WOULD LAY DOWN AND WOULD go to
[1:02:56] sleep and one OF THE CHILDREN WOULD SAY
[1:02:58] GRANDMA WHAT ARE YOU DOING WE NEED TO
[1:03:00] GET TO THE SHELTER SHE SAYS YOU KNOW MY
[1:03:02] BIBLE SAYS THAT MY GOD NEVER SLEEPS or
[1:03:04] slumbers so there's no need for both of
[1:03:06] us BEING AWAKE SO I'M GOING TO GO TO
[1:03:09] SLEEP. YOU KNOW, THERE IS A TRUTH BEHIND
[1:03:11] THAT STORY. THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY
[1:03:13] ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS. THINK ABOUT THE
[1:03:15] PROBLEM IF GOD ALREADY HAS THE SOLUTION
[1:03:18] AND THE AND THE ANSWER TO EVERY
[1:03:21] SITUATION. JUST THINK ON THESE THINGS.
[1:03:24] THINK ON THE WORD OF GOD. TURN ON A
[1:03:27] MESSAGE. TURN READ QUOTES AND AND YOUR
[1:03:30] BIBLE AND LET THAT MEDITATION BRING YOU
[1:03:33] INTO THE presence of God.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brown, I must say
[1:03:38] also that you might tell the people, be
[1:03:41] instructed on how to how to tell them to
[1:03:44] receive their healing and how to wait
[1:03:46] and to watch for the Lord. The Lord as
[1:03:48] you meditate upon him. He says that it
[1:03:51] takes meditation on the Lord to bring
[1:03:54] him into your presence. He says THAT'S
[1:03:57] RIGHT. ALWAYS IT'S WHILE WE'RE thinking
[1:03:59] on these things that Christ appears. And
[1:04:02] so while we're meditating on the things
[1:04:04] of God, it ushers us into his presence.
[1:04:07] Hallelujah. And I know you you can
[1:04:09] testify of it when you're in and and in
[1:04:12] your prayer closet or driving down the
[1:04:14] road or even even you know doing stuff
[1:04:16] around the house and as you're thinking
[1:04:18] upon the Lord all of a sudden you come
[1:04:20] into an atmosphere of prayer you know or
[1:04:22] you come into an atmosphere of believing
[1:04:24] or or an atmosphere of worship or
[1:04:26] whether you're meditating on the right
[1:04:28] things and that would usher you into the
[1:04:31] presence of God. And and so I believe
[1:04:34] that our words are going to portray what
[1:04:36] we're fellowshipping with. And you can
[1:04:38] look at Peter Matthew 26 and 73. After a
[1:04:43] while unto After a while came unto him,
[1:04:46] they that stood by and said to Peter,
[1:04:48] "Surely thou art one of them, for thy
[1:04:52] speech betrayeth thee." Then he then
[1:04:54] began heed to curse and to swear,
[1:04:56] saying, I know not the man. And
[1:04:59] immediately the crew A AND I
[1:05:02] THOUGHT it's it's it's incredible that
[1:05:04] here Peter could blend in. He could look
[1:05:07] like every all the other people until
[1:05:09] they started to speak and then his
[1:05:11] speech would betray who he was
[1:05:13] fellowshipping with. And it's incredible
[1:05:16] because his speech was declaring who he
[1:05:19] was with and then he would become
[1:05:21] ashamed of it. And I thought oh my then
[1:05:24] once he became ashamed he be to speak
[1:05:26] the devil's language. HOW COULD HE GO
[1:05:28] FROM ONE time speaking and them
[1:05:31] recognizing HE'S A DISCIPLE BECAUSE HE'S
[1:05:33] SPEAKING LIKE HIM to now he's cussing?
[1:05:36] What was it? He became ashamed of his
[1:05:39] positive words that he began to speak
[1:05:41] the devil's language. And you know what
[1:05:43] brother Brandon would say? He would say
[1:05:45] this here. Now it's a strange thing that
[1:05:47] this is so much thought of people. They
[1:05:49] say, "Well, I'm weak. My faith is not
[1:05:51] very much. I'm not a very good
[1:05:53] Christian." That's just what the devil
[1:05:55] wants you to say. You're just TALKING
[1:05:58] HIS LANGUAGE RIGHT THEN. MY SO YOU MAY
[1:06:01] NEVER CUSS A DAY IN YOUR LIFE. YOU MAY
[1:06:03] NEVER SAY A BAD WORD A DAY IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:06:05] BUT YOU can still speak the devil's
[1:06:07] language. Oh, I'm preaching NOW. JUST
[1:06:09] LIKE PETER, HE WAS SPEAKING GOD'S
[1:06:11] LANGUAGE until he became ashamed. Then
[1:06:14] his LANGUAGE WOULD CHANGE. I DON'T WANT
[1:06:16] TO BE ASHAMED of his WORDS OR BE ASHAMED
[1:06:18] of this message that I start to speak
[1:06:21] the devil's language, which is negative
[1:06:23] things, you see. But I believe that we
[1:06:26] can speak positive things. Brother
[1:06:28] Brandham would say, "Don't never let
[1:06:29] your testimony be negative. Let it be
[1:06:31] positive all the time." He would say in
[1:06:34] one place, "Let your testimony always,
[1:06:36] your thoughts, everything. Never permit
[1:06:38] a negative thought to come in your mind
[1:06:40] if you can help it." When it starts,
[1:06:42] don't entertain it. Well, you say, "I
[1:06:44] can't help the thoughts from coming."
[1:06:46] Well, that'll be like the farmer that
[1:06:48] said he couldn't stop he couldn't stop
[1:06:49] the birds from flying over his place,
[1:06:51] but he could sure stop them from
[1:06:54] roosting. Brother Brown, he was say,
[1:06:56] "DON'T ENTERTAIN IT." WHAT WHAT WHAT'S
[1:06:57] IT mean to entertain something? To make
[1:06:59] you feel welcome, right? Whenever you
[1:07:01] ask somebody to come over your house to
[1:07:02] eat, you It's called entertaining them.
[1:07:05] Why? You don't want to just invite them,
[1:07:07] but you want them to feel welcome,
[1:07:09] right? And so, Brother Brandham says,
[1:07:10] "Don't entertain the negative thoughts.
[1:07:13] You can't keep him from coming in or
[1:07:15] coming over, but don't make him feel
[1:07:17] welcome. Oh, hallelujah. Don't make him
[1:07:20] feel welcome. YOU SEE, MY HOUSE DOES NOT
[1:07:23] HAVE to be under a negative confession.
[1:07:25] It may come against it, but I don't got
[1:07:27] to entertain it, right? You brother
[1:07:30] would say that that that if you don't
[1:07:31] got confidence in your doctor, you
[1:07:33] better get a different doctor, right?
[1:07:35] Because you're not going to take his
[1:07:36] prescription because you got no
[1:07:37] confidence in him, right? So if if
[1:07:40] somebody's constantly tearing down the
[1:07:42] doctor, you're really NOT GOING TO HAVE
[1:07:44] NO CONFIDENCE IN HIM. SO NEGATIVE
[1:07:46] THOUGHTS ARE TRYING to destroy the
[1:07:48] influence of the word. And when you're
[1:07:50] entertaining them, what it's doing, it's
[1:07:53] taking away THE ASSURANCE TO FIX
[1:07:55] PROBLEMS. IT'S TAKING AWAY THE assurance
[1:07:58] to fix things in OUR LIFE. SO INSTEAD OF
[1:08:01] ENTERTAINING THEM, I say let them keep
[1:08:03] on going by, right? THEY THE CAT CAN
[1:08:06] SCRATCH OUT THE DOOR, BUT we're not
[1:08:08] going to open the door. Right. I heard I
[1:08:10] heard a story one time and I know the
[1:08:11] pullpit ain't meant for joking, but I
[1:08:13] heard a story one time that some
[1:08:15] Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on the door,
[1:08:17] right? And a man opened the door and
[1:08:18] says, "Come on in." And he says, "WHAT
[1:08:20] DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?" AND THEY
[1:08:22] SAYS, "I DON'T KNOW. WE NEVER MADE IT
[1:08:23] THIS FAR BEFORE." THAT NOBODY'S EVER
[1:08:25] OPENED THE DOOR. SO, they never had
[1:08:27] anything TO SAY. YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT
[1:08:29] HAPPENS WHEN NEGATIVE THOUGHTS COME.
[1:08:31] THEY'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY WHEN YOU
[1:08:33] DON'T ENTERTAIN THEM. COME ON NOW. THEY
[1:08:36] CAN KNOCK ON THE DOOR, BUT DON'T OPEN
[1:08:37] THE DOOR. I'M HAVING A BAD DAY. YEAH,
[1:08:40] [screaming] EVERYBODY ELSE IS, TOO.
[1:08:41] DON'T SPEAK THE DEVIL'S LANGUAGE. WELL,
[1:08:43] THIS IS GOING ON. YEAH, HAVE YOU SEEN
[1:08:45] THE WORLD? DON'T SPEAK THE DEVIL'S
[1:08:47] LANGUAGE, BUT SPEAK THE PROMISES OF GOD.
[1:08:50] I HAD A BAD DAY, BUT HIS GRACE IS
[1:08:53] SUFFICIENT. I WENT THROUGH SOME HARD
[1:08:55] TIMES, BUT HE'S NEVER GOING TO LEAVE ME.
[1:08:57] He's never going TO FORSAKE ME. MY BODY
[1:08:59] MIGHT BE ACHING, BUT GREATER IS HE THAT
[1:09:01] IS IN ME IN THE MIDST of a deceitful
[1:09:04] AGE. I'M GOING TO SPEAK A POSITIVE
[1:09:07] CONFESSION. AND I'M NOT ASHAMED OF IT.
[1:09:10] I'M NOT ASHAMED OF IT BECAUSE IT'S EASY
[1:09:13] AND I'VE been there before. It's easy to
[1:09:15] get dragged into something, RIGHT?
[1:09:17] WHENEVER SOMEBODY'S talking about
[1:09:19] something, it's sometimes it's
[1:09:20] embarrassing to say the contrary, right?
[1:09:23] How many's ever been there when
[1:09:25] somebody's speaking about somebody AND
[1:09:26] AND YOU KNOW IT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE, IT
[1:09:29] MIGHT NOT BE IT MIGHT BE A LIE, BUT
[1:09:31] YOU'RE EMBARRASSED TO SAY, "HEY, that
[1:09:33] ain't true." SO SOMETIMES YOU JUST FALL
[1:09:35] INTO THAT SAME CONVERSATION. And it's
[1:09:37] easy to do THAT MANY TIMES IN A NEGATIVE
[1:09:40] WORLD. It's easy to get into that. I had
[1:09:43] a bad day. Oh yeah, me too. This went
[1:09:45] wrong. That went wrong. Man, you're not
[1:09:47] going to believe what happened to work.
[1:09:48] And what it is, YOU'RE EMBARRASSED TO
[1:09:50] SPEAK THE PROMISES OF GOD BECAUSE YOU
[1:09:53] JUST WANT TO FIT IN WITH THAT
[1:09:54] ATMOSPHERE. OH, BUT THEY THAT ARE NOT
[1:09:57] ASHAMED OF ME, I WILL NOT BE ASHAMED OF
[1:10:00] THEM. HALLELUJAH. Brother Brand, I'm
[1:10:02] going to say this here. God let God let
[1:10:04] you think on things. Study about it.
[1:10:07] It's what you come to church for. He
[1:10:09] says, if there's if there be any praise,
[1:10:11] any virtue, think on these things. He
[1:10:14] says, "What are you thinking about
[1:10:15] tonight? Maybe I won't get healed. if I
[1:10:18] I'll go back home, you you'll get what
[1:10:20] you're thinking about. He says, HAVE
[1:10:22] DETERMINED IN YOUR HEART THAT GOD WILL
[1:10:25] DO IT and God will do it. Don't pack
[1:10:28] your sin back home. DON'T PACK YOUR
[1:10:30] UNBELIEF back home. Don't pack your
[1:10:32] disease like the man here last night in
[1:10:34] the wheelchair and the different ones.
[1:10:36] You don't have to pack it back home. God
[1:10:39] will take it out of you. Ain't that
[1:10:41] powerful? We don't got to pack our
[1:10:43] TROUBLES BACK HOME. OH, HALLELUJAH. HE
[1:10:46] GOES, "WE COME TO CHURCH. WE COME TO
[1:10:48] CHURCH to get away from our troubles."
[1:10:50] And and I'm just preaching tonight. I
[1:10:52] hope this is okay. But we don't want to
[1:10:54] pack our troubles back home. He said, "I
[1:10:56] DON'T COME I DON'T COME TO CHURCH to to
[1:10:58] get discouraged." You [laughter]
[1:11:01] I don't come to church to to get to get
[1:11:04] beat down and where I don't feel like
[1:11:05] I'm a Christian. I come to church to get
[1:11:08] lifted up.
[1:11:09] HOW COME THE church where God can come
[1:11:11] and whisper and say, "I know you had a
[1:11:13] bad day, but I'm a friend that's going
[1:11:14] to stick closer than a brother." And you
[1:11:16] COME IN THE CHURCH PACKING SOMETHING,
[1:11:18] BUT when you leave, you leave that
[1:11:20] baggage there. Hallelujah. Because we're
[1:11:22] thinking on somebody. Brother Brandham
[1:11:24] would say in one in one place, don't let
[1:11:26] it anchor. And here and as I'm bringing
[1:11:28] this down to a close, brother Brandham
[1:11:30] would in questions and answers, a lady
[1:11:33] would ask brother Brandham, he would
[1:11:35] what shall we do? Something has settled.
[1:11:37] He would something settled over me. He
[1:11:39] said, she would say, "It's a heaviness
[1:11:40] that is over my heart." And I would have
[1:11:42] a dream and I'm walking on on white
[1:11:44] sands and would go through details of
[1:11:46] this dream and and would say that that
[1:11:48] that that my my uh uh my my uh son and
[1:11:51] his wife is coming under a heaviness.
[1:11:53] And brother Brown, he would read this
[1:11:56] and he would come down and would answer
[1:11:58] and say, "Lady, I feel like I feel like
[1:12:00] the problem of it here's your trouble."
[1:12:03] He says, "You let something in your past
[1:12:06] trouble you." And he would say, "Now
[1:12:08] that's made you nervous." And he would
[1:12:10] say, "Now the nervousness has went from
[1:12:12] your son. It's went from the family,
[1:12:14] this family member to that family member
[1:12:16] to this family member." And he would
[1:12:18] come down and he and he's and he's
[1:12:19] nailing this. And he stops and he would
[1:12:22] say, "I think the problem OF HE SAYS,
[1:12:24] "YOUR problem is you're thinking on the
[1:12:26] wrong things." And he would stop and was
[1:12:28] say, "Well, I don't got time to go into
[1:12:29] all of it." He says, "I can keep on
[1:12:30] going." He says, "I've got another
[1:12:32] question to answer." And I thought, "Oh
[1:12:34] my, here something in the past she kept
[1:12:38] thinking on, dwelling upon and
[1:12:40] thinking." She thought she was going
[1:12:41] crazy. Brother Brandham says, "No,
[1:12:42] nothing's wrong with you. Your trouble
[1:12:44] is you're thinking on something on the
[1:12:46] wrong things. Something that happened in
[1:12:49] the past, you keep dwelling upon." And
[1:12:51] that was bringing on a nervous spirit.
[1:12:54] And I think we got a future that is
[1:12:56] greater than our past.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; There's no need to keep looking back.
[1:13:00] That one done me wrong. This one done me
[1:13:01] wrong. We've all been DONE WRONG. BUT
[1:13:03] GOD MADE THE WRONGS RIGHT. GOD HAS GIVEN
[1:13:06] US A PROMISE OF A RAPTURE. GOD HAS GIVEN
[1:13:08] US A PROMISE OF A OF A THEOPHONY. AND
[1:13:11] THERE'S NO NEED TO keep on being bogged
[1:13:13] down behind us. You as brother Brandham
[1:13:16] said, don't let it anchor. You know,
[1:13:17] those thoughts come through. Don't let
[1:13:19] it anchor. What does an anchor do? It
[1:13:20] stops you. Right? Whenever you're in a
[1:13:22] boat, it can have the biggest motor on
[1:13:24] it, but what happens whenever you want
[1:13:25] to come to a stop? You set out the
[1:13:27] anchor. Too many times we set out
[1:13:29] anchors of hard feelings and and anchors
[1:13:31] of this and that and we're thinking upon
[1:13:33] it. But you know what they do when they
[1:13:35] let the anchor loose? Normally they let
[1:13:37] it go. They let that whole anchor go cuz
[1:13:39] they don't want to bring it with them.
[1:13:40] And I think that's what we need to start
[1:13:42] doing is all the troubles in the past,
[1:13:44] all the hurt feelings, all the
[1:13:46] bitterness, I'm not going to think on
[1:13:48] those things, but I'm going to let them
[1:13:50] go. Are you letting them go this
[1:13:51] evening? And say, Lord, I'm going to
[1:13:53] think on the right things because I want
[1:13:56] to be closer to God. I know that's your
[1:13:58] I know that's that's your attitude. I
[1:14:00] want to be closer to God. There's no
[1:14:01] need to be in a rut of just going in
[1:14:03] circles and circles, but but I want to
[1:14:06] speak the promises of God in my life and
[1:14:08] and watch them come into manifestation.
[1:14:11] David would say in Psalms 119 and 14, so
[1:14:14] shall I keep thy law continually
[1:14:16] forever, and I will walk at liberty, for
[1:14:19] I seek thy precepts. I will speak of thy
[1:14:22] testimonies also before kings and will
[1:14:25] not be ashamed. Let our musicians come
[1:14:28] this evening. I will speak thy
[1:14:30] testimonies before kings and will not be
[1:14:33] ashamed. You may say, "I'm never going
[1:14:36] to stand before a king. I'll never stand
[1:14:37] before a prince." But yet, there's kings
[1:14:40] that of hard feelings and kings of
[1:14:42] loneliness and negativity that we don't
[1:14:45] have to be ashamed to speak in front of
[1:14:47] and say, "Hey, no more in my life." And
[1:14:50] and what's incredible is is there was a
[1:14:53] lady of the Bible would say a certain
[1:14:55] woman in the book of Judges and I know
[1:14:58] it's been quoted a lot but the Bible
[1:15:01] says that there was a certain woman that
[1:15:02] there was a king that was invading your
[1:15:04] land and and how this king was wiping
[1:15:06] out the military. It wiped out it wiped
[1:15:09] out all of the men. And there was some
[1:15:11] people that would go into a tower. And
[1:15:14] the Bible would say that this invading
[1:15:16] army would come, the king would come to
[1:15:18] that door, knock the door down, would go
[1:15:20] into the tower and kill everybody in
[1:15:22] that tower. But there was a certain
[1:15:24] woman that would go into a strong tower.
[1:15:27] Wasn't just a tower. It was a strong
[1:15:29] tower. And the Bible says that that
[1:15:31] invading king would come and would beat
[1:15:34] on the door. beat on the door but could
[1:15:36] not get into that tower because he
[1:15:38] couldn't get through the door. And
[1:15:40] Christ would say, "I am the door." You
[1:15:42] know, and here the Bible would say that
[1:15:45] this the certain woman, a faith woman
[1:15:47] would look out of the tower and would
[1:15:50] grab a piece of a millstone. She didn't
[1:15:52] have the whole millstone. She just had a
[1:15:54] piece of it. And she would throw that
[1:15:56] millstone down and would destroy that
[1:15:58] king. Am that's the way the promises of
[1:16:01] God are. the Bible or brother Brown say
[1:16:03] what is confessions it's stones [music]
[1:16:06] right and so you might not be able to
[1:16:08] quote the whole Bible you might not be
[1:16:10] able to quote all the message but you
[1:16:12] can take a piece of it and that
[1:16:14] confession is a stone just like David
[1:16:17] would say you come against me with sword
[1:16:20] with spear but I come in the name of the
[1:16:21] Lord he wasn't ashamed of it and he
[1:16:23] would send a stone that would bring that
[1:16:25] giant down before [music] him and I
[1:16:27] believe our confessions are stones and
[1:16:30] we're not ashamed of them and Brother
[1:16:32] Brown would say, "What does confession
[1:16:33] mean?" He said, "What what does confess?
[1:16:35] What is really confession?" He says,
[1:16:37] "Confession means to say the [music]
[1:16:39] same thing." Hallelujah. He would say
[1:16:41] right before that, he would say that
[1:16:43] that the prophets of old was not ashamed
[1:16:46] to speak before kings, the he says the
[1:16:48] priests, he says because they were they
[1:16:51] had directly thus saith the Lord. So
[1:16:53] [music] that's why they're not ashamed.
[1:16:55] And if we're and if confession means to
[1:16:58] say the same thing. We're speaking thus
[1:17:00] sayaith the Lord. That's why we're not
[1:17:02] ashamed. And that's why Jesus would
[1:17:05] would be so confident that you don't
[1:17:08] have to be ashamed. If you're not
[1:17:10] ashamed of me, I'm not going to be
[1:17:12] ashamed of you because you're going to
[1:17:14] have thus sayaith the Lord. Think no
[1:17:16] thought of what I shall say. But in the
[1:17:19] time when when it needs to be said, I'll
[1:17:21] give you the words to say. What is it?
[1:17:23] And I believe God has given us the words
[1:17:25] to say. What is it, John? Take the book.
[1:17:27] Eat the book. prophesy again, right? He
[1:17:30] ate the book and what he was
[1:17:32] fellowshipping on, he began to speak and
[1:17:35] I believe which is a type of the bride.
[1:17:37] We're fellowshipping upon the positive
[1:17:39] word of the hour and we're prophesying
[1:17:42] again. We're speaking the same things
[1:17:44] and the same miracles I believe that
[1:17:46] happened when brother Brandon was upon
[1:17:48] the earth can happen now. Come on now. I
[1:17:51] believe devils are still subject.
[1:17:53] Spirits are still subject. I believe
[1:17:55] tormenting devils that try to take over
[1:17:58] minds and and bodies and emotions are
[1:18:01] still subject to the name of Jesus. But
[1:18:03] it takes somebody who's not ashamed of
[1:18:05] it. Who's not ashamed to get down and
[1:18:08] say, "Lord, I'm taking you at your word.
[1:18:10] No matter what, no matter if it's me
[1:18:12] against the world, against the against
[1:18:15] everybody, I'm going to take the word of
[1:18:17] the Lord in every situation. I'm going
[1:18:20] to take control of the atmosphere in my
[1:18:22] home, the atmosphere in my house, my
[1:18:25] family. I'm not ashamed of it. Amen. Can
[1:18:28] we bow our heads here this evening?
[1:18:31] Dear gracious heavenly father,
[1:18:35] Lord, we love you here tonight.
[1:18:40] Lord, as we feel your presence [music]
[1:18:41] here among us,
[1:18:43] Lord, I know there's not many here
[1:18:45] tonight, Father,
[1:18:48] but Lord, thank you for honoring us with
[1:18:51] your presence.
[1:18:55] Lord, it's so easy to get bogged down in
[1:18:57] the negative, Lord. It's a negative
[1:18:59] world,
[1:19:01] Lord. Nobody has a good day anymore.
[1:19:05] But God, you've given us a positive
[1:19:07] word.
[1:19:09] Lord, you've given us some stones that
[1:19:11] we can speak. And
[1:19:13] Lord,
[1:19:15] you sent us a mason
[1:19:17] that can build up the stones.
[1:19:20] Show us where the stones [music] go.
[1:19:21] Lord, we're not just babbling words, but
[1:19:24] we've come under an inspiration,
[1:19:27] and it's an inspired word.
[1:19:30] That's why we can have such an
[1:19:31] assurance. [music] Lord,
[1:19:34] this is a living word that can inspire
[1:19:36] our hearts. And as we speak it, we know
[1:19:39] it's thus [music] sayaith the Lord.
[1:19:41] Lord, and if there's some here tonight
[1:19:45] that might be under the clouds of
[1:19:46] heaviness, [music]
[1:19:48] under the clouds of negativity, Lord,
[1:19:52] may they begin to think on positive
[1:19:53] things. [music]
[1:19:55] So, so a positive voice can speak out of
[1:19:58] their life.
[1:19:59] Lord, we want a positive faith. Lord,
[1:20:02] how I hope so, but Lord, we're eagles.
[1:20:05] We believe.
[1:20:07] Lord, we love you and we ask that you'd
[1:20:09] be with us here tonight in Jesus name.
[1:20:13] Amen.
[1:20:18] Can we sing that tonight, brother Corby?
[1:20:26] If you just keep your mind. Can we stand
[1:20:29] and sing [music] this tonight
[1:20:31] on me? [singing]
[1:20:33] Oh, keep
[1:20:36] your mind.
[1:20:44] [music]

[1:21:44] your mind stay

[1:22:01] [music]
[1:22:03] faithfully. [singing]
[1:22:07] Oh, and I
[1:22:09] will [singing] give
[1:22:11] you perfect
[1:22:14] peace,

[1:23:01] I've been walking through this valley,
[1:23:05] through this bell [music] of tears,
[1:23:07] [singing]
[1:23:09] and times I've even questioned. Even if
[1:23:14] my Lord was near. [music and singing]
[1:23:16] And at times that old tempter says, "Why
[1:23:20] not turn around? [singing]
[1:23:23] You can't [music] get any further.
[1:23:27] You're just [singing] losing ground."

[1:24:03] there's been something bothering me?
[1:24:06] Why is it that old devil? [music]
[1:24:11] Let God's children [singing]
[1:24:12] be. You see, he has purpose and [music]
[1:24:16] determined
[1:24:17] to get right in the way
[1:24:21] and turn us from the way
[1:24:23] [music and singing] of life and turn our
[1:24:26] souls astray. But I'm not giving up. Is

[1:25:11] [music] you in some way. It was good to
[1:25:13] good to be in the house of the Lord
[1:25:14] tonight once again. Good to see brother
[1:25:16] Joe and Sister Stephanie. So good to see
[1:25:18] y'all. And
[1:25:21] are y'all here for a couple of days?
[1:25:23] Well, I mean good to see y'all again.
[1:25:25] Hopefully we get to fellowship a little
[1:25:27] bit maybe after service or something.
[1:25:29] But it was good to see y'all. And
[1:25:30] remember to keep Sister Stacia in
[1:25:32] prayer. I hadn't heard anything as as
[1:25:34] she had the baby yet at [music] an

[1:25:39] and Patrick, of course, he has the hard

[1:25:47] prayer that the Lord will keep mama and
[1:25:50] the baby safe there. Let's bow our heads

[1:26:05] but may we entertain your spirit,
[1:26:07] Father. God, may we dwell on the right
[1:26:10] things, on the right thoughts, Father.
[1:26:12] God, we ask that you would be with
[1:26:14] Sister [music] Staca, Brother Patrick,
