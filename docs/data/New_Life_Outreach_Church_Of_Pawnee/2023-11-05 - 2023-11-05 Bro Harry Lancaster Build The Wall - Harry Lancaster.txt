been in your presence Lord and that we've heard from you Lord we just we love you Lord Jesus and we just commit the service into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen all right let's go ahead and turn to Isaiah chapter 62 it's good to see everybody here on Sunday morning we're missing a a few but seems like we're starting to get back up to almost full again starting to get everybody back from their various trips so Isaiah chapter 62 we'll start at verse 6 I have set Watchmen upon thy walls oh Jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day nor night ye that make mention of the Lord keep not silence and give him no rest till he establish until he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth now let's turn to Jude chapter 1 and starting at verse three beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ you all may have your seats brother random said in the sermon the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he says but now Jude told us to contend for the faith the faith not a faith the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now there's only one sensible way to do that isn't it friends that's to go right back and find out what kind of Faith they had and then when we find what kind of Faith they had then earnestly contend for that brother Wendell's been preaching the last several sermons on the god- called preacher and Wednesday as he was uh ministering and talking about Watchmen on the walls I began to think a little bit about uh for some reason the the the history of Nehemiah began to to come into my mind and so I started going back and reading through that again and so let's go ahead and turn to Nehemiah chapter 1 Nehemiah chapter 1 and we'll start at verse one the words of Nehemiah the son of hakal and it came to pass in the month chisu in the 20th year as I was in shushan the palace that Hannah and I one of my brethren came he and certain men of Judah and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped which were left of the Captivity and concerning Jerusalem and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the Captivity there in the province are in great Affliction and reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of Heaven the city of Jerusalem when you go back through the history had been a hold out until the time of David it had been occupied by the jebusites The Tribe of Benjamin Had failed to drive them out and allowed the enemy to live in their midst and because the city was not owned by any of the tribes of Israel it was a perfect location to represent the united nation of is Israel as David was coming in as king it was one of the reasons that he went after the city was because of its location and because that he was not going to be saying that hey this tribe is a little bit better than anyone else because this is where I'm putting my Capital he took the city that no one had a claim to and went okay now this is going to be the Royal City this is going to be the place that we take we're going to take this city which as we know uh brother Brandon brought out and talked about the fact that Jerusalem means the city of peace and so David came in and takes the city of Jerusalem and establishes that and from that time on that was where the the ruling of of the United Israel and then of Judah happened was in Jerusalem this was this was where uh the heart of the land basically was um and this was the city of Peace but as Israel went down and they continued to to reject God over time and eventually it came to the time that the city was going to be destroyed because they were going to be driven out they were going to be taken away we turn to 2 Kings chapter 24 and starting at verse 10 it says at that time the Servants of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came up against Jerusalem and the city was besieged and Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came against the city and his servants did besiege it and jein the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon he and his mother and his servants and his princes and his officers and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his Reign and he carried out then all the Treasures of the house of the Lord and the Treasures of the King's house and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord as the Lord had said and he carried away all Jerusalem and all the princes and all the Mighty Men of Valor even 10 10,000 captives and all the Craftsmen and Smiths none remained save the poorest sword of the people of the land and he carried away jein to Babylon and the King's mother and the King's wives and his officers and the mighty of the land those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon and all the men of might even 7,000 and Craftsmen and Smiths a thousand and all that were strong and apt for war even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon in Jeremiah 29:1 it says for thus sayeth the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you and causing you to return to this place so according to history it was 586 BC when Jerusalem was destroyed and the temple was burned and for 70 years they were gone from the land for 70 years they were in captivity in 516 BC according to history Israelites began to return we find this uh recounted in in Ezra if we turn to Ezra chapter 1 Ezra chapter 1 and just starting at verse one it says now in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia the that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying thus saith Cyrus King of Persia the Lord God Of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me to build him in House at Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there among you of all his people his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build the house of the Lord God of Israel he is the god which which is in Jerusalem and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with Beast beside the Free Will offering for the house of God that is in isra that is in Jerusalem then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin the priests and the Levites with all of them whose Spirit God had raised to go up and to build the house of Israel which is in Jerusalem and so in in 5:116 BC they go back and the temple is rebuilt and it's rededicated and so it was exactly as Jeremiah propes it was 70 years that the temple was destroyed and they were gone but then they return and they rebuild the Temple and they've come in with the mind to work to go okay we're going to we're going to restore things we're going to rebuild we're going to bring things back to way that they should and then in Ezra chter 4 and verse 11 said this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him even unto erses the king thy servants the men on this side of the river and at such time be it known unto the king that the Jews which came up from thee to us are com into Jerusalem building the rebellious and the bad City and have set up the walls thereof and join the foundations be it known now unto the king that if this city be buil and the walls set up again that they will not pay toll tribute and custom and so Thou shalt end damage the revenue of the king now because we have maintenance from the king's Palace and it was not meat for us to see the king's dishonor there we have we sent and certify the king that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the books of the records and know that this city is a rebellious City and hurtful unto Kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition Within the same of old time for which cause was this city destroyed let's drop down to verse 24 then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem so it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius King of Persia the people came in with a mind to rebuild not just the temple but Jerusalem and they rebuilt the temple they got it dedicated and then they turned to begin working on the walls now during this time the walls of a city was really the main defense normally there weren't huge armies in most of these countries because they didn't have the revenue to manage huge armies in fact a lot of those that were in the military would still have their own Farm they would still have their own land that they had to go and care for and so you can actually find historically that normally there was a raiding season which was when these men didn't have to be working their own farms and that was when you would go raid against the enemy but then when it was time for planting when it was getting time for Preparation they would go back and the Army would split back up across their own Homeland as they each man went to his own land his own Farm to work the Army wasn't always standing it wasn't always ready they could be called back up if necessary but they had their own land to take care of that was one of the ways that they were provided for and the King didn't have to worry about having quite as much finances because each one had his own land to provide the food that they needed and so raiding season was when you would be so worried about okay where are the armies are they coming this way do we have our own defenses but because you often didn't have huge armies around and you who knew how long it would take for communication to get anywhere to know that an army was even coming the place of safety was behind the walls and so having a place like the temple which had all these gold and artifacts and precious things that would be a great attraction to the Raiders the walls would be there to provide the security the walls would be there to provide the protection they would be there to keep you safe until the Army got tired and left or until you could get a message out to get your own Army to come to wherever you were at and so it would be very normal to hey we've come to rebuild the Temple the next step is rebuild the walls but yet the enemy was able to to step in and go no that that's that's not going to happen and so from the time that the temple was rebuilt and dedicated 61 years pass 61 years pass within the book of Ezra until finally Ezra himself gets ready to go to Jerusalem it's in 455 BC that Ezra leads a small group of 1500 men and their families to Jerusalem let's turn to Ezra chapter 7 Ezra chapter 7 and we'll start at verse 11 now this is the copy of the letter that the king erses gave unto Ezra the priest The Scribe even a scribe of the words of the Commandment of the Lord and of his statutes to Israel erses King of Kings unto Ezra the priest a scribe of the law of the god of Heaven perfect peace and at such a time I make a decree that all the that all they of the people of Israel and of his priests and Levites in my realm which are minded of their own free will to go up to Jerusalem go with thee for as much as Thou Art sent of the king and of his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the the law of thy God which is in thine hand and to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have freely offered unto the god of Israel whose habitation is in Jerusalem and all the silver and gold that thou cast find in all the province of Babylon with the Free Will offering of the people and of the priests offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem that thou mayest buy speedily with this money Bullocks Rams Lambs with their meat offerings and their drink offerings and offer them upon the altar of the House of your God which is in Jerusalem and whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy Brethren to do with the rest of the silver and gold that they that do after the will of your God the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the House of thy God those deliver thou before the god of Jerusalem and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God which Thou shalt have occasion to bestow bestow it out of the King's treasur house and so Ezra returns he leads this small group the temple has been there for for 61 years and when Ezra comes he finds some problems that needs to be straightened out and so once again the focus is on the temple and nothing happens with the walls so think about what this would have been like for those that are living in Jerusalem the people that are there the temple has been restored we have the worship we've had uh you know an inspired inspired men that came in that began to get things started Ezra comes in to help fix some things get things beginning to line up even more the way that they should be but yet they could didn't have a true feeling of peace or safety because they had no walls they had no protection imagine now for you know one of the the fathers getting up and going about his his Daily Business he could have been a a shopkeeper he could have been a Craftsman maybe he had a small plot of Farmland outside the the Broken Walls that he farmed who knows what it was but every day when he would get up up to to go about providing for his family he would see the Broken Walls and and the burned Gates every time every Sabbath when he would take his family to worship he would see the walls crumbling and cracked and see the big holes and the gaps he would see those Gates that were either just gone or charred and hanging off one hinge or or these different things he and even as they would enter into the temple to worship there would be that nagging thought in their back of their mind is this really mattering the enemy can walk right in at any time you know these were not when you look at the people that were being called to go back to Jerusalem a lot of them were falling in the priesthood a lot of them were falling into into these kind of lines these were not soldiers and Warriors and well-trained Fighters these were not men that were going oh we don't need a wall we can fight them off ourselves these were men that were going in and they felt called to do this and they had succeeded in getting the temple back they had succeeded in restoring worship the process was starting but yet even though they had restored worship they did not have their peace they did not have that sense of safety they did not have that that sense of protection that was there they had begun to worship they had begun to enter back in but can't you just see the enemy every time they would go in on the Sabbath to worship just putting in their mind what if a rating party comes in while we're here what if a raiding party attacks my family while I'm off at work what if a raiding party does this or does that there's no safety there's no peace just like the enemy likes to play in our minds today to try to get you to things but here they're going and it's everything is in the Physical Realm they go look I can see there's no safety I can see there's nothing to protect us here I can see we are in a weakened position we've begun the process we we have our worship back we've begun to set things in order we've begun to move the right direction but yet where is the protection where is the safety because the enemy stopped us we were about to work on the walls we were starting the process and the enemy was able to prevent us from building the walls and there are these men that are living there that they came to Jerusalem with the best of intentions they felt led they felt inspired they felt like this is where God was taking them to be they had done their part to put in the work to rebuild the Temple they had done their part to be part of this community and and begin to reestablish things but yet day after day they're walking through and they see the walls crumbling around them day after day they're going through and they're just feeling everything that the enemy is throwing at them everything going on in their mind everything that's going on and they're hearing stories about the governors that are around them and what kind of men these are and what kind of things they might be saying and it's as all this is going along you know um brother brand says in the sermon pardon he says God hates a powerless religion it's got to be power certainly it's a power to save man from sin it's a power that can do signs and wonders and miracles as Jesus Christ promised they zeroed in on the word of God back there and believed it and hit the target you zero the same way on the word of God it'll hit the target again it's got to because he's the same yesterday today and forever God don't like a powerless religion God doesn't want that God wants to perform God wants to show himself alive our very hope is the resurrection is that right our hopes of life is Resurrection the resurrection of Jesus Christ as the faithful would go to Worship in the temple that they had helped to rebuild I can just see the devil doing his best to put the fear in their mind to do his best to point out everything that hadn't been done everything that was preventing them from actually having the peace that Jerusalem was supposed to be providing it was just that that little nagging fear in their back of their mind that all of this was for not everything we had done was worthless in the end it didn't matter and Ezra had led that small group of men over and nine more years pass Jerusalem was destroyed and 70 years later the next Temple was built and dedicated and then 70 more years pass a total of 70 years past with the walls still broken around them they've been worshiping they've been doing their best with what they have but yet they're still looked down upon by everyone around them because they don't have a place of safety anyone can walk in at any time and do whatever they want cuz these are not trained soldiers these are not people that are ready to to fight in every moment they're just men that felt led and the walls are still crumbling and I'm sure there were lots of them there were would sit there and there were probably been some of them that had been part of as they began to work on the walls and then got stopped and they would look over and go that was the last brick I laid I can still see it sitting there and we haven't been able to go any further we haven't been able to make any more progress as brother Wendell has been preaching about the Watchman on the wall as I said it made me think of of Nehemiah and so here's Nehemiah Maya and he finally hears the story he finally hears what's going on in Jerusalem and it immediately breaks his heart now obviously he knows one man by himself he cannot go in and physically rebuild every wall and every gate on his own that's not possible physically it cannot be done by a single man but yet he has the inspiration that okay this is a work that needs to be done and I'm close enough to the king to make the request for it brother brandom says in the sermon the way to have Fellowship he said there's only two faculties that govern a human one of them is Faith which brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it all faith is of God fear is of the devil fear Makes You Weary fear makes you wonder if I was and if I was going to die in the morning what good would it do me to get all stewed up about it what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning and my life to end tomorrow morning what good would that do me to worry about it well you say what good would it do to have faith faith can sign my pardon sure there's value in faith don't be weary don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe and the only way you can have faith you have to have love first for love produces faith for perfect love get it perfect love casts out all fear the people that were in Jerusalem were fighting with the fear because all the evidence around them showed that they had a reason to fear yes we had the temple we can we can worship like we're supposed to but there's no safety we don't know what's coming next we don't know what's coming around the corner and we're still in the Old Testament time there is no Holy Spirit coming in there is no different things he like we're just doing our best with the blood of bulls and goats but everything I look around in the physical world there is no peace there is no safety there is no protection Nehemiah is the one that's coming in that he has the faith because he has the ear of the king he has the opportunity to speak out he has the opportunity to make a request and so we all know the story that Nehemiah is able to be excused he's able to be given uh if I remember correctly a 12year vacation to go off and do this and so we're going to jump in at Nehemiah chapter 2 and verse 9 then I came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the king's letters now the king had sent captains of the army and Horsemen with me when s s balot the horonite and tobah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel so I came to Jerusalem and was there three days and I arose in the night and I and some few men with me neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem neither was there any be Beast with me save the Beast that I rode upon I went out by Night by the gates of the valley even before the dragon well and to the dung port and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire then I went on to the gates of the fountain and to the king's pool but there was no place for the Beast that was under me to pass then went I up in the Night by the Brook and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned and the rulers knew not whether I went or what I did neither had I as yet told it to the Jews nor to the priests nor to the Nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work brother brandom says in the sermon expectation he says now brother let's get Plum back off his ter territory let's come back to God come back to the altar rebuild the altar again that's been torn down build up your home take them cards off the table and all of them old love story magazines and open up the Bible and read the Bible and pray just don't get down and say bless my family and Mary and Joe and John and all of them get in the bed no sir stay there with God oh my and so Nehemiah came and at first he just looked everything over first he was just he didn't come in and just immediately go we're doing this he's like no I need to get a accurate report of what is actually needs to be done I need to look it over for myself I need to take the time to know for sure and not just coming yes I heard a report that all this is the state of it but I need to examine it for myself s see how bad is it really how good maybe some spots are I need to see where does the work actually need to be done as brother Wendell's been preaching on the Watchmen upon the wall and it said in Isaiah that we read at the beginning that I've set those Watchmen upon thy walls which shall never hold their peace day or night that they make mention of the Lord keep not silence and give him no rest till he established until he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth Nehemiah came in as the Watchman at this time he was the one that was looking for what needed to be done he was looking for what was the problems what were needed to be addressed what needed to be dealt with but the Watchman wasn't the one that was going to do every bit of the work just like today when we talk about the Watchman whether it's the the minister preaching whether it's a parent in the home the Watchman isn't one that does all the work now the Watchman can do some as parents we're in there working on our families but yet even in those situations we're trying to train our children to do certain things we're training them to be able to step up on their own they don't get to walk in on on our Salvation we're trying to show them the path we're trying to show them how to do it we're calling out the warning to them and the ministry the same way as the minister speaks to the congregation and cries out addresses the issues points out what needs to be done he's not the one coming in and going hey I'm going to completely handle the situation in your life for you but he is the one calling out hey here's a warning the enemy is coming in hey here's a warning this is the weak spot that needs to be built up hey here's the place the wall needs to be taken care of but yet it wasn't the watchman's job to be the one to actually build it the mman is the one that keeps calling out the Watchman is the one that keeps sounding the warning but then somebody else has to actually respond and Nehemiah came in and he has all of these men that are there some of them are the men that traveled in when Ezra came nine years before some of them are maybe ones that have either been born there in the 70 years since the temple was rebuilt maybe they were children during that time you have this this group of people that are gathered around you know some of these like I said were born in this they've grown up with with crumbled walls around them they've never known anything different they've never they've never known Jerusalem as a Haven they've never known Jerusalem as the place of safety they've never known Jerusalem as the city of Peace they've only ever known it as the place of the temple surrounded by crumbling walls that's all they've ever known and Nehemiah comes in and he's spend several days the three days just checking out everything before he says a word to anyone he's looking at the walls and I wouldn't be at all surprised if he's also even assessing the people that are there a little bit he went out to look at the walls at night but during the day he's still around the people and he's walking and go okay are they hard workers are they people that still seem inspired to do things are they dragging through life because they're so down in the dumps nothing matters which one is it what kind of people are they what kind of leaders do they have around them what kind of all these different things he's assessing he's looking he's trying to get a gauge on what he's going to be dealing with and what he's going to be facing in Nehemiah chapter 3 and verse 28 from above the horse gate repaired the priests everyone over against his house after them repaired zadok the son of EMR over against his house after him repaired also shemiah the son of shakina The Keeper of the East Gate when Nehemiah finally called the men up to work when he gathered them when he was able to start giving out assignments he assigned the men to rebuild the wall that was near their house he didn't have them go all the way across the city to the other side he had them repair the wall that was directly in front of their house and so that every day when they would go out and work brother Robert every day you would go out to rebuild the wall you could see the safety of your family getting better because the protection was right there you didn't have to come back home and see oh the Wall's still crumbling right by my house because I've been working on the other side of the city no the wall in front of your family was being built back up by your own hands you knew what kind of quality work you were doing you knew if you were being lazy and not putting everything just the way that it should not not putting the bricks quite close enough not not mixing up all the uh the mud to put the together not mixing that correctly making it too crumbly or making it too wet you knew the kind of work you were doing and you knew it what was at stake because you weren't building it for the person across town you were building it for your family and you knew that your wife's life and your children's life was going to rest upon the quality of the work that you did on the wall right there Nehemiah came in as the Watchman calling out this needs done this needs done this needs done but then he re pointed out and he said brother Miguel you have to protect your own family so you build the wall right there that's your house that's your wife that's your children you build the wall and he assigned each man to be working over their family and I think that a lot of these men to me I would say that you probably had a few of these men that were like shamgar where they had hit the point where they were so fed up with that r risk that the enemy could come in and take their family at any time the enemy could come in and take their crops could take their supplies could take their family run off with their kids or steal their wife or do any of this they were so fed up of having that fear in the back of their mind that as soon as they had that chance they might not be able to grab the ox code like shamgar but I could grab my brick in my TR and I can start protecting my family right here I don't have the enemy to hit with an ox code but I can start to build the protection because now the moment has come the The Watchman has called out the Watchman has told me I now have the opportunity to build here this is where the weak place is this is where the work needs to be done and I the king has said that we can do this I'm not being stopped by the enemy anymore I now have the right to start to work on it when brother brandom talks about shamgar he says he looked out there and he he's seen that his his righteous indignation he he wasn't a warrior he didn't have time to go away to school and train to fight these Philistines he didn't know nothing about it in the first place so he just grabbed the first thing he could get a hold of it was an ox you know what an ox goe is it's a big stick with a piece of brass on it knock the stuff off and ply with it when it gets choked up or poke the cattle and make them go through the gate he jumped out there in the middle of the road under this knowing that he was a child of God he wasn't a warrior he wasn't a preacher he wasn't this or that or the other you say let the preacher do the preaching let him bring the Revival you've got to do it too start a prayer meeting in your house burn up them cards you're playing take that beer out of the box let's start a Revival right yes sir he grabbed that stick and jumped out there in the middle of the road the spirit of God come and he killed 600 Philistines these men jumped out there and they grabbed their TRS they grabbed the bricks they grabbed the mortar everything that they had and they started building because this they could do they could now begin to provide the protection for their family The Watchmen had called out but now they were the ones doing the work and they were the ones that would be responsible for how good the work was now not all these men I'm sure were trained in how to build a wall like I said how many of them were shopkeepers how many of them were farmers how many of them were this or we're that I'm sure they weren't every single one a Mason now if we had the same thing happen in our church we know brother Mitch's wall is going be great he's going to build up the wall around his house and nobody's getting in the wall around my house we got questions about because I don't know anything about it which means I'm probably taking a lot of trips to brother Mitch's house to find out so how do I do this how do you mix that mortar again how do I get it all set up and squared off just right how do I get this just the way it should be at least if I care about my house and care about my family I'm going to go talk to the man that knows how to do it and I'm sure you had the same thing happening there were men there that had no clue but maybe their neighbor there did or maybe the neighbor two houses over or three houses over and they were going over there and going give me a lesson because I need to know how to protect my family I know you're working on the house around your house and I'm not trying to pull you away from it I just need to know how I just need you to show me how to build this it's the same thing when you have the younger families younger married men younger married women that will go talk to some of the older brothers and older sisters be like how did you get there how did you go through all this how did you deal with all these kinds of things it's the exact same process is going to ask so how do I mix my mortar right how do I set the bricks you're going to someone that's been there someone that's dealt with it I'm not asking you to come and build my family for me I'm just asking you to help me know how to do it I'm asking for that information so that I can then take care of my own family so that I can then take care of the issues that are going on in my life hey if I'm a young single man or a young single woman that's looking for a spouse let me go talk to them some of these that have had longer marriage go how did you know it was the right person how did you set yourself up to be ready how did you set yourself up to be prepared for that all these different things where they're able to go over and ask that neighbor two three doors six doors Seven Doors over how do I is this mortar look all right is it little do I need to add some more water does it need a little more concrete mix or whatever in it does it does it have everything in it that it needs so that way I know that my family is protected so that way I know that everything's going to be taken care of if the enemy comes in Nehemiah chapter 4 and verse 16 Nehemiah has been threatened the people of Israel have been threatened that they could be attacked at any time because the Wall's not done and the enemies around them are ticked off that they're even trying to build the wall and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the spears the Shields and the bows and the habon and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah they which build it on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that laid it everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand he held a weapon for the builders everyone had his swords girded by his side and so build it and he that sound of the trumpet was by me the Watchman sounds the warning The Watchman says hey this is coming hey the enemy is going to be mad that you're trying to get your family in order the enemy is going to be upset that you're trying to apply the token to the house the enemy is going to be upset that you're starting to try to fix things you're trying to mend up the broken places that doesn't mean you stop it means you just make sure that you've got your weapon right beside you the work keeps going but you make sure that you're still Carrying Your Weapon to fight if the enemy shows up but you don't stop building the wall you don't stop putting the protection in place the Watchman keeps calling out going hey now there's an active threat that would be a term that we would hear now is there's now an active threat in the area it's like before there was a passive threat we knew enemies are surrounding us we knew all this was going on you could say the kind of same kind of thing with what is happening in Israel right now it's like you had a passive threat for a while and then when missiles start launching it's now an active threat there's things actually happening or there's a high likelihood that things are about to happen so we had now have an active threat going on and so Nehemiah as the Watchman is sounding the warning there is an active threat but that doesn't mean we stop building and we just stand around the holes in the wall thinking we'll defend ourselves no you keep doing the work even when the enemy starts attacking you even when the enemy starts going against it the work keeps going you just prepare yourself a little more to where now you have the sword right with you now you have the spear or the habon or whichever weapon it is you have it right with you the entire time that you're still traving on the mortar the entire time that you're still laying the bricks you've got a sword sheath that's your side because I'm not leaving it at home anymore it's going with me every step of the way that's one of the things that happens when the Holy Spirit fills you is now suddenly you've got the sword with you it's no longer that the sword is being left at home we've moved into the place where now the sword is going with me I'm carrying my weapon with me at all times I have the word of God inside and I'm ready to fight if necessary but I'm also going to keep building I'm not stopping the watchman's still telling me about the weak places The Watchman is still saying hey this is in your life it doesn't need to be there anymore and you don't stand there and go yeah but I've got a sword I'm good it doesn't matter that there's a gap in the wall because I've got a sword it's not the way it works yes great you have a sword if the enemy attacks before you can get it rebuilt you have the sword to fight him off but you keep building because the goal is to have the wall up so that the enemy can't even get to you then the enemy can't even get in you don't I've got my sword but I'm on this side of the wall the enemy is on that side great I don't have to fight right at this moment because he can't get past the wall he can't get past the barrier in blind barus brother brandom says you'll have to fight every inch of it the devil will make you fight with the sword of God every inch you could but remember footsteps is possession wheresoever your foot Treads that I give unto you every step you can make you know that gets me feeling religious foot steps of possession all the land that your feet will tread upon in this promised land it's yours it's the same to every believer tonight anything that you can take any Divine promise of God and claim it and hold it it's yours in the greatest battle ever fought brother brandom says when the enemy attacks us then oh I tell you you ought to come join our what are you going to do back down compromise not a real Soldier won't no sir what do we do then the mind let the mind that was in Christ is that what the Bible said the mind that was in Christ be with you what kind of mind did he have stay with the word that's right stay with the word the father's word and defeated the enemy every time now when the enemy attacks and tries to say you got to do this and do that what you going to do stay with the word that's right what you want to do then take the word what is the word the Bible said here we just read it for the spirit and of God is the word look here and take the helmet of salvation and the sword the sword of the spirit the sword of the spirit the spirit that comes in through your mind enters into you and the sword of the spirit is the word of God what does the spirit fight with what does the Holy Spirit fight with Sensations feelings the word Glory what does it fight with the word let's say it the word the word of God is what the spirit fights with the spirit of God walks right up to the devil and says it is written amen it is written and the devil gives way what do we do take the sword which is the word of God pull it with what a hand of faith strong hand of Faith the two-edged sword the Bible said in Hebrews 4 it's a two-edged sword Cuts both coming and going brother what does he do take the word take the spirit let the Spirit come into your heart open your mind say Thy word is true Thy word is truth the men of Jerusalem began to see a transformation around them every day they would go out and work and they would go home encrusted in dust encrusted in mud encrusted in whatever get cleaned up go to bed get up the next morning but every morning when they stepped out they could see the progress that they had made the day before they could see the hole was a little bit smaller than it had been even if they had spent all day going over to brother Mitch's and getting lessons so all they had been able to lay was two bricks that was still two bricks more than what they had had the day before and then they went back and you know maybe got a follow-up lesson in a few days and that day they were able to lay four bricks you know other days they didn't they were like okay I'm good enough I can keep going for a while without any more lessons so today I'm laying 40 bricks 50 bricks 100 bricks whatever it might be but every day they could get up in the morning and they could see the progress that had been made they could see that the work was being done they could see the gates that were beginning to be rehung and were beginning to actually be able to close and fasten they could see the walls that were beginning to be rebuilt they could see the towers they were beginning to be refortified so that a Watchman could actually stand up on the tower and see off in the distance they could see every bit of this work that was taking place and can you just imagine the sense of accomplishment the sense of Pride the sense of satisfaction that these men would have every day when they got up to go my family is a little bit safer than they were yesterday and when I get done today they're going to be safer tomorrow than they are today all right and when I get done the next day they're going to be safer that day than they were the day before and they're going to be safer the day after than they were the day before because I'm going to keep working on it because the goal at the end is that the enemy can't get in the goal is at the end that there are no gaps there are no places where the enemy can get in to my family and I'm sure that there were some of the men that got scared when they heard an attack might come and when they got the new orders come out I want every man to be wearing his sword as he's building there may have been even a few men that stayed home because they couldn't bring themselves to do it because they were too scared there may have been some that wouldn't face the challenge they couldn't rise up to it but there were plenty of others they're willing to go okay if I have to lay two bricks because I'm fighting the enemy actively and all I can get is two more bricks my family is still safer at the end of the day than they were at the beginning because I've done two more we've gone another step further we've gotten a little bit closer to that wall being fully taken care of and I know the quality of the work I'm doing because this is for my family this is for my wife this is for my kids it's all too easy for us in nowadays where we get focused on our jobs we get focused on our careers we get focused on these are the things that I need to accomplish and we can start to forget about what we have to accomplish at home we can start to forget about making sure that the wall is built up at home that were protecting the family at home because you can't see physical transformation the same way that they could with that wall on the wall every single brick you could see as you put it down as husbands as parents as we work on it but you don't necessarily see things change from that work in that moment you can't see okay I've placed another brick okay I've placed another 10 bricks okay I've placed another however many at the end of the day you go okay I had a conversation with my son I don't know if he heard a word I said so did any bricks get laid did it actually happen or was this kind of was it a waste of time which one was it because I can't see it in the moment we can't see it in the moment and as men especially we like the satisfaction of seeing we've been able to accomplish something now it's one of the reasons that a so often we focus on our careers because we we know we're getting things done we know we're getting things accomplished we can see progress we can see things are happening when we're taking care of our kids or we're taking care of our spouse sometimes we don't feel like did was any progress made did did anything happen and I'm going to assume that sometimes the wise feel the same way you guys can discuss that amongst yourselves after service on whether that's right or not but I would assume that the wives do the same thing sometimes we're feeling hey I've done this for my husband and I have no idea if anything happened I have nothing I have no idea if there was any building that happened here I've done this with my children I don't know if there's I have corrected this child a hundred times on the exact same thing and they still leave their socks in the middle of the floor there are no bricks going down there is no progress being made nothing is happening we can't see the progress like they could as they were building that physical wall but yet the bricks are still going down the time that's being invested is still taking place the time that we spend with our family the time that we spend on that relationship the time that we spend on our own relationship with Christ how many times is it that you get down you do your devotions you read your scriptures and you get up and go I didn't get a thing out of it I just read through however many chapters How many verses and you walk away going none of it stuck I didn't get a bit of it I spent 30 minutes I spent an hour I spent whatever but then how many times as you're out doing something whether it's out on a job site whether it's at the job whether it's in a store something gets brought back to your remembrance a verse pops back up or a quote pops back in and maybe you not don't even remember exactly when you last read that you know don't remember the exact last time that you did read it now I know there are other times when we're reading the scripture or we're reading the quotes and there are things popping out all over to us it's almost like God's coming through with a highlighter and just making it pop for you but there other times you're going through it and you're doing the work and you're tring and you're putting down the bricks and it's not pretty work it's not fun work and you feel like did anything actually happen was there any progress did I actually get something done these men had seen this amazing change going on through their lives they had how so many of them had come in and they walked in to see the walls broken others had been born and raised there and they grew up only knowing broken Bren walls but now day after day they're seeing the walls be mended day after day they're seeing the progress made they're getting up in the morning they're strapping a sword to their side they're grabbing their tools and they're going out to where they worked yesterday to start building a little bit more to start putting a Little Bit Stronger protection there for for their family and at the end of it this wall that had been broken for 140 years the temple was destroyed Jerusalem was torn up all these kind of things 70 years they were gone they came back they rebuilt the temple they weren't allowed to rebuild the walls 61 years later Ezra comes back with some more men 9 years later Nehemiah shows up the walls have been broken for 140 years and in 52 days the walls and the gates are completely reared and restored and a big part of that was because because the men were focusing on the wall that affected their family they were focusing on what was going to take care of the ones they were entrusted to watch over the ones that they were entrusted to protect the ones that they were entrusted to be with the Watchman was there telling them where work needed to be done where are the weak places this is what needs done but the Watchman wasn't the one over there with the TR and the bricks he he wasn't the one there with the Mallet rehanging the doors he wasn't the one doing that that took each one of the men themselves to work on the wall by their house as we've been hearing these sermons about the Watchmen on the wall and the great responsibility do the Watchman have and I know that I've sat back there and it's made me think even more about what my call is and my responsibility towards it my responsibility not just as a minister but as a father and as a husband because it's the same thing where as a minister maybe I'm a Watchman in this environment but at home I'm a Watchman and have I been watching as good as I should at home have I been making sure that I haven't been letting things creep in through the cracks into the house shouldn't be there or creep into our lives that shouldn't be there have I been as diligent to make sure that those walls are repaired have I been as diligent to be calling it out of my wife or calling it out of my children that hey these are areas in your lives that need to be addressed hey these are areas as a family we need to work together to rebuild these are things that we need to do because it's not brother Wendell's job as he's up here ministering and being a Watchman it's not his job to grab the hammer and rebuild your life it's not his job to come in and rebuild the walls around your family or around your personal life or whatever it might be the Watchman is simply the one that calls out and gives the warning and points to what needs to be done but then each one of us us both as men and women are responsible for what we do with that warning the Watchman sounds the warning so the blood is now off their hands but now those of us that have heard the warning the blood's on our hands it's up to us on what we're actually going to do with it are we going to be inspired like these men were to where this is all about me protecting my family this is all about me protecting my wife protecting my children protecting my livelihood protecting whatever and I am going to rebuild to the best of my ability to make sure that they have the safety they need I am going to build and when threats come in when problems come in I'm not going to stop building I'm just going to gird on my sword and keep working are we able to step up into that or is it far too easy to fall into the lukewarm leesy in condition we go it's not that bad it's just a crack in the wall doesn't mean you know the Wall's Still Standing I don't know how easy it'll be to push over but I mean there's cracks but oh well it's okay there's a little hole it's not a problem it's not yet big enough enough for a guy to climb through not going to think about the fact they can shoot arrows through it but you know that a person can't climb through it so it's not bad yet it's not a bad situation it's too easy to fall into that type of mindset to go as we come to service Sunday after Sunday Wednesday after Wednesday and hear the Watchman calling out and you begin to deafen your ears a little bit go ah it's not that big a deal but yet the Watchman is calling us and trying to inspire us back to go this is about you this is about your family and this is the one where I can only go and go this is how I look at it as the man this is how I look at it as what my responsibility is what am I missing that needs to be fixed what are the things that I'm allowing that could affect my kids down the road because I didn't rebuild the wall because I didn't step in and clean things up because I didn't step in and was like oh it's a little hole it doesn't matter and then have a situation where down the road I'm going to have to answer for the fact that my kids continue to fight this because I didn't deal with it back then I wasn't willing to wear the sword and build the wall I was too distracted I was too focused by other things I was too busy the Watchman has such an important responsibility The Watchman has such an important role but the job doesn't stop at the Watchmen the job stops right where every single one of us is sitting or standing because it comes down to what we choose to do with it it comes down to whether we choose to accept the warning and we choose to do the work we choose to spend the time on our knees in prayer we choose to spend the time in the word we choose to spend the time going through our lives and getting rid of the trash we take the time to go through our homes we take the time to go through whatever it might be and we get rid of what shouldn't be there or we ignore the warning and wait to see what happens Nehemiah was inspired to go in but he wasn't the one called to build the wall himself he was called to come in and sound the warning he was called to come in and get the men working yes he was called to lead it he was called to be there and pointing out everything they needed done he was called to inspire but it was the men that were living there because Nehemiah he didn't come in with this large work group he didn't have a construction company that he brought with him to handle it all he showed up with a few men that he traveled with and then it was up to the people that were living there the ones that had for a lot of them lived their whole lives or most of their lives in the shadow of crumbling walls and burned Gates but they were the ones that had to do the work they were the ones that had had to get everything done the Watchman has the responsibility to call the warning but then the rest of us have to actually respond to the warning when brother Wendell or other ministers are up here passionately calling out and pointing out what's going on in each one of our Lives when a visiting Minister comes in and is preaching and and you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he has no clue about anything in your life and yet every word he's saying is applying to what you're dealing with and then you want to step back and go ah it's a small hole it doesn't matter well if it didn't matter then why'd God have him say it right cuz you can't sit there and go well he knows my story I know we can do that when it's brother Wendell or or when it's me or when it's brother joshh or somebody that's in this home church we can go ah they know what's going on in my life that God didn't lead him to say that's just them want to pick on me but when you get these visiting ministers to come in and they will do the exact same thing and lay into it and you can't at that point how can you still say it's a small thing if God would inspire a man to preach it how can you say it's a small thing that doesn't matter and I am preaching it myself as much as any one of you because I have done it countless times over the years where they're preaching and they're hitting on what needs to be handled in my life and yet I get up and walk out the doors with no intention of doing anything with no not allowing any conviction to drive me not letting anything push me to what needs to be dealt with what needs to be addressed I was talking with brother Wendell Wednesday night after he had preached and we were talking a little bit about Israel and I was going you know for years as long as I have grown up in this message we have heard sermon after sermon after sermon saying the Rapture is almost here it's right around the corner it's right there it's and now I'm closing in on 40 so this has been being said for quite a while but yet brother brandom also told us that Israel is our time piece and so when you see these kind of things going on it should just make everything back aresh to us to go well wait I know we've been saying it for 40 years but how much closer are we now if this is what's happening there if this is what's going on if this is what we're seeing in the world these are the conditions that are happening how much closer are we how much closer are we to the enemy attack hey there's an active threat maybe it's time we G up our sword maybe it's time we get out there and build the wall and do what we're supposed to be doing maybe it's time for us to forget a little bit about do I have tons of savings in my bank account maybe it's time for us to stop worrying quite so much about have I built up my career the way that I should have I built this up have do I have everything ready so that way I'll be able to retire at this age and then I can enjoy all my years after that maybe it's time for us to get a little more focused on what what are we going to have on the other side am I going to be prepared when we're supposed to take that next step am I going to be where I'm supposed to be at we've heard the warning we've heard it over and over and over and over to where we start and we will get up here and we'll shout amen when the minister is saying the Rapture could happen at any time amen that's right it's true and then as soon as we step out the do is like all right so these are the jobs I have lined up for this week this is what I'm going to be doing and man if I can get this bid then I'll have this job for the next couple months and you know I've got to make sure that I hire enough employees at Chick-fil-A so that we're ready for this busy time and this that or the other and yet 10 minutes ago we were amening yes it could be any time and that's not to say there's anything wrong with business planning but do we really have to business plan as soon as we step past those doors or are we supposed to be taking at least a little bit of time to really be thinking considering about you know the Rapture could be in the morning it could be any moment and yes God wants us to plan as though we were going to be here a thousand years plan as though you're going to be here don't sell all your possessions go up on the mountain and wait for the rapture that's not the calling but maybe it's time for us to get a little more serious about those walls we're supposed to be building get a little more serious about having the sword strapped on so that we keep the enemy out you know I've admitted to people before when when we find out that that my wife was pregnant with silus I got stressed because immediately I'm going how in the world can I afford this it's like we've been good with three kids three kids have been great we've been doing this for years now we've got the budget figured out we've got things going what are we going to do with the fourth where is it going to fit in the house how are we going to pay for it how are we going to provide and then God decided to do it to me again when I started to settle with okay we've got a fourth we're good then God says hey here's one more I was never one of those parents that was thinking oh I'm GNA have one of these big homeschool families I came from a family of two my wife came from a family of two I thought at three I was great I went above and Beyond with three I was not trying to catch brother Michael this was not in the goal okay but then God said okay here let's give you a fifth and I got to go through the whole processing and going Lord how are we going to pay for this Lord where is this going to fit in the house where's silus going to go where's the baby going to go where's any of this how is this going to work how is my job going to provide for this this we're going to have two in diapers at once where's this coming from brother Michael knows all about that but how one with diapers is expensive enough make it two and I had to go through for a little while I'll admit I had a short time where I was then looking at my finances way too hard and thinking of what a failure I am because I don't have Savings in the bank because we don't have our own house we're still renting we don't have this we don't have that I still work at a fast food restaurant I am not in the world's terms at all successful I don't have rental properties out there bringing in income I don't have any of this kind of stuff whatever I don't have a tons of toys we don't have multiple vehicles in our family go down the checklist and according to the world I am not worth much and so you go through this when you have this kind of reminder thrown at you and you look at the finances and then you go look at like what any of the even so-called Christian Financial guys would tell you where you should be at and you sit there going wow I haven't done a single thing right in my whole life I'm in an awful place we're all going to be living under a bridge before I'm done if I keep going down this path and it's so easy to get dragged into this mindset but yet at the same time when we turn around and go okay let's look at this from God's Viewpoint children are a blessing from the Lord blessing is the man whose quiver is full of them God didn't say that I had to have thousands or millions in the bank he said that I was supposed to work and do my best to provide for my family and not be stupid and run up a bunch of debt I'm still working on that part but yet he throws as you and goes from the world standpoint They're Going H the exact questions that I had to ask was start to ask myself how are we going to afford this how am I going to pay for another child what's going to happen and God's sitting over here going it's a blessing this is a good thing and So eventually you hit the point and I have no idea how long any of this process took because I wasn't keeping track but eventually you hit the point where we go all right Lord if you're giving us another one you're providing I'm going to keep doing what I'm supposed to do I'm going to go to work I'm going to do my best to provide and I'm going to trust you to get the income somehow whether that's raises whether that's bonuses whether that's something completely that I have never thought of you figure it out as long as I'm still doing my part my responsibility is more about am I building the wall around my family to take care of them spiritually at the end of it whether I have the millions in the bank doesn't matter whether I have the most successful whether I rent for the rest of my life and never buy a house really doesn't matter as much as a huge part of me in my heart quivers at the idea as much as my mind goes but that would be horrible you're throwing away money on rent every single month but yet God's call is to take care of my family and to raise them in the admonition of the Lord and if I'm making sure that I'm building the wall if I'm making sure to get rid of the junk that shouldn't be there if I'm making sure to teach my children the way that I should if I'm taking care to encourage and strengthen my wife the way that I should if doing those parts because the goal is keep the enemy out of my family that's my calling and that's the calling of each one of the men that's here and each one of the sisters that's here it's your calling to keep the enemy away from your children and to keep the enemy away from your husband and to keep the enemy away from your own life God calls us to build the walls to fill in the gaps to build the holes to repair the gates because Jerusalem is supposed to be the place of Peace it's supposed to be the place where you can feel that peace even in the midst of the storm even when surrounded by the enemy you can feel the peace and protection ction because you know the wall is standing God has armed us God has equipped us we have the sword to fight but as long as we're within those walls we actually don't have to fight it's only when we venture out if we're within the walls if the protection is there it's like the song that brother Mike sings you can't cross the bloodline as long as I'm staying behind that bloodline as long as as I'm making sure that token is there you can't get to me you can't get to my family you may be beating against the wall it may be sounding awful there may be all kinds of bad reports coming around but you can't actually get to us because we're behind the wall but if we haven't rebuilt the wall if we haven't applied the token then the enemy has free reign to come and go it's like those that lived in Jerusalem during that time for years the enemy could arrive at will for 140 years they could come in with basically nothing to stop them if they chose to for 70 years after the temple was rebuilt and now there's more of an attraction to come in and raid and take what's there the enemy could come in if they wanted but then God raised up Watchmen he sent an Ezra to work on getting the temple more in order where it was supposed to be he sent a Nehemiah to work on getting everything rebuilt at the walls and then yes also to deal with the temple even more he sent the Watchman in to point out what needed to be done and then he put it on each man and I would be willing to bet some of the wives got out there with their husbands and were building the wall I wouldn't be surprised at all if there were some of them out there putting some bricks down or spreading some mortar with their husbands to get this wall built but they were willing to go out there and do the work and they were able to rebuild this in basically record time because they were focusing on the wall that had the most effect to what was important to them to their family to their belongings how much can each one of us as we look at the walls that are supposed to be in our lives the token that's supposed to be applied and is the seal fully there or is there trash that we need to deal with are there some gaps that we need to build back up are there some places that we need to address don't get scared just because the enemy is saying they're going to attack just because you're hearing the reports going back and forth that just means it's time to buckle on the sword while you're building that just means it's time to carry your weapon with you at all times as you're building build it up but we're called to build the wall the Watchman tells us what needs done the Watchman points out the weak areas but then we're the ones on the ground that have to do the work we're the ones that are on the ground that need to be doing the praying that need to be doing the reading that need to be doing the cleaning as brother brandom said throwing out the cards or burning the cards are throwing out these different things we're the ones that are supposed to be doing that not the Watchmen let's have the musicians come back up brother brandom said in the sermon the token he said then when we pray we must have the token to present with our prayers as I said and now believe for ourselves and apply the token to the whole family like in Egypt Jericho or either in Acts 16:31 we find out that Paul told the Roman Centurion say believe thou and all thy house shall be saved apply it to your family if you've got an unsaved child lay the token right on top of him say Lord God I claim him stay right there if you got a mother or a loved one that's lost lay that token on them say Lord God I claim it move out all the worldly trash out of your house get ready for it burn up your shorts throw your card tables away get rid of your cigarettes dump your unbelief and your church papers in the trash can where they belong amen then you're getting ready then what do you do then apply the token in prayer with real evidence real Faith apply it apply it with confidence when you apply the token know that you are cleaned up if our hearts condemn us not then we have our request The Watchman calls out the warning the Watchman calls out a different warning to each one of us the way the wall is crumbling around my house maybe by Brother Joe's how it's a it's a gate that's hanging off the hinges slightly well I need mortar and Bricks he needs wood and hinges and mallets and we need different types of equipment we need different types of materials to repair because we have different issues when the Watchman calls out he's calling out the warning to each one of us and each one of us is applying it to our lives a little bit differently because the areas the gaps are a little different in each one of our Lives maybe you've just got a couple missing bricks that's a hole and you just got to fit those in other people maybe there's a huge massive chunk torn out of the wall other people maybe it's the gates are still hanging they just kind of need reattached and stuff other people maybe the gates are completely burned and gone and they need completely remade each one of us is different each one of us is dealing with our own things but the Watchman Faithfully get gets up and calls out the Watchman Faithfully gets up and not just from the pulpit every time you press press play you're hearing that Watchman calling out pointing out what needs done each time that you go back to the scriptures and begin to read The Watchman speaking out to you the Watchman is crying pointing out what needs done and it's up to each one of us on whether we're going to respond Lord Jesus we lord this seems like it's been a little bit all over the place Lord but Lord it was what you started to lay on my heart from Wednesday night from the sermon Lord and Lord I pray that you would help me to be a better Watchman Lord a better worker in my own life a better worker in my family Lord help me to respond to the the call of the The Watchmen around me Lord to to gird on the sword Lord to to grab the bricks and mortar and do the work that needs done Lord there's not a there's not a parent in here that would be willing to have one of their children lost Lord there's not a an individual in here that would be will to have one of their parents or siblings or family members that that didn't make [Music] it Lord forgive us for when we get so busy with life when we get so busy with everything that's going on around us Lord when Lord when I get so busy just trying to make ends meet or trying to make sure things are provided for that I let the walls crumble around us Lord forgive us where we failed you Lord Lord give us the the spirit of shamgar Lord to to rise back up to fight off the enemy to rebuild those crumbling walls Lord to rehang the gates Lord Jesus Lord to be able to just enjoy the the peace that you bring us Lord I pray that you would be with each one of my brothers and sisters here Lord that Lord you would help them to to rebuild and repair any of the walls that have crumbled any of the gates that have that have fallen Lord help us to buckle on those swords to keep our weapon with us as we work knowing that the final
