[22:29] a sense of uh excitement father as

[22:34] just pray that you will be with her on
[22:38] her first baby and be with her and the
[22:40] baby and and and brother Aaron Lord just

[23:02] anoint it let your blessings and your
[23:05] presence be with us Lord you see Dad

[23:27] of your people in Jesus name we pray
[23:30] amen and
[23:32] amen you can be seated here
[23:35] today we um we're going to read out of
[23:38] uh
[23:40] 264 and um we're going to start down
[23:42] here on the third
[23:45] paragraph and um so we're going
[23:49] to uh be dealing with the book of life
[23:52] so some people um it gets have you know
[23:57] can be confused
[23:59] um how can your name be on the book of
[24:03] life and and never have it taken off and
[24:06] yet the Bible just said that that there
[24:10] will
[24:11] be names that will come off of The Book
[24:13] of Life and um and so uh for some that
[24:18] that can be a little bit
[24:20] confusing and um but brother brother
[24:23] brandom um he in in the um fa his Works
[24:29] expressed there in 11: 2665 he says
[24:33] you're going to see maybe a little
[24:35] confusion uh there of what I said of the
[24:38] two books of life he says it's the same
[24:41] book but one of them is your natural
[24:44] birth the other one is your spiritual
[24:48] birth one leads out to the other one
[24:51] just like a stalk of wheat well now you
[24:55] talk of you talk of me you talk of me as
[24:58] a living person but there's a part of me
[25:01] here is that person that that must
[25:04] perish but that that's the book that the
[25:07] name comes off of but the Eternal one
[25:10] the predestinated one the elected one
[25:13] the name can never uh never can come
[25:18] from there because it was always on it
[25:22] it can never be taken off and so as we
[25:26] as we go into this lesson here tonight
[25:29] we we we should you know really be
[25:31] thankful for God's for election there's
[25:34] no man that would ever be saved no boy
[25:38] girl man or woman that could ever be
[25:41] saved and and even hope to be a part of
[25:44] the pride except the Lord Jesus loved
[25:48] you
[25:49] eternally and he put your name in that
[25:52] Lamb's Book of Life and how there should
[25:54] be a great humility
[25:58] a a a deep humility within every one of
[26:01] us before the Lord in our in our prayer
[26:04] life it should never just be nonchalant
[26:07] you know just coming before God and and
[26:09] and how how we should have a
[26:13] desire greater than we've ever had
[26:16] before as we as as as we're seeing the
[26:19] church ages and seeing God's great plan
[26:23] and how that God is doing everything
[26:26] amen everything that he can throughout
[26:28] all of the ages and vindicating it he
[26:30] puts it in Prophecy and then we can see
[26:33] it and and to to show us in this day
[26:38] this was my plan this is the finality
[26:43] you're my reason and I love you little
[26:46] bride and I'm going to take you home
[26:48] with me I I think I think every church
[26:51] service should be a real Earnest Every
[26:54] Time We Come and sing songs it should be
[26:57] Earnest every time time the preacher is
[26:59] preaching it should be he should preach
[27:01] with earnestness and we should listen
[27:03] with earnestness if every prayer meeting
[27:05] I think I think we should have that
[27:07] burning Zeal with within our hearts and
[27:11] U and so um as we get ready uh page
[27:16] 264 and
[27:18] um uh want to say that it's good to have
[27:22] sister April back with us and
[27:25] uh and that and that young fell right
[27:28] there beside her amen good to good to
[27:30] have y'all um uh back home and uh you
[27:34] know every time that that that you
[27:36] recognize somebody you always miss
[27:37] somebody else out so I'm going to learn
[27:39] to just never say that but it wasn't
[27:40] because I don't like you amen and so but
[27:43] it's good to have you back home amen all
[27:45] right let's start here the promise to
[27:48] the
[27:49] Overcomer Revelations 3:5 he that
[27:52] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[27:55] White
[27:55] rment I Will Not blot out his name out
[27:59] of the book of life but I will confess
[28:01] his name before my father and his holy
[28:04] angels He that overcometh the same shall
[28:09] be clothed in white raymen this is
[28:11] actually a repetition of verse four
[28:15] wherein is made reference to the few who
[28:18] have not
[28:19] defiled their garments we used to have a
[28:23] saying years ago that no doubt was taken
[28:26] from from this verse it was keep your
[28:29] skirts clean it meant don't get involved
[28:32] in questionable things others will be
[28:35] involved and you might be tempted to be
[28:38] involved or someone might even try to
[28:41] involve you but stay clear of it all by
[28:46] staying uh by steering a course away
[28:49] from it now I think that's good advice
[28:52] for young and old I think I think we we
[28:55] in in this day if that that is that
[28:57] isn't incredible invi advice in in this
[29:01] digital Age and and um there's there's
[29:05] so many things you know for even you
[29:07] young you you you kids but then also for
[29:09] you teenagers there's so many things
[29:11] that's open to you steer away from
[29:16] it I and I want to just say this you
[29:18] know I think I think uh uh keeping
[29:22] ourselves away from
[29:23] Temptations we we got to ask ourselves
[29:26] if you're tempted about things you know
[29:28] with your phones especially you kids you
[29:30] you you young people uh well all of us
[29:33] you know W with
[29:35] with there's so much junk and sometimes
[29:39] when you're when you're all by yourself
[29:42] and you're you're um uh you know in in
[29:47] in your bedrooms and the devil is always
[29:49] trying to tempt you you know what I have
[29:51] found the good way to do away with that
[29:54] kind of thing is is if those of you that
[29:57] have the phones put it on the kitchen on
[30:00] the kitchen cabinet on on the counter
[30:03] leave it leave it there go to bed do
[30:07] what you need to do amen but don't give
[30:11] room for the Devils uh don't don't enter
[30:16] into Satan's
[30:18] playground amen and and you you know
[30:22] there's there's there's a lot of these
[30:24] things that that'll keep you guys you
[30:27] kids from ever getting into an addiction
[30:30] or ever keep you from getting into a
[30:32] bondage I if if you will do things as
[30:36] Christians right now and say you know
[30:38] what I I am tempted in this area so what
[30:42] I'm going to do is I'm going to put that
[30:45] up so that Satan can't lure me in and I
[30:50] think that's good advice what brother
[30:52] brandham just said he says keep your
[30:54] skirts clean he says it meant don't get
[30:57] involved in question questionable things
[30:59] others will be involved you might be
[31:01] tempted to be involved or someone might
[31:03] even try to involve you but stay clear
[31:06] of it all by steering a course away from
[31:10] it now God is going to reward those who
[31:14] follow this advice he's going to reward
[31:18] you he says now uh it says they are
[31:21] going to be clothed in white even as he
[31:24] is clothed in white praise the Lord
[31:26] Peter James and John saw him on Mount
[31:30] Transfiguration his clothes were as
[31:32] white as as light that is how the Saints
[31:35] are going to be clothed their garments
[31:38] will be shining exceedingly white you
[31:41] know we are living in the end time it is
[31:44] in this age that the churches are going
[31:47] to come together as they are even now
[31:50] controlling the world politics they will
[31:53] soon control the finances of the world
[31:56] then if you don't belong to the world
[31:57] Oran organization of churches you won't
[32:00] be able to buy or to sell you will lose
[32:02] all those who stay true to God and keep
[32:06] their garments clean from the defilement
[32:09] of this world system of of of church
[32:12] orders will be physically beaed there
[32:15] will be presented to them a great
[32:17] temptation to give in Preachers will
[32:20] give in with the excuse that they will
[32:23] serve God within the framework of the
[32:24] Antichrist be system they will give in
[32:28] to the flatteries and the blandishments
[32:30] of the hierarchy and the people will
[32:33] follow these false Shepherds right into
[32:36] the slaughter but in the
[32:38] Judgment um they will all be found naked
[32:42] my my my I think about that all of these
[32:45] all of these false preachers out there
[32:47] that are leading Millions
[32:50] astray they will not be given those
[32:52] white robes neither can they walk with
[32:55] him you can't walk in the spotted
[32:58] garments of the world holding hands with
[33:01] the devil here and then expect to be
[33:04] with God it is not it is time to wake up
[33:08] and to hear the voice of God crying come
[33:11] out of her organized religion my people
[33:15] that you be not partakers of her sins
[33:18] that you receive not of her
[33:21] plagues amen God is speaking shun the
[33:24] religions of this world like you shun
[33:26] the plague leave off walking with the
[33:29] world and make your garments white by
[33:32] repentance and the blood of the Lamb do
[33:35] it now for tomorrow may be too late
[33:40] let's read that verse together but do it
[33:43] now for tomorrow may be too late he that
[33:48] overcometh I will not blot his name out
[33:51] of The Book of Life once again we come
[33:53] to a most difficult portion of the word
[33:57] this verse superficially regarded will
[33:59] be used by both the Armenians and the
[34:02] calvinist to suit their purposes the
[34:06] Armenians will declare that this verse
[34:08] assuredly annuls John 6 um 6th chapter
[34:13] 37-39 and 41-
[34:16] 44 all that the father giveth me shall
[34:20] come to me and him that cometh to me I
[34:23] will in no wise cast out for I came down
[34:27] from heaven
[34:28] not to do mine own will but the will of
[34:30] him that sent me and this is the
[34:32] Father's will which has sent me that of
[34:35] all which he hath given me I should lose
[34:39] nothing but should raise it up again in
[34:42] the last
[34:44] days the Jews then murmured at
[34:48] him because he said I am the bread which
[34:52] comes down from heaven and they said is
[34:54] not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose
[34:57] father and mother we know how is it then
[35:00] that he saith I I Come From Heaven down
[35:03] from heaven Jesus therefore answered and
[35:07] said unto them murmur not among
[35:09] yourselves no man can come to me except
[35:13] the Father which hath sent me draw him
[35:16] and I will raise him up in the last days
[35:19] Armenian ISM makes the Father the will
[35:22] of the father not a sovereign purpose
[35:24] but merely a complacent desire as he
[35:27] stands back to see what all men do with
[35:30] this good and gracious
[35:32] gifts even e life eternal the calvinist
[35:36] do not see that they see in this verse
[35:39] strong consolation given to the
[35:41] suffering burdened saints that no matter
[35:44] how evil are the times how terrible the
[35:47] persecution because the Overcomer is one
[35:51] who believeth that Jesus is the Christ
[35:54] he will not have his name removed from
[35:55] that book some also say that this book
[35:58] of life is not the book the Lamb's Book
[36:00] of
[36:01] Life but as usual when one regards a
[36:04] verse superficially he comes up with a
[36:06] superficial understanding the
[36:09] possibility of the removal of a name
[36:11] from the records of God deserves more
[36:14] than a casual study for up until now
[36:18] most students have merily drawn a
[36:22] conclusion that God places the names of
[36:25] those Born Again within the Lamb's Book
[36:27] Book of Life at the time of their
[36:29] rebirth if for any and if for any reason
[36:34] that name must be removed the space on
[36:36] the record will simply be a blank as it
[36:39] was before a name had been placed there
[36:42] there is one this is 100% opposite to
[36:46] what the word actually
[36:48] teaches as the very at the very start of
[36:50] our study let it be known that there is
[36:54] not one scripture that teaches that God
[36:57] is presently compiling a record of names
[37:01] this was all done before the foundation
[37:03] of the world as we will point out
[37:06] shortly also it is not a question of
[37:10] Simply involving ourselves with two
[37:11] groups of people both of whom had the
[37:14] opportunity to receive eternal life
[37:16] wherein one group received it had their
[37:19] names placed on the record while the
[37:21] others who refused it did not have their
[37:23] name so placed we will actually show by
[37:27] by scripture that multitudes were not
[37:30] even born again will go into eternal
[37:33] life as strange as this may sound it's
[37:37] certain it is certainly true we will
[37:40] also show that there is a group of
[37:42] people whose names have been placed on
[37:45] that record before the foundation of the
[37:48] world that cannot under any
[37:50] circumstances have those names removed
[37:54] but we'll also show that another group
[37:57] whose names were on that record before
[38:00] the foundation of the world will have
[38:02] their names
[38:04] removed to begin with there is no basis
[38:06] for the claims that the Lamb's Book of
[38:09] Life is not the same as the Book of Life
[38:13] The Book of Life might be called the
[38:14] Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's Book of
[38:17] Life or even thy book and the Book of
[38:20] the living only names are written in it
[38:24] Revelations 138 all that dwell on the
[38:27] Earth shall worship Him the
[38:30] Beast whose names are not written in the
[38:33] Book of Life of the lamb slain from the
[38:36] foundation of the world Revelation 178
[38:40] the Beast that thou sawest was and is
[38:43] not shall Ascend out of the bottomless
[38:46] pit and go into predition they that
[38:48] dwell upon the Earth shall wonder whose
[38:50] names were not written in the Book of
[38:53] Life from the foundation of the world
[38:55] when they behold the Beast that was is
[38:57] not and yet is Revelations 20 and 12 to
[39:01] 15 I saw the dead small and great stand
[39:06] before God and the books were open and
[39:09] another book was open which is The Book
[39:12] of Life the dead were judged out of
[39:15] those things which were written in the
[39:16] books according to their works and the
[39:20] Sea gave up the dead that were which
[39:22] were in it and death and Hell delivered
[39:24] up the dead which were in them and they
[39:27] were judged every man according to their
[39:30] Works death and hell were cast into the
[39:32] Lake of Fire this is the second death
[39:36] whosoever was not found written in the
[39:38] Book of Life was cast into the Lake of
[39:42] Fire you can see that though there are
[39:45] two books mentioned there is there is
[39:49] always the reference to one book
[39:51] containing names in the Revelation it is
[39:55] called the Lamb's Book of Life
[39:57] or the book of life amen everyone
[40:00] understanding so far you you kids
[40:03] understanding so so in this in this
[40:07] book there's there's going to be uh and
[40:10] and we're going to go through it uh
[40:12] we're not going to get into the whole
[40:13] thing but brother Brandon's going to
[40:14] teach us now um there there's there
[40:19] is the The Book of Life that holds the
[40:22] that holds the natural life of of of the
[40:26] people and some some of these people are
[40:28] not even um it's they can have their
[40:31] names removed but God uses those
[40:34] people anoints those people even to for
[40:38] a specific purpose God raises these up
[40:42] and this is going to really as we read
[40:45] this we're going to be able to really
[40:47] see um where we are today because we got
[40:52] a lot of churches now I'm not saying
[40:54] that we we're going to say we're saved
[40:56] and no one else is saved that's up to
[40:57] God but what we do is we follow
[41:01] scripture and we never we never deviate
[41:05] from scripture our heart is always let
[41:07] us follow the word amen because if your
[41:10] name is written in that Lamb's Book of
[41:12] Life you're going to love his word right
[41:14] but there's going to be others who love
[41:18] to sing and preach and love to to
[41:22] worship but they don't love his word and
[41:26] and and God uses those people for a
[41:30] specific purpose amen but but eternal
[41:34] life can only be given to those whom God
[41:38] has shown favor to and and it's all
[41:41] God's favor amen now um okay so he says
[41:46] now where is this book located Luke 10:1
[41:51] 17-24 and the 70 returned again with Joy
[41:54] saying Lord even the devils are subject
[41:58] unto us through thy name he said unto
[42:01] them I will I beheld Satan as lightning
[42:04] fall from Heaven and behold I give unto
[42:07] you power to tread on serpents and
[42:10] scorpions and all the power of the enemy
[42:13] and nothing shall by any means hurt you
[42:16] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that
[42:18] the spirits are subject to you but
[42:21] rather Rejoice because your names are
[42:24] written in heaven in that hour Jesus
[42:27] rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee
[42:30] oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[42:33] thou has HIIT these things from the wise
[42:35] and prudent and has revealed them unto
[42:38] babes even so father for so it seemed
[42:41] good in thy sight all things are
[42:44] delivered to me of my father and no man
[42:46] knoweth who the son is but the father
[42:49] and who the father is but the son and he
[42:51] to whom the son will reveal him he
[42:55] turned uh and he turned him unto his
[42:58] disciples and said privately blessed are
[43:01] your eyes which see the things that ye
[43:03] see for I tell you that many prophets
[43:07] and Kings have desired to see the things
[43:10] which you see and have not seen them and
[43:13] to hear those things which you hear and
[43:16] have not heard them The Book of Life is
[43:18] definitely located in heaven and will
[43:21] appear at the great white Throne
[43:23] judgment in these verses Jesus said that
[43:26] their name names were written in heaven
[43:29] they were written in the Book of Life
[43:32] for that is where names are placed Jesus
[43:36] was speaking to the 70 verse 17 but he
[43:40] was also speaking to the 12 verse
[43:43] 23 these had all been rejoicing that
[43:47] Devils were subject to them in Jesus
[43:51] name Christ's rejoiner was Rejoice not
[43:55] that the spirits are subject to you but
[43:57] rather that your names are written in
[44:00] heaven book of life you will note here
[44:03] that Judas was one of those who were
[44:05] casting out devils in jesus' name but we
[44:08] know that he was a devil the son of
[44:09] predition according to John 670 and 71
[44:14] Jesus answered them have not I chosen
[44:18] you 12 and one of you is a devil he
[44:22] spake of judas's scarat the son of Simon
[44:25] for he it was that that should betray
[44:29] him being one of the 12 John 17 and12
[44:33] while I was with them in the world I
[44:36] kept them in thy name those that thou
[44:40] gavest me I have kept and none of them
[44:44] is lost but the son of predition that
[44:47] the scripture might be fulfilled John 13
[44:51] 10- 11 and also 18 Jesus said to him he
[44:56] that wasth needeth not Sav to wash his
[44:59] feet but is every wit clean and ye are
[45:02] clean but not all for he knew who should
[45:07] betray him therefore said he ye are not
[45:10] all clean I speak not of you
[45:14] all I know who am I've chosen but that
[45:18] the scripture might be fulfilled he that
[45:21] eateth bread with me hath lifted up his
[45:24] hell his heel against
[45:27] me now if this language means anything
[45:31] we must admit that Jesus was chosen by
[45:34] Jesus John
[45:36] 13:18 yet he was not clean John 1310
[45:41] through1 Judas was also given to Jesus
[45:44] by the Father John
[45:47] 17:12 Let It Be noted
[45:50] here that the choosing and giving is
[45:54] exact parallel in the illustration of
[45:58] Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau for
[46:02] though Esau and Pharaoh were both
[46:04] forn they were predestinated to wrath
[46:08] while the end of Moses and Jacob was
[46:12] glorification 1 Peter 2 and
[46:15] 8-9 says show both repeate or shows both
[46:19] repeate and elect even to them which
[46:22] stumble at the word being disobedient
[46:25] where unto also Al they were
[46:29] appointed but ye are a chosen
[46:34] generation Judas was numbered with the
[46:36] 12 and actually had a part with them in
[46:39] the ministry previous to
[46:41] Pentecost acts 1:16 And1 17 men and
[46:46] Brethren this scripture must needs have
[46:49] been
[46:50] fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the
[46:53] mouth of David spake concerning Judas
[46:56] which was guide to them that took Jesus
[47:00] for he was numbered with us and had
[47:03] obtained part of this
[47:05] ministry the part of that Judas
[47:08] obtaining among the 12 and then lost was
[47:12] neither inferior to the Ministers of the
[47:15] other 11 ministries of the other 11 nor
[47:18] was it a devilish foreign Ministry
[47:20] interjected among the ministries of the
[47:23] others acts
[47:25] 1:25 he that he may take part of this
[47:29] ministry and
[47:31] apostleship from which Judas by
[47:33] transgression fell that he might go to
[47:37] his own place Judas a devil lost a
[47:58] out think about
[48:01] that that's
[48:05] incredible
[48:07] anointed
[48:09] chosen to to to uh work miracles the
[48:16] blessings of the Lord was was seemed to
[48:19] be on him he was the treasurer of the
[48:22] church he was he no one would have ever
[48:25] suspected
[48:27] but Jesus I said the father knows them
[48:31] that are
[48:33] his now I want us to really think about
[48:36] that
[48:39] now some of us look at the at the at the
[48:43] um those who have left the message and
[48:47] we wonder about these things and we
[48:50] sometimes we ask why we don't understand
[48:53] God fornew it
[48:57] and God has to have a Judas in this day
[49:03] to try to kill what God has given
[49:08] us but it will be the elect of God
[49:12] that'll have no other grounds no other
[49:16] recourse but to follow thus sayeth the
[49:20] Lord there is
[49:23] revelation that has already birthed in
[49:25] that predestined ated seed of God when
[49:29] when the 70 came that now now now they
[49:31] were all anointed the 70 were with the
[49:33] 12 they were all anointed to lay hands
[49:36] on the sick cast out Devils brother bom
[49:38] says they were right there but what
[49:40] happened when Jesus said except you eat
[49:42] my flesh and drink my blood now they
[49:46] automatically just started saying you're
[49:48] a vampire you you're you're wanting us
[49:50] to be a vampire you want what what's
[49:51] going on here and and and and the Bible
[49:55] says who
[49:57] who can follow this saying this is too
[49:59] hard we and the scripture says they
[50:03] followed him no
[50:06] more and then Jesus turns around to to
[50:09] the
[50:11] elect Jesus turns around to the
[50:14] 12 and the
[50:16] 12 he says will you go also and then
[50:20] Peter says where could we go for thou
[50:25] Hast the words of eternal
[50:28] life you you see that but even now the
[50:32] 120's G or the or the the 70s gone now
[50:35] it's down to 12 and even the 12 in that
[50:39] little bitty Church of Jesus's that was
[50:41] left after the church split and
[50:45] now there is still even one there was
[50:49] one left there and it was Judas and he
[50:52] would betray him but you see it required
[50:56] that
[50:57] it required that according to the
[50:59] scripture and according to the prophecy
[51:02] and this is so important today don't get
[51:06] disillusioned when you when you hear all
[51:09] of these guys listen I I
[51:12] I the the they're
[51:15] Liars those guys are liars that get out
[51:19] there and tearing down this message
[51:21] they're they're they're uh and and
[51:23] they're getting rich off of this kind of
[51:25] stuff they're and and and and they and
[51:27] they love that kind of a deal stick with
[51:31] what God gave you as the elect and don't
[51:35] follow anything else in fact don't even
[51:39] click on that internet with all of that
[51:40] junk I promise you they are
[51:43] lies right now now brother we we had a
[51:48] precious family that came here for a
[51:49] while that were a black family and uh
[51:52] and and so they they came here and and

[52:28] I'm going whoa whoa whoa whoa where
[52:31] where where where are you getting that
[52:32] oh there
[52:34] quotes and of course I already knew what
[52:36] they were talking about I said well I
[52:38] tell you what let's look at your quotes
[52:40] and then we will go and look at the look
[52:44] at the uh read the quote themselves so I
[52:48] took my computer and I read so where he
[52:52] was where brother Brandon would talk
[52:54] about he was an in uh um se
[52:58] segregationist he was talking and
[53:01] talking about God was a segregationist
[53:03] he was talking about the world and the
[53:05] church that you got to be separate so
[53:08] they would take these quotes and they
[53:11] were splicing these things together and
[53:13] I go read the thing and I said now does
[53:16] that sound like anything that you just
[53:18] read and they're going
[53:21] um no and then on the blacks so here
[53:24] we'd go and we'd read it see they they
[53:27] are
[53:28] deceivers that are making brother
[53:30] brandham look like he was a
[53:33] racist I don't believe a word those
[53:37] yellow bellies have to say they hide
[53:39] behind their computers and they put that
[53:42] stuff on the internet and and and people
[53:45] follow that kind of junk but it must
[53:49] happen it's got to take place are you
[53:54] understanding God allowed them to to be
[53:56] anointed allowed them to sit Among Us
[53:59] allowed them to even be
[54:02] preachers and anointed them in doing
[54:05] that you see what I'm saying but they
[54:08] end you know there there was four
[54:10] crosses we talk about the three crosses
[54:12] but there were four crosses man a cross
[54:14] is made of made of tree and and and
[54:17] there was there was Jesus then there was
[54:20] the that there was the thief that was
[54:22] making fun of him and telling him hey if
[54:24] you be if you be the Messiah get us off
[54:27] of here and then there's the third one
[54:29] that says hey this man has done nothing
[54:31] this is a good man and he's saying
[54:36] hey I know who you are I'm asking that
[54:39] you remember me when you come into your
[54:42] kingdom and then there was the fourth
[54:44] one that was Judas that went and hung
[54:46] himself on a sycamore tree from the
[54:48] guilt but his name was taken off of that
[54:52] book of life it was never on the Lamb's
[54:55] Book of Life so I just wanted to
[54:57] parallel that as we look at at our I
[54:59] want you to see how important this this
[55:04] part of the church age book is so that
[55:06] we don't ever get confused about what
[55:10] where everything is all Christian see we
[55:13] look at those things as we go all right
[55:17] now um now let's let's look on down here
[55:20] it says um let's see where was where
[55:22] were we
[55:24] at all right so we're we're on page
[55:27] 269 and the first uh the the the first
[55:31] paragraph now before we pursue this
[55:34] thought on Judas let us go to the Old
[55:37] Testament and see where God did the same
[55:40] thing in Genesis 35 23 to 26 the sons of
[55:45] Jacob were 12 in number and their names
[55:49] were as follows Reuben Simeon Levi Judah
[55:54] issachar Ze
[55:57] Joseph and Benjamin Dan and nefeli Gad
[56:02] and
[56:03] Asher these 12
[56:05] sons uh Sons descendants become the 12
[56:09] tribes of of Israel which with the
[56:13] exception that Joseph did not have a
[56:14] tribe named after him for in the
[56:17] Providence of God Providence of God
[56:19] there were to be 13 tribes and Joseph's
[56:23] two sons were given the honor of
[56:26] bringing the 12 to
[56:28] 13 you know of course this was necessary
[56:32] as Levi was separated unto God for the
[56:36] priesthood thus we when Israel left
[56:40] Egypt and God gave them the Tabernacle
[56:42] in the wilderness we find the tribe of
[56:44] Levi ministering to the 12 tribes named
[56:48] Reuben Simeon isachar Judah zebulun
[56:52] Benjamin Dan nefeli Gad Asher Ephraim
[56:55] and man
[56:57] the order of the host uh of the host
[57:01] names uh them thus in new uh numbers 10
[57:07] 11-28 there is no mention of Joseph or
[57:10] Levi but when we look at Revelation 7
[57:14] 4-8 where it says there were sealed
[57:18] 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[57:21] children of Israel it names them thus
[57:24] Judah Reuben Gad Asher navelli manessa
[57:29] Simeon Levi ishar zebulun Joseph and
[57:33] Benjamin we are back to the 12 tribes
[57:36] with Levi and Joseph named among them
[57:39] but Dan and Ephron are
[57:42] missing the question now arises why are
[57:45] these two tribes deleted the answer lies
[57:48] in Deuteronomy 12:16 to20 for ye know
[57:52] how uh we have dealt in dwelt in the
[57:55] land of Egypt
[57:56] and how we came through the Nations
[57:58] which by which which ye passed by ye
[58:01] have seen their Abominations their Idols
[58:03] wood and stone silver and gold which
[58:07] were among them lest there be uh should
[58:10] be among you man or woman or family or
[58:13] tribe whose heart turneth away this day
[58:17] from the Lord Our God and go to serve
[58:19] the Gods in of these nations lest there
[58:22] should be among you a root that beareth
[58:25] Gul and wormwood and it come to pass
[58:28] when he heareth the words of this curse
[58:31] that he bless himself in his heart
[58:33] saying I shall have peace though I walk
[58:36] in the imagination of my heart to add
[58:39] drunkenness to thirst the Lord will not
[58:42] spare him but then the anger of the Lord
[58:45] and his jealousy shall smoke against
[58:48] that man and all the curses that are
[58:52] written in this book shall lie upon him
[58:54] and the Lord shall blot out his name
[58:57] from under Heaven herein is pronounced
[59:00] the curse against idolatry or spiritual
[59:02] fornication the tribe that turned to
[59:06] idolatry was to have his name blotted
[59:09] out the history of the two tribes whose
[59:12] names were blotted out because of
[59:14] idolatry as found in First Kings 1225
[59:17] to30 then jeroboam built sheam in Mount
[59:22] Ephraim and and dwelt therein and went
[59:25] out from then and built panu and
[59:28] jeroboam said in his heart now shall the
[59:31] kingdom return to the House of David if
[59:33] this people go up and do sacrifice in
[59:35] the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then
[59:38] shall the heart of the people turn again
[59:39] to their lord even unto rabor the king
[59:42] of Judah and they shall kill me and go
[59:46] again to reaborn King of Judah whereupon
[59:49] the king took counsel and made two
[59:52] calves of gold and said unto them it is
[59:55] too much for you to go up to Jerusalem
[59:58] Behold thy Gods o
[1:00:00] Israel which which brought thee out of
[1:00:03] the land of Egypt and he set the one in
[1:00:06] bethl and the other he put in Dan and
[1:00:10] this thing became a sin for the people
[1:00:14] went to worship before one even unto Dan
[1:00:18] Hosea 46
[1:00:20] 47 Ephraim is joined to Idols let him
[1:00:24] alone isn't that something now
[1:00:27] particularly that the punishment for
[1:00:29] idolatry was the name of that tribe was
[1:00:33] to be blotted out from under the heaven
[1:00:36] Deuteronomy 29 and 20 it does not say
[1:00:39] that it would be blotted out in heaven
[1:00:42] but from under Heaven that is exactly
[1:00:45] how it is for now Israel is back in
[1:00:49] Palestine and soon the Lord will seal
[1:00:52] 144,000 of them but from that number an
[1:00:56] and Ephraim are
[1:00:58] missing man am I reading too fast is
[1:01:01] this just this this is interesting how
[1:01:02] the prophet brings this out Revelation 7
[1:01:06] 4-8 I heard the number of them that
[1:01:09] which were sealed and there were
[1:01:13] sealed uh
[1:01:15] 44,000 of all the tribes of Israel the
[1:01:18] children of Israel of the tribe of Judah
[1:01:21] were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of
[1:01:23] Reuben were sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[1:01:26] of GAD were sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[1:01:28] of Asser was were sealed 12,000 of the
[1:01:32] tribe of Napalm were sealed 12,000 of
[1:01:36] the tribe of manessa were sealed 12,000
[1:01:38] of the tribe of Simeon were sealed
[1:01:39] 12,000 of the tribe of Levi were sealed
[1:01:42] 12,000 of the tribe of iscar was sealed
[1:01:44] 12,000 of the tribe of zabulon were
[1:01:47] sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Joseph
[1:01:49] were sealed 12,000 of The Tribe of
[1:01:51] Benjamin were still 12,000 note Dan and
[1:01:54] Ephraim are missing now thi with this
[1:01:58] see Daniel 12 And1 which refers to these
[1:02:03] 144,000 being sealed during The Sixth
[1:02:06] Seal and the time of the Great
[1:02:08] Tribulation or Jacob's trouble and at
[1:02:11] that time shall Michael stand up and the
[1:02:15] the great Prince which standeth for the
[1:02:17] people of thy children uh or the
[1:02:19] children of thy people and there shall
[1:02:21] be a a time of trouble such as never was
[1:02:25] since there was a nation even to the
[1:02:27] time the same time and at that time thy
[1:02:29] people shall be delivered everyone that
[1:02:33] shall be found written in the
[1:02:36] book however after the period of
[1:02:40] tribulation during the Millennium as
[1:02:43] seen by Ezekiel in in 48 1-8 and 229
[1:02:49] 29 we see the tribes back once more in
[1:02:53] divine order but from the time that
[1:02:55] ephra
[1:02:56] and Dan joined themselves to the idols
[1:02:58] they died and those tribes were no more
[1:03:01] have no more recognition now I realize
[1:03:04] that since the destruction of Judah all
[1:03:07] records of all tribes have been lost so
[1:03:10] that no one can say for sure what what
[1:03:14] the what tribe he is from but God knows
[1:03:18] that great God who was bringing Israel
[1:03:21] back to Palestine knows exactly which
[1:03:24] tribe every true Israelite is from and
[1:03:28] from all the
[1:03:29] assembled 144,000 Dan and Ephraim will
[1:03:33] be missing here are the tribes of Israel
[1:03:36] Ezekiel 48 1-8 and 22- 29 now these are
[1:03:41] the names of the tribes from the north
[1:03:43] end to the coast of the way of hethin as
[1:03:46] one goeth to hameth haenan the border of
[1:03:50] Damascus northward to the coast of
[1:03:52] hammoth for these are his uh his sides
[1:03:55] East E and West a portion for Dan and
[1:03:58] the border of Dan from the East side and
[1:04:01] to the West Side a portion for Asher by
[1:04:04] the border of Asher from the East side
[1:04:06] unto the West Side a portion for
[1:04:09] naali uh and by the border of napali
[1:04:12] that from the East side to the west side
[1:04:15] a portion for Manasseh and the border of
[1:04:18] Manasseh from the East side to the west
[1:04:20] side a portion for Ephraim and by the
[1:04:23] border of Ephraim from the East side
[1:04:25] even unto the West Side a portion for
[1:04:27] Reuben by the border of Reuben from the
[1:04:30] East side unto the West Side a portion
[1:04:33] for Judah by the border of Judah from
[1:04:37] the East side and the West Side Etc
[1:04:40] moreover from the PO possession of the
[1:04:43] Levites and from the possession of the
[1:04:45] city being in the midst uh of that which
[1:04:49] is the princess between the border of
[1:04:52] Judah and the border of Benjamin shall
[1:04:55] be the prince before the prince as for
[1:04:57] the rest of the tribes from the East
[1:04:59] side into the West Side Benjamin shall
[1:05:01] have a
[1:05:02] portion by the Benjamin of by the border
[1:05:04] of Benjamin from the East side into the
[1:05:06] West Side Simeon shall have a portion
[1:05:09] and by the border of Simeon from the
[1:05:10] East side into the West Side isachar a
[1:05:13] portion by the border of is isar from
[1:05:16] the East side unto the West Side zebulun
[1:05:19] a portion by the border of zebulun from
[1:05:22] the East side unto the West Side Gat a
[1:05:24] portion by the border of GAD unto at the
[1:05:28] South Side uh Southward Etc another
[1:05:33] illustration that we might take in the
[1:05:35] story of Israel leaving Egypt for Canaan
[1:05:38] land God's purpose in this age was to
[1:05:42] bring Israel out and to take them in to
[1:05:46] the end that they might serve him thus
[1:05:49] when they left Egypt they all came out
[1:05:52] uh under the blood of the sacrificial
[1:05:54] lamb they all went through the waters of
[1:05:57] baptism in the Red Sea they all joined
[1:06:01] the mighty Miracles all ate of the Mana
[1:06:04] all drank of The Rock and and in so far
[1:06:08] as obvious external blessings and
[1:06:10] manifestations were concerned they all
[1:06:13] partook in like and equal manner but
[1:06:15] when they come to Moab those who joined
[1:06:18] in the Feast of bpor all died their
[1:06:22] carcasses fell in the wilderness for it
[1:06:24] was there they refused the word of God
[1:06:27] and turned from it now this is what
[1:06:30] Hebrews 6 1-9 speaks of which was
[1:06:33] brought out so carefully in the pergam
[1:06:35] manian age you can't go along with just
[1:06:39] part of the word you have to take all
[1:06:42] the word there are people who seems
[1:06:46] involved in the things Almost
[1:06:49] 100% they're like Judas no one but Jesus
[1:06:53] knew exactly what kind of a person Judas
[1:06:55] was so the day came that Judas did
[1:06:58] exactly what Israel did at bore he
[1:07:02] decided he wanted to join with the false
[1:07:04] Vine forces enter into financial and
[1:07:07] political organization of anti- word
[1:07:10] Antichrist religion and he did so he was
[1:07:13] foed the other 11 were not they could
[1:07:16] not be for they were of the very elect
[1:07:20] and when Judas left and betrayed the
[1:07:22] Lord his name was removed from the book
[1:07:25] of of Life Revelations
[1:07:28] 229 amen isn't that quite a
[1:07:32] reading now how how powerful it is how
[1:07:36] the Lord says he would blot his name
[1:07:38] from under the heavens but when they
[1:07:42] come back in the Millennium they'll be
[1:07:44] back so so he's he's showing us how that
[1:07:48] God how God works in those things amen
[1:07:51] how how many wants to read another
[1:07:52] couple more pages
[1:07:55] all right we'll let's read a couple more
[1:07:57] pages
[1:07:59] here um it says now I'm sure that you
[1:08:03] have noticed that those whose names were
[1:08:06] in The Book of Life were part of the
[1:08:09] religious order of that day that
[1:08:12] centered around the true God and worship
[1:08:15] of him and though though they did not
[1:08:18] worship according to truth word like
[1:08:22] Judas they didn't go all the way see how
[1:08:24] Judas was chosen of God he was
[1:08:26] instructed in truth he shared knowledge
[1:08:29] of the Mysteries he had the a Ministry
[1:08:32] of power granted unto him he healed the
[1:08:35] sick cast out devils in jesus' name but
[1:08:39] when The Showdown came he sold out for
[1:08:42] Golden political power he did not go up
[1:08:45] to Pentecost to receive the spirit of
[1:08:46] God he was devoid of that Spirit of the
[1:08:50] spirit make no mistake about it a person
[1:08:52] that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost
[1:08:54] into the body of Christ Christ receiving
[1:08:56] the fullness of the spirit will be in
[1:08:58] the word all the way can I hear an
[1:09:01] amen that is the evidence of being
[1:09:04] baptized with the Holy Ghost Judah
[1:09:07] failed Judas failed multitudes fail
[1:09:10] right there when they fail to go on in
[1:09:14] that word their names are taken off the
[1:09:18] book of life in order to further clarify
[1:09:23] this removal of a name from the book of
[1:09:25] life we ought to extend our thoughts to
[1:09:27] Israel in the days of
[1:09:29] Moses uh Exodus 3230 through 34 it came
[1:09:34] to pass on the tomorrow that Moses said
[1:09:36] unto the people you have sinned and a
[1:09:39] great a great sin now I will go up unto
[1:09:43] the Lord per avention he will make an
[1:09:45] atonement for your sin Moses returned
[1:09:47] unto the Lord and said oh this people
[1:09:49] have sin great sin and have made them
[1:09:52] gods of gold yet now if thou wil forgive
[1:09:56] their sins and if not blot me I pray
[1:10:00] thee out of thy book which thou Hast
[1:10:03] written and the Lord said unto Moses
[1:10:06] whosoever hath sinned against me him
[1:10:10] will I blot out of my book therefore now
[1:10:13] go lead the people unto the place which
[1:10:16] I have spoken unto thee behold my angel
[1:10:18] shall go before thee nevertheless in the
[1:10:21] day when I visit I will visit their sin
[1:10:24] upon them
[1:10:26] it is more than evident that the names
[1:10:29] have been and will
[1:10:31] be removed from the book of life air
[1:10:34] time shall be no more in this particular
[1:10:38] place it was because of
[1:10:41] idolatry even as when Dan and Ephraim
[1:10:44] lost their rights as tribes for
[1:10:46] worshiping the golden calves all who
[1:10:49] worshiped the idols had their names
[1:10:52] removed from The Book of Life
[1:10:55] when Israel rejected the leadership of
[1:10:57] God in the pillar of fire and turned to
[1:11:00] worship the golden calves their names
[1:11:03] were removed from The Book of Life
[1:11:06] Exodus 32:33 whosoever has sinned
[1:11:10] against me him will I blot out of my
[1:11:15] book if such turning to Idols demands
[1:11:18] the penalty of the removing of names
[1:11:20] from the book of life then most
[1:11:23] assuredly Israel's reject of Jesus
[1:11:26] Christ as Messiah would demand as severe
[1:11:29] a penalty that is this is exactly so in
[1:11:33] Psalm 69 which sets the forth the
[1:11:36] humiliation of Jesus it says in verse 21
[1:11:40] to 28 they gave me a Gul for my meat and
[1:11:44] in my thirst they gave me vinegar to
[1:11:46] drink let their tables be come a snare
[1:11:50] before them that which should be uh
[1:11:53] should have been for their welfare let
[1:11:55] it be a become a trap let their eyes be
[1:12:00] darkened uh and that they see not and
[1:12:03] their loins continually to shake pour
[1:12:06] out thine indignation upon them let thy
[1:12:09] wrathful anger take hold of them let
[1:12:12] their habitation be desolate let none
[1:12:15] dwell in their tents for they persecute
[1:12:19] him whom thou Hast smitten they talk uh
[1:12:23] to the grief of those whom thou Hast
[1:12:26] smitten add iniquity under their
[1:12:28] iniquity let them not come into thy
[1:12:31] righteousness let them be blotted out of
[1:12:34] the book of the living and not be
[1:12:37] written with the righteous when the Jews
[1:12:39] rejected Jesus there was a literal
[1:12:42] turning away from God from them to the
[1:12:46] Gentiles acts 13:46 to 48 then Paul and
[1:12:51] Barnabas waxed bold and said it was
[1:12:54] necessary for the word word of God uh
[1:12:57] that the word of God should first have
[1:12:58] been spoken to you but seeing ye have
[1:13:01] put it from you and judge yourselves
[1:13:04] Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn
[1:13:07] to the
[1:13:08] Gentiles for so hath God commanded us
[1:13:11] saying I have set thee to be a light of
[1:13:14] the Gentiles and that thou shouldest be
[1:13:18] for salvation unto the ends of the Earth
[1:13:21] and when the Gentiles heard this they
[1:13:22] were glad and glorified the word of the
[1:13:25] the Lord and this and and as many as
[1:13:28] were ordained to eternal life
[1:13:31] believed this is not to suggest there
[1:13:34] will be no more names from the tribes of
[1:13:36] Israel remaining in the book of life for
[1:13:39] many of those but not multitudes have
[1:13:42] the principles of election uh through
[1:13:45] the principles of election will be in
[1:13:46] the Gentile Church age and come into the
[1:13:48] body of Jesus Christ showing that their
[1:13:51] names did indeed remain in the Book of
[1:13:53] Life and also as we will show according
[1:13:57] to the fifth seal multitudes of martyred
[1:14:01] Jews will be given white robes and
[1:14:04] eternal life by the Lord and also the
[1:14:07] 144,000 will be sealed at his coming
[1:14:10] proving that their names were not
[1:14:12] deleted
[1:14:13] neither uh either but it is even uh as
[1:14:19] most accurately set forth in Psalm 69
[1:14:22] that it is the wicked or unrighteous
[1:14:24] reject of Christ that destroys uh and
[1:14:28] the Destroyers of his people whose names
[1:14:30] are
[1:14:31] removed as Israel chosen people of God
[1:14:34] in majority forfeited their rights in
[1:14:36] the Book of Life by rejecting Jesus so
[1:14:39] the majority of the Gentile church will
[1:14:42] also come into condemnation with the
[1:14:45] resultant removal of their names from
[1:14:47] The Book of Life by rejecting the word
[1:14:50] and thereor thereby entering into the
[1:14:54] word the world ecumenical movement which
[1:14:57] is the image
[1:14:59] erected to the
[1:15:01] Beast now we're going to stop right
[1:15:03] there tonight now there is a lot to chew
[1:15:06] on there and I know I know that's a
[1:15:09] that's a big reading but I wanted to get
[1:15:10] there
[1:15:11] tonight and and brother brandham is
[1:15:13] going to continue to deal with this and
[1:15:15] he's going to
[1:15:16] show he's he's going to show um
[1:15:21] how that the Book of Life
[1:15:25] is the record of the wheat
[1:15:28] plant okay so he's he's fixing to go go
[1:15:32] into it he's going to say so the Book of
[1:15:33] Life had these names in each of the
[1:15:37] ages there had to come
[1:15:41] justification there had to come
[1:15:44] sanctification there had so he says
[1:15:46] those those names that were written in
[1:15:49] that book of life was for a specific
[1:15:53] purpose amen and there yes there was
[1:15:56] elect in each one of those ages so but
[1:15:59] those denominations were carrying the
[1:16:02] seed to the next age to the next to the
[1:16:05] next state so that there would be a
[1:16:09] bride who would take the full word amen
[1:16:14] and be raptured in this
[1:16:16] age that is incredible he had a purpose
[1:16:22] Judas had a purpose the Bible says that
[1:16:25] God raised up pharaoh to show himself
[1:16:29] strong on Israel's behalf and God brings
[1:16:34] these up to show himself strong amen
[1:16:38] there's fixing to be a bride and a
[1:16:40] Rapture and I say here tonight Lord help
[1:16:43] me help me to to to keep my garments
[1:16:47] pure and spotless let me walk let me
[1:16:52] walk with God Amen as as as he wants his
[1:16:56] uh wants me to walk with him can you say
[1:16:58] amen amen and so uh I so I'm thankful
[1:17:02] for that here tonight I I'm thankful for
[1:17:04] the power of God's uh Eternal Word here
[1:17:08] here in this age all right any any
[1:17:10] questions now I know there was a lot of
[1:17:11] reading but but as everyone pretty well
[1:17:14] understand brother Bram showing showing
[1:17:16] that that uh uh using the Old Testament
[1:17:20] scriptures and uh to show what what this
[1:17:24] book is even
[1:17:25] today any anyone have anything they want
[1:17:28] to say or have any questions here
[1:17:34] tonight only one
[1:17:38] question praise the
[1:17:41] Lord
[1:17:43] hallelujah well I'm glad that that God's
[1:17:48] got my name written in the Lamb's Book
[1:17:51] of
[1:17:52] Life how do I know I have the Holy Ghost
[1:17:55] I want to be in the word all the
[1:17:58] way want to be in the word he says the
[1:18:01] the only the Holy Ghost filled will want
[1:18:03] to be in the word all the way Lord help
[1:18:06] me to be in the word all the way amen
[1:18:10] don't let nothing nothing hinder me
[1:18:13] don't oh God let me let me be pleasing
[1:18:17] to you let me serve the purpose for
[1:18:20] which you have called me
[1:18:22] for amen all right tonight no no
[1:18:25] comments no questions
[1:18:28] tonight amen I told you he was going to
[1:18:30] get in some good stuff there I I love
[1:18:32] that part of it it it really this here
[1:18:35] really opens
[1:18:37] up the and we're going to see it because
[1:18:40] brother Bram goes just beautifully in
[1:18:43] this uh and and and talking about how
[1:18:47] that uh the end the end product is for
[1:18:51] the seed to come through the seed the
[1:18:53] seed's the only thing that goes in the
[1:18:54] WAP the rest of it just dies off amen
[1:18:57] yes they had their names in that book
[1:18:59] but then it was it when when they
[1:19:00] refused to go any further they were died
[1:19:03] off then the next group would come in
[1:19:04] and when they refused to go any further
[1:19:06] the names were taken out they go on up
[1:19:09] next name you know then then then they
[1:19:11] were blotted out of the out of the book
[1:19:14] but it's for a purpose because there is
[1:19:16] a seed that's written in the Lamb's Book
[1:19:19] of Life That's predestinated to a
[1:19:21] Rapture and we're going to make that
