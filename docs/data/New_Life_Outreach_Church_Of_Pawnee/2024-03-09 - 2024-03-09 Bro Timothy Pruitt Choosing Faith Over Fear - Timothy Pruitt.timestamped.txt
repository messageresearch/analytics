[41:16] verse one amen it's good to be together
[41:19] once again we had just a wonderful time
[41:22] in the Lord last night and I tell you

[41:27] and amen as they say I'm looking forward
[41:29] to get good her and gooder and good amen
[41:32] and just want to say that I'm thankful
[41:35] amen that my wife was able to come my
[41:37] daughter Katie and several from our
[41:40] church and and we appreciate them coming
[41:43] means a lot to a guy when people from

[41:48] but uh anyway we're thankful Amen to the
[41:51] Lord for all that he's done for us and
[41:53] and uh amen for the opportunity to ser
[41:56] serve him in this time that we're living
[41:57] in what a blessed people we are amen I
[42:01] wanton you just turn to somebody and say
[42:02] I'm
[42:03] blessed I'm blessed amen amen Psalms 23
[42:07] and verse one it says the Lord is my
[42:10] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[42:13] to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth
[42:16] me beside the Still Waters he restoreth
[42:19] my soul he leadth me in the paths of
[42:22] righteousness for his name's sake yay
[42:25] though I walk through through the valley
[42:27] of the shadow of death I will fear no
[42:29] evil for thou art with me thy rod and
[42:33] thy staff that comfort me thou preparest
[42:37] a table before me in the presence of my
[42:40] enemy thou anointest my head with oil my
[42:44] cup runneth over surely goodness and
[42:47] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[42:51] life and I will dwell in the house of
[42:53] the Lord forever amen we let let you be
[42:59] seated last night I would come into the
[43:01] service and sit down and begin to sing
[43:05] and the Lord begin to deal with me on a
[43:08] thought for this this morning and as
[43:11] brother brother Michael if he'd go and
[43:13] grab my iPad there on the little machine
[43:16] there run up to the there and he went
[43:18] and grabbed it for me and I sat in the
[43:19] back and Lord just begin to pour these
[43:21] things in my heart and I believe it's
[43:24] something that he has special for you
[43:25] this morning amen I I like to speak to
[43:28] you on choosing Faith over fear choosing
[43:32] Faith over fear it says in Hebrews
[43:34] chapter 11 now Faith is the substance of
[43:37] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[43:40] Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[43:43] good report through faith we understand
[43:46] that the worlds were framed by the word
[43:48] of God so that things which are seen are
[43:52] which are seen were met not made of
[43:54] things which do appear and I I want to
[43:57] read that in the Amplified if you don't
[43:58] mind it says now Faith is the Assurance
[44:01] or the title deed or the confirmation of
[44:04] things hoped for that are divinely
[44:07] guaranteed amen the evidence of Things
[44:10] Not Seen the conviction of the reality
[44:13] of their reality Faith comprehends this
[44:16] fact which cannot be experienced by the
[44:19] physical senses for by this kind of
[44:23] Faith the men of old gain Divine
[44:25] approval
[44:26] for by faith that is the inherent trust
[44:30] and enduring confidence in the power and
[44:32] wisdom and goodness of God we understand
[44:35] that the worlds this universe the Ages
[44:38] were framed and created formed put in
[44:41] order equipped for their intended
[44:43] purpose by the word of God so that that
[44:46] which is seen was not made out of things
[44:49] which are visible Amen in other words
[44:52] God didn't take something that was
[44:54] already here and speak this word or or
[44:56] bring this world into into into into
[44:58] fruition but he actually spoke his word
[45:01] when there was nothing amen and there
[45:04] was nothing there was a void there was
[45:06] an emptiness and he just said let there
[45:09] be and from that word amen this world
[45:12] that we see today exist amen I I I've
[45:15] said it like this before I believe in a
[45:17] Big Bang Theory but I believe the bang
[45:19] was let there be and the word brought
[45:22] forth amen manifestation of what was
[45:24] inside of his heart
[45:26] and and I began to think about all these
[45:28] Hebrew Heroes of Faith and amen why were
[45:30] they called Heroes of Faith because they
[45:33] chose Faith over fear amen they chose to
[45:37] believe when no matter what they saw
[45:39] they no matter what they felt what
[45:41] circumstances were they chose Faith you
[45:44] know faith will either uh fear will
[45:46] either paralyze your faith or your faith
[45:49] will paralize your fear amen you know in
[45:52] Hebrews chapter 11 they're called
[45:54] Hebrews of Heroes of Faith Faith because
[45:56] in spite of what they saw in spite of
[46:00] what they felt in spite of their
[46:02] circumstances that were surrounding them
[46:04] they believed amen you know Faith finds
[46:07] a source that others can't see amen you
[46:10] know we've been given this on this Earth
[46:12] five senses to contact this world that
[46:14] we're living in see taste smell feeling
[46:16] here and every one of them no doubt has
[46:18] probably used all of them this morning
[46:20] amen when we got up and we begin to see
[46:22] that it was sun shining we begin to feel
[46:24] the Rays and amen begin to smell the the
[46:27] air that was the fresh clean air and all
[46:30] the things and feel the breeze Upon Us
[46:32] amen we used all of those senses but
[46:35] when it comes to the supernatural amen
[46:37] that's not what that's not the S that's
[46:39] not the things you depend upon Amen to
[46:42] determine if the Supernatural is there
[46:44] or not because the Supernatural is there
[46:46] whether you feel it or not whether you
[46:48] see it or not whether you whether you
[46:51] whe whether any of these senses declare
[46:53] it amen the Supernatural is still there
[46:56] because God is still in our midst as we
[46:58] heard last night God is here whether you
[47:01] feel him or whether you see him or
[47:03] whether whether anything is declaring
[47:05] out of your body that he's here God is
[47:07] still here why because his word says he
[47:10] is and that is where Faith rest is upon
[47:13] the word of God you know Faith doesn't
[47:15] rest in what somebody told you or or
[47:17] what some man told you or what some
[47:19] Minister told you Faith rest upon the
[47:22] word of God Amen I'm not healed because
[47:25] some man said I'm Healed I'm Healed
[47:28] because the word says I'm Healed I'm not
[47:30] delivered because some man said I'm
[47:32] delivered I'm delivered because the word
[47:35] said I'm delivered amen this is where we
[47:37] got to put our faith that's where we got
[47:38] to put our trust it's not in our
[47:40] feelings not upon some some man's ideas
[47:43] or what they can say but on the word of
[47:46] God because the word of God is still be
[47:49] there when your feelings are letting you
[47:51] down the word of God will still hold you
[47:53] when your feelings are washed away amen
[47:55] when the word of God will still stand
[47:57] there when all the circumstances is
[48:00] against you that word will still remain
[48:03] true this is why he gave us something we
[48:05] can depend upon amen I'm looking here
[48:07] this morning I see the earth I see the
[48:09] skies I see the sun what's a very spoken
[48:12] word of almighty God and you didn't get
[48:15] up this morning worrying if the sun was
[48:17] going to come up you knew inside your
[48:19] heart that son's going to come up why
[48:22] cuz there was a word that said let there
[48:24] be light and that word is still in
[48:27] manifestation today thousands millions
[48:30] of years later it's still performing
[48:32] what God said he would do Hallelujah
[48:36] Faith amen is a six sense Faith you know
[48:38] the five senses are fine as long as they
[48:41] don't de disagree with the six
[48:44] sense but when there's a disagreement
[48:46] you always take the six
[48:50] Sense come on Amen see faith is the
[48:54] substance of things hoped for not you
[48:56] don't maybe you don't see it maybe you
[48:58] don't taste it maybe you don't feel it
[48:59] maybe you don't smell it maybe you don't
[49:01] hear it but you know it why cuz Faith
[49:03] declares it so amen it's so sure that
[49:06] it's real it becomes a substance to it
[49:08] not imagination it's something that you
[49:11] have and in faith there's no reasoning
[49:14] to it Faith knows what it's at Faith
[49:16] acts Faith holds on it won't move
[49:19] nothing can move it I don't care
[49:21] whatever says this or whoever says that
[49:23] it doesn't move it a bit it'll stand
[49:26] right there am man say wait wait just a
[49:28] minute that don't make a difference
[49:29] it'll stay right there what is faith
[49:32] faith is something that is revealed to
[49:34] you that you not know you may not know
[49:37] yet but you believe it anyhow amen faith
[49:40] is a revelation of the will of God what
[49:43] is the will of God the word of
[49:45] God Amen if you want to know the will of
[49:48] God look to the word of God cuz the word
[49:51] of God is his
[49:54] will he amen amen faith is a very amen
[49:59] something that's precious to PE ought to
[50:01] be precious to you amen cuz there's a
[50:03] lot of what people in this world but
[50:04] there's a lot of people that don't
[50:07] believe amen Luke chapter 18 and verse
[50:09] one if you'll turn there he said he
[50:11] spoke a parable unto them to this end
[50:13] that men ought to always pray and not
[50:15] faint and there was a city that was in a
[50:18] city saying in there was in a city a
[50:20] judge which feared not God neither
[50:22] regard regarded man and there was a
[50:25] widow in that City and she came unto him
[50:27] saying avenge me of my adversary and he
[50:30] would not for a while but afterward he
[50:32] said within himself though I fear not
[50:34] God nor regard man yet because this
[50:37] Widow troubleth me I will avenge her
[50:39] lest by her continually come and she
[50:42] weary me and the Lord said hear what the
[50:44] unjust said unjust judge said he shall
[50:48] and shall not God avenges on aect which
[50:51] cried day and night unto him though he
[50:53] bear along with him I tell you that he
[50:56] will avenge them speedily nevertheless
[50:59] when the son of man cometh shall he find
[51:02] faith on the earth amen listen to what
[51:05] and I I understand people put that off
[51:07] to to to when he returns and that that
[51:10] that is true amen when he comes back
[51:12] will he find Faith but I I if you look
[51:15] at what he's talking about he said it is
[51:17] a need this woman had and she's asking
[51:20] for the for the him to come and provide
[51:22] for this need I don't know what her need
[51:24] was but she was crying out to him we
[51:27] heard it on the first night amen crying
[51:29] out to him how do you cry not why you
[51:31] speak the word of God God you said this
[51:34] God your word says this it said this in
[51:37] your word you said you would never leave
[51:39] me you said you would never be there you
[51:41] would always be there you would be my
[51:43] comforter amen you cry out to him by the
[51:45] word he said but notice he didn't say
[51:48] will I find righteousness will I find
[51:51] churches will I find holy people will I
[51:54] find faith when when I
[51:56] come amen so if you've been here asking
[51:59] for something when he comes will he find
[52:02] you still in
[52:04] faith you've been asking for the Holy
[52:07] Ghost you've been asking for needs in
[52:09] your body but when he comes will he find
[52:12] you still knocking will he find you
[52:15] still asking will he find you still
[52:18] seeking in faith believeing he's
[52:22] coming he's moving on my behalf he's
[52:25] here to meet my need will he find faith
[52:28] in other words faith is going to be
[52:31] something that's very
[52:35] precious what what makes something
[52:37] precious that not a lot of people have
[52:40] it how many he's got a how many he's got
[52:42] a a a wedge of gold right
[52:47] now no no I don't see very many people's
[52:50] got that what makes gold so precious cuz
[52:52] there ain't a lot of
[52:54] it if it was just out there on the
[52:57] ground everywhere it wouldn't be so
[52:58] precious no more amen but what causes
[53:01] people to seek after why because it's
[53:03] precious and and faith is something
[53:05] that's very precious because there's not
[53:07] a lot of it in the age that we're living
[53:10] in there's not a lot of people that
[53:12] believe there's there's not a lot of
[53:14] people that believe you know we're
[53:15] getting to the point that very PE very
[53:17] few people even believe in
[53:22] God even believe that this world we
[53:25] living was created amen by higher
[53:28] intelligence they don't even want to
[53:29] admit that they they don't want to admit
[53:31] that there's a God you know they don't
[53:33] they want don't want to believe in those
[53:35] things so but if will he find somebody
[53:38] that's got enough Faith to believe no
[53:41] matter what circumstances they're
[53:43] facing he's going to have somebody
[53:46] that's going to stand by
[53:49] themsel amen they may not have a lot of
[53:52] kids around them to pump them up and
[53:54] they may not have somebody there to
[53:56] always encourage them but their faith is
[53:58] not built on if somebody calls them if
[54:01] somebody texts them if somebody picks
[54:03] them up their faith is in the word of
[54:07] [Applause]
[54:12] God he said that's the way you want you
[54:14] want to get something from God be on his
[54:18] hands every morning every night every
[54:20] day all the time listen asking for the
[54:23] Holy Ghost is not a dry confession
[54:26] amen is getting down to business with
[54:28] God saying God if you don't come and
[54:30] fill me with the Holy Ghost you'll find
[54:32] a pile of balls laying here why there's
[54:35] something on the inside that wants to
[54:37] contact
[54:39] [Applause]
[54:40] God Lord I'm here I'm not going to leave
[54:43] I'm on your hands I'm going to stay hey
[54:45] you you getting tired of listening I'm
[54:46] having a great time
[54:49] knocking cuz why I know you're coming
[54:53] when that's when something happen he he
[54:55] has to get you off his hands so he comes
[54:57] out to answer you and faith is standing
[55:00] there to receive see faith is anchored
[55:02] on the word of God if God said it it's
[55:06] going to come to pass no matter what the
[55:09] symptoms are what the issues are what
[55:12] the circumstances are what how much
[55:14] unbelief is in the land it's going to
[55:17] come to
[55:19] pass unbelief you know relies on
[55:23] reasonings Faith don't L on reasoning
[55:26] Faith looks at the word but Faith places
[55:29] itself upon an unmovable Rock God's
[55:31] Eternal Word Faith don't look at
[55:37] reasons Faith ain't looking at reasons
[55:39] why I don't get called or why I don't
[55:41] get text or
[55:42] [Music]
[55:45] why amen why nobody loves
[55:48] me I use one of brother Jewel's favorite
[55:51] that saying wowy wowy Woos this ain't
[55:54] the service for your wowy wowy
[55:58] Woos it's a service you repent of your
[56:00] wowy wowy Woos amen because why should
[56:04] you be wowy wowy wooing when God came
[56:07] and he created this Earth for your
[56:09] benefit he created all the things around
[56:11] you for this benefit why should you be
[56:14] in your wowy wowy wounds when God not
[56:16] only chose you he didn't choose you
[56:19] right here he didn't choose you 5
[56:21] minutes ago but he chose you before the
[56:23] foundation of the world and will not
[56:25] change his mind about
[56:31] you Hallelujah I might change my mind
[56:34] about you you might change your mind
[56:37] about me but God won't change his mind
[56:39] if God saw you as a son you'll always be
[56:42] a son you'll always be a daughter it
[56:45] doesn't matter what the devil says it
[56:48] doesn't matter what he does it doesn't
[56:50] matter how he htks it doesn't matter how
[56:52] much weary spirits and depression he
[56:54] tries to put on you you're still a son
[56:57] you're still a daughter you're still a
[56:59] child of the
[57:01] King open the door and let that wowy
[57:04] wowy woo Spirit
[57:06] [Applause]
[57:14] out well I ain't never had a minister
[57:16] give me a word you don't need a minister
[57:18] to give you a word you need to believe
[57:20] the word of
[57:23] God
[57:27] come on now we get our faith in what
[57:30] some man
[57:32] says well if I could just get somebody
[57:35] to tell me what's wrong with me you know
[57:38] what's wrong with
[57:42] you how to forget the faith to rise
[57:45] above it amen Faith finds the word it's
[57:48] a sanctuary of rest it moves right up
[57:50] into that Eternal Rock and lays down and

[58:05] is on the
[58:08] word why you think brother Andrew's been

[58:27] we got so many people that have wanted
[58:29] to stop brother brother Andrew talking
[58:31] about you know questions start
[58:35] Rising but they're not always honest
[58:40] questions and I just got a few questions
[58:43] another the reason why you got questions
[58:44] because there's sin in your
[58:49] heart people say well I just don't I
[58:51] ain't going to believe in that Prophet
[58:52] thing and I ain't going to believe that
[58:53] next thing you know they ain't believing
[58:54] in in Jesus they ain't believing in God

[59:44] Holiness well I tell you what that's
[59:46] just brother Andrew's opinion that's

[1:00:01] me wearing shorts down here and the girl
[1:00:02] having a dress down here and he had
[1:00:04] that's his brother bram's opinion what
[1:00:06] do you think about it I'm well if you

[1:00:41] opinion could it be that if the angel of
[1:00:44] God influenced that opinion he was in
[1:00:47] his presence night after n after n day
[1:00:50] after day after day so if that was
[1:00:53] influences his opinion what's
[1:00:55] influencing

[1:02:15] days but I'll raise it up again amen why
[1:02:19] where was he bringing that from from the
[1:02:22] word I'll not see my holy going to see
[1:02:24] corruption listen the the Mind battles
[1:02:27] was listen Jesus had mind battles he had
[1:02:31] mind battles he he had such mind battles
[1:02:33] that blood would come out of his skin he
[1:02:35] would sweat
[1:02:40] blood we all going to have
[1:02:43] one but where do you go back to when
[1:02:46] you're in the middle of
[1:02:48] that well I just don't feel it no
[1:02:52] more you're not always going going to
[1:02:54] live in a camp meeting
[1:02:58] feeling you're not always going to live
[1:03:01] with all of these Believers all around
[1:03:03] you you can make it amen hallelujah
[1:03:06] glory to God no you're going to get in
[1:03:08] places by
[1:03:15] yourself yay though I walk I don't I did
[1:03:18] not hear where it said me and a group of
[1:03:20] young people
[1:03:22] walked David wasn't walking with a bunch
[1:03:25] of people was by say yay though I
[1:03:28] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:03:31] death I'll fear no evil why cuz he's
[1:03:34] with
[1:03:36] me when I'm by myself he's with me when
[1:03:39] I'm at a camp mean he's with me if I'm
[1:03:41] in Walmart he's with me wherever I am he
[1:03:45] promised he would be
[1:03:49] there so this is where you got to put
[1:03:52] your faith
[1:03:58] you're not always going to feel the
[1:04:00] feeling you're feeling right
[1:04:04] now do I got some older Christians out
[1:04:06] there can say Amen to that you're not
[1:04:08] always going to
[1:04:10] feel all the rejoicing and all the
[1:04:13] praising brother Timothy I want to be
[1:04:15] happy this morning you will be don't
[1:04:19] worry but I'm trying to tell you you're
[1:04:22] not always going to be in these places
[1:04:27] but that don't mean you can't have
[1:04:31] faith because the word of God's the same
[1:04:33] whether it's at a camp meeting or it's
[1:04:36] in the high hardest trial of your
[1:04:39] life the word of God is the same whether
[1:04:41] you're on the Mountaintop or in the
[1:04:43] valley am that's what he told he heard
[1:04:45] the enemy say one time bring them on
[1:04:47] down into The Valleys cuz he's the god
[1:04:49] of the mountain but he ain't God Of The
[1:04:50] Valleys he said I heard what he
[1:04:53] said he said I'll bring them on down cuz
[1:04:55] I want him to know I am the god of the
[1:04:58] mountain but I'm also God in the valley
[1:05:00] he's want you to know this morning I am
[1:05:03] God in a youth camp but I'm also God in
[1:05:05] your bedroom I'm also God when you don't
[1:05:08] see nothing and it's all dark around you
[1:05:10] I'm still
[1:05:23] God Hallelujah I read you some meet I
[1:05:25] read you about a meeting that took an
[1:05:27] after meeting that took place okay Jesus
[1:05:29] and his disciples had been in a
[1:05:31] wonderful meeting blind were healed all
[1:05:33] kinds of things were taking place in
[1:05:34] Mark chapter 4:35 the same day even when
[1:05:38] evening was come he said unto them let
[1:05:40] us pass over into the other side now if
[1:05:43] they had have listened to what he said
[1:05:44] they wouldn't have worried about what
[1:05:45] happened before they got to the other
[1:05:50] side amen it's just like the children of
[1:05:54] Israel if they have listened to what he
[1:05:55] said I'm going to take you out of Egypt
[1:05:57] but I'm going to take you into a land
[1:05:59] flowing with milk and honey if they had
[1:06:01] just had faith in what he said they
[1:06:03] wouldn't have worried about the Red Sea
[1:06:04] they wouldn't have worried about bitter
[1:06:06] Waters they wouldn't have worried about
[1:06:07] no food they wouldn't have worried about
[1:06:08] no water they wouldn't have worried
[1:06:10] about the desert they would have just
[1:06:12] stayed with the word of
[1:06:16] God so if had to listen to what he said
[1:06:18] and believe what he said they wouldn't
[1:06:20] have worried about it and if you would
[1:06:22] just believe what he said he said I'm
[1:06:24] the author and the
[1:06:27] finisher so he's not going to get
[1:06:29] halfway in between and forget how to
[1:06:31] take care of his
[1:06:34] people maybe I need to say that one more
[1:06:36] time he's not going to get halfway or
[1:06:38] almost all the way or seventh eights
[1:06:41] away and forget how to take care of his
[1:06:45] people he will take care of
[1:06:48] you he will be with you that's what he
[1:06:52] promised I'll be with you even in you to
[1:06:55] the end of Youth
[1:06:59] Camp I'm glad he didn't put that in
[1:07:03] there but he said to the end of the
[1:07:07] world woo I like that right there let me
[1:07:11] just take it for what he said to the end
[1:07:14] of the world to the end of cancer to the
[1:07:16] end of sugar diabetes to the end of
[1:07:18] depression to the end of fear to the end
[1:07:21] of anxiety I will be with you you even
[1:07:25] in
[1:07:31] you but they get in this ship and Jesus
[1:07:34] rests he goes to
[1:07:36] sleep he's weary been in a big
[1:07:42] meeting
[1:07:43] oh and he was in the hinder part of the
[1:07:46] ship asleep on the pillow and There Rose

[1:07:50] beat the ship and now it was full
[1:07:55] they done bailed all they could out it
[1:07:58] was going down
[1:07:59] boys and they remember wait a minute
[1:08:02] there's somebody in the
[1:08:03] ship see sometimes you get in the middle
[1:08:06] of a storm and you forget cuz we're not
[1:08:08] listen brother Ram preached two things
[1:08:09] he preached about those that went off
[1:08:11] without
[1:08:12] Jesus and he came walking on the water
[1:08:14] and he preached about those that went
[1:08:16] with Jesus and they forgot he was in the
[1:08:20] ship we ain't went off without Jesus but
[1:08:24] sometimes we get in the middle of a
[1:08:26] storm and we forget he's still in the
[1:08:32] ship he's still
[1:08:34] here and they walk and master cares not
[1:08:37] that we perish and he rose and rebuke
[1:08:39] the wind and said un the sea peace be
[1:08:43] still and the wind ceased and there was
[1:08:45] a great form a calm and he said to them
[1:08:47] why are you so fearful how is it that
[1:08:50] you have no faith you done seen Miracles
[1:08:55] you didn't seen signs and wonders you
[1:08:57] didn't seen the miraculous you didn't
[1:08:59] seen all these things how is it still
[1:09:02] you don't have
[1:09:06] faith see doctors say well you know
[1:09:09] that's paralysis or that's leukemia or
[1:09:12] that's cancer and fear sets
[1:09:15] in fear accom accompanies these
[1:09:19] words but it but listen to the prophet
[1:09:21] of God he says but it shouldn't
[1:09:26] who is this that made the
[1:09:28] promise what are we living for why are
[1:09:32] we the Church of the Living God why are
[1:09:35] we filled with the Holy Ghost to
[1:09:37] remember in times of trouble he is
[1:09:44] here to remember in times of trouble he
[1:09:48] is here amen he is with us just to say
[1:09:52] he might be resting a few moments
[1:09:54] between meetings but he's still here
[1:09:56] just to say when trouble sets in and
[1:09:58] Faith of him being with us then fear
[1:10:00] sets in and when fear sits in that's
[1:10:03] when we really get in
[1:10:06] trouble we have that in church all and
[1:10:09] in the Nations and everywhere he said
[1:10:10] are scared to death about an atomic bomb
[1:10:13] and you know science has developed
[1:10:14] mechanical things at any moment without
[1:10:16] warning the whole world can go into
[1:10:18] pieces and the world is
[1:10:21] scared he said I'm not scared of the
[1:10:23] world go into pieces because I know
[1:10:25] there's going to be a thousand years of
[1:10:26] Millennium Reign after all this is over
[1:10:29] God won't defeat his own purpose amen

[1:30:42] cure for anxiety there is a cure for
[1:30:45] depression there is a cure for every
[1:30:48] devil in
[1:30:50] hell
[1:31:01] let's go to what cures the fear
[1:31:03] Deuteronomy 3:18 I commanded you at that
[1:31:06] time saying the Lord your God has given
[1:31:09] you this land to possess it you shall
[1:31:11] pass over armed before your brethren the
[1:31:13] children of Israel all that are meat for
[1:31:15] war but your wives your little ones your
[1:31:17] cattle for I know that you how much
[1:31:19] cattle shall abide in your cities which
[1:31:21] I have given unto the Lord has given you
[1:31:23] rest unto your brethren as well as unto
[1:31:26] you and unto they also possess the land
[1:31:28] which the Lord your God has given them
[1:31:30] beyond the Jordan and then shall you
[1:31:32] return every man into his possessions
[1:31:34] which I have given you and I commanded
[1:31:37] Joshua at that time saying thine eyes
[1:31:39] have seen all that the Lord your God has
[1:31:42] done to these two
[1:31:47] kings so just pick out two of the fears
[1:31:50] out of these two kings so shall the Lord
[1:31:53] do to
[1:31:55] all so shall the Lord do to all the
[1:31:58] kingdoms whether thou
[1:32:00] [Applause]
[1:32:01] passes and ye shall not fear them for
[1:32:05] the Lord your God shall fight for
[1:32:09] [Applause]
[1:32:15] you ye shall not fear
[1:32:20] them
[1:32:24] Deuteronomy 31:6 says be strong and of
[1:32:27] good courage do not fear nor be afraid
[1:32:29] of them for the Lord your God he is the
[1:32:32] one who goes with you he will not leave
[1:32:34] you or forsake you Psalms 34:4 said I
[1:32:38] sought the Lord and he heard me and he
[1:32:40] delivered me
[1:32:42] from all my fears a do
[1:32:50] Z
[1:32:54] amen but you have to choose
[1:32:57] Faith you got to choose to believe you
[1:33:00] got to choose to
[1:33:02] trust and in the middle of our struggle
[1:33:05] we forget he helps we forget he's the
[1:33:09] deliverer so we try to wrestle it all
[1:33:11] out and figure it out on our own and all
[1:33:13] along God is waiting and ready to hear
[1:33:16] our
[1:33:17] cry for
[1:33:19] help help me Lord
[1:33:22] that's all he
[1:33:23] needs you need him this morning all you
[1:33:26] got to do is have that sincerity in your
[1:33:28] heart help me Lord help
[1:33:31] me Psalms 563 says whenever I am afraid
[1:33:36] I will trust in
[1:33:40] you oh yeah you're going to get afraid
[1:33:42] but you can still
[1:33:44] trust fears I'm not trying to say that
[1:33:46] fears will be no more when you leave
[1:33:48] this Youth Camp I'm trying to say that
[1:33:50] you have power over the fear fear you
[1:33:52] have the ability to choose to believe
[1:33:54] choose to trust choose to say God is
[1:33:57] God amen amen choosing faith is choosing
[1:34:01] to trust God no matter
[1:34:05] what it's not that everything will be
[1:34:08] perfect and everything's a bed of
[1:34:10] roses for some of you better not be a
[1:34:12] Bed of Roses cuz you're afraid of
[1:34:16] flowers better roses or everything will
[1:34:19] work out just fine and Danny and hun
[1:34:21] Dory no you're going to go through
[1:34:24] trials you're going to go through
[1:34:26] problems and troubles and many
[1:34:28] difficulties read about The Heroes of
[1:34:34] Faith some were didn't even wouldn't
[1:34:36] their names wouldn't even mention but
[1:34:37] they were swn
[1:34:38] aunder they gave their
[1:34:41] lives amen it's in the moment of fear we
[1:34:46] should know where to turn
[1:34:48] to it's not turning to Google
[1:34:54] it's not a three-step
[1:34:56] process it's not a book or a mentor that
[1:34:59] you turn to or even a
[1:35:01] friend and I'm not saying friends can
[1:35:03] help you during hard times sure but the
[1:35:05] first thing you need to turn
[1:35:08] to is the word of
[1:35:13] God Psalms 23 as we read in verse four y
[1:35:17] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:35:18] shadow of death I will fear no no evil
[1:35:23] for you are with me your rod and your
[1:35:25] staff they Comfort it sometime we Face
[1:35:27] the hardest the darkest the scariest of
[1:35:29] all trials it might look like suddenly
[1:35:32] sudden some sudden tragedy or some some
[1:35:35] diagnosis or something we wouldn't we
[1:35:36] couldn't ever imagine or some family
[1:35:38] crisis we didn't see
[1:35:41] coming but God saw it
[1:35:46] coming hello
[1:35:50] somebody God God saw it
[1:35:56] coming it's even in the darkest of times
[1:36:00] God can guard and he can carry you
[1:36:03] through
[1:36:04] it when we feel like God is absent or we
[1:36:08] feel like he doesn't care we can still
[1:36:11] rest on the truth of his word even in
[1:36:14] the dark even in the shadow of death God
[1:36:19] is still there
[1:36:22] he's near he's ready for you to reach
[1:36:24] out and take a hold of his
[1:36:26] hand he's not so far that you can't you
[1:36:29] can't reach him he's there he's with you
[1:36:33] we heard it so beautifully last night
[1:36:35] he's here Isaiah 41 and verse 10 says
[1:36:38] fear not for I am with you be not
[1:36:40] dismayed for I am your God I will
[1:36:43] strengthen you yes I will help you I
[1:36:45] will uphold you with my righteous right
[1:36:50] hand
[1:36:52] God's hand in scripture is very
[1:36:53] beautiful you know we talk about having
[1:36:55] faith in God and and we see God's hand
[1:36:57] in every situ we talk boy did you see
[1:36:59] the hand of God there did you see the
[1:37:00] hand of God there but it's in the middle
[1:37:03] of this hand there's an instruction
[1:37:05] given fear
[1:37:08] not the question you might wonder is I
[1:37:11] see his hand but how is he going to help
[1:37:14] me how do we fear not when everything
[1:37:17] arounds us is calling for questions
[1:37:20] calling for fear calling for doubt the
[1:37:24] answer is to focus your eyes off your
[1:37:27] fears and back on your
[1:37:31] God Amen there's more for you than there
[1:37:35] is against
[1:37:38] you I can promise you there's more

[1:37:53] there's more trust than there is
[1:37:56] worry there's more peace than there is
[1:38:00] anxiety there's more joy than there is

[1:48:08] drop it and it'll be
[1:48:10] broken they don't sweep it up and throw

[1:48:17] using a technique that uses
[1:48:19] gold and they have found that the broken
[1:48:22] vessel fixed with gold is worth more
[1:48:24] than the original
