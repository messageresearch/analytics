that we are unto him amen I I'm a firm believer that the greatest thing you'll ever do is give your all to Jesus Christ and one of my favorite quotes is the prophet of God saying that there was a said there was a reason I didn't give my heart to God at a younger age he said there was a spirit hung over me telling me just wait a little while longer he said but there was a God that was there waiting for me and he said the only thing had to happen was that Spirit had to be broken and he said then I could go out yonder and fully believe he was my savior and you know tonight I don't think there's a better thing we can do than allow the Holy Spirit to break Spirits over our lives that'll give us a liberty to go out yonder and believe God don't you amen how many say Lord I want to give you all of my life everything I am I Surrender it unto you amen let's just bow our hearts together tonight Heavenly Father Lord as these Believers have gathered here this afternoon Lord we're not gathered here

here says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of Life put away from thee a forward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee amen I love what he says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life in St John chapter 7 in St John chapter 7 and verse number 38 Jesus here is just speaking at the great feast and in St John 7 and verse 38 he says some very powerful words I believe that if we'll receive them tonight will'll be a real blessing to us he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow somebody say shall flow now that is a promise church if you'll believe on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water amen out of his belly shall flow Rivers not of stagnated water but rivers of Living Water Well we ask the Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight if I would take a title I want to speak to you on this for a few moments here unclogging the channels of our heart unclogging the channels of our heart 1961 brother BR preaches a sermon called getting in the spirit he said now we got the people just clean out the channel how many believes that we've got the people he said just clean out the channel see the people's all right but get the channels cleaned out so the Holy Spirit can come in see all your fanaticisms and it the thing out brother brandom is not just saying something to be saying it but he's saying it on purpose that we have the people amen but what we need is the Holy Ghost we have the abilities and we have all the uh the things that someone would think we would need to have a church we have all that but what we need is the Holy Spirit to find a right away Amen to come into what we have and to manifest himself in the power amen of his word now I believe tonight that the word of God is in the church how many believes the word of God is in the church and I believe amen that the word will produce amen exactly what God promised it would produce if we can just get it amen in the right kind of a heart how many knows the Bible says amen that God desires a clean heart he desires amen a Sanctified heart he desires S A Heart That is not full of Filth or defilement or the things of the world the prophet of God said like this he said I seen not long ago where they went into the Garners of Egypt and they got some wheat that was put in there about 2500 years ago or more than that about 3,000 years ago it was put in there by Joseph and some of the weed had been laying there for all those years and it had been planted in the ground and it produced again he said no no matter how long this gospel lays here amen 2,000 years we've had m ERS and scoffers and same the days of Miracles is passed amen but if you put that word in the right kind of a heart it'll produce again exactly amen like it did in the first time amen because it's the word of God see it's got to come into a Channel of faith and as long as it laid in the Garner it didn't need nothing it was just staying there as a memorial folks I don't believe that God is Desiring the revelation of his word amen to just stand in our churches as memorials or just as statues or just how God used to move or how God used to do things but I believe this is the season where God is looking amen for Honest Hearts the prophet of the holy spirit is here and he is hunting out Honest Hearts to believe the spirit's message I believe this is the time that God is looking amen for Honest Hearts Amen to sew his word into amen that they would produce the results that the word is promised promise to produce well when you start thinking about this how amen that every year we go from January to December and then those 12 months brother Kobe there's actually four seasons right amen there's a winter and then there's a spring and then there's a summer amen and then there's a fall now we are just coming out of winter and we're looking forward to Spring amen and when spring starts coming around amen we start talking about a spring cleaning you know amen but what what are we really talking about amen we're talking about a time to clean out the closet you know amen go through all the shelves in the garage and amen go through all the buildings out back what we're talking about amen is cleaning out and getting rid of Amen unneeded stuff and making room for new things now you all know that the natural amen types the spiritual and I believe if we have a natural spring cleaning amen I think we ought to have a spiritual spring cleaning I think what the prophet of God called it was an oldfashioned house cleaning amen where the fire of God would burn in the church and it would burn out everything that did not belong there amen it would burn out every sin and every unbelief and every misunderstanding and every every little problem and folks I believe that what the church needs amen is the fire of God to break out in the church again listen I think it's time to quit and getting so down on ourselves and amen ready to throw up our hands and quit amen the problem is we need to let the Holy Ghost clean out the channels amen and when the Holy Ghost begins to move amen he begins to remove unnecessary stuff and I I'll tell you what's unnecessary is bad attitudes amen I'll tell you what's unnecessary is our alts and amen bitterness and grudges and unforgiveness amen but what is necessary amen is the love of God that passes all understanding amen what is necessary amen is the ability to forgive and to forget and to move on Amen I love what David said in Psalms 19:12 he said who can understand his errors amen cleanse thou me from Secret faults amen isn't that powerful David is praying and he said oh God would you cleanse me amen from Secret faults amen I tell you sometimes that's what we need to do is pray like David amen and say Lord let the Holy Ghost amen be a discerner of the faults and the intents of my heart and let the Holy Ghost clean out all the sacred fault now come on we we we we can get a little religious here amen but I'll just say it very plainly there are still hum humans in the church and there still mistakes and there still sins and I think it's time to remember amen that we don't just need encouraging sometimes amen sometimes we need to repent and amen sometimes we need to ask God to forgive us and God to help us amen I think it's time to come back to preaching the repentance of the Gospel amen and make the church a place where the word of God can find a right way to bless a heart and to save a soul David goes on in his prayer and he says Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity amen and cleanse me from my sin sin he said behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me but watch what he said he said but oh God Purge me with hisp and I shall be clean amen wash me and I shall be whiter than snow in Psalm 799 help us oh god of our Salvation amen for the glory of thy name amen and Deliver Us amen and Purge away our sins amen for thy name's sake are youall reading what I'm reading amen David who is a man after God's Own Heart he found himself in a place where he said help me oh God you are the god of my salvation and for the glory of thy name amen Deliver Me Lord amen this is the man that said oh God Amen I don't want to hide my secret faults I don't want to hide my secret failures but you are the god of my salvation Lord I invite you Amen to come and look at my heart look at my life look at my soul amen read me like a book over God cuz I don't want to be found unworthy I don't want to be found bound amen when the enemy comes in I want to have a liberty to fight the enemy he said Purge away our sins amen I'll say what a prophet said he said I do believe in a Purgatory he said but I believe it's right now amen you purge your own soul he said what does purgatory mean amen it means to purge when you see you've done something wrong amen get out there and clean it out of you amen how do you do it he said by confession amen and crying and fasting and praying now I know it's become a it's become a moery among a lot of people to really get sincere before God but a prophet of God said amen the lord gave me a vision the other day and he said he showed me I had the power Amen to bind that serpent he said but someone even laughed at me amen at that Vision amen and said why would you step out like that he said that's what I wanted all my life he said but then I begin to fast and I begin to pray and they said well what did you do that for I said in there he said amen that I was not sincere enough now come on we're not talking about o Roberts or Billy Graham or Jack Cole amen we're talking about William Brandon folks we're talking about the seventh angel but the spirit of God told him amen somewhere in his life there was an area he was not sincere enough after he come he said then I wanted to purge myself amen not wait till you die and let some try some priest try to purge you amen he said but Purge amen your souls how many can say tonight Lord amen I want a good oldfashioned purging Lord amen I want you to purge my soul I want you to purge my heart I want you to purge my thoughts Lord amen I want you to purge my home I want you to purge my church I want you to purge my faith I want you to purge My Worship Lord from the top of my head to the souls of my feet oh God I am asking that the god of David amen would come into New Life Outreach by the power of the Holy Ghost and would purges from the pulpit to the back door amen restore unto me the joy of my salvation and renew a right Spirit within me oh God don't hide my secret faults don't run away from me God Amen but since you love me enough to come down would you purge me oh God I want to be right in your eyes brother Ram preached that message several times and he called it a door and a door and what he done was he took time to clearly identify to you amen that there are many doors in the heart of a human being amen the reason those doors are there amen is because God wants to gain access amen church God wants to gain entrance amen he said see there's the door of Pride he said there's the door of that private life amen there's the Door of Faith amen all kinds of doors in the door of the heart no wonder Solomon said amen keep thy heart with all diligence amen for out of it are the issues of Life brother said if there is an ALT in your heart against anyone amen go to them now that's a prophet church if there's an A in your heart against anyone go to them now and be reconciled amen and forget all the past and if you've been having ups and down life amen remember some something has come into your heart and something has moved into those thoughts something has come into your heart and something has moved into those thoughts no matter who your enemy is amen love him no matter what's happened let it go after all you're in a fi with weeds we realize that but we must grow together see we've got to come up together amen for a good wh amen cannot put forth evil Waters and neither can an evil wh amen put forth uh bad Waters or good Waters he said a tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit and good fruit at the same time he said so let's either make the whole well clean or let's make the whole well dirty amen one or the other amen church I think it's time to do what a prophet said either clean it up amen or just let it get filthier amen but ask for me in my house I am a Son of God and I have been given a right by the blood of Jesus Christ amen to repent of my sins amen to repent of my wrongs to repent of my mistakes and say Lord you said there was a propitiation Amen in the atonement for my sin listen can I say this you ain't got to Bear your head amen and let the well become dirty New Life Outreach I'm preaching to you you ain't got to Bear your head and let the well in this church become dirty there is a God in Israel tonight and his name is Jesus Christ and the minute you begin to call on him like David did he will come down in the power of His word in the power of His redemption in the power of His cleansing and change that dirty water to clean Hallelujah either let it be clean or let it be dirty for it's dirty to begin with listen it's all dirty preacher Deacon mama daddy musician evangelist whoever it's all dirty to begin with yes sir but listen the Lord pour your spirit in and Lead Me Oh God lead me I say this we're not drinking from a hybrid well we're not drinking from a hybrid whale you say what's a hybrid whale well it's mixed with clean and dirty water but we are drinking from an rtan well amen I'll say this we don't have to serve God halfway we don't have to be lukewarm we don't have to be cold we don't have to be formal there is a fire in the word of God he said see brother B said like this he said Jehoshaphat amen purposed in his heart to serve the Lord he said now what he done was he clinged to the things that his father David did at the beginning re said I like that amen at the beginning in other words he went back to the old landmark and then they cleaned out the roads listen David didn't say I'm going to keep going this way he said I'm going to go back Amen to the old landmark and it'd be good for Pentecost to go back to the old Landmark it would be good for all of us Amen to go back to the old Landmark amen and clean out the RS amen what would happen if actually this church went back to the old land mark you talk about it cleaning up there would really be one around here no matter how how many knows that's a true see amen there certainly would be amen a Reformation going on he said oh how people would be acting different they would be dressing different they would be talking different it would just be all together different see it would be a different church if we went back to the old Landmark he said where we started from listen I believe there's a possibility tonight amen for every member of this church amen to go I'm not preaching a sermon I'm preaching from a burden to go back to the old land mark Amen to go back to where the fire of God burned to go back to where the preacher preached the word and your seat couldn't hold you because there was such an expectation that go back to the place where the man of God studied and labored and he found the mind of God and he come out here and begin to preach and he come out here and begin to labor and there was something in your soul that said yes Lord amen be it unto me Lord I say oh God let us go back to the old Landmark where we used to fill up the altars and cry and snot to the devil turn loose I say let us go back to the old Landmark where the power of God used to shake us from the pulpit to the back door I tell you what there's a possibility tonight for every one of us to put our walking shoes on and go back to the old Landmark it ain't straight it's still there the pillar of fire is still with this church the anointing is still still available you ain't got to lay down and quit no sir you are a channel in the body of Christ remember said look there's many channels in the body of Christ why is that channel there because God is wanting to flow through you amen look at this word Channel it is a prepared route amen for something to pass through into something else it is a prepared route amen for something to pass through into something else do you see what

church but if there's a cog in there am then the Holy Ghost is going to get backed up somewhere but I come by with good news tonight there is a stick of dynamites in the house of God Amen to bow out every channel to bow out every channel to bow out every channel to bow out every channel until the Waters of God can break free in the church again and we can go from a dry perishing condition into a Revival of joy unspeakable and full of Glory yes sir God works through channels God prepares the channel and the devil does everything he can Amen to clog the channel channels become clogged which means they become blocked amen so that little or nothing can pass through do unclog something you know what you got to do you've got to remove come on folks you've got to remove the accumulated matter you got to you got to remove what's accumulated in there I say this I believe another word for unclogging could be Revival I believe another word brother Wendell for unclogging could be Revival Revival is to wash all the trash and the unbelief out and let the people come out he said night after night and see that God is still God think about that brother Merl brother random was preaching to people who had spiritual arteries clogged by Theology and by denomination and tradition and forms and religion and fashion amen but the prophet stood there and he said there's a chance for a spirit artery cleanse where you can come out here and you can see God is still God and His word is still true and his power is still here oh folks David said it like this search me oh God and know my heart amen I say what what the Bible says in Malachi 3 the Bible says I am the Lord and I change not can I tell you this tonight the Lord hadn't changed but we have amen the Lord hadn't changed amen but we have amen y'all forgive me tonight amen but I'm on fire amen I've been in the presence of God the Lord hadn't changed folks but somewhere we've changed somewhere we've let something whip us I say tonight is a not to be samard and say devil you've Whi me your last day you've Whi me your last service you with me your last second I am a son of Abraham and my Covenant says I shall possess the gates of the enemy and I'm not laying down I'm not backing up I'm not turning around I'm going to March out of here and some morning because I refuse I refuse to let the devil clog the channels in the body of Christ sometimes you got to blow them things out and let the Holy Ghost come back in there because the channel of God is always open the prophet of God said the channel of God is always open he said so there is a genuine Faith he said you must come into the real channel of God to have that genuine Faith do you know know this we will never find the channel of God without the mind of Christ but can I tell you what Paul said he said but we have we're not looking for but we have the mind of Christ he said listen here is the secret of it amen the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with his word that's why the devil hates you because you have the mind of Christ you have the ability Amen to acknowledge thus sayith the Lord oh church I tell you what the devil don't want to hear he don't want to hear thus sayith the Lord Brother I'm calling them four blast words amen thus sayith the Lord but you know what I say I say thus sayith the Lord there's a possibility for a breakthrough I say thus sayith the Lord there is a possibility for an oldfashioned altar call where the Holy Ghost can clean a man up oh thus sayith the Lord there is a possibility to go back to the old landmarks I ain't lost my mind I've got the word of the Lord amen and here's what a prophet said she performs the command of his word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord well Church in Genesis 4 you will find Cain and abble amen at the altar amen and the prop of God picked it up in Hebrews 11 and four and he said by Faith abble offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice and Cain by the which he obtained a witness that he was righteous amen God testifying of his gifts amen look and by it he being dead yet speaketh listen Cain was just as religious as abble was they both went to church they both paid tithes said they both worshiped they both made sacrifice he said but Able by faith which is the revelation of the word of God he revealed made plain soed out and Vindicated he said see amen by Revelation he found the true channel oh Hallelujah by Revelation he found the true Channel you say well my church is it you wait just a minute amen God interprets his own word by his terms that he spoke in see Cain said I am religious I am a lover of my maker I offer thee this fine Al altar I offer to you this sacrifice Lord I built all these things up but because I love you and Abel said the same thing now it's the one that's Vindicated and the one that's proven and God come down and received Abel's sacrifice because by Revelation he had struck the CH Chanel of God Amen that was accepted listen friends what brought him to that channel it wasn't a handshake amen it wasn't a new church it was the blood come on Church the blood brought Abel into a channel where his sacrifice could be accepted in the face of his brothers being rejected oh I say to you tonight the message of the hour has reopened the true channel of Revelation in the church and the devil's done everything he can Amen to clog it up with Theology and man-made theories and problems and situations but I say God opened up the channel of the prophetic gift in this generation by the Fulfillment and the interpretation of his word and there ain't a devil big enough come on Church there ain't a devil strong long enough there ain't a devil bad enough there ain't a devil ugly enough or strong enough Amen to stop the channel that God is open in the house of God God sent this prophetic gift to the bride of Christ that is a prophetic class of people who has a prophetic womb Amen to bring forth prophetic promises you say brother Andrew why do you preach like this because I believe what a prophet said about you I believe a prophet said he said more about you than your failures he said more about you than your mistakes he said more about you than your sins and than our unbelief and our oh come on church we might as well have church the prophet said more he said there is a blood and it's a powerful blood and it has the ability to wash a son and daughter of God and put them in position to bring forth the prophetic word in the hour they're living in listen I've got a prescription for you tonight amen how many wants a prescription I got one for you are you ready for it amen amen you're in the doctor's office amen and the doctor just told you all the problems and all the symptoms amen he's told you you got this and you've done that and you should have done this amen you got all the you got all the brother Austin you got all the symptoms there but are you ready for the prescription how many's ready for the prescription amen how many's ready for the prescription here it is amen who forgiveth all thine iniquities and health all thy diseases listen friends that is the prescription you say brother Andrew my sins his iniquities well my body Bible said we were born in sin we were shaping in iniquity amen what is Iniquity it's doing something you know you shouldn't do and you do it anyhow and I'll just go ahead and say it folks we have rocked to sleep in a cradle of predestination I think it's time to remember amen a predestinated seed amen will produce a predestinated life we can shout about predestination we can dance about election we can shout about for knowledge amen but somewhere we got to remember there's got to be some repentance sometime and say God I shouldn't have done that I shouldn't have been there I shouldn't have said that I shouldn't have looked at that I shouldn't have thought that but Lord you are able you are able as the god of David to purge me with hisp and make me white as snow Hallelujah you say preacher you lost your mind no I hadn't if he did that in the Covenant how much greater is the Covenant today if he did that under the type amen then what will he do Under the antitype you know what I begin to Believe Christian friend that we're just living in the beginning of the greatest time this world has ever witnessed I just believe that all the lines are getting unclogged woo that ought to make you put on your shout and shoes in the house of God we're living in a time where the lines are just getting unclogged you know clogged up with all kinds of doctrines and theologies and all kinds of stuff unbelief are y'all ready for this he said it's been handed down from generation to generation can I say this but somewhere it's got to stop amen somewhere it's got to die amen that lust devil that traced your great great grandfather and traced his son and traced his son and traced his son and it's trying to trace you Amen to a breakup I rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus there is a blood that is more powerful than a family curse there is a blood that is more stronger than things that have been handed down from generation unto generation there is a God in Israel tonight who has come down in this age to unclog the channels of our heart well somebody shout hallelujah somebody PR that devil out of the building somebody believe God for themselves amen I think it's time to push back brother Miguel I think it's time to say I will not I will not pass this to my baby I won't pass it to my grandbaby I won't pass it to another generation this devil dies here tonight oh there's no such a thing as healing the days of Miracles is passed he said what happens is we just automatically believe that we just automatically believe but it's come to a place where God not a man it's come to a place where God and not a man what are you saying I'm saying folks it's time to quit lying to yourself man can I have my Liberty and preach is that okay brother W brother BR said look the spirit of Truth has returned to let you know no can I say this the spirit of Truth has returned in this age to let you know you're not subject to the devil's lie any longer how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will lead you and he will guide you into all truth he will not speak of himself but he will show you things that is to come and John said it like this from what Jesus said he said ye shall know the truth Amen brother Mitch you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free come on Friends there's a difference in being set free and being made free you catch an animal in a trap and you set that animal free I'll tell you what'll happen something else will catch it but if you want to make that animal free amen you'll put it in a place it can never be caught again and I say to you tonight the blood of Jesus Christ has the ability to take a man and set him far above the principalities and the powers of this world oh Church come on somebody the blood has the power not to set you free but to make you free hey I don't think you just got to be set free for a few days after youth camp or a few days after fall meetings or a few days after a special Revival I say there's a Power in the Blood of Jesus Christ it'll make you free where you can look at that devil and say you'll never get me again Hallelujah there's a blood Church there's a blood where you can look at that devil and say devil this is your last day Hallelujah this is your last day brother so we minute times for years we got what we call a lie detector you put it on your wrist and set it across your head and you get in there and try to your best to make a lie sound like the truth it'll register negative every time because a human was not made to lie he said lying is a deceitful hard thing it's an evil thing no matter how much you try to impersonate and try to make a lie seem right they got a scientific instrument that proves that it's wrong and you can tell it with all the innoc since you want to but it's still going to register negative because there's a subconscious down in the human being and that subconscious knows what's truth and no matter what you're saying out here brother Josh that subconscious knows that it's a lie and it'll reg off of that subconscious why don't you take the word of God church and make it a lie detector and why don't you bring that lie before the word of God and let that thing die once and for alll come on folks why don't you bring it before the word and let it die one time you say how am I going to let it die I'll tell you how you going to let it die you're going to put it on the word and let the word rest through it a lie I don't care how innocent and how pretty you get that thing all concocted well my daddy was this and my mama was this and and I'm just trying to be the best I can and I can't overcome this and I can't ever be back and oh that's a lie folks but there's a y of them in the house of God there is a lie detector called the the word of God and when you start telling this word that bunch of hogwash it's going to speak out better things just like the blood of Jesus does it's going to say things like you never even done it in the first place it's going to tell you there is a sea of God's forgetfulness where the thing can be remitted and can be forgiven and can be thrown in the sea of forgetfulness never ever never ever ever to be remembered again there is a blood there is a blood folks there is a blood if a man or woman can ever get their thoughts and their testimonies and lives so lined up with God until the channel of the Holy Spirit would be perfectly one with God what would take place if a man or woman could ever get lined up there with the freedom from their hearts with Faith from the innermost listen many people come to the altar to be prayed for they have intellectual Faith they confess their sins and join a church by intellectual Faith they believe it in their mind they believe it because they heard it they believe it because they know it's the best policy but that's not what God looks at he don't look at your intellectual Faith he looks on the heart or on the inside God and when it comes from the heart all things are possible then your confession will meet up with your life and your life will speak as loud as your confession does but when your confession says one thing and your life lives another there's something wrong somewhere because you got an intellectual faith and not a Faith from from your heart amen and that's what shows the outside here is a knowledge of God but inside here is a demon of doubting let me say this one of Satan's favorite channels Amen to clog up folks is the channel of inspiration because he knows the word is always inspired no matter what I'm going through brother wend no matter what you're going through or brother Donald what you're going through sister Angie what you're going through the word is always is inspired can I say this to you brother Caleb there's never a second that the word is not inspired you do a favor for me okay take a second and split it down and break it down less than a second okay tell me later what it is I don't think you'll be able to amen it's so fast amen but can I tell you something the word is still inspired even in that little second are you hearing me in that little second the word is still inspired listen so what the devil does is the devil wants to clog the channel of your heart up to where you cannot receive the inspired word because when the two Inspirations comes together amen then you will see a result oh brother Kobe amen what could happen in this building tonight if we would let the Holy Ghost blow out the channel of inspiration in our hearts and we would say Lord amen from the corridors of Glory let the inspired word flow into this church I tell you what will happen it'll flow in your heart Josh it'll flow in your heart sister fresa it'll flow in your heart brother Caleb it'll flow all over this building and then we'll start seeing results we'll start seeing changes come but we got to say God let the Holy Ghost blow Alpha Channel Lord you say brother Andrew what are you saying well I'm going to say this in the Old Testament how many will agree we're in War Sir do you know in the Old Testament amen there was a war tactic you know what that war Tac IC was it was the enemy would come in and he would stop up all the water channels because the enemy knew if he could just cut the supply of water off then the people would die the enemy knew Hey listen if I can just get them dry if I can just get them in a dry spot if I can just get them all stickery and I can get them all upset and bothered with everybody and everything if I can just get them in a dry spot there will be the death kill there will be the the place brother Luke that he'll kill the church you know what I say I say we ought to refuse to remain in a dry condition we ought to refuse amen I'm just preaching to you from my heart I didn't come to impress you I come to help you we ought to remain in the presence of God we ought to say devil I refuse to become dry I refuse to become a sticker in the house of God I'll tell you what happens when a church becomes dry it becomes unfruitful come on come on the people still there but there's no water amen listen folks somewhere we got to say God bring back the water amen well it's just Wednesday night who cares if it's Wednesday night or Tuesday night or Sunday morning or Sunday night or Friday night the water Remains the water on Monday the same as it is on Sunday we just need the water of God to flow in the Church of God againu hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said for now they died all these Wells and they kept stopping them up but they come and remove fence and they died another well and they strove not and he called the name of it raob booth and he said for now the Lord hath made room for us isn't that powerful there's been a spring cleaning amen now the Lord hallelujah now the Lord has made room for us he didn't just make room for Moses he didn't just make room for the pastor he didn't just make room for the Evangelist he made room for every single one of them and we Shout be fruitful in the land listen folks there is water in the well amen there's a place of restoration there's a place of repentance there's a place of redemption and there's a place where the waters can flow again in the public utility if you don't pay the bill they'll cut the water off and you know what'll happen you'll dry up around the house he said that's what's the matter with God's people tonight they just didn't pay the price and God cut their water off that's all go to any Desert you want to that's reason some of you Full Gospel Church members and so forth don't believe in Divine Healing your water has been cut off but now notice that's the reason out in the desert and everything you come in contact in the desert it's got stickers on it I don't care if it's a little o leaf or whatever it don't fo with it it's got a sticker on it where there's no water it gets stickers now come on Saints where there's water the same plant will soften up and make Leaves so what they done was they found out that they was without water and when you're without water you're without life when there's no water there's no life so then they said well what can we do about it now let me say this the Holy Spirit deals in a spiritual manner we don't enter the spiritual things by fear but we enter them by faith Paul said that Timothy God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind amen the spirit of power the spirit of love and the spirit of a sound mind he said what we need then is a fresh baptism in and of the love of God listen folks Paul tells us there is Faith there is hope and there is Charity but the greatest of all is Charity amen I'll say this what we need is to allow the love of God to have the preeminence in the Church of God now I'll just go ahead and preach and I'm here I think it's time to quit seeing all the faults and failures and issues and picking nitpicking and gring amen I'll just say this Amen brother wend you can correct it when I'm gone amen I'll just say this I think it's time to love again amen I think it's time to love amen listen you don't want nobody judging you by your actions you want to be judged by your motives amen then why don't you return the same thing to somebody else Don't Judge Me by my actions Judge Me by motives this is what I meant to do and then somebody else oh God then somebody else makes a mistake and you done put them on a Hellbound train to Hell come on church but my Bible says that Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but Faith amen worketh by love listen folks you want to see more faith in the church get more love in the church amen faith is based on forgiveness now Paul says it like this he said that we would be grounded in love the prophet of God said we must approach God through that channel of love and faith I love what Paul or John says he said we have known and believed in in the love that God had to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him so there's the spirit of power Sister Jesse there's the spirit of love but then there's the spirit of a sound amen mind or what the Bible would call Spirit spiritual sanity and the Bible said this the Bible said they come to Jesus and and I believe in The Book of Mark the 5th chapter the 15th verse they come to Jesus and they see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion amen sitting en clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid now come on folks where was Jesus at when he found Legion he found Legion in the tombs do you realize Legion was a good man the Bible said he was brother brandham gave us some insight on his life and said he was a family man he was a hard worker amen he loved his wife and he loved his babies he said but he made a mistake and he said instead of coming home and making that thing is this all right instead of coming home and making that thing right you know what he said he said this he went in and told a lie and he said he went out the next day and he come back do you realize something brother Kobe Every Lie he told was matter accumulating in his channels Every Lie he told amen so clogged his channels up to the love of God had to pursue him in a graveyard are you hearing me folks quit underestimating the power of a devil don't you ever underestimate the power of a spirit listen to me spirits will take you places you never thought you would go demons will drive you places you never thought you would find yourself come on I'm just going to preach amen the devil drove him there because his heart got all clogged oh the pr of God said when I got outside Brother Moore said to me brother random that Maniac you had in his right mind after he got healed was going down the street acting like a maniac again running hard and screaming glory to God and everything I said well he was just clothed in his right mind then to worship see Jesus give him his right mind to worship he was crazy then to the people again because he had received his right mind listen when the channel got uncocked oh God when the channel got unclogged he could experience the love of God again he could experience the worship of God again he could experience the praise of God listen the Bible said that he had so scared his family that when he went home amen they ran and hid from himen I like that old song and then y'all probably heard at the Cathedral singing I ain't that old man no more amen ain't F old man no more amen why was he changed because he met Jesus and Jesus performed a spiritual heart surgery on the man and he was changed and there was a love of God flowing through his channels there was the inspiration flowing again what are you saying oh God I'm saying there's a chance it can happen again it can happen again I don't care how hard the arteries have become there's a possibility for the love of God and the peace of God there's a possibility for the waters to flow again we must allow we must allow the Holy Spirit to unclog the channel of Faith listen the devil loves to clog the channel of our purpose hear me now he loves to clog the channel of our Purpose with our failures he loves to do it sis he loves to clog the channels of our Purpose with the failures of our Humanity brother said what are we anyhow how do we get here what are we here for did you ever think of those things we are human beings what made us human beings what made us different from anything else on Earth as human beings listen folks I tell you what done it the purpose of God come on the purpose of God goes beyond amen our human purpose because the purpose of God brother Joe is an eternal purpose the purpose of God is irresistible I love this it is sure of fulfillment it is seen in his choice of instruments it is revealed in the gospel it is eternal in Christ I love this church and it is involving the overthrowing of Satan did y'all hear that the Eternal purpose of God Amen we ought to post that on our on our refrigerators is irresistible brother Merl it is sure of fulfillment it is seen in his choice of instruments it is revealed in the gospel it is eternal in Christ and it involves the overthrow of Satan when God chose you Samson he did not choose you to be defeated by the ones that he raised you up to defeat I love what Isaiah said the Lord of hosts is purposed and who shall disol it his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back Jeremiah says the land shall tremble in sorrow for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Babylon to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant my the Bible prophesied that when God got done with Babylon there wouldn't even be a person left to inhabit it the Bible prophesied when God got done with Babylon brother brother Miguel there wouldn't even be a Babylon and there wouldn't be nobody to inhabited there wouldn't even be nobody to rebuild it oh I feel like shouting right there church brother Ken I feel like shouting right there that God prophesied when I get done with you I'm going to destroy your enemies I'm going to destroy their complexes I'm going to destroy the Devil who pulled you into that failure who pulled you into that mistake there's not even going to be anybody left hallu hallelujah hallelujah I have appeared from thee under thee for a purpose Paul to make thee a minister and to witness now notice this we were created for a purpose to control to rule to praise God do you know the Bible said that we were made do you realize the Bible said this the Bible says we were made to be in the Dominion in the image of God you know what the problem of God said he said it like this he said man was made as a secondary God on the earth he was given power to control all things Adam was given these great Powers but then the power he was given to make yourself is where he fell now watch this Adam fell by freem moral agency and I'll just go ahead and say it it has caused us more trouble than we realize Adam could speak to the winds and it could stop he could speak to trees and they would obey him he said but now though the fall through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship and fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through all these channels brother sister has become clogged up now what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again Satan knows he will never defeat God so he is always attacking the closest thing to God he will never defeat the people of God but he's always attacking them because he knows they are the closest thing to God are you hearing me that's why if the devil can't get a preacher he goes after his wife and if he can't get his wife he goes after his babies and if he can't get his babies he starts going after his church because he's trying to find somewhere he can wiggle his way in and clog up the channel and stop the water from flowing in that church in other words all of the plumbing in the brain and the outlets and Faith had been clogged up with business Affair and home life and domestic things he said it's all become so clogged up that God can't operate through those channels that he made a man for but God so patterned the man the body of man then how much more has he patterned and set in order the body of Christ the church now you know what the prophet of God said the prophet of God said God has confidence in us he says there and reads a scripture where the Bible says in Colossians 2:15 and having spoed principalities and Powers let me just read can I can I can I have a few minutes here in Colossians 2:13 and you being dead and your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath be quickened together with him am I reading this right having forgiven you some of your trespasses having forgiven you a few of your trespasses having forgiven you a part of your no let's read it right folks having forgiven you all your trespasses come on Saints blotting out oh glory to God blotting out all the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross come on the will of God and the purpose of God is sure it is steadfast it is irresistible and it will be purpose and it will be Eternal and it will be fulfilled come on somebody help me and you know what else it'll do sister Tina it will overthrow the devil the purpose of God will overthrow the devil and Jesus said I will take your sins to Calvary with me I will nail them to the cross and I will spool principalities and powers and he made a show of them openly amen Trum over them in it that's the god of David hey Hallelujah glory to God that's the god of David that he saido not hide my secret faults Lord don't hide my secret faults God take them to the cross with you and nail them to the Cross make an open shame of them because you will spool their powers Hallelujah y'all forgive me it's all over me Hallelujah spooled the principalities and powers and made them a show openly and Triumph over them in it I tell you right now now if it's under the blood get your head above itl I said if it's under the blood get your head above it I ain't backing up to that devil if it's under the blood get your head above it if it's underneath the blood Church get your head above it he took it to Calvary and he spooled his power you know what that word spooled means it means disarmed it means disarmed when Christ died at Calvary he disarmed your enemy against you hallah come on Church your past ain't got a sword against you folks amen your mistakes ain't got a sword against you when God died he disarmed our mistakes he disarmed our failures he disarmed our shortcomings and the only thing that hum that hindered the human race today from being Superior and controlling like they did in the beginning is because the power line to the outlet of God man the human being has been clogged up but the Holy Ghost is here he said to pass through the human heart by faith once again it takes more than water baptism to unclog those channels Saints it takes the power Ephesians 4 there's a five-fold Ministry I'll just say it because it's pretty fitting to say it here there's a five-fold Ministry of electricians and they're wiring the spiritual building of the body of Christ and he said when you get to a place place you're perfectly wired and the master electrician has okayed it by sealing it with the Holy Spirit the only thing is just turn on the switch then and there'll be a light show or flow he's depending on us listen friends the Holy Ghost is looking for somebody who is willing to let loose can I can I just can I just say these things to you tonight the Holy Ghost is here he's here listen I've been on a series at home and I come out here today to preach that Series tonight not the whole thing but parts of it the the Holy Spirit dealt with my heart today and I'm just too dumb I'm I'm sorry I'm just dumb enough I know these things are simple and you probably think I'm crazy and you probably think I'm wild or whatever but I wish there was some way you could see my heart tonight the Holy Ghost is here he's here to open up the spiritual arteries of this church amen he's here sister Angie he's not coming he's here let's go back to the old Landmark shall we let's go back to that dedication meeting when the Holy Ghost spoke and I was preaching and said you say we got a lot of room amen it's for your family and she come to me today and said brother Andrew my family is sitting in the house

forgot about the day you was trying to get a parking lot built out here and the clouds were gathering over you and the rain was going to finish brother Randall and brother way from working but some

brother Andrew that's what has been this sayith the Lord make this Valley full of ditches May make this Valley full of ditches brother B said now he saw a vision and he seen the way out and he knew what to do he said instead of reading the Bible now I'm just going I'm just going to I'm just going to buckle down here and preach for a few moments cuz we didn't come this far to lay down and quit instead of reading the Bible we've been reading love stories instead of reading that we've been reading everything else all to be reading God's Bible on our knees praying for God to help us awaken in our soul and when he's seen how the way out he said the first thing I want you to do is go out here and make this Valley full of ditches dig just as hard as you can for thus sayith the Lord woo glory to God for thus saith the Lord I fail it on that one you will not see any wind there will not be any rain but this Valley but this church but New Life out Outreach but New Life Outreach but New Life Outreach but for Gonzales family but the Martin family but the Torrance family but the come on church but the Stout family Hallelujah come on I don't mean to leave anybody out but the Applegate family amen the whole church the fair weather family amen the whole the Green family amen the the Cochran family the whole church amen shall be full of water more more ditches more water Hallelujah you ain't going to see no wind you ain't going to see no rain then somebody tell me where is the water going to come from if there ain't going to be no wind and there ain't going to be no rain it's going to come from the smitten Rockall what did he see he saw a vision of that spiritual rock that Moses had already smitten and been speaking to and he just spoke to that rock and it was ready to pour forth a water when the ditches was made for it to run in and I say that same I'm going to say what a prophet said brother Kobe that same smitten Rock tonight is right here the deeper you dig the more water you'll get so what you have to do is make a way for it no matter how much preaching there is how many Visions there are the subject was then and the main principle was ready make ready for the water he said that's what you ought to do tonight is to make way for the Holy Ghost to pour down make it in your house make it in your church are you hearing me make it in yourself kick everything out of the way there's coming a gusher if you'll get ready for it if you don't make ready for it you'll never see it now it's up to the church tonight you got a nice tent here can I just say this you got a beautiful building here you got nice pews you got churches and seats and you got nice people and you got nice singing and we got a wonderful savior he said so it's time to lay aside everything every sin that does so easily beset you now notice when they begin to dig they had to dig right against things but they dug it brother and they just throw it out and brother Merl they made big ditches and the next morning the enemy looked down the sun come up and it looked like blood they said well they Fallen one another killed each other they were ambushed and they said this is just a light thing before the Lord sending forth as water and they went into the other land and they stopped up every well that cut and cut down every good tree they just had an oldfashioned Revival all right now let me let me let me just say this to you brother BR preaches a sermon and he calls it oh Lord just once more and he says there was a man and his name was Samson and I I just have to be honest with you this is not a condemning end time message it's a it's a it's a message of redemption it's a message of hope it's a message of help brother BR opens that entire sermon and says now I'm going to preach to you on the state that the church is in right now okay but I love what he says he says this and what possibilities lies ahead for it so he's not just going to tell you the condition you're in right now but he's going to tell you there's possibilities brother Jonah there's possibilities laying ahead for you a prophet told you there was you say preacher you've lost your mind have I really have I really there's possibilities just the other day sister te I was I saw a picture in my phone the first time I was ever here and you were here and we was over in Tulsa and I was carrying that little boy around right there little kyin all those years ago and right here tonight there's possibilities for that young man look up here at this front row of these young people and and brother Wendell you forgive me I'm just just just preaching from my heart but look up here at these young people Church there's possibilities for them there's possibilities we don't have to let the channels get clogged up and sit around and talk about what God used to do we ought to dig out the channels tonight and let the same water flow on them Hallelujah we ought to dig out for channels tonight listen we ought to have to talk about how God filled the church up before we ought to say he can take every one of you young boys every one of you young girls we ought to say God forgive me Lord forgive me of my fa forgive me for the misunderstandings forgive me for the little issues and little qus and problem forgive me for it God I'm ready for the water to flow again what about it what about it Devon there's possibilities ahead for you amen I don't think God brought you in this church young man amen by accident I don't think you got baptized by accident I think there's a Channel of God in this church and there's water ready to flow in it he's just looking for somebody to get to digging come on get the shovel mama get the shovel Daddy get the shovel deacons get the shovel preachers get the shovel father and dig out them ditches the water's there there's possibilities ahead I don't care I don't care what's happened I don't care what mistakes I don't care what moral corruption I don't care what Fallen condition Samson you have been raised to shake the nation hallelujah hallelujah now I'm just going to I'm just going to close on this but you got to quit playing with the world and if you got you got to quit playing with spirits and you got to quit playing with fire thinking you ain't going to get burnt come on folks come on Saints you got to realize what kind of position you're in you're a channel you're a channel in the body listen I'll just go ahead and say it for myself God forbid as Paul said that I should become a Castaway after the things I've preached I know I know we may not be shouting right now this ain't a shouting sermon but it's a digging sermon and I tell you why the devil wants us to skip services like this is because he knows the possibilities of a church that'll begin to dig again he knows if the water comes it's the same water that was with Israel it's the same water that was with Moses and it's right here with this church Samson stood there and you all know the story Delilah pressed on him daily I hope that's okay Delilah pressed on him daily and pressed on him daily and pressed on him daily Spirit of the Lord was upon him let me say this and and and and you get mad at me if you want to but every time that Samson laid his head in Delilah's lap he accumulated more matter in the channel every time he laid his head in Delilah's lap he was accumulating and clogging the channel oh Church to the point the water couldn't even get to him the muscles were there the Covenant was there the hair was there but one mistake amen he let his secret slip one time and Delila cut off his hair oh church I'm going to say it to you don't you let the devil cut your hair off don't you let the devil strip you and leave you powerless I say this I know it's old fashioned but hear me daddies get them altars back open in the house of God momy get them books back open shut off that stupid cell phone and raise them babies in the fear and admonition of God I'm sorry I'm I'm I'm probably getting out of line here but are you hearing me we need some water we need some water our young people got to have some water and Samson laid there and theila come right in and cut off his hair now I say this to you he laid there and she cut his hair off and she said Samson the Philistines be upon you brother Wendell you know that you preached it he woke up as any other man brother joshu woke up muscle still there Covenant was still spoken but there was no power you know what he did and this is what I'm closing on right here tonight because this is what the Lord spoke to my heart today you know what he did he said hey he said one of you young men one of you young Lads would you come and help me get over to the pillars God and I wrote it down just as plain as I was sitting there listening to a tape and the prophet was preaching and the spirit of Lord just come over me and spoke these words don't wait too late to ask for help a Son of God and a daughter of God will always get help either before or after all he had to do was say Lord help me the channels are filled up the channels are clogged Lord would you help me what are you saying preacher I'm saying this there's a possibility brother B said here's the spirit's message to you dig or perish and I close with that tonight here's the spirit's message get to digging or perish you should land if I get to diging I'm going to run into some things in that in that log I'm going to run into some things in that ditch I'm going to run into some things in that brother Andrew if I get to digging I'm gonna I'm G to run into some real some real tough stuff brother Andrew I I I don't know brother Andrew I just don't brother Andrew there's some there's some things got in these ditches our musicians are coming tonight there's some things that's gotten these ditches and there're going to be some pretty big logs to move well can I ask you this question how bad do you want the water brother Andrew there is some things laying in this ditch and I can't just just just shove and dig out and move on and we have to deal with it can I say it to you how bad do you want the water how bad do you want the water you said brother Ander you're talking about possibilities and y'all forgive me I'm just I'm delivered my heart you're talking about possibilities brother Andrew you know what brother Bram said he said here's the possibility God is forgiving Josh how about shouted all over your kitchen there today God heard him said this as clear as I'm sending it to you right now God is forgiving can I tell it to you tonight for the sake of the church for the sake of the young people fathers for the sake of your families mamas for the sake of them babies you're having and want to have once you start digging you say preacher you're a preacher and and ain't no way them lines get clogged in Preachers do you realize that preachers lines can get clogged by getting too busy happened to Moses he got so busy his own son hadn't been circumcised Channel got cogged up Moses wasn't out drinking and sinning and running women and robbing banks and selling dope he was doing the work of God but his channels got so clogged up as a purr took that knife and threw it at his feet and said you're a bloody husband to me folks I'm speaking to you tonight prophet of God said this just keep praying and keep digging yeah don't stop just like when Elijah told them said dig them ditches out there when you get down and you hit an old 10 can say I'm too tired f it out of the way and keep on digging see just keep digging CU we've got to dig Church we've just got to dig that's all can I say what a prophet said if you expect to miss the tribulation you better start [Music] digging what you doing brother Andrew throwing you a shovel pick it up start digging and dig carelessly let the spirit of God carry you away digging what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying get on that machine and dig forget about the signs forget about how how many inches I I was thinking today as I was studying this I my grand and I was building a pool and building a padd is in construction he was in a real hurry to to get to get the job done and I went out there and just a kid been been raised on equipment working and stuff like that and and we're just digging brother Cocker and I went out there and got on that that big old back hole excavator and I just fired that thing up and it had a big long arm on it and I just went to diging man brother Miguel I was just digging digging digging digging dumping dirt digging digging dumping I was just just having a good time as just a kid you know my grandfather come out and he said hey hey hey wait a second what are you doing I said I'm helping you get this done I'm just digging he said you're carelessly digging I said well I'm trying to help you get this done he said don't you see it's only got to be 5et listen folks I dug about 10 feet below that but what about tonight can I tell you something sister Angie there's no limit on how deep you can dig because the deeper you dig the more water you're going to [Music] get start digging right now and you hit that little 10 can or that little issue or that little family situation or problem or something between you and your wife or something between you and your kids or something between you and the Deacon or something between you and your boss on the job or you and a friend and you hit that little can and you say well oops no dig it out there need some water in that ditch they got a little ditch out where you got mad at the preacher for preaching on something and correcting that and you let that log lay in there dig it out tonight let's bow our hearts together tonight unclog the channels unclog the channels if you expect to miss the tribulation you better start digging if we want her babies to have water we better start digging if we want our services to have water we better start digging if you want the future to be fruitful church we better start digging Hallelujah I know we don't do this tonight but the altar is open the holy spirit is in this building tonight I've delivered my heart I've delivered the burden that God set upon it all the preaching is not going to dig the ditches it's just telling you what to do but when you start praying when you start praying and start start confessing and getting things right with God that water's going to start flowing again there's a possibility tonight I know it's dry I know you've been through things and sicknesses in your body and diseases and your health problems and issues and pressures and stresses and financials oh we could go through all those things tonight issues on your job been issues in this and issues there the devil's been throwing log after log after log after log after log in the channel maybe maybe there's a spirit that you've been underestimating its power and that spirit is so convinced you you've got this in control this fire you're playing with this this pressure these things you're doing and listening to and reading if it be immoral or if it be unbelief and doubt from websites about this message you keep laying your head over in Delilah's lab accumulating matter spirit of God is still flowing but it can't get to you cuz there's a clog he's here tonight oh Hallelujah he's in this building tonight he has come to what is the things tonight folks Holy Spirit holy spirit of God sweep across this building tonight Lord make us like David dear God lord make us like David to lay before you oh search our hearts tonight oh God [Music] from the pullit to the back door as your Prophet said to the Janitor's Closet as it were Lord Lord from the front to the back from the left to the right search our hearts oh God lord what matter has accumulated in the channels Lord Lord what spirits and issues have we allowed entertainments oh God and pleasures of this world to clog those channels Lord I pray tonight God would sweep over our hearts Lord Lord we don't want you just to sweep over us tonight Lord and make us feel good Lord but God we want you to just take time with every one of our lives and hearts in this building tonight for me on down lord lord sweep over our hearts tonight God open up every door in our hearts Lord Lord go in the door of our pride Lord Lord if there's so much pride there that we can't ask for help Lord as I heard your spirit speak it so clear to my heart today and I turned to your word in judges 16 and read it right there out of out of where Samson knelt down lord he said help me get to the pillars lad but it was too late oh God don't ever let us get so self-confident Lord Lord don't ever let us get so confident in our abilities or in our self Lord that we just allow the anointing to become common Lord Lord don't ever let us get to a place that we can't we can't say Lord I I need help Lord no matter how old or how young Lord let us never get to a spot we can't say God I need help Lord Samson was a Son of God he was a he was a part of your body he was a channel Lord Lord the mistake it didn't it didn't throw him out of Heaven it didn't throw him out of the Kingdom Lord but it cost a lot but all he had to do was say Lord I need help the channels are getting clogged temptation is too great the pressures are too strong oh God sweep through this building tonight Lord Jesus sweep through this building tonight Lord in Jesus name father I pray for every Father Here Lord Lord that man that stands between that family and that home in the outside world dear God lord the pressures that rest upon his shoulders Lord the pressure of decisions and financial pressures Lord pressures of of of things that have to be done and raising families Lord standing between that that that world and the and the home and Lord it's so easy for the channels to become clogged Lord I'm asking you tonight for my brothers Lord for myself oh God Lord take us to those two p Killers tonight Lord let us get a hold of that Old and New Testament dear God and Lord I pray you and let the power of the Holy Ghost flow through the channels of Our Lives Lord that Devil's attacking fathers and attacking husbands and Men because he knows if he can get that channel clogged then the water won't get to the wife and that water won't get to them babies and then it'll stop up in the church cuz it's not flowing in the homes and oh that Devil's very tricky he's very deceptive but Lord I say what your word said you disarmed him and you give us a way to get the water back Grant it tonight God he's around the altar tonight maybe you at your Pew there you just want to kneel down and start digging say brother Andrew I see that log I'm challenging tonight to get a shovel and dig it out dig it out tonight Lord the oh yes take back take me back to the landmark Lord take me back Lord take me back to where the water flowed oh God take take me back Lord take back Hallelujah there's a possibility tonight there's a possibility [Music] tonight Hallelujah there's a possibility tonight maybe you're digging right now and you're coming up against logs you're saying Lord I don't know how to dig this one out ask him for help his word said he would be the spirit of wisdom he'll give you the instructions he'll give you the grace he'll give you the ability to go and
