that we can give you brother William that's right we have nothing that's worth giving him besides our praise that's why I come to church on these Wednesday nights on these Sundays is not to sit there and look pretty but is to give him the love and the praise that he deserves whether I'm sick whe whether I'm not feeling well whether I'm going through the biggest mind Battle of my life when I step through those doors I'm giving him everything that I can possibly give him whether I have the strength to do it whether I've had my wisdom teeth pull like sister cayle is when I step through those doors everything else means nothing to me I don't care what I look like I don't care if I have snot slung everywhere I don't care if my eyes are swollen from the tears that were shed I have promised myself that in 2024 when I step through those doors I'm going to give my every thing I'm going to pour it out no matter how much it hurts no matter how much pride I have to swallow I'm come to give the Lord the praise because he's worthy of it you're not worthy of it he's worthy of the praise he's worthy of the admiration Jesus was thinking of this song Today sister CA if we can try that tonight before we get ready to turn the the service over but thinking of this song that hit me on the way home like I said today has been something special for me was it's been different and the song hit me on the way home and it say seems every time we go to his throne we bring petitions but forgive Our Song asking questions like Lord how or why or just complain about how hard we try but if he were to ask this time this might be the question one is mine Don't You Think You Are to worship me oh Lord don't you think it's time to spend some time with your hands up in the air of more than just your prayer and give me what is rightly mine yes it's true I want to hear from you all your questions and your every need give me all your doubts and fears but there's more I want to hear time for you to worship me prayer alone can go so far yes but mixed with praise he meets us where we are we can't you see him as a helping ha he's so much more for he's The Great I Am for all his kindness he won't ask much he only wants us to show him my love don't you think you want to work he's asking that question tonight don't you think it's time you spend some time with your your hands up in the air offer more than just your prayer give me what is rightly my yes it's true I want to hear from you all your questions and your every need give me all your doubts and fears but there's more I want to hear it's time for you to worship me how do you explain as the man of God comes now how do you describe he just asked don't you think it's time to worship me this song was our worship a love that goes from east to west it runs as deep as it is wide [Music] yes Lord and you know all our hopes oh Jesus you know on my feet words cannot express the love but we long for you to be listen to our hearts so

is an important service this is going to get us started this year amen and uh uh so we uh are are thankful for what God done for us in 2023 and um just looking for great great great things here in 2024 amen let's look here in the scriptures amen and um uh sure appreciate our musicians and appreciate uh all of you that has come out here tonight want to say that we so appreciate uh everyone's diligence to come out for the uh meeting there in in vanen and and um what a special weekend it was and um uh brother Jeremy was uh his ministry was just over the top and um amen I I um I don't even go to his church and I was all proud of him amen and uh en enjoyed uh brother brother Jeremy isn't it just wonderful to know that that God has got great Great Men great men that love this message and

wheelers uh brother Mike sister Becky but we did enjoy uh ourselves in in the presence of the Lord and so we're so thankful for that let's look here in Matthew the 13th chapter and the 44th verse man um I'm I'm so used to looking back there in that back and and seeing sister Tracy back there uh in the corner and and uh I I think I think this is the first service that she's missed uh since she's been coming and and so uh we are are praying for sister Tracy and we miss her tonight let let's look here Matthew 13 and 44 and again the Kingdom of Heaven is liken to treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for Joy thereof goeth and sth all that he hath and buth that field again the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price he went and sold all that he had and he bought it let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your blessings and this is the first service Lord of 2024 Lord I who would have ever thought that we would be here this this far along but Lord you've been good to us you've been faithful your mercies have never failed us and I'm asking God that you would help us as we dedicate ourselves to you Lord for this next for this year and that you would anoint us and that you would let a greater humility Lord be upon us and let a a real deep richness of our heart in you as we walk together I pray father Lord that we would work for you like never before and that you would use every one of us for your kingdom I pray Lord that you would grant us souls for your kingdom Lord who knows we may be the one somebody in this building may be the one who reaches the last soul lord your Prophet said when the last one has come then the Rapture will take place I I pray Lord that you help us to be diligent this year now Lord you see all of the ones that's not feeling good Lord at home and even here and I'm asking God that your richness would be there with them and that you would heal them and make them whole help us tonight Lord as we Endeavor to speak your word and Lord anoint us Lord and we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here tonight so as we are looking into this year I I I thought I would take amen uh just a a simple thought tonight placing value on your call and your purpose in 2024 and um amen with this being our our first service I I think that it would be a good thing for us to you know examine our lives this evening and and look very closely and see what is important to us this year what is what is more important and then what is most important amen what what is you we all have desires We All We Are all uh we're human beings we're born with desire man we have we have we're a spirit being amen we have our affections we we have our our emotions amen every everything about us in the Physical Realm is is driven by our spirit in the spiritual real and and I I want us to really look at ourselves this this evening because I believe the greatest the most important thing is to give yourself to your call this year let this be the year that we give ourselves our absolute everything to Jesus Christ let this be the year of total fulfillment where we have given everything that we've got and we don't have anything else in reserves amen I've learned that no man lives to himself and I've been preaching for some time on Ministry and and and and while I am definitely not a teacher a teacher can be profound and and really bring it in and me I I have to hit and and and uh slobber and just go around it over and over until I I think maybe I'm getting my my point home and I sure hope that I that that I don't come across as just preaching the same thing over and over uh because I don't feel like I am preaching the same thing over and over I'm I'm trying to hit in every way that I can to get you to understand that the preacher is not the only one with Ministry that we all have a Ministry we all will be responsible to God we all will no man lives to himself and no man Li uh dies to himself and and so you are here to affect somebody you do affect somebody and then when you die you will give an account for those who you have affected both positively and negatively amen we come to Earth with Divine Purpose amen and so I I see that there are too many that that are so uh uh self indulged there amen everything is about them about their family about their career amen and and there's going to be very few that come to the end of life feeling really feeling fulfilled and there's going to be very few that stand on that day amen when we do stand before God at the award banquet and may there may be some that has a tinge of of of sadness because they did not fulfill everything the way that they should have there's so many that are going through life today that are so unfulfilled they're just unfulfilled and and it's because they've neglected the opportunity to step up to the plate and to fulfill a need they amen they they they live amen they have a family they have a job they might even have a nice car things in the amen money in the bank but amen they they they're unfulfilled they have many things but yet they're still empty on the inside is because God didn't call you and and and and birth you here on this Earth send you here to Earth to drive a new car and to live in a new house that's not your purpose your purpose amen is to feel H uh the need in humanity and to you you you you affect somebody and and you're call and many times we think as as as as ministers well it's behind the pulpit amen well I I want to you know as I have said uh here a few times amen h a man if if if a preacher behind this Pulpit is is only is only good to the church behind the pulpit he's not a preacher he's missed his call that's not who you are amen if if if your heart is not for people and it's not showing in your life in your family and really the only time that anyone knows that you're a preacher is when you're behind a pull pit you probably don't have a call because it is a call of God that loves people amen it loves people it's that call I I look there at at at at at what brother brandham had said and and and I I I've got this uh quote here uh let let me let me see if I can find it I I I I like this because uh it gives us a little bit of an idea as he speaks these things about himself and his relationship to the people and and he says I say this that I believe that the that this great spirit that is Among Us is the holy spirit I believe he's called me for this purpose doesn't make me any more than the man that got saved this morning I'm just your your servant your brother makes me less than you because I'm sent to serve you I am a servant to the public a public servant is a minister to serve the public to be the underdog to take the knocks and drives of the public and whatever it is to stand there and if you want if you haven't got Grace enough to smile and take it then you ought to go back to Calvary and reconfirm your commission that's what you're supposed to do then another place he says the gift is not for me I cannot use it for myself it's for you you you're the one that gets the benefit not me I'm just the public servant of God to you a preacher is is a public servant he just holds himself there like a lily of the field the Bumblebee flies in and gets his part and the honeybee flies in and gets his and the passenger the the the bypasser gets his and everything and he toils day and night to keep his Radiance and the gospel Minister does the same thing he walks in line with god holds his test testimony true that the world might partake of him see Mr Pastor Lily he's a good one Jesus said consider him Solomon is not like him and that's that's right Dr Lily I guess you all know him see uh consider the lies how they toil and I I say yet Solomon in all of his glory and Lily has to struggle day and night to get the radiance to keep his garments to keep the perfume and that things are going and others just open and he just open opens himself up and he comes by and they take it out of him the bee and the Fly and everything comes by good or bad just just takes it from him and that's the way the servant is of Christ the Christian servant just opens himself up and says just take from me world nothing for himself it's for others and that's what Christ becomes when he become when he become uh uh kin folk to us he become man that the world might partake of his righteousness see he and and and to be made sons of God can you say man another place brother brandham would say I I just got in here just in time to get to hear that I I miss all the good singing in these meetings because I thought maybe that I well I just I'm so busy you know how it is people come in by plane and by train and they you you you never know it you see they because it it just comes in by the phone and you you have to go to them and meet them and pray for them everywhere it's just constantly going and and then try to study too it it makes it quite a problem but we're always happy to meet the people and do what we can for them because we're a public servant for the Lord Jesus Christ to his people in this day we like to do more than we do but we can't I I I look there in 2024 I I I'm not a prophet and so I I can't I I I'm I I can't even put myself close to what brother brandham was here in these in these incredible statements and how that he looked at himself but for the gift that God gave me with the call that God gave me I am a public servant and and and I'm not just I I can't just place that on William brandham the prophet and I can't just place that on wendle Martin a pastor I cannot just place that on Amen William Smith an evangelist I cannot just place that on Duren Martin a a minister of the Gospel I say tonight that we are all called of God to fulfill a purpose we're all called of God and we will have to answer someday as we as we look there in Matthew 25 the 14th chapter as we go or the 25th chapter in the 14th verse down to the 30th and and and and Jesus says uh you know you you the Kingdom of Heaven is is is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and gathered unto him his goods and and he gave one five talents and to another two and to another one and everyone according to his several ability straight way and straightway took his journey so so now we we can see that there's going to be some that's got that that's been given a lot there's going to be some that's amen given the five there's some that's given the two and then there's one that's just given the one and and and then he leaves and and then he's going to return and it will be the the the it'll be a a joyous time or it'll be a time time of uh it'll be a time of weeping and and and mourning amen are y'all understanding me so so we we we want you to understand and we can and we can see as we went on that that the one with Thea with the five talents he traded amen took his took his uh uh uh talents and he used them prospered them and when the Lord came he gave him 10 more Amen in other words he took what the master gave him and he worked with them and he brought increase to his master amen the other one came in with the two and he he went out used the gifts the talents that God gave him even though they were only two and he multiplied them and had five to give to show his master five extra amen it was he was coming back and he was showing them what you gave me I used them I brought glory to you I am laying amen I am laying the increase down at your feet but then we had the one and the the the one looked at the guy with the five looked at the guy with the two and he said uh man apparently I must not be much I must he must not think of me very much the other one why why he's been given five talents he can play amen the the the the piano and and the trombone and he can and and and and he can preach and and he's got so many so many wonderful gifts and amen and I look at this other one and he's he's a wonderful song leader and he's uh and and he's he's given these talents and and me I don't have much that I can I can give and God just didn't give me much and so he they he takes the one talent and he hides it in the ground amen he hides it in the dirt and then when he hide hallelujah how many knows that you are an earn vessel and the scripture says that the the amen we have Treasures in these earn vessels and we've got to bring these qualities these gifts and we've got to use them well can you say Amen now the one with the with the one with just the single Talent can look at the one with a five and say but I want to do that and I want to do that and I want to do that or he could say I'm here with a purpose and the master has given me something of Great Value and I want to use that value amen for someone uh uh for that specific purpose can you say amen amen now we find that as the as the as the husbandman came back the the master came back and we and we we find that that that he in in the 21st verse he says well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord he also uh that received two uh talents came and said Lord thou gave me two and I gained two other besides them and his lord said well done good and faithful servant thou H has been Faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter into the joy of the Lord and then he come to the one that received one talent and said Lord I knew that thou art a hard man reaping where thou Hast not sown and Gathering where thou Hast not straw and I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth and lo thou Hast that is thine and he gives it to him and his Lord answered and said unto him thou Wicked and slothful servant thou knowest that I reap where I sow not and gather where I have not straw thou oughtest therefore to have put thy money to the exchangers and then at my coming I should have received mine own Usery take therefore the talent from him give unto him that has 10 For unto everyone that has shall be given and and he that shall and he shall have an abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath and and cast ye the unprofitable servant into uh outer darkness and there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth so when we when we look at our lives we have purpose as I have as I have talked on the on the ministry of love as I have beg to talk all Ministry stems from love it's a love between a relationship between you and God it's a relationship that you love him more than you love you love anything else and as you love him and you realize that you were saved for a specific time and a specific purpose you understand amen that God thought something very special of you for you to be here amen and God gave you you talents and gifts and those gifts and callings are without repentance now if you're not called to be an evangelist amen maybe you're called to be uh H you know maybe you're called to be a singer or uh uh maybe maybe you're called to to there you know many different things there's not there's not a set thing maybe amen you the Lord has just given you a love for a a certain thing and and and and and you you are you are giving of that Talent back to the Lord amen you see Satan will come in and he will try his best to shut you up he'll try this his best in 2024 to shut up your ministry he'll He he'll do everything he can to get you distracted and again now I I I want to say if if if if you're driving man as as as they used to be when I was a kid if you're driving a Volkswagen amen don't pull up next to a Porsche and expect to win the race you can pray all you want to but but you're you're in a Volkswagen and if God's given you a gift Amen to to in a certain area then don't get outside that area and push and push and push and try to make something happen because there's just nothing you can do to make that to work that's right if God's not called you to do it then I would suggest you not do it stay in the gifts and the calls amen and just love God and I'm telling you if you love God and you love people your ministry will Thrive and God will automatically place you where you are needed because you're not trying to put a square peg in a round hole you are just loving God you're loving people and your gift automatically makes room for you that's just the way the prophet taught us that it works amen but you see what we're needing to do is to find the value in the one Talent many times we're looking at the one talent and saying I don't have much but you see it was valuable to him and it was valuable in his heart to give it to you Hallelujah now I I I I think that it's this is very very important because especially since we know that the time is coming when we're going to have to give an account to the Lord Jesus for these gifts that he has placed in his life what can you say amen amen now in order to find Value in something then you must find an expert who specializes in in that particular field amen man somebody that has concentrated uh on and and and confines himself to a specific subject he knows what he's talking about he knows the real from the fake he knows he understands the the true value of something amen and I feel like the Holy Spirit here is is the one who knows the real true value of the gift that God has placed in your life now let me say this again amen as I've said so often l there is not one person in this building that does not have a gift and a call there is no one in this building amen you have been called of God placed here on this Earth with a specific call amen hallelujah amen and it's your love I as I think about the love for people now I I I think of my my my sister uh Denise back there now she says that her call and she reminds me this weekly that her specific call in life am man is to Pastor the pastor and now I've I've looked in the Bible and I've looked through that the quotes and I have not found I have not found any Scripture or quotes to to uh support that but I will say this one thing here H uh uh my my my sister and I'm just picking on you going to embarrass you here but my sister has a love and she's just always been one that wants to love and to help and and and and where she could help in with our kids with the little signers or she's tried to help here and tried to help there now now there's not a specific scripture I in the Bible uh that that that talks about little signers and little kids but I do know that there has been a specific need that has been filled by someone that just that is just loving that's right and and and I will say that that gift is is a little bit you I can find that a little bit more in the scripture than the one that you say that you have uh for pastoring the pastor cuz she doesn't she's not a peser amen I appreciate sister Denise but you see man it's it's those it's those it's those little things that that that people give of themselves that really might not even be part of the five-fold ministry might not be a part of the gifts and the governments in the church the helps in the governments but yet they they they are gifts that God sends to a particular uh to a particular congregation and and it it causes that congregation to thrive it causes that congregation to grow and to be fulfilled and God baptized that's the reason the scripture says amen that he places you baptizes you places you into the as a member into his body as it pleases him he gives the gifts he gives the cause these are predestinated by God then he saves you amen he he through predestination brings you to a particular spot and there he causes you to thrive and to grow amen and you are just like little little uh uh uh Reverend Lily amen you don't really no one's giv you a title no one's telling you that you're something special you're just you're just a Lily and you're doing what you know to do and the fragrance that God gave you you're just you're just basking in the presence of God and before you know it you're you're you're you're you're you're you're blessing the bumblebees and you're blessing the birds and you're blessing everyone that looks upon you the fragrance that you have is a Ministry to the people man I think the Holy Spirit he would know who the expert he as as the expert he's the one that knows what he's doing when he places you in your gift in your call now you you have to have amen any experts got to have a standard and and a standard is something that something that is set or established by Authority as a rule it a standard is determined amen is used to determine or to measure the quality the weight the value the uh the quantity and and and and the there's always a set standard amen uh uh uh you know to to to uh measure uh uh the level of quality there there is a set standard uh that the electricians use and that set standard is Nationwide amen it is a standard that we judge ourselves by amen our our currency or our uh uh the USA amen economy is on the go standard that's why we measure everything by for its money system not all jewelry is created equal amen so so you have to have someone who who knows how to Value something so that you know that whether it's fake or whether it's not fake and and and God will let us know Hey listen your ministry is is is is is not this this here is your ministry this is the value you're looking at it at at the wrong way and I'm thankful for that amen our society has a standard amen our society has a has a has a has a you know a way of determining value it seems like the more you have the more valuable you are okay amen the bigger the house the more valuable you are the prettier you have amen the more boyfriends you have and the uglier you are the less boyfriends you in our society a 4,000 squ foot house on 500 Acres with a three car garage amen and a and a one time uh uh uh crew cab Ford setting in the driveway if that's a successful that's a successful man and then you look at someone that's renting a 740 squ foot house and with only one bath and driving a Rattle Trap of a car making minimum wage that's not valuable you see God looks at things totally different we look in society the more I have the more valuable I am I don't think that's the way God is you whether whether you have the five talents or the one Talent it's valuable to God and you've got to see the value I don't care whether you are a a man a Donnie Reagan a Tim PR an an ed bcll hor a window Martin God gives valuable amen God gives value to the one that he calls he called you that's valuable he called me that's valuable so what we've got to do is say Lord let me see the value in the gift that you've given me well praise the Lord now some people say well if I oh if I could just be evangelize like Andrew Glover oh if I could just be be like that and just go travel oh I would be fulfilled not if you weren't called to that that's right you can't be fulfilled right you would be you it's not your call right oh well if I could just be a pastor if I could just Pastor I I I I would be fulfilled not if you're not called to that oh if I could be a song leader I could show brother Merl a few a few ways of leading songs not if you're not called to that but the call the value is the call that God placed upon you oh Hallelujah I remember when I was a kid is this okay tonight I was growing up my daddy was the associate pastor he was the school principal amen and and H you know and uh uh of course my my pastor was very good to me and uh you know while growing up matters of fact my pastor uh gave me my first car my my pastor gave me my first rifle amen a and in fact brother burus gave me my first I my first pocket knife and and and and I I always remembered that and and I'm and I'm thankful to that but there were so many others in the in in in my life at that time in My Teenage life especially that sold so much into me that maybe Mom and Dad don't even know and my pastor probably didn't know one of them was was was sister was sister uh uh Lori Hastings now she was about she was about this tall had hair that drugged the ground and and uh uh you know she could she she was her choir leader and she could really sing and and and and but you know she wasn't she she didn't have really much of a Ministry but she she had a nurturing Min a nurturing heart and her taking the time with me and and knowing and and I and I was older than her children so she didn't realize that she had uh uh she didn't have teenagers to think about but she would she would see me and she would she would come up with that little inquisitive you know as she she anyone that knows sister Lori she just she just always glowed you know and she so she'd come up and she'd she'd say so um what are you praying about today and and get the conversation to go you know it this little old teenager in in in his in my in my 14 15 years old and my heart struggling as I'm growing to be a man and and and and a lot of lot of lot lot of struggles going on I'd start talking before you know what I'd start crying you know and then I'd really feel bad you know as I'm trying to trying to get my act together and act like a man here and and and and and and she'd say well you know what I can sense that God's got something a call on your life wend and you know you're you this is a time of growth for you and she says I I I I promise you I'm going to be praying and then amen I i' I'd come I'd come to school or i' or I'd come to church and and she'd have a little note or something uh uh there on my Bible with a scripture verse on it or something you know tell and what was it it it was a it was a Ministry do do do you realize and she done this she done this time and time again and there's there there is one lady that stands out to me out of all of my childhood and that's Lori Hastings and I found Lori Hastings here while well I I've known she lived in in Tulsa but I I I I actually got to visit with her here a while back and here she is 70 years old and I told her I don't know I don't know if you know what you have meant to me all of these 50 years of my life I I I I want you to know and she says I didn't realize that I said sister Lori I was hanging on to every word you told me she says really I said you brought me through some of the darkest night you see she did not have an official title but God knew that I was going to need it and she she placed she was content with the gift that God placed in her life she wasn't trying to be something else it would have never worked but her nurturing spirit brought this boy this pastor that has now been pastoring for for for 30-some years brought this fella through some of the most trying times of his teenage life it was a woman with a nurturing spirit now I I I want you to catch that because the good old American way is it's got to be bright it's got to be shiny it's got to be out in your face it's got to be in order for me to have a Ministry huh i' i' I've got to be I I I I I I've got to be a missionary I've got to be a world evang angelist I've got to be a or or you can be what God put you at right there where you are and you can be a little Lily that is just giving Radiance and giving fragrance and giving of yourself and you're you're giving you're caring you're you're you're you're you're stepping out of your way to say I appreciate you or you're you're and and your blessing and and I want to say to some of you uh uh mamas here that's got these younger kids now amen who in your lives was was so nurturing to you all uh Mary and and and and Amy and and some who who would you and I'm just going to ask you and maybe I'm dead wrong but I think I know who I think I know who y'all's going to say who in your life in your teenage years was such a blessing huh sister Rebecca now she wasn't a real good singer and and we had to help her stay on tune when she sung and and and and we all loved her singing and why did we love her singing it was just so raw and real and it would bring the presence of the Lord down just not because she could she could she could do it and stay I it was just right but what did she do she took you girls you teenage girls and there was so many of you and she nurtured you and you all stayed with her at her house and she wrote you guys she was writing books for y'all man I mean she was she she would write y'all letters she was constantly nurturing and and when I just asked without giving you anything and just asking who what woman was the most influence qual of your life in when your teenage years it wasn't even your mother even though mother's good it was someone in the church yes because we need something Beyond them my mother and father were very nurturing to me and I'm not saying anyone could take their place but in that time where I couldn't just really come and talk to Dad and I felt like aen Mama couldn't hear me quite it was somebody that was saying I love you God loves you God's going to see you right that's right it was a gift yes and you can't really find it in here but it come when you were baptized with the Holy Spirit that's right you see if if we're not careful we don't place value on those things and when we don't place value then we don't spend the time in prayer we don't spend the time before the Lord because Reverend Mr Lily has got to have something to offer has got to have something to give and the gift in itself can't do it there's got to be the life of the holy spirit that is pushing those gifts out of us and Mr Lily can very well amen it's so fragile and frail that it would be easy to put a rock over the top of it and the Lily is no longer giving of it self the ministry is no longer there and Satan wants to come in and to take the fragrance of the Little Lily and he want to do anything he can Amen to put put it over the top in 20124 and before you know it your little gift is hid inside your little Earth and vessel and it's not expressing it the way it should and we will have to give an account to God that's right Hallelujah well this is pretty good this is a lot I'm preaching it better than y'all's amen I tell you that so so the Lily the giving brother brand I'm talking about how he would oh it was just it was just he was here and he was there and he was praying and he was and even when he would get home Heen he says I took I took brother now now if there's anybody that needed some time off and to rest it would be brother Brandon but he would come in and says I know our pastor so for work so I just took his sit calls uh today while I was here and and just went around and and and praying now now now brother Bram was a prophet hello you don't have to do that hey hey you're the prophet to the age you you just just stand behind the pit but no his heart right was Ministry yes sir I'm a public servant I'm one that loves people can you say am man there are stories that brother Brandon would go amen help help widows uh uh put rofs on their house and help them to do uh to to to help this and help that amen he he was just going to do whatever he could why because it was earing out of him I say today man in this 2024 God let my heart be so overwhelmed with you what can you say amen I I I I wonder what the value of prayer is to us Lord Lord increase the value of prayer to me I can't I can't I can't give if I'm not if I'm not getting if I'm not pulling away in prayer then I cannot give in 2024 I've got to receive in order to give that's right can you say amen amen now listen folks eternal life is living for others amen I I I I I say tonight did you know that all of Heaven is at your disposal did you know that the lame can walk and the blind can see and the deaf can hear amen by someone that is just willing to just be themselves and let the Holy Spirit anoint them that love can heal love can bring the power of God down on on the on the scene well can you say Amen yes give us that you see and I and I and I want to say is I'm is I'm not going to keep you long here tonight I if if if you if you young people and all of us let me just let me just take the young people well I'm going to make all of you young people tonight Hallelujah if if your friends aren't don't have Ministry at heart then maybe you ought to get some more friends yes sir because your call you're you've got Divine Purpose for being here on Earth and you must must must must you must fulfill the purpose that God placed you here for you say well what is my purpose brother bradam says you need to go to God and really in Earnest prayer ask him and he will show it to you yes that's right that's right that's what he said he says if you've been hired if you've been hired on a job he said don't you don't go just stand around and and say you know well I don't know what to do he he said don't stand around all day with your hands in your pocket go to the one who hired you and ask what do you want me to do he will show you the purpose for being hired that's right well praise the Lord he'll show you that purpose can you say Amen you see if if you've got friends that don't want to be taught that don't want that that that don't want the value of that eternal life within them to to come out and Express in their works I want to tell you your friends will never overcome you can't overcome you you cannot be selfish and overcome it won't happen selfish people why is everyone so why is drugs so taken over and why is there there's so many perversions it all comes from selfishness it's me me me me selfishness has nothing that's done nothing but increase sin and Saints there's a lot of sin in the church because of selfishness that's right that's true lots of sin because it's me me me me if you got rid of the me and ask God for his will in your life you might be doing things a little bit differently than you do that's true amen well praise the Lord you see somebody is going to stay in the Rut of selfishness but you must move on on I I I you young people someone say well I don't want to help I don't want to do this I don't want to do that well that's not me that's not I don't okay that's fine God bless you I'm going to fulfill a purpose can you say Amen do not die on the vine well praise the Lord can I can I go ahead and say it I'm here do

making sure that people succeed in this little church here in pawy America will become a Pure number one priority is that we are all succeeding together that's right because we're we understand that this transcends Human family this transcends Martin Applegate Torrance uh uh uh Gonzalez uh uh uh uh Curtis you know it it it it transcends all Earth three families We Are One family and that's in the body of Jesus Christ amen can you say Amen now don't I I I put a i i i i i put a a a a little pick and sister Caya if you wouldn't mind putting that up selfishness is like is like fungus and and fungus will destroy your fruit fungus fungus starts with one and because it's connected with something else it'll it'll it it'll it'll begin to Poison every everything else poison you you you you cannot die your passion for Souls your passion for God your passion for your church cannot die just because you've got a friend that has no passion for God well praise the Lord don't have a passion to see the work of God go on don't have a passion and before you know it amen I I you you you you you you get around the wrong person and this and and I and this could be on your job or this could be even in this church it could be it could be a Christian friend outside the church it could be you know you know it could be anything in general but you see what you are you are the average you are the average of the five closest people around you so whoever are your five closest uh friends that that you hang around you will become the average of what they are this is this is a little bit of this is a little bit of teaching uh in in uh uh uh in financial and business success you so in order to succeed in business then you have to surround yourself with like thinking people people who want to win people who don't care what it takes they must win you become the average of your five of the five closest people in your life I'm not here to teach business because business is going to all of your money and all of your wealth and everything's going to die but what you do for Jesus Christ will last and it'll last eternity can you say Amen so who are you spending your time with where are you putting your value you say well I want so but but but you're hanging around clowns all the time is that going to nurture prayer is that going to nurture Bible study well praise the Lord if you're hanging around somebody somebody's that does not have the value on the things of God like you desire in your heart you cannot somebody say cannot you will not somebody say will not you cannot you will not win if we're going to win in 2024 we're going to have to surround ourselves with like thinking folks if you have got a call and a Ministry on your life then surround yourself with people not of the same gifts you don't want the same gifts but you want the same mindset you want the same desire you want to hang around somebody that wants to see the blind see that want to see the dead to race that wants to see God move in their life surround yourself with people of the same desire amen 2024 placing the value on your call on your purpose well praise the Lord now now put that back up there sister Keys amen if you not careful all there was was just one bad all there was was just one bad fruit and it's already taken over it's already taken over three that I see amen the one on the bottom and the one to the side it's already and you know what's going to happen go look it up for yourself it'll end up that fungus will take out the entire Bowl True Praise the Lord are y'all hearing me what what what is what what is that you you're either going to produce the the fruit of the the of the flesh or the fruit of the spirit what is the fruit of the spirit it is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is is no law yes sir but all it takes is One Bad Apple or Peach all it takes is not getting rid oh but brother wle we we

positive walk with God come on and you've got to hold them at at at arms length well well well well but that that that person needs help yep yep and they will be my Ministry but right now I'm needing people to feed me to strengthen me so that I can help that sorry attitude right there so that I can help and and and heal and do that but as for me I am going to surround myself with the posit positive words the positive influence the positive anointing the positive come on church we are the body of Jesus Christ that's right my wife don't want to be a positive influence that's fine I'll still love her I'll still kiss her I but I'm going to surround myself with somebody with a positive influence Amen in my life amen can you say amen hallelujah amen amen my iPad saying I wish You'

someone sent me a a real Precious sister here at the church sent me a a a a long text on on New Year's Eve and and and and was talking about the what God has done for her and how she didn't handle things right in 2023 and as like she would like to and and and she's and and and but but she said but I've grown and and and this year that's coming up brother Wendell I I'm going to overcome in more areas of my my life and and and she says thanks for your tutor and thanks for your help and I thought I I I like that I I I I like that and and I and and I and that's the way we want every one of our friends to be we want every one of our we want at the end of 2024 to look around and say I'm thankful I'm thankful for the ones that God given me in my life I'm thankful for the positive influences I'm thankful for someone I did not go out after this message is my absolute and I I am so thankful that God gave me friends that believe the same way this message amen this word I I know that I am Hallelujah I know that when I look up in the mirror in the you need to look in the mirror every morning you need to be able to look in the mirror and say that I have got a purpose for somebody here today when you look in the mirror God use me God I'm here with a purpose God I'm ordained here with a purpose God I'm asking that you would fulfill your purpose through me look in that mirror and say with Christ all things are [Applause] possible amen but if you die on the Vine with somebody that doesn't have Zeal mine well praise the Lord don't have a passion for Souls ain't going to lift their finger to go help somebody else when they're in need not going to not they and they they can't look in the mirror amen they can't look in the mirror and see that they are somebody's answer yes you see that's pretty arrogant that ain't arrogant brother Brandon was answering calls and going and praying going here and there you know why he had an anointing upon his life he had an anointing on his life and he was willing to give that gift that he had to everyone else I might not be a prophet with a Divine gift but what I do have I'm going to give it to everyone else around [Applause] me can you say that because I am somebody's answer I have been called with a Divine Purpose I have just God didn't take me home I haven't died in 23 I'm here in 24 and if I'm here hallelujah I'm here to defeat the Devil I am here to see the kingdom of God go forward I am here and God strengthen my resolve strengthen my attitude strengthen everything about me to press forward in the battle well praise the Lord W you turn to your neighbor and say run the Bad Apple will poison you run run Hallelujah run are you hear he Meen how will that how will that put put that back up there h h h how will that H how will that how will that poison me they're their own people I'm My Own people hallelujah listen they are selfish they're self- inclined they're self- indulged they're self-satisfied the the they're thinking about themselves a a a and and that poison will get on you and Christ has saved you from selfishness and pride Christ has laid his life down for you to be Amen to to be giving of yourself that selfish person will take you down it'll it'll it'll destroy the anointing in your life it'll destroy the effects of your purpose and your call it will destroy your influence that's true yes sir now if you're one of those bad apples with fungus I don't see much hope for that thing but I know God can still God can still help and God can still renew and we just need a new birth because New Birth man what did the scriptures what brother brandom say am man eternal life is living for others well praise the Lord are you hearing me the most important people in the world are people of prayer the most important people in the world that know they have POS been positioned in the body of Christ not to feel good not to have shunned eyes but they're anointed to heal and to encourage and to strengthen they are called with a purpose amen can you say Amen do you love him amen I can't afford turn to your neighbor and said I can't afford a a fruit spoiler Hallelujah I can't afford fruit spoilers that's right amen Jesus said there and John you can just keep that just keep that up there sister Keys John 15 and 16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and I have ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name may he may give it to you he says I've ordained you predestinated you called you to bring forth fruit and that your fruit remain that's God's call upon us how about it for 2024 I want to live for God like I've never lived for Hallelujah Hallelujah can you say Amen now don't throw it away man I heard a statement and and you know this this I wrote it down I heard this statement that that said something like don't cross oceans for people who wouldn't cross a puddle for you that's true no that's not true I don't want you to say that's true don't cross oceans for people who would not cross a puddle for you well I know I know I know I know you're you're still in the you're still in the gear of just chopping everybody else off that's that's that's going to affect your ministry but what I am not saying that we are that we are pushing everyone else off I'm saying my call is to give and give and give and if I've got someone close to me that just just just a just a craw Daddy all the time all the time backing up no one you can't depend on that one to be of a helper you can't depend on that one to be of any kind of a support you can't depend in your life then brother that's the time to push that one off and say I'll gladly pray I'll glad I'll do whatever I can but I'm needing I'm needing some Warriors that's going to walk with me amen that's got the same kind of attitude I have the same kind of call there's the difference see there's there's what I'm trying to say so now the reason I've got to surround myself with the Positive is because that right there is wrong you do cross oceans for people yes you love people you love all people you give and continue to give there's no conditions attached I I I'm talking about the good one I'm talking about the good one there here's the difference between the good and the bad the bad is selfish the good one is to get the bad says the Bad Apple says don't cross the oceans for people who wouldn't cross a puddle for you but the The Good Life of Christ says do cross the oceans for people do love people do love all people no conditions attached no wondering whether they're worthy of it or not cross those oceans climb those mountains give of yourself that's what you're here for we can't look well they're not predestinated really come on do you have this thing all figured out because brother Joe I would have given up on you a few times right but God sees value in you and God's doing a wonderful work in you Julie Litteton yes sir if there was anybody that would fall under if if if the Serpent's Seed was in the if the serpent seed was in the Webster's Dictionary the picture would be Julie Littleton she hated what we had she made fun of us she defended homosexuality got pretty graphic on things she had abortions and she made fun of me every time I walked into Ranch B and that was the greatest offense of them all I tell you I I I want okay amen I'm fixing the clothes I took I would take our preachers you know that come in I took I to I took brother I took brother Forest farmer it was packed in there on a Sunday morning and barely packed and I brought I took brother Forest over there to get him some breakfast and so um we're we're we're in there and he had his back turned towards her we were

eating the pastor of the Church of the skirt has just walked in the building and I'm sitting there and I'm looking at brother forest and I know brother Forest don't take things like this too very lightly amen and I he looked up at me with fire in his eyes and I said brother Forest it's okay I deal with this all the time everyone's all laughing and uh I'm laughing he turns around and he says let me tell you something about this pastor of the Church of the skirt he can show you in the big black book why he is pastoring the Church of the skirt this man can tell you about the Gospel of Jesus Christ this man is probably the most truest Pastor in and I'm sitting there going oh my word and before you know it everyone is quitting their eating they've stopped laughing they're looking down at their plates I am beat red and when he was through different wi started a little testimony service Wendell's one of the biggest men I know yeah and I'm going oh wow wow what okay this was bad this this was I it was it was rough okay Julie would come in and pester and she would do this to me every time I'd walk in and finally I told Kobe I said I just I ain't going back I told the boys we'd all go down there amen I'd done some what and what and the reason why we were in there a lot was because I'd done work for her and she couldn't afford she couldn't afford it so I said tell you what just just throw in some meals we'll come in and eat breakfast or something you know and so uh we just had a tab over there and and and so uh the boys they loved it and uh uh they'd go in there and just eat on my tab you know and so uh uh I I just and but but but but Kobe kept going on in there I said I just can't do it anymore I I'm I you know she just she roused me up I it's it's just bad you know she'd come and say amen I don't know about your God but my God is the big dog that's what we call my God he's the big dog I say Julie my God is not the big dog he's Jesus Christ yeah yeah yeah coming from you I would think that and just Kobe would come in and he would ask he'd come back over and say Hey you know she's making this big deal about homosexuality today would you have anything I said here so I man I we we sat down get the scriptures and I'd give him all so he'd go he'd take his Bible in there and he'd show her these scriptures and and and and and and guess guess what I I sister Rebecca died and when sister Rebecca passed away at the funeral guess who showed up Julie Littleton and so we tried to give her the best kind of a homecoming that we could and and brag on the Lord that was in her and Julie was was standing off to the side at at the grave uh uh graveyard and and she said you know she was an angel and I said well I didn't know she was an angel she was an angel every time she would come in she glowed and I said 'w that that's good that's good she said' Wendell if there's anybody that that that live what you preached Rebecca I I I seen God in her and well well thank you that's good you know what God done yeah she she refused to call me brother right brother M remember that she wouldn't call me brother I was window window I'm not calling you brother you're not brother you're window and I don't care you know one ain't no man gonna tell me you know all that kind of stuff so and so here here we go so she I was over there brother Michael brother

just a just a oh you wer there T night at church and I'm going sister Julie Julie what's going on it's okay I thought somebody died I thought her goat died or a horse died or something and so I I'm I'm I said Julie settle down settle down what's what's going on and so I finally got her settled down and she said Wendell while Jonathan was preaching tonight and he preached that he preached he he preached something about the blood of Jesus and how he said about the blood Veil and she said I'm the biggest sinner in that entire church she says you can take every one of the sins and those people those are Saints they're Angels Wendell everyone in that church is Angels compared to me you can take every one of their sins and it wouldn't even hold anything to what I am I've had abortion after abortion and she started going through I've done this and I've done this and I've done this and she's crying and she's sobbing and she's she said but when I wish you were there why weren't you here tonight why and I and I I said what happened she said Jonathan was preaching and it was so Animated she said it was like the ceiling opened up and water came down over me and it would come down it would go back up and it would come down and it would go back up and she said Wendell as big of a sinner as I am I know that I have been forgiven God saved me tonight Wendell I was crying we I think we were all crying in the car as we were listening God done something for that that woman and it was you and me that affected her there was something about Julie Julie would have such she was a simple
