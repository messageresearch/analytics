brother Josh uh he's he's back there in the crippled section amen and uh you know um um we had the the the awesome privilege of of being able to preach a meeting with Josh uh he he and I preached a meeting together and and um uh I counted that just a real privilege and um and so we came back home for the for the funeral and and I think the next day he um he was playing ball with with uh with some of the young people and uh he said he hadn't even got they they hadn't even been in the game for two or three minutes and and he he came down on that knee and and um the x-rays don't look too pretty so he's he's got to uh see some more doctors and things so let's just pray for brother Josh that the Lord will will intervene and and heal that he'll that KN amen uh the bread winers he he just can't afford to to to be uh uh well sitting around praise the Lord amen and I know brother Michael says amen hallelujah so um amen well let's let's look here in the scriptures this morning good to see everyone in the house of the Lord amen and um we uh want to look here in James the first chapter and the um 12th verse and I wonder if if um you could turn the the house mics up a little bit amen and um praise the Lord I want to it's we're just going to speak just real uh on a on a simple thought on on overcoming and um um something that I uh was just really impressed upon last night um in the in the middle of the night actually I got up um had these on my mind and so to the we hours of the morning um looking over these scriptures and so I know that the Lord when he places something on your heart uh there's a reason for that and and so I you know I've I've served the Lord enough to know to just it's just best to follow his leadership amen amen let's look here in in James 1 and 12 blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord ha promised to them that love him let no no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but if every man but every man is tempted when he has drawn away of his own lust and is in and enticed but when lust hath conceived it brings forth sin and sin when it is finished brings forth death do not he my beloved brother uh uh Brothers he he says every good gift every perfect gift is from above cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom uh is no variableness neither shadow of turning of his own will beget he us with the word of truth that we should be the kind of first fruits of his creatures let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord we want to thank you today for your goodness for your blessings today Lord Lord thank you for your amazing love to us thank you for the anointing of the Holy Spirit Lord as we have sung the songs and listening to Lord the special that was that was brought this morning and Lord we are so thankful we're not a we're not a proud people we're a thankful people and I'm asking God this that you would speak to us this morning because we truly want to hear from you Lord is we want to learn and Lord we want your presence to be here among us to make us exactly like you want us and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning so each age um Has are has had to overcome with every age has had to overcome now it's an incredible thing when you think of each age having to overcome because when you when you think about receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost you think well when you receive the Holy Ghost amen the nature of God is in you um then you're free from any Temptation you're free from um you you you you just it's it's going to be a walk in the part amen there's uh you've got God's life living in you he's living his life through you and um amen so uh don't have to worry about lust you don't have to worry about uh evil thoughts don't have to worry about a lot of things but it's it's quite the opposite amen because now there is a desire within you Amen to live the life of God and yet Satan is there to hinder you in every way so each one of these Seven Ages every one of them and there was Bar None all seven of them was was given rewards when they overcame so so you just because you have the Holy Ghost amen does not make you an automatic Overcomer it gives you something to overcome with amen so we're setting in this building here today and many of times when we're preaching the gospel and and and and we're laying it out there and and Satan can turn around and tell you you must not have the Holy Ghost many times amen Satan will tell you uh well you know you just must not have your life together or you must be this you must not be bride or you must listen amen you are still living in a in a in a body it's a carnal body you're dealing with a carnal spirit amen and and you are you are having to overcome amen but there is something I'm thankful to for the gra of God within us amen because the grace of God within us has given us the power to overcome the wisdom to overcome given us the tools Amen to live an overcoming life amen now if we uh brother brandham would say he'd say now now each Church age the same overcome when uh some out of each age uh overcome the temptation of that age he says I've got the scripture here I I don't think we really have the time to make it each one of the church ages the same now it's just uh just like someone he he says as I said in the at the beginning you are you are born defeated and that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated and you are in a defeated World amongst defeated people that uh among defeated Creeds and defeated denominations you've got to come to Victory someway amen so so we were all born defeated and there's no way that you're going to overcome anything you young people will never overcome lust uh uh you you men will never overcome lust you women will never overcome lust amen I don't care how young how old amen you don't outgrow I heard someone say well that time comes when you outgrow it no you don't out grow it amen Sin is Sin and this nature you you you amen you'll never defeat the Devil in your flesh amen you have to be born again yes sir amen but what I have found in many of times is that amen we we uh we can live we allow Satan to keep us in a condemned state man and and as long as you are uh you allow the enemy to keep uh H the cloud over your head you will never defeat the enemy because the scripture says this is the victory that overcomes the world even condemnation amen now now you bunch of you said amen when you shouldn't have said Amen on that one there amen this is the victory that over cometh the world even our amen now I've got you wondering okay I'm going to keep my mouth shut this time you say even our faith you can't overcome with condemnation that's right and Satan wants to condemn you and and and make you feel you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost make you feel that you cannot overcome make you feel and as long as there is a question mark in your mind then you are Defeated come on well praise the Lord amen you see but there there's got to be a faith uh the power of faith that brings about the Overcomer an overcomer is an overcomer because he is confident that he can fight and that he can win amen an overcomer is not something that just happens an overcomer is one that knows who he is and and is willing to put everything on the line to fight that devil amen there's been many too many people that lay down to the devil because you feel like amen because you're Waring against something in your mind or you're Waring against something in your flesh amen you and and and and you're Waring and you're in the middle of a battle and then Satan talks you out of your weapon and you lay that weapon down and say well I must not be a Christian or I must not be a believer or I must not be in the Bri and Satan will sit there and he'll talk you out of that amen and you lay the weapon down a and just amen allow the thing to take over your life I'm going to tell you today we're in a war amen we're in a war and somebody's got to keep that weapon in your hand and defeat the enemy amen now listen this is the last stage of the journey we are in the last age this is the time that the power of the holy spirit this this this is where amen darkness and and light is is is coming to its final uh uh battle and the only way light will win is When the Children of light stand their pace and say I refuse to allow the enemy to win in my life I you may be battling here this morning but that don't mean amen that you're a part of the enemy if you've got a weapon in your hand keep that weapon in your hand if you've got a desire to serve God that I say this morning lift up that weapon and you defeat the enemy because the greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world Amen amen you've got to defeat the enemy can you say amen amen now he he says brother Brandon would say it's just like the Lily whereas the Lily I think is one of the most prettiest flowers there is I'm very fond of those little kala lies and pond lies I I I think there's nothing hardly as pretty as a big Pond Lily call it a water lily you know how it's its Radiance and where it he says where does it come from it comes from a little seed in the bottom of a muddy Mucky Pond and that little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in it is in is in it right then when it's in that mud and but it is it it has to strive daily knowing that there is something it's black it's dirty it's Mucky amen it's slimy in that slime that it's living in yet it presses its way it presses its uh it praise the Lord let me get this it restes its way through the mud the mck the waters the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what's been hid in it all the time I think that's an overcomer that was once in sin once did things that was wrong don't worry about it now once did those things that was wrong amen why why look back there in the pond again and what do you have see God by his predestination see he's brought his seed to life expressing itself see it come coming to life now on top of all that it has overcome can I hear a great big amen amen there will come a time of overcoming Hallelujah there will come a reward time for everyone who has fought the Battle well praise the Lord amen now now I know I know Hallelujah and I you know Israel if Israel listens to the us amen it'll end up surrendering its weapons it'll end up going right back in there and allowing hamus you know Hamas to live a a and to continue to Reign but but Israel if they're going to defeat the enemy they're going to have to ignore Russia they're going to have to ignore every other Diplomat and they're going to say Hamas shall never survive amen amen now if they're going to play politics uh Israel will quit fighting here before long and amen and allow the enemy to continue to live are you hearing me and the devil wants you to do the same thing I I'm not a prophet and I'm not saying what's going to happen over there we know the end product but I'm saying as far as you're concerned the enemy will try to tell you amen we need a ceasefire the enemy will try to tell you well you're taking this too far the enemy will tell you amen you know well you've done just enough I want to say here this morning I will not quit until I have overcome the enemy in my life I am not going to quit praying I am not going to quit believing I am not going to quit reading I'm not going to quit confessing I'm not going to quit preaching I'm not going to quit testifying I'm going to defeat the enemy because I'm anointed to do so do I have anyone that's anointed to do so here today amen Satan you can't talk me out of it you can't turn me around you have pushed me too far you have pushed my family too far you have defeated in too many cases I will prevail I will overcome on that's good can you say Amen you're born to overcome you're born to defeat the enemy that's right amen now you've always been a ly you always were a Lily that's not the problem you've got to overcome in the bottom of that pond Hallelujah and it's put there by predestination now he says it doesn't Express itself down there it's getting up to express itself neither did you and your sin or adultery and everything you lived in you didn't Express nothing but there was a seed in there and it's got a chance to PR itself into life and now you're in the presence of Jesus Christ with the sunlight and it's brought out what what you really was in the beginning and you you see what I mean you saw the light you believed God you laid your heart open and now you're a lily you remember my sermon on the Lily Reverend Lily how he toiled and and and yet he did not spin H yet Solomon in all of his glory is not a raid like one of these look at him he raised up he takes nothing for himself the Lily don't care nothing about himself what does he do he throws his Beauty out his life out that others may see his life is expressed out that others might see the glory what's in him that was in him in that mud see now he's on the top that's the Overcomer he overcome the mud he overcome the things of the world and now he freely gives himself out everybody can look at him his life you can't put a finger on him he's a real Overcomer amen you can't you can't say nothing about him now you say he came out of the mud but he's not in the mud now he's on top of it amen you can't pinpoint back what he was what is he now he is on the top well somebody shout hallelujah amen there's coming a Time Victory days coming coming where you can no longer point of me in the pond but you're going to see that I'm on top of the pond you know why because there's something on the inside of me that says I shall Prevail amen hallelujah now when you're born again amen there's those two laws that lay on the inside of you there was a question that was given to brother brandham concerning uh Romans 7:14 18 we know that the law is is is spiritual and I am carnal so under sin for that which I would do for what I would I that I would not and what I hate that I do if then I do that which is good uh or if I do that which I would not uh brother bram's reading this it says unto the law consent to the law that it is good uh now then it is no more I that doeth it but sin that dwelleth in me and then it says I cannot understand this I cannot understand now brother Brandon would give his interpretation as well they wrote out the scripture uh that's Paul speaking in Romans let me just kind of Polish it up so you can see it he says in me is two persons right one wants me uh right one wants me to do wrong the other wants me to do and every time that I start to do right then wrong hinders me how many of you people on the interviews this afternoon has run the same thing in this morning the same thing as I spoke on this morning temporarily you're an outward man which is controlled by six senses you're an inward man controlled by one sense which is Faith and this Faith disagrees with the all the uh all the six senses in the six senses doesn't agree with faith but one con one is contrary to the other and now as long as the six senses agree with faith that's wonderful but when the six senses disagrees with Faith then leave the six senses alone for for instance Jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true the outside man reasons that it cannot be true then ignore the outside man and accept the inside man amen well praise the Lord amen now now he's giv us some pointers here Amen to to the overcoming Satan is going to be right there troubling you he's going to be right there pushing your buttons and if he can talk you out of your weapon amen you'll let's lay your weapon down and say well amen I thought I was an overcomer but now you know here's these thoughts or I can't believe that oh my goodness I a no you stand right there Toe to Toe with the Enemy amen praise the Lord amen you've got to do it can you say Amen there's a difference there's a difference in a in in in in in a pig and a sheep there's a difference in desire amen but just because the Sheep has has a different nature of a pig does not mean that the that the Sheep does not get dirty does not get muddy does not go through the can you say Amen man but it's that word that lays on the inside of you that soul will stay with the word of God every time amen that soul will stand right up and say no amen I'm going to stand for what God says can you say amen he says now he says the same thing that Paul's speaking of he was sold under the law to carnal sin every one of us is the same that's the reason we we have the troubles we do married four or five times this and that all kinds of sins and adulteries and everything else along in our lives is because of those things we're carnal but and that part must perish but then inside we're a spirit man the soul inside that's faith in God's word and then we bring our outside body in subjection to the word by faith accepting what God Said how can I take a Cocker and and and and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do the only way that I can I it can be is because inside the Cocker has been transmitted a a cckar wheat uh from a cockabur uh uh wheat to a germ called wheat life and then you bury that Cocker it'll produce the grain of wheat that's right see because there has been a life of wheat put in the Cocker the life of the Cocker has been taken out but the nature of the cckar is still sticky see and it will be until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up when it comes forth amen it'll be no more Cocker but but wheat but while it's on Earth and in out of the earth a a Cocker is still Cocker it's still sticky it's got the nature on the inside of Wheat and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature and that's going to bother you as long as you live but on the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin is gone from you and that's the thing can you say amen amen so so we live here in this in this body this defeated body amen this body is defeated there's no way you can paint it up there's no way you can Church it up there's no way you can can you say amen amen the only way you're going to bring anything about this body under control is through the soul that is on the inside of you that's the only way and that's what the holy spirit is for amen that's what the scripture says about the about your uh you know uh your words amen they say that you could you can train a ship you could amen you could you with a Rudder you can you can move things amen and control horses with a bit but he says but the mouth is something that just cannot be tamed amen why because there amen here we here we live in this body amen here we live in this carnal nature here we can you say Amen I'm the all of man is where the Holy Ghost lives and the Holy Ghost must take authority of that flesh amen hallelujah now if it's your nature amen and you love sin and you love gambling and you love adultery and you love those kinds of things amen well I'm going to tell you there ain't nothing Temptation about that that's who you are come on come on that that's who you are that's what you want to do you amen you love line and you amen and you'll Justified you love wearing your pants and you Justified you love those things and you'll Justified it's because your Nature has not been changed but if you've got the power of the holy spirit that has given you a new birth and the power of an unlimited God has transformed that soul amen then there's something that rises up and says I disagree with that mind I disagree with what this flesh is telling me I disagree well can you say amen amen I'm going to overcome somebody say I'm an overcomer I'm an overcomer I'm an overcomer amen not because it's here I'm an overcomer because I've been born again by the power of the Holy Ghost and there's no weapon that is formed against me that is going to prosper I shall I shall I shall overcome the evil one in my life and you see man amen you've got the two laws amen that are war in you praise the Lord you got the enemy amen and remember you weren't supposed to you weren't supposed to have this carnal nature that you're dealing with and when you get on the other side there's where we're going to be free it'll be the same Soul without the carnal nature can you imagine coming to church with no carnal nature can you imagine being able to worship God Before the Throne without condemnation can you imagine being able to come a oh come on church that's what's going to be there amen as you come to church here this morning you're Before the Throne of God Amen the only thing that's see hindering you from seeing God's throne here this morning is your carnal eyes your carnal feelings uh your carnal emotions but when that body takes on Hallelujah when that Soul takes on a glorified body we will see him as he is hall hallelujah amen now Jesus says I want you to watch and I want you to pray Mark 14 and 38 lest you enter into temptation the spirit truly is really is ready but the flesh is weak now I want you to be careful I want you to watch you're going to have to be diligent here because temptation's coming well praise the Lord amen now Jesus experienced it amen and and I'm looking for the I'm looking for the scripture Hallelujah Jesus there is he's going to Calvary by Revelation he knows that he's got to Die the plan of God is unfolded before him he tells his disciples there in Luke 22 and 39 he's he's letting them know that temptation is coming and you've got to cover yourself with prayer so that you amen are not overcome with temptation Luke 22:39 he come out and went and as he was want to the Mount of Olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at that place at the place he said unto them pray ye pray that ye enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's Thro cast and kneel down and prayed and saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done now now the scripture says that he was in in great Agony if you were to read there in the Book of Matthew it says that he was in great Agony agonizing asking God to take this hour from him his flesh he had the Holy Ghost but he was agonizing he was the very God in flesh and yet that fles was in agonizing that's right come on I don't want to go through this if it's your will let this C pass from me on on come on Church did that did that reduce him from being the Son of God did that reduce him from the Having the Holy Ghost on the inside of him man the Apostle Paul says in the days of his flesh he was troubled sore he was perplexed he was huren he was in agony Temptation was upon him yeah but he went to prayer and Jesus is telling them you need to go to prayer that you be not overcome with the temp ation and the scripture says that Jesus went to prayer and as he was praying amen he he said man father this 42nd verse father if it be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be will be done and there appeared an angel unto him from Heaven strengthening him he's he's he's facing the temptation of his life and in order to fight he goes to prayer in order to fight he goes to prayer and he's asking God I I don't want to go through with this but yet I'm willing to surrender my will to you and then an angel appears unto him amen from Heaven strengthening him and being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat as it were uh a drop grape jocks of blood falling down to the ground and when he rose from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow and he said why sleep you rise and pray lest you enter into temptation now we understand that they succumb to the Temptation we understand that they were defeated by the Temptation they all forsook him what can you say man now amen but when they go to the upper room and they are filled with the power of the Holy Ghost we find that there is something else that comes well can you say Amen so when Jesus is saying there in Mark 14 and 38 watch ye and pray lest you be overcome with temptation for the spirit is truly willing truly ready but the flesh is weak winning requires diligence now are you are y'all hearing I'm I'm talking to Holy Ghost filled people here this morning winning requires diligence amen what are you feeding are you feeding your caral man no wonder you can't overcome for you will reap what you sow when you you sold to this flesh you shall of the flesh reap corruption but if you soow unto the spirit you shall of the spirit reap amen of eternal life that's right can you say amen amen so it's in it's in your it's in your hands Paul is talking to the church says now you want to se under corruption amen then so if you want to reap corruption then sew into the flesh now if it's it's it's it's quite an amazing thing that brother Brenham says the amen the pressure of this age is soft living easy and soft living that's the pressure of this age and that's how the enemy is is defeating the H uh the the church today is because of the the the Easy Living amen well praise the Lord I don't care who you are amen who who I don't care who feels like they've got it the worst in this entire church you've got it easy baby amen you've got it easy you've got a soft pillow amen and I don't care if your bed is a hundred years old amen it's better than what they had in back in the early church praise the Lord amen I don't care what it is amen you when when when you're going blind you can wear glasses amen when you hurt yourself you've got served a a a doctors when you amen when you you need another car you can you can get a car and if you ain't got a car you can get a taxi or somebody to help you well come on Church we're living in the age of soft living this is easy living this is soft living and because of the softness that we're living in it's taken away the drive to overcome that's right that's praise the Lord amen what are you feeding well brother Wendell I don't I don't do anything I I amen hallelujah but you're feeding on that sorry phone all the time look on your phone when you not not not in service this morning but leave when you leave the building and see amen look up on your memory and see how much time you spent per day on that phone this week just this week hallelujah look look see what you've got on that phone amen see how many hours per day is spent on that phone am amen you know what you're feeding you're feeding the flesh you used to go on shopping binges once a week or once every two weeks you used to now you're shopping every day hours a day and you wonder why you can't overcome well praise the Lord hallelujah you've got to feed on the right things in order to overcome in this age brother brandham gave the illustration amen about a a Native American amen uh uh I believe he was an Apache who had received the Holy Ghost he was converted and he said someone asked him how are you getting along and he said pretty good and pretty bad he said well now how do you mean by pretty good and pretty bad he saidwell since me received the Holy Ghost there's been two dogs in me one of them's a black dog and one of them is a white dog he said they argue all the time they growl and fight at one another the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to do bad and the man said well Chief which one of them wins the fight he said depends on which one Chief feeds the most so brother bradam says so I think that's a good answer here see there just depends on the wiring of the body that's in you and it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature of the things of God that does it now Brothers there's where we're at and there's where the responsibility comes back upon you because I'm going to tell you only the Overcomer is going to sit with him in his throne you're not going to have you're not going to sit on that throne and reign with Christ without overcoming well praise the Lord you say well I I no no God's given you the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's given you the power of God within you amen you know how to deight the enemy you know what causes you to trip up you know how the enemy comes in with his Temptations then brother if you know where the Temptations lie that's where you put the Holy Ghost that's where you put the word of God that's where you stand there and say I'm not coming near that area I am going well praise the Lord amen the enemy you know you you know the enemy wants to tempt you to talk the enemy wants to tempt you to you know to gossip amen then you're going to stay as far away from that because the Soul on the inside of you amen cannot stand the defilement of your heart and your mind and your years and you're going to you're going to you're going to walk away from that Hallelujah well praise the Lord amen and then you're going to take God at his word you're going to walk with God's word you're going to stand upon God's word amen you're going to pray that the Holy Ghost comes upon you and before you know it you are walking in Victory because somebody has fed the spirit manine Hallelujah I want to tell you we want the black dog amen to starve to death and we want the white dog Amen to be plump and fat amen and strong overcoming what can you say man amen I know there's dog lovers in the place but we want the we want the black dog to die we want the we want the white dog to live can you say Amen we don't want this nature Amen to usurp its authority over the soul that God has given me at the new B Earth I refuse to elect amen malice and envy to hang on to my life I don't care how much that enemy wants to tell me that I have a right to Amen to be offended I refuse to stay offended I refuse Amen to allow the enemy to work and to live and to reign in me amen not when greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world Amen not when the power of the Eternal life is living in me Amen to make me an overcomer brother I'm going to get up I'm going to take my weapon I'm going to defeat the enemy because I'm called to do so amen amen amen now Revelations 3 And1 because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation because you have chose to live the life of an overcomer and staying with that word I'm also going to stand I'm also going to Def I'm also going to keep you in the hour of Temptation come on Church Hallelujah now amen and and and he says I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy Crown he that overcometh somebody say that's me that's me he that overcometh that's that's me you can do better than that he that overcometh that's will I make a pillar put that up there in amen we're back in Revelations 3 and12 him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and everybody read this last those five words with me and he shall go no more out maybe a little more than five words amen and he what is it he's found he's wearing the Overcomer badge oh the devil telling you that you ain't going to overcome the devil telling you that you can't I'm here to tell you just look at him and go Hallelujah I'm an overcomer the power of eternal life lives in me can you say Amen now Jesus talks about the word not having a root and if you ain't got a if you ain't got a Bible life and a prayer life then you're not feeding the white dog that's right and because of soft living and because our agenda is so big listen 70 years ago women didn't leave their houses they stayed there and took care of their children they prayed for their husbands they didn't have all of this other stuff going on all the time brother Ram talks about about Susanne Wesley raising what 10 11 kids and she would have to walk a mile every day just to get her water but they say history says that she prayed two and three hours a day for her children and It produced a John Wesley and a Charles Wesley there was a sense of responsibility to overcome today we've got washing machines we've got microwaves I'm hitting you women for a minute we've got we've got everything and yet we still have no time for prayer we still still have no time to carry burdens for our husbands who are out there fighting demons right you say why you picking on us brother bradam says the woman is the backbone of the home he said Satan has got the women out of the house that's right and now there's no time for prayer now there's no time amen there's no time for the children to ever hear anyone interceding for their souls and begging God to fill them with the Holy Ghost and tell our children all they know is just coming to church amen that's really the only prayer they ever hear amen of someone saying it behind the pulpit because we can't even pray even before church anymore we can't even pray during an altar service anymore there's there's no travail anymore why we are under the burden of Easy Living it ain't because we ain't got the Holy Ghost so we need to stir that Holy Ghost up well praise the Lord you Brothers ain't a you Hallelujah you ain't brother bradam brother bradam talks about his early life he said I'd go out and walk those lines 30 30 m a day he said I'd go out there and walk those lines be so wore out he said then when I would come back into the house amen he said hope knew hope knew that I would be back out there on the streets till midnight witnessing and telling somebody about Jesus well praise the Lord amen he said I've done this all the time I was up and down I amen he talked about how that when he would walk the lines I I was reading some quotes there where he walked amen he says you know he was as a lineman he'd have to walk those lines he said he said he would have to go 30 miles again you know a day and I and he said amen he said he would still find time to talk to a farmer tell him about Jesus he says he would baptize him amen they would say well I'm going to come down someday and get back get get baptized brother brother Brandon would look over and see a crick or to see a see a pond and he says here's water what does hinder you amen right then and there he would just get right down in there baptize him amen then he'd get back up and put his hat on and go on down somewhere else he said sometimes he baptized multiple people a day but what was the desire there there was some Well church are y'all listening to me you can't tell me that the Holy Ghost ain't got that same kind of Desire today and the reason the Holy Ghost doesn't have that same kind of a desire and living its kind of a life within us is because we got too many fat dogs around amen black dogs amen fat and laying around and and we're all well praise the Lord what we need is the pillar of fire Amen to come back Upon Our Hearts and say God Amen Let me live God I want to overcome not just for myself but I want to overcome for my neighbor I want to overcome for my sister Hallelujah man him that overcometh will I make a pillar and he shall go no more around now Luke 8 and13 Jesus talking about the word he says now when the word they on the Rock are they which hear receive the word with joy come to church and rejoice with it but because the word doesn't take root and these have no root which for a while believe and in the time of Temptation Fall Away you see God do God God does not want us taking the word jumping out there only to back up he wants us to take the word that we're hearing well glory to God well I hear the word the word just wonderful hallelujah amen but it's sad when it comes to Monday morning we don't even know what the preacher preached on well glory to God Amen you say brother when now you're getting into legalism no I am here to tell you somebody better overcome and the only way you're going to overcome praise the Lord on is to quit doing the little Twitter Twitter thingy things with your with your thumb and all that kind of stuff and get down to some good old amen knees that like you know become camel like like camel hooves like John Knox used to have amen John Knox they said we used to pray so much that that that his knees were so calloused amen but he had such a burden he had such a well come on Church how many wants to overcome in this age anyways listen if you if you that desire is not there I'm here to tell you it can be there oh God let me fast from this world let sin lose its grip and let their the desire and the power of that Divine holy spirit so live and Reign and rule in me hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus said there in Matthew 6 and12 as he's teaching them to pray and he says forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the power and the kingdom and the glory he says I don't want you to go in anywhere I I I want you to go to that go to Jerusalem and I want you to wait until you be endued with power from on high in another place Jesus says the kingdom is within you the reigning power The Authority the word will live with the power of the Holy Ghost thy kingdom come thy will be done are you hearing me next time the devil tells you well you don't have the Holy Ghost why don't you just tell him to suck an egg why don't you just tell him that you're the power You've Got The Power of an unlimited God on the inside of you and you have been trying to trip me up and turn me around way too long but I'm here to tell you I'm willing to die to myself listen that's that is that's that's what the cross is that's what this gospel is about death burial and Resurrection you've got to die if you're going to reign with Christ you've got to give you got to die to yourself you got to die to your nature you got to die to those kinds of things what can you say Amen you got to die to those things so that you can rise and live with Christ in his word well praise the Lord there's only one Waters of Separation that brass labor when that brass Laver in mind they would take the lamb at the brass Altar and they would amen they amen they slew him and they burnt and they would take the ashes and they pour it into the sprinkle it into that water and and this was a a ceremony uh sanctification the amount of cleansing of leprosy and sin and the word gave is life and now the word is the washing now we wash ourselves with the washing of the Water by the word well praise the Lord amen and there there in Hebrews 9 and13 it says for if the blood and of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heer sprinkling the unclean and sanctify to the purifying of the flesh how much more the shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God oh can you say Amen brother brenon would say he would say the word became flesh the word became flesh to take all the enmity against you and then the word became your flesh through the baptism of the Holy Ghost the word empowers you so it's the bleeding bloody word today that we are cleansed by and we overcome with oh brother W I don't know if I can overcome I say you can I say you canl there's a whole world against Israel right now say you can't do that and they're giving them every excuse why they cannot do what they're doing they're accusing of war crimes they're accusing them of genocide they're accusing them and listen I am not against the Palestinian people lots of in innocent people are dying but I want to tell you when you've got an evil in your heart you've got a do what it takes to get that evil out that's right come on church that old devil will hide right inside your flesh and sometimes you're trying to tell the preacher man you quit preaching man you're you're you're hurting people he's trying to get that devil on the inside of that flesh can you say man The Whole World's trying to tell them you can't you can't you can't Hallelujah as of right now they got a leader saying we will and we shall come on man I think we need to do that with the church the Living God we need to do that within our heart oh God I I don't care how much it kills me I don't care how much is need there needs to be a dying there needs to be a killing there needs to be a window Mar laying on the altar of of God's altar amen laying there saying God not my will but thy will be done amen now we need the power amen we need to rise in the power of the Holy G go am I making any sense to you here this morning amen I say there is overcoming I say that God is with us I say the anointing is upon you kill those amalekites kill those Philistines kill them drive them out and kill them Lord they hide up in our lives they hide amen they want to rule and they want to reain Hallelujah but we can't allow this flesh to rule and and rain we can't allow our appetites and our desires to rule and reain God's called Overcomers in this day can you say amen amen you see they would sprinkle those ashes and as they would look into the water of Separation they would begin to hold their image behold their image and amen the Apostle Paul picks it up there in the book of Ephesians 5 and 24 n where it says you know therefore as the church is subject to Christ so let the wives be subject to their own husbands and amen husbands love your wives even as Christ has loved the church and gave himself for it and then it goes on down I believe to the 25th verse to the 26th verse amen where it talks about how he gave him self for it that he might sanctify it with the washing of Water by the word and there's a reason that he's doing this he's he's referring back he's referring back to the Waters of Separation he's referring back to that to that labor he amen that Brazen labor that's where amen that the Brazen altar is see judged and amen has been put on that lamb and now we're taking the Brazen labor where the water is reflecting our image and we are saying let me become what that lamb was let the Innocence let the power let your word live in me can you say amen and what is his purpose amen that he might sanctify it amen that he might wash it that he might cleanse it to well praise the Lord that he might present it unto himself a church without wrinkle without spot or without any such blemish well well I when I if I had the Holy Ghost I wouldn't struggle what is struggling your Soul's not struggling your body struggling that caral Nature's struggling that caral nature wants to live We Lay ourselves upon God's altar according to Romans amen the 12th chapter you can put that up there sister Keys Romans 12 And1 hallelujah amen where it says I beseech you Brethren by the mercies of God somebody say mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice that is a kicking screaming that is a that's an Agony that is something that is that is toing within a giving sacrifice that is Holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and then he goes down and he tells them the only way you're going to do this is by the renewing of your mind sister ke would you mind going on down to that one and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind These Are Holy Ghost filled people that God is saying don't be conformed to this world but you can be transformed in other words the power of life is laying in You by the power of the Holy Ghost you can overcome because he overcome you can live this life because he lived that life and he says that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God hallelujah hallelujah so my purpose for preaching here this morning is to get us past first base I believe there's some of us amen maybe a lot of us are hung up when I don't have the Holy Ghost and the devil is condemning you and that devil is trying to tell you that you can't amen Hallelujah and he's got that cloud of unbelief you're down here amen you want to be praying Hallelujah y'all like my drawing praise the Lord amen on your knees are praying and calling out to God Amen and Satan is up here he's the prince of the power of the air he's that one that blocked it to Daniel he's that one that tries to keep your prayers from going through he's the one that when you're praying amen it seems seems like it's coming right back down he's the one that's saying you'll never overcome he's the one that's saying you don't have the Holy Ghost why is he saying that because he don't want you winning he don't want you fighting he don't want you casting him out and the only way that you're going to overcome this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith we have that great God above us and we can come to God In Prayer we can call upon his name we can come to him that throne of grace for help in the time of need it's a promise brother W I pray and I pray and I pray and I pray some told me brother wend it's just the age we live amen only a few is going to be saved and and so the life of God is just prayer is going to be Harden I I I I get it I get it it's not the same as it used to be it used to be if you were going to call out to God and name the name of Jesus I'd come and kill you when I was your enemy you you you you were you you were want to die for your faith today it's not that way it's in the invisible real and it happens right up here Satan's trying to tell you that you can't and you won't you're not good enough that you'll never overcome he tries to tell you but that's where you've got to stand there where we have got an authority over the powers of darkness and say I I refuse to Bow amen this is where your prayer this is where you can Prevail and say no I'm a child of God and I can and I will overcome amen I do have purpose I will yes come on it would be easier if I had a gun up to your head and you loved God and you say just kill me get get it over with I love him I'm going to go to heaven but it's not that way on it's that invisible realm it's the powers of Darkness that fight they want you to stay Earthbound yeah that's right they want you to be under their control but we've been ordained to go above all principalities and Power powers and those spiritual wickedness and the only way you're going to do that is to get rid of that condemnation that's constantly telling you you're a wannabe are you hearing me am I making any kind of sense do get all there this morning you see the only way that we're going to rise in the power of these promises let me let me let me just look here let's just let's just see what the scripture says First Corinthians 7:1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse 2 Corinthians 7:1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God having these promises what promises the Divine promise of eternal life through the baptism of the Holy Ghost having these promises Brethren let us well glory to God cleanse cleanse you can take the word and you can cleanse you can walk you can wash that garment you can I know what Satan is trying to do I know what he's trying to say I know well praise the Lord Amplified says therefore since these great promises are ours beloved let let us cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates and defiles the body and spirit and bring our consecration to completeness in the reverential fear of God can you say Amen perfecting Holiness perfecting Holiness what does perfect mean accomplish execute complete to take upon oneself to make an end for oneself to appoint to to oppose upon in other words amen I am going to accomplish Holiness I am going to execute and complete I will defeat that enemy amen oh you can come at me you can come at me one way but you're going to go in seven ways you can come and and and try to come against my family but I'm here to tell you I've got nuclear weapons I'm going to take that weapon of faith I'm going to stand Toe to Toe I am going to defeat you so help me God can you say amen amen he'll tell you you preachers that you're not preachers stand up and say you're a liar and we'll tell you m you're not believer stand up and say you're a liar he'll tell you daddies that you're not an overcomer stand up resist him and say I shall defeat you now Paul gives he gives an example there in First Corinthians 10 he's talking about a lot of examples of unbelief and but then he's also talking to the elect and he 12th verse he says wherefore let him thinketh that he stands take key lest he falls okay so the mentality that says I've arrived might show your lack of spiritual perception because you're never going to arrive in this body come on you're never going to arrive I believe that we'll come to the unity of faith I believe that we'll come to that point I believe that we there will come that point at the rapturing of the church I believe that but brother praise the Lord I'm not one that beli that when you receive the Holy Ghost you're immune from sin that's right if you're immune from sin then you don't need the blood of Jesus anymore but I'm here to tell you let him that thinks that he stands take heed lest he falls Amen in other words there's no room for arrogancy here there's no room we got to stand stand upon the word of God and great humility if there's ever a time for humility I believe that church I believe this last day bride will be one of profound humility a humbleness a humbleness that is looking to him and never to himself a humbleness that is saying

pretty girls well Glory good preachers somebody thought they stood there's an all but that's the elect of God I hey to listen the Apostle Paul amen where where's that scripture at L I become a Castaway brother M you know that one right off hand amen lest I become a Castaway L while I've preached to others Allelujah amen but I keep under let's go let's go up another let's go up two verses every man that striveth for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Inc I'm talking about an overcomer but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainty I'm not I'm not I'm not just no I've got a goal in mine I got a goal in mine and I'm going to win come on church that's why I I that that that that that's why I I I I'm saying you know and I and I and and I and I tell this to men especially what that phone he'll slip up on you on Fox News Fox News has become nothing but a striptise and I always bring this up because that's what I look at as Fox News amen and I see the things that are constantly there on that news channel yes sir that Satan will want to try to take in and plant seeds come on folks sir Fox News is they're not they're not family oriented at all they're as filthy they're as filthy as filthy can be and most of our conservative talk show hosts are that way too amen getting divorces marrying others and having an Affairs and I don't care who you rever amen some of you revered Rush limau he was married three times what kind of a family man is that Sean Hannity he's been divorced and remarried and we want to listen and put that kind of junk in our mind three hours a day we rush ain't alive no more Bo boast nerdly taking his place amen so we got every we we got we and and we put this stuff in our Spirits s around we're looking at the news all day long you're putting that filth in your spirits well it's no wonder you can't overcome you're praying to overcome and then you're you're you're right there looking at that stuff instead of in the time of prayer we are SOC coming to those things when God's given us a message of the hour to overcome with right and on that same phone you can push play yes sir but your flesh don't want to listen to that does it and now let's go to sports and you put that no wonder you ain't got no love for nobody no wonder you ain't got no no no no no heart to help anybody no wonder you ain't got no no no heart amen for prayer for anybody no why because it is wrapped up into the news and sports and everything else you ain't got time for that soul to thrive good job brother W keep it up Hallelujah I used to be able to Pat my back now I just Pat my chest amen we ain't got time to thrive because you're making the executive decision in the throne room of your heart you're choosing to put something else over the law of Christ well praise the Lord and now money's involved you're paying for your stuff stuff you ain't got time to do nothing else but pray in prayer because amen we're we're living in such a amen perilous times what can you say amen amen but the scripture says wherefore let him that thinketh that he standeth take heed lest he fall there no temptation taken you but is comeon to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above all that you're able but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to be it he's not telling you that you're going to take you out of the Temptation he's giving you a way to overcome it he's not taking you out of Le oosa he's simply given you the weapon to overcome it he's not taking the the he's not taking things away from us you've got to be able to take the Holy Ghost and make you the executive decision to stand for his word amen still living in Le Osa well praise the Lord Lord amen thank you someone's training those kids upright Hallelujah who said that who's the one said amen all right brother Silas amen but God 1 Timothy 6 and6 and I'm closing 1 Timothy 6 and6 but godliness with Tempt with contentment is great gain godliness somebody say godliness to be like God to reflect him to have his approval and to be content with that is great game for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out I heard a message preacher tell me one time of another of another family another he said wow I've been to college and I've done this and I've provided for my family and you look at that man and he's never had no ambition to do anything he just worked at a little clunky job he's not done much of anything and he's just a bum has nothing now he can't take care of himself and can't take care of this and can't take care of that and and I'm looking at this message preacher that's telling me this and I'm thinking y where's the spirituality for your children where are they at this man chose the right thing yeah he might not have everything but he worked hard he worked hard for his family worked hard for his wife he wasn't lazy he went to work he might not have made made money like you might not have known how to invest like you might not have the smarts like you but in my thoughts I'm thinking while you're making fun of that dude you're making fun of me cuz that's really the way I sort of operate too I want to please the Lord nothing wrong with money in the bank not a thing wrong I I Hallelujah we all should be good Savers but it's not in the what's in your bank and it's not the kind of money you make you can get out there make all kinds of money and be a numb skull spiritually that's right so numb you don't even notice your own family you don't even notice that you're not walking with God you can't even see in your own heart that you're not you you there's no burning deep down desire for prayer there's no deep down desire for a closer walk with God you're you're you're you you can't even discern that that the lack of of of steady time and and revered prayer time is lacking that sounds like a lukewarm Le Osan that's neither hot nor cold but feels pretty content with a lukewarm experience on good preaching brother wend keep it up thank you I will Hallelujah needed that where's amen I need another amen back there Silas praise the Lord I brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out having Fon and reignment let us there withth be content for they that will be rich fall into temptation we're talking about Temptation today and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and predition For the Love of Money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with many Sorrows but thou oh man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life whereinto Thou Art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses can you say Amen Let Me cleanse myself having these promises what are these promises it's the promise of an overcoming life it's the promise that he that is in you is greater turn to your neighbor and say he that is in you is greater oh Hallelujah I'm not a beger I was up at 2 o'clock this morning in my living room tears streaming down my face praying for members of this congregation CU I I just felt something drop in my spirit I felt something just drop to let them know I've given them my promise to overcome I've given them the Holy Ghost don't let the devil take that weapon away from you take up that sword of the spirit because you're Overcomer you're big in God's eyes he's already taken the picture of you the picture he has of you that Christ is interceding for it's not your bad he's not interceding for your bad he's not interceding for your sin he's not interceding for none of that he is ex he is interceding for God's word there is a predestinated seat on the inside of you and he is interceding for that seed he's representing you you are in the mind of God I don't know if you feel the anointing out there but I feel it up here and I say boo devil boo devil can you say am man boo devil he says now as the musicians come he says we're all baptized into one body in the domain of that Kingdom one spiritual baptism no matter how good how bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by the Holy by Holy Ghost baptism that's the only way you'll overcome it's all that is under the blood the shed blood is Overcomers because you can't overcome yourself it's he that overcome for you and you're resting how do I know then brother brandom that I'm in there what kind of life you're living just look around around see if it's just lived out of you automatically or do you have to strain and Pull and then you're doing then you're doing it but don't try to do it just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve hole he's just up and down and over and everywhere else and he can't do it put on your coat honey he can't do it little arms up and down and around and it takes your Steady Hand and oh how glad I am that I can just yield my hand to the father father and say Lord Jesus I can't get it in there but you help me you put the coat on me and I'll quit trying just let him do it and if the little baby keeps trying and saying oh I can do it I can do it he's just everywhere he can't do it neither can you neither can I but if we just hold still and let him and just yield to him here Lord here I am just let me be nothing I yield I put my hand in the right place that's the victory that's the overcoming the thing you have to overcome is yourself your ideas your things surrender yourselves to him but he's over come for you he knows the way can you say man we want to live in that right it's the life of God in you now you say well brother brandom says if there's no struggle if you're bucking there's a difference in a fighting the enemy and bucking the system if you're bucking the word of God you need the Holy Ghost but most holy ghost filled Christians that I know of want to serve God their desire is in line with the word of God but it's the enemy it wants to pull them this way and that way and they're not off the hook they're not off the hook you're not off the hook if you're not overcoming you ain't going in a Rapture God's giving you that Holy Ghost to overcome with that's right but I'm telling you don't be asking for a weapon if he's already given it to you pick up your weapons you hear me I love him this morning oh there ain't going to be a whole bunch of us there was eight in the days of Noah and they overcame there was four men in the Kingdom of Babylon Daniel Shadrach mesach and Abednego but they overcame amen Abraham and Sarah overcame had plenty of things they had to overcome and I'm here to tell you in this dark layot of sea and age I am an overcomer because greater I've already told you that greater buch your neighbor and say greater Is He In Me wash [Music] me wash me wash my mind Wash Me Lord scrub me scrub me let your word be my [Music] absolute Hallelujah [Music] praise the [Music] Lord praise the Lord

says this his word or these Waters of Separation must be kept in a clean place oh wish we could deal on that a little while a clean place the Waters of separation is the word Paul said over here in Ephesians for he has washed us with the water of the word the Waters of Separation the word preaching the word separates you you hear the word you say I'm wrong I better quit this playing Church better quit that that's the Waters of separation and it should be kept in a clean place kept in a clean place now here is where I talked about the other night the reference for the things of God the
