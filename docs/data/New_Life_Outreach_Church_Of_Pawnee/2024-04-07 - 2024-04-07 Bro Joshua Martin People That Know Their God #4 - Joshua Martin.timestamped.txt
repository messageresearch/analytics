[38:24] by that I that was so good I trust you
[38:27] was blessed as well amen I'm thankful
[38:29] that we we get fed pretty good around
[38:31] here amen we got a wonderful a wonderful
[38:34] Pastor that sticks with this message
[38:35] that's all you can ask for amen uh
[38:38] Genesis 12
[38:41] And1 The Bible would say now the Lord
[38:43] had said unto Abram get thee out of thy
[38:45] country and from thy Kindred and from
[38:48] thy Father's House unto a land that I
[38:50] will show thee and I will make thee of a
[38:53] great a great nation I Will Bless thee
[38:56] and make thy name great and thou shalt
[38:58] be a blessing then John
[39:01] 14 and 8 and Philip said unto him Lord
[39:04] show us the father and it sufficeth us
[39:07] and Jesus said unto him have I been so
[39:10] long with you and yet hast thou not
[39:12] known me Phillip he he he that has seen
[39:15] me hath seen the father and how sayest
[39:17] thou then show us the father believest
[39:20] thou not that I am in the father and the
[39:22] father in me and the words that I speak
[39:24] unto you I speak not of myself but the
[39:27] the father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[39:30] The Works amen can we bow our heads this
[39:33] this evening dear gracious Heavenly
[39:35] Father Lord thank you for your love and
[39:37] your mercy Lord thank you for the
[39:38] wonderful word we heard this morning
[39:41] Lord and your spirit is coming Among Us
[39:43] father Lord as we come into this part of
[39:45] the service father I ask that you would
[39:47] Lord help me to get myself out of the
[39:49] way Lord and speak the words that you
[39:51] have for the service Lord God may I not
[39:53] speak my own thoughts or my own ideas
[39:55] Lord but speak what you have for the
[39:57] service Lord we ask these things in your
[39:59] precious name amen you may be seated and
[40:04] so we see that uh Abraham he was
[40:06] separated for a purpose and I like how
[40:09] the Bible is putting it I will make thee
[40:11] a great nation I Will Bless thee and
[40:13] make thy name great it had nothing to do
[40:16] with human ability but I was going to do
[40:19] this and we know that it's been God's
[40:21] desire to have men and women to be in
[40:23] his own image to express himself and
[40:26] like I I had said last time God would
[40:28] unveil himself to Avil himself in
[40:30] humanity and it's telling Abraham not
[40:33] what you can do but what I can do and
[40:36] what I what I like about it it it it
[40:38] would be Moses that would ask the
[40:39] burning bush who do I say sent me and
[40:42] the Bible or the burning bush would say
[40:44] to him say that I am I am the one that
[40:47] sent you and then is the same I am that
[40:49] would give a promise to Moses was the
[40:52] same I am that was speaking to Abraham
[40:54] saying I am going to bless you I am
[40:56] going to multip I am going to to bless
[40:59] your seed so the blessing of God was
[41:01] going to be poured out on Abraham and
[41:03] Abraham was then going to reflect or
[41:07] demonstrate the power of God in his life
[41:10] because the Bible would say he he would
[41:12] stop and say then thou shall be a
[41:14] blessing and though it stops and and
[41:16] went from God saying I'm going to bless
[41:18] you I'm going to make the a great nation
[41:20] I'm going to make thy name great then he
[41:21] stops and he says then thou shall be a
[41:24] blessing so he wasn't doing all of this
[41:26] in vain but AB Abraham had something to
[41:28] do as well Abraham was to take what the
[41:31] Lord was giving him and was to reflect
[41:33] it and I believe that we've got
[41:35] something to do on Earth as well we're
[41:37] not just here living under this message
[41:39] or having a word brought to us just for
[41:41] any other reason but God has given it to
[41:44] us for a purpose and I just love the
[41:46] election of God that God didn't just one
[41:49] day look on Earth and randomly pick
[41:51] Abraham but I believe that Abraham all
[41:54] along was in the mind of God the reason
[41:56] Abraham was on Earth was for the
[41:58] blessing of God to be poured out on him
[42:01] and him to reflect the blessing of God
[42:04] cuz the Bible would tell us in Psalms 3
[42:06] and8 salvation belongeth unto the Lord
[42:09] thy blessing is upon thy people and so
[42:12] the blessing of God wasn't just for
[42:14] anybody but for his people and his
[42:17] people ain't just anybody but it's any
[42:19] predestinated people that God has chosen
[42:23] before the foundation of the world and
[42:25] brother Brandon would say this when he
[42:27] come expressed exactly like the
[42:29] Testament said he would be expressed
[42:32] then all of those who was redeemable
[42:34] believed it because they were the
[42:36] thoughts of God the attributes of him at
[42:39] the beginning was made flesh and
[42:41] redeemable and brought back to God and
[42:44] as many as received him to them gave he
[42:46] the power to become the sons of God
[42:49] because they were redeemable from the
[42:52] beginning in the expression and so since
[42:55] they was redeemable from the beginning
[42:57] beginning they would see what God was
[42:59] doing they would see the thoughts of God
[43:01] being manifested because they was
[43:04] redeemable and I'm so thankful that even
[43:07] though we was in sins and in trespasses
[43:09] and addictions there was something on
[43:11] the inside of us that was always
[43:13] redeemable no matter how far in sin we
[43:16] was there was something on the inside
[43:18] that would respond to the blessing of
[43:20] God and say Lord Use Me Oh Hallelujah
[43:24] and so God would come to Abraham because
[43:26] he was in God's mind from the beginning
[43:29] of from before the foundation of the
[43:31] world and every generation that would
[43:34] come forth after Abraham would reflect
[43:37] the power of God or the power of the
[43:40] devil and so that just because that
[43:42] Jacob was an offspring from Abraham
[43:45] didn't make him a reflection right away
[43:48] he had to come in contact with the same
[43:51] God and receive the same blessing in
[43:54] order to be reflection oh man we can be
[43:57] born in a message church we can be set
[43:59] on a message Pew be a pastor's son a
[44:01] deacon son a song leader son but and
[44:04] before we can be a reflection we first
[44:07] have to receive the blessing so that the
[44:09] power of God can be reflected through us
[44:13] but you see this was so much of a
[44:15] reality that a to Abraham that he would
[44:18] separate himself so and before the
[44:20] blessing but come into manifestation in
[44:24] Abraham's life he first had to reflect
[44:26] himself
[44:27] and you see brother Brandon brother
[44:29] Brandon preaches a message called the
[44:31] Masterpiece and it's and it's an
[44:33] incredible sermon and he talks about
[44:36] Michelangelo that and he created the
[44:38] sculpture of Moses and that sculpture of
[44:40] Moses would start to take on an image
[44:43] and that image was a vision that
[44:45] Michelangelo had in his mind and so as
[44:48] he was shaping this image molding this
[44:50] image it would start to reflect what was
[44:53] in his mind before he even started that
[44:57] project and we see that Abraham would
[45:00] have to separate himself in order to be
[45:03] moted into the image that God would have
[45:06] before the foundation of the world cuz
[45:09] you the Bible would tell us here that
[45:11] after he separated them from lot then
[45:14] the Lord would come to Abraham and say
[45:17] look to Eastward look Westward Look
[45:19] northward look Southward all of this
[45:21] land I will give to you but you notice
[45:24] it was after he separated himself
[45:27] from lot that the blessing of God can
[45:30] then start to be manifested oh my
[45:33] brother brandom says the problem of it
[45:34] is with the Christians is they have an
[45:37] arcade full of blessings but they're not
[45:39] willing to explore it and I like how
[45:41] brother the brand and he talks about or
[45:43] the Bible would talk about Abraham he
[45:45] would say the Lord would say to Abraham
[45:47] arise and walk through the land since he
[45:50] separated himself then the blessings of
[45:52] God would start to pour on him now he
[45:55] could explore what God was given to him
[45:58] oh my once there's a separation from
[46:01] unbelief separation from doubt
[46:03] separation from the things of the world
[46:06] then the blessings of God can start to
[46:09] pour upon us and we can explore the
[46:12] blessings of God there's healing in the
[46:14] blessings of God there's a refilling of
[46:16] the Holy Ghost in the blessings of God
[46:19] we can explore it but first we have to
[46:22] separate oursel but you see the only
[46:24] reason he would separate himself help
[46:27] was because it was a reality it wasn't
[46:30] just a something he was hearing in his
[46:32] head but it was so much a reality to him
[46:35] that he would obey the word of the Lord
[46:38] and separate himself and you know as I
[46:40] was thinking on these things I'm sure
[46:43] that it was more than natural things
[46:45] that he had to separate himself from
[46:47] could you imagine the Mind battles that
[46:49] he would go through that my I'm my wife
[46:52] is baren I'm I'm 9 75 years old there's
[46:55] no way that God can bless me there's no
[46:58] way that I could have a child he had to
[47:00] separate those things from negative
[47:03] thoughts concerning his life and
[47:05] sometimes we have to separate oursel
[47:07] from complexes separate oursel from
[47:10] negative thoughts that insecurities put
[47:13] in our mind so that the blessing of God
[47:16] can fall we see that Abraham was in a
[47:19] natural land we're fighting in the
[47:21] spiritual realm so we might not have to
[47:23] separate oursel from natural things but
[47:26] they spirit things that we have to
[47:28] separate oursel from so that God can
[47:31] bring the blessings on our life oh my
[47:35] but you see when brother Brandon would
[47:36] talk about Michelangelo he would say
[47:38] there would be a pattern that
[47:40] Michelangelo would go by and he says it
[47:43] didn't matter what the critics would say
[47:45] he had a pattern that he was sticking to
[47:48] and the vision would take place and I
[47:50] like how brother Brandon would say this
[47:52] he says the negative would then become
[47:54] the positive what was in the mind would
[47:56] would then start to take would take on a
[47:59] form then brother Brandon would say
[48:00] let's close that book and talk about the
[48:03] great sculpture he says then God wanted
[48:05] to create something and bring into
[48:08] existence what his attributes desired he
[48:11] said Michelangelo had to have a marble
[48:14] to create His Image but God didn't need
[48:17] something materially he could create
[48:19] something and so he would start to
[48:21] create the brother brandom says he
[48:23] creates uh he creates the low form of
[48:25] animals then he creates the Tigers and
[48:27] the Lions he creates these things but he
[48:30] created all the creeping things but
[48:32] finally he wanted a reflection of
[48:35] himself and so then he would create a
[48:38] man in His image and brother Brandon
[48:40] would say this but finally there come
[48:42] upon the Earth of perfection that was
[48:45] the man and then he could see in that
[48:47] man that it looked like him so now when
[48:50] he looked upon him he was the reflection
[48:53] of what the Creator was and God had now
[48:56] been able to achieve the thing that he
[48:59] wanted a man in his own image oh God
[49:02] wasn't satisfied with the tiger with the
[49:04] lions with with nature with all of these
[49:06] other things with the angels he wanted
[49:09] the reflection of himself the Angels
[49:12] couldn't be a reflection the Lions
[49:14] couldn't be a reflection the Tigers
[49:16] couldn't be a reflection but he wanted a
[49:18] man that he could Veil himself in and be
[49:21] a reflection of his attributes a
[49:24] reflection of his nature just like God
[49:28] would speak to Nature the reflection
[49:30] would speak to Nature just like the
[49:32] Creator would speak to the speak to the
[49:35] the the storm the the the reflection
[49:37] would speak to the storm what was it it
[49:40] was the negative becoming positive and
[49:42] it was a reflection that brother Brandon
[49:45] would say that God wanted a masterpiece
[49:47] family so what he would do is he would
[49:50] strike the sight of Adam and out of the
[49:52] sight of Adam he would start to form Eve
[49:55] and what I think is so beautiful is he
[49:57] would say he went to take another
[49:59] creation he took a part of the original
[50:01] creation he took Eve from Adam and would
[50:04] create another Masterpiece oh my and
[50:07] what did what did God say when he come
[50:09] looking for Adam and Eve he would say
[50:11] Adam Adam Where Art Thou there were one
[50:14] and the same and it was after the fall
[50:17] the Bible says that Adam would give Eve
[50:20] her name but it was after the fall but
[50:22] in the midst of this masterpiece there
[50:25] were one in the sh oh and God has got a
[50:27] masterpiece upon the Earth today he's
[50:30] got the bride of Christ that has come
[50:32] from the sight of Christ and they are
[50:34] one and the same it's a perfect
[50:36] reflection it's a perfect uh bone of
[50:39] bone life of Life flesh of Flesh it is
[50:41] the same power reflecting in humanity
[50:45] just like it did when Adam was upon
[50:47] earth oh my but brother Brandon would
[50:49] tell us when God rested his enemy would
[50:52] break through the wall and would Mar
[50:54] this masterpiece he would break it so no
[50:57] longer is Adam reflecting eternity but
[51:00] now he's reflecting another land he's
[51:03] reflecting a land of death he's
[51:05] reflecting a land of Sorrow he's
[51:07] reflecting a land of Decay and brother
[51:09] Brandon would say this as I said in the
[51:11] beginning what you are somewhere else is
[51:14] what you reflect here what you are what
[51:16] your Celestial body is up yonder what
[51:19] your Celestial body is somewhere else is
[51:22] what you are reflecting back here in the
[51:24] spirit land what you are is what you are
[51:27] here if you're still vulgar minded so
[51:29] forth in the spirit land you're vulgar
[51:32] minded here if you still got malice Envy
[51:35] Strife in the spirit land with that it
[51:38] reflects back here so the reflection
[51:40] right here is only pointing back to
[51:43] where we are living spiritually and we
[51:45] see when Adam was a was a perfect
[51:48] reflection of God Whenever there was
[51:50] walking in unity his flesh would declare
[51:53] that but after he would fall his flesh
[51:55] would declare
[51:57] something else and the same thing is
[51:59] happening today our flesh is only
[52:01] reflecting where we are living
[52:03] spiritually I don't believe we got to
[52:05] live in a spiritually and a spiritual
[52:08] Amnesia we don't got to live in a
[52:10] hypocritical life but we can live in
[52:13] such a place spiritually that the life
[52:16] of God is reflecting through our life
[52:18] every day of the week not just on
[52:20] Sundays not just on Wednesdays but every
[52:22] day we wake up if you go through a trial
[52:25] go through a hard time we are living in
[52:27] such a place spiritually that our
[52:29] natural life is reflecting where we are
[52:32] spiritually oh Hallelujah and we see
[52:35] that when the children of Israel was in
[52:37] the land of Egypt what did they reflect
[52:40] they reflected bondage and even though
[52:42] they was called to something else they
[52:44] was called to a higher purpose Caleb
[52:47] Joshua and Caleb the the the the the the
[52:49] the great Overcomers Caleb that would
[52:51] say give me my Mountain was living an
[52:53] overcoming are living a defeated life
[52:56] because of where he was dwelling at but
[52:59] once he would change his Dwelling Place
[53:01] once he would get into the promised land
[53:03] his flesh would then start to overcome
[53:07] what God had given him but first he had
[53:09] to get out of the land of bondage and
[53:11] into two US promised land and the reason
[53:14] why many of us can't overcome is because
[53:17] we're still dwelling in the land of
[53:19] bondage we're still Bound by complexes
[53:21] we're still Bound by insecurities and we
[53:24] can't our flesh can't overcome naturally
[53:27] because we're bound spiritually but once
[53:29] we get out of the land of bondage and
[53:32] into the promised land then we can see a
[53:35] reflection The Life of Christ inside of
[53:37] a teenager inside of a mom a daddy
[53:40] whatever you are tonight once you get in
[53:43] the land of Freedom then your flesh
[53:45] starts to reflect the land that you are
[53:48] living in oh Hallelujah then it reflects
[53:52] the land that you're living in Joshua
[53:53] and Caleb that was once slaves are now
[53:56] in their bodies an overcomer oh my so
[53:59] that's why God calls for a total
[54:02] separation and brother Brandon would say
[54:04] this now a total separation from all
[54:06] unbelief and remember Abraham was by
[54:09] Abraham the patriarch was never
[54:11] absolutely fully blessed until he obeyed
[54:14] exactly what God said to do and he says
[54:18] will never never never be blessed in and
[54:21] have the blessings until we obey what
[54:24] God Said so well God said to do and so
[54:28] before there can be a reflection there
[54:30] has to be a separation and here's the
[54:32] the scripture I quoted earlier in
[54:33] Genesis 13 and 14 and the Lord said unto
[54:36] Abram after that lot was separated from
[54:39] him lift up now thine eyes and look from
[54:41] the place what Thou Art northward
[54:44] Southward Eastward Westward for all the
[54:46] land which thou seest to thee I will
[54:49] give it and through thy seed forever and
[54:52] I will make thy seed as the dust of the
[54:54] earth so that if am can number the dust
[54:57] of the earth then shall they then so
[54:59] shall thy seat also be numbered arise
[55:03] and walk through the land in the length
[55:04] of it and in the breadth of it for I
[55:07] will give it to thee so after the
[55:09] separation come The Possession after the
[55:12] separation God would say hey this is all
[55:15] of yours go explore it but first there
[55:18] had to be a separation and brother
[55:20] brandom says oh that's what the trouble
[55:22] with Christians today you are air of all
[55:24] things well brother if I bought a house
[55:26] or something and you give or somebody
[55:28] gave me a house I'll go through every
[55:30] room in it I'll go down in the basement
[55:32] I'll go in the garage I want to know
[55:35] what I own and that's the way it was
[55:37] when I got saved these are God's
[55:39] promises so I just went through them and
[55:42] claimed every one of them they're mine
[55:45] oh my so if we're separated this evening
[55:47] stand up with the boldness and see every
[55:50] promise is mine my children are mine my
[55:53] family is mine a renewing is mine
[55:56] Revival for this church is mine a
[55:58] Revival for my children or mine you see
[56:01] once you are separated there's no more
[56:04] condemnation to the things of the world
[56:07] once you're separated you can come with
[56:09] the boldness uh there's a there's a
[56:11] certainty that no matter what I ask for
[56:14] there's no condemnation that is keeping
[56:16] me from the Throne of God oh Hallelujah
[56:19] so Footprints mean possession so start
[56:22] walking in what God has given us so it's
[56:25] more than just a form it's a reality
[56:28] this like our Pastor said this morning
[56:30] we can have the form of a message but we
[56:33] want the message to come into reality
[56:35] and take on flesh CU you see there's a
[56:37] difference in the reflection and the
[56:40] shadow the shadow you have a form but a
[56:43] reflection you have a person and that is
[56:45] something that just really stood out to
[56:47] me if this message is just a form all
[56:50] you have as a shadow but if the message
[56:52] becomes a reality then you have the
[56:55] person Jesus Christ not a form not a
[56:58] type not a shadow but the reality of the
[57:01] supernatural God inside of your life cuz
[57:05] you see the the blood of bulls and goats
[57:07] were types and shadows of the Redeemer
[57:10] but there was no authority to dismiss
[57:12] their sins it was just a form so they
[57:15] would come before before the Tabernacle
[57:17] and to the Tabernacle before the altar
[57:19] as a form and a ritual and would say
[57:21] Lord forgive me of my sins but then they
[57:24] will leave that place with the same
[57:26] desire there was no reflection of the
[57:29] power of God but once Christ would come
[57:32] he wasn't a shadow of the Redeemer it
[57:34] was the person the Redeemer himself and
[57:38] brother Brandon would say it was the
[57:40] perfect Masterpiece all the types of the
[57:43] Old Testament was now met in him so when
[57:46] Christ come it wasn't a form it was a
[57:49] reality it wasn't a form of saying Lord
[57:52] forgive me of my sins but now there was
[57:55] a reality to break the curse of a sin
[57:58] nature that we could reflect not the
[58:01] form of bulls and goats but the reality
[58:04] of the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[58:08] that's where we're standing today not in
[58:10] a form not in a ritual not with the
[58:12] Creed but with the person the realities
[58:15] of Jesus Christ I say let's explore what
[58:19] this message has done for us let's
[58:21] explore this revival let's explore the
[58:24] Deliverance that God has given us in
[58:26] this generation oh it's a reflection of
[58:29] the Supernatural is being reflected in
[58:32] our life today
[58:34] amen oh Hallelujah and when Satan broke
[58:38] this masterpiece in the garden brother
[58:40] Brandon would say God wasn't willing to
[58:42] leave a face down and ruined but he
[58:44] would work he would he would work back
[58:46] to back he would go back to work and
[58:49] build another Masterpiece another
[58:52] reflection and brother Brandon would say
[58:54] he would start with Abraham he would
[58:56] start with the with the Patriarchs and
[58:58] because you remember where the brandom
[58:59] says the Michelangelo would build by a
[59:02] pattern and this is how God would start
[59:05] to work on his Masterpiece was by a
[59:07] pattern and brother Brandon would say
[59:09] that this masterpiece he would start
[59:11] with the foundation Abraham Faith Isaac
[59:15] love Jo Jacob Grace Joseph Perfection
[59:18] and then brother brandom says then he
[59:20] moves to the body and he says and the
[59:22] prophets were the word brother brandom
[59:25] says so there was the foundation and
[59:27] then the word would start to make up the
[59:30] body and then he says the head would
[59:32] come Christ would come and then it would
[59:35] be another Masterpiece but you see it
[59:38] was no longer when Christ come it was no
[59:41] longer types but then it was the reality
[59:44] but the Brandon would say this and and
[59:46] then come finally the great head the
[59:48] head of it all the rest of the body just
[59:51] spoke of it the foundation laid by the
[59:53] patriarch but the the the body was built
[59:56] by the word which was the prophets and
[59:58] here comes the head of it all Jesus came
[1:00:01] on the scene then when this headpiece
[1:00:03] was put on it we find him the entire
[1:00:07] handiwork of God we find in him the
[1:00:10] perfect reflection of the word of God
[1:00:13] for the word and the for he was the word
[1:00:16] the fullness of the word now began God
[1:00:19] has the perfect Masterpiece again so
[1:00:22] Abraham had a portion Isaac had a
[1:00:25] portion Jacob had a portion Joseph had a
[1:00:27] portion the prophets all had portions
[1:00:30] but when Christ come it was the fullness
[1:00:33] of what everybody had in one body
[1:00:36] Abraham had faith and there stood the
[1:00:39] faith of God Isaac had love there stood
[1:00:41] the love of God Jacob had Grace there
[1:00:44] stood the grace of God Joseph had
[1:00:46] Perfection there stood Perfection so all
[1:00:49] of these types was pointing to something
[1:00:52] of a reality then Christ would come
[1:00:55] there was no longer a type but now there
[1:00:57] was a reality oh Hallelujah and I like
[1:01:00] how brother Brandon puts it he says
[1:01:02] Michelangelo would strike the knee of
[1:01:05] that sculpture and say speak to me speak
[1:01:08] and brother Brandon would say there was
[1:01:09] no life in it to speak back but when God
[1:01:12] created his Masterpiece he would step
[1:01:15] into the Masterpiece and give it life
[1:01:18] that it could speak back to him oh
[1:01:20] Hallelujah so when Christ come there
[1:01:23] stood a reality brother would say he was
[1:01:27] The Rock in the wilderness and the Bible
[1:01:29] would say if you drink of this water
[1:01:31] reality you'll never thirst again the
[1:01:35] Bible would say that Jesus would look at
[1:01:37] the preachers and say your father ate of
[1:01:39] the man in the wilderness and their
[1:01:42] everyone dead they were living under a
[1:01:44] type but then Jesus would say if you eat
[1:01:47] of the bread of life then you will never
[1:01:49] hunger again he was bringing a reality
[1:01:53] that was destroying the type that we
[1:01:55] should have a reflection oh Hallelujah I
[1:01:59] hope this is making sense this evening
[1:02:00] brother Brandon would say this here all
[1:02:02] the prophets had flaws all the ones was
[1:02:05] the portion but here at last coming up
[1:02:08] through that finally comes the
[1:02:11] Masterpiece the perfect one no Faults in
[1:02:14] him at all so perfectly reflected of the
[1:02:17] Builder himself his own image was
[1:02:20] reflected in his own work God and Christ
[1:02:23] was one H so much and put his own Spirit
[1:02:27] into him that even the image and the
[1:02:30] Builder had become one oh Hallelujah so
[1:02:34] here stood Christ here stood Christ and
[1:02:36] like I said last time brother Brandon
[1:02:38] would say when God unveiled himself
[1:02:40] Christ was sitting there on the cross
[1:02:43] has The Mercy Seat but nobody could see
[1:02:45] him they was blinded by their form they
[1:02:48] was blinded by the type and brother
[1:02:50] Brandon would say they would be singing
[1:02:52] Psalms 22 they pierced my hands they
[1:02:55] pierced my feet they did these things
[1:02:57] and brother brandom says the one they
[1:02:58] were singing about was sitting there on
[1:03:01] the cross but because of the form they
[1:03:04] could not see reality oh and I'm going
[1:03:06] to change that a little bit now we could
[1:03:08] have a form of godliness and deny the
[1:03:11] realities of the gospel because of a
[1:03:14] form we could come the church out of
[1:03:16] Duty we could come the church out of a
[1:03:18] ritual and we start to become the church
[1:03:21] as a form instead of a reality and we'll
[1:03:24] never see the power of the Gospel but if
[1:03:27] we change it from a type or from a form
[1:03:30] into a reality then we can see the
[1:03:34] demonstration of the Gospel in every one
[1:03:36] of our Lives oh Hallelujah he stands
[1:03:40] today as the same yesterday today and
[1:03:43] forever not a type not a form but the
[1:03:46] person and you see remember brother
[1:03:47] brandom talks about the chines laundries
[1:03:50] they would take a little card and would
[1:03:52] tear it up you would keep one piece and
[1:03:54] they would keep one piece PE and he says
[1:03:56] then if you would come back and I like
[1:03:58] that brother Brandon how he tells the
[1:04:00] story he says in order to redeem your
[1:04:02] dirty laundry you got to take that piece
[1:04:05] with you and then you would match the
[1:04:07] two pieces together in order to redeem
[1:04:10] your da your dirty laundry and brother
[1:04:12] Brandon would say you couldn't
[1:04:13] impersonate it there was only one way to
[1:04:16] do it that was for the two to Dov tail
[1:04:19] and brother brandom says this therefore
[1:04:21] the China man you could claim where the
[1:04:24] law condemns you and says that you were
[1:04:26] dirty you were guilty and you could put
[1:04:29] you in the prison but when he came he
[1:04:32] was the match piece for it that you
[1:04:34] could that could take you out and bring
[1:04:36] you back to the complete ticket the
[1:04:39] Redemption that God had promised in the
[1:04:42] Garden of Eden and so when Christ come
[1:04:45] he was the missing piece that could
[1:04:47] bring the total Redemption to her life
[1:04:50] and just like the China man would have
[1:04:52] your dirty laundry and in order to
[1:04:54] redeem it the two pieces had to match
[1:04:57] together and when Christ come it was the
[1:05:00] word and his life would Dove tell
[1:05:03] together that would bring forth full
[1:05:05] Redemption that the dirty laundry could
[1:05:08] be redeemed but you notice if you would
[1:05:10] drop your laundry off it was dirty but
[1:05:13] once it was redeemed it was no longer
[1:05:15] dirty it was clean and once we went into
[1:05:18] sins we was dirty but once Christ come
[1:05:21] and redeemed us back we're no longer
[1:05:23] dirty but we're clean by the blood of
[1:05:26] Christ We Stand blameless we stand all
[1:05:29] of our sins in the SE of God's
[1:05:31] forgetfulness but brother Brandon would
[1:05:33] say that Redemption was promised in the
[1:05:36] Garden of Eden and here stood the match
[1:05:39] piece and that match pie this match
[1:05:41] peace would take a condemned Son of God
[1:05:44] and redeem him back and brother Brandon
[1:05:46] would say this and when and when God
[1:05:48] when he looked upon him he was so
[1:05:51] inspired to see him the way he looked
[1:05:53] and to see the form of him he was so
[1:05:56] inspired that it would be a perfect
[1:05:58] Master Masterpiece of a redeemer Jesus
[1:06:01] the Redeemer so God in order to be
[1:06:04] submitting himself to pay the price to
[1:06:07] pay his own penalty God and Christ
[1:06:09] become one so that he could be Smit so
[1:06:12] he could be smoted in that image he
[1:06:14] could be scarred and that's why Isaiah
[1:06:17] said we did esteem him smitten and
[1:06:20] Afflicted of God yet he was wounded for
[1:06:23] transgressions he was bruised for
[1:06:25] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:06:28] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:06:31] healed so in order for Redemption to
[1:06:34] happen the Masterpiece had to be
[1:06:36] smitten and brother Brandon would say
[1:06:39] just like just like um um Michelangelo
[1:06:42] would Smite the Smite His Image and it
[1:06:44] would break off he said Christ Our God
[1:06:46] would Smite would Smite Christ in order
[1:06:49] for Redemption to take place and there
[1:06:52] which stood a reflection of redemption
[1:06:55] then the promise of scripture would be
[1:06:57] fulfilled he would smitten and Afflicted
[1:07:00] of God he was wounded for our
[1:07:02] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:07:04] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:07:07] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:07:10] healed no longer a type but a reality oh
[1:07:14] Hallelujah and that's why a lot of
[1:07:16] people have a hard time reflecting the
[1:07:18] message is because it not it's not a
[1:07:21] reality it's just a form but you see the
[1:07:24] the when Christ come he was built up by
[1:07:27] the word and that broke the type and
[1:07:29] brought forth reality and you see
[1:07:32] brother Brandon as I said earlier there
[1:07:34] was reading Psalms 22 that pierced my
[1:07:36] hands pierced my feet and this was
[1:07:39] happening happening right there in their
[1:07:41] very mited but they were blinded by it
[1:07:43] because of their form and the Bible
[1:07:46] would say in 2 Timothy 3 and 5 excuse me
[1:07:49] three and five having a form of
[1:07:51] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:07:55] from turn away and so having a form
[1:07:58] denies the realities of it brother
[1:08:00] Brandon would say take example now of
[1:08:03] Mana from Heaven God sent down Angel
[1:08:05] bread from Heaven to Israel but the
[1:08:08] bread did not satisfy it was only good
[1:08:11] for a day those who ate were hungry
[1:08:14] again the next day it was left around
[1:08:16] and it become contaminated but Jesus is
[1:08:19] the true bread from Heaven whereof Mana
[1:08:22] was a type and if any man eats of the
[1:08:25] bread that come from Heaven he will
[1:08:27] never hunger again he does not need to
[1:08:29] come back and eat again the moment he
[1:08:32] partook he had eternal life here indeed
[1:08:35] was reality no longer in need for a
[1:08:38] shadow no need for a partial salvation
[1:08:41] here was the whole of it just like Jesus
[1:08:44] isn't a part of God he is God so brother
[1:08:47] Brandon was saying whenever reality come
[1:08:51] it broke the form and you see when God
[1:08:53] unveiled himself there's no longer
[1:08:55] longer uh we don't need to live in a
[1:08:57] shadow we don't need to live in a form
[1:08:59] of victory that only last so long we
[1:09:02] don't need to live in a form of
[1:09:03] happiness that only last so long or a
[1:09:05] form of peace that only last so long but
[1:09:08] now there is a reality that we can grab
[1:09:11] a hold of Peter had a form but there was
[1:09:14] no lasting effect to it but once he
[1:09:16] overcome his own desires overcome his
[1:09:19] own makeup and got reality it changed
[1:09:22] his reflection but once it moved from a
[1:09:25] form to reality it was a different Peter
[1:09:28] and brother Brandon would say this
[1:09:30] denying the word in forms of godliness
[1:09:32] denying the power of His word how can he
[1:09:35] place a blessing upon that he can't do
[1:09:38] it he sure won't we got to come back to
[1:09:41] the real thing so we got to move from a
[1:09:43] form to the reality for the blessings to
[1:09:47] come upon us oh Hallelujah I hope this
[1:09:50] is making sense tonight I was I didn't
[1:09:52] have it all put together just perfect so
[1:09:54] I hope it's making some kind of sense
[1:09:56] tonight you got to come from a for to
[1:09:59] reality for the blessings of God to fall
[1:10:02] upon us and I like how the the Bible
[1:10:05] would tell us in Matthew 9:17 neither do
[1:10:08] men put new wine into Old bottles else
[1:10:11] the bottles break and the wine runthe
[1:10:14] and the bottles perish but they put new
[1:10:16] wine into new bottles and are both
[1:10:19] preserved and brother Brandon would say
[1:10:21] this used to stump him until he'd done
[1:10:23] missionary work and he said because we
[1:10:25] think of bottles as glasses you know but
[1:10:27] he says over there the bottles that
[1:10:30] Jesus is talking about ain't glass but
[1:10:33] it's skins he says it's skins that are
[1:10:35] tanned and they're sewed together and
[1:10:37] they would put oil in them they would
[1:10:39] put water in them they would put uh they
[1:10:41] would put a wine in them but you see
[1:10:43] they would carry these things but once
[1:10:45] the skin would get old it would dry up
[1:10:48] and once it would dry up it could still
[1:10:51] carry water it could still carry oil but
[1:10:54] it couldn't carry wine and brother
[1:10:55] Brandon would say it was because the
[1:10:58] wine had life in it and as it would
[1:11:00] start I forget the word he used fated
[1:11:02] maybe he says as it would start to do
[1:11:04] that it would start to expand and he
[1:11:06] says that those old skins would be too
[1:11:09] dry and whenever that life would start
[1:11:11] to take place it would break up and the
[1:11:14] wine would pour out and the bottle would
[1:11:17] be destroyed and I think oh my that's
[1:11:19] why many people can't have keep the
[1:11:21] victory they can't keep a Victorious
[1:11:23] Life is because they're old and DED up
[1:11:26] and when the life of God comes on the
[1:11:27] inside their life expands and they
[1:11:30] explode up but you see water down
[1:11:33] religion is just fine the oil is just
[1:11:35] fine they put water in there but the
[1:11:37] brandom says they could keep water
[1:11:39] because there was no life he was dead
[1:11:42] but the wine that had life would break
[1:11:44] it up but all you need is a new bottle
[1:11:47] and brother Brandon would say the new
[1:11:48] skins still had oil from the animal on
[1:11:52] it and when the wine starts to furminate
[1:11:54] the oil pushes out and the skin start to
[1:11:57] expand it wouldn't break but it would
[1:12:00] start to expand and brother brandom says
[1:12:02] that's the way it is when you're olded
[1:12:04] by the Holy Ghost when the word comes in
[1:12:07] you start to expand you push out the
[1:12:10] things of doctrines that ain't of the
[1:12:12] word you push out theology you start to
[1:12:15] expand because we're oiled by the Holy
[1:12:18] Ghost and brother brandom says put the
[1:12:20] new wine in an old bottle you say now
[1:12:22] our school teach is different or
[1:12:24] denomination that old cow that old dry
[1:12:27] cow hide our teachers our Pastor said
[1:12:29] these things are finished but if it's a
[1:12:31] new hide it's got new life in it excuse
[1:12:35] me it's flexible and it gives to the
[1:12:38] word and the word supports the spirit or
[1:12:40] the spirit supports the word and when
[1:12:42] they come into the new bottle and they
[1:12:45] say someone got healed of cancer last
[1:12:47] evening the old height says let me see
[1:12:50] what the doctor says let me see a year
[1:12:52] from now I just can't believe it but the
[1:12:54] new heights say Hallelujah to the lamb
[1:12:56] it spreads out then both wine and bottle
[1:13:00] is kept then brother Brandon would say
[1:13:02] that's what we need today is the church
[1:13:05] the church needs an oiling a holy spirit
[1:13:08] oiling oh man the Bible would tell us
[1:13:10] hurt not the oil and the wine and you
[1:13:13] see brother the brand would say the oil
[1:13:14] is the Holy Ghost and the wine is the
[1:13:16] stimulation of Revelation and so once
[1:13:19] the oil is inside it expands and it's
[1:13:22] ready for the word to come inside of it
[1:13:25] you see then we can keep the victory
[1:13:27] then we can keep an overcoming life but
[1:13:30] you see we got to give the room word or
[1:13:32] room to work the word room to work we
[1:13:35] got to give the message room to work and
[1:13:37] you see Abraham was just to be a
[1:13:39] reflection of what deity could do cuz
[1:13:42] after Adam had fallen the Covenant
[1:13:45] between God and man was broken and you
[1:13:48] see and God would come and take Abraham
[1:13:51] a fallen human being and would reflect
[1:13:54] deity in it and I just love how how this
[1:13:57] was jumping out to me it was it was
[1:13:59] because of a fallen condition that
[1:14:02] Abraham couldn't have children because
[1:14:04] we know that the children wasn't
[1:14:05] supposed to come by sex but was going to
[1:14:07] come by the spoken word but because of a
[1:14:10] fallen condition he wasn't able to have
[1:14:13] children but then God deity would come
[1:14:17] to a fallen humanity and would reflect
[1:14:20] the promise inside of his womb oh he
[1:14:23] would take the curse and turn it into a
[1:14:26] blessing it was because of the curse he
[1:14:28] couldn't have children but then the
[1:14:30] Bible would tell us how be it our God
[1:14:33] has turned the curse into a blessing and
[1:14:36] so deity would come to Fallen humanity
[1:14:39] and would give a portion of himself to
[1:14:42] Abraham in order for there to be a
[1:14:44] reflection of the blessing and but and
[1:14:47] our pastor talked about it last Sunday
[1:14:49] he was taken the last the last letters
[1:14:52] of Elohim and were plac it upon Abram
[1:14:55] Abraham and so now deity was coming
[1:14:58] inside of humanity to produce the
[1:15:01] promised word for that generation to
[1:15:04] produce the promised child and brother
[1:15:06] Brandon would say then he changed his
[1:15:08] name from Abram to Abraham and ham was
[1:15:11] the part of God's name did you notice
[1:15:14] that did it ever soak in Abraham Elohim
[1:15:17] he was the part of God's name because
[1:15:20] God is the father of all and he made his
[1:15:23] name being Elohim he put a part of his
[1:15:26] name with Abraham and made him a partner
[1:15:29] with him through his seed he would bring
[1:15:32] forth the seed and bless every nation in
[1:15:35] the earth he would be the father of many
[1:15:37] nations Abraham would reproduce the
[1:15:41] faith of Elohim he would reproduce the
[1:15:44] faith of Elohim and brother Brandon
[1:15:46] would tell us the the foundation that
[1:15:49] Christ was built upon was Abraham Jacob
[1:15:52] all these other things and it was faith
[1:15:54] that Abraham would have how did he get
[1:15:57] this Faith because Elohim deity would
[1:16:00] come and pour out blessings upon Abraham
[1:16:04] oh Hallelujah so this was the blessing
[1:16:07] that was being poured out upon Abraham
[1:16:10] was deity coming inside of humanity it
[1:16:13] was after his name was changed that his
[1:16:16] body was changed it was after his name
[1:16:19] was changed that the promised child
[1:16:21] would come to pass it was after his name
[1:16:24] was changed changed that he would see
[1:16:26] Jehovah Gyra my provider but it was
[1:16:29] after deity would come and Fallen
[1:16:32] Humanity that he would see the results
[1:16:35] in his life oh when little church deity
[1:16:38] has come once again and Fallen Humanity
[1:16:41] to bring forth the word and reflect the
[1:16:44] promised word for this generation oh
[1:16:47] Hallelujah you see Abraham would get a
[1:16:50] portion of his name but the bride in
[1:16:52] this generation has got all of God's
[1:16:55] name we are Christ we are we are M Jesus
[1:16:58] Christ you see Abraham got the last part
[1:17:01] the last four letters of Elohim but this
[1:17:04] bride has got all of Jesus Christ Living
[1:17:07] inside of her if nothing could keep
[1:17:10] Abraham from fulfilling the word what
[1:17:13] about this bride Abraham went through
[1:17:15] discouragement Abraham went through
[1:17:17] depression Abraham went through scoffers
[1:17:19] and Skeptics but he stood he still stood
[1:17:22] with the promised child at the end of
[1:17:25] the day with only a portion of Elohim
[1:17:28] what about the Bride of today you might
[1:17:30] go through hard times you might go
[1:17:32] through depression you might go through
[1:17:34] insecurities but all of God has been
[1:17:36] poured out into into human in humanity
[1:17:40] today to bring forth the promised word
[1:17:44] to bring forth the reflection of Jesus
[1:17:47] Christ oh Hallelujah it was the blessing
[1:17:50] of God that we be poured out upon
[1:17:53] Abraham that that he could see the
[1:17:55] reflection and God has stepped into this
[1:17:58] bride the blessing of God has come
[1:18:00] inside of this bride first Peter 3 and9
[1:18:03] not wender rendering evil for evil or
[1:18:06] raing for for raing but but contz
[1:18:09] blessing knowing that year there unto
[1:18:11] called that you should inherit a
[1:18:14] blessing and since we're called we are
[1:18:17] called to inherit the blessing of God
[1:18:19] and what is this blessing that you're
[1:18:21] talking about brother Josh the Bible
[1:18:23] would tell us that as the new wine is
[1:18:25] found in the cluster and one saith
[1:18:28] destroy a notd for a blessing is in it
[1:18:31] so a blessing is in the new wine what
[1:18:34] did the 120 get in the upper room was a
[1:18:37] new wine it was the spirit of God coming
[1:18:39] to humanity and then they would reflect
[1:18:42] you see brother Brandon would say this
[1:18:44] and the body of Christ is one Spirit
[1:18:47] where every member from Pentecost to
[1:18:50] this time drinks of the same new wine
[1:18:53] the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the
[1:18:55] same results how do we do it by one
[1:18:59] spirit it's God's Open Door the Holy
[1:19:02] Spirit what is it it's God's open door
[1:19:04] it's a sign it's a seal it's a comforter
[1:19:07] it's an advocate an assurance a rest a
[1:19:10] peace it's goodness it's healing it's
[1:19:12] life it's God's open door to all of
[1:19:15] these things and what is opening the
[1:19:18] door to all of these things the blessing
[1:19:20] of God the new wine of God Elohim coming
[1:19:24] in Humanity opens the door to a real
[1:19:27] peace not a type not a form but a piece
[1:19:31] of reality that passes all understanding
[1:19:35] if we wake up in a bad mood we got
[1:19:37] reality if we wake up on the wrong side
[1:19:39] of the bed we got reality if we're
[1:19:42] shaking our body we got reality because
[1:19:45] the blessing of God has been poured out
[1:19:48] upon us amen hallelujah it's God's open
[1:19:52] door it's God's open door it's a CH it's
[1:19:55] a comforter it's an assurance it's a
[1:19:57] rest all of these things are because the
[1:20:00] blessing of God is bringing forth the
[1:20:03] results oh my just like when Abraham got
[1:20:06] the blessing it brought the results
[1:20:07] through his flesh and brother Brandon
[1:20:09] would saying I thank when you see the
[1:20:11] power of God sweep through meeting it
[1:20:13] means that Jesus Christ is living
[1:20:16] somewhere hallelujah it's the same holy
[1:20:18] ghost power that raised them up on the
[1:20:20] day of Pentecost and give them the
[1:20:22] blessing of God that power power is
[1:20:25] still existing somewhere amen he says
[1:20:28] thy power is still existing somewhere
[1:20:31] and I say it's right here this is where
[1:20:34] the blessing is still existing still
[1:20:37] existing he never runs out of it he
[1:20:39] never runs out of the Holy Ghost like I
[1:20:41] like I said last time whenever Elisha
[1:20:43] would come to the widow woman's house
[1:20:46] and would say hey go get some empty
[1:20:47] vessels it didn't matter how many empty
[1:20:50] vessels they would bring in as long as
[1:20:53] empty vessels was be being called he
[1:20:55] still had enough oil and the Bible says
[1:20:57] he had a little cup of oil but that cup
[1:21:00] of oil would fill all of the empty
[1:21:03] vessels and all that was in God he
[1:21:05] poured in the Christ and all that was in
[1:21:07] Christ he's poured into empty vessels he
[1:21:11] didn't run out on the day of Pentecost
[1:21:13] he didn't run out at Aus the street but
[1:21:15] if there're still empty vessels that he
[1:21:18] is calling if there's new bottles that
[1:21:20] is standing here today God is still
[1:21:22] pouring out deity to be a reflection in
[1:21:26] the midst of
[1:21:28] humanity oh Hallelujah he's still coming
[1:21:31] in humanity he's turned the curse into a
[1:21:34] blessing how could how could Abraham be
[1:21:38] such a patriarch of faith without the
[1:21:40] curse yeah you know how could Abraham
[1:21:43] reflect the power of deity if if Sarah
[1:21:46] wasn't Barren you know how could these
[1:21:48] things take place and how could we
[1:21:50] reflect deity and Humanity if it wasn't
[1:21:54] for the curse of humanity but it was the
[1:21:57] curse of humanity that put us under the
[1:22:00] rule of sin put us under the rule of
[1:22:03] addictions put us under the rule of
[1:22:05] Satan that Elohim would pour himself out
[1:22:09] into that humanity and turn the curse
[1:22:12] into a
[1:22:14] blessing oh Hallelujah brother Brandon
[1:22:17] would say this he know what he was
[1:22:19] talking about so that's the reason he
[1:22:21] wasn't afraid of Goliath it wasn't the
[1:22:23] rock that David had in the sling that
[1:22:25] killed Goliath it wasn't the sling that
[1:22:28] he had in his hand that killed Goliath
[1:22:30] it wasn't the stones that he had in his
[1:22:32] pocket that did it it was the hidden
[1:22:34] power the blessing of God so that's what
[1:22:38] I'm talking about what is this blessing
[1:22:40] you shall be a blessing I will bless
[1:22:42] your family I will bless you I'll make
[1:22:44] you a great nation I Will Bless You The
[1:22:46] Blessing was Elohim coming into Abraham
[1:22:50] and him reflecting it and here David was
[1:22:53] a reflection of the blessing the hidden
[1:22:56] power that God put on the inside that's
[1:22:59] why he could stand against Goliath stand
[1:23:01] against the bear stand against the lion
[1:23:03] he had something on the inside that was
[1:23:06] just reflecting on the inside oh that's
[1:23:09] what God needs today is somebody so full
[1:23:12] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that in
[1:23:15] every situation you reflect deity in
[1:23:18] every circumstance you reflect deity oh
[1:23:22] Hallelujah it was the hidden power
[1:23:24] the blessing of God when David let loose
[1:23:27] what he had God took it and blessed it
[1:23:30] with the hidden power so it wasn't David
[1:23:34] it wasn't the stone it wasn't the
[1:23:36] slingshot it was the blessing that was
[1:23:38] on David that slew the enemy and you
[1:23:41] know that just struck me when I read
[1:23:42] that earlier when David let loose of
[1:23:45] what he had God took it and blessed it
[1:23:48] with the hidden power when David let
[1:23:50] loose of it then God could work
[1:23:53] sometimes that's the hardest thing to do
[1:23:55] is to let loose you want to see your
[1:23:57] children saved let loose you want to see
[1:24:00] your marriage fixed let loose you want
[1:24:02] to see a Revival in your family let
[1:24:04] loose then the same hidden power that
[1:24:07] was inside of David would then come out
[1:24:10] to a
[1:24:11] circumstance oh Hallelujah see God
[1:24:14] didn't just want to live in humanity and
[1:24:17] not move in any circumstances but the
[1:24:19] same hidden power that was inside of
[1:24:22] David would start to move in the
[1:24:24] circumstance that he was given to God
[1:24:27] and if you give your depression to God
[1:24:29] you give your trials to God you let
[1:24:31] loose of those complexes watch the
[1:24:34] hidden power start to move out of you
[1:24:37] and work inside of that circumstance oh
[1:24:40] it was the blessing that was on David
[1:24:43] that slew the enemy oh my God has given
[1:24:46] us the blessing to slay your enemies but
[1:24:48] you got to let go brother brandom says
[1:24:50] God can't fight your battle if you're
[1:24:52] fighting get yourself see just just let
[1:24:55] loose and let him do it just committ it
[1:24:58] to him the greatest weapon that I know
[1:25:01] of of a Christian today is committed to
[1:25:04] God when you can't do nothing about it
[1:25:07] just commit it to him and God will take
[1:25:09] care of it he says that's the greatest
[1:25:12] weapon to a Christian today is committal
[1:25:14] to God when you can't do it when you
[1:25:17] can't get under brother brandom I think
[1:25:19] well the greatest experiences he had of
[1:25:21] had of God I believe he said I think
[1:25:23] that's the wording was when he couldn't
[1:25:24] get under it he couldn't get over it he
[1:25:27] couldn't get around it but God would
[1:25:29] take him through it that was the
[1:25:31] greatest experience when he couldn't do
[1:25:33] it when hum when H when hum human
[1:25:36] ability couldn't get through it when
[1:25:38] human nature couldn't get through it
[1:25:41] when human ability couldn't make it
[1:25:43] through complexes and depression but
[1:25:45] there was something on the inside that
[1:25:47] would say God I'm giving it to you the
[1:25:50] battle's not mine but it's yours sayith
[1:25:52] Little David I can't do these things but
[1:25:55] the hidden power on the inside I'm
[1:25:57] committing it to you oh Proverbs 11:1 by
[1:26:02] the blessing of the upright the city is
[1:26:04] exalted the blessing is exalting oh my
[1:26:08] that's what has exalted us he's the
[1:26:10] blessing it's not us exalting oursel
[1:26:13] it's the blessing of God that has
[1:26:15] exalted us where we're marching over
[1:26:17] Giants leaping over walls running
[1:26:19] through a troop going through every
[1:26:21] Goliath every fiery furnace the blessing
[1:26:23] of God has exalted us where we are a
[1:26:26] mighty conqueror oh Hallelujah in other
[1:26:30] words that exalted city is just
[1:26:33] reflecting the blessing that exalted it
[1:26:36] and my that's what God wants is somebody
[1:26:38] so humble that can say when I couldn't
[1:26:40] do it he done it give God the glory not
[1:26:43] you give God the glory if you prayed for
[1:26:46] somebody and God healed it that Glory
[1:26:47] goes to God if you overcome depression
[1:26:50] the glory goes to God God is exalting a
[1:26:53] people so that they could look back and
[1:26:55] say it was because of the blessing the
[1:26:57] blessing of God this new wine has come
[1:27:00] and shine of this humanity and is
[1:27:03] reflecting the power of the wine brother
[1:27:06] Brandon would say Jeremiah took the word
[1:27:08] of the Lord the wine of his word and the
[1:27:10] wine is the power of His word wine has a
[1:27:13] power wine is intoxication wine has got
[1:27:16] power behind it and I took the Lord's
[1:27:18] word said Jeremiah and made manifest the
[1:27:21] wine the power that's in it I exercised
[1:27:23] it before them oh I just love that I
[1:27:26] exercised it I took the wine of his word
[1:27:29] the power of it and I exercised it
[1:27:32] before them and and the scripture would
[1:27:34] show the people didn't listen to me they
[1:27:36] didn't listen to the word being
[1:27:37] exercised and I think my is the same
[1:27:39] thing today here we are the blessing of
[1:27:41] God has coming to a people and we're
[1:27:44] we're we're exercising the power of the
[1:27:46] word and the and the people still won't
[1:27:48] listen to it but there's somebody that
[1:27:50] is listening to it Amen brother Brandon
[1:27:52] would say he was so filled with the
[1:27:54] Welsh Revival till he was the Welsh
[1:27:56] Revival we ought to be so filled with
[1:27:58] Christ till we reflect him in the power
[1:28:01] of His word that's alloted to us today
[1:28:05] oh my we got to be so filled till we
[1:28:07] reflect the allotted word for
[1:28:10] today oh my brother brandom talks about
[1:28:13] the woman who licked radium and I'm sure
[1:28:15] we we all remember the story and it was
[1:28:18] it was and that that lady lick radium
[1:28:20] that was for watches and clocks and it
[1:28:22] would kill her and brother Brandon would
[1:28:24] tell that it was years later that they
[1:28:26] would take the scar bone of that woman
[1:28:28] and put it next to a watch and the watch
[1:28:30] would work it was the life of that
[1:28:32] radium that was still in that body all
[1:28:35] it needed was something compatible the
[1:28:38] radium wouldn't work with the tree it
[1:28:40] wouldn't work with the microphone or it
[1:28:42] wouldn't work for for a car but it
[1:28:44] needed something that was compatible and
[1:28:47] once it come and contact with something
[1:28:49] compatible the life of that radium would
[1:28:52] reflect itself oh mind this word has
[1:28:55] come to somebody that was compatible it
[1:28:58] was he it didn't work on the
[1:29:00] denominations it wouldn't work with the
[1:29:02] prostitutes it would have work with the
[1:29:03] horse system but it come to humanity
[1:29:06] that was in a fallen condition that was
[1:29:09] compatible he's come to a fallen human
[1:29:12] being this bride was compatible the
[1:29:13] Brandon would say it was word calling to
[1:29:16] word word responding to word he talks
[1:29:19] about the eagle he says when Mama Eagle
[1:29:21] would fly across the chicken pin and she
[1:29:24] would scream out he said it was Eagle
[1:29:26] responding to Eagle it was that eagle
[1:29:28] looking up and saying that's where I
[1:29:31] come from that's my identification and
[1:29:33] he says when the word come across your
[1:29:35] life it was word responding to word it
[1:29:39] was somebody that was compatible it was
[1:29:42] somebody that had a had a g seat on the
[1:29:46] inside that would say that's where I
[1:29:48] come from Hallelujah that's my
[1:29:50] reflection that's my identification
[1:29:53] that's who I am yeah but the word is
[1:29:55] only compatible with the word the
[1:29:58] predestinated seed come from the word so
[1:30:00] when this word come by the seed cried
[1:30:02] out the seed cried just like a little
[1:30:05] that the little Eagle he had to take a
[1:30:07] baby step he had to jump up on the upon
[1:30:10] Maybe Upon a rock on a post then he
[1:30:12] would get up on the side of the barn
[1:30:13] then we get on top on top of the barn it
[1:30:15] was a drawing and attraction saying come
[1:30:18] up higher come up higher you're called
[1:30:20] to be a reflection oh my this word come
[1:30:23] across their path and said come up
[1:30:25] higher come up high you're made to be my
[1:30:29] masterpiece you're on Earth to be my
[1:30:31] master peace yeah brother brandom says
[1:30:33] this now the smiting of Christ was for a
[1:30:36] cause that he might take from him one to
[1:30:39] be a family the bride that he might take
[1:30:42] him a bride so his Masterpiece was
[1:30:45] perfected that he had then he had to
[1:30:47] Smite it and take from him not another
[1:30:49] piece not another creation but the same
[1:30:53] creation my brother don't think bad at
[1:30:55] this but think a minute he if if it if
[1:30:59] it took from him the original creation
[1:31:02] to make the bride for him he never made

[1:31:29] bride is to be another
