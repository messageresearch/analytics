work pass the time of your souljourning here in fear for as much as ye know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from the vain conversation received by traditions of your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God can you punctuate that with a great big amen hey man let's go to the Lord

Lord that you would help me to get out of the way so that it will be you that is heard and we ask these things in the lovely name of your son Jesus Christ and can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated for a little subject tonight Redeemed by Blood amen Redeemed by Blood where we are I think we can all agree that we are not in the condition we're not in our ought to be condition amen uh we're we have fallen from our original state and we are in the process of coming back we are in the process we are coming back into our positions if there's ever a time if there's ever been an age if there's ever been a call for us to come back to our positions God is calling the believer to stand in the position that we were ordained in but yet in our fallen Humanity amen we have no man has ever been able to come back and and to be able to to take that position ever since the fall of the original creation because part of that man had died and there was amen there has been a continuation of falling and the longer that we live here amen the longer that we are on this Earth and Earth with each new generation we seem to be falling a man humanity is falling to newer lows deprivation has set in man is lost and though we were created to Reign and we were ordained to reign as sons and daughters and we were given a soul amen God's Sons were given that was a portion of God that ability to choose that authority to rule amen and and but yet we have fallen from that and with this sin nature amen it is it has gone down further and further and further it seems like amen we've got more religion in the world than we've ever had but yet man keeps seeking further we've got more uh uh uh education in the world than we've ever had amen they they at the kingdoms of this world has long uh uh to to build a Utopia here look wanted to uh you know create a perfect race there was the Muslim faith that is trying to convert the whole world Amen we've got the Jehovah's Witness that says we have got to keep educating people until one day we will push sin off of the Earth but you see education a man cannot help you religion cannot help you there is nothing that that man can do to help a man in anything that he does Amen they they have told us that education if we could just educate the poor and we can educate the illiterate if we can uh educate the urban uh cities if we can do these things the smarter he gets then amen then we can get them out of his Fallen condition but you see there's no remedy that can catch us because we keep falling and falling and falling amen can you say Amen we've got our Senators today amen that has proven that they have been raised in wealthy families they have been raised went to the best of the colleges they have done all of these things but yet in our in our in our Congress and our Senate and in our white house and our high places and our highly educated places we are finding that there's more depravity within those uh you know those sacred uh Halls of Education than there has ever been it's because we are in a fallen condition man has been falling it seems like the further the the more he's educated the further that he gets away from his remedy amen education is not our Salvation amen education is not what where God is ornamed it it seems like you know neurotic mankind even with all of this education you know the doctors are saying yes we know what's wrong with you amen bad here take a pill and this will make you feel better amen now the doctors are needing doctoring and amen now the psychiatrists are needing psychiatrists it just seems like there is nothing that can that can help us in this condition something is missing amen something is missing the sons of God have fallen from their condition their position can you say Amen now the Earth is missing their Master it's not a certain man the Pope's not a man doesn't have it amen it's not a certain it's God's Sons they are the ones that that have fallen from their position brother Branham said this he said something is lost and it's groaning it's trying to get back to its original condition he said would you imagine someone falling from the earth down into a deep pit somewhere and and was struggling and climbing and pulling he says they must by some means get out of this pit they're not in their original state and frantically they're screaming and they're clawing the walls and making noise or doing some way they're groaning because they want to get back to their original condition amen you can see that you know amen when my boys were younger they used to love it when you know we'd go to we'd go to Simple Simons to watch a ball game or uh or the McDonald's or somewhere amen and and there would there would have that hair thing you know you put this special stuff on your head and and and the boys would say Hey Dad that's what you need right there amen it'll make you grow hair again and amen and there's always amen man is looking for something to take away the wrinkles to to put the hair back on your head amen they're looking for a fountain of youth why because this body is Decay we want to be back where we fell from amen we're longing for that oh can you say amen amen Romans 8 and 8 19 says amen for the for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God how many is glad for this message amen waits for the manifestation of God God is preparing you to go back to your position as sons of God Amen says for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation growneth and travaileth in pain until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of our body amen so we can see the Apostle Paul is saying that we are all longing for that position we're longing to go back where we fell from can you say Amen now humanity is under that penalty from God Amen God called man to rule from his soul that's that God part of him it's from that Soul yet they've been mankind is is spiraling out of Amen out of control they're sinking deeper and deeper amen it seems that there's no end or there's no bottom it's just humanity is under the sentence of death at the end of the day there's not a senator that is exempt there's not a preacher or a pope amen there's not a scientist there's not a president that is exempt we are all under the condemnation the day you eat is the day you die can you say man you see God created you with a specific Design Perfection to rule to Reign to have love to have peace to have joy to have well praise the Lord amen but you see Satan comes in and he deforms amen he deforms what God has done now Satan is not a Creator so Satan comes in takes the good that God has created and he begins a man to pervert it ain't my brother Brandon would use it like this he says God gave the power to transform I'm going to call this fellow here amen not the power to create again he had the power to deformed not transformed but to deform now anything to form is taken from its original con estate there is something that's going wrong with it some years ago on patrol going through there in the corn fields I I would think there was a limb I had it blown off of a tree and had fell over a cornice a stalk of corn and the stock was trying its best to get back up straight like it was supposed to be amen but it was deformed because something had happened the stick was laying over it and then the wild creeper in the field which many of you men here and maybe some of you women if you're if you're from Kentucky the women uses the whole just the same as the man amen to get out on the field with a hole and and we call the old gooseneck Amen to chop out the creepers for if you didn't get those Creepers out where the corn was in the roll like this then the creeper would reach over and grab a hold of that corn and wrap itself around gradually so easy so slightly that you would hardly tell with that that it was rapping and finally it gets stronger and stronger and pulls the corn till it's so deformed pulls it against itself and wraps itself around its own Vine deforming it from what it was to something else yet it's still corn but it's deformed corn we are still in the image of God but some of us are so deformed as sons of God that we walk contrary to his word and to his way 8 that he had for us and provided for us to walk setting something the world twists us out of the way and pulls Us close to it away from the straight the narrow strip that God planted Us in to be Sons and Daughters of God Amen sin has done this evil thing to the sons and daughters it's the deformer I know this seems rather strange to speak of it in this way but to deform that's what he was he deformed or perverted pervert means to be changed over from something different and deformed is the same thing is to be brought over and deformed and made into another way yet it was still the same seed but it's deformed are y'all hearing me still sons of God steal the seed of God but yet Satan deforming it amen I want to tell you there are still sons of God that are out here in this world today Hallelujah brother Joe you always were a seed of God you always were a child of God that's what Redemption means is to buy you back redeem your back bring you back to your place amen God's got some names that were in that Lamb's Book of Life God's seen you before the world was ever created sin came in and deformed you but God's got a Divine Purpose for you he's got a Divine call upon you and it doesn't matter what Satan does I believe there is a power Among Us that is greater than any power that the devil could ever hold over you man everything about Humanity seems to be spiraling down Amen in a downward motion the longer we live on this Earth the worse it gets can I hear an amen each new generation I believe it was the Apostle Paul in Romans 7 and 24 says oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death amen who shall deliver me I remember a story of brother that brother Branham tells of Billy Paul Iman and how that that Billy Paul had had got into a habit and Iman he he says about two or three years ago Billy Paul had got to running around there and that's the reason I had to send him to uh what Waxahachie to the schools or public school with a bunch of boys and things and all smoking cigarettes and things and Billy came home one day and and said how you get along Daddy and I seen a vision pop over him and I I said come here for a minute now I want to talk to you and he said what is it Daddy and I said what are you doing smoking cigarettes and he says I'm not and I said don't lie to me Billy and he commenced to crying and he said Daddy I won't do it no more Daddy and I went on out and he went on out and he kept on doing it he wasn't hiding it he can't hide it no no no no so I seen a vision and the Lord showed me that really had disobeyed me and and had jumped through a window and was going laughing and head over heels like that down on through eternity turning over and over and when I came out of the vision I was screaming to the top of my voice oh God don't take my boy only boy I have don't take him Lord I was screaming to the top of my my voice and I told Billy and so Billy that day amen uh he went fishing been hanging on down at the river a lot and there was a man from India there to see me and some other ministers and and we went down into New Albany there with my wife and and and she had to go down there and do something another and and so we went down was I was sitting and talking with the ministers and all at once something said to me get out of here right quick and I thought it was my imagination and I said well now brothers were fixing to go to India as soon as we possibly can and something said get out of here and get to yourself and I I and I I got out of the car and I said excuse me Brethren just a minute I want to go around the corner I'm going to run around the corner and I looked and nobody was looking I said father what is it and he said go to Billy at once and I ran back real quick and Mita was coming up the street my wife and I said hurry hurry hurry name it something's wrong with Billy and we run jumped in the car and took out the Jefferson Bill about five or six miles and when I went into the yard my mother-in-law was standing in the yard screaming to the top of her voice Billy's dying we got him in the hospital and I said what happened she said well he came up me he came down here and had a sore throat and and he was afraid he was going to catch him with that sore throat and tell him he was still smoking cigarettes and and he went down there and your good friend the best best doctor in the nation amen one of the basses Dr Samuel dare and and he gave him a shot of penicillin and swell up about that big and it was just in just about three minutes and he ran up there and they wrapped him in blankets and rushed him to the hospital and I ran out there real quick and here come the doctor down there and took off his hat and says Billy I've killed your boy I said oh doc surely not I run into the room and they they had oxygen over him and everything and pumping and giving him adrenaline over his heart and his his heart just going down and down and I said could I could I be with him a moment and so he just walked out of the room and I knelt down put my hands up on on him and I said dear God please hasn't my heart been broken enough in my days Jesus please oh God give my boy another chance Lord please I ask you with all of my heart as your servant if you'll spare the life of my boy he's so good to me and helps me in the meetings he's so loyal to me and I need him God please don't take him high ass that you not and I looked and I saw a vision of him falling like that turning over and over like it was a couple of nights before that when I had seen the vision and then I seen two big arms come out and catch him like this and start burying him right back up going right back up like that and I raised up and Billy turned around just just as black as he could be in his lips swelled way out his eyes had turned real red turned back and he said daddy where are you daddy where are you Daddy and I said I'm standing right here honey it's all over now amen there was one amen as Billy Paul was going down and down and down and down and down amen but yet amen through the through the Cry of a father there was too big a arm oh Hallelujah if God could pull Billy Paul from the Flames if God could go then how much more can God take humanity take my Fallen Heart Take Your Fallen heart amen and bear you back to your position I say today there is a position amen and it's not depression it's not discouragement it's not sin it's not hell it's not unforgiveness but there is a position for the believer the position is what God placed you in at the beginning as Sons and Daughters of God can you say Amen man Hallelujah brother Branham tells the story of when he uh when he was a little boy Iman and as a boy aren't hunting with his friend and his friend has shot his legs a mountain the backside of his legs just totally blew blew them off and they mine he had no muscle in the back portion of his legs even he even threw out of his his adulthood amen and so there he was he was he and he had lost so much blood and and they tried to give him this and that and he just kept sinking prayer there and further amen and then and as he was as big he began to lose Consciousness and amen he says I was so weak and I'd lost all that blood and I I thought I was sinking into an endless eternity many of you have heard me tell it before sinking into an endless eternity first I was going down like the clouds and through the darkness and sinking down and down and down and first thing you know I was in the regions of the lost and there I scream dreamed and I looked and I am there just everything there was no Foundation to it I I could never stop falling for eternity it looked like I was going to fall there was no stopping nowhere he says oh what a difference from the vision I had here not long ago of being in glory with the people what to contrast amen but in this I was falling and finally I screamed for my daddy of course being a kid that's that's what I would do I screamed for my daddy my daddy wasn't there I screamed for My Mother My My Mother wasn't there somebody catched me there was no mother there I was going and I screamed into God and and there was no God there there was nothing there I was listening to this story I think that's where we are today this America and this world this world is is sinking there's nothing to stop there's no God left anywhere if you guys I guess you guys that that follow Russia did have you all read what Russia has just said I believe it was yesterday amen as as uh as the uh uh Putin was up there they met in rebuking the the American the Western Nations rebuking them claiming to have a God believe in a God Amen and and and yet you know uh uh uh defying the it's an incredible thing I'll put it on the I I'll put it on the uh on the prayer page afterwards but he he he he was saying you say you believe in the Bible and the Bible says that it's wrong Amen to uh for homosexuals and and he says it's wrong and here you'll you'll butcher the bodies of little children and and I mean Putin Putin is preaching and he says until the preachers can't even stand up against it he says God must be very sad amen now it's sad when there is an atheist that is having to preach to us I'm saying we're going further and further and further don't you rely on our churches they're going further and further don't you rely on your opinion it's going to go to the Grave someday what we need is somebody with a strong hand that has the ability amen you can't pick me up I can't pick you up we're both falling we're both going down we're both going down but there is one there there is one who has the ability to pick us up oh can you say man I said can you say Amen hold you Sons and Daughters of God you teenagers listen to me tonight don't pray with your soul let God reach out and grab it Hallelujah he says after a while I've seen them on the most mourned I heard the most mournful sound I ever heard it was the office feeling even a literal burning fire would be more pleasure to the side of what that was these Visions have never been wrong it was just one of the most horrible feelings I've ever had amen I heard a noise and it sounded like a haunted Affair and women and they had that green stuff and you just just could see it in their face and the green stuff under their eyes and their eyes looked like they run back like the women today you know the pain run back on their eyes and they were going [Music] I just screamed and I said oh God have mercy on me have mercy oh God where are you yeah and if you'll only let me go back and live I promise you I'll be a good boy see now that's the only thing I could say God knows that at the day of judgment he'll judge me for that statement that's what I said Lord if you'll let me go back I'll promise you I'll be a good boy when I got shot I told lies I'd done pretty near everything there was to be done only one thing I that I could say hey man I might as well just claim come clean it out while I'm here right now when I look down and see I was half blown in two almost and I said God have mercy you know I never did commit adultery that was the only thing I could say to God Amen I'd never accepted his pardon and all of these things I just say I could only say I never did commit adultery and then they're taking me out there and then in that I cried God be merciful I'll be a good boy if you'll only let me go back for I knew there was a God so help me and uh somewhere so help me those weary creatures all around and I had just been the new arrival and it was the most hideous horrible ungodly feeling it looked like those great big eyes and those big eyelashes out like that run black back like a cat and and look look like that that green stuff had cake hurt and they were just going oh oh Oh What a Feeling can you save mine now now this is what brother Branham is saying I just kept falling and falling and I want to tell you at the end of it all amen God's done here told us in the what's going to be she's going to be cast into that bottomless pit she's going to be cast in the Lake of Fire every sinner amen that has not accepted the remedy of Christ every boy that has not accepted the remedy of Christ I don't care how smart you are and how many muscles you have every girl there'll be a lot of pretty girls who's going to end up in Hell amen but I want to tell you tonight there is a hand that could reach down oh brother let me find the hand amen all sister I pray that you can find that hand and bring you back up to your position in Christ man falling in your falling condition we needed someone to stop us we needed somebody that had the ability Brother Don you couldn't do it for me I couldn't do it for you we're both falling you all can't help each other we're all falling there's no one that can help any are y'all hearing me the pope cannot help you no man can help you there's only one that can help Hallelujah Amen to catch us and to bring us back to our original condition the blood of bulls and goats covered over sin but the blood of bulls in his number to sin blood of the bulls and goats could not erase sin it could not eradicate sin it only covered over sin hallelujah amen now now I spilled something on my shirt I think I've done pretty good today amen I've spilled I've spilled something on my shirt yesterday Hallelujah but it was all right as long as I could put my coat on it covered over the state it did not take away the stain it simply covered Over The Sting the blood of the Old Testament did not take away sin it simply covered over it so that God could come and talk to the people well praise the Lord and I find out today hey man did you know that that that Lucifer the man he was the covering Angel Lucifer was the one that guarded the throne that covered over the

God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing him in the same he says when man before he sinned he said when man sinned he separated himself from God and crossed a great Chasm and put himself in death on this side he left there was no way back exactly there was no way for him to get back oh my now he says there he said amen he says but then when he did God accepted a substitute amen I took it back and when he did he he it was a lamb or a goat or a sheep or something for blood amen which Adam spoke of her Abel spoke of on the other side of the chasm see on that side he's the son of God he's an offspring from God he's an inheritance of the earth he can control nature he can speak into existence he's a Creator himself he's an offspring of God but when he crossed he separated his sonship and now he's a sinner by Nature he's under the hands and Dominion of Satan God took a sacrifice a chemical of the blood but the blood of bulls and goats did not divorce sin it only covered sin if I've got a red spot on my hand and covered it with white the red spot's still there it's still there see but God sit down from heaven a bleach for sin it was the blood of his own son and that's when our sin our confessed sin drops into God's Bleach then try to find it again the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators down through time until it hits the accuser Satan and lays on him until the day of judgment what happens to the Sun he becomes a perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance of sin against him no more there's no more stain of bleach or sin can be seen anywhere he's free Hallelujah can I hear a Hallelujah just as that Clorox or that ink can never be Inked no more because it's broke up and sent back again when can fast sin is confessed and dipped into the blood a man or a woman that's been dipped in the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and lays on him till the day of judgment where his eternal destination will be thrown into the Lake of Fire and the chasm is bridged and never to come into remembrance no more a man stands Justified as a son of God oh the power of the blood when we needed that when we needed it God sent us one that could that could bridge the gap on that side you're a son on this side you're a sinner and there was no way to get back over there was no way to get back but Jesus Christ came God created himself a body and he took he took the the that invisible God he made a bridge so that you can get back to where you fell from so that you can get back to your position again well praise the Lord amen so that you can get back hallelujah how many wants to be back hallelujah amen he says now Moses under the blood of bulls and goats with this confession in the word of God God can take that simple man and put his words in his mouth and he proved he was Jehovah's servant for he could walk out there and Jehovah spoke to him by a vision and he walked out there and stretched his hands toward the east now God had spoke to him it's God's thought God uses man God spoke to him it's right he said go stretch your rod in your hand towards the east and say flies Moses under the blood of that goat sheep walked out there took that stick reached toward the East and said thus saith the Lord let there be flies He Walked on back it had already since it's already spoke it's a thought now it spoke it's expressed it's the word of God then it comes into the human lips a simple man under the blood of a bull or goat I want you to listen to this now the first thing you know a green fly begin to fly around the next thing you know five pounds per yard what was it it was the spoken word it was the word of God spoken through Moses the Creator under the blood that he was standing in the presence of God and his own words wasn't his words and if you abide in me and my words abide in you you will ask what you will and it will be given to you that where is the church standing to act Amen Let There Be frogs there wasn't a frog in the country in an hour's time they were 10 foot deep in places what was it it was God the Creator hiding himself in a simple man I want to ask you something if the blood of bulls and goat can be be used for a bleach which can only cover could could put a man in a position to speak the creative word of God and to bring flies into existence why do you stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ's own blood who could speak a squirrel or something else into existence amen don't you do it don't stumble over Simplicity believe that he is still God and if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart and believe what you have said it will come to pass you can have I I'm talking about taking a mind from a a position of falling creature going downward and downward and down I'm talking about taking a man out from under the covering of some religion I'm bringing them under the true token of the blood then that man Hallelujah he doesn't have to wait till he gets on the other side he doesn't have to wait till he gets a new body he can believe God's word right now and can speak that word can you say Amen hallelujah oh the blood of Jesus Christ puts you back in speaking condition with God ah yes Hallelujah he goes on he says God can sweep himself back down through the streams of time and tell you back there just exactly what's happened and to tell you just exactly what you are today amen what you what would be to come he said that steal by the bleach now he's talking about his own gift about how the Lord is you used him he says if God can go back to the streams of time and tell you what's happened back in your life tell you what you are today and what is going to be that steal by the bleach of Jesus Christ who can take a sinner to bleach him into there and he stands in the presence of God and if you abide in me somebody say of you abide in me and my words in you you can ask what you will and it will be done that he that does believe the works that I do shall he do praise the Lord now don't fall asleep don't fail to see it and I say don't fail to see it the blood takes your sins so far away from you that God can't see your sins anymore as long as you're under a covering as long as you're hiding them as long as you're sweeping them under as long and that's what the scripture I just read amen remember he that has brought you out amen wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revealing of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the formal lusts in your ignorance but as he which hath called you as holy be Ye Ye holy also oh can you say Amen what is he doing he's bringing you back Hallelujah oh condemnation condemnation oh condemnation is is the number one tool of the enemy he wants to condemn you and if he can condemn you and brother the thing is it's easy for us to listen to him because every morning you get up you're having to look at that oh amen that old body that is that is continuing to die and you've got another wrinkle and you've got another gray and you've got another zit or you got a whatever amen the imperfection is is there and it sees you amen and then Satan comes in and he begins to point at your weaknesses and he begins to point amen at where you know well if you were a son or if you were a daughter or if you were the bride or of you amen but it's time for somebody to stand up and say Amen yes I'm still living in a body of Decay but this Soul has been caught this Soul has been redeemed this Soul has now found its rest in his hands Hallelujah yes yes yes sister Sharon you're at home

too many coverings amen Pentecostal Pastor in town which was a was a buddy to me when I he was an elder to me when I was a kid I was 19 when I came here and so the assembly is a god preacher he liked me and took me in and well he was trying to get us to be assembly to God and he told me one time he says little brother he was about this tall and he'd say little brother now I know that what you're preaching is Bible and that's right but you see son no one can live that today no one can live it and I'm thinking am I going to come now he's trying to make me an Assembly of God and he's trying to tell me that my little congregation this little congregation could be traded for a big congregation somewhere he says with all of your talents you're a good songwriter good singer the youth in this town loves you he says if you become one of us you could you could really go places now that's a cover are you understanding the moment that someone says well I know the Bible says it but for this day we don't have to do it's okay for you to keep on smoking you better you better send that preacher right on a running any preacher that that that would agree with you and when when and and instead of trying to stand there for the word and stand your uh you know that that you not be harmed and spirit or a matter in your soul or amen any man that would do anything else you better you better send him running because all he's wanting is just to put a covering over you but when the covers are all taken away don't tell me you're under the blood of Jesus Christ and you're still excusing sin in your life yeah coverings is not Redemption covering just pull the cover up sin's still there but the blood eradicates sin there's nothing there I want nothing there I want oh come on church I want to come before God I want to know there's nothing there I want to come and pray and the devil amen can come and say whatever he wants to say but I want to say it's under the blood but yet Satan wants to come in amen amen he'll start pointing to your past he'll start he'll send a he'll send a amen of thought into your mind amen and make you think that you're the worst Christian that's ever come along well

Lord I'm sorry and God give me Grace he puts it under his blood never to remember it again praise the Lord so if I was a cigarette smoker and I don't want to hear it and I'll go down to the next Church it says it's okay why would I do that why would I go down there and still have the devil still have the devil controlling me when I can go to a church that believes that there's plenty of Power in the Blood well praise the Lord what's become his people doesn't feel sin a sin but the scripture says this or brother Branham he says now listen he says sin had left his Crimson Stain but he washed it white as snow then Before the Throne I stand in him complete oh my how can I be complete how can I be complete because the blood not me somebody say the blood not me but the blood stands between God and me I accepted it I'm a sinner but he's God the chemistry stands between me the kill of sin so God sees me just as white amen as the water that's in that bleach sin is gone it can't reach him because there's a sacrifice laying there where's our faith to believe the simple word of God just what God Said take him at his word well praise the Lord I feel pretty good right now Ephesians 2 and 13. now in Christ Jesus he who sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he everyone sat with me for he is our peace one more time he is our one more time hey what that means the condemner has no say keep it up there the condemner has no say he has made uh made peace for us go back up to that other verse previous verse now in Christ you who sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood for he is our peace who hath made both one and have broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contain in ordinances for to make in himself of Twain one new man y'all's missing that that's good chat material amen but for to make in himself of Twain one new man Soul making peace that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby I just want to tell the devil put that in your pipe and smoke it I am a Son of God Amen the power of God resides in me amen I the blood of Jesus Christ has made me free from condemnation I want to tell you this morning you might have sinned yesterday but you put that under the blood of Jesus Christ today don't you be hiding it put that under the blood of Jesus Christ today and I want to tell you the moment that you repent of that that sin is no longer there it's not in the mind of God Satan might bring it up he might bring it up in your memory but when you stand there you are Justified before God the blood has done what nothing else could do think about it sling demon t sling the enmity means the hostility is gone no more friction the Venom the resentment the bitterness the bad feeling hostility is gone having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the father now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God anything you ask in mind are you all hearing me if you speak to that mountain and doubt not in your heart you can have what you say it's not saying after the Rapture you're going to have it you don't need it on the other side of the rapture you need it right now and the blood has put you back in that position to believe God the blood has put you back in that position to where you can believe God for the supernatural Hallelujah well praise the Lord the powers of Satan over you came by sin sickness came by sin depression came by sin oppression came by sin death comes by sin cancer comes by sin any sickness came by sin because of sin When sin came into the world all of these other things came when you deal with a sin problem then you deal with a fruit when you cut the root you got the fruit so that means I can I can before God in this Fallen by and come with the blood of Jesus and says I know that Fallen man is condemned to die doctor says I've got cancer and there's no way to live and a man can stand up with that faith and says but there's no sin found in me anymore it's been dealt with by the blood of Jesus Christ now I'm coming up to the throne of grace I'm coming up not begging I'm coming up very confident the blood has taken away my sin and I'm asking God that you heal me of my cancer or the devil's cancer and God can well you'll hear me you can believe God in your life you can believe God for your family you can believe God for your children you can believe God in every situation well praise the Lord brother Brandon would be he says let me explain it to you like this all sin and sickness was settled when God dealt with it at Calvary some 1900 years ago when his son saved died to save us from sin and sickness he was wounded for our transgressions where the stripes we were healed that's what the scripture says I don't mean that he made one atonement for your sickness and one for your sins he made one atonement and that was for sin and when you deal with sin you've got to deal with every attribute of sin the human race as we're taught in the scripture didn't have any sickness before sin came then When sin came in sickness was issued in as an attribute of sin which has to bring death sin is death sickness follows sin worry follow sin did you ever notice how horrible of a thing where he is there's not value in it at all can you say man but you can come through the blood well praise the Lord I just need to know I just need to do this now I need another scripture I I just I I just say okay I'll give you another scripture Colossians 1 and 20 and having made peace blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated in the enemies by your mind by Wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death are you ready for this to present you holy unblameable unreprovable in his sight well glory to God Hallelujah yes yes no you don't know what that means to me amen brother when are you saying that you're not going to ever sin no more I am saying there's a sacrifice for me I'm saying when I fall I've been taught don't you hide that thing you put that thing out and you expose it in front of that light and say God now here I am religion wants to hide everything hide everything all right they just say you're okay you're okay you're okay and then all they're all they're hiding the Bibles all they're hiding can you save me it's okay if you want to live a lesbian life it's okay if you want to keep well praise the Lord I still think it's wrong to choose gold I still think it's wrong to smoke cigarettes I think it's wrong to look at women amen and lust after I I still think it's wrong to lie to your wife and to lie to your husband I think sin sin but there's a remedy for sin don't continue going during further inspiring spiral inspiring and More Lie going to the next and the next and the next now get the thing cut let the merciful hand of God catch you put that under can you say Amen Hebrews 9 and 12 neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption somebody say Eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of the heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God well praise the Lord

Hallelujah well praise the Lord one last word here one quote brother Branham says he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it into this sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world that anointed bridegroom which foreordained you has washed you by the blood or by the washing of the water by the church the congregation says no that doesn't sound right does it he says you might find that in the almanac but it won't find it in God's Bible you are what by the washing of the Water by the word in the word you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now you are standing if you're standing on the word of God and with the word of God every amen every jot every Tittle where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from those Shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right

and someone took my place I cannot die for that sin somebody took my place and Jesus the word took my place he became me that a sinner I might become him the word let me hold true to it not to the church to hold true to the word oh that spiritual union of Christ in his church now when the flesh is becoming the word and the word is becoming flash manifested Vindicated that's what the Bible said what happened in this day it's happening day by day why is the combination so fast it says we're near the coming of the Lord to be United with his church where the word becomes the word call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts you're standing complete you never sinned at the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God and you're standing there washed are y'all that's a that's a powerful quote I'm gonna I'm gonna stop right here for a minute I'm gonna finish reading that but y'all remember amen that that uh that man that came up to the prayer line amen and uh he was he was getting that those discernments I mean they were eight and he was brother Brandon was reading them off and so was and he was a cigarette smoker and uh he came he came up into that line and uh but he repented as he was coming up said Lord forget me I want to lay those things down and when he walked into the presence of the prophet the prophet could not even he could not say now now brother Branham had already been telling those he says now he's now if you'll put down those cigarettes and he would he would simply he said the Lord will heal you with this another place he said well he said there's one thing that's holding you up from your Victory and that's those cigarettes he's a vow to the Lord get rid of those cigarettes and and and he'll he'll he'll perform his word or whatever so this man comes up and he's thinking oh and brother Branham could not see the cigarettes in fact he seen him as a as a clean Son of God praise the Lord someone had asked him afterwards he said he said hey I repented of it before I got to the prophet and the Lord took away though that that desire for cigarettes you hear that we're talking about minutes before he stood in front of the prophet and God couldn't even reveal it to his prophet the sin was repented of [Applause] another another woman sister Bruce in in that in her testimony she said oh brother or this is an interview brother Brandon's having that interview and they recorded it and she's arguing with brother Branham now in the discernment she said Oh Brother Branham I I'm a bad person I'm a real I am a bad person I'm nervous and I talk out of hand and I and I do this and and brother Brandon says sister proofs I'm looking at your life I see nothing the pure blood of Jesus Christ God would show me if there was something held against you there's nothing there oh if we if we could ever get that Revelation oh Satan is the one that's trying to tell you but you're this and you're welcome but but you could just I believe when it's under the blood of Jesus Christ God himself cannot see yourself there she was argued she was arguing but for the Brenham sister Bruce sister Bruce the devil's got you worked up and nervous there's nothing against you you say oh our brother Brandon was here to discern that no no no no no we're thankful we're thankful that God sent us a prophet so that we can see in our lives anything under the blood can Satan who built those complexes he'll build that complex and then you've and and he's got he's got he's got you believing believing that is not even the right he's got you thinking that you're not forgiven that you're not and he'll just keep it up and before you know it that complex will take you out to do the very thing that he's trying to accuse you of you take a man that's been delivered uh from a lust devil and that Old Devil you know and then and and and and and he's delivered from a lost devil let's let's call it pornography and then that Old Devil amen will come in and try to tempt your Humanity like he does every living human man any of you men that'll say you're never tempted you're a liar and Satan's out there to get you but what he'll try to do is he'll try to get that and then he'll go huh you weren't delivered that girl she cuts your eye and before you know it he'll build that complex around you and it'll take you right back out there that's the deformer that's the deformer trying to snatch but I guarantee you stand with the blood of Jesus and says we're not going there we're not going back I'm not going to that former condition the blood has touched me and when that blood has touched me I can stand there as a son of God praise the Lord amen now you wives don't be looking at your husband saying what kind of thoughts do you think I'm not saying we're dwelling on those thoughts I'm saying there's a lot of devils out there to tempt men just like there is a lot just like just like there's a lot of feminist Devils out there that try to take you women those feminist spirits are out there and sometimes when you get mouthy and you get and you or maybe you get riled up or you do something out of place what does Satan try to do tell you you ain't got the Holy Ghost and he'll condemn you and condemn you and condemn you and condemn you and condemn and yet you know your heart is to be true to your husband and to follow his headship and to follow the word of the Lord you know that's your heart but Satan comes in and he tries to keep and what and before you know what if you allow it he'll build around that little complex for you know it he's got you deformed into the very thing that he brings you out from under the blood well I'm preaching better than you're a man and or maybe I'm preaching pretty good and you're just thinking Hmm he wants to do it and he'll use it he'll build a complex around you until you don't even feel worthy to pray you don't feel worthy to ask you don't feel worthy to stand and give your and give glory to God you don't feel worthy and here you are blood wash and God doesn't see anything against you You're The Virtuous bride you've believed the word of God how many beliefs the word of God how many sweeping sin now I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand how many sweeping sin under the rug what do we mean by that well hiding it in Disguise blaming somebody else for your sin blaming somebody well that sin ain't forgiven that sin ain't forgiven you can't blame nobody but yourself for your sin no one else is guilty you're the one who committed sin and you can't you can't take it to the pope you can't take it to that church well that that preacher says it's okay well that one's the reason and this one and this one you've got to bring that sin out before God put it under his blood because his hand is here his grace has been extended to this age greater than any other age I want to say any other race there has been no other Prophet messenger like has been in this last age God Vindicated over and over and over and over and the and the beauty of it is it's all on tape to where you can see that God was here in a supernatural way you know God was with him and when that Prophet could stand up like there was Sister Bruce when that prophet's looking through those eyes and since Mr Bruce I'm looking over your life there's not this is the same Prophet this is the same prophet this is the same prophet that when the girl came in and she was almost insane she literally home was almost insane she was a uh Sunday school teacher or something of that nature she's been in it in and out of institution she was gone finally her Methodist Pastor said go down and talk to brother Branham he might be able to help you she gets an interview with him in his and she's just nervous she's just she's out of her mind she's up and down and in and out and brother Brandon's just sitting there talking he starts talking about us about a deer hunting and starts talking about this and that and trying to just calm her spirit down and finally a vision breaks out over her he asked her about that man tells her exactly where who she was with where he worked where things took place at she said don't say that don't say that it's don't don't say that she said that's all been forgiven he said no it hasn't been forgiven no no I couldn't see it if it was forgiven she said I made that right with God he says you didn't make that right with your wife or your husband he said you didn't sin against God you sinned against your vow to your husband she said I can't tell him I can't tell him he'll kill me he'll he'll divorce me a wreck her home she says he says well you're going to lose your husband anyways you're going to lose your mind and at the end you'll go to hell she said I can't tell him he says that's up to you and finally

you're the worst amen Jesus came for the meanest man in town one time he did the Bible says that he went across the seas I don't believe her by the way amen okay she came he came across the seas for one man and the Bible says he was a maniac there was a man that was living in the tombs the Devils had got so on him that he drove him from his family drove him from his his wife his children he was now living in the Tomb the graveyard the Bible says that they had tried to put chains on him and he would break the chains out with such demonic strength he was a Madman evil man you could have started but just wanted to lie to Mama and then before you know it it just he'd started going then and then it turned into a something else and then one sin turned to another and now here he is the Bible says Jesus had to go across that sea now the devil knew the ship was hidden in that direction that he that that he was living in that man and the devil tried his best to sink Jesus and the disciples he had a storm that came up sent a storm and There Were Ten Thousand Devils trying to sink Jesus in that ship trying to sink those boys those disciples in that ship Jesus said I told you I was going to meet you on the other side I told you we had a purpose for going to the other side I gave my word I'm going to the other side because there's a man in Gardena amen and there when he got to go to gadara Mary come to the wild man and just his presence those demons begin to scream out why have you come to torment us before our time just as presence caused them to start speaking to him why have you come to torment us before our time Jesus said what's your name Legion for we are many [Music] Jesus had already left his healing campaign he had left thousands of people over here told the disciples get in the ship I'm going to meet you get in the ship get away from the crowd and I'll meet you and as is going over Satan knows what's going on Satan's trying to destroy Satan's trying to keep him from the purpose Jesus gets on the other side after he battles all those devils and now here's this do you think Jesus is just going to have a nice little polite church service Jesus came purposefully for this man that was bound by thousands of devils you know what Jesus done Jesus says come out of him and those Devils I said wait a minute if you're going to cast us out won't you let us go into those pigs see demons have got to have bodies they gotta have bodies let us go in those pigs and the Bible says that there were two thousand pigs and they got into the pigs and ran 2 000 pigs right off into the river and drowned them all that devil is mad that devil got into those pigs those swine took them and made and drowned them but the man of the gadarenes the man that had so many devils the man where the devil would soon take him and attack him and it would throw him in the fire and he would and he would rip his clothes and it would be like a person with epilepsy a man that couldn't live with his family or no one he was a Madman he was insane he was crazy [Music] there was no hope for him [Music] Jesus came Jesus didn't wrestle with the Devils Jesus just said come out of him you know what happened any of you kids know what happened you've seen it in Jesus in the Jesus movie if y'all seen that or the Jesus uh they're on the other play there and has anyone went to go see that Jesus play there in Branson the next thing we know he is clothed he's not naked no more he's in his right mind and he asked Jesus can I go with you Jesus says well you need to stay behind them because he had a mission there to do and the Bible says the fame of this man being healed and delivered set free he was just as nice of a man as one of your daddies just as nice as could
