[1:04:29] bless you God richly bless your
[1:04:30] Ministries bless your congregations back
[1:04:33] home and uh the evangelists that are on
[1:04:36] the field we need evangelist on the
[1:04:39] field uh we need this message being
[1:04:41] preached and uh not ashamed of it but
[1:04:44] preach it in the in the power and
[1:04:47] demonstration of the Holy Ghost and uh
[1:04:50] so if you have your
[1:04:52] Bibles we'll just turn over to Matthew
[1:04:56] uh the 16th
[1:04:57] chapter and then we'll turn just read a
[1:05:00] scripture out of Luke 17 and verse 30
[1:05:05] and um our voice has been weak over the
[1:05:08] last seems like I've been struggling
[1:05:10] with it over the last couple three
[1:05:12] months and uh uh strained it a little
[1:05:16] bit last night and I know this is the
[1:05:18] last service and I
[1:05:20] know probably a little bit
[1:05:23] tired but uh if God God will just give
[1:05:26] us the grace we have it in our heart to
[1:05:29] just uh say something that'll that'll
[1:05:33] that you can just take home with you and
[1:05:35] it'll be a strength with you throughout
[1:05:37] the weeks and months to come and and uh
[1:05:41] we just
[1:05:43] uh we just pray that uh we can say
[1:05:46] something that'll be a
[1:05:48] blessing Matthew the 16th
[1:05:51] chapter verse 15 and down to the 18th
[1:05:54] verse and these are very familiar
[1:05:57] portions of scripture to us he saith
[1:06:00] unto them but whom say ye that I am and
[1:06:04] Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art
[1:06:08] the Christ the son of the Living God and
[1:06:12] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[1:06:15] art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and
[1:06:19] Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[1:06:22] my Father which is in heaven and I say
[1:06:25] also also unto thee that thou art Peter
[1:06:28] and Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:06:31] church now brother randam was show us
[1:06:33] that he didn't build it on
[1:06:36] Peter neither did he just build it on
[1:06:40] himself but he was building the church
[1:06:43] upon the revelation of who Jesus is and
[1:06:47] upon this Revelation I will build my
[1:06:51] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:06:54] Prevail against Ed now Luke 17 and:
[1:06:58] 30 even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:07:03] the son of man is
[1:07:06] revealed now may God add His blessings
[1:07:08] to the reading of the word you may be
[1:07:11] seated for a text I would like to just
[1:07:15] uh title this we have the
[1:07:18] answer and uh you know uh Paul would
[1:07:22] tell us that the preaching of the
[1:07:25] revealed truth is to bring us all into
[1:07:28] the unity of the faith it is to bring us
[1:07:32] into the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:07:34] into a perfect man which is a mature man
[1:07:39] and we understand that we're made
[1:07:41] perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ but
[1:07:45] the word is to bring a maturity in our
[1:07:48] lives and uh every age that portion of
[1:07:52] word that was preached brought forth uh
[1:07:55] a furtherance an advancement of the
[1:07:58] Gospel into the individual's life and so
[1:08:02] we have advanced from justification
[1:08:04] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:06] Ghost unto the word itself the Holy
[1:08:10] Ghost living the word in the individual
[1:08:14] and this would be the full measure of
[1:08:18] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:08:21] and it the purpose is that we would not
[1:08:24] be no more children tossed to and fro
[1:08:28] carried about with every wind of
[1:08:31] Doctrine by the slight of men and
[1:08:34] cunning crafty craftiness whereby they
[1:08:37] lie and wait to deceive how many knows
[1:08:40] that we're living in a in an age of
[1:08:42] great deception it'll be so close it
[1:08:44] would deceive the very elected if it
[1:08:47] were possible but we're to speak the
[1:08:50] truth in love that we may grow up into
[1:08:54] him in all things how many remembers
[1:08:57] we've been restored unto all things and
[1:09:01] so we are growing up into Christ in all
[1:09:05] things and he is our head Christ is the
[1:09:10] head of the church and now brother
[1:09:12] bradam would preach a sermon Christ is
[1:09:15] revealed in his own word and he would
[1:09:17] say I would like to take this for a text
[1:09:20] he says now where I come to the
[1:09:22] conclusion to talk on this was pause
[1:09:25] knowing that we that what we say we
[1:09:28] mustn't just say because we're gathered
[1:09:31] together to just haphazardly speak on
[1:09:33] anything but it's something that will
[1:09:36] help stabilize the people for we are
[1:09:39] going to pass through dangerous
[1:09:41] treacherous Waters so the prophet knew
[1:09:44] that we were going to go through some
[1:09:46] dangerous treacherous Waters so he's
[1:09:49] going to bring something that is going
[1:09:52] to stabilize the Church of the Living
[1:09:55] God we're already selling through them
[1:09:57] and sometimes I guess it's with you like
[1:10:00] it is with me that seems like so much of
[1:10:04] it it's just scary how many can say
[1:10:07] we're living in treacherous times and
[1:10:10] sometimes we can it just flat out scary
[1:10:14] but you see the prophet is showing us
[1:10:16] that we've got something he's giving us
[1:10:18] something that is going to stabilize us
[1:10:22] now the prophet of God would say when a
[1:10:24] man once catches that vision of the
[1:10:28] invisible God and know that he's always
[1:10:32] present there it is he's always present
[1:10:36] there is something that stabilizes that
[1:10:39] man's thinking it stabilizes his actions
[1:10:44] and in the time of distress and trouble
[1:10:47] it'll still make him look upward and
[1:10:50] above the things that are happening
[1:10:52] around him because he's looking at the
[1:10:56] Unseen yet by promise so God is not
[1:11:01] wanting us to look around at what's
[1:11:03] happening around us but he's wanting us
[1:11:07] to look upward and catch uh the vision
[1:11:11] of the invisible God and so we see that
[1:11:14] that is what this great revealing what
[1:11:17] is revealing it's an un an unveiling
[1:11:21] that thing which was hid that thing
[1:11:23] which is invisible
[1:11:25] is now made known and this is the thing
[1:11:29] that is going to stabilize the Church of
[1:11:32] the Living God Amen so the pro uh Paul
[1:11:36] would say that I pray I've heard of your
[1:11:39] faith your Believers you're you're holy
[1:11:42] go you're a holy ghost fill church but
[1:11:45] this is my desire this is what I'm
[1:11:47] praying that God would give un to you
[1:11:51] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[1:11:55] the knowledge of him that the eyes of
[1:11:59] your understanding being Enlighten that
[1:12:04] you may know say that I may know what is
[1:12:08] he speaking of it's speaking of a
[1:12:11] revelation that it may be revealed to
[1:12:14] you what is the hope of your calling of
[1:12:19] his calling and what the riches of the
[1:12:22] glory of his inheritance in the Saints
[1:12:26] and then this is such a precious
[1:12:29] scripture to us because it's saying that
[1:12:32] the eyes of your understanding would be
[1:12:35] enlightened and here we are living in
[1:12:39] Leota Le oia is blind and don't know
[1:12:44] gross darkness is covering this age but
[1:12:47] you see here we are living in the
[1:12:50] Fulfillment of Paul's desire for the
[1:12:53] church that are eyes would be
[1:12:56] enlightened because even Jesus said at
[1:12:59] that day you shall know isn't that
[1:13:03] amazing at that day you shall know that
[1:13:08] I am in my father and ye and me and I in
[1:13:14] you I don't know anything more
[1:13:17] stabilizing than to know that in this
[1:13:21] day when the word is revealed it is made
[1:13:26] known that all that it was a all that
[1:13:30] God is was poured into Christ and all
[1:13:32] that Christ is has been poured into the
[1:13:35] Church of the Living God and he'll never
[1:13:39] leave his church he'll never leave his
[1:13:42] church we're going through some trying
[1:13:44] times we're going through some great
[1:13:47] great great Winds of adversity but the
[1:13:52] stabilizing force of the revealing
[1:13:55] that it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:13:58] glory amen it's an unshakable
[1:14:02] unmovable revelation of who is in your
[1:14:07] ship who is in your flesh amen this is a
[1:14:11] mud ship friends it's just a little mud
[1:14:14] boo but that we are the dwelling place
[1:14:18] of the revelation we are tabernacling
[1:14:23] the revelation of God in morade in human
[1:14:28] flesh amen you see the Holy Ghost alone
[1:14:33] is the revealer of the divine revelation
[1:14:36] of Christ and has been in all ages
[1:14:40] remember all ages who did the word of
[1:14:44] the Lord come to the prophet alone so
[1:14:48] the prophet of God would tell us that
[1:14:51] we're living in an hour that we've got
[1:14:53] to have an absolute because we've got so
[1:14:56] much turmoil so much Winds of adversity
[1:14:59] and so he would begin to preach to us an
[1:15:02] absolute and he would tell us Webster
[1:15:05] says that an absolute is perfect in
[1:15:08] itself Unlimited in its power primarily
[1:15:13] an ultimate Unlimited in its power
[1:15:16] perfect in itself and it really is and
[1:15:20] ultimate the word absolute and the
[1:15:23] prophet would tell us that now every
[1:15:25] great achievement is tied to an absolute
[1:15:29] now now remember the prophet would tell
[1:15:31] us that you are his
[1:15:34] achievement amen how many remembers that
[1:15:36] the prophet of God says that the bride
[1:15:38] of Christ is God's achievement you are
[1:15:42] what God has been building and working
[1:15:46] to achieve in Satan's own Eden amen so
[1:15:50] he says every great achievement is tied
[1:15:53] to an absolute you can can not run life
[1:15:56] without having an absolute you can't
[1:15:58] make an achievement without it being an
[1:16:01] absolute it is the final TI poost it's a
[1:16:06] place where you are tied to something
[1:16:10] and he says in the day that we're living
[1:16:12] in now and everything is so breaking up
[1:16:16] so fragile and carried away I think that
[1:16:20] this message would be a very appropriate
[1:16:23] thing especially to Christians when they
[1:16:25] are going through their deep Waters now
[1:16:30] the Christian church is passing through
[1:16:32] the deepest Waters it's had for the last
[1:16:35] 2,000 years because we are coming to a
[1:16:38] spot to where there is something
[1:16:41] presented to Christianity something they
[1:16:44] have to make a decision on and I think
[1:16:48] that the Christian Church ought to have
[1:16:50] something that they know that they are
[1:16:52] tied to instead of just floating about
[1:16:55] like a leaf upon the Water the wind as
[1:16:58] the Bible said carried about by every
[1:17:00] wind of Doctrine the winds come and blow
[1:17:03] the little leaf this way and then
[1:17:05] another wind Comes The North Wind the
[1:17:07] south wind the East Wind the West Wind
[1:17:10] you'll never get anywhere you're not
[1:17:14] stabled the Christian Life should be a
[1:17:17] stabled
[1:17:19] life are you hearing me the Christian
[1:17:23] Life should be a state AED life it
[1:17:26] should be something that's a principle
[1:17:29] that you're tied to that is more than
[1:17:33] life itself I tell you friends the
[1:17:37] absolute is more than life itself it's
[1:17:41] more than a good job it's more than a
[1:17:44] nice vehicle it's more than having money
[1:17:47] in the bank it's more than just having
[1:17:50] nice clothes it's more than where you
[1:17:52] live uh it's more than life itself and
[1:17:57] what is better than life is the loving
[1:18:00] kindness of God that would reveal
[1:18:03] himself in the son of man and show Mercy
[1:18:07] to your life by putting an absolute in
[1:18:11] your heart that you become unmovable
[1:18:14] unshakable you're something that anchors
[1:18:17] your soul though you may go through
[1:18:20] sickness though you may go through
[1:18:22] discouraging times though the devil they
[1:18:25] tried to shake your home though the
[1:18:27] devil is allowing that this Satan's
[1:18:30] eating is so perverted and filthy and
[1:18:34] Chaos abounds but there is an absolute
[1:18:38] God has achieved a church that is stable
[1:18:42] when everyone else is shifting sand
[1:18:44] everyone else is losing their minds
[1:18:47] everyone else is giving them giving over
[1:18:49] to depression giving over to to false
[1:18:53] false doctrines and false ideas but
[1:18:56] there is a people that is established
[1:18:59] there is a people that has grown up
[1:19:01] under the headship they're mature Sons
[1:19:04] and Daughters of God that's been
[1:19:06] positionally placed by the message of
[1:19:09] the
[1:19:12] hour you see
[1:19:15] Moses God sent Moses to give the people
[1:19:18] an an
[1:19:20] absolute he was an absolute in The
[1:19:23] Exodus and those that received his
[1:19:26] message it stabilized him now there was
[1:19:30] a lot there there was actually a a far
[1:19:33] greater majority that was following the
[1:19:36] message that couldn't surrender to the
[1:19:39] headship of that message and they were
[1:19:42] unstable always wanted to go back always
[1:19:45] longing for this always longing for that
[1:19:47] but you see there was a Joshua and Caleb
[1:19:50] they were
[1:19:51] staple you see they were going through
[1:19:53] the Temptations Just as much as everyone
[1:19:55] else but they were stable they were
[1:19:57] facing hardships just as much as
[1:19:59] everyone else they were stable they were
[1:20:01] thirsty just like everyone else but they
[1:20:03] were stable they were wondering where
[1:20:05] food was going to come from as well but
[1:20:07] they were stable hallelujah what
[1:20:09] stabilized them they knew that Moses had
[1:20:13] a direct contact with the pillar of fire
[1:20:17] and the pillar of fire was being a
[1:20:19] message was being released from the lips
[1:20:22] of Moses and they knew it was thus
[1:20:24] sayeth the Lord and it stabilized their
[1:20:28] actions it stabilized their emotions it
[1:20:32] stabilized everything about them and in
[1:20:35] turn they stabilized their
[1:20:44] home you see Paul Paul met that same
[1:20:47] Pillar of Fire and he gave an absolute
[1:20:49] to the
[1:20:50] church see the prophet of God would show
[1:20:53] us that there was a difference between
[1:20:54] the the Corinthian Church and the
[1:20:55] Ephesus Church and the Corinthian Church
[1:20:58] was always following a man they were
[1:21:01] always wondering about this teaching and
[1:21:04] wondering about what they're preaching
[1:21:05] and following this ministry and
[1:21:07] following that Ministry and it just led
[1:21:10] to caral
[1:21:11] impersonations it led to misplacing scra
[1:21:15] misplacing things of the church and ups
[1:21:17] and downs but you see but you see Paul
[1:21:21] was trying to establish that church
[1:21:23] always correcting that church all always
[1:21:26] trying to tell them hey don't do this
[1:21:28] you need to do this and but you see when
[1:21:30] it come to the Ephesian church he never
[1:21:33] had to do that because they submitted to
[1:21:37] the
[1:21:38] absolute they were all already submitted
[1:21:41] to the pillar of Fire by submitting
[1:21:44] themselves to the voice of God for the
[1:21:46] age and Paul didn't have to always set
[1:21:49] them in order he taught them you're
[1:21:51] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[1:21:55] of the world you've got an inheritance
[1:21:58] uh God has called you for a purpose uh
[1:22:01] God has called you to adoption he's
[1:22:04] predestinated you unto the adoption of
[1:22:06] sons that everything that Adam lost has
[1:22:10] been restored to you and under that
[1:22:13] absolute uh they could stand there
[1:22:16] stabilized uh and meet the challenge of
[1:22:20] the
[1:22:22] age thank you Lord I can't get to
[1:22:25] preaching like that I'll lose my voice
[1:22:27] too much so we'll just go along here you
[1:22:31] see they were
[1:22:33] established now the prophet of God says
[1:22:35] it don't make any difference what others
[1:22:37] want to believe how many can say Amen to
[1:22:39] that Amen to the individual now he's
[1:22:43] bringing it right down to your Pew right
[1:22:44] where you're sitting to the individual
[1:22:47] you are tied to that and then if he is
[1:22:51] the word then this must be the last word
[1:22:55] this must settle it whatever that says
[1:22:58] that's that Scarlet thread that is
[1:23:00] Christ and anything contrary to that I
[1:23:04] know nothing about it I just want to say
[1:23:07] that's where I want to stand anything
[1:23:09] contrary to this absolute I don't want
[1:23:11] nothing know nothing about it I don't
[1:23:14] care to know anything about it I don't
[1:23:16] need to be in the gossip section I don't
[1:23:18] need to know what this is preaching and
[1:23:20] that I really it doesn't matter to me I
[1:23:23] am establ
[1:23:25] I am stabilized under the headship of
[1:23:28] the Vindicated message of the
[1:23:34] hour I'll I I'll tell you friends let me
[1:23:37] just get real for a moment when I start
[1:23:39] hearing about what this and that and get
[1:23:40] know you know that that is something
[1:23:43] that tries to destabilize
[1:23:50] you this must be the last word this must
[1:23:54] settle it whatever that says that's that
[1:23:56] Scarlet thread that is Christ and
[1:23:58] anything contrary to that I know nothing
[1:24:00] about it that's what we want to know is
[1:24:03] what this word says for I am tied to
[1:24:06] Christ and Christ is the word you get it
[1:24:09] now and the portion of his word that's
[1:24:12] lotted for this day his holy spirit is
[1:24:15] here to manifest that portion of the
[1:24:18] word and remember the message is
[1:24:22] Christ now when Isaiah 9 six was made
[1:24:26] manifest it was fulfilled then that
[1:24:29] become the tpost of the word of God for
[1:24:32] that age Jesus Christ the word made
[1:24:36] flesh was the ti poost to the age and
[1:24:40] the prophet says the real Born Again
[1:24:43] people of this age that's filled with
[1:24:46] the Holy Ghost is the tyos of this
[1:24:49] scripture that's got to be fulfilled in
[1:24:51] these last days they are the alt
[1:24:55] it can you imagine this that the word
[1:24:58] made manifest the word prophesied for
[1:25:01] this day made manifest in your flesh you
[1:25:05] become the
[1:25:07] absolute
[1:25:09] unshakable
[1:25:11] unmovable stable standing upon the
[1:25:14] revealed word of the hour and the de and
[1:25:17] and the devil's trying everything and
[1:25:19] yet you stand there as an
[1:25:21] absolute I know you've got a lot of you
[1:25:24] you the devil's trying to tell you how
[1:25:26] could that be it's not you it's not your
[1:25:29] mind you have become pregnated with the
[1:25:33] mind of Christ you know what he wants
[1:25:36] done with the word and you're standing
[1:25:39] saying Amen to every word you're a
[1:25:43] Christian you're a Believer you are a
[1:25:47] son and daughter of God that is an
[1:25:50] absolute to your family an absolute to
[1:25:53] your community an absolute in this
[1:25:55] church you are an
[1:26:02] absolute you say well I what what does
[1:26:05] that have to do with anything well the
[1:26:07] prophet of God says it's God's ultimate
[1:26:10] because it's his word and the word is
[1:26:11] Christ the ti poost there is no way to
[1:26:13] get away from it something that holds
[1:26:16] you as I said it makes you do things
[1:26:19] that you ordinarily wouldn't do it made
[1:26:22] Paul do things he ordinarily wouldn't do
[1:26:24] it made Moses do things ordinarily he
[1:26:27] wouldn't do it makes every man and woman
[1:26:30] do things they wouldn't ordinarily it's
[1:26:33] something that you are Center to it's
[1:26:36] something it's your
[1:26:41] stabilizer do you appreciate that it's
[1:26:44] your
[1:26:46] stabilizer now you see the same Pillar
[1:26:49] of Fire that met Moses met Paul because
[1:26:53] the prophet of God says that Moses wrote
[1:26:55] the Old Testament Paul wrote the New
[1:26:57] Testament it was the pillar of Fire
[1:26:59] coming to these men but you see now it
[1:27:02] is the pillar of fire the same Pillar of
[1:27:05] Fire that has come to William Branham
[1:27:08] and has given us the correct
[1:27:10] interpretation of the scripture because
[1:27:13] the prophet says the mysteries of God
[1:27:15] made known to us in this day by the same
[1:27:18] Heavenly messenger that was made known
[1:27:20] to them in them days the same Pillar of
[1:27:22] Fire that sent Moses the same Pillar of
[1:27:24] Fire that was on Moses that wrote the
[1:27:27] Bible the same Pillar of Fire that met
[1:27:29] Paul on his road to Damascus and now and
[1:27:33] let's just go on down and think of it
[1:27:36] the same Pillar of Fire that come upon
[1:27:40] those men that wrote the Bible is the
[1:27:42] same Pillar of Fire here today
[1:27:45] interpreting the Bible how we thank him
[1:27:48] for
[1:27:49] that this is not just a prophet now how
[1:27:53] I thank him for that that I just want to
[1:27:55] put my voice with this Vindicated
[1:27:57] Prophet how I thank him for that I thank
[1:28:01] him for I I thank you more for that than
[1:28:04] the very breath that I breathe more than
[1:28:07] having money more than anything else I
[1:28:11] have found the correct interpretation of
[1:28:14] the word out of thousands of winds
[1:28:17] blowing out of all the doctrines and
[1:28:21] interpretations I have found something
[1:28:23] just stabilize my
[1:28:26] actions sir not flying this way and
[1:28:29] flying that way I have come back to an
[1:28:32] adopted son back to Authority back to
[1:28:35] what Adam was made in the image of God
[1:28:39] that my soul is stabilizing my emotions
[1:28:43] stabilizing my thinking stabilizing my
[1:28:47] imagination stabilizing reasoning
[1:28:50] stabilizing every sense that the devil
[1:28:53] can anoint I am anointed by the
[1:28:56] stabilizing force of the interpreted
[1:28:59] word of the hour and every other voice
[1:29:02] must surrender to the interpreted word
[1:29:06] of the
[1:29:08] [Applause]
[1:29:14] hour the devil can anoint your emotions
[1:29:17] the devil can anoint your reasoning the
[1:29:20] devil can anoint your imagination
[1:29:23] there's one thing he cannot do and that
[1:29:24] is get in your soul you are a
[1:29:27] predestinated genan seed and the only
[1:29:29] thing that can get into your soul is the
[1:29:32] word of God and it stabilizes you
[1:29:35] friends you've got to realize you it's
[1:29:38] got to strike your heart the Revelation
[1:29:41] must anoint you who you are and you
[1:29:45] bring that mind and subjection to the
[1:29:47] word you bring your desires under
[1:29:50] subjection to the word you bring your
[1:29:53] emotions all of this little this and
[1:29:55] that and this and that you bring that
[1:29:58] subject to the headship of the
[1:30:07] word hallelujah there's a right thing to
[1:30:09] do things do there's a right way to do
[1:30:12] things right yeah that's right so many I
[1:30:16] don't know why I'm going here but so
[1:30:18] many people think that they're Justified
[1:30:20] to do
[1:30:21] something but there's a right way to do
[1:30:23] it
[1:30:24] yes and it takes headship to know how to
[1:30:29] do it well they're wrong and yet you go
[1:30:32] half cocked you go out of order and you
[1:30:36] try to bring
[1:30:37] correction and yet you think you're
[1:30:40] doing God a service but you're out of
[1:30:43] the out of the order of the
[1:30:52] word now
[1:30:55] brother brandom says we thank him for
[1:30:58] that what a comfort what
[1:31:01] identification what
[1:31:03] identification y'all see that that's my
[1:31:06] Lord what
[1:31:08] identification that's my
[1:31:10] absolute that is the correct
[1:31:12] interpretation of this scripture oh I am
[1:31:15] more glad to be identified right there
[1:31:18] than anything else in this world
[1:31:25] I'm so glad to be identified in that I
[1:31:27] don't know what to do I'd rather be
[1:31:29] identified in that than all the Baptists
[1:31:31] Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran and all
[1:31:33] the rest of them identified in that word
[1:31:35] with a shik glory and Revelation lace
[1:31:38] the pillar of fire appearing visibly
[1:31:41] Among Us identifying that the message is
[1:31:44] right like he did at Mount Si remember
[1:31:48] before the true message come forth Moses
[1:31:50] preached and he led them out of Egypt
[1:31:52] but there before the real Commandments
[1:31:54] was laid down the seals was brought in
[1:31:57] God come down before the people and
[1:31:59] prove that Moses was sent from him in a
[1:32:01] pillar of fire that Moses said he had
[1:32:03] seen in a bush and talked to him oh in
[1:32:06] this last days to see that same Pillar
[1:32:09] of Fire right Among Us speaking the same
[1:32:11] word not only that but interpreting it
[1:32:13] by making it manifest and proving it is
[1:32:17] the
[1:32:19] truth see now the prophet of God would
[1:32:21] say that we've got the perfect
[1:32:23] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:32:26] Vindication and now is coming to pass
[1:32:29] what Paul was said when I was a child I
[1:32:31] spake as a child but now I under I
[1:32:34] understood as a child but now when I
[1:32:36] become a man I put away childish things
[1:32:39] you're becoming
[1:32:42] stable you see God Reveals His word in
[1:32:45] his own predestinated season on he says
[1:32:49] how could the Catholic Church know
[1:32:50] Martin Luther's message how could John
[1:32:52] Wesley know uh Wesley know the
[1:32:55] Pentecostal message or how could the
[1:32:57] Pentecostals know this message he
[1:32:59] reveals it in his Seasons because it is
[1:33:03] a seed and as it grows and matures he
[1:33:07] reveals
[1:33:08] himself now Jesus would say in Luke
[1:33:12] 12:42 and the Lord said who then is that
[1:33:16] faithful and wise Steward whom his Lord
[1:33:19] shall make ruler over his household to
[1:33:22] give them their portion of meat in due
[1:33:26] season the prophet of God would let us
[1:33:29] know what we are eating and who we are
[1:33:32] eating in this due season he says the
[1:33:35] son of man is Christ he is the one
[1:33:37] you're feeding on you're not feeding on
[1:33:40] a man a man his words will fail but
[1:33:43] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:33:47] word of the son of man so the son of man
[1:33:51] the revealing of the son of man
[1:33:54] is Eagle's food and it's the food it's
[1:33:58] the diet it's the bread that has been
[1:34:01] broke for the bride spiritual food and
[1:34:03] due season that is establishing you it's
[1:34:07] establishing your heart it is dictating
[1:34:10] your mind it's dictating your desires
[1:34:13] it's dicta it is
[1:34:17] headship now the word of God is to be
[1:34:20] our covering it's headship it's our
[1:34:22] protection
[1:34:23] and Paul said we are to be we're to have
[1:34:26] the whole armor of God ain't that right
[1:34:29] now we believe that Jesus Christ has
[1:34:31] broke the curse of sin off of Our Lives
[1:34:34] He restored us back to what Adam lost he
[1:34:37] he he's redeemed Adam's Fallen human
[1:34:40] race he's restored us back to being Sons
[1:34:43] and Daughters of God now when Jesus came
[1:34:47] he came preaching the Jubilee year you
[1:34:51] see everyone that is in captivity can go
[1:34:54] free amen he would begin to say he's
[1:34:57] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:35:00] poor he sent me to heal the
[1:35:04] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:35:07] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:35:10] the Blind and set at Liberty to them
[1:35:14] that are bruised but you see there's
[1:35:16] another portion of that scripture we'll
[1:35:19] find it in in in Isaiah 61 and it says
[1:35:22] to give unto them Beauty for
[1:35:25] Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the
[1:35:30] Garment of Praise for the spirit of
[1:35:34] heaviness they shall be called Trees of
[1:35:38] Righteousness the planting of the Lord H
[1:35:42] I just want to say briide tree you don't
[1:35:44] have to be in mourning H you don't have
[1:35:46] to look at the ashes of the past uh you

[1:41:23] fresh air of the Holy Ghost and allow
[1:41:27] the joy of the Lord to return to the
[1:41:34] church I don't care what someone did
[1:41:37] yesterday and you shouldn't
[1:41:41] either there's a right way to handle
[1:41:43] things and there's a wrong way to handle
[1:41:45] things and there should be a love of God
[1:41:48] being poured out from the members of the
[1:41:50] body and there should be healing flowing
[1:41:53] through the body because we've come to
[1:41:55] maturity we've come to a we come to a
[1:41:59] revelation how to handle
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:09] things tired of all the back
[1:42:14] biing well I better stop
[1:42:18] it it's anointing strong
[1:42:24] you see the Holy
[1:42:27] Ghost is the dissolver of
[1:42:34] doubts what we are preaching is a
[1:42:37] perfect cure for
[1:42:40] sin sin is
[1:42:42] unbelief it's a perfect
[1:42:47] loosing I tell you what the Holy Ghost
[1:42:50] doesn't want any more of blown Breakers
[1:42:54] the prophet of God said blown
[1:42:56] fuses we got enough electricians in this
[1:42:58] church and I'm sure everyone else is
[1:43:01] caught up to some kind of science that
[1:43:03] we know what a breaker
[1:43:05] is you know when the light goes
[1:43:08] out and you
[1:43:11] know that if your husband don't know how
[1:43:14] to reset a
[1:43:17] breaker I've been I've been called to
[1:43:20] plenty of blown Breakers
[1:43:25] and you almost feel guilty about
[1:43:26] charging them for a service call you
[1:43:28] just kind of want to Tinker around a
[1:43:29] little bit something they
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:33] go because someone was in the bathroom
[1:43:37] with a curling iron or something you
[1:43:39] know and just put two anyways where am I
[1:43:42] going come on
[1:43:49] buddy
[1:43:51] now the Holy Ghost
[1:43:54] let me just put it like this the Holy
[1:43:55] Ghost is tired
[1:43:57] yeah of blown Breakers blown
[1:44:02] fuses I've been called to those old or
[1:44:05] ponies full of them take the fuse out
[1:44:08] put another
[1:44:12] fuse you know and then you you're called
[1:44:15] and they they got a pile of fuses we
[1:44:18] redid it and we redid it and we redid it
[1:44:22] and we thought it would
[1:44:24] hold oh obviously it
[1:44:27] didn't now we got 10
[1:44:32] fuses the Holy Ghost is
[1:44:35] tired on of the church just
[1:44:41] trying they've been trying for seven
[1:44:43] Church
[1:44:44] ages and the Holy Ghost says I'm going
[1:44:46] to bring this church up to an age that
[1:44:50] they can handle the word
[1:44:53] now the only way that you can handle the
[1:44:54] word is a heart of
[1:44:56] Faith that's why Malachi 4 says I'm
[1:44:58] going to return them back to the
[1:45:00] original faith and that's why
[1:45:02] Revelations 10 said there's seven
[1:45:04] unknown Thunders that is going to speak
[1:45:06] in the end time and that's what's going
[1:45:09] to be revealed through that Mighty angel
[1:45:11] coming down with an open book The Seven
[1:45:14] Thunders is not a mystery to us any
[1:45:15] longer the seven Thunders is the word
[1:45:19] that's turned us back to the original
[1:45:21] faith of God
[1:45:24] so no
[1:45:26] excuses no excuses for blown
[1:45:29] fuses we've had a master we've we've had
[1:45:32] a master
[1:45:34] electrician we've had God himself self
[1:45:37] step in on the scene and say hey guys
[1:45:40] we've got a direct short your Creeds
[1:45:43] your interpretation that's what in
[1:45:46] that's what Creed is it's the it's the
[1:45:49] wrong
[1:45:50] interpretation and Jesus said by your
[1:45:53] Traditions you make the word of God of
[1:45:56] none effect I tell you why you can't
[1:45:58] have joy I tell you why you can't see
[1:46:01] Deliverance in your home you've got a
[1:46:03] direct short you're not believing the
[1:46:06] word you're not allowing the word to be
[1:46:09] the absolute to stabilize your life
[1:46:12] you're going after this you're going
[1:46:14] after that you're allowing your senses
[1:46:17] to go haywire and you're not coming
[1:46:19] submissive to the word we've got not the
[1:46:29] answer don't worry I'm preaching to
[1:46:31] myself we've got the
[1:46:40] answer now brother Brandon says the
[1:46:42] problem of it is it's
[1:46:45] grounded and we got blown
[1:46:48] fuses he says you know the prophet of
[1:46:52] God says what You' done is through your
[1:46:54] tradition your interpretation that's
[1:46:56] what the prophet of God said tradition
[1:46:57] is interpretation says through your
[1:46:59] interpretation you've made the
[1:47:01] Commandments of God of no effect the
[1:47:03] prophet of God would say Commandments is
[1:47:04] the promised word of the
[1:47:06] hour I know a lot of people try to make
[1:47:08] Commandments law but the prophet of God
[1:47:11] showed us Commandments is the promise of
[1:47:14] the hour so by your interpretation of
[1:47:18] scripture you are making the promise of
[1:47:21] the hour nonaffective
[1:47:23] Ive and the prophet of God says and
[1:47:26] through our Creed we have disassociated
[1:47:30] the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit to
[1:47:31] anoint the word of God that's laced out
[1:47:34] for this generation now I'm just showing
[1:47:36] you what we've been called out
[1:47:39] of then if we've been called out of
[1:47:42] it we should be called out of
[1:47:46] it you see the prophet of God in the
[1:47:48] greatest battle ever fought he says if
[1:47:50] we could just get that certain thing
[1:47:51] fixed
[1:47:56] he's talking about the greatest battle
[1:47:57] ever fought he's talking about all of
[1:47:59] your senses he's talking about your
[1:48:02] human mind and he said if we could just
[1:48:04] get that Faith problem
[1:48:10] fixed oh God just don't do that today if
[1:48:13] we could get that certain thing fixed oh
[1:48:16] I went through the prayer line but I
[1:48:18] don't know it may just happen another
[1:48:19] year or so if we could get that certain
[1:48:22] thing fixed
[1:48:23] well I I don't know if it's God's will
[1:48:25] for my life if we could get that certain
[1:48:29] thing
[1:48:30] fixed if we could just surrender to the
[1:48:34] absolute of the headship of this message
[1:48:38] and get that unbelief out of our hearts
[1:48:41] the prophet of God says right now church
[1:48:44] if we could be put together and knitted
[1:48:46] with such that every person would be in
[1:48:48] one Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt
[1:48:50] anywhere there would not be be a feeble
[1:48:54] person in our midst in another five
[1:48:57] minutes there would not be nobody here
[1:49:01] Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would
[1:49:03] receive it if you could just get that
[1:49:06] certain thing
[1:49:09] fixed you see what the prophet of God is
[1:49:12] showing us that the Holy Ghost wants to
[1:49:14] have a
[1:49:17] flow if you turn the switch on we want
[1:49:19] the light to come on don't
[1:49:21] we if we turn the PA system on and you
[1:49:24] step behind this mic and you start
[1:49:27] talking and there's nothing coming out
[1:49:28] there's going to be a problem isn't
[1:49:30] there you see when you've come to the
[1:49:32] revealing of the son of man God wants
[1:49:35] something to happen the power has been
[1:49:37] turned on the connection's been fixed a
[1:49:40] prophet has come the Divine interpreter
[1:49:43] of the word has come he wants the
[1:49:46] current flowing
[1:49:51] freely he don't want you getting in the
[1:49:54] way he doesn't want my feelings get in
[1:49:57] the way he doesn't want my Petty ideas
[1:50:00] getting in the way he just wants freedom
[1:50:03] to flow freedom to manifest freedom to
[1:50:07] heal freedom to deliver freedom to touch
[1:50:11] your mind freedom to bring you Joy Joy
[1:50:14] enough to dance Joy enough to shout Joy
[1:50:18] enough to get those sleeves putting
[1:50:21] together and clap for the glory of God
[1:50:23] he wants the
[1:50:27] freedom if he says speak speak if he
[1:50:30] says be silent be silent whatever it is
[1:50:34] he wants to move
[1:50:38] freely because he says the works that I
[1:50:40] do shall you do
[1:50:43] also
[1:50:45] now oh my goodness where does time
[1:50:50] go we're expected to to be tested do I
[1:50:54] have a little bit more time I know it's
[1:50:56] the last service and I'm probably should
[1:50:58] be
[1:51:00] quitting I just want to get this part to
[1:51:03] you you see we're we're expected to be
[1:51:06] tested and the prophet of God would show
[1:51:08] us that the test is the greatest thing
[1:51:09] that ever happened to
[1:51:11] us now he's going to take us back to the
[1:51:14] Garden of Eden and he's going to show us
[1:51:16] in the God of this evil age he says we
[1:51:18] find now this evil age is to prove to
[1:51:21] Satan are you still with
[1:51:24] me she is not like
[1:51:27] Eve talking about you and me that she is
[1:51:31] not that type of a woman that will
[1:51:33] commit adultery with against the word
[1:51:36] and she will be Tried by his word the
[1:51:41] Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the
[1:51:43] word and AD Adam's bride believed every
[1:51:45] bit of the word oh listen all the word
[1:51:51] but confused

[1:52:00] yesterday today say with me
[1:52:06] today say with me
[1:52:09] today there's the
[1:52:12] test there's the test we've got to come
[1:52:16] back around to the same test to prove to
[1:52:20] Satan in his own Eden that we will not
[1:52:23] be like Eve we will not put the word in
[1:52:27] history and we will not put the word in
[1:52:30] a future tense the bride's Revival is a
[1:52:33] present tense revelation of the word

[1:53:43] all
[1:53:44] about now we're understanding why the
[1:53:46] battle that the God of this evil age who
[1:53:49] is interpreting the word keeps trying to
[1:53:51] interpret the word to you like he did in
[1:53:54] in the Garden of Eden when he
[1:53:56] interpreted the word to Eve and talked
[1:53:59] her out of her god-given
[1:54:04] rights if you'll do this you'll become a
[1:54:06] God and she already
[1:54:08] was if you'll do this your eyes will
[1:54:11] become enlightened and her eyes were
[1:54:13] already enlightened and her eyes were
[1:54:16] closed to the things that it need to be
[1:54:18] close
[1:54:19] to quit allowing that devil to open our
[1:54:24] eyes to a whole bunch of
[1:54:29] unbelief well I'm
[1:54:31] preaching quit allowing the Devil to
[1:54:35] interpret this message and you open up
[1:54:39] your mind to a whole bunch of
[1:54:44] hogwash there's one thing you need to
[1:54:46] believe that's where the oil and the
[1:54:48] wine comes from and that is the
[1:54:50] stimulation of the son of man anointing
[1:54:53] the revealing of the word get in this
[1:54:56] message your pastor preaches the message
[1:54:59] stand for it listen to it study it swim
[1:55:04] in it swim in it swim under this
[1:55:08] anointing we're not under a Pentecostal
[1:55:10] shuck we are not under a tassel
[1:55:12] anointing we are under an eagle
[1:55:15] anointing it's time to get caught up in
[1:55:18] the advancement of the word it's time to
[1:55:21] swim
[1:55:28] we've come in advancement there's
[1:55:30] nothing greater than the headship hall
[1:55:33] there's nothing Beyond
[1:55:35] intelligence and we have come to
[1:55:37] intelligence quit trying to add to it
[1:55:41] and don't take away from it but say what
[1:55:44] that absolute says it is the oil and the
[1:55:47] wine
[1:55:49] [Applause]
[1:55:55] if God needs to add anything in your
[1:55:56] life outside of this message he'll do it
[1:55:58] when he
[1:56:00] returns that's direct scripture that's
[1:56:03] exactly what scripture said and that's
[1:56:06] exactly what the prophet said you preach
[1:56:08] this message it's the oil and the wine
[1:56:10] and if there's anything that needs to be
[1:56:12] added to it he'll do it when he
[1:56:18] returns I feel bold as a line I got to
[1:56:20] be careful come on come on come on Budd
[1:56:24] that's good but confused to one promise
[1:56:26] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:56:27] forever
[1:56:29] today but fa on One Promise under the
[1:56:34] temptation of the enemy face to face
[1:56:38] don't tell me that you
[1:56:41] are facing the devil face to face in
[1:56:45] this
[1:56:46] hour come on face to
[1:56:49] face but you see this is the thing
[1:56:53] you've the prophet of God says we are
[1:56:54] coming in contact with the same thing
[1:56:57] and you must believe every
[1:57:00] word that's right there was the test in
[1:57:05] the in the beginning to believe every
[1:57:08] word and it was Satan in a person of an
[1:57:10] animal called The
[1:57:13] Serpent that misinterpreted the word to
[1:57:16] her and was lost it must be every word
[1:57:21] in the middle of the Bible Jesus come
[1:57:23] and said man shall not live by bread
[1:57:24] alone but by every word when he was
[1:57:28] tempted by Satan the prophet of God
[1:57:29] showed us that it was the same exact
[1:57:32] Temptation
[1:57:34] right and he would tell us it's the L
[1:57:37] I'm just thinking of this it's help me
[1:57:38] out with this lust of the eyes lust of
[1:57:40] the Flesh and the pride of
[1:57:42] life exactly what John said in first
[1:57:45] John the lust of the flesh the lust of
[1:57:47] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[1:57:49] life
[1:57:53] and Jesus stayed with the
[1:57:57] word if he would have left the word one
[1:58:00] iota then it would have there never
[1:58:03] would have been
[1:58:04] Redemption and the prophet of God says
[1:58:07] the God of this world will rise up in
[1:58:10] this last days and whosoever shall add
[1:58:12] one word to it or take one word from it
[1:58:14] his part will be taken from The Book of
[1:58:16] Life you see Satan is trying to Blind
[1:58:19] our eyes the prophet of God would show
[1:58:21] us are you are you still with
[1:58:24] me I Satan is show brother brandom is
[1:58:28] showing us that that he says the reason
[1:58:31] that he's that he's got schools raising
[1:58:34] up he's got hospitals raising up he says
[1:58:36] there's nothing wrong with hospitals
[1:58:37] there's nothing wrong with these things
[1:58:39] he said but the problem of it is Satan
[1:58:41] is inspiring these things how many can
[1:58:44] say Amen to that that's all we're
[1:58:46] looking at today Satan just inspiring
[1:58:48] everything and you know what he there's
[1:58:51] a purpose behind it the prophet of God
[1:58:53] says that he is
[1:58:55] trying to Blind your eyes to what God is
[1:58:59] doing
[1:59:01] today he said preach the gospel and the
[1:59:04] gospel is manifesting demonstrating the
[1:59:05] power of the Holy
[1:59:07] Spirit he says he keeps you from seeing
[1:59:11] the true Revelation and Faith of God's
[1:59:13] word being revealed and Vindicated today
[1:59:15] today by his schools libraries
[1:59:18] literature hospitals and so forth he
[1:59:20] keeps you from it he is now interpreting
[1:59:23] as he did to Pharaoh trying to keep you
[1:59:25] from seeing the meaning of the
[1:59:27] Vindicated word of his promised age in
[1:59:29] the evening light Vindicated and proved
[1:59:33] he has tried by his knowledge in schools
[1:59:34] and better better educated people and
[1:59:36] ethics and so forth to keep you away
[1:59:38] from seeing that
[1:59:40] anything anything so that you won't look
[1:59:43] at that and see that's Jesus Christ how
[1:59:47] you know it's Jesus Christ he is the
[1:59:49] word and he's the word of this this
[1:59:53] age he'll tack any dirty name he can on
[1:59:56] it he'll call you H roller or anything
[1:59:58] else he'll call you be El abub all of
[2:00:01] these things but you see he's trying to
[2:00:03] keep you from seeing the real meaning of
[2:00:07] the word he is interpreting it saying it
[2:00:11] means
[2:00:12] this don't you tell me don't don't tell
[2:00:15] me that he's not trying to interpret
[2:00:16] this message that's right when God's
[2:00:18] already interpreted it come on but you
[2:00:22] see the prophet of God would say he said
[2:00:24] the Antichrist would rise raise up and
[2:00:26] would almost deceive the elected if it
[2:00:27] was possible but said let them alone let
[2:00:30] them go ahead their Folly will be found
[2:00:33] out why the word test proves
[2:00:40] it you see what was Jesus manifested for
[2:00:44] to show God to reveal God now
[2:00:49] Jesus so seen it now let let let's just
[2:00:52] look at this the prophet of God says
[2:00:54] today he wants to get somebody that can
[2:00:57] see it oh Satan's trying to keep you
[2:01:00] from seeing it but God are you with me
[2:01:03] now Satan's trying to keep you from
[2:01:06] seeing it but God is trying to get you
[2:01:10] to see it now notice Jesus so seen it
[2:01:15] was so perfectly born for the day until
[2:01:18] God
[2:01:20] expressed every move that he made he was
[2:01:23] God's revelation God revealed now he
[2:01:26] Sanctified with his spirit and blood a
[2:01:28] church that he might make every promise
[2:01:31] in this last day be revealed closing
[2:01:35] with
[2:01:36] this look at the
[2:01:39] Temptation we can go back to the Garden
[2:01:41] of
[2:01:43] Eden and they begin to reason these
[2:01:47] things what what was the what what was
[2:01:50] Satan trying to talk into she he was
[2:01:53] trying to talk her into becoming like
[2:01:56] God it was
[2:01:59] identity he was bringing her into an
[2:02:03] identity crisis but you see it was
[2:02:05] because she left
[2:02:07] headship somehow or another she wandered
[2:02:09] away from her
[2:02:11] head and Satan blinded her eyes to the
[2:02:16] reality of who she was
[2:02:22] look when Jesus was 12 years old and
[2:02:25] Mary and the and the Mary and Joseph and
[2:02:29] all the relatives went three days
[2:02:30] journey and they realized they didn't
[2:02:32] have
[2:02:33] Jesus look look when Jes when they came
[2:02:36] back and they found Jesus discussing
[2:02:40] with the teachers the the
[2:02:42] Pharisees and look her testimony was
[2:02:45] that he is conceived of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:47] that's been her testimony all of these
[2:02:49] years and there under the
[2:02:53] test she denied her own testimony she
[2:02:57] became ashamed of it before all of those
[2:03:01] false
[2:03:04] interpreters yes sir she caved under the
[2:03:07] pressure and she said your father and I
[2:03:10] have sought thee with tears notice Jesus
[2:03:14] at though young the word though young
[2:03:17] spoke up the prophet of God says the
[2:03:20] word correct
[2:03:22] the
[2:03:23] error says don't you know I must be
[2:03:26] catch this I must be about the father's
[2:03:29] business and the prophet of God says the
[2:03:31] father's business if he was of Joseph he
[2:03:33] would have been in the carpentry shop
[2:03:35] but the father's business was to
[2:03:38] manifest the promised word of the
[2:03:42] hour now fast forward and Jesus full of
[2:03:46] the Holy Ghost he's now on the mount
[2:03:50] he's he's he's in the wilderness he's
[2:03:52] being tempted of the devil but look what
[2:03:55] it's over look what the Temptation is
[2:03:58] over if thou be the Son of
[2:04:03] God prove
[2:04:05] it that's exactly where the devil tries
[2:04:07] to tempt every single one of us prove
[2:04:10] it prove
[2:04:12] it you're healed prove
[2:04:15] it you're going to the Rapture prove
[2:04:18] it he'll bring every memory he'll he'll
[2:04:21] he'll anoint your memory like never
[2:04:23] before prove
[2:04:25] it he'll try to make you feel like
[2:04:27] you're a pig when you're when when every
[2:04:29] one of your sins have been put in the
[2:04:32] God's forgetfulness and you have been
[2:04:33] delivered of those
[2:04:37] things but you see the prophet of God
[2:04:39] says the de that that that that that
[2:04:42] Jesus would not proposition with the
[2:04:46] devil he would he he knew Satan's tricks
[2:04:50] he knew he was trying to reason with him
[2:04:53] and Satan just and Jesus just kept
[2:04:55] taking him back to the word if thou be
[2:04:57] the Son of God do this the word if
[2:05:00] you're the Son of God do this back to
[2:05:02] the word if you do you see he's showing
[2:05:05] us how to combat the devil's
[2:05:09] interpretation of scripture he's trying
[2:05:12] to he's trying to get you uncomfortable
[2:05:16] that you deny your
[2:05:20] identity I don't care
[2:05:22] you don't have to prove nothing to the
[2:05:28] devil you see sat Jesus had the answer
[2:05:33] the
[2:05:34] word come on the word was
[2:05:37] correcting you see he even tried to
[2:05:39] interpret
[2:05:40] scripture and look Jesus knew he was
[2:05:44] taking it he was misplacing scripture
[2:05:46] taking it out of context so he put it
[2:05:49] back in context with another
[2:05:55] scripture now again it's all
[2:06:00] identity the prophet of God says I'm
[2:06:03] talking about the headship of
[2:06:05] Christ catch this now I'm getting ready
[2:06:07] close notice being personally
[2:06:11] identified by the original headship we
[2:06:15] have the
[2:06:18] answer to the devil's question
[2:06:22] amen oh you say you're the
[2:06:24] bride oh you say you're healed oh you
[2:06:28] say you're delivered oh you say you're
[2:06:30] going in the Rapture yes sir but being
[2:06:34] identified by the original headship what
[2:06:37] is that headship the prophet of God says
[2:06:39] we have the devil's answer we have the
[2:06:42] answer to the devil's question he Christ
[2:06:45] is risen and has paid the
[2:06:49] price and has raised up as the head over
[2:06:53] the body or has raised up the head or
[2:06:56] the body the devil can't stand
[2:07:01] it that's the reason these ecumenical
[2:07:04] kingdoms are setting up that's the
[2:07:06] reason they're all coming into what
[2:07:08] they're doing now the devil that's the
[2:07:10] reason he's howling the way he is his
[2:07:14] wickedness his scheme has been uncovered
[2:07:17] by the Risen resurrected Christ in the
[2:07:19] headship over his body
[2:07:22] Glory you think I'm beside myself I'm
[2:07:25] not we've got the devil's answer not me
[2:07:29] that liveth but Christ the word living
[2:07:33] in me it's not my
[2:07:38] idea it's not my
[2:07:41] idea I didn't come up with this I'm not
[2:07:45] the one that said you're The Virtuous
[2:07:48] sinless spotless Justified as if if you

[2:08:17] prophecy concerning you for this last
[2:08:20] days and you are the Fulfillment of the
[2:08:23] word that you can believe in
[2:08:26] headship that you can take the devil
[2:08:29] back to the headship of the word and say
[2:08:31] that's my answer that's my answer that's
[2:08:35] my identification don't take it up with
[2:08:38] me take it up with the revealed word of
[2:08:41] the hour I don't have one word to say to

[2:19:01] need I've seen people go to counselors
[2:19:04] for years and years and years and never
[2:19:07] change and they've always got an
[2:19:10] excuse I don't know why I'm here there's
[2:19:13] always there there's always an
[2:19:15] excuse but why not come with a real
[2:19:19] heart say Lord I'm tired of the

[2:19:29] come in this
[2:19:30] day you've come to replace my my ashes
[2:19:34] with

[2:19:40] Garment of
[2:19:42] Praise you've come to deliver me out of

[2:19:47] house then I refuse
[2:19:51] I refuse to stay
[2:19:54] there you know what the prophet of God
[2:19:56] says then you've got to start acting
[2:20:02] different takes
[2:20:05] Faith you can't just say you're a
[2:20:06] Believer and then just continue on
[2:20:09] that's right but your Works testify of
[2:20:12] the Revelation that is in
[2:20:16] you we got to preach these things
[2:20:20] [Music]
[2:20:22] because this is the
[2:20:25] answer we're we're we're looking for
[2:20:27] some answer and yet the answer is the
[2:20:30] word but you got to allow the word to
[2:20:33] have effect in your life and then the
[2:20:35] prophet of God says before you see one
[2:20:37] evidence of your healing you got to

[2:21:01] spirit of the oil and gladness of the
[2:21:04] Holy
