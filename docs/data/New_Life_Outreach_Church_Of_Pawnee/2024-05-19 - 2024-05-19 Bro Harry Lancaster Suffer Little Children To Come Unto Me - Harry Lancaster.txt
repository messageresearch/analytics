me it's [Music] overwhelming praise the Lord praise the Lord it's good to be in the house of the Lord this evening if you would take your Bibles we'll go ahead and turn to Luke chapter 18 18 and we'll start at verse 15 and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but Jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for as such is the kingdom of god let's turn to 1 John chapter 3 1 John chapter 3 and we'll just start at verse one behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it doth not yet appear that we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is let's go ahead and bow our heads Lord Jesus we come into your presence this evening Lord and Lord I I pray that you would take these notes that I've put together and and studied on Lord and Lord may you be the one to provide the inspiration Lord I Lord we didn't gather here to hear some well put together speech or well thought out text that some great Theologian has put together Lord but Lord We Gather in order to to be in your presence and to hear from you Lord and Lord I I stand here and Lord as as brother Williams said this morning I'm I'm nervous I I feel unworthy but Lord I know that you're able to to take control that you're able to to use the vessel Lord Jesus and Lord I pray that you would help me to surrender Lord Jesus Lord help the the people to to listen with ears to hear and hearts to understand Lord and may you take control and be able to minister to the hearts and meet the needs of the people Lord we lord we just we love you we just commit the remain of the service into your hands in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen youall may have your seats now in the sermon let your light so shine before men brother brandom said May our hearts be like little children and we want to be that way Lord simple in our life just nothing high-headed nothing hoty but just simple like little children to love you and Obey you and serve you we know that we don't look for wisdom of this world because because it's foolishness to God we look for the mercy of God and we pray that you'll give Mercy to all those who who are seeking mercy and it is written the merciful shall obtain mercy so I was looking at this verse in Luke where it says to suffer the little children to to come unto me and forbid them not and we live in a society today where children are often looked down upon or viewed as trouble and inconvenience um they don't hold the same value today that they have when you look back through history and you look back over time brother brandom even talked about how often you would have the woman that had her little dog instead of having a child or doing this out of the other and we see that in society where people will have oh these are my my my fur babies these are my whatever and these are where all the focus is is on these animals that they have and I already see some laughing because they call their animals fur babies but it's not because they don't want children uh so there is a difference there um but this is very different from what God's instructions were I mean when we go back in Genesis both chapter 1 ver 28 and chapter 9 ver1 God commands be fruitful and multiply the value on children is also demonstrated when you go through the verses that cover the women who struggled with barrenness or infertility think about Sarah or Rachel or Hannah God places great value on children so when God calls us his child we know that he also places great value on us we can follow the type out that God places this value on children so if we are the children of God then that same great value is placed on us when we continue forward with it Psalms chapter 127 beginning at verse three it says lo children are in Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate and while yes this is speaking about natural children at the same time you can take these verses and you can see the thoughts of our Heavenly fathers he says that children are Heritage they are as arrows in the hands of a mighty man come on and yes we can talk about that as we look at our natural children but it's so much more when you look at it from the spiritual standpoint as God goes you're my children so you're my arrows in the hand of a mighty warrior and we know that God is the ultimate mighty warrior he's above any other mighty warrior that could be so if anyone could fully wield arrows successfully it would be God he would be the one that could truly send them to hit the mark the way that they're supposed to that's right in Ephesians chapter 1 starting at verse three it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will Matthew chapter 18 starting at verse one it says at the same time came the disciples unto Jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and Jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily I say unto you except you be converted and become as Little Children You shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same as greatest in the kingdom of heaven and who so shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me but who so shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea now I don't know how many of you have experienced this before I'd be willing to bet many of you have but my wife is very much a person that if someone messes with her children the mama bear is coming out oh yeah and she's not going to be real happy about it now sometimes she can hold it back so they don't know about it I hear about it the person that did something may not hear about it from my wife but the mama bear comes out to protect her Cubs to protect her children okay and here God is saying the same thing hey if you mess with my children if you mess with one of mine it would be better if you were drowned in the sea it would be better if this happened or that happened and so we can even look at that as how often is the devil messing with each one of us how often is the devil trying to bother us and God is saying even in this verse going very clearly he's got his end coming he's going to get his just desserts for everything that he's done there is no mama bear or papa bear like God there is no one that will respond the same way now when I look at that when I was looking at that verse and Jesus saying suffer the little children to come unto me it made me think a little bit and most of my sermons when I preach come because I get a question in my mind and start thinking about something about well why is this this way or what is this doing and so I was looking at this verse and says suffer the little children and most commonly we use this verse when where children are coming up for dedication or those kind of things but I started thinking about I'm like okay so what do you think of when you think of a little child when you think of the little child are you thinking of the newborn in your mind because each of us picture something it's like are you thinking of the toddler are you thinking of a schoolage child or you thinking of a pre-teen or a teenager what are you picturing in your mind when we read that verse suffer the little child and it may be kind of a range but you kind of picture in your mind okay Jesus having these different children come up whatever it is but I really think that if we take this and we look at it in a spiritual sense when God is talking about the little children I believe he's speaking about every single one of us yes he is speaking about the little ones that are sitting on the front row and he's also speaking about the elders that are sitting towards the back row he's talking about each one of us as his little child and he's saying suffer them to come unto me every single one we all fall into this category of suffer the little child to come unto me Romans 10:13 says for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved now whosoever covers a broad range it doesn't just cover the little children it covers all of us so when Jesus says suffer the little children to come unto me my thoughts continued to progress I'm like okay so what is it that children need from their parents when you look at the different stages of life that they go through as I've slowly developed a larger range of Ages with my kids I have very much learned that the way that I treat one is not the way that I treat the other not only because of their personalities but even because of their ages the way that they're able to handle responsibility the way that they're able to handle this or handle that you have to give each one a little bit different type of attention or different type of care because of where they're at along life's journey now obviously when we're dealing with the newborn and I want you all we're going to be talking in the natural but I still want you to be thinking in the spiritual as we're going so you know when we're talking about that newborn babe we've got little Juniper back there that my wife's holding and the newborn that comes in is utterly helpless the newborn that comes in is looking for love and nourishment it's pretty much the requirements this is this is what I need I need you to nourish me I need you to care for me I don't need you to give me responsibilities I don't need you to give me tasks or chores to do I just need you to love and nourish me that's what what we have and when we start our journey and are born again most of the time we have little to no understanding we know I've accepted God as my savior that's about it we don't really understand what faith is that's right we don't really understand you know we're not going to go through and explain to you all the secrets in the Bible we don't we don't we haven't learned all this we haven't begun to grow or develop we're still in that newborn stage we don't necessarily understand Faith but we have enough faith that when we that we know that when we cry we will receive what we have need of little Juniper can't call out to Mama and use her name and say I want food as brother Brandon would talk about you can't train a baby to ring a bell that hey I I I I need to eat or I need to be changed yes sir but she has she knows that if she cries she will be taken care of because that's what God has given her God has given her the ability to cry and then it's up to Mama to figure out what is this cry for is it for food is it for I need to be changed is it I just need to be loved what is it you're looking for it's up to Mama to figure that out Juniper just knows to cry the baby just knows to cry and when we particularly when we're first coming in that's all we know to do is to cry out to God sometimes and particularly when we're talking with the little ones like there are times when we pray and we don't even know the words to say we're not sure how to try to describe what we're feeling we're not sure how to try to describe the situation we're going through or even what we need from God other than to say God I need you and we're sitting there and we're trusting God as the great father to know this is actually what you need you may not be able to tell me but I know what you need and I can supply that need I can provide for you 2 Corinthians chapter 9 starting at verse 8 it said and God is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth forever now he that ministereth seeds to the Sewer both Minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness being enriched in everything to all bountifulness which causeth through US Thanksgiving to God for the administration of this service not only Supply at the want of the Saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God okay Philippians chapter 4 and verse 19 but my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus God is able to give us everything that we have need of it doesn't mean that he gives us everything we want it doesn't mean that he gives us everything that we think we need but he knows what our needs are and he's going to make sure that we have them when we're crying out and we're going Lord I need you Lord I need something and even as we get further in walk sometimes as we get further along in our walk with the Lord we'll still digress back to the baby stage and go Lord I don't know what I need but I need something I'm sitting in this spot right now and I'm I'm just going to be a baby cuz I don't know what to ask for but I know that you know what I need so Lord I'm just asking that you now Supply that you now provide what I actually need not just what I'm looking for but what I truly need now after we go from the newborn stage you have those that are a toddler for me I've got little silus looks like he's trying to go to sleep over there and I can't remember if my older kids did this but silus has this thing where when I hold him and he'll be talking to me I don't necessarily understand what he's saying but he's talking to me about something and he'll be pointing at whatever and and I will turn to look at whatever and he will reach up and grab my face and turn it back towards him and go no you're looking at me even if he's pointing at something I'm not supposed to look there I'm supposed to look at him he I he has to have all my attention there is there is no it's like great he's talking about the bird I'm not allowed to look at the bird because if I look there he's going to grab my face and pull it back and go no I'm talking right now I'm telling you about the bird so look at me pay attention to me when at that toddler stage he just wants our attention yes he still needs us to sustain him he still needs food he still needs us to love him but he wants our attention he wants us to be focused on him not kind of listening to him while I look at my phone or or not doing this or doing that he wants undivided attention he wants I contact me looking directly at him so that he knows my focus is on him and he'll do the exact same thing with my wife if he's talking to her he'll grab her face and turn it around when she starts to look away as no this is about me right now I want you to look at me at that at that stage he still doesn't understand a whole lot he still doesn't have a lot of wisdom he still doesn't have a lot of this but he basks in the parents attention he basks in the parents focus and those are the times we have the baby stage where we're just crying we don't know what we're asking for we don't know what we're doing we're just asking God to take care of us and then the toddler stage and we're just so focused on we just want to know that God sees us we want to have his attention and at the same time that's the attention God wants I mean it's one of those I can't get annoyed with him with my little boy when he grabs my face and pulls it around I'm just laughing because he's doing the same thing he's looking me right eye to eye he's focused on me and it's just it's cute it's it's adorable it's great if that's what I can feel as a natural father how much more is God feeling this when going Lord I just I just want some communion right now I just want come on to talk to you I want to hear you talk back I want to hear your voice I want to know that you hear me and I just want your attention I want your presence yes Lord I want you to feed me yes Lord I want to know that you love me but I want your attention I want your focus and I want to give you my attention and my focus cuz that's how important you are to me come on I I was waiting for it as silus has been growing it's just been within the past few days that suddenly my buddy cuz he's been a daddy's boy my buddy has suddenly gotten focused on Mama because Mama's busy with a baby and she's distracted and he wants her attention back and suddenly daddy is not quite as important as he used to be I know it's a phase I know I grew out of it but it hurts just a little bit and instead of climbing in my lap he'll run over and try to climb in Stephanie's lap while Stephanie's holding Juniper and yet that's how often do we let that kind of thing slip in between us and God where we were giving God all of our Focus we were giving God all of our attention then we noticed something else and we're distracted come on now there is nothing wrong with Silas wanting his mom's attention nothing wrong but there's something wrong when our attention starts to get pulled away from God because we're distracted by something else because we're looking in a different direction because our focus is changing when that's supposed to be the one who gets our all that's right 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse 12 for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil Luke chap 12: 6 are not five sparrows sold for two Farthing and not one of them is forgotten before God but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows God is never one that is going to stop watching us that's right when we're praying when when we're talking he's still there now we might be going through a time where it doesn't feel like he is maybe it doesn't feel like he's paying attention but he's still watching and his ears are still open for the prayers of the righteous he promises that you know as we go on from this toddler you begin to go into the school age which we have quite a few of those on the front row I'm going to pick out simy and and kylin falling into this this school age where they're beginning to receive instruction they're beginning to to learn they're beginning to grow and a lot of it at that age they want their questions answered I think every parent in here has heard the question why so many times well why well why and you answer and they say well why and why and you can run that Circle over and over and over because they will always keep asking why maybe change it to what now and then or who but they're going to keep asking well why well why well why because they want to know they want to learn and they want you to be able to answer their questions yes they're looking for encouragement they want to know that you are impressed or happy by what they're able to do they're looking for acceptance that you like them for who they are you like them even though they may be different than their brother or sister or they may be different than the kid down the block or the kid in church they want to know that you like them for them simey doesn't wants you to be looking at him going man I wish you were more like kylin kylin doesn't want to be looked at with people going man I wish he was more like Simi they want people to like them and accept them for who they are yeah because Sime is him he is the least around me a little bit quieter one doesn't say a whole lot not quite as active as kylin he's got his own own pace to life kylin runs everywhere yeah that boy has so much energy and God has made each one of them special and each one of them want to be recognized and accepted and approved of for who they are that's right not for what they do wrong we're not saying we approve of sin or we approve of that but the way that God has made them that they're accepted for that personality and even we in our own Journey we we know God's not going to prove sin but we want to know that God loves us for who we are for who he's made us to be for who he's designed us to be it's a time when we're going through so much education we're learning so many different things you know the three Rs Reading Writing arithmetic they're getting all this thrown at them and they're learning so much about life and the way the world Works Proverbs Chapter 1 and verse 8 my son hear the instructions of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother 1 John chap 5 and verse 14 and this is the confidence that we have in him if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him Jeremiah 33 and verse3 call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee Great and Mighty things which thou knowest not we know that God has the answer to every question that we come up with anything that we don't understand or unsure of God already knows and so we can come to him with our questions we can come to him with our concerns we can come to him with our problems and he's not going to get annoyed when we keep asking why why like most of us Earthly parents will eventually he's not going to get mad because we keep going well why this or why that unless you're coming at him and you're asking in some sort of accusing manner like he did something wrong but if you're just going Lord I just want to know what why now he may not answer every time but he's not going to get upset that you're asking we go through this age of instruction where he's teaching us and he's showing us and we know that God accept accepts us because he made us he made your personality he made you to be the person that you are to have the kind of relationship with him that you have he didn't create every single one of one of us to be the most amazing prayer Warrior that can spend hours on our knees we should all be striving for that I understand but we didn't some have it a whole lot easier than others it's just natural it just I'm not one I have to work at a lot harder God didn't make every one of us to have an amazing voice God didn't make every one of us to have all kinds of musical talents God didn't make every one of us to be in Ministry God didn't make every one of us to do this or do that but he created each one of us in a special way and he created each one of us with special gifts and special callings in our lives he created each one of us to accomplish certain things and he created each one of us just the way that he wanted us to be Romans chapter 15 and verse 7 wherefore receive ye one another as Christ also received us to the glory of God and another translation instead of receive it says accept accept ye one another as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God Isaiah 43 and verse 1 but now thus sayith the Lord that createth thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I I have called thee by name Thou Art mine we go through as children they grow through and they go through the early school years and they go up into the Preen years I've got over there that is just champing at the bit to be a teenager he's almost there it's coming up he's about to be 13 but he's in that pre-teen he's just he so much wants to step into it because he sees it in his mind it's a step out of childhood I'm not a kid I'm a teenager I don't think he quite understands he's got six years to go at that point still get out a teenager you know he's got six years of teenager to go but yet it's a stepping stone I've I've come out of being just a kid just a child I am now moving into it and so he sits in this pre-teen and he's going through the time where we're beginning to give him a little more responsibility begin to give him a a few more tasks that he has to get done or a few more things that are expected of him because he's he's moving towards it and so this is his chance to prove himself to show that he can handle some responsibility you know I've got charity over here that falls in the the school age group and she can hand a little bit of responsibility Paul PA is a little bit older and so we expect him to be able to handle more we expect him to be able to step out and right now he's going through the test and go okay can he actually handle it can he handle some of this responsibility can he handle these tasks without continually being reminded to do it can he do the task with Excellence so that he's doing the job well that he's getting everything done the way that it should be and with that testing and responsibility there comes some correction as he's learning as he's growing he's making mistakes and sometimes they're honest mistakes that just go okay next time do it this way and sometimes there's Disobedience that you have to deal with you get to see a little bit of both going with it as he has that chance of responsibility there's also the chance to abuse it more when there are a lot of rules and guidelines they can't go too far as you begin to loosen that and give them some more freedom more things can go wrong 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse three for our exhortation was not of Deceit nor of uncleanliness and Gile but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but God which trith our hearts God tries our hearts he gives us tests to see how we can handle it sure he'll allow us to go out a little bit farther and see are we ready to to handle that responsibility are we ready to handle this Authority sir brother brandham says in the sermon and when their eyes were open they knew him he says if you can't stand the chastisement of God then you're illegitimate and not a child of God you claim God as your father and you say oh I can't believe well that just shows that God is not your father see you you would get it now notice this testing God tests every one of his children all that come to him must first be tested tried proved Luke 16 starting at verse 10 he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous manmon who will commit to you your trust the true riches and if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's who shall give you that which is your own Romans chapter 14 and verse2 so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God Ecclesiastes 12 and verse 13 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil and Deuteronomy chap 24 and: 16 the father shall not be put to death for the children neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers every man shall be put to death for his own sin God tests us and he tests us on our own I don't have to answer for brother Colby brother kby doesn't have to answer for me if I mess up God's not holding him responsible for it the same way if I'm parenting correctly then if Paul messes up I'm not going to hold charity responsible for it now I will be the first one to say there are times when some of my younger children are acting wild and when we give punishment sometimes Luke gets lumped into it and Luke knows this is true we've had to apologize before but there are times we just go all right all the children this is what's happening and Luke's like what did I do God doesn't do that that's an Earthly parent mistake God doesn't do that he doesn't wrap us all up and go man you know what because sister Sharon messed up the whole church is going to suffer that's the way it works each one of us is going to answer for our own actions each one of us is responsible for our own mistakes each one of us has to confest to God for our our own situations and then ask for forgiveness ask for instruction ask for overcoming power so that we don't continue to fall in the same places as they move into the teenage years they begin to have the introduction to adulthood you know I can rely on Luke in a lot of ways there are a lot of things that I can give him a lot of trust and a lot of leeway because he's proven himself and he's begun to show a level of maturity that he can handle certain things he's not all the way there yet we're still working on it but there are a lot of things that I know I can trust him beyond what I can his siblings and it's not because Paul and charity are failures are anyway it's because they're younger they haven't gone as far along the journey they haven't had the opportunity to learn as much to experience as much and so I can't expect them to be at the same level but with Luke I can give him some more privileges knowing that he's not going to abuse them or go too far with him I can give him added responsibility but it also means that when there's an issue there's probably additional punishments that go along with him because I've given him him more opportunities and more chances and more trust and as we're growing with the Lord we have the same thing where God continues to give you a little bit more and a little bit more and okay you were good with the little I gave you so I'm going to give you a little bit more and that could be in the natural but it could very much be in the spiritual you've been good with this portion of your gift you've been good with this portion I'm going to open up a little bit more to you I'm going to give you a little bit greater blessing I'm going to give you a little bit more Revelation a little bit more understanding a little bit more take your pick of what you want to put on there it doesn't always mean that we're going to have the finances raining down and suddenly my bank account's growing but God's going hey you you handled this well so I can trust you with a little bit more I can trust you a little bit more in this are I can give you a little more bit more responsibility with this because you've proven yourself you've demonstrated a maturity you've demonstrated a relationship and ultimately we begin to move to the point that brother brandham ministered about where when they talk about adoption Galatians chapter 4 beginning at verse one now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of God through Christ in the sermon hidden life brother brandom says now when this boy became of age and when he was ready then for his adoption and he had proved by the tutor had told the father that this boy was eligible for adoption he was taken out into a public place and there he was robed an honor robe perhaps purple or some color of royalty and was set up in the whole city all the people around about seeing the father adopt his own son into the family and then when he was adopted into the family already a son already a child already an heir of Grace but placed in the family you get it now when he was placed in the family and given his position then the boy's name on a check was just as good as his father's name on the check in adoption number four brother brandom says and a man that's dead in Christ you can call him hypocrite call him anything you want to he'll never rise up about it if anything he'll slip off somewhere and pray for you that's right but oh some of them is very much alive that's what I think about we're supposed to bury dead people them that's dead in Christ we bury in water sometimes we bury too many people that's alive too much malice and strife and there's too much in the church but we can't separate that but God does he knows his people he knows his sheep he knows every voice he knows his children he knows who he can call out out he knows who he's predestinated he knows who he's given these things to what he's making himself known through God can put confidence in his children on what to do knowing that they will do exactly and in adoption number two he says now when the father in the Old Testament understood that his son was come of age and had been seasoned out unto adoption unto they're born a child but they're a son right then but then they'll never be more no more than just a child just an ordinary son until they mature and show what they are then he calls them out then now here we are church are you ready now it's a little bit late everybody bite your finger pinch your soul pluck your heart just for a minute see now we're going to place the church now when the church gets to that place he says Manasses you belong over here Ephraim you over here then he takes him out to a certain place the father does and he sets him upon a high place like this and he has a ceremony and they all come around and he says I want everyone to know that this is my child and I adopt my my son and I want anyone to know from hence forth that his name I dress him up a special dress on him and I want you to know that his name is just as good on any check as my name is he's my child I adopt him into my family although he's been my son since he was born since he received the Holy Ghost he's been my son but now I'm going to place him positionally in Authority what he fires is fired what he hires is hired and verily verily I say unto you if you say to this tree if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you've said will come to pass you can have what you said see there you are there you are see he's my son how many knows that the adoption that they adopted the son after he had proved to be everybody that read the Bible placing of a son we go through all of this growth we go through all these different stages and what's interesting when you look at it from the natural it's fully a progression once they're at this stage they don't go back to the toddler stage they don't go back to the baby stage but in our spiritual walk we sometimes do bounce around a little bit and at the same time in some ways even in the natural we do in Mother's Day service brother Wendell was talking about how he likes to go back to his mom and sometimes he just goes like I just need to put my head on a shoulder I need to cry a little a little bit need to and all of us have those different points where there are times even when our older children they just need our full focus and full attention they don't want responsibility right at that moment they just need some love they need Mama's hug they need this they need that and there are times as we're going through our own spiritual walk where we go back and like Lord I'm a baby again I don't know what I need but Lord I just need you to do something I need you to move in some way I should be old enough to be able to explain what I need but I can't cuz I don't know I can't explain it I don't have the words but Lord you know and we go back and forth and I know that we've got my pre-teen that has a little more of his Surly days right now CU that's the stage he's going through but when he goes through the day or the moment where he actually wants a hug from Mom mom loves that I expect most of the mom moms probably feel that way of hey if the child that doesn't really want hugs for a little while comes back and goes okay now I'll take a hug today it's a good moment there are times when he's willing to let dad put his arm around him there a lot of other times where he doesn't want me to touch him you have these different stages that that happen with the children in the natural but at the same time in the spiritual will go through some of these same back and forth and yes there's a progression we grow we develop and God is able to entrust us but there are times when we'll fall back and go Lord I just need full focus and attention right now Lord I just need some love I just need some sustenance I just need this that of the other when Christ is speaking and says suffer the little children come to me I don't think he put an age cap on this I don't think he was sitting there going all right if you're over 18 you're not in this list but it was the same thing where suffer little children it's very easy when we just think about it and imagine our mind it's all about oh let's have the cute little kids come up let's do this this do that and I'm not saying they shouldn't come they're still part of this absolutely but every one of us is a child of God every one of us has been called by him and he's calling us up to the point where we can reach that stage of adoption that's right my oldest Luke he's the closest I got he's not there yet he is not to the point where I'm gonna hand him my credit card and my checkbook and go I can trust you to make wise decisions now brother Austin over there is a lot closer to it I'd have to let sister key speak into how close he is you can discuss with her after church if you want to but he is closer to that point than Luke is and each one of us is at our different points in the journey each one of us is at our different points to have that full adoption to where we can have that full Authority yeah it doesn't change saying we're still a child we're still a child of God we're still a son or daughter of God the whole way through but the adoption is that final recognition to go he is thinking the same thoughts as me his decisions are the same type of decisions that I would make I can trust him to go out and what he does I'm not going to come behind and go oh he shouldn't have done that I'm not going to come back and rehire the guy that he fired I'm not going to go fire the guy that he just hired he's going to be making the same kind of decisions that I would have made and God calls us and instructs us and loves us and develops us and grows us you know when you go to the scripture there he talked about that in Psalms that children are arrows blessed is the man whose quiver is full and all this I know there are at least a few bow hunters in here I've never hunted with a bow I've shot traditional archery a decent amount never good enough that I thought I could actually take something but just go out and shoot at Targets has been great but it's interesting if you're looking at the traditional type archery which is going to be your long bow or recurve bow it's not going to be the compound bows that everybody knows right now the closer you draw it to yourself you are closer to the moment of releasing it so you keep as God's preparing to release his arrows we're drawing closer and closer to him as parents when we're raising our children before we release them into World we're drawing them closer and closer to us they're drawing closer and closer to our hearts drawing closer and closer to what we've been teaching them and raising them and the same thing is happening with God before he can release us we have to be drawn as close as possible and with traditional archery which is the kind of bow he would have been talking about in this the closer you draw it the harder it is to hold because you don't have these fancy gears that suddenly release and you okay I can hold this now because it just released the 20 pounds of weight or 30 pounds of weight with traditional you're holding it the entire way so if you have a a bow that's supposed to be a draw 52 PBS when you draw it back you hit 52 it sits at 52 there is no great it released and now you're down to 20 and it's easy to hold you are holding it at 52 lbs the entire time you have it drawn so it's very hard to hold in place when it's that close the closer you get to pulling it back the harder it is to hold and the more likely you are to release it sooner with the compound bow you can pull it back and you can stand there and hold it for Caleb how long could you hold your compound bow back long time because it releases is off a lot of the pressure for you when we drawback in the natural as parents it's harder to hold your children in cuz now they're ready to go into the world they're ready to get out and take on the world around them they're ready to get out there and get their job build a career find a spouse do do all these kind of things they are ready to leave the home the blessing is that in the spiritual our God is strong enough to hold us as long as it takes that may be getting harder and harder when it comes back but he's not straining he's not getting all red in the face because it's so hard to hold us but he knows you have to get up close enough to him before he's ready to release you that's right and the closer you can get to him the more powerful the launch is there's a thing in traditional archery called overdrawing you can overdraw your bow so it's designed if you have I'm going to use the 52 lb because that's the kind of recurve I have at 52 lbs if I'm at this many inches drawn it's at 52 lb if I can overdraw and I have a cousin that does traditional archery that he will overdraw instead of drawing to just the tip of his mouth he will pull back to his ear by overdrawing he can add a few more pounds of force so that even though the bow maybe said says that it'll do 52 lbs he overdraws and now he has it set at 56 lbs or 58 PBS or 60 PBS or whatever because he has gone beyond what the manufacturer rating at it was the further you draw back the closer you pull that towards the Archer the stronger the Flight of the air will be the more force that we'll have and the arrow is not of control of where it goes so when God is the great warrior that is the Archer he is fully aiming where we're going in life he is pointing us to it as he draws us closer to him and as we're becoming more and more like him and we're hitting that point of adoption to where we're thinking the same thoughts we're having the same actions he's the one who sets the target for us he's the one who aims where we're going the arrow doesn't make the decisions on its own we go through these different stages and I know these aren't all there in no way is these perfect types there's so many more things you could go into but I hope you're at least kind of getting where I was thinking and where I was coming from on it as Jesus is sitting there and he's going suffer the little children to come I don't think he's just talking about the babes and toddlers he's calling every single one of us and then as we go through our spiritual Walk we're going through these different stages we're going through these different parts of our relationship and then the best part about it to me is that we never lose what was in the last stage as long as I'm his child I never lose the need to be loved I never lose the need to be sustained I need God to feed me every day I need to be able to to feed off his word every day I don't outgrow it to where okay great I can go now Supply everything of myself those needs from the early stages are still there I still want his attention I still want to reach out sometimes and grab his face and make sure it's turned towards me so he's looking directly in my eyes and so I'm looking directly in his eyes I want to be at the point where I I've been through the tests and so I know that God can trust me with this responsibility and with this Authority we want to be at the point where we can be like job where God can go to Satan and go hey have you cons considered job at the same time we don't want to be like that if we look at it from the natural none of us want to go through what job went through but at the same time we want that much trust we want God to be able to look at us and go have you considered my children down in Oklahoma have you considered my children at New Life Outreach I know that they can handle the authority I know that they can handle this responsibility I know that they can handle these situations that you may throw at them because I've taught them I've raised them I've answered their questions I've supplied their needs I've pointed them in the right direction I've done everything that the good father should do and now we're getting to the point where I can look at them and go they're going to make the exact same decision I would make they're going to do the same thing that without me even telling them they know what I would want them to do they know my desires they know my will they have matured they have hit the point where now I can fully adopt them and bring them into the family cuz they are completely mine they're going to strike the Target that I want them to strike they're going to end up exactly where I want them to and they are going to take out the enemy that I want them to take out as the musicians come in the sermon how can I overcome How will I know then brother brandom that I'm in there watch what kind of life you're living just look around see if it's just lived out of you automatically or do you have to strain and pull see then you're doing it but don't try to do it did you ever try yeah don't just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve hole you see he just up down over everything else see he can't do it put on your coat honey he can't do it little arm is up down around it takes your Steady Hand oh how glad I am I can just yield my hand to my father say Lord Jesus I can't get in there you help me put the coat on I quit trying just let him do it see if the little baby keeps trying oh I can do it I can do it he's just everywhere he can't do it neither can you neither can I but if we'll just hold still and let him do it just yield to him here Lord here I am just let me be nothing I yield you put my hand in the right place that's the victory that's overcoming the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcame for you he knows the way we don't each one of us is at different stages in our spiritual journey each one of us is at different point maybe some are still in the newborn baby stage maybe some are still in the toddler stage maybe there are a few that are in that teenage stage that they're so close to adoption that they are getting more and more responsibility they are showing themselves more and more capable and I'm sure they're we're moving towards that state of complete adoption to where we are thinking the same thoughts we are doing the same things we are doing and living out the will that God has for us every one of us is God's child every one of us can fall into the suffer the little children to [Music] come God created us he loves his creation he made each one of us special he made each one of us individual he made each one of us with a purpose from the youngest to the oldest each one of us has a reason for being each one of us has things that God intends for us to accomplish they may not be anything that would ever be written down in a book anywhere they may not be anything that would get our Nam in's lights but he doesn't create waste he doesn't have children that they're just kind of extra off to the side who knows whatever every one of us God has a purpose every one of us God has the things that and brother brandom said time and time again until your purpose is fulfilled Satan can't take you if you still have something that you are supposed to do Satan can't touch your life he may give you sickness he may do all kinds of things but if God still intends for you to accomplish something if there's still another person you're supposed to talk to is there still another prayer you're supposed to utter if there's still another kind word you're supposed to speak then you're still here God doesn't release the arrow until it's time for it to fly he never releases early he never slips his finger doesn't just slip off the [Music] string each one of us is here with a purpose and whatever stage in the journey we may be the center of that journey is Christ the center of that journey is our Lord is our father that is instructing us that isn't teaching us there is nothing shameful about being at the newborn baby stage there is nothing shameful about being at the toddler stage it's just the stage of the journey that you're in but God is calling each one of us he is instructing each one of us he is teaching us and showing us the way for every single one of his children from the youth to the elders every single one of us he is continuing to instruct he is in continuing to minister to I think that should give us [Music] a really good feeling to know that God has us whatever stage we're in whatever step we're not comparing ourselves to each other we're not like at least we shouldn't be like the natural kids where my little girl charity will all the time go how come Luke gets to do this why does Luke get to do that well cuz he's 15 and you're nine there's a difference here there's a difference in what can be done God isn't comparing you to the person sitting beside you he isn't comparing you to the person on the other side of the church he is looking at you and going this is where you're supposed to be in the stage of the journey I've taught you up to this point you've got the this much further to go maybe it's a short period maybe it's a long period but God has you where he is and he's going to slowly keep drawing you back to himself he's going to slowly keep pulling you closer and closer to his heart we can feel safe in that we can feel stable in that even the times we mess up there have been times especially since Luke has started working when I have talked to him after a shift at Chick-fil-A and he is all frustrated because he messed up somewhere and he made a mistake and he'll tell me about it and most of the time I'm like if that's the worst you did you did pretty good today [Music] but I can go to him and I can tell him hey you're doing well hey these are the things that you're doing correctly maybe you messed up there so let's do better next time I can encourage him I can correct him I can help him to grow I can help him to develop and God's doing the same thing with every single one of us we mess up and sometimes he still has to spank Us and other times he picks us up out of the dirt he brushes us off and he goes try [Music] again he will do what we need in the journey he is not a forgetful father he is not a father that's going to cast us to the side he is with us every step of the [Music] way and even when we mess up so bad in our head we're going how in the world could I ever recover from [Music] this God's still sitting there going I knew that was coming now let me show you how we're going to keep moving forward let me show you what you need to learn from this let me give you the correction you need let me give you the love that you [Music] need God corrects us and then he will also bring us right back into his arms of love to let us know that he still cares about us no matter how bad we may have done he is still the loving father he is still the corrective father but he is still the father that will run to the Sun that went off and finally came back he is still the father that will run to us he is still the father that will Embrace us he is still the father that will teach us that will love us every step of the way Lord [Music] Jesus Lord I hope that I said what you wanted me to say Lord this was what was on my heart this is what I had looked at and Lord I pray that this would just be an encouragement to everyone here sometimes we just need to be reminded that we are God's children and God's got it in control and that that he is still the ultimate father he is still the one that can teach us everything he is still still the one that can show us everything he is still the one that can handle every situation that comes [Music] along Lord I pray that you would help each one of us just to to draw closer to you Lord that you would help each one of us to surrender to you more Lord as brother random said in that last quote I read Lord that the way we overcome is by surrendering more by no longer struggling but giving it all to you Lord help us to to surrender just a little bit more help us to to draw a little bit closer Lord Jesus Lord I Thank you for the people I thank you for them listening so attentively Lord and Lord I pray that you would just bless them in a special way tonight and through the coming week Lord bless the children Lord bless the adults bless the elders Lord [Music] Lord help us just to to love you and give you the attention and the focus that you deserve Lord Lord accept a a little more worship from us before we go Lord and may you be with us through the remainder of the evening Lord we just commit everything into your hands the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen what we
