[41:34] entered into capernium
[41:37] um after some days and it was noise that
[41:40] he was in the house and straight way
[41:44] many were gathered together in so much
[41:46] that there was no room to receive them
[41:48] no not so much as about the door and he
[41:53] preached the word unto them and they
[41:55] came unto him bringing one sick of the
[41:58] py which was born a four and when they
[42:01] could not come nigh unto him for the
[42:04] Press they uncovered the roof where he
[42:06] was and when they had broken it up they
[42:09] let down the bed wherein the sick of the
[42:11] pausy lay and when Jesus saw their faith
[42:16] he said unto the sick of pausy son thy
[42:21] sins are forgiven thee can you say
[42:26] Amen I'd also like to read here in the
[42:28] book of Philippians the 3D chapter amen
[42:32] and this is a familiar passage of
[42:34] scripture but here in in Philippians 3
[42:37] and

[42:42] either were already perfect but I follow
[42:46] after amen now that word follow should
[42:49] be Chase I chase after if that I may
[42:54] apprehend or arrest that for which
[42:57] I am apprehended of Christ Jesus

[43:06] and reaching forth under those things

[48:14] require a
[48:17] press and um amen now as we read there
[48:21] in the scripture amen where they could
[48:24] not come nigh unto him because of the
[48:26] press
[48:27] now that word press is it's it's uh it
[48:30] it it has to do with large crowds or a
[48:33] multitude or throngs but amen uh uh they
[48:38] they couldn't get to him amen the woman
[48:40] with the issue of blood couldn't had a
[48:42] hard time getting to Jesus because of
[48:45] the press there in other words there was
[48:47] a a lot of people that were there amen
[48:51] uh a a great crowd that was there Amen
[48:55] to uh for for different reasons maybe
[48:58] they were there to criticize maybe there
[49:00] they were there to to see Miracles maybe
[49:02] they were there to amen uh uh to listen
[49:05] to his Doctrine maybe amen there were
[49:08] Pharisees in the in the midst there were
[49:10] Sadducees there there were a lot of
[49:12] reasons for people to be there but there
[49:17] was something about these men they had a
[49:20] specific need they had a specific
[49:23] Challenge and they had to come into to
[49:27] the presence of Jesus now amen I it was
[49:31] not good enough for them to just be in
[49:33] his presence it wasn't just good enough
[49:36] to say that I amen I've come and I've
[49:39] been in church or I amen I I I I've I've
[49:43] paid my duties on a Wednesday night and
[49:45] amen I I but I want to get the attention

[50:03] audience they amen so much so that they
[50:06] could not even get in they couldn't get
[50:08] through the windows couldn't get through
[50:09] the doors so their desire was to get to
[50:12] Jesus and nothing was going to hold them
[50:16] back until they came into the presence
[50:19] of the Lord oh hallelujah amen I say
[50:22] tonight some of the best services that

[51:25] once you get his attention he will give
[51:27] you the desires of your heart amen oh

[51:52] but God I need something from you I need
[51:57] something from you can you say amen amen
[52:00] when I get here amen I want to know it
[52:03] reminds me that amen of the story that
[52:06] we've heard many times about the you
[52:08] know when the King was coming and amen
[52:10] going through England and they were
[52:11] having uh the little procession and and
[52:14] and all the schools had let out and amen
[52:17] and and and the and the teachers had
[52:19] given the the the children little flags
[52:21] and so when the when the uh the the king
[52:24] came by amen they could wave their flag
[52:27] at him and and it was quite a patriotic
[52:29] time but amen after the procession was
[52:32] over the teacher was counting her class
[52:34] and and and noticed that she had missed
[52:36] a little girl and and and when she
[52:38] couldn't find her she she retraced her
[52:41] steps and and went back to the to the
[52:43] street where the prade was at and and
[52:45] there she was leaning up against a pole
[52:48] and oh and she was crying her little
[52:49] lies out amen she was just a weeping and
[52:52] and and the teacher says honey what is
[52:54] wrong and amen did you not get to see
[52:57] the the the the king and she says yes I
[53:00] saw the king amen and she she says well
[53:03] did you did you did you raise your flag
[53:05] and she said yes I waved my flag she
[53:09] said then why are you crying she says I
[53:12] was too little the king did not get to
[53:14] see me amen I want to tell you tonight
[53:18] there is no one too little but what God
[53:21] can know who you are here tonight he
[53:23] knows every little boy he knows every
[53:26] little girl he knows every Grandpa and
[53:28] Grandma he knows every mama he sees a
[53:32] Hungry Heart friend I say tonight if
[53:34] there's something we need more than
[53:36] anything else as a desire not to just be
[53:41] in his presence but to amen get his
[53:44] attention can you say amen amen you may
[53:48] be little this morning but or this
[53:49] evening but God loves you and God sees
[53:53] you and God has the power within himself

[54:19] have our
[54:20] request amen well praise the Lord now
[54:24] many people follow amen for many
[54:26] different reasons they amen mixed
[54:28] multitudes and some are critics and some
[54:31] are fault finders and some are curious
[54:33] and amen and the multitudes were
[54:35] innumerable but there were some who had
[54:39] to touch the thr of God there was
[54:43] somebody that had to touch the golden
[54:46] cup of the Lord Jesus Christ and every
[54:50] time God met their
[54:54] need oh praise the Lord
[54:57] amen are you hearing me here tonight

[55:06] righteousness and all these other things
[55:08] will be added to me so if I seek him
[55:11] then I know he will see me amen the
[55:15] Press is to move it means to move into a
[55:18] position of contact with something by
[55:21] exerting continuous physical force it
[55:24] means to exert amen to run swiftly in
[55:28] order to catch a person or thing to run
[55:31] after to press on figuratively of one
[55:34] who who is in a race and run swiftly to
[55:37] reach the goal to pursue in a hostile
[55:40] Manner and that's why the Apostle Paul

[1:26:32] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:26:34] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of

[1:35:43] forth in a brand new
[1:35:48] body struggle
[1:35:52] yep is it worth the struggle
[1:36:00] yep there's something predestinated on
[1:36:03] the inside of
[1:36:05] you you can no more fail than God can
[1:36:11] fail can I remind
[1:36:15] you what God said about
[1:36:21] you it it or what your
[1:36:27] Beginnings remember what your Beginnings
[1:36:29] were before this o this o
[1:36:35] shell he says in the beginning when God
[1:36:37] made man he made him Superior to
[1:36:39] anything on the earth he gave him
[1:36:41] jurisdiction over everything on the
[1:36:43] earth to control everything he
[1:36:44] controlled the animal life he controlled
[1:36:46] the foul life the fishes the sea
[1:36:48] controlled the winds he controlled the
[1:36:49] plant life he controlled everything man
[1:36:51] was made as a secondary God on Earth
[1:36:53] Earth he was given the power to control
[1:36:55] all things all the elements of the earth
[1:36:57] that was
[1:36:58] Adam that was given these Powers these
[1:37:02] great Powers but he says the power to
[1:37:05] create
[1:37:06] himself is where he
[1:37:09] fell Adam could speak to the winds and
[1:37:11] to stop it he could speak to the trees
[1:37:13] and they would obey him he could speak
[1:37:14] to the wildlife and they obeyed him he
[1:37:16] could speak to the waters what it was
[1:37:18] everything obeyed him that's the
[1:37:19] beginning of man that's what God gave
[1:37:21] him power over everything on the Earth
[1:37:24] and though he and through the fall he
[1:37:26] lost the power he become unconscious of
[1:37:28] the fact after losing his relationship
[1:37:30] and friendship and fellowship of the
[1:37:31] father he lost all that and his great
[1:37:34] channels come clogged up and he couldn't
[1:37:37] get through and what Adam was in God
[1:37:40] Christ has come to redeem us back now
[1:37:42] we're a redeemer to redeem anything is
[1:37:43] to take us back to the original again
[1:37:45] Adam never had to be sick Adam never had
[1:37:48] to die he never had a worry he never had
[1:37:51] a heartache he never had a fear he just
[1:37:53] climbed up in the arms of the father
[1:37:55] just like a child and everything was his
[1:37:56] and whatever he asked till he got it
[1:37:58] everything obeyed him because he was
[1:38:00] God's child the child is a of all things
[1:38:03] and when he fell he lost this now what
[1:38:06] what he lost in the fall Christ come as
[1:38:08] a redeemer did you stop to think what
[1:38:10] Christ redeemed us for to give us
[1:38:12] eternal life he brought us back to the
[1:38:14] Eternal Fellowship relationship to God
[1:38:17] to be sons and daughters again to
[1:38:18] restore back all that Adam lost in the
[1:38:20] fall he says now the thing of it is
[1:38:23] since he has restored man back to this
[1:38:25] place man in the fall has lost his
[1:38:27] conscience of what God or the father put
[1:38:29] him here on this Earth to do in other
[1:38:31] words all the plumbing as it we in our
[1:38:32] brain and the outlets and the faith is
[1:38:34] all clogged up with business Affair and
[1:38:35] home life and domestic things it's all
[1:38:38] so clogged up clogged up that until God
[1:38:40] can't operate through those channels
[1:38:41] that he made man for when God made the
[1:38:43] body human body every part of it had its
[1:38:45] place to play the teeth the tongue the
[1:38:47] eyes the nose God does everything in
[1:38:49] there to make it perfect in operation to
[1:38:51] make man to live and if God so patterned
[1:38:53] the man the body of Christ how much more
[1:38:55] has he patterned and set the body of
[1:38:57] Christ the church can you say Amen do
[1:39:02] you understand what the prophet is
[1:39:03] saying he's saying remember your
[1:39:05] Beginnings remember what you are
[1:39:07] remember and you've got to push past the
[1:39:11] business life will fail will will clog
[1:39:13] up it becomes a shell you become lost
[1:39:15] trapped inside this shell that shell is
[1:39:18] not to Define you that shell is never to
[1:39:21] tell you who you are that shell is not
[1:39:24] what you are that shell is holding
[1:39:27] you the shell Satan has put around you
[1:39:30] through the
[1:39:32] fall but that shell isn't you that shell
[1:39:36] is holding you back from that other
[1:39:37] world and I say tonight through the
[1:39:40] blood of Jesus Christ we have that power
[1:39:43] Amen to rise past this amen rise out of
[1:39:46] this body through the holy goost and go
[1:39:48] into that other realm you might not see
[1:39:51] Christ you might not you might not hear
[1:39:53] an angel but you can reach out and touch
[1:39:56] Christ with your
[1:39:59] faith can you say
[1:40:02] amen
[1:40:04] amen is it worth the
[1:40:07] Press well that's who you
[1:40:10] are it's who you are that's creating the
[1:40:13] Press preacher can't give it to
[1:40:16] you mama can't give it to
[1:40:20] you Elana and I were talking today
[1:40:23] there's no person that can give give the
[1:40:27] desire God puts
[1:40:30] that when you come in contact with
[1:40:33] him
[1:40:35] amen so many times we want everyone else
[1:40:38] to satisfy us and we that's why we go
[1:40:41] from church to church and we go from
[1:40:43] place to place and we're mad at this one
[1:40:45] and we we think oh if I if I get out of
[1:40:48] this situation over here amen and then
[1:40:51] that turns sour and then this turns sour
[1:40:53] everything's all turn you know why the
[1:40:55] common ingredient is is you show up
[1:40:58] every place you
[1:41:02] go and if you are not happy here there's
[1:41:06] nothing out external that can ever help
[1:41:11] you but Christ has come when you when he
[1:41:15] comes and germinates the seed on the
[1:41:17] inside there's where the peace
[1:41:20] comes then you learn learn to be content
[1:41:24] no matter what situation I he says I
[1:41:26] Apostle Paul says I I I I've learned to
[1:41:28] be full I've learned to be empty I've
[1:41:30] learned I I I've been in prison I've
[1:41:32] been free I I but I have learned
[1:41:35] whatsoever state I'm in therewith to be
[1:41:37] content it don't matter where what the
[1:41:39] circumstance is in this shell that I'm
[1:41:42] at I've got the seed of God that's been
[1:41:45] germinated on the inside that's the only
[1:41:48] thing that can give me
[1:41:50] peace happiness comes from from here
[1:41:54] Christ touching here there's where the
[1:41:56] happiness is and then if you you're in a
[1:42:00] jail cell the Apostle Paul says I
[1:42:03] rejoice in my
[1:42:05] infirmities whether you're it don't
[1:42:07] matter where you are then you're no
[1:42:09] longer comparing with yourself with
[1:42:12] somebody else saying ah I wish I had
[1:42:14] that family I wish I lived with I wish I
[1:42:17] had those parents or I wish I had this
[1:42:19] or I wish I had that church or if I had
[1:42:22] this position it has no nothing to do
[1:42:23] with that you are you are here because
[1:42:26] God placed you
[1:42:29] here and you're
[1:42:32] content because you have found your
[1:42:35] contentment in
[1:42:37] him you're
[1:42:39] happy what can you say man desire
[1:42:43] doesn't come from mama daddy preacher
[1:42:47] Prophet it comes from somebody coming in
[1:42:52] contact with Jesus

[1:42:58] longer a
[1:43:00] spectator you have become the
[1:43:03] participator something has happened in
[1:43:10] you oh if we could get people off the
[1:43:12] bleachers and into the
