been enjoying the the the teachings on the gifts um those those have been some wonderful uh things and we will continue as we go along because brother brandham is going to be dealing with the gifts um throughout the church age book but we're just going to to start here uh Revelations 2 and um amen um we'll start here at the 12th verse and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas my faithful martyr was slain among you where Satan dwelleth and we're just going to stop right there let let's go to the Lord in prayer today Father we want to thank you for your amazing love to us and how that you're you're you're so much bigger than than even what we could imagine Lord your love is so much greater and Lord You're the author of everything that is that is pure and holy and undefiled and father I'm asking that you would just be among us here tonight as we as we read in in the church age book and we're asking Lord that you would be with brother Michael and and Lord Weston and and and felma Lord and pray that you'll be real special with them Lord and to them and the family Lord as as uh they go through the week and father we just thank you and commit ourselves to your hands and ask Lord that you would help us Lord to always be very sensitive to you and to walk with you and com commune with you father that's our prayer keep us in your will forever in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen amen God bless you you may be seated here tonight amen we're going to start here at at page 170 and we're just going to go all the way down to the very the very last line and um um now this this here um the angel of the Lord had told Brother brandham to pick up his pen and so um he is going to uh uh write his pen as the as the Lord instructs him um and so the Lord had given this to him at in back in um uh I it was back in 1962 it's where the he he be is the first time that he had he had read it and then he also and that was in the U original the spoken word is the Original Seed and um and then he puts it in the church age book and there's there's going to be and I'm not going to dissect uh uh too much of it we have already went through some of this uh you're going to see some that we have read some of this the first two pages but I just want to read the whole the whole message that the angel of the lord gave him because he was this was at a at a very uh specific uh the turning point this was the third pool coming in and the prophet and the angel of the Lord Was preparing that Prophet for that and so uh the original the spoken words The Original Seed um you know it was um uh let's see it was I know it was in ' 62 I believe it was at the end of 62 it is is where I believe that was um and then of course the opening of the seals uh happened there I believe in March U 63 so um this was this was very pivotable uh pivotal and and so I just want us to to read this tonight um any questions just make sure you uh you know we're we're we're free and then and if you you know if you want you're free to speak and if you want to write it down do so and give it to me and uh we'll address that at another time uh or at the end of the service tonight all right it says so one night as I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as I grasp the pen to write his Spirit gave me a message for the church I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride here is what I am trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its kind according to Genesis 111 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and the herb you'll Ying seed and the fruit uh tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into Fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be a super Church a super race as she nears him now y'all remember what we've as we have been uh as I've taken a couple of services lately amen upon the upon the Capstone he's talking about that headstone coming down this is the adoption time this is the this is the time of of sunship that that the that that God has been waited that all of the church ages have been waiting on is when that Christ The Living Word would come down and cap the church not in a baptism of the Holy Ghost but where the Holy Ghost himself the logos the very life of that word coming down upon us this is the age where the pillar of fire which is the logos amen has returned to Earth to reveal the word no other age had that like this age amen this is the age of the opening of the book this is the age where God has literally opened the entire scheme of things and shown what is going on and so so this is not just another filling this is not just another amen tongues or interpretation this is the Holy Ghost himself this is the what brother Brandon would call the word coming of Christ so so keep that in your mind amen as we read it again and in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be a super Church a super race as she nears him and they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God oh bless the Lord denominations can't produce this it's the wrong seed they will produce their Creeds their dogmas and and mixed with the word and this mizing will bring forth a hybrid product the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God but she fell she fell by H hybridization and she caused him to Die the second son Jesus also a spoken words uh seed word of God was given a bride like as was Adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like Adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of God and live or doubt the word and die she doubted and she left the word she died from a little group of the true uh seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she she is a virgin because she knows no uh man-made Creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be manifest in the Virgin The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that word uh of Promise was he himself to be made manifest God made manifest now just I want you to watch the language the language and I and and and and sometimes I wonder um I just can't quite get it the way I I I I would I you know in in preaching the the this paragraph right here is what every preacher in the message is trying to get to the people to get them to understand what God is doing because we're not the Virgin Mary but we are the very bride of Jesus Christ and in this in this physical vessel here Christ is wanting to live his very life the supernatural brother bradam said we talked about angels here uh uh uh the you know last service the brother bradam says that the angels will be so common among the bride he says it'll be just like television he said just as television is amen and and and and how that that television I mean you can just you can talk to people all over the world Wireless He said angels will be that Glory that that kind of Glory will be upon the church in these last days amen it says the Word of Promise came to Virgin Mary a amen but that Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that brought her the message but the Angel's message was the word of God Isaiah 9:6 for and he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her the members of the Virgin bride will love him they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as members of our bodies are subject to our heads notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never done anything until he was first uh showed him by the Father John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the word will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose isn't that just beautiful those last few paragraphs are incredible amen because we are taking his words into our lives we're taking his words into the womb of our heart and there is nothing impossible when that Supernatural God comes and makes that word to live it says those in the bride do only his will no one else can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while his while in his Earth Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now Joshua means savior a Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul Come A came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua remember God had started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so the last day so did the last day Church notice how God did not move Israel uh or let her go into the promised land until it was his own appointed time now the people might have put pressure on Joshua the leader and said the land is ours let's go and take it Joshua you're all through we must have you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have you used to hear from God and and and know the will of God and act quickly something is wrong with you but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he he waited for them he waited for a clearcut decision from God when the time come to move God placed the leadership in Joshua's hands because he had stayed with the word God could trust Joshua but not the others so it will repeat in this last day the same problem the same pressures now once again I want us to go back when did the when did the Lord come and tell brother brandom to pick up the pen this was right before the third pool now you got to understand the full scope of things because all of these other ministers had already come up using the sign old Roberts was using he had a sign in his hand we had we had uh Allan and and oh my goodness we had dozens amen dozens of uh Faith healers that were out there and they and they were now starting to they were just a dime a dozen everywhere amen and they they had they had done so much gimmicky and pulling for money until they had brought a bad name to the to the healing movement altogether it had gotten to a point to where it was a money-making scheme and these guys were well amen and brother brandham was sort of caught right in it and here he's the prophet not not not that he was caught in in the uh you know in in the money schemes and all that it was just he was just thrown right in there uh uh with that amen but his purpose was not he was not sent to Earth for the healing of the sick he was not sent to the Earth for discernment he was sent to the Earth to pull out a bride and so so brother so the Angel's telling them now amen all of these guys are ready come on let's go let's let let's let's do something but brother bradam could do no more than what God had given him but yet he kept telling him the third pull now back in 56 is when God gave him the vision that there's going to be the first pull uh which would be you know the the the the sign in the hand and then there would be the uh the first pull the sign in the hand and then the second pull which is Discerning of the hearts but then the third pull would be a complete secret no one would know what what he was doing he would not be able to to tell and so the angel of the Lord is preparing brother brandham for for what is coming ahead amen so keep that in mind as as you're going amen it says so take the example we see in Moses this Mighty uh uh anoint and and and then let me just say this real quick they had started the attitudes of these guys had already started looking at brother brandham saying you know uh we can do what you do and it and it had already just gotten to where it was it was just a quagmire and and the people were were well if you read the history books they said brother brandham had the greatest gift of them all but brother Branham was not intelligent he wasn't smart enough to to do the big meetings or Roberts had had already built this great big Network and he had followers and big buildings and and brother Brandon was still in a he still had a little trailer with with a typerwriter in it and and and he just looked like he was gone he just looked like he was finished up uh we had all of these guys had had these big old kingdoms old Roberts was was was uh already building his his his kingdom over here in in Tulsa you understand so so everyone's looking at brother brandom as if man you're washed up and you had the greatest gift of them all all right so he says take the example that we see in Moses this Mighty anointed Prophet Had A peculiar birth being born at the right time for the Deliverance of of Abraham's seed for me Egypt he never stayed in Egypt to argue scripture with them nor fuss at priest he went to the Wilderness until the people were ready to receive him God Called Moses to the Wilderness and the waiting was not on Moses part but because the people who were not ready to receive him Moses thought the people would understand that they but they did not then there is Elijah to whom the word of the Lord came and when he got through preaching the truth that group back there that was uh that is the Forerunner of the American Jezebel group would not receive the word god called him off the field plagued that generation for rejecting the prophet and the message that God had given him God called him to the Wilderness and he would he would not come out even for the king those who tried to persuade him to do so died but God spoke to his faithful Prophet by Vision out of hiding he came and brought back the word uh the word to Israel then come John the Baptist Christ faithful Forerunner the mighty Prophet for his day he did not go to his father's School nor the school of the Pharisees he went to no denomination but out of the Wilderness called there by God and there he stayed until God sent him with the message crying the Messiah is at hand Now take us let us take a scriptural warning here was it not in the days of Moses whom God had Vindicated that Kora rose up and withstood that Mighty prophet he disputed with Moses and claimed that he had as much from God to lead the people and that others shared in the divine revelation as well as did Moses he denied the authority of Moses now the people back there after they heard the truth the true word and were well acquainted with the fact that a true Prophet was Vindicated of God I say those people fell for Cor and his gang says Kora was not a scriptural Prophet but the people in great numbers um see great numbers with their leaders went for him and like the Evangelist today with their golden calf schemes like Kora they they look good to the people as Kora looked good then they have blood on their foreheads oil in their hands balls of fire on the platform they allow women preachers that women cut their hair wear slacks and shorts and bypass the word of God for their Creeds and dogmas that shows what kind of seed is in them but not all the people turned on Moses and left the word of God no the elect stayed with him the same is happening again today many are leaving the word but some are staying with it but remember the parable of the wheat and tears tears have to be bundled for burning and the these apostate churches are getting bound closer and closer together ready for the fire of God's judgment but the wheat is going to be garnered gathered to the master now I I want to say to you uh or I want you to be very careful here and see this God has promised that in the last at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled it has to be for it is the spirit quickened word of God spoken by the prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it it is just before Christ comes the second time by the time Jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will be in its last Church age when that messenger of Malachi comes he will be right with the word he will take the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation he will start at the serpen seed and carry on to the um on to the messenger in the latter day but he will be rejected by the denominations he has to be for that is history repeating itself from the time of Ahab Israel's history under Ahab is happening right here in America where the prophet of Malachi appears as Israel left Egypt to Worship in Freedom and pushed out the natives and raised up a nation with great leaders like David Etc then put on Ahab uh put an Ahab on the throne with a jezebel behind him to direct so have we done the same thing in America our forefathers left for this land to worship and live in Freedom they pushed back the natives and they took over the land the mighty men like Washington and Lincoln were raised up but after A While others other men of such poor caliber succeeded these worthy men that soon and Ahab was set in the presidential chair with a jezebel uh behind him to direct him it is a as such a time as this that the messenger of Malachi must come then the latter reign will come uh with then in the latter reign will come a mount Showdown a Mount Carmel Showdown watch this carefully and now to see it in the word John was the Forerunner of Malachi 4 he planted the former Reign and was rejected by the organizations of his Day Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ will seow for the latter Reign Jesus will be the the uh the will be the showdown between the denominations and the Creeds for he will come back uh he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the Rapture the first Showdown was Mount Carmel second Showdown uh was Mount Transfiguration and the third will be Mount Zion the strange behavior of Moses Elijah and John withdrawing from the people into seclusion left many confused they did not realize that it was because their messages had been rejected but the seed had been sown the planting is over judgment was next they had served their purpose as a sign to the people so judgment was next I believe Accord according to Revelations 13-6 that the bride will have to stop preaching for the best for the Beast is demanding the mark in the hand and the forehead if permission uh if permission to preach be granted denominations will take the mark and be forced to quit preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and the judge and judge the great Harlot now remember that Moses was born for a certain work he could not do that work until he had received the gifts which would enable him to do the work he had to go into the desert and wait there God had appointed had an appointed time there was uh to be a certain Pharaoh on the throne and the people had to be crying for the bread of life before God could send him back and this is true for our day but what do we have in this our day multitudes of working signs until we have a generation of sign Seekers that know little or nothing about the word or a true move of the spirit of God if they see blood oil and fire they are happy it matters not what is in the word they will support any sign even unscriptural ones but God has warned us about that he said in Matthew 24 that in the last days the two Spirits would be so close together that only the very elect could tell them apart for they alone would not be deceived how can you tell the spirits apart just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of that evil one and the as the evil one was the evil one deceived the first two Brides he will try to deceive the Bride of these last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself through Creeds or just plainly turning from the word to any signs that sooths her but God has never placed signs head of the word signs follow the word as when Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord and when she did as the word said the proper sign came come to the word first then watch the miracle the seed word is energized by is is energized by the spirit How can any messenger sent from God believe only a part of the word and then deny some of it the true prophet of God in this last day will proclaim the whole word denominations will hate him his words may be as harsh as John the Baptist who called them vipers but the predestinated will hear it and be ready for the Rapture the Royal Seed of Abraham which like uh with like Faith as Abraham will hold to the to the word with him for they are predestinated together the last day Messenger will appear in God's appointed time it is the end time now as we all know for Israel is in her Homeland and any time now he will come according to Malachi when we see him he will be dedicated to the word he will be indicated pointed out in the word Revelations 10:7 and God will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as Elijah and be ready for the Mount Zion Showdown many will misunderstand him because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth and when he comes against that they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God's truth by deceivers but this Prophet will come and as the Forerunner to the first uh coming cried behold beh the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world even so will he no doubt cry out Behold the Lamb of God coming in glory he will do this for as John was the messenger of Truth to the elect so is this last Messenger to the elect and the word born Bride Can you say Amen so now this was this was given to to to brother brandham to speak um or to to write down and so there there was a lot uh in this in this so we had the Mount Carmel then we had the mount Transfiguration and then we had the Mount Zion amen the Rapture of the church now how does that rapture start the Rapture was in a three-phase in in in three three stages amen the Rapture is it comes with a shout with a voice and then the Trump of God and so the final thing will be the Trump of God that's when we are caught away amen and and we'll we'll meet the Lord in the air but right now amen he is sending that Prophet Messenger to come and pull us together gather us in Christ the word amen we're to meet in Christ the word and and so you you say well where where is that Mount Zion is that is that something that is is coming well the Apostle Paul there in the book of Hebrews and we can just turn there real quickly amen there's going to be a Mount Zion Showdown and and that is in U let's see Hebrews the 12th chapter amen and um uh we will we will look there at um uh let's just let's just start let's just start there at the 18th verse now um and he says for we are not come unto the mount that might be touched that burned with fire um nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and he's now this here he's talking about amen when God appeared unto Moses and he says now the sound of a trumpet and the word and the voice of Words which voice they that heard intreated that word should not be spoken to them anymore other words they said hey this is this let not God talk to us anymore it it it it makes us scared so then God came and said I will not talk to you lip to ear like I once done but I will send you a prophet to prepare you when I'm going to speak I will send you a prophet now that's what he told him and that's that's been God's voice ever since even even with us having the baptism of the Holy Ghost God still sends a prophet to us that give us the word of the day amen and he always sends a prophet at the junction of time this is an incredible Junction of time because this is the going home of the Bride so so now he's telling me now this is not as coming to that mountain anymore Amen in 20th verse for they could not endure that that which was commanded and if so much of a beast touched that mountain it was stoned or thrust through with a dart so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly Quake fear and Quake but ye are come unto Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just man made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things uh than that of Abel see that you refuse him not for if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on Earth how much more much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth Earth and now he hath promised saying yet once more I uh Shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of things that are shaking as of things that are made that things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is it consuming fire so so when so we are we understand that that the mount uh Zion Showdown is is Right Upon Us The Showdown has come in the spirit world and that and the fact that God came amen the the Rapture was in threefold it's three-fold so the word had to come back to earth headship had to come back to earth to prepare a bride this this woman amen is going to be bone of his bone word of his word faith of his faith she's going to believe that word and the power of the almighty God is going to be with her fulfilling his word in her amen and that when that when that Capstone comes upon this bride amen and making it that and making it a body there is nothing amen that is going to take that that could ever take the place of of what God is doing so so the the mount sun or or the the the Mount Zion Showdown is truly coming the headship has returned amen and he's going to call us home when he shall speak we shall answer now anybody anybody have any questions praise the Lord amen there was a lot of good reading there really a whole lot of good reading amen everyone understand amen hallelujah all right so um let's see what time is it it is 8:00 amen how many wants to read a little bit more let's let's go ahead and um let let's read another um let let's get to um let's read four more pages here all right um Christ eulogizes the church Revelations 2 and13 I Know Thy Works where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan's where Satan dwelleth I Know Thy works these are identical words uttered to each of the seven Messengers relative to the people of God in each age as they are spoken of the two Vines true and false they will bring joy and gladness to the hearts of one group but they of to strike Terror in the hearts of the other for though we are saved by grace apart from Works uh true salvation brings forth works or deeds that will please God 1 John 3:7 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth or worketh righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous in this verse uh if this verse means anything at all it means that what a man does he is amen and I think that's good for us all to remember and you young people remember that you should underline that it means what a man does he is so so if you you you you can identify you can identify what is in Your Heart by what you do amen if you're sneaking around doing things that are wrong well then don't don't claim to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the life of God that is on the inside and and as brother bradam says all right it's going to bring joy to one but it should bring Terror to the other and fear to the other that is amen that is not right with God so so if we've got the word of God we're hearing the word of God don't amand the word of God and then have works that are contrary to the word of God Amen your your Works declares what's on the inside of you amen what you allow what you think what is there amen now I I'm not I'm not saying that temp temption isn't isn't isn't always present Temptation and persecution is always going to be there but but but the life of God or the works of God on the inside of you will declare listen I am not going to to to feed that devil I am not going to allow Leo to see a devil to take me down I am being cut off this Rapture is cutting everything Earthly and sinful off of me so that I can be prepared for a Rapture yes amen because we are truly going to make a Rapture now and so the uh what what a man does is what a man is amen what we allow what we allow want you to understand that what we allow says a lot about our character amen so you you young men uh you you all keep that in in your heart as as you're walking I think that's a good that I think that's a good um thermometer to be able to see you can't see your soul and everyone everyone in in they love that God sees the heart that's what everyone says God sees the heart God knows my heart yeah amen and so do I you know you're a jezebel you're you're you're you're you're condoning sin you're allowing things amen your phone shows what what you what what you are at your heart your uh your friend show what you are in your heart right so so what we want to do is not be hypocritical about this it's just downright stupid God knows my heart amen that's what the whole world is saying God knows my heart yes he does and you're going to burn with the wicked if you don't line that heart up with the word of God hallelujah so so we want to line this life our hearts up and say God don't let me just sit in church and and live here hypocritically your holy spirit is in here in our church your Holy Spirit you've promised this age is full of life you have you have sent Angels you've sent those angels to be my head you've sent there's an anointing on the earth to cause your word to live live in me can you say Amen y'all understand amen so so it's as a man does he is James 3:11 does does the fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter Romans 6:2 how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein Matthew 12:33 to35 either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit oh Generation of Vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks and a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things now if a man is born of the word being born again not of the corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever 1 Peter 1 and 23 he will produce the word the fruit or works of his life will be a product of the kind of seed or life that is in him his Works therefore will be scriptural oh what an indictment this truth is going to be against the pergam Manan age there stands the matchless one in his hand the sharp sword with two edges the word of God that word will judge us in in the last day in fact the word is judging even now for it is the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart it cuts aund the carnal from the spiritual it makes us living Epistles read and known of all men to the glory of God I Know Thy works if a man fears that he might not please the Lord then let him fulfill the word let's read that again if a man fears that he might not please God let him fulfill the word if a man wonders if if he will hear those words well done good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of God in his life and assuredly he will hear those words of praise the word of Truth was the Christ here and then and it is the Criterion now there isn't another standard there isn't another Plum line as the world is going to be judged by one Christ Jesus even so it is going to be judged by the word word if a man wants to know how he is making out let him do as James suggests look into the mirror of God's word I Know Thy works as he stood there with the word examining their lives in the light of the blueprint he had laid out for them he must have been pleased in in a goodly measure for they like the others who had gone on before were enduring the persecution of the unjust and still joyfully clinging unto the Lord cleaving to the Lord difficult though it was at time to serve the Lord yet they served him and worshiped him in spirit and in truth with the false Vine it was not so at last they had repudiated the life that is built upon the word and were now going further and further away from the truth their actions bore witness to the depth to which they had sunk it says thy thou holds fast my my name to whom can we go thou alone Hast the words of eternal life they held fast then they were holding fast now but now but not with the Fantastic dread as men who lived out Barren lives they were holding fast in his strength in the Assurance of the spirit that they were one in him theirs was the sure knowledge of of the sins forgiven and they bore the name of Christian in testimony to it they knew and loved that name that was above every name their knees had bowed to that name their tongues had confessed to it whatever they said they did it all in the name of the Lord Jesus they had named that name and departed from Evil having taken their stand they were now prepared to die for that name and being assured of a better resurrection and then he goes to the song Take the name of Jesus with you child of sorrow and woe it will joy and comfort give you take it then wherever you go precious name oh how sweet hope of Earth and Joy Of Heaven already in the 2 century were those words Father Son and Holy Ghost um had spelled out Trinity to many and the uh poly eclesiastica polythetic idea of three Gods had become a Doctrine in the false Church it would not be long until that until the name was taken away and indeed it was in the age and then in it stad the titles of the one great God was would be substituted for the name Lord Jesus Christ uh while while the many apostasis and embraced a trinity and baptized using the titles of the godhead the little flock still B baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and so held to the truth with so many dishonoring God and turning him into three gods and changing his gracious name into titles one would wonder if the signs and wonders that attend that such a great name would still be visited among the people indeed those signs were mightily and wonderfully manifested though certainly not in the first Vine or the false Vine men like Martin were greatly used in God bore them witness both by signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost that name was still effectual as it will always or as it always has been and ever will be where the Saints honor him through the word and through faith amen let's go let's let's read down let's let's go down um um to the next page and then we'll we'll end now it says thou has not denied my faith now I love this this portion here um this is I I I just I love this in Acts 3:16 when Peter had showed how the mighty Miracle had taken place upon the crippled one at the gate beautiful he explained it on this wise and his Jesus name through faith in his Jesus name hath made this man the former crippled strong yay the faith which is by or from him Jesus hath given him the man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all see there it is Jesus name and Jesus Faith brought about the miracle Peter did not claim it was his own human Faith anymore than he claimed that it was his own name he said the name of Jesus used in the faith which which is from Jesus performed that great work this faith is what the Lord was speaking about in Revelations 2 and 13 it was his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the Believers is that beautiful he don't want now Christianity is not me having enough faith and getting enough Faith to believe in the Lord no the new birth brother Randon would say in in in other places he uh in there in um um I believe it was um that that day at Calvary he says the new the the the new birth is the act of faith that God done in you so you have been given the faith of God he places his faith in you by the new birth amen so God's not telling you to to believe with your human Faith believe in him he's doing the work through you he gives you his faith the same faith that raised up Lazarus the same faith that that healed blind bmus the same Faith the only thing is he says I do nothing except the father for show me he was sensitive and there is where where's where this hard generation is is lacking is the sensitivity because we got too many other things that can catch our attention but if we could get our eyes and we must get our eyes on Calvary in such a way that we sharpen our sensitivity because the bride will do nothing except they have thus saith the Lord amen oh to think that the works of God's going to be do it must be done through you and he doesn't require you to do it by your own faith he says I'm going to give you my faith amen amen it says so so uh he says this faith is what the Lord was speaking of in Revelations 2:13 it was his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the Believers Romans 12:3 according as God ha dealt to every man according to verse one the men are Brethren the measures of Faith e Ephesians 2 and8 by grace are ye saved through faith and that faith not of yourselves it is the gift of God it is all it also says James 2:1 my brethren notice he too is talking to Brethren have not the faith of not in have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons in this pergam manian age where men were humanizing uh the Salvation having turned from truth that salvation is from the Lord having cast aside the doctrine of election and and open wide the the church door their Fellowship to any and all who subscribe to their tenants never mind the word uh uh in in this age of Rapid degradation they were still the few who had the measure of that Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ and not only used that faith and acts of power but withstood those who dared to say that they were Sav simply on the grounds of joining a church Church they knew that no man could truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of God apart from The Measure of Faith of the Lord Jesus himself and today's church is filled with mental believers who endorse the Virgin birth the shed blood going to church taking communion and are not reborn at all even so in that third age was the same problem human Faith wasn't enough then and it is not enough now it takes the very faith of the Son of God to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made with hands this was a living faith I live by the faith of the Son of God Paul did not say that he lived by faith in the Son of God it was the faith of the Son of God that had given him life and kept him living in Christian Victory no they had not denied that salvation was Supernatural from the start to finish they kept alive the truth of his name of his faith and they were blessed by the Lord and counted worthy of him isn't that beautiful I love that amen I love that so so we we want to uh thank the Lord so it's not it's not a mental Faith amen it's not a believing unto amen and it's not believing but it there is truly a faith you're believing with the very faith that Jesus Christ had in himself what what what was the very first law of God God spoke and he believed his own word hallelujah hallelujah and the bride amen should believe this word in such a way that when we speak what he has spoke for this generation we can have all faith knowing that it shall come to pass amen now now there's always going to be the enemy that tries to uh persuade you live in a you you live in a in a human body but I'm here to tell you the Rapture is only going to come to those who have who who have totally amen ignored every devil everything that your mind tells you every every situation you you're going to have to walk in the Supernatural realm of God and believe the supernatural word of God and it's producing a body change within you can you say Amen now are you battling amen is is there anybody battling tonight Hallelujah well that's good that's good amen that because you can't battle there's no way there there's no way that you're going to battle uh if if you're if you're not born again but if you're a born again believer amen you're you're in the battle this is a battle for right and wrong this is a battle for the word of God this is a battle for your healing it's a battle for everything amen why because the enemy is here to stop this Rapture the enemy is here just like come on brother Brandon was just talking about he said that that the false Vine had so persecuted those that small minority of Believers that small minority they were being beat Every Which Dr ction it looked but the faith of Jesus Christ was in them and they would not allow that false Vine and what Satan was doing to them to get them to shut up and to quit believing the word of the Lord so if there if they had a physical persecution and they and the enemy was trying to shut them up then how much more is the enemy going to shut up this rapturing generation amen and and he'll come up with every way he can to get you to think that you haven't got faith but the very fact that you're standing here tonight and you're saying God is true and that God Is A Healer and that God I say just blow the devil's all that junk out and say I am who God says I am I'm a Believer and I'm going to overcome there's going to come a time where you will prevail I don't care whether it's in your body whether it's in your mind well it doesn't matter keep on fighting with that faith of the Lord Jesus Christ never was yours never will be your faith it's God's faith in you amen isn't that beautiful praise the Lord so so and and it and it requires it requires that it requires that on on uh to to the believer because you know uh uh if you're not if you're not careful you'll let that Faith just just just you know uh you know as the as as Peter just said have not have not the faith of God with respect to persons amen and and the worst person that you could respect or disrespect would be yourself amen start he was trying to say don't let the faith of God and then you and then you you regarding people's persons and you you you say well this is Rich or this one's poor or this one's this that and the other so they're Christians they're not Christians no you take the word the the faith of God and you believe the word of God it regardless of what you're seeing uh in in in anybody including yourself devil says you ain't going to make it just tell him to shut up and hit the trash can amen you're not going to you're not going to listen to him amen keep that Faith Of God Prevail with that word of God this is a church that will prevail to Rapture amen Rapture it's on it we're here the faith of God is here and Satan wants to close you up shut you up shut you down but we ain't we ain't going allowed amen I told Brother Donald the other day amen he's got those you know found some spots they're really worried about on his lungs and and I said listen buddy we ain't letting you go without a fight hallelujah we're we're uh uh uh we're we're believing God Amen to heal those I I I'm just asking the Lord to heal them uh uh before the the the specialist can uh uh see it did not that happen with with uh brother Sea's an amen y'all remember Anne when she was a baby that that they had already done all of these these reports and they said she has no hip sockets amen and and you could turn those babies legs just all around there was no hip sockets and and oh she cried and they and the doctors had said

God and she went on that Monday Morning by the time uh by the time she had got to her appointment on that Monday morning amen the the one specialist came in and and they took some more X-rays and stuff and so they're looking at this and they have the other and then they go get somebody else come in for you know what they have a whole team of Specialists over in Oklahoma City they're all in the room there and making an mad cuz they're they're moving her legs all around and doing all of this other and they finally come back and they said listen she's got sockets that baby's going to be just fine she ain't got nothing wrong with her amen well if the God could do that and then here we watched her come down the aisle the other day here she is 18 years old I think she's 18 19 years old walking without a limp and I told I I told her the other day I said and with an E amen the Lord done that Miracle remember you would always walk wear braces you would always walk with a limp you would always have to have some kind amen of a crutch or a cane or something to walk with you and here she was a 19-year-old beautiful bride get getting married if God done that for an and created sockets then how much more can God do that for for brother Donald and take away those spots and how much more can God heal livers amen and for crying out loud get God can take that that staff infection that's in your ears there sister Angie to where you never have another problem that's a devil that's trying to torment you and we I just I I we we we don't have to conjure up Faith this is not something it it has nothing to do with you it's God's faith it's the the faith of Jesus and you say well I wish he would give it to me he gave it to you at the new birth it's yours it is your faith and you are free to use that Faith that's not Faith you're going to get and God not get amen we just light ourselves up with the word of God and once that Revelation ever strikes us that that certain feeling that just comes over you and that goes back to being sensitive again that goes back to being amen just being spontaneous because when that certain feeling hits you that says that is mine you I want you to know there's not a devil in hell that can keep that word from coming to pass in your life amen I you just believe it amen there's that certain something you say well we don't go by feelings brother when it hits it hits amen and it does you feel it you know it there's an assurance that hits your heart that says you know what I'm not going to have another problem with it you you know what I'm going to be okay you know what God it is God's faith that just anchors in that heart amen it's yours it's yours every bit of it's yours and so amen I I I believe that this is not an imaginary thing folks I'm talking about a living God Amen and the wonderful thing is it's not God performing miracles from way out yonder it's God living in you living his word over coming demons on the inside of you
