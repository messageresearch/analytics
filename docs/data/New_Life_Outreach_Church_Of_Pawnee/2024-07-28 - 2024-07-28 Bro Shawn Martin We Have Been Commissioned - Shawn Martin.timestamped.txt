[42:39] listening amen but we pray that we can
[42:43] say something to help
[42:46] you
[42:47] amen uh but the book of
[42:51] Isaiah the sixth chapter and we're just
[42:54] going to start at the first verse
[42:59] says in the year that King Uzziah died I
[43:02] also or I saw also the Lord sitting upon
[43:05] a throne high and lifted up and his
[43:08] train filled the
[43:10] temple above it stood the seraphim each
[43:13] one had six wings with Twain he covered
[43:16] his face and with Twain he covered his
[43:18] feet with Twain he did
[43:20] fly and one Cried unto
[43:23] another and said holy holy holy is the
[43:26] Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of
[43:29] his
[43:30] glory and the post of the door moved at
[43:34] the voice of him that cried and the
[43:37] house was filled with
[43:38] smoke then said I woe is me for I am
[43:42] undone because I am a man of unclean
[43:45] lips and I dwell in the midst of a
[43:47] people of unclean lips for my eyes have
[43:51] seen the king the Lord of hosts then
[43:55] flew one of the seraphim unto me having
[43:57] a live coal in his hand which he had
[44:00] taken with the
[44:01] tongues from off the Altar and he laid
[44:04] it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath
[44:07] touched thy lips and thine iniquity is
[44:09] taken away and thy sin is
[44:12] purged also I heard the voice of the
[44:14] Lord saying whom shall I send and who
[44:18] will go for us then said I here am I
[44:22] send me amen let's just bow our heads in
[44:27] a word of
[44:29] prayer
[44:31] father it is a real honor
[44:34] to stand behind this sacred desk here in
[44:39] pawy to minister to your
[44:42] people Lord we don't take such
[44:45] a thing
[44:48] lightly and Lord as we just humble our
[44:51] hearts and humbly ask you to come and
[44:56] use use these mortal lips father that
[45:00] you would speak to your
[45:02] people and Lord I pray that something
[45:05] can be said tonight Lord that
[45:08] would um help Father and that would
[45:12] stick to our hearts and give us strength
[45:16] for the journey we thank you Lord for
[45:19] speaking to us this
[45:21] morning but Lord just now asking you'd
[45:24] speak once again father we ask that you
[45:28] would touch brother Wendell help him
[45:30] sister fresa encourage them Father
[45:33] encourage this church Lord father going
[45:37] through uh Time Lord of loss and um the
[45:43] family brother Miguel and Sister Amy
[45:46] sister
[45:47] Thalman Weston here father Lord we just
[45:51] pray that you would comfort their hearts
[45:54] we ask it oh Father in Jesus Christ's
[45:57] name and the church
[46:00] says amen amen you can have your seats
[46:04] this
[46:06] evening and um you know brother brandham
[46:09] had used this
[46:11] scripture uh when he had preached on
[46:14] influence and what a a powerful sermon
[46:17] it
[46:18] was um if if you hadn't listen to it or
[46:21] been a while you ought to go and listen
[46:23] to it I uh it's just a um uh
[46:28] profound but uh and not to get into
[46:32] everything that he he preached but um
[46:36] thinking of this uh uh you know uh uh
[46:41] here am I Lord send me God looking for
[46:46] someone someone that he could send and
[46:49] of course before he could send um that
[46:54] someone has to come under the
[46:57] influence they've got to come under the
[46:59] influence of his
[47:01] presence but it's it's really hard to to
[47:05] imagine or to believe really that God
[47:09] actually sends people like us or at
[47:12] least I could look at it for me it's
[47:14] hard to believe that he called me he
[47:16] would choose me to preach the gospel or
[47:20] to um uh uh just even be a
[47:25] Christian and And yet when you know when
[47:30] he called us of course it was before the
[47:32] foundation of the world but when we
[47:34] really felt that nudge in our heart to
[47:37] to start serving the lord I don't think
[47:41] any of us really had an idea of the
[47:44] difficulties and the challenges that we
[47:49] would face yeah and sometimes we would
[47:54] look and and people paint uh you know
[47:58] Christianity has just been a happy
[48:00] go-lucky and and but it's not really
[48:03] that that way we heard it today that you
[48:06] have to fight for every inch of
[48:10] ground uh that you possess doesn't mean
[48:13] that it's not yours it just means you're
[48:16] going to have to
[48:17] fight so God didn't tell us the things
[48:20] that we we have to
[48:22] face and um I tell you even you young
[48:26] people you growing up and you may not
[48:27] really understand this but there's a lot
[48:30] of things that you'll face in challenges
[48:33] of
[48:33] life and um but but we all we all go
[48:37] through this whether it be a
[48:39] preacher uh or the lay member
[48:43] parents uh what whatever it is uh there
[48:46] there are
[48:47] challenges that that we deal with and uh
[48:52] uh and and I I will say that if I had to
[48:55] do it all over again I wouldn't change a
[48:58] thing um I I now when I say that I I'd
[49:03] certainly want to be more faithful to
[49:05] him I'd want to be more loyal to him but
[49:09] uh uh I I certainly wouldn't choose
[49:12] another
[49:13] path uh I thank God every day for his
[49:17] grace and his
[49:19] Mercy but you know we're we're here uh
[49:23] in paoni because of the loss of of love
[49:26] one Abigail and or Alba Jo and and you
[49:31] know I know that it's been a a rough uh
[49:35] time um a lot of um uh you know you
[49:39] you've been dealt a a hard
[49:42] blow uh the sudden loss and anguish and
[49:47] things like that and and I tell you it's
[49:49] it's hard to lose the loved ones
[49:51] especially when it comes
[49:53] suddenly uh upon us and and these things
[49:57] and and and you know we I I don't want
[50:00] to stand here talking about the the
[50:03] loss but I do want to encourage you uh
[50:07] because a lot of time Satan can come in
[50:10] and get us all distracted and and and I
[50:14] know we got to grieve and I know that
[50:17] that that you know uh uh we we we we
[50:22] feel the loss and the morning and and
[50:25] that it that that comes naturally that
[50:27] is something that just
[50:29] happens uh there but um uh when when
[50:34] it's when it's all said and done we
[50:37] we've got to still look that we have a
[50:40] purpose in
[50:42] life and and and we got to think about
[50:45] what is our
[50:47] future how are we going to react to this
[50:50] loss
[50:51] how uh uh is it you know uh is it going
[50:55] to affect us in a negative way or is it
[50:58] going to affect us in a positive way uh
[51:02] you know some go out on a drinking binge
[51:05] when when things go wrong or uh they
[51:08] just give up on life and and before you
[51:12] know it they just they just go crazy out
[51:14] in the world and they forget their
[51:17] future they forget about themselves they
[51:19] forget about uh those around them and
[51:23] and uh and really they just make it all
[51:26] about
[51:27] themselves uh you know I and and and I
[51:30] don't mean to sound hard-hearted if you
[51:32] think I am please forgive me but um you
[51:36] know I I was thinking when I had lost uh
[51:38] my wife uh Rebecca and and uh it was
[51:42] just a of course a sudden thing and uh
[51:46] Devastation uh had had my children five
[51:49] children uh to take care of and didn't
[51:52] know how I was going to do it and and um
[51:56] it it you all remember it most of you I
[52:00] guess and and and my world was turned
[52:03] upside down and and uh I honestly didn't
[52:06] know what to do and you know I I I thank
[52:10] God for for brother Wendell sister fresa
[52:13] and the church here uh brother Jonathan
[52:16] Sister Laura and and just all of y'all
[52:20] for for just coming in on the scene and
[52:24] and really helping us and uh you know
[52:27] and and and these things but you know I
[52:31] I wanted to give up in life I I just
[52:33] wanted to give up I I just didn't think
[52:36] I could make it I you know I remember
[52:38] when Rebecca told me you know said the
[52:41] Lord's going to take me home and you
[52:43] know I I said oh you know uh that that's
[52:48] that's just not right uh you're you're
[52:50] wrong on that one cuz I just I can't
[52:52] handle it I wouldn't be able to handle
[52:54] it I said You' be able to handle it more
[52:56] than I would if I would go first and um
[53:00] uh she said well no she says you know I
[53:03] just wanted to let you know that I'm I'm
[53:05] going home to be with the Lord and uh
[53:09] but I just didn't believe it cuz I I
[53:11] just didn't think that you know uh there
[53:14] was just no way that I could live
[53:16] without her and with all the children
[53:19] and and uh just everything and um but
[53:22] but the Lord did take her home and
[53:26] uh uh so it it again it left me
[53:29] devastated and I I remember I left the
[53:33] children you know over at uh my
[53:36] mother-in-law's house and and just asked
[53:39] her to take
[53:40] them uh for for a while and and I just
[53:44] took off um uh didn't know where I was
[53:47] going to go I I I you know and and I
[53:50] know brother Wendell had uh remembers
[53:54] you know I my life was up and a roller
[53:56] coaster it was just a real mess and and
[54:00] U not that I doing anything wrong I just
[54:04] uh just trying to get my
[54:05] bearings and uh but I remember I had
[54:09] gotten into a hotel and just stayed
[54:11] there and the next
[54:13] morning uh uh Dolores had called me and
[54:18] uh she said Sean she said your children
[54:21] are crying for you you know and you know
[54:25] so they want their daddy you know and uh
[54:29] so when when that that happened I I made
[54:33] a vow to the Lord vow to myself that I
[54:38] would never leave my children
[54:40] again uh because I knew that they needed
[54:44] somebody to be stable for them they
[54:47] needed somebody to be a rock they needed
[54:49] somebody to to to to to keep on pressing
[54:54] on and it it really brought me back into
[54:58] Focus that that I do have a purpose in
[55:02] life and just because something bad
[55:05] happens and sometimes we measure the bad
[55:09] we measure things well I can handle this
[55:11] but I really don't think I can handle
[55:12] this and to be honest it seemed like
[55:15] every trial that we go through we just
[55:16] can't handle it but uh uh but God always
[55:19] brings us through the
[55:21] trials but I I I thought of this that
[55:25] that God God has a purpose in what he's
[55:28] doing it if it was up to me uh that that
[55:31] event wouldn't have happened if if it
[55:34] was up to you a lot of things that you
[55:36] have gone through in life it it just
[55:37] wouldn't happen but it's not up to us
[55:41] it's it's it's up to God and and God
[55:44] knows exactly what he's doing and does
[55:49] that hinder us uh from fulfilling the
[55:52] commission absolutely not you understand
[55:55] what I'm saying and and so if if if if
[55:59] God has called us if God has ordained us
[56:03] for a purpose to do something in life
[56:07] then all of our negatives ain't going to
[56:11] stop
[56:13] itl can you
[56:15] sayen go cu cu I know it's easy for like
[56:19] us you know you young people it's it's
[56:21] easy for preachers to get complexes how
[56:24] many's ever had complexes
[56:26] well we we have complexes and sometimes
[56:30] uh uh you know it's hard to even
[56:34] sometimes to stand behind the pulpit
[56:36] because of of complexes it's it's hard
[56:39] to uh uh maybe to to do things that God
[56:44] has called us to do uh because of
[56:47] complexes and and these complexes they
[56:49] build up through through uh uh
[56:53] stumblings or they they build up through
[56:55] the path of past things that have
[56:58] happened and and it you know Satan just
[57:01] uses all kinds of ways to try to stop us
[57:05] from our commission but one thing about
[57:08] it we cannot we cannot focus on on the
[57:12] negative of our life we cannot focus
[57:16] upon the failures of our life we cannot
[57:20] focus upon the obstacles of our life as
[57:23] we've already heard this morning we're
[57:26] called to
[57:27] overcome can you say amen God never
[57:31] called a perfect person to preach the
[57:34] gospel he's never called a perfect
[57:37] person to sing to sing or to testify or
[57:40] to play the music or he's never called a
[57:44] perfect person amen uh uh to be a
[57:49] Christian can you say Amen so in other
[57:52] words we're not living in this bubble
[57:55] without TR
[57:56] and we're not living in this in this
[57:59] this uh uh sphere where there's no
[58:02] problems and there's no there's no
[58:04] heartaches and there's no loneliness and
[58:08] there's no thing you know there there's
[58:10] nothing that bothers us can you amen we
[58:13] we we all have them I I think if we
[58:16] would all stand up and really bear our
[58:18] soul there's so many things that we have
[58:21] issues with and and maybe we struggle
[58:24] with or or or we we think and and and
[58:28] sometimes the devil will tell us that
[58:30] there's absolutely no way that that
[58:32] we're good for anything you know uh uh
[58:35] you know many times the devil tells me
[58:37] you're just not much of a Preacher you
[58:38] know you're not a preacher and and you
[58:40] don't know how many times that I don't
[58:43] want to get up here and and and preach
[58:44] because you feel like you ain't doing
[58:46] any good and I guarantee your pastor
[58:48] feels that way I guarantee brother
[58:50] Jonathan feels that way and and if
[58:52] preachers feel that way you could just
[58:53] imagine what singers feel you can just
[58:56] imagine what daddies feel in with their
[58:58] children or husbands feel with their
[59:00] wives or wives feel with their CH moms
[59:03] and children and and wives with husband
[59:05] we all fight things and we all go
[59:08] through things and we all dealing with
[59:10] things I don't think there's any any
[59:13] person here that can say well I've I'm I
[59:16] ain't got no issues at all and I'm doing
[59:18] good and I don't know what y'all's
[59:19] problem is amen I I don't think that's
[59:22] it at all amen but a lot of times we
[59:24] focus too much on the negative of Our
[59:27] Lives amen and we use these as excuses
[59:31] amen for for for not doing what God has
[59:34] called us to do but I'm going to tell
[59:36] you something no one can take your place
[59:39] no one could take Caleb's Place amen
[59:42] when he come into that mountain and or
[59:44] when he come into that Promised Land
[59:46] don't you know and I really like you
[59:48] know brother Jonathan uh just kind of
[59:50] naming the enemy that Caleb had to face
[59:53] yes Caleb had to deal with natural
[59:55] Giants amen but we're not dealing with
[59:58] natural Giants we are dealing with
[1:00:00] spiritual things like anxiety or
[1:00:03] complexes or or or uh embarrassments or
[1:00:07] negativities and and and and and all of
[1:00:10] these things that are trying to keep us
[1:00:13] from what God has actually called us to
[1:00:16] do but see nobody could take Caleb's
[1:00:19] place it was up to him to take his
[1:00:22] Mountain it was up to him to defeat the
[1:00:25] enemy it was up to him he could not say
[1:00:28] well I I'm going to look at at at
[1:00:30] brother so and so because he just seems
[1:00:32] more able he's more better at it and
[1:00:35] he's more talented and he's more this
[1:00:37] he's more that the the Giants in in in
[1:00:41] in uh uh uh on uh uh the inheritance of
[1:00:45] Caleb would not been defeated but Caleb
[1:00:47] had to face up to it and realize it was
[1:00:51] his responsibility to take his
[1:00:53] inheritance and nobody could defeat his
[1:00:56] Giants nobody amen could take the
[1:00:58] mountain he had to take it himself and
[1:01:01] and I'll tell you no one can can can
[1:01:04] fulfill the commission that God has
[1:01:06] called you you're the one that's got to
[1:01:08] fulfill that
[1:01:11] commission can you say man you're the
[1:01:14] one well what did Brother brandham you
[1:01:15] know and you know brother brandham had
[1:01:17] complexes and he wanted to give up he
[1:01:20] had determined that he was going to give
[1:01:22] up and not not not preach anymore not he
[1:01:25] was going to go out and the and and and
[1:01:26] live like a Herman you all know the
[1:01:28] story amen and God did not accept his
[1:01:31] excuses God did not say oh well you poor
[1:01:34] little thing you I understand you're
[1:01:37] getting rejected I understand you feel
[1:01:39] like you're unworthy I understand that
[1:01:41] things you're going through you just go
[1:01:43] ahead and I'll raise up another Malachi
[1:01:45] 4 no it wasn't going to happen there was
[1:01:47] no other Malachi 4 there was no other
[1:01:50] Prophet that God would send to us the
[1:01:53] responsibility fell upon brother
[1:01:55] brandham his ministry and he had to
[1:01:58] fulfill the
[1:01:59] commission he had to fulfill it yes sir
[1:02:03] you believe
[1:02:04] it he had to fulfill it and so you know
[1:02:09] um and and so God CH show showed him you
[1:02:13] know that that if you if you if you do
[1:02:16] exactly what you think you're going to
[1:02:18] do then I'll show you what you'll become
[1:02:22] it ain't going to be a prosperous life
[1:02:25] you understand what I'm saying it's not
[1:02:27] going to be a prosperous life and I tell
[1:02:29] you what if you're called of God it's
[1:02:32] not going to be a prosperous life if if
[1:02:35] you're running from your
[1:02:37] call if you're running from your
[1:02:39] commission how many homes have been
[1:02:41] wrecked because people would not uh uh
[1:02:44] uh follow the commission that God had H
[1:02:48] how many churches have been wrecked how
[1:02:50] many lives have been wrecked because
[1:02:52] people amen built up complexes or they
[1:02:55] built up and they they looked at the
[1:02:58] negative more than they looked at the
[1:03:00] commission but God wouldn't commission
[1:03:02] you if he wouldn't stand by
[1:03:06] you can you say Amen now Caleb you know
[1:03:10] just thinking of Caleb he was the elect
[1:03:12] of that day meaning that he was
[1:03:15] predestinated and and you know when God
[1:03:17] created the world of course you know
[1:03:20] there was Caleb uh there there was a a
[1:03:23] portion of property of land that God had
[1:03:27] reserved for him and and so when God
[1:03:30] created the the the world you know there
[1:03:33] was that mountain there was that portion
[1:03:36] that God had predestinated this is going
[1:03:39] to be for
[1:03:40] Caleb this is going to be his
[1:03:43] inheritance and and and and so you know
[1:03:47] through all of this God knew the time
[1:03:49] that Caleb would be born he knew that he
[1:03:52] would come to that Promised Land he knew
[1:03:54] that the Giants would be occupying it he
[1:03:57] knew that that land would would would
[1:03:59] you know God God could have kept
[1:04:01] everybody off that said no this is for
[1:04:02] Caleb you stay away from that and this
[1:04:04] is for Caleb you know and and and you
[1:04:06] can't have this and don't you touch that
[1:04:08] or or he could have let them live there
[1:04:09] and then said you know Caleb's coming
[1:04:11] you know and and so I want y'all out of
[1:04:13] here you know and he could have drove no
[1:04:15] no but that wasn't it Caleb had to drive
[1:04:18] the Giants
[1:04:20] off he had to fight them things can you
[1:04:23] say Amen but but God had order already
[1:04:26] predestinated that land for Caleb and
[1:04:29] had predestined Caleb for that
[1:04:33] land that's
[1:04:35] right no one could take his place you
[1:04:38] believe that so Caleb Caleb had to lay
[1:04:41] claim to that mountain give me my
[1:04:44] Mountain that's exactly what he wanted
[1:04:47] give me my Mountain can you say Amen now
[1:04:51] you know I'm thinking of Jesus of how
[1:04:53] that Jesus was predestinated it's what
[1:04:56] the prophet said and no one could take
[1:04:58] his place he was predestinated for a
[1:05:01] purpose and and with this it wasn't a it
[1:05:06] wasn't a a trial free life it wasn't
[1:05:09] just easy coasting amen he he was tested
[1:05:14] tested on every point do you believe
[1:05:17] that tested just like every one of us
[1:05:20] are you know uh uh for just a moment
[1:05:23] Abraham was tested amen he was tested
[1:05:26] that God had promised him a a a land and
[1:05:30] told him to get out of his the this
[1:05:33] Homeland and and and so Abraham did and
[1:05:37] and then told him he was going to bless
[1:05:39] him with the son and that he would have
[1:05:41] a seed and and and and he would be air
[1:05:45] and and and yet he was tested you know I
[1:05:48] I I thought of that uh Hebrews 6:15 says
[1:05:52] so after he patiently endured he
[1:05:55] obtained the promise can you say Amen
[1:05:58] now you know and and brother brandham
[1:06:01] emphasizes there not
[1:06:03] before but after after he had patiently
[1:06:08] endured can you say Amen so so the there
[1:06:13] has to be a a a testing so Abraham first
[1:06:17] received the revelation of the promise
[1:06:19] and I think just like all of us we we we
[1:06:22] come to a personal revelation that that
[1:06:25] this this word is mine and I I pray that
[1:06:29] it really gets down into every one of us
[1:06:32] even to you young people I know we can
[1:06:34] go through the ritual of church and and
[1:06:37] this it becomes a duty and it becomes
[1:06:39] you know probably you know maybe s to
[1:06:41] some an obligation I hope you're past
[1:06:44] that and and and to where you really
[1:06:46] have a desire uh uh to come to the house
[1:06:49] of God and and to serve the Lord but but
[1:06:52] then it has to really become a
[1:06:54] revelation that that every promise in
[1:06:57] this Bible is mine and that God's got
[1:07:01] something for me I'm not here just
[1:07:04] sitting on a bench I'm not just here in
[1:07:06] pawy wasting my time God's got something
[1:07:10] for me I I I I I I think so many people
[1:07:13] lack Revelation they look at the bigger
[1:07:16] churches and they look at all of this
[1:07:18] and they they they they want to be part
[1:07:20] of something huge and big and and all
[1:07:22] that and and and and and you find people
[1:07:25] people just just going here and going
[1:07:27] there and and and you can't find people
[1:07:29] any stable hardly anymore these days but
[1:07:33] I I think it really takes a a personal
[1:07:36] revelation of of why I'm
[1:07:39] here why are you here in
[1:07:42] PA why am I here can you say Amen well
[1:07:47] that God's got a purpose for you God's
[1:07:50] got a commission for you somebody's got
[1:07:54] to shine the light somebody has got to
[1:07:57] see the Glorious Gospel of this
[1:08:00] message can you say Amen some are called
[1:08:04] to City Life some are called to town
[1:08:06] life some are called whatever but is
[1:08:08] everywhere I just believe that God's got
[1:08:11] a witness somewhere somebody that's
[1:08:14] going to understand their calling and
[1:08:16] the purpose that God has for
[1:08:20] them can you say Amen but no matter
[1:08:23] where you go there's going to be trial
[1:08:27] there's going to be
[1:08:28] disappointments there's going to be
[1:08:31] heartaches there there there's going to
[1:08:33] be times of loneliness there's going to
[1:08:36] be times where where Satan really just
[1:08:38] rocks your
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:42] boat can you say amen amen see but but
[1:08:46] if you can understand and have that
[1:08:48] Revelation that no matter what happens
[1:08:51] no matter what goes God will never never
[1:08:54] fail me he will never leave
[1:08:58] me can you say
[1:09:01] Amen you know uh so so we we find amen
[1:09:06] you know brother Bram talking of Abraham
[1:09:09] and how he patiently
[1:09:12] endured and we all know that it was not
[1:09:14] an easy life for
[1:09:16] Abraham remember even the times that he
[1:09:19] had the opportunity to choose where or
[1:09:22] well he was separating God told him to
[1:09:24] separate from life and it was Abraham
[1:09:27] that gave lot the First
[1:09:29] Choice he said that's what Christians do
[1:09:31] always give the first choice to to the
[1:09:34] to
[1:09:35] others and lot looked upon the plains of
[1:09:38] Sodom and Gomorrah he looked upon the
[1:09:40] glamour he looked upon these things
[1:09:42] because he did not have a true
[1:09:44] revelation of God's
[1:09:46] purpose and he chose the the sin and he
[1:09:49] chose the beauty chose the glamour chose
[1:09:52] it all and there was old Abraham out in
[1:09:54] the desert living in
[1:09:56] tense but he had a
[1:10:00] commission he was given a
[1:10:03] promise yes he had to patiently endure
[1:10:08] yes he might have been laughed at and
[1:10:10] scorned and it seemed like God was
[1:10:13] forgot about him it seemed like the
[1:10:15] promise would never happen but he still
[1:10:18] remained
[1:10:20] true brother brandom says no matter how
[1:10:22] hard it comes and what it looks like
[1:10:24] what anybody body says you know he says
[1:10:27] you know I want to with patience I want
[1:10:30] to with patience not fretting you know
[1:10:32] he says person can't have patience and
[1:10:35] Fring all the time you've got to set
[1:10:37] yourselves everybody say I've got to set
[1:10:39] myself C I've got to set
[1:10:43] myself yes sir see and and and right
[1:10:47] straight there and walk right on no
[1:10:49] matter what takes place you just move
[1:10:52] right on Hallelujah h
[1:10:56] how many believes that you just move
[1:10:59] right on in your times of trouble don't
[1:11:02] you forget God in your times of Tears
[1:11:06] Don't You Forget God he promised he'll
[1:11:09] be a comfort he promised he'd be a way
[1:11:12] maker he promised he would be a provider
[1:11:16] amen that's what he is because if he
[1:11:18] called you to do something he going to
[1:11:20] bring you through he going to bring you
[1:11:22] through this trial he's going to bring
[1:11:24] you through all these your tears will be
[1:11:26] dried up your heart is going to be
[1:11:29] mended
[1:11:32] Hallelujah can you say
[1:11:34] Amen the thing is stay with God stay
[1:11:38] with the commission stay with the
[1:11:41] purpose stay with what God has called
[1:11:44] you to
[1:11:49] do you remember what brother Brown said
[1:11:52] he said people are afraid that God won't
[1:11:53] keep his word
[1:11:57] they're afraid but if God has called you
[1:12:00] then he's going to keep you you believe
[1:12:04] it he's going to believe he's going to
[1:12:06] keep you now we we find you know brother
[1:12:11] brandham said he says Jesus no matter if
[1:12:14] he was in a storm and the gaale is
[1:12:17] knocking the boat from one side to the
[1:12:19] other or he was standing in the face in
[1:12:21] a mess of demons if he was hanging
[1:12:24] anywhere
[1:12:25] it never moved him he walked right on
[1:12:29] just as calm and quiet as he could be
[1:12:32] why he was simply unconscious of fear or
[1:12:35] anything around him whether it was going
[1:12:37] to happen or whether it wasn't going to
[1:12:39] happen he knew it was going to happen
[1:12:41] because God said so everybody say God
[1:12:44] said so God said so he didn't say oh I
[1:12:48] have I prayed through wonder if I fasted
[1:12:50] long enough wonder if I did this he just
[1:12:52] walked right on unconscious he believed
[1:12:54] what God said was truth the words must
[1:12:58] be fulfilled and he know what his life
[1:13:01] was to fulfill them and he said and
[1:13:04] you're here everybody say I'm here to
[1:13:07] fulfill it
[1:13:09] too you're here to fulfill it
[1:13:16] too ain't that
[1:13:18] right so he says just walk unconscious
[1:13:21] of fear walk unconscious of criticism
[1:13:24] walk unconscious unto the world walk as
[1:13:27] you walk in Christ walk with him not
[1:13:29] paying attention to the right or the
[1:13:31] left hand just keep moving on if
[1:13:33] something comes up in the church walk
[1:13:34] with God if sickness strikes you walk
[1:13:36] with God if the neighbor don't like you
[1:13:37] walk with God just keep walking with
[1:13:41] God Amen said Enoch walked one day like
[1:13:44] that he said you know what he done he
[1:13:46] walked all the way home with God got so
[1:13:49] far up the road he didn't want to come
[1:13:51] back anymore can you say amen he said
[1:13:54] you're going to have your ups and downs
[1:13:56] but don't worry you got to go through
[1:13:57] the Brier patches and over sharp rocks
[1:14:00] and over the Bluffs and down through the
[1:14:02] Hillside and up through the mountains
[1:14:03] over the waters but walk with
[1:14:06] God hallelujah God's commissioned
[1:14:10] you can you say
[1:14:14] amen I pray that something was said
[1:14:17] that'll help you a little
[1:14:19] bit you understand where we're at
[1:14:22] today what brother Jonathan was saying
[1:14:25] we're in the land we're in the land this
[1:14:28] is the there there's no other people do
[1:14:31] you realize Caleb is your
[1:14:33] type he he types no other
[1:14:36] people Caleb is your type the prophet
[1:14:40] said he's the type of the end time
[1:14:42] believer that is following this end time
[1:14:46] message can you say Amen that there
[1:14:49] there's no other type I mean uh uh that
[1:14:51] that there's no other age that Caleb
[1:14:53] typed you're that type
[1:14:56] and and if you want to know your future
[1:14:58] look at Caleb brother Ram said you could
[1:15:00] take this Bible and find some character
[1:15:03] and you can know what your purpose is
[1:15:05] and what your future is and what your
[1:15:07] outcome will be amen so if you look at
[1:15:11] Caleb you can never fail if you look at
[1:15:14] Caleb it's it then you know what you're
[1:15:16] supposed to do in this age if you're
[1:15:19] looking at Caleb then you know that God
[1:15:21] will be with
[1:15:23] you right
[1:15:27] Hallelujah the word commission it means
[1:15:30] command or
[1:15:32] decree and uh Webster it says you know
[1:15:37] he he says commission is a formal
[1:15:38] written warrant granting the power to
[1:15:41] perform various Acts or duties an
[1:15:44] authorization or command to act in a
[1:15:47] prescribed manner so so it in and if if
[1:15:52] you're going to receive the commission
[1:15:54] if you've received that commission then
[1:15:56] that means you have been
[1:15:57] sent God has sent you how many believes
[1:16:01] that God has sent

[1:16:05] longer but God has sent you God didn't

[1:17:03] means to be sent somebody that's going

[1:21:56] to I I'll be honest as a pastor you know
[1:22:01] more and more I I was talking to one
[1:22:02] Pastor in North Carolina and he he said
[1:22:05] you know ever since I I was pastoring
[1:22:08] started pastoring he says I never I
[1:22:10] never realized how precious it is to
[1:22:13] have faithful people that want to work
[1:22:17] in the kingdom of
[1:22:20] God very rare these days cuz everybody's
[1:22:25] got focus upon themselves we we get so
[1:22:28] focused upon our problems and our own
[1:22:30] issues and our own things that that that
[1:22:34] and and Satan gets us there and we can
[1:22:37] get
[1:22:38] there hello we can get there we can get
[1:22:42] so feeling sorry for
[1:22:44] ourselves we can get so bogged down in
[1:22:46] our own pity on troubles or on this or
[1:22:51] own
[1:22:52] that but remember you've been
[1:22:56] commissioned Hallelujah press the battle

[1:23:06] somebody even if you don't feel like
[1:23:09] testifying testify of God's goodness why
[1:23:12] because someone needs to hear
[1:23:14] it even when you don't feel like coming

[1:23:19] needs to see you even when you don't
[1:23:22] feel like saying amen say Amen anyway
[1:23:25] cuz somebody needs to hear
[1:23:29] it I'm going to just tell off of myself
[1:23:32] I got so discouraged one time I was I
[1:23:34] was in a meeting and and I got so bogged
[1:23:38] down just thinking of things of problems
[1:23:42] that were going on at home and I I got
[1:23:46] so bogged down in that service that I
[1:23:49] couldn't even lift my
[1:23:51] hands I was hearing the preacher preach
[1:23:54] yeah I agreed with everything he was
[1:23:57] saying but I couldn't
[1:24:00] even lift my
[1:24:03] hands it it was it was a it was
[1:24:06] something that just overwhelm I got so
[1:24:08] into a depression setting in
[1:24:13] church people worshiping God everywhere
[1:24:18] I mean it was a power packed service but
[1:24:20] I entertain
[1:24:22] negative I entertained that thing and it
[1:24:27] it overcame me and I realized what I was
[1:24:31] entertaining was greater than just a
[1:24:36] thought it was giving me thoughts and I
[1:24:38] was dwelling on it and before you know
[1:24:40] it it overcame me and I sat there and by
[1:24:45] the end of that service I mean people
[1:24:46] were worshiping and I just sitting there
[1:24:48] just like oh God and you know what I was
[1:24:51] I was crying for Mercy to the Lord Lord
[1:24:53] if you'll just help me I I won't do this
[1:24:56] by your grace I I won't entertain this
