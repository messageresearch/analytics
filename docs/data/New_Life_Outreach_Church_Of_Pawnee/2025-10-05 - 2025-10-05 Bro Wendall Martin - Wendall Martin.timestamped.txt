[37:28] experienced in this generation.
[37:32] It does give you rest. There's no more
[37:35] struggle for the soul because the
[37:38] perfect word has come. There's no

[37:57] there's a divine essence that has that
[37:59] has come to us in this generation.
[38:03] And man, it it it creates a it produces
[38:09] something that religion cannot produce.
[38:12] And listening to the young people sing

[38:15] people that has an experience with God.
[38:21] Seeing
[38:23] you elders here, it's it's produced
[38:25] something
[38:27] within you. And that's that gives us a a
[38:30] great hope in this generation where
[38:33] where it's just a godless generation.
[38:36] But to see the Holy Spirit here living
[38:39] his word through his people, it's it's a
[38:43] wonderful thing, isn't it?
[38:44] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for that rest. Amen.

[39:50] always look forward uh every time she
[39:53] gets to come to Oklahoma and u and so we
[39:57] just say God bless her and brother and
[40:00] sister Gadman. We just always love
[40:03] having them with us
[40:07] [Music]
[40:10] and uh I I hope they don't get a complex
[40:13] coming this way. you know, I mean, there
[40:15] are friends and he struggled so much
[40:17] this last year with in his body and and
[40:20] uh they come back through Oklahoma and

[40:31] suffered just really sick, but she's
[40:34] here today. And so, we just say God
[40:36] bless you. Amen.
[40:40] And uh so if you have your Bibles, why
[40:44] don't we turn to the book of
[40:45] Philippians, the 2 chapter, and that way
[40:47] you can have your seats. Um we if I've
[40:51] overlooked anybody, we we just say God
[40:53] bless every one of you. Appreciate you

[40:57] And um
[41:00] u brother Joe's got a friend there. God
[41:02] bless you, sis. Good, good to have you
[41:04] this morning. Amen.
[41:09] There in Philippians the 2 chapter and
[41:12] the first verse
[41:14] it says if there be therefore any
[41:16] consolation in Christ any comfort of
[41:20] love any fellowship of the spirit if any
[41:23] bowels of mer and mercies fulfill ye my
[41:27] joy that ye be like-minded
[41:30] having the same love being of one accord
[41:33] and of one mind let nothing be done
[41:35] through strife or vain glory
[41:38] but in loneliness of mind. Let each
[41:39] esteem other better than themselves.
[41:43] Look not every man on his own things,
[41:45] but every man also on the things of
[41:48] others. Let this mind be in you which
[41:52] was also in Christ Jesus, who being in
[41:55] the form of God, thought it not robbery
[41:57] to be equal with God, but made himself
[42:01] of no reputation,
[42:03] and took upon him the form of a servant,
[42:06] and was made in the likeness of men,
[42:08] being found in fashion as a man, he
[42:11] humbled himself, and become obedient
[42:14] unto death, even the death of the cross.
[42:18] Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father,
[42:20] we want to thank you today for your
[42:23] blessings and and the opportunity to
[42:26] come together with our with with the
[42:29] redeemed of the Lord and and we just ask
[42:32] Lord that you would bless everyone that
[42:34] is that has been faithful to come and
[42:38] bless our visitors, Lord. And God, we we
[42:41] ask that your presence would be here and
[42:44] and that it would be felt among us all.
[42:48] And I pray Lord that you would direct
[42:49] our thoughts and let us speak only as
[42:53] the oracles of God that have been
[42:55] revealed in in our day today. And ask
[42:59] Lord that your word would take on flesh
[43:01] among us. And Father, if there be any
[43:04] sick among us, we ask that you would
[43:06] heal them. Lord, we're missing a few
[43:08] here this morning. And we ask Lord that
[43:11] you would be with those Lord. Be with
[43:14] all of the sick ones. And Father, we'll
[43:16] give you glory and honor in Jesus name
[43:20] we pray.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[43:26] seated here this morning.
[43:29] I want to take this this thought.
[43:33] Thought it not robbery to be equal with
[43:35] God.
[43:37] They were let this mind be in you that
[43:41] was also in Christ Jesus
[43:44] the man the the man God man who being in
[43:49] the form of God. Brother Brandham talks
[43:52] about God changing forms
[43:56] &gt;&gt; and that he thought it not robbery and
[44:00] that word robbery might not be there's
[44:03] two meanings that that are in that Greek
[44:07] word and um one is in the illegal sense
[44:12] of robbing somebody
[44:14] but then there was another one which
[44:16] pertains to this one that word thought
[44:18] it not robbery to be equal with God.
[44:21] thought it uh not a treasure to be
[44:24] clutched and retained at all hazards to
[44:28] be equal with God. So though Christ was
[44:32] in the form of God, the logos of God,
[44:36] Amen. He was the visible expression, the
[44:39] the pillar of fire.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That would reveal himself to the
[44:44] prophets, that would reveal himself to
[44:46] Moses in the burning bush. Amen. But he
[44:51] in this form, Amen. Though he was in the
[44:55] form of God, thought it not a treasure
[44:58] to be clutched or retained, Amen. at all
[45:02] hazards to be equal with God. But he was
[45:04] willing to take on the form of a man. He
[45:08] was Amen. to come and to reveal himself
[45:13] because God is always revealing himself.
[45:17] Every time God and he's revealed himself
[45:19] in many ways, the prophet would tell us
[45:21] that God hides himself always hides
[45:25] himself behind a veil.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was the great pillar of fire.
[45:29] He was the tree of life in the garden.
[45:32] He He was the whirlwind that appeared to
[45:35] Job and spoke. He was the the rock that
[45:38] followed the children of Israel in the
[45:41] wilderness. He was the Amen. the the
[45:44] mana. Amen. the bread of life that fell
[45:48] from heaven. So God reveals himself in
[45:52] many forms and he's God. He can reveal
[45:54] himself in in however way he wants to
[45:57] reveal himself. But God has always had a
[46:01] desire
[46:02] to to reveal himself to humanity as a
[46:08] human. Amen. And that was exactly what
[46:12] God was doing. Amen. men tends to look
[46:16] at the form that God is revealed in and
[46:20] and then um they they they worship the
[46:24] form and they don't find God. You you
[46:28] can see that in Amen. as they they
[46:30] worship the creation and never find God.
[46:33] They you know they they the natives
[46:35] worship the sun. You've got India
[46:37] worshiping uh the many different
[46:40] animals. You've got uh um you know many
[46:43] you know worship the totem post. Some
[46:45] Amen. There's there's some that that
[46:47] worship the planets. We've got we've got
[46:50] uh many Catholics worshiping Mary.
[46:52] There's there's always Amen. It because
[46:55] men are to are uh men and women were
[46:59] created to be worshippers. God wants to
[47:02] be worshiped. But identifying where God
[47:05] is is so important because God is not
[47:08] necessarily in the form. God is in his
[47:13] word that is being expressed through the
[47:16] form.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. God. You see, that's where the ch
[47:20] the the the people could not understand
[47:23] when when Jesus come to earth, they
[47:26] could not understand God being expressed
[47:31] in the form of a man.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And they they say you make yourself God.
[47:37] Amen. You we we we don't know anything
[47:40] about you. You have a devil. you've got.
[47:42] But yet he was the very expression
[47:47] of deity. He was the very expression of
[47:52] the logos. He was the manifestation. He
[47:55] was God in in a human form. Oh, can you
[48:00] say amen?
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Now that first theophonic uh form of God
[48:05] or the theophonic body of God was the
[48:08] logos, that pillar of fire. It was the
[48:11] Christ, the living word, that that that
[48:15] God had had all of those thoughts and
[48:18] all of those attributes in the back of
[48:20] his mind. He he he he had those eternal
[48:24] thoughts and you were there in those
[48:27] thoughts. You were there with God. You
[48:30] listen, you're not you're not an
[48:32] afterthought of God. You're the original
[48:34] thought of God.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; You're not a wannabe God. You are the
[48:40] very expression of the thoughts of God.
[48:43] So, so when God thought these things,
[48:46] God was forever that invisible God with
[48:49] Amen. that that that spans from uh uh
[48:52] eons and eons of time. But you see, or
[48:55] before time, but when God spoke there,
[48:58] out of God comes this great logos, that
[49:02] great pillar of fire. And that filler of
[49:05] fire was sitting there hovering and God
[49:08] emptied himself. All of his thoughts,
[49:10] all the deity of God comes in the
[49:13] expression of that pillar of fire. Now
[49:17] God would forever more, Amen. be
[49:20] synonymous with that pillar of fire. God
[49:24] lived in that pillar of fire. That
[49:26] pillar of fire held every thought. That
[49:29] pillar of fire had every attribute of
[49:32] God within it. Well, glory to God.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; That would now be the physical
[49:39] expression of God.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh, I I just love it
[49:45] when I think about it. But you see,
[49:47] God's goal, Eman, was to come in the
[49:51] form of a man. And he promised, I will
[49:54] raise up uh from the woman's seed a
[49:57] serpent bruiser, a a a a people who
[50:01] would be deceptionp proof. And Amen. And
[50:05] we understand that that could only
[50:07] happen if the pillar of fire would come
[50:11] in the form of a human uh uh human being
[50:15] in order to take the sins of the human
[50:18] race and to redeem them back to God. And
[50:22] we can see it all throughout the
[50:23] scripture. We don't want to go it go
[50:25] into great detail, but you can see,
[50:27] Amen. God appeared when God appeared to
[50:30] Abraham as Melkisedc. He appeared in the
[50:34] theophony. Amen. A form of a man. He
[50:38] appeared to Abraham as a man.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; He had dust on his clothes.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. He ate bread and he and and and he
[50:48] ate meat and he drunk milk. Well, praise
[50:50] the name of the Lord. The prophet of God
[50:53] says, you see, when God came down, he
[50:55] called he called a couple of the angels
[50:57] and he says, "Come on down. We're going
[50:58] to we've got to go down and visit
[51:00] earth." And what did he do? He he picked
[51:03] up a piece of dust and blew into it and
[51:06] said, "Gabriel, step into that one."
[51:08] Amen. Told him to step into that one.
[51:10] And then he created another one. And God
[51:12] himself stepped into that body. And when
[51:16] Abraham seen this coming, these three
[51:19] men coming, Amen. What did he say? My
[51:23] Lord,
[51:25] &gt;&gt; he saw. Amen. God, oh, glory to God. I
[51:30] think we need to see God in his form
[51:33] today because God's got a form on the
[51:36] earth. God always veils himself. God is
[51:40] going to be revealed. A but he hides
[51:42] himself from him h from the world and
[51:46] and reveals himself to the elect. When
[51:49] God Amen. When Moses wanted to see God,
[51:52] he says, "God, if I could see you," and
[51:54] God says, "No man can see my face and
[51:56] live." Amen. But he put his hands over
[52:00] over the eyes of of Moses and he walked
[52:04] past him. And the Bible says when he saw
[52:07] the glory of God, he saw God as a man.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Well, praise the Lord.
[52:17] When the king of Babylon, he's looking
[52:19] down as he threw Shadrach, Meshach, and
[52:21] Abednego in the in the flames of the
[52:23] fire. And when he looked down there, he
[52:25] says, "Did you how many people did we
[52:27] throw in there?" Amen. We threw three.
[52:29] But I see the son of God like as unto a
[52:35] man.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; So God in all of these theophonic forms,
[52:41] God was declaring his desire to be a
[52:45] man.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Did you know that God still veils
[52:49] himself today? And many people miss they
[52:53] miss the expression of God because they
[52:57] have got something in their mind and
[52:59] they don't truly understand. Ezekiel,
[53:02] Amen. When Ezekiel looked at God and the
[53:04] vision and he saw the cherubams and he
[53:07] and he saw the four living amen
[53:09] creatures and the Bible says he saw a
[53:12] throne and he saw a man sitting up on
[53:17] the throne. So when we say that Jesus of
[53:21] the New Testament is the expression
[53:26] of God of the Old Testament, are you
[53:30] hearing me? It's God revealing himself
[53:34] in the form
[53:36] &gt;&gt; of a man.
[53:39] When God would manifest
[53:42] and God would declare himself to earth,
[53:46] &gt;&gt; God has a voice. How many believes God
[53:49] has a voice?
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Because Moses heard his voice lipped to
[53:53] ear.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; God can write
[53:59] &gt;&gt; because he wrote the Ten Commandments.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; He wrote the Ten Commandments.
[54:04] But when God wanted to reveal himself to
[54:08] earth, he would always
[54:11] use a man.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; God would raise up prophets that would
[54:16] come in in in in their specific
[54:20] generations. Any time you ever seen a
[54:24] prophet come to earth, Amen. If there
[54:27] was a prophet on the earth, you had
[54:29] better perk up your ears because God's
[54:31] fixing to talk. God's fixing to say
[54:33] something. God's got something that he's
[54:36] wanting to declare to his people. Well,
[54:38] glory to God. Amen. I know Pentecost has
[54:41] made a has made, you know, a mess of
[54:44] things and all their guessings and all
[54:47] of their prophecies and all of their and
[54:49] I just want to tell you, amen, 99.9%
[54:52] of it is just all a bunch of nonsense.
[54:55] It's a it's a bunch of hogwash. I'm not
[54:57] saying that God, amen, doesn't use
[54:59] prophecies and God doesn't speak in his
[55:02] body, amen, through the gifts. I I I I'm
[55:04] not I the word says he does. But I want
[55:07] to tell you, when a word prophet steps
[55:09] upon the earth, God's got something to
[55:11] say. And we ought to say, "Lord, let me
[55:14] hear. Don't let me just here a little
[55:17] bit here and a little bit there. But let
[55:20] me catch what you are saying because
[55:23] there is a farm that God has placed on
[55:27] the earth to speak through.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[55:33] &gt;&gt; So when he talks to humanity, he would
[55:36] raise up a prophet.
[55:38] Oh, glory to God. what it must have been
[55:41] like if I if if you were if you would
[55:44] have been there I in in in Egypt as
[55:46] slaves
[55:48] &gt;&gt; and to have Moses coming and speaking in
[55:52] the first uh the first person
[55:57] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[56:00] and the children of Israel hearing the
[56:01] prophet step up and say amen uh uh uh
[56:05] Pharaoh let my people go and he's
[56:10] standing standing there in the amen in
[56:12] the place of God or he's standing there
[56:15] anointed by God. Amen. Why? Because he
[56:19] was the form the pillar of fire that had
[56:22] met him in in the burning bush is now
[56:26] within him speaking declaring the words
[56:30] of life. And the authority of God is
[56:33] with him. The anointing of God is with
[56:37] him to deliver God's people.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, God God is has
[56:48] always
[56:50] in a form. And I I I I think of as a
[56:54] play as the prophet would would would
[56:57] explain, Amen. that that morphe and and
[57:01] and how that God would would reveal
[57:04] himself and the different forms and and
[57:07] and he would brother Brandon would say
[57:10] there amen there would be many
[57:12] characteristics that would be played by
[57:15] by the one individual as as in a play.
[57:18] Amen. And and sometimes you've got one
[57:21] person he's the villain one time and
[57:23] then he's the he's this and he's that.
[57:25] Amen. different forms, but there's only
[57:29] that one person that is playing it.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Well, aren't you glad for that? Aren't
[57:33] you glad that God can just reveal
[57:35] himself however he wants to do it?
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and they would and they
[57:40] that one person he was using Romeo and
[57:43] Juliet and Amen. and how they you know
[57:46] this one played this in in his
[57:48] daughter's play and how that Amen. There
[57:50] was one person that played two or three
[57:52] different roles. Amen. And they were
[57:54] dressed different. Amen. They had
[57:56] different rows. They they Amen.
[57:58] different characters, but it was all the
[58:01] same one that was being that was
[58:04] expressing itself. Amen. Well, can you
[58:06] say amen? I just want to let you know
[58:08] God is big and God can be what he wants
[58:11] to be. Amen. And it's God's character.
[58:16] Now, the form in itself is is not what
[58:19] God wants us to look at. God's wanting
[58:22] us to look at the essence. Amen. Of his
[58:26] character behind that form.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; You see many times, Amen. preachers get
[58:32] it mixed up and and different ones get
[58:34] it mixed up. If the anointing of God is
[58:36] upon them, then they begin to think
[58:38] something great of themselves. Amen. The
[58:40] the form is not what God is. Amen. That
[58:44] the form without God is nothing.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; But it's the essence of the character.
[58:51] Jesus was not just another man. It was
[58:54] the essence of the character of God that
[58:58] was within him that was declaring
[59:01] something is different
[59:04] &gt;&gt; about that man.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Now
[59:10] within his character
[59:13] is father
[59:15] son
[59:17] within the character of God is redeemer,
[59:20] &gt;&gt; savior, healer. within that character of
[59:24] God. Well, can you say amen?
[59:27] &gt;&gt; God revealed himself uh uh to to to
[59:31] Israel as Jehovah. Then he further
[59:34] reveals himself Jehovah Gyra. And then
[59:38] he further reveals himself as Jehovah
[59:41] Shalom. And then he further reveals,
[59:44] Amen. Brother Brandham would say it's
[59:45] the same God just revealing himself in a
[59:49] deeper expression of furtherance of his
[59:52] character. It was God reveal well praise
[59:56] the Lord. So to Abraham he was the
[59:59] provider. He was the one that took that
[1:00:02] lamb. Amen. And and created a lamb
[1:00:05] because he was in need of a lamb. Amen.
[1:00:08] But to the others, he revealed himself
[1:00:10] as Jehovah Shalom because God was
[1:00:14] wanting to express himself as a
[1:00:18] peacegiver, as a healer. Am I going too
[1:00:21] slow? I want you to understand that
[1:00:24] these forms that God comes in is a
[1:00:28] furtherance of his expression. Right.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:00:34] the word form comes from that word
[1:00:37] morphe and it simply is the form or the
[1:00:40] shape or the appearance that expresses
[1:00:43] the essential nature of something. Amen.
[1:00:47] It's the way of things strikes the eye.
[1:00:50] Brother Brandham would put it this way
[1:00:52] this way here in the unveiling of God.
[1:00:54] He says the Greek word means something
[1:00:56] that could not be seen yet it's there
[1:01:00] and then it's changed and the eye can
[1:01:03] catch it. So the invisible God wanting
[1:01:07] to express himself in a certain way.
[1:01:09] Amen. Then it's and then it declares
[1:01:13] itself. And he uses the illustration. He
[1:01:16] said like Elijah at at Dothan the
[1:01:18] servant couldn't see all those angels
[1:01:21] around there. God just changed. Amen.
[1:01:24] Not brought the angels down. He changed
[1:01:28] the seeing of that servant. And there
[1:01:31] was the mountains full of angels and
[1:01:32] fire and horses of fire and chariots of
[1:01:35] fire all around his prophet. He changed
[1:01:38] the seeing. The thing was already there.
[1:01:44] [Applause]
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; God is Hallelujah. God's always been
[1:01:49] here. God was here. Amen. before the
[1:01:52] prophet came. But the prophet came to
[1:01:55] express. Somebody say express. He was a
[1:02:00] form in which God would come in.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; He was the fulfillment of Malachi 4.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; He was the fulfillment of Revelations
[1:02:11] 10. He was the full quit. Can you say
[1:02:14] amen? But you see, he's only partial
[1:02:16] fulfillment because the other part of
[1:02:18] it, I send unto you, Elijah the prophet,
[1:02:24] and he will turn you back to the
[1:02:28] fathers, back to the Bible, back to the
[1:02:32] manifestation.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Oh, I I I think it's so
[1:02:38] beautiful because God is always wanting
[1:02:42] to be known by to his elect.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; So, thus the Greek word for form, Amen,
[1:02:51] is the outward expression which a person
[1:02:54] gives of his inmost nature. Now, I want
[1:02:57] you to think about that because the
[1:02:58] character played will be the expression
[1:03:02] of the perfect perfect essence.
[1:03:06] The character played is not something
[1:03:09] posed from something without someone
[1:03:12] making themsself the form of God. But
[1:03:15] when God comes in and expresses himself
[1:03:19] through a form, it is God
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; because his his his his
[1:03:28] actions, his words, his deeds,
[1:03:32] everything is coming from that inner
[1:03:35] expression that God is giving from
[1:03:38] within him. Yeah.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; You know, when you say that you're a
[1:03:45] Christian, when you say that you're a
[1:03:47] son and daughter of God,
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; you know what that that's why the
[1:03:51] Apostle Paul, Amen, tells there in in
[1:03:53] Corinthians, "Know ye not that you are
[1:03:57] the temple of the living God?
[1:04:01] Know ye not that God's got another
[1:04:04] form?" They they Amen. They're trying to
[1:04:07] say, "Oh, we got to have something to
[1:04:09] pray to. We got to pray to Mary. We got
[1:04:10] to pray to Venus. We got to pray to
[1:04:12] this." Amen. In in that pagan Rome, but
[1:04:14] it was the Apostle Paul that stood up,
[1:04:17] amen, even on Mars Hill and said,
[1:04:19] "You're way too superstitious. You're
[1:04:21] serving all of these gods. You're
[1:04:23] praying to all of these gods. And you've
[1:04:24] even got this one, Amen, sign up here,
[1:04:27] amen, uh, to the unknown God." He says,
[1:04:30] "Don't you know that God is in another
[1:04:33] form?
[1:04:35] He's in another form. God, that
[1:04:38] invisible God is living in humanity.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:04:47] forms,
[1:04:51] actors,
[1:04:52] God living himself through
[1:04:56] when a movie is being uh made about a I
[1:05:01] don't know a hero
[1:05:04] that that actor that is going to play
[1:05:08] um I don't know I I I don't I don't
[1:05:12] watch I don't watch that uh TVs and
[1:05:14] stuff but I I seen one that that was I
[1:05:17] watched a little something that came on
[1:05:19] my phone about I guess they must have
[1:05:21] made something of of u of President
[1:05:24] Reagan
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; and um and and and
[1:05:30] the actor they were interviewing and he
[1:05:32] was saying I I I had to delve in to his
[1:05:37] per I my personality had to become his
[1:05:40] personality.
[1:05:42] Amen. And he said, "I learned his laugh
[1:05:44] and I learned the way he looked and I I
[1:05:46] I I I
[1:05:49] got into his jokes and I I looked at his
[1:05:52] policies." So everything So when that
[1:05:54] man was playing a the character of
[1:05:58] Ronald Reagan, what you saw was the
[1:06:02] expression of a man who is already dead.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; But you can see the expression. I'm
[1:06:10] getting somewhere. I got to build my
[1:06:12] case to you here this morning. When you
[1:06:14] sip at and you looked at that player,
[1:06:17] and I don't know his name, wouldn't know
[1:06:19] him from anybody. Amen. But when you
[1:06:22] looked at that man, you did not see his
[1:06:26] personality. You did not see what his
[1:06:29] ability is. You saw that of Ronald
[1:06:34] Reagan. Hallelujah.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; And when God takes you, you are just an
[1:06:42] actor. Amen. You are just the the form.
[1:06:45] I'm not not talking about a Pharisee
[1:06:47] actor. Amen. I'm talking about you are
[1:06:50] the form that is going to express that
[1:06:53] invisible God. He's not someone that
[1:06:55] died. He's living his life through his
[1:07:00] church.
[1:07:03] The works that I do shall you do and
[1:07:07] even greater because there will be more
[1:07:09] of you.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; I am going to live in you.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; You see?
[1:07:22] Amen. Until that actor becomes one in
[1:07:24] spirit and action with the hero.
[1:07:28] So the shape
[1:07:30] someone shout hallelujah.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; The shape
[1:07:35] of the physical object
[1:07:38] is not the point at hand.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; They rejected Jesus
[1:07:51] because they didn't like the form in
[1:07:54] which God came in.
[1:07:58] Oo, we got to be careful
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; because we want to put God in a certain
[1:08:04] form. And I want to tell you about the
[1:08:06] time you've got God all boxed in right
[1:08:08] here, you're going to find he's in
[1:08:09] another form over here.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; We're going to find out. But it's always
[1:08:15] consistent with the logos. For the
[1:08:17] logos, the living word, is the one that
[1:08:21] is taking on form, different forms, many
[1:08:25] forms. Well, can you say amen? Let me
[1:08:27] just put it this way here today. He is
[1:08:30] living in a mother form. He is living in
[1:08:33] a father form. He is living well. Come
[1:08:37] on, church. Amen. It is God's
[1:08:40] expressions.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; He's living in the five-fold ministry
[1:08:44] form. He's living every form. It's got
[1:08:49] to go back and look at the essential
[1:08:52] character behind
[1:08:55] that form.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you just love him?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:09:03] is now the word living in a body.
[1:09:07] So when you looked at Christ,
[1:09:10] Amen. Again this expression
[1:09:14] of being that carries in itself the
[1:09:17] distinct nature and character of that
[1:09:21] great logos to whom the expression
[1:09:24] pertains and thus it permanently
[1:09:27] identified himself with that nature that
[1:09:31] character. It was the mold or the way or
[1:09:34] the manner in which the essential being
[1:09:36] of God expresses itself.
[1:09:42] If we don't if we fail to miss this
[1:09:46] then if we fail to if we fail to see
[1:09:50] this my friends
[1:09:54] there's no peace unless you can identify
[1:09:58] yourself as the body the form
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; which God is living in
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; there is nothing there you you you see
[1:10:07] what I'm saying because Jesus was 100%
[1:10:11] man.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; And 100% God.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet taught us.
[1:10:22] That's what the Bible taught us. He was
[1:10:23] all man and yet all God.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Some people look at at Jesus and say,
[1:10:30] "Well, why did he why did he have to
[1:10:32] pray?"
[1:10:34] Amen. They've got It's the second It's
[1:10:37] the second uh person of the Godhead
[1:10:40] praying to the first person of the
[1:10:42] Godhead.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Well, if the second person of the
[1:10:45] Godhead has to pray to the first person
[1:10:47] of the Godhead, I'd say let's do away
[1:10:49] with the second person of the Godhead.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; I want I just want to go straight to the
[1:10:53] top. Hallelujah. Let's go straight to
[1:10:55] the top. But you see, it wasn't the
[1:10:57] second person of the Godhead. It was the
[1:11:00] humanity. It was the vessel. It was the
[1:11:04] body in which the first person, the only
[1:11:07] person, the ultimate God lived in.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And the man Jesus had to pray for the
[1:11:16] father that dwelt in him to have his
[1:11:19] will in him.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And he had to pray often. Jesus had to
[1:11:25] pray often. The Bible says Jesus often,
[1:11:29] Amen, uh uh uh stole away to himself
[1:11:32] early of the mornings and would spend
[1:11:34] time in prayer. Why? Because he's a man.
[1:11:37] He says, "I do nothing except the father
[1:11:39] first show me." What was he doing? He
[1:11:42] wanted the will of God in his life. I
[1:11:45] think that should be an example for
[1:11:46] every one of us. I want the will of God
[1:11:48] in my life. If God says his spirit is in
[1:11:51] me and I have become the expression of
[1:11:53] God on the earth, then God let me be the
[1:11:56] perfect expression. Let my will be
[1:11:59] surrendered to your will. Jesus had a
[1:12:03] will that was contrary to God's will.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Nevertheless, not my will
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; but thy will."
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to go to Calvary.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; He was a man.
[1:12:21] But he was an expression.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; That form wasn't expected. Have you
[1:12:28] thought about it? Jesus appeared in the
[1:12:31] most holy city, Jerusalem,
[1:12:33] among God's most holy chosen people, the
[1:12:37] Jews.
[1:12:39] Hallelujah.
[1:12:40] He come to those who worshiped him. And
[1:12:44] John 1:14 says, "The Word was made flesh
[1:12:48] and dwelt among us, and we beheld his
[1:12:53] glory."
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; And and and yet the Bible says there in
[1:12:57] John 1:10, he was in the world, and the
[1:13:00] world was made by him, and the world
[1:13:04] knew him not.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; He came to his own, and his own received
[1:13:11] him not.
[1:13:14] Now, God had already been building when
[1:13:16] he appeared. When he when he appeared to
[1:13:19] Abraham, form of a man.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? When he appeared,
[1:13:26] Amen. to Moses, the form of a man. When
[1:13:30] he appeared in the fiery furnace, the
[1:13:32] form of a man. When they saw the vision
[1:13:34] of of one sitting on the throne, it was
[1:13:36] in the form of a man. And when the man
[1:13:39] Christ Jesus came,
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They rejected him
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; because they did not like
[1:13:47] his form
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Did you know that God that that that God
[1:13:54] is always progressive?
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; That God Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Now man
[1:14:02] man man likes when Jesus came they said
[1:14:05] we we follow the God of Moses.
[1:14:10] Moses is our prophet.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And he said, "If you believed Moses,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; you would understand who I am.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; For Moses declared who I all of the Old
[1:14:24] Testament oracles, all of that in in
[1:14:26] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and
[1:14:29] Deuteronomy. All of that was pointing to
[1:14:32] a future expression. It was pointing to
[1:14:36] a future. But you see, you are back in
[1:14:40] that other form. And here I am in the
[1:14:44] expression that I have promised to
[1:14:47] reveal myself in. And you can't see me.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:59] I wonder today
[1:15:02] if we don't see the expression
[1:15:05] and truly identify with that expression,
[1:15:11] if we could only understand that within
[1:15:13] your sick body
[1:15:19] is the logos
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; and why God is living in your sick body
[1:15:27] and chose your inability
[1:15:30] because he's wanting to express himself
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; as healer.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Now, I I I preached here a couple couple
[1:15:40] weeks back on the right thoughts,
[1:15:42] thinking the right way, having the mind
[1:15:44] of God within you. And this is where I
[1:15:46] thought I would just go a little bit
[1:15:47] further because if you don't choose the
[1:15:49] thoughts of deity, if you don't choose,
[1:15:52] and this is the where Jesus had to say,
[1:15:54] who was in the form of God, thought it
[1:15:57] not robbery to be equal with God, but
[1:16:00] become the form of a servant. Amen.
[1:16:03] After the fashion of a man, amen. I want
[1:16:06] to say today, you are predestinated to
[1:16:10] be conformed to that word image. So
[1:16:12] though you are in the form of a man,
[1:16:16] there is the form of the logos on the
[1:16:19] inside of you that is taking your body
[1:16:22] back to Eden again, taking you back to
[1:16:26] perfection again, taking you back to
[1:16:29] deity again, taking you back. You've got
[1:16:32] to see the form of God in you.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; You see, amen. Amen.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; That's why I say you got to watch what
[1:16:44] you're talking about.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; You got to watch what you're what you
[1:16:49] think about. You got to watch what you
[1:16:52] entertain.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't entertain spirits.
[1:16:57] You entertain God in the form that he's
[1:17:01] in.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; And he's in his bride.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:11] Now, the Jews couldn't understand him.
[1:17:15] They didn't see him. They knew him not.
[1:17:18] But yet, First John 1 and1, and I I I
[1:17:22] like this. I've I've used this a lot
[1:17:23] lately. That which was from the
[1:17:25] beginning, which we heard and which our
[1:17:29] eyes seen, which we have looked upon and
[1:17:32] our hands have handled of the word of
[1:17:35] life.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; See, they were rejecting. But yet here's
[1:17:40] one the elect that was saying the word
[1:17:43] of life. We've slept with him. We've ate
[1:17:47] with him. We've the form that God was
[1:17:52] living in. We were there. Can you say
[1:17:55] amen? Amen. Hopefully I'm not too
[1:17:59] scattered this morning, but the farm
[1:18:01] Hallelujah. When I look upon you, Amen.
[1:18:04] I want to say a my hands have handled.
[1:18:07] Amen. My ears have heard. I have looked
[1:18:11] upon God's form. Can you say amen? Oh
[1:18:16] yes. It's not the form of a prophet.
[1:18:19] It's the form of the bride. Amen. They
[1:18:23] are the ones that have been called out.
[1:18:26] You are the ones that God says, "I'm
[1:18:29] going to rapture and manifest my glory
[1:18:32] through."
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:38] Now, there was no one twisting the arms
[1:18:41] of the early church,
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; but Jesus would just pass by and call
[1:18:46] them and they would respond.
[1:18:51] Amen. Bible says there in in Matthew
[1:18:54] 4:18, he he came by Peter and Andrew and
[1:18:58] casting their nets and
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and he just simply says,
[1:19:02] "Follow me."
[1:19:05] And the Bible says
[1:19:07] straightway
[1:19:09] they dropped their nets and followed
[1:19:12] him.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; James and John. Amen. There in the 21st
[1:19:16] verse of the same chapter. Amen. There
[1:19:19] he was. And the Bible says they were
[1:19:21] mending their nets and he called them
[1:19:24] and they immediately left the ship
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; and their father and followed him.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Then he comes up and they Amen. uh there
[1:19:34] there in in the 21st verse or or no
[1:19:37] Matthew 9 and9 he comes up and he says
[1:19:41] you know he saw a man named Matthew
[1:19:43] sitting at the receipt of custom and he
[1:19:46] saidf follow me and he arose and
[1:19:49] followed him
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; there was a predestinated
[1:19:54] seed on the inside that see the
[1:19:56] expression of God
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; and that was something that would be
[1:20:00] there oh can you say and he arose and
[1:20:03] followed.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Now, there were plenty others, amen,
[1:20:07] that would say, "I want to follow you,
[1:20:08] too."
[1:20:10] Luke 9 27 to or or 57-62 would talk
[1:20:14] about it. Amen. And and and and they
[1:20:17] would say, "Let let me follow you
[1:20:19] wherever you go." I I I I I see
[1:20:21] something. I I see the They were
[1:20:23] attracted by the supernatural. They were
[1:20:25] attracted by They weren't attracted by
[1:20:27] his words. They were attracted Amen. by
[1:20:30] the form in which God was being
[1:20:32] expressed in. They fell in love with the
[1:20:34] form. A Amen. And and he said, "Listen,
[1:20:37] if you follow me, foxes have dens, birds
[1:20:40] have nests, but the son of man has no
[1:20:42] place to go. I have no place that I I
[1:20:45] can even lay my head." Amen. He says,
[1:20:48] "Come follow me." Amen. And it's all in
[1:20:50] those verses right there. He says, one
[1:20:52] says, "Oh, well, let me go bury the
[1:20:54] dead." He says, "Let the dead bury their
[1:20:55] own dead." Amen. And the other one says,
[1:20:58] "Well, I I need to get married and I've
[1:21:00] got to take care of this." He says,
[1:21:01] "What are you talking about?" Amen. He
[1:21:02] done three or four of them sitting right
[1:21:04] there. But you see, there was God being
[1:21:07] expressed and the elect was saying, "Let
[1:21:10] me let me be a part of what you are
[1:21:15] doing."
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. The perfect expression of the
[1:21:22] perfect essence. This expression of God
[1:21:26] was not something from without. He
[1:21:28] wasn't pressured or persuaded from an
[1:21:30] outside force. Jesus proceeded from the
[1:21:34] very depths of his person. God was
[1:21:38] savior at heart. He was the most holiest
[1:21:41] of his of his divine attributes being
[1:21:44] expressed. love, the very bond of
[1:21:47] perfectness, divine holiness, mercy was
[1:21:50] being expressed through Christ when he
[1:21:52] laid down his life and he proceeded from
[1:21:55] the very depths of that perfect being
[1:21:58] and that great eternal logos, the
[1:22:00] creator of all things come in the form
[1:22:02] of a man to redeem man so that he could
[1:22:06] live within. Someone should shout
[1:22:09] hallelujah.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As light comes from fire and
[1:22:17] thirst is quenched from water. Well,
[1:22:19] praise the Lord. Amen. So is it when
[1:22:23] that eternal essence of God comes on the
[1:22:26] inside of you, you the He's the light of
[1:22:29] the world and you become the light.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; You give you you. He doesn't come in you
[1:22:34] and then you become a man of the example
[1:22:37] of depression and discourage and
[1:22:39] sickness. No, I'm the light of the
[1:22:42] world. And you become the light of the
[1:22:44] world. The expression that is being
[1:22:47] expressed through me. I am mercy. I am
[1:22:51] compassionate. I am am the very
[1:22:54] heartbeat of God. So will you become
[1:22:58] because the logos is living in you.
[1:23:07] I know some of us are we we're all born
[1:23:10] different.
[1:23:12] Some of us are born melancholy.
[1:23:16] Some of us
[1:23:18] Amen. There's there's there's the four
[1:23:21] prime personalities that that one of us
[1:23:24] that we exist. Some of us have all four.
[1:23:30] Amen. We We're all born with with with
[1:23:33] that. There's those that's got the drive
[1:23:35] to take part and you ain't going to
[1:23:36] listen, he ain't going to follow you on
[1:23:37] nothing unless you can convince him
[1:23:40] around way that it's his idea, then it's
[1:23:43] going to go and you got to and you got
[1:23:45] to deal with that. I mean, this guy is
[1:23:47] is he's he's
[1:23:49] hallelujah going to do his own thing.
[1:23:51] God built him that way.
[1:23:54] There's there's the others that just
[1:23:57] have the limelight. They got to dress
[1:23:59] nice. They got to look nice. Amen. and
[1:24:03] and they're going to just walk outside
[1:24:05] there and they might not have a dime to
[1:24:07] their name, but they'll walk out there
[1:24:09] and they'll just look like I've got it
[1:24:11] put together.
[1:24:13] Amen. That's a lot of those guys are
[1:24:18] poets. A lot of those guys are Amen.
[1:24:20] that they're they're just expressive.
[1:24:22] Got to express. Then there's the other
[1:24:24] kind that's just really quiet. Amen. And
[1:24:28] man, he wants to he wants to be in the
[1:24:31] in the circle, but man, he's just he
[1:24:34] wants to do something, but and don't
[1:24:36] ever ask that person to lead something
[1:24:38] because they'll just fall apart, wet
[1:24:40] their pants, everything right there.
[1:24:41] Amen. And it's and it's not who they
[1:24:44] are. That's the way God made them.
[1:24:48] There's going to be are you that this is
[1:24:49] the this is the human anatomy. This is
[1:24:52] who we are. Amen. We're we're we're
[1:24:55] born. But when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:24:58] into us, we are no longer dependent on
[1:25:02] our personality, it's the word of God,
[1:25:05] the living Christ within us. Are are you
[1:25:09] hearing me? And then what does it do? It
[1:25:11] makes us all flow in together. It brings
[1:25:14] well, praise the Lord.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a person that is all that that
[1:25:19] is that is naturally uh born negative,
[1:25:22] Amen. That person is going to have a
[1:25:25] choice whether they are going to express
[1:25:28] their negative self or they're going to
[1:25:32] express the deity of Christ.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; It's their choice. Can you say amen?
[1:25:38] That's the reason why the Apostle Paul
[1:25:40] says, "I died daily. I died daily."
[1:25:44] That's why Jesus said, "Unless you take
[1:25:46] up your cross and follow after me,
[1:25:50] you're not worthy of me. You've got to
[1:25:53] die to your personal uh uh uh yourself.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; So that one that's just constantly
[1:26:02] negative can't say nothing good about
[1:26:04] nothing. I mean it could be someone give
[1:26:06] them a th and and and and instead of
[1:26:08] just saying thank you, there's got to be
[1:26:10] some kind of nonsense out of their
[1:26:13] mouth.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; What form are you expressing?
[1:26:22] On the other hand, there's that one
[1:26:23] that's meek and mild. And the one that's
[1:26:25] more meek and quiet and mild. That one
[1:26:28] there is is the one that's going to
[1:26:30] fight a whole lot of complexes. I'm not
[1:26:34] loved. I'm not good enough. I'm not
[1:26:39] that no one likes me. That well, praise
[1:26:42] the Lord. And there's some of you that
[1:26:44] are in this building that that that have
[1:26:45] to fight those thoughts.
[1:26:49] But you're not to express. This is the
[1:26:52] beautiful thing. Jesus
[1:26:55] was the was the germ seed of God born
[1:26:58] from a virgin birth. But yet he still
[1:27:03] had to be filled with the Holy Ghost at
[1:27:05] the River Jordan.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Now I want I want you to hear me. But
[1:27:13] the the purpose for the perfect form,
[1:27:16] the purpose for the for the form of
[1:27:18] deity, the the in a body, the purpose
[1:27:22] was for redemption so that you in your
[1:27:27] current form, in your current
[1:27:29] personality, God would raise you up and
[1:27:33] express himself through the body of the
[1:27:37] redeemed.
[1:27:40] [Applause]
[1:27:42] See, some of us with the with the with
[1:27:45] the with a big personality and take
[1:27:47] charge, we look to the ones that that
[1:27:50] struggle. Maybe they're a little more
[1:27:52] quiet and they fight their mind battles
[1:27:53] and we look at them as if they're a
[1:27:56] no.
[1:27:58] Listen,
[1:27:59] but I'm not going to pick on the guy
[1:28:02] because that, you know, the guy that's
[1:28:03] that's just he's got to constantly say
[1:28:06] sorry. Now, now the quiet one says sorry
[1:28:08] in their mind all the time. Anyways,
[1:28:10] they're just sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
[1:28:12] for living. Sorry for this, sorry for
[1:28:13] that. Oops, didn't mean to. Sorry,
[1:28:14] sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Hallelujah.
[1:28:16] But but then the other guy that's the
[1:28:18] big tick charge guy. Amen. He's making a
[1:28:21] big doofus of himself half the time and
[1:28:23] he has to say sorry.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; What am I getting at? What I'm saying is
[1:28:29] there is no in any any of these
[1:28:32] personalities that we have. There is
[1:28:35] none of them. We're just like Abraham
[1:28:38] and Sarah. God had to come to those who
[1:28:42] could not produce it
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; because it had to be God's word taken
[1:28:50] for in an old man, an old woman who was
[1:28:53] never able to have children.
[1:29:00] So God chooses us with all of our and I
[1:29:03] say personality flaws
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; because each one of us look at ourselves
[1:29:09] and we think that we're just the biggest
[1:29:11] doofus around half the time.
[1:29:14] And yet God takes that form redeemed
[1:29:18] form
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; that redeemed form.
[1:29:25] Behold, I send. Listen to the text.
[1:29:29] Behold, I send to you, Elijah
[1:29:34] the prophet,
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; and he will turn your hearts
[1:29:41] back to the purpose of the logos.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; He will turn your hearts back to the
[1:29:49] faith of the fathers. He's got one
[1:29:52] purpose to tell you, you have a place in
[1:29:57] the kingdom of God.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; And that as his word takes form in you,
[1:30:06] well, praise the Lord.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; There's some there's some that as soon
[1:30:09] as they get a little cough,
[1:30:12] oh, oh,
[1:30:15] I've got laryngitis.
[1:30:18] Oh. Oh.
[1:30:21] And then you start thinking about that
[1:30:22] and then that thought begins to take you
[1:30:25] to another feeling that you had that
[1:30:28] you've always had
[1:30:30] but your mind didn't let you but all of
[1:30:32] a sudden your mind starts playing and
[1:30:34] you got this and you got that you got
[1:30:35] this and right
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; whereas that's the reason the scripture
[1:30:42] or the the prophet would say the right
[1:30:44] mental attitude will bring all of God's
[1:30:46] promises and the right confession
[1:30:49] Passion will bring your body in line
[1:30:54] with the word
[1:30:57] [Applause]
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; because deity is expressing itself in
[1:31:04] another form.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; I I I think I think this is powerful
[1:31:11] because my the form that I'm in, God has
[1:31:15] redeemed me.
[1:31:17] He's redeemed my soul, but he's left me
[1:31:20] right here
[1:31:24] with me.
[1:31:26] I wish he would have saved me and then
[1:31:28] put me in a another body,
[1:31:33] but he saves me and leaves me with my
[1:31:36] biggest enemy,
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; me.
[1:31:43] But the beautiful part is it's another
[1:31:46] form of God
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; expressing himself
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; through Abraham and Sarah expressing
[1:31:54] himself through a through a a a
[1:31:59] helpless Hebrew children expressing
[1:32:03] himself through through a a a prophet
[1:32:06] that has no power to deliver himself
[1:32:08] from a lion's den expressing himself oh
[1:32:10] church of the living God expressing
[1:32:13] himself. Are you understanding? Amen.
[1:32:15] And so he takes I say today the church
[1:32:18] the church thinks it not robbery though
[1:32:21] we're in this body in this flesh this
[1:32:24] word has been placed in my heart and I'm
[1:32:28] standing up and said I am the redeemed.
[1:32:33] [Applause]
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:32:41] a body hast thou prepared?
[1:32:44] When ye come into the world, sacrifices
[1:32:47] and offerings thou wouldest not have,
[1:32:50] but a body thou hast. Can you say amen?
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Now, if God is still yet revealing
[1:32:55] himself in this form there in 1
[1:32:58] Corinthians 12 and 27,
[1:33:01] you are the body of Christ and members
[1:33:03] in particular. 1 Corinthians 12:12, "For
[1:33:07] as the body is one and hath many
[1:33:08] members, and all the members of that one
[1:33:10] body, being many, are one body, so also
[1:33:13] is Christ. For by one spirit are we
[1:33:16] baptized into one body, whether we be
[1:33:19] Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
[1:33:21] free, and have been made to drink into
[1:33:23] that one spirit." So what he what what
[1:33:25] what he's saying is you are that body.
[1:33:29] It is God now worshiping with his
[1:33:32] people. It's not God's not wanting to be
[1:33:35] the object of worship. God is wanting to
[1:33:37] worship with his people. And you could
[1:33:40] see that in the throughout the
[1:33:42] scripture. Amen. There there as he a as
[1:33:45] he uh John 14:17. Even the spirit of
[1:33:48] truth and the world cannot receive
[1:33:50] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[1:33:52] him. But you know him for he dwells with
[1:33:56] you and shall be in you. I will not
[1:34:01] leave you comfortless. I will come. Who
[1:34:03] is doing the talking?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; It's the logos.
[1:34:09] It's the spirit of God.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The world sees me no
[1:34:16] more, but you see me. And because I
[1:34:18] live, you shall live also. And in that
[1:34:22] day they shall know that I'm in my
[1:34:25] father and ye in me and I in you. It
[1:34:29] will be God worshiping among his people.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; You say, "I I can't I can't accept that.
[1:34:36] You're you're just bringing God down.
[1:34:38] You're you're bringing God down right to
[1:34:39] our level." No, it's God bringing you up
[1:34:43] to
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; his level.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; They couldn't see it. They couldn't see
[1:34:50] it. But yet Psalms 2020 22:22, this is
[1:34:55] talking about Jesus. Amen. It was a
[1:34:57] logos. I will declare thy name unto my
[1:35:00] brethren, and in the midst of the
[1:35:02] congregation
[1:35:04] will I praise thee.
[1:35:08] Psalms 22:25, my praise shall be of thee
[1:35:13] in the great congregation. And I, this
[1:35:15] is logos, this is this is the logos
[1:35:17] speaking the great pillar of fire. And I
[1:35:19] will pay my vows
[1:35:22] before them that fear thee. Isaiah 8:18.
[1:35:26] Behold, I and the children whom the Lord
[1:35:29] hath given me are for signs and wonders
[1:35:33] in Israel for the Lord of hosts which
[1:35:35] dwelleth in Mount Zion. Now, there's
[1:35:38] some of you that might be saying that
[1:35:39] has nothing to do. You're trying to make
[1:35:42] the Apostle Paul brings it in right here
[1:35:44] in and he takes all three of these all
[1:35:46] three of these scriptures here. Hebrews
[1:35:48] 2 and 11. For both he that sanctifith
[1:35:50] and they who are sanctified are all of
[1:35:52] one. For which cause he is not ashamed
[1:35:55] to call them brethren, saying, I will
[1:35:58] declare thy name unto my brethren in the
[1:36:02] midst of the church will I sing praise
[1:36:05] unto thee. And again, I will put my
[1:36:08] trust in him. Talking about God, the
[1:36:11] whole God. This is talking about that
[1:36:13] great pillar of fire living in you. And
[1:36:16] again, I will put my trust in him. And
[1:36:19] again, behold, I and the children which
[1:36:22] God has given me. For as much as the
[1:36:24] children are partakers of flesh and
[1:36:26] blood, he also likewise took part of the
[1:36:29] same, that through death he might
[1:36:31] destroy him that had the power of death,
[1:36:33] that is the devil.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Don't you love that?
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Let this mind be in you. What mind?
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:49] He that was in the form of God
[1:36:52] says, "Listen, I'm willing to put that
[1:36:53] all aside to take on a body
[1:36:57] to be an expression
[1:36:59] so in turn they can put on my mind and
[1:37:04] become an expression
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; of greatness."
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. That one that is on the
[1:37:10] inside of you is the voice is the same
[1:37:14] voice that was walking in the Garden of
[1:37:15] Eden. That one that was on the inside of
[1:37:18] you was the one that was screaming,
[1:37:19] "Wait, wait. I can't let you go." And
[1:37:22] that great funnel of love came back
[1:37:24] down. And God provided a remedy. It was
[1:37:27] that same one inside of you that came
[1:37:31] making the provisions.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; So that he could have this form.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, Jesus wasn't the first form
[1:37:41] of the logos. The logos was there in the
[1:37:43] beginning, that great pillar of fire. He
[1:37:44] comes down all through these other
[1:37:46] things. But his goal, his desire. Oh my.
[1:37:50] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham, when he
[1:37:51] would talk about Jesus, Amen. The
[1:37:53] prophecy, he says, he says he he Jesus
[1:37:56] was the answer of the prophet's
[1:37:58] prophecy. Here he comes riding on the f
[1:38:00] of an ass. What an attraction. God was
[1:38:03] fulfilling his promised word. The hour
[1:38:05] had been waiting for 4,000 years. Amen.
[1:38:08] Well, can you say? Amen. It was the
[1:38:10] presence of God that had an effect upon
[1:38:13] him that brought about the deliverance.
[1:38:15] And I just want to say today, amen, on
[1:38:17] the day of Pentecost, Jesus, the living
[1:38:19] word, was waved over the people. Amen.
[1:38:22] That Christ, that living word was laid.
[1:38:24] He had paid the price of redemption. He
[1:38:27] had cleared the way, amen, for that
[1:38:29] great pillar of fire to not just live in
[1:38:32] a form of Jesus, but now is living in
[1:38:35] the form of his bride. He paved that
[1:38:38] way. Hallelujah. So all men and women
[1:38:42] could come to him. He was waved over.
[1:38:45] Waved at the day of Pentecost when there
[1:38:47] came a sound from heaven like a waving
[1:38:50] mighty rushing wind. And the way he was
[1:38:52] waved over the people, the Pentecostal
[1:38:54] people that was raised up at Pentecost
[1:38:56] waiting for the blessing to come and to
[1:38:58] be waved again. We realize in the last
[1:39:01] day according to Luke 17:30 in the
[1:39:05] Sunday again in the day when the sen of
[1:39:08] man will be revealed or waved over the
[1:39:11] people. Who is that son of man in the
[1:39:14] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:39:16] with God. The word was God and the word
[1:39:20] was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; That's the word that's being waved over
[1:39:24] the people. If all the teaching that we
[1:39:27] have and the confirmation of the word of
[1:39:29] God by the word of God by signs by
[1:39:32] wonders we see in the book of Luke here
[1:39:35] that we've just quoted Luke 17 and 30
[1:39:37] Malachi 4 and the different scriptures
[1:39:39] that we are acquainted with that word
[1:39:42] again is waved over the people that the
[1:39:45] dead traditions of men is dead. The son
[1:39:48] of God is alive again with the baptism
[1:39:52] of the Holy Spirit right among us giving
[1:39:54] us life. And as Christ was the first one
[1:39:57] to raise from the prophets and so forth,
[1:40:00] although typed in many places, he was
[1:40:02] the first fruits of those that slept. In
[1:40:04] the bride coming of Christ coming out of
[1:40:07] the church, there will be a sheath waved
[1:40:10] again in the last days. Waving of the
[1:40:13] sheath. What was the sheath? The first
[1:40:16] one to come to mature. The first one
[1:40:19] that proved it was a wheat. That proved
[1:40:21] it was a sheath.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; The first one.
[1:40:34] Yeah. The first one. So if he says
[1:40:38] there's a first one,
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; then there's got to be a second one
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; and a third one.
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Are y'all hearing me?
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Because there's some more sons and
[1:40:53] daughters of God
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; right here that he's going to live
[1:40:57] through.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, "Hallelujah. I'm
[1:41:01] sure you see what I'm talking about." It
[1:41:02] was waved over the people in the first
[1:41:04] time. There will come forth a for the
[1:41:07] bright age for a resurrection out of
[1:41:09] denom dark denomination will be a
[1:41:11] message with the full maturity of the
[1:41:14] word has turned back again in its power.
[1:41:18] Someone shout hallelujah. Behold I send
[1:41:21] you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn
[1:41:24] your hearts your hearts. The word has
[1:41:27] already been spoken about there's going
[1:41:28] to come a bride. There's been churches
[1:41:31] churches. brides, brides, but there is
[1:41:33] one that is coming that will not fail,
[1:41:35] will not fall. Are y'all hearing me? It
[1:41:38] doesn't mean that we're all going to be
[1:41:39] born perfect. No. We're going to be
[1:41:41] living in the worst of the ages. We're
[1:41:43] going to be living the worst of times.
[1:41:45] We're going to be fighting the worst of
[1:41:47] the devils, but there's going to come
[1:41:50] one that will not fail. Why? She's found
[1:41:54] her identity. She is the form of the
[1:41:57] logos. She is the manifestation of the
[1:42:00] son of man. She is that living word
[1:42:05] in flesh.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If God can so
[1:42:13] take a prophet
[1:42:15] and so declare his word and his counsel
[1:42:18] through the divine words,
[1:42:21] I believe all of this message is right.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Every bit of it.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why did God have to come in
[1:42:29] the revealing of the son of man and not
[1:42:31] just the baptism of the Holy Ghost?
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:42:36] Because there had to be a perfect
[1:42:37] church.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be a church
[1:42:41] without spot, wrinkle, or blemish that
[1:42:44] is going to make the rapture.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; So, a perfect essence
[1:42:52] through the form of a prophet.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:56] So that the words God God ain't going to
[1:42:58] speak any other way.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he has a five-fold
[1:43:03] ministry." He sure does.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; He sure does. And the five-fold ministry
[1:43:09] better line what they're saying up with
[1:43:12] what God has given to us through that
[1:43:14] seventh angel message.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If there come anybody that
[1:43:20] tries to say, "Well, no, no, we don't
[1:43:21] believe it that way or we don't believe
[1:43:23] it that way." No. All it takes is one
[1:43:25] word.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; One word. We We want the whole book.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Someone say, "Give me the whole book."
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; I want the full revelation. I want the
[1:43:36] full manifestation. I only the full
[1:43:40] revelation will give you the full
[1:43:43] manifestation.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew who he was and therefore
[1:43:48] he had faith. And when you know who you
[1:43:51] are, therefore you have faith. Let the
[1:43:55] sick say, "I am holy."
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Let the weak say, "I am strong."
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Let the discouraged say, "I am the bride
[1:44:07] of Jesus Christ."
[1:44:11] Declare the full counsel of God.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:44:19] Hallelujah.
[1:44:21] Hallelujah.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Now, when God raised Jesus from the
[1:44:24] dead,
[1:44:27] it would have been a lot easier for him.
[1:44:30] Amen.
[1:44:32] You know, to just let him
[1:44:35] to do something without without him
[1:44:38] being dead for three days.
[1:44:41] But it took a miracle to take that cold,
[1:44:44] stiff
[1:44:47] body that cold, stiff form
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; that God had used. It took a miracle for
[1:44:54] him to raise him up at the third day.
[1:45:00] Someone says, "I just don't see how I
[1:45:03] just don't see how we're going to make
[1:45:06] this rapture. I don't see how. It looks
[1:45:09] so impossible."
[1:45:11] But he says on the third day, after
[1:45:13] three days I will after two days and in
[1:45:16] the third day I will raise them up. And
[1:45:20] here we are. Hallelujah. We have come.
[1:45:23] We have come through. Are you hearing
[1:45:25] me? We're at the end of the season in
[1:45:28] this third day we are living in. There
[1:45:31] has been a promise that miracle power is
[1:45:35] going to kick into that form. And that
[1:45:37] form is not going to be a dead form, but
[1:45:39] it's going to be a living form.
[1:45:42] Hallelujah. The bride is going to come
[1:45:43] into her ministry. Oh, church of the
[1:45:46] living God. Amen. I I I I I I wish I was
[1:45:50] a better preacher. I wish that I could
[1:45:53] Amen. uh uh put things out there more
[1:45:55] clearer. But I guarantee you one thing
[1:45:57] here. If I'll just be faithful and be
[1:45:59] the voice that God has asked me to be,
[1:46:01] or not the voice, I'm not even the
[1:46:03] voice.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; I'm just the microphone. Amen.
[1:46:07] Reflecting the seventh angel's voice
[1:46:10] that has come to declare that says you
[1:46:13] don't have to be in the old dead form.
[1:46:17] God's chosen your form to reveal himself
[1:46:20] through.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:26] Now he says that's what he's proved.
[1:46:29] Hallelujah. Ether proved
[1:46:32] he wasn't only the word
[1:46:35] but he was God himself. the dynamics in
[1:46:37] the word that made the body of Jesus
[1:46:40] cold, stiff, dead and in the grave,
[1:46:43] shaken to life and rise again and roll
[1:46:45] away the stone. I am he that was dead.
[1:46:48] So dead till the sun said he was dead.
[1:46:51] The moon said he was dead. The stars
[1:46:53] said he was dead. All nature said he was
[1:46:55] dead. And now the whole world has to
[1:46:57] recognize he is alive again.
[1:47:01] Where's he at? Where's he at? He's alive
[1:47:04] again. Where's he at? He says he's not
[1:47:07] only the mechanics, God's word. He was
[1:47:10] the dynamics to prove it. And as he
[1:47:12] being the groom, the bride has to go
[1:47:15] come forth
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; cuz it's part of him. It can only be the
[1:47:19] manifestation. Someone says the
[1:47:21] manifestation
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; of the fulfilling of the revelations.
[1:47:28] Are you understanding? It's got to be
[1:47:31] the manifestation
[1:47:33] of the revelation. The revelation had to
[1:47:37] come in order for there to be a
[1:47:38] manifestation. That's why we come to
[1:47:40] church every as much as we do. That's
[1:47:43] why we're doing these things. Why? We We
[1:47:45] just got to keep hitting it and keep on
[1:47:46] hitting it and keep on hitting it.
[1:47:48] Hallelujah. And we got to keep on
[1:47:49] preaching it and preaching it and
[1:47:51] preaching it. And you know, every time
[1:47:52] I'm doing that, you know what I'm doing?
[1:47:54] I am declaring that revealed word, that
[1:47:59] open book. I'm declaring that over you.
[1:48:02] It's a declaration. As there has been an
[1:48:06] open book, there shall also be a bride.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; There shall also be a bride. Well, glory
[1:48:13] to God. He's not looking at you. He's
[1:48:15] looking at the sacrifice. Amen. He's
[1:48:17] looking. He has declared you the form in
[1:48:21] which he wants to declare his word.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Now it can only be the manifestation of
[1:48:29] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:48:30] any others has spoke of the bride. It
[1:48:32] can only manifest if it does something
[1:48:35] different from the groom. It isn't the
[1:48:37] bride because she is flesh of his flesh,
[1:48:40] bone of his bone, life of his life,
[1:48:44] power of his power. She is him.
[1:48:48] Someone say I am him.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; I
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; when he takes on that form, the form
[1:48:59] becomes synonymous with the one that is
[1:49:03] living within it.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus becomes synonymous. He was only
[1:49:09] here for 33 years, but Jesus is forever
[1:49:11] synonymous
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; with that logos. Amen.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; And when the word comes to you and comes
[1:49:19] in you, you become that living
[1:49:22] manifestation. If the musicians would
[1:49:23] come.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; She is flesh of his flesh, bone of his
[1:49:31] bone, life of his life, power of his
[1:49:33] power. Yes.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; As a man and woman are one and the woman
[1:49:37] taken from his side. She has had and has
[1:49:41] and taken a spirit the feminine spirit
[1:49:43] from him. The flesh from his side both
[1:49:46] mechanics and dynamics the wife. The
[1:49:48] spirit of him and the flesh of him put
[1:49:51] it together and it's made the mechanics
[1:49:53] and the dynamics.
[1:49:55] Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] He says, "How can good man do anything
[1:49:59] else besides the power that has been
[1:50:01] released to them?
[1:50:04] He said, "I'm going to set up a box up
[1:50:05] here to represent that." And if God
[1:50:07] sends a certain spirit among them,
[1:50:09] that's the only thing that they can work
[1:50:11] by is the spirit that works among them.
[1:50:16] And we'll prove that through the by the
[1:50:18] church history and by the opening of the
[1:50:19] seals and the power that let loose.
[1:50:22] Watch exactly that the church
[1:50:27] responded to the anointing and they
[1:50:30] could not do they couldn't do nothing
[1:50:34] else.
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:42] They become so wrapped up the Holy
[1:50:44] Spirit with them. They become so much at
[1:50:46] one that they could not do anything but
[1:50:49] reflect him.
[1:50:54] [Music]
[1:50:56] Did you see how he put it though
[1:50:58] through the opening of that word? He
[1:51:00] will prove youth by the history by the
[1:51:01] opening of the seals the powers that let
[1:51:03] loose which exactly the church responded
[1:51:06] to the anointing and they couldn't do
[1:51:08] nothing else. They were God's form.
[1:51:13] All right. God bless you.
[1:51:16] [Music]
[1:51:22] Redee
[1:51:25] close.
[1:51:30] Her Lord
[1:51:33] has made.
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:41] He's heard
[1:51:44] voice
[1:51:47] heed
[1:51:49] the call.
[1:51:52] Transformation
[1:51:55] abides in.
[1:52:00] Oh,
[1:52:03] she stand
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:09] clothed
[1:52:11] in righteousness. Oh, glory to God. Her
[1:52:15] Lord
[1:52:17] has made
[1:52:20] her clean.
[1:52:25] She's heard.
[1:52:28] [Music]
[1:52:30] And she's heeded
[1:52:34] the call.
[1:52:36] Transformation
[1:52:39] abides in her soul.
[1:52:45] I stand redeemed. I stand.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:56] Oh
[1:52:58] my Lord
[1:53:00] has made.
[1:53:07] Oh yeah.
[1:53:08] And I've heard
[1:53:12] the voice
[1:53:14] and I've heeded
[1:53:17] the call.
[1:53:19] Transformation
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:23] abides in
[1:53:26] my soul.
[1:53:29] Christ the mystery of God revealed. He
[1:53:30] said the word moves on down into the
[1:53:32] body from the head. What is it? It's the
[1:53:35] same word. Nothing can be added or taken
[1:53:37] from it. So that same word moves from
[1:53:40] the head as the day comes close down
[1:53:43] into the body down into the body
[1:53:47] vindicating that they are one. They are
[1:53:49] husband and wife. They're flesh of his
[1:53:51] flesh. Word of his word, life of his
[1:53:53] life, spirit of his spirit.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. How do you know? It bears the same
[1:54:00] record, the same fruit, the same word.
[1:54:02] It manifests Christ. Same life, same
[1:54:05] God, same spirit, same word, same book,
[1:54:09] same signs, same things that I do shall
[1:54:13] you also. Oh, hallelujah. My notice the
[1:54:16] vindicated word in his body is his very
[1:54:19] victory and the reason of his death. The
[1:54:22] reason for the first form,
[1:54:25] bodily form, was for this last form.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Can you imagine?
[1:54:33] We are just the next step could be
[1:54:36] stepping in to your new body. You just
[1:54:40] don't know how close we are, friends.
[1:54:42] We're we're so close.
[1:54:45] And it's Jesus the logos and logos
[1:54:48] thought of not robbery.
[1:54:51] And I say today, if God is redeemed and
[1:54:53] I am his righteousness, then I'm going
[1:54:56] to declare I am the righteousness of God
[1:54:58] in Christ.
[1:55:04] He's not going to be grumbling through
[1:55:06] me. The Bible says he's going to be
[1:55:09] singing in the midst of the church.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; He's not going to have that old negative
[1:55:14] attitude. Although he is living in your
[1:55:17] flawed redeemed,
[1:55:20] [Laughter]
[1:55:22] but his spirit is so powerful. He's
[1:55:25] already made the He is so He is so
[1:55:28] confident.
[1:55:32] God doesn't have the little man
[1:55:34] syndrome.
[1:55:35] You know what the little man syndrome
[1:55:37] is? You know,
[1:55:40] just got to squawk loud and make people
[1:55:42] feel like
[1:55:44] they've got some authority.
[1:55:47] God is so confident
[1:55:51] that he says every name that is written
[1:55:54] in that book shall somebody say
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; shall
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; be redeemed.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every name. And he says, I
[1:56:06] put that name before the foundation of
[1:56:08] the world. All that the father hath
[1:56:11] given me. the word made flesh
[1:56:16] will come to me and I will not lose them
[1:56:19] one and I will raise them up. That means
[1:56:21] there's going to be some that's going to
[1:56:23] go into a state of impossibility.
[1:56:25] They're going to go down into the ground
[1:56:27] and there ain't going to be nothing left
[1:56:28] of them but a spoonful of dust. But I
[1:56:32] will even go back to that spoonful of
[1:56:35] dust and will raise them up.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; I am that confident.
[1:56:40] I am that confident in my word.
[1:56:44] I And I'm going to declare to you today,
[1:56:47] I am not Amen to declare my my my old
[1:56:52] nature. Hallelujah. And when the Apostle
[1:56:56] Paul says you've got to die daily so
[1:56:58] that you can be raised daily, then so be
[1:57:01] it. God, let me die daily. Let me die
[1:57:05] daily. Let me die to my negative self.
[1:57:08] Let me die. Amen. To to to those uh uh
[1:57:12] uh th those old things around me that
[1:57:14] the the complexes. God, let me die to
[1:57:17] those things. I don't care what I see in
[1:57:19] the mirror or hear in my head. Amen. Or
[1:57:22] even hear from people around me. Don't
[1:57:23] let me don't don't don't don't don't let
[1:57:25] me look at that. I am the image of the
[1:57:27] invisible God. I am the power of the
[1:57:30] invisible God. His live his power, his
[1:57:34] mercy, his glory, his peace lives in me.
[1:57:38] Express that through me, Lord.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Well, can you shout hallelujah?
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed. I am redeemed. I am the
[1:57:49] one that he has called to express his
[1:57:52] glory through.
[1:57:54] How about that song? I I that fast one.
[1:57:58] I am redeemed
[1:58:02] by love divine.
[1:58:05] Oh, glory, glory.
[1:58:09] For Christ is mine
[1:58:13] unto him.
[1:58:16] I now resign.
[1:58:20] Yes, I have been. I have been redeemed.
[1:58:25] Oh, that's the thing that comes out of
[1:58:26] your mouth. I'm redeemed
[1:58:31] by love divine.
[1:58:34] Oh, glory, glory.
[1:58:37] Hey, Christ
[1:58:40] is mine.
[1:58:43] Oh, unto him now. Oh, I now resign. I
[1:58:49] have been. I have been.
[1:58:53] Oh, let's sing it again. Well, I am the
[1:58:59] love divine.
[1:59:01] [Music]
[1:59:02] Oh, glory.
[1:59:04] Oh, glory, glory.
[1:59:09] And unto him
[1:59:13] I now resign.
[1:59:16] Yes, I have been. I have been
[1:59:21] redeemed.
[1:59:29] There's a scripture that says, "And let
[1:59:31] the redeemed of the Lord say so."
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many's ready to say so?
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; I am a son of God,
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; daughter of God. I am the heir to the
[1:59:47] throne.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Well, oh. Oh, now we don't want to take,
[1:59:51] oh, you're making yourself God. He lives
[1:59:53] in your body.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; It's no wonder. Do you all remember
[2:00:05] brother Brandham talking about the
[2:00:07] Reader's Digest
[2:00:09] had and and and being a prophet that
[2:00:12] brother Brandon would even use this
[2:00:14] story was incredible. But he said they
[2:00:16] had the faith healers and and so uh they
[2:00:19] were testing see if see if it was real
[2:00:21] or fake.
[2:00:22] And they had a they had a some kind of a
[2:00:25] meter or detector.
[2:00:27] And they said
[2:00:30] they had these ones that that had been
[2:00:32] going around praying for people.
[2:00:35] And he said when they put their hands
[2:00:37] upon the sick, they said there was a
[2:00:40] light that radiated from the hand into
[2:00:44] the body and they would be healed.
[2:00:50] He says, "Well, that's scriptural for
[2:00:52] that's that great light that I see."
[2:00:56] He lives in you.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; That great pillar of fire is in you. No
[2:01:03] wonder he says, "Lay hands on the sick
[2:01:07] and they will recover."
[2:01:10] The only thing that would keep that away
[2:01:12] is the lack of faith.
[2:01:15] Did you know unbelief is faith in the
[2:01:18] negative form?
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe God can heal you,
[2:01:24] then you believe that the sickness is
[2:01:26] greater.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; You believe the sickness is going to
[2:01:30] take you out. You believe the sickness.
[2:01:32] You can't believe that God can heal
[2:01:34] because you've got too much faith in the
[2:01:36] sickness. Turn it around, son and
[2:01:38] daughter of God. God lives in you.
[2:01:44] Amen. Yes.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Wow. The situations around me are just
[2:01:48] all this and that and the other. Hey,
[2:01:50] turn it around, amateur creator.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Create. Create.
[2:02:00] Can you say amen?
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you.

[2:02:08] Hallelujah.
