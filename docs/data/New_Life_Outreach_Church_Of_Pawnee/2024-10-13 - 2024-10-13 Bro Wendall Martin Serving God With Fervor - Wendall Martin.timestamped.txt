[35:28] on serving God with
[35:30] fervency and um amen um having a fervent
[35:36] heart and I think having a a a fervent
[35:39] heart first of all amen uh if you're
[35:42] going to serve the Lord you you want to
[35:45] you want to know that you're serving the
[35:46] right God you want to know that you're
[35:49] serving a living God a god that is that
[35:52] is very much alive that God that keeps
[35:56] his word amen because uh if you you you
[36:00] can't really put your everything into
[36:02] something that you're not too sure of
[36:05] but God keeps his word God has proven
[36:10] over and over that he keeps his word and
[36:13] so we we look here today amen just
[36:17] looking back through the scripture amen
[36:21] and God keeps his word he he he keeps
[36:23] his word in the in the good he keeps his
[36:26] word in the bad amen he keeps he he
[36:30] he'll he'll keep he'll bless you and
[36:32] then he'll keep his word in a in cursing
[36:35] amen if you walk with him he'll bless
[36:37] you if you disobey him he'll whoop you
[36:40] and and and because God keeps his word
[36:44] amen Now Eve found
[36:46] out that amen that God kept his word
[36:50] amen when God told Adam and Eve don't
[36:52] don't partake of the tree and when the
[36:55] of the fruit of that tree and and and
[36:57] when Satan comes in and said well but
[36:59] surely God knows and then amen and and
[37:02] before you know it he got in he he
[37:05] started reasoning with her but it didn't
[37:08] take long for Eve to to to find out that
[37:12] God will keep his
[37:15] word he's going to keep his word amen uh
[37:20] he'll keep his curses he'll keep his
[37:22] blessings he will keep his word amen
[37:26] Noah found out you know as as the only
[37:29] righteous man amen uh on upon the Earth
[37:32] the Bible said it was was Noah one his
[37:35] family and God proved to Noah that
[37:39] obedience and preparation Amen to the
[37:43] word of God pays off God kept his word
[37:48] even though it was science was saying
[37:50] that there's no rain and and and and the
[37:52] history had proven that there was no
[37:54] rain and and and the scoffers were
[37:57] saying there was no rain but yet God
[38:00] gave his word and said there will be
[38:04] rain and I want you to prepare that Ark
[38:07] amen and when he took God's provided way
[38:11] and preparing that Ark when the rain did
[38:15] come then we find that that Noah was
[38:19] safe and Noah was Secure can you say
[38:22] amen amen God proved his way even to to
[38:25] to Enoch we before the flood came before
[38:28] Noah came God of course we understand
[38:31] that that Noah was was a uh was a type
[38:36] of the of the nominal church it was a
[38:38] type of those that are going to go
[38:40] through the tribulation amen and how
[38:43] that uh H uh God will still have a a a
[38:47] um amen a remedy God will still have
[38:50] those that will come through the
[38:51] tribulation amen but God had provided
[38:54] through Enoch amen provided a rap
[38:57] Rapture for him and proved that there
[39:00] would be a Rapture for the Believers
[39:02] today Amen in the days of Sodom amen
[39:05] Abraham found God to be true I say today
[39:09] that God will prove himself to be true
[39:13] if we are willing to walk with god with
[39:16] a fervent heart can you say amen amen
[39:19] there was there was uh when God came
[39:21] down to Abraham and and he told him he
[39:24] said now Sodom is going to burn amen I I
[39:28] I can't tolerate the sin anymore and and
[39:31] so I'm going to come down amen and and
[39:35] and and and I I'm going to destroy Sodom
[39:38] and Gomorrah amen now now Abraham had
[39:41] been separated from lot and he had been
[39:44] waiting for a promise amen for for a
[39:47] long time uh close to Amen to 25 years
[39:51] at that time and and a and he was
[39:54] waiting and looking but when God came
[39:57] and told him that Sodom was fixing to
[39:59] burn and God kept his word what did it
[40:03] do to Abraham it began to cause an
[40:06] intensity of faith in his heart that if
[40:08] God will keep his word amen concerning
[40:11] the fire fallen in Sodom then he will
[40:14] keep his word concerning the promise of
[40:16] Isaac to me can you say
[40:18] Amen Lot's wife found God's word to be
[40:22] true amen there she she just couldn't
[40:25] put her whole Trust in God as as as as
[40:29] Lot's wife she her heart wasn't in
[40:32] leaving Sodom amen she she loved her
[40:36] position and she loved her the community
[40:40] there and and and the Bible says that
[40:43] she had to turn around and and to look
[40:46] at what she was leaving behind one more
[40:49] time and and the Bible says that she was
[40:51] turned to a pillar of salt amen so God
[40:55] proves his word word to be truth I I I
[40:59] say today that there should be a
[41:02] fervency between you and
[41:04] God if God has proven his word to be
[41:08] true over and over and over then there
[41:11] should be a fervency in the heart of the
[41:13] Believers that Lord I'm going to H H uh
[41:17] uh cling to your word and believe your
[41:20] word because I know you are faithful I
[41:24] think there's too much laxness today
[41:26] amen too much sugarcoated preaching
[41:28] there's too much lukewarm members that
[41:30] that doesn't have the stir of God and
[41:33] the reason for this is they're not
[41:35] thinking upon what God has done what God
[41:38] is doing amen and and the Fulfillment of
[41:41] Prophecy that is taking place right now
[41:44] but I want to tell you there's a lot of
[41:45] Prophecy taking place right now there
[41:47] there's a lot going on in the world
[41:49] today they are getting ready this Earth
[41:53] is getting ready to be burned and as and
[41:55] as Abraham could set there and see the
[41:58] prophecy coming to pass then he can have
[42:00] a hope in his heart to say that I know
[42:04] that my promise is coming to pass too
[42:06] amen that's right Joseph found that God
[42:10] will always prove his word to be true
[42:12] though he went through hell and high
[42:14] water though amen he he he had jealous
[42:17] brothers and amen that that you know and
[42:20] they they stripped him of his coat of
[42:22] many colors but he found out that though
[42:24] they stripped the coat of many colors
[42:26] that the could not strip away the
[42:28] promise amen though he was sold and in
[42:31] prison God kept his word to Joseph and
[42:36] exalted him to Pharaoh's right hand just
[42:39] exactly the way God said he would do it
[42:41] his brothers came and and and and and
[42:44] bowed before him God kept his word can I
[42:48] hear an
[42:50] amen amen God keep his word god kept his
[42:53] a his word to Abraham when he says that
[42:55] you're land you that that you're seed is
[42:57] going to go down amen into into Egypt
[43:00] and amen and and and they're going to be
[43:03] sojourners for 400 years and amen and
[43:06] when the time had come the wicked
[43:08] Pharaoh uh H was killing all of the the
[43:11] children that were two years and under
[43:14] he was anointed of the devil to kill all
[43:17] of those babies two years old and
[43:20] younger amen they would throw him out
[43:22] into the Nile River and and and and the
[43:25] crocodiles would eat them and amen but
[43:27] you see while this was going on God had
[43:32] given a promise of a deliverer and there
[43:36] the the the the deliverer Moses was born
[43:39] now Moses amen was God's predestinated
[43:43] seed he was God's predestinated
[43:44] deliverer and Moses mother looked at
[43:47] that child and said I know that this is
[43:50] the one that God has ordained for this
[43:52] season amen and though everyone is dying
[43:56] amen and then baby's dying and that
[43:58] baby's being killed I believe God has
[44:01] got my child and he's going to you know
[44:03] what I think that we can have that same
[44:05] kind of assurance this morning that our
[44:07] children if God gives us children these
[44:10] are special
[44:11] children amen and they're not they're
[44:14] not going to be destroyed Amen in the in
[44:17] the sins of Leota so what did Moses
[44:20] mother do amen she built a little a
[44:22] little Ark out of bull rushes and then
[44:25] she amen she pitched it with slime a a
[44:28] and she pushed her little baby put it
[44:30] down in it amen and then and then pushed
[44:33] it out into uh the Nile River where the
[44:36] crocodiles were and amen where they had
[44:39] been feeding upon the babies and you
[44:41] know what the Bible said happened amen
[44:43] when that B that that little Ark floated
[44:45] down the river amen God sent that boy
[44:50] right to Pharaoh the cruel-hearted
[44:53] pharaoh's daughter amen and she rescued
[44:57] the child and Pharaoh raised Moses right
[45:00] there in his own
[45:03] Palace God sent Moses the great
[45:07] deliverer amen right to the Palace of of
[45:12] pharaoh was raised him up and then here
[45:15] come amen God's deliverer and and and
[45:18] took uh Israel back to their Homeland
[45:21] God kept his word can I hear a great big
[45:25] amen God kept his word Passover amen
[45:28] when Moses cried out the night before
[45:31] they were to be delivered in Exodus amen
[45:34] and he and he cried out and said the the
[45:36] the death angel is going to is is going
[45:38] to come by tonight amen and I want you
[45:41] to go and and and and and kill a lamb
[45:44] and I I want you to take the blood of
[45:46] that lamb and I want you to put it upon
[45:48] the on the doorpost and upon the l i i i
[45:51] want you to be prepared and I want you
[45:54] to be ready I want your your your your
[45:57] staff to be in hand I want you to have
[45:59] your feet uh shot I I I I want you to be
[46:02] ready to leave because at midnight amen
[46:07] there is coming uh the the death angel
[46:10] and we are fixing to leave amen now as
[46:14] and I want you to be diligent I want you
[46:15] to be ready because you're going to hear
[46:17] the screams of horror and Agony death is
[46:20] going to hit The Young and the old but
[46:22] I'm giving you my word that when the
[46:25] death angel comes that God is going to
[46:29] that Death Angel is going to pass over
[46:31] you and you are going to leave in Mighty
[46:35] power amen oh what it must have been
[46:38] amen when the death angel appeared and
[46:40] the death and the horror and the screams
[46:43] and and and and all of the agony that
[46:45] was coming through the city and through
[46:47] the nation amen what it must have been
[46:51] in their heart the same God that said
[46:54] amen that that the death angel was going
[46:57] to come is also the same God that s to
[47:01] put that blood upon the little and it'll
[47:04] pass over your house amen the same God
[47:07] that gave the promise of judgment is the
[47:11] same God who gave the promise of Victory
[47:15] amen and eternal life I I I say today as
[47:18] we see the the land and the shape that
[47:22] the world is in I say there should be a
[47:25] cry in a heart that God will keep his
[47:30] word oh God's going to keep his word
[47:34] amen God's promised amen that there
[47:36] would be the we was talking to the boys
[47:38] last night that amen that there would be
[47:40] the tidal waves and and the floods amen
[47:44] what what have we just seen even right
[47:46] there in in in North Carolina and and
[47:49] and and and Tennessee and some of these
[47:51] areas that you would never even expected
[47:53] the Bible said in the last days that
[47:56] these floods would come and and and that
[47:59] there would be earthquakes and diverse
[48:01] places when we see these things lift up
[48:04] your head because there's another
[48:06] promise it's a promise of redemption
[48:09] it's a promise of Salvation it's a
[48:11] promise of rapture it's a promise of
[48:14] eternal life can you say
[48:17] Amen
[48:19] now amen so there should be a vigilan in
[48:23] our hearts in this Exodus that we're
[48:26] living in there should be a fervency
[48:29] amen and and the fervency is looking
[48:32] back to what God has done knowing that
[48:35] God's going to fulfill his word even
[48:37] right now where we are at because God
[48:40] has always proved his words to be right
[48:44] amen now as Israel was to roast the Lamb
[48:47] with fire did you realize that fire has
[48:50] always been a part of worship amen fire
[48:53] has always been a part I if you God's a
[48:56] consuming fire is what the scripture
[48:58] says amen that that that he is a a a
[49:01] consuming fire and I amen I've got it u
[49:04] i I've got the scripture here somewhere
[49:07] praise the Lord do you love him here
[49:09] this morning amen that's right so he he
[49:13] is a he is a consuming fire a and and
[49:16] God when he would come to visit the
[49:18] people it was through the pillar of fire
[49:21] and when he come and visited Moses amen
[49:24] it was the great Pillar of Fire that was
[49:26] in a Burning Bush when amen when God
[49:28] appeared to any of the prophets it would
[49:30] be the great Pillar of Fire coming down
[49:33] God is always uh fire is always
[49:36] connected with worship you were to roast
[49:39] the lamb amen it it was uh there's
[49:42] something about the heat of fire there's
[49:45] there's something about God's children
[49:48] who has fervency because fervency is is
[49:52] is is it actually means amen it means
[49:55] hot it means burning it means glowing
[49:59] intense and passionate feeling having or
[50:02] displaying a passionate intensity
[50:05] intensely uh uh enthusiastic or
[50:08] passionate especially uh to an excessive
[50:12] degree so there's something about when
[50:14] the fire of God has touched you and and
[50:18] ignited his Word of Promise within your
[50:20] life it it actually causes something to
[50:24] rise up on the inside of the belie to
[50:27] believe him there is an intensity that
[50:30] comes with that fire when God touches
[50:33] you the Bible says that you are baptized
[50:37] with the Holy Ghost and Fire brother
[50:39] bradam says what would happen was amen
[50:42] the fire would come down and burn the
[50:45] old nature out with the old desires amen
[50:48] it would burn amen all of the old sin
[50:52] and the world and amen the cravings and
[50:54] the desires of sin away way but it would
[50:58] also set your heart of Blaze with the
[51:02] Holy Ghost amen and that Holy Ghost
[51:05] would cause you to do things like you
[51:07] have never done before believe things
[51:10] like you've never believed before do
[51:12] things like you have never done before
[51:15] because it's the supernatural presence
[51:17] of the pillar of fire that is that has
[51:20] come in contact with you there has never
[51:23] been a man who has ever come in contact
[51:25] with that great Pillar of Fire
[51:27] that that has never been the same amen I
[51:29] I want to say today when you come in
[51:32] contact with that great fire of God Amen
[51:36] it does something to a man's heart it
[51:39] does something to a man's mind can you
[51:41] say amen Amen on fire with with with
[51:45] desire Amen brother Brandon would
[51:47] say he would say you know amen that a
[51:50] red hot Christian and a lukewarm
[51:53] Christian can't dwell together amen
[51:55] that's what's the matter today that's
[51:57] what makes the church the way it is
[51:59] we're just getting into that layout of
[52:01] SE in church age amen that's just
[52:03] lukewarm and God said it makes him sick
[52:05] to his stomach he will spew you out of
[52:07] his mouth just enough religion to go out
[52:10] to church and sit there like a wilted
[52:12] flower that's right brother we ought to
[52:15] have an oldfashioned RedHot prayer
[52:19] meeting and a testimony meeting men and
[52:22] women out praying and hous to house work
[52:25] and on the street amen doing something
[52:28] for God we've lost our Zeal we've lost
[52:31] our love we've lost what the things that
[52:33] God has gave us and we've let them slip
[52:37] out of our hands a bunch of so-called we
[52:40] went out after a lot of noise instead of
[52:43] the real oldfashioned gospel Amen in
[52:46] other words there's a lot of formalism
[52:48] amen and formalism whether you're
[52:49] jumping and shouting or or whether
[52:51] you're sitting and amen and and barely
[52:53] can keep your eyes open during the
[52:55] sermon amen for formalism is formalism
[52:58] you see desire comes from the heart
[53:00] burning intense desire Oh Glory to God
[53:04] you can not put your hand next to a fire
[53:06] amen and not know that it's that it's
[53:09] there can you say amen amen you take a
[53:12] child and you let them amen you let them
[53:15] get close enough and let them get their
[53:18] hands burnt you don't have to tell them
[53:19] anymore they have experienced it and I
[53:22] say today that the fire of God the Great
[53:26] pillar you want to know what happened to
[53:28] brother brandham and what caused brother
[53:30] brandham to go and go and give and go
[53:33] and give and go is he come in contact
[53:36] with
[53:37] fire he come in contact amen with the
[53:41] presence of God and he would never
[53:44] anymore be the same can you say Amen you
[53:48] see it's the sense of need that creates
[53:52] Earnest desire now that LE ought to see
[53:55] and say amen I I have need of nothing
[53:58] amen I I'm rich I'm increased with Goods
[54:01] I don't have a need amen and so there is
[54:04] no prevailing need amen for the
[54:07] supernatural intervention they they're
[54:10] they're satisfied with coming to church
[54:12] they're satisfied with just a few songs
[54:14] they're satisfied with doing their their
[54:17] Norm amen because fire is not what
[54:20] they're needing amen they they they're
[54:23] satisfied with what they have but not a
[54:26] son of God a Son of God must have God
[54:30] more than he has life a Son of God must
[54:33] have God more than he needs a job a Son
[54:36] of God needs him amen more than he needs
[54:39] anything else oh can you say amen Amen
[54:42] brother bradam would say get away from
[54:44] this old lukewarm halfway say a little
[54:48] prayer of a morning and a little prayer
[54:50] at night and go to bed and get up the
[54:53] next morning he says no wonder we're
[54:55] getting worldly no wonder the world
[54:57] creeps into the church is because we
[54:59] don't stay in prayer there's no more
[55:02] agonizing there's no more staying before
[55:05] God there's no more digging out and
[55:08] cleaning up uh why because we are
[55:11] satisfied amen that lukewarmness is
[55:14] satisfied lukewarmness is neither cold
[55:17] and it's neither hot amen it's just a
[55:20] laxness but brother I want to tell you
[55:22] God let the pillar of Fire come out
[55:25] today let the pillar of fire so touch my
[55:28] soul that I'll never be the same again
[55:31] let the great Pillar of Fire well can
[55:34] you say amen amen fire fire fire fire
[55:38] fall on me just like the day of
[55:41] Pentecost fire fall on
[55:47] me
[55:48] amen amen fire was always a part of
[55:53] worship as I was saying earlier
