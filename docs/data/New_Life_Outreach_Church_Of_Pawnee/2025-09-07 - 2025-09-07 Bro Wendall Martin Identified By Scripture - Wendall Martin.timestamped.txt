[28:54] there.
[28:57] Something keeps holding me.

[29:30] Satan laid before me his temptation
[29:38] and his desire to steal away my faith.
[29:46] But I have found in time. The revelation
[29:54] the strength I need to keep me in his
[29:59] grace.
[30:01] Oh son keeps holding me.
[30:05] Every day I sing.
[30:09] Oh helping me faithfully
[30:12] to overcome my trial.

[31:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a reality.
[31:07] Something keeps holding me.
[31:13] Amen.
[31:15] Amen.
[31:17] Something keeps holding me. Hallelujah.
[31:21] Aren't you glad for that? Amen. It's
[31:24] him. He holds you, strengthens you.
[31:28] Amen. Fulfills his word through you.
[31:31] Amen. Good to see everyone in the house
[31:33] of the Lord here this morning. And um uh
[31:36] we sure uh are glad to see brother Caleb
[31:40] Farweather make it back home and and uh
[31:43] and enjoyed that song this morning.
[31:46] He gets better and better every time we
[31:48] hear him. Amen. So we appreciate we sure
[31:51] appreciate brother. Not not that it
[31:53] wasn't good at the beginning. But I I
[31:55] can I just really enjoy it. And uh just
[31:59] good to see everyone here uh in the
[32:03] house of the Lord today. And uh the Lord
[32:06] has blessed us with some wonderful
[32:07] weather, hasn't he? Amen. Just been so
[32:10] good to have um have a little bit of
[32:13] reprieve from that that heat. And u so I
[32:17] just know God has something really
[32:19] special for for every one of us here.
[32:22] Why don't we look here in the uh book of
[32:24] 2 Corinthians the um we'll look here at
[32:29] uh 2 Corinthians 3 and start at the 14th
[32:33] verse. Um
[32:36] we're looking forward to our meeting
[32:39] that is coming up and um so uh today
[32:43] will be the last um of the services uh
[32:47] until so tonight will be our last
[32:50] service until the meeting and we're
[32:52] going to dismiss this this Wednesday
[32:54] night will be dismissed and then we'll
[32:57] have Thursday night, Friday night,
[32:59] Saturday morning, Saturday night and
[33:02] Sunday morning. And um uh I would
[33:06] encourage uh everyone to just make all
[33:10] those services and invite people from
[33:12] your job, your friends, where wherever
[33:14] you're at, let them all know that that
[33:16] revival is coming to town. Amen. And um
[33:20] I I think uh it'll it'll be wonderful.
[33:24] Let's let's look here at at 2
[33:26] Corinthians 3:14.
[33:28] But their minds were blinded. For unto
[33:32] this day remains the same veil untaken
[33:36] away in the reading of the Old
[33:38] Testament, which veil is done away in
[33:41] Christ.
[33:43] But even unto this day, when Moses is
[33:45] read, the veil is upon their heart.
[33:48] Nevertheless, when it shall turn, the
[33:51] heart shall turn to the Lord, the veil
[33:55] shall be taken away. Now the Lord is
[33:58] that spirit and where the spirit of the
[34:01] Lord is there is liberty. Somebody say
[34:05] liberty.
[34:06] But we all with open or unveiled face,
[34:11] beholding as in a glass or a mirror the
[34:16] glory of the Lord are changed into that
[34:20] same image from glory to glory even as
[34:23] by the spirit of the Lord. Amen. So this
[34:27] morning I want to I want to take a title
[34:31] the sons of God are identified by
[34:34] scripture. Amen. We're and and um we're
[34:39] in the same vein that these other
[34:40] brothers have been in for uh I think
[34:43] we've all been in that same vein for a
[34:44] while. And so I I was glad when brother
[34:47] Michael preached that uh last Sunday
[34:49] night. I thought this is exactly what
[34:51] I've been thinking in my heart. So let's
[34:54] let's con let's just go to the Lord in
[34:56] prayer.
[34:58] Father, we thank you for your grace. We
[35:01] thank you for your mercies and your
[35:03] love.
[35:04] Thank you for your word, Lord, for it is
[35:08] through your word that we find who we
[35:10] are. And so, Lord, we're just asking
[35:13] that your Holy Spirit would would be
[35:16] here. Lord, we can read the scripture.
[35:21] Lord, I can uh uh read my notes, but
[35:25] God, I I pray that your anointing would
[35:27] be here today, Lord, to make it real to
[35:31] us, Lord. make it living.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Father, you see those that aren't here
[35:36] today and I pray that you'll be with
[35:38] them and strengthen them, heal them, and
[35:41] encourage them, Father. Lord, we love
[35:44] you with all of our heart and we're so
[35:45] thankful for all that you are. And we're
[35:48] looking forward to what you're going to
[35:50] do in our upcoming meeting, Lord. And we
[35:52] just give you glory and honor in Jesus
[35:55] name we pray. Can the church say amen?
[35:58] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[36:01] seated. Um we are uh again it's good to
[36:05] have my sister here with with us and um
[36:10] all the way from Lam Ohio and and so uh
[36:14] we sure we sure do love her.
[36:17] We as I look here we want to center a
[36:21] little bit on this. Amen. This last
[36:24] verse that we had read. Amen. When we
[36:29] with unveiled face
[36:32] look into the mirror,
[36:35] Amen. the glor uh look into the mirror
[36:38] of the word, we are changed from our
[36:42] glory into his glory. And actually we go
[36:45] from glory to glory. And um and so it he
[36:51] was the apostle Paul was saying amen
[36:54] there was there the people man their
[36:58] minds were blinded. They could not see
[37:02] scripture. They could not identify
[37:05] themselves in scripture. Therefore they
[37:08] amen uh fell in unbelief. We understand
[37:13] that uh we the in the wilderness journey
[37:18] coming from Egypt into the promised
[37:21] land. Amen. The the people never could
[37:26] see themselves in the promises. They
[37:28] never could see themselves uh in the
[37:31] covenant even though that God had
[37:33] supernaturally done things with them.
[37:36] And so now the Apostle Paul is saying
[37:39] we're no longer living in the types and
[37:42] the shadows of the Bible, but we're
[37:45] living in the reality of the Bible. What
[37:48] we have seen, what God has done in the
[37:51] shadows of the Old Testament. Amen. He
[37:55] is he is doing today. Amen. In the real
[37:59] in in in in living color through Jesus
[38:02] Christ. And so he is saying we're not
[38:06] under the old types and shadows trying
[38:09] to guess what God has done or is doing,
[38:12] but we are living in the reality or the
[38:16] fulfillment of what God was doing in the
[38:19] Old Testament. Amen. And we understand
[38:22] that the full the reality was there was
[38:25] going to be a redeemer and there were
[38:28] going to be sons and daughters of God
[38:30] who were going to Amen. um that God was
[38:34] going to live his life through. And so
[38:39] as we as we look today, as brother
[38:41] Michael was talking the other the other
[38:44] night about the identification and and
[38:47] there's there you're you're identified
[38:49] with certain things and Amen. This being
[38:52] the age of identification, you've got to
[38:55] have your proof of citizenship. You've
[38:57] got a you've got your birth certificate,
[38:59] your social security, your your driver's
[39:01] license. Amen. You've you've got these
[39:04] things. These were official products
[39:06] that that that determine who you are.
[39:09] And so it is today. Amen. Uh we've also
[39:13] got the brands and the, you know, Nike
[39:16] has its brand. You've got you you you've
[39:18] got these um other brands that that
[39:21] would uh um identify who they are. An
[39:26] official product has got some kind of a
[39:28] brand that they can be identified with.
[39:31] Well, I just want to say the official
[39:33] sons and daughters of God have got a
[39:35] brand and it is the word of God. The
[39:38] word of God is who we are. So when you
[39:41] look at the word, when you when you read
[39:44] that Bible or when you hold that Bible,
[39:46] that identifies you as a Christian.
[39:48] Amen. But we don't want to just hold the
[39:50] Bible. We want to believe every word of
[39:52] the Bible because when we look into it,
[39:55] it should be a mirror unto us. So
[39:59] identifying yourselves in in the
[40:02] scripture, you can you should be able to
[40:04] look back, look in the scripture and see
[40:07] yourself in the likeness of of of some
[40:09] Bible character where Amen. we can all
[40:12] find ourselves and Amen. and see the
[40:15] outcome of a certain character. We can
[40:18] see what they've gone through and we can
[40:20] know the outcome. Amen. As we read and
[40:23] we know that it was the these were these
[40:27] these are not just stories but God has
[40:30] has has so lived his life through and
[40:34] among those people so that you can know
[40:37] him as a deliverer and a and and a and a
[40:40] way maker and amen and and know his
[40:43] love. You can look in the Bible and you
[40:46] should be able to see that. Can you say
[40:48] amen? It's like a story I'd heard, amen,
[40:50] of a boy back in the in the 18th century
[40:53] and Amen. raised in the country and had
[40:55] never seen a mirror and and one day when
[40:58] they visited uh went to town and and and
[41:01] and visited the little boy's aunt in the
[41:03] city and and uh he he walked in a room
[41:07] and and seen another little boy looking
[41:09] at him and Amen. And he's looking and
[41:12] Amen. And and and uh as he you know, as
[41:15] he stopped and looked, the other boy
[41:18] stopped and looked and he waved at him
[41:20] and the other boy waved at him. And
[41:22] every time he would move, he got closer
[41:25] and closer. Amen. And the other little
[41:28] boy was just doing what he was doing.
[41:30] And and finally, he got up so close to
[41:32] the mirror and he touched it. Amen. And
[41:35] he and he and he was so surprised. He
[41:37] turned around to his mom and he says,
[41:39] "Why, mama, that's me. That's me." A.
[41:42] Amen. And that's the way that we want to
[41:45] when we look in the Bible, we want to
[41:47] look in the Bible and say, "Mama, that's
[41:51] me. That's me. That's what I'm looking
[41:54] at. I'm seeing myself in the scripture."
[41:57] Can you say amen? You see, the mirror
[42:01] reflects the image. And the apostle Paul
[42:04] is saying as you look into this mirror,
[42:09] amen, you are seeing something and you
[42:13] are becoming more and more and more like
[42:17] what you're looking at. Now, I'm not
[42:19] talking about a yeah, every one of you's
[42:21] got a mirror and you look pretty this
[42:23] morning and I'm glad you looked in that
[42:24] mirror. But I'm talking about a mirror
[42:27] of God's eternal word where your soul
[42:31] can look in and find its reflection.
[42:35] Well, praise the Lord. I I I want to
[42:37] look at myself this morning.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; I want to see myself in the scripture
[42:42] this morning. Amen. Don't you want to
[42:44] look at yourself? You see, you were
[42:46] created in the image of the word. Amen.
[42:50] before this body come. Remember, don't
[42:52] ever forget you were created, man was
[42:55] created there in Genesis 1 and 26, he
[42:59] was created in the image of God. Amen.
[43:03] Genesis 2 and 7, God put that image,
[43:07] that creation in a body. Amen. So, when
[43:11] you're looking at the mirror, the
[43:13] natural mirror that you comb your hair
[43:15] with this morning, that is Genesis 2:7.
[43:19] That's the body. But God's word, Amen,
[43:22] takes you all the way back to Genesis
[43:24] 1:26. It is the image of the invisible
[43:29] God. When you look here, you should be
[43:33] able to see your soul.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord. Does
[43:38] that make sense to you? See, they could
[43:40] not see it. But there is a people who
[43:43] will see themselves in that word. Amen.
[43:47] Now we we understand, amen, that that
[43:50] that logos, that Christ, that living
[43:54] word would come upon those Old Testament
[43:57] saints, amen, and and would act out
[44:00] future events and Amen. And the Old
[44:03] Testament uh of scripture was was little
[44:06] was little snapshots of the of the
[44:09] future Christ. But not just the future
[44:12] Christ, it would also be his future
[44:14] sons, his future bride. These were
[44:17] little these were little things in that
[44:20] Old Testament that was that would come
[44:22] more clear in the body of Jesus and in
[44:28] the body of his people. Amen. Praise the
[44:32] Lord. So Jesus himself was the perfect
[44:35] image of the invisible God. Amen. He was
[44:39] the perfect expression of the word in
[44:43] human form. And now you you don't have
[44:45] to guess anymore about the Old Testament
[44:49] because the Old Testament was fulfilled
[44:52] in the body of Jesus Christ. Now y'all
[44:55] understanding that. Amen. Now the
[44:58] perfect expression. He was ever bit
[45:00] human and ever bit God. Amen. He was he
[45:04] was a human body. Amen. But he was
[45:08] without sin. And your soul is created in
[45:11] the spirit image of God. Amen. Yet
[45:14] you've been marred. You've been
[45:16] distorted by sin and death. Amen. You
[45:20] you you're getting old. We're we're
[45:22] getting wrinkled. We're going to die if
[45:25] the Lord should. But the fall did not
[45:28] change the plan of God for your life.
[45:32] Your perfection has already been decreed
[45:35] by God. God's already seen your
[45:38] perfection. And God's already seen you
[45:40] in heaven. God's already knows your name
[45:43] and he's known your name for a very,
[45:45] very, very long time. Can you say amen?
[45:48] Amen. Now, now Romans 8:29, we we went
[45:52] through this last Sunday, but I want to
[45:53] bring it back up. For whom he did forno,
[45:57] he knew them. He had them in his mind.
[46:00] Let me just tell you, God does not have
[46:01] new thoughts.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; There's no new thoughts. Amen. Now, you
[46:05] have a new thought. Some of us wake up.
[46:07] Hallelujah. We got to we wake up in a
[46:09] new world every five minutes. But God
[46:12] has no new thoughts. What God had in the
[46:17] beginning, God still has today. He says,
[46:21] "I am God and I change not. I speak my
[46:25] word and it will not come back to me
[46:28] void."
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, amen. So, God
[46:33] does these things. Now he speaks, amen,
[46:36] to mortals as immortal so that you can
[46:40] understand. So God comes and he begins
[46:43] to speak and he and it's so that you can
[46:45] have amen because you live in time. You
[46:49] live in space. You live in volume. But
[46:52] don't confine God to space, time, and
[46:55] volume. God is eternal.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; He has no tomorrows.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; He has no future. God is God.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; But when he speaks to me and you many
[47:07] times he'll amen he'll he'll speak on
[47:10] your term. He'll speak in on your level.
[47:13] But the scripture says whom he did forno
[47:16] them he also did predestinate
[47:20] to be conformed to the image of his son.
[47:23] Can you say amen? So there is not just a
[47:26] perfect Christ that was to come, but
[47:29] there was also going to be sons and
[47:33] daughters that was going to reflect the
[47:35] same word image. Hallelujah. Going to
[47:38] reflect the same word image. Now it's
[47:41] easy for us to say, well, amen. I Jesus
[47:44] is perfect. He can reflect the word of
[47:46] God. But I say today that you have been
[47:50] predestinated by God to reflect that
[47:54] same word image.
[47:57] Oh, that's beautiful to me. Hallelujah.
[48:00] Amen. That's that's beautiful. God's
[48:02] doing this inside your fallen with your
[48:05] fallen nature. He's doing this in your
[48:08] fallen body. He's revealing himself
[48:11] through you. Can you say amen? So the
[48:14] fall did not take away our purpose. It
[48:18] did not kill the purpose of God. It
[48:20] would go on just the same this morning.
[48:23] You have to look past those five senses.
[48:26] Now you've got we we we live in this
[48:28] body. We have five senses. And I let me
[48:31] see if I can remember them all. Amen.
[48:33] You've got sight, smell, hearing, taste,
[48:37] and feeling. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[48:39] You've got all of these things. Amen.
[48:42] This is part of who you are. But
[48:44] remember, you cannot judge God by f
[48:49] sight, smell, taste, touch. You cannot
[48:53] judge God by that. These senses are here
[48:58] to identify. Amen. And and and help you
[49:01] contact in this natural world. But your
[49:04] sixth sense is unseen. It is faith. It
[49:08] is what God put in you before you ever
[49:11] was born.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the faith of God to believe
[49:16] the word of God. Can you say amen? So
[49:20] though you are in a fallen condition.
[49:23] Amen. It did not change the purpose of
[49:26] God. The prophet would say you were made
[49:28] for an eternal purpose because you was
[49:32] the manifestation of an attribute that
[49:34] was in God. Amen. thought of you and
[49:37] expressed you. He made an earth to take
[49:40] you out of to make you a human being and
[49:43] then sin come along and perverted his
[49:45] way. You come anyhow but you was lost
[49:48] with the world. So we come and redeemed
[49:51] you the expressed attribute and he also
[49:55] redeems the earth by the same way. Then
[49:57] his purpose rolls on. Somebody shout
[50:00] hallelujah. His purpose rolls on. Oh,
[50:05] when I'm in a good mood, his purpose is
[50:08] is is rolling on. When I'm in a bad
[50:10] mood, his purpose is rolling on. When
[50:12] I'm on the mountain, Amen. his purpose
[50:15] is continuing on. When I'm in my valley
[50:17] and discouraged, his purpose will
[50:20] continue on.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Jesus come to earth to find
[50:29] every one of God's thoughts,
[50:32] every one of God's fallen children.
[50:36] Amen. He was the fullness of the word.
[50:39] Amen. In the beginning was the word. The
[50:40] word was with God. The word was God.
[50:43] Amen. And the word was made flesh and
[50:45] dwelt among us. He came looking for the
[50:50] eternal attributes of God. God knew the
[50:54] sin was coming.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; God's eternal.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; God can't be God if he doesn't know
[51:03] everything.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; He can't be God. God knew the devil was
[51:09] going to come into that garden. God knew
[51:11] that Adam and Eve was going to fail.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; God knew these things. Well, praise the
[51:17] Lord.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the reason why the
[51:21] Bible says that the lamb was slain from
[51:24] before the foundation of the world. God
[51:27] seen the sin that was going to come. He
[51:31] knew that he would have some sons and
[51:33] daughters that would be born in sin,
[51:36] raised in sin. They were going to be
[51:39] sinners. But God in his mind already had
[51:44] a lamb that was going to be slain. Amen.
[51:47] God already had that word image that
[51:50] would come to redeem you and me.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you say amen?
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. See God
[52:01] Amen. What was he doing when Jesus come?
[52:05] Amen. He came looking for you. For you
[52:08] had been a part of his mind from the
[52:10] beginning. Yet you were fallen. Amen. So
[52:12] those eternal attributes of God, he came
[52:16] looking. Amen. Though they were fallen
[52:18] in sinful nature and Jesus be to
[52:21] reflect, Amen. that image. Hallelujah.
[52:25] He begin to reflect the image of God
[52:27] here on the earth. There was a human
[52:29] being reflecting the image of the word.
[52:33] Amen. And before you know it, there was
[52:35] something beginning to take place. every
[52:38] predestinated seed begin to see
[52:41] something in that word image that was
[52:44] living in that body. Hallelujah. Amen.
[52:47] That Peter dropped his nets and begin to
[52:49] follow him. Matthew, amen, dropped his
[52:51] collect his tax collecting and went to
[52:55] follow Luke. Amen. Turn in a resignation
[52:58] as a doctor and begin to follow. Why?
[53:00] They saw something in this body that was
[53:05] more than just a man.
[53:08] Can you say amen? There was something
[53:10] different. It was the word image being
[53:14] exhibited through a body. Hallelujah.
[53:17] Now y'all stay with me because there's
[53:19] also a word image for this day that is
[53:22] expressed in a body.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So what was Jesus
[53:27] doing? He would come. Now the world,
[53:30] most of the world did not recognize him.
[53:33] He didn't come for the whole world.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; He came for those fallen attributes of
[53:41] God.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the Pharisees were looking at
[53:49] Jesus and they Amen. They called him
[53:52] Bezbupt.
[53:54] They they they said the prince, you're
[53:55] the prince of the devil. You've got a
[53:57] devil. These were the preachers that
[53:59] were saying this, by the way. Well, you
[54:01] just got a devil on you.
[54:02] Amen. But the Bible says he told his
[54:05] disciples, he says, "We need to go to
[54:08] Samaria." And there he goes to Samaria
[54:11] and he sets and he stands by the well.
[54:14] Amen. And here comes this harlot. This
[54:16] harlot woman coming up and and and he
[54:19] says, "Amen. Would you would would you
[54:21] uh would you give me to drink?" And and
[54:23] uh and she says, "Well, it's not it's
[54:25] not even right for you to ask me Yeah.
[54:28] to for a drink. I'm a Samaritan. you are
[54:31] a you are a Jew. Uh what what are you
[54:33] doing asking? And and then Jesus, as he
[54:35] begins to talk to her a little bit, he
[54:37] said, "Well, if if if you knew who who
[54:40] was talking to you, you would ask me a
[54:43] drink."
[54:44] &gt;&gt; And she says, "You don't have a picture
[54:46] and the well is deep. How do you h how
[54:49] do you say that?" And he begin to he
[54:52] begin to talk and and and and then he
[54:54] amen. And and and and then he says, "Go
[54:56] get your husband." And she says, "Uh, I
[54:59] don't have one." And he says, "You've
[55:03] got five and the one you're living with
[55:05] is not yours."
[55:07] Oh. She steps back and she says, "I
[55:11] perceive that you're a prophet. We know
[55:14] that when the Messiah, the word in a
[55:19] body comes, he will do these things."
[55:23] And then he turns around and he says,
[55:26] "Amen." He says, "Yes." Amen. I am He
[55:34] &gt;&gt; And if you will ask of me, I will give
[55:37] you water, and you will never thirst
[55:41] again.
[55:42] The Bible says that she immediately
[55:45] dropped her water pot, took off into the
[55:47] city and declaring, "I have found the
[55:52] word in a body. I have found an
[55:56] expression of the Bible." Are you
[55:58] hearing me? He was everything that God
[56:02] had said in the Bible. The Bible had
[56:05] said the Messiah would be a prophet. The
[56:07] Bible it said that it would be the very
[56:10] God. Amen. Living in him, Emmanuel, God
[56:14] in flesh.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the Pharisees
[56:23] who went to school knew the Bible, but
[56:26] yet the Bible was closed to them. There
[56:29] was a veil over their face. And when
[56:32] they looked in the Bible, they could not
[56:34] see a reflection of themselves. They
[56:36] could not see Jesus as a fulfillment.
[56:39] They could not see that, hey, Bible days
[56:41] are happening again. Hey, we have not
[56:44] had a prophet for 400 years and here he
[56:46] is. Oh, this is what God has promised.
[56:48] They could not see it.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; But the little harlot,
[56:53] &gt;&gt; she says, "I know who you are."
[56:56] How could that be? Because she had
[56:59] eternal representation in heaven. She
[57:03] had a represent. How praise the Lord.
[57:06] Hallelujah. Amen. I I h how can I tell
[57:09] you here this morning a representation.
[57:11] Amen. When you go to Walmart and all of
[57:13] those thousands of products at Walmart,
[57:15] Amen. You don't have to go and write
[57:17] down the list. You don't have to go and
[57:19] and and write down what it is and and
[57:22] and uh how much it is. No, the product
[57:26] is already in the computer. You take
[57:28] that product up to the counter and they
[57:32] scan the product and it'll tell you that
[57:35] it is toilet paper and it'll tell you
[57:37] the brand and it'll tell you, Amen, how
[57:39] much it is. It's all and I just want to
[57:42] tell you right now, amen. Jesus came for
[57:45] his own. You are already in the memory
[57:49] bank of heaven. And when he scans your
[57:51] heart with his word, you know who you
[57:55] are.
[57:57] Heaven knows who you are. You know who
[57:59] you are. The world will know who you are
[58:03] because there is something of
[58:05] representation
[58:06] in the heavens.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, glory to God.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't even know nothing about
[58:15] God and you come walking into a church.
[58:18] Hallelujah.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God takes his word and runs
[58:23] that word across your heart
[58:25] &gt;&gt; and it goes ding ding ding ding. Son of
[58:27] God, daughter of God. Well, praise the
[58:30] Lord. That's what that Harley done.
[58:33] Jesus just ran the word across her heart
[58:37] and she says, "I know who you are."
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And she was forever more changed. Can
[58:45] you say amen?
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, Jesus reflected what we
[58:50] should be because he was that word image
[58:53] living in a body. Amen. The humility of
[58:57] this God man to God's word. Jesus desire
[59:02] was to fulfill the word. Amen. His his
[59:07] makeup was the word. He says, "I do
[59:10] nothing except my father for show me.
[59:13] I've come not to to to do away with the
[59:16] law, but to magnify it, to fulfill it.
[59:21] He tells John as he's coming in, amen,
[59:23] to the water to be baptized and the as
[59:26] as a lamb. And John says, "I can't
[59:28] baptize you. I'm just a I you're you're
[59:31] the son of God. I can Amen." And what
[59:33] did he say? Suffer it to be so. For the
[59:36] scripture,
[59:38] righteousness must be fulfilled.
[59:43] Jesus was careful that that word was
[59:46] being Amen. to fulfill that word. The
[59:49] depths of sincerity to fulfill all that
[59:52] was written. My desire is to do thy
[59:55] will, oh God. Well, praise the Lord. And
[59:58] and and now remember what was his
[1:00:00] purpose? His purpose was to redeem. So
[1:00:04] the word had to be perfect. The word had
[1:00:07] to be perfect. It couldn't be mixed with
[1:00:08] his opinion. Amen. Mama's ideas or
[1:00:10] anything else. It had to be perfect
[1:00:13] because there were other sons and
[1:00:15] daughters of God whose lives depended on
[1:00:18] it.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to reflect in perfection every
[1:00:24] word for his day.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, hallelujah. Oh, glory to God.
[1:00:33] His purpose was to redeem. Now, what is
[1:00:36] redeem? Buy back. Bring it back. Bring
[1:00:39] God's thoughts of you back. Bring it
[1:00:41] back. Though you're lost in sin, I've
[1:00:43] come to redeem you. Though, though,
[1:00:46] Amen. Everything looks looks crazy, I've
[1:00:48] come to heal you. Though your family
[1:00:50] looks like it might be, Amen. just
[1:00:52] falling apart, I've come to restore. I
[1:00:55] will redeem. Can you say amen?
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, today, as Abraham, we believe
[1:01:01] God. Amen. The I want us to just just
[1:01:05] just real thought, just a passing
[1:01:06] thought. Abraham kept the word of God
[1:01:11] before him.
[1:01:13] Remember Abraham was called out. Abraham
[1:01:15] did not ask for God. God came and sought
[1:01:20] Abraham out. And he said,"Abram,
[1:01:23] I'm" and he appeared to him and says, "I
[1:01:25] want you to get up from this country. I
[1:01:28] want you to leave your family. I want
[1:01:30] you to leave this that you're doing and
[1:01:32] I want you, Amen, to follow me because I
[1:01:36] have called you to myself and I'm going
[1:01:40] to make you a great nation. Amen.
[1:01:42] Abraham was not able to have a child.
[1:01:45] Abraham never could have a child. Never
[1:01:47] did. And now he's an old man.
[1:01:50] Hallelujah. Amen. Here he is 75 and
[1:01:53] Sarah 65. And they've never been able to
[1:01:57] have children. And God says, "You're
[1:02:00] going to have a son, and from that son,
[1:02:03] you're going to be a great nation."
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Now, think of this. Abraham was going to
[1:02:10] have to make a choice. Abraham had a
[1:02:13] representation
[1:02:15] in the heavens, for he was a thought of
[1:02:18] God from the beginning.
[1:02:21] And Abraham, when God appeared,
[1:02:25] something happened to Abraham's heart.
[1:02:28] He believed God. The Bible says that he
[1:02:32] had to walk for 25 years.
[1:02:36] Believing God,
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; but he confessed, "I'm going to have a
[1:02:40] son. I'm going to be a nation. We're
[1:02:43] going Well, praise the Lord." The Bible
[1:02:45] says there in the book of Hebrews the
[1:02:47] 11th chapter and Abraham or or there in
[1:02:49] the book of Romans that the Abraham uh
[1:02:52] uh uh staggered not at the promises of
[1:02:57] God. Why? He came from God. Are y'all
[1:03:01] understanding me? How are you going to
[1:03:04] make a rapture? How are you going to
[1:03:06] overcome in this evil age? How is God
[1:03:09] going to Amen be able to take you and
[1:03:11] use you to show his glory through you?
[1:03:14] How is it if God didn't prepare your
[1:03:17] heart before the foundation of the
[1:03:19] world, we would all be going to hell in
[1:03:21] a hand basket?
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you're becoming you're
[1:03:31] becoming that word image, the living
[1:03:33] image of the word. You're doing it the
[1:03:35] same way Abraham did. How? Amen. The
[1:03:38] same way every prophet done. The same
[1:03:39] way every believer has had to do it. You
[1:03:42] are ordained to it. Something in you
[1:03:45] believes it. And then God begins to
[1:03:48] materialize it in you. Somebody say,
[1:03:50] "I'm ordained to it."
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Something in me believes it.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; And God materializes
[1:03:58] right here in my body. God will praise
[1:04:01] the Lord. I've never seen heaven, but
[1:04:04] I'm ordained to it. My name is written
[1:04:07] in heaven. That's what the Bible said.
[1:04:09] Amen. when they when when they came to
[1:04:11] Jesus and and casting out devils and
[1:04:13] they were rejoicing. Amen. And they
[1:04:15] said, "My even the devils are subject to
[1:04:17] us." And Jesus, this is a wonderful
[1:04:19] thing. Amen. It's a good thing. But he
[1:04:21] said, "But don't rejoice that devils are
[1:04:23] subject to you, but rejoice because your
[1:04:26] names are written in heaven."
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:36] You say, "Now, now, now, now, now,
[1:04:38] Brother Wind, I have a hard time with
[1:04:39] that." Well,
[1:04:44] if you don't look in the mirror and if
[1:04:47] you keep a veil over your face when in
[1:04:48] front of the mirror, what good is
[1:04:50] looking into the mirror,
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; right? Hallelujah. If you keep a veil
[1:04:55] over your face while you're brushing
[1:04:57] your teeth and combing your hair, it's
[1:04:58] not going to really do you much good to
[1:05:00] have a mirror. But God wants you to
[1:05:03] understand. Listen, you're not an
[1:05:05] afterthought.
[1:05:07] You are a forthought.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why have you been hitting on
[1:05:12] this, man? You've been hitting on this
[1:05:13] for weeks now." Because I want every son
[1:05:17] and daughter of God to know who you are.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. If you're not, Amen. If it's
[1:05:29] not there, then it can never happen. Now
[1:05:32] there there in 2 Corinthians 3 and8.
[1:05:35] Amen. In the amplified version, it says,
[1:05:38] "And we all with unveiled faces
[1:05:40] continually seeing as in a mirror the
[1:05:44] glory of the Lord and are progressively
[1:05:47] being transformed into
[1:05:51] his image from one degree of glory to
[1:05:54] even more glory which comes from the
[1:05:56] Lord who is the spirit." Can you say
[1:05:58] amen? Amen. Now, the redeemed know that
[1:06:02] they've come from that word and that
[1:06:05] they have a purpose. Amen. The prophet
[1:06:08] would say they know they are born of the
[1:06:10] word. The word is made flesh in them.
[1:06:13] And every word that God says, they don't
[1:06:16] different with it. They say that's
[1:06:19] right. Amen. And amen. They punctuate it
[1:06:23] with an amen every time. Amen. And amen.
[1:06:27] Can I get an amen?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Something in them punctuates it himself.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, isn't it strange that most
[1:06:39] people won't believe it?
[1:06:42] Most people won't believe the word. Most
[1:06:45] people won't come to Christ.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:49] Hallelujah.
[1:06:51] Many many say they believe it, but just
[1:06:54] give them the word test and and you'll
[1:06:56] find that well, Amen. They'll pick what
[1:06:58] they want to believe here and pick what
[1:07:00] they want to believe here and they pick
[1:07:01] and choose. Amen.
[1:07:04] They they cannot believe every word of
[1:07:06] the Bible, but then here comes you.
[1:07:09] There's something about you. There's
[1:07:11] something about this Christ that you
[1:07:14] want to be like him. Amen. and the the
[1:07:17] humility of his character draws you to
[1:07:20] him. The strength and the resilience of
[1:07:23] his resolve to fulfill his purpose.
[1:07:26] There's something about this Christ. You
[1:07:29] are made from the same stuff that he is
[1:07:32] made from. You are made from the word.
[1:07:35] You are made. There's something about
[1:07:38] that word that has become real to you.
[1:07:42] Amen. There's something within you.
[1:07:44] There's a life that is drawing you to
[1:07:48] him. You can't explain it. You don't
[1:07:50] know how it's happening. But God's grace
[1:07:54] has come to you. Amen. For you to
[1:07:57] fulfill it. Can you say amen?
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:02] Oh, glory. Oh, glory to God. When when
[1:08:06] you look when you look at this glorious
[1:08:08] people, this glorious rapture that is
[1:08:12] coming, this Amen. the the promises that
[1:08:15] must be fulfilled. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh,
[1:08:20] there's something in me saying, Lord, I
[1:08:22] want your word to be fulfilled in me.
[1:08:25] What can you can How many has that? You
[1:08:28] have something in you saying, I want
[1:08:29] your word to be living in me. Yes.
[1:08:32] You're just like, it's just like Amen.
[1:08:36] when God said, "A virgin shall
[1:08:38] conceive."
[1:08:39] Amen.
[1:08:41] God knew who the woman would be and God
[1:08:46] knew the name of that woman. When God
[1:08:50] God can't God's not going to say a
[1:08:52] virgin shall conceive and then not know
[1:08:54] the name. God knew a virgin was going to
[1:08:58] conceive and God fulfilled that word.
[1:09:01] Amen. He prepared. So what? He knew who
[1:09:04] she was. He knew her name and he
[1:09:09] prepared her heart to accept the word
[1:09:13] when it came. Now I want you to really
[1:09:15] catch this. You would never take or
[1:09:19] accept catch the word. There is nothing
[1:09:23] of you that can do it. Amen. There is
[1:09:26] sister keys there in in Romans the the
[1:09:29] uh ninth chapter and I think somewhere
[1:09:31] in the 20th 20 verses there 20th verses.
[1:09:34] Amen. Uh, it's not to him that runth,
[1:09:38] nor to him that willth, but it's of God
[1:09:42] who shows mercy. It's God who seen you.
[1:09:46] It's God who ordains you. Amen. Can you
[1:09:50] say amen? So now remember, God didn't
[1:09:52] just see you, but God placed his purpose
[1:09:55] in you. Amen. Now look here. Amen. He
[1:09:58] said, "Now Mary's womb," Amen. He said
[1:10:01] the physical mind was was a virgin womb.
[1:10:04] She believed God's word. And no matter
[1:10:07] how much anybody criticized, how many
[1:10:10] things somebody else said, that didn't
[1:10:12] have one thing to do with it. She
[1:10:14] believed God's word regardless. Oh, I
[1:10:17] wish I could get that over. Are you
[1:10:18] getting it? See, she first it was her
[1:10:21] mind before the act ever taken place in
[1:10:25] her literal womb. The act had to take
[1:10:28] place in here first. Let the spirit come
[1:10:32] in to do the rest of the work. Glory.
[1:10:35] Oh, before the actual spiritual birth
[1:10:38] can take place, the word has to find
[1:10:41] itself through your mind to believe it.
[1:10:44] And that's where we are. You've got to
[1:10:46] be able to stand up and say, "God, what
[1:10:49] is causing this in me?"
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; I'm a word image. Therefore,
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; I can I can believe. What can you say?
[1:10:58] Amen. Amen. God calls and separates you
[1:11:02] to himself. Now, now I I I I uh I hope
[1:11:06] this okay for you here this morning,
[1:11:08] your heart had to be craving.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; It had to be craving.
[1:11:15] Mary before long time before she had
[1:11:19] that baby, Mary was drawn to the
[1:11:22] scripture, Mary would talk about it with
[1:11:25] Joseph and say, "Who do you think? What
[1:11:27] do you think about that virgin? What do
[1:11:29] you think about it? Was the word already
[1:11:32] laying in her and God dealing with that
[1:11:35] word. She could identify with it. Oh
[1:11:39] God.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh. Can you say amen? I She
[1:11:43] could identify with that word. There was
[1:11:46] something about that word that was
[1:11:48] saying amen. And and and God has has has
[1:11:52] done the same thing with you. Amen. Oh
[1:11:55] my. We want to look at Virgin Mary and
[1:11:57] we think, "Oh, how God used her. How
[1:12:00] wonderful it must be that that she could
[1:12:03] carry the word." Amen. Image of God, the
[1:12:07] the the the the baby. He She could carry
[1:12:10] Iman Emanuel in in her womb. Amen. But
[1:12:13] remember the prophet said, "You are not
[1:12:16] here just to be another human being. You
[1:12:20] are here because God made you for some
[1:12:24] purpose.
[1:12:26] You're not here just to eat food that
[1:12:28] God growed. You're not here just to live
[1:12:30] in a house that man made to wear
[1:12:32] clothing that someone else fashioned.
[1:12:34] Amen. You are here for a specific
[1:12:37] purpose. Somebody turn to your neighbor
[1:12:39] and tell them you're here for a specific
[1:12:41] purpose. Hallelujah. And no matter how
[1:12:44] little you are, how big you are, how
[1:12:48] important you are, how unimportant you
[1:12:50] are, you are here to serve that purpose.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:58] I'm going to labor on this for a few
[1:12:59] more minutes before I leave it. Amen.
[1:13:02] God placed the desire. You say, "It's
[1:13:05] pretty elementary, Brother Windle." And
[1:13:06] I want you to catch this because your
[1:13:08] identification can only come from the
[1:13:10] word. The identification can only come
[1:13:13] from the word. And when the devil comes
[1:13:15] against you and the devil is fighting
[1:13:17] you and the devil's telling you you
[1:13:18] don't have a purpose and the devil's
[1:13:20] telling you that you're not fulfilling.
[1:13:21] Amen. Then go back to the desire. Go
[1:13:23] back to that that seed on the inside of
[1:13:26] you. You were that was a seed of the
[1:13:28] word that was placed in your heart. That
[1:13:30] is your identification.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He placed it. God says in in in in
[1:13:40] the book of uh Psalms one and one
[1:13:43] blessed is the man
[1:13:45] a man who's sits not in the seat of the
[1:13:47] scornful who stands not in the way of
[1:13:49] the sinner and amen he goes he goes
[1:13:51] through those things but he says blessed
[1:13:53] is the man whose delight is in the law
[1:13:57] of the Lord and in his law does he
[1:14:00] meditate day and night. Amen. In his law
[1:14:04] does he meditate and he shall be like a
[1:14:08] tree planted by the rivers of water that
[1:14:10] brings forth fruit in his time. Oh, can
[1:14:13] you say amen? And the prophet would pick
[1:14:15] that up and he would say, see, it wasn't
[1:14:17] set out. He shall be like a tree that
[1:14:20] set out transposed from this to that. He
[1:14:22] was planted what? Predestinated. That
[1:14:25] thought of God before the foundation of
[1:14:27] the world placed him there. not stuck
[1:14:31] out by chance, but he was planted,
[1:14:33] predestinated what? To the rivers of
[1:14:36] water. His roots shall not wither. Oh,
[1:14:38] hallelujah. Though he dies, I'll raise
[1:14:41] him up again in the last days. That's
[1:14:43] right. He's predestinated to be there.
[1:14:46] Not just by chance, but he's
[1:14:48] predestinated to catch that word when it
[1:14:52] is sold.
[1:14:58] Then it doesn't matter, brother Donald,
[1:14:59] whether I live in unvention. Doesn't
[1:15:01] matter whether I'm in the in the in the
[1:15:03] who's who. What matters is when the scan
[1:15:08] comes across,
[1:15:10] there's something saying ding ding ding
[1:15:11] ding ding ding ding ding. Hallelujah.
[1:15:13] God's word for the day comes across
[1:15:15] says, "I believe it. Yes, I believe it.
[1:15:17] Yes, I believe it. Yes, God's yes, I see
[1:15:20] that. Yes, I believe it. I believe it."
[1:15:24] Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:15:28] Now,
[1:15:30] hallelujah. On the ministers chat uh uh
[1:15:33] this morning, there was
[1:15:35] a lot of quotes going around about the
[1:15:37] about purpose and and uh so I thought,
[1:15:40] man, this going to go right along. So, I
[1:15:41] I stole one or two of them here. Amen.
[1:15:44] Hallelujah. Amen. He says, he makes men
[1:15:47] different. He makes us each one a
[1:15:50] different gives us each one a different
[1:15:52] place. A palm tree can never be a
[1:15:54] hickory. A hickory tree can never be a
[1:15:56] palm. Nobody can take your place. And
[1:15:59] you shouldn't try to take anyone else's
[1:16:01] place
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; because you're an individual to God. And
[1:16:05] God has a purpose for you. He made you
[1:16:07] thus. And you say, "Why did he do it?"
[1:16:09] He is sovereign. He's got a reason for
[1:16:11] it being that way. And we say, "Amen."
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I I see some cold
[1:16:18] folks in here. Y'all can turn that heat
[1:16:19] up or the AC up a degree if you want to.
[1:16:22] Amen. Now, let me keep this in your
[1:16:24] mind. Your heart was prepared for the
[1:16:28] seed to come before the world.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And some people have a hard time
[1:16:34] with that because we are in such a
[1:16:37] humanistic world. We want to do
[1:16:40] everything on our own
[1:16:43] and we we just can't. We we we are
[1:16:45] self-made women men and women and we
[1:16:47] don't want anybody.
[1:16:51] If I want to come to Jesus, I'll come to
[1:16:53] Jesus and if I don't, I won't. Well, I
[1:16:55] just want to tell you that's not the way
[1:16:57] it works.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "No man can come to me."
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Except my father first draw him. I
[1:17:11] believe that's there in John John 6.
[1:17:14] Wait, try that. John 6:44.
[1:17:17] Amen. No man.
[1:17:22] Is that Is that not the right one? 8:44.
[1:17:25] 64. I thought it's six, but it might be
[1:17:27] 8:44.
[1:17:30] No man can come.
[1:17:33] Hallelujah. Sometimes. Amen. I've got it
[1:17:37] here in my Bible. I'm gonna stop right
[1:17:39] now and give it to you. Hallelujah.
[1:17:42] Yes. Amen. It is John John 6:44. No man
[1:17:48] can come to me except the father which
[1:17:51] sent me draw him.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; No man, somebody turn to your neighbor
[1:17:57] and say, "No man
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; or woman can come to Jesus
[1:18:05] except
[1:18:07] Oh, now Brother Wendle, that just does
[1:18:09] something to my theology." Amen. Well,
[1:18:12] you know, your theology is going to can
[1:18:15] can keep you from victory if it's not
[1:18:17] theology based upon scripture.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; The thing is is I have nothing I can
[1:18:25] give. It's by the grace of God.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:34] I'm going to go even a step further
[1:18:35] because just as you were the germ in
[1:18:38] your father,
[1:18:40] so were you in the genes of God
[1:18:44] just waiting to be uh waiting for your
[1:18:48] manifestation.
[1:18:49] Now the apostle Paul picked picked this
[1:18:52] this this thought up there in the book
[1:18:55] of Hebrews
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; and and he is saying that that there was
[1:19:01] there was that that Levi was already in
[1:19:05] the mind of God before he was ever even
[1:19:08] born. And the Bible says that Levi, who
[1:19:13] received tithes from the people, he paid
[1:19:17] tithes in the loins of his greatgreat
[1:19:21] grandfather,
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right, let's look at it.
[1:19:27] Levi was was one of 12 sons, and God
[1:19:32] appointed him to be the uh uh uh the
[1:19:37] priesthood. And then you and then you go
[1:19:39] on and you it goes from Levi's father
[1:19:42] was Jacob. Jacob's father was Isaac.
[1:19:47] Isaac's father was Abraham. Abraham paid
[1:19:51] tithe to Melzdc.
[1:19:53] And the Apostle Paul says that Levi
[1:19:57] hundreds of years before he was born
[1:20:00] paid tithe in the lawns of Abraham.
[1:20:03] Talking about election.
[1:20:08] And just as Levi was in the loins of his
[1:20:11] father Jacob, he was also in the loins
[1:20:15] of his father Isaac, grandfather Isaac,
[1:20:18] and he was also in the loins of his
[1:20:20] greatgrandfather
[1:20:22] Abraham. Well, what about you and me? If
[1:20:25] there was an eternal quality to you, you
[1:20:28] were in the loins of God. the mind of
[1:20:31] God be
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; find the beginning of God and there you
[1:20:35] were. Hallelujah. That's right. That's
[1:20:39] right. This brings that eternal quality.
[1:20:42] This brings it out to you.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now listen to me. You were
[1:20:47] in your father germ form.
[1:20:51] Oh, glory to God. My dad carried all of
[1:20:55] my grandsons in his loins. My
[1:20:58] greatgranddad carried a Hallelujah. And
[1:21:00] I can't ever say this without without
[1:21:03] just reminding everybody about bald. My
[1:21:05] greatgranddad was bald and my granddad
[1:21:08] was bald and my dad is bald. And y'all
[1:21:11] catch the story, boys. Amen. So, Amen.
[1:21:16] Kobe's Kobe's Kobe's hanging on to his
[1:21:19] hair. No. Amen. We're just We're going
[1:21:21] to bypass that gene. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:23] Amen. But you see, Amen. You were you
[1:21:26] were there by predestination. Everyone
[1:21:29] thinks predestination is a bad word. Oh
[1:21:32] man, God putting this and God saying
[1:21:34] this and then God knows all of his sons
[1:21:38] that were in him.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I didn't know how I had
[1:21:44] three sons when I was a boy. Amen. Mom
[1:21:48] and dad didn't know that they had three
[1:21:50] sons and a and and and and well they
[1:21:52] they they had their they had their two
[1:21:53] sons and a girl and then but God says no
[1:21:56] you got one more coming. Hallelujah.
[1:21:58] Amen. Then Jonathan comes and been the
[1:22:00] favorite ever since. But so here but God
[1:22:03] in his in his in his in his great wisdom
[1:22:07] he knew
[1:22:09] every one of you. Have you all ever
[1:22:10] heard that song? Amen. He knew me yet he
[1:22:14] loved me. He who glory makes the heaven
[1:22:18] shine. So unworthy of so much mercy.
[1:22:21] While he was on the cross, I was on his
[1:22:24] mind.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the mind of God in a body.
[1:22:29] When Jesus, are y'all hearing me? When
[1:22:32] Jesus went to Calvary, I was in him.
[1:22:37] Jesus bore all of this boy's sins. I was
[1:22:42] in him. that eternal part of God.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; You see, do do you the Bible? Okay, let
[1:22:49] look sister Clea there in John 1 and1.
[1:22:53] In the beginning was the word. The word
[1:22:57] was with God. The word was God. The same
[1:23:00] was in the beginning with God. 14th
[1:23:03] verse. And the word was made flesh,
[1:23:08] and we
[1:23:10] beheld
[1:23:12] his glory.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Physical human beings beheld his glory.
[1:23:18] E Ephesians 1 and4, Sister Keys, and we
[1:23:21] were chosen
[1:23:23] in him before the foundation of the
[1:23:29] world.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; That we should be holy and without blame
[1:23:35] before him in love.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; I was in him. He was that lamb slain. So
[1:23:43] he had to come as an expression of God
[1:23:47] to search out his own. But there was
[1:23:49] only one way that we'd be able fallen
[1:23:52] attributes of God, fallen word, thoughts
[1:23:55] of God. There's only one way is for that
[1:23:58] word to become a human. That human, that
[1:24:02] perfect human to die for our sins, not
[1:24:05] his sins. He became sin for us. He did
[1:24:09] not sin. He became our sin. All of the
[1:24:12] sins of God's elect was placed on him.
[1:24:15] When he died, he bore your sins, your
[1:24:20] sins, my sins, and he took it to hell.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Now, catch this. Now, in the in the Old
[1:24:29] Testament, there were there were two
[1:24:31] birds.
[1:24:33] Amen. That was used for sin offering.
[1:24:36] They would take the one bird
[1:24:40] and they would cut his head off
[1:24:43] and sprinkle the blood on the other
[1:24:47] bird.
[1:24:51] And the other bird would take off. Amen.
[1:24:55] And as it's taking off flying, it would
[1:24:57] they would release it, the dove, and it
[1:24:59] would take off. Amen. as he's as he's
[1:25:03] going, he's he's the blood is
[1:25:05] splattering on the earth. And what was
[1:25:08] it? Oh, glory to God.
[1:25:11] The word, the God, the Christ shed his
[1:25:17] blood, and his blood is upon his church.
[1:25:22] Y'all ever heard the song the great
[1:25:24] speckled bird? That's where it came
[1:25:26] from. the blood of its mate. Christ died
[1:25:31] for you. The blood is upon you that
[1:25:34] everywhere you go, you are sprinkling
[1:25:37] his goodness, his love, his mercy, his
[1:25:41] patience. Oh, come on, church. It was
[1:25:44] that Christ that come to redeem you. He
[1:25:48] set you free. Someone shout yes.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:54] Amen. For what purpose? Why has he
[1:25:57] sprinkled his blood on you? You have
[1:25:59] purpose,
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; the word.
[1:26:04] Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God. Oh,
[1:26:07] do you love him?
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You bear the same word image. You
[1:26:12] bear the same word image. You were
[1:26:14] chosen in that word.
[1:26:18] Am I making sense?
[1:26:22] Why isn't this church full?
[1:26:25] Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why is it when
[1:26:28] you're going out there witnessing, you
[1:26:29] can't hardly get anybody in?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; If there's nothing there, there's
[1:26:36] nothing there.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; But when the word came across
[1:26:42] your seat, when it come across your
[1:26:45] heart, there was something that says,
[1:26:48] "Tell me some more. Show me who you are.
[1:26:51] Show me who I am. Show me.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; If you really understand that and take
[1:26:56] that, that defeated attitude leaves.
[1:26:58] Then
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; that woe is me leaves. Then you're
[1:27:02] always going to be woe is me. As long as
[1:27:03] you're looking in the mirror and you're
[1:27:04] judging everything by what you don't
[1:27:06] have and what you've missed and what
[1:27:08] this that and the other. I'm trying to
[1:27:10] tell you. Hallelujah. See, it would be
[1:27:12] good for some of us to throw that have
[1:27:14] that old that old mirror out of your out
[1:27:15] of your house. But there is a mirror
[1:27:17] that you can start looking into and say,
[1:27:19] "Yes, my soul is saying, "Yes, my soul
[1:27:22] is that's who I am. That's what I want
[1:27:24] to be. That's who God's made me to be."
[1:27:27] Can you say, "Amen. I'm not defeated. I
[1:27:30] am a son of God. I'm not going to hell.
[1:27:32] I am a daughter of God.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; The grace of God is upon me. He has
[1:27:37] anointed me for this purpose to defeat
[1:27:39] the devil in every area."
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:46] Hallelujah.
[1:27:48] Hallelujah. He does it by believers in
[1:27:52] each age. So this word being exhibited.
[1:27:56] It's you're looking into that mirror.
[1:27:58] You're looking into that image. You're
[1:28:00] looking into that word and there's
[1:28:02] something in you saying, "Yes, yes." And
[1:28:05] then you start looking and you say, "Oh,
[1:28:08] but I'm not looking like that." Then you
[1:28:10] take the water of the word. Amen. Let's
[1:28:13] take that sister Clea uh Ephesians 5 and
[1:28:16] 26. Amen. And he has washed us with the
[1:28:20] washing that he might sanctify and
[1:28:23] cleanse it you and me with the washing
[1:28:26] of water by the word that he might
[1:28:30] present it to himself. a glorious
[1:28:33] church, not having spot or wrinkle or
[1:28:36] any such blemish that we that it should
[1:28:40] be holy without blemish. What are you
[1:28:44] doing? You're taking the mirror. You're
[1:28:46] saying, "Oh, got a hair messed up."
[1:28:48] Amen. So, what are you doing? You're
[1:28:50] cleansing yourself. You're taking the
[1:28:53] word, taking the blood. You're applying
[1:28:55] it to your life. Don't call yourself a
[1:28:58] Christian and look in the Bible and say,
[1:28:59] "Ha, it don't matter." you're not a
[1:29:01] Christian.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; If you're a Christian, you're looking
[1:29:06] into the word and you're saying, "I want
[1:29:09] to be conformed to that image."
[1:29:14] So, we find out that that God does that
[1:29:16] in every age. God does it by his own
[1:29:19] choosing, by his own predestinated
[1:29:22] choosing. He chose his prophets and
[1:29:24] things for the age. He fixes his nature,
[1:29:26] the man's nature, the man's style of
[1:29:28] preaching on on on their gift and all
[1:29:30] that he does and and is to meet the
[1:29:33] challenge of that day. God creates the
[1:29:35] man created the man and sent him. And in
[1:29:39] his own mind, as I was preaching the
[1:29:41] other night, we are a germ of that gene
[1:29:43] of God. He know that man would be there
[1:29:46] at that age.
[1:29:48] He knew before there was ever a molecule
[1:29:50] or light or anything on the earth. For
[1:29:53] you're a gene of your father. You were
[1:29:55] in your father and yet your father had
[1:29:57] no fellowship with you. You uh because
[1:30:00] you you you was there but you you you
[1:30:03] knew it not and he knew it not. But you
[1:30:06] was manifested that he might have
[1:30:08] fellowship with you. And you being born
[1:30:11] again, you're born of eternal life. And
[1:30:15] that's the only one form of eternal life
[1:30:17] and that's God's life. Zoey, the Greek
[1:30:20] word is Zoe comes the only one form of
[1:30:23] life. Then you are a son and daughter of
[1:30:27] God. You were in God all the time. But
[1:30:31] he knew what bed. Somebody say yes.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; He knew what bed and what and the time
[1:30:38] that you'd be planted. And now you're
[1:30:41] made a creature, a son of God,
[1:30:42] manifested son, daughter of God to meet
[1:30:45] the challenge of this hour to vindicate
[1:30:48] the true and living God of this hour.
[1:30:52] Amen.
[1:30:56] Are you Are you catching me now?
[1:31:00] Vindicating him. There's a vindication
[1:31:03] that is taking place. It's that word.
[1:31:06] Amen. I think we can all agree that Adam
[1:31:08] was a son of God,
[1:31:10] right?
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Even in his fallen condition. Yes, he
[1:31:13] sinned. And yes, the wages of death was
[1:31:15] sin. And yes, that day the highest
[1:31:17] species of God's creation had fallen.
[1:31:21] Everything underneath Adam, amen, fell
[1:31:24] with him. Amen. Everything on earth had
[1:31:27] fallen because man was over the earth.
[1:31:30] And there must be someone to save the
[1:31:31] creation.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; And there was only one who did not fall.
[1:31:38] There had to be someone saved the
[1:31:39] creation. And there was only one that
[1:31:40] did not fall. It was Adam's father.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:31:50] God was the only one that could do it.
[1:31:52] He didn't fall. God was the only one. He
[1:31:55] was the father of Adam.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; God could and God did bring redemption.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; God was not going to leave Adam. God was
[1:32:08] not going to leave any of his sons and
[1:32:10] daughters that were in him before the
[1:32:13] world began.
[1:32:19] Adam was still a son
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; for his name was eternally in God's book
[1:32:25] of genes,
[1:32:27] God's book of life. Every son and
[1:32:30] daughter that will ever come was in that
[1:32:31] mine in germ form billions of years
[1:32:34] before.
[1:32:36] Now we've already gone through as I have
[1:32:38] been going through the scripture the
[1:32:40] living logos. It's not the word
[1:32:44] wo r d in the way that we think it. It
[1:32:47] was a living. Hebrews, we've already
[1:32:49] gone through all this through through
[1:32:50] these last three weeks. But but you you
[1:32:52] there in Hebrews 4. Amen. The word is
[1:32:55] living. It's discerning. It discerns
[1:32:57] between spirit and soul. It it you we're
[1:33:00] all naked with this word. This word is
[1:33:02] not just a dead letter. This word is the
[1:33:05] logos, the Christ, the anointing. It is
[1:33:09] God. Amen. in word form. That word is
[1:33:13] all knowing. That word held you and that
[1:33:17] word come seeking you.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Are you sure, brother W? Are you sure
[1:33:26] that that we're born that that that we
[1:33:28] are gene of God? Well,
[1:33:32] everyone else wants to put the church
[1:33:34] wants to put it like you come up here
[1:33:35] and shake the preacher's hand and you're
[1:33:37] born again.
[1:33:40] or you join a church and you're born
[1:33:43] again.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; My wife wishes we could produce babies
[1:33:47] like that. Shake my hand and boom, there
[1:33:50] comes Kobe. Shake her hand again and
[1:33:52] boom, here comes another one.
[1:33:55] If you're going to be if you're going to
[1:33:57] have a birth, you're going to have to
[1:33:58] have some labor and you're going to
[1:34:00] praise the Lord. You got to have a germ
[1:34:02] seed on the inside of you.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Before we get off of
[1:34:06] it, is this okay here this morning?
[1:34:09] Amen. 1 Peter 1:23, Sister Khalila.
[1:34:12] Amen.
[1:34:14] Being born again,
[1:34:18] not of sexual seed.
[1:34:22] He said that's corruptible.
[1:34:25] Corruptible is the sexual seeds. The
[1:34:28] sexual seed is what caused the fall in
[1:34:30] the beginning.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now being born again, Jesus
[1:34:37] was the only man on earth that never had
[1:34:39] to be born again.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus never had to be born again because
[1:34:47] it was the germ seed of God placed into
[1:34:50] the womb of Mary. He was a virgin
[1:34:54] son.
[1:34:56] And in order for you to be a virginborn
[1:34:59] son, you are born again not of
[1:35:02] corruptible or sexual seed, but of
[1:35:06] incorruptible
[1:35:07] by the word of God which lives and
[1:35:09] abides forever. There he's going back to
[1:35:12] the word. What is the word? The word,
[1:35:15] the logos holds the germ of life. The
[1:35:18] logos is God's book of life. Just like
[1:35:22] every one of you humans have a human
[1:35:25] book of life and it and it holds your
[1:35:27] chromosomes, your genes, and your
[1:35:29] gonomes or whatever that thing is,
[1:35:31] genomes. Amen. It holds those three
[1:35:33] things. Every one of you go look it up
[1:35:35] on the internet. Amen. Your your you
[1:35:37] every one of you have a book of life.
[1:35:40] They can go look in that book of life
[1:35:42] and they can take you all the way back
[1:35:44] before America was even a a a nation.
[1:35:48] It'll take your genes and it'll trace it
[1:35:50] all the way back.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that you're not born
[1:35:56] of that corruptible seed, but by the
[1:35:59] living
[1:36:00] word of God, the logos.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; That logos contain
[1:36:09] every gene seed of God.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; That's why you got to be born again.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Don't shake the preacher's hand. Come in
[1:36:18] contact with that great pillar of fire.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Be born again.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. Amen. Now watch now.
[1:36:32] Now, now if you were to before we go any
[1:36:34] further, Sister Cleina, won't you go
[1:36:36] now? He says you're not born of the
[1:36:37] corruptible seed, but the incorruptible,
[1:36:38] then go to that next verse. Amen. That'd
[1:36:41] be 1 Peter 1 and what? 24. For all
[1:36:45] flesh, humans,
[1:36:48] sexual seed, is as grass, and all the
[1:36:51] glory of man, as the flower of grass.
[1:36:54] The grass withers, the flower thereof
[1:36:57] faileth away.
[1:36:59] But the word of the Lord, endures
[1:37:03] forever.
[1:37:05] And this is the word which by the
[1:37:08] gospel, the living word is preached unto
[1:37:14] you. Someone shout hallelujah.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now think about do I have more
[1:37:21] time? Can I have some more time?
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Think about the power of election.
[1:37:26] Do you realize that the power of
[1:37:27] election is greater than the power of
[1:37:30] deception? Now, there's three major
[1:37:32] scriptures, prophecies that that that's
[1:37:34] for for this day.
[1:37:37] Amen.
[1:37:39] And I want you to catch how the Lord
[1:37:42] separates you. There's an identity
[1:37:45] taking place
[1:37:50] because the the word which you were
[1:37:53] birthed from cannot fail.
[1:37:56] Again, it's living. Now you look at
[1:37:58] these prophecies. Each of these gloomy
[1:38:01] prophecies in each of these gloomy
[1:38:03] prophecies are two groups. One just
[1:38:05] refuses to accept the word and will be
[1:38:07] deceived. And then the other by faith
[1:38:10] accepts and believes the word that look
[1:38:13] there at 2 Thessalonians 2:9.
[1:38:18] He says, "Even him, the Antichrist,
[1:38:21] whose coming is after the working of
[1:38:22] Satan, with all power and signs and
[1:38:24] lying wonders, and with all deceivleness
[1:38:26] of unrighteousness in them that perish,
[1:38:29] because they receive not the love of the
[1:38:31] truth, that they might be saved. For
[1:38:34] this cause God shall send them strong
[1:38:36] delusion that they should believe a lie,
[1:38:38] and they that are that they might all be
[1:38:40] damned, who believe not the truth, who
[1:38:43] had pleasure in unrighteousness."
[1:38:46] Now, this is this is the group that's
[1:38:47] just that's just going to look at the
[1:38:49] these are these are church members
[1:38:50] because the antichrist is not a sinner.
[1:38:54] The antichrist is going to be a
[1:38:56] religious man and people are going to
[1:38:58] follow this religious man.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; That's why I say follow the Bible.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Follow the message of the hour.
[1:39:06] Can you say amen?
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Now watch. So he says, "And they're all
[1:39:10] going to be damned who believe not the
[1:39:11] truth. They follow
[1:39:14] they follow man's interpretations and
[1:39:16] opinions and this that and the other
[1:39:17] when the Bible says it right here and
[1:39:19] they say, "Well, my preacher believes it
[1:39:20] this way." Well, the Bible says it right
[1:39:22] here, but ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[1:39:24] yeah, yeah. You're going to you're going
[1:39:25] you're going to be deceived. Scripture
[1:39:27] says you're going to be deceived and
[1:39:29] you'll be damned who who believe not the
[1:39:31] truth. But then look, but then he turns
[1:39:33] to you. The 13th verse. But we are bound
[1:39:37] to give thanks always to God for you,
[1:39:43] brethren, beloved of the Lord, because
[1:39:45] God, somebody point up, God hath from
[1:39:50] the beginning
[1:39:52] chosen you to salvation
[1:39:55] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:39:57] the belief of truth.
[1:40:02] He separated you from wrath. He
[1:40:04] separated you from judgment.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; The word done that.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Revelations 13:7 talking about this same
[1:40:13] Antichrist.
[1:40:15] And it given unto him, the antichrist,
[1:40:17] to make war with the saints, and to
[1:40:19] overcome them. And power was given over
[1:40:21] him given him over kindreds, tongues,
[1:40:23] and nations. And all that dwell upon the
[1:40:26] earth shall worship him. But then here
[1:40:28] comes the separation whose names are not
[1:40:32] written in the book of life of the lamb
[1:40:35] slain from the foundation of the world.
[1:40:39] He separated you.
[1:40:42] He separate your name. Are are you
[1:40:44] understanding that word image separates
[1:40:46] you? Well, praise the Lord.
[1:40:49] Amen.
[1:40:51] Hallelujah.
[1:40:52] What about what about Matthew 24 and 24?
[1:40:56] There shall be there shall arise false
[1:40:58] Christs, false prophets, and shall show
[1:41:01] great signs and wonders in so much.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; If it was possible,
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; they shall deceive the very elect.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Now, did it say it is possible? Did it
[1:41:17] say it's sort of possible? Or did it say
[1:41:20] it's not possible?
[1:41:23] The deception would be so great that if
[1:41:25] it were possible, it would even deceive
[1:41:28] me and you.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; That's when you need to put your
[1:41:32] shouting shoes on and say, "Thank you,
[1:41:34] Jesus.
[1:41:36] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:41:38] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for giving
[1:41:40] me Thank you for giving me a desire for
[1:41:42] your word. Thank you for giving me a
[1:41:44] desire for for the things of the Lord.
[1:41:46] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[1:41:47] you." Can you say, "Amen."
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Hebrews 2:14 in the amplified
[1:41:52] version it says therefore since these
[1:41:54] his children share in flesh and blood
[1:41:57] the the physical nature of mankind he
[1:42:00] himself in a similar manner also shared
[1:42:03] in the same physical nature but without
[1:42:05] sin so that through experiencing death
[1:42:08] he might make powerless ineffective
[1:42:11] impotent
[1:42:12] him uh impotent him who had the power of
[1:42:16] death that is the devil that he might
[1:42:19] free All those who through the haunting
[1:42:22] fear of death were held in slavery
[1:42:25] throughout their lives. Can I hear an
[1:42:27] amen?
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; So as we as we
[1:42:35] get ready to close,
[1:42:38] make it make it known. Don't don't don't
[1:42:42] don't don't for don't forget the fact
[1:42:44] that his word is what is what separates
[1:42:48] you.
[1:42:54] And though you were held as a slave by
[1:42:56] sin, God knew who you were. And he come
[1:42:59] to set you free
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; because the devil never did own you in
[1:43:05] the beginning.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:12] Amen. You you you remember at our nation
[1:43:15] back back in the slavery
[1:43:18] when our nation is a dark just you know
[1:43:20] just just a dark day. But we when when
[1:43:23] man would buy slaves
[1:43:26] and uh and they would trade slaves and
[1:43:30] Amen. And uh
[1:43:33] uh you know uh the Hollanders and and uh
[1:43:38] Amen.
[1:43:40] uh they would purchase slaves from
[1:43:43] Africa and and so the Dutch would take
[1:43:45] take these and you know they would they
[1:43:48] would sell them. They were they they
[1:43:50] were sold by their own people. Their own
[1:43:52] people and uh
[1:43:56] and and and and let me just say this,
[1:43:59] you know, God never intended for any man
[1:44:01] or woman to be slave. God made men and
[1:44:03] men made slaves.
[1:44:07] And the same spirit is very prevalent
[1:44:09] upon the earth today. Nation trying to
[1:44:11] make others to bow and men serving as
[1:44:14] tyrants toward other men.
[1:44:16] But they would take these and bring them
[1:44:18] to the Americas.
[1:44:22] And these enslaved people were
[1:44:25] somebody's
[1:44:27] husbands, wives, children.
[1:44:32] They were princes,
[1:44:34] businessmen back home. They were
[1:44:35] prominent men and women.
[1:44:40] And now here they are. They have been
[1:44:43] captured.
[1:44:44] They have been brought to America. Now
[1:44:47] they're the property of the slave owner.
[1:44:50] And they would literally they they would
[1:44:52] actually breed. They would take this
[1:44:54] strong man and breed to a strong woman.
[1:44:56] Breed them like animals trying to make a
[1:44:58] stronger stronger race.
[1:45:01] so they can get more work out of them.
[1:45:08] There were princes
[1:45:11] who were slaves.
[1:45:14] There were there were there was a there
[1:45:16] were there are you understanding
[1:45:19] these were held captive
[1:45:23] and it should have never been.
[1:45:29] So now here they are when they would
[1:45:31] come and that that had their children
[1:45:32] and they they were they would birth it.
[1:45:34] So they were born slaves.
[1:45:37] Many tried to get free and they couldn't
[1:45:39] get free. They'd be killed. They were
[1:45:42] beat. They were abused.
[1:45:46] They were murdered.
[1:45:52] Reminds me of a story of a of a certain
[1:45:55] man was walking through a plantation
[1:45:57] looking for a slave to trade for and
[1:46:01] the man happened upon that certain slave
[1:46:04] that was so different. He held his head
[1:46:06] up so high
[1:46:09] every you just watched him. He held his
[1:46:12] head high. He worked hard. He the guy
[1:46:15] asked, "Listen, what's what's so
[1:46:17] different about this guy here?" He said,
[1:46:19] "Do you feed him any different?" Right?
[1:46:21] There's something about him. He goes,
[1:46:22] "No, he's he's been that way since he's
[1:46:24] come." Holds his head high and he works
[1:46:26] hard. He says, "We don't have to whip
[1:46:28] him like we have to whip the others.
[1:46:30] He's he's he's
[1:46:32] not he's he's"
[1:46:36] They said, "Well, do do you feed him
[1:46:38] different?" "No." "Do you give him do
[1:46:40] you give him a different house?" "No."
[1:46:41] "You treat No. He's He's a slave like
[1:46:43] the rest of them. He said, "I I I
[1:46:46] wondered what what the deal was with
[1:46:47] him." And he said, "When I when I done a
[1:46:49] little bit of research, I found out
[1:46:52] that he is a prince,
[1:46:54] that his daddy
[1:46:57] is the king of a tribe of his tribe back
[1:47:01] home.
[1:47:02] And though he is here in slavery,
[1:47:07] royal blood
[1:47:09] flows through his veins.
[1:47:12] He is royal.
[1:47:15] And though he is many, many hundreds of
[1:47:17] miles away from the homeland,
[1:47:20] he holds his head up high.
[1:47:23] Are y'all hearing me? I I I want to tell
[1:47:26] you here today that the sons of God were
[1:47:31] slaves.
[1:47:34] We were sold by Adam into slavery.
[1:47:39] And sin held its head, held our head.
[1:47:42] But then the time came that listen, you
[1:47:46] are a son of God.
[1:47:53] on the year of Jubilee in the Old
[1:47:55] Testament, if you were to get if you
[1:47:57] were to uh ju just just stick with me
[1:47:59] another five minutes. But but if you
[1:48:00] were to take the Old Testament, I if if
[1:48:03] you were to fall in in in bondage to
[1:48:05] somebody, you owed somebody money or
[1:48:07] something, then you would then you would
[1:48:09] become their slave, if you couldn't pay
[1:48:12] it back or you you you were you were a
[1:48:14] servant to them. you you you didn't you
[1:48:17] you borrowed money or you uh you know
[1:48:21] what and whatever happened. Amen. Their
[1:48:24] property become yours and they're coming
[1:48:27] and and and and and they would go
[1:48:29] through that and the children would be
[1:48:30] born in slavery and and and they would
[1:48:33] be amen.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; But God said there would also be a year
[1:48:39] of jubilee.
[1:48:42] And when that year of Jubilee were to
[1:48:44] come,
[1:48:46] then all
[1:48:49] of those who were who lost their homes,
[1:48:53] who lost their their their crops, lost
[1:48:55] their land, lost everything they had
[1:48:58] that the that the slave owner had to re
[1:49:02] give them up to go back to their
[1:49:05] possession.
[1:49:10] Now, this was a type. This was a type of
[1:49:13] when Jesus was to come
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; because you were slaves, you couldn't
[1:49:17] pay the penalty. You couldn't pay the
[1:49:20] penalty. But when the Jew year of
[1:49:22] Jubilee came, when the year of Jubilee
[1:49:25] came,
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, you the the shackles had to
[1:49:29] come off. You were free to go back to
[1:49:31] your land. You were free to go back to
[1:49:33] your Are All of the children were free.
[1:49:36] everyone was free to go back home.
[1:49:39] Are y'all hearing me? And and I I I I I
[1:49:41] I want to say here today, amen. That
[1:49:45] that uh I I heard a story I I I heard a
[1:49:48] story back when when the the
[1:49:50] emancipation
[1:49:51] uh proclamation was given and the and
[1:49:54] and the time for the for the uh the
[1:49:57] slaves to be set free here in America.
[1:50:01] Amen. And they say that that it was set
[1:50:04] for a certain time. Amen. And there were
[1:50:07] some of those slaves. It was still dark.
[1:50:09] It was still dark, but at sunrise on
[1:50:11] this certain morning, everyone was going
[1:50:13] to get to go free. Amen. And and and and
[1:50:17] and the bunch of these slaves had got
[1:50:20] together. Amen. They began to station
[1:50:22] them because there was a lot of
[1:50:23] mountainous areas. And Amen. And they
[1:50:25] got down in the valley, they weren't
[1:50:27] going to see that sun for a long time.
[1:50:29] And so they they would station them all
[1:50:31] up and down all through the hidden the
[1:50:32] mountain and someone up on the mountain
[1:50:34] they could see when the sun begin to
[1:50:36] peek over and and then they would haul
[1:50:37] and when the sun peaked over when they
[1:50:40] first seen the sun they would begin to
[1:50:42] holler down the sun has risen. The sun
[1:50:45] has risen. The sun has risen. The sun
[1:50:49] has risen all the way down before you
[1:50:51] know it there was there was great
[1:50:53] celebration because the slaves were
[1:50:56] free. Well, I just want to tell you
[1:50:58] 2,000 years ago, amen, the cry came out,
[1:51:02] "The Son is risen." And we have been
[1:51:07] declaring it ever since. Sons of God,
[1:51:11] you're free.
[1:51:14] Daughters of God, you're free. You're
[1:51:17] free. You're free.
[1:51:20] You're free to live his word. You're
[1:51:22] free to believe his word. You're free to
[1:51:24] act upon his word. You're free to speak
[1:51:27] his word
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; if the musicians would come.
[1:51:33] Hallelujah.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:43] Hallelujah.
[1:51:46] Now,
[1:51:48] when God does the test,
[1:51:54] so there's two seeds on the earth today.
[1:51:56] There's the condemned seed,
[1:52:00] and there's the fallen seed.
[1:52:04] The serpent's seed was condemned,
[1:52:08] unredeemable.
[1:52:10] The fallen seed of God,
[1:52:14] redeemable.
[1:52:20] Jesus made it very clear.
[1:52:26] Matthew 13 and37. Sister Keys, if you'd
[1:52:28] put that up there and then and then
[1:52:30] we'll get ready to dismiss.
[1:52:33] And he answered and said unto them,
[1:52:36] he that sweth the good seed is the son
[1:52:39] of man.
[1:52:42] The field is the world.
[1:52:46] The good seed are the children of the
[1:52:48] kingdom. But the terrors are the
[1:52:51] children of the wicked one.
[1:52:55] The enemy that sold them is the devil.
[1:52:59] The harvest is the end of the world and
[1:53:01] the reapers are the angels.
[1:53:05] And therefore the terrors are gathered
[1:53:07] and burned in fire. So shall it be at
[1:53:10] the end of the world.
[1:53:14] The Son of Man shall send forth his
[1:53:15] angels, and they shall gather out of his
[1:53:18] kingdom
[1:53:20] all things that offend, and them that do
[1:53:23] iniquity,
[1:53:25] and shalt cast them in a furnace of
[1:53:28] fire, and there shall be wailing and
[1:53:29] nashing of teeth.
[1:53:32] Then shall the righteous shine forth as
[1:53:34] the son in the kingdom
[1:53:37] of their father.
[1:53:40] Who has ears to hear,
[1:53:43] let him hear.
[1:53:49] The world is the field. The seed is the
[1:53:52] word. The good one is the son of man.
[1:53:57] The evil swed the wicked seeds.
[1:54:01] So today we're going to have the tears
[1:54:03] and the wheat all growing together.
[1:54:07] They're going to use the same rain.
[1:54:08] They're going to grow in the same rain.
[1:54:10] They're going to grow with the same. The
[1:54:12] Bible says he sends his rain,
[1:54:15] the sun on the just and the unjust.
[1:54:19] Rain upon the good and the evil. All
[1:54:22] grows together.
[1:54:26] But there's only one thing to identify
[1:54:29] that can identify a believer
[1:54:34] and that's his word.
[1:54:38] So if if I
[1:54:40] bring it down to this one thing here,
[1:54:43] let's believe what God says.
[1:54:48] Let's be constantly looking into it now
[1:54:50] because we need to be changed.
[1:54:54] There's some ugly ugly you. That's all
[1:54:57] right. Be earnest with the word and take
[1:55:00] God's word.
[1:55:03] Let's start preparing as a bride adorn
[1:55:06] for her husband.
[1:55:09] The Bible says the bride has made
[1:55:12] herself ready.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; That's my job.
[1:55:18] Predestinated.
[1:55:20] The wedding band of predestination has
[1:55:22] already been slipped on my finger. Now
[1:55:24] help me, Lord, to walk in the in in in
[1:55:28] your word. Live according to that word.
[1:55:32] Amen. God bless you.
[1:55:36] Can you see in Can you see yourself in
[1:55:38] the mirror of God's word?
[1:55:41] Well, just not too clearly. Well, it's
[1:55:43] not the mirror that needs clean.
[1:55:48] God's word is clean.
[1:55:53] Let's take this.
[1:55:56] Is there an enthusiasm for the things of
[1:55:58] God?
[1:56:02] Is there something that
[1:56:04] we we look forward to praying? We look
[1:56:08] forward to spending that time with him.
[1:56:14] It's in those times when we look when we
[1:56:16] look spend with him that that we
[1:56:20] are able to meditate let him speak to us
[1:56:26] and he does speak his convicting powers
[1:56:29] there to
[1:56:32] and you know what there is nothing in
[1:56:34] your life there is nothing in your life
[1:56:38] right now there's nothing ever been in
[1:56:41] your life will ever will be in your life
[1:56:43] that the word cannot take.
[1:56:47] The cleansing agent of this blood is so
[1:56:49] powerful.
[1:56:52] So if you're looking in the word and
[1:56:53] you're seeing some flaws,
[1:56:58] just remember there's plenty of blood.
[1:57:00] The good thing about the word, the word
[1:57:02] became blood.
[1:57:04] The living logos in a body died on
[1:57:08] Calvary. The word was made flesh.
[1:57:12] The word, the word in the Old Testament
[1:57:14] was law.
[1:57:16] The word in the New Testament is grace.
[1:57:19] The word took on a body
[1:57:23] so that his blood can wash you.
[1:57:28] You said, "Where's the literal blood?"
[1:57:29] What it is saying is
[1:57:33] God's looking at you and say, "Listen,
[1:57:35] let's take that word, that detergent.
[1:57:38] Let's just go to the Lord. Let's just go
[1:57:39] in prayer. come before the throne room
[1:57:41] of grace. There is nothing too big.
[1:57:46] Nothing too big. No,
[1:57:53] I I I I
[1:57:55] don't want to just give all all kinds of
[1:57:57] excuses. If God says I'm his, he's mine.
[1:58:01] Well, great day. I want to come out of
[1:58:03] the prison cell.
[1:58:08] going to get those shackles off the mind
[1:58:10] and start thinking differently and
[1:58:11] acting differently and claiming
[1:58:13] differently because this is a day of
[1:58:15] rejoicing for the bride.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a crazy day of it's a it's a
[1:58:21] day of God's divine grace
[1:58:26] unlimited. Unlimited.
[1:58:29] Whatever you have need of,
[1:58:33] God has come.
[1:58:35] Amen. And he's made a beautiful image.
[1:58:40] Father, we thank you for your grace.
[1:58:44] And Lord, we thank you today for
[1:58:51] this image,
[1:58:55] this image of the word in signs.
[1:59:01] We thank you for that call upon our
[1:59:04] lives.
[1:59:07] Thank you for
[1:59:09] moving upon us and
[1:59:12] wooing us to you. And
[1:59:16] oh God,
[1:59:18] if there's some here, Lord, that
[1:59:21] they're really not
[1:59:24] they're really not
[1:59:26] going any further with you.
[1:59:31] They're just
[1:59:34] they're just here.
[1:59:37] Lord, I ask, Father, that you would
[1:59:40] quicken that seed within them
[1:59:47] because you didn't call us just to go to
[1:59:49] church or to have a religious affair,
[1:59:54] but you've called us, Lord, for
[1:59:57] great divine fellowship for you to live
[1:59:59] in and through us. What an exciting
[2:00:02] time,
[2:00:05] Lord. Break every shackle of sin,
[2:00:08] every shackle in our mind.
[2:00:11] I pray that the great Holy Spirit
[2:00:15] would come in such a wonderful way.
[2:00:19] Oh God,
[2:00:22] from all our heart, Lord, we love you.
[2:00:25] From the depths of our soul, we love
[2:00:27] you. We thank you for this grace.
[2:00:33] Hallelujah.
[2:00:35] Thank you for it, Lord.
[2:00:38] Thank you for it, Lord.

[2:06:53] believe it was And brother Andrew
[2:06:55] Glover. No, it was Daryl Ward. Daryl
[2:06:57] Ward said he was in a restaurant. Amen.
[2:07:00] He had ordered a steak and and uh Amen.
[2:07:03] when it came time to go uh pay, he says,
[2:07:08] the waitress comes up to him and says,
[2:07:09] "Now listen, your tickets already been
[2:07:12] paid for." Amen. So, so you're free to
[2:07:15] leave anytime you want. And he said, now
[2:07:18] he thought about arguing with her. Said,
[2:07:19] "Now listen, I don't know anybody in
[2:07:21] here." And Amen. I what you know I don't
[2:07:26] He says, "Now, well, now why would I do
[2:07:28] that? Why would I argue with her?" He
[2:07:30] said, "Well, let me at least take care
[2:07:32] of the tip." She said, "The tip was
[2:07:34] included.
[2:07:36] Eat your steak. You're free to go." And
[2:07:39] I say if God has already blessed us and
[2:07:41] he's he's called us his sons and his
[2:07:43] daughters, if he's called us the
[2:07:46] redeemed and says that he loves us, that
[2:07:49] he's paid the price for us.
