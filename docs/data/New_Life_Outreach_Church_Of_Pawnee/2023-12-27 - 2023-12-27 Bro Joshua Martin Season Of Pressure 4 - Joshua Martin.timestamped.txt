[36:36] tonight
[36:45] amen John 7
[36:47] and33 then Jesus said say I said unto
[36:51] them yet a little while I am with you
[36:54] then I go unto him that sent me ye shall
[36:57] seek me and shall not find me and where
[36:59] I am thither ye cannot come then said
[37:02] the Jews among themselves whether will
[37:04] he go that we shall not find him will he
[37:07] go into the uh unto the dispersed among
[37:10] the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles what
[37:12] manner of saying is this that he said ye
[37:15] shall seek me and shall not find me
[37:17] where I am thither ye cannot come in the
[37:20] last day and in the last day the great
[37:22] day of the feast Jesus stood and cried
[37:25] saying if any man thirst let him come
[37:27] unto me and drink he that believeth on
[37:29] me as the scripture hath said out of his
[37:31] belly shall flow rivers of Living Water
[37:34] but this spake he of the spirit which
[37:36] they had believed on him should receive
[37:38] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[37:41] because that Jesus was not yet glorified
[37:43] and many of the people therefore when
[37:45] they heard this saying said of a truth
[37:48] this is a prophet is the prophet others
[37:50] said this is the Christ but some said
[37:53] shall Christ come out of Galilee hath
[37:55] not the scripture said that that Christ
[37:57] cometh of the seed of David out of the
[37:59] town of Bethlehem where David was and
[38:02] this is what I want to catch out of this
[38:04] uh portion of scripture so there was
[38:06] division among the people because of him
[38:09] can we bow our heads tonight right dear
[38:12] gracious Heavenly Father Lord what a
[38:14] privilege it is to come into your house
[38:16] Lord God as we come into this part of
[38:18] the service Lord I ask that you would
[38:20] anoint me Father God As I Lay myself
[38:23] aside you see I'm nervous tonight Lord I
[38:25] ask that you'd help me to calm my nerves
[38:27] Lord Lord you see the needs of the
[38:30] people father I ask that you would come
[38:31] and speak in a mighty way father Lord
[38:34] only you can touch the hearts and meet
[38:36] the needs father you see the desires of
[38:38] the hearts Lord Lord we lay this service
[38:41] into your hands in Jesus name amen
[38:44] excuse me so if I had a title tonight
[38:47] you may be seated if I had a title I'm
[38:48] just going to continue on with a
[38:50] pressure that I've been speaking on for
[38:53] the last few Services I've been here I
[38:55] haven't uh spoken here in a couple
[38:57] months but I've been preaching these
[38:58] things on the road so I got a few
[39:00] different thoughts that I hope can make
[39:01] sense tonight but what I've been trying
[39:04] to show is pressure is trying to push us
[39:07] in a certain direction if we're not
[39:09] careful we can go in the opposite
[39:11] direction than what we're wanting to go
[39:13] you see one definition of pressure is
[39:16] the the use of persuasion influence or
[39:19] intimidation to make someone do
[39:22] something so pressure is pretty
[39:24] incredible pressure can influence
[39:26] pressure can persuade pressure can
[39:28] intimidate that's exactly what the devil
[39:31] is trying to do is push you in a
[39:33] direction influence your thought
[39:35] influence your actions influence the way
[39:37] you talk it's all by pressure you know
[39:40] like like we've said before somebody
[39:41] don't lose their temper right away but
[39:43] it's pressure upon pressure upon
[39:45] pressure and it makes somebody lose
[39:47] their temper and that's what the spirits
[39:49] of leot is doing with pressure after
[39:52] pressure is trying to make us lukewarm
[39:55] trying to make us form
[39:56] trying to make us powerless because we
[39:59] can't we can't overcome the enemy if
[40:01] we're powerless so he knows if he can
[40:03] get enough pressure against our mind
[40:05] against our bodies against our our our
[40:08] natural man it will start to bring us
[40:11] down you see how many has ever been
[40:13] driving down the road and you're in the
[40:15] fast lane going five miles over and
[40:17] somebody gets on your tail and they're
[40:19] they're right behind you they're trying
[40:21] to pressure you to get over normally I'm
[40:23] the guy that gets behind the car trying
[40:25] to PR pressure them what it is is you
[40:28] get on their tail and you're trying to
[40:29] let them know hey I don't like where
[40:31] you're at get over and whenever we feel
[40:34] the pressures of the enemy that's a good
[40:37] sign we're in a spot that the devil
[40:39] don't like he's coming with pressure
[40:42] saying get over I don't want you to
[40:44] defeat my kingdom I don't want you to
[40:45] overcome but that's a good sign we need
[40:48] to stand where we're at if you feel
[40:50] lukewarmness coming against you stand
[40:53] don't give in lukewarmness don't give in
[40:55] the formal ISM don't give in Leo but
[40:59] stand on the solid ground that God has
[41:01] given us and defy every intimidation you
[41:05] see that intimidating Spirit can come
[41:08] against your mind and say you can't
[41:10] believe that God sent a prophet because
[41:12] everybody is going to think you're
[41:14] strange if you witness at the job site
[41:17] they're not going to understand you
[41:18] they're going to think you're in a cult
[41:20] they're going to think you're crazy
[41:22] that's pressure and when you give in
[41:24] that that pressure you start to bow down
[41:26] to the enemy and you don't realize that
[41:29] every time you don't witness to somebody
[41:32] you're giving into pressure all right
[41:34] hey I've been there I've been you know
[41:35] working with co-workers and you get that
[41:38] little unction to witness and you're
[41:40] like well he's not going to understand
[41:42] he's going to think I'm crazy I'm giving
[41:44] in to pressure it's intimidation trying
[41:47] to put me down underneath its thumb but
[41:50] you see that takes away our Authority
[41:53] brother brandom says that's exactly
[41:55] right where we're standing irrelevant no
[41:57] matter what the word says well it's all
[41:59] right I believe it's all right you're
[42:01] presuming it's all right but the Bible
[42:04] says that's wrong and to presume is to
[42:07] Adventure without Authority you haven't
[42:10] got God's word and God's Authority
[42:13] behind it and that just struck me
[42:15] whenever I read that when we're
[42:16] presuming we got no we don't got God's
[42:19] Authority behind it and that's what
[42:22] pressure does it starts to push us where
[42:25] we're pursuing that the message is right
[42:27] we're just presuming that God sent a
[42:30] prophet we're just presuming that that
[42:32] there there's a body change we're
[42:33] presuming we're just hoping because the
[42:36] pressure is shaking up our faith oh but
[42:39] if we can just stand against the
[42:41] pressure there's all of Heaven backing
[42:44] us up we can believe for the impossible
[42:47] we can believe for God to heal the sick
[42:50] we can believe for miracles to take
[42:52] place even though the pressures are
[42:55] there you see it's pretty incredible you
[42:57] can have faith for so many people but
[43:00] once it comes to yourself it seems like
[43:02] you lack Faith how many's ever been
[43:04] there I know as a preacher whenever
[43:06] somebody comes up and and you pray for
[43:08] them you've got faith you know God can
[43:10] heal them but whenever I get sick of my
[43:12] body for some reason my faith starts to
[43:14] struggle what is it because it ain't my
[43:17] faith healing the people it's their
[43:19] faith coming in contact with God and now
[43:22] it's my faith that needs to come in
[43:24] contact with God but with pressure it
[43:27] starts to put my faith in a box oh my
[43:31] brother brandom says that we limit we
[43:34] limit the supernatural because of our
[43:36] faith we limit the power of God in our
[43:39] life because of our faith and that's
[43:41] what pressure is trying to do but
[43:44] brother brandom says this here there are
[43:46] so many voices in the Earth today that
[43:49] is it is absolutely a hard thing because
[43:52] it deadens the voice of the supernatural
[43:55] there are are so many intellectual
[43:58] voices so there's so many other voices
[44:00] out there that is trying to influence us
[44:04] away from the voice of God and I read
[44:06] this early and this really really hit me
[44:09] between the eyes brother brandom says it
[44:11] depends or what kind of spirit that is
[44:13] in you what you're feeding on he says
[44:16] your life is feeding on something and I
[44:19] thought my that is profound my life is
[44:22] feeding on something and that that
[44:24] pressure can put push me to feed on
[44:27] something that I ordinary would not what
[44:30] I normally wouldn't feed upon you know I
[44:32] think brother W was talking about it the
[44:35] other night whenever you come to study
[44:37] or come to pray all of a sudden you want
[44:39] to get on your phone all of a sudden you
[44:42] want to check Facebook all of a sudden
[44:43] you want to do this you want to do that
[44:46] it's pressure pushing you away from a
[44:49] life substance and trying to get you to
[44:52] feed on something else but you see a
[44:55] voice can influence you in a different
[44:57] direction you know the Bible would say
[44:59] in Genesis 3:7 and unto Adam he said
[45:03] because thou was hearken unto the voice
[45:06] of thy wife and brother brandom says he
[45:08] heard the voice of God but listen to the
[45:11] voice of Eve and am I that's that's
[45:13] something that we can think upon we can
[45:16] hear the voice of God but if we're not
[45:18] listening to it and we're being
[45:20] persuaded by another voice we're not
[45:23] going to see the Supernatural and
[45:25] brother Brandon would say this and today
[45:28] the one reason the church is in the
[45:30] condition that it's in is because there
[45:32] are so many voices so many of the voices
[45:35] to attract the church from the voice of
[45:38] god Till It's very doubtful that many
[45:40] would hear the voice of God though it
[45:43] spoke right in their midst they perhaps
[45:45] wouldn't even understand it because it
[45:47] would be a foreign thing to them they
[45:49] have got themselves so centered on the
[45:52] voices of the day he says the voice of
[45:55] God would would speak but we're so
[45:57] focused on the other voices that we
[46:00] wouldn't even hear the voice of God we
[46:02] wouldn't understand him hope you're
[46:04] following me this evening we can hear
[46:06] the voice of God but if we're being
[46:08] influenced if our life our life
[46:11] substance is coming from something else
[46:13] we're not going to hear the voice of God
[46:16] though it spoke right in our midst it
[46:18] would not have an effect on our life you
[46:21] see brother Brandon would preach a
[46:23] message the voice of God in the last
[46:25] days and he goes through many voices he
[46:28] says politics has a voice and he says
[46:31] that voice has now a stronger pull than
[46:34] the voice of God he says in the
[46:36] influence of politics is taken over the
[46:39] church and he was talking about the
[46:41] president that was just now voted in and
[46:43] he says this here is an example of it or
[46:45] they wouldn't have voted him in he says
[46:48] everybody I think he said at the time
[46:49] there were 70 people 70% of people
[46:52] claimed to go to church he says even
[46:54] though 70 % of the people claim to go to
[46:58] church the influence was from politics
[47:01] and so he say he's letting you know that
[47:03] the voice there's an influence behind
[47:06] the voice then he talks about Hollywood
[47:08] he says Hollywood has a voice and it's
[47:11] taken over the world he says let
[47:13] somebody come out of Hollywood with
[47:15] something and you'll find it all over
[47:17] the country he talks about Matt Dylan
[47:19] and gunm smoke he says he says Matt
[47:22] Dylan was a coward he says he would wait
[47:24] outside of do City and he would shoot
[47:26] the guys in the back he says he shot 16
[47:29] innocent men but he says and now the the
[47:32] now uh Hollywood has taken a hold of
[47:34] that and turns him into a hero and he
[47:37] says and now all of the little kitties
[47:39] is wearing the hats they've got the six
[47:41] shooters he says they can tell
[47:43] everything about Matt Dylan but they
[47:45] can't tell anything about Jesus he says
[47:48] the influence of it the voice of
[47:50] Hollywood has crept into the homes oh my
[47:54] we can look at that today hey he says
[47:56] Hollywood is just one place but the
[47:59] voice is into every home it's in every
[48:01] life and the same thing is today it's on
[48:04] our cell phones it's on our computers
[48:06] it's an influence where we can talk
[48:08] about this talk about that but what
[48:11] about the message what are we what is
[48:13] our life feeding upon you see brother
[48:16] the Brandon would then go on to talk
[48:18] about the dress he says no now Hollywood
[48:21] has powdered or influenced the way they
[48:23] dress the way they do their hair and he
[48:25] says now it's become the pattern he says
[48:28] now it's the pattern where everybody's
[48:30] got to dress that certain way
[48:32] everybody's got to do their hair the
[48:34] certain way he talks about uh John F
[48:37] Kennedy's wife he says she has become
[48:39] the pattern now everybody's wanting to
[48:41] dress like her what is it it's pressure
[48:45] and it's pushing somebody in a certain
[48:47] direction but brother Brandon would say
[48:49] this the church ought to know the voice
[48:52] of the trumpet of God on that but
[48:55] there's so much confusion because you
[48:57] see others do so examples don't pattern
[49:00] yourself after that kind of an example
[49:03] because it's perishable he's talking
[49:06] about Hollywood in the dress and he says
[49:08] always hear the voice of God what he
[49:11] says about it and I just love how he
[49:14] puts that even though the voice can be
[49:16] creeping and trying to influence you go
[49:19] back to the voice of God and see what
[49:22] the voice of God says about it and I'm
[49:24] so glad God gave us a message no matter
[49:27] the the the pressures no matter the
[49:30] influences we've got a TI poost we've
[49:33] got an absolute we've got something that
[49:35] we can come right back to and says right
[49:38] here's the final say no matter the
[49:40] intimidation no matter the influence no
[49:43] matter the pressure no matter the voices
[49:46] of the world I've got something I can
[49:49] line my life up with oh Hallelujah yes
[49:53] sir he's given us something that is our
[49:56] example oh my he's given us something
[49:59] that we can follow no matter the
[50:01] pressure I believe that the message can
[50:03] be an influence it can be what our what
[50:06] our life substance is coming from you
[50:09] may say wow I'm so glad I'm not
[50:11] influenced by Hollywood it's not my
[50:13] pattern but the same thing can come into
[50:15] a church you know brother brandham talks
[50:17] about Hollywood he talks about politics
[50:20] he talks about the the Eve's wife or
[50:22] Adam's wife he talks about so many voice
[50:25] say then he comes down to a church voice
[50:28] he says now the church has a voice too
[50:30] and if you're not careful you'll follow
[50:33] after a church voice instead of God's
[50:35] voice and I started to think about that
[50:37] and I thought my how could that be and
[50:40] it distract me I remember as a teenager
[50:43] that I had a complex that I I was never
[50:46] on drugs I was never on alcohol I never
[50:49] I I never smoked I never dranked and I
[50:51] never I didn't think God did anything
[50:53] for me I I never had didn't have a
[50:55] testimony and that was a complex that I
[50:58] had thinking that God never did anything
[51:00] for me and then it was Tim SCH that was
[51:02] preaching at our church one day and he
[51:04] says you know what many people think
[51:06] that they didn't go into the world they
[51:08] never drank they never smoked they never
[51:10] did this they never done that that God
[51:12] never did anything for them and I'm
[51:14] sitting there thinking wow I've been
[51:15] thinking that I've been thinking that
[51:17] for some time and he says but that's a
[51:19] greater testimony you're sitting in the
[51:21] midst of Satan's Eden and yet you're not
[51:24] defiled you see that was a voice that
[51:27] was whispering to me influencing me
[51:30] persuading me to push away what God has
[51:33] done for me come on now it's a voice
[51:37] that can come and say well since you're
[51:38] not doing this you're not doing that
[51:40] God's not working in your life since the
[51:42] church ain't doing this it ain't doing
[51:44] that God ain't in the church that's a
[51:46] church voice trying to persuade you away
[51:50] from the voice of God oh but I believe
[51:52] if the message is being preached we
[51:54] might not be dancing the aows might not
[51:56] be speaking in tongues but if the
[51:58] message the voice is being preached the
[52:01] life of God the supernal is here Among
[52:04] Us oh the shout of the king is in the
[52:07] camp the voice of God is being preached
[52:10] there somebody believing there's
[52:12] somebody receiving it and that's
[52:14] becoming their influence oh my it's
[52:17] become their influence yes but if we're
[52:20] not careful we look at something else
[52:23] and say my that's great that's wonderful
[52:26] but God ain't doing nothing for me oh my
[52:28] but that doesn't mean God ain't doing
[52:30] something for you you might be in a
[52:32] certain season you might be in a spot
[52:35] where you're not hearing God so loud but
[52:37] he might be in a still Small Voice the
[52:39] Supernatural is still there you just got
[52:42] to make sure you're feeding on the right
[52:44] thing don't let the pressure get to you
[52:48] you know I was I was studying all these
[52:50] things today I started to think about it
[52:52] how many was here uh two two Sunday
[52:54] nights ago it was it last Sunday night
[52:56] but the Sunday night before and our dad
[52:58] was preaching on healing and the Lord
[53:00] just come and started to move um I think
[53:03] there was many miracles that was taking
[53:05] place we was up here praying for the
[53:07] people and many people were crying God
[53:09] was touching and that was great but what
[53:11] about Wednesday night you I started to
[53:13] think upon these lines what about
[53:15] Wednesday night we didn't have one one
[53:17] uh dried out not one person crying
[53:20] nobody come up for prayer nobody came to
[53:22] the altar but Dad was teaching he was
[53:24] teach preaching on Christmas and on the
[53:26] son of man did that mean that the
[53:29] supernatural wasn't with us like it was
[53:31] Sunday
[53:32] night the same God that was moving up
[53:35] here Sunday night was the same God that
[53:38] was moving Wednesday night he may have
[53:40] been working in a different way but it
[53:43] was the same God the same Supernatural
[53:46] the same voice coming and touching
[53:48] Hearts it don't matter where you are at
[53:51] If the message is being preached If the
[53:54] message is being accepted that is the
[53:57] voice of God that's the life of Christ
[54:00] coming on the inside and living its Life
[54:03] Through Your
[54:05] Vessel but then we move on to Sunday
[54:08] morning here Dad preaching again up the
[54:11] Sunday morning's message was powerful
[54:13] and that was wonderful but Sunday night
[54:15] come along and we have a Christmas
[54:17] program and what happens we had a
[54:18] Christmas play we wasn't here we was at
[54:20] the house because our kids were sick and
[54:22] we watched the Christmas play and I felt
[54:24] the presence of God has come in our
[54:26] house then brother Merl started doing
[54:28] his skits and the anointing of God just
[54:30] come down it's the same Supernatural if
[54:33] we're dancing the aisles if we're
[54:34] speaking in tongues if we're doing
[54:36] cartwheels or if it's just teaching if
[54:39] it's just a play if it's that if it's
[54:41] the message of God coming across it is
[54:44] the life of God it's the
[54:47] supernatural oh we put God in a box
[54:50] where we got to be shouting we got to be
[54:52] speaking in tongues but what about the
[54:54] word that's coming forth come on now we
[54:57] can't just put it off upon all of the
[54:59] emotion and let let the teaching alone
[55:02] the same anointing that is with the
[55:05] emotion and the dancing is the same
[55:07] anointing that is with the
[55:09] teaching come on now it's a pressure
[55:12] that is trying to persuade you that if
[55:15] we're not doing these things if it's not
[55:16] a camp meeting God ain't speaking to us
[55:19] the same God that speaks at our youth
[55:21] camp is the same God that is speaking
[55:24] here tonight the same God that speaks at
[55:26] Easter is the same God that is speaking
[55:29] here on Sunday mornings on Sunday nights
[55:32] on Wednesday nights if for Willing that
[55:35] feed off of the right
[55:37] thing oh my we don't want to be feeding
[55:40] off of a church voice and Fa to hear the
[55:43] voice amen oh come on what do you mean
[55:46] brother Josh we can feed off of a
[55:48] personality we can feed off of a gift we
[55:51] can feed off these things and Fa to feed
[55:54] off of the the message of the hour you
[55:56] know I know Dad talked about whenever he
[55:58] first come the pony he could sing he
[56:00] could preach he can play and he was the
[56:02] H of py everybody just loved dad but
[56:05] there was no substance there he needed
[56:07] something to to to to feed the people
[56:10] then once he come into the message of
[56:12] the hour there was a different
[56:14] attraction people wasn't attracted to
[56:16] his singing no more they weren't
[56:18] attracted to his playing no more but now
[56:20] they was attracted to the message come
[56:23] on now you got to make sure you're
[56:26] attracted by the right thing we're not
[56:28] attracted by gifts we're attracted by
[56:30] the message of the hour oh my but you
[56:34] see pressure can push us in way you see
[56:37] here's the quote I was talking about
[56:38] brother Brom says in the system of Eli a
[56:41] priest instead of a prophet the prophet
[56:43] is the word the priest was the church
[56:45] it's God in such a place till it begin
[56:48] to lose that the word is forign to the
[56:51] people they get it they cannot speak it
[56:53] they don't understand it because they're
[56:55] not trained to it Paul said if the
[56:58] trumpet gives an uncertain sound who
[57:00] will prepare himself to battle the
[57:03] people are so trained to a church voice
[57:06] a church trumpet we've got more in our
[57:09] Sunday school than the rest of them that
[57:11] don't mean a thing we got more in our
[57:13] denomination than the rest of them's got
[57:15] we're the biggest among the
[57:16] denominations see that's the kind of
[57:19] voice that the people are trained for oh
[57:22] my they're trained for a certain voice
[57:25] that they miss the voice of God oh my
[57:28] but I believe that there is a true bride
[57:31] not the false bride not the false fine
[57:33] but there is a true bride that is
[57:36] attracted to one thing that is the voice
[57:40] oh my I start I was thinking on these
[57:42] things you know God used a donkey to
[57:44] speak one time God used a burning bush
[57:47] to speak one time and so now if God
[57:49] wants to speak in a certain way I want
[57:52] to be willing to listen to what God is
[57:55] saying oh my because if we're not
[57:57] careful the gr the grass is greener on
[58:00] the other side of the fence and what
[58:02] that does is is it gets you in uncontent
[58:04] when you're not willing to step there
[58:06] and feed off of where you're at but
[58:09] you're trying to feed off this one
[58:10] you're trying to feed off that one
[58:12] you're trying to feed off this one and
[58:14] you're failing to see what God is doing
[58:17] right in your midst you know brother
[58:18] brandom talked about how the church
[58:20] people is always thanking God for what
[58:23] he did yesterday looking forward to what
[58:25] he's going to do tomorrow but fa to see
[58:28] what he's doing right now oh come on
[58:31] somebody we can be sitting in a church
[58:33] pew but looking over across the country
[58:36] saying wow I wish I was there they've
[58:38] got the power of God the power of God is
[58:41] where the message is being preached I'm
[58:44] preaching now I'm talking about pressure
[58:47] that is trying to get you and content
[58:49] with what God is doing in your life oh
[58:53] my I hope this is okay tonight
[58:55] like I said these are some things I've
[58:57] been preaching and so I'm I put
[58:59] everything together and I hope it makes
[59:00] sense tonight you see remember when
[59:02] brother Brandon was preaching letting go
[59:04] off the pressure and I talked about this
[59:07] a few times ago when I preached and I
[59:09] and as you listen to that tape brother
[59:11] brandom is preaching he's preaching then
[59:13] it it cuts off it comes back on and he's
[59:16] praying and and I never caught that
[59:19] until I was listening to it a few months
[59:21] ago and brother brandom explains what
[59:23] happens he's he's and he starts to pray
[59:26] and he says Lord while I was preaching
[59:28] letting off the pressure the devil
[59:31] thought he could run me from this pull
[59:33] pit and he cut off the power and so the
[59:35] power went off but brother brandom says
[59:37] he kept on preaching because he knew
[59:40] there was somebody out there that needed
[59:43] to hear him and he says as the last
[59:45] person come to the altar the power come
[59:48] back on and I thought my it was pressure
[59:51] way back then trying to get the prophet
[59:54] to let go and get out of the pull pit
[59:56] and it's pressure today upon the
[59:59] fivefold ministry you can't preach that
[1:00:01] you can't quote that quote you can't say
[1:00:03] this you can't say that but as the
[1:00:05] prophet defined the pressure there is
[1:00:08] still a five-fold Ministry today that is
[1:00:10] defying the pressure and letting the
[1:00:12] people know that the message ain't a
[1:00:15] preacher's message it's your message
[1:00:18] this say Malachi 4 ain't just the
[1:00:20] pastors it's your Prophet this is your
[1:00:23] inheritance this is your power it's your
[1:00:26] anointing oh my but what happens is we
[1:00:30] try to get a few holy men and we get the
[1:00:32] anointing away from the people the
[1:00:34] anointing a't for a few holy men the
[1:00:37] message come to do away with that and
[1:00:39] says it's a bride body it's a bride body
[1:00:42] the anointing that is behind the pulpit
[1:00:45] it's in every Mama it's in every Daddy
[1:00:47] it's in every teacher it's in every
[1:00:50] preacher it's not just one man but it's
[1:00:52] a multi membered body but it's pressure
[1:00:56] that tries to influence you and say it's
[1:00:58] not for you it's just for a few men
[1:01:01] that's not the case it's for you if
[1:01:04] you've got a heart to receive the word
[1:01:06] you've got something that is compatible
[1:01:08] with the supernatural if you're willing
[1:01:11] to feed off of it oh my brother Brandon
[1:01:14] would say h this is a portion of the
[1:01:17] quote I was talking about he says it may
[1:01:19] seem very strange father very simple you
[1:01:22] make things so simple that we won't Aram
[1:01:25] because they that raised out of their
[1:01:27] seat and come on the invitation because
[1:01:30] that Satan tried to keep them from doing
[1:01:33] it every effort he could put forth he
[1:01:36] tried to do it but he lost so it wasn't
[1:01:39] just for the brandom Under Pressure to
[1:01:42] get out of the pull pit but it was the
[1:01:44] people that was under pressure not to
[1:01:47] not to receive what he was
[1:01:50] saying oh my so it ain't just the Pullin
[1:01:53] that is under attack the congregation is
[1:01:56] under attack it's putting question marks
[1:01:59] there I can't believe that that this one
[1:02:01] can get the Holy Ghost anymore what it's
[1:02:03] pressure there's some saying God don't
[1:02:05] fill with the Holy Ghost anymore some
[1:02:07] saying that that that the message did
[1:02:10] away with the with the tongues and with
[1:02:12] the dancing that's not the case it's
[1:02:14] pressure trying to get us away from what
[1:02:17] the message has brought us you see God
[1:02:19] still heals the sick God still fills
[1:02:22] with the Holy Ghost but you see somebody
[1:02:25] has to defy the pressure you see that
[1:02:28] the person that was in the congregation
[1:02:30] brother Brom says Satan lost because
[1:02:32] they got up and come anyways and I think
[1:02:35] my let me be that person here in the
[1:02:38] middle of Le the causes Satan to lose
[1:02:41] that he can come with mind battles he
[1:02:43] can come with influences come with
[1:02:45] intimidation come with pressure but I
[1:02:47] said no say not today I've got a voice
[1:02:50] that I'm attracted to oh my the Bible
[1:02:53] would say a man Matthew 24 and 28 for
[1:02:56] wheresoever the carcass is there the
[1:02:58] Eagles will be gathered together oh my
[1:03:03] where the carcass is they're the Eagles
[1:03:06] not a gift no not a personality but the
[1:03:09] carcass that's good that's good oh my
[1:03:13] let me say this if somebody is attracted
[1:03:16] around a gift what are
[1:03:18] they come on now if the Eagles are
[1:03:21] gathered around the carcass what are
[1:03:23] they that's gathered run a gift all
[1:03:25] right all right I I'll go on now he
[1:03:27] didn't appoint us to a gift he pointed
[1:03:30] us to a carcass it says here's the word
[1:03:33] we're not following man anymore we're
[1:03:35] following the word oh hallelujah oh my
[1:03:40] but now it's pressure that comes and he
[1:03:42] says you can't go preach for this hope
[1:03:44] this is okay this evening I've been
[1:03:46] studying going these things and brother
[1:03:47] Brandon I I don't got the quote in front
[1:03:49] of me I wish I would have got it here
[1:03:51] but brother brandham says that it's my
[1:03:53] job to stand in between them and unite
[1:03:56] him he says this one's against this one
[1:03:58] that one's against this one this one's
[1:04:00] fighting this one and he says as long as
[1:04:02] you're fighting each other the Devils
[1:04:04] don't even you don't got to fight you on
[1:04:07] and there's so much of that going on
[1:04:09] today I think that's the attitude of the
[1:04:11] Bride this one's fighting this one this
[1:04:13] one's against this one let us stand
[1:04:16] together and say we are all the Bride of
[1:04:18] Jesus Christ following the same
[1:04:22] message you might see it that way you
[1:04:25] might see it this way you might think it
[1:04:26] that way but we are all a part of one
[1:04:29] body that is Jesus Christ oh the Life of
[1:04:33] Christ is in my heart just like it's in
[1:04:35] your heart the anointing is in my church
[1:04:38] just like it's in your church we're all
[1:04:41] one
[1:04:42] body oh my we're all one body you see
[1:04:47] but we're going to Humble ourself to
[1:04:49] something we can look at Daniel the
[1:04:51] pressure was trying to get Daniel to
[1:04:53] hold humble himself to the king and
[1:04:56] that's exactly what pressure today is
[1:04:58] trying to do is get your Allegiance away
[1:05:01] from the word and on to something else
[1:05:04] you see brother brandom talks about the
[1:05:06] natural he says your first steps you're
[1:05:08] led by somebody he says your last steps
[1:05:11] you're led by somebody he says as he
[1:05:14] start to walk you might fall down but
[1:05:16] the same hand that is leading you picks
[1:05:18] you back up and he says you get to a
[1:05:20] certain age then you're handed over to
[1:05:22] his teacher that teacher leads you
[1:05:25] through an education then the teacher
[1:05:27] gives you back to your mother where she
[1:05:29] makes you a housewife or you turn over
[1:05:31] to your father where he teaches you
[1:05:33] about business he says we're LED every
[1:05:36] step of the way but then he comes down
[1:05:38] and then he says this here but he says
[1:05:40] but now who leads you he says that's the
[1:05:43] question now we're all led by something
[1:05:46] tonight we have to be were
[1:05:49] LED on just think about that now who is
[1:05:52] leading you now why does driving you
[1:05:55] what is pushing you is it a job is it
[1:05:57] Sports is it is it money is it this is a
[1:06:00] popularity what is leading you I believe
[1:06:04] if we're led by the right thing we're
[1:06:06] going to be going in the right direction
[1:06:08] you see what brother Brandon would say
[1:06:10] this a sheep is perfectly helpless he
[1:06:13] cannot go by himself that's the reason
[1:06:16] God likened him likened his believing
[1:06:18] children Hunter sheep they've got to be
[1:06:21] guided but watch what's guiding you
[1:06:24] don't be don't get a goat he'll walk you
[1:06:26] to the slaughter pin God never gives us
[1:06:29] goats he gives us his son the holy
[1:06:31] spirit to guide us he is our God not
[1:06:35] some man-made herdsman oh I love that
[1:06:37] not some man-made herdsman but a God
[1:06:40] given herdsman who feeds the Sheep upon
[1:06:43] sheep food who feeds the Sheep upon
[1:06:47] sheep food but he's letting you know
[1:06:49] we're all Guided by something make sure
[1:06:51] you're not Guided by a goat come on if
[1:06:54] you're Guided by a goat he's leading you
[1:06:56] to the slaughter pin but if you're
[1:06:58] Guided by the spirit of Truth is going
[1:07:00] to lead you into all
[1:07:03] truth all truth you see we're all being
[1:07:05] led by something but we got a choice of
[1:07:08] what we're going to be led by and
[1:07:10] brother the Brandon whenever he was
[1:07:12] overseas I think he was in Israel excuse
[1:07:15] me I've been having some ssts so just
[1:07:18] bear it with me tonight but brother
[1:07:19] Brandon was talking about how whenever
[1:07:22] he was over in the east and he seen a
[1:07:24] shepherd with some sheep and he says he
[1:07:26] was watching these sheep as they were
[1:07:28] coming into the city and he says he seen
[1:07:31] the all the cars started to stop and the
[1:07:34] shepherd was bringing the Sheep across
[1:07:36] the street and everything and he says
[1:07:38] then they started to go up the city to
[1:07:40] the market and he says over there the
[1:07:42] market is like a like a neighborhood
[1:07:44] market or or a farmers market he says
[1:07:46] everything is outside for everybody to
[1:07:49] go and look the bread the the the meat
[1:07:50] everything like that is all outside and
[1:07:53] he says he's watching the sheep and he
[1:07:55] says okay here's the riot now once those
[1:07:57] sheep see the goodies they're going to
[1:07:59] go crazy and he's watching them waiting
[1:08:02] for this to take place and he says he's
[1:08:04] watching he's watching and they all the
[1:08:06] sheep look at the goodies but then look
[1:08:08] right back at the shepherd and just kept
[1:08:10] on following the shepherd He says not
[1:08:12] one of them went to get the goodies but
[1:08:15] followed the shepherd and then he says
[1:08:17] this oh if I only had known their
[1:08:19] language I would have stopped the
[1:08:21] traffic myself and preached them a
[1:08:23] sermon on what I had just seen when you
[1:08:26] are sheep that belong to the great
[1:08:28] Shepherd you follow right along in each
[1:08:31] of his steps just like those sheeps did
[1:08:34] you won't be tempted to turn aside for
[1:08:36] some big flower of a church or listen to
[1:08:39] the voice of some DD or PhD or lld but
[1:08:42] you will stay with the shepherd the
[1:08:45] Bible says the Sheep know his voice and
[1:08:47] and they follow him but a stranger's
[1:08:50] voice that caused them to flee and run
[1:08:52] after the true sh Shepherd praise God he
[1:08:55] says if you're a true sheep following
[1:08:58] the true Shepherd you can see those
[1:09:00] other things but it's not the attraction
[1:09:03] the shepherd's the
[1:09:06] attraction oh you can see this pop up
[1:09:08] that pop up this pressure that influence
[1:09:11] that persuasion but our eyes is on one
[1:09:14] thing that is Jesus Christ they same
[1:09:17] yesterday today and forever and that is
[1:09:21] leading us all the way to the coming of
[1:09:24] the Lord you believe that tonight oh my
[1:09:27] you see so I like how the Bible puts
[1:09:30] that that that that there was division
[1:09:32] among the people because of him and I
[1:09:34] was just I was reading that on my
[1:09:36] devotions and that just when I'm sure
[1:09:38] the preachers could can relate you can
[1:09:40] just read something something just
[1:09:41] stands out to you you're like whoa I've
[1:09:43] read that before but there was division
[1:09:46] among the people because of him he
[1:09:48] wasn't bringing the division but there
[1:09:51] was division because the people had
[1:09:53] their own own ideas brother the brandom
[1:09:56] says they were trained the priests the
[1:09:58] preachers were trained in the coming of
[1:10:00] the law coming of the Messiah but they
[1:10:02] had their own interpretation on how he
[1:10:05] was to come oh my think about that now
[1:10:09] they knew he was coming but it had to be
[1:10:11] a certain way oh my many people do the
[1:10:14] same thing the church services have to
[1:10:17] be a certain way we know he's going to
[1:10:19] come but this has got to happen that's
[1:10:21] got to happen this is going to take
[1:10:23] place going to miss him if you're
[1:10:25] looking for something to take place you
[1:10:27] might miss him but if he's speaking if
[1:10:30] he's walking the ow don't fail to miss
[1:10:33] him look for him he's walking the ow
[1:10:37] he's still talking and taking taking the
[1:10:39] needs before the Thro you see what was
[1:10:41] causing the division was the people's
[1:10:44] opinions you see they couldn't submit
[1:10:46] themselves to divine revelation you look
[1:10:49] at Nicodemus the Bible would say in John
[1:10:51] 3 and 2 the same come to Jesus by night
[1:10:55] and said unto him Rabbi we know thou are
[1:10:58] a teacher from God no denying it we know
[1:11:01] you're a teacher from God for no man can
[1:11:03] do these things th Le unless God be with
[1:11:06] him and I could just say you have
[1:11:08] compassion for this guy because he
[1:11:11] really seen him wow there's something
[1:11:13] different about you Jesus no man can do
[1:11:16] these things unless God is with him how
[1:11:19] can you explain it but the pressure was
[1:11:21] so strong the pressure was so strong
[1:11:24] that he couldn't follow him he had to
[1:11:26] turn away because of the pressure oh my
[1:11:30] don't let us be that way that we can see
[1:11:33] something taking place but all might
[1:11:35] because because the pressure we fail to
[1:11:37] see Jesus hope this is okay tonight you
[1:11:40] see but the brandom talks about the
[1:11:42] denominations he says he they have the
[1:11:44] they have the they have the word right
[1:11:46] with them but then they formed their own
[1:11:48] way of it then the children accepted it
[1:11:51] he says the children accepted
[1:11:54] and now the spirit of God is bringing
[1:11:56] forth truth but they can't receive it
[1:11:59] because they're so the they're tied down
[1:12:01] by what the father's brought and I
[1:12:03] thought my each generation is going to
[1:12:06] get worse and going to get worse and
[1:12:08] going to get worse andless you stick
[1:12:10] with the
[1:12:11] message that's such an assurance to a
[1:12:14] parent that if I stick with the message
[1:12:16] my children is going to be okay if I
[1:12:19] stick with us sayith the Lord my
[1:12:21] children is going to see the rapture my
[1:12:23] children is going to walk on the streets
[1:12:26] of Glory but brother bandom says they
[1:12:28] had the word with him but they started
[1:12:30] to mix their own ideas with it then
[1:12:33] right after the Next Generation they was
[1:12:35] totally off and brother brandom says
[1:12:37] they're doing the same thing today that
[1:12:40] make it so complicated that they fail to
[1:12:43] see what the spirit is really seeing you
[1:12:46] see brother Brandon was say God can give
[1:12:48] a man a start and give him a Ministry
[1:12:51] and the first thing you know he says he
[1:12:53] will go to catering to what others are
[1:12:55] saying and he says the first thing you
[1:12:57] know is the Lord will take his hand off
[1:12:59] of him and take his anointing to
[1:13:02] something to somebody else and he says
[1:13:04] here and then he will try to find him
[1:13:07] another man somebody that will do it
[1:13:10] he's got to find somebody that will take
[1:13:12] his word take divine revelation and
[1:13:15] won't move with it stay right on that
[1:13:18] word that's the way he does it he's
[1:13:20] always doing it that way he says he can
[1:13:24] give a man a Ministry and give him
[1:13:26] something but as as soon as he starts to
[1:13:28] cater with somebody else's opinions the
[1:13:31] anointing comes from him and he goes to
[1:13:34] find somebody else and I think my that's
[1:13:36] not just for preachers that's for us as
[1:13:38] well that's for mas and for daddies and
[1:13:41] teenagers as long as you're catering to
[1:13:43] these other ideas it's going to pull the
[1:13:46] anointing from you come on now but the
[1:13:49] anointing is in the message of the
[1:13:52] hour oh mind you see we're going to
[1:13:54] Humble oursel to something or someone
[1:13:57] we're sheep we're being led by something
[1:13:59] but you see the the uh the Bible would
[1:14:02] say and this is I just love the
[1:14:04] scripture this is just stood out to me
[1:14:06] several times in Revelations 3 and8 I
[1:14:08] counsel thee so buy of me gold tried on
[1:14:11] the fire that thou mayest be rich white
[1:14:14] ra and white and white rment that thou
[1:14:16] mayest be cloth that the shame of thy
[1:14:19] nakedness do not appear anoint thine
[1:14:21] eyes with Isa that thou mayest see as
[1:14:25] many as I love I rebuke and chasen be
[1:14:28] zealous therefore and repent and behold
[1:14:31] to stand at the door and knock If any
[1:14:33] man hear my voice and open the door I
[1:14:36] will come into him and will s with him
[1:14:39] and he with me he's letting the church
[1:14:42] know if you can repent I will come and
[1:14:44] Sh with you but there's nothing in the
[1:14:47] the make Believers the unbelievers to
[1:14:49] Humble themselves but there is something
[1:14:51] on the inside of the Bride that is
[1:14:53] willing to humble themsel and that just
[1:14:56] stood out to me if you're willing to
[1:14:58] humble yourself then you're able to open
[1:15:00] the door then once you open the door
[1:15:03] then the voice can come in and Sh with
[1:15:05] you and I say Lord let me humble myself
[1:15:08] to every part of the message every
[1:15:10] Avenue of my heart every Avenue of my
[1:15:13] house of my marriage of my family I'm
[1:15:16] humbling myself so that the voice can
[1:15:19] come in and St with me not the natural
[1:15:22] voice not not for the prom's voice but
[1:15:24] the word the message let it take control
[1:15:27] of every aspect of my life but it's
[1:15:30] going to take humility to hear the voice
[1:15:33] you see the the Bible would say in 2
[1:15:36] Chronicles 7:14 If my people which are
[1:15:39] called by my name shall humble
[1:15:42] themselves yes amen excuse me he's
[1:15:44] making a proclamation he's he's claiming
[1:15:47] a people if my people which are called
[1:15:50] by my name shall humble them themselves
[1:15:53] he's letting this people know if you're
[1:15:55] called by my name there's something
[1:15:58] inside that is willing to humble
[1:16:00] yourself and oh my if you're a true part
[1:16:03] if you're truly a part of this bride
[1:16:05] there's something on the inside that
[1:16:07] says Amen to every part of the message
[1:16:10] if it hurts it hurts if it cuts it cuts
[1:16:13] if it digs it digs but there's something
[1:16:16] on the inside that is humbling myself to
[1:16:19] it oh
[1:16:21] my I'll bring this down to a close here
[1:16:23] in a few minutes just bear with my bear
[1:16:25] with my voice here uh you see brother
[1:16:28] Brandon well the Bible would tell us
[1:16:30] here that the Pharisees started to pray
[1:16:33] and in Luke 18 And1 the Pharisees stood
[1:16:36] and prayed thus with himself he's
[1:16:38] talking about two people that come and
[1:16:40] started to pray and the Pharisees stood
[1:16:42] and prayed thus with himself God I thank
[1:16:46] thee that I'm not as the other men are
[1:16:49] exorts unjust adulterers even as this
[1:16:53] Publican so the Bible is saying there's
[1:16:54] two men that come to pray a Pharisee and
[1:16:57] a Publican the publicans over here and
[1:17:00] he says I fast twice I I fast twice in
[1:17:03] the week I gave tithes all that I
[1:17:05] possess and here he is throwing up to
[1:17:08] God what he's done his knowledge what
[1:17:11] he's achieved what I'm doing and here
[1:17:13] God says what are you doing I'm not
[1:17:16] coming this way I'm coming to the humble
[1:17:19] the next verse and the Publican standing
[1:17:22] a far off would not lift up so much as
[1:17:24] his eyes into heaven but smoted upon his
[1:17:27] breast saying God be merciful to me a
[1:17:30] sinner I tell you this is Jesus talking
[1:17:33] I tell you this man went down to his to
[1:17:36] his house Justified rather than the
[1:17:39] other for everyone that exalt exalteth
[1:17:42] himself shall be a based and he that
[1:17:45] humbleth himself shall be
[1:17:49] exalted and let that that that is
[1:17:51] letting us know if you're willing to lay
[1:17:53] everything aside all of your
[1:17:55] achievements all of your smarts all of
[1:17:58] your gifts all of your popularity and
[1:18:01] come humble then watch God exalt hey I
[1:18:05] want as an evangelist I want God to
[1:18:08] exalt my Ministry not me if I exalt my
[1:18:11] Ministry somebody's going to tear it
[1:18:13] down if if if a pastor exalts himself
[1:18:16] somebody's going to tear it down but if
[1:18:18] God exalts it if God exalts a marriage
[1:18:22] nobody is going to tear it apart if God
[1:18:24] exalts a church nobody has a right to
[1:18:27] close the doors if God is doing
[1:18:30] something nobody can tear it
[1:18:33] down oh my brother brandom says here it
[1:18:36] won't be you exalting yourself but it
[1:18:39] would be God himself doing the exalting
[1:18:42] oh if you can just come humble then it
[1:18:44] won't be you exalting yourself it's God
[1:18:47] Luke 1: 52 and he put down the mighty
[1:18:50] from their seats and exalted them of low
[1:18:53] degree you know I've been listening to
[1:18:56] uh why had to be
[1:18:57] Shepherds and brother Brandon just goes
[1:18:59] through the whole message letting you
[1:19:02] know that uh the Shepherds were they
[1:19:04] didn't have much smarts they were
[1:19:05] unlearned but he says he passed all of
[1:19:09] the smart guys all the ones that were
[1:19:11] learned all the ones that had an
[1:19:13] education passed all of them up and come
[1:19:16] to the Shepherds and I was listening to
[1:19:19] that I started crying I said Lord thank
[1:19:22] you for letting me know I might not be
[1:19:24] smart I might not be learned I might not
[1:19:27] have an education but you still come to
[1:19:29] me you let me know that the Messiah is
[1:19:32] on Earth but the brandom says the
[1:19:34] highest of Heaven come to the lowest of
[1:19:37] Earth with the greatest message you know
[1:19:39] what that message was he says Messiah is
[1:19:42] on earth now not coming the scribes and
[1:19:46] the Pharisees were pushing it off into
[1:19:48] the future he's coming he's coming he's
[1:19:51] coming but the Shepherds come saying
[1:19:53] he's here where's he at he's here and as
[1:19:57] long as they follow the Angel's voice
[1:19:59] they would find the
[1:20:01] Messiah yes and you know I've read that
[1:20:04] story many times and I in my mind I
[1:20:07] always thought it was a group of angels
[1:20:09] that come to the Shepherds for some
[1:20:10] reason but you go and read it says the
[1:20:12] angel of the Lord come to the Shepherds
[1:20:15] right oh the same angel that was coming
[1:20:18] to brother Brandon with the message was
[1:20:20] the same angel that come to the
[1:20:22] Shepherds and says hey the messiah's on
[1:20:24] Earth he's on Earth if you will follow
[1:20:26] my instructions you will find him laying
[1:20:29] in the manger in swaddling clothes the
[1:20:32] other ones are missing him but if you're
[1:20:34] humble enough to listen if you're humble
[1:20:37] enough to listen you will find humility
[1:20:40] W wrapped and swaddling clothes and if
[1:20:43] you think about that he revealed himself
[1:20:46] in humility so that he can be wrapped
[1:20:49] once again in
[1:20:50] humility that's just beautiful he
[1:20:53] unveiled himself so that he can come in
[1:20:55] your skins he's not coming to the smart
[1:20:58] and the educated he's coming to the
[1:21:00] humble and it's not it's not that God
[1:21:02] can't reveal himself to the smart he
[1:21:04] can't reveal himself to the Arrogant
[1:21:07] that's who he's bypassing is the
[1:21:09] Arrogant you can be smart and still be
[1:21:11] humble you can have money and still be
[1:21:13] humble but a lot of times the arrogance
[1:21:15] he comes with that but he's bypassing
[1:21:17] the arrogant and coming to the
[1:21:20] humble oh my and I'm humble enough to
[1:21:23] believe that this is thus sayith the
[1:21:25] Lord this is my absolute brother bam
[1:21:29] says notice the highest Heavens
[1:21:31] hastening to honor honor I love that
[1:21:34] honor Earth's most humble and unlearned
[1:21:37] he's going to exalt The Humble think
[1:21:40] about that all the scribes and Pharisees
[1:21:43] were exalted with their knowledge but
[1:21:45] what exalted the Shepherds a message
[1:21:48] what's exalted the bride in this
[1:21:50] generation a message we're both bone of
[1:21:52] his bone flesh of his flesh power of his
[1:21:55] power we have become him once exalted us
[1:21:59] the message we're not trying to work
[1:22:01] something up it's the message that is
[1:22:03] exalting Us in this generation as the
[1:22:06] musicians come in James 1:9 let the
[1:22:09] brother of low degree rejoice in that he
[1:22:12] is
[1:22:13] exalted let him with low degree
[1:22:16] Rejoice because you have been exalted 1
[1:22:20] Peter 5: 6 humble yourself therefore
[1:22:23] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[1:22:25] exalt you in due
[1:22:27] time in due time you might feel pretty
[1:22:30] low but don't worry you're being exalted
[1:22:34] brother Brandon would say you showed me
[1:22:36] a church that's humble real humble not
[1:22:38] arrogant a church just a sweet Humble
[1:22:41] Church I'll show you a church that has
[1:22:44] the favor and power of God in it that's
[1:22:47] right that's the thing it takes humility
[1:22:51] humbling herself before God
[1:22:53] and letting God just work through
[1:22:55] us he said show me a church that's
[1:22:58] humble I'll show you a church that's got
[1:23:00] the super natural oh let us be a church

[1:23:13] got the message of the
[1:23:14] hour that's our claim the fame how might
[1:23:18] not be popular paon e might be in the
[1:23:19] middle of nowhere you might not even
[1:23:21] heard of New Life out reach but the
[1:23:24] message is here and where the message is

[1:23:50] himself and stayed with with what God
[1:23:53] Said in such a way catch this God said
[1:23:56] in such a way that it pleased God to
[1:23:58] take that same Spirit from him and
[1:24:01] promised to shove it three times down
[1:24:02] the road from here amen and he did it he
[1:24:05] sure did Elijah so humbled himself and

[1:28:29] [Music]
[1:28:30] Shepherd he's the
[1:28:33] attraction he's what we're looking at
[1:28:35] today he's our
[1:28:39] influence is that not what Revelations
[1:28:42] 10
[1:28:43] is Revelations 10 is the influence of
[1:28:48] Heaven the influence of an open book
[1:28:52] the influence of divine revelation the
[1:28:55] influence of the
[1:28:57] Lamb is here on the
[1:29:01] earth when you when you see that
[1:29:05] everything else begins to pale
[1:29:07] everything everything else is that right
[1:29:11] and that's why the the prophet said we
[1:29:13] are feeding on the
[1:29:16] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:29:20] we're feeding on that
[1:29:22] there's where there's where we gain our
[1:29:24] strength from oh let us never let us
[1:29:30] never become
[1:29:32] discontent with what God's given us

[1:29:46] what's G God has given us in this
[1:29:48] message lots of pressures out there oh
[1:29:51] but there's another pressure and it's
[1:29:53] pushing us up higher and higher and
[1:29:55] higher in
[1:29:57] Rapture Hallelujah that's what he's
[1:30:00] doing now are we fighting devils and I

[1:30:25] time for deliverance and as he began to
