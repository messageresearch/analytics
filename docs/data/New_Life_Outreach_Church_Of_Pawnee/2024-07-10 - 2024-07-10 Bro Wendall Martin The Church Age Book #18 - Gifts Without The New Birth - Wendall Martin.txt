amen they they the flights messed up and so they they finally got a flight into a uh Atlanta and then they got to the gate they were there early enough to get to the gate and they amen um they' already shut that gate and um they spent the night sitting around that gate uh till 8:00 this morning and uh so um I so if y'all see toothpicks holding their eyelids open you'll know why amen so but we're glad that you guys made it back and then brother brother um that boy over there on the drums uh he he was he was having it uh they he his Li his flight was canceled or or postponed three times and and we're glad to have brother Austin back home too and and um just just good day just good to see everyone back back home amen if you've been missing a while and we just say God bless you let's look here in the scriptures the Hebrews the 6th chapter amen and um we are uh we're going to be reading out of the church age book um we're going to read on 167 page 167 and um we've been we've been dealing with the gifts these last uh few uh uh Wednesday nights and um so we want to uh we're going to continue on that tonight and um but let's let's look here at at Hebrews 6 and four now we've been dealing with what the what it's supposed to be amen the gifts came from God the gifts are ordained of God the gifts belong to the church the gifts are of God Amen got to be operated right but they are 100% of God that's right but the devil can also come in amen and imitate these things and and um so let's look here we're going to talk we're going to deal with that a little bit here tonight here in Hebrews 6 and 4 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy ghost and have tasted of the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame now some people say see you can backslide you can so salvation isn't secure no keep on keep on reading on down for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed and receiveth blessings from God but that which beareth thorns and Briars is rejected and is nigh into cursing whose end is to be burned amen and beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we the speak so so we can see there's two different seeds here receiving the same rain the same Sunshine but bringing two totally different results let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you tonight for your love and your blessings thank you for your your call Upon Our Lives Lord and the Revelation that you have given us in this day to give us a security Lord to give to know where our feet are are planted and father I'm just asking that you would bless us in our readings tonight Lord and just ask that every word that is spoke every scripture that is read everything that we read out of the church age book lord that it would be used of you to to uh Enlighten our hearts and settle our hearts in you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here here this evening I'd like to start out with reading um with with reading this we read this this uh passage um three weeks ago and um but we're going to now go back and deal with some of this I wanted to I wanted to come back and deal with the gifts in the church amen and and how many how many understands that the gifts were in the first church amen they were all in the first church with the book of Acts is is is just amen from the very beginning to the very ending the nine spiritual gifts were in operation Gifts of power anointing was there amen but Satan has can come in because we are Spirit beings amen and and and can infiltrate the church and and and if you're not careful you're not able to you're not able to determine what is God and what isn't God amen and so brother brother brandham is telling the story and we're going to start there at the second paragraph at 16 page 167 it says many years ago when I first came across the Pentecostal people I was in one of their camp meetings where there was much manifestation of tongues and interpretation of tongues and prophecy two preachers in particular were engaged in this kind of speaking more than any of the other Brethren I th enjoyed the services and was truly interested in the various manifestations for they had a ring of reality to them it was my Earnest desire to learn all that I could about these gifts so I decided to talk to the two men about them and through the gift of God resident in me I sought to know the spirit in the first man whether he was truly of God or not after a brief conversation with that sweet humble brother I knew that he was a genuine solid Christian he was real the next young man was not at all like the first one he was boastful and proud and as I spoke to him a vision moved across my eyes and I saw that he was married to a blonde lady but living with a brunette and had two children by her and if ever there was a hypocrite he was one now let me tell you I was shocked how could I not be here were two men one of uh one of which was a real believer and the other was a sinful impersonator yet both were manifesting gifts of the Spirit I was troubled by this confusion and I left the meeting to seek God for the answer I went alone to a secret place and there with my Bible I prayed and waited on God for the answer not knowing just what portion of scripture to read I casually open the Bible to some place in Matthew I read for a while and then laid the the Bible down in a moment a wind blew into the room and turned the pages of the Bible to Hebrews the 6th chapter I read it through and Par and was particularly impressed by those strange verses that we just got through reading for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted of the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they should fall away to renew them again and repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh of upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which beareth thorns and Briars is rejected and is nigh into cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you things that accompany salvation though we thus speak I closed the Bible laid it down meditated on it a while and prayed some more I still had no answer I again open the Bible aimlessly but did not read suddenly the wind blew into the room again and once more the pages turned to Hebrew six and remained there as the wind ceased I read those words over again and when I did then come the spirit of God into the room and I beheld a vision I saw in the vision a man dressed with the purest white who went forth into a freshly plowed field and sold grain it was a bright day and the sewing was done in the morning but late at night after the sewer in the white had gone a man in Black came and steeply sowed some more seed amongst that which the man and white had sown the days went by the Sun and Rain blessed the ground one day there appeared the grain how fine it was but a day later appeared the tears the wheat and tears grew together they partook of the same nourishment out of the same soil they drank in the same sun and Rain then one day the skies turned brass and all the plants and the plants all began to droop and die and I I heard the wheat lift their heads and cry to God for rain the tears also lifted their voices and pleaded for rain then the skies darkened and the rain came and again the wheat now full of strength lifted up their voices and cried in adoration praise the Lord and to my wonderment I heard the revived Terror Terrors also look up and say hallelujah then I knew the truth of the camp meeting and the vision the parable of the sewer and the seed the sixth chapter of Hebrews and the evident manifestation of the spiritual gifts in the mixed audience all became wonderfully clear the s in white was the Lord the swer in Black was the devil the world was the field the seeds were people elect and rebates both partook of the same nourishment water and Sun both prayed both received help from God for he maketh his son and Reign to fall on the good and evil though they both had the same wonderful blessing and both had the same wonderful manifestations there was still one great differ they were of different seed here also was the answer to Matthew 7:21-23 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth my the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not C prophesied in thy name in thy name have cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful works then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity Jesus does not deny that they did the mighty works that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by way of men but he did deny ever knowing them they were not backsliders somebody say they weren't backsliders these were Wicked unre generate rebates these were the seed of Satan right and there it is now he's going to tell us you can't claim the manifestation is the evidence of being Spirit born Spirit field no sir I will admit that the true manifestation is the evidence of the Holy Spirit doing Mighty acts but it is not the evidence of the individual being Spirit-filled even though that individual has an abundance of manifestations can you say Amen now now we want to to look at this for for a few moments here tonight and uh brother Merl had mentioned here a couple of U uh two or three Wednesday nights ago to um it mention the anointed ones at the end time has anyone got to got got to go back and and and listen to that I would encourage um good some of you have uh I went back and listened to it I'd encourage everyone to go back and listen to it and and and when you're listening to these tapes don't don't listen um don't listen to the tapes and and then let your mind wander off if if you can only listen 30 minutes at a time do that but but just but I want you to catch everything that brother brandom is saying because that anointed one at the end time brother Bram is saying the Holy Ghost is saying a lot uh through that prophet and and so um but I want us I want us to to look tonight now now first of all the the gifts of of the the pro uh uh prophets amen and the gifts of Prophecy is not new to the New Testament amen there was Gifts of Prophecy in the Old Testament in fact there were Gifts of healing in the Old Testament there there were the gift of wisdom in the Old Testament everything that was in the New Testament we can go back and find it in the Old Testament amen God does never God never changes his approach if he is a Healer in the New Testament he was a Healer in the Old Testament if he was a prophesier in the New Testament he was a prophesier in the Old Testament amen Gifts of wisdom Gifts of knowledge all of those amen were manifest the only difference is amen is is today you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is within you manifesting himself through you amen amen and so the the the the the word now now there's not there's a difference in a gift of Prophecy and a word Prophet a word born Prophet amen he was he was the special built man amen that that could commune with God and and and hear from God directly he was one that could amen that could go into a total different realm and and and that's how the Bible was wrote through through a word born prophet he was raised for a Divine Purpose he was sent to a specific age to declare that age but also forell amen of things that were we off in the future kingdoms Rose kingdoms by the words of that word Prophet can you say Amen now now prophecies amen the gift of prophecies were amen uh were were men that would would be used and and all throughout the Old Testament uh the the Lord would tell them of of of of of what the enemy was doing the Lord would amen would give them Direction and and and and many of wonderful things through the through the gift of Prophecy and so what I want to deal with here tonight amen I I want first of all I want to establish that that prophecy was used in the Old Testament by ordinary men that were Beyond just just word prophets but yet those prophesied to line their prophecies up with the word prophit that's right they had to line theirselves up with the word of God can you understand what I'm saying so if you were going if you had a gift amen it in the Old Testament it was still required for you to line yourself up with what God was doing through that word prophet and through the scriptures of that day amen can you say Amen now now there're there're in and and I want you to write these down because I got a lot of scriptures here and we're not going to read them all to you tonight cuz I I want to uh I want to get a we're going to do a lot of reading but amen um the Jeremiah 285 through n and y'all write this down I want I want y'all to make sure you go back and look at it amen and and and and the Lord is saying the way that you know that uh that I've spoken is to watch if the prophecy comes to pass you you you you you can you can tell if there is a consistency in in what the Lord does now amen Deuteronomy 13 1-5 it says now if a man prophesies and it comes to pass and he teaches something contrary to what the prophets and the the the word has already said then count that man a false prophet right take him out and kill him Hallelujah that's the way they dealt with their false prophets so so if a man says something and it comes to pass and yet he is teaching contrary to scripture that's in Deuteronomy 13 1:5 amen then then he says then it is then do not follow now now we're fixing a show a repeate with an anointing to be able to see things predict things and still be and and still split hell wide open right amen now you you catch that you don't follow gifted men you follow the word of God there's been a lot of gifted men who were with brother brandham and they used that amen and and they were gifted they were gifted men but they didn't they weren't they weren't accurate on they they missed it they missed it half the time and yet they have they they have they have lured people amen and and told well I was with the prophet and you got to listen to me and and I or it's it's just death or it's going to be doomed that man is a false prophet no man will ever pull any pull anybody to himself he will always point to the word of God Amen and if he doesn't point to the word of God then he's false amen can you say Amen now Deuteronomy 18 20 through 22 it says now it it's dealing with the man that that prophesies and it doesn't come to pass amen and he'll say fear me you got to fear me amen he says if the and he says you are not responsible to follow that man if he says it and it doesn't come to pass mark it off and the Bible says ston him amen so so uh it was it wasn't a good deal to be a false prophet praise the Lord and and so we we we um that's not that that's not the kind of U amen work that we want to be in now again the the the scripture says now what did the scripture says in the last days sister kala if You' put that uh Matthew 24:24 in the last days when he's talking about the perilous times and it's talking about all the signs of the end time he says there's going to be false Christ false prophets which shall show great signs and wonders in so much if it were possible it would deceive the very elect now brother brandham would say now how could they deceive he says it would be an a genuine gift a genuine and somebody that is able Amen to reach up into those other reals and come back and tell you things amen that are that that they gen it's a genuine anointing upon them amen hallelujah if the the if the Old Testament people who were unregenerate how many how many knows that there was no one in the Old Testament filled with the Holy Ghost amen they did not but it was men that that had gifts gifts and callings of God are without repentance amen so so the was these were men that could tap into the supernatural even though they they did not have the Holy Ghost and it is so today that there's going to be men who can tap into that Supernatural and yet split hell wide open amen amen so uh uh there in Romans 11 and 29 again the gifts and callings of God are without repentance that that means you can have a gift and you hav't even you're still a sinner yeah right praise the Lord amen now Matthew 5 and and 45 we we we've just established that you you he makes his he makes his uh uh son to rise on the evil and the good and he sends his Reign on the just and and the unjust amen now now now while we're hitting this here tonight this does not take away from the honeste hearted genuine Sons and Daughters of God who have genuine Gifts of of Prophecy who have genuine manifestations of God Amen and and I I and I I I you know I as I have been thinking about this here I've thought you know in the way that we present it amen sometimes you can present it so hard amen because what we do is as preachers many of times Amen in in the message and I and I've been guilty of that because I came out of a lot of nonsense in Pentecost and so I find myself in those early years especially just I mean I I was I was hammering the gifts and and what I was doing though amen I was taking all of the quotes where brother Brandon was really amen hammering those things and leaving out the quotes where brother Bram was saying they belong in the church and so what we do is our younger generation comes up amen and they don't want they don't know nothing about it they don't want I'm here to tell you tonight we welcome the Holy Ghost and we welcome however he wants to use us amen if if if if the Lord comes upon you all to speak in tongues don't don't don't Hinder that raise your hands and just speak in tongues if the Lord gives you now if the Lord gives you uh if you feel like you have a prophecy well you don't just blurt it out in front of everybody amen you you take that write that down and and and you and and your prophecy needs to be judged that's right well that's the way they taught it in in the Bible days can you say amen amen because what you're doing if you're not careful you're you know you you you get you get you get this one missing and that missing until everyone no no one's believing in the gifts at all and I want to tell you when you see what's going on in the Pentecostal world and how Trump was going to make it in and how this was going to happen and that's going to happen what does that do to people that just that just makes everyone that just makes everyone think that Christianity is a farce and that everyone you know this this just it's just it's not a farce the bride will do nothing until she has thus said the Lord but we don't Squatch the spirit of God that's right we're not going to say we the holy ghost isn't allowed here we want the Holy Ghost to work however he wants to work he's always welcome to work in his church can you say Amen now I I think I wanted to go through this for a little bit here tonight and I want I want you and everyone to turn there but I want you kids to look there too let's go to numbers 11 and 24 and we're going to read that together now the this this setting here um uh Moses has has uh he's just weary he's wore out if you if you read up he's complaining if you read the whole chapter he's complaining to the Lord you know you brought me out here I've got all these people and they're again they're hungry and and and this this is just too big of a load for me you I I'm need I I I I don't know what else to do and he's ask he's actually asking the Lord just let me die just just just just take me amen and and and the Lord tells Moses to gather the people together he says I want you to go choose amen 70 men and I want you to have them to come in and so here's here Moses is obeying the Lord amen and and um he he tells him there in 11 and 16 he says I want you to go and get these 70 men I you to come in and and and um so now Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord and gathered the 70 men of the Elders of the people and set them round about the Temple of the Tabernacle and the Lord came down in a cloud and spake unto them and took of the spirit that was upon Him Moses and gave it unto the 70 elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied and did not cease so so we find amen it wasn't an another Spirit it was the same spirit that was upon that Prophet the that Prophet that was ordained to take them into that land of promise it was not another Spirit but he took of The Same Spirit of the word profet in a small measure and gave it to those 70 men it was the spirit of wisdom and knowledge and prophecy they did they were not word prophets they had to line themselves up with the word prophet of that day you know what God's doing here today amen I I it it is under the umbrella or under the anointing of V 7th Church age anointing amen it's the open book anointing that we receive of are you understanding amen God has come and given us one Prophet somebody say one Prophet one Prophet to to to One Church age there's not two prophets there's one Prophet Amen to a church age then you and I then the anointing comes upon the five-fold ministry amen we are anointed to preach you say well we don't need you amen all we we all we need is Moses no God gave the anointing to those 70 and they came up under not another anointing but the anointing that was upon the prophet is now upon these 70 men to help carry out the work that God ordained am well I I like that amen I like that now and and then and then we'll we find out amen if you were the next the next verse that the spirit fell and some others amen that they didn't show up they didn't show up to the to the Tabernacle like was required of them and there were some others it says and there remained two of the men in the camp the name of the one was was elad and the name of the other midad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written but went not out unto the Tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp and there ran a young man and told Moses and said El dad me dad do prophesy in the camp and Joshua the son of num the servant of of Moses one of the young his young men answered and said my Lord Moses forbid them amen and Moses said unto them envest thou for my sake would God that all uh that that all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them and Moses got him into the camp he and the Elders of Israel so so here here is a here is a time in the scripture where the anoint ing the prophecy amen the spirit of the Lord was upon these men Amen to come and there were some that did not follow the command of Moses that actually the spirit of the Lord Came Upon anyways amen now now Moses would Moos God would speak with Moses am man there in in numbers 12 and6 and and I want you to turn there too if you if you wouldn't mind uh numbers 12 12 and six and tell me when you when you get there Moses is or God is going to say now listen there's some of you that's going to have a gift of Prophecy or have a dream or have a vision but that's not the same as what I've called Moses for amen he says he said are y'all there amen uh numbers is is the U what is it fourth the fourth book of the of the Bible amen right Genesis yeah all right it says um uh hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant Moses is not so who is faithful in all my house with him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently not in dark speeches and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses so so even those Elders amen they had to line themselves up that's right did you know we we read this last week if y'all if y'all remember we read the three we we read three chapters on on on the gifts of the Spirit right amen and we and we and we' done it and at the very last of the chapter amen of that last chapter brother bradam would say you that are spiritual and and and and claim to be a prophet Amen Let Let me just turn there I don't have it here but I I'll get it to you real quick hallelujah amen you love me uh at the end of the I believe it's the 14th mhm yeah now now he has he has just spent the the uh 12th chapter the 11th the 12th 13th and 14th chapter and then he comes down amen all the way to the 37th verse of the 14th chapter If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant so the Apostle Paul is establishing he's establishing these gifts and it's a wonderful thing that he saying now now folks I'm the prophet yeah and you all need to you you need to listen to me here what I'm telling you is is thus saith the Lord in how to deal with with with with with with these gifts so so they had the pro the spiritual people had to line themselves up with the Vindicated voice of the Lord for that generation okay and if you don't have the nature in you to do that I don't care if you speak in tongues I don't care if you prophesy I don't care if your prophecies come true if you reject what God the voice of the Lord for this generation you're a repeate that's hallelujah amen so so we we get a lot of we we get a lot of guys that say well well we just believe it this way well we just believe it that way we better believe it the way the seventh Angels brought it to us that's the way we've got to have it amen I don't want to be considered a repeate I want to I want to follow the will of God I want to teach exactly according to to to what the blueprint says to do it am amen all right so the prophecies amen I'm going to I'm going to give you an illustration here uh and write these write these um um let's see um let's let's go to numbers 23 real quick amen numbers 23 and this is this is balum now balum never missed it balam's prophecies were 100% accurate right all right and yet he brought such a curse on the congregation of Israel until I believe there was 20,000 were killed all at one time amen never missed it but his teaching was wrong and that's that's why that's why it's good you you you young people anything that's preach behind this pull pit you all you all should and if y'all ever have any questions amen always always feel free and I I I I for um you had see you had some kind of a question for me that I I forgot to write it down so you're going to have we'll deal with that next Wednesday night amen and um but but some good questions from these young people we want to give scriptural answers and if there's not a scriptural answer then you need to be asking why why do you teach it if there's not a scriptural answer how many believe that that's all right it don't matter if I'm a good singer it don't matter if I'm an anointed preacher it don't matter if if uh I don't I don't have the gift of Prophecy amen but as a pastor the I I do have discernment amen and and the Lord shows me things in the congregation sometimes before it even happens gives amen but that does not make me that does not that that does not make me amen a Son of God come on there's only one thing that I can rest my Soul upon and that is my soul that is that is that is standing upon the Vindicated word of the hour amen amen now so 23 let's just read a couple of the prophecies first of all balum how how many have y'all heard have y'all already dealt with balum in Sunday school y'all know who balum is okay well balam BAC the king did not want he was he seen Israel and what he had what they were swallowing up the land they were coming over and and and so baac uh that the blessings of the Lord was upon was upon Israel so baac the king went and hired balum the prophet now balum says I can't do nothing unless the Lord shows me so he comes up he he sends Messengers with with gold and silver and they all come come they all come up Amen to his home and say listen if you come and prophesy for baac the king he will give you silver and gold and and uh I believe it was gold I know there was silver involved but lot lots of riches I want you want you to come bayac says I can't do that amen the Lord's I I've got to pray and ask the Lord he asked the Lord and God says no so he goes back and he says can't do it guys and then the king comes back to it and says hey amen I'm telling you I will exalt you and I will make you an honorable man I have the ability to do that come and come and and curse Israel so he goes and asks the Lord amen and and finally the Lord says okay go amen just just go ahead and go and U um matter of fact let's just let's just read it real quick even if I don't get my other stuff all to it tonight let's let's look here in Numbers 22 if you kids haven't read that 22 and um and one and the children of Israel Set uh forward and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side of Jordan by Jericho and baac the son of zapor saw all that Israel had done to the amorites Moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and Moab was distressed because the children of Israel and Moab said unto the Elders of Midian now this now shall this company lick up all that are around about us as the ox lith up the grass of the field and baac the son of zapor was the king of the moabites at that time and he sent Messengers therefore unto balum the son of bore to uh pathor which is which is by the river of the land of the of the children of of his people and to call him saying behold there is a people come out from Egypt behold they cover the face of the Earth and they abide over against me come now therefore I pray thee and curse me this people for they are too Mighty for me per Adventure I shall Prevail that we may Smite them that I may drive them out of the land for I want that he whom thou bless uh bless us is blessed and whom thou curs us is cursed and the Elders of Moab and the Elders of Midian departed from with the rewards of Divination in their hand and came unto balam and spake unto him the words of baac and he and he said unto them Lodge here this night I will bring you word again as the Lord shall speak unto me and the princes of the Moab Abode with balum and God came unto balum and said what men are these with thee balb sent unto God baac the son of zapor the king of Moab had sent unto me saying behold there is a people come out of Egypt which coverthe now and curse me then per Adventure I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out and God said unto balum Thou shalt not go with them Thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed and balam Rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of BAC get you into your land for the Lord refuses to give me leave to go with you and the princes of Moab rose up and they went unto baac and balum refused to come with us and said baala refused to come with us and baac sent yet again princes more and more honorable than they and they came to balum and said to him thus saith baac the son of zapor let nothing I pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me for I will promote thee uh unto very great honor I will do whatsoever thou saith unto me come therefore I pray thee and curse me this people and balam answered and said unto the Servants of balac if baac would give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more now therefore I pray you Terry ye also here this night that I may know what the Lord will say unto me more and God said unto balb at night he said unto him if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which I shall say unto thee and thou shalt do now was was balam right was balum right to ask the Lord again if the Lord has already told him no you should always leave it alone but because of the prestige and the continual pushing did you know brother brandham they constantly was trying to push brother brandham and manipulate him one way or another to fit their circles but I'm sure glad he was a god-sent prophet he stood there with a backbone and said no I ain't going with you and I don't care about your honor I don't care about your right amen these guys wanted brother brandham now watch balam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of Moab and the Lord Lord's anger was kindled because he went now you say why would the Lord be mad he told him to go because it was in his evil heart to go that's right and if our heart is resisting the word of the Lord in any area of our life we want to stop right then and say God please take this out of my soul I don't want anything that is not agreeable to your word amen don't want anything that's not agreeable to your word so so God's anger was kindled because he went amen now you kids listening and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass that's his donkey and his two servants were with him and the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way now watch this the donkey sees the angel of the Lord and balam doesn't seem him at all now watch Saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balum smoked the ass to turn her into the way and the angel of the Lord stood in the path of The Vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that side and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed alam's foot against the wall and he smote her again and the angel of the Lord went further and stood in a narrow place and there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord she fell down under balum and balam's anger was kindled he smoked the ass with a staff and the Lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto Balon now here's the donkey talking to it what have I done done unto thee that thou H has smitten me these three times and balum started talking to the donkey and balum said unto the ass because thou has mocked me I would there was a sword in my hand for I would kill thee and the ass said unto balam am not I thine ass upon which thou Hast written ever since I was thine unto this day was I ever want to do so unto thee he said nay and then the Lord opened the eyes of balum and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and F fell flat on his face and the angel of the Lord said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold I went out to withstand thee because thy way is perverse before me and the ass saw me and turned from me these three times unless she had turned from me surely now also I would have slain thee and saved her alive and balb said unto the angel of the Lord I have sinned for I knew not that thou stood Us in the way against me now therefore if it displease Thee I will get me back again and the angel of the Lord said unto bam go with the in but but only the word I shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak so balum went with the princess of baac not that quite a story I now now now you say well the Lord is telling them to go because he should have stopped and said no you're you you I am not going one step further if you were fixing to split my hair with your sword I'm not going any further I'm going to get back in the will of the Lord but it's not in his heart to get back in the will of the Lord that's right you say well the Lord should have told him to go back no his he's going to do his heart's desire and I want to say this here today we don't want to have that kind of a heart that is constantly pushing against God that's right we don't want God giving us our heart's desire when it's not upon his word that's now if you were to read and you can do this in your devotional times but he gives the prophecy numbers 237 to2 he is that's numbers 237 to12 he comes and prophesies a blessing on Israel so then the king says King BAC says hey okay I'll take you another place so so they kill the the the the they have the seven sacrifices and they offer them all up and they're doing everything amen numbers 2318 to 24 he gets up to prophesy and what does he say he says my eyes are my my eyes are open and a vision has come across and he starts telling what he sees and and he's and it's right there it's it's you you got to read it amen then he goes and takes him to another place numbers um let numbers uh 24 let's see uh yeah 24 4-9 and when he gets up there he he prophesies blessings again so then he goes amen uh there in the 245 to to 25 and it's nothing but blessings and I want to tell you he prophesied of Jesus coming he prophesied I mean balam prophesied of things that were going to happen thousands of years and he was false praise the Lord when balum could not get God to curse and and again read the story finally the the the the Bible says that balum taught them the Israel to commit met fornication and taught him to intermingle amen their their seed was some you know the wind it just it it just brought it there amen and the scripture says there in in Deuteronomy uh uh thir not uh numbers 31 and6 if you wouldn't mind putting that up such Keys 31 and 16 of numbers that the council behold these caused the children of Israel through the Council of balum to commit trespass against the Lord uh in the matter of pure and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord here this man was used to prophesy and his prophecies were genuine but his teaching did not teach the people to follow the Lord amen y'all understand that praise the Lord and then he's talked about there in Peter he's talked about in Jude I've wrote this I brought this one in Jude 1 And1 woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and reain greedily uh ran greedily after the error of balum for reward and perished in the gang saying of cor amen all right let's look at let let's look at at at at another at another one that um how many's understanding so far amen so do we understand that that you can can you can prophesy but that does not mean you are you Holy Ghost filled amen we want to do things oh church it's so important that we follow after God with all of our heart follow after God I'm a singer and sometimes we can get anointed that we can get and you say well I'm a singer and God anoints me and God blesses me would would you would you base your your walk with God and your salvation upon you being able to move a crowd with your voice and still go out there and live contrary to the word what what what good would that be what good would that be to be a singer and then end up in hell that's right what good would it be to be a be a preacher or be a musician or to be a a deacon or or or or whatever and yet and yet and depend on your special gift and not really pay attention to your heart and the willingness to obey God go ahe that's now I'm going to fixing to give you another example here now I'm not going to give all the examples that brother brandham gave they in the anointed ones at the end time but he brother brandham I'm not even going to try toeach his sermon y'all y'all y'all go back and listen to him because it is is it's an incredible deal but I'm going to show you how that the anointing Came Upon King Saul and when the anointing when when Saul uh when he was anointed by Samuel to be king amen the scripture says that that he became a different man with that with that anointing to be king and the Bible says that he began to prophesy with the prophets amen there there in there in Samuel Samuel the 10th chapter praise the Lord then Samuel at the first verse then Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be Captain over his inheritance whence Thou Art departed from uh for me today then Thou shalt find two men by Rachel sepon now this is the prophet Samuel that is letting him know that God is with him and so he's going to he's going to tell him things is fixing to happen as he's on his way home he's just he's just told him that his that his donkeys have been found they are now safe they're they're they're back at h house and then he's telling him as you're going home you're going to run into this this this this this so now he's telling says when thou are departed from me today then Thou shalt find two men by Rachel seeper in the border of Benjamin and and zelza and they will say unto thee the asses which thou Wiest to to seek are found and lo thy father hath left the care uh of the asses and and sorth for you saying what shall I do for my son then shalt thou go on forward from then and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor and and there shall meet thee three men going up to to God to bethl one carrying three kids another carrying three loaves another carrying a bottle of wine I want to tell you doesn't that doesn't that just sort of make you think of our Prophet how how how right precise that was now watch he says uh it says and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread Thou shalt receive of their hands and after that thou shalt come to the hill of God and there is a Garrison of the Philistines and um and and it shall come to pass when thou art come to this C th to the city Thou shalt meet a company of prophets and coming down from the high place with a sultry and a Tabet and a pipe and a heart before them and they shall prophesy and the spirit of the Lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man and and let it be when these signs are come to unto thee that thou do as occasion serve thee for the Lord is with thee and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal behold I will I I I will come down unto thee to to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifice of people peace offerings seven days Thou shalt T till I come to thee and and show thee what Thou shalt do and it was so that when he had turned his way back from to go from Samuel that God gave him another heart and all those signs come to pass that day and when they had came thither to the hill Behold a company of prophets met him and the spirit of God come upon him and he prophesied among him and it come to pass when all knew him beforehand Before Time saw that behold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one to another what is this that is that has come unto the son of Kish is Saul also among the prophets one of the same place answered and said uh but who is their father and therefore it become a proverb is is Saul also among the prophets and when he had made an end to prophesying he came to the high place amen so so God's anointing is on him right now how many how many can say that I mean if you if you had a prophet to tell you that you're going to meet this and this and this and this and this and this and it all happens you say oh my goodness okay all right I'm God's man God's anointing me right anointed but Saul's heart was not perfect before God that's right right now I'm giving you the illustr I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm not going to hold you too much longer but I'm giving you the reason why one man could prophesy and he was a genuine Christian and this other man can prophesy and things happen genuinely by the Holy Ghost and that man was living with another woman that was not his wife and was fathering another child is because it was an anointing but they were depending upon an anointing instead of their hearts being right with God I would rather I would rather this congregation never have another gift never have a gift of the spirit never have anything and be right with God and walk with God than to have a church full of gifts with no one's desire to serve God that's right amen amen now so now we we're going to fast forward here to Psalms 19 and and we're going to read at the 20th verse now we're finding that David Saul has been rejected Saul is is now jealous of David he's chasing and he's trying to kill David he's trying to kill David and and so we sending Messengers out and they're amen and so we're just breaking in here now uh the 19th Chapter 1st Samuel 19 and 20 and Saul sent Messengers to David and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying Samuel standing as appointed over them now here's again here's some people prophesying but D Samuel over them the spirit of God was upon the Messengers of Saul and they also prophesied and it was cold to Saul and he sent another he sent other Messengers and they prophesied likewise and Saul sent Messengers again the third time and they prophesied also then went he Saul also to Rama and came to a great well that is SEC seu however you pronounce it he and he asked and said where are Samuel and David one said behold they be at at nth at Rama and and they went thither to Nath to in Rama and the spirit of God was upon Him Saul also and he went on and prophesied until he come to Nao in ra Rama and he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before Samuel in like Manner and laid down naked all day and all that night wherefore they say is Saul also among the prophets see genuine gifts prophesying with the prophets but a heart that was not perfect before God so what we want does that do away with the good prophets does that do away with the pro the gift of Prophecy no but we want those gifts in operation the way God wants him in operation we want the Holy Spirit to be satisfied with us so so now I'm just I I think I'm just going to I'm I'm going to uh end right there amen and now again while I'm here um and and while it's been said and you know uh the prophecy that Kenneth Hagen and it's all over the Internet and things you know but it it that he gave Kenneth Hagen toward brother brandham it says now at the end of 65 he who now stands in the Forefront of The Healing Ministry as a prophet will be taken out of the way he will make a false step Satan shall destroy his life and but his spirit will be saved and his Works will follow him air 66 shall come and he shall be gone now they're they're CLA now first of all I want to say this did not come out in the open until after brother Brandon was gone so we can question that right we can question that anyone can make things up but they now this was Kenneth Hagen the founder of the the the faith the word of faith you know there in they're in Broken Arrow okay all right so you're looking and you're thinking hm now good man wonderful man wonderful Prophet but now now now he is but God's going to take him away and um and and um he he would he would go on and add that um uh he he would add he said the Lord the Lord explained to me I had to permit him to be removed because of the damage he was causing in the body of Christ hm okay so what are we going to do we've got we've got a prophet versus a prophet right now we accept him as a word Prophet they don't so now we've got a prophet versus a prophet what are we going to do take it back to scripture okay all right I will let's let's just okay yes God's going to take him off the scam because he's doing great [Music] damage show it by scripture that's right are you saying brother Wendell that he didn't see that Vision no he saw that Vision I believe the Lord allowed him to see brother brandham passing on brother brandham knew he was going to pass on I believe brother Brandon was was even knowing at at at that point but but his interpretation is not scriptural that's right so he's adding to and putting things in and it and you you miss it in one way you miss the whole thing so you can't L are you understanding so they so they base this whole thing that God showed him that that great prophet was going to what okay wonderful but did God tell you all of that God will never go against his word that's right now let's talk about Kenneth Hagen shall we amen the angel of the Lord come and S at his bed now when when he would come and appeared to brother Branham brother brandham would he would fall as a dead man did is that not is that not the way scripture reads in when when the angel of the Lord would appear to to one of those Old Testament prophets it was like but this one that would appear to brother Kenneth Hagen amen I'm not going to be too mean I was going to extract the word brother he would come and sit on the bed beside him and they'd talk about things and they would just talk back and forth that's when the angel of the lord gave brother brother Kenneth Hagen the revelation of the hair for the woman that it was a cap well I don't know why his wife and children don't wear caps and uh where where you know something over their head but the a but it's it's all it's all there go look it up for Kenneth Hagen amen and the woman question he'll tell you how the Lord just gave just settled that whole thing okay okay okay is it [Music] scripture he a false prophet amen yet some of his prophecies have come to pass but it's false he's leading people contrary to the word amen god-given gift in a reprobate heart that has led thousands and thousands away from the scripture see what I'm saying so you hit it so you was able to hit it the brother random was going to pass away good for you do I make sense you try you go back and look there at the genuine prophet of God Amen now then of course Gordon Lindsay you know Gordon Lindsay jumps in yeah how many knows who Gordon Lindsay is you know amen Gordon Lindsay um just just jumps in and it's two days later after after brother brand pway brother Lindsay called me up and said brother Hagen the the brother you referred to just died I got I I I I got all out that prophecy the lord gave us 18 months ago and read it and it's right on brother Lindsay related an experience he had had with that prophet and brother Lindsay said I told him you're not a teacher so don't try to teach this is brother Hagen's words he says he was he he he was a preacher and a good one at that and he had marvelous manifestations of the holy spirit in his ministry brother Lindsay said I begged him not to teach I said you don't know the Bible you're confusing folks leave the Bible teaching to the teachers and just go ahead and preach and exercise the word of knowledge and Gifts of healing as the spirit wills and and be a blessing to the body of Christ this Prophet said to brother Lindsay I know I'm not a teacher but I want to teach and I'm going to teach see not even not even you you even these kids know better than that but brother Brenham did say many of times in front of all the theologians now I know I'm not a teacher you guys are the theologians but uh uh but I've got something on my heart I and I want to tell you what he said there in just a few moments would just blow those guys away yes sir he he had a gift the angel of the lord gave him direct knowledge he didn't get it from a seminary he got it from the he was a prophet to restore us back to the word those rebellious leoan Preachers did not want to go back to the word that's right that's right Kenneth Hagen you should have came in life Gordon Lindsay you should have brought your gift in line TL osbor you should have brought your gift in line with the voice of the day amen and you would have had your reward but you didn't you brought your own following instead of pointing them are you understanding now the 70 were given the gifts but it was the gift that was upon the prophet Moses and be and that was distributed out and they were not stewards of that gift bottom line is if you're a sticker If you're a thorn bush you'll never give wheat right and if you're a wheat you ain't going to Bear Thorns right H can you say amen amen how many's glad for God's desire in your heart to be right now brother if you've got a desire to be right don't let nothing get I I I know how it is I that's why we that's why that's that's why brother brandham says it is possible to backslide you can backslide you can get your heart so muddled up and so hardened by this lay osia that you allow things in your lives you allow things in your heart Saints don't do that if you've got a heart that is screaming to be right with God get right with God be right with God can you say amen I don't care if you're the finest of preachers the finest of singers the finest of whatever you've got to be right with God amen
