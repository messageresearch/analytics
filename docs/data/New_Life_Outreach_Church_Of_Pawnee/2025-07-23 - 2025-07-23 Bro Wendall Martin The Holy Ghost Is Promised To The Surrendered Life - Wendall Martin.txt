And um it sure is good to be here tonight and uh to sing the songs of of praise to the Lord. And truly, he has been good to us. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's look here in the book of Ephesians, the 2 chapter. And uh good to see everyone out tonight. Praise the Lord. Um God is God is so good to his people. And um I think it's already been said, but sure is good to see dad tonight. And and uh always always uh good to see him, he when he's feeling up to it. And um I think I just need a little bit of volume. Amen. I've got it up pretty high. Amen. Um but uh so we're uh we're just really glad to see to see everyone um here. I um I was looking there and seen Lizzy with us and so good to have you again tonight. God bless you. and uh just really really been nice to have Bosow and Lizzy and and uh we've known each other for a long time. So we just say God bless you. Uh Ephesians 2 and and one you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air. the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But God who is rich in mercy. Someone say, "God who is rich in mercy." For his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ. By grace ye are saved, and hath raised us up together, and made us to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come, he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we just want to thank you today for for your love and Lord what it means to to know you and to serve you. I I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would would just come real special among us Lord because that is the reason we come Lord is is to Lord be in your presence and to hear your words but Lord not just be in your presence and hear your words but for you to speak directly to us and and and and anoint our hearts to understand. Father, we're just asking that you would do that. And Lord, we just look to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And amen. Praise the Lord. Uh if we could I don't know maybe if we had a little bit of highs on this or something. It just feels like it's it's real um got too much lows or something. Amen. appreciate these guys uh uh working on get getting this new system all all up and going. And uh Josh has been working on my deal all night. My and uh Josh has been working on my deal all night. My uh my my earpiece, it wasn't working. So, brother Caleb is and it's on on this kind of a mic. It just once it's just hard to get them set up and uh so we appreciate your patience with us as we're getting it. But tonight I want to speak on on this um uh on a on a subject of the promise of the Holy Ghost to the surrendered life. So we've been preaching a lot on surrender and what it means to surrender. Um but the the uh Holy Spirit, we're surrendering our lives for a reason, not to become a not not just become a religious person, &gt;&gt; but we're surrendering our lives so that the Holy Spirit can move on the inside of us. So, amen. There there is so the Christian walk is is is is uh com comprised of of three elements. Amen. The surrender and that's when the just we're justified. It's when God looks down upon us. Amen. And it's like uh it's it's it's it's like you have uh uh I don't know if you were to find uh your your precious glass that that you've always or your cup that you've always drunk coffee out of and you've lost it and u and then you find it. One of the kids have taken it out and they've been uh out there in the in in the chicken coupe with it and they've been uh it's all in the barnyard and it's it's got it is just absolutely nasty. Amen. And so in order to redeem that cup, you have got to go. Amen. And you have got to you've got to pick it up. Amen. That's justification. That's when God comes to you and and searching for you and and and he finds the you find the cup. Amen. But now you're you're not going to put no coffee in that. You're you're not going to drink out of that. Amen. You cannot use it for its intended purpose because it is it is full of chicken manure and it's full of barnyard stuff and Amen. So what you do, Amen. you pick it up and you take it into your house into your sink and you start washing it. That is sanctification. That's when that's that's when you you start putting detergent on it and cleaning it all up and and making sure that it is all sanitary. But still, that is not the finished product. That is not what Amen. You you you you didn't just do it to go set it up uh uh uh uh to look at it, but it was created for you to drink coffee out of. It was created for you to use. So the third process, amen, is for you to take that cup, fill it up with the goodness, Amen, and and drink out of it. So God in his mind, his purpose for saving you is to redeem you. He had to look throughout all of the barnyard. And God looked down and found that that individual that he knew before the foundation of the world that he loved before the foundation of the world. Amen. And he he chose you. He picked you up. He brings you into the church. And he Amen. He begins to clean you up. And you used to be a maybe a womanizer or maybe you was a harlot or maybe you were uh uh amen alcoholic or a drug addict. But God begins to clean you up. Amen. And wash you and by his blood and the word that is being preached. I want to tell you there's something about the gospel. Every time you come to church and the gospel is being preached, you there is a amen. There is a cleansing agent. The Bible says that we are washed with the washing of the water by the word of God. Amen. And we're washed by his word. What is God doing? He is washing you, cleaning you up, restoring you back to what you were created for in the beginning. Well, glory to God. His desire is to fill you up. His desire is to his glory to come on the inside of you. Amen. and and and and live in you and live his life through you, manifest himself through you. That's what his desire is all about. Amen. He wants to live in you. &gt;&gt; Now, if you if you noticed here in this scripture that we have that that we've just read, he he he says we we in time past walked according to the course of this world. Amen. according to the prince of the power of there the spirit that now works inside amen the children of disobedience. He says we also had our conversation our lifestyle in the same amen. We were we were once uh uh uh we we were once children of the devil if if you want to put it that way. But then it was God who was rich in mercy because God knew that he had lost a cup and he was looking for that cup and he was going to find that cup. And when he does find that cup, he's going to pull that cup. Amen. And bring it back into where? Into his house. Well, glory to God. Amen. That's right. So, I want to speak on the Holy Ghost. And Amen. And and it it spirits, evil spirits and good spirits both have got to have a a body to work through. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So there there are How many believes in demon possession? &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen. There's demon possession there where devils enter into to a man. We've seen it all throughout the the the the New Testament. The maniac that was out there. Amen. and he was filled with w with with a legion of devils and and and it and it and it caused him to act ways. Threw him in the fire. It it caused him to leave his family. It was living among the tombs. Amen. But you see, there's got to be Amen. God is a spirit. Amen. And he's a Holy Spirit. That's what God is. He is the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit has got to have a body to live in. That's what God created Adam for is so that he would have a body to live in. Amen. And that he could uh uh uh work his work here on the earth. But now Satan, the devil, the spirits, demons are are evil spirits. But when we come to Christ there in Colossians 1:13, it says, "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son." I like the way the amplified version says it. It says, "For he has rescued us and drawn us to himself from the dominion of darkness and has transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved son. Hallelujah. We're &gt;&gt; now it is God working through us. &gt;&gt; He's rescued us. He brought us. God create God never did create you to be a sinner. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, the devil never did on you. God's always had you. You were born in a chicken pin just like the ju just just like the uh uh the little eaglet. Amen. You know, the as the farmer was was missing an egg for a second and and and he goes out and he finds this this eagle egg and he and he and he puts it in there with the other eggs and the and and the the hen is there and and and sitting on the eggs and and hatched the eggs. Amen. And and and the little eaglet hatched right along with the wi with all the chickens. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and wherever mama went, all of those little chicks went with them. at wherever mama went. And so did that little eaglet. That little eaglet was just following around wherever mama went all through the barnyard. But you see, it was never a chicken. It was always an eagle. &gt;&gt; We were born in sin. But God, Bible says that your name was put on the lamb's book of life when &gt;&gt; not when you come and gave your heart to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not when you decided to serve the Lord. The Bible says that if you're saved, if you ever make it to heaven, your name was put on God's book before the world ever began. &gt;&gt; Well, pray. You mean you mean I was always a child of God, even while I was out there sinning? Yes, you were. &gt;&gt; You were always a son of God. You were always a daughter of God. You just didn't know who you were. Well, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But one day, mama knew that she had two eggs. Mama knew she had two eggs and one of them had missing and mama was still looking around. And one day as she come, Amen. And she looked down and she saw that little eagllet in that chicken pin. Amen. Scratching scratching on the ground like all of the other chickens were. And she let out a great big scream. And when she let out that scream, that little eiglet, Amen. It it it it recognized, wait a minute, there is a call. Amen. As the scripture would say, a deep calling unto the deep. Amen. And that little that little eaglet looked up and and could you imagine that little eagllet sing this great majestic bird, his mama. Amen. That was that was flying around above that that barnyard. Now, those other chickens did not have any inkling of what was going on. Amen. They didn't care about that scream, but there was something about that little eiglet. It was an eagllet at heart. &gt;&gt; It always was an eagle. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And mama began to scream and before you know it, that little chicken got or that little eagle got discontent and says, "I don't belong in this barnyard. I am not a chicken. I am I I I don't like this kind of food. I belong up in the heavenlies just like my mother. And he come to his senses and he begin to flap those wings. Amen. And maybe he went up to the to to the fence post. Amen. And mama kept on a screaming and and maybe he went on up to the to the pinnacle of the barn and mama just kept on a screaming. And finally he got the courage and just kept on a flying and he joined mama up in the skies where he belonged. Now, he never did belong in that chicken pin, &gt;&gt; but he was he was still hatched there. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You never did belong a sinner. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yet, you had your marriages messed up. Yet, you've had this and you've had that. Some in and out of jail. You've you've gone through this. You've fall with addictions. You've gone through Amen. Maybe it was a religious spirit in you. You were you you were a Catholic or a Pentecostal. Amen. All of your life or what. But finally there come a reality. I need a living God. How many needs a living God? &gt;&gt; There came something in your heart. I need something that's real. I was created for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes, you were created for a purpose. It was God's purpose. &gt;&gt; God put you here on the earth for a specific purpose. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's where man God's created our hearts &gt;&gt; to hunger for God. Amen. The prophet would say David had said, "My soul longs for you like in a dry land where there's no water." Now God created man to have a thirst. It's your makeup. You were made to thirst. God made you that way. You can't help it if because you thirst. God made you to do it. But God made you to thirst after him. That thirst was put in you. Not to go to the devil's places, not to thirst after Hollywood or the fashions of the world, but that thirst was given to you to thirst after God. And I want you young people to understand that. Lots of lots of things out there to try to to pull you this way and that way. There going to be a lot of pretty girls, a lot of handsome guys, going to be a lot of Amen. a lot of things to try to attract your attention. But I want to say, remember, God created you with a divine purpose. &gt;&gt; And Satan knows that. Satan knows that. And he'll begin to try to attract you to thirst after him and to fill your thirst. But I want to tell you, there is nothing that can that can quench your thirst like the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If you were an eagle to begin with, there's nothing in the barnyard that can satisfy you. &gt;&gt; Well, come on. If you were a a son of God, well, oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's not no one could be my son except through through the through a a natural lineage or unless there was an adoption. Amen. There has to be something that is that is within within the nature of the father. It's never been the request of the of the sons, &gt;&gt; right? You weren't requesting to be your your dad's daughter. You didn't request to be your dad's daughter. Amen. It was your dad that took that on himself. Well, praise the name of the Lord. I didn't request to become a Christian. I didn't beg God to become Amen. to make me something. God loved me before I could ever love him. And he put my name in his book. Right. &gt;&gt; God chose me. Well, glory to God. And I want to tell you, you're not like one of those guys. I used to hate it when I was when when I was a kid, man. And we'd all, you know, we'd be collecting teams together for for for basketball or football or Hallelujah. And and they'd have the two captains, right? We still do that today. The two captains. And I was always the very last one. Hallelujah. And that didn't make me feel too proud. feel too good because I just not athletic. Hallelujah. And uh uh I I I I be there trying to look good and big and all that and and and they just would not pick me. I was the run. Amen. And I couldn't play ball if I wanted to. Hallelujah. Now, I could play a p or a guitar, but I sure couldn't play nothing else. And and but but you see, God's not here saying, "Hey, you know, you're having to say, "God, pick me. Pick me. Pick me." God loved you. Right? &gt;&gt; And there's no favorites in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; God so loved you that he gave himself for you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God's got a very special purpose. Amen. In in saving you today. &gt;&gt; Now, I I want us to keep that in mind that thirsting. You were born with a thirst. But you see, you were born in a fallen nature. And in this fallen nature, amen, you tried to quench that thirst through other things. The devil will get you to try to uh quench that thirst with pornography. He'll try to get you to quench that thirst through um a religion. He'll try to get you to quit quench your thirst through so many other things. But the reality is God gave us the thirst &gt;&gt; for more of him. &gt;&gt; To be like him. Can you say amen? Are you understanding? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So God made you to to desire to be like that. Amen. God did that because he wants to fill you up with his goodness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when you were born, I want to say this again. When you were born, you were created with a place in you to be filled by God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now, now Satan uh uh uh finds and tries to inhabit that man. And he and and and and even brother Brandon would talk about even in in church service, he says, "And when the meeting's going on, an evil spirit in the meeting," he said, "that spirit is almost harmless until it can catch somebody that it can work through. &gt;&gt; Then when it can work, uh then when it can work through, it'll certainly do damage because it's an evil spirit." And the Holy Spirit is here right now, right now. trying to find somebody to work through. And when it finds somebody to work through, it can do good. See the two spirits and their motives and objectives. Watch how it is. Watch their works. Watch their fruits. Then you can see what spirit is on you. You are motivated by spirit. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now you I I want us to as I begin to think about the surrendered life and the receiving of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Now I I want us to to before Amen. Uh uh he or she can ever receive the Holy Ghost, you've got to die &gt;&gt; to yourself. &gt;&gt; Now, how many knows what dying to yourself is? That that that doesn't mean go put a gun to your head. &gt;&gt; No, you've got to when I say when the Bible talks about dying to yourself, Amen. This means a surrender. This means giving everything that you think. Give it up and surrender it to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that that means well I've got a really good idea. But if it's not what God's idea is, then we've got to surren that is dying to ourself. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Man wants to do things in the in their own way. But we've got to die. The Apostle Paul says, "I die daily." You've got to die to your old nature. Amen. You've got a sinful nature. You were born with that sinful nature. But when the when God comes, Amen. and begins to start working on you. It requires a surrendered life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, with the cup that came out, it's already been picked up. It's brought in. Amen. To the sink. And I'm just going to put every one of you in the sink. Amen. Now, you're either going to allow God to clean you, make you, Amen. You're going to surrender to the Lord's word and let him scrub sin out of your life. And I want to tell you, there ain't nobody can do it any better than Jesus. &gt;&gt; There ain't nobody can do it any better than Jesus. Well, praise the Lord. I I go back to Sister Stephanie there. All those years as a heroin addict and all of those many times that she went through all of those 12step programs and all all of that money that was spent, all of that time. Amen. She went time after time after time. But when she came and surrendered her life to Jesus Christ, Jesus started cleaning her up. And I want to tell you, she's here tonight. Amen. A beautiful Christian. What God has done for her, what what done the difference. There's only one that can clean you up, and that's through the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He cleans you up. Well, praise the Lord. You can go through the 12step program for an alcoholic all you want. Amen. But they don't even claim to you. Listen, when you go to those programs for for for for alcoholism, you know, you have every time you have to you when when you report for duty. Amen. You you all sit around in a circle and you all talk and I and if I were to go there, I would say this is the way it starts out. Hi, I'm Wendhol. I'm an alcoholic. &gt;&gt; Why? They want you to admit that you've got an alcohol problem. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and and they'll everyone there is not a program out there that'll tell you that you can be cured at. They teach you how to deal with alcoholism. They teach you how to deal with drug problem. But you see, God doesn't teach you how to deal with the devil. God comes in to set you free from the devil. &gt;&gt; He comes in to set you free from alcoholism. Oh, can you say amen? And the Bible says when whom Jesus sets free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; You're free. But it requires someone that is willing to admit that I don't have it going on. I don't have the world by the tail. I need Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. You you you young people say, "Well, Amen. I've never been a sinner." Paul, you were born a sinner. &gt;&gt; Every one of you kids were born sinners, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why when when you even though you you you you're raised in a Christian home, you're raised in a Christian home, but yet Amen. you fight with desires, you fight with things lying, you fight with obedience, you fight with uh uh uh loving your your your your brother or your sister. It's in your nature. Sin is in your nature. &gt;&gt; Right. But I'm so glad that God picks us up and God begins to wash us with his word. &gt;&gt; He be Oh, hallelujah. Amen. But the but the awesome thing is is the Holy Spirit will come back on you and he wants to live his life through every one of you. So coming to Jesus and sitting in church is not the end of the story. We must be we must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you just love it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you see, if you don't receive the Holy Ghost, then Amen. Let's just look here real quickly and and and I it's Matthew 12 and 43. And let's just turn there because I I want I want us all to see it. And um praise the Lord. Matthew 12 and 43. Well, glory to God. Okay. So, so now we're talking about when God drives the spirits out, he's cleaning us up. &gt;&gt; He has favored us. And now he's cleaning us. Now, watch watch what watch what Jesus this is Jesus' own words. He says, "When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places seeking rest, finding none." Now, now, in other words, that devil that God has delivered you from is looking for a body that he can make havoc of. &gt;&gt; He can't make you do heroin anymore. So, he's got to find somebody. &gt;&gt; He's got to have a purpose. And it's destruction. &gt;&gt; He can't He can't make you lie anymore. So, he's got to find a body. The devil is powerless without a body. &gt;&gt; Got to have a body to work through. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, watch. Then he says, "I will return unto into my house from whence I came out." And when he comes, he finds it empty and swept and garnished. So that devil that was that was driven out, he finds God does such a good job. He's cleaned it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's empty. It's swept and it's just squeaky clean. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, this is an individual that the Holy Spirit has done a work in. All right. &gt;&gt; Now watch watch the next verse. &gt;&gt; And then then he goes then goeth he and takes with him seven more spirits, seven other spirits more wicked than himself. And they enter in and dwell there. And the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. So Jesus is saying God can do a work in someone's life. Drive the devils out. &gt;&gt; Drive it all out. But if you if the Holy Spirit does not come in you, Jesus in another place says you there's got to be the strong man of the house. The strong man moves into that house and then the devil can't do anything to that individual. Who is the strong man? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's God himself living in you. &gt;&gt; Well, am I making sense? &gt;&gt; You see, so we don't want we don't want to just be cleaned. We don't want God to do and so many times I've seen it many many many times. God do such great things for an individual and because they get satisfied with where they are, Satan can come right back into that person and usually that person when they go out, they're they're they're many times worse than what they were at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Why? It wasn't because they were bad people. It was because they did not go on to receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Somebody say justification. justification, &gt;&gt; sanctification, &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; see many think that you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe. &gt;&gt; That's not the case. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to read there in in let's look there in the book of uh Acts the 19th chapter, Acts 19 and one. Praise the Lord. Am I making sense? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Acts 19 and1 and it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coast come into Ephesus finding certain disciples. Now, these are followers of Jesus. And he said unto them, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" Now you say, "Well now, Brother Wendle, when I receive Jesus, when I've accepted, when I've surrendered my life to the Lord, isn't that the same as receiving the Holy Ghost?" Not according to scripture. &gt;&gt; It's a process. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Okay. What's the three ingredients? What's the three ingredients to uh to to a birth? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Water. &gt;&gt; Blood. and spirit. &gt;&gt; There's a breaking of the water that well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There is the blood and then there is the spirit. &gt;&gt; The baby is not alive though went through the blood of Jesus went through the water of baptism. It's not a birth until the baby is the spirit comes into that baby and that baby becomes a a living being. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if that baby if if that spirit is not in that baby, you can you can give that baby a little slap on the rump and it ain't going to do nothing because there ain't no life in that baby. &gt;&gt; So, we're not just wanting the blood of Jesus. We're not just wanting to be baptized, but we want the Holy Spirit to come upon us and give us a new birth. So, the Apostle Paul is asking these people, he's asking them, "Amen. H or have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe? You're you're a Christian. You're following after Jesus. And let's let's find out what he says. He says uh he said unto them, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" And they said unto him, "We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost." And he said unto them, "Unto what then were you baptized?" And they said, "Unto John's baptism." Then said Paul, John verily baptized unto repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is on Christ Jesus. And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied. So, so these were believers, but they needed to receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, some say, well, do do you uh uh do do you have to receive do do you have to speak in tongues when you receive the Holy Ghost? No. The scripture plainly says that there in the book of 1 Corinthians the 12th chapter, he says, "Do all work miracles?" No. Are all apostles? No. Do all speak with tongues? No. He didn't put the nose in there. You're supposed to be doing the answering of that, right? Amen. So, he's saying that we do not all speak with tongues. There are people in this church here in this congregation that that have spoken tonesues when they received the Holy Ghost. There are some of you who have not spoke uh uh there's some of you that have spoken tonesues and there's some that have not spoken tongues and you've got the Holy Ghost. So, the tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost. the the the evidence of having the Holy Ghost is that new birth. It's a living reality. Jesus is real in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know when you've passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, you still live in the same old body. Hallelujah. You still like ice cream. You still like sardines if you like sardines. You still like Amen. You still like all of those kinds of things. But the sin nature, you're no longer bound by sin. You're no longer craving sin. Now you're craving God. You're craving to please him. You're craving to satisfy him. And if you ever mess up, you're not one to try to hide it and say, "No, I'm not wrong." And no, no, no, no, no. You always want to be that kind of a of a man or a woman, boy, or girl that says, "I am wrong." Why? Because your desire is to please the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are a Christian. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, praise the name of the Lord. So, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we want that. Amen. We want we we want the old lap now. I I've quit my drinking. I quit my smoking. The Lord's helped me with this and he's helped me with that. And it is the Lord. Oh my. Don't ever think that you can quit anything. It's God. And don't let the devil tell you that. Lots of times the devil says, "See, well, God didn't really do anything in your life. You You just finally got enough willpower." No man has enough willpower to quit sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's the power of God in your life that is working in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, what is this? What is this Holy Spirit? Luke 24:49, "Behold, I send the promise of my father upon you." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high." &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke wrote that. And then also Luke writes there in Acts 1:8, "But you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and in the uttermost parts of the earth." I just want to say, folks, we ought to rejoice because we are so blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. you you're blessed to receive the and I want to tell you there ain't two Holy Ghosts. Hallelujah. What they what they got on in the book of Acts is the same Holy Ghost we get today. &gt;&gt; It ain't changed. He's the same God. &gt;&gt; What God was there in the New Testament is what God is in the Old Test or or or in the church today. Can you say amen? He is. He's very much. You can receive the same baptism of the Holy Ghost, Devon, that that that Peter had, that Peter received, that Paul received, that Silas received. You can receive that exact same Holy Spirit in you. I'm telling you, it's not a different one. It is, it is still, it's one God. There's not three. There's not four or five. God is one. Can you say amen? And that Holy Spirit is the same Holy Ghost. Amen. Whatever that charity when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you get the same Holy Ghost I received. The same Holy Ghost that I received is what brother Brandham received. The same Well, are y'all understanding? It's not two different Holy Ghosts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And think of it. Just as a demon-possessed person and and and I don't know if you all have ever seen demonpossessed persons, but I'm they're strong and they're belligerent and they're mean and they're right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you receive the Holy Ghost, you become possessed of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; The same one that created the earth. The same one that said, "Let there be." The same. Are y'all understanding? You are possessed of a loving spirit. You are possessed of a spirit that is producing holiness and righteousness and healing and mercy. Can you say amen? Amen. And I and and I want to just tell you when the Holy Ghost comes upon you, if you ever receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, Amen. It is irrevocable. It cannot be changed. It cannot be reversed. It cannot be anulled. What God done at Pentecost, he will forever more do to every one of his sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; It is your promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I say, Lord, give me a cry. I think there's too there's not enough of a cry anymore &gt;&gt; because it's become the gospel has become so intellectualized. Everything is all intellectualism. We just come and we just the preacher teaches and we just all say but but the Holy Ghost is not a new thought. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not a new leaf. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the is the great God of heaven moving on the inside of you living his word &gt;&gt; into you. &gt;&gt; Now, amen. We We've been promised in this in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we've been promised that that the Holy Ghost would come to us in a greater measure than ever before. Now we understand that that it had been shut out at at the uh out at you know of the church at the door of religious dogmas and creeds where men have set up creeds and they've dogmas and their teachings and and and it's taken away the faith of the people until the Holy Spirit could not work in anyone anymore. Right? &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why we got to really watch what we believe. &gt;&gt; Listen, don't believe something that the Bible doesn't say &gt;&gt; because that little bit of doubt right there will will will will hold back. It'll hold back the Holy Spirit from your life. Again, what is my title? The Holy Spirit for a surrendered life. You can't say, "I'm going so far." You you've got to say, Lord, whatever is in your book, that's what I want for me. &gt;&gt; I want it for me. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; The message has come. Amen. It has come to us in this day for what purpose? To break down the barriers, the traditional barriers in your mind and soul. those things that have been preached at us and taught of to us that was not according to scripture. The message has come to to knock it all out so that the Holy Spirit can once again flow in the church. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's not that God has changed. It's not you say, "Well, why don't we see what we saw?" We we do see those things. Every surrendered heart will see the supernatural God at work in their lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you got to you're going to get fought hard. &gt;&gt; Satan's going to fight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Even even our brothers that got baptized last Wednesday night. You think you think the devil You think the devil's going to allow allow y'all to just get baptized and let everything be hunky dory? Satan's going to fight you hard, brother Bos. &gt;&gt; He's going to fight and fight and fight. &gt;&gt; But we got to understand this is worth it. Satan's trying to to to hinder me from receiving the Holy Ghost. Satan is trying to hinder me from God working his work in my life. I am going to fight it. I'm going to resist it. I'm going to stay with God's word because I want God to take total control of me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you just love it? &gt;&gt; See, that's what God has been doing. All right. Now, I've got a few more minutes be before I I before I quit. And and I want you to look here. Okay. Let's look here as you are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah. &gt;&gt; As the spirit of God, God came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which that body was born. God created, he spoke his word and created in the womb of Mary a seed. Hallelujah. Jesus was not a Jew. Jesus was not a Samaritan. Jesus was not a Gentile. &gt;&gt; Jesus was God. That's right. &gt;&gt; The blood. Hallelujah. You say, "Now, now there in the book of Acts, the 20th chapter, the Apostle Paul says, "We are saved by the blood of God." [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Saved by the blood of God. Amen. Now, so I want you to keep that in your mind. Amen. He created the blood cell. the blood cell, the the the the the seed, if you will, comes from the male. &gt;&gt; It does not come from the female. It comes from the male. God's blood, God's God's blood cell was created in the womb of Mary. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. But he had a reason for doing it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To redeem us back. &gt;&gt; Amen. the gift to put man back in authority and power over the over the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. So he created the cells in the womb of Mary for that body. It was not enough the Holy Spirit to just give life to a human of them supplied by Mary neither. Amen. That that would have been sinful mankind producing a body. that would not have produced the last Adam of of whom it was said lo a body thou father hast prepared to me it's pray for me so God not Mary provided that body Mary was the human incubator Mary was the one that held the the new creation she carried that holy child and brought him to birth he was a god man he was the son of god he was of a new creation. God and man had joined. Well, can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They're in 2 Corinthians 5:17. Amen. If you want to look at this real quick. Second 2 Corinthians 5 and 17. I'm in 1 Corinthians. It needs to be second. Hallelujah. 5 and 17. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away, and behold, all things are become new. &gt;&gt; Well, someone shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to watch this. You can see that though man was of the older order or the old creation, he is now in union with Christ and he has become the new creation of God. God is starting a new creation. So when we come in and this new birth, when you receive the Holy Ghost, it is the it's a new birth. God is starting a new creation in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's not it's not the old uh haven but there is a new creation. The Bible actually the Bible plainly says that there in the book of of of uh Revelations the third chapter. Amen. That Jesus was the first of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Now, it wasn't that God created him way back then. It was the first of the God race. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the first of the God race. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so let's just put it this way. I'm trying not to get too deep because it's Wednesday night and I don't want to be here too long, but I but I got I but I got some stuff that's that's coming to mind that's really good. Hallelujah. The Apostle Paul said there is the first man Adam and there is the last man Adam. Now, why would he call a first man Adam and the last man Adam? Well, the first man, Adam, Amen. He was the representative of all of all the humankind, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he sold us into sin. Therefore, by one man's sin, one man's offense, sin came upon us all. We're all born in a defeated life. &gt;&gt; But Jesus was the the last man, Adam. Jesus was the representative of God's new race. Jesus at with one man's sin uh uh uh uh death came upon all and with one man's righteousness uh uh with one man's right. Let's let's look here in the book of Romans just real quick. I I'll I'll show it to you. Amen. Praise the Lord. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now, I want us to look here in Romans the 5th chapter. And um we're going to start at the 17th verse. Praise the Lord. For by one man's offense, death reigned by one. Much more they which receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. Therefore, as by the offenses of one, judgment came unto all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift come upon all men unto justification. For if by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous, someone shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There was the first man, Adam. That's the natural. That's the sinner. But Jesus is the new. &gt;&gt; He is the author of the new race. &gt;&gt; So Jesus came. Amen. He wasn't born sexually. He was born the way that the rest of us should have been born. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now I I I I want us to c Now do you understand what I'm saying? Jesus was the first of the God race. I just want to say that when you receive the life of God on the inside of you, you become a part of the God race. You are a son of God. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now again, this new creation is not the old creation patched up. So, when you become a Christian, when you're born again, you it's not it's not that you're all patched up. It's not that God's it's okay. You're really an alcoholic, but but but we we'll deal with that. Yeah, you're really a liar, but we'll deal with that. You're really this and you're all patched up. No, the new creation is the very nature of God on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; You're born again, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if you're born again, you're not a slave. If you're born again, you're not a prisoner. If you're born again, you're a son of God. and all that God has is your at your disposal. &gt;&gt; The victories of God are right there with you. I I just want to say when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, brother, there there is there is nothing the devil can bring at you. Amen. Now, the devil's going to bring everything he can at you. He's going to he's going to throw everything your way that he can. But, brethren, when you're of that new race, there is no weapon formed against you that can prosper. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. of the old race of of of the of the old Some of us were Amen. Uh uh uh uh born my wife born a Cherokee. I I've got chalk tall. Uh uh there's some of you here that's pawny. There's there's some of you that don't know what you are. You just mut. Amen. There's We all come from We We We all come from the different a different but but what did the Bible say? He of one blood has redeemed us all from every tribe and nation and has brought us all into his great economy, his great family. Oh, can you say amen? Amen. Now, out of every nation, every tribe, every every kindred, he has purposed a new creation. Amen. He is the first of that creation. And he is still having sons and daughters that are born right here today in in this old world. I might be I might still be named Wendell Martin, but on the inside of me is a new creation. &gt;&gt; I'm a new being. I'm a son of God. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; His grace, his love, his it's been extended to me. I am of his kind. So by his spirit he's creating many sons to himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now if Jesus was the first of this new race, every child other child of God is going to have Amen. to be born of him. He's got to receive his spirit. He's got to receive his nature. &gt;&gt; And then that born again creation is a continuation of that creation that God started in Christ. M M &gt;&gt; Sometimes we judge ourselves too much by this. Me being me being a Martin, me being a human, me Amen. I've got I've got the nature of my father, the nature of my mother in me. Amen. That's that's come all the way on down. And then and that and that's that's that's produced complexes. And then my sons, the nature of their their mother or the nature of their father. Hallelujah. You think there's conflict between me and her. Sometimes it's it's on the inside of those boys. &gt;&gt; Amen. We come together and our natures go into our sons. &gt;&gt; We are all we all right. &gt;&gt; And sometimes when we come in and as as Christians, we keep judging ourselves by this. I keep judging myself by what I see in on on my birth certificate. Amen. And and that's that's all I see. But when I have been born again of the spirit of God, I'm of that new race. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That that soul on the inside of me has been born again. &gt;&gt; So you're no longer Amen. just Luke, the son of of Harry and Stephanie, you are Luke, the son of God. &gt;&gt; And when this body is done away with, and how how many knows this body is all got to be done away with? &gt;&gt; Amen. This this body between my mother and my father, Amen, this is going to go. It's got it can't even make the rapture even if you're even if you're going God God's got to change this old body even before you can even make it on the other side. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Bible says corruption must give way to incorruption. &gt;&gt; So what you've got on the inside of you is not just a good feeling. What God has done to you through the new birth is not just uh coming and joining a church. What God has done on the inside of you. It's the Holy Spirit has made a brand new creation of you through the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You're not selfish anymore. &gt;&gt; You're not you're not you're you're not living for yourself anymore. You're living for him. &gt;&gt; You're not you're not wanting to to to to to to be the big shot. You're not wanting to to you you now your desire, Amen, is the same desire God has. God's desire is redemption. God's been chasing after you all of your life to bring eternal life to you. And you find yourself acting the exact same way. &gt;&gt; It's the life of God on the inside of you. A person that's that's that's that's got to have everything their way all the time. And well, they just need they just need to be born again. That's what they need. &gt;&gt; They're selfish. And we're all born selfish. Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well. Just Hallelujah. Did you know pride, the middle, the middle letter of pride is I? &gt;&gt; P R I D E. Either way you look at it, whether you spell it frontwards or backwards, I I me. Pride. Me. Me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want this. I want that. I Yeah. I I I think I I Well, you didn't. Well, I I I I I. It's all. But when Jesus comes in &gt;&gt; and that new birth takes place now there's a reality. Now it's our desire we're living for others. &gt;&gt; Well, it's not about me anymore. It's God's life living on if the life that was in Jesus lives in me. the life that made Jesus please the father. And he went, the Bible says he went around doing good and healing all that were sick and oppressed of the devil. &gt;&gt; Jesus come, the Bible says he had compassion upon all of those who come and he groaned and he and he and he and he and he wept for those around him. And when you get the life of God on the inside of you, the very life of God is just pulsating in your life. I want to serve him. I want to I want to express his being. Everything about me, I want you to succeed because he's helping me to succeed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for the power of the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think we're going to quit right there. &gt;&gt; Oh, I think that's enough, right? That that right there is enough to wet all of your whistles. What if you haven't received the baptism of the Holy Ghost? I hope it wets your whistle. I hope it Yeah. I hope it makes you start hungering for the things of God. Remember, you were created to hunger not for the devil and the things of sin. You were created a hunger for God. And when God comes in and washes you and starts, Amen. washing these things away, then the real you begins to come out, &gt;&gt; the really who you are. And then desire says, I want more of God. I want more of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the good thing is, as the scripture says, Amen. Those that hunger and thirst after righteousness may actually be filled. &gt;&gt; Is that what it said? &gt;&gt; The Bible if they that hunger and thirst after righteousness &gt;&gt; shall &gt;&gt; shall didn't even say will. Shall &gt;&gt; it's the document. That's that's a judicial word. Shall &gt;&gt; be filled. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know what I'm going to start doing? I'm gonna start hungering and thirsting. God, I I I I just ask right now, I ask the Lord to just cause every one of you to start hungering and thirsting after God more and more. I pray that God just baptizes us all with a real with a real hunger. &gt;&gt; Oh, my real hunger. Amen. And if we're not hungry, why are we not hungry? Mama's in there cooking and she's got the table spread and she's got everything all sitting there and you're just n you're just picking at it and you're not wanting to eat it. Is because somebody has been eating some junk food. &gt;&gt; Somebody's been eating some Twinkies, some sneaking a candy bar. Hallelujah. Some of you wives are looking at your husbands. See, aren't you glad you come to church? I just I just told you the reason. Amen. see that that the Holy Spirit if we're not hungering for God the way we should is because Satan is filling that hunger with other stuff. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they that hunger and thirst after righteousness &gt;&gt; shall be filled. If the musicians would come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost has promised. &gt;&gt; Oh, the Holy Ghost. Yes, &gt;&gt; Lord. I want to I want your I want your presence. I I I I I want to receive the Holy Ghost more than I want anything else. &gt;&gt; I want your life in me, Lord. Give me a Give me a new birth. &gt;&gt; Did you know the first doctrine that Jesus ever preached? Did you know what you can anyone can anyone tell me what Jesus' first doctrine was? Huh? Did I hear somebody? Did you say you must be born again? That's right. Jesus first doctrine, you must be born again. And Nicodemus, who was a great teacher, he said, "Now, how can me being an old man, how can I go back into my mother's womb and be born again?" Jesus says, "That which is born of flesh is flesh, but that which is born of spirit is spirit." Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he talks about the water, the blood, and the spirit. There in the book of first John, the scripture says there are three that bear record in heaven. The father, the word, and the spirit. These three are one. There are three that bear record in the earth. &gt;&gt; Water, blood, and spirit. These three agree in one. God is in three offices. It's one God. It's one God. The invisible spirit. It's God living in a body. Now it's God living in me and you. Three offices of God. But you can have the water without having the spirit. You can have the blood without having the water. You can repent and not be sanctified. But as you repent, you're baptized in the name of the Lord. Amen. Washing our sins away. Then we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And this is the confirmation or brings the con the consummation of the new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I want more of God. &gt;&gt; You want more of God? You want more of God? I want more of God. How about you all? You boys want more of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Mas and daddies, y'all want more of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The cry the cry for more of God. &gt;&gt; Some says, "Well, we don't we we don't need altars anymore." And that kind of theology is just is just totally opposite of what the prophet taught. He was talking about the insincerity that comes people coming up chewing gum, coming up to an altar call and some preacher saying your mama's over there and your grandma's just begging and they're just pleading and hoping you're going to be there and you say, "Man, I don't want grandma spending eternity grieving over me. So, I'm going to come to an altar." But there's a genuine real genuine and don't and then ain't it ain't just an altar here at the church. It should be an altar at our house. It should be an altar wherever we are. It should be an altar. Lord, I want to please you now, guys. And and and and you know, I'm always preaching to these teenagers, but but those even even those of you that are that that that are that are at that 20 year old, you're in your, you know, you're you're in the prime. You guys that are in your in your 20s, it listen, don't let nothing take away the desire for more of God. Mas and daddies say, "I don't I don't care if you've been serving the Lord for a long time." And I and I I and I know I I I was looking at at a few quotes today and it says what we need today is another refilling another like the disciple. Some of you trying to test an experience or trust an experience that happened 10 years ago. That's all right. But what about today? You need one today. Today is the day. Sure, a filling. The disciples about three or four days after they received the Holy Ghost went back and got in one accord and began to pray until the Holy Ghost shook the building where they were sitting. It's a refilling. Every one of us need a refilling of the Holy Spirit. Can you say amen? Amen. He He He said, I see some of the tabernacle folks here. I'm going to say this about big sister. One thing that the tabernacle needs up there at our church, tabernacle with Jeff is a rededication and refilling of the Holy Ghost where everyone get down to the altar and pray until they get a renewing. Until they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost, the whole church filled with the power of God. That's what we need. Not only that tabernacle, but the body of Christ universal needs a refilling. David said one day, "Restore to me the joy of my salvation." Not that he lost his salvation, but the joy of [Music] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? [Music] He says, "Right this night while we're sitting here, if this right atmosphere would take place, the entire group would be refilled with the Holy Ghost and every sick person be made well." It's the atmosphere that does it. Another place, it'll take more than grease to open them eyes, brother. It'll take a fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost to massage your eyes and you can see and take the nearsightedness out of you so you can see the word of God is true. That's right. I counsel you to get some eyes sav the kind that anoints your eyes. He says, "But the church of the living God is making herself ready inside by renewing their faith daily in the Holy Ghost." My there just so many of those things as Amen. That's what we need. I'm just saying, Lord, not just not just for those who need the Holy Ghost. If you need it, it's a gift. You don't have to beg for it. God wants to give it, but it's a surrendered life. And in order to receive a refilling of the Holy Ghost, you've got to go back and be surrendered. Going back. I want to surrender everything I am to you. God bless you tonight. I don't want to live a powerless life. I want to live a vibrant life. As I said many times, I don't want to live a mediocre life with my wife. I'd rather have one to where we're close. I long for that. I I do. I I want I want that kind of a deal between me and God, a closeness. I long for that. You say, "Well, you're you're not satisfied." No. Not when heaven is waiting on me. Not when the when the skies are full of the Pentecostal blessings. Why would I Why would I be mediocre when there's more of God to be had? I want more. Amen. I want that. Praise the Lord. What are you singing? Hunger and thirst for you. &gt;&gt; I hunger and thirst for you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I hunger and thirst &gt;&gt; and thirst &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; for you. I hunger and thirst for you in the desert of my need. You're the fountain that I seek. &gt;&gt; You're the living water I &gt;&gt; I keep running into. [Music] I hest. Oh, bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I hunger and for you. Oh, I hunger and &gt;&gt; take all out of me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Scrub me with your word. &gt;&gt; I wash you. Let me do a cleanse. Lord, take all the junk out of me. If I need a cleanse, I sometimes we have to cleanse our these old bodies from this poisons and things that we that we get in them. I think sometimes we need to do that in our spiritual walk just to cleanse. Want to want to take a cleanse, get get rid of all that junk. And the opening of the word will do that. You know that that a living word will will cleanse you, wash all of the take all of the old stuff out. It'll it'll it'll take all of the junk out to where all you want is more of God. More of God. More of God. so much more of him. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; I want more of him. &gt;&gt; I want so much more of him. I I [Music] &gt;&gt; want a greater desire [Music] in the in the return in Jubilee the sermon. There was such a cry. He said, "Can't pray anymore? Why? Why is it that we can't pray anymore? Why Why is it that we He said, "Where is the seal that burned in the hearts and people walked the railroad track, picked up the corn and crushed it out there to bring the gospel up? We make them turn over our graves, bring disgrace to our fathers and mothers who fought to win the prize. Here we just luxury around denominations. He's calling again. He's pulled his elected church out of those denominations. God pulled that remnant out. That's what he's wanting. [Applause] He's the church has forgot those street meetings long ago. And the church forgot its long nights of prayer. Well, they can't pray 15 minutes no more. Oh my. When it does, it some little formal thing. Half of them fall asleep. I hate chickens trying to eat eagle food. You can't do it. Won't digest. Not built for it. But oh God, the only way you can ever get that is to be born again. I say, Lord, renew me. Give me my fire back. I I want more of him. I want more of him. Thankful for things, thankful for friends, but I want more of God.
