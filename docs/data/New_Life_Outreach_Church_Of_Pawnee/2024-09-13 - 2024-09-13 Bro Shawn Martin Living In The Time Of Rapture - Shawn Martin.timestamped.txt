[53:01] just want to say I appreciate the
[53:03] hospitality uh that uh has just been
[53:07] shown to us and uh there's something
[53:09] about uh the py church here they they
[53:12] know how to make a person welcome and uh
[53:16] they also know how to make a person gain
[53:18] weight and uh uh but uh we uh we
[53:23] certainly appreciate brother Wendell
[53:25] sister Fresca
[53:27] and the congregation here and working uh
[53:30] with the vision that brother Wendell has
[53:34] and I just say God bless you uh very
[53:37] much we know what
[53:39] it it takes to uh have a meeting and uh
[53:44] all the laborers I know the pastor can't
[53:47] do it all himself it takes the
[53:49] congregation and people with a vision
[53:52] and so we certainly certainly uh
[53:55] appreciate each and every one I

[54:11] shoulder toh shoulder with you as we
[54:14] fight the battle amen and um I uh I
[54:19] believe that God's people are the most
[54:21] precious thing on the face of the Earth
[54:24] and God must have thought so too he he
[54:27] gave his own blood for the people and
[54:30] brother brandom said what is greater the
[54:32] blood or the purchase of the blood and
[54:35] he definitely told us it's the purchase
[54:37] of the blood of Jesus Christ and I U
[54:40] just so thankful to be a part of you
[54:43] amen and we must keep pressing the
[54:45] battle church amen it's almost over amen
[54:49] we're almost finished amen and um I just
[54:53] love the Lord you love him and I truly
[54:56] believe that God wants to bless his
[54:58] people and if you need the Holy Ghost
[55:02] tonight God wants to give it to you if
[55:04] you need healing God wants to give that
[55:06] to you more than you'll ever want that
[55:08] he he wants to give it to you if you
[55:11] need salvation or whatever you have need
[55:14] of God wants to give it to you tonight
[55:18] and I just wonder if we could just bow
[55:20] our heads unto the Lord and whatever
[55:23] your need is whatever you're facing just
[55:26] ask the Lord to to meet them I certainly
[55:30] can't do it no man can but God certainly
[55:33] can he knows exactly where you're at he
[55:36] knows the need you've got but not only
[55:38] knows them but he knows how to meet
[55:41] them precious

[56:52] Jesus Christ's
[56:54] name amen and
[56:57] amen if you have your
[57:00] Bibles we want to turn
[57:02] to first Thessalonians first of
[57:06] all amen the fourth chapter the 16th
[57:11] verse very familiar
[57:14] scripture
[57:16] reading for us as message
[57:21] Believers one that is very important to
[57:24] us amen
[57:31] amen and I want to just say it's good to
[57:33] have my wife here and my children and um
[57:39] we left uh three home they're married

[57:58] you amen but uh sure love uh my wife my
[58:03] children amen been a great support amen
[58:07] they're home at church amen and um but
[58:11] first Thessalonians the 4th
[58:14] chapter and
[58:16] um the 16th
[58:19] verse for the Lord himself shall descend
[58:22] from heaven with the
[58:24] Shout with the voice of the Archangel
[58:26] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[58:28] in Christ shall rise
[58:30] first then we which are alive and remain
[58:33] shall be caught up together with them in
[58:36] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[58:39] and so shall we ever be with the
[58:42] Lord wherefore Comfort one
[58:45] another with these words aren't you glad
[58:47] you can be comforted by that scripture
[58:50] amen Comfort one another if you'd like
[58:53] to turn with me also to the Book of
[58:55] Psalms the 34th
[58:58] chapter and we just read one
[59:05] verse Psalms
[59:11] 34
[59:16] and we'll actually let's go to the sixth
[59:19] verse start there this poor man
[59:22] cried and the Lord heard him and saved
[59:25] him
[59:26] out of all of his
[59:28] troubles the angel of the Lord encampeth
[59:33] round about them that fear Him and
[59:46] deliverthat this
[59:50] evening I want
[59:53] to if I would title this it would would
[59:56] be living in the time of
[59:58] rapture and um you know there are two
[1:00:02] major events that are fixing to take
[1:00:06] place and that's the Rapture and the
[1:00:10] Great
[1:00:11] Tribulation and the prophet taught us
[1:00:14] that we are living at the junction of
[1:00:17] time and he tells us that this is the
[1:00:19] seventh Junction and he said the next
[1:00:22] thing there is is that we're going to
[1:00:26] a
[1:00:27] millennium
[1:00:29] and time will cease at this Junction he
[1:00:34] says and Eternity will begin for us
[1:00:37] ain't that right now most people don't
[1:00:39] like the subject of rapture uh when you
[1:00:42] begin to talk of the Rapture you you're
[1:00:45] talking about the end of the world it it
[1:00:48] it fear begins to uh well it just scares
[1:00:52] people and they're scared of being left
[1:00:55] behind and and scared of uh you know the
[1:00:59] future and all of these things but I
[1:01:01] will tell you the people of God don't
[1:01:03] need to be
[1:01:05] scared uh uh there there's there's no
[1:01:07] point in being scared God doesn't want
[1:01:09] us to be scared I I think when we talk
[1:01:12] about the Rapture it ought to be just
[1:01:13] something
[1:01:15] glorious uh uh to us uh because uh the
[1:01:19] Rapture is for the people of God do you
[1:01:22] believe that brother brandom said it's a
[1:01:24] predestinated seed that goes in the
[1:01:27] Rapture and so what a blessed people we
[1:01:31] are to be living in the age uh that
[1:01:34] we're living because see we are the
[1:01:37] people with whom God is finishing up his
[1:01:41] plan amen uh there's no need for time to
[1:01:45] continue when God has fulfilled every
[1:01:48] his purpose in this time of mortality
[1:01:52] this this this dimension of time you see
[1:01:55] we are are the ones that have stood the
[1:01:58] test we are the ones that that have uh
[1:02:01] rendered Satan powerless we are the
[1:02:05] people young and old in between we are
[1:02:08] the people that have arrived that Satan
[1:02:11] don't know what to do with and uh uh and
[1:02:14] and so therefore there is no need for us
[1:02:17] to stay here in this evil world anymore
[1:02:21] you see Satan has thrown everything he
[1:02:24] can at us and yet we're still
[1:02:28] standing can you say amen I I don't know
[1:02:31] about you but we've got I've just gone
[1:02:33] through hell you know and and the things
[1:02:36] of Satan just putting everything on us
[1:02:39] but I will tell you this I still got my
[1:02:41] joy I still got my peace I still got my
[1:02:45] faith I I I I still I I still got my
[1:02:49] song I I still have what what God gave
[1:02:53] me and how true it is the the world
[1:02:56] didn't give it and the world can't take
[1:02:58] it away ain't that right amen and so we
[1:03:02] we've gone through trials and yet we're
[1:03:04] still here which shows the reality of
[1:03:08] what we had talked about last night that
[1:03:10] we have been loosed by his own blood
[1:03:14] amen we've been loosed from Satan's grip
[1:03:17] and and this is The Showdown uh uh uh in
[1:03:20] this age in Satan's Eden when all the
[1:03:23] Demons of hell has been Unleashed and
[1:03:26] yet we're still standing it is God's
[1:03:29] Victory we are his victory which shows
[1:03:33] that the blood really works can you say
[1:03:35] Amen it doesn't matter how weak you are
[1:03:38] it doesn't no matter what the habits you
[1:03:40] are we've all been made up of different
[1:03:42] ways some of us are nervous some of us
[1:03:44] are passionate some of us got this and
[1:03:46] that but and through every every aspect
[1:03:50] of life through all peoples of the earth
[1:03:52] there is a blood that still stands amen
[1:03:56] and God has showed that no matter what
[1:03:58] the devil has to offer and no matter
[1:04:00] what he can put on us and no matter how
[1:04:03] much he can afflict us some have been
[1:04:05] Afflicted in their minds some are
[1:04:07] afflicted in their bodies some are
[1:04:09] afflicted in whatever but we have been
[1:04:11] loosed by the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:04:14] Satan ain't got no hold upon us anymore
[1:04:18] amen so hence the Rapture is at hand can
[1:04:22] you say amen I believe everyone that's
[1:04:24] going in the Rapture they
[1:04:26] Overcomers amen amen and God's proved
[1:04:29] that we're Overcomers because we're
[1:04:31] still standing in this time of Le osia
[1:04:35] amen and by God's grace we have been
[1:04:38] tied to the very thing that is bringing
[1:04:40] on this Rapture now the prophet said the
[1:04:43] end time message everybody say the end
[1:04:46] time message the end time message is to
[1:04:49] get the bride ready and prepared for the
[1:04:52] Rapture what can it do according to
[1:04:54] Malachi 4
[1:04:56] is to bring them back to the faith that
[1:04:58] was once delivered to the Saints bring
[1:05:01] them back to the faith of the fathers
[1:05:03] the Pentecostal part in the restoration
[1:05:06] time I will restore saith the Lord
[1:05:11] that's real event in time evangelism can
[1:05:15] you say Amen if you remember the angel
[1:05:18] of the Lord told Brother brandham that
[1:05:20] his ministry would be like unto John the
[1:05:23] Baptist amen he was in the h at the
[1:05:26] whole Ohio River and he was he was in
[1:05:28] there baptizing I believe the 17th
[1:05:31] person and and the angel of the Lord uh
[1:05:34] came down and brother Brandon would talk
[1:05:36] about it he says I was baptizing at 2:00
[1:05:39] in the afternoon and right out of a
[1:05:41] brassy sky where there hadn't been rain
[1:05:44] for weeks here he come with a Roar and
[1:05:47] said as John the Baptist was sent forth
[1:05:49] to forerun the first coming of Christ
[1:05:52] you're sent forth with a message to
[1:05:55] forerun on the second coming of Christ
[1:05:57] ain't that right now later on in his
[1:06:00] ministry it was revealed to him that his
[1:06:03] message was the seventh angel uh uh uh
[1:06:07] of Revelations uh uh 10 uh7 and so this
[1:06:12] explains why his his message is so
[1:06:16] important to those who are predestinated
[1:06:19] to be a a part of the Rapture amen for
[1:06:23] brother brandom would say this the
[1:06:25] seventh Angel's message under the same
[1:06:28] trumpet same everything exactly same
[1:06:30] seal is to what call the people the
[1:06:34] bride out of Pentecostal uh out of the
[1:06:38] Pentecostal and World tradition to the
[1:06:41] atonement everybody say the atonement
[1:06:44] call us back to the atonement the word
[1:06:47] Christ impersonated in his word here
[1:06:51] made flesh Among Us he said see science
[1:06:55] has Prov D it by pictures the church
[1:06:57] knows it the world around we firmly we
[1:07:01] firmly know it can you say Amen we know
[1:07:04] what this message is about we know amen
[1:07:07] why God sent us this message we firmly
[1:07:11] know it see amen and for he has never
[1:07:14] told us one thing and thus say the Lord
[1:07:17] but what's been the truth he said did he
[1:07:19] not say down there at the river as John
[1:07:22] the Baptist was sent amen so will this
[1:07:25] message as well now we know brother
[1:07:28] brandom identified this message that he
[1:07:30] had as the shout amen of first
[1:07:33] Thessalonians 4:16 ain't that right amen
[1:07:37] it's it's tied to the Rapture you see
[1:07:39] this message of the of the hour that
[1:07:42] we're believing is the key to the dead
[1:07:45] amen of of those that have slept went in
[1:07:48] slept in Christ amen of coming out of
[1:07:51] the ground it is the key to the changing
[1:07:54] of our body it is the key to us being
[1:07:57] caught up to meet the Lord in the air oh
[1:08:00] my I'm so glad to be part of the message
[1:08:03] of the hour amen see and brother Brandon
[1:08:06] would also say that the bridegroom call
[1:08:09] will come through this amen it's not
[1:08:12] just the voice of a man that we're
[1:08:14] listening to it's the voice of our
[1:08:16] bridegroom amen that is calling us
[1:08:19] calling us ain't that right amen you see
[1:08:22] why would God go through great links
[1:08:26] Amen to uh uh uh to show the
[1:08:29] supernatural Amen in brother bram's
[1:08:31] Ministry well it was God vindicating
[1:08:35] this man and his message to
[1:08:38] us can you say amen and he was letting
[1:08:42] us know that no matter how rejected this
[1:08:45] message is to the world and and no
[1:08:47] matter how strange it may seem to the
[1:08:49] world yet God approved of it himself
[1:08:53] amen I I uh I pre appreciate that you
[1:08:56] know the picture of brother Brandon with
[1:08:58] the the pillar of fire over his head and
[1:09:01] and and you know I I know you know some
[1:09:03] don't don't believe that the church is a
[1:09:05] Fitting Place for uh uh uh for that
[1:09:08] picture and and and these things and and
[1:09:11] and but you know what uh to me amen I
[1:09:14] just believe that that God Amen you know
[1:09:17] brother Ram said we have a greater proof
[1:09:20] we are more blessed to have that picture
[1:09:23] amen uh uh than we are to even just see
[1:09:26] the pillar of fire with our eyes for he
[1:09:28] said you know he said you could see it
[1:09:31] but your mind could be playing tricks on
[1:09:33] you yeah uh that could be a psychology
[1:09:35] thing he said but the picture is not
[1:09:37] psychology it's the real thing amen the
[1:09:40] camera doesn't take psychology it's not
[1:09:43] there just imagining that it's there it
[1:09:45] literally took a picture of God Amen
[1:09:49] having his picture with brother brandom
[1:09:51] can you say man I know we we like that
[1:09:54] picture and I thank God for that picture
[1:09:55] too but that picture is just a painting
[1:09:58] amen and and brother brandom said that
[1:10:00] picture is just the closest amen that he
[1:10:03] saw of Jesus Christ but that's just
[1:10:05] still a painting amen but the picture of
[1:10:08] brother Brandon with the pillar of fire
[1:10:10] that ain't a painting that is a reality
[1:10:12] that was literally God having his
[1:10:15] picture taken not that we would worship
[1:10:18] a man but to let us know that this
[1:10:21] message is right and if God Can Say Amen
[1:10:24] to it I can say say Amen to it if God
[1:10:27] would make his his whole person in this
[1:10:30] message then we can do the same thing
[1:10:33] God testifying that this message is
[1:10:35] Right amen God don't want his bride
[1:10:38] having questions amen God don't want his
[1:10:40] people being filled with questions
[1:10:42] whether this is right and this is right
[1:10:44] and this I just say Amen to it all if
[1:10:47] God's a senator a prophet Amen to speak
[1:10:50] it well you know brother brandham said
[1:10:52] that when God gets ready to speak to his
[1:10:54] people sends a prophet aren't you glad
[1:10:57] for the prophet of Malachi
[1:10:59] 4 yes sir see amen so he backed it up by
[1:11:03] the supernatural amen now in the Old
[1:11:06] Testament God had had a Promised Land
[1:11:09] prepared for his Promised Land people
[1:11:11] and and brother brandom would say he had
[1:11:14] first he had a people that he had made a
[1:11:16] land for them he had prepared a land for
[1:11:19] them and now he sent down there a
[1:11:22] preparation for it for the promised land
[1:11:24] people and it was only for those who
[1:11:27] were predestinated to that Promised Land
[1:11:31] bride day see and how he done it he sent
[1:11:34] a prophet with a message identified it
[1:11:37] by a pillar of fire and gave a token
[1:11:40] that they could rest assure that it was
[1:11:44] right how many's rest assured that this
[1:11:47] message is right I I got to say to you
[1:11:49] I'm not looking for another message I'm
[1:11:51] not looking for another messenger I
[1:11:54] don't need another prophet to come and
[1:11:56] tell me what to do amen I'm assure I'm
[1:11:59] resting in the fact that God sent a
[1:12:02] prophet and he Vindicated this man can
[1:12:05] you say man that's right I'll take his
[1:12:08] opinion over anybody else's
[1:12:12] opinion amen see he sent a prophet with
[1:12:15] the message identified it by a pillar
[1:12:17] fire gave a token that they could rest
[1:12:20] assure that it was right that's right it
[1:12:23] was her consolation
[1:12:26] and I don't know about you but this
[1:12:27] message is my consolation I don't know
[1:12:30] about a lot of things in politics I
[1:12:32] don't know a lot of things about science
[1:12:33] I don't know a lot of things about this
[1:12:35] world but one Prophet
[1:12:37] Elijah can you say man you see the
[1:12:40] Vindicated Prophet the pillar of fire
[1:12:43] the Messiah sign the first and second
[1:12:45] and third pool the supernatural amen see
[1:12:49] they are a consolation to us who are
[1:12:52] predestinated Amen to the promised land
[1:12:55] amen we're not following a man amen just
[1:12:58] like uh in 2 Peter 2:16 I believe he
[1:13:02] declared we have not followed cunningly
[1:13:05] devised fables when we made known unto
[1:13:09] you the power and coming of our Lord
[1:13:11] Jesus Christ but were I Witnesses of his
[1:13:15] majesty can you say amen amen see so we
[1:13:19] we find that the power and the coming of
[1:13:22] our Lord Jesus Christ has been made
[1:13:24] known to to us amen and we're not
[1:13:27] following cunningly devised fables amen
[1:13:31] can you say amen amen God has so
[1:13:34] Vindicated this message that there
[1:13:36] should be no question to it amen there
[1:13:39] should be no doubt to it it well it it's
[1:13:42] just the truth Amen brother Bram said
[1:13:45] now you don't have to believe it until
[1:13:47] God says it's the truth you don't have
[1:13:49] to believe nothing until God says it's
[1:13:51] the
[1:13:53] truth ain't that right you're not
[1:13:55] obligated to believe it until God says
[1:13:57] it's the truth amen he said but if it's
[1:14:00] according to God's word and God backs it
[1:14:02] up and says it's the truth then it's a
[1:14:05] sin to disbelieve
[1:14:08] it can you say Amen you see so we find
[1:14:12] that God has been preparing us for a
[1:14:15] Rapture now the word rapture as we know
[1:14:18] means caught up amen and and brother
[1:14:21] brandom taught that there's going to be
[1:14:24] a rapture you know it's it's sad but you
[1:14:27] know people even even in the message
[1:14:28] debate whether it's a a literal thing or
[1:14:31] or what but brother brandham said
[1:14:33] there's going to be a Rapture in
[1:14:35] 1965 he said all all Christians believe
[1:14:39] that there will be a Rapture he says how
[1:14:42] many in here believe that the Bible
[1:14:44] teaches there's a will be a Rapture of
[1:14:47] the church that's exactly right a
[1:14:50] catching away of the church another
[1:14:53] place he said see this this Rapture that
[1:14:55] we're talking about is only for the
[1:14:58] bride remember the Bible says the rest
[1:15:00] of the Dead live not for a thousand
[1:15:02] years see this great Rapture if there's
[1:15:05] not a Rapture friends where are we
[1:15:10] at if there is no rapture we have every
[1:15:14] right to be
[1:15:15] scared of the things that are coming and
[1:15:18] and the trouble and and and the the
[1:15:21] plagues that are coming upon this Earth
[1:15:23] men are going crazy the these days amen
[1:15:26] and if there's no Rapture amen we've got
[1:15:28] every right to be fearful and scared and
[1:15:32] Afraid and all these things he said see
[1:15:35] what are we going to do what age are we
[1:15:37] living in what promise do we have but
[1:15:40] there's going to be a Rapture the Bible
[1:15:43] says there will be a Rapture and it'll
[1:15:45] only be for the elected lady the bride
[1:15:48] in this day that's pulled out the church
[1:15:51] now after he preached the the the
[1:15:54] message rapture
[1:15:55] amen he uh he preached four more sermons
[1:15:59] amen that he had uh uh uh before he went
[1:16:02] home to be with the Lord and the next
[1:16:04] night uh of he had preached the Rapture
[1:16:07] the next night he preached on things
[1:16:09] that are to be and he says this now
[1:16:11] speaking last night on The Rapture he
[1:16:14] said I want to speak on this subject
[1:16:15] that I might tie it together with last
[1:16:18] night's message for there is going to be
[1:16:20] a rapture we know that see that's in the
[1:16:23] future to be can you say amen he said
[1:16:26] now Jesus here speaking he's gone ahead
[1:16:28] to prepare a place he's gone ahead
[1:16:31] aren't you glad for that this Rapture is
[1:16:33] not just a sudden thing uh that's popped
[1:16:36] up in his mind God already knew that
[1:16:38] there was going to be a Rapture amen he
[1:16:41] died that you could go into a Rapture
[1:16:43] amen he he he broke the powers of Satan
[1:16:47] Amen on go goth so that you could be
[1:16:50] sure to go in a rapture
[1:16:55] yeah he knew he said I go away to
[1:16:56] prepare a place for you ain't that right
[1:17:00] so you know going on down and he says
[1:17:03] this he says now he Jesus when he says
[1:17:06] when you see my life ending it's ending
[1:17:08] for a purpose I'm going away to prepare
[1:17:10] a place for you that where I am you may
[1:17:13] be there also see Jesus therefore is
[1:17:17] telling his disciples that this life is
[1:17:20] not ended in
[1:17:22] death oh because I go and prepare a
[1:17:26] place that is to receive them shows that
[1:17:29] there see he was speaking to them that
[1:17:31] there was a life amen after this life is
[1:17:35] ended what a consolation that ought to
[1:17:38] give to us all Amen to know that after
[1:17:41] this life is over there is a life that
[1:17:44] we go into oh aren't you glad for that
[1:17:48] and as you get older that becomes more
[1:17:50] of a reality to you as you begin to see
[1:17:53] the days of your life drawing on close
[1:17:55] then it begins to see you begin to pack
[1:17:58] up closer getting ready for that great
[1:18:00] event it's continuing of this same life
[1:18:03] in another world in another place in
[1:18:06] another
[1:18:08] condition ain't that right see so then
[1:18:11] the next night brother Brandon preached
[1:18:13] modern events made clear by prophecy he
[1:18:16] said we're not living in a Pentecostal
[1:18:18] age we're not living in another age
[1:18:21] we're not living in the Methodist age
[1:18:23] we're we're living in another age now
[1:18:26] we're living on up here to the bride age
[1:18:29] everybody say bride age it's not a sin
[1:18:31] to say bride age amen there ain't
[1:18:33] nothing wrong with believing bride age
[1:18:36] amen we wouldn't even know there's a
[1:18:37] bride age if it hadn't been for a
[1:18:39] prophet amen that Amen to declare it to
[1:18:42] us he said see we're living up here to
[1:18:45] the bright age the calling out of the
[1:18:48] church and getting it together for the
[1:18:51] Rapture you understand why God would
[1:18:53] send a message your way
[1:18:55] amen it's not just like a Methodist
[1:18:57] message it's not just like a Baptist
[1:18:59] message it's it's not conformed to a
[1:19:01] Pentecostal me this is a message to get
[1:19:03] you ready for a Rapture amen God wants
[1:19:06] to make sure you make it in the
[1:19:11] Rapture amen see getting it together for
[1:19:14] a Rapture that's the age everybody say
[1:19:17] that's the age we're living in

[1:19:24] on amen just a figure of speech it's a
[1:19:27] real happening you know brother Brown
[1:19:29] said what the Rapture is it's a roll
[1:19:31] call that takes place in heaven amen
[1:19:35] Jesus said in John 5:2 the hour is
[1:19:37] coming and now is when the dead shall
[1:19:39] hear the voice of the Son of God and
[1:19:42] they that he shall live amen those that

[1:20:32] wait till my change Come Thou shalt call
[1:20:38] and I will answer thee thou will have a
[1:20:42] desire to the work of thine hands aren't

[1:20:48] see what is it it's the great Shepherd
[1:20:50] calling his Sheep by name the creative
[1:20:53] voice of God calls them forth from the
[1:20:55] dust or changing their atoms even though
[1:20:59] they had not fallen asleep so the rad
[1:21:01] call is not just for those that have
[1:21:03] went into the ground amen but it's a
[1:21:06] roll call for you and I that are still
[1:21:08] alive and remaining you don't have to go

[1:21:48] place it says don't get the Rapture amen
[1:21:51] of the church and the white Throne

[1:22:04] [Applause]

[1:24:14] is the redeemed you see he came to
[1:24:17] redeem all names written in the Lamb's
[1:24:20] Book of Life brother Brown would tell us
[1:24:23] Jesus come to seek and save that which
[1:24:26] was on that book he bought the book of
[1:24:29] redemption it was lost and he redeemed
[1:24:32] us and all names was on that book was

[1:24:51] tonight right amen why you're coming out

[1:24:57] because there's something that is
[1:24:59] pulling you it's time for Rapture church
[1:25:02] it's time to get out of here and
[1:25:05] something is pulling
[1:25:09] you sir you remember the little eaglet
[1:25:12] in the chicken yard born there Amen in
[1:25:17] the chicken yard but that's not his
[1:25:19] origin he come from another place he was
[1:25:23] identified he's got different different
[1:25:24] jeans in
[1:25:26] him amen all he needed to hear was the
[1:25:29] scream of Mama Eagle come up higher amen
[1:25:34] now now the scream just just called it
[1:25:37] was just a normal scream just a scream
[1:25:39] but the chickens never responded to it
[1:25:41] but something about that eagle there was
[1:25:44] something word calling word Jean calling
[1:25:47] Jean can you say amen amen and the eagle
[1:25:51] began to identify I'm not to be here in
[1:25:54] this chicken yard I I'm supposed to be
[1:25:56] up there and so is that God would send
[1:25:59] the prophet of Malachi 4 so you could
[1:26:02] identify that you're not belonging in
[1:26:04] here you don't belong in Tribulation you
[1:26:07] don't belong under the wrath of God uh
[1:26:10] you belong Amen in the Heights Amen in
[1:26:13] the Rapture in the Rapture Hallelujah
[1:26:18] that little eaglet he couldn't identify
[1:26:20] with what's going on on the earth and
[1:26:23] now I may get on your toes for a moment
[1:26:26] but we ain't identifying with
[1:26:29] politics this ain't the time to be
[1:26:31] wrapped up in politics oh I just hope
[1:26:34] Trump gets in and I hope this one gets
[1:26:35] in I hope no don't you identify with
[1:26:38] there ain't no Miracle Worker amen the
[1:26:41] prophet said this nation's gone there
[1:26:43] ain't nothing going he said you can put
[1:26:45] AB Lincoln in every all the ab Lincoln
[1:26:47] you want in every County and every
[1:26:49] office it ain't going to help there's
[1:26:51] only one thing left for this church it's
[1:26:53] to Bri of Jesus
[1:26:57] Christ and I just tell you it don't
[1:26:59] matter what candidate gets in it's going
[1:27:01] to be
[1:27:02] bad why because America can't stand this
[1:27:06] world can't God sent you a prophet way
[1:27:09] before this happened amen wa for this
[1:27:11] time way before this election and he
[1:27:13] told us amen a nation cannot stand we're
[1:27:17] at the end of time can you say man it
[1:27:20] ain't time to get involved in the world
[1:27:22] uh it's time to lift up your head for
[1:27:25] your Redemption draw with
[1:27:33] nigh that
[1:27:35] eaglet he couldn't identify with what
[1:27:37] was the Earthly but he began to identify
[1:27:40] with what was in the
[1:27:42] heavens amen the church just didn't have
[1:27:45] that satisfying something the world
[1:27:47] didn't have that satisfying that he
[1:27:49] needed that the prophet said but you
[1:27:52] heard something else that was a scream
[1:27:54] and you realize that you were born for
[1:27:58] that now I know they want to pick this
[1:28:01] message apart and and and all that but
[1:28:03] I'm telling you I was born for it I was
[1:28:06] born for this message amen I understand
[1:28:10] it's a supernatural message and it
[1:28:12] seemed like I'm way down here and the
[1:28:14] message is up here but all I can say to
[1:28:16] you I was born for that I I recognize
[1:28:20] that I was born to be adopted son of God
[1:28:23] I was born to be quickened by a spirit I
[1:28:26] was born for a body change I was born to
[1:28:29] be an overcomer I was born Amen to soar
[1:28:33] in the
[1:28:35] heavenlies I was born for that brother
[1:28:38] Brown said you're part of it see you fit
[1:28:40] into it like a glove on a hand now birds
[1:28:44] of a feather flock together because they
[1:28:47] have things in common brother Bram says
[1:28:50] buzzards and doves has nothing in common
[1:28:54] their diet is different although a dove
[1:28:56] could be hatched under a buzzard depends
[1:28:58] on what it was to begin with now in and
[1:29:01] in that though the dove might have uh to
[1:29:05] be mothered a while by that by that
[1:29:07] Buzzard but finally he'll find his
[1:29:11] mate and that's what the church is doing
[1:29:13] today for Jesus is the word and he's the
[1:29:16] bridegroom and the Bride is a part of
[1:29:18] the groom therefore that word has to be
[1:29:21] fulfilled this day is the same part of
[1:29:23] the word word that was fulfilled in his
[1:29:25] day it's the same word same experience
[1:29:29] same Jesus Christ same Ministry same
[1:29:33] power same in action can you say amen
[1:29:37] amen when we say it's Jesus Christ the
[1:29:39] same yesterday today and forever when we
[1:29:42] talk about the revealing of the son of
[1:29:44] man we ain't talking about another
[1:29:46] person we're talking about the same
[1:29:48] Jesus Christ in a different body but the
[1:29:51] same God same power same effect same
[1:29:55] Victory amen the the Devil Couldn't
[1:29:57] defeat him and the devil can't defeat
[1:29:59] him now it's the same person in
[1:30:02] different
[1:30:05] bodies Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:30:10] Christ in you the hope of
[1:30:14] glory oh my amen so there's going to be
[1:30:18] a
[1:30:19] Rapture now one might think that that
[1:30:22] that the Rapture is just about getting
[1:30:26] caught up in
[1:30:27] Revelation I had a man tell me that's
[1:30:30] what the Rapture is it's we're getting
[1:30:33] caught up in
[1:30:34] Revelation but brother Braham didn't
[1:30:36] teach that now he did say that the the
[1:30:39] the Rapture is a revelation to her to
[1:30:41] the church the bride it's revealed to
[1:30:44] her the Revelation the true bride of
[1:30:47] Christ will be waiting for that
[1:30:48] revelation of the Rapture see it's a
[1:30:51] revelation for the Revelation is Faith
[1:30:52] you cannot have revelation without it
[1:30:54] being faith faith is a revelation
[1:30:57] because it's something that's revealed
[1:30:59] to you ain't that right but the
[1:31:01] Revelation gives Faith to the bride for
[1:31:04] a
[1:31:06] Rapture now now brother Ram would tell
[1:31:08] us this he said I want you to get built
[1:31:09] up now in this holy Oracles of God in
[1:31:13] the faith the faith of this
[1:31:16] hour the faith see it's going to take
[1:31:19] more faith than ever was in any age for
[1:31:22] this has to be rapturing
[1:31:25] Faith to be taken up can you say Amen so
[1:31:28] the Revelation comes to us and gives
[1:31:32] faith for the Rapture ain't that right
[1:31:34] brother Bram said when the Holy Ghost
[1:31:36] comes and reveals the word and makes it
[1:31:38] live just exact then it's a revelation
[1:31:41] to you see this message is not just a
[1:31:43] teaching it's a revelation and you'll
[1:31:46] never be able to take that Revelation
[1:31:47] out for for Upon This Rock I'll build
[1:31:51] the uh uh what what did he say I'll
[1:31:52] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:31:55] cannot Prevail against it now how could
[1:31:57] you stand in this day without a message
[1:32:00] how could you stand in this day without
[1:32:03] a faith that was imparted to you amen
[1:32:07] God showed it God Vindicated and it
[1:32:09] built such a faith that this is right
[1:32:11] now the gates of hell is trying to
[1:32:14] Prevail but it will never Prevail over
[1:32:17] this
[1:32:19] church thank God for the message thank
[1:32:22] God for the message you people wouldn't
[1:32:24] be where you are without this message
[1:32:26] this message is what's making us this
[1:32:29] message is what's making our homes the
[1:32:30] way it is this message is what's making
[1:32:33] our church the way it is this message is
[1:32:35] what's making you moms and you dads and
[1:32:37] you young people the way it is and the
[1:32:40] devil don't know what to do with
[1:32:43] you I say thank God for the message of
[1:32:45] the hour don't water this message down
[1:32:48] preach the
[1:32:50] message we ain't looking for anything
[1:32:53] else we don't need need anybody to
[1:32:54] tickle our fancy we just want somebody
[1:32:57] to preach the message the way a prophet
[1:32:59] preached
[1:33:00] [Music]
[1:33:04] it can you say
[1:33:08] amen I have to tell you the spirit of
[1:33:10] Truth has come in this
[1:33:12] day and has made the word known to us
[1:33:16] and has made it live just exactly what
[1:33:18] it said it would do and the Revelation
[1:33:21] has already struck our hearts
[1:33:25] do you believe
[1:33:26] [Applause]
[1:33:28] it now by this
[1:33:31] revelation we are fulfilling what Enoch
[1:33:34] typed Genesis 5:24 and Enoch walked with
[1:33:40] God not walk with
[1:33:43] politician not walk with some
[1:33:45] educator educated
[1:33:49] idiot now I'm starting to act like my
[1:33:51] brother
[1:33:54] amen see amen not not to walk with the
[1:33:57] science not to walk with the Theologian
[1:34:00] amen but to walk with God you're called
[1:34:03] to walk with God you're called to walk
[1:34:06] with God handin hand with God can you
[1:34:09] imagine think of that God was so
[1:34:11] gracious that you could walk handin hand
[1:34:13] with
[1:34:15] [Applause]
[1:34:16] him Enoch walked with God and he was not
[1:34:21] for God took him
[1:34:26] you see Enoch walked with God by
[1:34:29] Revelation the Revelation he had
[1:34:32] received but God
[1:34:34] showed that there is more to the Rapture
[1:34:37] than just having a
[1:34:41] revelation for the prophet said Enoch's
[1:34:43] whole body was
[1:34:46] transformed to meet a type on in God and
[1:34:52] he was taken to heaven
[1:34:54] without even seeing
[1:34:56] death can you say Amen so now what
[1:34:59] brings about this this transformation
[1:35:02] today well I I'll just say it this way
[1:35:04] the revealing of the son of
[1:35:07] man why it is the rising of the
[1:35:11] Sun the revealing of the son of man is
[1:35:14] the rising of sun go go listen to the
[1:35:17] the uh uh it is the rising of the sun go
[1:35:20] listen to that message and brother BR
[1:35:21] I'm going tell you what the message is
[1:35:22] all about it is the quickening power
[1:35:25] that has come in this day amen that is
[1:35:28] shining on vagabonds shining on poers
[1:35:32] shining on Misfits shining on people
[1:35:35] that ain't worthy but there's something
[1:35:38] down inside of them and it's changing
[1:35:41] them it is the rising of the
[1:35:46] sun and the prophet said he is the
[1:35:49] Dynamics to the mechanics you may not
[1:35:51] have the power within you but he's the
[1:35:53] Dynam
[1:35:55] Dynamics can you say Amen you may seem
[1:35:58] helpless a lot of times you look and say
[1:36:00] God how in the world I'm in this
[1:36:02] condition and I don't know how I'm going
[1:36:03] to get there but don't you worry the r
[1:36:06] sun has risen upon you arise Shine for
[1:36:10] thy light has
[1:36:14] come you see he's the quickening power
[1:36:17] to the predestinated seed and remember
[1:36:20] the sun has the power to Quicken the
[1:36:23] seed that was laying dormant in the
[1:36:27] ground ain't that right now notice
[1:36:31] brother Bron said but when the earth
[1:36:32] gets away amen from the Sun then
[1:36:35] everything starts to Die the winter sets
[1:36:38] in then it kills the fruit and the
[1:36:41] leaves die we know that we're facing a
[1:36:43] fall we know Winter's coming on what is
[1:36:46] it the Earth the world is getting away
[1:36:49] from the Sun and everything is dying
[1:36:51] starting to die we notice the leaves are
[1:36:54] starting to change we know this this is
[1:36:56] nature this is all about it ain't that
[1:36:58] right amen but we don't despair amen
[1:37:01] because we know the Earth is going to be
[1:37:03] pulled back again and the sun in its
[1:37:06] strength is going to bring everything
[1:37:09] back to life and what seems to be dead
[1:37:12] and hopeless and just nothing no future
[1:37:15] for it the sun would tell you different
[1:37:18] the sun knows amen because it's got
[1:37:21] power in itself to change amen the
[1:37:25] situation to bring from Death unto
[1:37:34] life so brother Braham said God's nature
[1:37:37] law of nature pulls the Earth around and
[1:37:39] makes that law of God in nature bring
[1:37:42] forth an Easter a resurrection see it's
[1:37:45] beautifully the return of the sun to
[1:37:49] restore what the winter killed while it
[1:37:51] was from the Earth God sends the Earth
[1:37:54] back around the Sun as we're told way
[1:37:57] back here see the Earth went away from
[1:37:59] the sun went back out here and now when
[1:38:02] the earth gets back around the seeds is
[1:38:05] laying in the ground they're frozen the
[1:38:08] pop has run out of them and everything
[1:38:11] is gone but there's a little life
[1:38:13] preserved and as soon as the sun gets
[1:38:16] back in position with the Earth again
[1:38:19] then there is an Easter a restoration of
[1:38:23] up comes the flowers again up comes
[1:38:26] everything all that the winter killed
[1:38:28] the sun restores all that Winter's death
[1:38:31] kills uh the son of life restores and I
[1:38:34] just got to tell you the son the S so n
[1:38:37] has returned uh in this we've got
[1:38:39] something to shout about you say oh but
[1:38:42] my children are lost oh but their son
[1:38:45] has risen again amen the power of Satan
[1:38:49] the power of sin is going to be broken
[1:38:57] it's time for
[1:39:01] Rapture you see if you notice at the
[1:39:05] time of rapture the cycle of death and
[1:39:07] Corruption is
[1:39:10] broken not just for one
[1:39:14] man but for all people out of every
[1:39:18] tongue Kindred and
[1:39:20] Nation those that are predestinated
[1:39:24] seed so both the dead in Christ who have
[1:39:28] risen and those who are alive and remain
[1:39:32] are going to be
[1:39:35] changed so it's not just a
[1:39:38] revelation it's a literal
[1:39:41] changing 1 Corinthians
[1:39:44] 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we
[1:39:46] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:39:48] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:39:50] an eye at the last Trump for the Trump
[1:39:52] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:39:54] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:39:57] for this corruptible must put on
[1:39:59] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[1:40:01] immortality so when this corruptible
[1:40:03] shall have put on incorruption this
[1:40:05] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[1:40:07] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:40:10] that is written death is swallowed up in
[1:40:13] Victory so the prophet explains it see
[1:40:15] You' be standing there and feel a change
[1:40:17] coming on the gray hair go out and the
[1:40:19] wrinkles Fall Away see be changed in a
[1:40:22] moment in a twinkling of an eye see and
[1:40:25] we shall meet our loved ones first well
[1:40:28] there's mama oh there's Papa oh there's
[1:40:31] my child there's my wife there's my
[1:40:34] husband amen see those that have gone on
[1:40:37] are going to race
[1:40:40] first can you say Amen oh Hallelujah he
[1:40:43] says we're ready and then together with
[1:40:46] him that we're dead says the scriptures
[1:40:48] will be caught up in the air to meet the
[1:40:50] Lord see that's the order of the coming
[1:40:53] see oh to see that old Daddy of Mine see
[1:40:56] them old loved ones that's went down in
[1:40:58] the faith Yonder to meet them see the
[1:41:00] sweetness of God knowing if we had met
[1:41:02] him first we'd Wonder well was mama in
[1:41:05] it was did did Mama finally make it we
[1:41:08] preached so hard we tried was she is she
[1:41:12] here is Uncle Joe here his brother here
[1:41:14] is is so and so here see oh Lord we love
[1:41:17] you we love you we love you see amen but
[1:41:20] first see amen we're going to meet one
[1:41:23] another so there will be no wondering
[1:41:26] about it we're all here we're all
[1:41:28] gathered together that's the wisdom of
[1:41:33] God ain't that nice about your
[1:41:36] [Applause]
[1:41:37] Lord that he would take care of your
[1:41:39] desires
[1:41:42] first that you would actually know who
[1:41:44] made it and you'd be gathered with your
[1:41:47] loved ones before you meet himall
[1:41:53] and the prophet says now we become part
[1:41:55] of that before that time comes catching
[1:41:58] up into the
[1:42:01] Rapture now we we know that Enoch was
[1:42:05] the seventh from Adam Prophet said he
[1:42:08] was the type of the church ages all rest
[1:42:11] of the six men before him died but Enoch
[1:42:14] was
[1:42:15] translated so now look at it and I hope
[1:42:19] this all right but the Rapture what is
[1:42:22] the rapture it's a way of
[1:42:27] Escape can you say Amen see just before
[1:42:30] the tribulation sits in the Rapture is
[1:42:33] going to take
[1:42:36] place this is why we believe that the
[1:42:38] finale of The Rapture is going to play
[1:42:41] take place just any day what's happening
[1:42:44] in the world is not by accident is the
[1:42:47] wrath of God
[1:42:49] approaching amen men are me people are
[1:42:52] losing their minds
[1:42:53] amen the devil is having his way with
[1:42:56] him trouble is in the land that ain't by
[1:43:00] accident this world is shaking this
[1:43:03] world is falling this world is crumbling
[1:43:07] but now we've got a hope there's a
[1:43:10] Rapture a way of
[1:43:12] Escape see God always provides a way of
[1:43:16] Escape for his children do you believe
[1:43:20] that God provided a way of escaping
[1:43:23] Noah's day there stood a prophet
[1:43:25] preaching a
[1:43:28] message and he provided an
[1:43:31] ark a way of Escape because trouble was
[1:43:35] coming can you say amen God provided a
[1:43:38] way of Escape at the first Exodus uh uh
[1:43:42] at the time of Passover there stood
[1:43:44] Moses the prophet with the message
[1:43:46] providing a token for those who wanted
[1:43:49] to escape the death that was coming
[1:43:53] amen today Hallelujah we have had a
[1:43:56] prophet
[1:43:57] stand with a
[1:44:00] message preparing the bride of Christ
[1:44:03] did you know the prophet said the bride
[1:44:05] of Christ is the ark for
[1:44:07] today the body of Christ is the ark get
[1:44:10] in the
[1:44:13] body can you say Amen but see what is it
[1:44:16] God doesn't leave his children to the
[1:44:18] hands of
[1:44:19] Destruction God's going to provide a way
[1:44:21] of Escape
[1:44:23] that's how much he loves
[1:44:27] us now if you notice he has given his
[1:44:30] own blood to
[1:44:32] us for a
[1:44:37] protection to where God doesn't even
[1:44:39] look at you as a
[1:44:40] sinner when he looks at you he sees his
[1:44:43] own
[1:44:44] blood he hears your
[1:44:46] voice but then he has given us
[1:44:52] angels in charge over
[1:44:56] us see God has provided a way of Escape
[1:44:59] for you and I Genesis
[1:45:02] 28:10 speaks of a dream that the prophet
[1:45:05] Jacob had Jacob went out from berseba
[1:45:09] and went toward Heron and and he lighted
[1:45:13] upon a certain place and carried there
[1:45:14] all night because the sun was set and he
[1:45:17] took of the stones of that place and put
[1:45:20] them for his pillars and laid down in
[1:45:22] that place asleep and he dreamed and
[1:45:25] behold a ladder was set upon the earth
[1:45:28] and the top of it reached to heaven and
[1:45:30] behold the angels of God ascending and
[1:45:33] descending on it now the prophet said
[1:45:36] see God was showing us that he would
[1:45:40] provide a way of Escape for his
[1:45:46] children he gave Jacob a dream of a
[1:45:49] ladder reaching from he from the Earth
[1:45:51] to the Heaven and the Prophet said
[1:45:53] that's our way of
[1:45:56] Escape it's symbolic of the church
[1:45:59] rising from Earth to Glory Church we're
[1:46:03] climbing
[1:46:04] upward we're marching up to
[1:46:08] [Music]
[1:46:10] Zion you see you don't have to stay in
[1:46:12] the muck and mire you don't have to stay
[1:46:15] Within These Earthbound
[1:46:17] rims God ain't going to leave you in
[1:46:19] this Earthbound mess
[1:46:23] can you say amen he has provided a way
[1:46:27] for us to leave this Earthbound sin and
[1:46:30] and the fil and and and all of these
[1:46:33] things the Earthly atmospheres and we
[1:46:35] can leave those things and come up
[1:46:38] higher into the fellowship with
[1:46:41] God you see you got to think of who you
[1:46:44] are you may have been born a sinner but
[1:46:47] that's not what God predestinated you to
[1:46:50] be can I tell you what we were
[1:46:52] predestinated to be we are predestinated
[1:46:54] to be without spot wrinkle or blemish we
[1:46:57] are predestinated to be conformed to the
[1:47:00] image of his dear son God has
[1:47:02] predestinated his church to the adoption
[1:47:05] of sons he has predestinated us to have
[1:47:08] an Incorruptible body he has
[1:47:10] predestinated us to live with him in
[1:47:13] that Eternal City we have been
[1:47:15] predestinated to rule and to reign with
[1:47:19] him and God has provided a way that we
[1:47:24] don't have to remain in this Earth real
[1:47:27] that we can go
[1:47:30] up going from sinner to
[1:47:33] Saint can you say Amen provided a way to
[1:47:38] where we could be
[1:47:40] transformed amen that word transformed
[1:47:43] is to change from one thing to another
[1:47:45] ain't that
[1:47:48] right so God has called us from the
[1:47:52] Earthly to the Heavenly amen going from
[1:47:55] being as the sand of the sea to the
[1:47:58] stars of the
[1:48:00] heaven now brother brandom in talking of
[1:48:02] this lad he says that God needed to
[1:48:05] establish his L ladder he's got his the
[1:48:08] ladder hooked up to the throne of God in
[1:48:10] heaven but he needed something to
[1:48:12] establish that ladder here on this Earth
[1:48:15] ain't that right see so he hooked it to
[1:48:18] the throne of God in heaven amen but on
[1:48:21] the earth he tried to hook it to the
[1:48:23] Jewish Nation but found out it didn't
[1:48:26] work he tried to hook it to Jacob it
[1:48:29] didn't work he tried to hook it see he
[1:48:31] couldn't hook it to Abraham who was a
[1:48:33] Shyer in a backslid and treated his wife
[1:48:36] the way he did he couldn't hook the
[1:48:38] ladder to that couldn't hook the ladder
[1:48:40] to David the adulterer can you say Amen
[1:48:44] but a prophet in the Old Testament amen
[1:48:46] cried out that there would be a stone
[1:48:49] amen that would be the Cornerstone it
[1:48:51] would be a precious Stone and God would
[1:48:54] establish that way of Escape upon him
[1:48:58] that you could be rest assured that you
[1:49:01] can make it it would be a tried Stone
[1:49:04] ain't that right if you notice what
[1:49:07] Jesus said in John
[1:49:09] 1:51 verily verily I say unto you
[1:49:11] Hereafter you shall see Heaven open and
[1:49:14] the angels of God ascending and
[1:49:18] descending upon the son of
[1:49:21] man hello
[1:49:23] so brother R said it is hooked to the
[1:49:25] throne of God and to the Heart of Jesus
[1:49:28] Christ and we're in
[1:49:30] between the ladder's hooked to the
[1:49:32] throne of God it established Upon Jesus
[1:49:36] Christ and we're in between and that's
[1:49:39] God's way of Escape for you and I he
[1:49:42] said see God don't want his ladder
[1:49:44] slipping around he tried to hook a
[1:49:46] covenant with Adam he broke it he hooked
[1:49:49] it to a covenant see but God made this
[1:49:52] Covenant unconditionally and he hooked
[1:49:54] it into Jesus Christ there it's anchored
[1:49:58] there's no slipping no sliding there's
[1:50:01] no way of getting away what is it it's
[1:50:04] hooked by God above and by the Son of
[1:50:07] God beneath and what is it it's a
[1:50:10] pathway it's a traveler's way from Earth
[1:50:14] to glory and you can't fail
[1:50:18] [Applause]
[1:50:23] somebody say I can't
[1:50:25] fail I think it's about time we tell the
[1:50:28] devil I can't fail he's had enough of
[1:50:32] his lies of telling us that we're
[1:50:34] failures we're going to come short we we
[1:50:36] ain't going to make it but young people
[1:50:39] you tell that devil I can't
[1:50:42] fail God provided a way of escaping this
[1:50:46] way isn't an iffy way it's a sure
[1:50:51] way now no notice what a prophet said
[1:50:54] we're caught we're caught between it

[1:53:35] might have said something different

[1:57:10] amen taking you amen and bringing you
[1:57:12] out of your troubles can you say amen
[1:57:15] that's right that's what a prophet said
[1:57:17] see the angels are here now people don't
[1:57:20] believe in miracles they don't believe
[1:57:21] in the super natural they don't believe
[1:57:23] Amen in in in angels and all that you
[1:57:26] know what brother brandham said this he
[1:57:28] said they're taking the church the
[1:57:30] Commandments the teaching of the Bible
[1:57:32] and explains it all away therefore you
[1:57:34] make the Commandments of God without any
[1:57:36] effect you make the promises of God of
[1:57:39] no effect see you take the word of God
[1:57:42] and you explain it all way into some
[1:57:44] sort of a Creed and then you cry where
[1:57:46] is the god of the
[1:57:49] Bible see you've explained him away you
[1:57:52] took it all away from the people when
[1:57:54] you tell them the days of Miracles has
[1:57:56] passed amen there's no such thing as the
[1:57:59] Holy Ghost there's no such thing as
[1:58:00] Divine Healing there's no such thing as
[1:58:02] a visitation of angels there's no such
[1:58:05] thing as Miracles and when you do that
[1:58:07] you explain all the supernatural away
[1:58:09] from the Bible you take God right out of
[1:58:11] the church when you do it by
[1:58:14] Tradition now if you take away the
[1:58:16] supernatural how you going to get a
[1:58:18] Rapture how you going to have a body
[1:58:20] change it's preacher you're Pastor even
[1:58:23] the prophet couldn't bring a body
[1:58:25] change but one thing you could do is
[1:58:28] preach a supernatural show the
[1:58:30] supernatural introduce the supernatural
[1:58:33] because that's what it's going to take
[1:58:34] for a
[1:58:37] Rapture you see this message I'm going
[1:58:40] to wind it down I hope this all right
[1:58:43] this message of Malachi 4 is of the
[1:58:45] supernatural can you say Amen now I
[1:58:48] believe we're at the top of the ladder
[1:58:53] amen I just believe that you see Enoch
[1:58:57] was raptured the prophet said the
[1:58:58] seventh showing that it's the seventh
[1:59:01] Church age that takes the Rapture and
[1:59:03] there's no doubt everybody say there's
[1:59:05] no doubt we're in the seventh Church age
[1:59:08] we all know it it's the seventh Church
[1:59:10] age that takes the Rapture see the end
[1:59:13] time bride will be called out the
[1:59:15] rapturing without death will be called
[1:59:17] out of the seventh Church age which we
[1:59:20] are bearing record of that age
[1:59:26] now can you say amen that's right see
[1:59:30] and he says that it's going to take more
[1:59:33] faith than
[1:59:34] ever for it has to be a rapturing faith
[1:59:38] but don't you
[1:59:39] worry come
[1:59:41] on the angels of God are here now
[1:59:45] brother Bram said see they're here with
[1:59:46] you to Bear you up to comfort you to
[1:59:51] give you you faith and to move you
[1:59:58] alone I know I I know that all you
[2:00:01] preachers have gotten to a place that
[2:00:04] you just want to
[2:00:06] quit and you just said I'm just going to
[2:00:08] quit I'm going to give up I ain't done
[2:00:10] it and you were just bound and
[2:00:13] determined
[2:00:15] on but what you don't know there was
[2:00:19] Angels pring you am you might have been
[2:00:23] crying shedding your tears you might
[2:00:25] have been rejected feeling lonely
[2:00:27] feeling like what's the use but there
[2:00:28] was an angel all alone prodding keep
[2:00:31] moving keep pressing can you say amen I
[2:00:36] know it's all we've all been through it
[2:00:37] I know that you parents and and you
[2:00:39] young people have been through it some
[2:00:41] time or another where you just Satan's
[2:00:43] got about got you convinced just to quit
[2:00:44] throwing in the towel you ain't doing no
[2:00:46] good you ain't getting anywhere amen you
[2:00:48] just keep doing this and this and your
[2:00:50] life's a mess amen and you just want to
[2:00:52] quit you just want to give up you don't
[2:00:54] see any value in your own life but all
[2:00:56] of a sudden there's
[2:00:59] Angels it's a supernatural world it's a
[2:01:02] supernatural Rim why there's a Rapture
[2:01:05] you were predestinated for a Rapture and
[2:01:08] God ain't going to leave you
[2:01:11] behind no matter how determined you are
[2:01:13] to quit there's an angel there that just
[2:01:16] pring you and you're still standing
[2:01:17] today you're still rejoicing I don't
[2:01:20] know how many tears you have cried but
[2:01:22] you're here by a supernatural Vindicated
[2:01:27] God see what is it it's the supernatural
[2:01:31] moving upon the
[2:01:34] natural now I I want to get to something
[2:01:37] right fast then I'm going to close the
[2:01:40] supernatural you remember you you
[2:01:43] remember when when the children of
[2:01:45] Israel they they they were dying because
[2:01:47] of snake bites you know and and they
[2:01:50] were perishing but God in his great love
[2:01:53] and mercy amen provided a way of escape
[2:01:57] and he had his Prophet to raise up put a
[2:02:00] Brazen serpent upon a pole and to raise
[2:02:03] that pole up high so that all that could
[2:02:06] look could live amen that's what the
[2:02:09] people were commanded to do just look
[2:02:12] and live well what was so special about
[2:02:15] that pole it was just natural it was
[2:02:17] just a Brazen serpent it was just
[2:02:19] something natural that was made by man
[2:02:21] but what what it was is the prophet said
[2:02:24] what made it so special there was a
[2:02:27] healing angel on that
[2:02:32] pole there was a healing Angel and all
[2:02:37] the people had to do was look and
[2:02:44] live you see there's been angels of
[2:02:47] healing that have been commissioned by
[2:02:49] God for us
[2:02:54] how did the people get healed at the
[2:02:56] pool of Bethesda it was just natural
[2:02:59] water but the prophet said there was a
[2:03:01] healing angel that come upon the
[2:03:05] waters oh my yes sir see it wasn't the
[2:03:09] natural that worked the miraculous it
[2:03:12] was the supernatural the prophet said it
[2:03:15] was the angel of
[2:03:17] Mercy it was the angel of healing that
[2:03:21] moved and dropped upon the waters for
[2:03:25] the people that were
[2:03:29] sick can you say amen and the prophet
[2:03:33] said the people had to get in it in
[2:03:35] order to get healed not run from
[2:03:40] it this isn't the time to run from the
[2:03:45] [Applause]
[2:03:48] message I don't care how sick you are I
[2:03:51] don't care how how discouraged you are I
[2:03:53] don't care how low you feel this isn't
[2:03:56] the time to run from
[2:03:58] it don't you let the devil talk you out
[2:04:01] of this
[2:04:09] message can you say
[2:04:12] Amen don't you let some unbeliever tell
[2:04:15] you that this is half inspired and half
[2:04:17] not
[2:04:18] inspired don't you get bothered by the
[2:04:20] fussing and the fighting of the
[2:04:22] preachers don't you get bothered by the
[2:04:24] fussing and the fighting of the people
[2:04:26] don't you get bothered by the by the
[2:04:28] intellectual giants that are trying to
[2:04:30] downplay this
[2:04:32] message this message is your
[2:04:35] life it's God's way of Escape for
[2:04:38] [Applause]
[2:04:42] you Church it isn't just a man that
[2:04:45] should stood there and start preaching
[2:04:47] these Mysteries I I I'll move on I'll
[2:04:50] show you brother Brown said today even
[2:04:52] now the Holy Spirit the supernatural
[2:04:54] power of God is in the Earth moving and
[2:04:56] showing things and people run from it
[2:04:59] instead of getting into it the word made
[2:05:01] flesh the very Vindicated see and
[2:05:03] Vindicated the very things that he did
[2:05:05] and promised that we would do is doing
[2:05:07] the same
[2:05:09] things now brother Bram said see notice
[2:05:12] it was the man that sit at the front
[2:05:14] waiting for the supernatural to move
[2:05:16] upon the waters that got something from
[2:05:18] God he believed in the Supernatural and
[2:05:20] was waiting for it and the minute he saw
[2:05:23] it moving he pressed to get
[2:05:27] in now what was it with the prophet of
[2:05:30] God in this day brother brandom said if
[2:05:32] you will look not at the man your
[2:05:34] brother but if you'll look to what I'm
[2:05:36] speaking about the Lord Jesus his
[2:05:38] healing Angel is at the
[2:05:41] platform I'm not God's Gift the angel is
[2:05:44] God's gift it came out of Heaven I came
[2:05:47] from the earth he came from Heaven down
[2:05:50] to in Shroud or to enclothed an Earthly
[2:05:52] vessel to speak to Earthly people you
[2:05:55] see see so that you would believe on him
[2:05:58] not me but upon Him of whom I'm talking
[2:06:01] about and by doing so God will heal
[2:06:07] youall see God's gift is the spirit of
[2:06:10] God that came down in the form of an
[2:06:13] Angel so it isn't a worship of a man it
[2:06:17] isn't that we're worshiping an angel
[2:06:22] we are looking at and believing in what
[2:06:26] the angel of the Lord has come upon in
[2:06:29] this last day now we're commanded to do
[2:06:32] that for Isaiah 45:22 God says look unto
[2:06:36] me and be ye saved all ye ends of the
[2:06:38] Earth for I God and there is none else
[2:06:41] so the prophet said God has sent his
[2:06:43] angel from glory to manifest to his
[2:06:47] people the prophetic gift which can only
[2:06:49] bring Faith up into the level to where
[2:06:51] you can be healed or accept your healing
[2:06:54] from
[2:06:55] Jesus can you say
[2:06:57] Amen yes sir God didn't send this
[2:07:01] message for you to dissect
[2:07:07] it God didn't send this message for
[2:07:09] preachers to fight
[2:07:12] about and to put their own intellect
[2:07:14] into it leave the message
[2:07:19] alone it don't need to be changed
[2:07:22] it don't need a
[2:07:24] facelift it's the very thing that if we
[2:07:27] could get the people to believe it they
[2:07:29] can receive their
[2:07:35] healing can you say Amen brother Bram
[2:07:38] and speaking of the poor third pool he
[2:07:40] said this will be the thing that will
[2:07:42] start the rapturing faith for the going
[2:07:46] away can you say Amen so in another
[2:07:49] place brother Bram said if you don't
[2:07:50] believe me that I told you the truth
[2:07:52] you'll never benefit by it you see why
[2:07:55] Satan is attacking this message you see
[2:07:57] why he's trying to water it down you see
[2:07:59] why he's raising up intellectual guys to
[2:08:02] preach their own thoughts and mix it all
[2:08:05] [Applause]
[2:08:07] up getting to where the people don't
[2:08:09] really don't understand what brother
[2:08:11] brandham said making a mystery out of
[2:08:13] something that God made
[2:08:15] [Music]
[2:08:16] [Applause]
[2:08:18] clear can you say Amen this message just
[2:08:21] a mystery it's the revelation of the
[2:08:24] mystery all you have to do is
[2:08:28] believe believe and if you can believe
[2:08:30] it you'll receive the
[2:08:35] benefits can you say
[2:08:37] Amen see this message is where the angel
[2:08:42] of the Lord is
[2:08:44] moving for the prophet said the angel of
[2:08:47] the Lord accompanies this message always
[2:08:51] amen hallelujah oh my do you love him
[2:08:56] isn't he
[2:08:57] wonderful amen see so notice brother
[2:09:02] brandom said see they waited at the
[2:09:03] Sheep gate from month to month for
[2:09:07] whatever it was for one for that one
[2:09:09] Supernatural moving but they looked for
[2:09:11] it they were looking for it and today
[2:09:14] we've lost that Vision Pentecost we've
[2:09:16] lost something let's look to Christ Our
[2:09:19] denominations has spread it tell it's
[2:09:22] went way out and now we're fighting and
[2:09:24] trying to get more and bigger churches
[2:09:27] and higher classes and better educated
[2:09:29] preachers and things and what have we
[2:09:31] got we've got away from the very thing
[2:09:33] that God told us to look at what are we
[2:09:35] looking at look and live that's what we
[2:09:37] must do if we expect to live others
[2:09:40] might laughed at them and and and said
[2:09:42] that bunch of Holy Rollers down there
[2:09:44] around that pool why there there why
[2:09:46] it's nothing it's just but wind the wind
[2:09:49] comes down and blows that water back
[2:09:51] there but not to them who were
[2:09:55] looking it was the angel of
[2:10:00] Mercy it was the angel of
[2:10:05] healing and today it's the angel of
[2:10:10] Mercy that's moving upon the
[2:10:12] waters moving upon this message do you
[2:10:16] believe it isn't the Lord
[2:10:20] wonderful you
[2:10:22] remember when God showed up to
[2:10:27] Abraham brother Braham said it was an
[2:10:29] angel of
[2:10:31] Mercy that appeared in human
[2:10:34] flesh and it showed he was an angel of
[2:10:37] Mercy because when he determined and he
[2:10:40] told Abraham what he was going to do
[2:10:42] Sarah laughed at it Sarah laughed in at
[2:10:46] the face of
[2:10:47] God and the prophet said God would have
[2:10:50] slayed her right th but he couldn't do
[2:10:53] it cuz she's tied to
[2:10:57] Abraham and God would Overlook her
[2:11:02] unbelief God overlooked her laughing at
[2:11:10] him Hallelujah and extended
[2:11:13] Mercy he remembered his promise over her
[2:11:18] actions it was an angel of Mercy come on
[2:11:23] that was standing there and not killed
[2:11:26] her that's but showed
[2:11:29] Mercy now Church
[2:11:32] Hallelujah that same God has come in
[2:11:34] this
[2:11:36] AG
[2:11:38] hallelujah
[2:11:40] hallelujah what it's been is not just a
[2:11:44] prophet but it's been an angel of Mercy
[2:11:47] standing with that Prophet Hallelujah
[2:11:52] why because before the foundation of the
[2:11:54] world God determined he was going to
[2:11:56] have a
[2:11:58] bride and he knew every one of your
[2:12:01] names and he wrote it in a Lamb's Book
[2:12:04] of Life closed that book up until the
[2:12:07] end
[2:12:09] time and here we are we've lived our
[2:12:12] life we've been caught up in Creeds and
[2:12:14] dogmas and all all of us have our own
[2:12:17] different Paths of life but God
[2:12:19] remembered his promise
[2:12:25] and when it came time he opened the
[2:12:28] book and he began to call the
[2:12:31] names in this age cuz he had already
[2:12:35] promised he was going to have a
[2:12:37] bride a people come out of the Gentiles
[2:12:39] for his name's sake can you say amen
[2:12:43] amen and out of all of our blunders come
[2:12:47] on now I don't know about you but
[2:12:49] sometimes we get discouraged
[2:12:52] and sometimes we doubt and sometimes we
[2:12:55] look at God and we say we just don't
[2:12:57] know how it's going to be I know you
[2:12:59] probably called me but I don't feel like
[2:13:01] it I'm not going to do it I I just
[2:13:03] whatever and and and sometimes we may
[2:13:06] even secretly and and unknowingly just
[2:13:08] laughed at God as how is it going to
[2:13:11] really happen but there has been an
[2:13:13] angel of Mercy in this age that
[2:13:16] overlooks our troubles that overlooks
[2:13:19] our doubts that overlooks our our
[2:13:21] incapabilities that Overlook everything
[2:13:24] about us and it's extending Mercy in
[2:13:27] this age and all I can say this message
[2:13:29] is not a message of law it's not a
[2:13:32] message of condemnation it is a message
[2:13:35] of Grace and that angel is here to heal
[2:13:39] you physically heal you mentally heal
[2:13:41] you fi uh spiritually and to heal you
[2:13:45] for a
[2:13:46] Rapture can you lift your hands unto the
[2:13:49] Lord if the musicians will come
[2:13:52] oh do you love him hallelujah hallelujah
[2:13:55] hallelujah think of the think of the
[2:13:58] message of this hour amen something that
[2:14:01] is greater than even
[2:14:05] you for the prophet said you
[2:14:08] are the
[2:14:11] sinless
[2:14:13] Spotless
[2:14:15] bride of Jesus Christ
[2:14:20] me in all my failures
[2:14:23] hallu but you don't know who's
[2:14:26] speaking it wasn't a
[2:14:28] man it was the angel of Mercy moving
[2:14:31] upon the
[2:14:33] waters an angel of Mercy enshrouding a
[2:14:36] prophet and he began to speak through
[2:14:39] that mortal lip and tell you you was
[2:14:42] always
[2:14:43] saved you not saved on any given day you
[2:14:47] were always saved you were Justified
[2:14:51] as though you had never did it remember
[2:14:54] what he said about
[2:14:55] Justified he said you know if Perry
[2:14:57] green he said you know you you could
[2:14:59] take it and and and and and maybe
[2:15:02] brother Joel you was out drinking and
[2:15:04] all that and you repented and we hear
[2:15:07] about it and and all that and and and
[2:15:09] you know we we we you know we we say
[2:15:12] well we forgive you you know well that
[2:15:14] that's fine but that don't mean you're
[2:15:16] Justified because you've done it you're
[2:15:18] forgiven you're forgiven thank God for
[2:15:20] that amen he's forgiven cuz he repented
[2:15:23] and all that see but that don't mean
[2:15:25] he's
[2:15:26] Justified amen see but when Justified is
[2:15:30] is that maybe I heard that he went and
[2:15:33] got got got drunk amen and I heard this
[2:15:36] and so I go to him I said oh brother
[2:15:38] Joel I I you know what I I I know you
[2:15:41] shouldn't have got drunk I I know I mean
[2:15:43] I I kind of figured you know that you
[2:15:45] might have done that silly as you are no
[2:15:48] but you know I I want to just let you
[2:15:50] know I forgive you for getting drunk and
[2:15:53] and but he he could tell me and say but
[2:15:56] I never did it I I I didn't get drunk
[2:16:00] you understand what I'm saying it it's
[2:16:02] not that he could accept my forgiveness
[2:16:04] he don't need to ex he's never done it
[2:16:08] his slate is
[2:16:12] clean can you say Amen so you're not
[2:16:15] just Justified I'm not justified in your
[2:16:19] eyes you're not justified in my
[2:16:25] eyes where we stand Justified is in his
[2:16:28] eyes we never done it in the first
[2:16:34] place so when he says you're the sinless
[2:16:37] Spotless bride he's not saying that to
[2:16:39] make you feel
[2:16:41] good he's saying it because there's
[2:16:44] nothing held against you you never did
[2:16:48] it Hallelujah
