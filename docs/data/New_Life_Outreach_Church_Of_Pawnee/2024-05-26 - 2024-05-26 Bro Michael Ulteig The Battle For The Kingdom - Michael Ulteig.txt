alone every breath that I take every moment I'm aake have your way in me Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul I for you every bre [Music] I sounds like we got some [Music] Thunder praise the lord it's good to see everybody nervous as a is it not working brother W puts it over here like this it helps well is that better well I'm nervous just about as nervous as a young man was up here but it's good to be in the house of the Lord it's good to be here in Pon e this is the this is the God's provided place and when all the storms and the tornadoes and everything comes through here it seems like we got a little Haven of Rest right here and get protected so uh it's kind of like being in Goan so we know that that we're protected and it's not not just necessarily by the way the land lays and the rivers flow and the hills are but we believe it's God's over us am I just want to thank brother Wendell for inviting me here to to deliver my heart and um I'll have to keep the advice of my wife on the frontlets of my brain don't try to tell them everything you know in one service so uh we're going to try to hold things down that's what she used to tell me when I'd go out she'd say now Michael she said you don't have to tell them everything you know in in one service so I was explaining to some it's kind of hard especially for a a pastor or Minister that's been preaching on on a series and then you got things spread out and then when you try to condense it into to one service it uh it gets kind of mind rcking and because it's like chewing on a piece of gristle it just at first it's just so nice and then the more you get your notes together the more it starts scattering out and then you get scattered out and then you get nervous and then you feel like crying and then you feel like saying we ain't coming so we just have to look to the Lord and depend on him just like we do in our daily lives the same faith that it takes for you to rise up in the morning and face the challenges of the hours the same faith it takes to come to a Pulpit and deliver your heart that's right so we just pray that that God will be with us this morning and we pray that the I think the wedding is today isn't iter yesterday so they're over the hump and today is a day of Celebration and and they can relax and uh we just thank God for for men and women that are willing to face the challenge of marriage and not like the rest of the world just going out there and living haphazardly and no responsibility that's right but God has given us a gift that's right of marriage and the gift of marriage is is the children that we have so we thank God for that God wanted children we want children Satan's you know he wants children but in this world it seems like they just don't have time for for babies they want children but they they want them at the age that they want them they don't want to go through the through the trials and tribulation of raising children but it's part of the victory we have and it's what they need in life is is parents God designed a family to have a mother and a father and mother and father were designed to have children because God wanted to be a father and God is also our mother elhadi and he wanted children and he wanted to raise the children he just didn't want to have children and set them out so we are the children this morning and we're we're the apple of his eye that's right and I read in the scriptures and remember when brother Brandon was talking about the young eaglets they were playing down there in the in the valley in the field mama was perched up high and and keeping their eye on them and you know they could they could look down there on the ground and See Your Shadow and that's comforting for you and I to dwell in his Shadows but then one day I was I was reading in the Psalms and David talked about that great mother eagle and he talked about feeling the feathers come on so we don't want just a shadow experience that's a good experience because that brings us to the to the knowledge of his presence and that he is a living God in the present help in the time of trouble but the feather experience that's when he grabs you out of the nest carries you up dumps you out in the land of nowhere and while you're flopping and falling at at the speed of sound almost great mother Eagle comes down faster than the speed of sound and and catches you and then you and you just grab onto their feathers and the next thing you know he dumps you again but listen it brings you to the reality of the presence of a living God and that's what we want this morning we want to live in his shadow but listen we want that feather experience we want to to have communion with him and to know him in the reality of life [Music] so as we uh would open our scriptures this morning I want to to start in uh St John uh chapter 18 and in St John chapter 18 uh verse 33 and I want to title us this morning the battle for the kingdom it's not a battle for a kingdom but it's the battle for the kingdom we're talking about one Kingdom we're talking about a battle so in St John chapter 8 18 and verse 33 then pilate entered into the Judgment into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the Jews Jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me and pilate answered am I a Jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what thou what H has thou done and Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my subjects fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence and pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness onto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice and pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews and saith unto them I find in him no fault at all may we just bow our heads Lord Jesus we just thank you this morning for your mercies and Grace and Lord Lord as we've assembled ourselves together without you we can do nothing but through you Lord we are more than conquerors this morning and Lord anything that we can do without you is nothing but your word promises that where two or three are gathered together in your name you would be in our midst so Lord you are the center of our gathering this morning may you anoint us and Inspire us father that we might know and understand your way lead us and guide us this morning take preeminence and all of our hearts anoint our ears anoint our lips Lord that we might speak the things that You' have to speak to your children this morning to increase their faith to meet the challenge of the day that we live in for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated so Jesus the main thing that I'm drawing from this from this scripture here is in verse uh 36 my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servant fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence and I just want to read this over in the Amplified and it uh reads uh just a little bit different but he says if my kingdom were of this world my followers would have been fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews but as it is my kingdom is not from here this world it has no such uh origin or source so uh what prompted me to to start this I preached it at home I guess in about three three different services that in looking uh reading the news of what's taking place around us that there were there were uh three words that had come up that uh caught my attention and uh one newsman was was talking about uh Trump and and uh worried about him coming in to uh to be the president he said if if uh Trump comes in he said the United States will be under a theocracy and I thought that was kind of interesting because if you look at Revelation 13 that when it comes down to the mark of the beast and you can't buy or sell that we find that that the world is under a a theocracy so when I looked up this uh this terminology of theocracy theocracy is a government of a state by immediate Divine guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided a state governed by a theocracy so when when Rome uh ruled over Europe a civilized uh world at that time that it was a theocracy because you had a civil government but then you also had the Roman uh the Roman Catholic Church was the was the religion that that controlled and drove the uh countries in Europe at that time so a theocracy is the combination between civil and ecclesiastical powers and they they claim to be uh divinely inspired to run the government and that's what happens under the mark of the beast that's what happened in the times of nimrod he built a city and a tower so the city represented uh civil power represented civilization and the tower represented religion so it was a union between religion and politics or civil powers and ecclesiastical Powers that's a theocracy all civilizations before Jesus Christ were theocracies uh you take the the American Indian it's really a theocracy because you have the chief and you have the witch doctor and we know that the witch doctor is the one that really controls the the tribe because he controls it through religion or we would call it Superstition right so then there's a there's a a union there's a coming together between the chief and between the witch doctor and that's a a theocracy is we're speaking of it and so in under a theocracy it's really not Faith it's obedience and it's participation when it comes time that there's a drought and they're going to have the rain dance it's not whether you believe it's something that they do it's a it's a tradition uh and so when they gather together the whole tribe gathers together because they all participate in that in that ceremony uh that they believe that's going to bring rain and if somebody doesn't attend they they feel that that's offensive to the god or to the power that they're worshiping to bring rain and so under a a theocracy it's not really Faith so much much it's it's obedience and its participation uh it kind of reminds me a little bit that when you say when we used to go to ball games and everybody would gather together and the first thing that we would do is they'd play the national anthem and raise the flag and everybody would stand with their hand over their heart or they'd salute and if you saw somebody standing there with their hands down at their side you say like oh what oh you know it was odd it was oh they're not patriotic they don't love the country you know it's just it's because that's the way we've been raised and that's the way it is in a in a theocracy or what they would call a sacral society and so that when uh somebody doesn't participate it's a threat to the unity and so then if that person is not brought in into Unity then there comes a a judgment and an excommunication or capital punishment that's right even Israel was a theocracy because you had the king you had the prophet you had the priests and when you were born you was 8 days old you were circumcised so you were part of the abrahamic Covenant yeah and you it wasn't your faith it was tradition it was what God had required of man that's right and so it was a theocracy not a pagan theocracy but it was a theocracy but when it came to Christ Christ began to preach something and teach something that was completely different than what had ever been in the world before because up at that time all societies were what you would call monolithic everybody believed the same thing thing everybody believed to the belonged to the church look at uh Nimrod he built a tower he built a city there we have a theocracy and he was conquering all the nations around him and bringing brother Brown said into one Federation it was to be a World Federation and so it wasn't a matter of faith it was a matter of of obedience it was a matter of participation uh when it came to Nimrod or uh Nebuchadnezzar we find it it was a theocracy and so then when they captured the Jews it looked like it was a freedom of religion because the Jews were allowed to live together in their in their uh uh tribal Unity uh we would say in their housing areas or in their communities they were allowed to live together and that's when they began the synagogues and uh they would come together and they would study the word they would study the Bible they believed in Jehovah God and there was no problem with Nebuchadnezzar uh the problem came was when the image was built and now everybody was required to bow to image yeah that's a theocracy that it's not a matter of Faith it's not matter whether you believe in that Idol or for that God it's a matter of where everybody bows and you look around and you see a Unity God has a plan Satan has a plan God's plan is to unify man under him under his headship but his plan was that we were to be born again amen that it was to be a a Unity of Faith but now Satan he has a plan and his plan is to unify people under him but his plan is under a theocracy he demands unity and so as long as people participate there's no problem when it came to the Roman Empire when it came down to the to the foot of the image when it came down to the the last manifestation of the Gentile Nations that we find that that there was a uh there was a Roman Empire and young Christianity and under young Christianity we're talking about now 325 ad so we're we're almost 300 years into the church it's just barely 300 years old not really 300 but but close to 300 years old and so we find that in 53 ad that was was the beginning of the false Vine manifestation amongst the church we had 20 years of pure Church from uh 33 ad to 20 uh to 53 ad 20 years and the church was kept clean when anasis and Safa came that the Holy Spirit called that sin out yeah and so the church was kept pure we find it that when that happened there was those uh it's hard to imagine this but there was those that knew that God was with these Christians with these Believers with the people of the book yeah and so they were afraid to join themselves to them because they knew if they join themselves to them and they didn't confess their sins their sins would be called out and so it said they dared not they dur not join themselves to the church even though they knew that God was with them so we had 20 years of pure church but then in 53 ad the false Vine began to manifest itself it was there but now it's coming to a manifestation so by the time we get to 325 ad now the false Vine had begin to uh begin to gain territory against the True Vine that's right uh they begin to organize they begin to formalize and what caused this was that they were trying to protect the truth brother Brandon in the church ages said Satan whispered in their ears and says now you have the truth you've got to protect it it was the same thing that Peter did Peter when when he was talking to the Lord they came down off Mount Transfiguration they're walking along the road Jesus begins talking to him and he starts talking about how that he's going to be arrested how he's going to be mistreated how he's going to be crucified and and Peter's listening and he hears that and he says oh no we're not going to let them do that to you Peter loved Jesus he would have give his life for him he already said I I'd give my life for you but you know uh sometimes what we seek or what we want to do for the Lord is not bad but it's the way that we do it that it becomes bad our good intentions our good desires they're good but they become bad in the way that we want to do it and so Peter uh I have to think that his his brain lock down or you know in some Services you'll come out and and either the husband or the wife will say well did you hear that and he said so and so he said I didn't hear that you have to go back to the tape it was that moment that your mind drifted or you just didn't catch it you know and you go back and sure enough there it is and so Peter I always say his brain must have locked down when Jesus said and I'll raise on the third day he never did hear that he he just said oh no uh I'm going to protect you and his business was not to protect the word his business was to be under the word but now watch the disciple the student now becomes the teacher he pulls him aside and he begins to upgrade him now here he is he's the student right he's the disciple but now he's going to tell Jesus Oh no you're not going to do that we're not going to let you do that and he says Get Behind Me Satan thou savest not the things of God but the things of man so what he what he's doing is he's out of his own love for Christ out of his own love he begins to exercise his ability driven by his ambition and now he's going to protect him but in doing that he's standing right in the middle of the way of the Divine will of God and so the inspiration is coming from Satan it's Satan pushing him now into this carnal mind and Jesus said if a man seeks to save his life he'll lose it but if he loses it for my sake he'll find eternal life Hallelujah that's an interesting statement because if we seek to save something many times we'll end up losing it so like a man or a woman they they come to church and one of them gets saved one of them they're touched in their heart by the gospel they're moved on by the Holy Spirit and they give their life and dedicate their life to the gospel and they start coming to the church but the other partner is not touched by the gospel and they said well I'm not going to church and if you keep going to church uh we're done that's it and so the one that's been touched by the Lord many times they'll make a compromise and they say okay well I'll just stay at home if you seek to save your marriage by your human ability driven by your ambition to cons to keep the marriage in a Unity you'll lose it that's right but if you seek Christ he's the one that's going to keep the marriage together that's right many times as human beings our human love fails one another we just get to that place and we're just like they say kicking KS down the road and we'll say I don't know I guess I guess I don't know I don't know why I ever married him or her you know I just but if Christ is in our heart he takes up that insufficiency that's right because he's the tie poost he ties you to the word and the word ties you to that Union so if a man seeks to save his life and he does it by human ambition and human ability he'll lose it that's right but if he seeks the kingdom then all things will be given on to him that he has need of and that's an interesting verse because it shows up again in Luke 17:30 where it says as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the days when the son of man is revealed and then he says uh I'll take one leave one so we know it's at the time of the Rapture and it says remember Lot's wife that's right if a man seeks to save his life he'll lose it but if he loses it for my sake he'll find eternal life isn't that something so that scripture is a predominant scripture it's an important scripture for the day that you and I are living in because many people will seek to save their life save their job save their marriage or save it outside of the word human human ability and human ambition and the carnal mind is death yeah and the carnal mind we don't get away from the carnal mind the carnal mind is reasoning it's emotion it's memory but down in here there is the mind of Christ that brings this mind subject to the word of God in faith in God living in his shadows and carried up into the heavens and his feathers and if he drops you if you got a bad day if it's a dark time listen he can fly faster than you can drop and you won't hit the bottom and he'll catch you and lift you back up and those are times that we have to trust in him and to know him as a mother Eagle that she'll not forget her young that's right so the then uh it's not it's not uh what you seek remember Israel in Romans 9 the last part of Romans 9 and the first part of Romans 10 that Israel was seeking the righteousness of God now that's not bad they were seeking righteousness yeah that was good there's many people that's seeking the Holy Spirit there's people that's seeking salvation people seeking justification sanctification those things are not bad they were seeking righteousness but the scripture says they sought it not by faith but by the works of the law by the law they sought it so what they sought was not bad but how they sought it was bad amen they never found it and by not finding God's perfect will by not finding God's righteousness it forces man to set up his own righteousness that's right he'll come to a place that he sets up his own righteousness his own Holy Spirit experience his own Holy Spirit way of receiving life and it becomes a church denomination it becomes uh a comparison of one's person's experience to the other whether they got it or whether they don't have it but God has a divine order when he sent the Mana in in uh Deuteronomy chapter 8 the scripture says that he sent the Mana and there was two purposes for the Mana number one the Mana was sent for nutritional value to keep them alive everything they had need of for nutritional value for health for their immune system for their eyes for their hair they didn't have to take different vitamins or search the vitam and book and say do I need c do I need B12 but that Mana was everything that they had need of for perfect kidneys it was it was heart friendly it didn't bring sugar diabetes it it was everything that they had was in there was for nutritional value and God created it it was created in heaven so the Mana was divine in origin its origin was divine he created that right but there was there was placed in the Mana a law it was a law of corruption and you would think if God created bread why it would never Meo it would never mold it would never go bad I mean Divine bread but it was designed that it would if it wasn't picked up at the right time of the day if it wasn't picked up uh in the morning if you went out there an hour after the time that you were supposed to go it melted it wasn't anything there and if he said you just pick up enough for one day for the whole family and that's all you pick up don't pick up any extra you're not going to St it for tomorrow don't do that and somebody says well you know this is the first time I've ever experienced this and I don't know if he's going to send any tomorrow so I'm going to just in case I'm going to save up a little bit for tomorrow and so when he did that it spoiled and got worms and turned rotten and it was divine in origin right but it said he sent the Mana to teach them that they should live by every word of God Amen so it was sent to be a nutritional value and it was uh sent for Spiritual instruction that's right and so Moses it came to a time that Israel must have been preaching that Moses had given them the Mana and Jesus said Moses didn't give you the Mana God gave you the Mana but Moses being the prophet had the instructions for the Mana he's the one that told him said now you're going to have to get it between 8 and 10 in the morning and and some of you I know you don't like to get up early and some of you just don't like to go out and get your own breakfast but if you don't do that um you're not going to eat because everybody else is just getting enough for themselves it's kind of like the oil they had just enough for themselves they didn't have enough to give to everybody else it's an individual Affair the Mana was an individual Family Affair at that time yeah right just enough to eat for that day so the instruction was to listen to the word of God and be obedient to the word of God and the Mana would be of a nutritional value to you but if you don't listen to the word of God and you decide to do your own schedule then you're going to starve and that's why that God designed it it seemed like it was designed with a flaw but that flaw was to match the word of God for the instructions of God Amen it was to be in a harmony with the prophetical word of God so then you know how sometimes it is in the church you know and so you get used to the rules and everything as it was and then all of a sudden the pastor changes the rule and now he says oh he says now today is Saturday he said now I want you to gather enough for tomorrow when you go out today get it for two days and of course the grumbler you know he'll say I can't believe this he's been telling us we can only get it for one day and now he's telling us we got to get it for two days I wish he'd make up his mind what he wanted you know but he's just getting his instructions from God right and they said well I'm just going to stay with the original I am not going to gather up two days worth I'm going to get up in the morning because this is what God Said and this is what I'm going to do come on so they got up the next morning and they went out like they always did and lo and behold there wasn't any Mana can you imagine that so we must listen to the word of God and we must do things in divine order that's right David David wanted to bring the ark the Throne of God which represented the word of God and the presence of God in that day he wanted to bring it to the center of Mount Zion that was where David's house was that's where the government was it wasn't where the church was it was where David's Throne was and David wanted to bring God to the midst of the people he wanted he wanted he wanted Israel to know a living God he knew the living God he had had the experience with the lion and the bear he had had the experience with Goliath he knew the presence of God he knew the Deliverance of God and he wanted Israel he wanted the church to know the Deliverance of a mighty God a present God a living God my soul thirsts for God for a living God not not just go to church and sing songs and and but to have communion with him that's a living God to speak to him and he speaks back to have communion and that God has ordained it that every person in here is to have a personal experience with God have a personal supply of Mana given to you by God through the Holy Spirit but God has a divine order amen that we assemble ourselves and some say well I don't need that I just stay at home that's not the divine order come on God said where two or three are gathered together that's the church so people say well honey you and me we're going to gather together and here's the church we don't need to go to Pony we don't need to go to brother Wendell's church or brother so and so's church or this church and then Paul turns around and says don't forsake the Assembly of yourself he's not talking about home Church come on he's talking about a body Ministry and when a person uh individuals they don't need the body of Christ they can live on their own I got my own Holy Ghost God called me God saved me God's going to deliver me that is not the divine order that the scriptures set up amen you will die in a desert place as a hermit amen God didn't call us to be Hermits he didn't call brother brandham to be a Hermit he wanted to be a Hermit he got frustrated with all the darkness and all the confusion and all the um Rebellion that was among them he wanted to go up in a mountain someplace and fish and hunt and just live in the presence of God and enjoy that and then come down when he had thus sayith the Lord deliver a message and go back up into that Utopia he said you do that and you'll be a bum because I've not called you that way listen God ain't called us that way you know some of us like to meditate a lot we like to read a lot other people like to talk a lot we're all different but when it comes to the word of God it doesn't make any different how different we are in our personalities and our makeup we're not we're not robots we're not put into a form we're not put into a mold we're all different but down in that Soul we're all the same where're the attributes of God it's the Living Word of God and it lives by the word of God and what Satan wants to do is push you out to away from the word of God to use your own human ability and your own Ambitions that's good and your desire can be good David's desire was good there was nothing wrong with his desire right but what it was was the way that he was wanting to bring the ark and so when he brought the ark they stumbled and when it stumbled an innocent man went to protect the word and he put his hand to that and it was judgment listen his intentions was good he didn't want the ark falling in the mud in a pit he didn't want it down here in the dirt in the dust and he and he and he put it forth to save it but that was not God's divine order so it's not good intentions those things can be good but the way that we do something and David was the cause of that because he was out of order and it caused another man to get out of water kind of reminds me when you'd see these uh bands at halftime and there was always this one guy it was a it was a an act but he was always trying to find his place he was out there used either one of those tubas or else he had a drum and he'd be bumping into people trying to find his place you know and when he finally got it everything was in order and everybody was marching uniform and sometimes people are trying to find their place and bumping in you know you can cause somebody to fall you can cause somebody to trip up cause somebody to get out of their position so we all want to be in our position that we're all marching according to the order of of the majorette come on the man or the woman that's up there with the Baton that's saying Left Right forward stop and playing according to the music all right but when David found when David found God's divine order when he found his divine order and he got in his divine order that he found that it was to be carried over the hearts of the Levites so then they called the Levites everybody got prepared and the Levites took the staff and it probably looked different to the world it didn't look right because everybody had that staff over their heart on their left shoulder the ones on the right had it on their left shoulder the ones on the left had it on their left shoulder uh the world might have said no no that ain't the way you do it uh those that's on the left you put it on your right shoulder and the ones on the right put it on your left shoulder and that way it'll be symmetric and everything will look balanced and that don't look right everybody carrying it but God's word said everybody carry it over their heart whether it's left right center he arranges it in a place that you can fulfill that word there's a space for you to get in in God's divine order that you can place that on your left shoulder over your heart the word is not to be carried in our heads it's to be carried over our and in our hearts that's where God designed it to be that's the resting place of his word listen I can read I can memorize this I can put it all in my brain but God don't want it in my brain he wants it in my heart it's a book of redemption and when the word comes it's a living experience it's a living word so there has to be Deliverance not of the brain not a Reformation it has to be the Deliverance of the soul of man that God comes in and dwells in his people amen amen so I was looking at these words theocracy I said now that's kind of interesting and you notice how religious that Trump is getting he was religious the last time he was in office right and and now he's even more religious than what he is so there was another name that they brought up Christian nationalism and I thought Christian nationalism I never heard of that what is that and so I looked it up and Christian nationalism is a movement amongst the people to try to preserve America as a Christian Nation they said our Founders were Christians the Constitution is based on Christian precepts on the Bible and we the early people the early Patriots they were Christians as a majority and so our constitution one nation under God indivisible and so we find all men were created equal it's scriptural so they want to preserve America as a Christian Nation they see them taking prayer out of school they want prayer back in school that's nothing wrong they they see what America is turning their back on God and they're wanting to preserve America as a Christian Nation there was another word that came up it was called uh Christian Liberty party and I thought Christian Liberty party and I found that when I was looking up Christian nationalism it's a political party and it's interesting because there's some uh senators and representatives that's already in our government that belongs to this uh Christian uh Liberty party and it has the same Concepts to preserve America as a Christian Nation that uh you look at the people that's running for office and those people that claim to be Christians that's who you vote for you vote to put Christians in there and their desire is to get Christians a Christian president Christian Senate Christian representative and God Jesus Christ is going to be the head of this nation I went to some meetings like that about eight years ago and uh my doctor had invited me to come to some of their meetings and I don't know if it was the same name but that's what they were out for they said Matthew 28:19 were to go out and convert the Nations so they wanted to convert governments into Christianity and I said after about two meetings I said well uh uh you're trying to save these governments and convert them over to Christianity and I said uh my Bible says they're going to be burned off and he says oh he says you're a premist aren't you and it's kind of like they write you down and they put you over in the in the Box you know under the catalog and and then that's the end of it so their desire is to make America a Christian Nation you know when you make America a Christian Nation now you're going to have to now you have an established religion and the first amendment is what stop that because that's what we had over in Europe at the time that America was discovered all Europe all of Europe was under the the Roman Catholic church or the Protestant churches and all the Protestant churches had gone to a theocracy Luther Calvin West all of them they had gone to a state church and the state church was set up just like the Catholic church under Luther brother Brown said he uh how did he say that he just um his judgment went bad and so then Luther wanted a a true um godall Living Church but after a while because of the pressure of the Catholic church and their natural powers and the Nations they controlled that he he went to the princes of the nation of of of um Germany and there they made Lu ISM became the state religion and brother brandham said he chose the state to be the defender of the faith instead of God and so then it was the same uh theocracy that when your children when you had children you had to bring your child to the church and they had to be baptized and when you were baptized or sprinkled then you were in the church and that's what the Catholic Church teaches they only substituted sprinkling children or infants for circumcision that made it a theocracy it wasn't a matter of faith it was a matter of obedience and participation if you didn't bring your children down then the church would note that you know uh so and so they just had a little baby boy they haven't brought that baby in yet to be sprinkled because these people believed that a person was to be baptized on the basis of a confession and receiving Jesus Christ as their savior so they didn't believe in infant baptism but according to the Lutheran Church the state Church you had to bring your children in because everybody that sprinkled is part of the church and the church is a nation a Christian Nation the problem is God has not called a nation he called Israel as a nation in the Old Testament but in the New Testament he's building a church a people a body individuals and it's based upon the confession of Faith it's not based upon uh obedience it's not based upon participation it's based upon faith in God in his word in his Plan of Redemption and so all of Europe was under the red dragon and so there was a an exodus the escaped ones in the Lutheran age and they came over to America and brother Brenham said God had provided a place in the wilderness for the woman that the dragon was after that's that's Revelation 12:6 he said when they came to America what was it he said A wilderness so America became the sanctuary for the woman the Trine religious freedom when you study it they were already starting to set up the old world in the new world they were setting up the Anglican church and where the Anglican Church was in Virginia that everybody had to go to church so many times a week and if you didn't go to church then you were penalized uh they took away your food and then the next time they took away your property the next time you were excommunicated if there was another time it was capital punishment so the old world was being set up in a new world the Puritans the pilgrims the anglicans all the old system was being set up in the colonies so when it came time for the Constitution they there was two there was two colonies it was Pennsylvania and I believe it was Rhode Island Roger Williams was in Rhode Island and William Pinn was in Pennsylvania and they said we believe that people ought to have the freedom of religion to go to church wherever you want to go to church they have faith however you want to Fai and if you don't want to go to church you don't have to go to church and everybody has the same legal rights they're all protected by our laws regardless of what their religious affiliation is and they were the two colonies that prospered above all the other colonies and so when it came to the Constitution it was the first amendment that stopped the dragon she had already set her Roots under of what we call denominations but it stopped him from being empowered in having an established religion and so there was a San uary and America became the light of the world and from America the freedom of religion was spread over the world and influenced many nations and that was all inspired by the Gospel of Jesus Christ that the wheat and tears would live together it was what they call a composite Society you might go to a Lutheran Church and this one might go to a Catholic Church this one don't go to church at all but we all work at the same Factory and in a Harmony under a theocracy you can't do that everybody has to go to church at the same Temple you have to worship the same God it's not based on faith it's based on obedience that's where the Christians ran into problems during the Roman Empire because they believed in one God and Rome believed all the gods they had a catalog of gods Every Nation they conquered they put them in a catalog they built temples for them and so it made it easier for those conquered Nations to come under the civil law of the Roman Empire they didn't care what you believe but the but the Christians couldn't be put on that catalog because rule number one is you can't worship any God except he be in the catalog number two your God can't displace any God in our catalog it might be your favorite God but you have to recognize all the other gods well when it came to a Christian there's one God so then God couldn't be put in the catalog CU if he did all the other gods had to be emptied out so then they had to Worship in secret and at night they had to hide in the catacombs and different places to be able to assemble now can you imagine 300 years of persecution 300 years of meeting in in silence and hiding watches to see if in you but he's following you and persecutions and now Constantine stands up and he says no more persecution of the Christians can you imagine I'm talking about 300 years we're talking about more than one generation we're talking about three maybe four generations a persecution being burnt uh fed to the lines all what we read in the fox's book of Martyrs and now Constantine stands up and he stops it let me read something this is this is from this is from 2016 things Trump said they say where is he going we got a movement and Trump has joined in with this uh Christian Liberty party he's he's embraced this Christian nationalism because he's wanting to make America a Christian Nation now it sounds good it ain't no different than when Peter said said oh no we're not going to let them kill you you're not going to be they're they're not going to torment you it's the same when David said what do you think men should we bring God into the presence of of Jerusalem should we bring his throne do we want God yeah amen praise the Lord but it was the method it was how that he was going to do that and so they're want to establish the kingdom of God in America but the kingdom of God is a body it's a church that Christ is building it's not a nation the New Testament is not calling Nations it's not calling governments listen they belong to the Devil he's the one that's inspiring he's the one that's over them this is what he said Trump is going to change the law back that Christian companies will not have to supply insurance for abortions he's going to put Merry Christmas back in the department store putting Christ back into Christmas he was also slamming people who didn't say Merry Christmas so you can see how Something Good Can all of a sudden start becoming bad because it's participation it's it's not it's not worship in Christ but it's participation if you don't say Merry Christmas oh you're not a Christian huh you know I've had people say that at work they say well you getting a bunch of gifts in a tree now and I say no and I say we don't worship Christmas like you do he well I thought you was a Christian because it's the way that people assimilate to tradition and what's been brought into America as what Christianity is Christianity is the body of Christ that's what the argument was during the Reformation it was a it was a national church but the True Vine believed that it was those that had repented and accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior and was baptized and were born into the kingdom it was those that was born again by one spirit and baptized into one body but the organized Church said it's this we're Lutheran this one said we're Calvin this one said we're we're um Libertarians whatever it be but the true church the church that God that Christ is building by one Spirit were baptized into one body he's not building Nations so when a man is trying to preserve Christianity like Peter was trying to protect Jesus Christ now they're playing into the hands of sa and inspired by Satan Tony Perkins the president of the Family Resources said Trump is committed to undoing the anti-faith policies of the previous aministration and restoring true religion true religious freedom Trump said that we are stopping cold the attacks on Judo Christian values he said America is a ation of Believers and together we are strengthened by the power of prayer he was the he he he as the President of the United States has recognized Jerusalem as the Eternal capital of Jerusalem and is initiating the move the moving of our Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem Trump also in instituted the Bible study in the white house for his cabinet members and any others who would like to attend first time in a hundred years and I said sounds like Constantine to me because he's Champion the cause of Christianity and yet he's unconverted now watch watch now so now we're in 2024 and so we've been talking about Christian nationalism which he has embraced and they're afraid that we are that we are losing our identity and our freedom if we do not preserve our cultural inheritance in Christian nationalism and I'm just trying to skip over some of this and this last Easter so Biden appoints the same day as Easter as the transgender um visibility day whatever that is on Easter and so Trump this is what he says happy Holy Week let's make America pray again as we lead into Good Friday and Easter I encourage you to get a copy of the God bless the America B ible Trump wrote in a post all Americans need a Bible in their home and I have many it's my favorite book Trump said in this video posted on Truth social I am proud to endorse and encourage you to get uh this Bible we must make America Pray Again The Bible will also feature now this is interesting I don't know if any of you have ever seen this or heard about it but uh the picture that I saw of it uh on the news it's a it's a Bible and across the front there's an American flag an American flag and a Bible a city and a tower right civil power the United States and a Bible that's interesting and in this Bible what they were calling the Trump Bible now he calls it the God Bless America Bible religion um he said this Bible will also feature in this Bible the United States Constitution the Declaration of Independence the Bill of Rights the pledge allegiance as well as a handwritten chorus of God bless the United or the USA according to the website that's interesting isn't it now we've got political power and religious power in one book a symbol of a theocracy that's how close we are that's right they got a Bible Constitution Bill of Rights pledge allegiance American flag on the front and they're wanting to make America a Christian Nation which is a theocracy in order to have a theocracy you have to have what we would call a state religion it's called an established religion the first thing they have to do is nullify the First Amendment the first amendment is what was holding the dragon back it already had its roots but it held it from being empowered once you do do away with the Constitution and they're even saying well you know we want the Bible to be the absolute now in order to make the Bible the absolute we've got to get rid of the Constitution because the Constitution is the absolute and it's bible-based so let's go to the original you know we got a messenger and we've got messages and they come from the Bible so why not just lay the message and the messenger aside and go back to the Bible to the original but that's where they were before the prophet came yeah so now when you have the Bible as the absolute and we push the Constitution away because it's only bible-based now now the problem is who's going to interpret this for you there's the problem the problem problem is not having Jesus Christ over you but who's communion with him who's getting the instructions that's right who's the diviner yes yes sir you see what I'm saying and then if the Bible we go to straight to the absolute well that's good but if it's not inspired of the Holy Ghost what have you got what do you got with a church that goes to an absolute but doesn't have the Holy Spirit the right interpreter the holy spirit is the only Divine interpreter to the word that's right that's why you must be born again you must have the Holy Spirit it's God that's going to teach you I was looking back this Kingdom we just uh yeah well we're just running out of time but that's the way it is because we're creatures of time right now but there will come a time that we will'll be more free we'll have a million years but uh or a thousand years I'm sorry but right now we don't have a thousand years so now I've got to figure out what I'm going to do here but this Kingdom I wanted to I wanted to go back to Genesis that this Kingdom that you and I are contending for Jesus said if my kingdom was of this Earth then we'd fight for it but he said my kingdom is not from this Earth it's from its origin its Authority comes from God now in the beginning God created man and he set him over he set him over the Earth in all life that was his Dominion that was his kingdom yeah and Adam was the King and his authority came from God God set that Kingdom up yeah not Adam it wasn't of the world it wasn't from some World System that's what Jesus is saying it's not from the earth it's not the Roman government it's not the Greek government it's not any government this Authority doesn't come from any human power it comes from Heaven he never denied he was a king he said the kingdom if my kingdom if my subjects if this kingdom was of this world we'd be at War but my kingdom is not of this world and he was at war with Satan you said but it's not not from this Earth it's not from this world Listen Adam's Kingdom it was created by God and God set Adam over over the world and over all living life and then in this perfect world that he had created and he looked and he said everything is good then in the middle of it he takes and he creates The Garden of the Eden and in the Garden of Eden he creates Adam Out of the Dust of the earth and then he takes Adam and he puts them in the Garden of Eden that's the throne room that's where the throne is and he's to rule have dominion he's to subdue and take control of all the world and it was designed that way right it was designed to have a king a Shepherd that's what a true king in the kingdom of God is is a Shepherd he's not a royal king having people wash his feet and bow down and treasures Jesus Christ is our King he's our Shepherd David was a Shepherd king and the word over in Matthew where it talks about and he shall rule it's talking about a Shepherd feeding his sheep yeah that's what a real king does that's what we're made Kings and Priests and people thinking of castles and Thrones and but we're Shepherds we're Shepherd Kings and Priests to feed the people and lead the people in in the way of God Amen so he set Adam and he came down and he met with Adam that was the holiest of holies that was where the throne was that God would come down and fellowship with Adam but Adam fell he walked away from the throne his wife had fallen and he had to leave the throne to go to her side to try to redeem her to embrace her in love and he walked away from the throne he was a Fallen King he lost his kingdom and the kingdom fell and God's three-fold purpose is to do what number one he wanted to reveal himself to the people and he did that through Christ he wanted to come to the Earth and be a human being among amongst his people human beings he wanted to he wanted to take Jehovah as he was in that form the pillar of fire a whirlwind and all the different forms that he appeared and he tabernacled himself in a human body and God identified himself something that you and I could talk to we we look in the scriptures we see him take the children and put them on his on their lap we see him talk to the woman at the well the compassion we see him feed the 2,000 the 3,000 the 5,000 we see the compassion we see the humanity we see the love we see the anger when he walked into the church into the house and they'd made it a den of Thieves and and made merchandise out of religion and he took a three qued sash he was human and he didn't get mad at somebody would steal some money from him but when he saw what they did to the H House of God and anger him said this is a House of Prayer it's not a house of business this is not a house of merchandise this is not where people come to make money and give money this is where we come to worship God right but what have they made out of churches it's a place that we come and worship he was a human being that's the one that we identify how much do you identify with Jehovah you read about Jehovah in the Old Testament and the closest we can come is oh I'd like to meet him job said if I knew where his seat was where his throne is I'd go knock on his door that's what's in every True believer's Heart we want to find him but how can you identify with a with a a Jehovah a pillar of fire that would be an amazing experience as the angel of the Lord that'd be something else but to see him as a man to sit around the campfire with him to lay your head on his bosom to hear words of comfort to hear words of Correction as a human being what do we identify with we identify with Jesus Christ not Jehovah not the pillar of fire you it's hard to sit down and hold hands with a pillar of fire it's hard to put your arm around the pillar of fire but if that Pillar of Fire tabernacled itself in human flesh and become man he wanted something you could identify yourself with amen and then all Jehovah was he poured into Christ then all that Christ was he poured into the church amen he said on this rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it that's the same promise that he give to Abraham it's the same promise he gave to Rebecca it's the same promise he gave to the Seed of Abraham that the gates of hell that they will not Prevail against them the Gate of the enemy will not Prevail against them listen it's not not just a church it's a people the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you it shows that it's going to be in contention it's going to come against you death is going to come against you religion's going to come against you theocracy but the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the god that's down in your soul listen when they Clos the gates of Gaza to lock Samson in the gates could not prevail he took the gates and carried them off to a hill laid him down and kept on going yeah when Moses said I can't talk he said I'll be with your mouth he said well I just I I can't do it okay I'll give you Aaron he'll be your spokesman you're my spokesman but I I I just won't know what he said I'll teach you I'll teach you what to say now who's going to teach you am I going to teach you what to say or is the holy spirit going to teach you come on who's the teacher today listen it's it's it's it's The Man Behind the pulpit that's a Divine gift but there's a Divine gift in you if you don't have the Divine teacher in you the Divine teaching up here is not going to do you any good it's just going to fall on your ears and end up in the in the Corral of your brain but it's meant to go down into the heart and the Holy Spirit the only one that puts it down there he's the only Divine interpreter of the word he is the shepherd he's the king shepherd he's The Shepherd of your soul not of your soul only but in your soul to keep youen it's not the law that keeps you it's not the church that keeps you it's the holy spirit it's the life he that has the son has life not he that has the prophet not he that has the message not he that has the Bible but he that has the son has life amen and then all of that becomes your domain your inheritance we're coming to an adoption what is the adoption galatian says in the in the fullness of time God sent his son that's Calvary in the fullness of time God sent his son that's Calvary that he might redeem us why why were you redeemed so you could be a Christian so you get the Holy Ghost and live a good life he redeemed us that we might receive the adoption of sons you you know what the adoption is that's receiving your inheritance because the adoption of the King's son when he's placed in adoption he's placed in the throne so he his inheritance as a prince is the kingdom the throne and so in his adoption he's brought to the throne and set in his position we're coming to the fullness of our adoption yes and all hell is against it right when that Throne fell the kingdom fell back in the in Genesis in the Garden of Eden the whole thing fell listen when the bride was wakened when the Lord descended with a shout it Not only was the bride awaken Not only was a foolish awaken but I want to tell you what creation was awakened and it began to groan and travail for the manifestation of the sons of God because creation fell and creation is to be restored because creation is our Dominion amen and we are now in restoration we are now born again we are now redeemed and why were you redeemed that you might receive the adoption we sealed unto the adoption we're predestinated unto adoption we have an inheritance being predestinated when you receive the Hool Holy Ghost you not only become a son and daughter of God you become an heir an heir of what a kingdom the second fold is to gain the preeminence in a people hallelujah in a church and he does that by coming and living in you what's the third fold purpose to restore the kingdom back these people are are good intentions they're trying to put prayer back in school they're trying to do away with all this abortion and all these laws have been passed against Christian Christian values against Christian families against uh what God has called us to do they're trying to get to a place to make it illegal for us to be Christians so the effort is to make America a Christian Nation listen God ain't call us to politic God has called us to preach the gospel to live the gospel to be a light because it ain't going to be long we're going to be out of here we don't want to do something because we have good intentions we want to find God's perfect will am and when we're with the word the word is with us right it's not just what it's how it's How David came into correction and listen when when he put that Ark on the shoulders of those priests and they made three steps God strengthened them when we do things according to the word of God come on in divine order yes it taken a profet to come and to give us instructions because the world had just they had put all their instructions and all their traditions and we could not pull the full nutritional spiritual of this word brother Bren didn't give us the word God gave us the word he sent a prophet to give us the instructions and how to throw Nutri nutritional value and strength from this word by whitewashing by getting all of man's ideas and Theology and bringing us back to the word to the original Faith amen God sent a prophet listen it's not you just was woken up but look at this world brother Brandon preached birth pains tornadoes volcanoes hurricanes look at the seasons they're all mixed up you used to be able to go down to Guyana South America they had a dry season and they had a wet season you didn't go down there in the wet season cuz you couldn't get around in the mosquito the malaria was just double and so you go down in the dry season now you go down there in the dry season and it's raining why he said the Earth is in birth pains listen she's woken up she's groaning and she's travailing Israel was groaning and travailing why because it was a covenant time we're at a covenant time that God is going to come Christ said I'll come and receive you onto myself we're at that time we're at covenant time because the Covenant Angel John was a covenant Angel he came and he introduced to us God of that age that God that hung it and God has sent a prophet in this day to introduce Jesus Christ to you and me the son of man the sign of the word the presence of God hallelujah he that has the son as life he that listened to Moses got nutritional value from that Mana God sent the Mana but God designed it in such a way you had to listen to his messenger god had a messenger at the first Exodus he had a messenger at the second Exodus he's got a messenger in the Third Exodus he fulfilled his commission and God pulled him off the scene I must diminish and he must increase so Christ the holy spirit is supposed to be increasing in you and I but listen our daily struggles our daily battles we're still human beings but we have the word to meet these battles with through faith it's not some kind of a remedy well I don't have any money the business is not doing good all right I'm going to double my ties I'm just going to see I'm going to double my ties and God will open up the doors of Heaven that ain't it you know why Abraham when he came back from the Battle of redemption after he redeemed lot you know why he gave tithe it wasn't because the church said you have to give ties you got to give this you got to do that it was when MDC told him that God had given him that battle you go read it God gave that battle that Victory to Abraham as soon as he heard that it it said he offered up tithes of the spoils the tithing was recognizing that God had given him yes God had given him that battle amen God has given us our incomes God is going to take care of us seek ye first the kingdom it's not a matter of doubling your ties listen it's not a remedy it's not cough medicine it it's it's not uh positive thinking it's it's it it's not uh how we're going to run the business and how we're going to make money it's worship when he gave that to when he gave uh that that tithing he was confessing that God had given that that Victory to him it was worship I'm going to read one scripture and then I'm going to close I want to turn to Hebrews 2 Hebrews let me see if I find it on here I can read it better and then we'll close Hebrew Hebrews chapter 2 let me find it let me let me start at verse one if I can we're at 12:30 actually 1229 and A2 I think sorry got 30 seconds therefore we ought to give more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip so he's talking about giving heed to the things that we've heard we're not talking about news we're not talking about what I told you about Trump we're talking about the gospel of word amen what's been delivered to us Us in this day amen you know sometimes you you can pull up I was talking to a young girl one time and I said you better be careful it's like you're in a boat and you're out the end of the pier and it's not tied off and if you sit there just kind of watching the clouds and things you won't know but the boat will start to drift and you know you can reach out and grab the the the pier real quick but if you get the what we used to call Lolly gagging around you might find yourself out there without a paddle and you'll let you'll let the pier slip by that's what it means with just in attention just let it slip by for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast in every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward now listen to this how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will For unto the angels have he not put in subjection the world to come wherefore we speak who who did he put the world not not the world past not the world present but also the world to come who did he put it under but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of manth him that mest him a little lower than the angels that crowned that crownest him with glory and honor and Des set him over the works of thy hands he's talking about back there with Adam but he's also talking about the world that's to come who set over it you and me because we're the sons of God that's and our inheritance is that Kingdom that fell that God now is restoring you and me back to our kingship at the manifestation of the sons of God to even to the changing of our bod's adoption and he says if we neglect so great a Salvation if we neglect so great a message not just the scriptures but God has sent a messenger the Lord descended he when he came to Moses he said I've come down listen Revelation 101 I the Lord have come down right another Mighty Angel Christ Covenant time rainbow over his head 1 Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord shall he send with a shout a message he said Moses he said you're going to be my mouth I'm going to be with your mouth I'm going to teach you what to say God sent a prophet that was his mouth and he taught him what to say he said I was only there when he said this if we neglect listen there's those that never received it they rejected it it's not talking about those that rejected it it's those that have received it and now are beginning to neglect it I find it easy to build a house but then maintaining the house I become negligent I can build new houses but but then to maintain if we begin to neglect it we won't have a house if we neglect this salvation that we've received if we start getting sidetracked into the things of the world and problems of the world if we neglect just to neglect he said how you going to escape in other words the only way of Escape is the word word of God that's right the only salvation is through Christ amen and if you neglect that if you lose that you're not going to escape we don't want to get to a place we become cold and indifferent because of sickness because of finances because of domestic problems whatever it is all right we don't want to neglect the word of God that we've received where it'll slip away from us as we bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord those in lay the seal Lord they they thought they were rich and had need of nothing but the spirit of the Lord said they were naked miserable blind and didn't know it they had neglected they had neglected the Salvation that they had and now it had been slid from them Slipped Away cold indifferent whirly worldliness have been to creep in through neglect and through their own worldliness the prophet said they ran him out Lord we don't want to run you out with our neglect we don't want it to slip from us this that Lord came into our lives was the love of our life we don't want to be like Adam that was standing there waiting for you every evening and then you created and gave him a gift of Eve and then when you came he wasn't there his love was turned aside for what the gift that you had given him Lord we don't want to fall in love with the gifts but we want to love The Giver of theft gifts we don't want our love turned aside for things that you give us in this world but Lord we thank you for those things that you give us but we don't want to neglect you we want to be there when you come when you come down into our lives in the cool of the evening of Fellowship Lord we want to be there we don't want to be neglectful we want to give you our attention help us Lord this morning Lord may you stir up our hearts this morning not our emotions not our imagination but stir up our very heart and soul wake us up it's a waking up time the world is woken up and we're groaning and travailing together with them and this day that scripture is fulfilled in our ears and in our sight the day is approaching help us instruct us Lord as to what youve called us for and what we should be doing let us not just go out presuming but let us wait upon you they that wait upon the Lord shall be strengthened they'll run and not be weary Lord we don't want to operate our gifts we want you to operate the gifts that you've given into our lives we want to exercise what you've given us for others bless this people Lord forgive me Lord for this just scattered out message in different ways but Lord we feel that we've said something to encourage us to make us aware of the time that we're living in and not Lord let us not be negligent Lord but help us Lord lead us and guide us as we rest in in your wing in your feathers Lord as we draw up to draw warmth from you and to draw nourishment from elh Hadi Lord our eyes are upon you may you come to each one this morning speak to them Lord Comfort them encourage them Lord and lift them up Lord above these
