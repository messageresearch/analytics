Long ago was a tiny simple stable [singing] all beaten and warm. [music] It was hardly [singing] a place for a king to be born. He didn't choose some place special [music] to reveal [singing] his majesty. So I know I' if I'll give him control, he'll be born [singing] in [music] me. Let your word be born [singing] in the manger of my heart. [music] Let it live in [singing] me. Let it start. [music] Live inside this house of [singing] clay and [music] mold it every day. Let your word [singing and music] be born in the manger of my heart. Oh, listen to my story. Well, outwardly where nothing, not much [music and singing] to behold.

Well, it's eternal. Amen. You may be seated. Y'all bless brother Caleb tonight. &gt;&gt; Can I get the lyrics to the goodness of God? &gt;&gt; All right. I love you, [singing] Lord, for your mercy never fails [music and singing] me. All my days I've been held in your hands.

He maketh me lie down in green pastures. He [music] leadth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's [music] sake. Yay, thou walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I'll fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, [music] they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Amen. Thou knownest my head with oil. My cup runth over. Surely goodness and mercy [music] shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen. Can we give him a praise tonight? [applause] We've just started compared to eternity. This is just a little blip. Amen. Little space in time. Amen. Where God is Amen. had a plan of salvation and redemption and come down himself to make it all happen. [music] Amen. For God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. Amen. because God's not willing that any shouldn't perish. Any [music] should perish, but all come to repentance tonight. So, let's stand to our feet and ask the man of God to come. Let's just sing that little chorus, Sister Mary, and see. I believe the Lord is my shepherd. Amen. The Lord is my shepher. He goes before me, [singing] defender [singing] behind me. Now I won't [singing] fear. [music] I'm filled with anointing. [singing] My cup's overflowing. [singing and music] No [singing and music] weapon can harm me and I won't [music] fear.

[singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord &gt;&gt; for he's [music and singing] my comfort. always hold me close. [singing] Hallelujah. Can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise here tonight? [applause] Amen. So glad that he's our shepherd here tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that we're never alone. &gt;&gt; My goodness. It may the devil may throw it on us like we are, but we're never alone. That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that here tonight. I'd like to say I thoroughly enjoyed the message this morning. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. It spoke to my heart and [applause] something I've been dealing with and so I really appreciate his [music] um his willingness to let the Lord use him here this morning. Amen. I tried my best to get him to take part two tonight, but here we are. Amen. Um, if you have your Bibles, I'd like to turn to Genesis 1 and one and like, did you write this? Amen. I tell you what, I appreciate my my daughter. Every It seems like everywhere I go, there's a sticky note somewhere saying she loves me or appreciates me. And I've been nervous about, you know, this thought and she wrote this here. So, I I appreciate that. It means a means a lot to me. Amen. Genesis 1 and1 when you're there say [clears throat] amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to read this passage of scripture and I'll let you have your seats and then we'll continue on. But Genesis 1 and one says in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and the darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said let there be light. and there was light. Heavenly Father, how we love you here tonight, Lord. And it's such a privilege to be able to come into your house on this Sunday night, Lord, and feel your presence, Father, and and to know matter what we deal with or what we go through that we are never alone. Thank you, Lord, for that. And I pray here tonight that you'll just calm the nerves. Lord, may every heart be receptive to what you have for us here tonight. Lord, bless the reading of your word. In your name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless you. You may be seated here tonight. If we can turn to John 1 and 1-5. Amen. John 1 and 1-5. These are all very familiar passages of scripture. And I wish we all had a a brain like brother Merl where he can remember things. I bet he can quote this. I don't have that kind of memory. So, Amen. How many appreciates Brother Merl? &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate his song leading. [applause] Not song leading. We got song leaders. Then we got worship leaders. I appreciate brother Merl's worship leading. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. And the same in the beginning with God. And all things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. And in him was life, and the light life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. John 1:5 in the ESV version says, "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it." Thank God for that. Amen. 2 Corinthians 4 and6. I'm almost almost to my thought here tonight. 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 6 says, "For God who commanded the light to shine out of the darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." And if I had a very simple title, it seems like this is something we've been dealing with our with the young people for the last month or so, but it'd be guarding the heart. Guarding the heart. And I and I love how the ESV version puts that comprehendeth not that it translates that it did not overcome it. Thank God that he could not overcome. He overcame the darkness. Amen. 2 Corinthians 4:6 talks about our hearts being in darkness and the light of the truth shineth out of that darkness and the darkness could not overcome it. Amen. The darkness will never be able to overcome that light. &gt;&gt; No matter how hard it pushes and no matter how dark the evening may be in this age that we live in, how dark and chaotic and evil it is, it will never be able to snuff out the light. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We see here in Genesis in creation, it's the same pattern that God saved us with. Amen. And the first words that God spoke actually expressed every word that God would ever truly speak. Amen. It was as though his first words would describe every other word that came from his mouth when he said, "Let there be light." John said Jesus was the word and that word is life. And that life is the light of all men. How many can say amen to that? And after we read the speaking forth of light in Genesis, we read where God winds up planting a garden eastward in Eden &gt;&gt; and putting man in that garden. Genesis 2 and 7 says, "And the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostril nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul. And the Lord planted a garden eastward in Eden. And there he put the man whom he had formed. So bear with me as I build a foundation here tonight. Notice the garden is eastward in in Eden. And a single river flowed from Eden into that garden. Genesis 2:10 says, "And a river came out of Eden and watered the garden. From then it was parted and became into four heads." So we see here that it flowed into four different directions from there. And Adam was instructed carefully above everything else to dress &gt;&gt; and to keep this garden. Amen. Genesis 2:15 says, "And the Lord took man and put him in the garden of Eden to dress and to keep it." And the meaning of this dress and keep it means to protect it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat, BUT OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." So we see here the first thing that we READ RECORDED WAS GOD'S WORD TO ADAM. DO NOT EAT OF THAT TREE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN EAT OF THAT TREE ALIVE. YOU CAN EAT OF EVERY TREE IN THE GARDEN, BUT THAT TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL, THOU SHALT NOT PARTAKE OF THAT TREE. GOD ALWAYS HAS A PURPOSE FOR EVERYTHING HE DOES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THE FIRST PURPOSE GOD HAS FOR ADAM IS TO dress and to KEEP THE GARDEN. AND WE MUST NOTICE ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE, ADAM WAS TO DRESS AND PROTECT THAT GARDEN. NO MATTER WHAT WOULD COME IN, NO MATTER WHAT WOULD TRY TO HINDER, HE WAS TO PROTECT THAT GARDEN. YEAH, &gt;&gt; THAT WAS WHY HE WAS PUT THERE AND HE WAS TOLD NOT TO EAT OF THAT FALSE TREE. &gt;&gt; And then WE READ ADAM'S DISOBEDIENCE and and sin and took place AND HE WAS BEING CAST OUT OF THE GARDEN. BROTHER BRHAM SAID THAT ADAM WILLINGLY DISOBEYED BECAUSE OF HIS LOVE FOR EVE &gt;&gt; WHICH DEPICTS CHRIST'S LOVE FOR US. &gt;&gt; CHRIST WILLINGLY LEFT HIS THE SPLENDOR OF HEAVEN. HE WILLINGLY CAME DOWN AS A MAN TO LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR LOVE. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Genesis 3 and22 says, "And the Lord God said, behold, the man is become as one of us to know good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever." Therefore, THE LORD GOD SENT him f forth from the garden of Eden to teal the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man and placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubams and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. SO THE VERY THING GOD'S WORD FOCUSED around was the tree of life. AND WE SEE BECAUSE MAN WAS DISOBEDIENT &gt;&gt; AND THEY FELL INTO SIN, THEY COULDN'T PARTAKE OF THAT TREE OF LIFE ANY LONGER. &gt;&gt; FOR GOD SAID THE VERY FIRST THING HE SAID WAS NOT TO EAT OF THAT FALSE TREE. AND WE SEE THE LAST THING THAT TOOK PLACE WAS ADAM DID EAT OF THAT FALSE TREE AND WAS KICKED OUT OF THE GARDEN BECAUSE OF HIS DISOBEDIENCE. REMEMBER THE WOMAN WAS THE FIRST ONE TO SIN BUT BECAUSE OF LOVE. ADAM COULD HAVE KICKED HER ASIDE. &gt;&gt; ADAM COULD HAVE STAYED IN THE GARDEN AND WATCHED HIS LOVE LEAVE, BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOVE IN HIS HEART, SHE WAS A PART OF HIM. &gt;&gt; And he knew HE COULDN'T LIVE LIFE WITHOUT HER. SO HE DECIDED TO WILLINGLY PARTAKE OF THAT TREE for love. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND WE SEE BECAUSE OF THIS THE WAY OF THE TREE OF LIFE WAS BLOCKED and man WAS NOT ALLOWED TO EAT IT freely like they used to because of sin. Amen. And we see a scripture here that connects all this together in Proverbs 4:23 says, "Keep thy heart WITH ALL DILIGENCE, FOR OUT OF IT ARE THE issues of life." KEEP THY HEART WITH ALL DILIGENCE. NOW I'M GETTING TO MY THOUGHT ON GUARDING THE HEART. FOR OUT OF THAT ARE THE ISSUES OF LIFE WITH ALL DILIGENCE. THE TRANSLATION HERE SAYS ABOVE ALL KEEPING ABOVE ALL KEEPING. KEEP ALL THY HEART ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. PROTECT THAT HEART. GUARD THAT HEART. WATCH WHAT YOU PUT IN THAT HEART. WATCH WHAT YOU ALLOW TO GO INTO THAT HEART. BECAUSE OUT OF THE ISSUES OF THAT HEART ARE THE ISSUES OF LIFE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The heart. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, REGARDING ALL OTHER THINGS, YOU MUST PROTECT AND keep that heart. I hope you're understanding where I'm going so far. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE GREATEST ELEMENT WE WERE EVER TOLD WAS TO KEEP AND TO PROTECT THAT HEART. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE SEE THAT ADAM'S FIRST PURPOSE was keep in the garden. HIS FIRST COMMANDMENT WAS WAS NOT TO EAT OF THAT FORBIDDEN TREE. And we SEE THE SERIOUSNESS OF ADAM'S PROTECTION OF THAT GARDEN LATER WHEN THE SERPENT SLIPPED IN AND DECEIVED EVE. AND WE SEE HOW IT IT CAUSED A DOMINO EFFECT ON MAN. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T GOD'S PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SPOKEN IN BY THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO. &gt;&gt; BUT THEN SIN CAME ABOUT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT GOD HAS A PLAN FOR EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT? GOD ALLOWED SIN TO HAPPEN. GOD ALLOWED THAT SERPENT TO SLIP IN THERE. GOD ALLOWED THE FALL OF MANKIND. GOD ALLOWED ADAM TO TO GO AFTER THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE HAD A PLAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, WE SEE NOW THAT SIN HAS SLIPPED INTO THE HUMAN RACE. NO LONGER ARE WE LIVING IN A STATE OF PERFECTION. I LOVE THAT HOW HOW EVE FELL IN A state of perfection. BUT THIS BRIDE, &gt;&gt; IN A STATE OF IMPERFECTION, IN A STATE OF CHAOS, IT'S GOING TO BE STRONG AND MIGHTY. &gt;&gt; AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN ENDURE WHAT SATAN HAS FOR US IS TO GUARD THE HEART. &gt;&gt; PROTECT THE MIND. PROTECT THE HEART. REMEMBER, OUT OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THE HEART, &gt;&gt; THE MOUTH SPEAKETH. WHAT YOU HAVE HERE WILL ULTIMATELY COME OUT HERE. &gt;&gt; YES, &gt;&gt; IT'S IT MATTERS YOUNG PEOPLE. IT MATTERS ELDERS WHAT WE PUT HERE. &gt;&gt; IT MATTERS WHO WE HAVE AS OUR STABILITY IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS. IT IT MATTERS WHAT WE BELIEVE IN. &gt;&gt; I'M GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF, BUT IT MATTERS. &gt;&gt; IT MATTERS &gt;&gt; WHO WE HAVE AT THE HELM OF THE SHIP. YEAH. &gt;&gt; So we SEE ADAM WAS CALLED TO DRESS AND TO KEEP THE GARDEN. HE WAS CALLED TO PROTECT IT. LIKEWISE, YOUR HEART IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR ENTIRE BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND ABOVE ALL ABOVE all your you're you're try to get skinny, try to eat right. Yeah. Amen. I've been trying that for 34 years now. Above all, my my boy Uriah is he's determined to get a six-pack. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Seven years old. And I'm proud of him. He doesund and something sit-ups a day. When he eats sugar, he makes sure to he does extra exercises. He's diligent. BUT ABOVE ALL THAT, YOUR HEART IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. NOT A SIX-PACK, [laughter] NOT YOUR LOOKS. &gt;&gt; NOT HOW YOU LOOK OUT HERE AS WE HEARD THIS MORNING, &gt;&gt; BUT INWARDLY THE HEART &gt;&gt; IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. AND THE REASON IS IS FROM FROM THE HEART OR THE ISSUES OF LIFE, ISSUES OF LIFE THAT THAT COME OUT OF HERE IN THE NATURAL. THE THE ACTIVITIES YOU DO AND THE WORKS YOU COMMIT, THE THE WORDS YOU SAY, THINGS YOU DO IN THE NATURAL. Think about it. Brother Merl, maybe you could help me with this. What is the number one cause of heart attacks? &gt;&gt; Nervousness. &gt;&gt; Nervousness. Any anyone else? &gt;&gt; Stress. &gt;&gt; Sugar. Yeah. Being unhealthy, fat like me. If you want to live a longer life, you must first protect your natural heart. &gt;&gt; Okay? In order to to prevent yourself from having a heart attack and and having things that take place in your life, YOU MUST TAKE THE PROPER measures to prevent yourself from having that heart attack. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And we SEE IN THE SUPERNATURAL, in order for you to prevent yourself FROM HAVING A SPIRITUAL HEART ATTACK, YOU MUST WHAT? PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE DANGERS OF THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO PROTECT. I KNOW I'M I'm repeating MYSELF HERE, BUT IT'S SO important what you allow to enter here. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your heart is a very important part of yourself. And and so much the term has been said and speaking of of of the heart of the matter. Amen. It says HERE, "YOUR HEART PUMPS blood to the limbs and which you utilize to act and to do." They say the BLOOD IS CALLED THE LIFE of the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Leviticus 17:11 17 and 11 says, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood." &gt;&gt; "And I have given it to you UPON THE ALTAR TO MAKE AN ATONEMENT for your souls, for it is in the blood that maketh an atonement for your souls." So we see here the life is within THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; YOUR LIMBS REQUIRE LIFE in order for you to act and to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you DON'T HAVE ANY BLOOD FLOW TO THAT LIMB, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU HAVE NO BLOOD FLOW TO YOUR RIGHT ARM? &gt;&gt; You're going to lose it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So we see here in Proverbs 4:23 says, "Keep thy heart with all diligence." I'm getting somewhere here tonight. For out of it are the issues of life. &gt;&gt; BLOOD IS PHYSICALLY the issue OF LIFE. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LOSE TOO MUCH BLOOD? &gt;&gt; AMEN. I need someone that's smarter than me. What happens when you lose too much blood? &gt;&gt; You die. &gt;&gt; And what happens when YOU MAKE IT TO THE hospital on time, but you've lost a large amount of blood? What do they do to you? &gt;&gt; What's so important about the blood? &gt;&gt; Blood. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What's so important about the heart working properly? [laughter] It gives life. Without your heart, you're dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. So from THE ISSUE, THE HEART OF BLOOD ISSUES OF LIFE, IT'S IT'S POPPED INTO YOUR ARMS, INTO YOUR HANDS, into your legs, and to your feet. SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE HEART is very important. And people are very concerned over their hearts above other health problems. Amen. Everyone protects their heart. ABOVE ALL THINGS, PROTECT YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; BUT THE BIBLE SPEAKS OF THE HEART AS the part of you that believes and loves. &gt;&gt; Romans 10:9 SAYS THAT IF THOU SHALT CONFESS WITH THY MOUTH THE LORD JESUS, AND SHALL BELIEVE IN THY HEART THAT GOD has raised HIM FROM THE DEAD, THOU shalt be saved. 1 PETER 1:22 SAYS, "SEE, ye have purified your souls, obeying the truth through the spirit unto UNFEIGNED LOVE OF THE BRETHREN. See that you love one another with a pure heart, &gt;&gt; fervently." [snorts] &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; SO, THE IDEA OF YOUR HEART, IT COMES WITH A A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE. I HOPE THIS OKAY TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT YOU BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; PROTECT YOUR HEART. WATCH WHAT YOU LOVE. PROTECT YOUR HEART. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU LET IN. GUARD YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; For out of the abundance of their heart. Amen. We see here THE SERPENT GAVE A WORD to Eve that she believed even when he was a lie. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Yeah, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; AND LOOK WHAT IT DID TO THE HUMAN RACE. IT DOES MATTER WHAT YOU BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; I SAID IT EARLIER. IT MATTERS WHAT YOU PUT YOUR FEET UPON. &gt;&gt; IS IT ON SANDY GROUND? DOES IT LOOK GOOD BUT DOESN'T HAVE A FOUNDATION? OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THE STORMS? BECAUSE REMEMBER, WHEN YOU BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE AND YOU HAVE CHRIST AS YOUR IN THE HOLY GHOST IN YOUR HEART, SATAN IS GOING TO ATTACK THAT BELIEF. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'RE NOT STABILIZED IN WHAT YOU BELIEVE, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? YEAH, &gt;&gt; IT MATTERS WHAT YOU BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; IT MATTERS WHAT YOU HAVE ANCHORED YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; IT IT IT DOESN'T MATTER. AMEN. IF IT'S OFF WHAT THE PASTOR SAYS OR WHAT THIS PERSON THINKS OR YOU'RE GOING TO END UP LIKE EVE, BELIEVING IN A LIE THINKING IT'S A TRUTH. &gt;&gt; That's right. You must know that you know that YOU KNOW BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT. NO MATTER WHO MAY COME AND TRY AND TALK YOU OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW [screaming] THAT I BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE. REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE, [applause] &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF THE WINDS. COME ON NOW. &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T GOING TO TALK ME OUT OF WHAT I BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But be careful. Satan can lead you astray if you're not anchored. &gt;&gt; That's right. Watch what you love. First John 2:15 SAYS, "LOVE NOT THE WORLD, neither the things that are in the world." If any man love the world and the love of the father, if any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as much as if you get heart [snorts] disease or if your blood gets diseased, it affects your arms. Amen. &gt;&gt; It affects your legs, it it affects other parts of your body. It can you. AND IF YOU'RE NOT WHERE YOU NEED TO BE with the Lord, your spiritual heart can cause problems as well. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Yeah, BROTHER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOUR HEART CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS AND IT CAN CAUSE YOUR SPIRITUAL BODY NOT TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. &gt;&gt; IT CAN CAUSE YOUR ARM TO BE CRIPPLED. IT CAN CAUSE YOUR YOUR LEG TO GO NUMB. IT CAN CAUSE YOUR MIND TO BE SEARED. IF YOU'RE NOT WHERE YOU OUGHT TO BE WITH THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, I SAY HERE TONIGHT, YOU CAN HAVE IT. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HE CAN TAKE A STONY HEART. &gt;&gt; HE CAN TAKE A HEART THAT'S BEEN CORRUPTED BY THE WORLD AND GIVE YOU A FRESH HEART AGAIN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You say, "Brother Kobe, I haven't GUARDED MY HEART LIKE I needed to." Well, I KNOW A GOD THAT CAN REPAIR THE HEART. &gt;&gt; HE CAN GIVE ME A FRESH START LIKE WE HEARD THIS MORNING. SOMETIMES WE OUGHT TO JUST GO BACK TO THE BLOOD AGAIN. YOU SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, I FAILED AND I FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO HOPE FOR ME." AS LONG AS THERE'S BREATH IN YOUR BODY, THERE'S HOPE FOR YOU. [applause] &gt;&gt; IT IS SATAN THAT WILL TRY TO PREVENT YOU FROM GOING ALL THE WAY. BUT HERE TONIGHT, HERE TONIGHT, JUST PUSH THROUGH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HE WILL TAKE THE STONY heart and give you a fresh heart again. I pray this is okay tonight. &gt;&gt; But they say the heart is on the left side of your chest. I seen this here today and I thought this was good. says, "If we were like maps, then with north at our head and south at our feet, our hearts would be precisely in the same location the garden was in Eden." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Are you with me here tonight? Let me &gt;&gt; let me get this out here. &gt;&gt; AND LIKE THE FOUR RIVERS THAT are leaving the garden, OUR OUR OUR HEARTS PUMP BLOOD TO THE FOUR LIMBS THAT CARRY OUT OUR ACTIONS AND OUR DEEDS. &gt;&gt; OKAY? IT CONTROLS OUR ARMS &gt;&gt; and our legs. WE KNOW THE FOUR RIVERS LEAVING THE GARDEN ARE LIKE BLOOD LEAVING THE HEART TO THE FOUR LIMBS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT RIVER OF EDEN THAT'S GOING INTO THE GARDEN WHERE IT SPLITS INTO FOUR? IF I CAN SAY THIS HERE, THAT IS OUR OXYGEN. AND GOD HAS BREATHED INTO ADAM THE BREATH OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That's good. AIR IS THEN PUT INTO OUR LUNGS AND INTO OUR BLOODSTREAM WHERE THE HEART PUMPS INTO THE BODY. BREATH OF LIFE, RIVER OF LIFE. GOD IS OUR BREATH OF LIFE HERE TONIGHT. [applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I HOPE THAT'S OKAY. REVELATIONS 22 says and 22 and1 and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb and in the midst of the street of it on either side of the river there was a tree of life which beare 12 manners of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were there for the healing of the nations. S how many can say Jesus is the life here tonight. &gt;&gt; He is that life. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; John 6:53 says and Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye shall have no life in him in you. John 6 and63 says, "It is the spirit that quickenth, THE FLESH PROFITTH NOTHING, BUT THE WORDS THAT I SPEAK UNTO YOU, they are spirit and they are life." His words are life. &gt;&gt; And we SEE THAT THE GARDEN RECEIVED a river of LIFE &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS NOT TO RECEIVE ANYTHING ELSE. AND IF I CAN SAY THIS, THE WORDS THAT YOU ARE LISTENING TO, IF IT'S NOT BENEFITING YOU, &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD &gt;&gt; AND BRINGING YOU CLOSER TO THE LORD, THEN I WOULD PUSH THOSE WORDS ASIDE BECAUSE THE WORDS OF GOD ARE WORDS OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; IT SHOULDN'T CAUSE YOU TO STUMBLE. &gt;&gt; IT SHOULDN'T PUSH YOU DOWN, BUT IT SHOULD LIFT YOU UP. &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD BE YOUR LIGHT IN DARKNESS. IN THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE SICK, IT'S YOUR HEALING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Oh my. &gt;&gt; SO THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING ELSE COMING INTO THAT HEART BESIDES WORDS OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY ADAM WAS THE PROTECTOR OF THE GARDEN. ONLY ALLOWED RIVERS OF LIFE TO COME IN. AND THAT IS SPEAKING OF JESUS HERE TONIGHT. I'M ALMOST DONE. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Keep it keep it short here tonight. &gt;&gt; But Jesus is that life. &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT JESUS, WE HAVE NO LIFE. COME ON. &gt;&gt; We're not ABLE TO LIVE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT ABLE TO FUNCTION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR HEART LIKE WE NEED TO WITHOUT JESUS THE PROTECTOR IN OUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOUR MIND WITHOUT CHRIST BEING THERE WITH YOU? &gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO HAVE FAITH TO BELIEVE FOR A RAPTURE IF CHRIST IS NOT THERE WITH YOU? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let him live through you here tonight. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. YOUR STRENGTH COMES FROM WHAT YOU EAT AND FROM WHAT YOU DRINK AND FROM WHAT YOU BREATHE. IT'S JESUS living through us. &gt;&gt; IT'S JESUS ABIDING WITH I WISH I CAN GET THIS HOW I SEE IT HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT'S JESUS BREATHING THROUGH US. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. COME ON. &gt;&gt; THE SERPENT HAS NO WAY TO COME IN IF JESUS IS YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; THE LIAR HAS NO WAY TO COME IN AND DECEIVE YOUR MIND AND TAKE YOUR HEART IF JESUS IS YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY THAT WILL SUBSTITUTE OTHER THINGS. IF JESUS IS YOUR LIFE, &gt;&gt; oh man, &gt;&gt; I'm talking to myself here tonight. &gt;&gt; WE CAN ALLOW THINGS IN OUR HEARTS. AND WE CAN ALLOW THINGS IN OUR MIND AND WE CAN ALLOW OUR ACTIONS TO TO NOT BE OF CHRIST BECAUSE WE'VE LET DOWN OUR GUARD. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN OUR GUARD IS LET DOWN, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE GUARD TO THE CASTLE HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT? &gt;&gt; THAT CASTLE IS VULNERABLE TO ATTACK BECAUSE THERE'S NO WATCHMEN. THERE'S NO GUARD PROTECTING THE CITY. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR WATCHMEN AT THE HELM OF YOUR HEART, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE SILENT ATTACK. COME ON. &gt;&gt; AND WE CAN FALL INTO THE into the sin and into THE THINGS OF THE WORLD BECAUSE WE'VE GROWN LAX ON THE WATCH. &gt;&gt; BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU TONIGHT, BRING JESUS BACK IN. LET HIM BE THE PROTECTOR OF THE HEART. [applause] &gt;&gt; Is that good tonight? &gt;&gt; I pray it's a help. But but what are you letting into your heart? As I'm about to wrap THIS UP NOW, &gt;&gt; YOUR heart is the source of your words and your actions. &gt;&gt; Matthew 12:35 says, "A good man out of the good TREASURE OF THE HEART BRINGETH FORTH GOOD THINGS, and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things." &gt;&gt; Matthew 15:18. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It says, "But these but those things which proceedth out of the mouth cometh from the heart, and they defile the man. FOR OUT OF THE HEART proceeds evil thoughts and murders, adulterers, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. These are the things which defileth a man. But to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man." Now I want you to notice the words of Proverbs 4:1 says, "Hear ye children the instruction of the father and attend to no understanding, no understanding, no truth." Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Like Genesis says, "Let there be light." And in Proverbs 4:4, he it says here, if we can turn to Proverbs 4 and4, AND HE TAUGHT ME ALSO AND SAID UNTO ME, LET THINE HEART retain my words. Keep my commandments and live. Proverbs 4:11 says, "I HAVE TAUGHT THEE IN THE WAYS OF WISDOM, and I have led thee in the right paths." GENESIS 3:24 SAYS, "SO HE DROVE OUT THE MAN, and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubams, and a flaming sword, which turned every way to keep to the way of the tree of life, the way of wisdom, the way of the tree of life, the right paths. I've spoken on this before, but it's so important what we watch, what we read, what we listen to, what we allow to take up our time. &gt;&gt; I've learned more of the bad things that you put into your heart. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; It hardens the heart. &gt;&gt; Sure does. If all you have on your mind is is movies and and and songs that ain't of the Lord and things that THAT JUST FILLING YOUR MIND WITH JOCK ALL THE TIME, IT HARDENS YOUR HEART TO THE sensitivity of the Lord. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NO LONGER SENSITIVE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD. AND YOU SAY, "HOW DO YOU KNOW, BROTHER KOBE, I'VE DONE IT. I'VE BEEN THERE. I'VE ALLOWED THINGS SO HARD IN MY HEART AND BECAUSE OF IT YOU'LL ACT WAYS THAT YOU WOULD NEVER ACT BEFORE. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL LASH SHOUT AND RAGE WHERE ONCE BEFORE YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU JUST LET THE LORD come in and TAKE HIS JACKHAMMER UPON YOUR HARD AND HEART &gt;&gt; AND YOU WATCH HOW TEARS THAT YOU HAVEN'T SHED IN YEARS BEGIN TO FLOW DOWN YOUR FACE. YOU WANT YOUR HEART THAT'S BEEN CRUSTED OVER BY THE WORLD AND LET GOD GET A HOLD OF IT. I WAS TALKING I PREACHED THE OTHER DAY AT BROTHER BENUIT'S CHURCH AND THERE'S A LADY THAT CAME UP AND SHE SAID, "BROTHER KOBE, I HAVEN'T CRIED IN YEARS." BUT SHE SAID, "WITH THE MESSAGE THAT YOU PREACHED," SHE SAID, "I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOT CRY." SHE'S LIKE, "THE LORD DONE SOMETHING TO MY HEART." AND THIS WAS AN ELDER OF THE CHURCH. AND WHAT I'M SAYING IS GOD CAN DO THE SAME FOR YOU HERE TONIGHT. YOU SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, I I HAVEN'T FELT HIS PRESENCE IN A LONG TIME." [screaming] GOD CAN FIX THAT HERE TONIGHT. YOU SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, I MY HEART HAS BEEN HARDENED." &gt;&gt; GOD CAN FIX IT HERE TONIGHT. [applause] &gt;&gt; You're looking at a I'm going to say I'M A YOUNG MAN. I'M still young. I'm 34. YOU'RE LOOKING AT A YOUNG MAN THAT SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO stand here tonight. THE PAST THAT I'VE HAD AND THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE AND WAYS I'VE ACTED. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; ALLOW MY HEART TO BE HARD. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But it's God. And I'm TELLING YOU HERE TONIGHT, if he can do it for me, &gt;&gt; he can do it for YOU HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WE'RE ALL SAVED AND maybe we're ALL PERFECT. MAYBE I'M JUST SPEAKING TO MYSELF. BUT IF THERE'S SOMEBODY HERE TONIGHT THAT CAN SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, I'M PUSHING PAST THE PRIDE AND I'M SAYING, I NEED HELP." HE'S HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE TO TO FIX THAT BROKEN HEART. HE CAN DO IT. ONLY GOD CAN DO IT. &gt;&gt; Only God can do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Proverbs 4:18. How many will give me just a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Proverbs 4:18, it says, "But the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more until the perfect day, and the way of the wicked is as darkness, they know not what they stumble." John 20 and 21 says, "Then said Jesus to them again, peace be unto you. As my father has sent me, even so send I you." And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said unto them, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." Jesus breathed and said it was the Holy Ghost. And here tonight, I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED JESUS TO BREATHE on us a little bit here tonight. &gt;&gt; SAY, GOD, I'VE GROWN STALE. &gt;&gt; I'VE GROWN TIRED AND WEARY. [sighs] &gt;&gt; I need you to breathe ON ME AGAIN. RENEW MY MIND. RENEW MY HEART. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD, I HAVEN'T FELT YOUR PRESENCE IN SUCH A LONG TIME. God can breathe life here tonight. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU FIRST GOT TO PUSH PAST AND GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU HAVE TO SAY, "I NEED HELP." GOD CAN'T HELP YOU UNLESS YOU REALIZE YOU NEED HELP. YEAH. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; YEAH. That is &gt;&gt; But get the Holy Ghost in your heart, young people. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 55 and1 says, "Oh, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters. And he that hath no money, come ye BUY AND EAT. YAY COME AND BUY WINE AND MILK WITHOUT money without price. Wherefore do you spend MONEY FOR THAT WHICH IS NOT BREAD, and you labor for that which satisfaith not? Hearken hearkenth diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me. here and your soul shall live and I will make an everlasting covenant with you even &gt;&gt; the sure mercies of David. Thank God. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 35 and verse one as the musicians get ready to come now says in the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. IT SHALL BLOSSOM ABUNDANTLY AND REJOICE even with joy in singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it and the excellency of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of the Lord and the excellency of our God. Oh my. Strengthen ye the weak hands. Confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, be strong and fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with recompense. He will come and save you. &gt;&gt; THEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND SHALL BE OPEN, OH MY. &gt;&gt; And the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. &gt;&gt; Then the lame MAN SHALL LEAP AS A HEART, AND THE TONGUE OF THE DUMB SING. For in the wilderness, oh my, IN YOUR DRY PLACE SHALL WATERS BREAK OUT, &gt;&gt; and streams in the desert, &gt;&gt; and the parched ground shall become a pool. In the thirsty land, springs of water. In the habitation of dragons, where each lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes, and a highway shall there be, and a way, which shall be called the way of holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for those. The warfare in men, though full shall not heir therein. No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go there up thereon. It shall not be found there, but the redeemed. How many is redeemed tonight? &gt;&gt; But the redeemed shall walk there, &gt;&gt; and the ransomed of the Lord shall return. Oh my. And come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads. &gt;&gt; They shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. &gt;&gt; God promised that in your wilderness. &gt;&gt; As we preached the other day, he'll turn your sadness into singing. Yes. &gt;&gt; THAT IN YOUR HARD TROUBLED TIMES, THOUGH IT MAY SEEM like you've been there for a season, God promised that in that moment, &gt;&gt; he'll give you joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In that moment, that moment WHERE IT FEELS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN ALONE AND YOU'VE BEEN HURTING, GOD PROMISED to restore. In that moment where you've been sick and and tired, God promised he'll heal and renew. What's in your heart today? &gt;&gt; Where are you at with the Lord? I know myself. I've allowed things to come in, but here tonight, Lord, open my heart. Open my mind. Lord God, we're a needy people tonight. And Lord, we can get tired. We can get weary, Lord. And in this journey called life, we can be broken. We can be battered, Lord. We can get hard in heart, Lord. We can get to places where we're dry and thirsty, Lord. I know myself. I've been there, God. Oh, how I wish again to feel the presence of the Lord. Take the hardened heart, Lord. Take the broken here tonight. the weary in mind. These elders that have stood for your your gospel, Lord, your message year after year after year. Lord, lift up the feeble hands. Bring joy again, Lord. Bring singing within our sadness. Father, restore the joy of thy salvation as we heard this morning, Lord. create in me a clean heart. Take out the malice, Lord. Any grudges, anything that we've allowed to stay in the heart and that we've entertained, take it out, Lord. Perform surgery, Father, right now. Purify this heart. Make it new again, Lord. Make it fresh. Make it to where we're sensitive to your spirit again, Lord. Not hardened by the things of the world, but Lord, sensitive to when you drop in our room, our car, Lord, where when we're at work, the ladies are at home, Lord, taking care of the children, Lord, or the young people are needing an answer from you. In those times, Lord, may our hearts be receptive to your presence. And here tonight, Father, maybe it's just me, but I I feel you here tonight, Lord. And while you're here among us, I pray that we open up our hearts, be receptive to your presence, Lord. We thank you for your love and your mercy. for caring for us when we didn't feel worthy of it. Lord, being loved when we weren't lovable in the season of thanksgiving. May we always be thankful, Lord, for what you've done. For what you've done, Lord, the places that you've taken us from. Thank you, Lord. Amen. And amen. Can we sing that? Create in me a clean [singing] heart. Oh God, and renew and renew a right spirit within me. [singing] Create in me. Oh, [singing] create in me. Is that your prayer tonight? Yes, Lord, oh [singing] God. And renew and renew [singing] a right [music] spirit within me. [singing] Cast me not away.

Did you enjoy the word of the Lord? Amen. Brother Kovi just coming up and speaking his heart. You know, I ain't the smartest guy, but I can tell when the Lord's calling somebody. I can tell when he comes and he [music] takes two people that haven't talked. He takes a song leader that didn't even know he was leading songs here this evening and all of a sudden he begins to orchestrate things together. That's not for the individuals doing it. That's for the people that God's come to speak to. &gt;&gt; And I feel like the Lord's wanting to speak to some hearts here this evening. And we should be a privileged people to be sitting in front in his presence [music] &gt;&gt; and in that place to receive from him. &gt;&gt; I certainly enjoyed [music] that from brother Kobe. &gt;&gt; Guarding your heart. Amen. [applause] Amen. Just wonderful. It's wonderful. Amen. [music] Let's continue to sing that little song as we get ready to dismiss. [music] ever true. [music] Here's my heart.

Being able to come just take away the crustiness, Lord, for taking away and washing, Lord, our hearts pure with [music] your word. And Lord, and when we do so, Father, I would just ask, God, that we would just guard our hearts from malice or envy or guard our hearts from just anything that might be against your word or against your church. Lord Jesus, I would just pray, Lord, that these messages [music] that were spoke today would just come and it would just be with your people, Lord. And may we meditate upon these things while we drive, Lord. Or [music] Lord, as we walk or we just do our daily duties, Father, God, we know that you would like to speak to us. [music] And Lord, may we have the heart to respond to your presence. Father, as we get ready to leave this place, [music] Lord, may we ever, Lord, not be able to leave your presence, Lord.
