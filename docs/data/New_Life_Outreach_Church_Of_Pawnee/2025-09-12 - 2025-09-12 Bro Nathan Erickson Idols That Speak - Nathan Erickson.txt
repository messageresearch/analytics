Father, we've got a comrade that is that is down, Lord. And Lord hadn't even been able to leave his room in in over a month. And father, we're just asking that you would drop by his way tonight.

God bless you tonight. Amen. Let's just uh invite the Lord on the scene as we turn to the word of God. Psalm chapter 115. &gt;&gt; Well, tonight uh I don't know if any of you like to eat sushi. The thing about it, I I love sushi. The thing about it, it's it's fresh, &gt;&gt; but it's raw. &gt;&gt; Amen. Tonight, I just we're working through some things that are fresh to me, but I'm excited about them. And we're just asking that the Lord would just take it in his hands &gt;&gt; and put it together the way that he wants it tonight. Amen. Psalm chapter 115 verses 1 to8. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory. For thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? But our God is in the heavens. He hath done whatsoever he hath pleased. Watch this now. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but they speak not. Eyes have they, but they see not. They have ears, but they hear not. Noses have they, but they smell not. They have hands, but they handle not, and feet have they, but they walk not, neither speak they through their throat. And this is amazing to me. They that make them are like unto them. So is everyone that trusteth in them. Amen. And I I'd like to uh minister tonight on idols that speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we love you tonight, Lord, and we feel your presence in this place, Lord. Lord, more than anything, we just want to be out of your way, Lord, that that you, Lord, could speak a word tonight, Lord, through through frail human lips, Lord. Lord, that would strike a heart, Lord, and quicken something, Lord, to to life, Father, we could know who we are, Lord, how we're positioned, Lord, and what you're doing in this day, Father, and see it a little more clearly tonight. Lord, I I'm so inadequate tonight, Lord, but you're the allsufficient one, Lord. I I want to be in total surrender to you, Father. May it not only go for the speaker tonight, Lord, but for every hearer, Lord, for everyone that's gathered together, Lord, everyone, Lord, under the sound, Lord, of your word. I pray, Father, that we, Lord, would just be taken up in your hands, Father, that you would move in us, Lord, amongst us, and through us, Father, have your way. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you as you're seated tonight. Amen. Well, we've read this beautiful psalm about the idolatry of the heathen. Amen. And how that all of their gods are man-made things and they Amen. they they they uh they're beautiful. They're costly. They're made of silver and they're made of gold. But the scripture says they have eyes that cannot see, ears that cannot hear. Amen. And and and twice it's mentioned that uh that they have mouths but they do not speak. Amen. And uh and and you know uh there's there's a lot of idolatry that's happened in this world and in the in the human race. You know that brother Brandham teaches us that man is made to worship. He'll he'll worship anything. He'll bow and he'll scrape. He'll kiss a rock. He'll kiss a tree. Amen. He'll he'll he'll he'll do whatever he can to try to express uh the attribute of worship that is in him. Amen. And Amen. And and and so worship is is something that God has put into man. But the problem that we get to is when our worship, Amen, is placed in the wrong things and place and directed to the wrong place. Amen. and and uh you know we're taught that brother Bram said that an idol isn't just you know it's a little figure made out of silver or gold that you set on your desk or you know put in a shrine but he said an idol a real idol is anything how many know that comes between you and God anything between brother sister and you know uh you know and and and we're all we're all familiar with that in our Christian walk we get we get our priorities wrong sometimes and and we're always under that temptation there's a cycle of of humanity where where man is just always looking after the wrong things to worship and always pointing his worship in the wrong places. And surely a meeting like this is a time, you know, to consecrate ourselves and to examine our lives and look at our priorities and and say, "Lord, is there anything in my life that has come between me and you, Lord, because I I don't want anything between uh Amen. as the old song says, nothing between my soul and my savior." Amen. I I want that experience of being one with him, in communion with him. Amen. united with him, not having to go between any kind of a form of worship. Amen. Or or or having any idolatry in my life, but I want to be a restored worshipper. Amen. That's in a personal communion with God. Amen. And so, you know, there's all kinds of idols that people get running after. It could be worldly pleasures. It could be temptations. It could be pride. It could be all those kind of things. But, Amen. I, you know, I believe the biggest idols that we've got in the human race are the religious idols. And brother Brandon would call them denominations and creeds and traditions and Amen. things that uh that claim to to be set up for the worship of Jesus Christ, but the problem with them is that they're man-made. Amen. Amen. You know, a denomination is uh I it's a group, but it's not a group that God has made. It's a group that man has made. A creed, amen, is a good system of belief, but it's not a system of belief that God has revealed. It's something man has made. And you know a tradition is something that you know I it it can feel good and there can be a certain satisfaction in following our traditions but Amen. but traditions is not something God has put into place. It's something man has put into place. Amen. And the problem that we've had around the message is that there's been all kinds of idolatry that has happened even in our own message ranks. It would be sad to say that we've got a message which has come to restore the bride. Amen. Back to a personal fellowship with God. Amen. But then men would come behind that message. Amen. And once again put the shikina glory of God back behind the veil of tradition, back behind forms of amen of creeds and back behind denominational groups and back behind man's teachings and man-made structures and all of those kind of things, friends. And amen. We we've had all kinds of message idols. We've had doctrines, amen, that have come between us and God. We've had little cults and little isms that have come between us and God. Amen. There's been personalities that have risen up that would try to stand between us and God. Amen. Traditions that would try to cover up his presence and keep us away, amen, from the presence of God. But listen, friends, if you want to, Amen. If you really want to get somewhere with this message, Amen. when you come into this message, you got to leave all of your little idols behind you. You got to leave your opinions behind you. You got to leave your traditions behind you. You got to forget about the way it was growing up and the way your old pastor used to teach it and the way it was in your church and the way that you think about it. Amen. Amen. You've got to leave it behind you. Amen. To follow the message. Amen. Because the message came not to set up idols. It came to break idols. It came to destroy the works of the devil. It came to destroy man-made religion. Amen. It came to bring us out of the bondage of those things and put us back into a reality of a fellowship with God. Could you imagine? You know, uh, Moses built a tabernacle in the wilderness and in that little tent, Amen, was a room where a man could enter in there and he could come into the personal presence of the literal life of the God that created the universe. And could you imagine coming into that holy place and amen and coming into that just that that that holy and reverent presence and amen and walk into that tabernacle dragging your little Egyptian idol behind you. Amen. That friend, what a terrible thing that would be. But Amen. That's exactly what it is. Amen. When you try to take the message and keep your opinion and try to take the message and and carry on with an old tradition. Amen. You want a message, but you want a personality to stand between you and the God of the message. Amen. You want another king. You want another bishop. You want a Amen. It's idolatry, friends. Amen. But look, the message came for the breaking of idols. Brother Brandham stood in South Africa and he made an altar call. He manifested the supernatural presence of God. And he called on all the idol on all the pagans and all the heathens of South Africa. Amen. To throw down their idols, amen, and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. Brother Brand said when he made that call, there was a dust cloud, amen, that rose up in that place, amen, of idols being thrown down. Brother, sister, I've got a vision, amen, for this generation of message believers. I'd like to break some idols. Amen. I'd like to raise up some young believers. Amen. That won't fault bondage to the traditions of the elders. Amen. But they'll walk in the light of the word and be restored to fellowship with God. Amen. I I I'm an idol breaker. I'm an iconoclass. Amen. I don't I don't want a form. I don't want nothing man-made in my worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I don't want to worship a god through idolatry. I want to break some idols. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram told about the the one native there in Africa. Remember how he was a Christian man, but he packed his little idol? Amen. And it was that, you know what that idol was? It was the tradition of his elders. It was his daddy's idol. Amen. He said, "Daddy, use this idol." Amen. And it scared off a lion. So, I keep it just in case. I'm a Christian. I serve the Lord. I worship God. I worship Jesus Christ. But just in case, I take my little Aoya, my little idol around. Amen. So, if Aoya fails, remember he said, "But this little idol won't fail." Amen. But, brother, sister, I don't have a backup plan as a message believer of this day. I'm not holding on to something just in case. Amen. What we try to do is we take a message. We say, "I'll believe the message, but just in case it don't fix my marriage. I'll hold on to my book, and I'll hold on to my 12step program just in case there's not enough power in it to deliver me from my addiction. I'll hold on to my little program, and I'll hold on to my psychology." Amen. Just in case the prophet was wrong, I'll hold on to my understanding. I'll hold on to my private interpretation. Amen. But let there be a generation, amen, of idol smashing Christians that'll take up this message and say there is no backup plan. There is no just in case. This message is thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. And I will not have anything between me and this word. And I will not serve a man-made creed. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Amen. Just in case just in case I can't trust Brother Brandom. Amen. I I I'll trust my education. I'll trust my intellectual teacher. I'll trust my my great, you know, charismatic leader. I'll trust the guy who can explain it better. I'll tr Oh, Brother Brand said, "The worst kind of heathen there is is an educated heathen." Amen. It's not an ignorant pagan in a jungle somewhere. Amen. It's an educated man who thinks that he's got the intelligence. He thinks he's got the answers. Amen. But friends, I don't have an answer. I don't have one thought coming, but I've got a God. Amen. And he's not a dead idol. He's a God that speaks. He's a God, amen, that that that uh that speaks in this day. I've got a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, there's been so much wasted energy, so much wasted effort in our own ranks &gt;&gt; on idol building &gt;&gt; cuz you know, a lot of effort goes into making an idol. Idols are beautiful, brother, sister. Idols are not something you don't just kind of hack it together out of 2x4s and, you know, and just make a little uh cut out of cardboard or plywood and make that your idol. Amen. No, there's there's sacrifice that goes into idol making. There's works that goes into it. There's beauty that go into it. Amen. But at the end of the day, it's still just the work of men's hands. How many know it's just the work of men's hands? You know, Paul Paul, he taught us in the book of Hebrews about the ministration of death and the ministration of life. Amen. Amen. And so there's two kinds of ministries. There's the ministry of death under a dead law, a dead letter. And there's a ministry of life under the spirit. Amen. But he said, "But the ministration of death is glorious. It's beautiful." Look, friends, dead Christianity is beautiful. Amen. Dead religion is beautiful. You say, "What do you mean, Brother Nathan?" Amen. I mean, I mean, I mean, people Amen. serve a dead god with a beautiful Christianity, with beautiful churches, beautiful communities, beautiful preaching, beautiful songs, beautiful sermons. Amen. But can you imagine, Amen, uh uh spending all your life, Amen, trying to make something beautiful and you're just a minister of death. And we've had a lot of ministry, Amen, around the message that has ministered nothing but death. Amen. By bringing their man-made ideas, man-made traditions into a living word, friends. Amen. It's beautiful. It's beautiful death. It'll Amen. If you take this message and you take a living God out of it, it'll still make you a beautiful church. It'll still make you a beautiful community. It'll still make you beautiful preaching, beautiful singing. And Amen. beautiful worship. It'll be a beautiful idol. Amen. But look, friends, the problem with a dead idol, the scripture says the ones that worship dead idols are just like them. Amen. And if all you got in your life is a God that can't speak, hands that can't handle, eyes that can't see, ears that can't hear, you're going to be just like the dead god that you live. It'll be dead men worshiping a dead god under a dead creed under a dead tradition. Hallelujah. Amen. But there's a ministry of life. Amen. The ministry of the spirit. Amen. Which has brought us into a reality. &gt;&gt; That's the problem with dead religion. It's beautiful, but it doesn't speak. Amen. When you get down in a dark trial, your old dead religion, amen, isn't going to give you an answer. Amen. It can't give you comfort. It can't give you leadership. It can't bring you deliverance cuz it can't speak. Amen. It's just a dumb old man-made religion. That's all you got as a church member. That's all you got as a as a carnal message believer. You say, "Brother Nathan, I dress right. Yeah, it's beautiful." Amen. I talk right. It's beautiful. I go to the right church. I got the right kind of pastor. I believe God sent a prophet. That's beautiful, friends. But it might still be dead. Amen. But God sent a message. Amen. To minister life to the hearer. &gt;&gt; Life. Amen. &gt;&gt; To put us back in touch with a God that speaks. Brother Bam said heathens, they bow down. They worship their idol and they prostrate themselves and they work it up in their minds that that idol's talking to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he said that's contrary. That's just that's exactly turned around of what God is. Amen. God doesn't deal with idols. Here we go now. You are his instrument. You prostrate yourself before God and he comes in you and he speaks out to the people. That's the difference. That's the difference. Say, "What's the difference, brother Nathan, between this message and any other denomination? What's different between me and a Pentecostal? What's the difference between me and a Baptist? What's the difference between me, Amen, and any of these other groups, Amen. The difference is, Amen. when you are his instrument through this message that Amen. He's a living God for a living person. He's not a dead creed for a dead Christianity. He's a living God for a living person. Not a dead god to a dead idol, but a living God to a living being. Amen. Friends, I wherever you're at in your life, you may have you may not know anything but a dead idol. Your Christianity might just amount to a to a stone. Amen. Just a stone statue. Amen. Of a god that you can imagine. You can picture him in your mind. You can you can put a a certain image to him, but he's never spoken to you. Is he's got eyes that have never seen you. Amen. They never beheld you in your condition. Ears that can't hear your cries. Amen. Ears that can't hear your prayers. Amen. But oh my. But but when when the message came, it brought us a God that speaks. And I say, if the dead idol has a dead worshipper that's just like the idol he worships, what about a living God, Amen, with a Amen. What about a God that speaks? Well, then you've got a man with a message. If there's a God that speaks, there's going to be a worshshiper that speaks. He's got a word. He's got a message. He's got something to say. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what you are. You're a man with a message. You're you're God's letter. Brother Bram said, "You're a written epistle. &gt;&gt; A written epistle. God is in you, manifesting himself through you." And he said, "And you are a living idol of God, a living representative of God, walking around with God speaking through your lips to others." &gt;&gt; Amen. Wasn't it true in Ezekiel 36? Amen. God said, "You might have tablets of stone that have my word." He said, "But I've got something more for you than that old dead letter. I've got something more for you than a ministry that'll kill you. Amen. And put you to death, Amen. and punish you and send you to hell and send you to punishment and put you under condemnation." He said, "My word will not always be carved into stone." Amen. But one day, amen, I will carve it on the fleshly tables of the heart. Amen. That's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is. God didn't write his Amen. God didn't write his word just in a book. Amen. Or on a stone tablet, but he's writing it and inscribing it on the hearts of living, breathing Christian sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; You got something to say. That's what it means to be a living epistle. Amen. It means you don't have a dead letter. You got one that speaks. You got one that lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got one that moves. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's what that's what I am. I'm a living epistle. You say, "Brother Nathan, are you in the message?" Oh, it's better than that, brother. The message is in me. Amen. He wrote it in my heart. It was inscribed there. I had a part in it before the foundation of the world. And now I am here not to worship a dead figure of a God, but to carry his word in my heart and be a living, breathing image of the almighty God, &gt;&gt; a restored son, &gt;&gt; manifested child of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, that's that's the kind of word that we've got to have. We can we can we can uh mess around with this message. We can talk about tapes. We can quote our quotes. We can argue about our doctrines. Amen. We can try to ram it down people's throat. Try to get them to adopt a a lifestyle. Try to bring them under a standard. Amen. And force people into a form. Amen. But all of that is just the ministry of death. Amen. But through the ministry of life, through the ministry of the spirit. Amen. Amen. That look friends, we got more of a word than that. It's not a dead letter. How many know the highest form of the word is when the word is made flesh? Sure, God wrote his word in the heavens. Sure, he wrote it in the Bible. Amen. Sure, he wrote it through the messages of messengers and prophets down through the ages. But the highest form of his word, Amen, is when he takes it off the tablet. Amen. And he puts it, amen, and writes it on the fleshly tables of a heart in a living, breathing &gt;&gt; Christian, &gt;&gt; a son or daughter of God. That's the highest form of the word &gt;&gt; is a word made flesh. Well, then why has there been so much why have we had so much arguing around the message? Why, as brother Matthew preached last night, why is there so much fussing? Why do we have to rise above so much uh Amen. so much friction and so much turmoil, so much doubt and unbelief and all these kind of things? Because the devil doesn't want you to see the message in its true form. &gt;&gt; He wants to see you. He wants you to see it as a tradition. He wants you to see it as a teaching. He wants to see it as the way we believe it in my church versus the way we believe it in their church. He wants you to see it as an argument. He wants you to see it as a doctrine. He don't care how you see it. He just doesn't want you to see it in his true form. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preached Christianity versus idolatry. He began to quote Ireneius. Amen. And when he preached against heresies and Ireinia said what a false teacher does, he said it's just like if they made a beautiful statue of a king and they made it out of all precious gems and precious stones and put it together in the beautiful image of a king. Amen. But he said what the false teacher does, he takes those jewels and he begins to rearrange them. Amen. He begins to look it he's it's it's still jewels. It's still valuable. It's still powerful. It's just in the wrong form. Amen. That's what that's what men have done with this message. They take the quotes, they take the scriptures, but they put it in the wrong form cuz they're trying to put it in the image of what they have in their mind. Amen. That's how they deceive you cuz it's a real true message and it's a real true word. Amen. But you got to see it in the form that it was intended. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Brother Brand said, when you try to make the word of God say something to fit your organization, look, friends, I'm here to preach tonight. We're all guilty. Come on now. Amen. Every one of us have read have read the message or listen to it and brother Brandon will say something and it's just a little bit different than the way we wish he would have said it. It's just a little bit leaning in a way that we're uncomfortable with. So we want to gloss right over it. And we went to But friends, don't rearrange the word. Don't ever misplace it. Don't ever misuse it. Don't misrepresent it. God had an image in mind when he sent the word. &gt;&gt; Let's look at what that image is. You're trying to make it say something to fit your organization. You're taking jewels out of the great king's body and you're making an image of a dog or a fox or a hog or something out of it. And you deceive the ignorant of the word. But brother Brand said, "Hallelujah. There's some who have the spirit of God and they stand for the word incarnate." &gt;&gt; How many know what incarnate means? They stand for the word in flesh. Amen. The word in flesh. I know we've taught this message every which kind of way. We've represented every we twisted it in every different kind of shape. Amen. But the message I believe and the message I'm looking for is a message that's made flesh. Not something we can argue about. Not something to swap quotes and try to prove how spiritual we are. But a living breathing Amen. living breathing sons and daughters of God manifested with power and life and reality. That's the correct image friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. People take this word and and what do they do? They'll say, "Look at how spiritual I am. Look at how deep my teaching. I'm going to take this message. I'm going to snatch it out of your hands and I'm going to wrap it up and I'm going to rearrange it into a bunch of mysteries that are so far beyond you. You'll never reach it. Maybe if you come to my church and pay tithe for 50 years, maybe then you'll get the revelation." Amen. But look, friends. Amen. You can Amen. And so they they'll preach and they'll teach and they'll get a big crowd together. Amen. and quote their quotes, but it never quite takes shape. Amen. And too many people been spending too much time, Amen, trying to follow after an idolatrous version of the message of the hour that never takes shape. It never quite gets there. It never quite delivers on the promise. But I'm a living witness. Amen. That the spirit of God, Amen, is alive today. If you can get rid of your tradition, if you can pierce the veil, &gt;&gt; you can see him. You can see him in his true form. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word incarnate. Amen. This message is not a mystery cult. Amen. God didn't send a message so a bunch of deep anointed teachers could wrap it up in a bunch of mysterious bondage and keep it back from you. That's not the mystery of the message. A mystery is a previously hidden truth. Amen. I agree that the word used to be mysterious, but not since God sent a prophet. Hallelujah. You say, "Well, then what's the mystery to it all, Brother Nathan? It's this mystery among the Gentiles. It's Christ not in heaven, not wrapped up behind a veil. Christ in you, the hope of glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, if I could ever if I could ever just press my way. Oh, brother Nathan, if I could just get smart enough, if I could just get educated enough, Amen. to understand the secrets of this message." Brother man said, "Here's the secret. The word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have to worship an idol. You don't have to have a god or a message that can't speak. The word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; It's speaking. Every time &gt;&gt; you get around the bride, &gt;&gt; it's speaking because you're a member of the bride. Christ is in you, friends. Amen. That's the masterpiece. That's what you got to do with the word. It's not just get all It's not just believe the scripture. Amen. It's not just believe the quotes. Amen. but to see it put together in the form that the master intended. And I believe in a masterpiece message. I believe that God had something in mind. Amen. When he sent his word down to fallen man. Amen. He was building towards something. He was he was creating something, molding something, putting something together. And you're the jewel. You're that blood red ruby. Amen. That he died for. Amen. To pluck you out of this world and put you into that form. You're part of his body. You're part of the image. You're part of the masterpiece. Amen. How many How many know the bride is God's masterpiece? Brother Bam said, "You're his victory. Oh, you're his achievement." Amen. You are what he has envisioned. &gt;&gt; You're the reason he sent every prophet. You're a You're the reason he raised up apostles. You're the reason he raised up a five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are his masterpiece. Brother Nathan, I couldn't be his idol. I I can't I I look I I believe there's somebody out there. Somebody somebody must be that masterpiece bride. But it can't be me, brother Nathan, because I have so many flaws and I'm struggling with things and I I I'm in a battle and I'm dealing with this and dealing with that. Amen. But how many know it's the flaw that makes the masterpiece? That's why we go through things in this life. That's why we're tested and tried and tempted on every hand. Amen. Why? Cuz God has a form. God has an image he's trying to achieve. So, he's got to mold you. He's got to chip away at you. Amen. And sometimes he strikes out with that chisel. Amen. He begins to peck away at your at your life. But look, he's not removing the real you. He's just removing everything in between. It's just getting that dead rock off of you. Getting that dead idolatry off of you. Amen. To bring you into the image that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he smites you for a different reason. Amen. That that's the way it is. Sometimes we go through things, say, "God, why have you why are you striking me? Why am I being punished? What have I done wrong?" Amen. But that's not always why he's striking it, Brother Colby. Amen. But sometimes things will go wrong. Faith will get into it. Trial. Amen. But it's not God's punishment. Amen. But he took the he Amen. It's because he's brought us to a place where he wants to take the hammer and strike his masterpiece and say, "Now speak. Speak. You're so close to what I had in mind. You're so close to what I'm trying to achieve. Speak something. &gt;&gt; Speak to your trial. Amen. I I know you suffered a blow, but now speak. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, church? &gt;&gt; Christ is in you, bride, &gt;&gt; making you an idol that speaks. The Bible says, "I am the Lord. That is my name. And my glory will I not give to another." Amen. neither my praise to graven images. Amen. And yet a message is telling you, amen, that God wants to pour his glory into you and make you the very tabernacle of his glory. You're the image through which his glory is expressed. Well, how could this be? Amen. When the Bible says he doesn't share his glory with anybody, he won't share with a graven image. Well, it's not that kind of idol. Amen. Look, friends, Amen. If your name is Mrs. Methodist, Amen. You're not going to see his glory. If your name is Mrs. Pentecostal, you're not going to see his glory. If your name is Mrs. Message Believer, you're still not going to see his glory. But there's a Mrs. Jesus Christ which has been caught out of the dust of the earth in this day. And God has formed himself a bride. Amen. It's not robbery. Amen. For her to lay claim to his glory. It's not robbery to carry out his ministry. &gt;&gt; It's not evil. It's not robbery to speak through the voice of the son of man as a member of this bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you're bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, likeness of his likeness, image of his image, heart of his heart, spirit of his spirit, and life of his life. &gt;&gt; You're him. &gt;&gt; That's why we have a hope of glory today. Look, my hope of glory is not in this tabernacle of humiliation. Amen. It's not in this. Not in this corruptible body, but my hope of glory is in a quickening power. Amen. But the quickening power is for this mortal body. The quickening power is not for the millennium. It's not to make me a king and a priest there, but it's to come into this fallen flesh. Amen. This fallen tabernacle of humiliation and make it the house of the glory of God. Amen. God, look, friends, if you got a lot of flaws, God knows how to rub out your flaws. God knows how to shape you. God knows how to make you what he wanted you to be. &gt;&gt; God doesn't need your perfection. He just needs your submission. &gt;&gt; Amen. See? Amen. You're Mrs. Jesus. The bride and her husband are one. That's the kind of idol you are. See, you're not a dead idol. You're not a You're not an idol like the pagan has cuz you're not an object of worship. Amen. You're just a place of worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're just a place. Amen. You're just a vessel. Amen. You're you're you're not God, but you're the vessel that he shows up in. Amen. You're you're not you're not anything glorious. Amen. But you're the place where the glory comes down. Amen. You're the you're the you're the source of the river of life. Amen. You're you're a capstone bride. You're seated at the throne. Out of your belly flows a river of living water. &gt;&gt; You were created and raised up and formed to show forth the glory of God. &gt;&gt; You're not an object of worship. You're just a place of of worship. So that's what it is, brother Elijah. Amen. Because you were an elected seed of God. Amen. That capstone came and hovered down over your life. Amen. And that baptism of the Holy Ghost came down and it sealed you into the kingdom of God as a son. And it made you a partaker of the divine nature. And when that Holy Ghost came in, Amen. It cleared, Amen, the space of your life, amen, into amen, it cleared out all your sin. It cleared out all your shame. It cleared out all condemnation and made you a partaker of the divine nature. But let me tell you something. God doesn't want an empty lot. Amen. That's not why he redeemed you. It wasn't just to clear away all your old nature. It wasn't just to clear away all your sin. But God's got a building project. Amen. So that capstone will never leave your life. It'll be your guide. It'll be your inside teacher. Amen. And it'll hover over your life. Amen. But then line upon line, precept upon precept, revelation by revelation, amen, the Holy Ghost, Brother Bram said, radiates down out of that capstone. Amen. Onto that onto that foundation of faith. And it'll add to your faith virtue. And it adds to your virtue knowledge. And it'll add to knowledge, temperance. Add add to temperance, patience, and godliness. And Amen. And brotherly kindness. Amen. And so God has a building project. Now, the beautiful thing is it's his project. Amen. God didn't give you the Holy Ghost. Amen. And then say, "Well, if you make it through my sevenstep plan, then you can be sealed into the kingdom of God." No, he sealed. Amen. The He sealed all the potential into you as a seed of God when he quickened you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And it's not you that adds virtue to faith. The Holy Ghost adds virtue to faith. The Holy Ghost adds knowledge. The Holy Ghost adds all these things. [Applause] It's God's project. God doesn't need you to figure it out. God doesn't need you to be a great builder. He doesn't need you to provide the material. He doesn't need you to provide the plan. He's got the plan. He's got the power. &gt;&gt; He just needs your submission. &gt;&gt; And so that capstone begins. See, you think, well, it's a capstone bringing me up to him. No, no, no. It's a capstone getting you ready so that he can come down into you. Because brother Brandham said, "What do you have when you have the stature of a perfect man? What have you produced? A living tabernacle of a living God." That's the kind of Christianity I want. I want enough Christ in me, Amen, that my neighbor knows I'm a Christian. That my coworker knows I'm a Christian. Amen. That there's something radiating out of me, amen, that I'm not just trying to climb my way up to where God is, but I'm the kind of Christian where God can come down and inhabit this vessel and speak through this dumb idol. Amen. and give me a voice. Give me a message. Give me a ministry. &gt;&gt; Give me a testimony. &gt;&gt; He's bringing himself down to you into the living tabernacle of the living God. That's what's that's why we're walking with the message of the hour. That's why we're preaching it with everything that we know cuz we recognize what God is doing today. Amen. Is God doesn't have us sitting on our hands talking about miracles that happened in prayer lines 60 years ago. Amen. But God is building a house. God, there's a building project going on. Brother man says God never stops. He's always going upward. He's always building it up. He's always advancing. He's always progressing. And what is he building? He's building the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I thank God for a five-fold ministry that'll preach the message and keep their ideas out of it, keep their opinion out of it. Amen. Because we're not here to build our own house. We're here to build God's house. Amen. And if you'll if you'll stay true to the message, the message will stay true to you. Who art thou mountain before Zerubbable? Amen. There's a ministry on the earth today. Amen. That has got a commission. Amen. To build, Amen, the bride that was promised by the message of the hour. Amen. That's why I don't believe we get in a pulpit and try to beat everybody down. Amen. And just try to take the word of God and whip people with it, kill people with it. Amen. Condemn them with it. I'm trying to build the bride. That's the end time evangelism. Build her up. Amen. Lift her up. If she's in a mess, Amen. lift her up. If she's in darkness, bring her light. Bring her hope. Bring her faith. Cuz God's trying to build something. We're not a demolition crew. Look, I got a hammer in one hand. And that hammer is for building. That hammer is for heing stones. To build God a temple. Amen. To restore the tabernacle. And in the other hand, I got a sword. And the sword is not for my brother. The sword is not for the sheep. The sword is for the predator. The sword is for the enemy. Amen. I believe we got enough of a message. We can fight the devil and build our brother at the same time. Amen. Pick up your sword. Pick up your hammer. Let's build God a house. &gt;&gt; There's a message to preach. There's a ministry to preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what this five-fold ministry is. Ephesians 4 said it's for the perfecting of the saints, &gt;&gt; for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ until what? Until we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man. &gt;&gt; A perfect man. Amen. Are you the perfect man? Am I the perfect man? Is the preacher the perfect man? No. No. Christ is the perfect man. Amen. But God sent you a ministry. Amen. to take to take a message over the pulpit and try to tell you, Amen. You're not somebody foreign to Christ. Amen. As the bride of Christ, you're identified in Christ. You're as holy as he's holy. You're as righteous as he's righteous. You're as powerful as he's powerful. Rich as he is rich. &gt;&gt; Amen. Perfect as he is perfect &gt;&gt; because you're identified in that capstone &gt;&gt; unto a the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. But let me tell you this. I don't believe the message was sent just to raise up a bunch of superhuman preachers that we could all sit in a pew and admire. Amen. No, there's a furtherance than that. He did raise up a five-fold ministry to raise us up into the stature of the fullness of Christ. Amen. And then further down in the chapter, he says, "Then we'll grow up into him in all things." Amen. God don't want you to sit and cross your arms and listen to a preacher. He wants you to grow. Amen. He wants to build you up. He wants you to be a house. He wants you to have a voice that you would grow up in him in all things which is the head even Christ. And then watch now when you grow up into Christ then the Bible says the whole body is joined together and every joint supply. Amen. Yeah. Look friends, there's nobody in this bride that's not a jewel in the body of Christ. Amen. If you're a member of this bride, I don't care if you stand in a pulpit or sweep a rug. Amen. Or clean a toilet or shake a hand or hold a door. Amen. You're a jewel in God's economy. Amen. You are priceless in his eyes. And you're part of the revelation of Christ in this day. It's not just for preachers. It's not just for prophets. Amen. God, amen, wants idols in the pew that can speak the message. He wants you in your workplace speaking the word. He wants you in school speaking the word. He wants you out in the street speaking the word. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; The message is not just for pulpit. &gt;&gt; The message is for the world. It's for every nation and tongue. It's a light in a dark place. Amen. He wants to make you &gt;&gt; a lighthouse, &gt;&gt; a tabernacle, &gt;&gt; a church. &gt;&gt; That's why I love this message. &gt;&gt; I love this message. Amen. Because it brings a revelation that no other church, no other organization, no other teaching can bring. Amen. I know what deity looks like in Jonathan Martin, and I love to see it. I've seen deity work through Ronnie Long. I've seen deity work through through Matthew McGary. Amen. But I want to know what deity looks like in Micaiah. I want to find out what does deity look like. Amen. When it speaks through Judah. Amen. What what does deity look like in in a shame? What does it look like in a puit? What does it look like in appear? Amen. What does it look like? Amen. Well, it does not yet appear what we shall be. But I tell you what, under the light of this message, it's becoming more clear all the time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's a privilege to stand in a pulpit and look out at the image of what God was thinking about before the foundation of the world. Say, "What do I do with this message?" Speak it, live it, show it forth. &gt;&gt; Become its tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Don't make it an idol. &gt;&gt; It's a living reality. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What does deity look like in you? Amen. I believe in deity speaking, &gt;&gt; not just through a prophet, &gt;&gt; through a bride. I want to hear deity speak in an Oklahoma accent. &gt;&gt; Amen. What does deity from Panee sound like? &gt;&gt; What does deity from Ohio? What does deity from Kansas? What does it sound like, brother Sam? What does it look like? What a message. Amen. It's a chance to find out. Hallelujah. I want to find out what deity looks like in Nathan Ericson. What does it sound like? How does it preach? How does it live? What's it here to do? I don't want to be a dead believer. Amen. I don't want to be a dumb idol. I want to speak. &gt;&gt; I want to express all the potential &gt;&gt; that he had in his mind when he planted that seed &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. Look friends, I know the stature of the perfect man pertains to the church. It pertains to the seven church ages. But brother man makes it very clear that it's not just to the church or the church age, but it's to the individual. It's not just the church as a body that's a tabernacle of his presence. It's the individual that's a tabernacle of his glory. Hallelujah. Brother Brand said, "Look, God never sent me to build an organization." I'll say it again, friends. God didn't send a message so we could talk about it. So we could build our little groups, so we could rise raise up little isms. So we could organize it. So we could run with traditions. Amen. He didn't send it for that. God sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be a powerhouse and the dwelling place of his spirit. How many believe quickening power was in the apostles? How many believe quickening power was in William Brandham? How many believe quickening power is in the hands of the five-fold ministry to lay hands upon the sick? Amen. But do you believe and can you see and can you hear the message that quickening power is in your body? Amen. By the message of the hour, God has given you a voice. God has given you power. Make you a powerhouse. Store something in you. &gt;&gt; A dwelling place of the spirit by his word. Amen. And I know deity was in Jesus, but God didn't want to keep all the deity in Jesus. So he said, "All that was in Christ, he poured into William Brandham." &gt;&gt; No, that ain't the scripture. All that was in Christ, he poured into seven messengers and 12 apostles. &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe Stephen, maybe he maybe him, too. All that was in Christ, he poured into the church. Amen. He had this Holy Spirit without measure, but thank God I've got a measure tonight. There's a lick of that fire that belongs to me. And I, as an individual, Amen. I'm not going to hide it under a bushel. I'm going to let it shine. Amen. I'm going to speak this word. I'm going to be part of the utterance. Hallelujah. Friends, you know, this is a real nice church. Amen. A beautiful building. I thank God for blessing you with it. But I hate to tell you this. This isn't a Holy Ghost tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said there's no such thing as a Holy Ghost tabernacle. He said, "But it's individuals that come into this church. They are Holy Ghost tabernacles. They are tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost, not the church in a body or a group." &gt;&gt; Amen. But a Holy Ghost tabernacle is an individual who has received the Holy Spirit into their life, been a partaker of the divine nature, and they're walking in the light of the word for their day &gt;&gt; and expressing the image that was in God's mind for the individual. This is a great meeting, brother friend, brother, sister. Amen. I'm so I'm so honored and I'm so grateful to be a partaker of this meeting, to speak of this meeting. But I want to say this, this isn't a Holy Ghost meeting. Amen. And see, because a Holy Ghost meeting isn't something we do as a group, but a Holy Ghost meeting is when an individual comes to the meeting, comes to the conference, and you sit in your pew as the message goes forth. Amen. And you hear a voice. Amen. Cuz you're not serving a dead God with ears that can't hear. Amen. Amen. You got a God that can hear you. That's why you can hear him. Hallelujah. Amen. It's a God that can speak &gt;&gt; and you can speak, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I didn't come to this meeting to find God. I brought God. Amen. And everybody that's a Holy Ghostborn. Amen. Son or daughter of God. Amen. Wherever they go, they take God with them. Amen. You didn't come to this meeting to find Jesus. Amen. You brought that lick of fire with you. Amen. It's your individual experience, your individual anointing, your individual quickening. Oh, but what happens when we bring it all together? Brother Ram said, "Your lick of fire plus my lick of fire plus her lick of fire plus his lick of fire, it brings the pillar of fire." Amen. Together back in the building. I'm trying to tell you tonight, if you're looking for the place to meet God, this is the place. This is where it happens. Amen. When spiritborn sons and daughters of God bring their anointing together, it reproduces the life of Christ on the scene. If you need healing, this is where healing happens. If you need deliverance, this is where deliverance happens. If you got questions, this is where they get answered. &gt;&gt; It's here, friends. It's here. We're not here just to put our put our heads together. Let's put God together. This is where it happens. Jesus said, "Oh, they'll say low here, low there. Move to Jeffersonville. Go move to that church. Go hear that preacher." Amen. Brother Nathan, he's all right. But if so and so had come to the meeting, Amen. then we really could receive something from the Lord. Look friends, the only reason I'd preach this, Amen, because there's really no jealousy in my heart to say it. But it's just that it's the truth. Amen. It it doesn't matter so much who's in the pulpit. If as long as it's a gift, amen, that God's put in the body. It don't matter what church we gather. It don't matter how big the crowd is. It don't matter whether the specials were in tune or not. It doesn't matter. What matters is that we brought God with us. Amen. And when we come together, Amen. We don't come to worship a dead idol, but we worship the same pillar of fire that inhabited the tabernacle in the wilderness. The same pillar of fire that inhabited Jesus Christ, inhabits these individuals, inhabits this church, inhabits this meeting. He's in the room. [Applause] Jesus said, "Don't say low here, oh low there." He said, "The kingdom of God is within you." &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you, it's here. &gt;&gt; It's right here. Where's my answer, Brother Nathan? Right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where where's my Where's the power that I need? It's right here. &gt;&gt; For this commandment which I commande, it's not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It's not in heaven that thou should have say, "Who's going to go up in heaven and bring it down?" It's not beyond the sea. But the word is nigh thee. It's in thy mouth and in thy heart. Amen. Look, friends, I'm not waiting for a prophet, amen, to come flying across the sea to bring me my revival and to bring me my power and to put me in my position. The word is already in me. It's in my heart and it's in my mouth. Amen. I'm not waiting for the Amen. for the blessings to fall out of heaven. Amen. It's already in me. It's in my heart and it's in my mouth. Amen. I'm preaching the message tonight and the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always. &gt;&gt; Always. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you've got to find the place. That's the very that's the key to it all. You want to know a living God, you want to you want to experience a living reality, you just got to find the right place. Cuz God won't meet you just anywhere. He won't meet you in your opinion. He won't meet you in your tradition. Brother Brham said he'll meet you in one provided place. Over and over, Brother Brham preached God's provided way. But one last time, right before he passed off the scene, he preached the message, God's only provided place of worship. And you know where you know where that place is? It's where his name is. &gt;&gt; Look friends, the name of Jesus Christ is not a talisman. It's not an abracadabra that we wave in the room. Amen. The name of Jesus Christ, it's a nature. It's a life. It's a token. Amen. It's a reality. It's a spirit. Amen. Where is it today? It's not in heaven. It's not across the sea. It's in the bride of Christ. Moses didn't he didn't just carry the word as a dead letter. Amen. But Moses fulfilled his ministry cuz he made God a place. Moses made a place and our prophet made a place. Hallelujah. Moses made a place for God in a tabernacle. And God made a place in Christ. But Christ made a place in the church, in the heart of the individual. Jesus made a place in the bride. Oh friends, you got to come to that place. &gt;&gt; You can't just join a church. &gt;&gt; You can't just call yourself a message believer. You can't just put a picture on the wall and a sign out by the road and think that you bear the name of Christ. Amen. There's only one name given under heaven by the whereby men may be saved. It's not the name of William Brandham. It's not the name of Wayne Lawson or Wenda Martin. Amen. It's not it's not any man's name. It's the name of Jesus Christ. And how do you get into Christ? By one spirit. Amen. Only the five-fold ministry is born. By one spirit, the prophet by one spirit we are all born baptized into the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Bam said, look in that heavenly city, that new Jerusalem. Amen. He said, look, he said, every religion in the world has got temples. Everybody. Amen. The the the Hindus got temples. Buddhists got temples. Christians got churches. Uh Muslims got mosques. Everybody's got a temple. But did you notice he said in that city there won't be any temple? There's no church there. There's no cathedral there. There's no sanctuary there. Amen. Because the Bible says the Lord God and the Lamb is the temple of that city. Brother Brand said, "The Lamb is the light." The Lamb is the temple. The Lamb is the throne. The Lamb is the light. Amen. The life. He is that temple. Amen. And all of these other temples have an object that they're worshiping. But in our city, he is the object. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he is with his people. &gt;&gt; The most high God. He doesn't dwell in tabernacles made with hands. Amen. And friends. Amen. The message is not a slightly better church with slightly better doctrine and slightly prettier churches and a slightly bitter congregation and a and a and a slightly nicer community. Amen. That God doesn't dwell in that kind of a tabernacle. But if you could see the message. Amen. I know we've heard it before. I know we've heard it preached. But if you could just hear it tonight like it was for the first time, Amen. that for 2,000 years men worshiped a dead idolatrous Christianity. Amen. But in the evening time, the light came. Amen. He was kicked out of the church. He was kicked out of denomination. But he came knocking on your door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if you'll just let him in, if you'll let the message introduce you to this Christ, Amen. you'll find out that you Amen. have come into fellowship with the most high God. &gt;&gt; And if we could see the message that way, amen, that he's the most high God. He's deserving of preeminence. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you, he's higher than who's got the best church. He's higher than who's got the most anointed ministry. He's higher than who's the best singer. He's higher than who's the greatest teacher. He's higher than the argument. He's higher than worldly pleasures. He's higher than your idol. He's higher than your opinion. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the most high God &gt;&gt; dwelling in the bride of Jesus Christ. You can't lift him high enough. Amen. You can't make him great enough. Amen. All we can do is give him the preeminence. Amen. Say, "God, forget my opinion. God, forget my preference. Forget my will. Thy will be done. Because I want to be a tabernacle of the most high God. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be a man-made dwelling place. I want to be the temple of his glory. I want to be a tabernacle. I want the kind of experience with God. Amen. Where I can be the bride of Jesus Christ, the only true church of this age. You realize friends that if a man or a woman that if a human being wants to find God and find where he's manifesting himself, there's only one provided place and that is the bride of Jesus Christ. You are the place man comes to worship. You are the ma the place man comes to mean God. Amen. Brother Br said, "You're the only Bible most people will ever read. You're the only church service they'll ever attend. You're the only preacher they'll ever hear. &gt;&gt; Oh, then lift him high. Give him the preeminence. &gt;&gt; You got to worship at the right altar. &gt;&gt; You're trying to worship a God that's a million miles away in space. &gt;&gt; Somebody asked Brother Brandon said, "How could Jesus how could you Jesus be speaking on earth and then and you know and be and also be in heaven and and who was he praying to if he was a if he wasn't a separate person of the Godhead? And who? What? Oh, brother Bram said, he said, "Now, brother, do you have the Holy Ghost? Do you talk to him? Do you worship him? Do you fellowship with him?" He said, "That's all I need to hear." Amen. Who did Jesus pray to? He prayed to the God that was within him. And when you see this message, right, you won't pray to a God of 2,000 years ago. You won't call on a God that's up in outer space somewhere. You won't call to a God of history. Amen. But you'll find out that the most high God is very, very near to where you are. You don't have to shout to wake him up. Brother Ram said, you just call on the master. Amen. In the middle of your storm, you wake him up cuz he's not on the other side of the sea. He's in your boat. &gt;&gt; You can wake up Jesus tonight. Well, if I have that access to if I have access like that to the presence of God, I want to wake him up tonight. Amen. I I I want to get in touch with God. I don't want to just have another meeting. I want this to be the most life-changing, spiritfilled, Amen. power flowing down from heaven. Amen. The the greatest meeting I've ever been a part of. Amen. Because I want to realize, Amen. that God's not in the group. &gt;&gt; God is in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is in my voice to speak to my mountain and ask whatever I will. &gt;&gt; Worship at the right altar, friends. Brother Bram said, "Look, the message that's the message, you don't have to stay 63 and after. Go all the way back to 1949, deity of Jesus Christ." Brother Bram tell you that the devil is trying to make you some kind of a coward down. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some trying to hide you back. Tell you that you're some little something. But he said, "But you're sons and daughters of God." And he said, "Deity, deity is not in heaven." Amen. He said, "Deity is in you." Amen. Jesus said, "My life give I you Zoe life." Not a slightly better life. Not a life of a church member. Not the life of a creed follower, but my life, my token, my literal Zoey life, my attributes, my presence, my power, my voice is in you. &gt;&gt; That's the true altar. &gt;&gt; Deity is not in heaven. Deity is in the bride of Jesus Christ. that. And so there's where the true altar is. Amen. If you're trying to take this message and look at it in a way that puts God way over there or just puts him in a preacher or just puts him in a prophet, you haven't seen the message yet. Amen. But if you can see it right, friends, you'll recognize you don't have to travel to where the altar is. But you are the altar of his presence. And the Holy Ghost has come as a consuming fire. Amen. to burn up the sacrifice of your life and make you the shakina glory. Make you the ark of his presence. Make you the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "It's God dwelling in you with your temperament." &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, I know it sounds awful, but it's right." &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we go a little further now? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, friends, that's the altar I worship God. Amen. The message brought me to an altar. Amen. I I I don't have to go far to find him. I don't have to look anywhere else. I worship at the altar of the bride manifestation. I know it starts to sound heretical. I know it starts to I know it starts to make the flesh just the hair just stand on its head. Amen. To begin to speak things like that. Amen. That look, Amen. God's not in a group. God's not in a church or in an organization, but he's in me. But that's where the devil always falls back. Amen. The devil can go so far, but he can't go to Pentecost. Amen. When it comes to I and my father are one, &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; people can believe the message enough for a prophet to perform miracles. They can believe a message enough, Amen, for a prophet to discern hearts. But when it comes down to the real revelation, I and my father are one. And the bride can say today, I and the bridegroom are one. Amen. I'm not another person. I'm not under another identity. I'm not under another report. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm him. Come on. &gt;&gt; Bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh. I'm the tabernacle of his presence. I believe in a bride manifestation. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, brother Nathan, the bride, all she's supposed to do is sit around listen to tapes." Amen. Then why does the scripture say she has a ministry? &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture says the spirit and the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not just your voice, but it's the spirit joining with your voice. Amen. to say, "Oh, all you lay out of seeans. You just go on and go to hell and we'll keep listening to our tapes. Oh, you just you just we just wait for this world to burn while we sit around and have our nice church and feel better than everybody else in the world." That that that's not the spirit of Christ. Amen. But the spirit of Christ has inhabited a bride body today and has put a voice in you to cry out in a dying world and saying if there's anybody in Pawne, if there's anybody in Oklahoma, if there's anybody in Missouri, if there's anybody in Kansas or Ohio or Arkansas that's thirsty, Amen. Come to the message. Come to the altar. Come to the place where God is manifesting his reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that. I believe if the bride has a ministry, there's somebody out there's going to receive it. You know, Brother Brandham put a whole class of people, amen, into eternal life. A whole class of predestination based on their interaction with the bride of Jesus Christ. A cup of cold water in my name. How many still believe in that? &gt;&gt; How many believe your attitude towards somebody could determine their eternal destination? Well, then what kind of people ought we to be? Amen. We're not sitting on our hands waiting for a rapture. We are here to manifest the presence of God. Jesus came to your well. Now you go find a well. Amen. And say, "Look, Amen. Look, lay out of bring me a drink. And when you bring me a drink, I'll give you a drink of the river that flows from under the throne of God where the capstone bride sits. &gt;&gt; Out of your belly flows a river of living water." Brother Bram said, "Amen." Look, friends. Brother Bram said, "This world is dying for love, dying for life, dying for reality." Amen. Oh my. They're dying. And you're the one that's got it. &gt;&gt; You're the one place. &gt;&gt; You're the one place &gt;&gt; where it dwells. &gt;&gt; God don't have a prophet on the earth anymore to minister. &gt;&gt; But the son of man never departed. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that wave sheath was only testifying of somebody, a group, a people, amen, who can manifest that original life. &gt;&gt; Ah, Brother Bram said, "We're just on the border." You you you want to know what altar I really worship at. Amen. I I see the message in such a way. Brother Bram said, "We're right on the threshold of manifestation of sons where he said, "Born sons, true sons, filled sons will speak and their word will be backed." That's why the devil hates prayer lines. That's why the devil hates preachers. That's why he wants to sit them down and get the people listen to a mechanical device. Amen. Because God doesn't use mechanical devices. That's not what he speaks through. He speaks through men. He works through men. Amen. That's why friends. Amen. And he said, "And there will be such a power in sons of God." He said that somebody will say, "Oh, my crops are in drought. I need rain." Amen. And there will be a son of God there that could say, "In the name of Jesus Christ, I give you your reign." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not a charismatic, amen, to sit and make empty promises here and prophesy over you and and try to give you prosperity. Amen. But as a manifested son of God, I can preach a message and say, "Hey, it's not just my voice. You got a voice tonight." &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not on the threshold anymore. We've crossed the river. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're living in the third pole now. If you need rain, speak. &gt;&gt; If you need healing, speak. If you need deliverance, speak. Whatever you need. If your loved one straying, amen. You got a prodigal out there, speak to the situation. Speak to the mountain. Speak to the storm. The word is nye. Even in thy mouth and in thy heart. &gt;&gt; That's the That's the altar I worship at. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I need something from the Lord, Amen. And I don't I don't sit I don't sit at home and look up in the sky and wait for a blessing to fall out of heaven. I go down to a good message believing church where a Holy Ghost fililled pastor, amen, will preach the word of the hour to me. Amen. Because I believe in a bride ministry and I believe that's the altar. Amen. Where I can receive something from the Lord. But get the picture right. Cuz I don't worship that preacher. I don't worship the human being. But I worship a God that uses human beings. I worship a God that manifests himself &gt;&gt; through sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; This message doesn't need another leader. &gt;&gt; It doesn't need another prophet. &gt;&gt; Doesn't need an another messenger. &gt;&gt; Doesn't need a superhuman superhero of a preacher. &gt;&gt; What this message needs is voices. &gt;&gt; Amen. Voices. the sons and daughters of God to realize, hey, it ain't just the five-fold, but I'm part of this body, and there's something in my joint that's getting ready to supply. Hallelujah. Amen. And oh, amen. And that's what the message needs. Live voices in Jeffersonville. Live voices in Pawne. Live voices in Hardy. Amen. Live voices. Amen. Thundering out. That's the thunder that shakes the devil. That's the seventh thunder. That's the opening of the seals. That's the third poll. That's the opening of the word is when you open your mouth and give utterance to what God has planted in you. &gt;&gt; You're the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you just need to speak it. You just need to live it. Amen. Brother Brandon wasn't the voice that we heard. It's not the voice that we're feeding on. We're feeding on the body word of the son of man. Amen. And that same word wants to speak through you. Amen. Man, I think how the prophet tried to make it so clear to us. He said, "I'm not the one who spoke those things down by the river. I was only standing there when it happened. &gt;&gt; I wasn't the one who did those things. I wasn't the one who read the read the hearts. I was only a voice that he used." Friends, that's why I'm taking a stand for this message. Amen. When people are falling away left and right, Amen. When when when unbelievers are raising up, critics are raising up, I'm standing for the message. I'm resting on it. I'm standing. I'll tell you why. Amen. Because if he wants to come my way and do something supernatural in me, I just want to be standing when it happens. Amen. I want to stand for this message. Amen. Believe it with all of my heart. Become a tabernacle for it to dwell in. &gt;&gt; I want to be standing and I want to see something happen. &gt;&gt; I'm expecting it tonight. &gt;&gt; I want to take a stand. How many want to stand for the word? How many say, God, amen. or whatever happens in my life. Amen. Don't let me serve a dead idol. Amen. But let me come into the image, amen, of the son of manifestation. Let me reach my full potential. Amen. Don't let me stop with virtue. Amen. I don't want to stop at knowledge. I want to get all the way up into the capstone. I want to blend with you. I want to be welded together. Amen. Lord, if you got to hue me, Lord, if you got to chip away at me, &gt;&gt; so be it. Just let that capstone rest on me &gt;&gt; and make me an idol that speaks. &gt;&gt; I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man &gt;&gt; in human flesh &gt;&gt; in the bride's &gt;&gt; body. You want to accept his call? &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet tonight as the musicians come. images of Christ. A masterpiece, a sculpture, a kingly body, you a jewel with your own positional placing. &gt;&gt; Why would we ever take a creed? Why would we ever settle for being a member of a church, settle for a tradition when we have an opportunity to be the tabernacle of his glory? As we bow our heads tonight, I just want to bring it down to consecration. Brothers, sisters, is there anything in your life tonight that's standing between you and his glory. Standing between you and your own personal manifestation. I know we cling to little things. We carry around our old habits and our old tradition just in case. But don't you know you're a temple? Don't you know why you're here? Don't you know what it means to be the bride of Christ? It means you're his body. It means his government is trying to come down and rest upon your shoulders. [Music] God doesn't want to take away your filthy language just to make you a good church member, but he wants to use that voice. He wants to use that mouth. He doesn't want to clean your hands just to deprive you of pleasure. He's got He's got something he wants to do through those hands. There's places you can't go, not because of a law, but because he's got footsteps ordained for you to step in. You're his temple. You're his dwelling place. There's somebody in this world that needs you in your position. I say, "God, let there be nothing between nothing between my soul and my savior. I'm here, God, to break some idols tonight. I Lord, I've got things in my life I need to throw down. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I I want to raise a cloud of dust in my life, Lord. I want to I want a cleaning. I I want a con a further consecration, Lord. I I want to add to my stature, Lord. I want to be in f greater submission to the capstone of this day. Lord, I want this word to come and rest on me. Brother Bram said, if you could just prostrate yourself before this living God, he would come into you. And he begin to speak just in your own heart. As brother Kobe was saying, let's make a consecration tonight. But but make sure you're worshiping in the right house. Make sure you're crying out at the right altar. Accept his call tonight. He's looking down at you and he's saying, he's saying, "I want to live there. I want to live there in your heart. I want to speak through those lips. I want to I want there's things I want to perform through those hands. I want to lead those feet. I want to whisper my love secrets into those ears. I want I want my mind to be in that head. I want I want I want you to see through my eyes. Oh Jesus, we give you the preeminence tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, thou art the most high God. Lord, and we are your bride, Lord.

We we've had God totally We We had a a lady that had been that that had been a drug addict, a a heroin addict for years and and u uh she she was given drugs by her mama at the age of 12 for her birthday. And uh I mean this was this is the kind of stuff. And this girl had spent a month in the hospital and because her her kid or her liver was gone and uh but they wouldn't put her on a transplant list because uh she was a drug addict and uh when they came here to Pawne they were they were living on the streets and so you know they they they come from P actually they they were living in on the streets of Florida. And uh someone bought bought them a a bus ticket and and to to come to to Pawne. And so they come over here to Pawne and uh all they had, she and her husband, all they had was the clothes on their back. And uh she was an atheist and uh they were both skin and bones. They they were they were addicted to heroin. They had went through program after program. They met at a program and uh and and and went through program after program. They were heroin addicts for over 20 years. Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; She said, "Preacher, I don't believe in this kind of stuff, but yet they were needing help and and they and they were they slept. They we didn't have no extra room. They slept in the living room of our house. My house. And uh uh I said, "I tell you what, Amen. I'll put up with you if you'll put up with me, but we go to church and I want you to come with me." And uh they started coming to church. Before you know it, she she didn't even know who Moses was. She didn't know. I mean, this woman didn't truly did not know anything about the Bible. But she, as she started coming and God started dealing with her life, she smoked. Boy, did she smoke. And she was a wild cat. I'm telling you what, she was a firecracker. And uh and uh and and uh but I said, you know, go smoke. Just don't smoke here at the house. Amen. Or in the house. And so she'd be people's wondering what we was doing having a woman smoking out in our yard, man and woman smoking out in our yard. And uh you know she she she said one time she said, "Don't ever start make don't you think I'm going to wear a skirt?" I said, "Well, it's all right. You don't want to wear a skirt. That's that's between you and the Lord." And uh so I said, "But we've got some skirts if you want to." And my wife put some skirts out there for her. And she's and uh well one day she had a skirt on you know she come to church in a skirt and uh my wife she when she called me she says Wendell I said hey don't say a word don't say a thing just cuz she was bound and determined you know and u well she she started liking wearing a skirt you know and so one day she come in and she was just pacing back and forth in that living room just going back and forth back and forth. Fresca finally said, "What is wrong with you, Stephanie?" And she says, "I need to smoke." She says, "Well, go smoke." She says, "I got a skirt on." And Fresca said, "Well, well, maybe you shouldn't be smoking." Did you know the Lord came down right then, right there, delivered her of smoking, set her free, delivered her of heroin, delivered her husband of heroin. Brother Joe and Sister Stephanie, you all know them. Joe and Stephanie were heroin addicts. [Music] But she still had a liver that that wasn't working and she could only eat little just different things. She couldn't she couldn't eat like the rest of us. Praise the Lord. Now, this girl didn't know anything about anything. I mean, I just love talking to her cuz she was just she's she was just like a a little kid. I mean, she just sat there. really what happened next, you know? And I would tell her that God can heal and she'd say, "Really? You think he can do it today?" I said, "I know he does it." I told her testimonies. She said, "Well, well, then God can heal me." That was all it was. That's all it took. She just accepted it. She had went she had been going to the doctor and and the doctor was was was pretty rough on her and and uh you know uh when they would talk about the trans says listen we we record and the history and things you know we know that you're going to go back to doing the drugs we know this is just the way that's the nature of the beast and she said listen I have been delivered from heroin one, I'm saved. I'm serving the Lord." The woman said, "Well, they wanted to come back here in a in a in a few months." And and so she she came back. And when she came back that next time, doctor came back in [Music] and said, "Young lady or ma'am, there is nothing wrong &gt;&gt; with your liver. &gt;&gt; You've got a brand new liver. [Music] She said she was just so giddy and and and while while they're talking, Joe is texting me and says, "He's telling me you ain't believing this." And so they're they're going and she says, "So, so do I. I just need to keep taking my medicine, right? Just what what what just" And the doctor looked back at her and said, "You don't need medication. Your liver is working fine. That's been nine years ago and she has still got a perfect liver. Oh my. I'm talking about a living God, a reality.
