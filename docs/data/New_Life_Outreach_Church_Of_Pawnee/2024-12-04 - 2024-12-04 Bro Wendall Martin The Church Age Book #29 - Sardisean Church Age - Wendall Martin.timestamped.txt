[25:26] caroling and um
[25:29] uh so thankful uh for the the turnout
[25:31] and just the the diligence of so many to
[25:34] come and and uh Brave the weather and
[25:38] and actually it was it was a lot warmer
[25:41] last night than what it was at 11:00
[25:44] yesterday and so the Lord just gave us
[25:47] such wonderful uh uh weather and and um
[25:52] um I thought that uh the fellowship hall
[25:54] was was fixed up so nicely and and all
[25:58] of the food and hot chocolate and coffee
[26:03] uh it it was it was just
[26:05] wonderful um sister gadman and brother
[26:08] gadman was out there and even my mama
[26:11] was out there last night and uh Braven
[26:14] the cold and uh but it was it was a lot
[26:17] of fun he I enjoyed the trailers and and
[26:20] the uh the trucks um I thought it was
[26:24] nice we we went on a on a totally
[26:26] different side of town
[26:28] um another another neighborhood and so
[26:32] uh lot of
[26:33] wonderful uh
[26:35] reception among them and so I you know I
[26:39] I think um uh letting our our light
[26:42] shine is so important however we can do
[26:44] it you know man everything about us
[26:47] should be Ministry everything when you
[26:49] walk into the grocery store it should be
[26:52] Ministry um I I've I've I've often said
[26:56] I've had more success with the oneon-one
[26:58] than I than I have uh being a pastor you
[27:02] know um I've been able to win people to
[27:05] the Lord um in grocery stores in parks
[27:09] and you know just talk to people about
[27:10] the Lord Jesus and um and listen to them
[27:14] pray for them and so any opportunity
[27:17] that we have you know we can uh give
[27:21] that amen uh put get give that Gospel
[27:26] Light to the people and so I just
[27:28] believe we done that last night amen and
[27:32] um so we're going to be in um in page uh
[27:36] 243 tonight we're starting the sardian
[27:39] church
[27:40] age now you will um if you'll remember
[27:43] now this was the this was the the dark
[27:48] uh season of the church and um um so we
[27:54] if if you follow in line with the with
[27:57] the SE s now amen um it was the Black
[28:02] Horse we we had the black horse this is
[28:05] this was that Dark Age almost a full
[28:08] thousand years I think it was 915 years
[28:11] of of uh Dark Ages and um and so and
[28:17] when we say Dark Ages I think brother
[28:19] brandom it's it's just this it you
[28:21] you've had your you you you had between
[28:25] uh the thyon and the pergamus
[28:28] um you have uh the the darkness the Dark
[28:32] Ages has come through so you'll see the
[28:34] you had your you had your white horse
[28:37] the Antichrist spirit and then here
[28:41] comes the red horse coming in samna and
[28:45] pergamus and just slaughtering anything
[28:48] that doesn't agree with them and then
[28:50] here is
[28:51] thyra amen and these ages all blend in
[28:54] together but thyra was that Dark Age now
[28:59] in in each of these ages we've always
[29:01] got to remember that um if you were to
[29:04] look in in the scripture when the seals
[29:07] were being opened up amen there was a
[29:11] beast or a power that was
[29:15] introducing the horse rider so it was
[29:18] the there there was a an Beast that says
[29:22] and if you want to just read look at
[29:24] that just real quickly here here in in
[29:26] uh Revelations the um um let let's just
[29:30] look at Revelations the 4th chapter and
[29:33] the 6th
[29:36] verse and and these are the beasts that
[29:39] that stand Before the Throne of God
[29:42] anointings and it says uh Before the
[29:45] Throne there was a sea of glass like an
[29:47] a crystal in the midst of the throne
[29:49] round about The Throne were four beasts
[29:51] full of eyes before and behind the first
[29:54] Beast was like a lion the second beast
[29:57] like a calf the third Beast had a face
[30:00] as a man and the fourth Beast was like a
[30:02] flying eagle and the four Beast had each
[30:06] of them six wings about him and they
[30:08] were full of eyes within and they rest
[30:12] not day and night saying holy holy holy
[30:15] Lord God Almighty which was and is and
[30:19] is to come so now so the these
[30:24] these uh beasts these living creatures
[30:28] is what they're actually translated
[30:30] these uh living creatures represent God
[30:34] their whole desire is for the anointing
[30:38] of God to protect the anointing of God
[30:41] Amen they they they they guard that
[30:44] Living Word and so this is what they are
[30:48] doing here on Earth they are guarding uh
[30:52] the the the the Living Word here on the
[30:56] earth that's that's their purpose
[30:58] and so if you were to look when the
[31:01] seals were open and and um if if you
[31:05] would go over to the sixth chapter now
[31:08] we're finding that these beasts are
[31:12] coming and they're and they're showing
[31:14] the Church of this last day this is what
[31:17] happened in 1963 the opening of the
[31:19] seals it says I saw when the lamb opened
[31:21] one of the seals and I heard as it were
[31:25] the noise of thunder and one of the the
[31:28] four Beast saying come and see and then
[31:31] he shows the White Horse then if you go
[31:34] down to the third uh verse it says and
[31:36] when he had opened the second seal I
[31:39] heard the second beast say come and see
[31:43] so the first one was a lion the second
[31:45] one was an was an ox if you go one down
[31:49] and then it then it revealed the red
[31:50] horse and then you you go on down to the
[31:53] fifth verse and when he had opened the
[31:55] third seal I heard the third Beast uh
[32:00] say come and see what was the third
[32:02] Beast it it was the living creature with
[32:05] a man's intelligence a man's face then
[32:08] you go on down to the seventh verse and
[32:10] when he had opened the for seal I heard
[32:13] the voice of the fourth Beast say come
[32:16] and see and so it was The Pale Horse
[32:19] Rider and of course we understand what
[32:21] what is that fourth Beast it was the
[32:23] Flying Eagle it was the prophet
[32:26] messenger and so so and then then we
[32:29] understand that the fifth and The Sixth
[32:31] Seal does not pertain to the bride at
[32:33] all it it it's this is all going to take
[32:35] place after we have been caught up uh so
[32:40] that's good that's that's the Jewish
[32:41] seal and the tribulation seal so amen so
[32:45] we find that the lion introduced not the
[32:48] White Horse introducing the lion but it
[32:51] was the spirit of the Lord it was the
[32:54] the the living creatures that was
[32:57] showing the Church hey this is what took
[33:00] place in Ephesus amen then there was one
[33:03] of the beasts comes and says hey this is
[33:05] what took place in the early church and
[33:08] and we just got through with a thyra and
[33:11] and um and there was a amen we we're
[33:15] going to find now that in this Dark Age
[33:18] there is the man age or there is the
[33:20] anointing of the man that is that is
[33:23] fixing to to come and break the paple
[33:26] Rome uh the the the the paple stronghold
[33:30] on the church now this this is what
[33:32] we're fixing to get into this is where
[33:34] Martin Luther is going to come in and uh
[33:38] uh and there's going to be many great
[33:40] men intelligent men that that that take
[33:45] the the word that was written in Latin
[33:47] so that no one else could hear and no
[33:49] one else could read and and uh amen and
[33:53] and Martin Luther was was so bold and he
[33:56] stood up against the
[33:58] the pope and and and um and all of the
[34:02] the money they were charging for
[34:04] indulgences and for purgatory and and
[34:06] all of these things from the poor people
[34:09] and Martin Luther amen uh uh he he
[34:14] started uh printing the Bible portions
[34:16] of the Bible I think he started with
[34:18] Romans and he and he put it in the
[34:20] German language for the common people to
[34:22] read and as they begin to see what was
[34:27] taking place
[34:28] and reading the scripture for themselves
[34:30] that the grace of God is without was
[34:33] without money the grace of God and the
[34:36] love of God Amen you don't earn it you
[34:39] don't buy it then it started a
[34:42] Reformation around the world so you can
[34:45] see that that coming out of this age it
[34:48] was an an anointing the intellect uh
[34:52] great teachers came up that began to uh
[34:56] uh uh uh expose the church for what it
[35:00] was so and of course we understand that
[35:02] it we wouldn't understand any of this
[35:04] today if it hadn't have been for the
[35:06] eagle anointing coming down in the
[35:08] seventh angel Messenger to show us where
[35:11] we are aren't you glad that we we have
[35:13] an understanding of what has taking
[35:15] place amen that's that's the reason and
[35:18] and and you remember okay you know
[35:19] before we get to to to reading tonight
[35:22] now remember brother brandom says that
[35:24] each messenger comes at the end of the
[35:28] age so if you were to to look there at
[35:32] at the messenger
[35:34] um uh e ephes the Ephesian Church age
[35:37] started at 53 and ended in
[35:42] 170 brother uh or the Apostle Paul uh he
[35:47] his lifespan was from 58 to 64 so
[35:52] brother brother Paul he came at the end
[35:55] of Pentecost Usher in in to the Ephesian
[36:00] or the Ephesus Church age irus he was
[36:04] born in
[36:05] 120 uh around the 120 there's a little
[36:08] bit of you know they they say it's
[36:09] somewhere around the 120 and then he
[36:12] died around 200 now now here samna
[36:17] started at 170 and went to 312 so Paul
[36:21] comes at the end of Pentecost ushering
[36:24] in this one and then Here Comes irus us
[36:27] ing in samna Martin St
[36:31] Martin he was his lifespan was from 316
[36:35] to
[36:36] 397 and the church age there was and
[36:39] pergamus was 312 to 3 606 and then uh
[36:43] thara was 606 to 1520 and Columba was uh
[36:49] was he died in 597 so Columbus died
[36:54] right here but he ushered in this so I
[36:57] want you to catch this because this is
[36:59] incredible Paul comes in here ushering
[37:03] in this one comes in ushering in always
[37:06] comes at the end to usher in our uh
[37:09] Prophet came in at the end of this
[37:12] Philadelphian age in 1906 he was born in
[37:15] 1909 ushering in to this lotsy and age
[37:19] what is left for here but coming right
[37:22] on into the coming of the Lord Jesus
[37:25] Christ there is no other ages Beyond
[37:27] Beyond this and it was a prophet
[37:30] messenger that's introduced you and I to
[37:33] a living perfect
[37:36] word amen aren't you glad for that that
[37:39] living that perfect Living Word so now
[37:43] let's let's look here at
[37:45] U let's see here
[37:48] um here in the Sardis Church age and
[37:52] we're going to start there at page 143
[37:55] it says unto the angel of the Church in
[37:57] S is right these things saith he that
[38:00] hath the seven spirits of God and the
[38:02] Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou h
[38:05] a name that thou livest and art dead be
[38:09] careful or Be watchful and strengthen
[38:12] those things which remain that are ready
[38:14] to
[38:14] die for I have not found thy works
[38:17] perfect before God remember therefore
[38:20] how thou Hast received and heard and
[38:23] hold fast and repent if therefore Thou
[38:26] shalt not watch I will come on thee as a
[38:29] thief Thou shalt not know what hour I
[38:33] will come upon thee thou Hast a few
[38:35] names even in Sardis which have not
[38:38] defiled their garments and they shall
[38:40] walk with me in white for they are
[38:43] worthy he that overcometh the same shall
[38:45] be clothed in white rment and I will not
[38:48] blot out his name out of the book of
[38:51] life but I will confess his name before
[38:53] my father and before his angels he that
[38:56] hath an ear
[38:57] let him hear what the spirit says unto
[38:59] the churches Sardis Sardis was the
[39:03] capital of ancient
[39:05] Lydia it passed from the hands of lydian
[39:08] monarchs monarchs to the Persians and
[39:12] then to Alexander the Great it was
[39:14] sacked by Antiochus the great the kings
[39:17] of pergamus then succeeded to the
[39:20] Dominion
[39:22] until the Romans took over in the time
[39:25] of Tiberius it was so desolated by
[39:29] earthquakes and plagues today it is a
[39:32] heap of ruins and
[39:34] uninhabited this city was at one time
[39:38] very important commercially plenty said
[39:41] that the art of dying wool was invented
[39:45] here it was the center of wool dying and
[39:48] carpet weaving it had a goodly amount of
[39:52] silver and gold in the area and it is
[39:55] said that the gold coins were first
[39:56] meant to there it also had a slave
[39:59] market the religion of this city was the
[40:03] impure worship of the Goddess
[40:06] sabell the massive ruins of the temple
[40:09] may still be seen you will recall in the
[40:12] pergam Manan age I mention the
[40:16] babylonish concept of mother and son
[40:19] known as Seamus and
[40:21] nenus uh became Sabella and deos of Asia
[40:27] the attributes attaches attached to
[40:30] these to are most enlightening as we
[40:33] view them side by side he was the son
[40:36] God she was the moon goddess he was the
[40:40] Lord of Heaven she was she the Queen of
[40:43] Heaven he the revealer of goodness and
[40:46] Truth she of gentleness and mercy he the
[40:49] mediator she the mediatrix
[40:53] mediatrix he with the key that opens and
[40:56] shuts the gates of the invisible world
[40:59] and she with an identical key doing
[41:02] likewise he is the judge of the Dead she
[41:06] as standing at his side he being killed
[41:10] raised and ascended into heaven she
[41:13] carried there bodily by the son now in
[41:16] Rome this same God is given the title of
[41:20] our Lord he is called the Son of God
[41:24] while she is called the mother of God
[41:27] now that is what we found back there in
[41:30] the other two ages where the mother and
[41:32] son concept took on such tremendous
[41:35] proportions but now notice even as it
[41:39] was back in Babylon that the worship of
[41:42] the son began to lose out in favor of
[41:44] the worship of the mother so she
[41:47] literally began to take the place of the
[41:49] son and we see in this age that the
[41:51] Pagan worship of Sardis was the worship
[41:54] of the woman it is Sabella alone not
[41:57] Sabella
[41:58] andos the mother has literally taken the
[42:02] place of the son endowed with the merits
[42:05] of the godhead of all all one needs to
[42:08] do is go over her various titles and
[42:12] recall the lovely attributes accorded
[42:14] Mary by the Roman Church to understand
[42:16] where the religion of this age came from
[42:19] two things really struck me with Force
[42:22] as I looked into the worship of
[42:24] sabell one was the fact she wore a key
[42:29] like Janice which gave her the same
[42:32] Authority as Janice key to heaven and
[42:35] earth and the Mysteries and the fact
[42:38] that the worshippers whip themselves
[42:40] until blood spurts from their bodies
[42:43] which thing is done right today by the
[42:45] Catholics who feel they are suffering
[42:46] like our Lord the fact that this is the
[42:50] age of the first real break from the
[42:53] paple Rome that actually flourished no
[42:55] doubt calls Jezebel the The Jezebel
[42:58] prophetess to consolidate and emphasize
[43:01] her doctrine of
[43:03] marity in decided
[43:06] opposition to the uh Protestants who
[43:09] denied her any part whatsoever in the
[43:12] Plan of Salvation apart from her favor
[43:15] with God as the Virgin chosen to Bear
[43:18] the babe as Luther crystallized the
[43:22] doctrine of justification by faith they
[43:25] held to Works penance prayers and other
[43:28] unscriptural means and as the freed
[43:31] Christians glorified the Sun the Roman
[43:34] Catholics increased their deification of
[43:37] Mary until the 20th century uh Saul in
[43:41] the opposition to most high-ranking
[43:43] Roman theologians Pope Pas literally
[43:46] exalt Mary to glorification in a
[43:48] resurrected body that Doctrine is
[43:52] absolutely the babylonish one of the son
[43:54] carrying the mother bodily into heaven
[43:57] isn't that incredible how how how so
[44:01] accurate the scripture
[44:02] is no wonder this fifth age goes right
[44:06] along with the other ages and will do so
[44:10] until it ends in the Lake of Fire where
[44:12] the and her children are killed in
[44:14] the second death there it is Mary
[44:18] ol and the worship of Sabella by the way
[44:22] did you know that zabella was the aardi
[44:25] that Jezebel was pre Priestess to and
[44:28] caused Israel to stumble by the uh Lous
[44:32] rights that she conducted yes that is
[44:35] who she was in the Bible the age the
[44:38] sardian or fifth Church age lasted from
[44:41] 1520 to
[44:43] 1750 it is usually called the age of the
[44:47] Reformation the messenger the messenger
[44:51] to the age is the best known messenger
[44:53] of all the ages he was Martin Luther
[44:56] Martin Luther was a brilliant scholar of
[44:58] gentle dispens
[45:00] disposition he was studying to be a
[45:02] lawyer when the lingering illness and
[45:05] death of a near friend caused him to
[45:07] become serious concerning the spiritual
[45:09] condition of his life he entered the
[45:13] augustinian Convent in erford uh in 1
[45:18] 155 there he studied philosophy and also
[45:22] the word of God he lived the life of
[45:25] severest penance but all the outward
[45:28] acts could not vanish his sense of sin
[45:32] he said I'm tormented I've tormented
[45:34] myself to death to make peace with God
[45:36] but I was in darkness and found it
[45:38] not the viker general of his order
[45:43] stupit stopit helped him to gain the
[45:47] Insight that his salvation would have to
[45:50] be the experience of an inner work
[45:52] rather than a ritual with this
[45:55] encouragement he further sought God
[45:58] later he become a priest as of yet he
[46:01] was not saved he become an advent and
[46:05] deep student of the word and of the
[46:07] great theological Works
[46:10] extent he was sought out as a teacher
[46:13] and preacher for his depths of knowledge
[46:15] and great sincerity to fulfill a vow he
[46:19] had made to himself he went to Rome and
[46:21] there he saw the futility of the the
[46:24] church's imposed works that were or to
[46:27] bring Salvation and the word of God
[46:29] struck home to his heart the just shall
[46:32] live by faith I want is return home the
[46:35] Evangelistic truth Evangelical uh truth
[46:39] of this scripture flooded his mind and
[46:44] he set he was set free from sin and Born
[46:47] Into the kingdom of God soon after this
[46:50] he was elevated to the doctor of
[46:52] divinity and convened to devote his
[46:55] whole life to study and faith F expound
[46:57] and defend the Holy Scripture this he
[47:00] did with such effect that his heart and
[47:03] the hearts of those around him were
[47:05] deeply fixed upon the truth of the word
[47:08] the word soon came into open conflict
[47:11] with the abuses of the church Creeds and
[47:13] doctrines thus when Leo 10 became Pope
[47:19] and John tetel came to sell Indulgence
[47:21] for sin Luther had no choice but to rise
[47:25] up against this anti scriptural teaching
[47:28] first he thundered from the pulpit
[47:30] against it and then wrote his famous 95
[47:34] thesis which on October 31 1517 he
[47:38] nailed to the door of the castle of
[47:40] Castle
[47:42] Church in a short time Germany was
[47:44] Ablaze and the Reformation was
[47:48] on now let it be remembered that Martin
[47:50] Luther was not the only one who had
[47:53] protested the Roman Catholic Church he
[47:55] was but one of many others had denied
[47:58] the popee their self- granted temporal
[48:00] and spiritual power and even amongst the
[48:03] popes there were minor temporary
[48:05] reforms yes there were many others who
[48:08] raised issues but in the case of Luther
[48:11] God's time was right for a definite move
[48:14] that would be uh beginning of the
[48:17] restoration of the church to an
[48:18] outpouring of the Holy Ghost at a much
[48:21] later date now Martin Luther himself was
[48:24] a sensitive Spirit-filled Christian he
[48:26] was defin Ely a man of the word for he
[48:29] not only had a profound passion to study
[48:32] to make it available to all in order
[48:34] that they might live by it he translated
[48:37] the New Testament and gave it to the
[48:39] people this laborious work he did
[48:42] himself correcting a passage as much as
[48:45] 20 times he gathered around him a group
[48:48] of Hebrew Scholars amongst them whom
[48:51] were Jews and translated the Old
[48:55] Testament this Monument work of Luther
[48:57] is still the work upon which all
[48:59] successive works of the scripture in
[49:02] Germany have rested he was a mighty
[49:04] preacher and teacher of the word and
[49:06] insisted especially in his first years
[49:09] of public Eminence that the word was the
[49:11] so
[49:12] Criterion thus he was against works as
[49:15] means of Salvation and baptism as means
[49:18] of regeneration he taught the mediation
[49:21] of Christ apart from man as was the
[49:24] original and Pentecostal concept
[49:27] he was a man given to much prayer and
[49:29] had learned that the more work he had to
[49:32] do the more solely he was pressed for
[49:34] time the more of this time he gave to
[49:37] God In Prayer in order to ensure
[49:40] satisfactory results he knew what it was
[49:43] to battle with the devil and it said it
[49:47] is said that Satan one day visibly
[49:49] appeared to him and he flung The inkw
[49:52] Well at him bidding him go another time
[49:55] two fanatics came to him to induce him
[49:58] to join them in banishing all priests
[50:01] and bibles he discerned the spirit
[50:03] within them and sent them off it is
[50:06] recorded of Dr Martin Luther in s
[50:09] history volume 3 page
[50:11] 406 that he was a Prophet evangelist
[50:15] speaker in tongues interpreter in one
[50:18] person endowed with all nine spiritual
[50:21] gifts of the Spirit what stirred his his
[50:24] heart by the Holy Ghost which was the
[50:27] little green
[50:29] Shute that signified that truth was
[50:32] coming back to the church as it was
[50:34] known at Pentecost aren't you glad for
[50:36] that was the doctrine of
[50:39] justification salvation by grace apart
[50:42] from works now I recognize that Dr
[50:44] Martin did not believe only and preach
[50:47] only
[50:48] justification but that was his major
[50:50] theme as indeed it had to be for that is
[50:53] the basic doctrine of truth of the word
[50:56] he will be forever known as the
[50:58] instrument in the hand of God who
[51:00] revived this truth he was the fifth
[51:03] messenger and his message was the just
[51:06] shall live by faith surely we admit that
[51:10] he knew and did teach that we are to go
[51:12] from Faith to Faith His Marvelous
[51:15] understanding of the sovereignty and
[51:17] election and predestination and other
[51:19] truth show him to be a great man in the
[51:22] word yet I say again as do historians
[51:26] God used him to bring the people bring
[51:29] to the people God's standard against
[51:32] works the just shall live by faith as I
[51:35] mentioned already this age has been
[51:38] called by the historians the period of
[51:40] reformation that is exactly right that
[51:44] is what it was it had to be that for
[51:47] Martin Luther was a reformer not a
[51:49] prophet now I know the history book
[51:51] calls him a prophet but it doesn't mean
[51:54] that the history book is right for there
[51:56] is no record of Martin Luther qualifying
[51:58] as a true prophet of God in the grand
[52:01] scriptural sense of that word he was a
[52:03] fine teacher with some of the
[52:05] manifestations of the spirit in his life
[52:07] and we praise God for that so he was not
[52:10] able to lead the church back to the
[52:11] whole truth as would a man like the
[52:14] Apostle Paul who was both Apostle and
[52:18] Prophet now y'all understand that see
[52:21] you can have you can have wonderful
[52:23] theologians and an anointed Theologian
[52:26] listen listen he was raised up
[52:29] supernaturally by God uh for this
[52:32] Reformation but he was not a
[52:35] prophet and and so Amen in and in it but
[52:40] a word Prophet cannot vary from the word
[52:45] one way or the other a word Prophet will
[52:48] stay there he is he is built to stay
[52:52] with the word regardless
[52:57] that the fivefold ministry can can fail
[53:00] preachers all all Humanity can fail and
[53:04] so can a prophet Amen in his own being
[53:08] but that Prophet has been has been sent
[53:11] by God and the scripture says that God
[53:13] did not allow one word of Samuels to
[53:15] ever fall to the ground not one word he
[53:18] was there destined for a purpose and
[53:22] When God says he's going to send an
[53:23] eagle Messenger to our day it was you
[53:26] can rest assured that God Vindicated
[53:30] that Ministry and you can you can you
[53:33] can take it right back to scripture
[53:35] knowing amen that God has restored to us
[53:38] in this day do y'all believe that he's
[53:40] re he's definitely restored to us that
[53:44] that word for this Rapture now I that
[53:47] that's just wonderful that that's just
[53:50] beautiful to me we don't have to fear
[53:53] amen whether we're going to make the
[53:55] Rapture I I say Lord just let me put the
[53:58] Garment on let your word be all around
[54:01] me I'm going to listen I'm going to heed
[54:03] to your word for this day and I I and I
[54:06] want to be prepared for what uh uh for
[54:09] this Rapture this body change that is
[54:12] coming on Amen thank God for a
[54:16] prophet amen now um the the the last
[54:20] paragraph of 247 it says um now as time
[54:24] went on we find a great change in the
[54:27] way he conducted the Affairs in which he
[54:29] was
[54:30] evolved at first he had been so gentle
[54:34] so Fearless so patient in constantly
[54:38] waiting on God to work out the problems
[54:40] then vast numbers uh began to come to
[54:44] his banner and and their purpose was not
[54:47] a not a truly uh spiritual one rather
[54:52] they had political motivations they
[54:54] begin to break the Yoke of the Pope or
[54:56] they wanted to break the Yoke of the
[54:58] Pope they disliked sending money to Rome
[55:00] Fanatics rose up and soon he was dragged
[55:04] into Political Affairs and decisions
[55:07] that actually lay outside the rim of the
[55:09] church except that the church through
[55:10] prayer preaching and conduct May set up
[55:13] a standard to be Heed These problems of
[55:17] political politics mounted until he was
[55:19] forced into an untenable uh position of
[55:22] mediating between Lords and peasants his
[55:25] decisions were so wrong that an uprising
[55:27] took place and thousands were killed he
[55:30] meant well but once he had let himself
[55:33] be entangled again in the church State
[55:35] gospel he had to reap the Whirlwind but
[55:39] for all that God used Martin Luther let
[55:41] it not be said that his intentions were
[55:44] wrong let it only be said that his
[55:46] judgments failed truly if the Lutheran
[55:49] could get back to his teaching and serve
[55:52] God as this precious brother served him
[55:55] then that people would surely be a
[55:57] credit and praise to the great God and
[55:59] Savior Jesus
[56:01] Christ the
[56:03] salutation Revelations 3 And1 these
[56:07] things saith he that hath the seven
[56:09] spirits of God and the Seven Stars once
[56:13] again as in the previous four ages the
[56:16] spirit is revealing our gracious Lord To
[56:19] Us by setting forth his wonderful
[56:22] attributes this time as he is standing
[56:24] in the midst of the church we see him as
[56:27] the one with the seven spirits of God
[56:30] and the Seven Stars we know who the
[56:33] Seven Stars are but we will have to find
[56:37] what the seven spirits refer to the same
[56:40] phrase is found four times in the Book
[56:42] of Revelation Revelations 1 and 4 from
[56:46] the seven spirits which are before his
[56:49] throne Revelations 3 And1 these things
[56:53] saith he that hath the seven spirits
[56:56] Revelations
[56:58] 4:5 out of the throne precedes lightning
[57:01] and thundering and voices and there were
[57:03] seven lamps of fire burning Before the
[57:06] Throne which are the seven spirits of
[57:09] God Revelations 56 and I beheld and lo
[57:14] in the midst of the throne and of the
[57:15] four beast and in the midst of the
[57:18] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[57:21] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[57:24] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[57:27] into all the Earth to
[57:30] begin I know for a certainty that these
[57:33] scriptures are that these verses are not
[57:37] a teaching teaching a new and contrary
[57:39] Doctrine to John 4:28 or 24a God is a
[57:44] one Spirit but this is like 1
[57:47] Corinthians 12 8-1 wherein we find one
[57:52] Spirit manifesting himself in nine ways
[57:56] thus we know that the seven spirits of
[57:58] God mean it is the one and Same Spirit
[58:03] coming forth in a Sevenfold way you know
[58:07] I I was one of the things that that that
[58:10] some of these um never never branom
[58:14] folks uh you know they have the never
[58:16] trumpers and so now we've got the never
[58:18] brandom and and they they they brother
[58:22] brandom always talks about the stars and
[58:25] how the Stars reflects the sun the sun
[58:27] has to shine so well one of their big
[58:30] issues today is okay so you know William
[58:34] brandom is supposed to be this prophet
[58:36] and he's and that we have found that
[58:38] that stars um give their own light stars
[58:43] are not reflecting the sun they give
[58:46] their own light and and so um and you
[58:50] know they go through all the science of
[58:52] it and they and and and and I I I have
[58:56] to I have to chuckle because brother
[58:58] brandom is simply going to scripture
[59:02] that it is the one God reflecting in the
[59:07] seven Earthly
[59:09] Stars they have no light of their own
[59:13] the seven spirits of God are seven
[59:17] manifestations of that one God here on
[59:20] the earth see see and they and but but
[59:23] they they they they do this to try to to
[59:27] try to confuse you and try to go around
[59:29] the and that's all brother brandham was
[59:31] saying that we become stars because that
[59:35] same holy spirit is reflecting through
[59:38] us so so him using that to show that we
[59:42] are I mean I you know uh no one's ever
[59:46] claimed brother brandham to be a
[59:47] scientist he was a prophet to reveal the
[59:50] word and God used the word stars and God
[59:53] used that it was a reflection from the
[59:55] throne
[59:56] amen and so you know it just shows that
[1:00:00] they're they're just little
[1:00:01] children amen well they're
[1:00:05] reprobates children aren't reprobates so
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:09] I amen so um all right so here we
[1:00:13] go it says um
[1:00:17] uh The Same Spirit coming forth in a
[1:00:20] Sevenfold way now in Revelations 4 and
[1:00:23] 5 these same seven Spirits are called
[1:00:27] lamps of fire burning before the Lord
[1:00:30] since John always used nothing but Old
[1:00:33] Testament symbols in the revelation we
[1:00:36] go to the Old Testament and find from
[1:00:38] Proverbs
[1:00:40] 20:27 that the spirit of man is the lamp
[1:00:43] of the Lord these seven spirits are
[1:00:48] found to be associated with men now I
[1:00:50] think this is beautiful right here John
[1:00:53] the Baptist in John 535
[1:00:56] he was called a burning light which
[1:00:58] should actually be translated as burning
[1:01:01] lamp again Revelations 56 the seven
[1:01:05] spirits are identified as seven eyes in
[1:01:09] Zechariah 4:10 for who hath despised the
[1:01:13] day of small things for they shall
[1:01:16] rejoice and shall see the plummet in the
[1:01:18] hand of zerubabel with those seven they
[1:01:22] are the eyes of the Lord it is very
[1:01:26] evident that the word they refers to men
[1:01:30] thus we see the eyes of the Lord in this
[1:01:33] instances are men in this in uh in this
[1:01:37] instance is are men of course they will
[1:01:40] be anointed Men full of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:43] for God's Ministries are not in the
[1:01:46] power of men but of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:49] putting our scriptural discoveries
[1:01:51] together it is evident that the seven
[1:01:53] spirits of God refer to the Contin
[1:01:56] Ministry of the same Holy Spirit in the
[1:01:59] lives of seven men with whom God
[1:02:02] identifies himself very closely they are
[1:02:05] his eyes and they are his lamps they and
[1:02:09] these uh who these seven men are can
[1:02:13] easily be seen because the next phrase
[1:02:15] calls them the Seven Stars which are
[1:02:18] already known to us as the seven
[1:02:20] Messengers to The Seven Ages how
[1:02:23] beautiful that is see the star was man
[1:02:26] to reflect light at night for the sun
[1:02:29] has gone so just the messenger typified
[1:02:33] as a
[1:02:35] star uh uh uh just so the messenger
[1:02:38] typifies a star to each age was to
[1:02:40] reflect the light of the sun they all
[1:02:43] did this by the Holy Spirit Paul was the
[1:02:46] first messenger and he said in Galatians
[1:02:49] 1:8 that if any Angel any messenger any
[1:02:52] viker no matter who he was if he
[1:02:55] preached any other gospel than what Paul
[1:02:58] preached let him be a cursed Paul knew
[1:03:01] that after he was gone Grievious wolves
[1:03:04] would come in he knew that Satan himself
[1:03:08] could appear as an angel of Light so how
[1:03:11] much more his
[1:03:13] ministers so he warns that this gospel
[1:03:17] would always be the same now Paul had
[1:03:19] baptized in Jesus name and re-baptized
[1:03:21] where people had not been immersed he
[1:03:24] set the church in order
[1:03:26] and taught the proper use of the gifts
[1:03:28] of the Spirit and confirmed that they
[1:03:30] were to remain in the church till Jesus
[1:03:32] came thus the next Messengers all the
[1:03:35] remaining six would uh by the same Holy
[1:03:38] Ghost burn with the same fire give the
[1:03:41] same light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:03:44] and the signs would follow them did irus
[1:03:47] qualify yes did Martin yes did Columba
[1:03:52] yes did Martin Luther most assuredly
[1:03:56] did Wesley yes sir he had a great
[1:03:58] ministry and even prayed for his horse
[1:04:00] to get well and it
[1:04:02] did there you are seven Church ages and
[1:04:06] seven Messengers who were alike and PR
[1:04:09] and Paul pronounced a curse on anyone
[1:04:13] who would who who said he was a
[1:04:15] messenger but had a different gospel and
[1:04:16] lived in a different
[1:04:18] light now does does the last statement
[1:04:21] of Mine Bear up with the rest of the
[1:04:22] word yes it says in the word that if any
[1:04:25] man adds to this book or takes from it
[1:04:28] he would be plagued and judged unto the
[1:04:31] condemnation by God God said I will add
[1:04:35] the plagues written in this book and or
[1:04:39] I will take his name or his part out of
[1:04:41] The Book of Life Revelations
[1:04:43] 22:18 so we see that the seven spirits
[1:04:47] actually refer to the one spirit of God
[1:04:51] working out the will and word of God in
[1:04:54] different Generations
[1:04:56] now are you kidss understanding that one
[1:04:59] Spirit but he's coming Amen in in and
[1:05:03] he's and he's revealing himself to
[1:05:05] different Generations one God manifested
[1:05:09] through seven Church ages all the way
[1:05:12] down amen so uh because now remember
[1:05:16] remember the the whole thing is is all
[1:05:19] restoration the whole thing is
[1:05:20] restoration Satan come in to destroy and
[1:05:23] to take uh uh uh to to take take out
[1:05:26] God's Earthly body amen just like he did
[1:05:29] Jesus Christ but he
[1:05:31] raised from the dead and is seated at
[1:05:33] the right hand of God so is today he has
[1:05:37] he vowed to destroy God's bride amen and
[1:05:41] he almost took this church out but God
[1:05:43] says I'm going to raise him up he wasn't
[1:05:45] Jesus wasn't raised up the first day he
[1:05:46] wasn't raised up the second day he was
[1:05:49] raised up in the third day and here we
[1:05:51] have went down through these dark ages
[1:05:53] and God begins to raise up here the
[1:05:55] church is dead it's over it's finished
[1:05:57] but then God raises up through Sardis
[1:06:00] and Philadelphia and and Leota and here
[1:06:03] we are at the last days where the where
[1:06:05] the Bride of Jesus Christ is taking her
[1:06:07] position amen is going to rule over
[1:06:10] Satan defeat all of her enemies because
[1:06:14] God is
[1:06:15] faithful faithful to his word not that
[1:06:18] he's faithful to me not that he's
[1:06:20] faithful to you he's faithful to his
[1:06:22] word that he has over you that's the why
[1:06:26] we make our mistakes we go up we go down
[1:06:28] reason sometimes we should all be greef
[1:06:30] spots but God's got a word spoke over
[1:06:33] you and me and he's going to keep that
[1:06:35] word over you aren't you glad for that
[1:06:38] amen
[1:06:40] now he says so we um we'll read that
[1:06:44] again so we can see the seven spirits
[1:06:45] actually refer to the one spirit of God
[1:06:48] working out the will and word of God in
[1:06:50] different Generations I would like to
[1:06:53] illustrate that from the word the spirit
[1:06:55] of God was mightily upon Elijah then
[1:06:59] that same Spirit came on Elisha in a
[1:07:02] two-fold effect centuries later The Same
[1:07:04] Spirit which we call the spirit of
[1:07:06] Elijah in order to describe its Ministry
[1:07:09] came back upon John the Baptist one day
[1:07:12] that same Spirit identified by the same
[1:07:15] manner of ministry will come upon a man
[1:07:17] for the end of the Gentile Church Age
[1:07:20] Again the scripture says that God
[1:07:23] anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy
[1:07:26] Ghost and power and he went about doing
[1:07:28] good healing all that were oppressed of
[1:07:30] the devil as Jesus went away he told his
[1:07:33] disciples to T until Pentecost at which
[1:07:36] time the very same spirit that was upon
[1:07:39] him would come back and fall upon them
[1:07:42] and fill them then that called out body
[1:07:46] the church would be in his stand upon
[1:07:49] the Earth taking his place because the
[1:07:52] same spirit that was in him would be in
[1:07:55] them
[1:07:56] they would do the very same works and
[1:07:58] any people that is truly the body of
[1:08:00] Jesus Christ the true church WIll
[1:08:02] manifest the same works as did Jesus and
[1:08:05] the Pentecostal church and the
[1:08:07] Pentecostal church because the same
[1:08:09] spirit will be in them any other church
[1:08:12] that does not have the spirit and the
[1:08:15] manifestation is going to have to
[1:08:17] account to God as also It also says here
[1:08:21] that these Seven Stars are messengers to
[1:08:24] The Seven Ages are in his hand he is
[1:08:27] holding them you know right away that if
[1:08:30] they are held in his hand they are
[1:08:31] associated with his power that is what
[1:08:34] their hand signifies it signifies the
[1:08:37] power of God and authority of God not
[1:08:40] one of them come in his own power and
[1:08:43] authority that is what Paul said no man
[1:08:46] would dare to it takes the authority of
[1:08:49] God and the power of the Holy Ghost the
[1:08:52] gospel is preached by the authority of
[1:08:55] God God in the power of the spirit these
[1:08:58] men were all empowered by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:00] they all stood up to the world they
[1:09:03] could do that they were full of God they
[1:09:06] were sent or authorized by God not by
[1:09:09] self or other men now they had what the
[1:09:12] world could not have Jesus said when he
[1:09:15] went away he would send his Spirit which
[1:09:18] the world could not receive that is
[1:09:20] right the world or world's systems could
[1:09:23] not receive him that is what
[1:09:25] organization is it is World System show
[1:09:28] me a world system church that is full of
[1:09:31] the Holy Ghost I want to see it if you
[1:09:33] can show me such a church you are
[1:09:36] finding a mistake in the word no sir not
[1:09:39] one of these Messengers was organized
[1:09:42] either they were put out or got out
[1:09:45] because they were convicted of the sin
[1:09:46] of the
[1:09:47] organization how can the Holy Spirit
[1:09:50] possibly be an organization when it is
[1:09:52] organization that takes the place of the
[1:09:54] spirit
[1:09:55] and denominations take the place of the
[1:09:58] word remember organization is death it
[1:10:02] just can't be any other way if the world
[1:10:06] takes over the spirit departs yes the
[1:10:09] spirit is not seven spirits but one he
[1:10:14] will always be the same and act the same
[1:10:16] and the Seven Messengers will have the
[1:10:18] same spirit and teach the same word and
[1:10:20] have the same power if the church is the
[1:10:23] true church it will have the very same
[1:10:26] spirit and word and acts of power that
[1:10:29] they had at Pentecost by experience it
[1:10:31] will be a Pentecostal Church there will
[1:10:34] be tongues interpretation and prophecy
[1:10:37] and healings there will God will be in
[1:10:40] the midst of her God will declare
[1:10:42] himself in the midst of her as he always
[1:10:44] has Hallelujah she will be unorganized
[1:10:48] don't forget that can I hear an
[1:10:50] amen now we can see that Jesus Christ is
[1:10:53] revealing himself through the age by his
[1:10:56] Spirit In The Messengers they are as
[1:10:59] Moses was to the children of Israel he
[1:11:02] had the Revelation for his day so each
[1:11:05] messenger has God's revelation and
[1:11:07] Ministry for that day then uh thus we uh
[1:11:12] thus we see that the messengers are in
[1:11:14] his hand we see the Lord identifying
[1:11:17] himself with these men and granting them
[1:11:19] his power it is not enough that he has
[1:11:22] Associated himself with the whole church
[1:11:24] which we saw when he's seen standing
[1:11:26] amongst the good seven candlesticks nor
[1:11:29] is it enough that we see the five-fold
[1:11:31] ministry of of Ephesians four Apostles
[1:11:34] prophets teachers evangelist pastors for
[1:11:36] in each age the church goes astray and
[1:11:40] is not just the Ley but the clergy group
[1:11:43] shepherds are wrong as well as the Sheep
[1:11:46] then God brings himself on the scene as
[1:11:49] the chief Shepherd in the ministries of
[1:11:52] these seven men to lead his people back
[1:11:54] to the truth truth and abundant power of
[1:11:57] that truth God is in his people all of
[1:12:00] his people for If any man has not the
[1:12:03] spirit of Christ he is none of his and
[1:12:05] he is the word that would be the word
[1:12:08] recognized in the people but he has
[1:12:10] placed a special leadership in these men
[1:12:13] of his own choosing and through the
[1:12:16] determined counsel of his own will they
[1:12:19] appear once in an age once in each age
[1:12:22] it is the same spirit in them
[1:12:25] what a far cry is this from the heresy
[1:12:28] of Rome they have a man of their own
[1:12:30] choosing one after the other none
[1:12:33] producing the power of God none abiding
[1:12:35] in the word of God each one differing
[1:12:37] from the one before him and Abiding and
[1:12:40] adding what he desires as though he were
[1:12:42] God God is not in it but he is in his
[1:12:47] messenger and he who would have the
[1:12:49] fullness of God would follow the
[1:12:51] messenger as the messenger is follower a
[1:12:55] follower of the Lord for his uh by his
[1:12:57] word he that hath the seven spirits and
[1:13:00] the Seven Stars Revelations 3:1 now the
[1:13:03] same Lord
[1:13:05] identifies himself with man in the
[1:13:08] Incarnation he has again identifying
[1:13:11] himself with Man by his Spirit within
[1:13:13] man Hallelujah these are mine sayeth the
[1:13:16] Lord the seven Spirit-filled Messengers
[1:13:19] are the Lords they may be repudiated
[1:13:23] they may be questions in indeed to human
[1:13:26] minds they might not even seem to
[1:13:28] qualify nevertheless they are The
[1:13:30] Messengers for their age God used an
[1:13:33] Abraham he lied he used a Moses he
[1:13:37] rebelled a Jonah he disobeyed a Samson
[1:13:41] he sinned David he murdered he also used
[1:13:45] a Joshua and a Joseph and those with
[1:13:47] severe blemishes far outnumber those
[1:13:50] with histories that seem to be perfect
[1:13:52] all were and all and are his none dare
[1:13:57] deny that he used them by and through
[1:14:00] the holy spirit that he put within them
[1:14:03] to their own Master they stood or fell
[1:14:06] in them all was accomplished The
[1:14:08] Sovereign will of
[1:14:09] God let exteral history attempt to
[1:14:12] refute this it still stands the Eternal
[1:14:16] God still walks among the golden lamp
[1:14:19] stands and sends his Messengers by his
[1:14:22] spirit with the word uh to the people of
[1:14:27] of each of every age amen the
[1:14:32] denunciation Revelations 31b I Know Thy
[1:14:35] works that thou Hast a name that thou
[1:14:38] livest and art dead Revelations
[1:14:42] 32b for I have not found thy works
[1:14:46] perfect before God now here indeed is a
[1:14:49] very strange thing in every age to this
[1:14:52] point the spirit has first of all
[1:14:55] praised the True Believers and then
[1:14:57] denounced the false Vine but in this
[1:15:01] period there is evidently such wanting
[1:15:04] disregard for the Lord and his word that
[1:15:06] the entire message to the fifth age
[1:15:09] rings with
[1:15:10] condemnation I Know Thy
[1:15:13] Works what were these works that came up
[1:15:15] before the Lord and caused his
[1:15:17] displeasure well you know that each age
[1:15:20] lapped over into the next age so we have
[1:15:23] a continuation of the works of the
[1:15:25] fourth age into the fifth these works as
[1:15:27] you are well aware of were the the
[1:15:31] leadership of the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit
[1:15:33] were superseded by human hierarchy the
[1:15:37] pure word of God and its free benefit to
[1:15:39] all men was disposed for Creeds dogmas
[1:15:42] Church orders
[1:15:43] Etc the worship in the spirit and gifts
[1:15:46] of the Spirit and all which pertains to
[1:15:48] the true Community Fellowship of the
[1:15:49] Saints was cast aside for Liturgy and
[1:15:53] literal idol worship Feast Etc Mary olry
[1:15:58] was assuming a greater place in the
[1:16:00] Christian worship until she had actually
[1:16:03] assumed a place of godhead and the son
[1:16:06] was brought uh from his lofty position
[1:16:09] over all to be subservient to a man
[1:16:12] called the pope who termed himself the
[1:16:14] viker of Christ those who fought this
[1:16:17] terrible Antichrist Church were
[1:16:19] destroyed those who stayed with it found
[1:16:22] themselves the pawn of the church
[1:16:24] whether they were peasant or Kings their
[1:16:28] lives were not their own neither were
[1:16:30] their lives Christ they belonged Body
[1:16:32] Soul and Spirit to the Church of Rome
[1:16:35] they talked about the blood of Christ
[1:16:37] yet they purchased their salvation with
[1:16:38] money and bought forgiveness of sins
[1:16:41] either by gold or Penance the wealthier
[1:16:44] of them found it a happy situation when
[1:16:47] Pope Leo 10 allowed them to buy
[1:16:50] Indulgence for Sins Not Yet committed so
[1:16:52] that they with ease of conscience could
[1:16:55] plan their own their awful crimes and
[1:16:58] then proceed to carry them out knowing
[1:17:00] that the pope had already remitted their
[1:17:02] sins the word of God was kept from them
[1:17:05] so who was to know the truth since the
[1:17:09] truth comes only from the word and the
[1:17:11] people were shut up in a dungeon of the
[1:17:13] Roman Church awaiting death and after
[1:17:16] death the Judgment but the great horde
[1:17:18] drunk with the blood of Martyrs with no
[1:17:21] thought of the Judgment reeled savagely
[1:17:24] or to kill men with both spiritual and
[1:17:27] physical death now toward the end of the
[1:17:30] fourth age which would be the beginning
[1:17:32] of the 5th also the invasion of
[1:17:35] Constantine and the Turks sent learned
[1:17:38] Scholars of the East with their Greek
[1:17:41] manuscripts to the West the purity of
[1:17:44] the word and the teachings of the True
[1:17:47] Believers were were thus
[1:17:50] disseminated and and not only were these
[1:17:52] fine teachers of great importance but
[1:17:55] also the invention of of what become the
[1:17:58] bases of our modern print and presses
[1:18:00] were discovered facilitating the
[1:18:02] production of books thus we find the
[1:18:05] great hunger and the demand for the
[1:18:07] Bible could be answered God raised up
[1:18:10] mighty many Mighty Men of which Luther
[1:18:13] was but one Calvin and swingley were
[1:18:16] were two other
[1:18:18] illuminaries and besides these were many
[1:18:20] many more who are not so well known
[1:18:24] however ever though all this was not in
[1:18:27] vain the mighty works of God was
[1:18:29] actually hindered by these very men for
[1:18:32] one thing they did not oppose the church
[1:18:35] State marriage of the nin Council but
[1:18:37] actually fostered that Union the defense
[1:18:40] of the Gospel by the state was welcomed
[1:18:43] though there was no word for it and
[1:18:46] though we see the wrath of man pleasing
[1:18:49] God in such events as Henry VII taking
[1:18:52] up for the reformation and the rejection
[1:18:55] of pample authority it was a far cry
[1:18:57] from the truth of Pentecost and
[1:18:59] protection of an omnipotent God In Spite
[1:19:03] Luther's constant teachings against the
[1:19:05] outside interference in the local church
[1:19:08] matters he was not able to clear the
[1:19:10] men's minds of the bishop and Archbishop
[1:19:12] concept of church government thus the
[1:19:15] church took one step in the right
[1:19:17] direction but still remained Shackled so
[1:19:19] in short order she was again in prison
[1:19:22] in the same dungeon when she had had
[1:19:25] attempted to
[1:19:27] escape amen so we're going to stop
[1:19:30] reading right there
[1:19:32] um so we can see how
[1:19:36] that uh as as um as as we have
[1:19:43] read Martin Luther came came right there
[1:19:46] at the end of that
[1:19:48] fourth and and was and and and was uh
[1:19:53] proclaiming and now watch it's such an
[1:19:56] amazing thing brother Brandon brought
[1:19:57] out how that there were many many Who
[1:19:59] had who had withstood the pope um but
[1:20:03] but never could gain traction they could
[1:20:06] see that that he was wrong they could
[1:20:08] see that it was all but they never but
[1:20:10] they never could get
[1:20:12] traction and and and yet it was not the
[1:20:17] age it was not the time they they were
[1:20:20] still under that that basically under
[1:20:22] that that that Ox anointing
[1:20:25] but when God came down and anointed
[1:20:28] Martin Luther he was the messenger he
[1:20:31] didn't he didn't promote
[1:20:32] himself he simply had a burden and the
[1:20:36] Lord and the and the influence of the
[1:20:39] Holy Spirit was on him until that one
[1:20:41] man brought about a Reformation to the
[1:20:44] entire
[1:20:46] world I I I think about that and
[1:20:49] sometimes and it wasn't just him but but
[1:20:52] the anointing was upon the Earth and it
[1:20:54] was brother brandom talked about Calvin
[1:20:57] and he talked about swingley and he
[1:20:58] talked about all of these others and the
[1:21:00] people were anointed for this what about
[1:21:04] in our day when when the seals have been
[1:21:07] opened the spirit of the Lord because
[1:21:09] remember what God does through the
[1:21:11] messenger what he speaks through the
[1:21:13] messenger he's doing it for the people
[1:21:15] of that age and so when God spoke
[1:21:19] through our our our generation in our
[1:21:22] generation opening the seals and
[1:21:24] revealing the mystery behind the church
[1:21:26] ages opening these things up to us there
[1:21:30] is an anointing upon me and you and we
[1:21:33] shall Prevail against any power that
[1:21:38] would ever try to to to uh uh keep you
[1:21:41] out of that Rapture you're anointed for
[1:21:44] that now as as each one of those men
[1:21:47] each one of those people who who
[1:21:48] followed in those ages they had to
[1:21:52] Humble themselves before God because
[1:21:54] listen
[1:21:56] you there were many that were put to
[1:21:57] death even in it was it was a it was a
[1:22:01] rough time even in the days of of Luther
[1:22:03] he was running for his life but you see
[1:22:06] they couldn't kill him they couldn't
[1:22:08] destroy him and and and it was a people
[1:22:11] that was that were dedicated to God
[1:22:13] knowing that the truth was more
[1:22:16] important to them than anything else in
[1:22:18] the world and today here we stand in the
[1:22:21] in the most deceitful age of them all
[1:22:24] but we stand under a covenant we stand
[1:22:28] under the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:22:30] that same holy spirit that was that was
[1:22:33] with our messenger amen that brought
[1:22:36] that message that same angel of God is
[1:22:39] right here with you today to hear your
[1:22:41] prayers understands where you're at
[1:22:44] knows your heartaches knows your
[1:22:46] failures and he's there Amen to anoint
[1:22:49] you for this
[1:22:51] Rapture amen oh I I love him for it I I
[1:22:56] thank him for it and so um as we as we
[1:23:00] get in we this this church age here is
[1:23:02] going to be a wonderful a wonderful time
[1:23:04] and and I think we might get into it
[1:23:06] this next Wednesday night um but brother
[1:23:09] brandom is going to really um uh uh go
[1:23:12] into the uh the names that that are that
[1:23:16] are uh put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:23:20] that cannot be taken off but then
[1:23:21] there's names that have been put on the
[1:23:23] book of life that will be taken off um
[1:23:26] there and and he's and he's going to
[1:23:27] deal with it and to me it's just it's
[1:23:30] it's just really beautiful uh the way he
[1:23:33] goes through this so I'm I'm thinking
[1:23:36] I'm uh I and that's I I was was the
[1:23:39] reading uh getting you too sleepy
[1:23:43] tonight I didn't want to get you too
[1:23:45] sleepy but I wanted to get to a point to
[1:23:46] where hopefully um we can we can start
[1:23:50] getting into that on this next um in
[1:23:54] this next if not this next Wednesday
[1:23:56] night it'll be the Wednesday night after
[1:23:58] that so we'll see how it goes uh any
[1:24:00] questions here tonight before we uh
[1:24:03] dismiss
[1:24:06] amen praise the
[1:24:12] Lord
[1:24:15] amen um wasn't that a it was a good
[1:24:18] reading tonight amen I it it was it was
[1:24:21] a very very good reading
[1:24:25] I love the church age book I just you
[1:24:28] know there's there's there's there's
[1:24:30] just so many irrefutable things that are
[1:24:31] in there and you can't you just you just
[1:24:33] really can't um you can't get away from
[1:24:36] it anybody that that has any eyes at all
[1:24:38] can see that uh that it's that it's
[1:24:41] right on the money amen so politics
[1:24:45] don't belong in the church and uh and
[1:24:48] and here we stand today now we've we've
[1:24:50] got this great thing that's going on
[1:24:52] today in the charismatic move they're
[1:24:54] non- denomination but it's still very
[1:24:57] political and it's a money game it's
[1:25:00] it's something that that it's there is
[1:25:02] it's it's a it it has become a
[1:25:04] well-oiled machine at making money and
[1:25:08] that is not the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:25:12] and so uh you think you think any of
[1:25:15] those guys are going to be able to come
[1:25:16] and open up the word and preach the
[1:25:18] word you think any of them's going to do
[1:25:20] that of course they're not man because
[1:25:23] they've got a cash C coming in they they
[1:25:25] want they they're you know uh uh they're
[1:25:28] living in luxury and and and high
[1:25:30] rollers and and and and and and the and
[1:25:34] the the people are just uh uhh flocking
[1:25:38] and making these men rich and their
[1:25:41] organization's rich and and and and the
[1:25:44] word of God is not even found in any of
[1:25:46] them not not found in one of them so I I
[1:25:50] I say Let It Be the words of life that
[1:25:55] mean more to us than anything else in
[1:25:57] the
[1:25:59] world amen amen more than than than
[1:26:03] anything else in the world the very
[1:26:06] words of life is what is preg nating
[1:26:10] your heart here tonight and I'm glad
[1:26:13] that God brought it straight from the
[1:26:15] voice of a prophet Messenger to you and
[1:26:18] to me to believe that amen I hope we
[1:26:21] believe that I mean I I I I think that
[1:26:25] the basic Words of Life are true and if
[1:26:29] we put those basic principles in our
[1:26:33] lives amen listen here here it is if if
[1:26:36] if the Rapture is coming and the word of
[1:26:39] life amen is is to impregnate the right
[1:26:42] the Rapture is not going to come by
[1:26:46] Chance the Rapture is something that is
[1:26:49] taking the body change is what you are
[1:26:52] receiving in here
[1:26:54] and it's got to be undefiled not in your
[1:26:57] gut but in your heart it's got to be
[1:27:00] undefiled before God without any kind of
[1:27:04] man's interpretation it's got we got to
[1:27:07] believe it the way God wrote it and see
[1:27:10] the spirits that are out there that
[1:27:13] would try to defile that seed within me
[1:27:16] and you because that and that alone will
[1:27:19] produce and bring about the Rapture can
[1:27:22] you say amen amen so we we we look to
[1:27:26] that we believe that amen we amen that
[1:27:31] but oh God as we as we sing that song
[1:27:35] let your word be born in the manger of
[1:27:38] my heart this the Christmas season is
[1:27:40] coming and uh um we're we're you
[1:27:45] know it just seems like we go from
[1:27:47] season to season but let this season be
[1:27:49] more to us than just amen uh uh you know
[1:27:54] uh holiday shopping but oh God let your
[1:27:57] word be born right here in the manger of
[1:28:01] my heart let me Foster that word amen
[1:28:05] let me let me look to that word and
[1:28:07] believe that word because that word has
[1:28:11] eternal life for me amen if the
[1:28:13] musicians would
[1:28:15] come praise the name of the
[1:28:21] Lord yeah
[1:28:24] talk about the stars of God yeah you
[1:28:29] know
[1:28:31] the naysayers are trying to you know
[1:28:34] make fun of that yeah and what come to
[1:28:36] my heart
[1:28:37] was yeah they they weren't giving out
[1:28:40] their own life yeah that you know John
[1:28:44] one says the the about the word in the
[1:28:46] beginning the word in him was life and
[1:28:50] the life was the light of men that's
[1:28:54] good it was that one you talked about
[1:28:57] one Spirit yeah God's one spirit that
[1:28:59] one Spirit which was the the the life
[1:29:04] yeah that one life that one genuine Holy
[1:29:08] Ghost life was in these sever different
[1:29:11] men yeah and it's also of course in Us
[1:29:14] in him was life and the light was and
[1:29:16] the life was the light of men and the
[1:29:18] light shined in darkness you know I
[1:29:21] thought that was so striking talked
[1:29:23] about the Stars
[1:29:24] yeah that it it's the life of God the
[1:29:28] holy ghost that is that produces the
[1:29:31] light and it's shown through seven
[1:29:34] chosen vessels for every age and we as
[1:29:38] the children of God recognize that that
[1:29:41] light in our day like they did in that
[1:29:44] day in the sard day day so I don't know
[1:29:47] if anybody if I said that just right but
[1:29:50] I I see I just saw that so plainly yeah
[1:29:53] as you were that the Stars they were the
[1:29:57] stars of God Amen you know yeah they
[1:30:00] were just they weren't giving out their
[1:30:01] own life no no and that and that would
[1:30:05] that would defeat that that would defeat
[1:30:06] the purpose and that's you know and and
[1:30:08] you listen to
[1:30:11] that the light had to shine on that
[1:30:14] certain portion of the word for each age
[1:30:17] and God would raise that man not with
[1:30:19] his own intellect but God would raise
[1:30:21] that man up and shine his light and why
[1:30:24] do why do these
[1:30:27] guys
[1:30:28] um try to make make brother brandom look
[1:30:32] like a fool because it's clearly in the
[1:30:35] scripture and he's just expounding just
[1:30:37] like he talked about the you know the
[1:30:39] spirit of man is is is is a candle you
[1:30:42] know going through those things or how
[1:30:43] that God would raise up men but you know
[1:30:46] what the hardest part
[1:30:49] for man is to follow another man
[1:30:55] and and and God they they didn't want to
[1:30:57] follow Jesus Christ they didn't want to
[1:31:00] they didn't want to follow any of the
[1:31:02] prophets and when God would raise up he
[1:31:04] would raise up a man anoint that man for
[1:31:08] that
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:14] age that man would simply be a
[1:31:17] reflection of of of God's Eternal
[1:31:20] purpose it would be such a reflection
[1:31:24] and the people would see the anointing
[1:31:27] upon that man because it was not that
[1:31:29] man and I I I and on Martin Luther how
[1:31:32] could any man even though he was a smart
[1:31:34] man but how could Any Man start
[1:31:37] a start a a great Revolution like like
[1:31:42] that you you can't it was God that was
[1:31:45] with him I say today in our day we've
[1:31:48] had a greater Vindication than any of
[1:31:52] the other days
[1:31:54] because the and and and and we've seen
[1:31:56] it time and time and time again through
[1:32:00] the through the prophet Ministry and the
[1:32:02] reason why we can say that even even
[1:32:04] more than that's recorded in the days of
[1:32:05] Jesus or more those recorded in the days
[1:32:07] of Paul is just we got
[1:32:09] tapes we I mean this went around this
[1:32:12] went around the world and and it was so
[1:32:15] Vindicated before the whole world that
[1:32:17] it was God I don't know I think I I I
[1:32:21] think that um
[1:32:25] I I I think that we're pretty
[1:32:28] blessed I think I think it's wonderful
[1:32:31] if God has ever Vindicated a
[1:32:35] message if God has ever been good to a
[1:32:37] people he's been good to
[1:32:40] us
[1:32:42] amen
[1:32:44] because there was still a lot of lot of
[1:32:46] nonsense we know that the Catholic or
[1:32:49] the lutherans went right back to Mama
[1:32:51] and all these others went right back to
[1:32:52] Mama there was just all all of that
[1:32:54] Revival and death Revival and death
[1:32:56] Revival and death but guys we can say
[1:32:59] beyond a shadow of a doubt I don't know
[1:33:01] about you know they're people's always
[1:33:03] sending me stuff about the about these
[1:33:05] guys they're they've got a cohered um
[1:33:09] effort right now they're sending stuff
[1:33:11] you know to these television stations
[1:33:13] and also putting stuff in
[1:33:15] newspapers uh calling the message of
[1:33:18] cult I don't I don't care what anyone
[1:33:21] else has done with that message
[1:33:25] the message is right from start to to
[1:33:27] the
[1:33:28] end and you can put your you can put
[1:33:30] your confidence in that and and since I
[1:33:34] have studied the message as I have I can
[1:33:36] I can go back you know it was like when
[1:33:39] the brother was trying to tell me about
[1:33:41] um you know he brought he brought
[1:33:43] something to me about brother brandom
[1:33:45] being a racist and so he took he
[1:33:49] took all of these articles from the
[1:33:51] internet brought it over to me and I I
[1:33:54] said but but that's not that's not all
[1:33:56] of it they're taking the quotes all of
[1:33:58] these quotes and I said I know every one
[1:34:00] of these quotes and I said here let me
[1:34:03] show you so I was able to go on my
[1:34:06] computer pushed in let him read the
[1:34:08] whole thing there that God was a
[1:34:11] segregationist well he was talking about
[1:34:13] segregating the the church the the
[1:34:16] church from the bride segregating the us
[1:34:18] from the world separate I said so I took
[1:34:21] I took all of these quotes brought it
[1:34:23] out that then I looked over at the man
[1:34:24] and I said now who's
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:29] lying he said
[1:34:32] well that's not the way they put it I
[1:34:35] said they're
[1:34:37] lying I just showed you black white I
[1:34:40] took the quotes that they put in here
[1:34:42] and they're splicing I said here it is
