a feeling I'm going to be doing that night thing all morning amen but um I want to minister here this morning on the Glorious expectations that come from above and um amen as as we look at at desires uh uh desires are common uh within every and any a a a living creature um desire comes with life and and when you Amen in every living thing that's the scripture the reason the scripture says that he feels the desire of every living thing because living things have desire amen desire is a is a strong feeling or a wanting of something it's um an aspiration or an e eagerness to attain it is an enthusiasm uh of something amen it is it it can come in the form of a dream amen uh a daydreaming or longing uh to to possess something or to to have something amen and and so every one of us every everyone that is sitting here whether uh you are a boy girl man woman we all are creatures with dreams expectations amen whether you want a car or a little toy or or or uh he want to get married or or or whatever you you may be with here there you have expectations now I believe that God had dreams God's got desire God's got amen uh uh uh you know Ambitions and um you know it was asked one time does a child had asked if does god dream does God have things that he Longs for and I and and my my uh answer was absolutely yes amen God's got great ambition God's got great desire amen and and of course amen I I I want to say all of God's desires comes true amen God's God's desires amen he's a living being just as you are and I I I go a step further and say that God is the author of all dreams amen what what you you there's things in your heart that maybe you dream that you desire that you are longing for I believe that God doesn't just give give you the ability to dream but I believe that God also gives you the desires of your heart the scripture says he gives the desires of your heart can you amen you see you are amen uh you were eternally in the mind of God Amen you he he's J dreamed about you for all eternity he he's looked for you to come amen knew that he needed someone in this season of time for Rapture and you were the one that was in his mind you were part of that dream you are part of that drama that he had can you say amen amen and I say he's he's Daydream because there is no night amen so so he has he has dreamed for all eternity that you were coming amen and and I I I want to say this morning that every one of you amen you you girls sitting here on the on the front Pew you are his dream come true amen you are you see God has Ambitions he has hopes he has dreams he has goals and God is I I I believe that we are coming to a finality of one of God's greatest dreams and that's the finality of redemption amen the whole reason he made the Earth if you ever really thought about it amen the whole reason he made the Earth like it was is because he knew you would like it and he wanted to make it just for you amen it was for you so I I don't know I you know you know sometimes we we we get this feeling that uh this thinking that maybe you know we have dreams but uh uh uh uh God is not interested in those things in our lives I I want to say that God is very much interested in the things that you're interested in amen that's right you you you you are you he he loves uh amen making dreams come true amen if you've ever thought about it amen somebody had to had to dream this Earth up somebody had to create it somebody has got to keep things to go we there is a higher power amen than than than just the Big Bang Theory amen he dreamt of sons and daughters he dreamt of a uh of a of a kingdom he dreamt of you and me ruling and reigning on the earth I say God's a big dreamer God does not dream small God dreams big and if he dreams dreams If he if he dreams big amen then he's interested in your dreams as well amen that that's why that's why the prophet of God Amen would say amen he says don't ever think you could ever ask too much of God I believe the scripture said amen you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our Joys would be full he wants you to ask abundantly ask for big things in other words God wants you to dream big amen he says and he says don't limit your faith to some little Mustard Seed get on out here to some other kind of faith move on out Amen in the big things ask big things is just as easy to to receive as the little things you just have to believe that's all you've got faith now no just know exactly how to use it and it'll be all right you can put it to work and it'll be just fine can somebody say amen amen so God has dreams amen and God does not just have dreams but his sons have dreams amen and those dreams are called Faith amen Faith sees things Faith desires things Faith sees things that are not amen those of you that are wanting healing and faith is reaching out and saying I desire that I want that amen I long for that God gave you that faith that desire so that you can possess amen whatever your desire is well that that should make you want to shout amen so I so someone say God is interested in my dreams amen you boys that are seeking amen the will of the Lord for H H uh you know for for wives and maybe you're dreaming of houses and children and maybe you've got these God has created you to dream and we seek him we ask him amen for things in our life there's those of you that are that have been crying out asking for amen asking for a a healing in your bodies God has given you that desire and God will fulfill the desire of all living things amen if you're wanting your healing then you've got to set your faith what is your faith it's your dream amen it's the that thing that goes beyond where you are and it takes its its Mighty Wings and it goes up and sets on that great Rock of Ages and it begins to look out and see things that no one else can see amen and that faith says amen I see healing for me I see my children safe I see Deliverance amen and it stake it Stakes its claim upon the Rock of Ages brother renon would put it this way he says now he says faith take its position on the rock of God's word and all the waves of Hell beating against its foundation it'll take its Eagle Eye and soar Beyond them clouds and it'll see the god of resurrection and of Promise oh how many wants to dream here this morning amen that's exactly right you see God in his dreaming of you he says I I don't believe when we get to heaven that we will uh uh be just everybody look look just exactly alike I don't believe that all will be blondes or brunets or little or big or Giants I I believe that God is a god of variety and the world proves that he's got the big mountains and the little mountains he's got Plains he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it he made the season summer spring uh uh uh Autumn he winter he made the seasons he he chose it it shows he is a god of variety he made you in a variety so that means not everyone has the same dream not everyone has got to we're not made out of the same mode someone say thank God Amen your desires might be different than your desires but God is big enough to take care of all your desires hallelujah amen can you say amen he says he made you a variety some are real blastous some are real dogmatic others are fine others are kind amen you just find all kinds of uh different kinds of people in his kingdom amen like many kinds of hills and like uh uh many kinds of rivers and springs and lakes they they were here when you when you come here first because the kindness of your heavenly father place them here amen because some men like the mountain some people likes Waters some likes deserts so you see you're coming he knew your nature and what you would be and he made it just the way that you would enjoy it you mean God is interested in my joy God is interested Amen in the way I think God is interested in me being happy I say 100% And when full Redemption comes amen you will be 100% happy amen there will be no sickness there will be no sorrow there will be no well glory to God I say it's God's desire to take you back to where it was happiness with zero devil zero heartache amen and while you're living in this body of Decay amen and this in this body of humiliation amen God still makes dreams come true well praise the Lord I I just want to say this morning I I I want everybody to start dreaming and when you dream dream big amen you don't have to accept just settle for anything little a in God's kingdom amen you don't have to settle for something that you know maybe well I I I just I just don't know if I can have it if your faith can see it God is here to give it well praise the Lord amen amen now he says now father knew that you would be here and prepared everything for you before you got here amen well I I I just want to I I I I just think that's just wonderful Amen brother bradam says now he says now when we think of God when we when we begin to dream dreams of being well when we dream dreams of being saved when we get to thinking about our sins and how cruel it is before God that's when he draws near you want God to come in your place he says it's when you start dreaming you start dreaming dreams of being healed you start dreaming dreams of being saved you start dreaming well praise the name of the Lord why because you are the son of your father and he is a dreamer can you say amen amen he says now he says that's when he draws nigh near that's when these disciples brokenhearted going on to Aus that Jesus stepped out of the Bush and began to walk with him while they were thinking of him amen you know the scripture says there in in in Ephesians 3 and 20 now un him that is able to do exceeding somebody say exceeding somebody say abundantly well I've got half of you helping me exceeding abundant ly above that we ask or even think according to the power or the expectation that worketh in US amen so he is able to do exceedingly abundantly above anything you would ask or anything that you're afraid to ask for he is able to do that but it is limited according to the power of expectation well I wish someone would help me preach this morning there's where we li is the expectation that God has placed in your heart to see those things believe those things and ask for those things amen hallelujah I I like the I I like the Amplified version of that he says now to him who is able to carry out his purpose and do super abundantly more than we are that that more than all that we uh dare ask or think infinitely beyond our greatest prayers hopes or dreams according to the power that is at work within us can you say amen amen so when you're born again remember the genetics of God are there the genetics are the ones that have called you the genetics of God Amen is the life of God and the same life it it produces the same expectation of Faith because you came out of God Amen now I I want to say this here this morning God is a god of promises and his promises are yes and amen they're not yes and no if God says yes he means yes if God gives a promise he's not going to turn around and say no amen so don't limit your faith to all of your Nays limit your faith to all of his y amen there is no changing there is no variableness there is no turning there is no changing Minds he is not a man that he should lie nor the son of man that he should repent amen if God has spoken it it shall come to pass God's The Giver of Hallelujah can you say amen amen oh yes I pray here here this morning that you get out of this old flesh amen that you get out of this old stinking amen thinking of Amen I can't and I want and it's time for us to get to Soaring in the heavens amen and seeing God for who he is he is not a man he is not a he's not limited like you he is the great Eternal Creator and he happens to be your father amen James 1:17 says every good gift every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning and of his own will beget he us with the word of truth hallelujah can you say amen amen Isaiah 55 and8 my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth and and but and and that it may give seed to the sow and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goes out of my mouth it will not return unto me void but it will accomplish that which I please and I shall prosper in the thing wherein i s it that you shall go out with joy someone shout hallelujah and be led forth with peace and the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and the Trees of the field shall clap their hands you should be somebody with some joy in the building there should be joy in the camp because God never fails Hallelujah my word is coming to you and I don't want it to be coming to your Void my promise let me put it this way without a promise there is no expectation and without expectation there is no preparation Hallelujah now now here here's here's the deal God gives the promise because he is his whole goal the whole design is to create an expectation man was man was diseased and sick and God says I am the god that'll heal you the sick man had no expectation before but now the sick man can say God said that I can be healed before the word came there was no expect ation well praise the Lord amen but now you can have an expectation listen amen when you're you know some there's been there there's been broken marriages that uh uh we and we got some of you children here that are that that are the products of of of broken marriages amen and and maybe Mom and them didn't mom and dad might not have had that expectation maybe their walk with God wasn't wasn't exactly where it needed to be at the time but you are here you are in the right now and God says that he will keep you God's not going to give you a spouse amen just for you to uh turn around 10 years down the road and get divorced but what you do he gives the promise of a a relationship he gives a promise amen well praise the Lord and that promise creates expectation and that expectation causes preparation in your life Hallelujah well glory to God Amen if I'm expecting amen if I'm expecting to receive something the Lord then I'm going to start preparing for it amen I'm going to start preparing I am no longer seeking the will of God I am no longer asking God if it's okay to be healed I've already went past it I've seen it in the scripture I am now expecting it and I am now prepar preparing for it amen the other no no no more of those kind of prayers anymore amen I'm healed amen now I'm preparing for the healing to get here well praise the Lord Abraham didn't have to ask God anymore are you sure I'm going to get the son am I going to have a son am I going to have a son when the Revelation struck that heart amen he begin to create the booties and begin to create a little room and he begin to prepare why because the promise created expectation and expectation brings about preparation and it's the preparation that brings the promise to pass you see the channel now there's there's there's too many amen that that that amen they're still messing around with a word they have never found it's a legalistic word to them everything is legalism amen so they don't know how to step out in faith and they'll always revert back to legalism it's got to they've got to have a set rule they've got to have a certain something and they can never step out in faith amen they it's got to be something concrete tangible amen that they can control that they can keep in their grasp faith is a faith is is God's dream that is way out in the Yonder Come On Hallelujah well praise the Lord amen and so to those individuals they read the promise but they're not sure of the promise and they're always looking for the tangible but you see that's not the way God works he doesn't work with a tangible mind he doesn't work with a tangible body he works with your faith well praise the Lord amen therefore with the promise creates an expectation amen now I've already seen the rain well glory to God look at Elijah that they Elijah was amen by his word he shut up the Heavens went for three and a half years God comes to him amen and tells him all right I want you to go to Ahab and I want you to tell him amen that that that that rain is fixing to come and amen and so he goes he goes to the out there to the to the seashore and amen or or somewhere out there on on the mountain and and and he's praying and and and and he sends the servant amen takes him sends him out to the seashore says what do you see amen he comes back says I don't see anything he says go back again amen he's right now he had already heard the promise of God he had already heard all right amen you are going to bring rain but he had to trust he had to trust in that word and because he trusted that that word expectation kept sending that that servant out there what do you see coming back I don't see anything sends it back down the third time comes back I don't see anything he just kept on ascending him and finally on that seventh time he comes back and he says man I see a cloud but that cloud is only the size of a man's hand amen that's all he needed to know he says I want you to get up and run down there and tell oh King Ahab that I hear the abundance of the sound of rain can you amen all he saw was the cloud the size of a man's hand but it was enough to create Thunder and clouds and he did not see the cloud he did not hear the thunder but his faith was able to reach out into that real ah praise the name of the Lord can you say Amen in other words the word becomes vision for you God says is yours can you say amen amen so that word becomes your vision it becomes your absolute amen now amen then you can only walk by that sight you're no longer walking by this sight it's no longer ah and and and amen now you're walking by faith sight you're just as blind as a bat you don't see the healing you don't feel the healing you don't know the healing amen it's all but there's one thing about you you're not going to accept what the devil is putting on you anymore amen your faith is greater than what you're feeling your eyes side has already possessed can you say amen amen well if then you can't claim both you can't believe that you're healed and still claiming you're sick you got to you got to get up start walking the land I know I'm an old man I know I'm Barren but God says every place that I put the souls of my feet my children are going to walk on oh can you say Amen I'm feeling old I'm feeling weary I'm feeling tired and I ain't got no children but I'm going to get up and I'm going to walk I'm going to walk because I'm preparing a place amen not just two acres but I'm going to possess the whole land I'm going to give the Oh Land of my children God gave me that promise hallu well can you say Amen well glory to God Amen praise the Lord when brother brandham would see a vision that was an absolute Assurance to him he talks about the he talks about the man there in in India when when he had all of those other guys and and all those other religions those 17 different religions and they

come up here and heal this man amen he says if I did not see it by Vision he had already seen the vision he knew who Billy was going to pick he knew he was going to be a blind man and he already knew that he was healed brother brandom says I could stand up there with the absolute Assurance cuz I already seen it brother I want to say faith is the same way if we could get that if we could climb up in fath get to dreaming big well praise the Lord amen now and and uh I I I've got that somewhere hallelujah praise the Lord amen you love him Hallelujah and uh uh I can't I can't find it praise the Lord where brother brandom he he he goes back he's using that vision and then he but then he turns right around and talks about that Faith he says that's what the faith does to the believer when you see it when you get to when you get to dream in the way God wants you to dream see in the way God wants you to see then there is nothing that is going to hold you back from that promise amen it's no longer a preacher's word a doct word or amen a good report bad report it is God's word to you and that becomes your final absolute well can you say amen amen oh I want to say Amen here today when you

impossibility in order for me to rise there's got to be discouragement in order for me to shine amen I will stand upon the Vindicated word of God can you say am man when you see that you are God's Invincible bride it does something to you can you say amen amen the same Prophet that seen it the same Prophet that's seen that blind man uh healed is the same Prophet that said there's coming a church that he's the one that stood up and seen the vision and said there's coming a super race that shall defeat the enemy why not take that promise for yourself nothing can anal it nothing can disregard it nothing can turn turn it aside it the vision has already been seen the vision if we want to look let's just look at another Vision where brother Bram had seen the amen he had he had seen

showing you amen William brandom there is an alpha church and there will be an Omega Church what God done in the beginning he's going to do in the ending put your faith on that and you can rise in Victory can you say Amen brother brandom says the Christian faith is based solidly upon rest that's right a Christian is not tossed about a a Christian doesn't run from place to place a Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a Christian rest it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary that's right sickness may come and disappointments but the Christian is at rest knowing this that God is able to keep that which he has performed can you say Amen oh can you say amen amen when we accept God's word and release our faith well there is no telling what we used to sing a song Back in Pentecost there is no telling what God can do if you'll believe there is no telling what God can do if you just believe can you say Amen I've cried oh Lord and He healed my body and he healed my mind there is no telling what God can do if you'll believe amen when you reach that place when you accept God's word amen and that word creates expectation then you go into preparation and all skepticism is kicked out all doubt is crouched amen amen all sin has been put under the blood you're stepping pure and clean and faultless before God then you can rest whatsoever things you desire when you come before God you can have there's nothing too big there's nothing too little you want a closer walk with God you can have a closer walk if you want amen more greater fellowship if you need your healing you can have it here this morning you say but but but but but you got to get that butt out of the way and you have got to begin to see what God sees you got to start dreaming the way God dreams I'm talking about glorious expectations that has been sent from above amen do I hear an a shout of Amen here get out of those mly grub get out of that defeat get out of that discouragement and take God at his word so that you can rise in the power and the promise that God has given you in this day amen so it's that Holy Spirit that ignites the faith in you and

he h he's had a cause to test the people everything is done for a cause he's doing the same thing now he sends us signs and wonders among the people he sends the gospel truth amen and let them look over it to some Creed and deny the real truth and take the Creed deny this take that when they know the Bible teaches contrary that why but he does it for a test is this our absolute he wants us to rest in that can you say Amen now man you remember the man dream I'm closing you remember the man that dreamed of a little bitty devil coming after him and the little and the little bitty devil would
