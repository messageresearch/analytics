we're going to start at the 36th verse and we will read to the end of the chapter and um praise the Lord we're just so glad to to be uh uh a Christian here today so glad to be called a Son of God here in Luke 7 and 36 and one of the Pharisees desired him Jesus that he would eat with him and he went you know brother brandham says Jesus will always go where he is invited and he went into to the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus set at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with ointment and when the Pharisee with which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner and Jesus answering said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he said Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 P the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seest thou this woman I entered into thine house and thou gavest me no water for my feet but shees washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time that I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou D not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many yes are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that said it meet with him begin to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace let's bow our heads father as we look at this scripture and what a sober thought Lord we thank you for who you are and what you are and this morning we want to give what is due you we want to recognize you for who you are our savior Our God our our King Our Father and we want to worship you and we want to give you that which is owed to you Lord oh God we thank you for who you are and what you've done for every one of us thank you Lord Lord for saving our souls and healing our bodies and Lord preparing a place for us to come when this life is over and we thank you for it father now Lord we want to give you glory and honor this morning and we ask that you would anoint the words that are said may they be honorable to you and give Glory To You Lord anoint me Lord as I Endeavor to speak anoint the people Lord and the ears to hear you and may we all come into your presence Lord CU that's what we long to do is to set at your feet give honor to you we love you father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated we want to maybe title this this morning the cost of my praise the the cost there many people doesn't know what's behind when you see someone who is a worshipper when you see someone I was in last year um as we were at brother Ben prutz and while I was preaching there was a uh a lady there that was um worshipping and up on her feet and coming up the aisle and and um uh she just tears in her eyes as we preached and and finally I stopped and I said you know for those who don't know and maybe you're wondering what this what's wrong with this woman I said if You' have known this woman before this woman at one time had her hair cut like oh like a Butch and uh tattoos all over and the last time I was in service with her she was a woman that was bound in sin and bound in shame and she looked as she looked around and seen all of the beautiful women and the she felt out of place but it's been one year since I've seen this lady and now this lady is a beautiful Christian and she is throwing everything she can at me right now because she wants God to know that she a appreciates yes sir what he done for her I think we should never we should never forget what God has done for us as we look here at this story and it's the story of our master and of a Pharisee and a sinner brother brandham would preach a sermon an entire sermon on this and called washing jesus' feet and and we look at this self-styled Pharisee as as the Pharisees were an elite group of men they were they were schooled in the law they prided themselves in their knowledge they prided themselves in their lineage being able to take their lineage all the way back to Abraham they prided themselves in Moses the prophet they they they live their life in such a way to try to bring uh uh uh lift themselves in in such a a a way to where people would look at them and and see them as as as men of God these men were wealthy man who lived off of the tithing of the people and amen the the the the the sacrifices that were brought in they and their families would live uh very well they were and because of this and man it it the Israel had no uh middle class it was either a very rich people or a very poor people there was no in between and and so they felt that they were of a higher order and and um more higher than the Common Man and it was a common knowledge that each tried to outperform the other each of these Pharisees the scripture says that they would fast often out on the street corners and many many day uh uh two and uh uh three uh times a week would would go out with their very long prayers they'd have their fies and they would read prayers and and they would be on the street busy street corners so as to draw attention of their spirituality and man uh Jesus even mentioned that uh made mention that these Pharisees that fast and they have their long faces and they they they look mournful they want the people to see am man that they are giving honor to God and so as we look here of course if you were to look at the word Pharisee the very word Pharisee means actor amen they they were actors they were self-styled they were self-righteous in short they were Hypocrites man they longed for the Praises of men they wanted the Praises of men more than they wanted the Praises of God therefore they were out trying to to look holy and these men and uh went to Great uh uh steps in order to do this and so as we look at them and and how that they would give to the poor as long as there were cameras around if there were cameras and they would they would uh anything that they done they would do it amen in order to be seen by the people because their position mattered and and and so we look here that this Simon asking Jesus to come and a prophet would tell us he would say he would ask why would Simon the Pharisee invite Jesus to his place in the first place they had nothing in common Jesus was a poor man the Pharisee was a very rich man Jesus had no Seminary training amen he had he he was he he was criticized and mocked as illegitimate which was not allowed to be even a part of any kind of priest or Prophet these these men were trained from birth Amen to be priest they were they were brought up and they were tutored to be great men Jesus had the life and the words amen and the had the power of Heaven behind them but the Pharisees were nothing more than just actors and they amen uh they had nothing knew nothing about the Living God why would they ask Jesus to come why would he want Jesus to come and to be a part of of of his home amen birds of a feather flock together right amen the old people have things in common that's the that's the reason why we've got the old the golden eagle group you know we get together and amen and and um or for you old folks I just come to help Carrie canes and in uh Dentures amen but uh the uh the the you you the young people have have uh uh they they have things in common Hunters have things in common golfers have things in common fishermen have things in common amen single women have things in common married women have things in common we all have things in common Jesus and this Pharisee had absolutely nothing in common but yet Jesus was invited it's an incredible thing why would Jesus why would Jesus leave his campaign why would Jes Jesus stopped as as the prophet would say as The Courier was sent to find Jesus and and he searched through out Galilee and he wasn't here anymore he was here last week and he's but he's not there and he's went and he finally found him and and as they're trying to come up and get and as he's trying to get an audience with Jesus and and and and Andrew's standing there saying listen you can't get through this line the Master's just got from the pulpit he has just been praying he is tired we've got to let him go but The Courier says I've just got to say one thing to him he is I we want to invite him to Simon the Pharisees house Simon was a very he was a he was a very uh uh well-known man a great reputation and when Jesus heard it Jesus says tell your master that I will come I will visit with him Peter standing there saying listen master you know that there is a rabbit in the wood pile somewhere there is a reason why the Pharisee is asking you to come you know those guys and their tricks but Jesus says where I'm invited I will come Jesus will always come where he's invited can you say Amen even if he's going to be made fun of Jesus will come where he's invited you see what did this Pharisee he have up his sleeve amen seeing that he greatly despised Jesus brother bradam would tell us that the Pharisee was looking for some kind of a special attention to make him look like he was to to to to sort of put him on the map among all of the other the other phes and no one had ever invited Jesus to come into his home and to be a part of such a amen uh a a meal and a party as as the Pharisee was wanting to put on and he thought if I could just throw a big party amen I might be able to fit a little better in the ministerial uh H alliances and bring a little bit of attention to capernium and Galilee and and this he done and he and he and he looked he he he invited all of his high raking friends and he he brought in amen all of the Pharisees from around the country and all of the wealthy men of the city amen and and and he he worked very hard to get him there and and as the prophet would tell us he he killed the fatted Lambs and the calves and they put everything together and this was going to be quite an occasion for capernium it was going to bring people in from all over the country to be a part of this Jesus was going to be there and they were going to belittle Jesus they were going to make fun of him they were going to let him know that he isn't quite what the people thinks he is he might have the crowds and he might have people following him but he knows nothing about the law and he knows nothing about amen we're the wealthy people you see the lower class we would never be able to fit into such kind of events they were never invited into these kind of events the Pharisees were were they they did not believe in mingling with the people they would hurt their reputation the poor and the uneducated were simply left without they were the priest to pray for the people and the people the poor people could not attend in any way this these kinds of functions am man they didn't understand the law anyways the uneducated they knew nothing about the law the uneducated they knew nothing about anything that Jesus would or that the Pharisees would know about so it's best for them to just stay out uh of the way but they invited Jesus for the one purpose and that is to make fun of him they invited Jesus for pure entertainment that's right friends I I don't want to just come I I I I I look at it I I look at the at at at our situation today here in America and Jesus has been invited to a lot of places and there's a lot of Pharisees and there's a lot of mega churches Mega this Mega that first church of so and so this way First Church of so and so that way everyone's trying to outdo one another everyone is trying to put on the biggest dog they're trying to do amen and they invite Jesus along and they they they they do it for one purpose to get the people there and and they they they do their best to try amen to outdo one another can you say amen amen and it's a shame because Jesus is in this generation greater than he's ever been in any other generation Jesus has made himself known in this generation as he promised he would make himself known greater than any other generation he came amen uh in in his physical body there on that day and yet Jesus is sitting in a corner of some church when he should be the guest of honor upon a platform Jesus in his word has been has been removed amen and made fun of and has has has been amen diminished into the eyes in the eyes and the minds of the people you see the Pharisee was going to teach this Galilean Prophet a lesson he was popular with the common man amen but he didn't have any denominational background he didn't have uh am man in wealth and these men were going to show him that amen they knew a little bit more Jesus stopped his busy schedule yeah to go show up to a bunch of Pharisees self- Rell folks who did not love him who did not want him who were going to make fun of him oh can you say Amen the Pharisee the Pharisee it was on purpose that they left Jesus without his feet washed yeah it he there was a purpose a a a willful act to not wash his feet and to amen and and and and to uh give him slippers and and you see because it was it was very common in those days that they would do this when a when you had a guest that would come in and and you you had a guest to your house and this was a common practice everywhere amen that they had a little servant brother Brandon would call him a footwash flunky and and this servant would come and and and and as you would walk in your feet would be all dirty amen be because of the uh of the Dust of the roads and of course the animals walking down the roads too and amen and and it would get so Sultry and so the humidity over there and it it be so sweaty and the dust would would get all over your legs and and on your on on your feet and you would smell and and and the the Palestinian Sun would would beat down upon your neck and and you would be uh uh you would you know get sunburnt and and as you were to when you walked in the first thing they would do is they would set you down and they would remove your sandals and they would clean the sandals up and then they would take the pale of water and and they would begin to wash your legs and your feet and and and would get all of the crud off of them and then they would take you over to another place and would Place slippers upon your upon your hand on your feet amen these were nice little soft slippers that you could use on the inside of the house and then they would take you amen amen and would pour oil upon your face and upon your neck and they would rub it in and amen and it had a really wonderful sweet uh uh perfume to it and amen and then lastly then the guest or the host would come and and he would he would come in and he would give you a a kiss and now it wasn't a kiss on the lips it was amen the way they used to do that Hallelujah come here kylin I'm going to show you how they kissed praise the Lord hallelujah but this is the way that they would that your your your host would meet you and he would and then he would come and this was a kiss of Welcome right this was this was the host saying when you receive that kind of an honor it was a host saying you're welcome in my house wherever I I you want to go you're welcome to the refrigerator if they had them you're welcome to whatever I had have you can sit thank you you can lay on my bed you can you can sit on my couch you can do whatever you want to do amen you are welcome and and and all of those important guests all of those special men every one of them receive that treatment but when Jesus came in they left him sitting there with his feet dirty amen they left him s sitting there with no slippers on they left him sitting there feeling like he was unwelcomed and yet Jesus came at the bidding of Simon the Pharisee Amen on there the master the very creator of heavens and earth was sitting right there in their midst with dirty feet they're the very God Of Heaven who had promised amen where God said unto us a a virgin a child is born and you shall call his name Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father he he was sitting right there in their midst and those Pharisees left him with dirty feet what were they doing well they were toasting and man drinking out of their goblets and eating eating the the finest of the meals the the the neighbors could smell it oh my when Pharisee would put on one of his shin digs all of the poor it would draw the poor and and the poor would come looking over the fence and they weren't allowed to come in and touch it would taint them they were never allowed to to to mingle but they would sit there and just amen see what all was going on and looking through the windows and seeing the amen the the the food and and and just dreaming and and daydreaming and and and and and longing many of them Longing To to be a part of it now everything was there everything was going everything thing and but there with this woman she was one of those that were looking in the fence and and as she's looking over the fence and she's seeing all of these things it wasn't the first time she had come and seen the occasion many of times but as she was gazing across that fence and she looked in a window and she saw Jesus that's right sitting there with dirty feet when she seen him there was something about this man and she had been hearing about that Galilean prophet and she could hardly take her eyes off of him and she wondered could this man that's in the corner could he be that Prophet could he be that Messiah could could could this be isn't this Jesus of Nazareth isn't this the one that has been Healing The Sick isn't this the galileon that's been preaching all over the country and they look there and she's seeing Jesus sitting there by himself and she could see the dust on his clothes and the dirt and Grime on his feet and she could see the amen the dust in his hair and and she she began she begin to wonder why is he sitting alone in the corner why surely these great dignitaries would know who this man is how has he been overlooked and the Bible says that this woman as she begin to look this woman's heart begin to break and she begin to cry un uncontrollably she sobbed as she gazed into the window and she thought if I could only get to him if I could only get to him I would wash his feet if I could only get to Jesus I I would anoint him with oil if I could only get to Jesus amen and just then she had a thought amen and then in shame she dismissed missed that thought as impossible and not not even a possibility but the thought kept gnawing at her as she's looking there and beholding in tears and then suddenly she leaves the fits in a hurry and she's going down the back road down this road and down this alley and through this back road and goes down through this other alley and up the stairs into the upper room where she lived and she picked up some money some coins gathered them up put them in her little Shaw as everything that she had and she put it in there and she scurried across town to the perfume shop and she entered into the shop with her head tucked now she wasn't welcome even in the perfume shop she she this this woman was not a very good woman this woman was a she was a harlot this woman was not even supposed to be in society and she bowed her head and walked up to the counter amen the merchant sneered as she walked in said what do you want your kind is not welcomed here and and she said if you just give me the very best ointment you have the man laughed at her and said you don't have the money for the best ointment the woman said please sir I've got enough just let me buy this ointment the other customers were looking around and she said please sir I want the best you have I I I don't know as I begin to think about this this week and I didn't really know how what which way to go and I thought I'm just going to I'm just going to get up and just tell the story you see in that Alabaster Box was the ointment or it was it was the spike nard or they call it in short nard and it it it was an uncommon perfume that was brought in from India and the process of making this fume this perfume was lengthy it was a long process it was a costly process and they kept it in the little Alabaster Box now the alabaster box it was a stone that was uh uh uh that that they would use matters of fact the uh uh uh a lot of Solomon's Temple there was a lot of alabaster that was in that Temple and they would make this Stone and it would it it it wouldn't allow the the ointment to leak out and it was quite a costly uh the alabaster was quite a costly deal as well and and and so she she's begging please to her I have the money and she unwrapped her little apron and she laid it out there and he counted the money and he's looking at her and and and asking what H how in the world would a woman of your profession be able to have this money and she's looking at it she's saying I've been saving this money up because I I don't want this kind of profession anymore I want to live in a different place I want to be able to I would love to have a different P profession I this money I've been saving for as long as I can remember but I want to buy that perfume she laid the money down he took it he gave her the alabaster box with the oil Oh Glory to gun I wonder sometimes I wonder sometimes if we're in our self-righteousness whether we want to call it self-righteousness or not if we want to just look and if we can't just look and see maybe maybe we've not Fallen hard enough maybe we've not had it rough enough maybe we've not maybe we've not been sinner big enough maybe we've not had things enough to maybe we don't recognize the beauty of the Savior when we do see him maybe we don't understand the awesomeness of his presence when we come into His presence maybe we don't quite can you say Amen but you see this woman as she carefully tucked the alabaster box and of the precious oil and into her side and scurried back across town and all the thoughts all the thoughts that were in her mind was and what if she re what if he rejects me what if I get CAU what what if one of those priests take me and do what the law said to do they're all together they're all trying to outperform one another what what if I die what if they Stone me but she kept it going and she made it past the she made it past the the guards and she came behind Jesus and the Bible says that she begin to weep I I I just want to tell you I don't I I don't think God's Jesus is going to reject anybody that's got a pen in heart when she arrived at Pharisees house and there there he sat all alone and as Simon was entertaining all of his buddies and trying to look big in front of everyone the intensity of this love of this woman to Jesus she come up behind him and she didn't have to get a pale of water she just knelt down and she started weeping and crying and she took her own tears and she's weeping and she's washing his feet getting all of the grime and all of the junk off and she would stop and she would kiss the feet getting the dirt all over her face and and she took her hair and she begin to wipe the feet and getting the grime off and she cried and wept and kissed and she she would wipe him with her hair and she was washing Jesus feet with her very own tears and his very own hair and her sobbing her sobbing must have tracked the tension of the Pharisees and as they begin to look around there she is she's break she's broke open the the alabaster seal and she's tapping it and she pours it all over his feet and she continues to kiss and continues to wipe and continues to cry and continues to to wash his feet by this time there was no more toasting going on there was no more there was there there was there was no more eating there was now everyone's attention is looking here at this at this at this woman and looking at this supposed prophet and the Pharisee was thinking in himself he said if this man was a prophet he would know that this woman is a sinner he would never let that woman tell touch him what what is he doing letting a harlot touch his feet what is he doing allowing her to kiss him and to WIP but as everything gotten cold and stone silent she stopped she looked around she said I've been had now what is Jesus going to say is he going to rebuke me in front of everyone is he going to cast me aside will he do me like all the other men have done what about these guys that are staring at me in disgust I don't belong here what if they Stone me if you were a harlot in those days you've committed adultery you were to be taken out in the Public Square and to be stoned and killed there she stood or she knelt that all of the guests were looking at her Jesus was looking looking at her there this woman all the time Stood Still she's wondering oh glory to God as the eyes were looking upon the prostitute and and the scorn and the disbelief on the face of these men and as Simon looked and at this woman that was hair all messed up at oil and tears and all of the grime of Jesus feet all in her hair and oil all over her face and the mud and the stench all over her she's looking up tears still coming down her face then Jesus said those words Simon I want to say something to you Simon Simon Says SE on if you want to follow me there in Luke 7 and 40 Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he said Master say on there was a certain debtor that had two debts or there were certain creditor who had two debtors one owed 500 Pence and the other 50 when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both and tell me tell me Simon which one loves him the most most Simon would say well the one that that that owes the most he would be the one that would love the most Jesus says you've said right you've said well is that Simon I've came like you invited me to come you didn't wash my feet yet this woman ever since she's been here has done nothing but wash my feet with her tears he says you've gave me no water for my feet but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time that I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou D not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment there's a reason there's a reason this woman is so passionately doing what she's doing in giving me love and honor I I I I I want to tell you there's a reason there's a reason why you devote yourself so much to Christ you devote your so yourself so much to his cause and you devote yourself so much to his his his entertaining him and loving him is because you do love him there's something within your heart that loves him can I get a witness here this morning you don't come to the church for the entertainment thankful for the music we're thankful for the songs we're thankful for the pre good preachers that that's not why we come to church we're not coming for entertainment we're coming to entertain we're not coming because we've got big youth groups we're not coming because we have big buildings you're not coming because there's so many things that the church has to offer we're coming because we want to see Jesus and we want to give honor to that one that we know has come to this generation are you hearing me I I don't want to come to church to to receive I come to church to give of myself to my master oh can you say Amen it's that one that knows the need that knows what God has done and they're so thankful for what God has done that they're going to give of themselves over they're going to throw themselves at his feet and don't matter what other people think or what other people say or what other people do there's one thing they have in their mind they want to get to Jesus and they want to give him what he deserves because he is worthy of it not worried about this Pharisees Simon not worrying about his buddies not worried about anything else there's only one thing that we have in our mind and our heart and that is to give him the honor and the glory that he deserves because Jesus is not just setting in a corner with dirty feet Jesus has been kicked out of the house until Jesus is no longer even a part of it they want him they sing to him they do all of this but they're ashamed of who he is they've got their own Prestige they've got their own way they got and they have no room for Jesus he's talking to Simon I love this and then when he continues to talk to Simon he said Simon and the Bible says he turned to the woman I say unto thee her sins her sins which are many are forgiven could you imagine if you were that prostitute was sitting there at the feet of Jesus thy sins her sins talking to the Pharisee Simon her sins which are many are forgiven her Simon if you could recognize who I am you could have had it Simon if you only knew what I'm here to do you could be forgiven of your self-righteousness but you've got your own little thing going on between you and God and you can't see what I have well praise the Lord times hasn't changed much there's still a lot of Pharisees around the country but this little woman what did Jesus say for she has loved much if you were to read that she said it says wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and then he turned to her and he looked at this little lady she wasn't even a lady this little woman and said thy sins are forgiven as we think along these lines here this morning that song that Sister Amy Sung you don't know the cost of the oil in my Alabaster Box you don't know the cost of the praise if you were there when Jesus found me you did not feel what I felt when he put his loving arms around me you don't you don't know what it feels but I do know what it feels I love him I love him so much this morning as we sit here we're not a rich church we have don't have much to I brag about probably don't have a lot of money in our accounts and but that's okay because that's not what God is looking for he's looking for someone that can recognize him for who he is for what he is I I I want I I want I want this church I I I I I want this church to be a church full of those little prostitutes and Mary magdalin and the poor and I I I I don't I don't mind that's where Jesus felt at home I don't want to be the high class if the Lord wants to fill our church that that's fine I don't ask for rich people all I ask for is people who can recognize his presence and to love him all I want is is to be a part of somebody that that can feel that touch that Jesus feels and that can be his arms and it can be his feet and but can you say Amen it can be that can be that that God has called us to be that can re out but praise the Lord because that's what Christ has come he's he's not come for the he's not come for those who have the life put together he's come for those who can recognize who he is as we prepare to close this morning have you recognized him is church or do you walk with him or is Christianity just a church deal for you how long has it been since you've entertained him in your home how long has it been since you've entertained him in your heart they couldn't recognize him because he was an illegitimate born self-proclaimed Prophet didn't come the way of the priest didn't come the lineage of Aaron they could go all the way back they couldn't accept him but I wonder in this generation and this bride coming of Jesus Christ if we can re recognize that the only God that this people will ever see this generation will ever see is in you I wonder I wonder if it can really if it's really hitting our hearts that God is still in a body here on the earth he's in human beings he's in men and women boys and girls he's touching through your hands he's reaching through your body he's giving through you not a virgin born son but a harlot who has found Grace with God and has changed her around until the Harlot becomes a lady and now God is touching people the one who knows what it is to feel pain who knows what it is to hurt who knows what it is to cry who knows what it is not to have a daddy not to have a mom who knows what it is not to have a husband or not to have a wife or not to have a daddy or not to have a son someone who can feel the pain for somebody else somebody that can reach out into that Supernatural realm and bring God down physically through you it can only come through a Mary her she didn't call her name Mary there's two or three different accounts given and of women washing jesus' feet this is a separate account it seems in scripture from from the other Mary but this woman because she loved him it wasn't just her giving of herself to him she' done all she could do that's all she could do they they said history says that the money would have been a year salary for the average person and she had saved this saved this for year after year after year all to put in one little alabaster box of oil are we willing to take everything that we are and to advance vested into the Christ take all of our Prestige take all of our wants take whatever we think is right or wrong whatever we are everything we are and lay it at his feet say I'm giving it to I love you I worship you I adore you I give myself holy to hear him
