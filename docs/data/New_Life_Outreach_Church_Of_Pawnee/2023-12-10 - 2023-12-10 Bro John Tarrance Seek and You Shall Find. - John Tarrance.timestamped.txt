[36:58] we're grown men right we're not supposed

[39:47] this pull pit again brother wendor
[39:50] trusting us to have a word from the Lord
[39:53] amen uh if you have your Bibles let's go
[39:56] to Genesis
[39:58] 32 actually I'm sorry let's go to 31 and
[40:05] 11 I'm going to do this the new way and
[40:08] do it actually off my iPad for a change
[40:10] so you all forgive
[40:13] me uh I'm not real
[40:16] sophisticated at least that's what my
[40:18] kids see
[40:21] so praise the Lord uh well they they say
[40:25] you need to learn something new every
[40:26] day right that that's what they say
[40:28] praise the Lord but it truly is an honor
[40:30] to be in the house of God because you
[40:31] know there is one day that it's not
[40:32] going to happen there's going to come a
[40:34] day when the doors are closed and you're
[40:36] not going to be able to have meat to
[40:38] eat so let's honor this day and let's
[40:40] rejoice in this day and let's be happy
[40:43] to go to the house of God because I
[40:45] believe the scripture says I was happy
[40:47] when they called unto me right let us go
[40:50] to the house of the Lord because one day
[40:52] it won't be Genesis
[40:54] 3111 to 13 and the angel of God spake
[40:58] unto me in a dream saying Jacob and I
[41:02] said here am I and he said lift up now
[41:05] thine eyes and see all the Rams which
[41:07] leap

[41:13] it I see I used an iPad Kaye all right
[41:17] 31 and 11 sorry forgive me brothers and
[41:20] sisters and the angel of God spake unto
[41:23] me in a dream saying Jacob and I said
[41:25] here am I and he said said lift up now
[41:27] thine eyes and see all the Rams which
[41:29] leap upon the cattle or rings strik
[41:32] speckled and grizzled for I have seen
[41:34] all that laan doeth unto thee I am the
[41:38] god of bethl where thou anointest the
[41:41] pillar and where thou bowest a vow unto
[41:44] me now arise get thee out from this land
[41:49] and return unto the land of thy
[41:55] kindred get thee out of this land and go
[41:58] back to where you came from I like that
[42:02] I like that and then
[42:05] Genesis
[42:07] 32 and
[42:14] one and Jacob went on his way and the
[42:18] angels of God met
[42:19] him and when Jacob saw them he said this
[42:22] is God's host and he called the name of
[42:25] that place
[42:27] Mahna a aim mahannah aim we'll use that

[43:14] name thank you y'all can be
[43:16] seated I do get a bit nervous sometimes
[43:20] and especially when I'm excited and
[43:22] tonight I'm excited because after that
[43:24] sermon this morning my goodness how
[43:26] could we not be excited right I mean
[43:28] we're Overcomers and and the crazy part
[43:32] of it is is we've already done it now I
[43:34] mean
[43:35] because we've already seen the end of
[43:37] the book so we already know we made it
[43:39] so we're already
[43:41] there so wow amen amen but in this story
[43:47] of Jacob a little thought came to me and
[43:50] I was studying on it and I've been
[43:52] studying on it for a while and then when
[43:54] the call came I went ahead and and tried
[43:56] to put it together and then after this
[43:57] morning I was like Wow and then you all
[44:00] get up here and sing all these songs and
[44:02] I was like okay cuz the title of my
[44:04] sermon tonight if I had one is seek and
[44:07] you'll
[44:09] find so uh that's uh the title and now
[44:13] let's see if we stick to it right but
[44:15] seek and you'll find yeah
[44:20] so Jacob's in another land another place
[44:25] in his life
[44:26] Believe It or Not of his own
[44:29] choosing okay he was there because he
[44:31] was a a Shyer he was a liar a
[44:36] cheat a thief he literally
[44:40] stole Esau's blessings
[44:44] right now this is the guy that's going
[44:46] to Father the tribes of
[44:51] Israel and he stole his blessings all
[44:55] right right
[44:57] yeah now I'm not sitting up here telling
[44:59] you to go steal something that ain't
[45:01] that ain't what I'm trying to say what
[45:02] I'm saying is is he ended up in this
[45:04] land Yeah by his own choices right he
[45:08] ended up in this land because he put
[45:12] himself
[45:15] there had he followed the
[45:21] rules I want to say that again had he
[45:24] followed the rules
[45:26] Esau would have gotten the Earthly
[45:30] blessing but he still would have got the
[45:33] Heavenly
[45:38] blessing God plans this out and he has
[45:41] it and he knows what's going to happen
[45:43] and he's not going to change
[45:45] it all right okay but you see Jacob was
[45:48] like one of the greatest he had a drive
[45:52] to succeed yeah he had a drive to be the
[45:55] best he had the drive to have
[45:58] everything so much so that when they
[46:01] were born he was trying to pull Esau
[46:04] back in so he could get out first and if
[46:06] that ain't competitive I don't know what
[46:09] is right he wanted to be first he had a
[46:13] drive he had something in him that said
[46:17] I am the
[46:18] firstborn I am the son of my father I am
[46:22] the
[46:23] blessing right this is my mine and there
[46:27] was something in him that said I'm going
[46:30] to take it it's mine come
[46:34] on and he didn't go to prayer he didn't
[46:37] go to God and say well God how are you
[46:39] planning on doing this because I know my
[46:41] calling Moses was the same way he's like
[46:44] I know my calling and he ends up
[46:45] murdering
[46:47] somebody all right he knew his calling
[46:50] in his heart his calling
[46:53] was to be the father of the tribes of
[46:58] Israel so he went about to make
[47:01] sure that
[47:04] happened and he was
[47:08] blessed oh he was blessed we're going to
[47:11] go in the scriptures and I'm going to
[47:12] tell you how much he was blessed here in
[47:13] just a minute because for back then he
[47:16] had a lot of
[47:17] stuff he had a lot of material stuff God
[47:22] blessed him with everything he touched
[47:24] and when somebody tried to him God
[47:26] showed him how to fix it somebody said
[47:28] no this ain't going to work God showed
[47:30] him because he was the Seed of Abraham
[47:32] he was going to be blessed but oh all
[47:35] the wrong way but God still blessed him
[47:38] because that's God's word God said seek
[47:41] and you'll find That's the Law that's
[47:42] the rule that's where it is so he's I
[47:46] want it and he went after it and brother
[47:47] he got it that's the word of
[47:51] God all the way up
[47:54] until he can no longer stay because he
[47:57] has outstayed his welcome at laan's
[48:00] house now he's already outstayed his
[48:02] welcome at home now he's outstay is
[48:04] welcome at laan's house he has nowhere
[48:07] to go and God says finally and he goes
[48:10] down to him get up and go home yeah he's
[48:14] like go home God said yes go home I got
[48:18] this I'll take care of it I'm going to
[48:20] bless you you're going to have seed and
[48:22] it's going to be this and God did God
[48:24] said I'm going to bless you you're going
[48:26] to be fine go home come on so he said
[48:31] okay and he gathers everybody up because
[48:33] he knows if he stays he's in trouble I
[48:36] mean he just took all the laban's
[48:40] cattle don't don't you see the pattern
[48:43] he done took all the I mean he couldn't
[48:44] have stayed if he wanted to so God said
[48:47] all right you got to go but you're going
[48:49] home you're going back to where you came
[48:53] from but you got to remember where we
[48:55] came from
[48:58] right Jacob didn't
[49:01] come from a lineage of sneaks and
[49:05] cheats he came as the Seed of Abraham
[49:10] which was God's
[49:12] seed so he came from
[49:15] God so God said go
[49:19] home come back to me come back to
[49:23] righteousness come back to the word
[49:26] come back to where I will bless you
[49:30] right and I will bless you when you get
[49:33] there I will your seed will run just
[49:35] like I promised Abraham everything will
[49:37] be there it'll be for you go home come
[49:42] back and so Jacob followed what God Said
[49:45] and he took off now there was one time
[49:48] in this that God had a son and he told
[49:50] him go and take care of the the garden
[49:53] and all this and I'm going to rest and
[49:55] and and I'll meet you over here in the
[49:57] evening and he shows up there and Adam
[49:59] wasn't
[50:02] there he's like huh so he goes running
[50:05] all around Adam where are you Adam where
[50:08] are you of course you all know that
[50:10] story he's over there hiding because he
[50:12] messed up so he said all right I'm going
[50:14] to send my angels to meet this one but
[50:17] guess what he followed the word of the
[50:19] Lord he was on his way home and he met
[50:22] the host of Heaven Come on all right
[50:25] right where he was supposed to be on his
[50:29] way
[50:30] home
[50:35] okay praise the
[50:37] Lord and the angel of the god spake unto
[50:41] me and said go home and then when Jacob
[50:43] done
[50:44] that the angels of God met him and when
[50:46] Jacob saw them he said this is God's
[50:51] host okay he knew who it was there was
[50:53] no doubt in his mind
[50:56] and then he got this bright idea to send
[50:59] some Scouts ahead to go see what it
[51:02] looks like and smooth everything over
[51:04] with Esau so he could just slide right
[51:08] back in right so he sends them over
[51:11] there and they come back and said well
[51:14] he sure is happy to see you and he's
[51:17] coming with 400
[51:20] men Jacob was like oh
[51:22] my he's like well how about that
[51:26] so here he is exactly where God told him
[51:30] to
[51:31] be exactly where the host of Heavens met
[51:35] him in the line of his duty at the time
[51:39] which was to get
[51:41] home and he's standing there protected
[51:44] surrounded God even showed him the host
[51:48] of heaven and he got
[51:53] scared he got scared brother
[51:56] window he got
[51:59] tempted he got
[52:05] scared so he decides once again to take
[52:08] everything in his own
[52:09] hands he says we're going to split this
[52:11] up and I want half of my people over
[52:13] there and I want half of them over here
[52:14] that way per chance he takes that half
[52:16] this half Will Survive now the question
[52:18] of the day is which one was he going to
[52:19] be in is he going to wait until he sees
[52:22] if that one's destroyed and hi tell it
[52:23] to that one I mean he is a shyer
[52:26] right so what was he planning on doing
[52:29] while the two of them was getting
[52:30] whatever you know because you got the
[52:32] problem is he split it in two I mean
[52:34] come on this is Jacob he's a Shyer you
[52:37] know he split it in two one to send to
[52:39] Esau and one to send to Laban while he
[52:42] snuck out through the
[52:45] woods you know that's what he was
[52:48] doing at least that's what I got out of
[52:51] it other otherwise I mean he was saving
[52:53] his own skin
[52:56] that's what he was doing but but it was
[52:59] it was actually the pressure of the
[53:03] moment I think that got under his skin
[53:07] he was looking at this servant guy who
[53:09] told him 400 men was coming and he
[53:12] didn't believe he could honestly tell
[53:15] him that everything was going to be
[53:18] okay and the pressure of it got too
[53:21] much and he just started doing things on
[53:24] his own again again he was doing stuff
[53:28] on his own that got him in this
[53:29] predicament to start with by the
[53:34] way I don't like doing things on my own
[53:37] because I mess it up too Jacob is one of
[53:40] the closest people in the Bible to me
[53:42] other than
[53:46] Peter
[53:48] so and the messenger returns to Jacob
[53:50] saying we came to thy brother Esau and
[53:52] also he cometh to meet thee in 400 men
[53:55] with him then Jacob was greatly afraid
[53:57] and distressed and he divided the people
[53:59] that was with him and the flocks and
[54:01] herds and the camels into two bands and
[54:04] said if Esau come to one company and
[54:06] smite it then the other company which is
[54:08] left shall escape and
[54:12] then Jacob went and
[54:16] prayed he made his choices he made his
[54:18] decisions and then he went and done
[54:20] everything and then he went and
[54:24] prayed
[54:31] backwards and Jacob said oh god of My
[54:34] Father Abraham and God of my father
[54:37] Isaac the Lord which said is unto
[54:42] me all
[54:45] right I love that he's like all right
[54:48] I've made all my decisions and I've done
[54:49] everything and I've got this the way I
[54:51] think it ought to be but Lord you told
[54:54] me
[54:55] you told me you saidst unto me return
[55:00] unto thy country you saidst unto me to
[55:03] go to the country and thy Kindred and I
[55:06] will deal well with
[55:10] thee now he's
[55:12] seeking for a good outcome of his
[55:16] decision okay you see God already told
[55:19] him what to do and he's in the middle of
[55:20] doing it but he didn't really trust how
[55:22] he was doing it so he went and made a
[55:23] bunch of decisions moved everything
[55:25] around and then went back to God and
[55:27] said now you said this was going to turn
[55:29] out all right so everything that I've
[55:31] done should be
[55:32] fine because you
[55:36] said split them all up and I done all
[55:38] this because you
[55:40] said you
[55:47] said we're going to get there then he
[55:51] said and Lord you said you would deal
[55:54] well with me he said I'm not worthy here
[55:58] we go now he's getting somewhere and I'm
[56:01] not worthy of the least of all the
[56:03] mercies and of all the truth which thou
[56:06] has showed unto thy servant for with my
[56:08] staff I passed over this Jordan and now
[56:11] I am become two bands see he's admitted
[56:14] now that he's separated there's two of
[56:17] them instead of one of them United they
[56:19] might have could have fought divided
[56:21] they had no chance
[56:23] none okay
[56:26] and now I am become two bands deliver me
[56:30] I pray thee from the hand of my brother
[56:32] from the hand of Esau for I fear Him
[56:35] lest he will come and smite me and the
[56:38] mother with the children I love this he
[56:40] throws the women and children in before
[56:42] God as well he's like you know help me
[56:45] Lord uh for them but help me Lord for
[56:51] them after he's already messed it up
[56:54] divided his forces yeah I mean he's done
[56:57] and now he's like Lord you know help me
[56:59] for
[57:03] them and thou sest he's doing it again
[57:06] and thou sest I will surely do thee good
[57:09] and make thy seed as the sand of the sea
[57:12] which cannot be numbered for multitude
[57:14] see now he's bringing it right back
[57:16] again to the women and children because
[57:18] without the children wears the seed so
[57:21] he's reminding God you can't let him
[57:23] take my kids either
[57:26] I I know I messed this up I know I
[57:28] separated it but God you
[57:30] said you
[57:33] said and then he lodged there that night
[57:39] okay and he took that which he had to
[57:43] his hand at the
[57:46] present this is what he had 200 she
[57:49] goats 20 he goats 200 oo Hughes o
[57:54] however youd say that 20 Rams 30 camels
[57:56] with their Colts 40 kind 10 Bulls 20
[58:00] donkeys and 10 fos and he delivered them
[58:03] into the hands of his servants every
[58:05] drove by themselves and said unto his
[58:07] servants pass over before me and put a
[58:11] space betx drove and drove and he
[58:14] commanded the foremost saying when Esau
[58:16] my brother meth thee and askest thee
[58:19] saying who art thou and whether goest
[58:23] thou and who are the before thee then
[58:26] Thou shalt
[58:28] say they be thy servant
[58:30] Jacob's now he's his servant he cheated
[58:33] him out of his Birthright cheated him
[58:35] out of his Blessing but now he's a
[58:37] servant
[58:39] okay they be thy servant Jacob's it is a
[58:42] present sent unto me unto my Lord Esau
[58:45] and behold also he is behind us and so
[58:48] commanded he the second and the third
[58:50] and all the following the drove saying
[58:52] on this manner shall ye speak to Esau
[58:54] and say ye more moreover Behold thy
[58:56] servant Jacob is behind us for he said I
[58:59] will appease him with the present that
[59:02] goeth before me and afterward I will see
[59:05] his face per Adventure he will accept of
[59:09] me so when the present so went the
[59:13] present over before him and himself
[59:15] lodged the night in the company so
[59:17] basically what he was doing was taking
[59:19] the blessing that he stole and trying to
[59:21] give it
[59:23] back
[59:25] basically that's what he's doing because
[59:27] he took the blessing the Earthly
[59:28] blessing which is you know when he
[59:30] blessed the firstborn the firstborn gets
[59:32] everything the firstborn gets the cattle
[59:35] it gets the mules it gets everything the
[59:37] servants all of that so basically what
[59:39] he was doing was taking the blessing
[59:41] that he stole from
[59:43] Esau and is now trying to hand it back
[59:47] to Esau and say maybe he'll forgive me
[59:51] if I put him make him Rich basically
[59:56] okay all
[59:58] right so went the present over before
[1:00:01] him and himself lodged that night in the
[1:00:05] company but something still ain't
[1:00:07] setting right with
[1:00:10] Jacob how could it he's a child of
[1:00:14] God it wasn't his Blessing to steal and
[1:00:18] it ain't his Blessing to give
[1:00:22] away see that's the hardest part to
[1:00:25] understand I think sometimes the things
[1:00:29] God gives us isn't
[1:00:33] ours now he says be good with your money
[1:00:36] and then he says and if somebody asking
[1:00:38] you have it give it and don't even think
[1:00:40] about getting it back that's what the
[1:00:42] scripture says because it's his money do
[1:00:45] with it what he pleases so if he sends
[1:00:47] somebody to you okay you see see where
[1:00:50] I'm going if he heals you then it's for
[1:00:53] him the healing is given to you so that
[1:00:56] you in turn can be his
[1:00:59] mouthpiece the vessel he's going to use
[1:01:02] now to bring that to somebody else right
[1:01:06] because if you've been healed of heart
[1:01:08] disease your testimony has enough life
[1:01:12] in it and enough feeling in it that it
[1:01:14] brings people to go oh they've lived
[1:01:17] through this they know what this is they
[1:01:20] can help me because they have compassion
[1:01:22] and empathy for me they know what I'm
[1:01:26] going through so when God heals you and
[1:01:28] he heals your body and it's a done deal
[1:01:31] he done it before the foundation of the
[1:01:33] world and one way or another you will be
[1:01:35] healed on either on this Earth or when
[1:01:36] you step foot in your next body I mean
[1:01:39] that healing is promised to you so I
[1:01:41] firmly believe that when you're healed
[1:01:43] on this Earth it is maybe 25% for you
[1:01:46] and 75% for God because he's not done
[1:01:50] with you come
[1:01:53] on because if he was done with you and
[1:01:55] your purpose had run its course and
[1:01:56] you've done what you're supposed to do
[1:01:58] then God's going to take you home it's
[1:02:01] simple that's right well he said it I
[1:02:04] mean he says it plain as day he would
[1:02:05] shorten the time least the very elect be
[1:02:09] deceived that's what he said and I'm
[1:02:12] glad Lord come quickly it's harder and
[1:02:15] harder and harder to make it in this
[1:02:18] world than it has ever been you're out
[1:02:21] there at work and you're fighting it and
[1:02:23] you're fighting it and you're fight it
[1:02:24] and things are throw back into your face
[1:02:27] people don't even know who they are
[1:02:30] people don't even know what they
[1:02:33] are come on brother they're human beings
[1:02:37] that's what they
[1:02:38] are you can't tell them that
[1:02:43] yeah that's the truth I mean you can't
[1:02:45] tell them I I have talked to the guys at
[1:02:48] work and sometimes they listen sometimes
[1:02:50] they don't and it's kind of funny
[1:02:52] because one day we were all just sitting
[1:02:53] around talking and and next thing you
[1:02:54] know I I looked up and I got like a 20
[1:02:56] member congregation in the middle of the
[1:02:59] warehouse and everybody just listening
[1:03:01] listening listening then finally I was
[1:03:03] like I'm going to get in trouble the
[1:03:04] boss walks out here you know so I kept
[1:03:06] talking to Marcus which is the one I was
[1:03:08] talking to and everybody else was
[1:03:09] listening and and we were just saying
[1:03:11] this and that and he was he was like
[1:03:13] yeah but I don't understand it he said
[1:03:14] I'm a Christian but I just wish I could
[1:03:16] do this he said I wish I could do that I
[1:03:20] would love to be able to do this and I
[1:03:21] said why and he he said well you know to
[1:03:25] be accepted to be a part of the group to
[1:03:27] be a part of the norm he said I would
[1:03:30] love to be able you know to go and and
[1:03:32] and have a few drinks and this and that
[1:03:34] I said yeah I said but I I don't look at
[1:03:36] it that way this is where this started
[1:03:38] now by this time I guess they're all
[1:03:40] gathering around they listening to what
[1:03:43] preach is going to say as they call me
[1:03:46] um so and they're listening I said I
[1:03:48] look at this totally
[1:03:49] different I it's not that I don't get to
[1:03:52] do anything I I it there is nothing in
[1:03:56] the law of Christ that tells me I can't
[1:03:59] do anything I don't want to
[1:04:03] do come on and he and he kind of looked
[1:04:06] at me he said but I want to I said
[1:04:08] really he said yes I said you
[1:04:11] want to go that route yes I said have
[1:04:16] you ever drank
[1:04:20] no have you ever been at those parties
[1:04:23] and seen what they're like no I was like
[1:04:26] be
[1:04:28] thankful because I can't forget them
[1:04:31] yeah come on and he was looking at me he
[1:04:34] I said it's not that you don't get to do
[1:04:38] it it's that you don't have to do
[1:04:44] it you see Jacob didn't have to split up
[1:04:47] his bands he didn't have to send them
[1:04:50] out in front of him hopefully Esau would
[1:04:52] kill all of them before it got to him
[1:04:53] Jacob jaob didn't have to do any of that
[1:04:57] all he had to do was follow what God
[1:04:59] Said and go home that's right it's all
[1:05:03] he had to do follow what God Said and go
[1:05:06] home because brothers and sisters I can
[1:05:09] promise you you don't want to go the
[1:05:11] route that I went you don't want to go
[1:05:14] the route I'm sure that brother Joel can
[1:05:15] tell you about and sister Stephanie you
[1:05:18] do not that is not fun come on all right
[1:05:23] oh it starts out maybe like it is but it
[1:05:26] never stops
[1:05:28] there because if you seek you're going
[1:05:32] to find
[1:05:33] it let's just get this out of the way if
[1:05:36] you seek for something you're going to
[1:05:38] find it true if you seek for the devil
[1:05:41] you're going to find
[1:05:44] him if you go out here and look at all
[1:05:46] this Hollywood and all the makeup and
[1:05:48] all of the clothes and everything that's
[1:05:51] going on and you're going to look at all
[1:05:52] that guess what you're going to find
[1:05:55] he's going to put it right in front of
[1:05:59] you you seek for that and you know what
[1:06:02] you're going to get you're going to get
[1:06:03] the anxiety brother you're going to get
[1:06:05] the depression you're going to get all
[1:06:06] of it because you're actually looking
[1:06:08] for it and the law of God says if you
[1:06:11] seek you'll find it if you knock on the
[1:06:14] door it's going to
[1:06:16] open that's what it
[1:06:19] says so if you go and you knock on the
[1:06:22] door of Satan's house
[1:06:24] he's going to open the door that's
[1:06:28] right don't go
[1:06:31] looking because I promise you you don't
[1:06:33] want
[1:06:35] it you
[1:06:39] don't anyways I don't know if he ever
[1:06:41] went to the party or not his wife's a
[1:06:45] good woman so he probably not but anyway
[1:06:47] they were all listen to it and of course
[1:06:49] I went into a little bit more detail you
[1:06:50] know I don't have to crawl home through
[1:06:53] my own puke I don't have to you know
[1:06:55] what I mean because that's where that
[1:06:57] stuff leads to that's right that's where
[1:06:59] it leads to Satan gets a control of you
[1:07:00] and you lose control of it that's what
[1:07:03] happens and once you lose control you
[1:07:05] swear up and down you're in
[1:07:07] control you're like oh no I got this i
[1:07:10] got this i got this no you don't the
[1:07:12] only person that's got that Satan and
[1:07:14] he's using
[1:07:16] you that's a well that that one's
[1:07:21] free so Jacob went at the prayer again
[1:07:25] and he's like
[1:07:26] Lord this is what's going on everybody
[1:07:30] SE separated he went out by itself
[1:07:32] because now he knows he's in a pickle
[1:07:34] because he messed up again again I like
[1:07:37] how you said that this morning brother
[1:07:39] you know we make mistakes we do things
[1:07:41] doesn't mean we're lost Jacob sitting
[1:07:43] there he messed up again he's like
[1:07:46] Lord we're here then all in a sudden
[1:07:51] he's wrestling with the man now now you
[1:07:54] would think he knew who it was right
[1:07:55] away because you don't just all in a
[1:07:56] sudden start wrestling with a man
[1:07:58] usually you have to find them there's
[1:07:59] some words throw back and forth and the
[1:08:01] argument here or there and then you
[1:08:02] start wrestling you don't just wake up
[1:08:04] wrestling a guy you know it doesn't work
[1:08:06] that way but it did I guess this time
[1:08:08] because he said and Jacob was left alone
[1:08:11] so he was alone and there Wrestled a man
[1:08:13] with him how could he be alone and then
[1:08:15] there Wrestled a man with him because I
[1:08:17] mean he obviously wasn't there right
[1:08:21] until the breaking of the day and when
[1:08:23] he saw that prevailed not against him
[1:08:26] now now this is the crazy part because
[1:08:28] when I first read that when I was
[1:08:30] younger I thought that meant Jacob
[1:08:33] wasn't prevailing against the
[1:08:36] man let's read it and when he saw that
[1:08:39] he prevailed not against him he touched
[1:08:42] the hollow of his thigh and the hollow
[1:08:44] of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he
[1:08:46] wrestled with him so basically this man
[1:08:51] was wrestling with Jacob and couldn't
[1:08:53] beat him
[1:08:54] he was wrestling away now whether he
[1:08:56] couldn't beat him out of choice or
[1:08:58] whether he couldn't beat him out of
[1:08:59] because Jacob was tough one or the other
[1:09:03] and finally he said man you got to let
[1:09:06] me
[1:09:08] go and Jacob heard the
[1:09:12] voice and it made a a certain
[1:09:15] sound and he's like oh wait a second
[1:09:18] uh-uh now he's in seeking mode and he
[1:09:22] said nope I'm not going to let you you
[1:09:24] go till you bless me wait wait a second
[1:09:28] he was already
[1:09:31] blessed he was a rich man he had
[1:09:34] everything that you could think of he
[1:09:35] even had God's word allowing him to go
[1:09:38] home but it wasn't enough all right
[1:09:43] Jacob said I am not going to let go of
[1:09:46] you until you bless
[1:09:50] me not the one that pretended to be e es
[1:09:53] a that's living under the blessing that
[1:09:56] was Esau's that was given to him by God
[1:09:59] because we all knew who was going to be
[1:10:01] Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated but
[1:10:04] he finally said no you're going to bless
[1:10:08] me the real me the me that's out here
[1:10:11] alone praying to you God in desperation
[1:10:15] he's on his knees and Jacob is finally
[1:10:20] Jacob he's no longer pretending to be
[1:10:22] somebody he's not
[1:10:24] he's no longer dressing up as something
[1:10:26] he's not he's no
[1:10:29] longer pretending to be a
[1:10:31] Christian he's no longer pretending to
[1:10:34] be a Son of God he's no longer
[1:10:36] pretending to be a firstborn he's no
[1:10:38] longer pretending he even remotely
[1:10:40] deserves the blessings that he got and
[1:10:43] he's like I am not going to let go of
[1:10:46] you now he's in seek mode he realized he
[1:10:50] has his hands on the body of God
[1:10:56] and he says I am not going to let go of
[1:11:00] you until you bless
[1:11:05] me the broken
[1:11:08] me the messed up
[1:11:11] me not the Blessed
[1:11:15] guy that looks like he has everything
[1:11:18] that pretends he's the man that pretends
[1:11:21] everything's going great that pretends
[1:11:23] like is good that pretends he has no
[1:11:27] problems yeah because he had a lot of
[1:11:30] problems he said Lord I need you to
[1:11:33] bless
[1:11:35] me and God said I can't do that unless
[1:11:39] you let
[1:11:42] go let go of what it wasn't let go of
[1:11:48] God it would let go of
[1:11:50] himself he had to let go of the pretense
[1:11:55] on he had to let go of the untruth he
[1:11:59] had to let go of everything that he held
[1:12:01] dear he had to seek for the truth he had
[1:12:06] to find the truth in
[1:12:09] himself and that truth
[1:12:13] was I'm a
[1:12:15] thief I'm a
[1:12:17] liar and believe it or not every single
[1:12:21] one of us are
[1:12:25] yeah when you take that moment that
[1:12:27] should have been God's and put it to
[1:12:29] something else you stole God's
[1:12:34] time on it's the truth wasn't your time
[1:12:37] to give up that one's
[1:12:40] free it had to come back to who Jacob
[1:12:43] was because immediately God said okay
[1:12:46] but what's your
[1:12:48] name I bet in his mind he was thinking
[1:12:51] do I say Esau I mean that's how I got my
[1:12:53] blessings the first time he's like no
[1:12:56] I'm Jacob and God said I
[1:12:59] know but I'm going to call you
[1:13:03] Israel because I keep my word and I told
[1:13:06] you you were going to be the prince and
[1:13:08] I told you you were going to Father the
[1:13:10] Nations I told you that the tribes were
[1:13:12] coming I told you to go home that I was
[1:13:14] going to take care of you I told you all
[1:13:16] this so but for you to believe it I now
[1:13:18] must call you Israel so every time you
[1:13:20] say your
[1:13:21] name it brings about Faith because now
[1:13:24] he's
[1:13:26] hearing that he's
[1:13:28] Israel now he's hearing that he's the
[1:13:32] children now he's hearing that he's the
[1:13:35] every time somebody called him Israel he
[1:13:37] was hearing his nation's
[1:13:41] name all right God said that's all right
[1:13:45] but then God turned right around and
[1:13:47] tells everybody you know in the name of
[1:13:49] Abraham Isaac and Jacob Abraham one
[1:13:52] place or two maybe he said Abraham Isaac
[1:13:54] and Israel but in almost every single
[1:13:56] place God didn't call him Israel God
[1:13:59] called him
[1:14:02] Jacob but that was for you and that was
[1:14:06] for
[1:14:07] me because God remembered who Israel was
[1:14:12] God forgave
[1:14:13] him blessed him because his word done
[1:14:18] it but God said Jacob for you and me
[1:14:24] because if he can forgive that man he
[1:14:27] can forgive me amen if he can give him a
[1:14:31] new name he can give me a new name if he
[1:14:36] can give oh brother if he could give
[1:14:38] Peter a new name he can give me a new
[1:14:42] name he can give Saul the murderer of
[1:14:45] Christians a new name he can give me a
[1:14:48] new
[1:14:50] name I am no longer called a thief I am
[1:14:54] no longer called a drug addict I am no
[1:14:57] longer called an alcoholic and I will
[1:15:00] not go seeking those names back out I
[1:15:02] don't want
[1:15:05] them God pulled me out of that God took
[1:15:08] me out of that and he gave me a new name
[1:15:10] and that name was Son of God that name
[1:15:14] was Mrs Jesus
[1:15:17] Christ that's the name he gave me he
[1:15:20] gave me the name delivered he gave gave
[1:15:23] me the name redeemed he gave me the name
[1:15:27] okay okay yes okay I'm okay I'm fine
[1:15:32] Lord oh brother I know your life I know
[1:15:34] your finances don't you worry about that
[1:15:36] God's Got That under control I'm fine my
[1:15:39] name's on the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:15:41] I'm fine my head may hurt but I'm fine
[1:15:45] all is well and you know why it's well
[1:15:48] because he changed my name to
[1:15:52] his he didn't just give me any name he
[1:15:55] didn't just pick a name he didn't call
[1:15:57] me
[1:15:58] Israel he didn't call me Abraham no he
[1:16:02] said uhuh if you overcome I'm going to
[1:16:04] bring you up here you're going to sit
[1:16:05] with me you're going to sit right beside
[1:16:07] me and to do that I'm going to make you
[1:16:09] my wife that way nobody can even say
[1:16:11] nothing about it because everybody know
[1:16:13] the wife's place is next to the husband
[1:16:15] plain and simple all right you want to
[1:16:17] know where my wife belongs with me amen
[1:16:21] now she's in Georgia right now taking
[1:16:23] care of family but that's okay because
[1:16:25] she took me with her I promise I mean
[1:16:27] you can tell by looking at me I ain't
[1:16:29] all
[1:16:32] here
[1:16:33] so that's where we belong so he changed
[1:16:37] your name he changed your identity he
[1:16:41] changed who you are and the only way he
[1:16:46] could do it was to actually
[1:16:50] physically change you
[1:16:54] yes
[1:16:55] okay the dove can lead a lamb but the
[1:16:59] dove can't lead a
[1:17:03] goat nobody can lead a goat you can push
[1:17:07] him you can hit him and you can beat him
[1:17:11] but you sure ain't going to lead him you
[1:17:14] can tie a rope around its neck and
[1:17:16] somehow or another and I know cuz my
[1:17:17] wife done milk goats for years and I
[1:17:19] would put a rope around it and I'd take
[1:17:21] off walking and some how or another that
[1:17:24] Crazy Goat would get them
[1:17:27] horns stuck in a hole that big how did
[1:17:32] it get its entire head in a hole that
[1:17:35] big when I was pulling it the opposite
[1:17:37] direction that's a
[1:17:41] goat but sheep once they get used to you
[1:17:45] and they know your voice and you go out
[1:17:47] there you don't even have to really say
[1:17:49] much if they know the sound that you're
[1:17:51] going to make you can walk out the sheep
[1:17:53] and just
[1:17:54] go here they all come feeding time I
[1:17:57] heard that I know that's certain
[1:17:59] sound o I heard my name yes I
[1:18:04] heard there's my name again o there's
[1:18:08] I'm getting closer because my name's
[1:18:09] getting louder brother wend I'm getting
[1:18:11] so close I can hear it ringing in my
[1:18:14] head time is at hand look up your
[1:18:17] Redemption is nigh your name is no
[1:18:19] longer an Earthly name your name is
[1:18:23] misses Jesus
[1:18:26] Christ and in that
[1:18:30] name Jesus Christ all things are
[1:18:34] possible
[1:18:38] amen what' he give you to fight
[1:18:42] with the word that's what he gave you to
[1:18:45] fight with right he said you go fight
[1:18:48] and I'll show you how to do it and
[1:18:50] everything he defeated he defeated by
[1:18:51] the word he gave you the word and then
[1:18:54] he gave you the authority to wield this
[1:18:57] word
[1:18:58] right he gave you the authority to take
[1:19:01] this word and stand upon it as Sons and
[1:19:03] Daughters of God God the Bride of Jesus
[1:19:06] Christ and speak a Living
[1:19:11] Word so do you realize you have the
[1:19:15] authority to
[1:19:17] direct
[1:19:21] God
[1:19:24] he was the word he is the
[1:19:30] word not that you'll actually ever
[1:19:32] direct him because you never was the
[1:19:34] Seeker of God to start
[1:19:37] with Bible say Seek and you'll find then
[1:19:39] he turned right around and said I won't
[1:19:41] lose one of them he made his own law he
[1:19:43] put his own law on the place and said if
[1:19:45] you seek you'll fine and then he said
[1:19:48] like the Lost lamb I'm going to go seek
[1:19:50] him he made the law for himself so he
[1:19:53] wouldn't lose one he said my father said
[1:19:55] I wouldn't lose one how because if I
[1:19:57] seek mine I'm going to find him because
[1:19:59] the word says
[1:20:01] right it is written seek and you shall
[1:20:04] find so how can he lose one his own word
[1:20:07] says if he'll seek he'll
[1:20:11] find so yeah he's not going to lose the
[1:20:14] one so it ain't you doing the seing it
[1:20:17] ain't you doing the running it ain't
[1:20:19] even you using the
[1:20:21] authority him
[1:20:24] because if he puts it in your heart to
[1:20:26] pray for someone that's actually him
[1:20:29] seeking that
[1:20:31] person that burden that he puts upon you
[1:20:34] is him seeking somebody you think you're
[1:20:38] here by
[1:20:40] chance you think you're sitting in a
[1:20:42] message Church by chance come on uhuh
[1:20:47] first he called you called you what out
[1:20:51] of that and then he chose you to sit
[1:20:55] here and then he chose you to be here
[1:20:59] and then he chose you to hear his word
[1:21:01] and then he chose you to accept his word
[1:21:05] why so he could use you his word but he
[1:21:10] is the word but you are the word but he
[1:21:12] is the word but you are the
[1:21:15] word does that make sense oh yeah he's
[1:21:18] the word you're the word the word seeks
[1:21:22] it's you you that does the seeking but
[1:21:25] it's
[1:21:26] him seek and you shall find so what is
[1:21:30] it exactly are we seeking is it
[1:21:35] riches is it Earthly things that ain't
[1:21:40] what he's seeking he said I won't lose
[1:21:42] the one of them amen so if he's seeking
[1:21:46] his bride we should be seeking his
[1:21:51] bride if that's what he's looking for
[1:21:54] that is what we should be looking
[1:21:56] for and then he said these signs shall
[1:22:00] follow them that believe so if you're
[1:22:04] doing God's work and you're the word and
[1:22:06] he's the word and you're the word and
[1:22:08] he's the word and you're all out there
[1:22:10] searching and looking and you're
[1:22:12] searching for him in spirit and in truth
[1:22:14] because you know the truth is he's the
[1:22:16] one looking for you and looking for
[1:22:18] someone else through you he's doing the
[1:22:19] seeking he's doing the searching and you
[1:22:21] just happen to be there to be a part of
[1:22:23] it at that particular
[1:22:28] moment brothers and
[1:22:30] sisters you are the
[1:22:35] word he's the
[1:22:41] word and they
[1:22:43] said
[1:22:47] come come to what a new
[1:22:51] name
[1:22:53] you don't need the old name anymore the
[1:22:55] old name is worthless it won't even get
[1:22:58] you
[1:22:59] nowhere it gets you
[1:23:01] absolutely nowhere all
[1:23:05] right you know the prodical
[1:23:08] son he was finally came to himself and
[1:23:11] realized I can be a servant my my father
[1:23:13] will do that for me and he headed home
[1:23:16] so here comes a prodical son and his dad
[1:23:19] setting up there and then the Bible says
[1:23:23] his dad saw him a far off yeah it didn't
[1:23:27] say the prodical son saw the
[1:23:29] father it didn't say that so that only
[1:23:32] meant his father had to be watching for
[1:23:37] the
[1:23:37] son yes
[1:23:40] sir and then all in a sudden the man
[1:23:42] jumps up and goes that's my son he takes
[1:23:45] off after him running after him right we
[1:23:48] we know the story and he goes running
[1:23:50] and he grabs him and like you said this
[1:23:52] morning you know brought him in gave him
[1:23:54] the robes gave him the ring gave him all
[1:23:56] that brought him back just like he never
[1:23:57] left and his brother was
[1:24:00] like well you never done that for
[1:24:04] me you never gave me the big fat cat you
[1:24:07] never had a party for
[1:24:09] me I've been here this whole time I've
[1:24:12] worked this Farm I've I've
[1:24:17] I've and he looks at him and says then
[1:24:20] you should I ask
[1:24:25] you should ask seek and you'll find and
[1:24:29] if you do it the right way these signs
[1:24:32] shall follow them that believe so if you
[1:24:35] want to know what I'm seeking for today
[1:24:39] is that
[1:24:40] name the name that he's given me let me
[1:24:44] read this to you Revelations 2: 17 he
[1:24:48] that ha a he ear let him hear what the
[1:24:51] spirit saith unto the churches to him
[1:24:53] that overcometh will I give to eat of
[1:24:55] the Hidden mana and will give him a
[1:24:57] white stone and in the stone a new name
[1:25:00] written which no man knoweth saving the
[1:25:03] one that receives itess Lord and then in
[1:25:07] Revelations 3 and12 him that overcometh
[1:25:09] will I make a pillar in the temple of my
[1:25:11] God and he shall go no more out and I
[1:25:14] will write upon him the name of my God
[1:25:17] and the name of the city of my God which
[1:25:21] is new Jerusalem which cometh down out
[1:25:24] of Heaven from my God and I will Rite
[1:25:26] upon him my new name amen the name of
[1:25:33] God his new name and he writes it upon
[1:25:37] you miss Jesus
[1:25:40] Christ and in that name you shall land
[1:25:45] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:25:46] recover in that name you can pray for
[1:25:49] people and they receive salvation in
[1:25:52] that that name you can impart the Holy
[1:25:54] Spirit not in you the bride but in the
[1:25:57] authority of the name of Jesus
[1:25:59] Christ which is the name he's given
[1:26:04] you he gave you
[1:26:08] himself he didn't give you a servant he
[1:26:12] didn't give you the neighbor he didn't
[1:26:15] give you another guy that takes up a
[1:26:17] spot of Heaven he didn't give you any
[1:26:20] other thing he gave you the greatest
[1:26:23] gift he could ever give you the greatest
[1:26:28] gift you will ever receive the greatest
[1:26:31] gift that has ever been known to man and
[1:26:33] that is he gave you
[1:26:38] him he gave you
[1:26:46] himself praise the Lord and sometimes we
[1:26:49] just throw it
[1:26:51] back
[1:26:53] oh yeah seek and you'll find you seek
[1:26:57] all the drama you seek all the
[1:26:59] negativity you you're going to get it
[1:27:03] like the brother said doesn't mean
[1:27:04] you're not
[1:27:06] saved man on
[1:27:09] man I don't want to live that way I'm
[1:27:11] going to seek a new name that's right
[1:27:13] Bible said he'd give me a new song in
[1:27:15] the night why a new
[1:27:17] song because everything about me's
[1:27:19] changed I can't sing the old songs
[1:27:21] brother because I don't relate to the
[1:27:22] old songs anymore I can't sing the old
[1:27:25] country songs because my wife loves me
[1:27:26] so she ain't cheating on me so how can I
[1:27:28] sing country songs brother how can I see
[1:27:31] rock
[1:27:32] songs I mean I don't do the alcohol and
[1:27:35] I don't do the drugs so how can I sing
[1:27:36] the rock songs because that's no longer
[1:27:38] me I can no longer sing songs about that
[1:27:40] because that's not me that's right
[1:27:44] that's where I came from but that's not
[1:27:48] me I have a new name so I should seek
[1:27:52] things that go along with that name amen
[1:27:58] and that is life that's
[1:28:02] right
[1:28:04] eternal
[1:28:05] life that should be what we seek and
[1:28:10] that is right here and by the power of
[1:28:14] the Holy Spirit it will live in your
[1:28:17] life and before you tell me it's
[1:28:19] impossible you are too late
[1:28:24] that's right because it is
[1:28:26] possible I know it's
[1:28:28] possible I can
[1:28:30] remember laying in the jail cell Lord if
[1:28:34] you just get me out of here I swear I'll
[1:28:36] never come back lord you just get me out
[1:28:38] of here I'll do everything I'll do
[1:28:40] everything then that little voice inside
[1:28:42] my ear said you better be careful what
[1:28:44] you wish
[1:28:45] for better be careful what you promise
[1:28:48] you better be
[1:28:50] careful as long as I was in there I
[1:28:52] wanted out now when I got out it might
[1:28:55] have been a little bit of a different
[1:28:56] story but it never was the
[1:29:00] same it never was the same brother Joel
[1:29:04] I made a promise in there I couldn't
[1:29:06] keep all right yeah so I come out and
[1:29:11] what did I do right back in the pig
[1:29:14] wallet
[1:29:16] brother right back into it and you know
[1:29:19] what God did grabbed me by the hair of
[1:29:22] the head pulled me up out of it kicked
[1:29:25] me in the seat of the pants throwed me
[1:29:28] on the ground right in front of my wife
[1:29:31] and said
[1:29:35] no
[1:29:37] no and from that day forward everything
[1:29:40] changed right away no slowly but surely
[1:29:45] my record got expunged completely clean
[1:29:47] not even a not even a speeding ticket
[1:29:49] brother I mean they took it all the
[1:29:52] 24-hour overnights the the it was gone
[1:29:56] completely gone I should have lost my
[1:29:59] driver's license I should but no none of
[1:30:01] that gone completely
[1:30:04] gone huh I was like well that's that's
[1:30:07] pretty amazing you know and I'm telling
[1:30:08] April and she's all excited but I got to
[1:30:10] do 15 years house arrest for this
[1:30:12] because sis probation that's basically
[1:30:14] what it is you can't leave the house
[1:30:15] until six o'clock in the morning and
[1:30:17] you'd have to be home by
[1:30:18] 11: and in any in that time they drive
[1:30:22] up and so much as a beer bottle is in
[1:30:24] your yard whether somebody threw it out
[1:30:26] or it was yours it don't matter you're
[1:30:28] going Upstate PL and simple you get a
[1:30:31] speeding ticket you're going Upstate 15
[1:30:33] years of this is what they gave me five
[1:30:36] or three times of five years but they
[1:30:40] said they weren't going to run them all
[1:30:42] together it was five for one County five
[1:30:45] for another County and five for another
[1:30:47] County and I had to do this one and then
[1:30:50] this one and then this one so much so
[1:30:53] that last judge said this is like a
[1:30:55] domino effect I do not want to do this
[1:30:58] because if I do this and one Domino
[1:31:00] Falls they're all going to fall and I
[1:31:03] stood up and I said your honor it won't
[1:31:08] happen that's what I said he looked at
[1:31:11] me he said you'll be back here I said no
[1:31:13] sir I promise you you will never see me
[1:31:19] again and he Shrugged he said well it's
[1:31:22] what everybody's telling me to do it's
[1:31:24] okay and he signed off on it I knew I
[1:31:28] couldn't do
[1:31:29] it okay so I made PL of what was going
[1:31:33] to happen because I wasn't going back so
[1:31:36] when they come after me I made a lot of
[1:31:38] plans
[1:31:42] I I'd already been on my
[1:31:44] knees already got the okay from God
[1:31:47] everything was going to be okay cuz he
[1:31:48] let me out I mean he answered my prayer
[1:31:51] Lord if you just get me out of here he
[1:31:53] got me out of there that was a miracle
[1:31:55] in itself I mean
[1:31:58] seriously the judge is like no I don't
[1:32:00] want to do this this goes against
[1:32:01] everything I learned in school this goes
[1:32:04] against you know but
[1:32:06] no don't you see the same line as Jacob
[1:32:09] but I make up my own plans I'm GNA do
[1:32:11] this and I'm GNA do that and and I'm GNA
[1:32:13] do this and I'm gonna do that God said
[1:32:15] no you're not so he gave me
[1:32:19] April now it's the truth
[1:32:22] he did it was the love of April that
[1:32:25] made me want to
[1:32:29] live that is the truth it was God but he
[1:32:33] used April now no April wasn't trying to
[1:32:36] serve God at the time you understand we
[1:32:38] were young we were foolish we done crazy
[1:32:41] but God gave me her gave me something
[1:32:44] worth living
[1:32:45] for okay gave me something worth doing
[1:32:49] something for and then Peace by piece
[1:32:53] slowly but surely because my life wasn't
[1:32:56] just like a overnight miracle I mean it
[1:32:58] was sudden but not suddenly
[1:33:01] brother so it g PE and then all in a
[1:33:04] sudden April got
[1:33:06] saved and I'm gonna be honest with you
[1:33:08] I'm gonna do exactly what I did that
[1:33:09] night and and April forgive me but it's
[1:33:11] the truth I sat
[1:33:13] down and said Lord
[1:33:17] why I did I didn't want the don'ts
[1:33:21] brother I was raised in it I knew what
[1:33:24] it was like I was like
[1:33:26] Lord don't and and but her I was like oh
[1:33:29] praise the Lord baby praise praise the
[1:33:31] Lord you know that's my wife I love her
[1:33:33] I want her to be happy you know so and
[1:33:35] and this is the honest story I'm not
[1:33:37] cover nothing up I'm telling you the
[1:33:39] truth that was my thought pattern for
[1:33:42] years I lived my life she lived her life
[1:33:46] and we were happily married we didn't
[1:33:48] have an argument we didn't have a fight
[1:33:51] this truth
[1:33:52] we didn't have an argument we didn't
[1:33:53] have a knock down drag out fight she
[1:33:55] would come in there and say I wish you
[1:33:56] wouldn't do
[1:33:57] that now done and I'd
[1:34:04] go okay you're right I shouldn't do that
[1:34:07] it's the kids shouldn't be this way in
[1:34:09] front of them you're right okay first
[1:34:13] went was no smoking in the house then it
[1:34:15] was no smoking in the vehicles and then
[1:34:17] it was no music in the house then it was
[1:34:19] no music in the vehicles
[1:34:22] and we never argued and we never fought
[1:34:24] and she never told me not to do
[1:34:27] it you understand she never got up in my
[1:34:31] face and told me to do anything she was
[1:34:35] like well you know what brother brandham
[1:34:38] said and I'm like yeah but she's like
[1:34:41] but but you know I I I I I love it you
[1:34:44] know I love the message I'm like well I
[1:34:47] love you but I
[1:34:50] want
[1:34:52] okay I love you I'll do
[1:34:55] it Peace by peace until one day I woke
[1:35:00] up and I was like oh my goodness it's
[1:35:05] all
[1:35:08] gone except for the cigarettes that was
[1:35:11] the hardest battle I think I ever had
[1:35:14] and I think it's because God made me
[1:35:16] fight for that one the rest of them I
[1:35:19] done for her that one I done for
[1:35:21] him maybe that's the only thing I could
[1:35:24] think of because that's the truth the
[1:35:26] music went out because she asked me to
[1:35:28] didn't happen overnight the more I
[1:35:30] thought about it the more I felt bad the
[1:35:31] more I felt bad I was like oh my
[1:35:33] goodness I'm hurting her I'd see her off
[1:35:35] crying and praying in the bedroom and I
[1:35:37] just knew that it was all about
[1:35:40] me see I was seeking for the negativity
[1:35:43] so that's what I thought she's off in
[1:35:44] there she might have been praying for
[1:35:46] her family because she spent many many
[1:35:48] years on her knees for her family but
[1:35:50] every time I saw her in the there crying
[1:35:52] it was because of me and you know what
[1:35:54] it reminded me of is all the white hair
[1:35:56] on my
[1:35:57] mother and I'm like man no I don't want
[1:36:00] her to have white hair that young so
[1:36:03] music goes
[1:36:04] out but it but it but the Bible said you
[1:36:08] know that if the two are yolked together
[1:36:10] and they're okay with you being a
[1:36:12] Christian then stay together but just
[1:36:14] for chance the husband saved by the wife
[1:36:16] or the wife saved through the husband
[1:36:17] that's that's what the scriptures
[1:36:20] say because her place is by me and my
[1:36:23] place is by
[1:36:25] her come on and if you seek you'll find
[1:36:28] it you know what she wanted what she was
[1:36:31] seeking for it wasn't that I wouldn't
[1:36:34] listen to what I used to listen to that
[1:36:36] ain't what she was seeking for what she
[1:36:38] wanted was the man of the house in his
[1:36:41] position so that she could stop running
[1:36:46] it that's what she wanted because I
[1:36:48] lived my life she took care of the kids
[1:36:51] she made made the rules for the kids she
[1:36:52] took I mean she took them to church I
[1:36:56] worked and I mean I worked seven days a
[1:36:58] week 16 hours a
[1:37:04] day but she kept seeking and she kept
[1:37:07] crying and she kept Lord you promised
[1:37:10] Lord you said Lord you promised seeking
[1:37:13] looking for the right thing from what
[1:37:15] was within her the word beget the word
[1:37:20] and he here I
[1:37:23] stand was it be because of her power no
[1:37:28] was it because of her actual no but it I
[1:37:32] believe it's the authority that she had
[1:37:35] to use the word and in using the word
[1:37:39] she claimed her
[1:37:42] family I am part of that
[1:37:46] family and one day it became a big
[1:37:50] huge I mean I guess the word
[1:37:54] Epiphany to
[1:37:56] me I was a child of God the whole entire
[1:38:04] time you know how much stuff I could
[1:38:07] have saved if I had just done it when
[1:38:09] she done it because I knew I was
[1:38:10] supposed to I felt it
[1:38:16] here imagine the different life me and
[1:38:19] her could have had had I given my life
[1:38:21] to God then all right because God called
[1:38:26] me then he pricked my heart
[1:38:30] then why didn't I realize then yes I'm a
[1:38:33] child of God and go ahead and come in
[1:38:35] with my wife and we could have lived a
[1:38:37] whole different
[1:38:43] life that's what I'm asking you here
[1:38:47] today what are you seeking for seriously
[1:38:50] in your heart what are you looking
[1:38:52] for what are you seeking what do you
[1:38:54] want what do you want out of this
[1:38:59] life deep down in your heart what do you
[1:39:05] want and then check that with the
[1:39:09] word and if it matches the word you can
[1:39:14] pray for it and you can have it that's
[1:39:19] right in spirit
[1:39:22] and
[1:39:22] truth it's what the Bible
[1:39:25] says in spirit and truth you have the
[1:39:29] holy spirit inside of you you have the
[1:39:31] truth in your hand so let the truth come
[1:39:34] out your mouth and by the spirit The
[1:39:39] Authority seek that which is right and
[1:39:43] never
[1:39:45] stop never stop there is always more of
[1:39:50] God God to have there is always more
[1:39:53] people to come to God because when the
[1:39:55] last one comes in we're out we're still
[1:39:59] here we're still fighting we should
[1:40:00] still be seeking plain and simple
[1:40:04] brothers and
[1:40:07] sisters
[1:40:09] amen amen seek and you'll find but the
[1:40:14] truth of it is seek for a new
