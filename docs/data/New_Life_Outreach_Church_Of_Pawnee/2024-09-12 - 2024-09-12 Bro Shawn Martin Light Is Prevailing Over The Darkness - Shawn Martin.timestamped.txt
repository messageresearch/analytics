[52:35] just going to go right on to the
[52:37] word
[52:39] amen and
[52:41] um I want to first of all look maybe at
[52:45] the book of
[52:46] Ephesians the um the sixth
[52:53] chapter amen and just count it a an
[52:57] honor
[52:59] to uh preach um a meeting with um such
[53:04] uh men of great caliber brother Jonathan
[53:07] and brother Ben and praise the Lord and
[53:11] uh looking forward to a wonderful time
[53:12] in the
[53:14] Lord
[53:15] amen and so uh the book of Ephesians the
[53:19] 6th chapter and we're going to start at
[53:21] the 10th
[53:23] verse it says finally my brethren be
[53:25] strong in the Lord
[53:26] and in the power of His might put on the
[53:30] whole armor of God that you may be able
[53:32] to to stand against the Ws of the devil
[53:37] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[53:39] blood but against principalities against
[53:42] Powers against the rulers of the
[53:43] darkness of this
[53:45] world against spiritual wickedness in
[53:49] high
[53:50] places now if you would like to turn
[53:53] with me to the uh Book of Matthew
[53:57] Matthew the um 4th
[54:05] chapter
[54:09] and I'm going to start at maybe the 12th
[54:12] verse Matthew 4 and verse
[54:17] 12 it says now when Jesus had heard that
[54:20] John was cast into prison he departed
[54:22] into
[54:24] Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and
[54:27] dwelt in
[54:28] capernum which is upon the Sea Coast in
[54:31] the borders of zebulun and
[54:34] Nephilim that it might be fulfilled
[54:36] which was spoken by isaas the prophet
[54:40] saying the land of zabulon and the land
[54:43] of
[54:44] netham uh by the way of the sea Beyond
[54:47] Jordan Galilee of the
[54:49] Gentiles the people which sat in
[54:51] darkness saw great light and to them
[54:54] which sat in the region and shadow of
[54:57] death light is sprung up amen one more
[55:02] scripture and that's first Peter 2
[55:06] and9 amen first
[55:10] um Peter 2 and
[55:13] N then I'll let you have your
[55:17] seats praise the Lord very familiar
[55:20] scripture to us but it says you but you
[55:23] are a chosen generation a royal priest
[55:26] Ood a holy nation A peculiar people that
[55:29] you should show forth the Praises of him
[55:32] who hath called you out of Darkness Into
[55:36] His Marvelous
[55:38] Light which in time past were not a
[55:41] people but now but are now the people of
[55:44] God which had not obtained Mercy but now
[55:47] have obtained Mercy amen may the Lord
[55:52] just add a blessing to his word and you
[55:55] can
[55:56] have your seats for a moment or
[56:00] two amen and I guess if I would use a
[56:03] title I would um title it the light is
[56:07] prevailing over the
[56:09] darkness and um you know the Bible tells
[56:13] us that God has a purpose how many
[56:15] believes
[56:16] that and the Paul the Apostle Paul says
[56:20] that it is an eternal purpose amen
[56:23] meaning that it cannot fail it will
[56:25] always be and and I'm so glad that I'm
[56:30] part of that purpose how many believes
[56:31] you're part of the purpose of God Amen
[56:35] and uh not just that we're we're part of
[56:37] it but I I believe that we're in this
[56:41] age playing a a great part of uh uh
[56:46] God's uh uh purpose and uh for this time
[56:50] we are living in the end time of all
[56:54] things the end of all things the end of
[56:56] of time the end of of civilization as we
[57:00] know it to be we end of politics end of
[57:03] just everything and and which means that
[57:07] what God has been doing he is finishing
[57:10] up amen he is uh it's it's being
[57:14] finished up with with you and I do you
[57:16] believe that and so I I believe that
[57:19] we're the last people amen we're the
[57:22] last age we're the last generation uh we
[57:25] are the final voice to the final Age and
[57:29] and and this is important because we
[57:33] know that all of the saints that have
[57:36] gone on before us cannot be made perfect
[57:39] without us amen and so so this this age
[57:45] uh uh everything that God has done
[57:47] Through the Ages amen this this this age
[57:51] is the completion of of of it all so all
[57:55] the other ages are depending upon us now
[57:59] Calvary was a great thing and and I'm
[58:02] I'm I'm glad for Calvary we can't
[58:05] underestimate uh Calvary and what what
[58:07] was done there and and and and things
[58:10] but I I just believe that that the age
[58:13] that we're living in is even greater
[58:16] than what Calvary Calvary was in the
[58:19] fact that yes Calvary was a real battle
[58:22] that Jesus uh uh uh fought and and and
[58:26] that that battle was uh uh fought that
[58:29] we could be free how many believes that
[58:32] amen uh Calvary was was a battle that
[58:36] that Jesus fought for our healing for
[58:39] our deliverance for our Salvation amen
[58:42] for the changing of our body then and
[58:45] and everything Calvary uh was that and
[58:48] I'm I'm glad for that but in this day we
[58:52] are his victory do you believe that amen
[58:56] we are the proof that Calvary was
[58:59] effective we we are the proof that what
[59:03] Jesus did amen it's one thing to say
[59:06] I've overcome but we are the proof that
[59:09] he overcome amen and and and and
[59:12] everything when he said it is finished
[59:14] amen your salvation was finished your
[59:17] healing was finished everything was
[59:19] finished at Calvary amen but but what
[59:22] good would that be if if there was not a
[59:25] people to show the victory of that amen
[59:29] and so we are the people do you believe
[59:31] that amen but it's in this age that
[59:34] Believers are fighting harder than any
[59:37] other uh uh believer uh had to fight in
[59:41] any other age uh this is the battle amen
[59:45] and and the Warfare that is Raging we
[59:48] are it seems like we are fighting one
[59:51] battle after another battle after battle
[59:54] blow after blow and and and uh uh it's
[59:58] not just the elders it's not just the
[1:00:00] preachers it's it's it's it's it's you
[1:00:03] young people it's it's uh uh it it just
[1:00:06] seems it from all ages it seems like the
[1:00:09] devil is attacking and we we're we're
[1:00:12] we're facing the enemy where we feel it
[1:00:14] uh physically we feel it spiritually we
[1:00:17] feel it mentally it it it's just that
[1:00:20] way amen and brother brandom in his
[1:00:23] prayer one time said he said Lord thy
[1:00:25] children are struggling in these days
[1:00:28] for the oppression of the enemy is so
[1:00:31] strong amen I I'm sure you feel that do
[1:00:34] do you feel that it it's a pressure amen
[1:00:37] uh uh where you feel sometimes you feel
[1:00:39] lost sometimes you just don't feel like
[1:00:41] you're going to make it sometimes it's
[1:00:43] just a Warfare Amen in the mind and and
[1:00:47] the reason why is because of the contest
[1:00:51] amen uh uh uh that is going on uh which
[1:00:55] actually started in heaven Before Time
[1:00:58] Ever began amen and and we know that
[1:01:01] Satan rebelled against God Amen and
[1:01:05] caused 2third of the of the angels to
[1:01:08] follow after him which we would call
[1:01:11] them Fallen Angels or uh demonic spirits
[1:01:14] ain't that right amen and and the
[1:01:17] prophet said see amen now Satan was
[1:01:19] kicked out into the Earth God wasn't
[1:01:22] going to let that Rebellion stay up
[1:01:24] there amen so he kicked Satan out and
[1:01:27] all these uh uh uh uh followers uh
[1:01:30] demonic powwers uh uh spirits kick them
[1:01:33] out amen and the prophet said and then
[1:01:37] Satan become an enemy to God's people
[1:01:40] amen Satan Satan didn't humble himself
[1:01:43] he he didn't repent of of what he'd done
[1:01:46] but he has sought Amen to destroy God's
[1:01:50] kingdom he has sought to defy God and to
[1:01:54] keep God's word from prosper in anything
[1:01:57] that has to do with God Satan is against
[1:02:00] ain't that right and so the prophet
[1:02:02] would tell us now Satan was kicked out
[1:02:04] into the Earth and then he become an
[1:02:07] enemy to God's people and since then
[1:02:10] he's used all of his strength and his
[1:02:13] strategy to pull God's people uh across
[1:02:17] the fires or Into the Fire ain't that
[1:02:20] right now you know uh Abraham Lincoln
[1:02:23] one time said it's it's in the time of
[1:02:25] peace that you prepare for war amen and
[1:02:29] and and that is so true you you may be
[1:02:31] in a in a place right now that you're
[1:02:33] feeling joy and you're feeling peace and
[1:02:35] you're feeling you know everything is
[1:02:37] going good but but don't don't just
[1:02:40] settle there you better prepare for war
[1:02:43] you better prepare for a battle amen
[1:02:46] because it's coming it's it's not there
[1:02:48] there you can't do nothing about it you
[1:02:51] you can't run from it amen you can't
[1:02:53] hide from it you can't be sweet sweet
[1:02:56] enough from it you know you understand
[1:02:57] what I'm saying amen there ain't no
[1:02:59] preacher that can preach the biggest
[1:03:01] message and the baddest message amen
[1:03:04] except he's going to fight the devil
[1:03:05] every preacher fights the devil every
[1:03:08] every uh uh every saint fights the devil
[1:03:10] your mama fights your daddy fights your
[1:03:13] deacons fight amen your children fight
[1:03:15] everybody fights it can you say amen
[1:03:18] amen so brother brandom said see it's in
[1:03:20] a time while everything is running
[1:03:23] smooth you better get ready for Satan
[1:03:25] isn't going to let it run smooth very
[1:03:27] long you're in a convention now amen and
[1:03:30] everything would just pour along fine
[1:03:32] but you're going to leave here in a few
[1:03:35] days and you're going to meet the enemy
[1:03:37] and he may not even wait till you get
[1:03:39] ready to leave he might attack any time
[1:03:41] he's wicked and he's ruthless can you
[1:03:44] say Amen your enemy is wicked and he's
[1:03:48] ruthless he does not love you he wants
[1:03:51] to destroy you he'll take your mind
[1:03:54] he'll take your he'll take your health
[1:03:56] he'll take your spiritual Joy he'll
[1:03:59] Captivate you to where you can't even
[1:04:01] lift your hands to worship God anymore
[1:04:04] amen that's just the enemy that we're
[1:04:06] facing ain't that right he said see but
[1:04:08] he just carries on where whenever he can
[1:04:12] whatever he can say or do he does it
[1:04:14] right now see so it's best to be dressed
[1:04:17] all the time another place he says as we
[1:04:20] leave this building to go into our
[1:04:22] different places and our homes and to
[1:04:25] meet out outside to meet the world let
[1:04:27] us not go as we have in formal times
[1:04:31] don't don't meet the enemy like like
[1:04:33] maybe the other Church ages have don't
[1:04:36] don't meet the enemy like the the
[1:04:38] Pentecostals on austa street did don't
[1:04:40] you meet the enemy the way the
[1:04:42] denominations are trying to meet the
[1:04:43] enemy let's go let's not meet the enemy
[1:04:47] as we have in in formal times notice
[1:04:49] what he says let's go in the power of
[1:04:53] his resurrection let's go in the name of
[1:04:57] Jesus Christ with the banner High lifted
[1:05:00] high and with faith in his word to
[1:05:03] handle the two-edged sword with the
[1:05:05] shield and the full armor of God on to
[1:05:09] meet the enemy because he the enemy is
[1:05:12] getting stronger and more powerful every
[1:05:16] day can you say Amen your enem is not
[1:05:19] getting weaker he's getting more
[1:05:21] powerful he's getting more stronger amen
[1:05:25] he's he's doing everything he can can
[1:05:27] you say amen he sure is he so he says
[1:05:31] now notice he says if we've come to the
[1:05:33] end of these things and the mysteries of
[1:05:35] God has been completed with us we are
[1:05:39] looking for more strength more strength
[1:05:42] a rapturing strength to meet a worse
[1:05:45] Force that'll Rapture the church and
[1:05:48] take it into Glory we must have it so
[1:05:51] there is an enemy we're not we're this
[1:05:53] isn't a picnic this isn't just something
[1:05:55] that we just hang out you know and and
[1:05:58] and no no no when you start serving the
[1:06:00] lord that enem is after you too amen
[1:06:04] he's just after us this is why first
[1:06:06] Peter 5'8 says be sober be vigilant
[1:06:10] because your adversary not just an
[1:06:13] adversary but your adversary he's your
[1:06:16] personal he's been suited just for you
[1:06:19] he knows your ins he knows your outs he
[1:06:22] knows your nature he knows your makeup
[1:06:25] and he's your adversary he knows exactly
[1:06:28] where to come at you with he knows that
[1:06:31] your nervous problems he knows
[1:06:32] everything about you and he's your
[1:06:35] adversary he studies you can you say
[1:06:38] amen amen but he says he walks as a
[1:06:40] roaring lion seeking whom he may devire
[1:06:44] so I I say this because it's not God
[1:06:48] that is against you it's not God that
[1:06:51] has left you alone it's not the fact
[1:06:54] that God hates you it's it's not the
[1:06:57] fact that amen you've walked away from
[1:06:59] mercy and and it's just simply there's
[1:07:03] an enemy that is attacking it's he's on
[1:07:07] the attack at all times can you say Amen
[1:07:10] so it's not that God doesn't love you
[1:07:12] it's not that God isn't going to fulfill
[1:07:15] his word in you it isn't that God
[1:07:18] started out to and then all of a sudden
[1:07:20] he's decided you're not going to make it
[1:07:22] and you can't make it in you know God
[1:07:25] will never never tell you you're not
[1:07:26] going to make it in a Rapture that's the
[1:07:28] devil doing that amen there's nothing
[1:07:30] negative in
[1:07:32] Christianity amen so if there's a
[1:07:34] negative thought in your mind it's the
[1:07:37] devil that's putting that Amen in your
[1:07:40] mind it's your enemy that is talking to
[1:07:43] you can you say Amen it may not be an
[1:07:46] autal voice amen but it could just be
[1:07:49] negative thoughts well I'm just not good
[1:07:51] enough I'm just not worthy I I I just
[1:07:54] don't know if I can make that is your
[1:07:57] enemy that is talking to you trying to
[1:08:00] wear you down can you say amen amen see
[1:08:04] so we've got an enemy and it's not God
[1:08:08] it it's not your pastor it's not your
[1:08:10] brothers and sisters it's just simply
[1:08:12] there is an enemy amen and and he's
[1:08:15] after you amen simply because there is a
[1:08:19] plan amen God's got a plan and a purpose
[1:08:24] for your life
[1:08:26] amen now so so what is it why why what
[1:08:30] what what is all this Warfare amen
[1:08:32] what's all this uh uh uh seems
[1:08:35] resistance everywhere why why can't we
[1:08:37] just find the peace why why can't we
[1:08:40] just just you know just have a picnic
[1:08:42] every once in a while what is it well
[1:08:44] the prophet just explains what it is
[1:08:46] it's the darkness Gathering itself Amen
[1:08:50] to try to keep the light from coming can
[1:08:53] you say Amen now you think of that now
[1:08:55] now it's the darkness the darkness knows
[1:08:58] that God is wrapping this thing up he's
[1:09:00] got one last chance Satan's got one last
[1:09:03] chance so he FTS amen he couldn't ruin
[1:09:06] that plan at Calvary he couldn't ruin
[1:09:08] that plan in the Old Testament he
[1:09:10] couldn't ruin it with the new church uh
[1:09:12] amen he's tried he's tried to take the
[1:09:14] joy he's tried to take the peace uh he
[1:09:17] has stripped that church uh that here
[1:09:19] now is a bride that is starting to rise
[1:09:22] up and Satan's doing everything in his
[1:09:26] power to withstand this thing Amen to
[1:09:29] defeat you oh yes sir amen it is amen so
[1:09:35] what is it that you're warning against
[1:09:37] it's the power of Darkness can you say
[1:09:41] Amen it's the power amen then so if the
[1:09:45] devil is fighting against us then we
[1:09:48] must not underestimate
[1:09:51] ourselves amen don't underestimate your
[1:09:54] enemy but don't underestimate yourself
[1:09:57] amen because then there must be
[1:09:59] something valuable that God sees in you
[1:10:03] amen if Satan is attacking you then
[1:10:05] there's something that Satan is after
[1:10:08] amen if if if if he is doing all he can
[1:10:11] young people to destroy your life then
[1:10:14] that means that God's got a plan and
[1:10:18] Satan is after that Jewel Satan's after
[1:10:21] that word Satan's after that promise
[1:10:24] Satan's after everything to keep you
[1:10:27] from coming to what God has ordained for
[1:10:33] you now why would the enemy try to keep
[1:10:36] the light amen the darkness the enemy
[1:10:40] trying to keep the light from coming
[1:10:43] because light holds the power of life
[1:10:47] amen light can you say Amen but not only
[1:10:50] does it holds the power of life it is
[1:10:53] also proof that God's word is effective
[1:10:58] a oh do you believe that amen it's one
[1:11:00] thing for God to say something amen but
[1:11:03] when when when when that something amen
[1:11:07] manifest itself then it's greater than
[1:11:10] just God speaking it amen because now
[1:11:14] the word that God spoke is now made
[1:11:17] manifest a ain't that right amen see
[1:11:20] amen so if you if you remember you know
[1:11:23] in the in the beginning uh uh
[1:11:25] there were seeds laying in the earth
[1:11:28] there there were seeds ain't that right
[1:11:30] and they just laid dormant in the Earth
[1:11:33] because Darkness covered the Earth amen
[1:11:36] the water depth of water covered the
[1:11:38] Earth amen and now we can we can look
[1:11:41] back now and see why they laid dormant
[1:11:44] we don't know how long they were there
[1:11:46] Amen in the Earth but God had put them
[1:11:49] in the earth and they lay dormant in
[1:11:51] that Earth and there's a reason why they
[1:11:53] lay dormant because there was no light
[1:11:56] amen there was no power of life amen to
[1:12:00] to Quicken that seed God needed a light
[1:12:04] Amen to shine to Quicken the seed ain't
[1:12:08] that right amen yes sir amen see nothing
[1:12:13] the prophet said nothing can live
[1:12:14] without light nothing whether it's
[1:12:17] physically or or naturally or
[1:12:19] spiritually a ain't that right so then
[1:12:22] if there's no light then God's purpose
[1:12:24] for planting the seed in the Earth would
[1:12:27] not be made known if there hadn't been
[1:12:30] light ain't that right well you know
[1:12:32] brother brandom tells us that we're part
[1:12:34] of the earth amen you you are part of
[1:12:37] the earth ain't that right amen and as
[1:12:39] God planted a natural seed in the earth
[1:12:42] God also planted a word seed inside of
[1:12:46] you yes sir amen and it had been lay
[1:12:49] Dorth there amen and it just needed a
[1:12:52] light to come across that seed and to
[1:12:56] Quicken that seed to bring it to
[1:13:01] manifestation so therefore God said let
[1:13:04] there be
[1:13:05] light and there was light amen and the
[1:13:10] natural light appeared and brought all
[1:13:12] the natural seed to life do you believe
[1:13:15] that so in the message of turning on the
[1:13:18] light brother Ram talks about light and
[1:13:21] how that light is a manifest the word of
[1:13:26] God made manifest when you look in that
[1:13:28] light it's the word of God made manifest
[1:13:32] ain't that right oh my amen so we're
[1:13:35] talking about spiritual light amen
[1:13:37] natural light but spiritual light is
[1:13:39] what I'm speaking of tonight amen and so
[1:13:42] therefore spiritual darkness is trying
[1:13:45] to keep that spiritual light amen from
[1:13:48] from coming forth he's trying to keep
[1:13:51] the word of God that spiritual light or
[1:13:54] uh uh the seed
[1:13:55] amen from uh uh uh being manifested now
[1:14:00] the prophet tell tells us we know it
[1:14:02] amen what is a word it's a thought
[1:14:06] expressed amen so a word has an origin
[1:14:10] and it's the thought the thought is the
[1:14:13] origin the thought exists first before
[1:14:16] the word can you say Amen so the seed of
[1:14:19] God Amen it began as a thought of God
[1:14:22] Amen and brother brandom said they are
[1:14:24] Premed itated thoughts so this isn't
[1:14:27] just thoughts that just pass through
[1:14:28] God's mind you you you all know how we
[1:14:31] get them thoughts Satan can put thoughts
[1:14:34] in our minds and we get little thoughts
[1:14:35] and then we say well why would I think
[1:14:37] that you know and why do this and why
[1:14:40] you know but but with God Amen Satan
[1:14:42] couldn't put a thought contrary Amen to
[1:14:45] God's nature and God's ability and God's
[1:14:48] purpose and and God's desire amen the
[1:14:51] thoughts that God had amen come from him
[1:14:54] they're holy holy thoughts they're
[1:14:55] righteous thoughts they they are pure
[1:14:58] thoughts they're they're powerful
[1:15:00] thoughts and they're premeditated
[1:15:03] thoughts in other words he dwelt upon
[1:15:06] them by these thoughts he formulated a
[1:15:10] plan can you say amen and so therefore
[1:15:14] it makes us an attribute of God's
[1:15:18] thinking that's how you exist it it
[1:15:21] you're an attribute of God's thinking
[1:15:24] ain't that right
[1:15:25] see and so that's what God planted
[1:15:28] inside of you was a word seed amen that
[1:15:31] that was a thought premeditated thought
[1:15:34] of his and so therefore before that word
[1:15:37] jeene seed could come up in us God had
[1:15:42] to bring forth light can you say amen
[1:15:47] amen and it also had to come forth by
[1:15:51] the spoken word of God as the naturalite
[1:15:54] did
[1:15:55] now let's just look at it Jesus amen was
[1:15:59] an attribute of God's thinking how many
[1:16:01] believes that he was an attribute of
[1:16:03] God's thinking in God's mind he was the
[1:16:06] lamb that was slain before the
[1:16:08] foundation of the world Amen before the
[1:16:11] beginning of time God thought of himself
[1:16:14] becoming tangible amen and and dwelling
[1:16:18] among men so therefore the body of Jesus
[1:16:21] Christ was predestinated for that very
[1:16:27] purpose do you believe that amen Jesus
[1:16:30] was God in flesh amen see and so
[1:16:34] therefore Jesus was a premeditated
[1:16:37] thought of God brother Braham said Jesus
[1:16:40] was slain before the world even had the
[1:16:42] first Speck of dirt laid Jesus was
[1:16:46] already slayed he said why here it is
[1:16:49] get it God by for knowledge when he was
[1:16:52] the word in the beginning perceived the
[1:16:55] thought now it's just the thought then
[1:16:57] when he spoke it and said it shall be
[1:17:01] then Jesus was slain the very minute God
[1:17:04] spoke the
[1:17:06] word can you say amen and I just may I
[1:17:09] just said you were saved the very minute
[1:17:13] God spoke the word you were delivered
[1:17:16] the very moment God spoke the word you
[1:17:20] were Justified the very moment God spoke
[1:17:23] the word you were glorified the very
[1:17:27] moment that God spoke the
[1:17:31] word it's all
[1:17:33] premeditated do you believe that and so
[1:17:36] Jesus amen was the lamb slain the very
[1:17:40] moment that God spoke the word and said
[1:17:42] it shall be see he perceived the thought
[1:17:46] now it's just the thought see amen then
[1:17:49] he says then what 4,000 years later
[1:17:53] 4,000 years later
[1:17:55] he came see and paid the price that God
[1:17:59] had already done back here by his word
[1:18:03] he had to come everybody say Jesus had
[1:18:06] to come Jesus to do you believe that
[1:18:10] Jesus had to come and so do you have to
[1:18:15] come and all devils in Hell couldn't
[1:18:19] keep him from
[1:18:20] coming God had already spoke it come on
[1:18:26] can you say amen amen see well then how
[1:18:29] do you know that all devils in Hell
[1:18:32] couldn't keep him from coming because
[1:18:34] they tried it all down Through the Ages
[1:18:38] Satan had been trying to keep that word
[1:18:40] of God from prevailing he had been
[1:18:43] trying to keep that light from coming
[1:18:48] forth yes sir they tried it you see he
[1:18:52] was predestinated to be the sacrifice he
[1:18:55] was predestinated to be the prophet he
[1:18:57] was predestinated to be the priest and
[1:19:00] to be the king what Joseph was Christ
[1:19:03] was predestinated to be what David was
[1:19:06] Christ was predestinated to be amen what
[1:19:10] he what abble was uh Christ was
[1:19:13] predestinated to be what Moses was uh
[1:19:16] Christ was
[1:19:18] predestinated to
[1:19:20] be see he was the word that came to them
[1:19:24] and their lives reflected what he was
[1:19:27] predestinated to
[1:19:30] be can you say amen that's why Prophet
[1:19:33] said it was Christ in Moses it was
[1:19:35] Christ in David it it was he was
[1:19:37] reflecting of what he would be when he
[1:19:40] come in that body of
[1:19:46] Flesh God was always showing that the
[1:19:48] word had come God was already showing
[1:19:51] that it was established through all the
[1:19:54] prophecy through all the saints of old
[1:19:56] he was only reflecting of what was
[1:19:58] already going to come he knew it was
[1:20:00] going to come and he testified through
[1:20:02] them that it was coming and so he as he
[1:20:05] testified through Ruth that you were
[1:20:08] coming can you say amen he testified
[1:20:11] amen through through uh Rahab the Harlot
[1:20:14] that you were coming he testified amen
[1:20:18] through the Saints of old that you were
[1:20:21] coming
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:24] yes
[1:20:25] [Applause]
[1:20:26] sir see what you were predestinated to
[1:20:29] be they spoke
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:32] of it's true and then the word everybody
[1:20:37] say the word word became
[1:20:40] flesh the word became manifested in
[1:20:44] flesh can you say Amen the word of God
[1:20:48] Amen just as that sun outside amen when
[1:20:51] you see the sun tomorrow shining that is
[1:20:54] the word of God God made manifest uh
[1:20:56] well Jesus became flesh uh the word that
[1:21:00] was spoken of him became
[1:21:03] flesh
[1:21:04] manifested
[1:21:07] hallu you see Jesus was not the second
[1:21:10] person in the godhead he was the person
[1:21:15] and the only person in the godhead can
[1:21:18] you say Amen all that God thought of
[1:21:22] himself becoming he became in Jesus
[1:21:27] Christ God thought of himself as a
[1:21:29] redeemer God thought of himself as a
[1:21:32] Healer God thought of himself as a way
[1:21:34] maker God thought of himself as king God
[1:21:38] thought of himself as a husband all of
[1:21:41] it became in
[1:21:43] [Music]
[1:21:46] Christ so in the Old Testament yeah God
[1:21:49] wasn't speaking of another person to
[1:21:52] come come on come on
[1:21:55] he was speaking of
[1:21:57] himself becoming
[1:21:59] [Music]
[1:21:59] [Applause]
[1:22:02] flesh ain't that right yes sir and so we
[1:22:06] know that Jesus Christ was the expressed
[1:22:09] image of God he was the visible image of
[1:22:13] the invisible God he said in Hebrew John
[1:22:17] 14:9 he that has seen me has seen the
[1:22:20] father he also said in John 657 I live
[1:22:26] by the father ain't that right the
[1:22:29] prophet said how did he live by the
[1:22:31] Father the father was in him he was just
[1:22:35] the Tabernacle of
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:37] [Applause]
[1:22:40] godl Amen so therefore he was so full of
[1:22:44] quickening power and that quickening
[1:22:47] power quickened the
[1:22:49] word making him the living Worden
[1:22:55] the word that was written now become
[1:22:58] living in the body of Flesh ain't that
[1:23:03] right the word became flesh the word
[1:23:06] manifested in flesh so this is why in
[1:23:09] John 812 Jesus said I am the light of
[1:23:14] the world ain't that right because he
[1:23:18] was the manifested word of God Amen he
[1:23:21] was that light amen the light see John
[1:23:24] 1:14 the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:23:28] Among Us so the full word was manifested
[1:23:33] in
[1:23:35] him he wasn't a type and a
[1:23:38] shadow on he was the Fulfillment of the
[1:23:42] type and
[1:23:44] Shadow he was the
[1:23:47] light ain't that right Jesus said of
[1:23:50] himself that he was true he said I am
[1:23:53] the true bread I am the True Vine see I
[1:23:57] I I I am these things I'm the true amen
[1:24:00] see the Mana that fell from heaven in
[1:24:02] the Old Testament that was just a type
[1:24:05] God again showing what Jesus would
[1:24:08] be Amen brother Bram said see that bread
[1:24:11] in the Old Testament it did not satisfy
[1:24:13] it was only good for a day those who ate
[1:24:16] it were hungry again the next day if it
[1:24:18] was left around it become contaminated
[1:24:21] but if any man eats of that true bread
[1:24:24] that came from Heaven he'll never hunger
[1:24:26] again that's exactly what God was
[1:24:29] [Music]
[1:24:31] after he does not need to come back and
[1:24:33] eat again the moment he partook he had
[1:24:36] eternal life here indeed was reality no
[1:24:41] no need any longer for a shatter no need
[1:24:44] for partial sh salvation here is the
[1:24:47] whole of it can you say amen amen in the
[1:24:53] revelation of Jesus Christ Christ he is
[1:24:55] revealed as he that is true amen and and
[1:24:59] brother B says in other words he is the
[1:25:02] perfect
[1:25:03] realization not partial he's perfect
[1:25:06] realization of every type and Shadow
[1:25:09] that spoke of him ain't that right amen
[1:25:12] so 1 John 2 and8 it says because the
[1:25:15] darkness is passed the True Light now
[1:25:21] shineth the True Light can you sayen now
[1:25:25] brother brandom says this he says no one
[1:25:27] could deny that Israel had light they
[1:25:30] were the only people who had light as a
[1:25:32] nation it was as when Egypt was so dark
[1:25:35] that one could feel it but in the homes
[1:25:38] of the Israelites there was light but
[1:25:41] now True Light everybody say True Light
[1:25:45] True Light is come see the light of the
[1:25:48] world is Jesus Moses and the prophets
[1:25:51] brought the light amen by means of the
[1:25:54] scripture relative Amen to the Messiah
[1:25:58] thus Israel had light but now the
[1:26:00] Fulfillment of the light had come see

[1:26:10] manifested among his
[1:26:14] people what was a glowing word is now a
[1:26:18] light
[1:26:21] shining the brightness of God amen he
[1:26:24] says now as the pillar of fire gave
[1:26:26] light at night and he says and that was
[1:26:29] wonderful wonderful to have a pillar
[1:26:32] fire amen a light by night see now light
[1:26:37] and life were manifested in the fullness
[1:26:41] of the godhead
[1:26:44] bodily in the body of Jesus Christ and
[1:26:47] the Darkness the darkness gathered
[1:26:51] itself together to keep that light
[1:26:54] from shining to keep that light to take
[1:26:58] out that light to put out that
[1:27:02] light can you say Amen but Jesus was not
[1:27:05] standing in his own power he was
[1:27:08] standing by the power of the spoken
[1:27:12] word and you're not standing by your own
[1:27:15] power you're not standing by your own

[1:28:45] Jesus and Satan thought he had finally
[1:28:48] succeeded in putting the light out he
[1:28:51] was placed in the Tomb never to be heard
[1:28:53] of again in brother Bri said the world
[1:28:56] put him in a tomb and sealed him up in
[1:29:00] that tomb with a Roman seal ain't that
[1:29:03] right and they sealed him in that tomb
[1:29:07] to make him just a historical
[1:29:11] figure don't mind you talking about him
[1:29:14] as long as he's not alive don't mind you
[1:29:16] singing about him as long as he's not
[1:29:18] affected to
[1:29:20] you can you say Amen as long as the
[1:29:23] light shining there's a predestinated
[1:29:26] seat that's going to come up we got to
[1:29:27] put that
[1:29:31] out so they wanted to make him a
[1:29:33] historical figure a God that used to
[1:29:35] heal a God that used to save a God that
[1:29:39] that that just leaves his people with
[1:29:41] Habits and Hangups and and and just
[1:29:44] barely making along and and oh yeah they
[1:29:47] talk about him they sing about him but
[1:29:49] they really don't know the power of him
[1:29:51] that's exactly what the enemy wanted to
[1:29:52] do
[1:29:55] [Applause]
[1:29:56] brother BR said they thought they got
[1:29:57] rid of him just like Cain thought he got
[1:29:59] rid of
[1:30:00] Abel but you see the man the purpose of
[1:30:04] him being manifested in the first place
[1:30:06] was to destroy the works of the
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:10] devil hello he allowed the devil to kill
[1:30:14] him to show that he can destroy the
[1:30:17] power of
[1:30:22] death that's good ain't that right so
[1:30:26] here he was sealed up in the Tomb but on
[1:30:28] Resurrection
[1:30:31] morning you all know it in the Easter in
[1:30:34] the rising of the sun brother BR said on
[1:30:37] that Easter morning there was a duel
[1:30:39] Sunrise not only the natural son Rose
[1:30:42] but the Son of God Rose both of them was
[1:30:45] the spoken word of God and death
[1:30:48] couldn't stop it time couldn't stop it
[1:30:50] trial couldn't stop it the darkness no
[1:30:53] matter how how dark the night was it
[1:30:56] could not stop it he was Rising by the
[1:30:59] spoken
[1:31:00] [Music]
[1:31:02] word can you say Amen yes sir brother BR
[1:31:06] said they thought they they could
[1:31:08] destroy it by by uh uh they thought they
[1:31:11] could destroy it made flesh by placing
[1:31:15] him in a tomb driving a spear through
[1:31:17] his heart but watch the spirit of God
[1:31:22] making a way by an Angel rolling the
[1:31:25] stone
[1:31:27] away rolling the stone away I want to
[1:31:31] just tell you right now you know the
[1:31:33] prophet said the angel of the Lord
[1:31:35] accompanies this
[1:31:36] [Music]
[1:31:37] message amen God Amen would show his
[1:31:41] word effective by sending an angel amen
[1:31:44] something that them women could not do
[1:31:47] something that was impossible to do amen
[1:31:50] that God by by his word would send a
[1:31:53] super natural Angel to roll the stone
[1:31:56] away and that angel is
[1:32:00] here that angel is here can you say Amen
[1:32:04] because there's some other seed that's
[1:32:06] got to
[1:32:10] rise so all the all the darkness had
[1:32:13] gathered to kill out the light but you
[1:32:15] know what the prophet said light is 10
[1:32:17] million times stronger than Darkness
[1:32:20] don't you sit in your Molly grubs as
[1:32:21] though the devil's got an upper hand on
[1:32:23] you you are a child of light and light

[1:38:47] up in the hog pin and he's there eating
[1:38:50] the slop and the mud and and he's stinks

[1:39:33] was a son he says I would just go tell
[1:39:36] him I will be a servant I I'll just be

[1:39:43] servant I know I'm just no good I'm I'm
[1:39:46] I'm nothing I'm not even worthy to be
[1:39:47] called your son and and and these things

[1:40:07] treated as a servant I I'll be whatever
[1:40:10] see amen and and yet the
[1:40:13] Father the father had been waiting all
[1:40:16] this time looking for his
[1:40:19] [Applause]
[1:40:21] return father through ages ages looking
[1:40:24] for his
[1:40:25] [Applause]
[1:40:29] return and when he saw something
[1:40:31] glimpsing over the hill that little old
[1:40:33] frail weak
[1:40:37] figure maybe he got his his binoculars
[1:40:40] out the most expensive
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:43] binoculars he didn't see a servant he
[1:40:46] saw a
[1:40:52] son and the Bible says he
[1:40:55] ran I'd like to say he ran with an open
[1:41:02] book to meet him Hallelujah ain't no
[1:41:06] mystery to the father now he's going to
[1:41:08] open it up to the
[1:41:10] son and here the son is saying oh oh I'm
[1:41:13] just unworthy I'm just no good and I'm
[1:41:15] just this and I'm just that but he could

[1:41:20] the father said oh my son has returned
[1:41:22] oh no just the servant I'm just and no
[1:41:25] doubt maybe the father had to slap him a
[1:41:27] little bit and Shake him a little bit

[1:41:47] him come on church amen the son didn't
[1:41:50] feel like a a son he felt like a servant
[1:41:53] but if the father said he was a son then
[1:41:56] he would act like a son he would live
[1:41:58] like a son he would be a son because the
[1:42:01] father said

[1:42:36] what the father says about you live by
[1:42:38] what the word of the father says can you
[1:42:40] say Amen there's a whole Bible full of
[1:42:43] promises that the father says you will
[1:42:45] make it the father says you are
[1:42:47] victorious the father says you're mine
[1:42:53] can you give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:43:04] Praise if we are the light then that
[1:43:07] means we are the manifested word yes sir
[1:43:11] you believe
[1:43:12] that and the only way for that to happen
[1:43:15] is for the quickening power to come to
[1:43:19] us this is why the prophet said all that
[1:43:22] God was he poured it into Christ and all
[1:43:24] that Christ what is he poured into the
[1:43:27] church this why Paul would tell us the
[1:43:29] mystery is Christ in you the hope of
[1:43:34] glory now notice and I'm going to hurry
[1:43:37] up now but Romans 811 if the spirit of
[1:43:41] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:43:43] dwell in
[1:43:45] you not another person third person in
[1:43:48] the
[1:43:49] godhead not a fifth person in the
[1:43:51] godhead but the same person that dwelt
[1:43:54] in that body of Jesus Christ if he dwell
[1:43:57] in you that God that quickened that body
[1:44:01] will Quicken your mortal
[1:44:04] [Applause]
[1:44:05] bodyall do you believe it now
[1:44:09] notice Jesus told us that there would
[1:44:13] come a day where that scripture would be
[1:44:14] made known to us if the spirit of him
[1:44:18] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:44:21] dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal
[1:44:24] body in other words see it would be made
[1:44:28] known there would be a day where that
[1:44:31] him dwelling in us would be made known
[1:44:35] right see the full reality of him living
[1:44:38] in US John 14:18 this is where Jesus
[1:44:43] prophesies I will not leave you
[1:44:44] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[1:44:47] little while the world seeth me no more
[1:44:49] but you see me because I live you shall
[1:44:51] live also at that day everybody say at
[1:44:56] that day you know what a prophet said
[1:44:59] this
[1:45:01] day can you say Amen what was it he came
[1:45:05] to us in quickening power in this
[1:45:11] day and at that day you shall know that
[1:45:15] I'm in my father you in me and I in you
[1:45:20] how we going to know that word Jean seed
[1:45:22] is quick
[1:45:24] [Applause]
[1:45:27] it would be a day when every promise
[1:45:31] that was given to the church would be
[1:45:33] quickened in us bringing the full word
[1:45:36] everybody say the full word to
[1:45:40] manifestation hello the spirit of him
[1:45:43] that was in Christ Jesus dwelling in you
[1:45:46] shall Quicken your mortal
[1:45:49] body brother Braham said just as your
[1:45:51] body is dead without the spirit so is
[1:45:53] the spir word of God dead without the
[1:45:56] Holy Ghost to Quicken it so the spirit
[1:45:58] quickens the body and the Holy Ghost
[1:46:01] quickens the word of God in other words
[1:46:04] Quicken means to bring to life make
[1:46:09] live it isn't just to give you
[1:46:12] Goosebumps it's to Quicken that Jean
[1:46:15] seed what God thought you to be before
[1:46:18] the foundation of the world he come to
[1:46:20] Quicken that
[1:46:21] seed you're not a
[1:46:25] beggar you're not just a
[1:46:28] nobody you're not just somebody that
[1:46:30] Satan can toy around with and play
[1:46:33] around with and ravish you and Destroy
[1:46:41] youl then you say
[1:46:45] Amen if you remember the
[1:46:48] seed that got planted on the day of
[1:46:50] Pentecost went into the ground at NAA
[1:46:53] the Dark Ages but God promised to
[1:46:55] restore the seed and to bring it into
[1:46:58] maturity do you believe that and
[1:47:01] according to Ezekiel the prophet there
[1:47:05] Ezekiel there would be four stages to
[1:47:07] this
[1:47:07] restoration amen but the full and
[1:47:10] complete restoration would be in the
[1:47:13] fourth stage which is the revealing of
[1:47:16] the son of
[1:47:19] man not another person but the same
[1:47:23] person not another Jesus but the same
[1:47:27] Jesus not another power but the same
[1:47:30] power not another life but the same
[1:47:34] life can you say amen that's right see
[1:47:38] amen and so therefore Hebrews 138 which
[1:47:42] was brother bram's theme scripture amen
[1:47:44] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:47:47] and
[1:47:51] forever Luther's age did not bring the
[1:47:53] full
[1:47:54] restoration Wesley's age or the
[1:47:57] Pentecostal age did not bring it it
[1:47:59] would take the fourth stage to bring
[1:48:04] life Hallelujah brother R said the
[1:48:06] fourth stage is the fourth light which
[1:48:09] is the word
[1:48:13] itself the word made flesh everybody say
[1:48:16] the word made
[1:48:17] flesh it's the message of
[1:48:20] Life can you say Amen
[1:48:23] see in Ezekiel 37 7-10 the first stage
[1:48:26] the bones come together bone to his bone
[1:48:29] the second stage the sinu and and and
[1:48:32] the flesh Came Upon them the third stage
[1:48:35] the skin covered them and the fourth
[1:48:37] stage the breath came into them and they
[1:48:41] lived and stood up to their feet an
[1:48:44] exceeding great
[1:48:46] Army so brother Bram said see the fourth
[1:48:49] was the word itself the word made
[1:48:53] flesh yes sir you're not just a
[1:48:57] tight you're not just a
[1:48:59] shatter you're not just speaking of
[1:49:01] something to come you are that something
[1:49:04] to
[1:49:05] come it stops with you everything that
[1:49:09] Ruth Tau lived for and and lived about
[1:49:12] and testified of and and uh you know uh
[1:49:17] all of these others down through the
[1:49:18] Bible amen do you know there's more
[1:49:20] scripture that speaks of this day than
[1:49:22] there was the first time first coming of
[1:49:24] Jesus
[1:49:28] Christ can you say Amen see the word
[1:49:31] made flesh fruits of the proof of the
[1:49:34] Resurrection sign that Christ has
[1:49:37] finally after justification been planted
[1:49:39] set sanctification been planted the
[1:49:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost organ have
[1:49:45] died out and Christ has again centered
[1:49:48] himself like that cap of the pyramid
[1:49:51] first line just ification sanctification
[1:49:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the
[1:49:56] coming of the cap what is it that Holy
[1:50:00] Ghost Bunch being honed so that it can
[1:50:03] fit with the same kind of ministry that
[1:50:07] he had when he went away
[1:50:11] Hallelujah can you say
[1:50:13] [Applause]
[1:50:16] amen and all the powers of
[1:50:20] Darkness have gathered in this age
[1:50:25] the lid of hell has been
[1:50:27] lifted demonic powers are pouring in
[1:50:30] from everywhere the prophet
[1:50:32] said why to keep the light from coming
[1:50:42] forth young people you're part of this
[1:50:45] Rapture you're part of every promise
[1:50:47] that God promised
[1:50:52] understand that parents teach your
[1:50:55] children that they're part of the
[1:50:57] promise it's up to us ministers to wave
[1:51:00] the promises over the people keep waving
[1:51:03] them over the people don't look at their
[1:51:06] faults don't look at their failure look
[1:51:08] at the word of God and keep waving it
[1:51:11] over the people amen somebody's going to
[1:51:14] come to
[1:51:17] life I know it may be
[1:51:20] discouraging amen but there is light
[1:51:23] that is shining to Quicken the seed to
[1:51:26] bring life
[1:51:29] up keep waving the promises can you say
[1:51:33] amen he said see with this that can fit
[1:51:37] with the same kind of ministry that he
[1:51:39] had when he went away see that when he
[1:51:42] comes back it'll catch the whole thing
[1:51:44] in the Rapture where the Justified
[1:51:46] Sanctified in the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:47] Ghost that pyramid will stand again the
[1:51:52] House of God will live again and I say
[1:51:57] she's
[1:52:00] living this house of God is standing on
[1:52:04] her
[1:52:07] feet
[1:52:08] Hallelujah you believe
[1:52:10] it now the fourth stage could not happen
[1:52:13] if the first three stages did not come
[1:52:15] that's right see the life that was in
[1:52:18] the stock and in the tassel and in the
[1:52:21] husk all Gathers in the
[1:52:25] seed and the life that was in the stock
[1:52:27] went one to make the other justification
[1:52:30] made way for sanctification
[1:52:31] sanctification made way for the baptism
[1:52:33] of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the
[1:52:35] Holy Ghost made it way for the Holy
[1:52:37] Ghost itself to come right down into
[1:52:41] Perfection back to the word again to
[1:52:44] manifest itself not manifest a Creed not
[1:52:48] manifest a Dogma all them other Ages
[1:52:51] were mixed in with breeds and Satan's
[1:52:53] lies and all of these but not this bride
[1:52:57] this is the word manifested again you
[1:53:01] are not a husk you are the word

[1:53:20] mind to where you quit living what the
[1:53:23] father says about you and you start
[1:53:25] acting like a servant you start acting

[1:53:31] not a
[1:53:33] sinner come on church if you've been
[1:53:36] filled with the Holy Ghost you cannot be
[1:53:38] a sinner

[1:53:55] right well that's what he
[1:53:58] said can't even

[1:57:53] shining through on that predestinated
[1:57:56] word now notice and at the opening of
[1:57:59] the seals another quote that at
[1:58:02] Revelations 10 the full word everybody
[1:58:04] say the full word is to be born into
[1:58:08] manifestation
[1:58:09] again and Vindicated by the spirit of
[1:58:12] God in the full strength as it was when
[1:58:16] he was here on the earth manifested in
[1:58:20] the same way doing the same things that
[1:58:22] it did when it was here on Earth Hebrews
[1:58:25] 13:8 can you say Amen Jesus Christ the
[1:58:28] same yesterday today and forever so what
[1:58:30] is it it's the revealing of the son of
[1:58:32] man and the Darkness has
[1:58:37] gathered can you say Amen now the
[1:58:40] prophet told us the evening light is not
[1:58:42] any different than the morning light
[1:58:45] right it's the same light same
[1:58:50] Ministry same power
[1:58:55] same Authority brother R said he's the
[1:58:57] same in every detail except the the
[1:59:00] Corporal body that's right I'm going to
[1:59:03] close with this it's not the son of
[1:59:07] man in his physical
[1:59:11] body son of man not revealed in his
[1:59:15] physical body of 2,000 years
[1:59:20] ago but it's God revealed in a redeemed
[1:59:25] Body by manifesting his promised
[1:59:30] word yes sir now I made that statement
[1:59:34] you know the other day and a young man
[1:59:38] he was a little confused by it
[1:59:40] and he said you know what now I heard
[1:59:42] you say redeem body and he he said I'm
[1:59:45] sure you know I heard wrong or you uh or
[1:59:49] or you meant to say something different
[1:59:51] I said no sir I I I said right redeemed
[1:59:55] body he said but I said well I I know
[1:59:58] where you're thinking you're you know
[2:00:00] you're you're looking at redeemed body
[2:00:01] is when we're all changed and it's
[2:00:04] changed from corruption to incorruption
[2:00:05] and Mortal to immortality and and and
[2:00:08] all these things and yes that's that's
[2:00:10] the Final Redemption of the
[2:00:12] body can you say Amen but brother
[2:00:16] brandom said our soul our body and
[2:00:19] everything that we lost in the fall was
[2:00:21] redeemed
[2:00:23] when a public inside was raised at
[2:00:28] Calvary listen
[2:00:31] now when God wanted to appear before
[2:00:35] Abraham he didn't want to come as a
[2:00:38] spirit he needed a
[2:00:40] body but there was no body on the earth
[2:00:42] for him to come to so he had to speak
[2:00:46] one sir he took some dust blew now
[2:00:51] that's what a prophet said that's right
[2:00:54] and he he he done three bodies one for
[2:00:57] this Angel one for that angel and then
[2:00:59] he made himself one and there he
[2:01:02] appeared as a man
[2:01:05] human
[2:01:06] eating a calf drinking
[2:01:12] milk God made
[2:01:17] flesh can you say
[2:01:19] Amen so the prophet said he came came
[2:01:22] into that body in the person of MDC see
[2:01:25] now notice what he says he had to
[2:01:27] represent something he was going to be
[2:01:31] in the last
[2:01:34] days when he's looking to appear to
[2:01:37] Abraham he already had this day in his
[2:01:42] mind and he wanted to show then what he
[2:01:45] would be in this
[2:01:49] day so he comes right down down and
[2:01:52] talks in human
[2:01:57] flesh skip on further when it come time
[2:02:02] for him to come as a
[2:02:05] redeemer and a savior he needed the
[2:02:09] body he couldn't die as a
[2:02:13] spirit so he needed the body but there
[2:02:15] was no body that he could come
[2:02:18] to so there was a little Virgin by the
[2:02:21] name of Mary
[2:02:22] yeah that was just meditating upon the
[2:02:25] scriptures and it just happened she was
[2:02:27] meditating upon what Isaiah said For
[2:02:30] unto you a child shall be
[2:02:33] born his name Shall be Called
[2:02:37] Emmanuel and you know the story and and
[2:02:41] and God didn't have a body that he could
[2:02:44] come to so he created a blood
[2:02:48] cell in the womb of that
[2:02:53] virgin and that body began to
[2:02:57] grow inside
[2:02:59] her and God would look and say that's my
[2:03:03] body God waiting with
[2:03:07] anticipation to come down in that
[2:03:10] body can you say
[2:03:14] amen and in that body he redeemed Sons
[2:03:18] and Daughters of
[2:03:20] God can you say amen Church yes sir see
[2:03:24] so now in this day come on come on he
[2:03:29] needed to come down
[2:03:33] again for he promised that the son of
[2:03:36] man would be
[2:03:37] revealed and would show forth the same
[2:03:44] sign but he didn't have to create him a
[2:03:48] body he didn't have to get him a wound a
[2:03:51] virgin to borrow the womb to create his
[2:03:54] own
[2:03:55] body there was a body on Earth that he
[2:03:59] could come
[2:04:00] [Applause]
[2:04:04] to hello church we showed that Calvary
[2:04:10] worked everything that Christ did
[2:04:17] worked think of it now he didn't have to
[2:04:20] come into a word body he didn't have to
[2:04:23] come into a spoken word he could
[2:04:27] actually come into a sex born
[2:04:31] body and perform the same sign that he
[2:04:34] did in
[2:04:38] MDC now notice Revelations 1:5 says unto
[2:04:43] him that loved us this is the answer
[2:04:45] unto him that loved us and washed us
[2:04:48] from our sins in his his own
[2:04:53] blood can you say amen and brother Ram
[2:04:56] says that word watched is loosed he
[2:04:58] loosed us with his own
[2:05:02] [Music]
[2:05:04] blood brother Braham said if it is
[2:05:07] perfect blood that loosed us then it is
[2:05:09] a perfect
[2:05:12] loosening which means no sin held
[2:05:16] against
[2:05:17] you which means you are Justified
[2:05:21] [Applause]

[2:06:36] read it for just a moment the sheath
[2:06:38] wave brother brandham said see the
[2:06:40] waving of the sheath what was the sheath
[2:06:42] the first one that come to mature the
[2:06:44] first one that proved it was a
[2:06:45] wheat that proved it was a sheath ain't
[2:06:49] that right in the Old Testament the
[2:06:50] sheath was was the first of your seed
[2:06:53] that you planted when it comes up and
[2:06:56] ripened you cut down this sheath and
[2:06:58] take it to the priest and let him take
[2:07:00] it and wave it before the Lord for your
[2:07:03] acceptance showing that you are
[2:07:07] accepted notice and they waved that
[2:07:11] sheath for it was the first one to come
[2:07:14] to
[2:07:17] maturity and it was waved as a memorial
[2:07:20] of thanks to God
[2:07:22] believing that the rest of
[2:07:24] them would
[2:07:28] come and brother brah says and the
[2:07:31] waving of the sheath was not on a
[2:07:33] Sabbath day as the other
[2:07:35] feasts it was waved on the first day of
[2:07:39] the

[2:08:34] first time there will come forth a
