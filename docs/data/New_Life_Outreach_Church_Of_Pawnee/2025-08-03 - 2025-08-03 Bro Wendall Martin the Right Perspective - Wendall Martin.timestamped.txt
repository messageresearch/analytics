[43:57] saw seven golden candlesticks.
[44:00] And I'm just going to take that
[44:01] scripture today,
[44:03] and and I'm going to title it the right
[44:05] perspective. Let's go to the Lord in
[44:08] prayer. Father, we thank you for what we
[44:11] have felt here in our midst here today.
[44:14] We're so thankful for what you're doing
[44:17] in Shorty's life, Lord. And how that you
[44:20] have you have brought him back from his
[44:23] deathbed, Lord, and he's waiting on his
[44:26] family. And we just say, Lord, thank
[44:29] you. Thank you for hearing our prayer.
[44:33] And Lord, we're just believing that you
[44:35] are going to complete that prayer by
[44:38] drawing him close to you and giving him
[44:41] a a personal experience with you,
[44:43] Father. Oh God, we believe that you
[44:47] still save our souls that you can redeem
[44:50] us, Lord, Lord, from from death and
[44:54] Lord, you can redeem us from
[44:57] hell. you can redeem us, Lord, for may
[45:00] he be a great testimony to this
[45:03] community and all those that know him.
[45:05] Father, we thank you for it. Now, Lord,
[45:08] we just ask that you would be with us as
[45:10] we minister your word this morning and
[45:13] ask for your anointing to be upon us all
[45:16] in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus
[45:18] Christ. Can the church say amen?
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[45:24] seated. would like to also uh say that
[45:29] it's just been such a a blessing to see
[45:32] u our our sister April and her family
[45:35] make it back home. And uh Amen. Good to
[45:40] good to see uh them here this morning.
[45:43] And and we always miss we miss everyone
[45:46] when you're gone. You know, a small
[45:48] church uh you you notice when when
[45:50] people are gone. And so we are we're
[45:54] just excited uh to be a part of the
[45:57] family knowing that here before long
[45:58] we're going home and we'll never we'll
[46:01] never part. We'll we'll always uh be
[46:04] together. Uh and I I am looking forward
[46:07] to that day. I I want to minister here
[46:10] this morning as I read the scripture to
[46:13] you and I turned to see the Apostle John
[46:18] was looking in one direction
[46:21] but he heard a voice from behind him.
[46:25] Amen. And the Bible says he turned
[46:28] around to see the voice that was
[46:31] speaking to him.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; And I believe the right perspective in
[46:35] anything that we Amen. uh in our walk
[46:38] with God especially. Amen. Having the
[46:42] right perspective of God's word. I think
[46:44] the right perspective in in
[46:46] relationships, having the right
[46:47] perspective in Amen. being able to see
[46:50] things as they truly are. And I I I
[46:53] believe that God wants us in this day.
[46:56] He wants us to see things. Amen. The way
[47:00] that he sees things. Amen. And the only
[47:03] way that we're going to seem anything
[47:05] like Christ, amen, is to walk by faith.
[47:09] You can't walk with God according to
[47:12] sight or according to the way the mama
[47:15] taught us or daddy taught us or amen uh
[47:18] um or tradition. But but God wants to
[47:23] wants us to see him according to the
[47:26] supernatural
[47:28] uh element. Amen. Sunday school lessons
[47:31] are wonderful. Amen. Um, tradition is
[47:34] wonderful, but God wants a personal
[47:38] revelation, a personal walk with every
[47:41] one of us.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; And the prophet would say Jesus Christ
[47:44] is by faith. Not what you can
[47:47] scientifically prove. Not what you
[47:50] believe, but what you believe. I can't
[47:53] scientifically prove to you tonight in
[47:56] this building that there is a God, but
[47:58] yet I know he's here. But by my faith,
[48:02] my faith vindicates it. Abraham could
[48:05] not scientifically prove to you that he
[48:08] was going to have a baby to that woman.
[48:10] And her nearly a hundred years old, but
[48:13] his faith confirmed it.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Didn't need any scientific proof why the
[48:19] doctor would would say the the old man
[48:22] is crazy out here. He's going to have a
[48:25] baby by that woman. Him a hundred years
[48:28] old and her 90. But you see, God said
[48:31] so. So it don't take science. It takes
[48:35] faith to believe God's word, not
[48:39] science. Amen. He says, "God said so."
[48:43] That settles it. God said so. No matter
[48:46] how ridiculous it sounds, if God said
[48:48] so, it's all right. Amen. God makes it
[48:52] ridiculous. All faith is ridiculous to
[48:55] the unbeliever. But faith is only real
[48:58] to God and to the one who has it.
[49:03] Unbelief does not stop God. Someone
[49:05] shout hallelujah.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says it don't bother God's
[49:10] plans. It doesn't bother God's word. It
[49:13] doesn't hurt it. It don't ruin them. It
[49:16] only ruins the one in unbelief. It'll
[49:19] ruin the unbeliever but not God. So, I
[49:23] want today I want to have the right
[49:25] perspective. I want to be able to look
[49:28] at God's word and I and I want to say,
[49:30] God, I want your word to be real in my
[49:34] life today. If God wrote something in
[49:36] his Bible, he he wrote it for a reason.
[49:40] He got He has got some sons and
[49:42] daughters here on the earth that is
[49:44] going to look at his word, accept his
[49:48] word, and walk in the realities of that
[49:51] word. And remember, God is not a a a a
[49:55] human. He's not finite like you are,
[49:57] like I am. He has no tomorrows. He has
[50:01] no yesterdays. God lives in eternity.
[50:04] God knows what he wants done in your
[50:06] life. And his plan never changes.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the devil brings.
[50:12] It doesn't matter what circumstances
[50:15] say. What matters is is God knows what
[50:19] he wants in you and he's looking for
[50:22] someone to believe him in faith. Amen.
[50:25] Perception of of the thing that you're
[50:27] looking at. I I I think of Jesus that
[50:29] Amen. asked the man who had been healed
[50:32] if he could see and and Jesus had
[50:34] touched his eyes and he and he said, you
[50:37] know, Amen. I see men as trees. A and
[50:40] and and Jesus didn't look at him and
[50:42] say, "Well, amen. That's that that's
[50:45] better than what you had. You were blind
[50:46] before. Amen. No. Jesus touched him
[50:50] again. And the Bible says that he could
[50:53] see every man clearly. Amen. So, you
[50:56] know what that tells me is God's not
[50:58] wanting you to have a little bit of
[51:00] eyesight. God wants you to have divine
[51:04] revelation. He wants the the expectation
[51:07] of your heart to be everything like God
[51:11] has given in the promise. Amen. For our
[51:14] eternal destination is not altogether
[51:17] determined on what we see or what we
[51:21] hear, but it is determined upon what
[51:24] discernment we have of what we see and
[51:28] what we hear. Amen. The Apostle Paul to
[51:31] the to the Corinthian church, he Amen.
[51:34] He when he was talking to them about
[51:36] communion and getting on to them and and
[51:38] and and you know that Amen. there in in
[51:41] in the scripture there in uh 1
[51:43] Corinthians 11. Uh he was he he was
[51:46] really getting on to the church and and
[51:48] and and and what they were doing around
[51:51] the communion table. And you see he was
[51:54] not disputing communion. Amen. But he
[51:57] was their act was right. Amen. But their
[52:01] perspective, their discernment was
[52:03] wrong. He says you're not discerning the
[52:06] Lord's body. Amen. coming together and
[52:10] having communion is right, but the way
[52:12] that you are doing it is wrong. Can you
[52:15] say amen? So, they were coming in, but
[52:18] they were doing it half-heartedly. They
[52:20] were eating and drinking irreverently
[52:23] and Amen. but they were not discerning
[52:25] the Lord's body. So, God wants the right
[52:28] perspective coming from every one of us.
[52:31] Amen. So, today in our walk with God, I
[52:34] want you to look at your perspective
[52:36] here this morning. God, give me the
[52:38] perspective, the right perspective, the
[52:40] perspective of faith that'll believe
[52:43] your word over every other word. It'll
[52:47] believe your word over my opinion. It'll
[52:49] believe your word over anything else
[52:51] that would come my way. Well, can you
[52:53] say amen? Amen. Look there at a at
[52:56] Philip. Amen. As he asked the unic, you
[52:59] know, as as he came walking up to the
[53:01] unic and said, "Do do you know what you
[53:03] read?" and and and the unic looked at
[53:06] him and said, "H, how can Amen. I I I I
[53:09] know except someone shows me." Amen. As
[53:12] he was looking there at as he was led to
[53:14] a, you know, talking about Jesus being
[53:17] led as a sheep to the to the slaughter
[53:20] and as a lamb dumb before the shears and
[53:22] his humiliation. And he says, is he's
[53:25] talking about a a prophet or is he
[53:27] talking about himself? Is he talking
[53:29] about someone else? But then here comes
[53:32] this this great uh huh uh Philillip the
[53:35] amen who was actually a deacon and he
[53:38] and and and he be to expound on him.
[53:41] Amen. The law of Christ and and and the
[53:44] plan of redemption through Jesus Christ
[53:47] and and the Bible says his eyes become
[53:50] open his clear his understanding become
[53:54] clear and he was baptized in the name of
[53:56] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So there is
[53:59] a perspective that God is looking for
[54:02] here this morning. If you're going to be
[54:04] an overcomer, it's going to require the
[54:06] right perspective. Amen. If you're going
[54:08] to be healed of your sickness, it's
[54:11] going to require the right perspective.
[54:13] If if we're going to be anything that
[54:16] God has called us to be, then there's
[54:19] going to require somebody that is going
[54:22] to reach out in faith and believe the
[54:25] word of God. Amen. How many believes
[54:27] God's word is has made it very clear?
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's word. You never want to mix
[54:34] God's word with other things. You've got
[54:37] to be God's word and God's word alone.
[54:40] For by faith are we saved. Amen. What is
[54:45] faith? It is a personal revelation of
[54:49] Jesus Christ to you. And we accept by
[54:52] God's grace that divine revelation.
[54:55] Well, praise the Lord. Amen. I say this
[54:57] morning, it matters what you look at. I
[55:00] I I look there at I I think about the uh
[55:03] the Israelites as they had Amen. They
[55:06] had sinned against God. And Amen. Their
[55:08] faith hasn't wasn't wasn't anchored the
[55:11] way it should be. And Amen. they were
[55:13] they were faced with a great epidemic of
[55:16] doubt. And amen, literally thousands had
[55:19] been affected by it. And amen, they were
[55:22] being bitten by snakes. Amen. serpents
[55:24] had come in and amen because they were
[55:27] saying to God, amen to Moses, you just
[55:30] brought us out of Egypt here to die. And
[55:32] God is not able to keep us and to take
[55:35] us into the promised land. And the Bible
[55:37] says there were serpents, amen, fiery
[55:39] serpents coming in. And thousands and
[55:42] thousands and thousands were dying. And
[55:45] God told Moses, he says, "Quickly, Amen,
[55:49] make a a a brazen serpent." And and I
[55:52] want you to set it up there for for the
[55:54] people to look at. And as they look at
[55:57] that, they will live. And they had to
[56:00] take their eyes off of the fiery
[56:03] serpents. They had to take their eyes
[56:06] off of that which was causing them
[56:09] displeasure and death. And they had to
[56:12] get their eyes upon the atonement that
[56:16] God had given them. And if they looked
[56:19] at that serpent, the Bible says, amen,
[56:22] that they lived and the plague was
[56:25] stayed. Well, can you say amen? Amen.
[56:27] What was that brazen serpent? Well, it's
[56:30] Amen. It was it was it was a brass
[56:33] represents judgment. Amen. It
[56:35] represented Christ who was going to be
[56:38] lifted up as the death penalty for all
[56:41] mankind. And as Christ was lifted up and
[56:45] all of the sin of the world was put on
[56:48] Jesus and you can look at Jesus and you
[56:51] can live here this morning, you can look
[56:53] at Jesus and you can be healed this
[56:56] morning. You can look at Jesus and he
[56:58] will be the satisfactor of your life.
[57:01] Well, praise the name of the Lord. I I
[57:03] say it matters what you look at here
[57:07] this morning. Amen. If you're coming to
[57:09] church just just to come to church,
[57:12] Amen. I'm afraid you're looking at the
[57:14] wrong thing. Amen. If you're coming for
[57:16] the music, you're looking at the wrong
[57:18] thing. If you're coming for your
[57:20] favorite preacher, you're looking at the
[57:22] wrong thing. But if you ever get a view
[57:25] of Jesus Christ, it'll change your life.
[57:29] It'll change your world. It'll be to
[57:31] you, Amen. what God desires to be to
[57:34] you. You've got to look at the right
[57:37] thing. Can you say amen?
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen to the believer. It is God's word
[57:44] alone. Amen. Somebody say, "It's God's
[57:47] word
[57:48] &gt;&gt; or nothing."
[57:50] &gt;&gt; His word is very clear as to who he is.
[57:54] His word is very clear as to what Christ
[57:57] has come to provide. His word is very
[58:01] clear as to what he expects from you.
[58:04] And you can't mix dogma and creed with
[58:06] it. Amen. You can't serve Jesus and
[58:09] mammon. You can't serve Jesus and the
[58:12] world. You can't walk. Amen. If the
[58:15] Bible says, "How can two walk together
[58:17] except they agree?" Amen. You have got
[58:20] to turn your eyes to Jesus Christ and
[58:24] away from the things of the world. Amen.
[58:27] Now, I know today there's a lot of
[58:29] mixing. Amen. There's a lot of mixing
[58:32] together. Amen. Well, I'm a Christian,
[58:34] but I'm also Amen. going to h I've got
[58:38] my own way of living. I want to tell
[58:40] you, there's only one way, friend, and
[58:42] that's the Bible way. Amen. That's the
[58:45] only way is the Bible way. Well, you
[58:47] say, "But I believe in Jesus. Jesus came
[58:50] the Bible way." Amen. Well, I I I don't
[58:53] know about this, and I Well, I love
[58:55] Jesus with all of my heart.
[58:57] Amen. But you know, I've got my own
[58:59] opinions, too. I just want to tell you
[59:02] this morning, there's only one way, and
[59:05] that is God's way, and he has provided
[59:08] it in the Bible. Can you say amen?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't mix your church
[59:14] traditions with Jesus.
[59:16] Well, hallelujah. Amen. Well, Amen. I
[59:20] believe if I go to church and I I just
[59:22] believe if I pay my tithes and Amen. Oh,
[59:25] that's all wonderful. Amen. But that
[59:27] will never get you to heaven. Coming to
[59:29] church will never get you to heaven.
[59:31] Paying your tithes will never get you to
[59:33] heaven. It'll never bring you victory.
[59:35] But if you ever come in contact with
[59:37] Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ will save
[59:41] your soul.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; And then, brother, you we can't keep you
[59:47] out of church then. And then we can't
[59:49] keep you from the Bible then because
[59:51] once you meet Jesus Christ, he changes
[59:55] your perspective.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, can you say amen?
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got You can't You can't You
[1:00:01] can't mix them. You can't mix them.
[1:00:03] Hallelujah. Well, I'm going to I'm going
[1:00:05] to I'm going to smoke my cigarettes and
[1:00:08] Amen. I'm going to smoke my marijuana
[1:00:10] and still serve Jesus. Amen. That's not
[1:00:13] what the Bible says. Amen. So that's the
[1:00:15] wrong perspective and that won't get you
[1:00:17] to heaven. Well, I I I I believe that I
[1:00:20] can handle it this way and God knows my
[1:00:22] heart. Yes, he knows your heart is an
[1:00:25] evil heart of unbelief that is keeping
[1:00:27] you from seeing the promises of God. But
[1:00:31] if you can say, God, here I am, and I'm
[1:00:34] going to bow myself, amen, down before
[1:00:36] the the throne of Jesus Christ, and I'm
[1:00:40] going to call you, Lord. Your word will
[1:00:44] be my command and I will follow you and
[1:00:47] you will find that there is victory. How
[1:00:49] many wants victory here this morning?
[1:00:51] Amen. I'm talking about joy unspeakable
[1:00:54] and full of glory. I'm talking about the
[1:00:56] presence of God and the angels of God
[1:00:59] and the glory of God living with you and
[1:01:02] abiding in you because you have set your
[1:01:06] heart upon him and him alone.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:13] Now
[1:01:14] Jesus said
[1:01:17] you make there Mark 7:13
[1:01:20] you make the word of God of none effect
[1:01:23] through your traditions
[1:01:25] which you have delivered and many such
[1:01:27] things you do. You you you've made
[1:01:31] traditions and you've made the word of
[1:01:33] God of none effect
[1:01:35] because your perspective isn't well well
[1:01:38] well but but but but but remember God
[1:01:41] has no wells and buds. God has his word
[1:01:44] and we believe his word.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Victory comes from his word. Amen.
[1:01:51] They're there in Mark 7 and one. Let's
[1:01:53] let's look at one of the traditions
[1:01:55] here. And they come together unto him,
[1:01:57] the Pharisees, and certain of the
[1:01:59] scribes, and which come from Jerusalem.
[1:02:02] And when they saw some of his disciples
[1:02:04] eat bread with defi, uh, defiled with
[1:02:08] defiled, that is to say, with unwashing
[1:02:10] hands, they found fault. For the
[1:02:13] Pharisees and all the Jews, except they
[1:02:15] wash and they eat not. Many other things
[1:02:19] there be which they have received to
[1:02:22] hold. Amen.
[1:02:23] washing of cups and pots and brazen
[1:02:26] vessels and of tables. And then the
[1:02:28] Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why
[1:02:31] walk not thy disciples according to the
[1:02:34] tradition of the elders? But eat bread
[1:02:37] with unwashed hands?" And he answered
[1:02:39] and said unto them, Whale hath Isaiah
[1:02:42] prophesied, you hypocrites, as as it is
[1:02:46] written, the people honorth me with
[1:02:49] their lips, but their heart is far from
[1:02:53] me. So tradition can keep you from the
[1:02:57] realities of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Now come on church. The church is not a
[1:03:03] tradition. Amen. that rel Christianity
[1:03:07] is not a tradition. Christianity is a
[1:03:11] lifechanging experience with Jesus
[1:03:14] Christ. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[1:03:17] Lord. Amen. He says, "How be it?" He
[1:03:20] says in vain they do worship teaching uh
[1:03:24] uh for doctrines the commandments of men
[1:03:27] for laying aside the commandment of God.
[1:03:30] You hold the tradition of men as the
[1:03:33] washing of pots and cups and many other
[1:03:35] such things like ye do. Amen. But he
[1:03:38] said unto them for well you reject the
[1:03:42] commandment of God that ye may keep your
[1:03:45] own tradition. Now I want to say here
[1:03:48] today, amen. There should be a
[1:03:50] perspective. Amen. The right perspective
[1:03:52] of Christ. What is why did Christ come?
[1:03:56] Christ come to redeem us. Amen. What is
[1:04:00] to redeem? That means to come. Amen.
[1:04:02] When you're we when you've when you've
[1:04:04] taken something to the pawn shop.
[1:04:06] Hallelujah. Amen. And there there's been
[1:04:09] a I I remember Amen. There was there was
[1:04:12] a time where my Amen. I had some tools
[1:04:14] stolen and Amen. my my ladders were
[1:04:16] stolen and Amen. And so I go back I I
[1:04:20] one day I I I you know I thought well
[1:04:22] I'll find them somewhere in a pawn shop
[1:04:24] somewhere, you know. Amen. And and I and
[1:04:27] I go to a pawn shop and Amen. And I and
[1:04:30] I had a special place that I kept I kept
[1:04:32] my name and Amen. where I could find.
[1:04:35] And so Amen. I I turned the ladder
[1:04:37] around to where Amen. And there it was.
[1:04:40] Martin Electric. Hallelujah. Amen. Now
[1:04:43] you see Amen. that that was mine at the
[1:04:46] beginning. Somebody stole that thing
[1:04:49] from me. Amen. And it ended up in the
[1:04:51] pawn shop. But you see, in order to
[1:04:54] redeem it, I had to be willing to go
[1:04:58] back. Hallelujah. Pay the price to get
[1:05:02] my ladder. Well, glory to God. You know
[1:05:05] what that means? It was twice mine.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And you were a son of
[1:05:13] God. You were a daughter of God. God did
[1:05:18] not come to save you in your sin. He
[1:05:21] came to save you from your sin. There's
[1:05:25] a difference. He is not leaving you in
[1:05:27] your sin. He's not leaving you in the
[1:05:29] pawn shop. He's not leaving you in
[1:05:32] shackles. Amen. But God come to satisfy
[1:05:35] his soul. and his soul desired you to be
[1:05:39] by his side. Free from sin, free from
[1:05:42] addiction, free from the elements of
[1:05:44] this world. He wants you back. Well,
[1:05:47] praise the name of the Lord.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; To redeem back,
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; redemption,
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; the right perspective
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; to redeem back. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:05:59] Amen. Some of you serving the Lord, the
[1:06:00] devil's trying to tell you, "Amen. Oh,
[1:06:02] you've sinned too far. Amen. Oh, God's
[1:06:05] going to leave you now. You've you've
[1:06:06] fallen for the last count. I want to
[1:06:08] tell you, God's grace is right there
[1:06:10] saying, "I've called you and I'll not
[1:06:13] lose you."
[1:06:15] Oh, Satan's tried to destroy you.
[1:06:17] Satan's tried his hardest, amen, to
[1:06:19] destroy your life. He's done it all his,
[1:06:22] amen, all the days of your life, he's
[1:06:24] tried to keep you from salvation. But
[1:06:26] I'm here to tell you, his works are not
[1:06:29] big enough. Satan is not strong enough.
[1:06:32] The devil is not big enough to stop
[1:06:36] God's plan in your life. That's the
[1:06:39] perspective we should have.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Perspective.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Perspective was well, Amen.
[1:06:51] The perspective that says God wants to
[1:06:53] send you to hell
[1:06:55] and he's just waiting for you to fall.
[1:07:00] Amen. That way he can make a grief spot
[1:07:03] out of you.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; That's not God's perspective.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; God's perspective is to take you back
[1:07:09] home with him.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; God's not halfway. Praise the Lord. Man,
[1:07:17] you see, we run every stop sign and we
[1:07:19] run every barrier and we run, but it's
[1:07:22] not God's intention to send anyone to
[1:07:24] hell. Matters of fact, God sends no one
[1:07:26] to hell.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; But a person with a wrong perspective
[1:07:32] will run every stop sign. It'll run over
[1:07:36] God's word over and over and over. Can
[1:07:39] you say amen?
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; God's word is here for you and me. It's
[1:07:44] a love letter. Somebody say, "It's a
[1:07:46] love letter
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; to me and you."
[1:07:49] Now the Apostle Paul,
[1:07:54] he was talking to the the churches there
[1:07:57] in Galatia
[1:08:00] and he had a burden on his mind because
[1:08:04] they had started out
[1:08:06] in mind in the gospel and and throughout
[1:08:09] throughout the book of Galatians you you
[1:08:12] will hear the Apostle Paul and and you
[1:08:15] know was he
[1:08:17] he he would say uh that they're in
[1:08:20] they're in uh Galatians 1 and6. I marvel
[1:08:23] that you were so soon removed
[1:08:26] from him him Christ that called you into
[1:08:31] the grace of God and to another gospel
[1:08:33] which is not another but there be some
[1:08:36] that trouble you and pervert the gospel
[1:08:38] of Christ. But though we or an angel
[1:08:40] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[1:08:42] you than what we have uh preached unto
[1:08:45] you, let him be accursed. And as we said
[1:08:48] before, now so say I again, if any man
[1:08:52] preach any other gospel unto you, than
[1:08:54] ye have received, let him be accursed.
[1:08:57] For do I now persuade men or God? Do I
[1:09:00] seek to please men? For if I if I yet
[1:09:03] please men, I should not be the servant
[1:09:05] of Christ. He goes to the third verse,
[1:09:07] third chapter and he says, "Oh foolish
[1:09:09] Galatians, who has bewitched you that
[1:09:13] you should not obey the truth before
[1:09:15] whose eyes Jesus Christ have been
[1:09:17] evidently set forth crucified among
[1:09:19] you?" He He's saying he says, "W did how
[1:09:23] did you learn of any of this? Receive ye
[1:09:26] the spirit uh by the works of the law or
[1:09:28] the hearing of faith? Are you so
[1:09:30] foolish? Having begun in the spirit? Are
[1:09:32] you now made perfect in the flesh? Have
[1:09:35] you suffered so many things in vain and
[1:09:36] yet it be in vain? Can you say amen?
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; And then Paul would begin to illustrate.
[1:09:42] He says, "At one time the religion of my
[1:09:46] nation, my people, my that the
[1:09:50] traditions
[1:09:51] of of my people were so strong in my
[1:09:54] life.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; I'd followed these traditions."
[1:09:58] Amen. And he says, "I was I was head and
[1:10:02] shoulders above them all." Amen. The
[1:10:06] traditions of the elders, and I I was a
[1:10:08] spiritual man among them. Amen. There in
[1:10:11] the book of Philippians, he begins to he
[1:10:13] begins to talk
[1:10:15] where he stood. Amen. Wii with those and
[1:10:18] and and and then Amen. I he he would
[1:10:21] just bring there in the third uh
[1:10:24] Philippians 3:7 it says but what things
[1:10:27] were gained to me those things I count
[1:10:30] loss for Christ yay doubtless I count
[1:10:33] all things but loss for the excellency
[1:10:36] of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:10:39] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:10:41] things and do count them but dung that I
[1:10:43] may win Christ and what he was saying
[1:10:46] was all of the position that I had in my
[1:10:51] among my people.
[1:10:53] When I got the perspective
[1:10:57] of Christ and when I seen what he was
[1:11:00] trying to lead me to,
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; when that light appeared to me on that
[1:11:05] road to Damascus,
[1:11:08] I found something greater than all of
[1:11:11] the traditions and the religious element
[1:11:14] of my people. Hallelujah. Amen. all of
[1:11:18] the all of the uh uh ceremonies and all
[1:11:21] of the deals of the Jewish people. He
[1:11:23] said, "I was there. I was at the top. I
[1:11:26] was at the very top. I was there.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; But when I met Christ,
[1:11:32] my perspective changed. I seen that God
[1:11:35] was not trying to make me a a religious
[1:11:39] person. He was trying to redeem me. And
[1:11:43] I am willing to go to death. I am I am
[1:11:46] in prison while writing this letter to
[1:11:48] you, oh Philippians. He says, I'm in
[1:11:51] prison for this cause, but I count it
[1:11:54] all joy. I count it all joy for the man
[1:11:58] or the Christ that I met has changed my
[1:12:01] life. And I want to say today, I count
[1:12:04] it all joy for the Christ that I have
[1:12:09] met is not religion. It's not another
[1:12:12] name on a book. But I have found a
[1:12:15] reality. I don't need the things of the
[1:12:18] world. I don't need the religion
[1:12:20] anymore. Amen. I am willing to set aside
[1:12:23] all the tradition. And I want to walk
[1:12:25] with the living God. Well, can you say
[1:12:28] amen? Amen. He satisfies my heart. Amen.
[1:12:32] With singing. He satisfies my heart with
[1:12:35] joy. He Oh, can you say amen? What is
[1:12:38] it? It is the realities of Jesus Christ
[1:12:43] in me.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is for Sister Joy. It is
[1:12:49] joy unspeakable
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; and full of glory. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:55] Sister Joy gets to get preached about
[1:12:57] every time she comes to church or goes
[1:12:58] to church. Joy unspeakable, full of
[1:13:01] glory. And the half has never yet been
[1:13:04] told. Well, can you say amen? I want to
[1:13:07] say amen. Our name should be joy. Our
[1:13:09] name should be peace. Our name should be
[1:13:12] full of happiness. Why? Because we have
[1:13:15] found a reality in Jesus Christ.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's word has told us that God
[1:13:27] would bring a covenant through the
[1:13:28] blood. It was always a covenant
[1:13:32] around that blood.
[1:13:35] Atonement means to cover over to make
[1:13:39] reconciliation.
[1:13:41] To atone for one, amen,
[1:13:46] is to pacify or to satisfy the verdict
[1:13:50] of the judge of a judge.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; It is to atone for by legal rights. So
[1:13:57] when we say that Christ his blood atoned
[1:14:01] for our sins, it is saying
[1:14:05] that this one was accepted by the judge
[1:14:10] that the penalty would be forever more
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; paid
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; and there would be reconciling.
[1:14:19] No longer in the prison house, no longer
[1:14:22] under condemnation, but Christ has
[1:14:26] atoned. He has redeemed. He has brought
[1:14:30] us back into right standing with God.
[1:14:33] Brother, that should be your perspective
[1:14:35] here this morning.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; This kind of thought, well, I don't
[1:14:41] know. I'm just not worthy. That's the
[1:14:43] wrong perspective.
[1:14:46] Christ came that I could be righteous.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; I refuse to accept religion. I refuse to
[1:14:55] accept tradition. I refuse to accept
[1:14:57] anything that I cannot verify and
[1:15:00] validate in the Bible.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. And neither should
[1:15:06] you.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, Amen. In this especially
[1:15:10] in this last days, the call for this
[1:15:12] last day was come out from among them
[1:15:16] and be ye separate. Who are they talk?
[1:15:18] Who's he talking about? He was talking
[1:15:20] about that apostate church who was
[1:15:22] following after the traditions of of of
[1:15:25] the Old Testament. They were follow and
[1:15:27] continuing to do the old traditional
[1:15:30] ways. The Catholic church. Amen. That
[1:15:32] and and and and these other churches
[1:15:34] around that are bringing in Amen.
[1:15:36] man-made dogma, man-made creeds that you
[1:15:41] can't even find in the Bible. Amen. You
[1:15:43] can't find praying to Mary in the Bible.
[1:15:46] You can't pray. You can't find Amen. Uh
[1:15:49] uh all of these things. Amen. That you
[1:15:51] know when you when you swallow the
[1:15:53] little the the little kosher bread that
[1:15:55] you Amen. that you have partaking of the
[1:15:57] literal body of Christ. Amen. That that
[1:16:00] ain't in there. Well, come on, church.
[1:16:02] Amen. That ain't in there. Amen. that
[1:16:04] you can come and and and just that you
[1:16:06] can live any life you want to live.
[1:16:09] Amen. What does Lord mean anyways? What
[1:16:12] does Lord mean? Lord means that you are
[1:16:16] surrendering your rights, surrendering
[1:16:18] your will, surrendering, Amen.
[1:16:21] everything you are to the headship of
[1:16:24] another.
[1:16:26] And if Jesus Christ is Lord, if he is
[1:16:31] the King, then those that are under him
[1:16:34] are to do his wishes. And his wishes are
[1:16:38] found in here.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; It's not found in the Almanac.
[1:16:45] It's not found on YouTube. It's not It's
[1:16:49] not found on Google. It's found in his
[1:16:53] word.
[1:16:57] Hallelujah. Now, the Bible says there's
[1:16:59] going to be many on that day that had
[1:17:02] the wrong perspective. They're going to
[1:17:04] come up to Jesus and they're going to
[1:17:07] knock
[1:17:10] and they he's they're going to say, "Let
[1:17:12] us in." Lord,
[1:17:15] somebody say, "Lord."
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Lord. Lord. We're going to say it twice
[1:17:22] here.
[1:17:23] Have we not cast out devils? Have we not
[1:17:27] worked miracles? Have we not done these
[1:17:30] things in your name? And Jesus is going
[1:17:34] to say, you workers of iniquity
[1:17:39] because you have done not the will of my
[1:17:43] father.
[1:17:45] A part
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; perspective
[1:17:53] is everything.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; If he is my Lord, then what do we do? We
[1:18:00] take his word. And brother, there's only
[1:18:03] going to be one group that makes the
[1:18:04] rapture. And those that are of those
[1:18:06] that have made him Lord.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm glad for? I'm glad
[1:18:11] he's given us his word. Now, we can
[1:18:13] prepare for the rapture. We can prepare
[1:18:16] to meet him right now. Oh, God's good
[1:18:18] God. God is a loving God. God sent you
[1:18:21] to this church service this morning to
[1:18:23] hear this uh Amen. this fat preacher
[1:18:25] preach. Amen. So that we can know who we
[1:18:28] are and who he is. Can you say amen?
[1:18:31] Amen. God, take away my tradition. Take
[1:18:34] away my religion. Take away the things
[1:18:36] of this world. Let me see Jesus for who
[1:18:40] he is. Let me make him the Lord of my
[1:18:43] life.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Only the blood can
[1:18:49] satisfy the courts of heaven. Well, can
[1:18:52] you say amen?
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; God was the first one to slay a lamb.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Did you know that God was the first one
[1:18:59] to slay a lamb when Adam and Eve had
[1:19:01] fallen?
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; God slew a lamb. And then with the that
[1:19:05] same lamb, he took the coat. He took the
[1:19:10] skins of that lamb
[1:19:13] and put it around their naked bodies
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; and they walked out of the garden.
[1:19:21] What was it that there was going to be
[1:19:24] the lamb of God to come and he was going
[1:19:28] to take away our sins
[1:19:30] and his righteousness?
[1:19:34] his righteousness would cover all of our
[1:19:37] unrighteousness. What am I trying to
[1:19:39] tell you? When you take on the blood of
[1:19:42] Jesus Christ and you come under the
[1:19:44] headship of his word, his covering,
[1:19:47] Amen. You're as righteous as God is.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; I believe what God says. God, well,
[1:19:52] praise the name of the Lord. Amen. You
[1:19:54] know what I should say? What what I what
[1:19:56] what I want to Amen. stress to you this
[1:19:58] morning? Set your eyes upon that goal of
[1:20:01] redemption. Set your eyes on that goal
[1:20:04] of redemption. Redemption is not to
[1:20:07] leave me here. Redemption is to take me
[1:20:10] back where I fell from.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Redemption is not to leave
[1:20:16] me in sorrow and misery. Redemption is
[1:20:19] to pour me out and to give me a peace.
[1:20:22] Amen. That is full of heavenly life and
[1:20:25] his blessing. Well, can you say amen?
[1:20:27] Amen. there in Luke 9 and62 Jesus said
[1:20:30] unto them no man having put his hand
[1:20:33] into the plow looking back is fit for
[1:20:36] the kingdom of God. Hebrews 10 and38 now
[1:20:39] the judge shall live by faith but if any
[1:20:42] man draw back my soul shall have no
[1:20:46] pleasure in him but we are not of them
[1:20:49] who draw back unto predition but of them
[1:20:53] that believe to the saving of the soul.
[1:20:55] And God, if you started me, I'm going to
[1:20:57] keep on oppressing. God, if you gave me
[1:21:00] the Holy Ghost, I'm going to keep on.
[1:21:02] Well, can you say amen? He that has
[1:21:04] started you is going to finish you.
[1:21:06] Amen. He's going to take you to that.
[1:21:08] Hallelujah. There's a brand new body
[1:21:10] waiting on you. There's a brand new city
[1:21:13] waiting on you. There's a God of heaven
[1:21:16] bringing you back to himself.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. In order to keep pressing,
[1:21:26] the Apostle Paul told us in Hebrews
[1:21:27] 12:2,
[1:21:29] Amen. We got to keep our eyes upon the
[1:21:32] one who's called us.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; He says, "Looking unto Jesus,
[1:21:37] the author
[1:21:39] and the finisher." Somebody say, "The
[1:21:40] author
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; and the finisher
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; of our faith."
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; The right perspective. Now, I'm going to
[1:21:48] keep looking at him. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:51] You're saying, "Brother Wendle, I've
[1:21:53] given my life to God and God knows it.
[1:21:56] My heart is to please him. Brother
[1:21:59] Wendle, I'm in an area in my life where
[1:22:01] Satan where I I I it just seems like
[1:22:04] he's got a stronghold." You just got to
[1:22:07] keep your eyes upon the one who started
[1:22:09] you and the one who's going to finish
[1:22:11] you
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; because the Bible done told us in
[1:22:13] Ephesians 6, amen, that we are in a
[1:22:17] warfare. And he says, "You've got to put
[1:22:19] on, amen, the the the breastplate of
[1:22:22] righteousness, and you've got to put on
[1:22:24] the helmet of salvation, and you've got
[1:22:26] to have your feet shaw with the
[1:22:28] preparation of the gospel. And you've
[1:22:30] got to take the sword of the spirit."
[1:22:31] What is he doing all of this for? Is
[1:22:33] because the devil don't want you going
[1:22:35] to your inheritance. The de But God's
[1:22:38] God didn't just save you. He has
[1:22:41] equipped you to fight.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, church.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's one thing for you for
[1:22:48] him to come and and and and and and
[1:22:51] remove the padlock from your jail cell,
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; but it's another thing for him to
[1:22:59] give you a bazooka and whatever else.
[1:23:02] Amen. Give you the rifles and Amen. the
[1:23:05] machinery to any devil that says that
[1:23:07] you can't come out, just Hallelujah.
[1:23:11] Any devil that's trying to keep you in
[1:23:13] that jail cell, just put him down. Well,
[1:23:16] come on, church. Amen. God did not just
[1:23:19] say, "Okay, I I I've saved you." Amen.
[1:23:22] Now, I'm just going to leave you in your
[1:23:24] condition. No, sir. He sent the baptism
[1:23:26] of the Holy Ghost back to us. He given
[1:23:28] us his word. He's given us what it takes
[1:23:31] to fight. And he's saying, "Fight,
[1:23:32] fight. Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight. Don't
[1:23:35] turn aside. Don't turn around. Fight
[1:23:36] with all that you've got. I've called
[1:23:38] you for a heavenly purpose.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Looking unto Jesus who is the author and
[1:23:51] the finisher of our faith.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Who for and and I'm back in
[1:23:59] Hebrews 12 and two. who for the joy
[1:24:04] that was set before him
[1:24:08] endured
[1:24:09] the cross.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me here this morning?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Now, the right perspective. God's not
[1:24:18] leaving me. Amen. As a reject, God's
[1:24:21] God's God's called me and he has
[1:24:24] anointed me
[1:24:26] to prevail over the enemy.
[1:24:30] He says, "I want you to look to Jesus,
[1:24:31] who is the author and the finisher of
[1:24:33] your faith, and I want you to see what
[1:24:34] caused him to keep going
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; and never turn back.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Who for the joy that was set before him
[1:24:43] endured the cross,
[1:24:47] despising the shame, and is set down at
[1:24:50] the right hand of God." Can you say
[1:24:52] amen? Now, what was this joy
[1:24:56] that was set before him?
[1:25:00] How would he know what the joy was? He
[1:25:03] was ever bit a man. You say, "Well, he
[1:25:06] knew everything."
[1:25:08] When they were asking Jesus, "When will
[1:25:10] you come back?" He said, "Even the son
[1:25:12] doesn't know when he's coming back." We
[1:25:14] don't I don't know. Jesus Jesus said
[1:25:17] that, "I don't know."
[1:25:19] Hallelujah.
[1:25:22] How did Jesus know these things? He
[1:25:24] searched the scripture. When the
[1:25:26] disciple when the Pharisees were coming
[1:25:27] against him, amen, he says there in John
[1:25:31] 5:39, he says, "Search search the
[1:25:33] scripture from them. You think you have
[1:25:34] eternal life and they they which testify
[1:25:37] of me." Is that right? The Bible says
[1:25:40] that Jesus went up to the to to to the
[1:25:46] to the temple and and
[1:25:49] as all eyes were fastened upon him, he
[1:25:51] come and he took the scroll and he
[1:25:52] opened the scroll up and and He read.
[1:25:56] Amen. He says unto him, he says that
[1:25:59] there in Luke 4 and1 17 there was
[1:26:02] delivered unto him the book of the
[1:26:03] prophet Isaiah. And when he opened the
[1:26:05] book, he found the place where it is
[1:26:08] written. Then he starts reading the
[1:26:11] spirit of the lord is upon me because he
[1:26:13] has anointed me to preach the gospel and
[1:26:15] he's pre and he's talking about himself.
[1:26:17] Then down to the 20th verse he says he
[1:26:19] closed the book. He gave it again to the
[1:26:21] minister and sat down. And all the eyes
[1:26:23] of all of them that were in the
[1:26:26] synagogue were fastened on him. And he
[1:26:27] began to say unto them, "This day is
[1:26:30] this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
[1:26:33] What was this joy? How did Jesus How did
[1:26:37] Jesus
[1:26:39] what kept him in line with the father's
[1:26:42] will? He found where it was written in
[1:26:45] him in the Bible.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; He found the places in the Bible He knew
[1:26:50] who he was. I'm getting someplace here
[1:26:52] in a minute. God wants you to know who
[1:26:55] you are.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; He wants you to know because if you know
[1:27:00] who you are, then you know who you're
[1:27:02] not.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; If you know that you're a son and
[1:27:05] daughter of God and that God's anointed
[1:27:07] you to defeat the devil, then you're not
[1:27:09] a slave. You're not a victim.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen?
[1:27:17] when they were asking Jesus, "Hey, give
[1:27:18] us a sign. Give us a sign." He says,
[1:27:20] "There's only one sign I'm going to give
[1:27:22] you."
[1:27:23] Just as Jonas was buried in in the belly
[1:27:27] of the well for three days and three
[1:27:28] nights, so will the Son of Man.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; He had a lot of He was he he he he was
[1:27:36] borderline arrogant. According to those
[1:27:38] guys, he wasn't arrogant. He was
[1:27:41] confident. The scripture has declared
[1:27:45] who he was.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, sons and daughters of God.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Jesus found himself in
[1:27:52] the scripture. That that that scripture
[1:27:54] there before we move on there, Psalms 40
[1:27:57] and six. And I and this is powerful
[1:27:59] because the apostle Paul brings it up as
[1:28:01] well. But that there in Psalms 40 and 6,
[1:28:03] sacrifice and offering thou did not
[1:28:05] desire. Mine ears hast thou opened.
[1:28:10] burnt offering and sin offering hast
[1:28:12] thou not required. Then said I, lo, I
[1:28:15] come in the volume of the book, it is
[1:28:17] written of me, I delight to do thy will,
[1:28:20] oh God, yay, thy law is within my heart.
[1:28:24] Now there in Hebrews 10 and5, it says,
[1:28:27] therefore, when Christ entered into the
[1:28:29] world, he says, sacrifi, and and this is
[1:28:32] this I'm reading out of the amplified
[1:28:34] version. Keep just follow me along, but
[1:28:35] this is the amplified version. Sacrifice
[1:28:38] and offering you have not desired, but
[1:28:41] instead you have prepared a body for me
[1:28:44] to offer. In burnt offerings and
[1:28:46] sacrifices for sin, you have taken no
[1:28:48] delight. Then said I, behold, I have
[1:28:53] come to do your will, oh God, to fulfill
[1:28:56] that what is written of me in the scroll
[1:28:59] of the book.
[1:29:01] after saying in the citation above, ye
[1:29:04] have neither desired nor have you taken
[1:29:06] delight in sacrifices and offerings and
[1:29:08] whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[1:29:11] sin which are offered according to the
[1:29:12] law. Then he said, "Behold,
[1:29:16] I have come to do your will.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; I have come." Are you catching what he's
[1:29:22] saying here?
[1:29:25] I have found
[1:29:27] my perspective.
[1:29:31] is being molded
[1:29:33] by what I have found in scripture.
[1:29:37] What I want to bring to you as I begin
[1:29:39] to wind down my thoughts here today,
[1:29:45] you find your place in the scripture.
[1:29:50] You say, "H, what do you mean find my
[1:29:55] place in the scripture?"
[1:30:00] Did you realize that here in this last
[1:30:03] church age, Ephesians 3 and9 has
[1:30:06] something very specifically toward you
[1:30:10] to make all men, it means the world to
[1:30:13] see what is the fellowship of the
[1:30:15] mystery which from the beginning of the
[1:30:17] world has been hidden God who created
[1:30:19] all things by Jesus Christ to the intent
[1:30:22] that now unto the principalities and
[1:30:24] powers in heavenly places might be made
[1:30:26] known by the church, the wisdom of God
[1:30:30] according to the purpose which he
[1:30:31] purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord. Now I
[1:30:34] I I want to read this in the NIV
[1:30:38] there in the 10th verse. His intent was
[1:30:42] that now through the church the manifold
[1:30:44] wisdom of God should be made known to
[1:30:47] the rulers and and authorities the
[1:30:50] devils demons sickness addictions in the
[1:30:53] heavenly realms according to his eternal
[1:30:56] purpose.
[1:31:00] Romans 8:19.
[1:31:03] Romans 8:19. For the earnest expectation
[1:31:05] of the creature waits for the
[1:31:07] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:31:11] The creature was made subject to vanity,
[1:31:13] not willingly,
[1:31:15] but by reason of him who has subjected
[1:31:17] the same in hope.
[1:31:19] Because the creature itself also shall
[1:31:22] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:31:24] corruption into the liberty, glorious
[1:31:26] liberty of the children of God. For we
[1:31:29] know that the whole creation groans and
[1:31:32] travails in pain together
[1:31:36] until now.
[1:31:40] It's all pointing
[1:31:42] to this day when the coming of the Lord
[1:31:45] is so close.
[1:31:50] When the coming of the Lord is so close,
[1:31:52] there's going to be a revelation in the
[1:31:55] hearts of God's elect.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Our perception
[1:32:01] is going to change in the evening time.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Our perception of Jesus Christ. Now, we
[1:32:10] have gone through ages. Amen. Y'all
[1:32:13] still with me?
[1:32:14] We have gone through the church ages
[1:32:17] where it's been traditions, men's
[1:32:18] opinions. We've had all of these going
[1:32:20] down. It's been a lot of tradition.
[1:32:24] But the scripture says there in first uh
[1:32:27] 1 Corinthians 13:10, but when that which
[1:32:29] is perfect is come, then that which is
[1:32:33] done in part shall be done away.
[1:32:36] When I was a child, I spake as a child.
[1:32:38] I understood as a child. I thought as a
[1:32:42] child, but when I become a man, I put
[1:32:46] away childish things.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; For now, we see through a glass darkly,
[1:32:53] but then face to face. Now I know in
[1:32:56] part, but then I shall know even as I am
[1:33:01] known.
[1:33:02] What's he talking about? The day right
[1:33:05] before the coming of the Lord, there's
[1:33:07] going to be the revelation of the son of
[1:33:09] man. There's going to be the Messiah
[1:33:11] sign again.
[1:33:14] That Messiah sign is to come. Jesus
[1:33:17] said, "As it was in the days of Sodom,
[1:33:19] so shall it be in the revealing of the
[1:33:21] son of man." In other words, God is
[1:33:22] going to reveal himself.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Greater in this day. You say, "Now,
[1:33:30] Brother Wendle, I no, no, no, no. I'm
[1:33:33] talking about the promise is the God is
[1:33:37] going to come in a supernatural way to
[1:33:40] those who are willing
[1:33:43] to take on his perspective.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And we're going to know God in a way
[1:33:50] greater.
[1:33:53] How else do you think this rapture is
[1:33:55] going to take place?
[1:33:58] There's going to be a generation that is
[1:34:00] going to come and rise up and say
[1:34:08] I know what this is about.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; In other words, God is that the Bible
[1:34:12] also says that that there was going to
[1:34:14] be that time of adoption.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Adoption. The Bible days of adoption
[1:34:18] wasn't wasn't necessarily taking someone
[1:34:20] from another family and putting them
[1:34:21] into this one. adoption was when the son
[1:34:25] when when when the the the son as he was
[1:34:28] raised, you know, as a baby, he was got
[1:34:31] up to a certain age where he was given
[1:34:33] over to a tutor. The tutor would tutor
[1:34:36] him, teach him the father's kingdom,
[1:34:38] would would would would show him and and
[1:34:40] and that tutor would would would bring
[1:34:43] him up from a child. The Bible says, "As
[1:34:46] long as he is a child, he differs
[1:34:49] nothing from a servant, though he be the
[1:34:50] heir of all.
[1:34:52] Amen.
[1:34:53] So the scripture says
[1:34:56] that they is there is an adoption and
[1:34:59] then the Jewish family what they would
[1:35:01] do when the son come to appoint the
[1:35:04] father would come to to to the tutor
[1:35:06] throughout the years say how's my son
[1:35:08] coming along oh you'd be proud of him
[1:35:10] you'd be proud of him he's he's learning
[1:35:12] good and he's hey yeah he's still got a
[1:35:14] lot he's still a kid he's still a kid
[1:35:16] but I'm telling you there comes a day
[1:35:18] when father comes and asks the tutor
[1:35:20] how's he coming along he say you You
[1:35:23] know what?
[1:35:24] This man is taking on
[1:35:29] your thoughts.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; He is looking at all of your wealth as
[1:35:34] you would look at it. Don't fear him.
[1:35:37] He's not going to he's he's not going to
[1:35:39] squander the inheritance. He's not going
[1:35:42] to he's he's not going to go spend his
[1:35:45] money on righteous living.
[1:35:47] This son of yours is ready.
[1:35:50] He's ready to be adopted. And what he
[1:35:52] would do, Amen. He would set him out
[1:35:55] there before all of the people and he
[1:35:57] would he would go through a ceremony. He
[1:35:59] says, "This day I adopt my son. I set
[1:36:03] him over the inheritance."
[1:36:06] He would put a robe upon him and give
[1:36:08] him a ring and whatever he said. Doesn't
[1:36:11] that not sound like Jesus Christ? Does
[1:36:14] that not sound like what happened to
[1:36:15] Jesus? Well, that's what God is doing to
[1:36:19] us in this day in the rapture season.
[1:36:21] What are we going to do? God is calling
[1:36:24] a group of men and women, sons and
[1:36:26] daughters of God, that have came and
[1:36:29] subjected themselves to the tutor, the
[1:36:31] Holy Spirit, who has taught us the word,
[1:36:34] given us the inheritance. What are we
[1:36:37] fixing to do? We're fixing to walk out
[1:36:39] on the ashes of the wicked. The Bible
[1:36:41] says that you are going to inherit the
[1:36:43] earth.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; You are going to rule and reign on the
[1:36:47] Come on, church. There is a people that
[1:36:51] the Holy Spirit is going to give a
[1:36:54] perspective
[1:36:56] like no other age.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's just all smoke
[1:37:06] and mirrors." That's what the Bible
[1:37:07] says. I don't know what you've been
[1:37:09] taught, but that's what the Bible says.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:14] Amen.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; The prophet would say according to this
[1:37:17] scripture there in question and answers
[1:37:18] he 1 Corinthians 13 says that uh when
[1:37:21] that which is perfect has come that
[1:37:23] which is in part should be done away
[1:37:25] with. So all these little things of
[1:37:26] jumping up and down like a kid and
[1:37:28] trying to talk in tongues and all these
[1:37:30] other things
[1:37:33] than that which is perfect. And we do
[1:37:35] have today by God's help the perfect
[1:37:38] interpretation of the word with divine
[1:37:40] vindication. Then that which is in part
[1:37:43] is done away with. When I was a child, I
[1:37:46] spake as a child. I understood as a
[1:37:47] child. But when I become a man, I put
[1:37:50] away childish things. God always uses
[1:37:53] man. God has put man over this earth.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; And God's wanting some men and women.
[1:38:03] You ain't going to be nothing for the
[1:38:04] kingdom as long as you're still in the
[1:38:05] pawn shop.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; You can't live and reign as long as
[1:38:09] you're still behind the jail cell.
[1:38:12] God's not called you to stay in sin.
[1:38:14] God's not called you to stay in
[1:38:16] unbelief. God's not called you to stay
[1:38:17] in tradition.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; God has come to break you free.
[1:38:22] [Applause]
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; And he whom the Son has set free is free
[1:38:28] indeed.
[1:38:31] Can you say amen?
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you see why the devil
[1:38:35] wants to keep you in unbelief? You know
[1:38:37] why the devil wants to keep you there?
[1:38:38] because he knows that if you take God's
[1:38:40] word, Amen, in my name, they shall cast
[1:38:42] out devils. They shall lay hands on the
[1:38:45] sick and they shall recover. Amen. In my
[1:38:47] Well, come on, church. Amen. That's what
[1:38:50] you have been anointed and called to. I
[1:38:52] say, God, give me the right perspective.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Give me the right perspective. Give me
[1:38:57] the right Give me Let me see your word
[1:39:00] as you want it seen. Let me see you. Let
[1:39:02] me see me
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; for who you've called me to be.
[1:39:08] Can you say amen?
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; God's always used man. Now, when God
[1:39:12] looked at Adam and he gave man, he said
[1:39:16] unto Adam into that spirit being, Amen.
[1:39:20] He told him to to to multiply and to
[1:39:24] rule and have dominion over the fish of
[1:39:27] the sea and the fowl of the air and
[1:39:29] every beast. He told him, he gave him
[1:39:32] dominion.
[1:39:34] The prophet would say
[1:39:37] if he was in the beginning,
[1:39:39] he lauded his word so much for each
[1:39:42] generation, each time that he had this
[1:39:45] age coming on. He's omnipresent,
[1:39:47] omniscent, omnipotent, he's infinite. If
[1:39:51] he isn't, he isn't God. Being fine,
[1:39:53] infinite, he's eternal. Then in that
[1:39:56] being omnipresent, being omnisient,
[1:39:58] knowing all things makes him
[1:40:00] omnipresent. He's the same yesterday,
[1:40:02] today, and forever. Therefore, he could
[1:40:04] tell the end from the beginning. And in
[1:40:06] each age, he allotted so much of the
[1:40:08] word in each age. And then usually man
[1:40:12] gets it all twisted up and gets the
[1:40:14] world gets in a such a shape until he
[1:40:17] has to send an anointed man. And all the
[1:40:20] ages have been the same. And he
[1:40:22] identifies himself up on the earth and
[1:40:24] that man and in man and God does nothing
[1:40:28] without man. The Bible said so. You know
[1:40:31] that he always takes a man because it
[1:40:34] was man that he has to use. Oh, somebody
[1:40:38] say, "Lord, use me."
[1:40:41] Lord, use me.
[1:40:44] Can you say amen?
[1:40:46] Oh, God's grace is abounding for this
[1:40:48] age, and it's more than enough. The
[1:40:51] Romans 5 and 20, moreover, the law
[1:40:53] entered that offense might abound, but
[1:40:55] when where sin abounded, grace did much
[1:40:58] more. abound.
[1:41:01] Ephesians 1:7 and in whom we have
[1:41:02] redemption through his blood, the
[1:41:04] forgiveness of sins, according to the
[1:41:06] riches, somebody say riches of his
[1:41:09] grace,
[1:41:11] wherein he hath abounded, in other
[1:41:13] words, in abundance, overflow, came
[1:41:16] running. He has abounded toward us in
[1:41:19] all wisdom and prudence.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; How much am I forgiven, brother Wendle?
[1:41:26] How much? Well, the Apostle Paul was a
[1:41:29] murderer.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; He was a blasphemer.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; And in 1 Timothy 1:12, he says, "I thank
[1:41:36] Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled
[1:41:40] me, for that he counted me faithful,
[1:41:43] putting me into the ministry, who was
[1:41:45] before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and
[1:41:49] injurous. But I obtained mercy because I
[1:41:53] did it ignorantly in unbelief. And the
[1:41:55] grace of our Lord was exceeding
[1:41:58] abundant. Well, someone shout
[1:42:00] hallelujah.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; And the grace of our Lord, I'm telling
[1:42:04] you a different perspective, church. I'm
[1:42:08] giving you a different perspective.
[1:42:10] Don't look at this thing as just another
[1:42:12] religious ceremony. Why don't you come
[1:42:14] to the reality that you are a son of
[1:42:18] God?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; You always were a son of God. Satan
[1:42:24] tries to keep you bound. Come to Jesus.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Says, "The grace of our Lord was
[1:42:33] exceeding abundant with faith and love
[1:42:35] which is in Christ Jesus." This is a
[1:42:38] faithful saying and worthy of all
[1:42:40] acceptation
[1:42:42] that Jesus that Christ Jesus came into
[1:42:44] the world to save sinners of whom I am
[1:42:47] chief.
[1:42:49] Can you say amen?
[1:42:52] Oh, glory to God.
[1:42:56] Mary, you you say, "Well, I'm I'm just
[1:42:58] I'm just a little mom. That's it." Amen.
[1:43:02] God doesn't hear me.
[1:43:04] Hallelujah. But you're a daughter,
[1:43:10] Wally. You might say, "Well, I'm just
[1:43:14] I'm just an older man beginning to see
[1:43:16] my letter days. I I I
[1:43:19] don't know if God can do anything for
[1:43:21] me. You're a son of God.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; You can look around even even to the
[1:43:31] children. Hallelujah. I don't know who
[1:43:33] we'd pick on this morning, Sister
[1:43:35] Charity.
[1:43:36] You might say, "I don't know, brother
[1:43:38] Wendle." God says, "Ah, you're my
[1:43:40] daughter."
[1:43:44] If you're called, God provides what it
[1:43:48] takes.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Can you say amen?
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Moses looking around and saying, "I I I
[1:43:58] can't go deliver those people because
[1:43:59] God came down and says, I've called you
[1:44:00] to go deliver those people." And and and
[1:44:02] he said, "I can't do it. I I I just they
[1:44:05] they won't hurt you." there in Exodus
[1:44:06] 4:1 and Moses answered and says, "But
[1:44:08] behold, they will not believe me, nor
[1:44:10] will they hearken unto me, for they will
[1:44:11] say, the Lord hath not appeared unto
[1:44:12] thee, unto thee." And the Lord said,
[1:44:16] "What is in thine hand?"
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; And he says, "A rod."
[1:44:25] The 17th verse, it says, "Thou shalt
[1:44:27] take this rod in thy hand wherewith thou
[1:44:30] shalt do signs." And Moses delivered the
[1:44:33] entire nation of Israel.
[1:44:38] What do you have in your hand here this
[1:44:40] morning? Well, according to the
[1:44:42] perspective that I've just put out
[1:44:44] there, you're not a loser.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; You're not a wannabe.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; You are here in this service this
[1:44:52] morning because God's got a purpose for
[1:44:54] you here on this earth.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor and say, "God's
[1:44:58] got a purpose
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; for you being here on this earth."
[1:45:03] Hallelujah.
[1:45:05] He's got a purpose
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; and you're never going to be satisfied
[1:45:09] until that purpose is fulfilled.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Well, what do you
[1:45:15] have in your hand? Well, all I've got,
[1:45:17] I'm just a little housewife. That sounds
[1:45:19] good. Just go with it and start whooping
[1:45:21] on devils.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Well, what can I do? Your prayer is
[1:45:25] powerful.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Your words are powerful. Speak the name
[1:45:30] of Jesus over your children. Amen. when
[1:45:32] they're when when it's going when it's
[1:45:33] when when when they're when your
[1:45:34] children are going wall, you know, and
[1:45:36] this that and the other and attitudes
[1:45:38] are, Amen. You just stand firm on who
[1:45:40] you are. Don't you lose your
[1:45:42] perspective. Don't you let your mind get
[1:45:45] caught up in a whirlwind. Don't you let
[1:45:47] Amen. I don't know. I I I No. Stand up
[1:45:50] like a daughter of God and say, "Those
[1:45:52] children are mine." And you just start
[1:45:53] speaking the word of God over those
[1:45:55] children.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; I still speak the word of God over my
[1:45:59] children. I speak the word of God over
[1:46:01] my ch all of my grandchildren. Amen. I
[1:46:04] speak the word of God over Actually, I
[1:46:05] speak the word of God over all of you
[1:46:07] young people. I I I'm constantly
[1:46:09] speaking the word of God over you. I
[1:46:10] speak the word of God. Amen. I I've I've
[1:46:13] done it. I've done it for years and
[1:46:15] years and years, and I ain't stopping
[1:46:17] now.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; I'd go I when I pray, I pray, Amen. I
[1:46:26] call out Kobe's name, Caleb's name,
[1:46:30] Joshua's name, Michael's name, I
[1:46:33] Patrick's name. Amen. I would claim
[1:46:35] those I would claim those those boys and
[1:46:38] I just claim and and and I and I want to
[1:46:40] say I never even gave up on I I I kept
[1:46:43] on naming your name, Patrick. I did. I
[1:46:47] did.
[1:46:50] And what we're doing here today, mamas,
[1:46:52] don't you ever tire of naming those boys
[1:46:54] before God, keeping that
[1:46:57] I don't care if you're if you've got if
[1:46:59] you've got sons and daughters that are
[1:47:01] out of of fellowship with God. Maybe
[1:47:03] they're grown and they're out and away.
[1:47:05] There is an authority in the name of
[1:47:08] Jesus. And there is an authority in sons
[1:47:11] and daughters of God who know who they
[1:47:14] are.
[1:47:17] Can you say amen?
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look at Samson.
[1:47:24] What is in your hand?
[1:47:26] Samson, all he he had was the jawbone of
[1:47:28] a donkey.
[1:47:30] Amen. Samson was anointed. He was raised
[1:47:33] up, ordained of God,
[1:47:36] given a gift of power, was ordained to
[1:47:38] destroy the nations of the Philistines.
[1:47:41] He was born on the earth, anointed of
[1:47:43] God to destroy the Philistines.
[1:47:45] One day they caught him out in the field
[1:47:47] without a sword, without a spear, and a
[1:47:49] thousand of those armored Philistines
[1:47:52] run upon him. Did Did he get down and
[1:47:54] say, "Oh Lord, I'm waiting for a vision.
[1:47:57] Oh Lord, what must I do? Direct me what
[1:47:59] to do?" He knowed he had a need. He
[1:48:03] found nothing but an old jawbone of a
[1:48:05] mule and he beat down a thousand
[1:48:07] Philistines.
[1:48:09] Amen. He never cried to God. He used his
[1:48:12] anointed gift. He knowed that he was
[1:48:15] sent for the job. He knew he was born
[1:48:18] for that. He know he was anointed with a
[1:48:21] gift and he beat down a thousand
[1:48:23] Philistines.
[1:48:24] Didn't cry to God. God ordained him and
[1:48:27] vindicated that he was the one by by the
[1:48:29] others that he had done. No matter what
[1:48:32] the circumstance was, he did it. Well,
[1:48:34] someone shout hallelujah.
[1:48:37] Hallelujah. Don't ask questions.
[1:48:41] Don't ask questions. Just believe that
[1:48:44] God has called you.
[1:48:46] That's the perspective.
[1:48:51] As the musicians prepare to come,
[1:49:00] notice God making himself known.
[1:49:05] Not that we're supposed to make converts
[1:49:07] to Christianity by a government,
[1:49:10] but by the revelation, the Christ in
[1:49:13] you. As God was in Christ,
[1:49:17] as God was in Christ, it is Christ in
[1:49:20] you. Someone shout yes.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; When God, what God done in Christ,
[1:49:27] Christ does in you. What signs God done
[1:49:30] in Christ, Christ does in you. I mean,
[1:49:34] this is this we're going we're going to
[1:49:36] drive this home. Isn't that wonderful?
[1:49:40] Oh my. I like that Jesus said, "At that
[1:49:43] day, that's this day. At that day, when
[1:49:46] this revelation is made known, you will
[1:49:49] know that I'm in the Father, the Father
[1:49:51] in me, I in you, you in me." And when
[1:49:55] the revelation is made manifest at that
[1:49:58] day,
[1:50:00] you will know
[1:50:08] Faith doesn't try. Faith knows.
[1:50:15] When you pray, don't don't try to
[1:50:17] convince God.
[1:50:19] Say, "Lord, give me a revelation. Give
[1:50:21] me a perspective like I've never had.
[1:50:26] I want to see you in a different light.
[1:50:29] I want you to be my Lord.
[1:50:32] And I want you to shine your light upon
[1:50:35] me
[1:50:37] because I belong to a different kingdom
[1:50:39] now. Not the kingdom of sin and death,
[1:50:44] but the kingdom of righteousness,
[1:50:46] the kingdom of faith,
[1:50:49] the kingdom of authority.
[1:50:54] Tradition will keep me bound.
[1:50:57] There is no power in tradition.
[1:51:01] You can go through all the formalities
[1:51:03] of church tradition all you want and
[1:51:05] you'll be just as powerless.

[1:51:13] But if you'll understand that you're a
[1:51:15] son and daughter of God,
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:23] that he's anointed you in this house,
[1:51:27] that your prayers do matter,
[1:51:34] that you can pray over your children,
[1:51:37] and those prayers
[1:51:39] are an absolute
[1:51:42] The Bible says,
[1:51:45] The Bible says
[1:51:49] that David that the jailer
[1:51:53] when when when Paul and Silas was in
[1:51:56] jail and they prayed and
[1:51:59] prison shook because the power of God
[1:52:05] and and all the shackles were were
[1:52:07] loosed and the jailer was fixing to take
[1:52:10] his life. And he says, "Oh, sir, don't
[1:52:11] do that." He says, "We're all still
[1:52:13] here."
[1:52:18] He says, "But this is the power of Jesus
[1:52:20] in us."
[1:52:22] And the jailer says, "I want this
[1:52:24] Christ."
[1:52:26] And what did he say?
[1:52:29] He said, "Believe
[1:52:32] upon Jesus Christ and you and your
[1:52:36] household
[1:52:38] shall be saved.
[1:52:42] Now we know that his household has to
[1:52:44] accept Christ there. God has no
[1:52:45] grandchildren.
[1:52:47] You have to come to God has no
[1:52:49] grandchildren. He just has sons and
[1:52:51] daughters.
[1:52:54] Your children have to accept Jesus
[1:52:55] Christ too.
[1:53:01] But the faith,
[1:53:03] the faith and the words
[1:53:07] of that jailer when he accepted Jesus
[1:53:10] Christ, the prophet would put it this
[1:53:11] way. He said, "The faith that you used
[1:53:13] for your own salvation, use that same
[1:53:16] faith for your children
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; and it will bring them to."
[1:53:22] There is a power that is within you
[1:53:25] through that new birth,
[1:53:27] man.
[1:53:29] We ain't wannab bees. We're children of
[1:53:31] God.
[1:53:33] Faith has placed us there.
[1:53:36] God will bring those things.
[1:53:39] Do you love him?
[1:53:47] I said, "Well, I don't want to ask too
[1:53:49] big of a thing. I I I don't want to,
[1:53:51] brother. I I don't know, man. This is
[1:53:53] just too big." There is nothing too big.
[1:53:57] There is nothing too great.
[1:54:01] There is nothing too powerful.
[1:54:09] You can't ask him enough. You can't ask
[1:54:10] him too many times. You can't I'm saying
[1:54:12] the perspective. Are you all me
[1:54:15] perspective?
[1:54:21] Lord, give me a vision of heaven. Give
[1:54:23] me a vision of Christ.
[1:54:25] Amen.
