And uh [applause] I'd um uh as as he gets, you know, gets his when he whenever you get your voice a little bit, we want you to speak for at least 15 20 minutes. &gt;&gt; And uh a preacher is always a preacher.

Uh just you know him. Any service that he can be at, he's going to be at. And and I'm so glad that that you've been having strength enough to get out and around. And and um I'm still believing this Parkinson's is is gone. It's it's it's it's finished. [applause] Amen. Believing the Lord for that, you know. And so we're thankful to that. Let's look in here at Genesis 1 and um we're going to start at the second verse. And the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. [snorts] Father, we want to thank you today. Thank you, Lord, for these wonderful songs that we have heard and your presence that we have felt. And Lord Jesus, we're asking that you would minister to our hearts here tonight. Lord, we've got two young men, Lord, is coming up in life and going to be making decisions and got their life ahead of them, Father. And Lord, they've they've made some decisions to serve you. And Lord, we're we're thankful for that. And Lord, making you, Lord, is is is so important to us. And and Lord, we're just asking that you would bless them and bless the service. bless my my words here tonight. Let me speak only as you would have in Jesus name we pray. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated. [clears throat] We um I want to deal with with this for a few moments and how God is good at turning chaos into order. He's so good at making things, lining things up in our lives. And um thinking about this um tonight uh as baptism here this evening and and I I thought of in the beginning God had brought a great transformation and he he did he truly did bring order out of chaos &gt;&gt; and he took amen the nothingness the Bible says the world as we just read the earth was without form and void and dark and Amen. And it was it was a a a place that was not inhabitable. There was there was nothing of it. But yet God seen beauty in the He seen beauty in his mind. He had a masterpiece in his mind. He had he had thoughts about this world and what this world was could be, what it what it would be, what it could be, what what it was and what it could be. Looking there at the at the void, the the the brokenness, if you will. &gt;&gt; Amen. God had a dream. In this dream, a man would have trees on earth with trees and flowers and there would be animals. There would be mountains and rivers and there would be a man in his mind. God, this great architect God while looking at the void, looking at the chaos, he is looking at at a dream that he had to make something beautiful of this this great big ball called earth. &gt;&gt; And as God began to bring light, the very first thing that God done is God God said, "Let there be light." He began, Amen. with this light. This light began to uh draw back the the the water and it amen. And I think that's the one of the once that's the first thing that God does for you and me is he he brings light to our situation. &gt;&gt; Light is not just a Amen. It's it's not just light for the natural light. We you you you turn the lights on and then Amen. Then you can clearly see where you're at. You can clearly see uh the things all around you. Amen. But there's also a light that comes on in our heart where God begins to let us know who we are, &gt;&gt; what we are, &gt;&gt; and the purpose that he has for our lives. And I I think of the power of God's word, how that it'll always bring transformation. When God said, "Let there be light." the Bible the very next words and there was light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When God speaks, when God comes on the scene and God begins to speak, he's got a purpose for that. And when we come to the Lord, when God begins to deal with our lives and his Holy Spirit begins to knock at our door, it is God that is essentially speaking to our lives, speaking into our hearts and saying, "Let there BE LIGHT." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD'S got a dream for every one of us. He's got I believe he's got a dream for for the Bible says that you were forever more in his in his mind that you were in his thoughts before the foundation of the world. These two young men that that have given their lives to the Lord is going to get baptized tonight. God knows exactly God's known you since you were a a a baby. God knows God knows your entire life. God God knows exactly where you were and what you WILL BE. GOD'S GOT a dream. And I I want us TO ALWAYS REMEMBER JUST AS GOD had this dream, Amen, for planet Earth. And the Bible says in six days he had done a total transformation. He had taken the nothingness. He had taken the brokenness. He had taken the chaos and the emptiness and God began to mold and build and and on the first day he brought light and then he begin to bring the botany life and the flowers and the seeds begin to grow in the sunlight. In the sunlight transformation begins to transpire. Amen. The seeds begin to come up. Before you know it, we had birds flying and we had animals coming up and Amen. On the sixth day, the Bible says that God created man himself. &gt;&gt; And he created man in his very own image, in the image of God created he them, MALE AND FEMALE. &gt;&gt; SO GOD IN HIS DREAM, HE DIDN'T JUST STOP THERE. AMEN. with the first day or the second day or the third day. And I want to say this is very important because when we give our life to the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. And when God does something to our lives, remember he it's a continual work. God is working in our lives. And as long as there is light and we stay in the light of God's word, he will transform us. Amen. I can say it's been a metamorphice for me. Amen. I gave my heart to the Lord when I was a a young man. And God has has progressively led me, Amen, through uh uh situations to a higher level. And he's still transforming my life even tonight. Amen. As I'm getting older and and and my my um shoulders are becoming more stooped and getting bald, Amen. I rest in the fact that my hand my life is in the hands of God. &gt;&gt; AND AND SO BUT I GO BACK FOR JUST A MOMENT AS GOD HAD CREATED, AMEN. this this great paradise and he took man and his wife and he put them in the garden. It was pristine. It was in the garden of Eden. There was Amen. It was beautiful. It was perfection. Amen. They walked with God in the cool of the evening. There was there was no fear. There was no condemnation. There was no jealousy. There was no abandonment. There there was nothing there. They were loved by their father. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they loved their father. It was A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAPA God and Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; But it didn't last very long. We find that after a while, Amen. Uh uh Satan began to to to uh he came lurking and and I I love the way brother Brandham would put it. And as he says, what a beautiful place God was so satisfied till he just went back and rested from all of his works. Every tree never brought forth thorns and thistles. No berries ever came off of a thorn tree. Everything was perfect. All seeds were perfect. Everything was in perfect condition. And then he went to take a little rest. And his enemy slipped in with deceit and took it over by misinterpreting his program to his children. when he put trust in his own child as you would put trust in your daughter when she goes out at night with a man or when when you put your trust in your son when he has to go with a boy that is drinking or smoking. You see, he put trust in his son that he would not do anything wrong and would keep every word that he said. But the enemy slipped in and like that greasy slicker that would take out your daughter and misbehave himself or some woman would would go out with your son and the same thing. See, he slipped in and the enemy of God slipped in and misinterpreted the word to Eve. Now he by this fall, it has took over and possessed the Garden of Eden himself. He took it over and now he's had 6,000 years of deceitful rule, deceiving the people, God's children, as he did then because they were based on the free moral agency to act any way they wish. They Amen. in believing that they would act right or trusting that they would act right. Then they've come in with the wrong act and sold their birthrights as Esau did for the world. And Satan wanted, he took it OVER AND HE'S HAD 6,000 YEARS TO BUILD UP his Eden as God had 6,000 years to to bring his Eden to a close and by deceit of the word or of the people now established his own Eden on earth in sin. Now, so he here this picture is painted. GOD HAD MADE THIS BEAUTIFUL something and then Satan come in and by deception brought in sin. &gt;&gt; Did you know that Adam and Eve would have never had to die? There was never no sickness. &gt;&gt; There was never no there there was never no waking up on a on the wrong side of the bed. Hallelujah. There there was never any of these things. There there was no such things as addictions. There was no such things as as as children being uh uh left to raise themselves or there was there was it was all beautiful. It was all perfect. But Satan brought sin. And the scripture says the wages of sin is death. So when you when you go to buy sin, you're going to pay it by death. &gt;&gt; Amen. the the wages OF SIN. AND NOW every man and woman, boy and girl, we are all born, we're all born under condemnation. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're born in h shaped in iniquity. We're born under the condemnation. And every one of us as we grow up, I don't care whether you're born and and and raised in a rich family or whether you are you you were uh raised in a poor family. We we are all WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED WHAT IT feels to be condemned. &gt;&gt; Condemnation is is is THERE THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN GET OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; All right. NOW THIS DRUG SITUATION THAT that we have and I say it's an epidemic that is in our land today that there are so many men and women who are who are good people good people but they are but they are trapped by drugs and alcohol &gt;&gt; AND AND WHAT WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THIS IS YOU ARE UNDER THE CONDEMNATION OF DEATH. EVERY ONE OF US ARE UNDER THAT CONDEMNATION of death. &gt;&gt; SINCE ADAM AND EVE, SINCE THE FALL, ADAM SOWED US ALL INTO THIS. AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO GET OUT OF IT, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY TO GET out of this death. Amen. The wages of sin is death. I don't care how pretty and how good-looking you young people are today. Amen. You're going to end up looking like me sooner or later. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE YOUNG AND YOU'RE HANDSOME AND YOU'RE PRETTY and Amen. BUT BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GET old and you're going to die. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That and and that's and and the reason for this is because of what took place in the beginning. Can you say amen? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to say amen. SCARS SCARS are are very real on the human spirit. SCARS. WE WE'VE GOT SCARS THAT WE WERE THAT WE HAVE CARRIED FROM BIRTH. Maybe maybe uh uh maybe it was molested as a child or m maybe maybe it was abandonment uh uh from a a father or a mother and and and what seems to be uh UH SIMPLE TO THE WORLD BECAUSE everyone is the world is full of chaos. Can you say amen to that? The world is FULL OF CHAOS. BUT BEHIND THE SMILES, BEHIND THE MAKEUP, BEHIND THE CAREERS, BEHIND ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE SCARRED human beings. &gt;&gt; They're scarred. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hurts. Hurts because of mama done something. Hurts because of something that transpired on the playground. HURTS. AND WE CARRY THOSE HURTS. AMEN. And we AND OUR AND OUR SPIRITS are are are are not made to CARRY THAT. &gt;&gt; OUR HEARTS ARE NOT MADE TO TO TO FEEL THAT ANGUISH. &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T CREATE US FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why there are so many Hollywood actors and actresses. Amen. And I mean they've got the money. They've got the money. Amen. to puff up their their lips and their cheeks and their breast and behinds, whatever they got. I mean, they can do whatever they want to do to make themselves look pretty and they still can't find peace. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; They still CAN'T FIND PEACE. THEY'VE GOT ALL OF THIS MONEY. THEY'VE HAD ALL OF THIS THEY THEY'VE HAD ALL OF THIS COSMETIC STUFF DONE AND THEY'RE still on drugs. THEY'RE STILL ON ALCOHOL. SO IT SHOWS MONEY DOES NOT GIVE you peace. &gt;&gt; I was telling a young lady the other day, OH YOU COULD HAVE THE PRETTIEST OF HOUSE AND YOU COULD HAVE THE your your husband could be Mr. PERFECT AND YOUR CHILDREN COULD BE but if you don't have Christ &gt;&gt; you see you humanity HUMANITY WHEN WE FAIL FROM THAT POSITION WITH GOD WE have been under the guilt of condemnation &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; amen so we all walk until we find Christ we all walk I don't care whether you're a child there's that little something down in your heart, that little ug down in your heart. And as you grow older, it gets more of a bigger ug. It's it's it's you're not satisfied. You're not you're not where you're supposed to be. Well, PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, &gt;&gt; AMEN. SCARS ARE ARE ARE ARE ARE SOMETHING THAT CAN BE A BENEFIT TO US when we start looking for someone who can help heal THE SCARS. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE START LOOKING FOR SOMEONE that says, "I'll love you and I'll never forsake you." ONE THAT SAYS, "I'VE GOT YOUR BEST INTEREST." Sometimes parents don't always have the best interest of the children. you know, they've got their own way that they're doing and their own thing going on and and a child is just one of those things that's just lugging along. Amen. While they're going through their uh life experience, but I just want to tell you, there is not one of us that ARE NOT LOVED BY GOD. [applause] &gt;&gt; AND GOD'S LOVE FOR YOU, GOD'S [screaming] LOVE FOR YOU IS GREATER THAN his love for himself. HIS LOVE FOR YOU WAS SO DIVINE THAT WHEN HE LOOKED DOWN upon this earth and he seen that his he seen that his uh UH SON AND DAUGHTER WAS WAS FALLEN AND HE AND HE LOOKED THERE WITH WITH WITH WITH GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AND HE PRONOUNCES THE JUDGMENT. I'M DONE GIVING YOU MY WORD. THE day that you sin, you shall surely die. Amen. And we understand that a thousand years is as one day with God. &gt;&gt; But he turned around to Adam and Eve as he's as he's Amen. kicking them out of the Garden of Eden because of the sin and he pronounces the judgment upon them. Hallelujah. God stops and he says, "Wait, wait. I can just see Adam and Eve. I can see Adam and Eve as THEY'RE CRYING." AMEN. NOW THEY THEY'VE BEEN CLOTHED BY uh they they they you know, there they are neck. There they are in regrets and AND AND GET GOD. [screaming] GOD COMES CHASING ADAM AND EVE AND SAYING, "WAIT, WAIT, WAIT." AMEN. And he slays a lamb and he takes the the the the skins of the lamb and he clothe them with it. Amen. Great love for him saying, "I will redeem you. &gt;&gt; I will redeem you." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's good. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You see? Amen. Since the fall, man has had the inability to really commune with God. Yes, Christianity is um is is has always been a pretty big deal here in the United States. &gt;&gt; Amen. Although it's been dwindling down over the years. Amen. We're not a Christian nation anymore. And and it's and it's been because Amen. GOD IS JUST A FIGMENT OF OUR IMAGINATION. We come to church once a month. We come and sing our song. We go home. Amen. We're still going to be under the influence of a broken heart. &gt;&gt; We're still under the influence of condemnation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we try to satisfy that that that brokenness with drugs or sex or alcohol. Amen. Today it's an all-time high where where boys and girls are shacking up outside of the marriage covenant with no covenant at all where where you know I can leave you any time and you can leave me any time and everything about the structure of humanity today as is is there is no eternal connection &gt;&gt; there there is no commitment TO ONE ANOTHER. MAMAS DON'T WANT TO BE COMMITTED to their children. Children don't want to be committed to THEIR MAMAS. AMEN. SPOUSES DON'T WANT TO BE COMMITTED TO ONE ANOTHER. WE'VE LOST CONTENTMENT OR WE HAVE WE HAVE LOST WHAT IT WHAT IT IS TO BE COMMITTED TO ONE ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IS [screaming] SAYING EVEN IN THIS DARK HOUR, I'M very real and I want to be committed to you. [applause] &gt;&gt; I want to be committed to you. Mama might have failed you. Daddy might have failed your brother might have failed you. Spouses might have failed you. Bosses might have failed you. Amen. Your your your friends at school MIGHT HAVE FAILED YOU. BUT GOD WILL NOT FAIL YOU. &gt;&gt; God cannot fail you. God's desire is to bring Hallelujah. is to bring order, beauty back into chaos, out of chaos. HE WANTS TO take our chaos, our brokenness, and he wants to make something beautiful within it. Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him here this morning or this evening? &gt;&gt; You see, there's no way for you to ever pick yourselves up by your own bootstraps. There's no way, Amen. to to uh uh fix yourselves. And what ends up happening is brokenness is passed from generation to generation. &gt;&gt; Brokenness then goes from mama to daughter. Amen. And that daughter to their daughter and that daughter to their daughter. In fact, if you look there at the statistics and you you look there, Amen. you will find that brokenness does not just happen. Brokenness is passed down. PASSED DOWN GENERATION after generation after generation. It's a generational curse. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; GENERATIONAL CURSES THAT HAS GO ON. AMEN. GREATGRANDFATHER TO GRANDFATHER TO SON. AMEN. OR TO FATHER TO SON. AND IT'S PASSED ALL [screaming] THE WAY ON DOWN. &gt;&gt; IF WE DON'T FIX THE PROBLEM, and I want to say this is what makes it so nice. Amen. to be able to baptize these young men today because somebody's making a conscience decision. When you're coming to Christ, you're making a conscious decision THAT I'VE GOT A SIN PROBLEM. I'VE GOT A SITUATION THAT I NEED. I'M BROKEN. AND I WANT TO SAY, YOU SAY, "WELL, WELL, WELL, MAYBE I'M I'M NOT BROKEN." AMEN. YOU WILL NEVER BE SAVED AND YOU WILL NEVER BE TRANSFORMED UNTIL YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ARE BROKEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD PREACHER. GOD CAN'T SAVE ANYBODY UNTIL THEY REALIZE THEY NEED TO BE SAVED. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you're rich. I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU'RE POOR. WE ALL [screaming] CAME TO EARTH BROKEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And only Jesus, it was God. It was God who came when God couldn't find any human being to redeem. God couldn't find anyone to listen. Listen. Adam was created by God. Eve came out of Adam. They were kicked out of the garden after the sin and their very first son killed the other son. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Murders were already taking place. And then we can find it throughout the scripture. All right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But we needed someone who could stand and say, "I'm good. I'm good at taking brokenness &gt;&gt; and bringing it back into order." &gt;&gt; God done it at the beginning and God can DO IT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; IN FACT, I'M A WITNESS OF THAT. WE HAVE GOT WITNESSES HERE. &gt;&gt; THIS CHURCH HAS WITNESSES. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. OF MEN WHO WERE ABSOLUTELY BROKEN, &gt;&gt; ADDICTED TO DRUGS, ADDICT HEROIN ADDICTS, AMEN, FOR 20, 30 YEARS. WRAP SHEETS AS AMEN. AS LONG AS YOU COULD you could see and all of that. AND YET [screaming] GOD COULD TELL COME IN AND BRING chaos into order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Merl, I I look at you, if you don't mind me picking on you, I pick on him all the time. Amen. Well, Amen. A father being married four or five times and not not him being married four or five times, his father married four or five times. He knows what it is to be rose in in brokenness. Seeing a lot of things that happen as a young man. I think of sister Leah being raised as in brokenness, daddy taken off, leaving her. When she was a girl, she seen a lot of this ups and downs. When she got married, she couldn't even stand the thought of brother Merl being gone. Brother Merl had to call her all the time because she was afraid that he wasn't coming home. Sister Leah's witnesses that the brokenness was so bad until she she felt she she she had a hard time with trust. But then you look and it took two young people. They were young when they got married. Two young people THAT CHOSE TO DO IT GOD'S WAY. &gt;&gt; And though THE BROKENNESS IS GOES DOWN BOTH HISTORY, THE BOTH BOTH UH SIDES OF THE FAMILY'S HISTORY, WE'VE GOT NOW [screaming] A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN MARRIED FOR how many years? &gt;&gt; 41. &gt;&gt; 41 years. And what what Amen. I'm not I'm not going to ask about the anniversary of the engagement. Hallelujah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It it brokenness and here we are 41 years now. It took someone to look ahead and say, "God, I'm a kid. I'm a kid." You're still a kid when you're 20 years old. I mean, when you get as old as we are, you're still a kid. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, here I am. I've not I don't know exactly where I'm going, but I'm going to place my life in your hands. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, nothing to do with with with with the Amen. Brothers and and sisters, experiencing all brokenness in in their relationships, and it's and it's continued to go on. But here's two people out of broken families who have stood the test and said, "I'm going to do what it takes to raise my family the right way in the will of God according to the word of God." Praise the Lord. And now you've got grandchildren today that are serving the Lord. It to what it took, it took somebody to stand up and say, "I'm going to break this curse. &gt;&gt; I'm going to break this curse. CAN YOU SAY &gt;&gt; AMEN? &gt;&gt; MY WIFE w was raised uh in in brokenness. Her mother was never married. Had all kinds of men. Amen. It was it was it was nothing. SHE THERE WAS DRUG DEALS GOING ON AROUND HER HOUSE ALL THE TIME. She her her her brother was at that time w was the was the the head was HAD THE BIGGEST DRUG THING in in the state of Oklahoma going on. Matter of fact, they got busted right after we got married. Amen. They they had THOSE THINGS GOING ON. ALCOHOL, SEX, JUNK, ALL ALL AROUND. BUT MY WIFE AT THE AGE OF 14 YEARS OLD CAME UP TO AN ALTAR, GAVE HER LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST, AND SAID, "I'M GOING TO START A NEW WAY." [applause] Of course, her twin sister didn't understand that. Made fun of her. Amen. And and she's went her direction AND AND AND SINCE THAT TIME, SHE'S GIVEN HER HEART TO THE LORD. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S told me? Her twin has told me, "If I would have made the same commitment that Fresca made when we were girls, I it would have saved me all of this broken relationships." &gt;&gt; What am I saying? Christianity is not a feel-good thing. CHRISTIANITY IS GOD COMING IN AND SATISFYING. AMEN. THE BROKENNESS IN HER HEART. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE THAT CAN GIVE YOU PEACE, AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE A BROKEN RELATIONSHIP WITH. &gt;&gt; You think you've got a broken relationship with your mama. You think you've got a broken relationship uh uh uh with your with, YOU KNOW, WITH YOUR DAUGHTER OR YOUR SON. YOUR BROKEN RELATIONSHIP IS WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; COME ON. IF WE FIX THAT RELATIONSHIP, [screaming] &gt;&gt; if we fix AND GET CONNECTED BECAUSE YOU WERE CREATED IN HIS IMAGE, YOU WERE CREATED FOR A DIVINE PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; And when we come back together with God, &gt;&gt; the Bible, Jesus put it this way, with God all things are possible. Another place he said, "He that believes all things are the God that can do the impossible, connecting with you as his son, his daughter. You can do things that are impossible because you have come back to your origin." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. And we have found ourselves in that in in that deformed state. We're still sons. You always were a son. &gt;&gt; You always were a son, but you had to realize who you were. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Have you ever thought about God, the power of love to create a body, move into that body to redeem you back? &gt;&gt; The great invisible God. There was no one here on the earth that could ever redeem any of us. &gt;&gt; NO ONE. NO ONE COULD REDEEM US. WE WERE ALL SINNERS. NO ONE. BUT YET THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD OR THE LAW [screaming] OF GOD SAID IT HAD TO BE A KINSMAN THAT REDEEMED. It was going to take a a a a man to redeem man. So God created a blood cell in the body of a virgin. I'm fixing to close &gt;&gt; in the body of a virgin. And that virgin who knew not a man, but the seed of God was placed in her womb, she produced this baby, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God moved into that body. God himself moved into the body of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that he could redeem you, Theo. so that he could bring you back. I know our relationships here on earth can be broken and we and they and it is and it is tough. I've it is tough when you're when you're estranged from a from a a husband or a wife or you're something's happened and you re friends are at odds but there's nothing any greater than to being at odds with your heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; But you think that you've got something missing in your heart. God had something missing in his heart because he created you for divine purpose. And it's not for drugs. It's not for alcohol. It's for a for you to prosper in this life, to live a life of righteousness to where you can have peace. Well, come on now. For you girls to be able to be married. Amen. And knowing that your that that your husband is not cheating on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I I I TELL YOU WHAT, WALKING WITH GOD IS THE BEST THING YOU COULD EVER DO. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LORD AND A TRUST WITH GOD. God died. He didn't just he didn't just live here on earth the perfect man and he was but he didn't just live on this earth go around healing people raising the dead so that we could all say wow wow so that we could sing a song about him in a church service. What? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't come for us to sing in church. Come on. &gt;&gt; JESUS DIDN'T COME FOR US TO PUT OUR name on a pew or on on the church book. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T COME FOR US TO SHAKE THE PREACHER'S HAND AND THEN BE AND OUR HEART still be broken and hurt. Jesus come &gt;&gt; to fix that little problem in the heart, that condemnation, to take the guilt away &gt;&gt; and to restore relationship back with man. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's good. Now, when Jesus went to Calvary, he took your place, Theo. I don't care if you had never sinned a day in your life. You're born guilty. You're born a sinner. And you would have to go to hell. But God looked down and said, "That's my son." Glory to God. So Jesus come to pay the price of your sin, of your guilt. We were all born. It's just the way it is. Adam sold us all into sin. And the only way to get back out is to have a brand new birth. And the only way to have a new birth was for for for the the the the condemnation TO BE STRUCK OUT TO TO TO STRIKE IT CLEAN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Did you know that when Jesus died for your sin and he went to hell, he took your sins to hell, that you can know when you accept Jesus Christ into your heart and you've accepted his plan for your life, there is no more sin held against you. Right? [applause] &gt;&gt; You can be a murderer one minute and be totally redeemed by God the next. You say, "Well, everyone but murderers." God's blood is big enough for no matter what you've ever done. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God's blood is big enough. It's powerful enough for every one of you. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I he paid the price to bring us to himself. Bring us to himself. The power of the blood. You are when we talk about nothing but the blood. Nothing but the blood of Jesus. What can wash away our sins? Nothing but the blood of Jesus. Jesus gave his life. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It could no longer be done. I I I heard the story one time of a judge and the judge, his son got in trouble and um he was speeding and he he he he outrun a policeman and he was and he got he got caught and so he come now he's standing before his own father and he was sure hoping his dad would give him mercy but His dad passed the penalty of the law to him, pronounced him guilty, dropped the gavl and said, "You're guilty." There the son was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Broken and father was broken, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then he took off his robe. &gt;&gt; Came out from behind the judge's chamber and came around to the front. went up there to the went up to the court clerk or or the clerk there, paid the fine &gt;&gt; and they both walked out, father and son. I'm sure he got his talking to and got a good got got hallelujah. I don't know what happened once he got home, but the law was satisfied. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? All right. &gt;&gt; And I just want to tell you that's what God has done for us. God dropped the punishment. God God dropped the gavvel and he says you sin. The wages of sin is death. And God was not going to turn that around. But God himself become a man &gt;&gt; paid the penalty &gt;&gt; so that you and I could go free. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, the scripture says there in Hebrews 2 and 14, if y'all a little bit hot, y'all can turn that turn that AC on a little bit if if you guys are hot. For I see some fanning. For as much as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes uh subject to bondage. Verily he Jesus took not on the form or on the nature of angels, but he took on the seed of Abraham. Or he took on the form of a man. Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. Revelations 1 and5. and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead, the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that has loved and washed or him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood has made us kings and priests unto God our father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 5:9, much more THAN NOW BEING JUSTIFIED BY HIS BLOOD, WE SHALL be saved from wrath through him. Ephesians 2:13, but now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were a far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. there in Colossians 1:20, having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things to him to himself by him I say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you somebody say me &gt;&gt; THAT WERE SOMETIME alienated and enemies in your mind by your wicked works yet now has he reconciled in THE BODY OF HIS FLESH through death to present you holy, unblameable, unreprovable in his sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 5:1. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God. &gt;&gt; Peace. What is peace? The world's looking for peace. They can't seem to find peace. The reason why they can't find the peace is because only God can give that peace. &gt;&gt; We're all thirsting for something. &gt;&gt; You've got that craving. God's built you with that craving. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And the only way you can feel that craving is with Jesus Christ. I want to say here tonight, we're going to be baptizing two brothers that have given their heart to the Lord. And if there's anyone else here that wants to be give their heart to the Lord, I'm not talking about coming up shaking a preacher's hand and making a new commitment. I'm talking about coming and letting God change that heart and give you something that no preacher, no church, nothing else can give you. and you want to accept that and be baptized. Well, we'll just baptize a whole bunch of you tonight if you wanted to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Buried. Why are we baptized in the name of Jesus? There in Acts two, Acts 2 and and uh 238. Amen. Let me get it get it to you here. after the day of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost when they had they had been received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. That this they said um uh the 37th verse. And when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do? And Peter said unto them,"Repent and be baptized, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and you shall receive the Holy Ghost, the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, to your children and all of those down in 19 or 2025." &gt;&gt; Amen. A far off as many as the Lord our God should call. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? SO WHEN WE HAVE REPENTED WHAT DOES THE WORD REPENT that means we are we are not just using RELIGION AS A CRUTCH. &gt;&gt; ALL right &gt;&gt; religion is not a crutch. Religion is WHAT IS OR SALVATION IS WHAT IS REQUIRED TO FILL THE GAP &gt;&gt; TO FILL THE VOID. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Repent. I'm wrong. I've been doing wrong. I've not done things. I know my conscience tells me that I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; I need this guilt taken care of. &gt;&gt; And we turn away from it and we come to Calvary and say, "Jesus, help me. Help me." You boys aren't just saving your lives today. You're not just giving your hearts to Christ today, but you are turning things around for your generation in your lineage. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRIVE THIS STATE and say, "I &gt;&gt; whether you be an urban or WHETHER YOU BE A WADE, [screaming] I AM GOING TO STAND TODAY AND GOD'S GOING TO GIVE ME A FAMILY. I'M GOING TO RAISE THEM IN THE FEAR OF THE LORD. I'M GOING TO DO WHAT [screaming] GOD HAS CALLED ME TO DO. SATAN, YOU'VE LOST YOUR HOLD. [applause] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE LOST [screaming] YOUR HOLD. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; When God turns lives around, it's beautiful. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to see young men that come and say, "I'm going to take this thing seriously. I'm going to take this thing seriously." He's a serious God. And he means serious business. And when he says you're no longer guilty, when God says you're justified by his blood, you can take that to the bank, BABY, BECAUSE GOD DOES not lie. And God DOES NOT PLAY AROUND when it comes to your salvation &gt;&gt; and your justification. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "This peace I leave you, and my peace I give unto you, not as the world gives," that's what I'm giving you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want us to as we look here tonight baptized in the name of Jesus. I want to look at one more scripture here in Romans the sixth chapter and then we will move on. Romans 6 and 1. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? Now, that's that's the that's the way Christians are today. It don't matter. Hey, I can still go out with these girls and have sex and do all of that kind of stuff. I mean, it don't matter. It does matter. &gt;&gt; God's word says it's wrong. &gt;&gt; It does matter. Well, it don't matter if I It don't matter what whether I'm high or whether I'm drunk or It does matter. That's right. &gt;&gt; Shall we sin because we've accepted Christ? And then the Apostle Paul brings it to it. God forbid. How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein? Know ye not that so many of us AS WERE BAPTIZED INTO JESUS CHRIST WERE BAPTIZED into his death? Therefore, we are buried WITH HIM BY BAPTISM INTO DEATH, THAT LIKE AS CHRIST WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD BY THE GLORY of the father, even so we should walk in also in newness &gt;&gt; of life. &gt;&gt; Jesus died. Jesus was buried. He carried your sins to hell. He brought you back or he God raised him from the dead in newness of life. When Jesus WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD, THAT meant God accepted his sacrifice that he did that he gave whenever he gave his life on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Now, if Jesus hadn't raised from the dead, you and I wouldn't know. We wouldn't know. Amen. A lot of lot of religions out there today and Muhammad never raised again and Buddha never raised. No one else ever was raised, but Jesus [snorts] has raised from the dead. Why is he raised? To prove to you that his his sacrifice was accepted. &gt;&gt; Did you know that you can have that assurance? You boys, you young men, you can have that same assurance that as you have died, you have laid down your life and this is going down in a watery grave. All of your sins are going to be left there and you can rise in the newness of life. The Holy Spirit can come upon you and your nature be changed, your desires changed, &gt;&gt; guilt be gone. You can be satisfied in your heart because God paid the price and he has accepted you. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He has accepted your witness. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Isn't this a wonderful evening? &gt;&gt; I I think there of Weston and what an honor it is, Weston. What a blessing it is. It's incredible night for me. We've prayed for you, buddy. And we appreciate your family there that has taken you in and been a family to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we commend y'all for that. And we say, God bless y'all. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want to tell you, our God doesn't want to be an invisible, something way out there that we can't reach, Weston. God wants a relationship with you, buddy. And I know you've had brokenness. And I know and I don't want to bring in a lot of I don't want to turn this service into a crying service, but your mama being gone and I know it it's hurt. But what you're doing connecting with God, that is a that is one that'll never leave you. He'll never forsake you. He cannot die. He's risen forever more. &gt;&gt; And he'll prove himself to be alive to you, Weston. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we all love you. I know if I love you, how much more does God love you? How about it, family? If you all love him, how much more does God love him? [applause] That's right. If the musicians would come as we get ready to [snorts] go into this uh go into the pool to be baptized. I wanted to really bring it to uh I I I I wanted you young men to really understand what what's what's taken place here in the few minutes that I have spoken. I I I want to tell you there is nothing like the power of God's transformation. He'll transform our lives and turn our lives from brokenness into great beauty. &gt;&gt; That's right. My dad was in a place one time in a and there was there was this this artist that was talking as he was teaching and he was a teacher and he was an artist and and he was a beautiful artist and he was he was drawing. He says, "Your life [music] when you were born, you were like this." And oh my. And as he was talking, he was talking about the serenity and the beauty and the And dad says, "This big old painting right there before hundreds of people. It was the most beautiful the most beautiful garden. Had a beautiful little oasis. AND AS THE MAN IS talking then and he's not and I believe he was using chalk. Was he using chalk? It wasn't painting. It was a chalk. And all of a sudden he took a brown piece of chalk. [music] And he went from the top to the bottom. Three different Mars all the way down. And the whole the whole group just [sighs and gasps] he wrote the picture. He says, "And then this is your life." [snorts] Something comes in and it mars it. It scars it. And sometimes you think, "Will my will my picture ever be beautiful again? Can my picture ever be of worth?" And the man just kept right on a painting.

And dad says, "Right there before their eyes, he took those scars and made three of the most beautiful palm trees." And as he [music] worked, the artist worked. And if it wasn't for the palm trees and the beautiful oasis and the and the beauty of the mountains and he said it enhanced the p. It was pretty before, but it was never a masterpiece. until there were Mars. We're all born with innocence. But as life comes and scars happen and situations, God's wanting to say, "Listen, let me make something beautiful. Let me make something beautiful [music] tonight." He's He's not through painting in your life. HE'S NOT THROUGH PAINTING AT ALL. [snorts] I'm glad he's not through painting in my life. He's still painting. Every one of you here, he's painting a picture. And there may be some that's got some real brokenness. And you think, man, if I would have done this different, man, if I would have done that, MAN, GOD ALLOWS YOU TO find that in your humanity, you're just not all there. &gt;&gt; You're broken. Every one of us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the sooner that we can understand that, [music] that we don't make ourselves, we need him.

I I I've got a special connection with this young man. and I've watched him grow throughout his life. His mama was raised here in the church and we understand that she passed away this this last year and and which is brother Bosow's daughter, brother Michael and brother Patrick's sister. And in all of our communications, uh, all of our communications with Alba over the years, this is what she would tell me, "But what a different life for Weston." She would tell me and cry and tell me over and over, I I I want I want a a a life and let Weston start out and and she would say, "If I could just get back to Ponyie and both of us start coming to church." And here he is today giving his heart to the Lord. Came in this afternoon and said he wanted to be baptized. This is truly incredible for me. &gt;&gt; I thank God for this. [applause] I thank God for this. I have discussed today as we as we stood here at the altar him discussing some of the things in his heart and his meeting the Lord in and wanting wanting that peace in the heart. Fine young man. Fine young man. Weston, you can't get any better than Weston. Weston's a good guy. But Weston needs the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Got to have him. And so as we as we stand here today, as Jesus died and went to the grave and raised again to the glory of the father and has ascended, you are you have repented. You're bearing your sins. You're passed down here in this water. You're rising up. And the Bible says you're a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And I believe that. Now, I tell you what, put your Come all the way over here. And then put your toes Yeah. Just Nope. Oh. Yep. Just right there. Right there. Yep. And that way. And then I want you to hold on to my hand. Just like that. Yeah. And then when I tell you Yeah. No. No. You had it right. Just like that. And I won't let you. I won't leave you.

Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Brother Weston upon the repenting the confession of your sins and your belief in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

You get numb after a while. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; This young man here has has been a great inspiration to us all as he he's uh just come in and given his heart to the Lord. And life hasn't always been easy for this young man. And but what God has been doing in brother Theo's life is has been a great blessing. And we're making a public witness here before all of the people that you're choosing the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think it's the best choice you could ever make, my friend. Yes. &gt;&gt; And both of you boys, we want you to know every one of us in this congregation are always here for y'all and that we love y'all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ will never forsake you. Now, I want you to turn right here and you want to grab my hand just a second. And um do you understand everything as we have we have talked about in salvation and and what baptism is about? &gt;&gt; I do. Brother Theo, upon the confession of your sins and the belief in Jesus Christ and the accepting of that great atonement through his sacrifice, I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Take a deep breath. Hallelujah. [music and applause] Bless the Lord. Oh happy day. Hallelujah. [music] Oh happy day [music and singing] a little bit. Come on Jesus bodies that are in here.

And that is through his name that we have authority and power &gt;&gt; and that all of heaven and earth is in that name. And we're baptizing him in that precious name. I tell you what, there is nothing greater. The Bible says there's not a greater name under heaven where my men must be saved. &gt;&gt; And so we're going to baptize my brother Yep. Just like that.

It's always toasty. We got in there, and I'm going to tell you, it was absolutely chill to the bone. And, uh, she she told me I lied to her just [music] to get her into the water. Amen. But but it still wasn't as bad as what it was with Sister Carol and and a few of the others. We had to chip ice. We chipped ice to baptize them in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, I don't I don't listen, it it don't have to be all perfect. Amen.
