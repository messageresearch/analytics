Following him [music] is a very much is so much &gt;&gt; so important. [music] following him. I want to follow I want to be a follower of Jesus. [music] And I know that every one of us that are in [music] the assembly here tonight, we we all have that same desire or we wouldn't be [music] here this evening. We want to follow him. We want to [music] know him more. We want him to take our lives so that we can be like him. And I wonder here tonight if you have [music] something in your heart and you just maybe you've been battling or maybe you've been going through and you just want to say, "Lord, I want your will in my life. I I I want your will in my life. I know [music] there's a reason I'm going through my trial. There's a reason I'm facing [music] these things. And maybe we can just go to the Lord and [music] just tell him, "Father, we we do love you and we're so thankful [music] for your blessings upon us and the call upon our lives. And Lord, sometimes we [music] talk about the goodness of the Lord and the blessings of the [music] Lord and but Lord we also know that there is a Lord [music] there there is a cross and that we carry and there is a surrendering of our will to you. And father, we love you with all of our heart and we want to follow your your bloody footprints as it would. Lord, to Calvary, we want to walk where you walk. We want to die to our wills as you had to so that your spirit can [music] have preeminence in our lives. And we ask Lord that you would take us in in every situation. Maybe there may be trials coming our way and we've looked and we've wondered. We've prayed. [music] We've But Lord, maybe you're molding something within us. And if that's what you're doing, we say, "Lord, our will is [music] your will. Our desires is that your will would be performed through us and in [music] us, Lord. Now, Lord, we just ask that you would take this service tonight and that you [music] would anoint it, that you would bless it to our hearts. Lord, you speak to us, Father, as [music] we sit at your feet. Lord, as we have sung all of these songs and wanting to do your will, Father, we mean that from our heart now. We'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless you tonight. It's so good to be in the house of the Lord. Really good to see Sister Susie and and [applause] uh this young lady over here. Amen. And uh just good to good to see everyone here in the house of the Lord today. And um we're um uh so thankful for God's God's blessings. I love these this this fall weather. And u so we're we're um we're sure excited about this weekend and and uh at the fall at the fall fellowship. We're just believing for good old sunshine and some warmth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's going to be a wonderful time. Let's look here in the book of uh Matthew the 4th chapter. We've uh we're so blessed to see u uh Weston and uh Amen. We're just so glad to see him baptized the other night and that just really uh touched my heart. Touched all of our hearts actually. And so good to see you tonight, Weston. Just good to just good to see everyone here this evening. Amen. Let's look here in in Matthew 4 and 18. And Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two men, Simon Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers. And he sth unto them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." And then I'd also like to look here in Ezekiel the 22nd chapter and we'll start at the 29th verse. [snorts] We're just going to break in here. He says, "The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy. Yay, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully. And I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap for me before me for the land that I should destroy it. But I found none. I want to take a a thought here tonight. Follow thou me. And we just ask God's blessings upon the reading of the word. You can be seated here this evening. a very uh simple uh thought here tonight. We read I think the greatest gift that any of us could have. Amen. The greatest honor that any of us could have would be to hear those words follow thou me. the I believe God is still looking for people who will follow him. There are disciples and then there are there are church members, churchgoers, church attenders and um and I I would almost say that amen there are disciples and then there are Christians. Amen. Today Christian is is very loosely used but a disciple of Jesus there's only one way to be a disciple and that's to follow Jesus and the scripture says broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there will be that goes to that but he says but narrow is the gate to eternal life and Jesus says I am the way I am the truth truth and I am the life. So as we as we look today, if there's ever a time that we um we need men and women who follow the Lord and that have the that come under the anointing or the uncctioning of the Holy Spirit for this day. I believe the message of the hour and is still calling as it has in every age. follow thou me. Just as it was with Jesus, amen, there uh on the shores of Galilee. And and he would he would say he would go, Amen. to these men and follow me. If you were to read the next verse, and the Bible says they drop their nets and they followed the Lord. He would go and and and would call others and they would drop what they were doing and they would follow the Lord. There were other ones that Jesus said, "Follow thou me." And he they would say, "Well, let me go first bury my father." And he would say, &gt;&gt; "Let the dead bury the dead. &gt;&gt; Follow thou me." &gt;&gt; There would be others that would say, "I I've just had a wife and I and and I've got to," he says, "follow thou me." So there there the the the call is going forth today. We understand that there were many more who who went with Jesus that was in the attendance in the services, but there were very few that could be called the disciples of Jesus. And so I want to deal with that for a few moments tonight. Not going to hold you long, but disciples, I want to be a follower of Jesus Christ. We we understand that today the the the demon powers are greater than any other time. Brother Brandon would say that the whole world is going to go insane. Amen. And and we understand that Satan's Eden must come to maturity. And it has. Satan's Eden has come to its maturity. And we understand through the prophetic words that it must. Prophecy has already been spoke. The words have already been declared. Jesus has already foretold in the book of Revelations. We have found Amen. Even the Apostle Paul's writings perfectly depicting our day. &gt;&gt; Perfectly depicting our day. Amen. And that there would be a day of religion having a power having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof. that there would be a day, amen, of of of selfishness, amen, disobedient to parents, and it would be and he would go on down through all of those things. And we we can see that this generation is so self-indulged that that there is not even there's for the most not even a desire to see Christ anymore. Amen. They've got their own humanistic ways. They've got their own. But yet the disciples, the disciples, as the apostle Paul would say, I want to know him and the power of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; I want to know him in that power. AND IN ORDER TO FIND THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION, then there must first of all, Amen. being be a following of him into Amen. Calvary. Can you say amen? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus or Satan has his own uh uh uh you know, his own tutorship. He's got his own disciplehip program. And amen, we understand he's the ruler of darkness. He's the prince of the air. He's the he he's he's the prince of principalities. And he's got his demonic powers. Amen. And they they are very real. They are very persuasive. And they have a great zeal because they have a disciplehip program. &gt;&gt; And so Satan, amen, is using technology. He's using um everything that he can to to attract. And we understand he has three elements. Jesus gave us the prophecy. He told us that there was going to be the three areas that he is Satan is going to fight us. Amen. It's going to be through the lust of the flesh. It's going to be the lust of the eyes and it'll be the pride of life. This is where Satan is is is working. We can see it on the billboards. We can see it on the magazines. We can see it on the internet. We can see it on the on the games, on your phones, on on on TV. You you can see that Satan has got a campaign. Amen. to to uh attract you to his direction. &gt;&gt; And and I'm sure that if if any of you have have looked when Amen. any anyone that comes to Christ and and comes to the message of the hour and we can show them Revelations 10:7, we can show them Malachi 4. We can show them uh uh Luke 17:30. We can show these scriptures and we can we can we can plainly uh declare, Amen, that this has been fulfilled. The scriptures are fulfilled. And you'll watch those individuals that'll start out so happy, start out so thankful, start out, but when they when they when they get on the internet and they want to start punching in. Amen. And and and then they come back and say, "Oh, you're an occult. Oh, WE CAN'T FOLLOW THIS. OH, I don't want anything to do with this." And we say, "This is the fulfillment of scripture." &gt;&gt; Amen. and and they have to they they they turn away and they they walk away because amen of the pressure and and and the lack of of of willingness to lay it all down on the ground, lay it all down on the altar in order to be resurrected with Christ. &gt;&gt; But it's the same it's the SAME REALITY THAT YOU HAD TO HAVE WHEN JESUS WAS HERE. All right. &gt;&gt; I just want you to KNOW THAT &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS WAS ON THIS EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He wasn't a cult. &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS NOT PART OF THE RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS. &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS NOT PART OF OF OF the religious sinners. He was not a part of them all. IN FACT, THEY CALLED HIM a devil. In fact, they call him a fortune teller. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, when Jesus was was was CALLING THESE DISCIPLES, AMEN. THERE WAS GOING TO BE THERE THERE THERE WAS GOING TO BE A A A A A PRICE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. There there there WAS GOING TO BE A DECISION THAT THEY HAD TO MAKE. They had to think this through. THEY HAD TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. AMEN. What what what what they were doing because Amen. There were going to be many tests. And when Jesus says you've got to take up your cross and you've got to follow me, Amen. He meant it. Maybe they didn't uh weren't going to Calvary to be crucified that day, but they WERE GOING TO HAVE TO endure the persecution. And I just want to say, Amen. Jesus never did tell his disciples, Amen, those that he asked to be a Christian, those that he asked to follow, he never he never gave them big promises. He never told them, Amen, that you're going to make a lot of money. He never told them that you're going to, but he told them it's going to be a road of sorrow. It's going to be a road of persecution. And he says, "Unless you are willing to leave your mother and your father and your husbands and your wives and your children and you're willing to LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND, THEN YOU ARE NOT WORTHY to follow ME." AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO JESUS WOULD TELL HIM RIGHT UP FRONT, "AMEN. If you are going TO FOLLOW ME, YOU'RE GOING TO have to MAKE A DECISION TO FOLLOW ME." AMEN. Or you will not last the journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say today, it is still the same. I don't care what religion is trying to offer. &gt;&gt; We don't care uh what the Christian world has turned this religion into. I say there is A LIVING CHRIST. I say that he is worth following. &gt;&gt; I say Jesus is worth following here tonight. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand that when we Amen. we become ACCUSTOMED TO THE EVIL of the age. Amen. And sometimes we we we can we we uh uh uh the world it seems. Amen. They don't know what Christianity is. They don't. They they they think it's just coming and giving your heart to the Lord or shaking a preacher's hand or or even getting baptized and then that's that's what religion is. But religion is is is dying to yourself. Dying to what you think is right and a willingness to follow the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; A WILLINGNESS TO FOLLOW HIM and his word. But the scripture says in in in in 2 Thessalonians 2:9, it says, "Even him who's coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders with all deceivleness of unrighteousness and them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved." This is the era that we're living in. AND SATAN BEGINS TO INFLAME THOSE those senses. Amen. But I I just want to let you know there's going to be some disciples &gt;&gt; and these men and women are going to become the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I want you to know here that today you are his body. &gt;&gt; That's why you must die as he has died. Just as he had to surrender his will to the father, so must the elect surrender their will to the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We're living in this day of of of of great uh uh uh it's it's it's imprisonment, if you will. Amen. Where people are are are are totally imprisoned in THEIR SPIRITS. THEIR SOULS ARE TOTALLY LOCKED UP. AND it and it reminds me of the of the dream that Brother Brandham would have. Amen. That of of people hopelessly imprisoned behind mammoth bars. and and a woman in the prison is is pleading with brother Brown to deliver deliver us from this and said this is a house of hell. You've been misunderstood and and and you've misunderstood these people too AND THESE ARE FINE PEOPLE. And I looked over there and and and and like a great big cell or big walls. Amen. down beneath a great big cave and great iron bars eight or 10 inches thick and people out of their minds twisted arms and legs and beating their heads like that and she SHE WAS CRYING DELIVER these people brother Brandham said help us we're in trouble she herself I know her she belongs to the to the church of Christ or the Christian church called the church of the brethren and I looked around and I said I wish I could and I I go on and looking around and my little body. Them great big iron bars, those people, poor people in there, and you couldn't get to them iron bars. Uh uh you know, them iron bars was setting so close together. And I looked and they were beating their heads like they were out of their mind. And I seen some lights flickering around in there. And I looked up and there stood the Lord Jesus with the lights of rainbow around him. And he was looking right straight at me. And he said, "Deliver those people." and he went away. AND I THOUGHT, HOW COULD I DELIVER THEM? I haven't got strength enough in my arms to break those bars. So I said, HOUSE OF HELL, GIVE WAY in the name of Jesus Christ. AND HE SAID, "ALL THE CREAKING AND THE POPPING AND THE ROCKS ARE ROLLING AND THE BARS ARE FALLING and people running and screaming delivered and screaming at the top of their voice and was all delivered." And then, amen, he he he says NOW WHEN HE WAKES UP, AMEN. and he's under this great this great burden because he's understanding that Christianity that his ROLE WAS NOT JUST to be a preacher &gt;&gt; was not just to be AN EVANGELIST WAS NOT JUST TO BE THE TYPICAL BUT GOD REQUIRED FOR A TOTAL surrender of his life &gt;&gt; because he was going to represent God upon this earth. Now I want you to understand here today, God doesn't just save you, but God wants you to be a disciple. &gt;&gt; AND TO THOSE DISCIPLES, HE TURNED TO THOSE DISCIPLES AND SAID, "THE WORKS THAT I DO SHALL YOU DO ALSO." &gt;&gt; HE WOULD ALSO SAY, "AMEN." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "THE GREATEST WORKS THAT A BELIEVER COULD EVER do would BE SET THE CAPTIVES FREE. THE GREATEST MIRACLE WE COULD EVER PERFORM, AMEN, would be to give and impart eternal life to those who, Amen, who do not HAVE LIFE. &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST GIFT, THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY THAT WE COULD EVER HAVE IS FOR THE TEACHER TO LOOK BACK AT his pupil and say, "I have prepared you for this hour. &gt;&gt; I HAVE PREPARED YOU. I HAVE TAUGHT YOU. I HAVE SHOWN YOU HOW TO BOTH SURRENDER YOURSELF IN DEATH and I've also shown you how you can raise to the right hand of the father. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I say this this disciples. Amen. That God is calling for disciples today. And to me, amen. To me, there's a telltale sign of any disciple. Amen. A disciple is a learner. He's a pupil. He's he's one WHO PURPOSED US TO FOLLOW AFTER ONE WHO WALKS WITH JESUS. AMEN. A A DISCIPLE IS ONE WHO IS TAUGHT BY THE LORD. GLORY TO GOD. I I believe that every good student. Amen. THE THE THE DESIRE OF EVERY GOOD STUDENT IS IS IS TO FOLLOW THE PATTERN OF THE teacher and LEARN ABOUT THE FATHER'S business and learn it and do it just like he done it. How about it? Yes. &gt;&gt; I I I JUST I JUST NEVER I JUST NEVER SEEN JESUS COMING up to the blind and saying, "Listen, you know, it's going to be all right. After a while, I'm going to give you eternal life on the other side. Jesus came to heal the sick right now. &gt;&gt; Jesus came to impart salvation right now. Jesus came to do these. And there's not a greater honor than to THAN TO HAVE THE LORD TO CHOOSE US AND TO EMPOWER US &gt;&gt; TO [screaming] FOLLOW HIM AND WALK IN his footsteps. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? The actions of a disciple. Amen. Gives them away as where there's an apple tree. Amen. You're going to have apples everywhere. You're going to have apples in the tree. You're going to have apples. Amen. ON THE GROUND UNDER the tree, you're going TO HAVE APPLES. WHY? BECAUSE APPLES, apple trees produces apples. AND A DISCIPLE OF JESUS CHRIST HAS GOT ONE DESIRE, and that's to do the will of the Lord. &gt;&gt; To do the will of the Lord. Now, YOU LISTEN TO ME. THERE'S GOT TO BE A THERE'S GOT TO be a desire now. Amen. WHEN THERE WERE THOSE DISCIPLES THAT SAYS, I'VE GOT TO GO BURY. But there were those who had dropped their nets, dropped, and that meant that meant everything. That's how they made their living. They dropped it all. Luke, HE WAS THE PHYSICIAN. BUT WHEN JESUS CAME, AMEN, to Luke OR WHEN WHEN G AND AND AND he surrendered his his life, Amen, to to the Lord. But he was with Paul. But you you look there AT THESE OTHERS. AMEN. I BELIEVE IT WAS WHAT WAS WHAT WAS MATTHEW, wasn't he? Uh Amen. uh uh uh uh HE HE WAS SOMEBODY OF GREAT IMPORTANCE, but he WAS WILLING TO DROP IT ALL, LAY IT ALL ON THE GROUND SO THAT CHRIST COULD be glorified in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You look there at Luke. You look there at Amen at Paul or at at uh at Matthew. You look there at at at these great men. You look there at John. and and whatever they found in this Christ was exactly what they wanted. It was ex they were willing to drop everything to follow him. &gt;&gt; Brother, if you if you if you're not willing to forsake all of the world and forsake all of sin and forsake all of yourself, then you are not worthy of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; CHRISTIANITY IS NOT WHAT he can do for me. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; CHRISTIANITY is me following him. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I I I I want us to really think about that. Amen. The phrase follow me is found 20 something times in the four gospels. The Holy Ghost is Amen. IS IS CALLING OUT TO THAT ELECT. AMEN. Follow thou me. Well, praise the name of the Lord. I I I I WANT I WANT TO BE A FOLLOWER. &gt;&gt; How many wants to be a follower of Jesus? &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be a I I I want to be a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ. I want to be Amen. I I want to uh I I I want to surrender everything that I've got. &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO FOLLOW, BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY, THERE'S GOT TO BE A predestinated something on the inside of our hearts. Amen. There's got to be something. And he would talk about the deep calling to the deep. He would call he would talk about the sunlight attracting Amen. the uh uh you know the sunlight attracting the seeds in the ground and it producing the weed or the apples or it it producing amen. And that's really the way it is with Jesus Christ the word when Christ comes. Amen. There's something already on the inside of your heart and it just says amen to it. &gt;&gt; It says amen to it. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I I I WANT TO SAY JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE THE predestinated seed does not mean that everything is easy. It doesn't mean that Amen. life is a flower bed of vasees. It it means that there's going to be a Amen. a a lot of of trials and tribulations. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus even said there in Luke 20 14 and I believe 24 uh uh 14 and 24 14 and 25 maybe. Amen. and and and he he he said that, you know, he talked about the great multitudes that were that that were coming and and and he and he turned unto them and he and he said TO THEM, "IF ANY man come to me," AMEN. AND HATES NOT HIS FATHER, his mother, HIS WIFE, HIS CHILDREN, AMEN, and brethren and sisters. AND HE GOES ON DOWN THERE AND AND HE THEN HE SAYS, "And even his own life, Okay. &gt;&gt; Oh, he says you cannot be my disciple. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he says, "AND WHOSOEVER DOES NOT BEAR HIS cross come after me cannot be my disciple." Now to that that uh wonderful young lady that I told here a while back. Amen. There's only one kind of a Christian and that's a disciple. THERE'S ONLY ONE KIND OF A CHRISTIAN AND THAT'S THOSE THAT FOLLOW JESUS. Can you say amen? Now, Jesus didn't when he Amen. And and and and let me just put it this way. It doesn't mean you've got to we're all going to go shoot ourselves or we're all going to go die physically, but that does mean that we have to die to our sin nature. &gt;&gt; That we have to surrender our wills. And even though we've been born again and died to our sin nature, there's many of times where we have to still surrender our will to the Lord Jesus Christ. Yes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, I WANT US I WANT US TO JUST STOP AND THINK HERE TONIGHT. I KNOW IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT different thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want us to really stop to consider not everybody is called to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; AND ONLY THOSE WHO HAS NO OTHER WAY TO GO. ONLY THOSE WILL FOLLOW AFTER JESUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I I'VE GOT TWO SCRIPTURES THERE THAT I CAN SHOW YOU. AMEN. two groups of people and and when when Jesus, you know, he was talking one time and and in John 6 and 60 and he and he and he and he and he mentioned he he was he was preaching and and and it says, "And many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said, this is a hard saying, who can hear it?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says the 66th verse, "And from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him." But then Jesus then said Jesus to the 12, "Will you go away also?" &gt;&gt; Then Simon Peter answered and said, "Lord, to whom shall we go? &gt;&gt; For thou hast the words of eternal life?" &gt;&gt; Two two people. There's one THAT CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And there's the other. It's just a religious following. &gt;&gt; It's just something to to make their life better maybe. Or they Amen. They're following it for the prestige or whatever. But you see, Jesus is wanting somebody who is willing to lay their life down for the cause. Because you say, "Brother Wendle, man, Christianity isn't dos and don'ts." And I agree, Christianity is not dos and don'ts. &gt;&gt; But I will tell you this. If you ever find a revelation of who Jesus is, you will walk with him. Jesus and the revelation that Jesus had, his revelation &gt;&gt; SO SET HIM apart &gt;&gt; from anybody else. Can you say amen? Even if we were TO RETRACE HIS FOOTSTEPS TO GETHSEMANE, THAT'S WHERE THE GARDEN the garden of Gethsemane. Amen. There is is that there in Gethsemane is where is where Jesus surrendered his will. And I and I've said and I've always said the crucifixion took place there in Gethsemane. Now you say, "No, the crucifixion was on Mount Calvary." BUT YOU SEE THERE at Gethsemane was where Jesus will was surrendered. &gt;&gt; JESUS BATTLED A GREAT BATTLE at Gethsemane before he went to Mount Calvary. &gt;&gt; JESUS KNOWING WHAT WAS AHEAD OF HIM. AND JESUS ASKED HIS DISCIPLES TO COME AND PRAY WITH HIM. He [snorts] took Peter, James, and John up there in the garden. Amen. And asked them to pray. And then he goes up there a little bit further. He starts praying and he and and the Bible says that Jesus was in such agony. He was in such agony because he was going to be dying and he knew he knew the suffering that he was that it was going to come on him. Amen. The Bible says that his water and his blood had separated in such a way. Amen. That he sweated blood. Blood drops of sweat was coming down. Amen. Science says that he had gotten so he had gotten under such stress. HE WAS UNDER SUCH AGONY WITH HIS WILL. HIS WILL WAS AMEN. HE WAS STRUGGLING SO HARD. YES, I'M TALKING ABOUT JESUS, the perfect son OF GOD. JESUS HAD TO SURRENDER EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM. AMEN. Then he comes to his friends. Amen. and his pupils, those that he's been training and they're sleeping. And he says, "Do you not understand the urgency of the hour? I'm not going to be with you always." And they said, "I'm sorry." And they he wakes him up and they go back to praying. He goes back to praying. But finally Jesus reached that point to where he could he could he could lose himself and he died to his nature. And he said, "Father, not my will, &gt;&gt; but thy will be done." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding that the power Jesus didn't LOSE POWER? JESUS HAD POWER. &gt;&gt; JESUS WASN'T BEGGING FOR SOMETHING THAT HE DID NOT HAVE. But Jesus willingly surrendered himself to the will of God, to the will of the father. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And I think it's interesting because if you were to read there, Sister Keys, if you'd put that up there, John 18 and4. Amen. He he he um he's he's talking about this is him. Amen. Jesus knowing all things that should come to him went forth and asked. Now, this is Judas. Judas has already went up there. He's brought he's brought the disciples or he's he's brought the the angry mob, all of the soldiers, spears, swords. They're coming to grab to take Jesus. And he went forth and said unto them, Whom seek ye? And they answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. And Jesus said unto them, I am he. Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. And as soon as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward and fell on the ground. I want you to look at the power that Jesus had. Jesus the the author. He had power. He had authority. Amen. Keep that up there, sister Keys. AMEN. THEY WENT BACK. THEY FELL BACKWARD TO THE GROUND. THIS POWER JESUS DID NOT lose his power. &gt;&gt; Right? Are are YOU UNDERSTANDING ME? MATTER OF FACT, IF YOU WERE TO IF IF IF YOU WERE TO look there at Matthew uh we'll come back to that in just a minute. But if you were to look there at Matthew 26 and 53, HE SAYS, "THINKEST THOU THAT I CANNOT PRAY TO MY FATHER, AND HE SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE ME MORE THAN 12 LEGIONS OF ANGELS, but how shall the scriptures be fulfilled &gt;&gt; that thus it MUST BE?" NOW JESUS IS SAYING, &gt;&gt; "I CAN CALL ANGELS AND ALL OF Y'ALL WOULD BE A GRIEF SPOT RIGHT NOW, &gt;&gt; but scriptures couldn't be fulfilled &gt;&gt; unless I surrender my will." &gt;&gt; Now, I want us to really think about this for a moment. Not going to hold you long tonight. Now &gt;&gt; scriptures can only be fulfilled when there are followers of Jesus &gt;&gt; who was willing to follow the road and retrace the steps that he took. While some of us why some of us we we just it's the easy things. We we don't want to give up vaping or we don't want to give up our grudge or we don't want to give up our you know our our our our pet feelings or for you girls you don't want to quit cutting your hair or Amen or or or or what you know what whatever it may be in those LITTLE THINGS I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS MAN HAD TO LAY HIS LIFE DOWN. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the healer. He was the deliverer. He had he had the throngs &gt;&gt; and HE HAD THE POWER WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible &gt;&gt; how that the prophet would tell us power without character is satanic? SEE, GOD HAS WANT IS IS IS WANTING TO INVEST HIS POWER IN HIS CHURCH. AND HE HAS INVESTED HIS power in his church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But you see, there's got to be some character that charact. What can you say? Amen. Now, now Jesus would go on in that 55th verse and he would say, "And at the same hour said Jesus to the multitudes or you come out as against a thief with swords and staves to take me." Now this is another account that to take me I set daily with you teaching in the temple and you laid no hold on me. But all this is done that the scripture of the prophets might be fulfilled. And then look, then all the disciples forsook him and fled. Now think about it. I I I want us to just just as I as as I looking there at the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus talking about follow thou me. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; It just behooves us to look and it and and retrace. Now, history say or the scriptures share that the next place that Jesus is going to go, they come and took him. They took him to the high priest. Amen. There's where the religious preachers are at. There's where the they they made fun of him and demanding him to prophesy. Luke 22:63 said they mocked him and and smoteed him and they blindfolded him and demanded him as they struck him in the face. Prophesy. Who is it that smoked thee? Amen. and many other blasphemously uh things blasphemously spake they against him. Amen. You got to follow him there. There's going to be there's going to be those that are just the preachers are going to come against this message &gt;&gt; and what God's doing. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying if we're going to follow his footsteps, &gt;&gt; the next place you're going to go, you're going to go to Herod's court. Amen. Or or to Pilate's Hall. And there's where the criticisms and the flogging and the the falsely accused AND PILATE SAYING, "I HAVE POWER OVER YOU. I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT." AND JESUS LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID, "YOU HAVE [screaming] NO POWER over me." &gt;&gt; Other than that which God gives you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIMES IT'S IN THIS ERA AREA OF OUR LIVES that the devil is fighting us. And Satan says, "I've got power over you. &gt;&gt; I've got power over you." But there's where we follow the footprints of Jesus. And Jesus says, "You have no power." And I want to say, "No power over you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Satan has no power over God's elect. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU UNDERSTANDING ME? WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT WE ARE LIVING IN THE TIME OF SCRIPTURES BEING fulfilled and there must be genuine disciples &gt;&gt; that's going to follow after Christ. Because sometimes sometimes walking through those valleys, Amen. Sometimes when it seems like we're all alone, sometimes when we're in the dark, sometimes that's when a Psalms 23, amen, rings out the best. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He leadth me beside the still waters. He restoth my soul. He feeds me. Amen. In the presence of mine enemies. See? SEE, IT'S IT'S US SURRENDERING OURSELVES TO HIM. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Following the Lord, I think is so important. After you get through Pilot's hall, you're going to go to Herod's court. And Herod's was excited. Herod was happy. Uh uh you can put that up there, sister Keys, there in Luke 23 and8. Herod was happy that they brought Jesus in. He had heard so many things. And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see &gt;&gt; of a long season because he had heard many things of him and he had hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There Jesus is standing before him and he's wanting they're wanting him to perform a miracle. And the Bible says Jesus answered not a word. If you read on down in that same book there in that same book you read, then you're going to find that the the the scripture says Pilate and Herod were were enemies. They wouldn't even talk to one another. But the Bible said because of this, Jesus brought these two enemies together and they were friends, they joined together to fight against that word made flesh. &gt;&gt; I have a point. I have a reason for going to where I'm going. &gt;&gt; All right. In order for the will of God to be performed, to be fulfilled in our in our day, that's going to require some disciples. &gt;&gt; Some real men and women, boys and girls who are willing to follow after the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You see, dominion belongs to that eternal seed. And to me, the greatest dominion of all, what proves Jesus, what proves Jesus besides the resurrection, what proves Jesus to be who he was was the ability. He had power. I mean, just just his presence and answer, and who you asking for? And all the soldiers, they all fell back. They all fell down. Hallelujah. He had power with him. He said, "I've got 12 legions of angels that I could have at my disposal right now." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, they're all around. You all don't see them, but they're on every tree. They're all over these. They're lurking everywhere. They can have your bacon right now. &gt;&gt; But Jesus had dominion, brought his will under control, &gt;&gt; and said, "Not my will, but thy will be done." &gt;&gt; I want his will. And many times I think of I think of Ecclesiastes 11:9. It says, "Rejoice to you young people. Rejoice, oh young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth. Walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes, but know thou, for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. Therefore remove sorrow from thine heart, and put away evil from thy flesh. Okay. &gt;&gt; For childhood and youth are vanity. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Surrendering to the Lord, his His presence coming upon you, laying yourself upon that altar, gifts of God laying within the elect. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Jesus could not. Now, he performed miracles. He done he done wonderful things. But Jesus main purpose for coming was not to heal Lazarus and the blind man. And and Jesus Jesus purpose was to redeem you. &gt;&gt; And when it came down to that, it came down to him having to surrender everything he had because of that. The Bible says that he has been raised, exalted, and given a name above all names. &gt;&gt; I say tonight as we come to this finality of redemption, there is going to be a people that is not going to see death. And I believe that we are I I believe that that that there's a lot of you sitting here today I believe that are not going to see death. I believe the rapture is that close. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe the scripture has told us that when you see that fig tree bud, lift up your head, redemption draws nigh. That's talking about Israel. We've got we we've got all of these prophetic things that have come about. We we're here and I I believe the greatest triumphant march that is that is processional that has taken place is fixing to take place. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It was a great it was a great processional. Amen. When Jesus and and and and all of those saints walked in, those Old Testament saints. But brother, there ain't nothing like the bride of Jesus Christ that's fixing to walk in. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, I I I, as the Apostle Paul would say there in Galatians 2 and 20, I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but Christ lives in me. THE LIFE WHICH I NOW LIVE IN THE FLESH, I live by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. Well, can I hear a great big amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because we have surrendered ourselves to the Lord. And only when you surrender yourselves to the Lord, you've got to die. And only then when you die can you rise up in the newness of life. And when God can come and fill you with his Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Spirit comes, everything becomes brand new. &gt;&gt; Brand new. Everything is brand new. &gt;&gt; The way you think is brand new. You ain't turning the Christianity is not turning over a new leaf. Christianity, Amen, is the very nature of Jesus Christ coming on the inside of you and him living his life through you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sin is no longer sin. Amen. You have no desire for that. You have one desire, and that is to walk with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And there's plenty of blood there. If you should fall and make a mistake, you should fail. And you should say, "Oh my, I have I have fallen short." Amen. But God's grace is right there for every one of us. And saying, "I'm my blood will be there to take you all the way. My grace is sufficient in your time of need. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We're in this dark room. WE'RE IN THIS WE'RE IN THIS UH THIS WORLD IS LIKE A DARK ROOM. Uh we're WHERE THE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEGATIVES ARE ARE are are taking place. Amen. As the old 35 millimeter cameras, well, all you know, all of the old cameras used to have that negative. Amen. those negatives that you'd have to go in and to that dark room and then all of the all of the negatives. Amen. Then it would come out to the positive. And what God seen of you, every one of you that were on his book before the world ever began, God seen you in your perfection. God seen you in glory. GOD SEEN YOU. HE'S ALREADY GOT A place reserved at his banqueting table for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to set with the literal, amen, the literal Jesus Christ. Some people try to make it say, "Oh, well, you know, you we're not going to see a literal body." And the and and and then there's, you know, and and they say, "Uh, you know, the marriage supper, that was just all figurative." And then we're in the marriage supper right now. You know, we're feasting. And I and I'm thinking, I don't know what kind of a message you heard, but I've never heard that from the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says that it'll go for miles. That table will go for miles and miles and miles. And I've got my name at that table. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT YOUR NAME AT THAT TABLE. You say, "Well, Brother Wendell, I what if I don't CONTINUE TO FOLLOW?" AMEN. GOD [screaming] KNOWS EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE, AND IT DON'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF A TRIAL CAN COME YOUR WAY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right. &gt;&gt; The testing's come. The testing's go. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're in that you're in that dark room that Romans Romans the 7th chapter puts it puts it uh very good in the 22nd verse. Amen. He says, "For I delight in the LAW OF GOD AFTER the inward man." &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; I DELIGHT AFTER THE LAW OF GOD. AMEN. In the law of God after the uh uh THE INWARD MAN. BUT THERE IS A ANOTHER LAW THAT IS WORKING IN ME. AMEN. I see it's working in my members. And I Amen. that there in uh Romans 7 and 23. AMEN. WARING AGAINST THE LAW [screaming] OF MY mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. What is he trying to say? Amen. There is always that something gnawing in your mind. ALWAYS TELLING YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT THE REAL DISCIPLE. That he chose this one sitting on this side of you and that one sitting on that side of you. But you're not the disciple. But it's time for you to look at him. Amen. And remind him of a song that that that that Merl Haggard wrote. I'm not the running kind. Hallelujah. Amen. I am not running. I'm not turning aside. [screaming] I'm not looking to the left OR THE RIGHT. TRIALS COME, BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PRESSURE, AMEN, THAT THESE THINGS THAT COME AGAINST ME AND THEY BUFFET MY SOUL. AND I SIT THERE SOMETIMES, AMEN, AND AGONY [screaming] AND WONDERING IF GOD'S FORGOT ABOUT ME AND WONDERING IF I'M GOING TO COME THROUGH. I WANT YOU TO KNOW GOD [screaming] IS DEVELOPING CHARACTER IN YOU. YOU ARE HIS SUBJECT. YOU [screaming] ARE HIS SON AND DAUGHTER. HE IS LEADING YOU, THE DISCIPLE, unto that throne of glory. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; What you're going through is nothing more or nothing less than Jesus had to go through. &gt;&gt; You say nothing less. Jesus had to surrender his will. &gt;&gt; And you must do the exact same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to surrender your will &gt;&gt; in order to follow the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The apostle Paul there in Romans 12 and one. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. &gt;&gt; What he has done, he's the master, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The servant isn't isn't above his master. We're not above the Lord. &gt;&gt; THE LORD JESUS HAD TO surrender everything. WE CALL HIM LORD BECAUSE HE SURRENDERED. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; And therefore, God exalted him up into the heavens higher than the heavens of heavens. He's exalted above every name. And everyone that is going to come and reign with HIM IN HIS THRONE AS THE BOOK OF REVELATION SAID WE WILL. &gt;&gt; We must come the way that he came. &gt;&gt; WE MUST OVERCOME AS HE OVERCAME. CAN YOU SAY &gt;&gt; AMEN? &gt;&gt; So the trials, the tribulations, the hardships, count them all with joy. I will follow Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I will not look to the left or the right. I will not be disenfranchised. I will not be Amen. UH PULLED THIS WAY OR PULLED THAT WAY. I WILL [screaming] FOLLOW HIM WITH ALL of my heart. So help me God. So help me. WHEN THE DEVIL'S FIGHTING YOU, AMEN, AND TORMENTING YOU AND TRYING TO PULL YOU THIS WAY AND PULL YOU THAT WAY, YOU JUST REMEMBER SATAN IS NO LONGER YOUR LORD. JESUS CHRIST is your Lord &gt;&gt; and you follow him &gt;&gt; and you walk with him. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes. Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of window will of God. &gt;&gt; What was his first deal? Lay yourself on the altar. Offer your bodies as a living sacrifice. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So tonight, midweek, the devil can fight one way or fight another way, but that's all right. Amen. As Kobe sung that song, I have decided to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back. No. No one goes with me. Still, I'll follow. Is that right? Now, I'm not talking about I'm not talking about just coming to church and living a good life. I'm talking about knowing him in the power of his resurrection. I am dying in order to find the power that is in that resurrection. The the the gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection. It's the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. AND IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE BORN AGAIN, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A DEATH, BURIAL, AND A RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [applause] AMEN. &gt;&gt; The gospel is quite simple. I deny myself. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Denying myself. Well, I've quit smoking and I've I've started living for the Lord and I and those are wonderful. Those are good. But the moment you stop, then you're no longer a disciple. The scripture says that there were many of those disciples who said this is a hard saying who can hear it and they followed him no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In the children in the wilderness, the children of Israel had to follow that pillar of fire. And when they refused to follow the pillar of fire, they were left in the wilderness &gt;&gt; without the presence of God. What is what has the church done throughout all these church ages? The pillar of fire has come. Amen. It's brought us in and then they would stop and denominate. And the pillar of fire says, "Sorry, I'm not a denomination. I'm going I've got a purpose for redeeming you. I'm taking you to glory." Stopping they they lost out. Amen. He'd raise up another group and they would follow for a while and then they'd stop and said, "This is God." And then they God just kept on moving until now here we are in this seventh church age and God has still moving. He's not dead. He's still moving and he's going to keep on moving until we make a rapture. &gt;&gt; And until then, we're going to see signs and wonders and miracles. We're going to see the glory of God. We're going to see it. Why? Because there are some people who have surrendered their wills to Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Amen. There there in the book of of of um uh of Romans the the fourth chapter, I believe it is. Amen. That Jesus was declared to be the son of God by the resurrection from the dead. And so IS THE CHURCH DECLARED TO BE THE SON OF GOD BY the resurrection OUT OF THESE DARK DENOMINATIONALISM. AMEN. OUT OF THIS OUT OF THIS DARK PRISON HOUSE OF SIN, GOD'S WORD IS COMING. AND THIS DAY, THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME BODIES. THERE'S GOING TO BE A SON AND A DAUGHTER OF GOD THAT IS GOING TO STAND UP IN THIS DAY AND WE'RE GOING TO DECLARE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR AND WE'RE GOING TO SAY, "AMEN. YOU HOUSE OF HELL, [screaming] GIVE WAY IN THE NAME OF JESUS." &gt;&gt; HE'S ANOINTED US FOR THIS. HE'S ANOINTED US TO HEAL THE SICK AND RAISE THE DEAD. HE'S ANOINTED US. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE AMEN. BUT THE IT TAKES THE DYING [screaming] OUT. IT TAKES A CRUCIFIXION. IT TAKES a time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here I am, Lord, surrendering everything that I've got to you. Sometimes it takes it takes a lot of faith. Amen. To stand up and say, you know what? I'm not going to sit in this house of gloom anymore. That's &gt;&gt; right. I'm going to get up &gt;&gt; because the Holy Spirit is the He's the resurrection and life. &gt;&gt; He doesn't live in a house of gloom and doom. &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Well, you're living in a three- room house right now. &gt;&gt; I'm going to refuse depression. &gt;&gt; I'm going to refuse sickness. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ref I'm going to rise up and I'm going to let this sow. I'm going to let this sew. I'm going to open up the curtains and let sunshine into this soul. &gt;&gt; Let the sun shine in. Can you say amen? This woe is me attitude is for the birds, man. There ain't no woe is me there. Jesus don't He didn't have a woe is me when he went to Calvary. Jesus was fulfilling scripture. &gt;&gt; AND THERE AIN'T NO [screaming] WOE IS ME ATTITUDE IN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. WE'RE FULFILLING SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN PROPHESIED THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH IT. IT'S BEEN PROPHESIED [screaming] WE GOT TO GO THROUGH THE SQUEEZE. IT'S BEEN PROPHESIED THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE 200 MILLION DEMONS THAT'S GOING TO COME AGAINST YOU. BUT IT'S ALSO [screaming] BEEN PROPHESIED THEY SHALL NOT HAVE A HOLD OF YOU. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL NOT HAVE CONTROL OF YOU. YOU'RE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; The crucifixion didn't defeat the purpose. The crucifixion fulfilled the purpose. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And he and he's a loser. The the the And I know I know he's got to be pretty smart. Satan is he's got to be pretty smart. He's, you know, he's got a lot of people following him. But it's like the Democrats. They've all got the Maybe I shouldn't have said. Let's retract that. It's just like these political parties. They they they they they hang on to the same old playbook that they've been using for teen years. Praise the Lord. And Satan thinks that he can destroy you. And he comes and he put and the more pressure he puts on you, &gt;&gt; the greater glory he's got. He's just pushing you to your destiny. &gt;&gt; He's pushing you to your purpose. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So the APOSTLE PAUL SAYS, "THEREFORE, [screaming] I WILL GLORY." SOMEBODY SAY, "GLORY &gt;&gt; IN MINE INFIRMITIES. &gt;&gt; I'll glory in them. I'M GOING TO GLORY IN MY TRIALS. I'M GOING TO GLORY IN MY PERSECUTIONS. I'M GOING TO GLORY WHEN MY MIND FEELS LIKE IT'S ABOUT TO FALL APART. I'M GOING TO GLORY IN THEM BECAUSE I KNOW [screaming] WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY ARE TAKING ME TO my eternal hope and that GLORY BEYOND THE RIVER. OH, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? CAN YOU SHOUT [screaming] HALLELUJAH? [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE UNDER AN ANOINTING. YOU'RE UNDER A MANDATE FROM GOD TO CAST OUT THE DEVILS. YOU'RE UNDER [screaming] A MANDATE FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A CRUCIFIED LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're at a Gethsemane here tonight. Maybe you're there where you can't hardly go any further. Hallelujah. Stay there. Maybe you can't get your friends to pray with you. Maybe you can't get [laughter] no one to understand the agony that you're in. Hallelujah. Amen. But it's in those dark times &gt;&gt; that God comes shining through. &gt;&gt; God bless you if the musicians would come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. Bless the name of the Lord. Follow thou me. Follow me. He's the shepherd. He knows where he's taking you. He knows what he's got for you. [snorts] We're going to follow him. &gt;&gt; I'll go with him through the trial. I'll go with them through the trial. I'll go with him through the trial. I'll go with him with him [singing] all the way. Where you lead [singing and music] me, &gt;&gt; I I'm going to follow you, Jesus. Where you lead me. &gt;&gt; It's where you lead [music] me. Where you lead me. I &gt;&gt; many times it's your crosses may [music] be different. Your cross is different than Jesus. He was the [music] perfect son of God who gave his life for all of us. For me as a young man having a being a songwriter musician [music] had to turn my focus. I had to say no. even [music] given a given a shot to go perform and one of our nation's most prestigious [music] country platforms, the Grand [music] Opry. But that wasn't God's will for me. I had to I had to die to that. I had to die [music] to that those feelings of wanting to get out and make a bunch [music] of money. Nothing wrong with making money. If you're going to make a If you're going to make money, you might as well make a bunch. Amen. But God don't want us chasing the mighty dollar. But I had to I had to lay it all down. [music] And one of the times when I was in my hardest of struggles, hardest of struggles, Oh, I was struggling [music] because the money was there and the opportunity and the green light. I had it. It was there. [music] And I was just I I I'd already made up my mind. And I'd already I mean I my mind was well I I thought it was made up. I It's going to be a walk in the park, man. I've been waiting for this for a long time. I get a phone call. Someone out of town, not even knowing what they don't even go to church here. His first question or his first remark was, [music] "Brother Wendle, how are you?" "Fine. I am grieved in my spirit that you would put God and your ministry on the sideline just so that you can go out and make some [music] money." And did he wear me out? And did he make me mad? [music] I was in my Gethsemane. [music] I was in my time that God had me right there. I'm going to tell you, you don't go to just Gethsemane one time in your [music] life. There's going to be many of times in your life where you're going to be at that garden and you're right there. You've got to make your crossroad. You've got to make your decisions. You are there. You've got to make that choice to follow the Lord. You got to make that choice. I can say I've got it. I've gone through through life many of times. I've I've experienced it many of times. So, I know what I'm saying here tonight. There may be somebody here, maybe you're at your crossroads. Maybe you've already given your life to the Lord, but you're you're needing to keep on following. Maybe you've [music] been serving the Lord for a long time, but God's dealing with your heart tonight, saying, "Hey, I'm over here. Just follow on [music] to and know the Lord. Do you love him here tonight? [music] &gt;&gt; Scripture says, "Some through the fire, some through the floods, some through great trial." [music] Maybe that's not scripture. Maybe that's a song. I don't know. Amen. But all through the blood. Is that a scripture, brother Merl? [music] But we going to go don't want to attribute something to God that wasn't put in the book, but we go through it, don't we? But just to know that I'm a son of God. No matter where I'm at or what I'm going through, I might be having I I might be having a migraine out of of just just about out of my head. just just just about to just about to blow off. It seems I bet I can know that faithful is he. [music] &gt;&gt; I can go through those trials and but I know my anchor holds. &gt;&gt; Can you say [music] amen? World's in an upset condition right now. Amen. with with uh with this shutdown [music] and of food stamps and and a lot of government jobs. It's it's affected. Even brother Nathaniel, he's on furlow, no pay, ain't going to get reimbursed. I mean, things things can [music] get tough for the righteous, but this is where we [music] see the supernatural come in. I'm not a fan. I'm just not a fan of Republican or Democrat. [music] I'm just not a fan. But I am a fan [music] of the Lord Jesus Christ. [applause] &gt;&gt; And when I don't understand it, I can [music] still trust him. &gt;&gt; You understand? When you can't trust your government, you don't know who you do. You can put your trust in Jesus. Even though Jesus is holding his hand back for a minute, you can know that it's [music] going to be all right. I'm not in a Democrat's hand. I'm not in a Republican's hand. I'm in the Lord's hand. &gt;&gt; I've made my vow to him &gt;&gt; because of him. I have [music] confidence. God bless you tonight. All [singing] the way where he leads me. [singing] I will follow where he leads [singing] [music] me. I will [singing] follow. [music] Where he leads me, where he leads me, I will follow. I'll go with him. With him all [singing] the way. Hallelujah. Well, [music] praise the Lord. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, we [music] just give ourselves to you right now. We thank you for the road that you have led [music] us down all through our life. And Lord Jesus, [music] it's an honor to follow you. in the trials, the testings, even in the scourgings, even in the the whippons, the correcting us. We thank you for it all, Father. Our desire is to follow you, Lord Jesus. [music] We give it all to you here tonight. We're coming [music] back to Calvary again. And when you say, "Lord, this was the place where it all this is where it all happened. This is where [music] our salvation was was bought. This is where you willingly laid [music] down your life for us. We're going to retrace those steps. Lord, we want to die right there at Calvary with you. Father, I [music] ask that every need would be made be met. Every the power of the Holy Spirit [music] be with your people.

[singing] As we dismiss, we'll I'd encourage you [music] to just step across the aisle and tell somebody you love them. Not in a not in a loud [music] noisy way, but a a brotherly way. And I think that should be in any kind of service when we're greeting one another. It shouldn't be loud and boisterous. It shake someone's [music] hand if they want to do that in music. And but just shake your [music] neighbor's hand. There's not too many of us. And I'm glad to be associated with every one of you. Glad to be associated with you, Sister Kaylee.
