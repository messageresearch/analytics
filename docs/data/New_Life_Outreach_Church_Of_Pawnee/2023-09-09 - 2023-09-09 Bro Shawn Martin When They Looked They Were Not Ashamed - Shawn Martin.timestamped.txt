[46:45] a man see the revelation of
[46:48] Malachi 4 Revelations 10 7.
[46:53] but it's so good for the Holy Spirit to
[46:55] come down and confirm the seed in you
[46:58] to say you're part of that promise
[47:02] for the Holy Spirit to come
[47:05] and to say you're the once more

[49:22] these parts I uh brother Sean was was at
[49:27] the very beginning with with us here in

[49:57] the tribes and a way up North we we just
[50:01] done everything uh everything we've done

[50:06] um so uh when somebody had given us the
[50:10] adoption series
[50:12] some tapes Iman we we sat there and
[50:17] listened to those messages and we'd both
[50:20] sat there in the living room and and
[50:22] just cry
[50:23] as we're listening to the prophet of God
[50:25] saying there's more to this
[50:27] there's more to it you've got the Holy
[50:30] Ghost but there's more to it
[50:32] and we would sit there and just weep and
[50:34] and listen to these tapes
[50:37] and and so the lord gave us the
[50:40] revelation of this message we grew
[50:43] together and we fought together we we
[50:46] have overcome together and so it is it

[58:52] the word and just pray the Lord will
[58:55] help us and to say something that would
[58:58] edify you amen but first of all we want
[59:02] to turn to the Book of Mark
[59:04] the eighth chapter
[59:07] amen
[59:10] The Book of Mark the eighth chapter
[59:20] praise the Lord
[59:24] when you're there Say Amen
[59:28] sounds like most so
[59:30] it says whosoever therefore shall be
[59:32] ashamed of me and of my words and this
[59:35] adulterous and sinful generation
[59:38] of him also
[59:40] shall the son of man be ashamed when he
[59:43] cometh in the glory of his father with
[59:48] the Holy Angels
[59:49] amen then if you'll turn with me the uh
[59:53] The Book of Matthew
[59:56] the 16th chapter
[1:00:08] The Book of Matthew the 16th chapter
[1:00:12] the 27th verse
[1:00:15] says for the son of man shall come in
[1:00:17] the glory of his father
[1:00:20] with his angels and then he shall reward
[1:00:23] every man
[1:00:25] according to his works
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:30] one more scripture if you'll turn with
[1:00:32] me to the Book of Psalms
[1:00:37] the 34th chapter
[1:00:47] amen
[1:00:48] we're going to read um
[1:00:52] the fifth verse
[1:00:55] they looked unto him
[1:00:58] and were lightened
[1:01:00] and their faces
[1:01:02] were not ashamed
[1:01:05] amen
[1:01:06] may we just bow our heads and
[1:01:09] talk to our Lord
[1:01:12] Lord Jesus
[1:01:15] we come as your children
[1:01:17] this morning
[1:01:20] we're so thankful Lord of what you have
[1:01:22] done Lord in the meetings
[1:01:25] Lord and helping your people
[1:01:28] father I believe you later on brother
[1:01:32] Wendell's hard as the pastor Lord to
[1:01:34] have these meetings and
[1:01:37] so you could come and meet with us Lord
[1:01:39] and then you could do a work
[1:01:42] and father I pray that you would just
[1:01:44] help me to get myself out of the way and
[1:01:47] that you could anoint the gift that you
[1:01:49] placed Within Me
[1:01:51] and Lord that you would anoint your
[1:01:53] people anoint their ears to hear and
[1:01:56] their hearts to understand
[1:01:58] and father may you would have the
[1:02:00] preeminence in this place this morning
[1:02:03] to walk the aisles Lord and as your
[1:02:06] Prophet even prayed one time that the
[1:02:10] angels of God would just come and take
[1:02:13] their position
[1:02:14] around each pew may you do it this
[1:02:17] morning Father
[1:02:19] oh Father we commit this service into
[1:02:21] your hands Lord these are your people
[1:02:25] your blood bought your redeemed you
[1:02:29] thought of them Lord more than your own
[1:02:31] life
[1:02:32] father Lord you gave your blood for them
[1:02:35] oh Father we just love you and we thank
[1:02:39] you for what you're going to do in Jesus
[1:02:42] Christ's name and the church says
[1:02:45] a man and a man you can have your seats
[1:02:49] this morning
[1:02:51] and I I just have a a simple thought and
[1:02:55] um
[1:02:56] this morning and and trust that it will
[1:02:59] be a a blessing to you
[1:03:02] um uh here but my title if if I would
[1:03:06] have one is they were not ashamed uh
[1:03:09] when they looked
[1:03:11] and it has already been said uh that
[1:03:16] that God allotted a portion of his word
[1:03:19] to to each age
[1:03:21] and God could do that by his
[1:03:25] foreknowledge
[1:03:27] and uh you see he has an infinite mind
[1:03:31] and so he knows the end from the
[1:03:34] beginning
[1:03:35] therefore he could declare what will be
[1:03:38] before it ever happens
[1:03:40] ain't that right and then and and to be
[1:03:43] honest this is the Bible is it's a book
[1:03:46] of History it's it's a book of songs
[1:03:49] it's it's a book of of love it's a book
[1:03:52] of poetry but it it in all of it it's a
[1:03:55] book of Prophecy it's foretelling of
[1:03:57] something even though you look at the
[1:04:00] Bible and you can say well that event
[1:04:01] happened but if you could look at really
[1:04:04] what's going on it's telling of what
[1:04:06] will happen and what will be and so uh
[1:04:10] God God uh could predestinate by his
[1:04:14] foreknowledge certain things to happen
[1:04:16] at certain times and not only that but
[1:04:19] he he predestinated a certain group of
[1:04:22] people for the age to fulfill his word
[1:04:26] and so brother Branham would tell us in
[1:04:29] order to have Believers to meet that
[1:04:31] word he's got to predestinate it to that
[1:04:33] age you see it he's got to predestinate
[1:04:36] this thing to be there to meet the
[1:04:38] challenge of the age
[1:04:40] he said did you get it did you feel it
[1:04:42] did you see it do you understand it
[1:04:44] that's what's happening today he
[1:04:47] predestinated it to this by his
[1:04:50] foreknowledge when he predestinated in
[1:04:53] Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he
[1:04:56] come over and he predestinates anything
[1:04:58] in his word he had to prove his word to
[1:05:01] be so when he predestinates anything to
[1:05:03] happen and says it will happen he knows
[1:05:06] everybody say he knows he knows that
[1:05:09] seed will be there just at that time he
[1:05:12] predestinated a bride she's going to be
[1:05:15] there there's going to be a Rapture
[1:05:18] she's going to be there she's
[1:05:20] predestinated it by his or he's
[1:05:23] predestinated it by his foreknowledge
[1:05:25] and there's nothing going to stop it
[1:05:28] aren't you glad for that there's there's
[1:05:30] nothing that that is going to stop it in
[1:05:33] another place he says if you're a Son of
[1:05:36] God or a daughter of God you were in God
[1:05:39] all the time
[1:05:40] see but he knew what bed and time that
[1:05:44] you would be planted so now you're made
[1:05:46] a creature a Son of God manifested son
[1:05:50] or a daughter of God to meet the
[1:05:52] challenge of this hour to vindicate the
[1:05:56] true and living God of this hour the
[1:05:59] message that's coming forth in this time
[1:06:02] can you say Amen so if I could say it uh
[1:06:05] paraphrases brother Manuel had said the
[1:06:08] other night we are the actors a man
[1:06:11] fulfilling the word for this day and age
[1:06:14] do you believe that amen we're not just
[1:06:17] here floating along we're not just here
[1:06:19] as an accident but God in his script
[1:06:22] amen
[1:06:24] planted us here for this age to act out
[1:06:27] his word for this day and if you really
[1:06:30] want to say it he's the actor a man that
[1:06:33] is coming into the vessels of of of this
[1:06:36] body right here amen it's Christ in you
[1:06:39] ain't that rhyme a man see so because
[1:06:42] the seals have been loosed and the book
[1:06:45] has been opened and revealed to us well
[1:06:49] we see what scriptures are applicable to
[1:06:52] us for our day aren't you glad you can
[1:06:55] look at the Bible and and apply the
[1:06:57] scriptures and apply yourself to them
[1:06:59] scriptures for the day that we lived in
[1:07:02] you know we before we come into the
[1:07:04] message we read the Bible but we didn't
[1:07:06] understand it we didn't know how to play
[1:07:08] scriptures and and and and and we would
[1:07:10] look at these things we would look at
[1:07:12] the stories and yet we wouldn't know how
[1:07:14] to apply it for the day and age but
[1:07:17] thank God for the lamb coming and opened
[1:07:19] the book A man that we could see amen
[1:07:22] what is to take place and so we know in
[1:07:26] this age by God's grace we know amen
[1:07:29] what scriptures a man pertained to us
[1:07:32] and that we have been predestinated to
[1:07:35] fulfill now I believe a man that God
[1:07:38] foretold of our day in our opening
[1:07:41] scriptures he foretold of Christ being
[1:07:44] revealed and also foretold of a people
[1:07:47] looking unto him and not being ashamed a
[1:07:51] man that when he would be revealed there
[1:07:54] would be a group of people a man that
[1:07:57] would look and would not be embarrassed
[1:07:59] and be ashamed ain't that right now you
[1:08:02] know the word ashamed is mentioned in
[1:08:05] these scriptures and and so
[1:08:08] um which in in my thoughts of it it
[1:08:12] gives the impression that there's going
[1:08:14] to be the majority of people that will
[1:08:17] be ashamed a man that will amen but but
[1:08:20] God would want to solidify in the
[1:08:22] scriptures a man that I've got a People
[1:08:25] reserved in that age that that will not
[1:08:28] be ashamed and he declared that they
[1:08:30] would not be ashamed amen and I'm not
[1:08:33] ashamed because the scriptures has
[1:08:36] already declared that I I see myself in
[1:08:39] the word do you see yourself in the Lord
[1:08:40] word we're not ashamed I'm not ashamed
[1:08:43] to say that God sent a prophet in this
[1:08:45] age I'm not ashamed to say that I'm
[1:08:48] going in a Rapture I
[1:08:52] I've been revealed in this age I'm not
[1:08:55] ashamed to quote quotes I'm I'm not
[1:08:57] ashamed to to shout amen because the
[1:09:00] lamb has opened the book I'm I'm not
[1:09:03] ashamed can you say amen amen yes sir
[1:09:06] see and and so uh it's already written
[1:09:10] that there will be a people who will
[1:09:12] look unto him and not be ashamed amen
[1:09:16] and you know what Paul mentions that
[1:09:18] group of people they are the ones who
[1:09:20] love his appearing and well do you do
[1:09:23] you love his appearing amen they love
[1:09:26] his appearing amen now this word is
[1:09:28] shame the prophet amen gives us the
[1:09:31] meaning of what ashamed means it means
[1:09:33] embarrass
[1:09:34] in other words you're faced with
[1:09:36] something that you're embarrassed about
[1:09:38] it's like Simeon you know uh he invited
[1:09:41] Jesus to his uh I believe it was Simeon
[1:09:44] or Simon invited Jesus to his party
[1:09:46] ain't that right amen but as we know in
[1:09:49] the scriptures and the prophet actually
[1:09:51] speaks about it and said several places
[1:09:54] there that that Jesus entered in
[1:09:57] unnoticed and he he was left in the
[1:10:01] corner with dirty feet and it was
[1:10:04] because salmon amen even though he had
[1:10:06] invited him was embarrassed of him he
[1:10:09] was ashamed of him ain't that right amen
[1:10:13] and God forbid that we would be ashamed
[1:10:15] amen of our Lord Jesus Christ God would
[1:10:19] have forbid that we would be ashamed and
[1:10:21] embarrassed to worship God Amen is can
[1:10:25] you say amen amen we we even look at
[1:10:28] Esau that had the birthright and the
[1:10:30] prophet said he was ashamed of that
[1:10:33] Birthright he was embarrassed of that
[1:10:35] Birthright and therefore he despised it
[1:10:38] amen that's right and the prophet said
[1:10:40] he represents the carnal believer of
[1:10:43] today amen but there was a man that
[1:10:46] wasn't ashamed and that was Moses amen
[1:10:48] when he looked at the people of God he
[1:10:51] wasn't ashamed and a man to suffer
[1:10:53] Affliction with them it didn't embarrass
[1:10:56] him to be refused to refuse to be called
[1:11:00] a man Pharaoh's uh uh the son of
[1:11:04] Pharaoh's daughter amen it didn't
[1:11:06] embarrass him or uh to be to to esteem
[1:11:09] the the reproach of Christ as the
[1:11:12] greater riches than the treasures of of
[1:11:15] of Egypt amen it it he wasn't ashamed
[1:11:19] Amen to forsake Egypt can you say amen
[1:11:22] amen the word ashamed also means that it
[1:11:26] shows that you're not sure of what
[1:11:29] you're talking about
[1:11:30] can you say amen I find a lot of people
[1:11:33] don't want to talk about the message to
[1:11:35] others and and and and just to be honest
[1:11:38] they're ashamed of it is because they
[1:11:40] don't they're not sure of what they're
[1:11:42] talking about people that are not sure
[1:11:44] that the seventh seal is open they won't
[1:11:47] preach it they won't talk about it if
[1:11:49] they're not sure that the lamb has come
[1:11:51] and opened the book they won't talk
[1:11:53] about it they don't want to preach it
[1:11:54] they want to just ignore it can you say
[1:11:57] Amen if they're not sure that this
[1:11:59] message is the absolute they they won't
[1:12:01] quote the quotes they'll say oh we need
[1:12:03] to get them to Jesus instead of the
[1:12:05] message amen they don't understand see
[1:12:08] that the message is Christ you you can't
[1:12:11] separate this message from Christ ain't
[1:12:13] that right amen see we're not ashamed to
[1:12:16] say that I'm not embarrassed to say that
[1:12:18] because I know what I'm talking about
[1:12:21] amen that's right see so so brother
[1:12:24] Branham said see if you know what you're
[1:12:26] talking about and have the assurance
[1:12:28] that you know what you're talking about
[1:12:30] you can tell everybody that see you're
[1:12:32] not ashamed but if you feel out of place
[1:12:34] it shows you're not sure it shows you're
[1:12:38] not sure if you're embarrassed about it
[1:12:40] so you'd rather not discuss the subject
[1:12:44] can you say amen amen well the prophet
[1:12:47] said if you're going to be ashamed or
[1:12:48] embarrassed of it you would want to hold
[1:12:51] back and not discuss said ain't that
[1:12:53] right but I I look at some wise men in
[1:12:56] the New Testament that looked and they
[1:12:58] saw a star amen and they weren't
[1:13:01] embarrassed about what they saw they
[1:13:03] weren't ashamed in what they saw they
[1:13:06] knew what it was all about they they
[1:13:09] knew amen that something on Earth was
[1:13:12] about to happen amen and they left
[1:13:14] everything they had to follow the star
[1:13:18] because they weren't embarrassed of it
[1:13:20] amen and they went to the critics and
[1:13:23] they went to the scoffers and they began
[1:13:25] to ask where is it where is the king of
[1:13:27] the Jew where is the king can you say
[1:13:30] Amen they went to the church and nobody
[1:13:32] would talk about it the amen they
[1:13:34] wouldn't because they didn't know they
[1:13:36] didn't know what they were talking about
[1:13:37] but there were some people on the Earth
[1:13:39] that would declare amen that he was on
[1:13:42] the earth because they looked and saw
[1:13:45] and knew what they were talking about
[1:13:47] amen I thought of John the Baptist he
[1:13:50] wasn't ashamed of his sermon he was
[1:13:52] ashamed you declare that the Lamb of God
[1:13:55] Amen was in their presence he had looked
[1:13:58] amen and he saw and he knew who he was
[1:14:02] and he wasn't ashamed to tell the people
[1:14:05] Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away
[1:14:09] the sins of the world
[1:14:11] now Psalms 34 again it says they looked
[1:14:16] unto him and were lightened and their
[1:14:18] faces were not ashamed now another
[1:14:21] scripture amen that I believe is
[1:14:24] applicable to our day and foretold of
[1:14:27] our day is Isaiah 45 and 22 God says
[1:14:31] look unto me everybody say look unto me
[1:14:34] and be ye saved
[1:14:37] all the ends of the Earth for I am God
[1:14:40] and there is none else ain't that right
[1:14:43] amen see so he is to be revealed at the
[1:14:47] ends of the Earth amen and we are
[1:14:50] commanded to look amen and not be
[1:14:53] ashamed to look and not be ashamed and
[1:14:57] be saved ain't that right amen so so we
[1:15:01] look now I'm not ashamed to say a man
[1:15:04] that that scripture uh there in Psalms
[1:15:07] ties with Luke 17 and 30. amen it's the
[1:15:11] revealing of the son of man can you say
[1:15:14] Amen I'm not ashamed to say that that
[1:15:17] Isaiah the one that we just read there
[1:15:20] in in in uh uh 45 22 is tied to the
[1:15:26] revealing of the son of man in Luke 17
[1:15:29] 30. amen see and God would tell us look
[1:15:33] unto me and be ye saved ain't that right
[1:15:36] amen at the time of the revealing it's
[1:15:39] time to look not at a denomination not
[1:15:42] at a preacher not at a personality not
[1:15:45] at a Doctrine not at this and not at
[1:15:47] that not at that it's in the time of the
[1:15:50] revealing that you must look because
[1:15:52] there's no salvation in looking in a
[1:15:55] denomination there is no salvation in
[1:15:57] looking at a preacher there is no
[1:16:00] salvation can you say amen and I'll say
[1:16:02] this there's no salvation in looking at
[1:16:05] a prophet amen you've got to look at
[1:16:07] what the prophet brought us and what he
[1:16:10] revealed in this age can you say amen
[1:16:13] amen that's right look unto me and be ye
[1:16:18] saved people are looking for salvation
[1:16:20] today they're looking for well I don't
[1:16:22] want to get overhead of myself but but I
[1:16:24] will tell you this not everybody is
[1:16:26] going to see him for Jesus already said
[1:16:29] the world will no longer see me but you
[1:16:32] will see me
[1:16:33] you will see me can you say Amen aren't
[1:16:36] you glad for that amen see not everybody
[1:16:39] believed that Jesus was the Christ when
[1:16:42] he walked the Earth the prophet said
[1:16:44] they tried to throw them Shadows on the
[1:16:46] name of Jesus and on Jesus to get it
[1:16:49] before the people I think that's what
[1:16:51] people are doing today they're trying to
[1:16:52] show throw Shadows Amen on this message
[1:16:56] amen they're trying to throw amen
[1:16:58] sayings Amen to Blind the people amen
[1:17:01] from the real truth of this message can
[1:17:04] you say Amen this message is not
[1:17:05] legalism
[1:17:08] this message ain't legalism this message
[1:17:10] isn't to bind you to a preacher this
[1:17:13] message isn't to bind you into what you
[1:17:15] can't lift up your hands and praise the
[1:17:17] name of the Lord amen they're doing
[1:17:19] exactly amen the way they done it back
[1:17:22] then amen they tried to throw amen the
[1:17:24] baggage on the name of Jesus they tried
[1:17:26] to destroy the name of Jesus they tried
[1:17:29] to Blind the people from The Name of
[1:17:31] Jesus but to those who were
[1:17:33] predestinated to see him and to know his
[1:17:36] ministry there he was can you say Amen
[1:17:39] well that's what the prophet said there
[1:17:42] was a people that would not be blinded
[1:17:44] they would not take amen anything else
[1:17:47] because they saw who he was
[1:17:53] they were predestinated to see him
[1:17:56] and to know his ministry
[1:17:58] now brother Branham said no matter if he
[1:18:00] ever opened his mouth about anything
[1:18:01] they knew he was
[1:18:04] they knew he was I don't care if they
[1:18:07] keep saying well that was brother
[1:18:08] Brandon's opinion I don't give a hoot I

[1:18:37] right if God wasn't ashamed to declare
[1:18:40] amen say I'm behind this message then

[1:21:41] is going to do I looked and I found
[1:21:45] salvation in this message
[1:21:55] we're living
[1:21:57] they have a church we're living at the
[1:21:59] ends of the Earth
[1:22:01] time has come to its end
[1:22:03] politics has come to its end church
[1:22:06] annity has come to its end the Nations
[1:22:08] have come to its end corruption and
[1:22:11] Mortal life has come to its end the
[1:22:14] church ages and denominational ages have
[1:22:17] run out I want you young people to
[1:22:19] understand now why God would send a
[1:22:21] message amen the time has come amen time
[1:22:24] is no more
[1:22:27] can you say man nations are against
[1:22:29] Nations because time has come to its end
[1:22:32] for them amen the politicians are loony
[1:22:34] because time has come to its end for
[1:22:37] them the economy is rocking and rolling

[1:22:44] civilization is shot because time has
[1:22:48] run out
[1:22:48] [Applause]
[1:22:51] so the salvation
[1:22:53] that is to come
[1:22:55] by looking unto him
[1:22:57] listen now we're told to look unto him
[1:22:59] look unto me all yens of the Earth
[1:23:02] amen so the the Salvation that is to
[1:23:05] come by looking unto him is the greater
[1:23:08] salvation than just a man coming to the
[1:23:11] Altar and claiming to be saved it's a
[1:23:14] greater salvation amen than a man
[1:23:17] receiving amen he is healing from a
[1:23:20] physical Affliction in his body can you
[1:23:24] say amen amen because now look here's
[1:23:26] another scripture that is applicable to
[1:23:28] our day Jesus said in Luke 17 26 as it
[1:23:33] was in the days of Noah so shall also be
[1:23:37] in the days of the son of man can you
[1:23:41] say Amen in a time that the son of man
[1:23:43] is revealed it'll be just exactly like
[1:23:46] it was in the days of Noah ain't that
[1:23:49] right now just just bear with me now but
[1:23:52] in the days of Noah the world had come
[1:23:55] to its first 2000 years and brother
[1:23:58] Brown said every two thousand years the
[1:24:00] world comes to its End Amen there's an
[1:24:03] end to something amen ain't that right
[1:24:05] he says every two thousand years the
[1:24:07] world has come to the end of its World
[1:24:09] System religious system to the end of
[1:24:13] all systems and God had to step in ain't
[1:24:16] that right so in the days of Noah see it
[1:24:19] had come to its 2000 years and now God
[1:24:22] was going to bring an end amen and his
[1:24:25] wrath was fixing to be poured out upon
[1:24:27] the people and upon the Earth and all
[1:24:30] everybody say all was going to perish
[1:24:33] amen but there was an elect amen man
[1:24:36] that God had in his thinking amen and so
[1:24:39] therefore God provided a way of Escape
[1:24:42] for those who wanted to escape the
[1:24:46] judgments of God aren't you glad that
[1:24:48] God is rich in Mercy I'll say it this
[1:24:50] way God's sending them a prophet and
[1:24:52] that day was Grace to the elect God
[1:24:55] sending a message in that day was Grace
[1:24:57] to the elect and all I can tell you is
[1:24:59] God sending a prophet in this day his
[1:25:02] grace to you amen the message is raised
[1:25:04] to you don't you let them turn this into
[1:25:07] legalism don't you let them turn this
[1:25:09] into psychology it's the race of God
[1:25:12] Amen to you amen for those who need a
[1:25:16] way of Escape
[1:25:20] God sent a prophet
[1:25:22] on the earth to forewarn the people of
[1:25:26] judgment
[1:25:27] but notice what the prophet also done he
[1:25:29] prepared an ark
[1:25:31] he wasn't just one that would say well
[1:25:34] there's coming a storm there's coming
[1:25:36] rain there's coming a flood the Earth is
[1:25:39] at its end everything's added in
[1:25:40] everybody's going to perish amen the
[1:25:43] message also prepared an ark
[1:25:48] see God's art the ark was God's provided
[1:25:51] way so the prophet of God not only
[1:25:54] declaring judgment he introduced The Ark
[1:25:58] to the people aren't you glad for that
[1:26:02] amen and those that got in the ark would
[1:26:05] be taken from the old world into the new
[1:26:08] world Amen that's right see and Not only
[1:26:12] was the prophet Noah predestinated to
[1:26:14] preach the message in his day but the
[1:26:17] ark was predestinated to be there in
[1:26:20] that day amen to carry the elect amen
[1:26:24] over into the new land amen it was
[1:26:27] predestinated oh can you say Amen it's
[1:26:31] all I can tell you is get in the thing
[1:26:33] that's predestinated
[1:26:35] [Applause]
[1:26:40] something's predestinated to work
[1:26:43] politics ain't working
[1:26:46] marriage seminars ain't working Bible
[1:26:49] schools ain't working denominations
[1:26:51] ain't working amen and the world don't
[1:26:53] know what to do but God's got something
[1:26:55] that's going to work he's already
[1:26:57] predestinated it it's going to work amen
[1:27:00] and you are the people that are
[1:27:02] predestinated to get in the ark amen the
[1:27:05] thing that's going to work to take you
[1:27:07] away from this troubled world
[1:27:11] you see we are at the end of 6 000 years
[1:27:15] it's come to an end again
[1:27:18] can you say man and every one of us
[1:27:20] knows that the wrath of God is upon the
[1:27:22] Earth and it's it's coming worse and the
[1:27:25] Bible already says amen that the hot
[1:27:27] men's Hearts would fail them for fear
[1:27:29] for looking upon those things that are
[1:27:31] to come and the people are as hearts are
[1:27:33] there's no there is a such a spirit has
[1:27:36] never been before of a spirit of anxiety
[1:27:39] that has gripped the people in this age
[1:27:43] people are troubled people are in insane
[1:27:46] people are losing it families are
[1:27:48] falling apart homeland's falling apart
[1:27:50] marriages are falling apart but you're
[1:27:52] not that statistic
[1:27:55] God's prepared God's prepared can you
[1:27:58] say amen amen every one of them that
[1:28:00] Moses said that Noah was preaching to
[1:28:02] the majority of them were going through
[1:28:04] the floods amen but there was an elect
[1:28:06] that God knew amen that would not be
[1:28:09] destroyed amen they would get in that
[1:28:12] Ark
[1:28:12] [Applause]
[1:28:17] you realize that this is the only time
[1:28:20] this is the only time that the mighty
[1:28:22] Angel has come down
[1:28:25] and it set his foot both
[1:28:27] on land and sea and has declared that
[1:28:30] time shall be no more
[1:28:31] it didn't do it in Noah's day but you
[1:28:33] would see what it was it was an End Amen
[1:28:36] it didn't do it in Jesus day but we see
[1:28:38] it was an end a dispensational law into
[1:28:40] Grace ain't that right but it's in this
[1:28:43] day that we're at the ends ends of the
[1:28:47] Earth and what has made it not just an
[1:28:50] end of an age not just the end of a of a
[1:28:54] message but it's the ends of the Earth
[1:28:57] amen everything is coming to its end
[1:29:01] because a mighty Angel has put his foot
[1:29:04] on land and sea amen if you really could
[1:29:07] understand what 1963 was all about amen
[1:29:11] right there amen it was an angel putting
[1:29:13] his foot on the land putting his feet on
[1:29:16] the sea he was the Overcomer and you're
[1:29:18] putting
[1:29:20] you're part of the body amen you're

[1:30:14] preaching uh Doom and Gloom to all
[1:30:17] people he's looking at a people and said
[1:30:19] now we're entering into a holy
[1:30:21] convocation now you know what the holy
[1:30:23] convocation is that's the eighth day

[1:30:28] with time it has nothing to do amen was
[1:30:31] here upon the Earth amen you are now
[1:30:34] going back to what was in God's mind at
[1:30:36] the foundation of the world that Eternal
[1:30:38] thought about you that Eternal
[1:30:40] representation about you amen that's
[1:30:43] where you're headed to we're entering
[1:30:45] back into what God had already thought
[1:30:50] all right
[1:30:51] the new day
[1:30:53] new day ain't they speaks of Eternity

[1:31:06] sons of God
[1:31:07] [Applause]
[1:31:10] can you say amen and I'll set this way
[1:31:13] there's never been an age like this age
[1:31:15] for the time for the sons of God to be
[1:31:17] manifested outside of this time
[1:31:20] oh that's what a prophet said so you can
[1:31:24] deal it with him amen but he says when
[1:31:26] has there ever been another time outside
[1:31:28] of this time amen that the sons of God
[1:31:30] were to be manifested outside this time
[1:31:33] right now can you say Amen think of it
[1:31:34] young people think of it you're living
[1:31:36] in the time for you not to manifest
[1:31:38] yourself as the genealogy of I know a
[1:31:41] lot of folks are going back to wanting
[1:31:43] to know their genealogy and where they
[1:31:44] come from all that that a prophet told
[1:31:46] you of a greater genealogy he told you
[1:31:49] you were in the mind of God Amen you are
[1:31:52] sons of God oh praise the name of the
[1:31:55] Lord I've identified myself not as the
[1:31:58] son of Duran Martin amen I don't care
[1:32:00] about the genealogy about my past in my
[1:32:04] pastors nothing about me that's good I
[1:32:06] remember there is a representation I am
[1:32:09] an eternal Son of God
[1:32:16] we're entering
[1:32:18] into that Holy convocation
[1:32:23] you know what that means it's we're all
[1:32:24] things everybody say all things
[1:32:26] become new
[1:32:28] a new Heaven
[1:32:29] A New Earth
[1:32:31] a new city a new people
[1:32:34] a new people
[1:32:36] No More Tears
[1:32:38] I knew people no more sadness I knew
[1:32:41] people a new civilization Donald Trump
[1:32:44] ain't gonna control this one Biden ain't
[1:32:47] going to control this one it ain't gonna
[1:32:48] be a Democrat versus Republican and
[1:32:50] versus independent and it ain't going to
[1:32:52] be Russia American Canadian or whatever
[1:32:54] amen this is a new contract this is a
[1:32:58] new city amen and the lamb will be the
[1:33:01] light thereof and believe it or not we
[1:33:04] already worshiping the king
[1:33:06] City we have already saw the city or the
[1:33:09] king of that City we've already seen
[1:33:11] that King Melchizedek in demonstration
[1:33:15] in this age and we're not ashamed to say
[1:33:18] it
[1:33:23] now I hope I'm not too scattered
[1:33:26] but it's a new kingdom
[1:33:28] it's going to be a new government
[1:33:30] then you say man
[1:33:32] the prophet said we are entering into
[1:33:33] that real genuine eternity where the
[1:33:36] church is called not to some station or
[1:33:39] some denomination but into
[1:33:42] eternity with their Eternal King no
[1:33:45] voting him out and no voting you out
[1:33:49] the prophet already said there's no one
[1:33:52] can take your place
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:59] not ashamed to say that we're living in
[1:34:01] the age of rapture
[1:34:05] this is the age
[1:34:07] where the dead in Christ
[1:34:09] is going to rise first
[1:34:11] and we which are alive and remain
[1:34:14] are going to be caught up to meet them
[1:34:16] to meet the Lord in the air
[1:34:18] this is the age
[1:34:20] where we are all going to be changed in
[1:34:22] a moment in twinkling of an eye
[1:34:24] you see this salvation is a change from
[1:34:26] Mortal to immortality it's a change from
[1:34:29] corruption to incorruption it's a change
[1:34:31] from the Earthly to the Heavenly it's a
[1:34:34] change from destruction and turmoil to
[1:34:37] Eternal peace amen what is it it's a
[1:34:39] full restoration
[1:34:41] are you with me you're following see
[1:34:44] it's a full restoration what Adam lost
[1:34:46] we are redeemed back to
[1:34:49] see this layout of CNA Church age is the
[1:34:53] age of restoration the prophet said it
[1:34:55] is also the age of complete uh blackout
[1:34:58] in apostasy it's the age of apostasy
[1:35:01] it's the age of the finished cycle with
[1:35:05] this it's all over
[1:35:09] then you say man do you understand you
[1:35:12] know I I've I've you know I've I've
[1:35:15] heard you know some preachers say you
[1:35:18] know they get on they just bad mouth
[1:35:19] message folks is saying that they're
[1:35:21] they're they're just stuck up they're
[1:35:23] you know they they high and mighty and
[1:35:26] this and that and this and that well I'm
[1:35:30] going to take up for him it's it's it's
[1:35:32] not that they're high and mighty they're
[1:35:34] just not as vulnerable
[1:35:37] as we used to be
[1:35:39] when we were in Pentecost
[1:35:41] when someone had a vision we and we
[1:35:44] followed when someone had a dream we
[1:35:47] followed when someone said they had a
[1:35:49] word from the Lord we were just so
[1:35:51] vulnerable and we just gulped it up amen
[1:35:53] we were gullible people but we have seen
[1:35:56] him can you say man we have seen him and
[1:35:59] we realize God ain't raising up another
[1:36:01] personality God ain't raising up another
[1:36:03] Ministry for us all together amen we
[1:36:06] don't have together in Jeffersonville to
[1:36:08] be in a rapture we don't have to gather
[1:36:09] in in Tucson to be in a rapture we don't
[1:36:13] have to gather eight men in Virginia or
[1:36:15] in Paul need to be in a Rapture can you
[1:36:17] say amen God is now coming and bringing
[1:36:20] us together to take us home
[1:36:26] then you say man it's a finished cycle
[1:36:30] hello it ain't your cycle after cycle
[1:36:33] after cycle it's not a repeat of what
[1:36:35] lives this is a change this is something
[1:36:38] new
[1:36:44] God God has a provided way in this day
[1:36:47] as he did in the days of Noah
[1:36:50] notice God had his Prophet know what to
[1:36:52] identify his promised word and the Ark
[1:36:56] was very fitting to the word of God that
[1:36:58] he spoke that he would destroy man
[1:37:01] but he saved what he could
[1:37:03] you say amen and God has an ark today
[1:37:07] do you believe that God's got an art
[1:37:09] today and I say it this way it's very
[1:37:11] fitting to the word of the age
[1:37:15] that has been spoken for this age now
[1:37:17] the prophet Noah pointed the people to a
[1:37:19] natural Ark but you know there were a
[1:37:22] lot of boats the prophet tells us there
[1:37:24] was a lot of boats being built amen and
[1:37:26] and they probably looked more promising
[1:37:28] than the one that Noah was building can
[1:37:31] you say Amen but see God's Prophet only
[1:37:34] pointed to one boat to one boat
[1:37:37] to one boat can you say man and that was
[1:37:40] the ark ain't that right so I'll say it
[1:37:42] this way there was no confusion about
[1:37:43] Noah's message amen it was just plain
[1:37:46] and simple get in the ark this is the
[1:37:49] one that's going to ride I believe with
[1:37:51] all my heart that Noah saw the vision of
[1:37:53] that Ark riding above the storms amen I
[1:37:57] just believe that he just was known in
[1:37:59] his heart amen that that God would show
[1:38:01] him know what don't be scared to build
[1:38:03] this art don't be afraid afraid to
[1:38:05] preach this art don't question this art
[1:38:07] don't don't just be assured and here's
[1:38:10] why Noah I'll show you and he saw the
[1:38:12] Ark of floating above all the storms he
[1:38:16] saw the Ark of floating can you say Amen
[1:38:19] oh yes sir amen see but do you you find
[1:38:22] amen that in this age amen we had a
[1:38:26] prophet in this age and and there's no
[1:38:29] confusion about his message amen it's
[1:38:32] the people it's the preachers that bring
[1:38:34] confusion amen whether we should have a
[1:38:37] five-fold minutes whether we should have
[1:38:38] just played tapes or whether we should
[1:38:40] do this or whether we should do that
[1:38:42] just say what the prophet said about it
[1:38:45] amen and you don't have to worry about
[1:38:46] it at all amen but he did not Point Amen
[1:38:50] to a natural Ark he pointed to another
[1:38:53] heart attack and that Ark is Jesus
[1:38:55] Christ
[1:38:55] [Applause]
[1:38:58] he introduced Jesus Christ to you and I
[1:39:04] then you say Amen
[1:39:06] now I'll say it this way the Christ that
[1:39:08] he introduced isn't the same that the
[1:39:10] Baptist and the Pentecostals and
[1:39:12] apostolics and methodists and
[1:39:14] denominations and most Independents are
[1:39:16] pointing us to
[1:39:19] they've introduced to Jesus Christ for
[1:39:21] years that wasn't the right Christ amen
[1:39:23] but in this day Jesus Christ the same
[1:39:25] yesterday today and forever has been
[1:39:28] introduced to us again can you say Amen
[1:39:30] so we find that the ark was the answer
[1:39:33] in Noah's day but Christ is the answer
[1:39:36] in this day look unto me and live ain't
[1:39:41] that right well can a person escape the
[1:39:43] wrath of God that's coming upon the
[1:39:45] Earth yes
[1:39:47] can a man live forever and ever yes can
[1:39:51] a man stand in the presence of God and
[1:39:53] not be condemned yes can a person
[1:39:56] actually be forgiven of their sins to
[1:39:58] where God doesn't remember them yes can
[1:40:02] you say Amen can a person actually live
[1:40:04] in a place where there's no sin and
[1:40:06] there's no sickness and there's no siren
[1:40:08] there's no loneliness and there's no
[1:40:10] trial and there's no Temptations oh yes
[1:40:12] amen Christ is the answer look unto me
[1:40:16] and be ye saved
[1:40:22] now
[1:40:27] if we are to look
[1:40:30] unto him then where do we look
[1:40:35] now notice
[1:40:37] the prophet said the Bible has the
[1:40:38] answer
[1:40:40] because it is the revelation of Jesus
[1:40:42] Christ being revealed since the
[1:40:43] foundation of the world
[1:40:45] he says Christ has been revealed in the
[1:40:47] form of prophets Christ has been
[1:40:48] revealed in in the form of Kings he has
[1:40:51] been revealed in the form of law givers
[1:40:54] you all know this quote he is the
[1:40:55] principal theme of the entire Bible if
[1:40:58] you read the Bible and don't see Christ
[1:40:59] in every verse of it go back and read it
[1:41:01] again if you can't see Christ in every
[1:41:04] verse of the Bible then you read it
[1:41:06] again because you miss something the
[1:41:08] Bible is Christ and he is the word can
[1:41:12] you say that with me Christ is the word
[1:41:16] Christ is the word oh aren't you glad
[1:41:19] for that now the prophet asked the
[1:41:22] question how will the people that's
[1:41:23] believe in him know it in other words
[1:41:25] know him unless they're constantly in
[1:41:28] the word to know what he is
[1:41:31] can you say amen amen if he's going to
[1:41:35] be revealed we got to look at him in
[1:41:37] other words in order to be saved ain't
[1:41:39] that right amen but you won't know it
[1:41:41] unless you're constantly in the word to
[1:41:43] know what he is brother Brown I'm in
[1:41:45] another place said if we're going to
[1:41:46] have an understanding of God it must
[1:41:49] come out of God's word so let's look at
[1:41:52] this now for a moment is this okay amen
[1:41:55] according to Revelations 3 and 9 Christ
[1:41:58] is true
[1:42:02] can you say that with me Christ is true
[1:42:04] Christ is true but the prophet said now
[1:42:07] this isn't saying that he is true versus
[1:42:09] that which is false so this isn't the
[1:42:12] comparison of true and false amen but
[1:42:15] Christ being true means that he is the
[1:42:18] perfect realization
[1:42:20] contrasted with partial realization in
[1:42:23] other words for example in the
[1:42:25] wilderness the bread Came From Heaven in
[1:42:28] the Old Testament came down from heaven
[1:42:30] but Jesus was the true bread which came
[1:42:33] from Heaven ain't that right so so the
[1:42:36] partial realization was the the natural
[1:42:38] bread amen the natural manner but the
[1:42:40] perfect realization was when Christ come
[1:42:43] and he says I am the true bread ain't
[1:42:46] that right in the Old Testament Israel
[1:42:48] had a lamb as a sacrifice amen but Jesus
[1:42:52] was the true lamb of sacrifice ain't
[1:42:55] that right Moses was a prophet a man of
[1:42:58] God but Jesus likened to Moses was the
[1:43:01] true prophet of God ain't that right
[1:43:04] they David was king of Israel but Jesus
[1:43:06] was the greater David for he was the
[1:43:09] king of kings and Lord of lords amen
[1:43:13] Solomon had a gift to discern between
[1:43:15] right and wrong amen but Jesus Christ
[1:43:18] was the true he was the greater than
[1:43:21] Solomon ain't that right amen see so
[1:43:25] what the world should have seen when
[1:43:27] they looked upon him back then amen they
[1:43:30] should have see Saul the perfect
[1:43:32] realization amen that the church World
[1:43:35] they had been offering the Lambs they
[1:43:37] had been offering their sacrifices they
[1:43:38] had been building the altars they had
[1:43:40] their high priest but when he came they
[1:43:43] should have seen the perfect realization
[1:43:45] amen for when he came the lamb was done
[1:43:48] away with when he come the high priest
[1:43:50] was done away with when he come the
[1:43:52] altar was done away with when he come
[1:43:54] the rituals and the religious systems
[1:43:57] was done away with for he was the
[1:44:00] perfect
[1:44:00] realization can you say amen he is the
[1:44:04] truth see everything in the Old
[1:44:06] Testament were just types and shatters
[1:44:08] amen that spoke of him but when Jesus is
[1:44:11] revealed there's no need for a type and
[1:44:14] Shadow
[1:44:15] there's no need for a natural lamb or a
[1:44:19] natural high priest for the true has
[1:44:21] come there's no need for a natural altar
[1:44:24] or a natural blood of an animal to be
[1:44:27] shed for we now have the true aren't you
[1:44:30] glad we have the true you don't have to
[1:44:32] go to God by building an altar and
[1:44:34] having a lamb and then the blood is all
[1:44:36] over you we've already got a blood that
[1:44:39] is a greater blood we've got a high
[1:44:41] priest that's a greater high priest amen
[1:44:43] it's not a natural high priest that he's
[1:44:46] at the very Throne of God sitting on the
[1:44:49] right hand of the father and he's
[1:44:50] interceding for you day and night he
[1:44:53] does not stop it's a greater
[1:44:55] intercession than what the pope can do
[1:44:58] it's a greater intercession than what a
[1:45:00] priest can do it's a greater thing
[1:45:06] brother Branham says the blood of the
[1:45:08] Lamb was all right until that day
[1:45:11] but now after crucifixion it changes the
[1:45:16] old system is done there was a new one
[1:45:18] the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb
[1:45:22] the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds
[1:45:25] oh aren't you glad for that amen I'll
[1:45:28] tell you this there's no need amen for
[1:45:30] Solomon to come and Reign and bring on a
[1:45:33] millennium amen you know the prophet
[1:45:36] said that Solomon's natural Reign amen
[1:45:38] represented the Millennium but we don't
[1:45:40] need him to come amen the true the true
[1:45:44] son of David has come
[1:45:46] and he's bringing on the true Millennium
[1:45:49] amen where there's no there's no uh
[1:45:53] enemy there there's no sin there's it's
[1:45:55] a millennial rain ain't that right so
[1:45:57] notice God is the word when the word the
[1:46:00] prophet said was in Moses he was God in
[1:46:03] flesh when it was in Jesus it was God in
[1:46:06] flesh they the only thing he'd done was
[1:46:09] change his mask not his word not his
[1:46:13] nature he is the same yesterday today
[1:46:16] and forever he only changed his form he
[1:46:20] changed from Noah to Moses he changed
[1:46:23] from Moses to David from David to Joseph
[1:46:26] on down till he come into the fullness
[1:46:30] of the godhead bodily so God was fully
[1:46:35] manifested in Jesus Christ can you say
[1:46:39] Amen you see the prophet told us that
[1:46:41] Moses was the word for he portrayed
[1:46:44] Christ Joseph was the word in his day
[1:46:47] amen portraying Christ each of them was
[1:46:50] the word portraying Christ but when
[1:46:53] Jesus come he was the word the true in
[1:46:59] its fullness
[1:47:02] can you say man the perfect realization
[1:47:04] amen had come well aren't you glad for
[1:47:08] that amen see so we we find a man that
[1:47:12] that God fully manifested now now notice
[1:47:15] the prophet said the spirit of God
[1:47:17] working down through the prophets till
[1:47:19] it come to full manifestation in Christ
[1:47:22] Jesus the whole Plan of Redemption laid
[1:47:27] in him it didn't lay in Moses it did lay
[1:47:31] in David it didn't lay in Joseph it
[1:47:33] didn't it only laid in him amen they
[1:47:37] were the word pointing to him
[1:47:39] can you say amen amen even the full
[1:47:42] Redemption didn't lay in that natural
[1:47:44] lamb or the high priest but what they
[1:47:46] were they were pointing pointing
[1:47:48] pointing he's coming he's coming he's
[1:47:50] coming hey remember when Jesus came he
[1:47:52] said I am him I am him I am that lamb I
[1:47:56] am that true bread I am the one I am
[1:47:58] that water can you say man he was the
[1:48:02] perfect realization
[1:48:06] see brother Brown said the whole plan
[1:48:08] wasn't in them they were pointing to it
[1:48:10] see uh but therefore after him the
[1:48:14] fullness we can't point to something
[1:48:16] else it points back to him the word
[1:48:19] so then after John uh introduced him
[1:48:22] what did he say he said I must decrease
[1:48:26] but heat must increase
[1:48:31] it had changed from the prophet to the
[1:48:32] prophecy
[1:48:37] and you say Amen
[1:48:42] well you love me
[1:48:45] is one thing to walk with John but what
[1:48:47] a greater thing to walk with the word
[1:48:52] it's one thing to be a part of the uh of
[1:48:55] John the Baptist ministry
[1:48:58] but it's another thing to be a part of
[1:49:00] Jesus's Ministry
[1:49:02] [Applause]
[1:49:05] then you say man I think people get
[1:49:06] confused of why brother Branham come
[1:49:11] [Applause]
[1:49:13] I thank God for a prophet
[1:49:15] [Applause]
[1:49:16] I'd love to be there in them days
[1:49:19] but I think I'm walking with something
[1:49:20] greater
[1:49:23] I think I'm part of something greater
[1:49:29] now I'm one I'm a big advocate of
[1:49:30] listening to them tapes and you should
[1:49:32] listen to them teeth but don't you get
[1:49:33] to the point that you can't have Revival
[1:49:35] because brother Branham ain't here
[1:49:39] that you can't walk with God because
[1:49:41] brother Branham ain't here
[1:49:44] we don't need another prophet Prophet
[1:49:46] come on the scene amen
[1:49:49] amen you are that Revival
[1:49:53] you're part of something that's greater
[1:50:00] than you say man
[1:50:02] [Applause]
[1:50:03] now notice when Jesus walked the Earth
[1:50:06] the Jews didn't look upon him or they
[1:50:10] did look upon him but they didn't know
[1:50:11] who he was and notice what Jesus said in
[1:50:15] John 5 9 39 search the scriptures
[1:50:19] search the scriptures
[1:50:21] search the scriptures for in them you
[1:50:23] think you have eternal life but they are
[1:50:25] they which testify of me
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:29] as brother Randall said brother Emmanuel
[1:50:30] he come out of the book come on
[1:50:33] come on he come out of the book his
[1:50:34] ministry come out of the book The Works
[1:50:36] that he did come out of the book the
[1:50:38] words that he said come out of the book
[1:50:40] his life that he lived come out of the
[1:50:42] book
[1:50:43] and he said every part of me is in the
[1:50:45] scripture search them
[1:50:46] in them you think you have eternal life
[1:50:49] that I don't care read Moses he
[1:50:51] testifies of me read Joseph he testifies
[1:50:53] of me read David he testifies of me read
[1:50:56] about Elijah he testifies of me can you
[1:50:59] say man why he come out of the book
[1:51:05] and it wasn't strange to those who were
[1:51:07] predestinated to see it that's all they
[1:51:10] could see
[1:51:17] now
[1:51:19] the prophet said the veil of tradition
[1:51:21] blinded the people to where they
[1:51:22] couldn't see him
[1:51:25] yet the Bible declared his full coming
[1:51:28] he come in the full revelation of the
[1:51:31] word
[1:51:32] and they were ashamed
[1:51:35] the church world was ashamed of him
[1:51:38] I want to just say this it's incredible
[1:51:40] how people get embarrassed
[1:51:43] of the truth
[1:51:46] but yet they'll accept anything that's
[1:51:48] not truth
[1:51:51] let David caress rise and see who
[1:51:53] follows
[1:51:54] let the Jim Jones's rise and see who
[1:51:56] follow us
[1:51:58] that when we say God sent a prophet Your
[1:52:00] Mother by oh you're of an occult
[1:52:04] we've seen the blood come out of hands
[1:52:06] we've seen the oil come out and we've
[1:52:08] seen gold teeth being filled with gold
[1:52:14] remember brother Bryce would you I don't
[1:52:16] know if he was there in them times
[1:52:18] LH Connors come held a meeting
[1:52:21] Dynamic preacher big old preacher
[1:52:25] had a three week I think almost a month
[1:52:27] at the Tulsa World to come out to the
[1:52:29] meetings carried a flashlight with him
[1:52:32] he had people come and needed the teeth
[1:52:34] filled with teeth field he'd have them
[1:52:38] to open their mouth and have anyone to
[1:52:39] come and watch it lay hands on them with
[1:52:41] that flashlight and you could sit there
[1:52:43] and watch gold come out of the teeth but
[1:52:45] it ain't scriptural
[1:52:50] come on now it's not scriptural
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:58] but they'll accept anything that's not
[1:53:00] truth because that's the way people are
[1:53:03] even Jesus told him John 5 43 I come in
[1:53:06] my father's name and you receive me not
[1:53:08] if another shall come in his own name
[1:53:10] him when he receive can you can you say
[1:53:12] amen amen but there's no promise of
[1:53:15] anything like that in the Bible see
[1:53:17] brother Branham says if there's a truce
[1:53:19] it must be by the word and Jesus said I
[1:53:23] am the truth
[1:53:24] [Applause]
[1:53:27] then you say amen I am the truth so when
[1:53:31] we look into him we're not looking at a
[1:53:33] lie we're not looking at some gimmick
[1:53:34] that a man has amen that's why we're not
[1:53:36] as vulnerable we've already seen him the
[1:53:38] truth we're not embarrassed to Proclaim
[1:53:41] he's the truth
[1:53:42] come on Church you're believing the
[1:53:45] truth
[1:53:46] this isn't a workup this isn't trying to
[1:53:49] get you into amen uh I'm buying the
[1:53:51] thing it ain't trying to reform you this
[1:53:54] is the power to change you
[1:53:58] it's the truth
[1:54:00] it's the truth it's God's provided way
[1:54:02] it's the truth
[1:54:04] [Applause]
[1:54:08] so Prophet says then what he does will
[1:54:11] be word based it will come from the word
[1:54:14] so as I said earlier God allotted his
[1:54:17] word to each age brother Brown said each
[1:54:19] generation reveals him in the full
[1:54:22] Revelation that's allotted for that time
[1:54:24] and he says this generation must
[1:54:27] everybody say must now we're going to
[1:54:29] get a personal must reveal Jesus Christ
[1:54:31] this generation must reveal Jesus Christ
[1:54:35] that's the revelation of him that's
[1:54:37] promised in the word it must be revealed
[1:54:41] to this generation
[1:54:47] oh my in the word allotted for this day
[1:54:50] Jesus Christ is to be revealed but how
[1:54:54] is he to be revealed here's another
[1:54:56] scripture that's applied for our age
[1:54:57] John 14 18 I will not leave you
[1:55:00] comfortless I will come to you
[1:55:04] [Applause]
[1:55:06] ain't that right amen the prophet said
[1:55:08] in the Old Testament when he came he
[1:55:10] came to the prophets for the word always
[1:55:12] comes to the prophet and his method has
[1:55:15] never changed
[1:55:18] can you say Amen his method has never
[1:55:20] changed
[1:55:22] oh so we'll go on 19th verse yet a
[1:55:25] little while and the world sees me no
[1:55:27] more but you see me because I live you
[1:55:30] shall live also at that day can you say
[1:55:33] that with me at that day now if you was
[1:55:36] in a Pentecostal if you was in a Baptist
[1:55:38] if he was all whatever you as Catholic
[1:55:40] or just none nothing amen and you were
[1:55:43] to read that scripture you would say
[1:55:44] what what day what day are we looking at
[1:55:46] was it the days of Jesus was it the days
[1:55:48] of Paul was it the days of ireneus what
[1:55:51] what day it is well here's a prophet
[1:55:53] that says at that day this day
[1:55:58] can you say that with me this day amen
[1:56:02] you shall know that I am in my father
[1:56:04] you and me and I in you
[1:56:09] so what was the Revelation the word that
[1:56:11] come to a prophet in this day was the
[1:56:13] revelation of where he is and who he is
[1:56:17] and it's in that day this day amen that
[1:56:20] we've heard a voice we've heard the
[1:56:22] Revelation we've caught it and now we
[1:56:24] know that he is in the father we are in
[1:56:27] him and he is in US
[1:56:32] can you say Amen so notice now that you
[1:56:35] shall know when the Revelation comes
[1:56:38] forth brother Brown said then it's I in
[1:56:41] you and you in me
[1:56:44] I don't care how smart you are in this
[1:56:46] message if you miss the revelation of
[1:56:48] where Christ is

[1:57:00] to lay hands on you

[1:57:09] you can have a good meeting is for me to
[1:57:11] come and preach to you you're missing it

[1:57:29] catch the revelation of a prophet's
[1:57:31] message and his ministry it will be he
[1:57:34] and you Christ in you and you and him
[1:57:38] the Revelation unfolded is Christ in you
[1:57:41] and you in him aren't you glad for that
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:57:48] listen now we're not supposed to make
[1:57:51] Christian converts to Christianity by
[1:57:53] government but by the Revelation
[1:57:55] everybody say by the Revelation the
[1:57:57] Christ in you

[1:58:48] to pass in that day that the light shall
[1:58:50] not be clear nor dark but it shall be
[1:58:52] one day which shall be known to the Lord
[1:58:55] not day nor night but it shall come to
[1:58:57] pass that at evening time it shall be
[1:59:01] light
[1:59:01] [Applause]
[1:59:04] thank God for the light
[1:59:06] why because at the evening time there
[1:59:08] shall be light there's gross Darkness
[1:59:10] upon the people and gross Darkness upon

[1:59:57] city that is set on a hill that cannot
[2:00:00] be hid

[2:01:03] changed masks
[2:01:06] it's the same light
[2:01:08] oh yeah we got Bible for it Matthew 24
[2:01:11] 27 for as the lightning cometh out of

[2:02:40] don't be ashamed of us going too far
[2:02:44] brother Brian said he ain't say nothing
[2:02:45] out of order yet
[2:02:52] this ain't this ain't fast songs going
[2:02:54] to work you up we were in Pentecost I
[2:02:56] know what it was like
[2:02:57] I know how to sing the songs that get
[2:02:59] you excited but this ain't it this is
[2:03:01] the word coming forth
[2:03:06] then you say Amen this is the revelation
[2:03:08] of God in you
[2:03:11] that has been made known in this day and
[2:03:13] you want me to sit there and act like I
[2:03:15] don't know it
[2:03:19] and act like I can't feel him
[2:03:22] and I clap I don't know what his power
[2:03:24] has done to me
[2:03:27] you're out of your mind
[2:03:37] Luke 17 28.
[2:03:39] like I like also as it was in the days
[2:03:42] of lot they did eat they drank they
[2:03:44] bought they sold they planted they build
[2:03:46] it but the same day that lot went out of
[2:03:49] Sodom it ringed fire and brimstone from
[2:03:51] heaven and Destroy them all even this
[2:03:55] now we all know that we're living in the
[2:03:57] days a lot we're living in the days of
[2:03:59] Noah and if you're a real message
[2:04:01] believer you'll know this one even thus
[2:04:03] it shall be in the day when the son of
[2:04:06] man is revealed how many believes the
[2:04:07] son of man has been revealed the son of
[2:04:10] man
[2:04:12] the son of man
[2:04:14] can you say Amen
[2:04:15] yes sir see so the prophet said the same
[2:04:18] light that Rose in the East is here in
[2:04:20] the west the same head that was here in
[2:04:22] the East is here in the west again can
[2:04:25] you say Amen but here it is he's not
[2:04:27] revealed to us he's not revealed to this
[2:04:30] world as a partial realization he's
[2:04:33] revealed as the true perfect
[2:04:36] [Applause]
[2:04:38] he's the perfect
[2:04:40] realization for he is true
[2:04:45] then you say man brother Brown said down
[2:04:48] through the church ages the word is
[2:04:49] taken on a veil through the reformers
[2:04:51] but it has finally come out into the
[2:04:54] complete
[2:04:55] [Applause]
[2:04:58] y'all ain't getting it are you
[2:05:00] it's finally come out to the complete
[2:05:04] see look he says this he said on the day
[2:05:07] of crucifixion the old Paschal Paschal
[2:05:09] Lamb passed away and Christ become our
[2:05:12] lamb at the day of crucifixion and the
[2:05:14] day that the denomination has crucified
[2:05:17] the word of God and accepted a Creed
[2:05:19] instead of the word that's the day the
[2:05:22] word has come into full effect
[2:05:25] and that's just been recently
[2:05:29] now I have to tell you I'm glad they
[2:05:32] crucified it
[2:05:35] because out of that crucifixion here I
[2:05:37] am
[2:05:40] can you say Amen I'm glad that the
[2:05:42] denominations kicked him out but also
[2:05:45] have a verse that says let us go beyond
[2:05:47] the camp go unto him beyond the camp and
[2:05:50] bear his reproach and I'm here to tell
[2:05:52] you there's a people that's not ashamed
[2:05:54] to bear his approach hey they've kicked
[2:05:57] him out amen but I'm not a part of that
[2:05:59] age I'm not a part of the layout of CN
[2:06:01] age I'm not a part of that
[2:06:03] denominational age that ran out when
[2:06:05] they crucified him but I've come unto
[2:06:08] him and the word has come into full
[2:06:11] effect I feel the word in my bones it's
[2:06:14] like a fire shut up I know I'm going in
[2:06:17] around
[2:06:18] Son of God I know I'm going to be
[2:06:21] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[2:06:23] an eye the word has come into effect
[2:06:32] bless the name of the Lord

[2:06:46] has come into full effect
[2:06:57] Hallelujah
[2:07:02] Hallelujah
[2:07:05] brother Brown said in the evening time
[2:07:07] the clouds will move away
[2:07:09] the denominations will fade
[2:07:12] and the same gospel everybody say the
[2:07:13] same gospel
[2:07:15] the same word made flesh as he promised
[2:07:18] in Luke 17 33 which was I believe he
[2:07:20] meant it's 30-30 the same gospel with
[2:07:24] the same thing would take place in the
[2:07:27] evening time just when the Shadows are
[2:07:29] getting low the same gospel the same
[2:07:32] Christ that lived in flesh back Yonder
[2:07:35] at the beginning on the Eastern people
[2:07:37] shall live again in not one in everybody
[2:07:41] say in notice the difference on the
[2:07:44] Eastern people shall live again in the
[2:07:47] western people at the end time
[2:07:51] and you can't miss it there's no way
[2:07:53] you'll miss this revival you did not
[2:07:56] stumble into this messenger God brought
[2:07:58] you to this message because he saw you
[2:08:01] in the beginning
[2:08:06] yes sir it's an evening light the son of
[2:08:09] man is revealed what is the evening like
[2:08:11] to do the prophet said to restore God is
[2:08:14] going to restore the whole word of God
[2:08:16] again the full manifestation of Christ
[2:08:19] in his church by shining forth the
[2:08:22] evening light notice in another place
[2:08:24] God in his fullness died for the sin of
[2:08:27] the people that he might bring to his
[2:08:29] church a Sanctified life that he might
[2:08:32] have the preeminence in fullness in his
[2:08:35] church to manifest every promise in
[2:08:38] these last days that he promised for the
[2:08:40] last days
[2:08:41] aren't you glad for that Amen brother
[2:08:44] Ram says what was Jesus manifested for
[2:08:47] to show God he was God he had to be no
[2:08:51] man could die no Prophet could die he
[2:08:54] was God he was the god of the prophets
[2:08:56] he was the prophets he was the king he
[2:08:59] was the history he that was he was that
[2:09:02] was to come he was that was he that is
[2:09:06] and he that to be in this day the same
[2:09:09] yesterday today and forever he was
[2:09:11] manifested for that purpose and through
[2:09:13] that purpose he achieved a church not
[2:09:16] going to achieve he's already achieved
[2:09:18] it that the he the fullness of God might
[2:09:21] bring to pass every promised word of God
[2:09:24] in these last days when he gets the
[2:09:27] preeminances in the church the position
[2:09:29] his place in the church somebody say his
[2:09:32] place his place don't worry about your
[2:09:35] position amen his place
[2:09:38] in you
[2:09:39] in the church
[2:09:41] then you say Amen
[2:09:43] you can be seated Jesus said he that
[2:09:45] believeth on me the works that I do
[2:09:47] shall you he do also even more than this
[2:09:49] shall he do for I go unto my father see
[2:09:52] that was his purpose there was the
[2:09:53] manifestation now everybody say now
[2:09:56] today he wants to get somebody that can
[2:10:01] so see it that they can let the word
[2:10:07] stop trying Slayer but I'll tell you
[2:10:08] what did I believe let the word flow
[2:10:11] let the word flow
[2:10:13] through them
[2:10:15] can you say Amen now notice Jesus so
[2:10:18] seen it so it was so perfectly born for
[2:10:22] that day until God expressed every move
[2:10:24] that he made he was God's revelation
[2:10:29] God revealed now he's Sanctified with
[2:10:32] his spirit and bloody church that he
[2:10:34] might make every promise in this last
[2:10:36] day be revealed now see he could go back
[2:10:40] and pick up what these other fellas has
[2:10:42] left off talking about that seventh
[2:10:43] angel in the last days and by his holy
[2:10:46] spirit reveal all the mystery of the
[2:10:48] Seven Seals he is everybody say he is
[2:10:52] expressing himself that's his purpose
[2:10:55] that's why he died that's his SEC the
[2:10:57] second fold of his threefold
[2:10:58] manifestation first to express himself
[2:11:01] in Christ then to express himself
[2:11:03] through the church and the same thing
[2:11:05] Christ was the word and the church
[2:11:07] becomes the word when it lets the word
[2:11:09] go through them
[2:11:13] so if I can say it this way the church
[2:11:15] if I say the church which is the body of
[2:11:18] Christ today
[2:11:19] is God's revelation
[2:11:21] Christ in a physical body was God's
[2:11:23] revelation but I'm telling you right now
[2:11:25] Christ in you is God's revelation the
[2:11:28] Church of the Living God today is God's
[2:11:31] revelation
[2:11:33] look
[2:11:36] look
[2:11:37] don't be ashamed
[2:11:39] when you look
[2:11:41] and be saved
[2:11:46] what's the mystery
[2:11:48] the mystery is revealed
[2:11:51] Christ in you
[2:11:55] he that is true
[2:11:58] can you say that with me he that is true
[2:12:01] is revealed
[2:12:03] in his bright body
[2:12:08] she has bone of his bone
[2:12:10] she is life of his life
[2:12:12] she is power of his power
[2:12:14] she is him
[2:12:19] look
[2:12:20] don't be ashamed when you look
[2:12:29] notice Enoch was our type
[2:12:32] Rahab was our type
[2:12:34] Esther was her type
[2:12:36] Ruth was our type Elisha was her type
[2:12:40] Caleb was her type
[2:12:43] the shunamite woman was her type I'm
[2:12:45] going to say something here The Ark was
[2:12:48] our type
[2:12:48] [Music]
[2:12:52] oh I don't know and we could go type
[2:12:54] after type after type after type after
[2:12:56] type that spoke of you
[2:13:01] and you say man
[2:13:03] so can I say it now
[2:13:05] we are not the shadow
[2:13:09] we are not the type
[2:13:11] we are the truth
[2:13:14] we are the perfect realization
[2:13:16] everything that they spoke of we are it
[2:13:18] what the ark spoke of we are hit
[2:13:23] what that shooting my woman then she
[2:13:25] spoke of us can you say Amen what Esther
[2:13:28] done she spoke of us we are it
[2:13:31] can you say Amen notice the church the
[2:13:34] prophet said the church is waiting on me
[2:13:36] and you adoption time when now no no
[2:13:39] notice now amen that was years and years
[2:13:42] and years ago I believe there's a church
[2:13:44] come into an adoption
[2:13:47] we're not waiting and waiting and
[2:13:49] waiting
[2:13:53] when God can pour into us his fullness
[2:13:56] his power his resurrection
[2:14:00] he didn't pour into Ruth his fullness
[2:14:03] she was attacked
[2:14:05] [Music]
[2:14:15] that when the church in Christ becomes
[2:14:16] so close together till Christ becomes
[2:14:18] visible Among Us
[2:14:23] I hope it's making sense
[2:14:25] and raises the dead and we go into the
[2:14:27] rapture I tell you this we are not
[2:14:29] waiting any longer
[2:14:31] the sons of God are being made
[2:14:32] manifested right now
[2:14:41] so again no longer a partial realization
[2:14:45] when you look when you look unto him
[2:14:48] you're not seeing him in a partial
[2:14:50] realization anymore
[2:14:52] you're not seeing him in a type and shot
[2:14:55] anymore
[2:14:59] we're not pointing to something to come
[2:15:01] he's coming he's coming he's coming
[2:15:05] we've been identified
[2:15:10] oh Church come on now we've been
[2:15:13] identified
[2:15:19] there is no need anymore for a natural
[2:15:21] Lester to sit on a natural throne
[2:15:23] there is no need for a natural ruse and
[2:15:25] a Boaz of the Old Testament to come
[2:15:29] there is no need for an Enoch to come in
[2:15:31] this day to fulfill the rapture
[2:15:34] there's no need for Samson to come and
[2:15:37] to destroy a natural enemy
[2:15:41] they were just types and shatters
[2:15:44] of what the church is today we are the
[2:15:46] perfect realization we are the true
[2:15:49] church
[2:15:51] can you say Amen so when he the perfect
[2:15:54] realization has come there is no need
[2:15:56] for partial realization
[2:16:03] that's why Baptist Doctrine ain't got
[2:16:04] nothing on us
[2:16:07] that's why there's nothing in this world
[2:16:08] that's appealing to us
[2:16:12] that's why revivals come and go it's not
[2:16:14] has nothing to do with us
[2:16:16] [Music]
[2:16:19] notice now the prophet speaking of
[2:16:21] Christ sit down through the age he
[2:16:23] showed it showed it in types knowing
[2:16:26] that someday the last type would be
[2:16:28] fulfilled and the full manifestation of
[2:16:31] his promise Messiah would be there and
[2:16:33] when the full promise come though he
[2:16:34] typed it day after day year after year
[2:16:36] he typed it and when it come to the
[2:16:39] reality they didn't believe it
[2:16:41] he has done the same thing typed it and
[2:16:43] showed it in the church ages and
[2:16:45] everything to the hour that we're living
[2:16:47] and people are in Gross Darkness seem
[2:16:49] like they just can't comprehend it
[2:16:52] such a sad thing
[2:16:55] if you allow me to go for a few more
[2:16:56] moments
[2:16:57] as it was in the days of Noah
[2:17:01] so shall it be in this day
[2:17:04] and I say so it is in this day
[2:17:08] so there's no need
[2:17:10] for a natural Noah
[2:17:11] to build a natural Ark
[2:17:14] God has sent a prophet to build a bride
[2:17:18] brother Brown brother Jonathan talked
[2:17:20] about it but here's brother Brown saying
[2:17:22] it amen God has chopped his bride from
[2:17:24] the denominations by his word promised
[2:17:27] by Malachi 4 in the last days chopped
[2:17:29] out his bride hewed her from the rest of
[2:17:31] the churches hewed out his bride another
[2:17:34] place just think right out of the midst
[2:17:36] of all of that and the church
[2:17:37] denominations and all their Seminary
[2:17:40] lewdness and everything God has took
[2:17:42] prophets His prophets words word and
[2:17:45] chopped out a bride that we'll believe
[2:17:47] said he would do it he's hewed from that
[2:17:50] thing what he promised he would do
[2:17:52] another place Malachi 4 is to bring back
[2:17:55] back to the original the bride smitten
[2:17:58] from the church because she is the word
[2:18:00] another place I think brother Jonathan
[2:18:02] quoted it she stands alone she is
[2:18:05] smitten from all the denominations
[2:18:07] according to Revelation 3 say don't
[2:18:09] don't be ashamed to stand alone
[2:18:12] don't be embarrassed to stand alone you
[2:18:15] go you know you you go to work and and
[2:18:18] no one knows that God sent a prophet
[2:18:19] don't be embarrassed to stand alone boys
[2:18:21] when you go to school wherever you're at
[2:18:24] don't don't don't you know my my
[2:18:25] daughter asked the other day says well
[2:18:27] why why doesn't people know if brother
[2:18:29] Brandon was so was so uh uh popular and
[2:18:32] well no why doesn't people know that
[2:18:33] today because gross darkness is upon the
[2:18:36] the people
[2:18:38] though God would come in flesh he is
[2:18:41] very physical body and do the works the
[2:18:43] people wouldn't know him but God never
[2:18:45] promised think of that God never
[2:18:47] promised to come in a physical body and
[2:18:49] land on the earth he promised to come
[2:18:51] into a bride
[2:18:55] can you say man it's all scriptures it's
[2:18:57] there's so many scriptures that pertain
[2:18:59] to this day more about his second coming
[2:19:02] than his first coming and he has done
[2:19:04] greater things in this in this time than
[2:19:07] he'd done in that time
[2:19:08] [Applause]
[2:19:11] that gross Darkness to traditions of of
[2:19:14] the veil of tradition is keeping the
[2:19:16] people blinded can you say Amen but she
[2:19:19] is smitten from all the denominations
[2:19:21] according to Revelations 3 she is
[2:19:23] smitten out of the church age layout is
[2:19:25] in church age that she was raised up in
[2:19:27] now notice and we get ready to close now
[2:19:30] God is preparing a church today to be
[2:19:35] saved just as he did in the days of Noah
[2:19:37] and that Ark and the body of Christ
[2:19:42] today is that Ark
[2:19:49] no need for a natural Ark
[2:19:52] you're the greater
[2:19:57] the natural Ark wouldn't Float On this
[2:19:59] day the natural Ark would not take you
[2:20:02] from this Earth to another Earth
[2:20:07] come on now God knows what Ark will meet
[2:20:10] the challenge for this day
[2:20:17] you will float
[2:20:19] you will make it
[2:20:22] because I don't and now I told you I I
[2:20:24] just think that Noah saw a vision of
[2:20:26] that art but I know the the prophet of
[2:20:28] this day saw the vision of this Ark
[2:20:32] I know he saw the vision of this Ark and
[2:20:34] he did not see her going down he saw her
[2:20:37] going up up up
[2:20:39] up up up
[2:20:40] and there was a people in that body in
[2:20:43] that Ark that was being carried away
[2:20:46] into the real Millennium into a new
[2:20:49] world Amen to where it is a new king a
[2:20:52] new city a new righteousness
[2:20:57] a millennial Reign the church his art
[2:21:00] today coming into his church which is no
[2:21:03] more than his own spiritual body here on
[2:21:06] Earth and I will tell you this Ark is
[2:21:09] very fitting
[2:21:12] to the word that's been spoken for the
[2:21:14] day
[2:21:15] and you say Amen
[2:21:17] so as Noah introduced The Ark in his day
[2:21:19] so as the prophet introduced The Bride
[2:21:21] of Jesus Christ in this day
[2:21:23] and he says she's him
[2:21:26] she is the very virtuous
[2:21:28] spotless sinless
[2:21:31] bride
[2:21:34] she stands justified in his sight
[2:21:37] what an introduction
[2:21:40] no he didn't introduce Baptist
[2:21:42] denomination Pentecostal Apostolic he
[2:21:46] didn't introduce all these denominations
[2:21:47] he says away with all of that
[2:21:50] away with all that
[2:21:52] oh man you love him
[2:22:07] only a prophet could know why nature is
[2:22:10] acting the way it is
[2:22:12] he says listen close
[2:22:15] when the little baby Christ was born
[2:22:17] three stars went together and made the
[2:22:18] one morning star that reflected the
[2:22:20] coming of an infant Christ a perfect one
[2:22:23] now what's happened we see a roar in the
[2:22:25] paper across the television across the
[2:22:27] Nations where five stars just fell in
[2:22:29] line with the world what's five a number
[2:22:31] of Grace every time those stars come
[2:22:33] then something happens on the earth what
[2:22:36] taking place five stars fell in what was
[2:22:39] it and introducing
[2:22:42] of what
[2:22:45] since then notice just look what's taken
[2:22:47] place Germany almost washed off the map
[2:22:50] some of the Mad guys says that the world
[2:22:52] would burst like a watermelon every
[2:22:54] distressful things that's prophesied by
[2:22:56] them for the last days look what's taken
[2:22:58] place England the other day a storm that
[2:23:00] blowed away 70 000 houses in one day
[2:23:04] disasters everywhere California Los
[2:23:06] Angeles like to wash into the ocean what
[2:23:08] is it the beginning of Sorrows
[2:23:10] earthquakes have picked up everywhere
[2:23:11] why
[2:23:13] five stars come in line Grace
[2:23:16] God's grace
[2:23:18] what's happened
[2:23:19] why
[2:23:22] now he's not going to give us a
[2:23:23] scientific answer
[2:23:26] he's not going to even give us a church
[2:23:27] answer
[2:23:30] he's going to give us a revelation
[2:23:32] a prophet could give
[2:23:35] an infant Church
[2:23:37] Hallelujah a bride infancy that the
[2:23:42] power of God has begun to fall on her
[2:23:44] she's taking form a bride for this
[2:23:48] bridegroom
[2:23:49] that three stars meant his Perfection of
[2:23:53] the heavenly father of the Trinity
[2:23:54] becoming one on earth Among Us God's
[2:23:57] office is becoming one
[2:23:58] what happened now is the Church of the
[2:24:01] Living God coming together under the
[2:24:03] word of God and the astronomic heaven is
[2:24:06] announcing her approach
[2:24:09] do you love him
[2:24:11] oh my I love him
[2:24:18] First Corinthians 12 13 for by one
[2:24:20] Spirit are we all baptized into one body
[2:24:24] and we know that is the body of Christ
[2:24:26] the church is his body ain't that right
[2:24:28] and when you're baptized into the body
[2:24:30] the ark then you're free from sin
[2:24:34] ain't that right so God doesn't see you
[2:24:36] no more he sees Christ God can the
[2:24:39] problem said God can't judge that body
[2:24:41] he's already judged it he took our sins
[2:24:43] took our judgments and has invited us in
[2:24:48] so see as the Ark of Noah's day was
[2:24:51] predestinated to meet the challenge so
[2:24:53] is the church predestinated in this day
[2:24:55] to meet the challenge of of of this can
[2:24:58] you say man
[2:25:00] hey man uh we we we can go uh hear uh
[2:25:05] the church being identified brother
[2:25:07] Brown said she is his body the
[2:25:09] manifested truth of his promised word
[2:25:11] for the last days and she alone stands
[2:25:15] by it another place by the Holy Spirit
[2:25:18] baptized baptism we are baptized into
[2:25:20] that body and are free from sin God
[2:25:23] don't see you no more he only sees
[2:25:25] Christ aren't you glad for that and when
[2:25:28] you're in that body God can't judge that
[2:25:30] body he's already judged it he took our
[2:25:31] judgments and invited us to him another
[2:25:34] place if you're born again into the body
[2:25:36] of Christ and God looks upon you as a
[2:25:39] perfect as Christ was himself
[2:25:42] oh Lord
[2:25:43] and the traditional Veil is keeping the
[2:25:47] people from seeing him
[2:25:49] he says it's a spiritual Veil that's
[2:25:51] over the people say well I'm Methodist
[2:25:53] I'm as good as anybody I'm Baptist I'm
[2:25:55] Pentecostal don't you realize it that
[2:25:57] thing is a traditional Veil and it's
[2:25:59] hiding God from you that's the things
[2:26:01] that's keeping you from enjoying all CC
[2:26:04] oh you say well I'd shout and I jump up
[2:26:06] and down he said every word every Eve
[2:26:09] believed every word but one see it's the
[2:26:11] full word of God the promise of this
[2:26:13] hour made manifest another place he says
[2:26:16] if a man can't break that veil of
[2:26:19] tradition and break through that that
[2:26:20] wall of denomination to see God in his
[2:26:23] power it's death
[2:26:25] can you say Amen so again as I've said
[2:26:28] we're not seeing him through a type and
[2:26:30] a shadow anymore or as a type in a
[2:26:33] shadow but we are seeing him that is
[2:26:35] true a perfect realization can you say
[2:26:38] amen and where are we looking at him
[2:26:41] where are we we're looking at the open
[2:26:44] book
[2:26:45] and Paul said it's a mirror
[2:26:49] and you say Amen what is the word of God
[2:26:51] it's a mirror
[2:26:53] and you say man notice if you remember
[2:26:56] there in in Revelations 5 when the lamb
[2:26:59] had taken the book and loosed the seals
[2:27:01] thereof John says every creature which
[2:27:03] is in heaven and on the earth and under
[2:27:05] the Earth and such as are in the sea and
[2:27:07] all them that are in heard I saying
[2:27:11] blessing and honor and glory and power
[2:27:13] be unto him that sitteth upon the throne
[2:27:16] and unto the lamb forever and ever and
[2:27:19] brother Brown says why what would cause
[2:27:21] John to do this he said he must have saw
[2:27:24] his name in the book
[2:27:28] can you say man he must have saw his
[2:27:30] name and as I said before amen I don't
[2:27:33] believe it was just that he turned a
[2:27:34] book uh you know turn now you know the
[2:27:37] book open and he saw his name on just a
[2:27:39] page but I believe that every promise
[2:27:42] every promise of God in the book John
[2:27:46] saw his name there
[2:27:49] then you say amen and we know that that
[2:27:53] was a type John was a type of the Bride
[2:27:55] for this age for it was in this age amen
[2:27:59] Revelations 10 the mighty Angel come
[2:28:02] down with an open book in his hand and
[2:28:04] Revelations 10 7 it says but in the days
[2:28:07] of the voice of the seventh angel and he
[2:28:10] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[2:28:12] should be finished as he hath declared
[2:28:15] to his servants the prophets the prophet
[2:28:17] said this the first thing that
[2:28:18] represented that Redemption come the
[2:28:20] lamb that had been slain from the
[2:28:21] foundation of the world he took the book
[2:28:24] he opened the book and tore off the
[2:28:25] seals and sent it down to the Earth to
[2:28:28] his seventh angel to reveal it to his
[2:28:31] people can you say Amen to reveal see
[2:28:35] and I say to you the Revelation has been
[2:28:39] made known we don't need him to come
[2:28:42] back and make the Revelation known to us
[2:28:44] we just need to look
[2:28:47] oh
[2:28:48] not to the veil of tradition not to your
[2:28:51] own the veil of your imagination but
[2:28:54] through the veil of Revelation can you
[2:28:56] say Amen the eye of Revelation and we
[2:28:59] see him as not he is the alpha can you
[2:29:02] say that with me he is the alpha but it
[2:29:05] doesn't stop there he is omega
[2:29:06] he is the beginning
[2:29:09] he is the ending he is the first
[2:29:12] he is the last
[2:29:15] can you say Amen now notice first John 5
[2:29:18] 20 and we know that the Son of God has
[2:29:21] come and hath given us an understanding
[2:29:24] that we may know him that is true and we
[2:29:30] are in him that is true even in his son
[2:29:34] Jesus Christ this is the true God and
[2:29:38] eternal life so think of that we are in
[2:29:41] him
[2:29:44] that is true what an understanding
[2:29:47] amen Ephesians 1 4 according as he hath
[2:29:51] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[2:29:53] of the world that we should be holy and
[2:29:55] Without Blame before him unless
[2:30:00] so you are the attribute of his thinking
[2:30:04] we talk about the word bride becoming
[2:30:05] word bride well you couldn't be word
[2:30:07] bride unless you was a thought
[2:30:13] because the word is an expression of a
[2:30:15] thought
[2:30:18] can you say man
[2:30:19] so to be word bride you had to be in his
[2:30:21] thinking his thoughts again you say amen
[2:30:25] and so the types and shadows are only ex
[2:30:28] only expressing what was in God's mind
[2:30:31] it's just like Adam and Eve and I'll
[2:30:33] close but Adam and Eve was not the real
[2:30:34] thing
[2:30:37] they only reflected the real true thing
[2:30:40] Adam was not Jesus Christ
[2:30:42] he was only a type of Jesus Christ Eve
[2:30:46] was not the Bride of Jesus Christ she
[2:30:48] only reflected the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:30:51] can you say Amen in the mind of God he
[2:30:53] wanted to be bridegroomed but he
[2:30:55] couldn't be that an Adam only in Jesus
[2:30:58] Christ could it be
[2:31:00] in God's thoughts he wanted to come
[2:31:02] bright
[2:31:04] but he couldn't be that in Eve only in
[2:31:06] the church he could become bright
[2:31:09] then you say Amen
[2:31:10] but yet through Adam and Eve there it
[2:31:13] shows the relationship of Christ and his
[2:31:15] bride
[2:31:18] ain't that right
[2:31:20] yes sir
[2:31:22] so we see how we are his wife
[2:31:25] amen as I've said before there's a
[2:31:27] three-fold revelation of Adam
[2:31:29] in spirit form
[2:31:31] God said let there be
[2:31:33] let us make man in our own image brother
[2:31:35] Brian said the man existed you just
[2:31:37] couldn't see him
[2:31:39] he was in spirit form
[2:31:41] but then we see the second fold of Adam
[2:31:43] and that was Adam in flesh form
[2:31:47] if you had something in him that you
[2:31:48] could not see
[2:31:50] that needed to be expressed
[2:31:52] in the third revelation of Adam was Adam
[2:31:54] and Bride for him
[2:31:56] she was Adam
[2:31:58] and so much that her name was Adam
[2:32:01] can you say Amen
[2:32:03] but we don't need Adam and Eve to come
[2:32:05] back
[2:32:07] we are the true
[2:32:10] and we will not be deceived
[2:32:14] we will not
[2:32:17] what a communion with our Lord
[2:32:21] water relationship we have with him
[2:32:24] if the musicians will come
[2:32:27] oh we could go on and on and on
[2:32:36] you know
[2:32:39] there had to be a door to that art
[2:32:45] right
[2:32:47] the Bible says only once by one spirit
[2:32:51] it wasn't a denominational spirit
[2:32:54] it wasn't a church spirit
[2:32:56] religious spirit
[2:32:58] it wasn't a politic Spirit it wasn't the
[2:33:00] world spirit
[2:33:02] it had to be one spirit
[2:33:05] one spirit that would get you into the
[2:33:07] ark
[2:33:10] the prophet said at Noah that day when
[2:33:13] he introduced the art
[2:33:15] and began to tell preacher's message
[2:33:17] come
[2:33:19] Noah stood at the door
[2:33:23] of the Ark
[2:33:25] Noah
[2:33:27] the prophet
[2:33:28] stood at the door
[2:33:31] of the Ark he didn't stand at the end of
[2:33:34] the Ark
[2:33:34] he didn't stand away from the ark and
[2:33:36] say go go he stood at the door of the
[2:33:39] Ark and anybody that come into the ark
[2:33:42] had to pass through the prophets
[2:33:45] you had to look in the direction of the
[2:33:47] prophet
[2:33:49] don't get your eyes all on the prophet
[2:33:52] look at what he was standing at
[2:33:58] can you say man
[2:34:01] he was standing there introducing the
[2:34:03] door
[2:34:06] this is the way
[2:34:08] so there'd be no confusion on how to get
[2:34:10] into the the ark
[2:34:12] this is the way here I am come come come
[2:34:14] come come right here see the prophet was
[2:34:17] he didn't want no one to miss it
[2:34:20] right if I stood on the end of the Ark
[2:34:22] say it's over there but where well over
[2:34:24] there
[2:34:25] but where I don't know no no I gotta
[2:34:28] stand by the door y'all stand out the
[2:34:31] door and say come
[2:34:32] right here don't get any other ideas
[2:34:34] that there's another North there's
[2:34:35] another way into this Ark I'm right here
[2:34:37] [Music]
[2:34:40] I'm going to tell you something Jesus
[2:34:41] says I am that door
[2:34:44] and you know what even in Revelations
[2:34:46] John the third chapter said he saw an
[2:34:48] Open Door
[2:34:49] and in the in the fourth chapter of
[2:34:51] Revelations John said I saw a door open
[2:34:53] in heaven
[2:34:56] sign door
[2:34:58] Christ is the door
[2:35:02] see he this this prophet in this day
[2:35:05] wasn't inducing a natural door
[2:35:08] he didn't point to a natural Church
[2:35:11] he didn't point to a natural thing
[2:35:14] Peter says that an entrance shall be
[2:35:17] preached unto you
[2:35:21] I know the Pentecostals think they've
[2:35:23] got the spirit and everybody else is
[2:35:24] claiming to have their Spirit but I'm
[2:35:25] telling you this there's a one door into
[2:35:28] this body and the prophet stands at that
[2:35:31] door
[2:35:32] it ain't emotions that's going to get
[2:35:34] you in it's not Sensations that's going
[2:35:35] to get you in
[2:35:38] can you say Amen it's not gifts that's
[2:35:40] going to get you in you've got to stand
[2:35:42] beside the door can you say Amen look at
[2:35:45] it where the Prophet is standing he's
[2:35:47] introduced to us Christ and Christ is
[2:35:49] the Dynamics
[2:35:52] and the prophet said in this in another
[2:35:54] place the message is Christ don't you
[2:35:57] separate Christ from this message you'll
[2:36:00] miss the door
[2:36:02] [Music]
[2:36:06] well we need to be more like
[2:36:08] Pentecostals you better just stay at the
[2:36:10] door
[2:36:11] go into the door where the Prophet stood
[2:36:13] [Applause]
[2:36:16] oh now I wish I could preach
[2:36:18] let's stand to our feet
[2:36:21] God bless you you love him

[2:36:48] the things of this Earth
[2:36:52] will grow strange
[2:36:55] [Music]
[2:37:06] have you ever wondered why the prophet
[2:37:08] would tell the story of that boy
[2:37:11] [Music]
[2:37:12] he had never seen the mirror before
[2:37:14] [Music]
[2:37:19] he didn't know what it was like

[2:37:52] [Music]
[2:37:54] he moved a certain way and the boy moved
[2:37:56] a certain way
[2:37:57] [Music]
[2:37:59] his mom's standing back there watching
[2:38:01] him
[2:38:03] as he's discovering himself
[2:38:07] and the Revelation the understanding
[2:38:09] caught
[2:38:11] he said but mama
[2:38:14] that's me
[2:38:19] I thought how proud God must be in this
[2:38:21] age
[2:38:24] he would send a prophet to labor and
[2:38:26] labor and that profit wouldn't be bought
[2:38:29] the prophet wouldn't be dissuade
[2:38:32] they brought the mirror before the
[2:38:34] people
[2:38:37] God stands there watches
[2:38:41] [Music]

[2:39:40] to the discovery
[2:39:41] of Who We Are
[2:39:43] [Music]
