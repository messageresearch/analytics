of the Lord and um amen and um trust all as well I I hear there are some that's feeling a little little puny this morning and um uh so we we are praying for you and those that are here and those that are are at home but uh we're sure we're sure thankful to the Lord thankful to the Lord for his uh hand of protection for brother Michael and sister Amy's house and uh a lot of structures uh burnt in here in Oklahoma uh the last couple days and uh uh I don't know somewhere between 50 and 80 homes in still water that was burnt and and from what I'm hearing uh Manford is totally gone business and and uh uh homes and and so um uh we're just we're just thankful for for God 's hand of of protection and and um amen and matters of fact why don't y'all be seated we we just uh we thought we would share a few pictures of the uh of of the fire and and um this this is the excitement for those that was just doing it by phone and um so the the the fires had had come in um in the pastor back behind brother uh Michael's house and this is actually in another man's pasture and so they they had brought in a a bulldozer and was uh digging trenches and then Patrick was uh coming behind with a tractor and I don't know if we if if we got but the fire just kept on coming and um so the brothers were out there with their buckets and four-wheeler and and water and and and uh uh fighting that fire and um and so it you know they they just they had kept on coming and and and the fire would just would you know would jump and and and and go over them at one time they were um the brothers were were surrounded the fire came all the way around them now this here is on the home front this is this is my brother Michael's house and so um uh go back to that other picture there brother uh Patrick brought that tractor over and um was was clearing all of that grass through there and uh making a a long line through there and and um of course there was a few of us they don't have the best water pressure so we're there with water um helping where we can you know and um so there's that there's their house and um uh there's you know continuing working around around there you can see the smoke all in the area I mean these all of these brothers I'll have everyone stand up uh here in a minute we had a we had a we had our own fire crew out there amen and um uh they're they're out there mowing you you'll see I think it might have been on that last picture there where they were mowing they had lawnmowers out there trying to uh mow down that brush out there in the pasture and um and so we dug trenches these young men dug trenches of them and and then some then the other brothers come in and and and was helping and um this is this is the water on the houses and you didn't know that was going to be go in on the video did you so there are some of the guys uh we didn't we didn't take get get a get a group picture but those guys had just came back in and um so we thought we thought life was good and and um we were all patting each other on the back and job well done and and um actually went to go get us something to eat and we came back and from the road it was glowing it there it was glowing and um we got this we got a message uh Sister Amy she you know pray pray pray Patrick is trapped we come we come through there and I mean it is blade right there with their intersection it is fire and uh so we we we go back in there and um their house is surrounded with fire and you you can see the glow on all the way around [Music] and um and the Lord protected that home the the the out building there was on fire there were some trees that kept catching fire and U so we had put we had put the fire out watch those Embers blowing it was so windy 60 MPH gust though that that's what kept the fire spreading and so so uh ultimately uh it would just keep going and and and keep blowing and um and it was just it it was crazy so this is the next morning I jumped on the house you can see it's all charred out [Music] there and um it's still smoldering if you can sit back there in the back it's all smoldering back there in the hills and and um but you know what the Lord kept that from from coming and so you can see where Patrick where you where you had done that deal there it didn't it didn't jump on the other side there it just went on around and so putting that putting uh doing that with the tractor did keep that fire from coming over and getting that building and then it just worked its way on around and um but you say well it was just the green grass there I want to tell you that wind was blowing so there were sparks flying everywhere brother Joe was out there and he I was I I wasn't out there in the main in the main deal as I say we were we were doing we were preparing around the house there just in case it came but the guys were out there uh they actually saved their neighbor's house Mike um I don't know what aters haen and um uh they they were all out there fighting and it and and saved his his home and we had thought that it it stopped there but it jumped and uh came on over and so um so you can you can see um and there was there was a lot of Cedars a lot of Cedars around and and um so we're just we're just thankful so uh I wonder if the fire crew would would want to stand up here everyone that was all involved in working Heen we want to give you a hand clap for coming over yeah come on stand up so we we appreciate everyone all jumping in there and and um what I what I was fixing to say was brother brother Joe had called and said that U he said it's it it's just amazing he said it was it was just a coming and then that wind started turning around the other way and blowing it the other direction and and and and and just put it out and and you know just just things like that and I I believe the Lord heard our prayer we we seen um um you know as as as we as I was going towards uh Cleveland there was a lot of green just Green Yard grass that was totally charred uh uh so so the Lord you know it's just isn't it isn't it so wonderful that the Lord is so mindful to his people I know things you know in one sense brother Michael could have probably got him a new house but in another sense all all of the childhood memories and the pictures and the you know those things are precious and and for the Lord to to do that was was just wonderful and we thank the Lord for that and so we I thought I would share that here this morning amen and um and so we uh I'm just glad to belong to the to to the family of God Amen uh brother uh you should have seen everyone's eyes beat red even the next morning everyone that I seen their eyes were all puffy and swollen and and uh even Josh had he he went into the doctor yesterday and he was throwing up all night and and uh got a little bit too much of that smoke in his lungs and and uh and so he's not feeling even the best this morning but but but he's he's but he's wasn't that a beautiful song this morning I love that song Amen so anyways um all right if you want to stand to your feet and we'll we'll turn to the book of Deuteronomy the second chapter and uh we'll read here at the at the first uh verse read the first three [Music] verses and um this will be just a um you know maybe a simple thought here this morning um but I I want to take a a text out of these especially the third verse there but it says then we turned and took our journey into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me and we compass Mount SE many days and the Lord spake unto me saying you have compassed this mountain long enough turn northward and I want to minister this morning we have compassed this mountain long enough let's go to the Lord in prayer father we have been so honored to see what you have done for your people yet again and Lord how that you have spared not only brother Michael's sister Amy's home but Lord also the Lancaster's home Lord and and father even as they evacuated and the the fire came up within a half mile 3/4 of a mile from their home destroyed many homes but Lord you protected theirs and Lord altto together Lord I and also thinking of of even brother Jonah's home and and his brother Caleb's Lord and how good you have been to us Lord father we we not we don't take that lightly Lord we're thankful for the brothers and thankful for their willingness to help Lord but ultimately if you're not with us it it does not much good Lord and we thank you for your blessings and keeping us safe and but Lord Here We Stand today and we ask Lord that your Holy Spirit would be among us here this morning and that you would speak to our hearts Lord we've got some babies that aren't feeling well and I pray father that you would heal them and make them whole and touch those Lord and sister titha with a fever and the the different ones who weren't feeling well I pray that you'll be with them Father we just ask Lord now that you would speak to us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated I as I think about this uh thought this morning we have compassed this mountain long enough and and just a simple thoughts and knowing the hours that we're living in that we are truly in the in the last of the last of times and uh brother Malachi it's good to see you amen today and uh seen you but I forgot to recognize you amen good to have you this morning but um you know uh we there there is a there is an urgency and there is a a a a Time brother Brandon would preach sermons amen uh about the builders not being able to turn not being able to make the corner amen and as God makes the corner uh if God's if the plans say to turn the corner then we want to turn the corner When God Says time is over and he has declared that time shall be no more that's already been spoken amen and we have seen since 1963 that the Declaration amen uh that God had spoke in in the in the message of indictment amen the kingdoms of this world have Begin to Fall they have begin to fall to the ground and so we understand that we are living in an hour that we are preparing not to go through another church age not to go back around the mountain again but we are here looking and and and the the the amen the the prophet even uh uh preached a message on this same scripture here and and he titled it turn northward something was fixing to take place the third pull was fixing to come into effect amen but today so many years after the opening of the seals I am declaring it's time for us to take this amen this powerful sword and let's go northward let's Proclaim can you say Amen now when this was proclaimed amen it it would have been easy for Israel to to think amen that the promised land was just around the corner they they would have a hard time believing that the promised landine would be 40 years away amen it it was only I I I believe somewhere 300 miles between Egypt and and and and the go or and the promised land amen you could drive that from Egypt uh you know to Israel in about 15 hours you could amen today with with in modern in modern time amen they say that you could walk it in about four to five weeks amen but but you see uh uh because Israel um had they they in the in the wilderness of testing they they couldn't quite catch the revelation of who they were they never could see themselves as the possessors of that land and God could not take them into that land until they seen themselves as the possessors because if they didn't see them themselves as the possessors they were for sure going to get slaughtered amen by the Giants in that land amen that's right a and and so amen God was good to them God was always so uh uh kind and amen and he would work his his his word and his will through uh uh throughout the Wilderness they they came through the Red Sea and amen and and they were dancing in the spirit and shouting and praising God and amen all of their their slave masters were dead the Chariots were amen were in the bottom of the sea the amen uh Pharaoh's Army had all disappeared before them oh what a what a great time that they had they amen they were they were blessed you see amen every time that they had a need amen they they knew that God had given them a prophet and they had seen the Passover Lamb uh that had been given to them for the sin the angel of the Lord was their was their God the prophet was their instructor they they they felt good amen and but but Israel had a problem they served God on an emotional level and not by divine revelation they served God Amen based upon amen all the work wonder ful works of God but the next time they got in a pinch amen their emotions got the best of them and they would say oh would to God we would have stayed in Egypt oh have you brought us out here to die oh Moses who do you think you are there's other great men around here amen what do you mean you're the you're the prophet of God they were always looking at things on the emotional level and they could not catch a revelation that they are no longer slaves but that they are the possessors of a land amen and if we're going to be a possessor of of any promise of God Amen we're going to have to see ourselves as the possessors we're going to have to walk into that land not hoping we're going to amen win not hoping we're going to be able to overcome but we've got to know that greater is he that is with in us than he that is within that world that God is with us can you say amen amen hallelujah you see the grace had brought him through amen Moses wrote a song of Victory and Miriam led the sisters in a dance and amen they were beating the tambourines while singing the songs of Victory the the task Masters were dead but then the next day there they were complaining and and and and thinking oh amen I I I I just don't know I I I don't know if we can make it I I don't know if we'll be well praise the Lord can you say Amen you see amen you God has got a promise for us how many believes that today God's got a promise amen now brother Brandon would say that the Wilderness was the Wilderness of testings Hallelujah amen the Wilderness was the testing grounds for the sons of God Amen now they and and I I I want us to to to really think of that because as I'm talking about Israel for a few moments here I want you to catch where we have been in the church ages we've gone through seven Church ages that have been wandering around in the wilderness we have seen the supernatural presence of God Amen God raised up Great Men the supernatural was was was an incredible thing but they would go down Generation by generation Amen in unbelief because when the testing come they could not see themselves they would form denominations amen and say we can go no further than this and amen when you try to put God in a box that just isn't going to work amen God will not be put in a box but you see when you walk with God and that's something that amen every one of us should have in our personal experience there is never to be a period put on your experience you should never put a period always put a comma amen you amen you're thankful for what God done yesterday you're thankful for what God is doing today comma and I know God is going to do something tomorrow amen God's going to keep on working amen you in your Amen in your uh HH uh uh in your mind and and your emotion status may feel like God cannot but I'm here to tell you that the Revelation that has been given to us in this day has declared that God is not the god of a natural man but God is the supernatural that is working and walking through Humanity amen you're living in your bodies you're living in amen you you you've got your families you've got your jobs you've got the things and we all enjoy them but remember everything we've got has a comma it is here amen it's here to pass are you hearing me amen where I'm at today I cannot get rooted I cannot get settled it is time to keep marching on we've got a Rapture that we are coming into amen that's right but you see Israel amen they had seen the supernatural and they knew it was God but they could not see themselves as the possessors of the promises of God Amen they would question the God who brought them out amen why have you brought us out and they would denominate around the uh emotional reasoning instead of walking by faith in the word of God Amen instead of saying God I don't know how you're going to do it I don't know about brother so and so or sister so and so but I believe your promise and I'm going to follow that Pillar of Fire can you say Amen you see the mountain of Temptation become the mountain of defeat amen it become the mountain and they circle around that mountain oh brother amen don't let us circle around the mountain amen let's not do brother Brandon would talk about the death walk amen and how amen that they would go in circles and they get lost in the wilderness thinking they knew where they were going but it was nothing but a death march until they would just go insane amen and die there in the wilderness can you say Amen but I want to say there is a man who can turn on the light I want to say that the supernatural that gave you the call is the one who has said I've called you to possess amen not just yes but possess eternity keep on marching on can you say Amen hallah amen now there is a generation I I want us to read and and if you want to turn I I think it's um it was quite a testament amen is and I I think it again this speaks of the church ages amen Psalm 78 and3 and we're going to just read down it's a real long chapter but we'll read for a while and I and I I I want you to amen just just you know look look at the church ages to where we've been and and and as we start out amen he he's going to he says I I want you to tell a generation that that they I want you to remind them of what the old Generations were and and how they've all died in defeat but I want you to let them know amen that God can use them and anoint them can you say amen amen it says Psalm 78 and3 which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children showing to the generation to come the Praises of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful Works which he hath done for he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel which he had which he commanded our fathers that they should make known to their children that the generation to come might know them somebody say the generation to come Hallelujah I want to say we are the generation that has come turn to your neighbor and say we are that generation that has come amen even the children which should be born who who should arise and declare them to their children that they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God but keep his Commandments and not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious Generation generation that set not their heart a right whose Spirit was not setfast with God the children of Ephraim being armed and carrying bows and turned back in the day of battle they kept not the Covenant of God and refused to walk in his law and forget his works and his Wonders that he had showed them marvelous things he did in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt and in the field of Zone he divided the sea and caused them to pass through he made the waters to stand as an Heap in the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire he clav the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink has out of the great depths he brought streams out also of The Rock and caused Waters to run down like Rivers they sinned yet more against him by Proke uh provoking the most high in the wilderness and they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust and yay they spake against God and they said can God furnish a table in the wilderness behold he smoked the rock that the waters gushed out and the streams overflowed can he give bread also can he provide flesh for his people therefore the Lord heard this and was wroth so a fire was kindled against Jacob anger also come against Israel because they believed not in God and trusted not in his salvation though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heaven and had rained down Mana upon them to eat and had given them the corn of Heaven man did eat Angels food and he sent them meat to the full he caused an East Wind to blow in the heaven by his power he brought in the south wind he rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea he let it fall in the midst of their camp and round about their habitations so they did eat and they were fill for he gave them their own desire and they were not estranged from the lust but while their meat was yet in their mouth the wrath of God come upon them and slew the fattest of them and smoke down the chosen of the children of Israel for all this they sin still and believe not for his wondrous Works therefore their day did he consume in vanity in their years and trouble when he slew them and they then they sought him and they returned and inquired early after God and they remembered that God was their Rock and the high God their redeemer nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and they lied unto him with their tongues and their heart was not right with him neither were they steadfast in his Covenant but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquities destroyed them not yay many time turned his anger away did not stir up his wrath for he remembered that they were but flesh and wind that passeth away that cometh not again how of they did provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yay they turned back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of Israel they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy how he was how he had wrought his signs in Egypt his wonders in the field of Zone and had turned their Rivers into blood and their floods that they could not drink and he sent diverse sorts of flies among them which devoured them and frogs which destroyed them he gave also their increase into the caterpillar and their labor into the Locust he destroyed their vines with hail and and sycamore trees with frost he gave up their cattle all to the hell and their flocks to the Thunderbolt he cast upon the fierceness of his anger and wrath and indignation and Trouble by sending evil angels among them he made a way to his anger he spared not their soul from death but gave their life over to pestilence amen he smot all the firstborn uh in Egypt and the chief of their strength in the Tabernacles of ham but made his own people go forth like sheep and gathered and guided them in the wilderness like a flock and he led them on safely so that they feared not but the sea overwhelmed their enemies you can see now what God is is is saying here now God's got a vision God's got something in his mind he's wanting to take them out of slavery he's wanting to take them well out of Slavery to your emotions out out of slavery Amen to your flesh out of Slavery to your mind out of SL well can you say Amen he's wanting to take them out of slavery and make them amen possessors and he wants to be well can you say amen amen but you see Israel was serving God on an emotional basis it was ups and downs because amen after all amen when the when the was done they got hungry again when the Mana was done they got hungry again when the water had had had you know when it dried up they got thir well praise the Lord but you see they never could catch the Revelation that God has called me I was in his mind before the foundation of the world and there is nothing that this Wilderness can do to hinder God's purpose in my life and let me tell you today there is nothing that your trial your situation amen your circumstance can do to hinder God's word in your life as long as you can believe him hallelujah amen now we understand that is Israel was a type amen Israel was a type of of the church now they were just simply a natural people that God rose up to show what the church was going to be Church age after church age after church age after church age but there was going to come a people that God was going to say you have circled this mountain long enough you have circled it you have been in this Wilderness you have been around to it is time for us to go northward it is time for us to possess well praise the Lord it was at Cades Baria amen the Judgment center of the area amen right there God was going to judge them and he says but I'm not going to take that whole congregation amen who has been belly aching and crying can't believe me for amen for hardly anything over and over and over I prove myself what can you say Amen who can't see themselves as a possessor amen they're too busy looking at this and that amen those people will not go over amen so what did he do he rose up some preachers and they went over into that land 10 of them came back and said we can't do it amen and two million people says you're right we can't do it but there were two preachers that came back and said it is everything that God promised it is well praise the Lord everything the prophet said it is over [Music] there can you say Amen everything I I I like hearing a preacher tell me amen everything the prophet said is right I love to hear I love to hear a song leader say I I I don't have to be careful about quoting what the prophet said I I I'm glad to hear parents amen that'll stand up on the prophet's word and say we believe what God Said can you say Amen yes sir amen God's intention God's Vision was to take them from the land land of bondage and to place them as possessors in their own land but there's a generation that had risen up that could not believe it but just because and this is where I I want you to really look at this there is a church within a church there is a nation within a nation there well praise the Lord in every one of those ages there was an elect in those ages that was sealed under the message of that age Hallelujah in the in the middle of the Temptation God had a people that were going to possess I I begin to think as I as I looked there in proverbs 30 And1 and it says there is a generation that curseth their father and does not bless their mother there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes yet is not washed from their filthiness there is a generation oh how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up there is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw teeth as knives to Devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among men amen there's a generation that that this is this is you you're not going to be you're not going going to be exempt in this lotsy and age amen you're not going to be exempt from all the naysayers and and you're not going to be exempt from from all of the amen the caners and the Soares and the well praise the Lord amen there's none of us that are going to be exempt amen that generation I believe that's the generation that we're living in now I I I believe that this is the generation the scripture says that amen uh uh uh amen be ungrateful and unthankful and amen and disobedient to parents and there would be amen all of these things would would would would go on and and and and we all know those scriptures amen that that is a that's that's incredible because he says there is a generation there is a generation but I also want you to look and I me I I just I just don't see myself in those scriptures amen I hope you don't see yourself in those scriptures amen but I look at scripture that's concerning you and concerning me there in 1 Peter 2 and 7 it says unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them that be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them that stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed but you are a chosen generation yeah you are a royal priesthood don't you be looking at your neighbor and saying that must be him or that must be her it's time for you to get your mirror out take a selfie and say I am that chosen generation I am that royal priesthood I am the one that God has called to overcome now what does it say Amen you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people I'm going to read it to you again and every time that you agree with something I want you to shout amen you are a chosen generation you are a royal priesthood you are a holy nation you are a peculiar people oh come on church amen how are you going to get out of this old wilderness of defeat how are we going to get away from this mountain how these Church ages have

brother Wendell I've fallen I've made a mistake brother Wendell I'm discouraged I want to tell you the one who is leading the charge is the one who is your healer he's your deliverer he is there with you in the battle now brother Brandon would say it's us friends if we can move past that sound barrier if we can get to a place where it don't make any difference who says it as long as God says it's the truth say Alon I've always thought of the little poem in my school book when I was a little boy up here on the road many of you men and women of my age remembers it Sail on Sail On and On when Christopher Columbus was given ships by the queen of Spain because in heart he saw a vision that the world was round and he had hardly a way he could prove it he had nothing to do it with but he was a man of vision and he believed it when the ship was given to him with a bunch of prisoners and cowards that was his church members a bunch of pullbacks a bunch that was discouraged and tried to discouraging just a a little while longer and we'll drop off the world a sea will r a a serpent Will Rise From the Bottom of the Sea and wrap these little ships and pull it to the bottom and now say Brave Rover say what will you say he said Sail on Sail on Sail On and On God give us men in the church like that I don't care what the scientific world says I don't care what the denominational world says I Take God at his word and sail on Sail on until you pass the barrier we used to in in in the old church here we sing that little song like this I've crossed the separating line I've left the World Behind if there was ever a time that the church needs to step across that line that separates you between faith and unbelief by sight and looking at the Unseen by faith amen it's now that's when you leave everything behind you every care every worry everything that says you can't be a Christian i've smoked too long I've drank too long brother bandam I've lived in adultery I don't care what you say someone shout hallelujah I don't care what you say and what you've done though your sins be a Scarlet you once pass that line of barrier of the devil trying to torment you and saying you can't do it you can't do it and say I can do it for Jesus said whosoever will let him come and drink from the water of the Fountain of Life freely leave that behind when you people are that are sick has play out through prayer line after prayer line you've been prayed for and you've been dock to doctors you've done everything and still death stays at your door when you get to a place where you can say I don't care what the doctor says I don't care what this scientific world says Jesus Christ made me a promise pass that barrier of vibrations to your your soul that you're free oh someone shout hallelujah somebody say I'm free I'm free I'm not asking you if you feel like you are free I said say you're free because God says you're free say you're free cuz it's in his word that you are free amen it doesn't matter what the devil says I will cross that b barrier of unbelief Hallelujah can you say amen amen he says you he says now amen there's not one thing that'll shake you you'll sail into your healing just as sure and certain as I'm standing in this pull pit you'll never turn to look to the the that way no more you'll be looking this way so you're free from them things you say the day days of Miracles has passed there's no such a thing as Divine Healing you can't get wet your case is too bad Sail on Sail on above it climb the walls Yonder until all is free every rope and every feder has been cut loose every vibration has been left in the back and you're free and you're free indeed oh bless the Lord now amen Jesus Christ God's son said in the church for you people amen for such things as this he sent first apostles then after he sent prophets and teachers and pastors and evangelist to confirm his word to prove that he is uh to to prove that he is some great teacher I don't mean he has to be a PhD you might know less than the Bible a about the Bible than a child that's still in his adolescence Jesus knowed more about scriptures at 12 years old than all the Pharisees did or the learn sages so you see it doesn't take an intellectual mind it takes a surrendered heart to the will of God if Jesus Christ God's son promised this Bible that he had saved to the uttermost if he promised the things that I do shall you do also I'll be with you to the end of the world and if that same Jesus could come tonight and take us into his control we could set ourselves from not thinking of how it's going to be done but looking at the Unseen to The God Who has promised it can you shout hallelujah amen the unveiling of God brother brandham says oh break those denominational veils of Education break the denominational veils of tradition break those veils that's hiding God from you break those veils of Pride you women your King's Daughters act like it live like it break every Veil no matter what the PHD and lld says if it's contrary to that bre that Bible break through that Veil amen for we've crossed that Riven Veil we're on the other side now on the other side and you will see if you just do that and break those old traditions and things and come to him you'll see him standing the mighty conqueror the Word of Promise for this age made manifest you will see the Mighty God unveiled and see him Among Us right Among Us here unveiled the mighty conqueror I love this the Mighty God unconquered by Traditions now it didn't matter all of the unbelief of that generation it did not matter that the four million could not accept it what did matter is there was an elect that did and it doesn't matter what the G this generation says or doesn't say it doesn't matter it doesn't matter their forms of worship it doesn't matter one thing or Another We're not in form we're going north we've compassed this Old Mountain long enough Church attendance coming to church every service doing our thing well Satan loves form Satan loves a formal powerless religion but I'm sorry folks this is not my predes destinated Place God says I'm taking you to a land of promise I know there's going to be mountains there and I know why God is testing me here I know why God is testing me he's testing you with your amen W with this and with that with this just to see how you're going to handle it because he knows that when you get out of that Wilderness you're going to have to have a faith that is going to be steadfast and you're going to have to believe God for big things there there's going to be big mountains there's going to be big giants there's going to be amen things telling you that you don't belong there but if you know that you're the possessor and you've got your heart set on that Promised Land it does not matter how big the giant greater is he that is with me than that giant that I'm staring down not looking at it no more I'm not not this Wilderness has taught me it's brought something through me amen I've got one intention and that's to see God manifested in my flesh now can you say amen amen I think as I look here at the at at another place where Israel was in their Promised Land but yet Satan was doing everything he could to hinder them how many remembers the midianites coming and that the scripture says matters of fact I'll just read it here to you it's I think it's judges 6 judges 6 and2 and the Hand of Midian prevailed against Israel because of the the midianites the children of Israel made them dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds so it was when Israel had sown that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of isra of the East even they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till till Thou come unto Gaza and left no substance for Israel neither sheep nor Ox nor ass they come up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for the multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it and Israel was greatly impoverished because the midianites and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midianites God says well you're finished God says well you're in your land I can't do nothing for you the Lord sent a prophet to remind them of who they are the Lord sent a vessel are y'all come on now the Lord said thus sayith the Lord remember remember I brought you up out of Egypt to to be possessors come on your the the ancestors all the generation they did not they always aired in their hearts toward the word of God but there was a generation that possessed this land and I'm telling you that you are the Royal Seed of Abraham I'm telling you that your name is written all over this land it is not the amalekites it is not them it's your land can you say amen hallelujah hallelujah oh that just makes me want to shout amen brought you up out of that house of bondage the next thing you hear is God appearing unto Gideon and when God Appears unto Gideon Gideon is hiding I'm not going to keep you too much longer but Gideon is hiding the scripture says he's hiding behind the wine presses he is hiding and when the angel of the Lord came up to him it's so incredible he he told him he saids now you're just a poor miserable creature right now but I'm going to make something of you amen you're you're worthless you're amen that's not what he said he he said that uh 612 turn turn to 612 amen of of Judges he says for in the the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him what did they say everyone read it with me the Lord is with thee the dude is hiding behind a wine press the dude is is is as scared he is as chicken as chicken can be but God has got a promise amen it's time there come that there Come Those Junction of time there come that time where the crossroads come and God says it's time to turn northward it's time he says and Gideon said oh my Lord the 13th verse oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all of this befallen us where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt but now the Lord ha forsaken us and delivered us unto the hands of the midianites now that's his perspective he was in that rut of going around and around and around and around and around but the Lord was trying to say you've compassed this mountain long enough it's time it's time to it's time to go northward and the Lord looked upon him and said go this in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee and he said unto him oh my Lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in Manasseh I am the least of my poor family's house and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee and thou somebody say thou not my mama not my daddy but thou shal Smite the midianites as one man takes an unsuccessful farmer and is now surely I will be with thee can you say Amen you know why because deep and was God lying when he said thou Mighty Man of Valor no because he had the genetics of God on the inside of him it was just covered over by all that Wilderness junk it was covered over by all of that unbelief and God has to get us to that point to where we are willing we've got to well every one of us have got to come there I want to tell you amen you come to God you come to God half-heartedly you'll be right back out the door you got to come desperate you you you you you can't you can't come to God and just well you know okay no no and God knows how to get you desperate God God knows God knows how to put you flat on your back to where you ain't got nowhere else to go well praise the Lord God knows how God God knows God knows how to pull your chain he's got your number and I just want to tell you he knew he knew what he was bringing Israel to he knew what he was bringing Gideon to he knew that Gideon had come to the end of himself Gideon had come to that point where he had to have uh oh come on now amen and I and I want to tell you Gideon was there amen Gideon still had a hard time he says listen I I I'm thankful for that I see you you're a supernatural being I know amen you're God i i i amen and he puts a fleece out and the Lord gives the fleece and then amen and then he stops and he and he says hey before wait wait wait amen and and the fleece was simply this amen he says uh if I don't get it mixed up he says amen I'm want to put this fleece on the ground let the de fall upon the ground but not upon the fleece amen he comes back out the de was all over the ground and but is but but but the uh the fleece was uh was dry and then God then he said well I'm not too sure yet I you know Hallelujah I've been in this Wilderness a long time I've been going around this mountain a long time I just it's hard for me to get it's just really hard I I'm having a hard time here God Amen I I amen he says can you turn Amen Let the Dew fall upon the fleece and not upon the ground he wakes up the next morning and the Dew amen was ground was absolutely dry and the fleece uh was spping with water amen God was telling him you're called You're called You're called I've ordained you I've anointed you you're here for this season I've got to work for you you've got to get out of this Wilderness God is calling a people there's a Rapture at hand can you say amen amen it was important that he knew that he knew because God then takes his army that he calls together of 32,000 he's feeling good all right God's on my side we're ready to fight God says too many really tell everyone that's afraid to go home all of a sudden thousands and thousands and thousands leave and he's looking here and he's thinking dad gum or dog on or my word something and he's saying now I don't I don't know what to do yeah God says well I tell you what to do take him down to the water Brook and uh everyone that is taking water and while they're watching pull them to the side and the other ones that are just in there just a drinking away and not worried about anything else set them separated by the time that God got through separating his church God looked or a a a a Gideon looked and seen 300 men and the scripture says the enemy looked like grasshoppers all around you see this is what I'm this is what I'mma telling you right here brother bradam would always say this right he would say when he was preaching the seals he says now so that you'll know the difference between the church and the bride I'm going to call you bride so when I say Church church this is the this is them but you are a chosen generation there's going to be a lot of churches going to be a lot of Christians going to be a lot of oh but God's got a prophet that is going to separate us and why must it be a prophet not for the signs and the Wonders those are wonderful things but it's the word it's the he's going to equip us with the word to defeat the Devil and God separated 300 men that would believe the word of God we ain't got the biggest congregation in here and in fact we probably well I at the last I counted we ain't got 300 people hallelujah amen but you know what I am part I am part of God's elect I am stationed right here in PA America and God is going to to defeat the enemy through some Gideon's men God's going to defeat through Gideon's women somebody that'll take the word of God somebody that says I believe it can you say amen amen now again Judges 7 and 12 says the midianites and the malachit and all the children of the East lay along the Val in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude or camels wor without number as the Sand by the Sea for multitude and Gideon has only got 300 guys and Gideon gets worried again and God doesn't forget Gideon Lord told him go down he tells him go down to the enemy's Camp go to a such and such tent and listen to what the enemy is saying a Gideon's having a hard time he he's he's having a hard time he's having a hard time he's been circling this mountain is is his leg just does that that left leg just don't want to move anymore it's and God says Gideon won't you go down there so we send some men down there and the and and all of a sudden they he hears he hears I I thought that I might have had that here but I don't guess I I I I I I'll just have to tell you the story amen but but he hears a fell telling another fell one a soldier telling us says Hey listen and we're fixing to get whooped and uh he said man I had a dream last night that there was this big old barley loaf come tumbling down out of the mountain and it just it just whacked us all the other guy said H and they're and they're just talking and and it's and it's breeding fear and listen these guys are well glory to God God sent the men to a predestinated tent how many believe God can give God can even give the enemy dreams Hallelujah God can give the enemy God can make the enemy scared of you God can make the enemy scared of you amen and and he went back in there and told and told uh Gideon listen they're scared of us amen told them the story and that gave them all courage and now when they're ready to fight well you know what the Bible says that God says now listen you ain't going to need your swords leave them at home amen I want you to take pictures I want you to put lamps inside those pictures some candles in there and when I tell you I want you to get your trumpets and I want you to get your musicians and when I tell you I want y'all to start blowing the trumpets I want you to break your pictures and let the light amen and and and they were divided up into three companies and when they've done all of these things the Bible says God set an ambush among them God delivered them God I say it's time coming out from behind the wine press I'm coming out from behind my discouragement I'm coming out from behind amen all of the Troubles of the enemy I have been called to possess this land and by God's grace I'm going to possess it do I have anybody that will agree with me possessing that [Applause] land Hallelujah possessing that land want to read one more scripture to you Judges 7 and 20 and the three companies blew their trumpets and break the pictures and held the lamps in their hands and the trumpets in their hands BW to blow wither with and they cried the sword of the Lord and of Gideon why don't you cry the sword of the Lord and of the Bride the sword of the Lord and of the Bride oh you say well I just wish that was scriptural no that's not that is totally scriptural amen when God wanted to talk show brother bradam give him to let him know where he was in his third pole Ministry and what that Vision was amen with the explosion and and and the Seven Angels amen when God wanted to show him what it was all about what appeared in his hand when he was seeking the Lord what does it mean what does it mean amen there was a sword that appeared in his hand and he said says oh my amen a king sword and then God Amen God says it's the king sword oh come on now he says it rocked across the echoed across the Canyons there amen but down something begin to speak by divine revelation in his heart fear not this is only the third pull in other words I'm giv the bride I'm giv the bride my word I'm giving the bride my word it's time amen we've circled this mountain long enough it's time to go northward and possess can you say Amen this word of the Lord when the Lord comes amen hallelujah praise the Lord when the Lord was you you remember when when David had sinned uh for numbering Israel I believe it was and and and and he had a choice you want to fall in man's hand or do you want to fall in God's hand and he says let me not fall in the hand of man for they won't be merciful but I want to fall into the
