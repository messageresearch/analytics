We can put our trust in a God like that. Amen. As the ushers get ready to come, can we go to G? As I kneel in the darkness in the middle of the night, I'm praying for assurance everything's going to be all right. Lord, I see another battle out in front of me. I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go down in defeat. [Music] He said, "Do you remember where I brought you from? Just take a look behind you at how far you come. And every time you ask me, didn't I deliver you? So why would you be thinking that I wouldn't see you through? I love this now. Oh, didn't I walk on the water? I calmed the raging seas. I spoke to the wind and it hushed and it gave you peace. Did I run to your rescue? Didn't I hear you when you called? I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. Did not leave all of heaven just to die for your sin. I searched until I found you. And I do it all again. [Music] Dear Lord, we come into your presence once again this evening, Lord. And Lord, we just thank you for allowing us to to gather together, Lord. And Lord, we pray that you would just bless this offering. Lord, bless those that are able to give and those that aren't. Lord, may you just be in the remainder of the service, Lord. Accept our worship, Lord. And Lord, may we just leave here knowing that we've heard from you. We just commit the service into your hands. In the name of Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, she's talking to her father in a house that was once a home. She said, "My bills are coming through, Lord. Six days is not that long." She heard a voice so still and low. He said, "I move like that before. I'll do this little thing, my child, and I'll give you so much more." Oh, didn't I walk on the water and I calmed the raging sea? I spoke to the wind. [Music] Heared you when you call. I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. Did not leave all of heaven just to die for your sin. I searched until I found you. And I do it all again. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord. God bless you now. [Music] So many times I've questioned certain circumstances. es or things I could not understand. Many times in trials, weakness blurs my vision and in my frustration gets so out of hand. It's then I am reminded that I've never been forsaken and I've never had to stand one test alone. Oh, that's when I look at all the victories and the spirit rises up in me and is through the fire. my weaknesses made strong. Oh, [Music] the cross would not get heavy, that the hill would not be hard to climb. [Music] He never offered victory without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give in. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. Oh, I know within myself that I would surely perish. But if I trust the mighty hand of God, he'll shield the flame again. again. [Applause] Oh, he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. Oh no, he never offered victory without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give in. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will. Oh, just hold on. The Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Amen. Did you enjoy that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

He become flesh and blood like me and you. pay the price of sin to restore us back to fellowship to where we can love him, worship him, and we can actually literally enter into that that other dimension and feel his presence and know that he's with us. And there's just no telling what God's going to do here this weekend. I believe God's a miracle worker. I believe God's a divine healer. &gt;&gt; And I believe that there is a people who are lining up their thoughts with his thoughts so that heaven can come on earth so victory can be felt and known among his people.

Why don't we just go before our Lord in prayer? Lord Jesus, we're so thankful that we could be gathered together and know that we serve a living God who's not dead, but you're alive forever more. And you're not just a god far off somewhere in the sky somewhere, but you're an everpresent help in the time of trouble. And Lord, you told us that I'll be with you even in you. And Lord, many times in these natural bodies and our senses of emotions and feelings, we might not know by those things that you're here, but there's another sense of faith that declares that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And by divine promise, we know that you are present here with us right now. And Lord, that means we are right now gathered into a place where all things are possible to them that believe. Lord, it's good to be gathered together with our brothers and sisters of precious like faith and to see the smiling faces and to be able to greet one another. But Lord, I know there's some real needs that are represented here. Lord, there's some life situations, decisions, and answers, and trials that your children are going through. And Lord, we just want you to come by. Lord, I I have some notes. I I have some scriptures, [Music] Lord. I need you to come and take it into your hands, Lord, and break the bread of life and start distributing it to your children. as they have need of. Lord, as we just surrender oursel to you, may you anoint our lips and anoint the ear of the hearer. Lord, there's those that are even traveling now that are coming. May you be their protection. May they be encouraged on their way. Those that couldn't be with us. May you bless them, Lord. And we just are looking to you to be our portion. So we say, "Lord, here's my cup. Fill it up, Lord." Lord, sometimes if we want to be filled up, we got to be emptied out. So Lord, as we start these meetings, may we just start by a a total surrender, Lord, and an emptying out of maybe of disappointments and heartache and things we've gone through and maybe grudges that we're holding on to and maybe a certain outcome or expectation of of the service. May we just say, Lord, you have the right of way. Lord, may I speak for each individual? Lord, we want to invite you to come into our life, into our house, and our heart and walk up and down the corridors of our heart and Lord, the secret places maybe we haven't made available to you. We say, "Lord, I'm ready now. Just come and have your will and way." We pray. We commit the service to you. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, we'll just we'll be reading out of Romans. We just thank Brother Wendell for the opportunity uh to be gathered here with you. It's um we never take the invitation to stand before the redeemed, the elect of God lightly, and it's just a a great privilege to serve with brother Nathan and brother Zachary and brother Ronnie. Uh it's great privilege to be able to serve beside those men. And so we're we're just uh in great expectation and it's a great honor to stand before you. God's elected. God's called. God's redeemed. And maybe there's somebody here that don't know that. And I pray that this weekend you will by revelation find out who you are. &gt;&gt; It's good to see many familiar faces and some from our church, the Bennett. And each one that's come. Are are you you looking forward to the word? Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I know some people are tired, so maybe we'll just get right into it and we'll just move right along. And as we're moving along, if you know, like a road trip, if they fall asleep or something, we'll hit a bump and wake them back up and we'll just &gt;&gt; we'll just keep on rolling. How does that sound? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, we'll just get right into it. Romans 8 and 28. Just some familiar scriptures here. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:28 through31. It says, "And we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God, &gt;&gt; to them who are the called according to his purpose." &gt;&gt; So you are called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; For whom he did predestinate, he also did. For whom he did forno, he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called. And whom he called them, he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. And you know, just to point out, it's to them who are the called &gt;&gt; according to his purpose. And I'd like to read out of second Peter 1:10. We'll just try to move through here and just see how the Lord would um just break this out by his grace. Uh we have maybe a lot of highlights in here and uh we'll just uh uh uh see how the Lord would just pull this together. Second Peter 1 and10 for it says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling &gt;&gt; and election sure &gt;&gt; for if you do these things you shall never fall. And this make means to do or to bring forth or to bear. And I just love how he goes on to say, "For an entrance shall be ministered unto you." And and he goes on to talk about how though we would be established in the present truth. And I'm just so thankful for a message that could come and and could identify who we are and and it could start to bring forth the very purpose of the seed, the predestinated seed that God has placed inside of us. And I just want to read this very familiar quote out of the Pergamium church age. And uh uh this is mentioned also in spoken word as the original seed. He says, "Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father." John 5:19. This harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride. He shows her his word of life. She receives it. She never doubts it. Therefore, nothing can harm her, not even death. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. We don't do we have any interpreter interpreting going on? I'm going to run then. All right. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Here is the secret of this. The word is in the bride as it was in Mary. The bride has the mind of Christ, for she knows what he wants done with the word. She performs the command of the word in his name. For she has thus sayith the Lord. Then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass. Like a seed that is planted in water, it comes to full harvest serving its purpose. And so I'm just wanting to maybe lay in there that you have a purpose. You have a calling. And we want to know what is that purpose? What what is that calling? I I I want to serve it just like a a seed that is planted within that seed is the power of transformation to become what it was predestinated to be. And pro the prophet would say this. He said you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God. And I say I want to express his life. I want to express his attributes. I want to express his purpose. &gt;&gt; You know, and I was just thinking about like Moses, you know, he was born for a purpose. He was born to fulfill prophecy. And and and you know, as unqualified as Moses felt and as as incapable as Moses felt, he would use all of his excuses and I'm not able, I can't speak, I can't go. Well, what happens if this and what happens with that? Well, and the Lord kept telling him, I I Well, you know, I I I'll I'll give you Aaron and Well, what happens if I go and and they don't believe me? Well, I'll be with you. Well, what happens if they don't receive me? Well, what is that you got in your hand? Every excuse that Moses could try to bring up and say, "Lord, I'm not able. I'm not capable. I can't do it." God kept telling him over and over, "I've called you. I've elected you. I've chose you. You were born for this purpose." And I say, "Oh church, when we recognize that you were born for a purpose, regardless of your insufficiencies, regardless of your ability, regardless of your faults and failures and how many times you tried, I don't care if you've come to the altar a million times and you've walked back out there in sin." God comes back and he tells you, "I've ordained you. I've called you. I've elected you. You are my bride. You're going to go in a rapture. You will put every devil under your feet because you ordained. You are elected. You are called. You are bone of my bone. You are flesh of my flesh. You can't do the greater works. &gt;&gt; But Lord, I'm a failure. I I can't do this. And what does he come right back around and do? &gt;&gt; Tells you again &gt;&gt; over and over and over. &gt;&gt; And I just want to say that Moses was what God made him. &gt;&gt; You are what God made you. &gt;&gt; So many times we look at what we can do. We look at our our abilities. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you, he's Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; He is able to provide for himself. &gt;&gt; Isaac said, "Oh, oh Abraham, oh father, where is that ram going to come from?" He said, "All I know, son, he's Jehovah Gyra. He will provide for himself. Where is there going to come a bride without spot or wrinkle? He is Jehovah Gyra. He can speak a bride into existence. How is there going to be a mighty invincible army rise up and do the great works? He is Jehovah Gyra. He will provide for himself. &gt;&gt; And I say that same one is here amongst us tonight. &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; He will provide for himself. &gt;&gt; He'll provide himself a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says this in why Christ speak. He says, "And when Moses saw that he was raised up for this purpose and he had met face to face this great God who had made the call." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now God's calling you. We want to meet the God who's making the call. I say, "We got an opportunity this weekend. &gt;&gt; You you might there might be something in your heart that believes just like Moses. Uh uh uh the prophet of God would say Moses had intellectual faith. He knew he was born for a purpose. He was born his me he had message believing parents that told him, "Hey, you were born for a purpose. We're going in a rapture. You're going in a bride. You can do the greater works." He listened to tapes. He sat on the church pews. But the prophet of God said he had intellectual faith. But there came a day out on the back side of the desert that the one was calling and was caught up in a burning bush. And he said, "Moses, you're standing on holy ground. I say he's Jehovah Gyra. He is right here tonight. The burning bush is present amongst us. If you want an audience with your creator, I say Christ Jesus is here to speak to you and your time and need to show you that you are called, you are ordained, you are elected. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said when he met this God face to face, this great God who made the call and had anointed him and identified him, &gt;&gt; I say, is there somebody here that wants to be anointed and identified? Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "This is your call, Moses. &gt;&gt; I'm sending you. I'm going to show you my glory." &gt;&gt; And here I am in a bush burning. Go down there. I'll be with you. He didn't even need a stick. &gt;&gt; He had the word, &gt;&gt; the vindicated word. &gt;&gt; And there he went. It anointed the faith that was in him. And the prophet of God said, "Oh, it anoints us when we see that we're living in the last days." &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just coming to my inspiration here. Out of the trial, Brother Brandham says this. I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man &gt;&gt; in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll just uh say this out there. If you go look it up on the table, it'll say through. But if you listen to it, he says in. I I I just I like it to be in. &gt;&gt; In because I'm a participation. That's me. He's talking about I challenge you because we I don't have time to go into the trial, but he's there at, you know, he he said he didn't get a fair trial in the at at the first time. And here comes a vindicated prophet. I'm going to give him a fair trial. And he shows beyond infallible evidences that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And he stood there discerning the thoughts and intents of the hearts. And then he says, "I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the Son of Man in &gt;&gt; human flesh, in the bride's body." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Accept his call. &gt;&gt; That's what I'd like to minister to you this evening by the help of God. Accept his call. &gt;&gt; I believe that that is our purpose. That Christ, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; would be revealed in human flesh. in your body, &gt;&gt; in your life, &gt;&gt; in your marriage, &gt;&gt; and your family. &gt;&gt; Let let's let's just not leave it out there generic. &gt;&gt; Malachi 4:5. &gt;&gt; Oh, the the collective bride body. No, &gt;&gt; no. Because when you come to this message and you meet this word, you have to stand alone. &gt;&gt; Accept his call. And I just want to say that during these meetings, I I believe God is is coming to call individuals and families to to restoration and to to healing and to deliverance and reconciliation and a and maybe uh men have h have have have been doing things they shouldn't have done and they they've just been laying in a a pit of despair and and they haven't had any strength or ability on on how they could make that right with their life. But I believe God is going to create a way uh during these meetings to to reconcile marriages and and to give men the strength and ability to lay down their pride and to to lay down the things that have been haunting them and to make it right with God and to be broken with a contrite spirit and his presence and be able to go to a to to his family and to be you know what I haven't been the father that I've wanted to be. I I really haven't been the believer that I wanted to be. But oh, I've met Jehovah. He's dealing with my heart. He's the I saved church. We got to lay down our pride. We We got to come to him in some humility and and meekness and fear and trembling and say, "Look, I really don't got it all figured out. I can quote the quotes and I can tell you the sermons and I can say all these things, but oh, I need to be walking with Jehovah. I Lord, I need another refilling of the Holy Ghost. Lord, bring back my joy. Restore the joy of my salvation. Lord, I just don't want it to be some good meetings and they and they go back by and I'm I'm back down in the ditch and I'm back over there. Lord, I need a real change. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I believe God is is going to call. &gt;&gt; And I just believe in opening these meetings, my heart's cry to you. Accept &gt;&gt; his call. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to accept your call. I I I want to accept my position. I want to accept &gt;&gt; my calling. Lord, I I want to be a placed son, and an adopted son. I I I I don't want to just be up and down and topsyturvy all the time. You know, Jesus would say, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." &gt;&gt; Except a man see, except a man be born again, he cannot understand. That's the right word there in the in we've been taught in the translation. Except a man be born again, he cannot understand. And I say that's a good place to start the meetings off. I say except he be born again. Look, look, if if if if we get to preaching this message to a place where we leave out Calvary, I'm sorry, we've left the word. If we ever get to a place where we're so predestinated, we don't know how to preach Calvary, we don't know how to preach a bleeding bloody word, we don't need how to preach a repentance, I say, oh, I say repent. The prophet of God said that that was the that should be the zeal for the age. He said, what was it? A zeal to say I am wrong. I say we need to get some people back into the house of God that are sincere and that are able to say, you know what, I'm wrong. I was wrong. I said that about my sister. I said that about my brother. I said that about that church. I said that about that preacher. But you know what? I'm wrong. Lord, forgive me. I'm wrong. I say we ought to get back to some real repentance. &gt;&gt; We get so puffed up and so elevated, so high in the sky. We're so ordained, we don't even know how to repent. We don't even know how to make something right. Well, if that's just the way the brother feels, then so be it. That is not the nature of Christ. the nature of Christ. You you can be in the right. They can be dead wrong. But the nature of Christ will go to your brother and say, "I'm sorry, brother. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I'm sorry that you were offended." &gt;&gt; God's calling. &gt;&gt; The word says in Romans 8:14, "For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. And if children, Hallelujah, than heirs, &gt;&gt; heirs of God and joint hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified together. Is there anybody that's suffering? If you ain't suffering, well, &gt;&gt; I tell you, but when you find a church that's suffering, when you find a family that's suffering, you know, they just might be right with God. Because I want to tell you, we are a persecuted church. We are sought after to be destroyed by devils. The lid of hell has been ripped off. And the devil is trying to attack your family. He's trying to attack your church. He's trying to attack your ministry. &gt;&gt; But if we suffer, &gt;&gt; all right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If we suffer with him, then we may also be glorified together. For I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waitth for the manifestation of the sons of God. I want to tell you, he is not dead, but he is alive forever more in his people. He is the same yesterday, today and forever. The prophet of God said his messianic anointed ones believe that. What is the Messiah? What is the Messiah? Messiah is anointed one. And now if he was the Messiah by being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of God to be the redeemer and the anointed one. And God raised up that body, his bride is the anointed one for this day. It's already raised with him. It's the resurrected because these two are one. I want to tell you this message is more than belt buckles. This message is more than good sermons. This message is more than I'm better than Pentecost. This message is more than look at our church and look at that preacher. This message is the very invisible union of Christ, the capstone coming down and taking on union and flesh with a people. And just as he was anointed in that day to fulfill every word, this bride is anointed to fulfill every word that was spoken by the son of man. &gt;&gt; Accept his call. &gt;&gt; God wants to take individuals &gt;&gt; and prove to Satan &gt;&gt; that as God was in the body of Christ, &gt;&gt; he is now in the bride. In the body of the bride. Yes, &gt;&gt; don't put that off for somebody else. &gt;&gt; Oh, the prophet said in invisible union, he said, "Oh, the spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested, vindicated, just what the bride said would happen. Just what the Bible said would happen in this day. It's happening day by day. &gt;&gt; You might not feel like it. You might not see it. But I want to tell you, if you are walking with this word day by day, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; look, you are predestinated to meet the challenge of the age. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "This bride is not spoiling and breaking our scars for no man." &gt;&gt; I'm trying to preach to accept his call. If it if it's gotten familiar to you, well, let's just act like you ain't never heard it again. Because what we've done is we've made rituals and traditions and we've heard it so many times it just becomes knowledge and we get puffed up. But I say, "Oh God, give me more than a man's knowledge of it. Give me a revelation." &gt;&gt; I want to tell you that you are &gt;&gt; that word that was prophesied. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will have a bride without blemish. I will have a bride without spot. I will have a bride without wrinkle." I want to tell you, you are that spoken word. You are prophecy being fulfilled. The devil tells you, not you. It's too late. You failed too many times. You've gone to church for so many years and you done messed up. You made a mess of your marriage. You made a mess of your testimony. Oh, I want to tell you something that my Bible says in Romans 9, it says, "For the children being not yet born, &gt;&gt; neither having done any good or evil, &gt;&gt; it ain't the good you do, and it ain't the bad that you do." &gt;&gt; That the purpose of God, &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your purpose. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your calling. Come on. &gt;&gt; That the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works, &gt;&gt; but of him that &gt;&gt; calleth. &gt;&gt; Can you hear your name? &gt;&gt; Can you hear him calling? &gt;&gt; I say he's calling you tonight. He's going to be calling you throughout these meetings. I say accept his call. &gt;&gt; Who me? Yeah, you. Gideon. &gt;&gt; What? Who am I? If God be God, where are all the miracles? What can I do? &gt;&gt; But what'd he say? Thou mighty man of valor. He didn't look like a mighty man of valor. He didn't feel like a mighty man of valor. But I want to ask you, what was he? &gt;&gt; Because capital L, &gt;&gt; capital O, capital R, capital D said you are. I don't want to say capital L, capital O, capital R, capital D has descended in the lady age to call a pride out of Ladyia and say you are bone of my bone. You are flesh of my flesh. I don't feel like it. I don't look like it. Could I be me? Yes, it's you. Because I said you are. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, you are what he made you. And God is calling to you. I say accept his call. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "And have not I sent thee." He said, "Good to see you, Brother David, Sister Julia. I'm glad you made it." And when he spoke to Gideon, Gideon was a little surprised. He said, "Now, mighty man of valor, &gt;&gt; he didn't know he was. &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't know you are. &gt;&gt; You might be many of those mighty men of valor tonight sitting here. You say the little church, small group. Oh my, there was only two there. &gt;&gt; Him and his daddy. There only has to be two here. You and Christ. &gt;&gt; That's all it takes to be a mighty man of valor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm starting to feel pretty good. &gt;&gt; You mean it's not about all the good I did. It's not about all the bad I did. It's not about if I can overcome this and I can overcome that, but if I can recognize that Christ is here and he's calling me and he's telling me, "My son, you are a mighty man of valor. You can do the greater works." I say, "Oh God, more than anything, may there be a revelation strike this church that we recognize we are standing in your presence and you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. You are still calling. Your voice is still sounding out. You are still calling your bride. You're still calling yours to repentance. You're still calling them and sanctifying them and justifying them and filling them with the Holy Ghost. I say accept his call. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God is still speaking. He's still calling. &gt;&gt; Well, we look into our Bibles and we see in Genesis 12 when the Lord called Abraham, it was God's election. He was speaking to bring forth something that was in his thoughts. I want you to understand when when God started to call Abraham, we have to know that God knew right where Abraham is. He knew right when he would be born. A matter of fact, he protected the seedline since Adam to make sure Abraham would be right there at that time and then he would come. And it wasn't so much that he was calling, he was speaking, &gt;&gt; something that was in his mind to now come into manifestation. Just as the scripture would say in Genesis 12:28, he said, "And I &gt;&gt; will make thee a great nation, &gt;&gt; and I will bless thee &gt;&gt; and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing." &gt;&gt; There there was nothing in there where he said, "I will if you do." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Abraham, I will. It was an unconditional covenant. God said, "I will make you a mighty nation. I will number your seed as the stars." It was something that was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. And now, he was calling for the manifestation of what was already in his mind. Oh, don't you see why you're sitting here this evening? God was calling for an expression of something that had been in his mind. And he's been waiting through seven church ages to have a bride without spot or wrinkle. And right here in Pontie, Oklahoma, she stands here tonight. The vindicated word. I said the vindicated word. You are the vindication of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Because you're anointed messiahs. &gt;&gt; You are the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I say it was just like in the beginning when God said, "Let there be light." Right? &gt;&gt; He was calling for something that was in his mind to be manifested. &gt;&gt; And God knows how to take the the darkness and the confusion and the chaos &gt;&gt; that's in your life. &gt;&gt; Maybe something he says, "I know I'm a son of God. I know I was predestinated. I believe this message, but I just can't live it. I've tried over and over and I go back and I fall and I pick back up music and I pick back up habits and I I just can't ever seem to get the victory." Well, I want to tell you, God is here. He's bruting now out over your life. I want to say, why are you still here? Cuz he's been keeping you. You would have thrown in the towel a long time ago, but for some reason, you're still here. Maybe you're at home and you're streaming. You're still listening because I believe God is pruding out over your life. He's still calling. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say, why don't you accept his call &gt;&gt; and let the light of God's word start driving the darkness out of your life? drive the darkness and the confusion of of the things that you're going through. I want to say the sen light is here. &gt;&gt; The manifested word is here to start dealing with your trial, &gt;&gt; to start dealing with your family situations. &gt;&gt; Start dealing with your life and your private life and the things that you've been doing and the things that you've just made a a truce. Okay, fine. &gt;&gt; You know, I'll just do a little bit, but this is just the way it's going to be. No, God is calling you to total victory. &gt;&gt; God is calling you to total deliverance. God is calling you to total separation. &gt;&gt; God is calling you to a total filling of the Holy Ghost. And I just want to say just as as Abraham was and just as God brooded out over the earth, you are that predestinated seed that was predestinated before the foundation of the world to what? Be fashioned into his image. &gt;&gt; What does the scripture say? It says, "I know my thoughts that I think toward you. Not thoughts of evil, but thoughts of peace. What? To bring you to an expected end. Now, I want to say this out of the masterpiece. He says, this is speaking about you. Look, I'm hitting some high points because this is the call of God in your life that he has called you to for a purpose that you are the word living and action. The Bible bride, not some man-made bride. The Bible bride, smitten and afflicted of God. No beauty would would we desire her, but yet we did esteem her smitten and afflicted of God. That's right. She stands alone. &gt;&gt; She is smitten from all the denominations according to Revelations 3. She is smitten out of the lady. You'll see a church age that she was raised up in. I want to say if she was smitten out of the lady you'll see a church age, then I want to ask you where is she? &gt;&gt; I said if she was smitten out of a lady you'll see a church age. I want to ask you where is she? She is seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. She is in an eagle age. She is in a pride age. This is bride time. This is eagle time. This is seat time. This ain't time to back up. This ain't time to sit down. This is time to go in a rapture. This is a time to get your family. This is a time to get your neighbors. This is a time to possess your vessels and sanctification and honor because we are going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said she, the bride, is an independent from all others. She's an independent woman, a great speckled bird. That's the difference from all others. She has his name. She has his life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Look, this this bride don't need no man to tell her how high she can go. &gt;&gt; She don't need no man to tell her how to preach. She don't need no man to tell her how to worship. He don't she don't need no man to tell her how to sing. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said his eagllets, his messiahs, they look like him. They act like him. They preach like him. They do the works that he did. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we are spiritual astronauts. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, I'm above the arguing. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and fuss and fight down in the airplane age and down in the automobile age and keep fussing about our ABCs and how we should worship and and if we should get excited or if we shouldn't get excited. You go ahead and fuss all you want to. But I'm somewhere up in the heavenlies. I'm an astronaut. I'm in heavenly places in Christ Jesus in an invisible union. I know how to worship my God. I know how to preach like my God wants me to preach. I know what music to listen to. I know how to dress. There is no limits to how high you can go. Men try to put limits on. Malachi 4:5 took the limits off. &gt;&gt; If you can believe for it, you can have it. Hallelujah. Paul said in Colossians 3:1, "If then be risen with Christ, if ye then be risen with Christ, &gt;&gt; seek those things which are above, &gt;&gt; where Christ siteth on the right hand of God. &gt;&gt; Set your affections &gt;&gt; on things above, &gt;&gt; not on the things of this earth. Men want to fuss and fight in these atmospheres of airplanes and automobiles &gt;&gt; looking back to what the church was &gt;&gt; fighting about these things. But my prophet said we're astronauts. &gt;&gt; We're beyond that. &gt;&gt; Let's go on. Christ said so. I want to say if the same spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead &gt;&gt; dwell in you, it will also quicken your mortal body. I want to say not just then. I know there's coming a quickening in the final adoption phase of the the transformation of our body. But right now, ye are quickened. Now, ye are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; I said, right now, ye are the sons of God. Now we are the sons of God. Now we are redeemed. Not then. &gt;&gt; Now prophet of God said in rising the sun, he said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it. And I give unto the keys to you. Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. And whatsoever you loose on earth, that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh. If it was flesh in that day by the son, the groom, it's the flesh today by the bride. See, whatsoever sin you remit to them, they are remitted. Whosoever sin you retain to them, they are retained. He said it's not through a church system. It's not through some preacher. It's not through some bishop. He said it's through the spiritual revealed word that does it. Oh, I believe God is calling to you tonight and through these meetings that we would catch a greater revelation, a revelation of the spiritual revealed word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say he is calling to you. &gt;&gt; Let there be. It's a call to righteousness. It's a call to holiness. &gt;&gt; It's a call to look. It's a call to the fruits of the spirit. &gt;&gt; It's a call to the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; So many times we get focused on all the other things and we want to do all the big things and and we want the spiritual gifts and everything. And I say, "But what about the stature of a perfect man that you be built up just like Jesus Christ?" I say, "God, I hear your calling to me, Lord. I want more faith. I want more temperance. I want more virtue. I want more godliness. I want more brotherly kindness, Lord. That that capstone of love by the Holy Ghost can just settle down upon my life. &gt;&gt; I say he's calling to you." &gt;&gt; And and I just for a moment, I just want to lay this in there. You know, the scripture says, you know, uh uh leave those things which are behind behind and press toward the mark of a high calling. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we we get this idea or something in our head that that seems like the very word that we're preaching, it's just so far off somewhere in the heavenlies and and we see how the word was manifested in Malachi 4:5 and and we just go back and like I'm raising kids. I'm a wife at home. I'm doing clothes. How can that ever be me? You know, I I got a 9 to5. I work at Taco Bell and and and I barely can pay my rent and and how how could that's so far up in the heavenlies. No, God wants to take somebody like you. &gt;&gt; He wants to take the wash woman. Come on. There's too many stories of the wash woman or the woman at the well or some harlot or some Rahab or some some insignificant Gideon. God wants to take nobodies and make them somebody. He wants to take somebody that doesn't think nothing of himself and is able to say, "Oh God, I need you more than I've ever needed you before. I've tried to be religious. I've tried to serve you. But in my own efforts, I failed you, oh God. But I'm here to repent and lay it all down. I hear your call, Lord. Fill me with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "Don't look at what you were. &gt;&gt; Look what you're going to be." &gt;&gt; So, why don't we just take a moment there? I want to say if you can't see it now, &gt;&gt; I want you to at least see what's coming. &gt;&gt; Watch out, devil. &gt;&gt; See, sometimes it's hard to accept it right now. Present tense, &gt;&gt; but he's called for it. &gt;&gt; And there ain't no demon in hell that can stop it. &gt;&gt; There's no Red Sea. There's no trial. There's no Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; There's no army. &gt;&gt; There's no Jordan. There's nothing. There ain't no plague, no sickness. &gt;&gt; He's called for it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But sometimes it's like, oh, who me? &gt;&gt; Well, I want to just say, okay, if you can't see it now, then let's just see what's coming. Because what is a sheath wave? It's a first one &gt;&gt; that comes to maturity. What is it testifying of? It's testifying of all the wheat that's in the field. &gt;&gt; So then we can see not not I wasn't there in the meetings. I I I wasn't there to to to to to stand in the meetings or or to see the prayer lines, but I see by faith a first one to maturity that what this word that was prophesied to be in this day, how it would act and how it would look and how it would conduct itself in somebody's life. Now look, I want to tell you, we are past the days of trying to wear the belt buckles. We are past the days of trying to imitate his mannerisms. We are past the day. Look, look, that was back in the 70s where everybody wanted to carry their Bible like and I don't blame him for it because they saw Christ in the individual. But Christ wants to be in you and your life in Pontie, Oklahoma. He wants a southern draw. If you're German, he wants a German draw. If you're Texan, he wants to say howdy. God bless you. He don't want you to try to talk and walk like everybody else. He wants to get in your skin. He wants to get in your body. He wants to borrow your flesh. He wants to come in a union and use your accent, use your neighborhood, use your profession &gt;&gt; to be the living word made manifest. &gt;&gt; We've seen a first one to maturity. As the prophet would say in the bride coming of Christ, &gt;&gt; a coming out of the church age, he says, "There has to be another one waved over the people." &gt;&gt; And I like this. He says, "I'm sure you see what I'm talking about." &gt;&gt; And all the believers say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Just as what? The sheath wave, Christ, the word made flesh was waved over the people on Calvary, he was waved back over the people on the day of Pentecost. But he said, "There's coming a time, a resurrection in the end time that the word made flesh will be waved back over the people again." It was the bride. It was Christ coming in the form of the son of man. But Christ has come again and a son of man ministry. But it was a bride member who was the first one to maturity testifying to the whole bride. You, this is what's coming. &gt;&gt; If you can't see it now, I want to tell you it's coming. You can do the greater work. You are that invincible army. You can't put every devil under your feet. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "Hallelujah. I sure you see what I'm talking about. Look, we're going to keep running. I'm sure you see what I'm talking about. It was waved over the people in the first time there will come forth for a bright age for resurrection out of dark denominations will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power. Look, quit trying to water it down. Quit trying to weaken. It's it's in its full power being waved over the people by the same signs and same wonders that he did back there. Because I live also. &gt;&gt; Because I live, ye live also. speaking to &gt;&gt; his wife. &gt;&gt; Because I live, ye live also. What a resurrection that was. And what a resurrection this is. To be quickened from the dead, to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power. &gt;&gt; Look, I haven't lost my mind. I know what I'm talking about. I was out there in the dark ditches of sin. I was out there in the doom and gloom of Lady Osia. But God rich in mercy, he called out to my name, said, "Son, you don't belong down there in the chicken yard. You don't belong out down out there in the drug house. &gt;&gt; Who me?" &gt;&gt; Yes, you, son. &gt;&gt; Come up higher. &gt;&gt; Come up out of the chicken yard. Come up out of your confusion. Come up out of your hurt. [Music] &gt;&gt; Paul said in Romans 4:19, "And being not weak in faith." Look, I'm trying to say like this. If you can't see what you are now, at least see what's coming. &gt;&gt; I say at least get happy about that. &gt;&gt; I might not be putting every devil under my feet right now, but guess what? Hallelujah. I am going to put every devil under my feet. Sickness is going under my feet. Death is going under my feet. Pornography. I don't care what you're going through. Why don't you start speaking the word? Darkness, demons, depression. I don't care what it is. If you got some nervous type of feeling that's been tearing you out. Why did you speak out? I'm going to put that devil under my feet. I hear his call and he has come to anoint me. I am a messiah. &gt;&gt; I was born for a purpose. I was born to be a devil defeating demon stopping. Born of the Holy Ghost child of God. &gt;&gt; I know who I am. &gt;&gt; And I am what I am by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's quickening power &gt;&gt; and being not weak in faith. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Let's not be weak in faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He considered not his own body now dead. when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of 100 years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. He staggered not &gt;&gt; at the promise of God through unbelief, but he was strong in faith. &gt;&gt; Saying maybe, possibly, &gt;&gt; you know, I think I'm elected. Think I'm going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe God will give me another handmade. But even I can't even do it now. That won't work. No. My Bible says he staggered not at the promise. I I I want to say this. Did God give you the promise? &gt;&gt; Then I want to tell you, we have a pattern in our Bible that the disciples were in the upper room &gt;&gt; and they were praising God for the promise. They were just excited about having received the promise as they were to re receive the fulfillment of it. &gt;&gt; My prophet said they were in the upper room praising God for the promise. I want to tell you, stagger not. If God has given you a promise, stagger not through unbelief, but be strong in faith, giving glory unto God. &gt;&gt; I am going in a rapture. Yes. &gt;&gt; My body will be changed. &gt;&gt; My girls will be saved. &gt;&gt; My boy will be born again. I will be healed. I'm taking my mama with me. I'm taking my daddy with me. I'm taking my brother with me. I'm taking my I don't have a halfway religion. I'm going all the way. And I ain't leaving a hoof behind. I'm gonna fight for my brothers. I'm going to fight for my sisters. I'm going to start professing the word of the Lord. I can do all things through Jesus Christ that strengthens me. Greater is he that is in me than that cancer. Greater is he that is in me than that depression. Greater is he that is in me than that anxiety. &gt;&gt; Hey, that's what's coming. &gt;&gt; Get ready for it. Prophet of God said, "No circumstance will be considered when faith finds its betting ground." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Here's the bedding ground, Lord. &gt;&gt; Look, friends, I I am not screaming and shouting to work something up. &gt;&gt; I get excited. I scream and shout because something has come down. &gt;&gt; Some people just can't see it. &gt;&gt; Some people can't see the capstone. &gt;&gt; Some people can't see capital L, capital O, capital R, capital D standing the same yesterday, today, and forever before us. &gt;&gt; Look, I've been called a fanatic. I've been made fun of. Come on. I &gt;&gt; I've had people call me names, but you know, just like my prophet said, a matter of fact, I brought it out here. Just like my prophet said about that calf that come out of that stall, had his big old barns and his concrete floors and he he got out there and and looked through the the crack in the fence and he saw all the screaming and shouting. He saw that calf out there kicking up his heels. He said, "What was it?" It was the spiritual vitamins. He might not have had a big church. He might not have had all the things of Lady Osia, but what did he have? He had the spiritual vitamins of the revealed word. And the prophet of God said, "And when a man is filled with the Holy Ghost, there is something in him that's full of God's spiritual vitamins makes him praise God, shout and act different." Because why? He is no longer earthbound. He's in heavenly places, sailing around in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Well, you want to know what the matter of me is? I'm in heavenly places. I'm an astronaut. I am not earthbound any longer. I am soaring in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm shouting and acting up because something has come down. The capstone has come crying grace, grace. Oh, I said it's amazing grace. Do you know grace? [Music] &gt;&gt; He said you're free. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but do you Does anybody here know what it's like to be bound in sin? Does anybody here know what it's like to be bound in denominational tombstones and then have the Lord Jesus Christ come to you and say, "You're free. &gt;&gt; You're free." I believe God is calling to individuals during this meeting. Go ahead and come out of your prison. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and come out of your darkness. Go ahead and walk out of that darkness. Go ahead and walk out of that confusion. You don't belong down there in the chicken yard. Come up higher. I am here to set you free. You are loosed. You are free. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, preacher? &gt;&gt; There is therefore now no condemnation &gt;&gt; to them that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about accepting his call. Now, &gt;&gt; I know I've hit a billion points, &gt;&gt; but something by God's grace laying in there, I want you to accept &gt;&gt; his call. &gt;&gt; Call to righteousness, a call to holiness, a call to separation, a call to be, &gt;&gt; a call to be the very word made manifest in you, &gt;&gt; a Messiah, an anointed one. I say if you can't see it now, can you see what's coming? &gt;&gt; I think we can be a little like Abraham then. &gt;&gt; We can be strong in faith. &gt;&gt; Look, it ain't my faith. I am not living by the faith of Matthew McGary. That faith will fail. &gt;&gt; But I am living by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave his life for me. &gt;&gt; This whole thing is rigged. He said, "Faith comes by hearing the word." And he gave you the faith to get the faith to hear the word or what? &gt;&gt; It wasn't my ability to hear. It was his grace. &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't wake up one day and say, "You know what? I think I'll do." No, it was God's grace. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Behold, I send you." &gt;&gt; Come on. You were that you &gt;&gt; by his grace &gt;&gt; unmmerited grace. I didn't do anything to deserve it. &gt;&gt; But God called me. God elected me. He died on Calvary for my sins. Every bad thought, every bad deed. He was whooped. He was bruised. He was beaten for me. and he took it all up to Calvary and said, "It's finished." And if you'll just identify with the sacrifice, &gt;&gt; he says, "You're justified." &gt;&gt; But Lord, I did this. I don't know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; You see what he's doing? &gt;&gt; He's removing all the guilt. &gt;&gt; How can you be the word made manifest with the baggage? Because every time you try to step out and do the greater works, oh yeah, but you're not worthy. &gt;&gt; Every time you say, "I am the bride," the devil's trying to pull you back down. &gt;&gt; Look, friends, Luther did not have a full revelation of justification. &gt;&gt; He had a sliver. But when the caps don't come, &gt;&gt; he said, "When I say it's finished, you're redeemed &gt;&gt; all the way back &gt;&gt; to a needen condition &gt;&gt; before sin ever started." &gt;&gt; Friends, &gt;&gt; the three-fold mystery of Christ, the mystery of God revealed was what? To reveal himself in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; To then have preeminence in you. &gt;&gt; And in that preeminence, what is he doing? He's taken you back to an Eden condition to restore the original marriage covenant &gt;&gt; to where the two are one. &gt;&gt; You never did it. Oh, I'm telling you, God, help us get a real revelation of justification. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if somebody here will let the true revelation of justification strike your soul, you won't even know what to do with yourself. You mean I, Brother Windle, I I never sinned in the first place. &gt;&gt; Did you hear that, devil? You're going to you're going to hell for my sin, devil, &gt;&gt; because Jesus Christ already pardoned me and paid the price and he set me free. Take that, old devil. I am the bride of Jesus Christ and it don't matter what my past was. I already know my future. I am going in a rapture in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. I am going to be changed. I'm justified. What did it? Grace. Grace. Grace. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say we ought to be strong in faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't let me hold you back. &gt;&gt; We ought to be giving glory unto God. &gt;&gt; I said we ought to be giving glory unto our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. the mighty conqueror who took all of our sins, all of our faults, all of our failures. He nailed it to a cross on Calvary and said, "It is finished." And he went down to hell and he rose on the third day to declare, "I am alive forever more. I am the mighty conqueror." What a resurrection that was. And what a resurrection this is to be quickened. To be made alive by the quickening power of God that you never did it in the first place. You are perfect. I say that out of war shouting that I ain't trying to work you up. I'm trying to tell you the grace of God is here to call you out of all your dark situations, out of all your your your diseases, out of all your unbelief. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No circumstance, &gt;&gt; glory to God, &gt;&gt; will be considered &gt;&gt; when faith finds its bedding ground. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, I'm starting to feel pretty good. &gt;&gt; I feel like preaching now. Come on. &gt;&gt; The capstone, the mighty angel, the ancient of days, &gt;&gt; what they all longed for, what they all prophesied about has come &gt;&gt; in this day &gt;&gt; and called your name. &gt;&gt; We're talking about being called, right? Accept his call. Call means to utter in a loud voice to give a name. &gt;&gt; I no longer call you church. &gt;&gt; I call you bride. &gt;&gt; It's to call by name. &gt;&gt; Well, what do you mean, brother? Brother M. Who are you talking about? Who's calling? &gt;&gt; Master, if you would have been here, &gt;&gt; my brother wouldn't have died. &gt;&gt; He'll rise again. Oh, I know. I know he'll rise in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; He said, "I am &gt;&gt; the resurrection." &gt;&gt; I like to say it like this. &gt;&gt; I am the rapture. &gt;&gt; See, as long as you're with him, you're with resurrection. &gt;&gt; As long as you're with him, you're with rapture. As long as you're with the conductor, &gt;&gt; you will hit the sheet music, whatever it calls for. &gt;&gt; So, I'm just walking with him. He said, "I am the resurrection." &gt;&gt; And then what did he do? That same voice said, "Lazarus, come forth." &gt;&gt; I believe he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I believe it's the same voice calling to you right now. &gt;&gt; And I just want to say it like this. When he said, "Lazarus, come forth." It wasn't a suggestion. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Lazarus. If you can somehow &gt;&gt; No, he was calling. And the same one is here tonight &gt;&gt; calling. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell that old devil, this ain't a suggestion. &gt;&gt; It's prophetic. &gt;&gt; It's the same voice that said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; It's the same Jehovah that said, "I'll provide for myself." &gt;&gt; I will have a bride. &gt;&gt; He's calling to you. Look, I tell you, if these stones don't cry out, &gt;&gt; I mean, if you don't cry out, he's going to raise up stones. &gt;&gt; Ain't no stone going to take my place. Ain't no tree going to take my place. Ain't no man going to take my place. I'm going to bless them. I'm going to praise them. I'm going to worship them. Why? Because I heard my name. When those seven seals were opened and those thunders thundered out, it uttered my name. Matthew McGary, son of God, predestinated, come forth out of Ladya, come up higher into a bride age and sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Now ye are the sons of God. Now you are redeemed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; What shall we say to these things? &gt;&gt; If God be for us, Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? &gt;&gt; It's God that's justifith. &gt;&gt; It's God that declares us righteous. &gt;&gt; So, I'm trying to hone in on something. The same voice that cried Lazarus is now speaking to you. &gt;&gt; You are the pure. Now, I I want to go back. This isn't a suggestion. I'm sorry. I'm starting to feel good. This wasn't a suggestion. &gt;&gt; This was a call for a manifestation of the purpose of the seed that was already put there. &gt;&gt; You are the pure virtuous. I'll try not to be too much longer, but I am starting to have fun. &gt;&gt; You are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place. You are perfect. &gt;&gt; I want to say like Abraham, I am fully persuaded. &gt;&gt; That he which made the promise will perform it. &gt;&gt; It's not a suggestion. &gt;&gt; Look, I'm telling you, he's calling to you. Are you going to accept his call? &gt;&gt; We try to move towards a close here. I I believe God is calling to people. And I I I just want to say this. Accept means to receive, &gt;&gt; to allow, to expect the fulfillment of promises, &gt;&gt; second Peter 1:3 says, "According as divine nature hath given unto us all things." Everybody awake? &gt;&gt; Well, we're going to get down the home stretch. Just maybe 10 more minutes. All right, we feeling good. We got some people that traveled 14 hours and 20 hours. We got some people that are sleepy, some people that aren't, and we got all this. But you know what? Home stretch. Are we ready? All right. Second Peter 1:3. according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us &gt;&gt; to glory in you're called to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises that by these &gt;&gt; ye might be partakers of divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. Yes. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said in a statue of a perfect man, lust for money, lust for big things, lust for popularity, these things are dead to the believer. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, if they're not, you do not have to leave tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you hear anything under the sound of my voice, there is a risen savior here that is ready to perform in you the baptism of the Holy Ghost. that that first nature might be dead and you might be married to another none other than Jesus Christ. The literal life of Jesus Christ pouring out through your body. &gt;&gt; Lust for money, lust for big things, lust for popularity. These things are dead to the believer. We don't care. Attend or cottage. Why should I care? Live or die, sink or drown. This is the thing that I'm interested in. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God. Whether I maintain my home, &gt;&gt; whether I maintain my family, &gt;&gt; whether I maintain whatever it is, let me maintain Christ, &gt;&gt; our hope of glory. Build me up, oh Lord. This is a prayer now. Build me up, oh Lord, into this. &gt;&gt; Let Christ be my head. &gt;&gt; That working through me on my foundation, my faith that's in him. Let virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, and brotherly kindness work in me, oh Lord, is my prayer. &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer? &gt;&gt; I believe God is calling through these meetings. &gt;&gt; And I want to say, oh, let's accept his call. &gt;&gt; We got five more minutes. &gt;&gt; I should I should end. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in Matthew 20, many are called, &gt;&gt; but few are chosen. But I'm so glad to be the few and the chosen sir &gt;&gt; called to glory and virtue except his call. As in Revelation 174 would say this. These shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is the lord of lords &gt;&gt; and the king of kings and they that are with him are called &gt;&gt; and chosen &gt;&gt; and faithful. That's what he called me. And I just want to say what he said. I am the called. I am the chosen. &gt;&gt; I am the faithful. &gt;&gt; I want to say you are supernatural elected believers. &gt;&gt; You are the supernatural bride of Christ &gt;&gt; and you are predestinated for a plan and purpose. &gt;&gt; You are the bedding ground of promise. You are prophecy. &gt;&gt; Is there somebody that wants to accept the call? &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural gathering. &gt;&gt; The supernatural is here. &gt;&gt; Every once in a while, I don't mind talking to my arch enemy. Devil, you showed up to the wrong meetings. Because this is a supernatural gathering. &gt;&gt; This is the God called, the God elected, the God ordained, &gt;&gt; Bible believing, demon stopping, Holy Ghost fil, tongue talking. &gt;&gt; Brother Matthew, you're a Pentecostal by experience. &gt;&gt; I thought Malachi 4:5 was to restore me back &gt;&gt; to what they had. &gt;&gt; And we start fussing and we ain't even got it. But I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; They were in the upper room. &gt;&gt; They were all in one accord. And the baptism of the Holy Ghost fell and they busted out of there so filled with the Holy Ghost. They said, "Men and brethren, this is we are not drunk as you suppose, but this is that was prophesied by Joel. I want to tell you this is that that was prophesied by Malachi 4:5. I will have a bride." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Glory to God. &gt;&gt; What shall we say to these things? If God before us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? &gt;&gt; I like to say it like this. In other words, &gt;&gt; devil, you ain't got enough. &gt;&gt; You can't have my children. You can't have my health. You can't have my family. You can't have my mama. You can't have my daddy. You can't have my joy. You can't have my dance. You can't have my praise. I said if God be for us, who can be against us? Devil, you are defeated. This is the victorious, virtuous bride of Jesus Christ. We are going in a rapture. We are going in a potty change. We will put every devil under. I say it's time to praise him. It's time to worship him. Oh, lift ye up, oh ye everlasting gates, who is the Lord of glory, the Lord mighty in battle. There ain't no sea. There ain't no devil. There ain't no trial. There ain't no sickness that can separate you from the love of God if the musicians would come. What can separate you &gt;&gt; from the love of God? &gt;&gt; Not your mistakes, not your failures. &gt;&gt; If you didn't know where I'm from, just hold on, brother Kobe. I'm not done preaching. I just wanted the people think I was. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:4. &gt;&gt; Hey, don't sit down on me. We're just having fun. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:4. According, hey, I it don't get old to me. I I look, &gt;&gt; I needed a God &gt;&gt; to tell me over and over and over again, &gt;&gt; some people get past it. &gt;&gt; But I'm sorry. Call me vain. I can't hear it enough. &gt;&gt; Call me ordained. Call me predestinated. Call me the bloodbought. &gt;&gt; I I need to hear it because I live in a a lady you'll see a world out there in this realm. &gt;&gt; In my soul, I'm in a bride age. &gt;&gt; But I have to go out there and that lady you'll see a world. &gt;&gt; We don't got to get all caught up on that. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; And I go out there and there's enough Tommy rod out there to try to drag me down. &gt;&gt; There's enough stuff out there I say, I need to hear. I need to hear it on Wednesday. I need to hear it on Thursday. I need to hear it on Sunday. I need to hear it in my car listening to the prophet. I need to get down in prayer. I can't hear enough of what the word says that I am. &gt;&gt; According as he has chosen us in him. &gt;&gt; When did he do it? &gt;&gt; When you pledged your love to him? &gt;&gt; When you came to the altar? &gt;&gt; When you said you'd be a good boy? &gt;&gt; When you went to church three times in a row? &gt;&gt; According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. Now remember, he's calling &gt;&gt; not in a way of he might respond. I'm saying he's calling like he called for Lazarus. &gt;&gt; It's not an option. &gt;&gt; That we should be holy &gt;&gt; and without blame &gt;&gt; before him in love. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "My sheep know my voice and a stranger they won't follow." Quit listening to the devil who tries to tell you you won't make it. You're not bride. You messed up. Don't listen to that. Why? It was put there by predestination. You were for ordained to a son of God. You were in God before the foundation of the world. You're only manifested in this day for his honor and glory. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Kind of like that. Good. Oh, I'm sorry. You're over there. See, I do that to remind myself because if not, it's okay. I'm I'm coming. I'm getting close. &gt;&gt; Kind of like that eagle just hatched out in Lady Oia. &gt;&gt; Why am I eating this? &gt;&gt; I guess it's all there is to eat. &gt;&gt; Now, now we're being hatched out maybe in the wilderness or maybe we're being hatched out on message pews. But see, if you've never been born again, &gt;&gt; you're still in the chickenard. &gt;&gt; You're in the chickenard of sin. You're in the chickenard of a oneman denomination. &gt;&gt; You're in the chickenard of your thoughts. You're in the chicken yard of what you can muster up. &gt;&gt; But see, that eagle was predestined. He got to pecking around. After a little while, he's like, I don't you know what? What is this? Well, you know what? I guess I'll just do what they do. But you know after a little while &gt;&gt; because that chicken was what? He was predestinated to be in the heavens &gt;&gt; and then when he saw Malachi 4 I'm talking about us now something of 60 years ago. But when you see a living word made flesh, &gt;&gt; when you see sons and daughters of God, bride members who are anointed with the same spirit, &gt;&gt; the same manifestation that came in Malachi 4:5 is now testifying in the wheat field of many more wheat seeds coming to maturity. And something in you when you hear the spoken word and you see the life of the prophet and you see it echoing out in the lives of the people, something in you starts to call within you. Hey, I want to be that. &gt;&gt; And I like this. We'll just end along these lines. Prophet of God said he saw a being like he wanted to be. Remember we were talking about the sheath wave. &gt;&gt; I could just take it back there. We know Christ was the original sheath wave. He was waved back to us in this day and came to maturity in a first one in Malachi for in brother Brandon. Is that okay? And now it's testifying to the rest of the wheat field of what we are going to be. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, see, talking about that eagle, he said he saw a being like he wanted to be. Go ahead and play, brother. Selling in the air. Maybe we can do that. Uh, set your wings to the wings of faith. &gt;&gt; He said being what he wanted to be. Selling in the air, screaming free. &gt;&gt; I wonder, do you ever feel like that? You see another believer or you see something or you see something at a camp or special meetings and something you says, I want that. [Music] Now, Satan will try to get you to try to imitate somebody &gt;&gt; or manufacture an experience. &gt;&gt; And some people will preach against that in such a way that they devalue the desire inside of you &gt;&gt; to want to come up higher. &gt;&gt; I feel his presence right now. [Music] He saw a being that he wanted to be sailing in the air, screaming free up in the highs, above all the vultures and things of the earth. [Music] The prophet said he wanted to be that because it was in him to be that. Does anybody hear what I'm saying? I want to manifest every word that's been spoken by Malachi 4:5. Not because I can. Not because I have ability. Not because who my mom or daddy was, but there's something in me. I got to be that. I want to be that. Because you see, the prophet said, you want to be that because it's in you &gt;&gt; to be that. I wonder if somebody's ready to accept his call. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Do you accept it? &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandon would say hundreds of times, "Do you accept me as God's prophet? Do you accept your healing? Do you accept Jesus Christ as your savior?" You know, accept means to receive, to take hold of. And and I was thinking about this just to give a natural type. I thought it was profound. But in last year in 2024, there was a lottery that was worth 1.13 million billion 1.13 billion. Somebody had purchased the winning ticket and they never came to claim it. Now, I don't know what happened to that individual, but could you imagine when the deadline passed, maybe you got back in town, maybe you came back out and you heard the news and you're like, I wonder if that was me. And you opened it up and you said, I I had the winning ticket, but it's too late now. It's the dispensation of grace is over. You failed to accept it. It was in your possession. I thought, can you imagine that in the natural here? They were calling this is the winning number. Does anybody have it? And here it's in our possession and we're walking around poor and downtrodded. Reminds me of that story. You know, you heard about woman had a good son and he went overseas for business. [Music] He was a good son and she said he sent pictures every once in a while, but she got into all kinds of troubles financially and she couldn't pay for anybody. And she started to somebody come over and was trying to help her and say, "You mean your son? He's he's never sent you any money. He's never he's never gave you anything to help you out. She said, "No, no, but he's he sent me some really beautiful pictures." And the man said, "Well, let me see it." He started to look at all these pictures and he said, "These are banknotes. You're you're rich." The prophet of God said, "If we would just take our fingers through the Bible of God's promises, we're more than millionaires of the riches of his grace." He said, "Those he has called, &gt;&gt; he's justified. He called them before the foundation of the world. Those he called, he's justified. And though he's justified, he's already glorified." The same God that before the foundation of the world called you your name and wrote it on the Lamb's book of life in the book from the foundation of the world has already made a place in you for glory. Maybe we'll just bow our heads. The prophet of God went on to say, "All the devils out of hell can't erase it out of there. God's word has done spoke it. It's just as sure as to happen as God wrote it in there before the foundation of the world. Amen. How glorious our heavenly father is in his infinite love and his mercy to do that for us. Said, "Be ye therefore perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect." How can you be? It's not my perfection. It's not your perfection. It's his perfection of his word that he chose you. You never chose him and he brought you to Christ and you are secured with Jesus Christ. And just as perfect as Christ was before God for you're not standing with your own, you're standing in him with one thing. I believe God and I love him. I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh in your body. Is there somebody here that wants to accept his call? I'm not looking for any type of response. I just know he's calling. You accept it as he comes to you. Why don't you just talk to God? Why don't you worship God? Just let God deal with your heart. [Music] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just welcome to where you're at? &gt;&gt; Start dealing with your heart and your life. what you've been doing in your &gt;&gt; private time, the way you've maybe been treating your wife. &gt;&gt; Maybe you haven't been a good example to your kids. &gt;&gt; Look, I say God's going to be calling during these meetings.

A relationship with him. God living in you, reflecting his life through you. And to know that he has called me for that. He's just not calling me at a whim. But I've been forever in his mind.

It would have been nice to been down through the ages, but this is the final age, the final day just before the rapture. This is the day that God's calling us to a faith that is so divine. &gt;&gt; And our faith is going to believe like no other age until these bodies will be changed. &gt;&gt; And these words on this book has got to become divine revelation. &gt;&gt; You can't do it. It's not you making it happen. It's just you saying, "Lord, here I am. Here I am. I just want to love you and I want you to just have your way in my life. I want to become your expression. I want your glory to be in me. How many wants that here tonight? Hallelujah. I want it tonight. Bless the Lord. Didn't you enjoy that here this evening? Hallelujah. [Applause] Glory to God.
