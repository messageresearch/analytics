just good to be here um PA amen and uh with everyone and um certainly enjoyed the the message this morning and uh just a masterpiece and um we certainly was blessed by that amen if you have your Bibles um we're going to turn to the book of Isaiah the 6th chapter amen and um appreciate uh brother Wendell for allowing us to speak to you tonight really tried to get him he should be up here ministering or brother Jonathan and uh I was just content sitting there listening amen but we pray that we can say something to help you amen uh but the book of Isaiah the sixth chapter and we're just going to start at the first verse says in the year that King Uzziah died I also or I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer father it is a real honor to stand behind this sacred desk here in pawy to minister to your people Lord we don't take such a thing lightly and Lord as we just humble our hearts and humbly ask you to come and use use these mortal lips father that you would speak to your people and Lord I pray that something can be said tonight Lord that would um help Father and that would stick to our hearts and give us strength for the journey we thank you Lord for speaking to us this morning but Lord just now asking you'd speak once again father we ask that you would touch brother Wendell help him sister fresa encourage them Father encourage this church Lord father going through uh Time Lord of loss and um the family brother Miguel and Sister Amy sister Thalman Weston here father Lord we just pray that you would comfort their hearts we ask it oh Father in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen you can have your seats this evening and um you know brother brandham had used this scripture uh when he had preached on influence and what a a powerful sermon it was um if if you hadn't listen to it or been a while you ought to go and listen to it I uh it's just a um uh profound but uh and not to get into everything that he he preached but um thinking of this uh uh you know uh uh here am I Lord send me God looking for someone someone that he could send and of course before he could send um that someone has to come under the influence they've got to come under the influence of his presence but it's it's really hard to to imagine or to believe really that God actually sends people like us or at least I could look at it for me it's hard to believe that he called me he would choose me to preach the gospel or to um uh uh just even be a Christian and And yet when you know when he called us of course it was before the foundation of the world but when we really felt that nudge in our heart to to start serving the lord I don't think any of us really had an idea of the difficulties and the challenges that we would face yeah and sometimes we would look and and people paint uh you know Christianity has just been a happy go-lucky and and but it's not really that that way we heard it today that you have to fight for every inch of ground uh that you possess doesn't mean that it's not yours it just means you're going to have to fight so God didn't tell us the things that we we have to face and um I tell you even you young people you growing up and you may not really understand this but there's a lot of things that you'll face in challenges of life and um but but we all we all go through this whether it be a preacher uh or the lay member parents uh what whatever it is uh there there are challenges that that we deal with and uh uh and and I I will say that if I had to do it all over again I wouldn't change a thing um I I now when I say that I I'd certainly want to be more faithful to him I'd want to be more loyal to him but uh uh I I certainly wouldn't choose another path uh I thank God every day for his grace and his Mercy but you know we're we're here uh in paoni because of the loss of of love one Abigail and or Alba Jo and and you know I know that it's been a a rough uh time um a lot of um uh you know you you've been dealt a a hard blow uh the sudden loss and anguish and things like that and and I tell you it's it's hard to lose the loved ones especially when it comes suddenly uh upon us and and these things and and and you know we I I don't want to stand here talking about the the loss but I do want to encourage you uh because a lot of time Satan can come in and get us all distracted and and and I know we got to grieve and I know that that that you know uh uh we we we we feel the loss and the morning and and that it that that comes naturally that is something that just happens uh there but um uh when when it's when it's all said and done we we've got to still look that we have a purpose in life and and and we got to think about what is our future how are we going to react to this loss how uh uh is it you know uh is it going to affect us in a negative way or is it going to affect us in a positive way uh you know some go out on a drinking binge when when things go wrong or uh they just give up on life and and before you know it they just they just go crazy out in the world and they forget their future they forget about themselves they forget about uh those around them and and uh and really they just make it all about themselves uh you know I and and and I don't mean to sound hard-hearted if you think I am please forgive me but um you know I I was thinking when I had lost uh my wife uh Rebecca and and uh it was just a of course a sudden thing and uh Devastation uh had had my children five children uh to take care of and didn't know how I was going to do it and and um it it you all remember it most of you I guess and and and my world was turned upside down and and uh I honestly didn't know what to do and you know I I I thank God for for brother Wendell sister fresa and the church here uh brother Jonathan Sister Laura and and just all of y'all for for just coming in on the scene and and really helping us and uh you know and and and these things but you know I I wanted to give up in life I I just wanted to give up I I just didn't think I could make it I you know I remember when Rebecca told me you know said the Lord's going to take me home and you know I I said oh you know uh that that's that's just not right uh you're you're wrong on that one cuz I just I can't handle it I wouldn't be able to handle it I said You' be able to handle it more than I would if I would go first and um uh she said well no she says you know I just wanted to let you know that I'm I'm going home to be with the Lord and uh but I just didn't believe it cuz I I just didn't think that you know uh there was just no way that I could live without her and with all the children and and uh just everything and um but but the Lord did take her home and uh uh so it it again it left me devastated and I I remember I left the children you know over at uh my mother-in-law's house and and just asked her to take them uh for for a while and and I just took off um uh didn't know where I was going to go I I I you know and and I know brother Wendell had uh remembers you know I my life was up and a roller coaster it was just a real mess and and U not that I doing anything wrong I just uh just trying to get my bearings and uh but I remember I had gotten into a hotel and just stayed there and the next morning uh uh Dolores had called me and uh she said Sean she said your children are crying for you you know and you know so they want their daddy you know and uh so when when that that happened I I made a vow to the Lord vow to myself that I would never leave my children again uh because I knew that they needed somebody to be stable for them they needed somebody to be a rock they needed somebody to to to to to keep on pressing on and it it really brought me back into Focus that that I do have a purpose in life and just because something bad happens and sometimes we measure the bad we measure things well I can handle this but I really don't think I can handle this and to be honest it seemed like every trial that we go through we just can't handle it but uh uh but God always brings us through the trials but I I I thought of this that that God God has a purpose in what he's doing it if it was up to me uh that that event wouldn't have happened if if it was up to you a lot of things that you have gone through in life it it just wouldn't happen but it's not up to us it's it's it's up to God and and God knows exactly what he's doing and does that hinder us uh from fulfilling the commission absolutely not you understand what I'm saying and and so if if if if God has called us if God has ordained us for a purpose to do something in life then all of our negatives ain't going to stop itl can you sayen go cu cu I know it's easy for like us you know you young people it's it's easy for preachers to get complexes how many's ever had complexes well we we have complexes and sometimes uh uh you know it's hard to even sometimes to stand behind the pulpit because of of complexes it's it's hard to uh uh maybe to to do things that God has called us to do uh because of complexes and and these complexes they build up through through uh uh stumblings or they they build up through the path of past things that have happened and and it you know Satan just uses all kinds of ways to try to stop us from our commission but one thing about it we cannot we cannot focus on on the negative of our life we cannot focus upon the failures of our life we cannot focus upon the obstacles of our life as we've already heard this morning we're called to overcome can you say amen God never called a perfect person to preach the gospel he's never called a perfect person to sing to sing or to testify or to play the music or he's never called a perfect person amen uh uh to be a Christian can you say Amen so in other words we're not living in this bubble without TR and we're not living in this in this this uh uh sphere where there's no problems and there's no there's no heartaches and there's no loneliness and there's no thing you know there there's nothing that bothers us can you amen we we we all have them I I think if we would all stand up and really bear our soul there's so many things that we have issues with and and maybe we struggle with or or or we we think and and and sometimes the devil will tell us that there's absolutely no way that that we're good for anything you know uh uh you know many times the devil tells me you're just not much of a Preacher you know you're not a preacher and and you don't know how many times that I don't want to get up here and and and preach because you feel like you ain't doing any good and I guarantee your pastor feels that way I guarantee brother Jonathan feels that way and and if preachers feel that way you could just imagine what singers feel you can just imagine what daddies feel in with their children or husbands feel with their wives or wives feel with their CH moms and children and and wives with husband we all fight things and we all go through things and we all dealing with things I don't think there's any any person here that can say well I've I'm I ain't got no issues at all and I'm doing good and I don't know what y'all's problem is amen I I don't think that's it at all amen but a lot of times we focus too much on the negative of Our Lives amen and we use these as excuses amen for for for not doing what God has called us to do but I'm going to tell you something no one can take your place no one could take Caleb's Place amen when he come into that mountain and or when he come into that Promised Land don't you know and I really like you know brother Jonathan uh just kind of naming the enemy that Caleb had to face yes Caleb had to deal with natural Giants amen but we're not dealing with natural Giants we are dealing with spiritual things like anxiety or complexes or or or uh embarrassments or negativities and and and and and all of these things that are trying to keep us from what God has actually called us to do but see nobody could take Caleb's place it was up to him to take his Mountain it was up to him to defeat the enemy it was up to him he could not say well I I'm going to look at at at brother so and so because he just seems more able he's more better at it and he's more talented and he's more this he's more that the the Giants in in in in uh uh uh on uh uh the inheritance of Caleb would not been defeated but Caleb had to face up to it and realize it was his responsibility to take his inheritance and nobody could defeat his Giants nobody amen could take the mountain he had to take it himself and and I'll tell you no one can can can fulfill the commission that God has called you you're the one that's got to fulfill that commission can you say man you're the one well what did Brother brandham you know and you know brother brandham had complexes and he wanted to give up he had determined that he was going to give up and not not not preach anymore not he was going to go out and the and and and live like a Herman you all know the story amen and God did not accept his excuses God did not say oh well you poor little thing you I understand you're getting rejected I understand you feel like you're unworthy I understand that things you're going through you just go ahead and I'll raise up another Malachi 4 no it wasn't going to happen there was no other Malachi 4 there was no other Prophet that God would send to us the responsibility fell upon brother brandham his ministry and he had to fulfill the commission he had to fulfill it yes sir you believe it he had to fulfill it and so you know um and and so God CH show showed him you know that that if you if you if you do exactly what you think you're going to do then I'll show you what you'll become it ain't going to be a prosperous life you understand what I'm saying it's not going to be a prosperous life and I tell you what if you're called of God it's not going to be a prosperous life if if you're running from your call if you're running from your commission how many homes have been wrecked because people would not uh uh uh follow the commission that God had H how many churches have been wrecked how many lives have been wrecked because people amen built up complexes or they built up and they they looked at the negative more than they looked at the commission but God wouldn't commission you if he wouldn't stand by you can you say Amen now Caleb you know just thinking of Caleb he was the elect of that day meaning that he was predestinated and and you know when God created the world of course you know there was Caleb uh there there was a a portion of property of land that God had reserved for him and and so when God created the the the world you know there was that mountain there was that portion that God had predestinated this is going to be for Caleb this is going to be his inheritance and and and and so you know through all of this God knew the time that Caleb would be born he knew that he would come to that Promised Land he knew that the Giants would be occupying it he knew that that land would would would you know God God could have kept everybody off that said no this is for Caleb you stay away from that and this is for Caleb you know and and and you can't have this and don't you touch that or or he could have let them live there and then said you know Caleb's coming you know and and so I want y'all out of here you know and he could have drove no no but that wasn't it Caleb had to drive the Giants off he had to fight them things can you say Amen but but God had order already predestinated that land for Caleb and had predestined Caleb for that land that's right no one could take his place you believe that so Caleb Caleb had to lay claim to that mountain give me my Mountain that's exactly what he wanted give me my Mountain can you say Amen now you know I'm thinking of Jesus of how that Jesus was predestinated it's what the prophet said and no one could take his place he was predestinated for a purpose and and with this it wasn't a it wasn't a a trial free life it wasn't just easy coasting amen he he was tested tested on every point do you believe that tested just like every one of us are you know uh uh for just a moment Abraham was tested amen he was tested that God had promised him a a a land and told him to get out of his the this Homeland and and and so Abraham did and and then told him he was going to bless him with the son and that he would have a seed and and and and he would be air and and and yet he was tested you know I I I thought of that uh Hebrews 6:15 says so after he patiently endured he obtained the promise can you say Amen now you know and and brother brandham emphasizes there not before but after after he had patiently endured can you say Amen so so the there has to be a a a testing so Abraham first received the revelation of the promise and I think just like all of us we we we come to a personal revelation that that this this word is mine and I I pray that it really gets down into every one of us even to you young people I know we can go through the ritual of church and and this it becomes a duty and it becomes you know probably you know maybe s to some an obligation I hope you're past that and and and to where you really have a desire uh uh to come to the house of God and and to serve the Lord but but then it has to really become a revelation that that every promise in this Bible is mine and that God's got something for me I'm not here just sitting on a bench I'm not just here in pawy wasting my time God's got something for me I I I I I I think so many people lack Revelation they look at the bigger churches and they look at all of this and they they they they want to be part of something huge and big and and all that and and and and and you find people people just just going here and going there and and and you can't find people any stable hardly anymore these days but I I think it really takes a a personal revelation of of why I'm here why are you here in PA why am I here can you say Amen well that God's got a purpose for you God's got a commission for you somebody's got to shine the light somebody has got to see the Glorious Gospel of this message can you say Amen some are called to City Life some are called to town life some are called whatever but is everywhere I just believe that God's got a witness somewhere somebody that's going to understand their calling and the purpose that God has for them can you say Amen but no matter where you go there's going to be trial there's going to be disappointments there's going to be heartaches there there there's going to be times of loneliness there's going to be times where where Satan really just rocks your [Music] boat can you say amen amen see but but if you can understand and have that Revelation that no matter what happens no matter what goes God will never never fail me he will never leave me can you say Amen you know uh so so we we find amen you know brother Bram talking of Abraham and how he patiently endured and we all know that it was not an easy life for Abraham remember even the times that he had the opportunity to choose where or well he was separating God told him to separate from life and it was Abraham that gave lot the First Choice he said that's what Christians do always give the first choice to to the to others and lot looked upon the plains of Sodom and Gomorrah he looked upon the glamour he looked upon these things because he did not have a true revelation of God's purpose and he chose the the sin and he chose the beauty chose the glamour chose it all and there was old Abraham out in the desert living in tense but he had a commission he was given a promise yes he had to patiently endure yes he might have been laughed at and scorned and it seemed like God was forgot about him it seemed like the promise would never happen but he still remained true brother brandom says no matter how hard it comes and what it looks like what anybody body says you know he says you know I want to with patience I want to with patience not fretting you know he says person can't have patience and Fring all the time you've got to set yourselves everybody say I've got to set myself C I've got to set myself yes sir see and and and right straight there and walk right on no matter what takes place you just move right on Hallelujah h how many believes that you just move right on in your times of trouble don't you forget God in your times of Tears Don't You Forget God he promised he'll be a comfort he promised he'd be a way maker he promised he would be a provider amen that's what he is because if he called you to do something he going to bring you through he going to bring you through this trial he's going to bring you through all these your tears will be dried up your heart is going to be mended Hallelujah can you say Amen the thing is stay with God stay with the commission stay with the purpose stay with what God has called you to do you remember what brother Brown said he said people are afraid that God won't keep his word they're afraid but if God has called you then he's going to keep you you believe it he's going to believe he's going to keep you now we we find you know brother brandham said he says Jesus no matter if he was in a storm and the gaale is knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in the face in a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knew it was going to happen because God said so everybody say God said so God said so he didn't say oh I have I prayed through wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious he believed what God said was truth the words must be fulfilled and he know what his life was to fulfill them and he said and you're here everybody say I'm here to fulfill it too you're here to fulfill it too ain't that right so he says just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious unto the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying attention to the right or the left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep walking with God Amen said Enoch walked one day like that he said you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore can you say amen he said you're going to have your ups and downs but don't worry you got to go through the Brier patches and over sharp rocks and over the Bluffs and down through the Hillside and up through the mountains over the waters but walk with God hallelujah God's commissioned you can you say amen I pray that something was said that'll help you a little bit you understand where we're at today what brother Jonathan was saying we're in the land we're in the land this is the there there's no other people do you realize Caleb is your type he he types no other people Caleb is your type the prophet said he's the type of the end time believer that is following this end time message can you say Amen that there there's no other type I mean uh uh that that there's no other age that Caleb typed you're that type and and if you want to know your future look at Caleb brother Ram said you could take this Bible and find some character and you can know what your purpose is and what your future is and what your outcome will be amen so if you look at Caleb you can never fail if you look at Caleb it's it then you know what you're supposed to do in this age if you're looking at Caleb then you know that God will be with you right Hallelujah the word commission it means command or decree and uh Webster it says you know he he says commission is a formal written warrant granting the power to perform various Acts or duties an authorization or command to act in a prescribed manner so so it in and if if you're going to receive the commission if you've received that commission then that means you have been sent God has sent you how many believes that God has sent you I I'm I'm not going to take much longer but God has sent you God didn't call you just to sit on a Pew God has sent you to be be a light I thought of of of of this weekend of uh uh as I sat there and just heard the the reports and the the testimonies and uh uh this church made such an effect upon so many people the lives of so many people this weekend uh uh be because you you found yourself not just hiding but you found yourself in in in action showing the love of Christ that's true can you say amen that's true and yet it's it's not that you're perfect it's not that you ain't got mind battles it's not that you're free from things but you're a you were willing to push that aside and and let God use you can you say Amen well that's what it means to be sent somebody that's going to do the job somebody that's going to fulfill the commission somebody that's going to work somebody that's going to be put in action somebody that's going to realize I want to be part of what God's doing young people be part of what God is doing I I just appreciate you you young men and young ladies uh willing to play the music and God's raising up somebody to be a part of this thing we're a part of this God's God's got somebody that's going to fulfill that commission amen and when you're sent then there's an authority yes sir do you believe that amen it's an authority it's just like if you were sent by the United States and and and you're on a uh a commission you know from the president and the president asked you to do something well then you've got the authority of the United States behind you ain't that right you've got all the power of the United States behind you because you've been sent from the the the the government of the United States can you say Amen well you know God uh go God's you know he's he's he he wants to save people and I'm I'm glad for that but he's not just satisfied and saving you he's not just satisfied and bringing you into a mess of church but he want to put you into action put you into action can you say Amen you say well I ain't got much to do oh yet you do have something to do you've got somebody that's watching you you've got somebody that's that's that's that's uh uh uh looking after your life and and every one of us the prophet tells us are an influence we're going to influence somebody come on parents you're going to influence your children you can you say Amen you're going to influence your children preacher is going to influence others every one of us is going to influence somebody and we can we can get so wrapped up in in ourselves to where we just forget about everybody else amen and and and and you know and and and then that's when you know people fall apart and and and these things uh but in these trials amen is when God has got you shining the greatest cuz people want to know how true is that God that he claims to have how real is that God that these people claim to have can you say Amen when they see you in your tears and they see you amen and and they see you heartbroken but yet you're staying true you're still worshiping God you're still proclaiming the gospel you're still saying oh God I love you can you say Amen you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to work all kinds of great things amen just a simple life a steadfast life a a a life that is is is uh uh steady in in serving the lord can you say amen amen if we ever need a a people to Be steady in God it's now do you believe that I know we're living in a in an age that's so selfish so selfish we we just so wrapped up in ourselves and woe is me and woe is this and woe is that if I don't feel good that I ain't going to do anything and if I'm just discouraged that I'm just going to go hide and and not show my face around I don't care who's looking I don't care you you understand what I'm saying and and and when we get that way we don't realize that there's people that are watching us may we press past our complexes may we press past the discouragement wait may we press past the the heartbreaks and may we press past if you got to cry cry but dry them up and still serve the Lord can you say Amen don't quit Church don't get baled down and laugh and done you know you understand what I'm saying I hope you do amen stay true if you fall down get up if you make your mistake get up you've been commissioned you've been commissioned can you say amen I love the Lord but God still got some people no no matter how of a selfish age it is and I'm I'm going to clo but it's it's hard to I I'll be honest as a pastor you know more and more I I was talking to one Pastor in North Carolina and he he said you know ever since I I was pastoring started pastoring he says I never I never realized how precious it is to have faithful people that want to work in the kingdom of God very rare these days cuz everybody's got focus upon themselves we we get so focused upon our problems and our own issues and our own things that that that and and Satan gets us there and we can get there hello we can get there we can get so feeling sorry for ourselves we can get so bogged down in our own pity on troubles or on this or own that but remember you've been commissioned Hallelujah press the battle yes sir press the battle no matter what Somebody's Watching you're going to influence somebody you're going to affect somebody even if you don't feel like testifying testify of God's goodness why because someone needs to hear it even when you don't feel like coming to church come to church cuz somebody needs to see you even when you don't feel like saying amen say Amen anyway cuz somebody needs to hear it I'm going to just tell off of myself I got so discouraged one time I was I was in a meeting and and I got so bogged down just thinking of things of problems that were going on at home and I I got so bogged down in that service that I couldn't even lift my hands I was hearing the preacher preach yeah I agreed with everything he was saying but I couldn't even lift my hands it it was it was a it was something that just overwhelm I got so into a depression setting in church people worshiping God everywhere I mean it was a power packed service but I entertain negative I entertained that thing and it it overcame me and I realized what I was entertaining was greater than just a thought it was giving me thoughts and I was dwelling on it and before you know it it overcame me and I sat there and by the end of that service I mean people were worshiping and I just sitting there just like oh God and you know what I was I was crying for Mercy to the Lord Lord if you'll just help me I I won't do this by your grace I I won't entertain this again oh God if you just deliver me you understand what I'm saying and I thank God for that that Deliverance but a lot of times we can sit in a church and we entertain these negative hello we can entertain these negatives of wo is me and I just don't know if I'm going to make it and can I say this way do you know why it's important for your pastor to or you to come to church to hear your pastor preaching you know why it's important to hear services like you've been hearing and brother Jonathan's been he preached this morning and why it's important his church to to to hear what he had to say and and you you understand it's important for the congregation to hear the ministry that's preaching the message because you are you know you come out of Babylon you know which Babylon means confusion you come out but it's our job to keep you out keep you out of out of struggles keep you out am well how is that because the preaching of the Gospel will set you free preaching the promises of God will set you free don't give an inch to the devil don't don't let the devil discourage you in such a place that you just give up come on don't you give up serve the Lord with all that you can and not just come to church and set on a Pew but testify of him when you're out on a job or when you're at work or wherever you're at at school or whatever testify of him when you're at home just worship him hallah it's a commission as parents we've got a commission to keep the right atmosphere in our home can you say Amen when you want to argue when you want to fuss and you want to fight and you want to hold them bitterness is in you watch your children are watching can you say amen amen uh uh uh uh Satan going to try and if you let it he'll split that marriage right [Music] up we got a commission church can you say Amen it's our job when we come to the house of God not to fall asleep come on church let the power of God flow can you say Amen not sit there and just watch our preacher preach pull pull if there's any a people that know how to bring a Revival in a church it's us the prophet taught us how to come to church the prophet taught us that it's not the preacher that has the Revival it's the people that pull on the gift that brings that Revival we've got a commission don't give an edge to the devil don't let the spirit of God dry up in the church yes sir you understand what I'm saying got young people that need
