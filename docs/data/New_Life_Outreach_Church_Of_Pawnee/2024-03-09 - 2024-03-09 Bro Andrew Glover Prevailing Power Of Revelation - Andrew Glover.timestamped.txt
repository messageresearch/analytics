[41:18] they're not trying to draw you to

[41:24] God of this message
[41:27] and it's the God of this message that
[41:29] amen that you're experiencing here and I
[41:32] I thought it was I thought it was
[41:34] incredible when brother Andrew was
[41:36] ministering last night he says just
[41:39] preach the message because the anointing
[41:43] will follow the
[41:45] word and you've noticed that as these
[41:47] brothers have have just labored over
[41:50] that word and amen just settling our
[41:53] hearts that the word is right have you
[41:55] noticed how the Holy Spirit has come
[41:57] right back behind that to vindicate that
[42:00] to your
[42:01] heart there's been a lot of Amen people
[42:04] who ministers who have who have preached
[42:07] the gospel for amen some preached the
[42:10] gospel for 30 40 years and have walked
[42:12] away amen from this message and and you
[42:15] know why because they've never had the
[42:18] experience that you have you want to
[42:22] know a living God you are walking in
[42:26] with the Living God not with a god of
[42:31] yesterday a god of of William Branham
[42:35] who had died a long time ago brother
[42:37] branam introduced us to a Christ that
[42:41] still
[42:42] lives and I believe they read that quote
[42:44] the other night where they said amen he
[42:46] says my my Ministry is to just simply
[42:50] introduce him and I'm so thankful that
[42:53] we have been introduced to a living God
[42:56] so we enjoyed that word here this
[42:58] morning and uh uh we're just looking

[52:54] God's children and amen we want to look
[52:56] here tonight in the Book of Romans the
[52:58] 10th chapter and I want to read here in
[53:00] the 17th verse and then we're going to
[53:01] go to the Book of Luke 1 but in Romans
[53:04] 10 And1 17 the Bible said so then Faith
[53:08] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[53:11] word of God now brother Bram picks that
[53:15] up and says hearing by the word of God
[53:17] he says or the word made manifest so
[53:20] we're not just reading something or just
[53:22] hearing about something that could
[53:24] happen might happen
[53:25] but it has happened so we're reading
[53:28] manifested word faith cometh by hearing
[53:31] and hearing by the word of God made
[53:34] manifest now in the book of St Luke the
[53:36] first chapter in St Luke chapter 1 it's
[53:40] a very familiar story of how that the
[53:43] angel came to Mary and spoke to Mary and
[53:46] he actually didn't just tell her
[53:48] something I believe he delivered her a
[53:50] message and in Luke 1 and verse 26 the
[53:54] Bible says in in the sixth month the
[53:56] angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
[53:59] city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[54:02] virgin a spoused to a man whose name was
[54:04] Joseph of the House of David and the
[54:07] virgin's name was Mary and the angel
[54:10] came unto her and said hail Thou Art
[54:12] highly favored the Lord is with thee and
[54:15] blessed art thou among women and when
[54:18] she saw him she was troubled at his
[54:20] saying and casting her mind what manner
[54:23] of salutation this should be
[54:25] and the angel said unto her fear not
[54:27] Mary for thou Hast found favor with God
[54:31] see there's that fear not and beheld and
[54:34] behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[54:36] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[54:39] name Jesus and he shall be great and
[54:41] shall be called the son of the highest
[54:43] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[54:45] Throne of his father David and he shall
[54:47] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[54:49] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[54:52] now watch this then said Mary unto the
[54:55] angel how shall this be seen I know not
[54:58] a man and the angel answered and said
[55:00] unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon
[55:03] thee and the power of the highest shall
[55:06] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[55:09] thing which shall be borne of thee shall
[55:11] be called The Son of God and behold thy
[55:14] cousin Elizabeth sheath also conceived
[55:16] in her old age and this is the six month
[55:19] with her who is called Barren for with
[55:22] God nothing shall be impossible now
[55:25] watch after all the things the angel
[55:27] tells Mary here's what she says be it
[55:31] unto me according to Thy word so after
[55:35] all the things that he just delivered to
[55:37] her the only thing she could say was be
[55:40] it unto me Lord according to Thy word
[55:43] and the angel departed from her I want
[55:46] to look also in the book of Acts the
[55:48] 27th chapter the book of Acts the 27th
[55:51] chapter amen y'all forgive me my voice
[55:53] is a little weak on me tonight but we'll
[55:55] just give the devil a black eye with
[55:56] what we got Amen in the book of Acts the
[55:59] 27th
[56:03] chapter in the 25th
[56:05] verse the Bible here says wherefore s be
[56:10] of good cheer for I believe Goden how
[56:14] many can say that tonight I believe
[56:17] God that it shall be even as it was told
[56:21] me so here in other words what has been
[56:24] spoken to Paul by Vision shall be
[56:26] exactly as it was said it shall not
[56:29] deviate or change it will be exactly as
[56:32] it was told me amen we ask the Lord this
[56:35] evening to add the blessing to the
[56:36] reading of his word as you can have your
[56:37] seats here this afternoon amen I want to
[56:40] by the help of the Lord if I could amen
[56:42] for just a few moments I want to speak
[56:44] to you here tonight and if I would title
[56:46] this I want to speak to you on the
[56:48] prevailing power of
[56:52] Revelation the prevailing power of
[56:55] Revelation you know this morning we
[56:57] heard that we should choose Faith over
[57:00] fear amen how many how many chose Faith
[57:03] this morning amen we heard that we
[57:05] should choose Faith over fear now
[57:07] brother B tells us in the message and
[57:09] have faith in God he said now acts chap
[57:12] 1:8 Jesus said that you shall receive
[57:15] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[57:17] upon you he said now not before when you
[57:20] get your PhD but after the Holy Ghost
[57:24] has come upon you you he said then
[57:26] you'll have power of Faith to believe
[57:29] amen it takes the power of Faith to
[57:32] believe in Romans chapter 10 and verse
[57:34] 17 the Bible said that Faith cometh by
[57:37] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[57:39] now when you read that from the
[57:41] Amplified Bible it says that faith comes
[57:44] from hearing what is told amen and what
[57:46] is heard will come by the preaching of
[57:49] the message concerning Christ in Acts
[57:52] 27:25 it says so keep up your courage
[57:55] men for I believe God how many can say I
[57:58] believe God and have complete confidence
[58:02] in him that it will turn out exactly as
[58:05] I have been told in the message brother
[58:07] B preaches a sermon called it shall be
[58:09] even amen as it was told me he said now
[58:12] oh don't you just love that it'll be as
[58:14] it was told me if the angel truly comes
[58:18] from God and is sent from God then it's
[58:21] bound to be it is a direct message from
[58:24] Glory
[58:26] it is a direct message from Glory now I
[58:29] believe tonight that we have received a
[58:32] direct message from gory how many can
[58:35] agree with me we have received a direct
[58:38] message amen from
[58:40] gory and the prophet of God said now
[58:43] there's angels of the Lord he says many
[58:45] of them they come to the Earth and they
[58:47] bring messages he said but when Gabriel
[58:50] comes there's something major going to
[58:52] happen see he was the one who announced
[58:54] the the first coming of Christ he will
[58:56] announce the second coming of Christ
[58:58] amen and he told Mary that thou H has
[59:02] found favor with God he said now what a
[59:05] message to bring her that thou H has
[59:08] found favor with God I believe tonight
[59:11] that we can say Amen that there was a
[59:13] supernatural being amen that met our
[59:16] prophet in a cave and delivered to him a
[59:19] message and it was not an opinion it was
[59:22] not an idea amen but it was a vision
[59:25] from God Amen concerning the Church of
[59:27] the Living God and the prophet of God
[59:29] said I truly believe amen that a
[59:32] supernatural being came to me and make
[59:34] these statements and I have not been
[59:37] disobedient to the heavenly vision I
[59:39] believe that if it is a supernatural
[59:41] being amen the supernatural being is
[59:44] going to make amen Supernatural
[59:46] statements they're not going to be
[59:48] natural statements but they're going to

[1:10:42] with anybody you know how he's going to
[1:10:44] do it because he's God I said he's God
[1:10:47] and when that Revelation drops in your
[1:10:49] heart you will see then that your faith
[1:10:51] is not an emotion your faith is not a
[1:10:54] sensation your faith is a substance amen

[1:11:22] will be faith is a revelation that is
[1:11:25] revealed to you it is not yet but you
[1:11:28] believe it will be he said see faith is
[1:11:32] a revelation of the will of God works as
[1:11:36] Faith expressed he has revealed it to
[1:11:38] you by his grace it's nothing you did
[1:11:42] you did not work yourself up into faith
[1:11:44] if you ever have faith it was give to
[1:11:47] you by the grace of God another place he
[1:11:51] says in an audience of people we're a
[1:11:53] prayer line comes through you will find
[1:11:55] some and they're all good people we'll

[1:12:01] themselves into it amen some just can't
[1:12:03] do it at all and others it's just by
[1:12:05] Grace it's just given to them now there

[1:15:29] have rapturing faith and what is Faith

[1:16:16] this word and th are the only one that's
[1:16:18] worthy of opening the word amen the lamb
[1:16:21] that was slain from the foundation of
[1:16:23] the world oh Lamb of God Amen come into
[1:16:27] our midst tonight in the power of thy
[1:16:30] resurrection and give us rapturing Faith
[1:16:33] amen there there the prophet is just
[1:16:36] identified that rapturing faith is going
[1:16:39] to come from the opening of the word if
[1:16:42] the word is not open there's not a
[1:16:44] release of rapturing Faith but if the
[1:16:47] Lamb of God who was in Revelation five
[1:16:49] was worthy to take the book and to open
[1:16:52] the seals and to loose the things there
[1:16:54] in then may I say to you tonight that
[1:16:57] same lamb has come in this meeting
[1:16:59] tonight to take the open book and to
[1:17:02] place it in your hearts amen not by
[1:17:04] sensation not by emotion but by the
[1:17:07] revelation of Jesus Christ that has been
[1:17:10] released from the opening of the
[1:17:13] word oh somebody shout the opening of
[1:17:15] the word can I say this amen the open of
[1:17:18] the word it's going to move the bride
[1:17:20] into the bride
[1:17:22] age proud of God said it amen somebody
[1:17:24] say well you better be careful what 1954
[1:17:27] brother Brandon was already referring to
[1:17:29] the coming of the Bride
[1:17:31] age now we all are message Believers
[1:17:34] right amen go study when you get home
[1:17:37] and on your table or you can even do it
[1:17:38] when you get back to your door you will
[1:17:40] type in these words bright age brother B
[1:17:43] does not introduce that term till
[1:17:46] 1965 but in
[1:17:47] 1954 he says we're now moving right on
[1:17:50] into another great age it's coming
[1:17:53] coming for the Rapture of the church and
[1:17:55] in this we're living in the time of the
[1:17:57] restoration of the gifts but it stumbled
[1:17:59] me to Big fine churches it sent Nazarene
[1:18:02] backwards it made Fanatics out of a lot
[1:18:04] of Pentecost but just the same God's
[1:18:06] moving right on and bringing in the
[1:18:09] rapturing faith amen for his church so
[1:18:12] the prophet of God is showing you amen
[1:18:14] that rapturing faith is not coming under
[1:18:16] just testification it's not just coming
[1:18:19] under sanctification it's not even just
[1:18:21] coming under the restoration the gifts
[1:18:23] but when the seventh angel shall begin
[1:18:26] to sound and begin to tile the loose
[1:18:28] ends together it will be the bringing in

[1:19:42] to another Universe we're trying to get
[1:19:44] back where we come from and we came from
[1:19:47] God and we got to go back to God and
[1:19:49] there's only one way to get there and
[1:19:51] that's by the way that God is providing
[1:19:55] it prophet of God said this one didn't
[1:19:57] come from the earth he come down from
[1:19:59] heaven because the mystery is all
[1:20:01] finished and when the mystery is
[1:20:03] finished amen the angel said that time
[1:20:06] shall be no more now watch this and
[1:20:08] seven Thunders am been throw their
[1:20:11] voices out he said what if it is
[1:20:13] something to let us know on how to enter
[1:20:16] into the rapturing faith so in other
[1:20:19] words it's here but you got to know how
[1:20:21] to get into it and in other words it's
[1:20:23] here but you got to move into the
[1:20:26] rapturing faith or let the rapturing
[1:20:28] faith move into
[1:20:31] you now this Angel didn't come from the
[1:20:34] earth he came down from heaven now let
[1:20:36] me say this accepting the Vindicated
[1:20:38] word is God's provided way to bring
[1:20:42] Believers rapturing Faith amen can you
[1:20:45] can you give me that first picture Amen
[1:20:47] in that first picture there if you'll
[1:20:48] look here and see amen there's a cloud
[1:20:52] okay if you you go to Revelation 10 and
[1:20:54] verse one I saw another Mighty Angel
[1:20:57] come down from heaven and he was clo
[1:21:00] with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his
[1:21:02] head and his face as it were the Sun and
[1:21:05] his feet as pillars of fire now watch
[1:21:07] this and he had in his hand a little
[1:21:10] open
[1:21:12] book oh God I wish I had the voice of a
[1:21:15] Thousand Angels right now he had in his
[1:21:18] hand not a little closed book but a
[1:21:20] little open book and he said his right
[1:21:23] foot upon the sea and his left foot upon
[1:21:25] the Earth and he cried with a loud voice
[1:21:27] as when a lion Roth and when he cried
[1:21:30] seven Thunders uttered their voices and
[1:21:32] when the seven Thunders had utter their
[1:21:34] voices I was about to ride but I Heard a
[1:21:36] Voice from Heaven say seal up those
[1:21:38] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[1:21:41] and write them not now listen friends he
[1:21:44] said I believe that through those seven
[1:21:46] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[1:21:48] days in order to get the bride together
[1:21:51] for rapturing faith so is this okay so
[1:21:54] the revelation of those seven Thunders
[1:21:57] amen will give rapturing faith and will
[1:22:00] gather the bride together amen for the
[1:22:02] Great Escape of the church because what
[1:22:04] we got right now we wouldn't be able to
[1:22:07] do it but there's something we've got to
[1:22:08] step farther amen can can you remember
[1:22:11] that can you hold that in your heart
[1:22:13] there's something that we got to step
[1:22:15] farther so there's a connection between
[1:22:17] the opening of the word and your walk as
[1:22:20] a Believer there is a connection between
[1:22:22] this Revelation and the way you walk oh
[1:22:25] come on church amen we don't stay in the
[1:22:28] same spots but we're walking with God
[1:22:30] just like Enoch walked we're walking
[1:22:33] with God on our bad days we're walking
[1:22:35] with God and on our good days we're
[1:22:37] walking with God when we feel like it we
[1:22:39] walk with God and when we don't feel
[1:22:41] like it we walk with God because we are
[1:22:43] under a Rapture anointing and it's an
[1:22:46] anointing to win it's an anointing to
[1:22:48] overcome it's an anointing to escape
[1:22:51] this age come on church we ain't staying
[1:22:53] in Leia we've been anointed to leave
[1:22:56] Leia by the revelation of the word of
[1:22:59] God that has been

[1:23:24] that's been laying there for thousands
[1:23:25] of years to

[1:23:31] let's talk about the open book amen when
[1:23:33] that book come open it released an
[1:23:35] anointing now it's okay I'm going
[1:23:38] preacher for a second we got to have
[1:23:40] enough Faith to take to be changed in a
[1:23:42] moment and be swept up off the earth now
[1:23:45] watch we'll find where it's written we
[1:23:48] don't know what they are yet but my
[1:23:49] opinion they'll be revealed right away I
[1:23:52] love a prophet's
[1:23:54] English and when it
[1:23:57] do that's language I can talk and when
[1:24:01] it do it'll give faith for the Rapture
[1:24:04] and Grace for that church to move
[1:24:08] out come on church it's moving
[1:24:13] time it's moving time when the
[1:24:16] Revelation that is contained in those
[1:24:18] seven Thunders are revealed to this
[1:24:21] generation it will give Faith to the
[1:24:23] bride to move out amen the Rapture is on
[1:24:26] the
[1:24:28] church oh God to move out we just move
[1:24:31] through everything we know of through

[1:24:35] mysteries of God we've seen the
[1:24:36] appearing of the great gather together
[1:24:38] the bride in the last days but yet
[1:24:40] there's something in there that we
[1:24:41] cannot lighten oursel will there's
[1:24:43] something another now watch we read
[1:24:45] Revelation 10 3 to 4 1: 4 now watch in
[1:24:49] verse 7 but in the days of The Voice
[1:24:53] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:24:56] to sound the mystery of God should be
[1:24:59] finished as Heath declared to his
[1:25:02] servants the prophets can I say what the
[1:25:04] prophet said the messenger of Malachi 4
[1:25:07] and Revelation 107 is going to do two
[1:25:09] things according to Malachi 4 he will
[1:25:12] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:25:14] fathers but the second thing he will do
[1:25:17] I'm feeling like the preacher coming on
[1:25:18] now but the second thing he will do he
[1:25:21] will reveal the the mystress of the
[1:25:23] seven thunders in Revelation 10 which
[1:25:26] are the revelations contained in the
[1:25:29] Seven Seals listen amen I'm going to

[1:27:51] great break for
[1:27:52] of the spirit of God in these last days
[1:27:55] we're now living in for another surge of
[1:27:58] the holy spirit in the church can I can
[1:28:00] I just stop here and say
[1:28:02] this you know why you're
[1:28:04] miserable it's CA you're when when
[1:28:06] somebody starts preaching on these
[1:28:08] things it's C you're eating things that
[1:28:10] they're
[1:28:11] just can I just say it they're just
[1:28:15] trash come on me if you if you're
[1:28:17] listening to radio preachers trying to
[1:28:19] figure out about the com of the Lord
[1:28:21] don't get mad at me but it's
[1:28:25] trash but what if I told you T not we
[1:28:27] can go get the real
[1:28:31] stuff what if I told you not there was a
[1:28:34] place we could throw the trash away and
[1:28:36] go get some good
[1:28:39] Revelation back back I hope it's okay to
[1:28:41] tell this Timothy back in September we
[1:28:43] brother Timothy and sister Ruth and
[1:28:45] sister Katie they met us down in in
[1:28:47] Texas Mar Malachi and just just we had a
[1:28:50] wonderful time with them just a couple
[1:28:51] days of get they just give us a
[1:28:53] wonderful time of rest and fellowship we
[1:28:55] went to an ice cream place there I think
[1:28:56] it was next last night and man they had
[1:28:59] all kinds of good reviews and
[1:29:00] everybody's talking about how good it
[1:29:01] was and you go in there and get the best
[1:29:03] ice cream in town so we all go in there
[1:29:05] you know and and we got a bowl of it
[1:29:07] we're all sitting around there and all
[1:29:08] of a sudden I took a couple bites but
[1:29:10] you know uh I'm not a pck eater right
[1:29:13] brother Timothy but but I wasn't going
[1:29:15] to say nothing cuz I I thought everybody
[1:29:17] else was enjoying it you know and all of
[1:29:19] a sudden God bless Timothy he said said
[1:29:22] this is
[1:29:23] trash I said Thank God somebody else
[1:29:26] believes it is amen amen he said fold
[1:29:28] this stuff away I said there's an andies
[1:29:30] down the road and I'll pay for
[1:29:33] it so we threw the trash away and went
[1:29:35] and got for real stuff and it was real
[1:29:38] good it had a good taste in it young
[1:29:40] people you ain't got to sit and eat a
[1:29:43] bunch of denominational trash there is a
[1:29:45] reality of the opening of the word you
[1:29:48] can feed on the truth of the seven
[1:29:49] Thunders you can feed on the truth of
[1:29:51] seven and seals you can feed on the
[1:29:53] truth of the third pull you can throw
[1:29:55] away the trash and go to the house of
[1:29:57] God and feed on the real stuff it's not
[1:30:00] a bunch of confusion it's spiritual food
[1:30:03] in new season it's got vitamins in it
[1:30:06] it's got Holy Ghost vitamins it's got
[1:30:08] body changing vitamins you can throw
[1:30:10] away the confusion and go eat on the
[1:30:12] Revelation until it releases a faith in
[1:30:15] your life to believe God for things
[1:30:17] beyond what your flesh will let you
[1:30:19] believe him
[1:30:20] for now you can throw away the trash and
[1:30:24] go get the real stuff and you'll have a
[1:30:26] lot better
[1:30:32] Services now I know what you're saying
[1:30:36] you're saying this Rapture in faith this
[1:30:38] way out there because brother Andrew
[1:30:39] you're saying it's Revelation well do
[1:30:41] you realize the denominations they don't
[1:30:43] even believe in
[1:30:45] Revelation y'all realize
[1:30:49] that they don't even believe in
[1:30:52] spiritual Revelation but can I say this
[1:30:55] the true church is built upon spiritual
[1:31:02] Revelation now Matthew 16 the Bible says
[1:31:05] that Jesus Come into the coast of
[1:31:06] cesaria Philippi and when he walked in
[1:31:08] there brother Caleb there was all the
[1:31:10] disciples and he just he just kind of
[1:31:12] kindly walked in there and he looks at
[1:31:14] him and he says now who do men say that
[1:31:17] I the son of man
[1:31:19] am now I want to say this you and just
[1:31:22] leave that picture there for just a
[1:31:24] second that one right there who do men
[1:31:26] say that I the son of man am well some
[1:31:28] say you're
[1:31:29] Elias and some say you're jeremias but
[1:31:33] no who do you say that I
[1:31:36] am now wait a second now he's making it
[1:31:40] personal so he got a collective answer
[1:31:44] but now brother Austin he wants an
[1:31:46] individual answer so now he's saying who
[1:31:49] do men say that I who do you say that
[1:31:51] that I am now this is what amazes me is
[1:31:54] out of all the people that was standing
[1:31:56] there out of all the disciples that
[1:31:58] could have spoke up and said something
[1:32:01] the one with the most
[1:32:06] mistakes the one with the most failures
[1:32:09] the one that was a cussing preacher he
[1:32:12] lost his temper and cut a man's hair off
[1:32:14] he denied God he had all kinds of issues
[1:32:18] but when it come time to declare who
[1:32:21] this man was he was the one that spoke
[1:32:24] up can I say this will you always
[1:32:26] remember this so if God used Peter to
[1:32:29] say that it must mean that Peter had
[1:32:32] more Revelation than
[1:32:41] mistakes it must mean that his
[1:32:44] Revelation was greater than all of his
[1:32:47] mistakes in other words he didn't get
[1:32:50] that by mistakes so mistakes couldn't
[1:32:52] take it away he got it by the spiritual
[1:32:55] revelation of the word of God that had
[1:32:58] been revealed to him not by the Flesh
[1:33:00] and Blood of man but by my Father which
[1:33:03] is in heaven well I want to put every
[1:33:04] devil on notice tonight there is a
[1:33:07] generation here we got a lot of mistakes
[1:33:09] we got a lot of failures we got a lot of
[1:33:12] insecurities we got a lot of things in
[1:33:14] our flesh but I want to leave you with
[1:33:16] this our Revelation is greater than our
[1:33:19] mistakes our mistakes didn't put us in
[1:33:22] so our mistakes can't take us out our
[1:33:25] mistakes didn't save us our mistakes
[1:33:27] didn't redeem us our mistakes didn't
[1:33:31] hallelujah our mistakes has no authority
[1:33:34] to take us out of the rapturing plan of
[1:33:37] almighty
[1:33:41] God now in other words what is that rock
[1:33:45] it's the spiritual revelation of the
[1:33:48] will of God can I say this when that
[1:33:51] picture there
[1:33:52] appeared nobody had any authority to
[1:33:57] understand what it was to some it was a
[1:33:59] smoke ship to some it was a rocket ship
[1:34:02] to some it was a space shuttle to some
[1:34:04] it was just a weird figure now listen as
[1:34:07] long as as long as that picture Samuel
[1:34:10] as long as that picture hung there that
[1:34:12] picture right there had no authority
[1:34:14] over
[1:34:15] you you say be careful that picture
[1:34:18] right there in that form had no
[1:34:20] authority over you because there was all
[1:34:22] kinds of guesses on what it was but in
[1:34:26] 1965 when a prophet walks to the pit and
[1:34:29] says now I'm going to tell you what he
[1:34:30] told me he said you turn it to the
[1:34:35] right he says now that is our Lord up
[1:34:39] there come on Church you're down here
[1:34:44] but you're trying to get up there come
[1:34:46] on Church he's not looking up because
[1:34:49] his body is not above him but he is
[1:34:52] looking down because he's looking for
[1:34:54] the ones who this Revelation is going to
[1:34:57] take preeminence in their lives and it's
[1:34:59] going to change their bodies well may I
[1:35:01] say today that you are the mystical body
[1:35:04] of Jesus Christ and the headship has
[1:35:07] come our Lord is not looking for a body
[1:35:10] he's got a body our Lord is not looking
[1:35:13] for somebody to believe this Revelation
[1:35:15] he's got somebody to believe this
[1:35:18] Revelation our Lord is not looking for
[1:35:20] somebody to say what a prophet said he's
[1:35:22] raised up a generation and has anointed
[1:35:25] them with an open book to say what a
[1:35:28] prophet has already
[1:35:30] said I don't know about you brother
[1:35:32] Nathaniel but that picture claimed me
[1:35:34] amen it claimed my life it claimed my
[1:35:37] future it claimed the way I talk it
[1:35:39] claimed the way I walk it claimed the
[1:35:41] way I sing it claimed the way I shout it
[1:35:44] claimed the way I worship listen y'all
[1:35:46] get mad at me if you want to but I've
[1:35:48] been claimed for
[1:35:49] Rapture I have been claimed for the
[1:35:52] Rapture of the

[1:36:24] now young people let me say this that's
[1:36:28] not just a picture that's
[1:36:31] [Music]
[1:36:32] Revelation and I can say this
[1:36:35] day Revelation 101 is
[1:36:40] fulfilled in your
[1:36:42] ears in your ears that scripture has
[1:36:46] been fulfilled now let me ask you this
[1:36:48] what got you to this point
[1:36:54] what got you to where you're standing
[1:36:57] today cuz some of y'all had friends to
[1:36:59] walk off and
[1:37:02] leave come on now some of y'all had
[1:37:05] pastors to turn back on you and quit
[1:37:07] preaching the message and just walk away
[1:37:09] and leave you some of y'all has had
[1:37:12] situations that should have killed you
[1:37:14] years ago but you're still
[1:37:17] here can I tell you what did it
[1:37:20] revelation
[1:37:21] [Applause]
[1:37:25] what got you here was Revelation what
[1:37:28] got you through the Darkest Hours was
[1:37:30] Revelation what brought you to the most
[1:37:32] confusing moments was Revelation listen
[1:37:35] there was a time you couldn't clo a good
[1:37:37] quot and put a good scripture with it
[1:37:39] but there was something oh god there was
[1:37:42] something on the inside of you that
[1:37:44] caused you to say though the Lord slay
[1:37:46] me yet I will trust him amen can we just
[1:37:48] get real for a minute can we just get
[1:37:50] real really real for a minute and just
[1:37:52] confess that the only reason we're still
[1:37:55] standing is because the revelation of
[1:37:58] Jesus Christ was far superior to
[1:38:01] everything to every situation to every
[1:38:04] problem to every circumstance to every
[1:38:07] disappointment let me say this I rose up
[1:38:10] this morning because of Revelation but
[1:38:12] let me say this if that Revelation got
[1:38:15] you on your feet and the Devil Couldn't
[1:38:17] defeat it in he will not defeat that
[1:38:19] Revelation from changing your body
[1:38:21] devil it's too late I said it's too
[1:38:26] late the Revelation has already taken
[1:38:29] preeminence it's not just coming it's
[1:38:32] here it's in flesh form it's here in
[1:38:35] body form it's here in blood form might
[1:38:38] well come on somebody just get loose
[1:38:39] with me for a minute and say devil you
[1:38:41] should have got me when you could you
[1:38:43] should have got me when you had a chance
[1:38:45] you should have wh me when you had a
[1:38:46] chance you should have got me before
[1:38:49] this Revelation got me because this
[1:38:51] Revelation has claimed my body for a
[1:38:54] change in the moment in the twen of an
[1:38:57] eye hell can't stop it the Grave can't
[1:39:00] defeat it Devils can't defeat it Spirits
[1:39:02] can't discourage it it is the Invincible
[1:39:05] prevailing power of the
[1:39:08] Revelation Oh Glory Glory Glory that
[1:39:12] Revelation is in this building tonight
[1:39:14] and it's defeating Devils
[1:39:16] of it's defeating all kinds of
[1:39:19] devils and you're
[1:39:21] Rising now let me just say this to
[1:39:25] you there was a Baptist preacher called
[1:39:28] brother BR one day he said brother
[1:39:30] brandom he said I want
[1:39:32] to he said I want to straighten you out
[1:39:34] on your godhead amen I hate to ask this
[1:39:36] but it's getting cool up here so that
[1:39:38] can be turned up or something amen amen
[1:39:41] you want to straighten you out on your
[1:39:42] godhead teaching re said I got good time
[1:39:44] now he said straighten me up now he said
[1:39:46] brother Adam he said you teach there's
[1:39:48] one God he said that's wrong
[1:39:51] he said now listen he said there's one
[1:39:53] God in three persons brother said now
[1:39:56] listen you cannot be a person without
[1:39:59] being a personality and if you are a
[1:40:01] personality you are one personality
[1:40:03] yourself you're a separate individual
[1:40:05] being he said well the theologians can't
[1:40:08] even explain that so here's a Baptist
[1:40:11] preacher telling a Vindicated word
[1:40:13] Prophet that the theologians cannot even
[1:40:16] explain
[1:40:18] that here's what he said brother Caleb
[1:40:21] it's by
[1:40:24] Revelation so here it's not coming by
[1:40:27] what you can
[1:40:28] learn it's coming by how you can receive
[1:40:31] what's being revealed and I said now now
[1:40:34] now now now can I can I tell you what
[1:40:36] this Baptist preacher said he says these
[1:40:38] words I cannot accept
[1:40:44] Revelation wrap those words in your mind
[1:40:47] if you
[1:40:48] can I cannot accept Revelation now
[1:40:52] listen to The Prophet well I said then
[1:40:55] there's no way for God to ever get to
[1:41:00] you so the way that God accesses your
[1:41:03] life is by Revelation because it's hid
[1:41:07] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:41:09] but is revealed to babes he says
[1:41:11] revealed Revelation revealed to babes
[1:41:15] such as will accept it learn I said
[1:41:17] there' be no way for God to get to you
[1:41:20] now now I'm turning a corner now he said
[1:41:22] you close yourself off from him the
[1:41:25] whole Bible is the revelation of God the
[1:41:28] whole church is built upon the
[1:41:30] revelation of God there's no other way
[1:41:32] to know God Only by Revelation to whom
[1:41:35] the son will reveal him he said
[1:41:38] Revelation everything somebody say this
[1:41:40] with me everything is revelation now
[1:41:43] Weist said to the prophet not to accept
[1:41:46] Revelation then you're just a cold
[1:41:49] theologian
[1:41:52] and there is no hope for
[1:41:57] you if you cannot accept Revelation you
[1:42:01] become a cold Theologian and there is no
[1:42:05] hope for you you shut yourself off from
[1:42:09] God now I'm going to goe and preach
[1:42:11] since I'm this close to it we get in our
[1:42:13] mind that the only place that
[1:42:15] theologians are is in the Pulpit we
[1:42:18] think the only place that a theologian
[1:42:20] is in church is in the Pulpit but don't
[1:42:23] get mad at me but I preached a lot of
[1:42:25] theologians in the
[1:42:27] pews I can tell right now I'm preaching
[1:42:29] to somebody your facial expressions
[1:42:31] because here's what's happened you've
[1:42:33] learned and you figured out how God can
[1:42:35] never touch you again he can never bless
[1:42:38] you again he can never minister to you
[1:42:40] again he can never show you anything
[1:42:42] because you did this and you said that
[1:42:44] and you looked at that and you fa him
[1:42:45] here and so what you've done is you let
[1:42:48] a bunch of intellectual theology from
[1:42:49] the pits of hell put a wall around you
[1:42:52] and the word can't get to you the
[1:42:54] anointing can't get to you well don't
[1:42:56] get mad at me but you're a cold theolog
[1:42:59] oian but I'm going to say it's it's in
[1:43:01] the wrong place tonight because this
[1:43:03] ain't an ice house this is a firehouse
[1:43:06] this ain't a bunch of icicles this is
[1:43:08] the Holy Ghost in Fire and the fire of
[1:43:10] God will burn that thing down and God
[1:43:13] will get to you my God will tear down
[1:43:16] the walls of Jericho to get to his
[1:43:18] children my God will dop the red see to
[1:43:21] deliver his children let me say this can
[1:43:24] I preach to you now hope is returning
[1:43:26] tonight hope is coming back hope is
[1:43:29] coming
[1:43:30] back I've gone too far I can't be
[1:43:33] blessed I can't be healed I can't ever
[1:43:35] Shout again I can't ever dance again I
[1:43:38] can't never believe again that's what
[1:43:39] theology said but Revelation says
[1:43:42] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:43:45] that is in the world Revelation says
[1:43:48] that he is the God above all he is the
[1:43:50] god with you all he is the god in you
[1:43:52] all Revelation says though a thousand
[1:43:55] fall at one side and 10,000 at the other
[1:43:58] it will not come now
[1:43:59] [Applause]
[1:44:06] thee can you help me preach tonight look
[1:44:09] at somebody next to you and say these
[1:44:11] words
[1:44:13] Revelation brings
[1:44:16] hope you told the wrong person tell
[1:44:18] somebody else

[1:44:25] hope brother Peter
[1:44:27] Revelation brings
[1:44:30] hope brother silus Revelation I know

[1:44:43] Revelation brings hope are y'all hearing
[1:44:45] me theology shuts God off from you
[1:44:49] theology puts God away from from you
[1:44:51] theology puts you a little old corner
[1:44:53] and you can't hear nothing and you can't
[1:44:55] believe nothing but when the revelation
[1:44:57] of the word of God begins to break in
[1:44:59] the atmosphere that Revelation come on

[1:46:43] I'm going to turn my head toward the
[1:46:45] heels from which cometh my help the Lord
[1:46:48] is the lifter of my head I'm I'm going
[1:46:50] to look away to Jesus and I'm going to
[1:46:52] see him as the hope to get out of way
[1:46:55] without to see you as the Hope to come
[1:46:57] over all the situations he is the
[1:47:00] revelation of Hope and if you can see
[1:47:02] him you can see a new day oh if you can
[1:47:05] see him you can see a new future if you
[1:47:08] can see him you can see that the past is
[1:47:10] the past and it's in the sea of
[1:47:13] forgetfulness and there's a Hope by the
[1:47:15] revelation of the open book that's in
[1:47:18] the church
[1:47:19] tonight
[1:47:21] Hallelujah I'm not a crazy man I just
[1:47:24] feel like dancing cuz I got hope I was
[1:47:27] hopeless but now I got
[1:47:31] hope I shouldn't be here but I'm here
[1:47:34] anyhow because of that
[1:47:37] hope he is my
[1:47:39] [Applause]
[1:47:46] hope if the devil gets you in the valley
[1:47:49] he'll convince you that is going to bury
[1:47:54] you but all I can say is he better hope
[1:47:59] he picks the right
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:04] Valley brother Gideon he better hope he
[1:48:07] picks the right Valley if he's going to
[1:48:09] bury this bride he better do some
[1:48:12] research on What's happen in the valley
[1:48:15] he's got you
[1:48:16] in now y'all remember Joshua and Israel
[1:48:20] don't you
[1:48:21] the Bible says that Israel was the
[1:48:23] people of God brother Kobe I believe
[1:48:24] it's anointed to win
[1:48:27] right Israel was the people of God right
[1:48:31] God was on their side can I say this to
[1:48:34] you there was to never be a battle that
[1:48:37] Israel went into that they
[1:48:41] lost not supposed to happen there's
[1:48:44] never supposed to be one battle that
[1:48:46] Israel goes into and they lose it
[1:48:49] brother elah every battle they go into
[1:48:52] God is on their side in other words if
[1:48:55] they lose that means God can't win the
[1:49:00] battle to the devil if they lose that
[1:49:04] means that God is Not on their side and
[1:49:06] God is not able to win the battle but
[1:49:08] can I say this my God never
[1:49:12] loses even when it looks like he's lost
[1:49:15] he never
[1:49:16] loses even when it looks like that the
[1:49:19] devil has come in for the final kill and
[1:49:22] it looks like he got the W and we got
[1:49:25] the L he still is the
[1:49:28] loser I might as well preach there for a
[1:49:30] second brother Josh he is the loser the
[1:49:33] devil is the loser but I want to tell
[1:49:35] you tonight because of our
[1:49:38] hope because of our hope we are the
[1:49:41] winner we are the winners we are the
[1:49:44] generation who has been Anointed with
[1:49:47] the open book to win every battle
[1:49:50] [Applause]
[1:49:52] come on I don't know how else to say it
[1:49:53] other than when Mary heard the word all
[1:49:56] she could say was be it unto
[1:49:59] me according to the word now Israel was
[1:50:03] a promised people of Victory get
[1:50:05] somebody say the devil better pick the
[1:50:07] right
[1:50:11] Valley this feels good
[1:50:13] Josh the devil better pick the right
[1:50:17] Valley now let me say this Israel went
[1:50:20] and they fought the Battle of
[1:50:22] Jericho and they won the Battle of
[1:50:24] Jericho which was a really big battle
[1:50:26] but a few days later they go to another
[1:50:29] battle and it's called The Battle of AI
[1:50:32] or we can say it like this artificial
[1:50:34] intelligence no I'm just kidding they
[1:50:36] went from the Battle of Jericho which
[1:50:38] was a really big battle to a battle of
[1:50:41] AI and they lost so they won the big
[1:50:45] battle but they went to the little
[1:50:46] Battle of AI and they lost now when they
[1:50:49] lost Joshua didn't say well I guess God
[1:50:52] left the
[1:50:56] message when they lost Joshua didn't say
[1:50:59] well God was with brother badam so I
[1:51:00] don't guess he's with me well I guess he
[1:51:02] was with the ones before us but he's not
[1:51:04] with us now no Joshua knew if we lost
[1:51:08] there's something wrong and the Bible
[1:51:10] said that Joshua went and fell on his
[1:51:12] face and the Lord revealed to him that
[1:51:15] there was sin in the camp the Lord
[1:51:17] showed him amen that there was sin in
[1:51:19] the camp and the sin in the camp was aen
[1:51:22] and his family you know what aen done he
[1:51:25] took a gold wedge amen and took it into
[1:51:28] his tent amen and buried it underneath
[1:51:30] his tent and Israel went from Jericho to
[1:51:33] Ai and lost the battle now watch this
[1:51:36] amen because there was sin in the temp
[1:51:38] now you all know what happens amen as
[1:51:40] Joshua goes down there I love this and
[1:51:43] Israel and they burned Aon and his
[1:51:45] family they didn't play with Devils they
[1:51:48] burned him
[1:51:51] ain't politically correct I know but
[1:51:53] they didn't play with Devils they burned
[1:51:55] them they went down there to achen and
[1:51:57] they burned him and they burned his
[1:51:59] family and they burned his tent and they
[1:52:01] took his ashes and his family's ashes
[1:52:04] and they spread him out in the valley
[1:52:06] and covered them up with rocks now watch
[1:52:08] when Israel done that the next thing
[1:52:10] they did was they went to another battle
[1:52:13] and they was
[1:52:15] Victorious are you hearing me so ain's
[1:52:18] Valley his bones in ashes and his family
[1:52:21] is in a valley let me just say this to
[1:52:23] you if you go to the book of H of Hosea
[1:52:26] the 2 chapter and the 14th verse you
[1:52:28] will find that the book of Hosea is a
[1:52:31] beautiful story of redemption in other
[1:52:33] words Hosea is a prophet and Hosea knows
[1:52:36] all the mistakes he knows all the
[1:52:38] failures he knows all the shortcomings
[1:52:40] of Israel but he looks back at God and
[1:52:43] says God with all of their mistakes and
[1:52:45] with all their failures and with all the
[1:52:48] whoredoms and all the idolatry things
[1:52:50] how can you still love
[1:52:53] them how can you still go in a UK in an
[1:52:56] Oklahoma Youth Camp and bless them with
[1:52:59] the anointing and bless them with the
[1:53:00] refreshing listen we know what they've
[1:53:03] done
[1:53:04] Lord can I preach to you we know what
[1:53:07] they've done in other words Hosea was
[1:53:09] looking at God and saying God I don't
[1:53:12] understand how that you know all the oh
[1:53:15] my that devil don't like this you know
[1:53:17] all the mistakes of them and you still
[1:53:20] love
[1:53:21] them so Hosea begins to question Lord
[1:53:24] now let me just put it to you like this
[1:53:26] maybe the over look at Hosea and say
[1:53:28] Hosea let me show you something amen you
[1:53:31] go marry yourself a harlot and you have
[1:53:33] kids by her and then you'll understand
[1:53:36] why that I cannot forget
[1:53:39] Israel in other words they are a part of
[1:53:42] me and I am a redeemer and I cannot
[1:53:45] allow them to be
[1:53:48] destroyed they might have lost one
[1:53:50] battle but they're not going to lose
[1:53:52] every battle because I am their God I am
[1:53:55] on their side I am their comfort I am
[1:53:58] their F I am their General I am their
[1:54:01] [Applause]
[1:54:09] captain now if you go to Hosea 2 in the
[1:54:12] book of Hosea 2:14 look at this
[1:54:14] scripture therefore behold I will Allure
[1:54:18] her and will bring her into the
[1:54:21] Wilderness and will speak comfortably
[1:54:23] unto
[1:54:24] her so here God is telling Hosea through
[1:54:27] a story of redemption oh
[1:54:30] God go and Allure her amen now can I say
[1:54:34] this to you look at what this word
[1:54:36] Allure means this word this word Allure
[1:54:39] it means to attract her by opening
[1:54:43] something testing one two testing it's
[1:54:46] still working it means to attract her by

[2:03:55] baby and he's laying there dying because

[2:09:47] her this and tell telling her that and
[2:09:48] telling her this and telling her that he
[2:09:50] goes through all these things and when
[2:09:52] they're having this conversation brother
[2:09:54] Caleb there sometimes she stops him and

[2:10:18] defeated Mary's
[2:10:21] flesh that the only thing she could
[2:10:30] say when the angel delivered his message
[2:10:34] the only thing she could muster up
[2:10:36] enough strength to say was be it unto me
[2:10:41] according to my word the Angel's message
[2:10:45] robbed her of every excuse it stripped
[2:10:47] her of every idea it's so weakened her
[2:10:50] flesh that the only thing she could do
[2:10:53] was agree with the Angel's
[2:10:55] message the only thing she could say was
[2:10:58] it's the truth Lord but the Caleb in
[2:11:01] other words the Angel's message so
[2:11:03] brought her flesh into submission that
[2:11:05] her flesh couldn't even argue with a
[2:11:08] revelation well Church of the Living God
