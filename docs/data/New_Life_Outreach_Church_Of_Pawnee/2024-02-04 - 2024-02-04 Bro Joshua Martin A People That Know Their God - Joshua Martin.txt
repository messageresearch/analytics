tell you what I'm I'm excited about what the Lord is doing in our in our dayto day I I I believe the holy spirit is here in a in an incredible way and in our in this generation I I don't want amen as we have as we've been going through the church ages we can see um as as as you've been reading especially if you're if you're on into the second and third age you will see how how that that the the life of God was always snuffed out man when God would send a move then Satan would come in and he would he would let let put you know let the fire die out because the people didn't realize what was going on and the Antichrist spirit amen but brother brandham said that this last message must not denominate in other words we are not we are not giving an account to headquarters any Earthly headquarters here in on this Earth We're not giving an account to Jeffersonville we're not giving an account to um amen British Columbia or or or to uh Louisiana or to uh py Oklahoma we're giving an account for the message of the hour through the power of the Holy Spirit and we must never let the life of God leave this word amen never let life leave and you say well brother Wendell I've just never had it quite like they had it in Pentecost and I'm not satisfied I want to tell you right now you can have the very same life of God that they had on the day of Pentecost and if you don't if you've not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's not a greater time to receive it amen I believe the life of God is here to make that word to live not just in the preacher but to make it live in the congregation how many believe leaves that here this morning I I I I I'm thankful for what God is is is is given brother Josh and I appreciate all of the gifts of God Amen that they dedicate their lives to the Lord but remember the preacher is not here to entertain the preacher is here amen anointed of God to deliver that word and the Holy Spirit is here to vindicate that word in every predestinated heart I I I want I want God to vindicate his word in me this morning I want the life of God that's on the preacher to be on me too can you say Amen so as the man of God gets ready to come amen I I I I I want the fire Amen to fall on me and I I don't know this is maybe not the right kind of a song to to to to bring uh the preacher out but I want us to sing fire fire fire me amen fire fire fire fire fire fall on me fire fire fire fire fall on me just as the day of Pentecost fire fall on me just as the day of Pentecost fire fall on me let's sing it again fire fire fire fire fall on me fire fire fire fire fall on me just as the day just as the day of Pentecost fire fall on me just as the day of Pentecost fire fall on [Music] me do you want that here this morning Hallelujah fire fall on me hallelujah amen let's sing that song I just I just want to please the Lord I just want to please the Lord oh yes I do the is in every way to beong in his [Music] presence found in his likess here say Well done someday all together now my heart says [Music] hallelujah every way to be lost in his presence found in his likeness to hear him say Well done someday can we sing it again now I just want to please the Lord be in his will and every way to be lost in his presence found in his likess to hear him say Well done someday amen is that your desire when the battle's over with we fight the last mind battle and to hear those words welcome home th good and faithful servant amen that's what I want to hear amen if you have your Bibles let's open our scriptures to Daniel 11:32 you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen praise the Lord Daniel 11:32 and i' I've sort of been just reading through Daniel myself here lately and that's a powerful book to to go through and to listen to the messages brother Brandon preached on Daniel so I might take a little bit of that this morning a few different thoughts I pray everything can come together and make sense but Daniel 11:32 and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits amen can we bow our heads this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord what an honor and a privilege it is to come into your house father Lord you've been so good to us Lord you've kept us safe throughout the this last week Lord give his health in our bodies father Lord as we come into this part of the service I ask that you would speak through the lips of clay this morning Lord you see the hearts and the desires Lord the needs that are in the people father Lord I ask that you would move this morning in a mighty way father Lord send your anointing father send inspiration this morning we ask these things in your precious name amen and you may be seated and if I had a subject this morning it would be a people that know their God and brother brandom would would place the scripture at the end time and he would say uh and say this and that Daniel said about these last days how that they know their God and will do exploits and just so many scriptures tying in this day that we're living in how how that these evil deceiving times would be on the earth and just exactly what we're having now fulfills it they had a chance they had been given a chance to see the Messiah uh but they rejected their very Messiah and today it's the same thing the very same thing we are given the opportunity another place brother brandom says and Daniel said in the in that day they shall run to and fr knowledge shall increase and he he said and the wise shall know their God and that day and do shall shall do great exploits in that day but the wicked will not know the god of Heaven they know him in a form and in a ritual so the Bible is telling us of two different people two separate two separate groups and what's going to separate the two is understanding who God is and but the R would tell us the world has been given their chance to understand God have been given their chance to know him but they have rejected him but the only way we can do exploits is for a people to understand who God is and to know him but I don't believe that the people that the Bible is talking about is just a random people but it's a chosen people because if there wasn't a chosen people they would have rejected their chance to see him as well you see a caral mind can never understand the word never understand the message and many of us can never understand the message without God coming and revealing it to us so if it wasn't a chosen people a predestinated people before the foundation of the world we would never know God and would never be able to achieve what God has for that people and brother Brandon would say notice God when he called Abraham he didn't say Abraham if you would do a certain thing then I would do a certain thing he said Abraham I have already done it not what you did what I did what God did he said now when he made a covenant with Adam if you if you not touch the tree you'll live forever but Adam broke it Moses and them if you keep the Commandments I'll do so and so if you break the Commandments I'll do so and so when God makes a covenant with man man breaks the Covenant with God but so that the elected the church the elected people the called out separated group of people would sure to be saved God called them by his grace so this ain't just any people but it's an elected people that's been called by his grace it's a people that's a part of Abraham's not Abraham's natural seed but the Royal seed the faith seed so everybody is trying to be that people everybody wants to be the bride of Christ but not everybody is chosen to be the bride of Christ there's only one person one group that's been called by his grace that is the people not anybody you can't claim to be the people you you can't join the people you got to be called to be these people and the Bible would tell us I have you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and that's a revelation that we can grab a hold of in this generation I haven't put myself in the bride God put me in the bride I haven't put myself in this body in this people but God chose me to be in this people so if God has chose me to be in this body there's nothing that can keep me from do knowing my God and doing exploits brother Brandon would take that that that scripture and call it exploits of Faith he said it's a super race a a natural people with the supernatural God coming to them and doing Supernatural signs it's not that we're trying to achieve something it's one knowing our God we've come in contact with the supernatural being and the supernatural being is performing the exploits performing the Deeds performing the works but first you got to know who you are you see you got to know that it's Grace that has chosen you You' never be able to work your way into it it's the grace of God Peter was unable to choose Christ before the Crow twice but Grace still put him in the body it was Grace that said go tell my disciples and tell Peter it was Grace that chose him even though he couldn't choose him oh my and when whenever the Apostle Paul was denying Christ Christ still chose him and when maybe you denied this word maybe you've denied that you're a Christian throughout your life maybe you've got a past that you're ashamed of but you didn't choose it Grace chose you the grace of God before the foundation of the world says I'm going to have a people that's going to know me I'm going to have a part and in that people his individuals they might have failures they might got mistakes they might have might have things they're not proud of but it's going to be by my grace that is going to call them and place them in this people so that they can do exploits oh when the in the day where there's nonsense and there's a hypocritical going around there is a people that know their God by Grace know their God and they're performing the supernatural signs oh my that's why there's an invincible Army upon Earth they know they're God they've come in contact with the supernatural being oh Hallelujah it was Moses that had a calling on his life and wanted to do something for God but did not have the ability to do exploits but one time he come in contact with the supernatural God and what was inside of the burning bush didn't stay there but then come inside of Moses to perform the exploits and oh my I believe what was inside of this message is no longer just there but it's come inside of the people so that there can be exploits upon the Earth just like in the books of Acts oh Hallelujah people knows their God they've got to know their God Amen oh the Bible would say in Ephesians 1:4 according as he had chosen Us in him from before the foundation of the world so it ain't you know brother Brandon preaches you don't become a son of God at the new birth you was always a Son of God that's why you can be reborned so he wasn't chosen when we're when we're born on the Earth God didn't say okay I'm going to choose that one okay I'm not going to choose that one that baby's cute so I'm going to choose that one before you was ever on this Earth before Adam was ever on this Earth You was chosen to be a part of this people and you see so it ain't a natural bloodline that puts us in this people it's a spiritual bloodline because the Pharisees could trace their bloodline back to Abraham but they wasn't chosen they wasn't called but then there was a Samaritan of the wh that could not Trace her bloodline back to Abraham she was a Samaritan but God chose her God chose her to perform exploits so it ain't a natural bloodline it's a spiritual bloodline the Bible would tell us in Galatians 3 and 28 there was neither Jew nor Greek neither Bond nor free there was neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ then ye are Abraham's seed and hires according to the promise oh my so if we're a part of the a part of the spiritual bloodline then we are put in this people and their HS according to the promise oh my that means whatever Christ have we have it's not because I'm a Martin not because you're a Smith not because you're a green but because you were called by grace for this generation and put you to to perform the Greater Works and since we're called to be this people The Works of God is expressing itself oh my if you be Christ then you are Abraham's seat but Brandon would say Not seeds but seed he said because after Sarah had died Abraham Abraham had seven more children so it ain't seeds it's a seed and he said that and and it's not a natural seed but it's the spiritual seed the Ro your seat the people that know their God and I believe that is that this scripture is being fulfilled in this generation there are somebody that knows their God and I heard brother Samuel Browning make a statement one time he says we're not living in an hour where're promises are being made but we're it's the hour where promises are being fulfilled and I think my we're not we're not looking for God to make a promise that there's going to be a people that time is already passed we're living in the Fulfillment that there is now a people we're not looking for a people but there is now a people we're not looking for the Greater Works but there is now the Greater Works we're not looking for exploits the achievement of faith is now upon the earth oh my so I believe it's a literal people that the Bible was talking about a literal people knowing a reality coming in contact and experiencing the power of it and that's why I believe this message here's the realities of Jesus Christ without it being a reality you can never know him but once it becomes a reality you know him oh my you know brother brandom talks about the three room house he says you've got the kitchen you've got the living room and you got the bedroom he says in the kitchen you eat in the b in the living room you Fellowship but in that bedroom is when the one the man and the woman know each other and life produces and he talks about where where uh we got how un being there's the Body Soul and Spirit and he says it can come on the body it can come on the spirit but it needs to come inside of the Soul we don't believe from the spirit we don't believe from the body we don't believe from the mind we believe from the soul and so if it never anchors in the soul it's never a reality so if it anchors in the spirit when you're depressed it's going to move away if it's on the body when you're aching the Revelation is going to go away but if it anchors in the soul that's where life produces oh Hallelujah that's where life produces it's no longer just talking about the exploits it's no longer just feeding on the word but the word and the people the bride has come together in a unity and it's producing the life it's producing the exploits the promised child in this generation oh Hallelujah and that's why he makes a separation and if you read Daniel and it's going through some dark times it's saying this people's going to be Wicked they're going to do that they're going to do this but then he stops and he says but the people but I just love that word it's it separates the two it's a dark time they're Wicked they're doing this but there's going to be a people that's going to have a god anchored in their soul and because of that anchor they're going to produce exploits oh Hallelujah so if you want to see God you've got to understand God if you want to see the supernatural you've got to understand what the supernal is you see brother Brandon would say so many people have different opinions of Christ as as as I travel different parts of the country and around the world I find so many people have their different opinions you'll be surprised to know what some of their opinions are some of them thinks that he's a wonderful teacher and he says well he was that that that's just exactly and he says many of them thinks he was the great philosopher which he was that certainly he was and then some of them think he was a good man he was but see he was more than that he was more than all of that plus he says some of them think he was a prophet he was a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was the prophet plus and he says and see so we have to how would we know if he was teaching of his teachings he was a teacher he was a great philosopher but the only way we'll ever know him today is if we identify him for today and I believe that he raised from the dead I believe with all of my heart I believe that he's promised here he's the same yesterday today and forever so it's different opinions of Christ looking at the same word at the same individual but have different opinions but before you know him you got to know if you're right or if you're wrong you know it's always it's always aggravating when you're in an argument and you don't know if you're right you're you're just hoping that you're right because if you're wrong you're in trouble there's nothing backing you up you know and there's so many different people with different opinions but there's nothing there's no Assurance behind them backing up the word but God has sent us something in this generation where we don't got to be nervous we don't got to know if it's true or if it's right if we're in the Battleground with the SP spirit and we don't know but if we know our God if we know our God anchored in the soul we can go through every Spirit we can go through every complex we can go through every influence knowing what I'm standing on is true and if I'm standing on something true all of Heaven is backing me up bless the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my so that's why it's only a special class of people that can know him because knowing him comes by identifying him and not anybody can identify him you got to recognize him you remember when Nathaniel met Jesus it wasn't what Jesus was wearing that identified him to Nathaniel it was what Jesus was producing that identified him because everybody was looking up a garments everybody was looking up a parents everybody was looking at the outside and never identified him as the word for the day but Daniel didn't look at the garments he didn't look up parrots he looked at the word and says this is my identification this is what the word said he would do today oh man I believe the people is that way today we've identified the word for this generation we've recognized that this ain't something for the 60s but it's something for today it's not a god of yesterday but I'm identifying him as the god of today I'm recognizing that God can still heal the sick that God still keeps marriages together I'm recognizing him so that I can know him oh you got to recognize him in order to know him because you can look at somebody and if you don't recognize them you can never know him oh my you see I as an evangelist I go to new churches and I've only talk to pastors on the phone and it's so it's so crazy the mental image you can get in your mind if if you've never met nobody before and then you come to the church you know I went to I went to uh they had a a youth gathering on a Saturday and I just talked to the pastor on the phone and I walked into the the the Gathering the building and I didn't have a clue who this pastor was I'm just walking I heard his voice so I'm just walking around you know I didn't have a clue who he was and so without me recognizing him I could never know him if I seen a picture of him then I could compare the picture with the person and then I can recognize oh this is who it is oh come on now and that's what the scripture is it's a picture of what Christ is in this generation and without recognizing the Christ this word this message is what the Bible is talking about you'll never know him but what you recognize that this is thus sayith the Lord this is the word behold I send Elijah the Prophet this is the word that's getting a people ready for a rapture I'm the people that's going to know God and the way I'm going to know God is to recognize what he's doing in this generation oh I'm going to identify him so that I can know him oh Hallelujah you see brother the Brandon would say but what would identify him would be the identification that the scripture says that he would be and that's how we have to identify that's that's how we have to identify him that's the way he was identified then okay he says because he wasn't a spectacular man in a certain array of dress he had no organization that he boasted of he had no credentials from any certain Fellowship he couldn't he could say I I belong to the biggest or see he had he only had the works of God that was proven and spoken of that would identify him that was his credentials I just love that that was his credentials was the works that were spoken and proven and then brother Brandon would say his dress wasn't what proved who he was and I'm going to make I'm going to say something here too many times people's looking at the dress and and they're determining if God's going to move or not many people look at a certain preacher and say we're only going to see God if that preacher is preaching you're looking at the dress you're never going to see God if you're looking at a person you're never going to see God if you're looking at a gift but look past the dress look past the individual it don't matter who's preaching as long as it's the word of God oh Hallelujah as long as it's the word of God coming across the pull pit it is the supernatural it is Jesus Christ himself oh my but don't be look don't be guilty of looking at a certain vessel and instead of the word because he promised to send his word at the end time not a gift he promised to reveal the Mysteries not a mission not not a Ministry and so if you get focused at one thing we're going to miss we're going to we're we're not going to identify what God is doing but I say let's get our focus upon one thing not a Ministry not a preacher not a man but Jesus Christ the word for this generation then we can know God oh Hallelujah and brother Brandon would say this the scriptures is what testifies of him see that's what identified him him was the scripture you believe that that's what will identify him today then we know whether we're right or not whether it was him he was the same he would do the same and that just struck me as I as I read that this morning then once we identify him then we will know if we're right or if we're wrong it's simple as that once you identify him you're never going to have that voice in the back part of your mind saying I don't know if this is true I don't know if it I don't know if it's right but once you identify him come on now once you identify him all that goes away now I'm going to tell on myself for a second you know and I I've preached and I've believed that the seals are open that the mighty Angel come down to the Earthly angel with an open book and I've always believed that but I I I've looked for quotes and to be honest I never could find one and I don't know if I was searching the wrong way but I searched and I church and and there's many people that don't believe that and there would be times I would be preaching for individuals and that was in the back part of my mind that man if he ever challenges me on it I'm not going to have nothing to back it up but then one time we we was at brother Wayne's what a month or so ago and and we was talking with brother Wayne and he he he quoted the quote and I thought whoa that's what I've been looking for and it was great to hear him quote it but then he sent it to me and this is what brother brandham says talk about a jubilee talk about a time what the lamb walk forth see the books even sealed in heaven the Mysteries are say is my name there I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put there put there on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from before the foundation of the world and he took the book glory to opened the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people there you are and I'm telling you what just just to be honest I was liberated I read that quote and there was a courage that come inside of my heart say I it's not my word it's God's word it ain't me just saying this happened God said it happen and that's the way it is with the message once you connect it once you get a revelation something anchors them the soul that it's not my word it's God's word it's not my Rapture it's God preparing us for a Rapture I'm not trying to be good enough it's god making me good enough it's a courage that gets a hold of the soul that you can step through every critic you can walk through every unbeliever and still have an anchor amen oh Hallelujah I I identified with what I believed with God's word and I'm telling you what that place the courage on the inside of my heart that I can preach it I can preach through every critic I can preach through every skeptic and that's what makes these men of God so so incredible is they can preach through every unbelief they can preach through every Spirit they can they can preach through every nonsense because they know what they're saying is backed up and you may say well Josh I'm not a preacher but it's the same way with the congregation if you ever know your God you ever get a revelation for yourself it's no longer your opinion it's thus sayith the Lord and with thus sayith the Lord comes exploits oh Hallelujah thus sayith the Lord produces the exploits but you see a revelation then produces a courage you see it sees the victory you see brother Brandon was saying Little David standing there with a little piece of leather goat skin or sheep skin with two pieces of string tied to it but it was revealed to him revelation struck him amen he said the god that took me out of the poles of the bear that took me out of the poles of the lion how much more what he delivered that uncircumcised Philistine into my hand he identified that the same God that was yesterday is the same God that is today oh let's identify him today the same God that was with me yesterday is the same God that is with me today it ain't a hope so it ain't a guessing a guessing game but it's a revelation that the same God that was in the book of Acts is the same God today I've identified him that he is working today and brother Brandon continues on to say his brothers was more able to do what Saw Head and Shoulders above his army but you see it wasn't revealed to them oh man it wasn't revealed to them am man there it is they believed it could be done they believed God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them but it was revealed to David see there's the difference right there if it's absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you you're going to do it you're going to get it I don't care what's wrong with you what the odds are it may be worse than David and Goliath but if it is revealed to you oh you may say this one is more capable they don't got the Revelation you you've got the Revelation come on now you may say that one over there is smarter than I am that don't matter you've got the revelation God didn't come and anoint anoint David's Brothers he anointed David and gave him a calling to produce exploits oh come on now you may feel like you're the bottom of the bottom the lowest of the lowest the weakest of the weakest but if you can get a revelation no matter the odds no matter the opposition a revel is going to Prevail Hallelujah it was revealed to David that what God did yesterday he going to do today and he produced the exploits oh man it produced the exploits what produced it him being a person a people that knew his God right oh man and you can look through individuals throughout the throughout the Old Testament shamgar was is an Israelite he was circumcised he was called but without him knowing God He Was Defeated come on now we got to go on them we got to go farther than just being called we got to know our God that's the first stage of it is realizing we're called by Grace but then we got to move on into knowing god we got to know the person of this message you can quotes in scriptures is great but you got to meet the person Jesus Christ inside of this message and then that produces the exploits but then once Shem God realized who he was what God he he was serving then that produced the Revelation oh my if there's ever a people that can needs a revelation it's it's the people today that needs a revelation of who they are oh my you see because you remember the two that walked to the road to emus there was talking about Jesus in a day gone by and and I know this is pretty preach so much but it it just it really struck me that these people were these two men were talking about Jesus in the day gone by talking how he was going to be the Messiah he was this he was that and then here come Jesus walks up to him could you imagine could you imagine talking about somebody you never met and the person you're talking about comes up to you and says hey who you talking about and you turn to him and say you a stranger in these parts who are you you don't know who we're talking about and the person they're talking about is right in front of them but without identifying him they could never meet him oh come on now they were talking about a day gone by and without a without an understanding a present day truth you're going to put God in a day gone by but once you understand what the brandom says Jesus went from the went from the Old Testament went through all the scriptures preaching concerning him and brother brandom said says preaching will never bring Revelation you've got to receive it brother brandom says he went through all of the scripture concerning his life but then he stopped at his house in the evening time oh he stopped as the sun was going down and was acting as if he was going to go on but then the Bible says he they stopped him and constrained him come in with us and brother brandom says once they receive the word in then understanding come upon them their eyes was open and wanted understanding do with them do to them it took Jesus out of yesterday and brought him into today we know what happened the Bible says as he broke the bread they seen Christ and realized that the same actions that he did yesterday he's doing today but without identifying him they could never see him as today oh come on now but if we can ever identify him in this word that he is the god of today we can see the supernatural we can see the exploits we can see a god Mighty in battle this ain't a God of yesterday it's a god of today him the people that know their gods they've identified him as the same yesterday today and forever and it's producing the exploits hallelujah hallelujah it's recognizing God that he can do it today oh not just yesterday where thankful for what he did in the books of Acts in the book of Acts but what is he doing today oh my recognizing means to overcome yes you see brother Brandon preaches the message how can I overcome and he says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks lots of people say there was no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil devil and you must recognize him as real you must know he's a devil and then the same that you know he that you recognize he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god that is in you is mightier and greater than he is then once the and the one that is in you has already overcome him and by his grace you're are more than a match for him theirs were real overcoming when you recognize and something that D struct me and and you know as ministers can testify you reach something a thousand times and something just jumps out to you but the brandom says before you can overcome you don't just have to recognize the devil you got to recognize he's against you right right oh come on now you got to recognize that the spirits thr a plug in your mind is against you you got to recognize that the bitterness is against you you got to recognize that the gossip spirit is against you you got to recognize that that critical spirit ain't for you it's out to destroy you and before you can overcome you got to recognize what it really is oh because if you don't recognize it then it moves on to justifying the spirit you see definition of justifying actions is to prove or show that it is a reasonable that it's reasonable or necessary oh my so if you can never recognize that that spirit is against you you're going to justify it and as you justify it you make room for it I'm preaching now the spirit of criticalness would will split a church up it will split a family up it will split friends up but if you can never recognize that it's from the pits of hell it's going to destroy lives I'm preaching now you're going to justify it and say you don't understand what I've been through you don't understand where I come from you don't understand my make up you're justifying a devil that's going to I'm preaching now you're justifying a devil that's going to destroy a marriage destroy a family destroy your church but once you recognize you recognize that there's a real devil a real spirit and he's against you but then recognize that there's a God on earth that is greater than every Spirit greater than every critical spirit greater than every every gossip Spirit then you can find a freedom then you can overcome hey many people wonder why they can't overcome it's because they're entertaining Spirits many people under can't understand why their children can't overcome they entertaining Spirits many people think how come I can't get a move of God you're entertaining spirits but once you recognize that those Spirits are from Hell watch a victory come through your home watch your family become a Powerhouse Hallelujah that's what we need today is some parents to recognize that these spirits that I'm letting in my home are not of God they're are the enemy come on somebody we got to recognize that what we're playing with is going to destroy us true remember the man in Portland the sworded kill brother the Brandon he ran up to brother brandom and brother brandom says today you're going to fall over my feet he fell over his feet and the and the people come up to him and said wow brother Brandon is he delivered he says no he worships that Spirit come on now he worships that spirit and so many people I'm just preaching this morning so many people come to church and they lift their hands they praise God but they're justifying a critical spirit and that's the reason that their children is in the condition they are today what did Brother brandom say it's not children delinquency it's parent delinquency brother brandom says you are your parents Holy Ghost come on now the Holy Ghost is to guide them to lead them and if you got a A critical spirit that is guiding them and leading them where are they going to end up at come on now but I say let's recognize what the devil is let's recognize what the spirits are let's recognize that this is taken me down but there's a greater force that has been poured out upon the Earth today where the brandom say all of hell has been turned loose in this generation but all of Heaven has been poured out upon the briide you may feel like you can't overcome but just recognize that there's a greater force that has come to a people hallelujah it's come to a people to make them produce exploits Hallelujah so you got one side that is justifying their Spirit but then you have the other side that don't know how to overcome that Spirit come on now then there's the middle of the road you see they they realize that the spirit that's got a hold of me I can't overcome it I know it's of the devil I and if you're that way this morning you're on the right Road come on now if you realize this morning that where I am at I don't want to be at you're on the right road but don't ever get on the other side where you're justifying spirits that has taken you taken the power of God out of your home taking the power of God out of your life oh my hey I was studying on these things and this St coming to me this morning and so hey don't get mad at me if we can just recognize that what the devil's trying to put on us is of the devil then we might be able to overcome that's not what he said you can overcome but on the other side there's the people that says lord I can't overcome what do I do recognize the there's a greater force recognize that there is a God that's come to a people that is wanting to produce exploits you see the power of recognizing I believe that's what Daniel was talking about a people that know their God recognize their God identify their God identify what's going on then they can do exploits and that's what I love about this message it is the mystery of God revealed it's no longer the blind leading the blind but there's an understanding in this generation and that's what I love about it where the Brandon would tell us the revelation of God is what gives the authority over the devil and so the people that know their God get a revelation of their God then will overcome the enemy oh my but you see brother random would say through the church ages no one should have looked back and says man I wish I was with the apostles he says no one should have looked back wanted to be there he says this here and and think of it not one believer of any age should have a cry in his heart oh I might have been back there in the first stage when the apostles were sent out there was no need to look back look up he says Behold Him who is even now walking in the midst of the churches through all of the ages he says Behold Him who was the same yesterday today and forever and who never change either in essence or in his ways where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in their midst not only in their midst as a as a complacent onlooker or as a recording Angel but he stands there expressing exactly what he is he says there's no need to look back look up there's no need to look back and say man I wish I was back there he says look up and recognize that he is still walking in the midst of of the church ages the same God the start of the church is the same God that is going to complete the church and I like how brother brandom says that behold he is the same yesterday today and forever behold look up Behold Him who is even now walking in the midst of the church ages and the word behold means to look and that just struck me as I was reading that this morning the word behold is to look look behold look him who is even now walking in the mid of the churches and the Bible would say in John 1:29 Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world John was proclaiming look we're not waiting any longer but recognize here he is the Lamb of God who is to take away the sins of the world recognize him what's Malachi 4:5 say behold I send you Elijah the prophet look I'm sending you a message I'm sending you a prophet I'm sending you a visitation for your generation look behold look recognize what I'm doing I'm sending a word that is going to turn your hearts back to the original fathers to produce the original exploits you just got to look look turn your faith back recognize what I'm doing I'm walking even now in the midst of the candlesticks and brother brandom quotes that scripture who walketh in the who who walketh in the midst of the candle s and he says how meaningful are those words when viewed in the light of the scripture he says this he says those words were viewed in the light of the scripture who describes him as Christ who is our life for Christ indeed he the life of the church she has no other life without him she is simply a religious Society a club a meaningless Gathering of the people a corpse bewi and dressed is still a corpse so the church no matter what her programs and her gracious efforts might achieve without Christ she is a corpse also but with him in her midst with him motivating her she becomes to the wonderment of all of his body the fullness of him that filth all in all and this very hour he is walking in the midst of the last Age golden Candlestick what he was what what he was when he walked in the first stage he is even now in the last age Jesus the same yesterday today and forever amen how meaningful are those words when viewed in the light of the scripture that just struck me when viewed in the light of the scripture what is the light of the scripture this word this message a shine to light upon the scripture so once you look at it through the light of the scripture then you recognize him as our life you don't Rec we're not just a a useless Gathering we're not just some some Society but we've got the Life of Christ on the inside we've recognized him and now that's put us in a position to do exploits you see the exploits of faith hope this is okay this morning it's going to come by understanding who God is not a god of yesterday but a god of today not in not a God in a in a in a body of Flesh 2,000 years ago but a God in a body of Flesh today you see the Bible would tell us that the mystery of God should be finished and I believe the understanding of who God is has been poured out on this generation and I like how how dad put it uh a few months back I think he says that John puted the mystery of God should be finished he says it's finished to the bride but it's not finished to the church World it should be finished but it's still a mystery oh my let us not be thy way looking up the word and it's still a mystery oh Hallelujah but it's a special class of people that is going to see the mystery brother Brandon would say you recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is actually the revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in future ages then then I mention that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we fail to get it bringing those two thoughts together you will see it it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost oh my so it's not just reading and listening it's having the Holy Ghost reveal it then once it reveals it we identify it and it puts it into action he says this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight and I say Lord that's me I'm the people with prophetic Insight that can look and see what God is doing you know brother brandom says prophetic insight has been swapped with a bunch of Creeds but he says there is still a prophetic class of people we're not swapping the word with Creeds we've identify the word and have embraced the word so that we can live the word and he says it will it will require the ability to hear from God oh my it will require the ability to hear from God you know what that means we got to unclog some channels we got to unclog the channels we got to get things out of all that and that's what I was saying earlier about justifying Spirits if you justify Spirits it clogs the channel and then brother the Brandon is saying the only way to get a revelation is the ability to hear from God oh my let us let's let's make a dedication this morning Lord I'm unclogging the channels if I need to throw Spirits out I'm going to throw them out if I need to get things out of my life I'm going to get them out if I need to burn things in my home I'm going to burn things in my home because I'm that I'm the people that you're talking about I want to know you God I want to know my God but first we got to have the ability to hear from God Amen it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse to verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear oh it requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how do we hear from God and lay ourselves how do we how do we how do we hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know oh how we need to hear from God pardon me how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit and hear to know all right how to become yielded and you know I talked some on uh on humility last time and this scripture I've been preaching out of a lot lately and this really struck Me 2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves my people humility is a hard thing that's guys can testify of that to humble yourself and say I'm sorry to humble yourself and say I was wrong to humble oursel and say you know that action was wrong I did this wrong it's a hard thing but he's saying my people has the ability to Humble themselves if my people he didn't say if anybody will humble themselves I will come and heal their land but he says if my people which are called by my name if my people who's called by grace shall humble themselves and pray seek my face turn from their Wicked Ways then I will hear from Heaven oh I want God to hear my prayers I want God to come and he I request for my family I want God to hear me but first it's going to take humility come on now it's going to take somebody to Humble them himself and say Lord the direction I'm going is not the right way the spirits I'm entertaining is not the right way what I'm justifying in my life is not the right way I'm willing to humble myself you see brother Brandon would say therefore God reveals not to the world not to the psychologists not to the educated ministers but to the humble in heart his people who is Meek he will reveal the secrets of the great things of God to them he says you see it the secrets of the great things of God the mystery of God has been revealed but he's only going to reveal it to the people who are humbled in heart humble in heart not the psychologist not the educated ministers but somebody that is humble to the word of God you look at Daniel Daniel 1 and8 but Dave Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of King's meat nor the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might if might not def file himself so we see it starts out this is the first chapter of Daniel this is when he's just a boy and he's there in Babylon I believe and this is something we can as young people can take to heart the first thing Daniel done was purposed in his heart then what happens the next verse Daniel 1:9 now God brought favor brought Daniel into favor oh my you want the favor of God purpose your heart you in favor with God humble yourself and we see the Bible would saying Daniel one 15 and at the end of 10 days their countenance appeared fairer and fatter in flesh oh my that just th stood out to me as fear appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat so once he purposed his heart God brought him favor and then he's performing exploits all right now when his flesh is producing the power of God that none of the other children had oh my you want to stand out in the midst of drugs purpose your heart you want to stand out in the midst of Gossip purpose your heart you want to stand out in the midst of of criticalness purpose your heart and watch God Elevate you above all the rest of the children you may see what do you mean Elevate watch the power of God the supernatural God work through a young person work through a mama work through a daddy but first it's got to be a purposed heart the Bible would say in Matthew 12 35 a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringing forth evil things so it all starts with the purpose heart a humble heart saying Lord I'm getting the evil things out so that you can reveal the secrets so you can reveal the secrets and perform exploits the only way I'm going to know God is to understand God the understanding of God has been poured out and he says brother brandom says now he has CED out in this last stage you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing it hacking it into pieces taking what you want leaving out what you don't want you are not interested in living it he's talking about the church World they've got the word but they're just dividing it they're just fighting with it the only thing the message is to many people is an argument but nobody's willing to love that nobody's interested in living it oh my God don't wants people that have had knowledge he wants somebody that's living it come on now he don't want somebody that can go through all the seals go through all the all of the the the adoption series and can quote it and quote it and quote it but not willing to live it I say Lord let me learn it and live it not just a head knowledge but let me live it let me purpose in my heart to take what I'm learning and put it into action oh Hallelujah but once Daniel purposed his heart it started through his flesh God Favored here and brother brandom says and today friend the only way we can ever have favor with God God is rich in Mercy today but we've got to respect what he said about it you just can't take what somebody else said you've got to take what God Said let every man's word be a lie and mine true we've got to respect what he said about it amen I know I've slowed down a little bit at this at this end here but just bear with me we got to respect what God says about it because it's the favor that can bring exploits it's only the favor of God that can bring exploits it's the favor of God that that has brought you this far it was the favor of God that brought life of God through Mary you look at Luke 1 and 128 and the angel come unto her and said hell thou are Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women you're highly favored a message come to Mary saying you're favored there's many virgins there's many women but you're blessed God has chose to give you his favor and what happened what does she said be it unto me according to Thy word she was favored but she still had a purpose in her heart oh my we're favored people on Earth today not anybody had a prophet not anybody had a message but God come to you and says you're favored if you're willing the purpose in your heart you look at Genesis 29 and 17 Leo was tendered eyed but Rachel was beautiful and well favored say Rachel was the one Jacob chose he expressed his favor to Rachel yeah and you know what that just that just that just that that really spoke to my heart Rachel couldn't have any children for a long time I believe Leah could but since she was chosen she was still favorite oh my you might look and say well that one's smarter I'm not smart I don't got an education I'm a nobody I don't got money I don't got a nice house I don't got nice cars but you're favorite God chose you by Grace God chose you by election and put his favor upon you but you see the bride hasn't got favor just to Puff you up but the favor of God is to fulfill the purpose Romans 9:11 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have loved but Esau have I hated the children not yet being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand amen because of election he favored Jacob oh my because of election he's favored you not to Puff you up so that the purpose can be fulfilled you see election is a powerful thing if you're included in the purpose of God you've got the favor of God in your life have you ever wondered haha why you're not in a premature grave it's the purpose of God the favor of God have you ever wondered why you're not in an insane institution it's the favor of God have you ever wondered why you guys in an addiction still it's the favor of God have you ever wondered why you come out of broken homes and your marriages together still it's the favor of God don't ever take that for granted the favor of God is fulfilling the purpose yeah but you see could you imagine being the woman of the well she wasn't the only prostitute Ju Just just think about this for a second I was think I was pondering on this last night the woman at the well wasn't the only prostitute I'm sure she wasn't the only one that was wrecking homes but she was the only one that was favored and Jesus would say I have means to go by Samaria that favor in her heart brought Christ to her well she wasn't even allowed to be with the rest of the woman she wasn't even allowed to be with the man because of her past she wasn't the only one with the past but she was favored oh little church you might have a past that that is a mile long you might have scars you might have hurts you might you might have things you're not proud of but you're favored you're not the only one brother Joe that was in drugs sister Stephanie that was in addictions but you was favored and since you were favored God sent his grace oh Hallelujah since we're favored in this generation he didn't go and meet that the smarts but he come to the ones that he favored and it always amazes me that the Bible says that after that that that Jesus spoke to the woman at the well the Bible says in in John 4:28 then the woman left her water pot and ran into the City and saith unto the men have you ever thought about that she ran to the people that she wasn't even supposed to be with she was an outcast she was a leop to the men she was a woman of ill Fame and so anytime you see her coming you're around the opposite direction but those are the ones she ran to right and you know what's so incredible about it the men listen to her amen could you imagine that the men of the city that was shuning her is now listening to a prostitute because the Bible says she ran to the men of the sea men of the city saying come see a man that has told me all that I ever done and the Bible says and they went and Found Jesus all right what was it it was exploits these men seen a change they looked and says my this ain't the same woman that we were shunning come on oh Hallelujah this ain't the same woman that was a prostitute this ain't the same woman that has five husbands there's something happening in her life she met God the favor of God led her to the reality of God which changed her life and produced in her flesh exploits that the men of the city said man but brother brandom says the men of the city believed on Jesus because the report of the woman my goodness they wasn't even allowed to be around her but the exploits was so convincing and oh my let the exploits in my flesh be so convincing to the world that they see a change that's not Joe that stole cars that's not Joe that done this there's something different about him this ain't William that used to cuss that used to dance that ain't the same William there's exploits that ain't the same Mike King that ain't the same sister Carol that ain't the same John tance there's something different what happened there's exploits somebody's coming contact with their God they've come face to face and it changed in their flesh into exploits oh Hallelujah let my flesh be exploits bless the Lord bless the Lord John 4:29 come see a man which had told me all the things that that I ever done is this not the Christ then they went out into the City and came unto him they realized something took place look up the man that set at the pool of Bethesda brother the brandom says there was worse cases than this man but random says he wasn't lame he could walk he could move around he was just weary and the Bible says the lame was there the Hal was there the death was there the Dome was there all of these other people were there but the favor of God was with this individual and could you imagine Jesus walking by a leper walking by a crippled person walking by a a blind person to come to a man that could walk what made the difference the favor of God oh my hope hope you're listening to me this morning maybe there's a lot better people that God could have chose but he chose you maybe there's a lot more people he could have showed his compassion too but he chose you and brother brandham says a man full of compassion passed by all of them but he says many people think compassion is human sympathy but he says it ain't human sympathy compassion is the will of the father oh the will of a father come to a man with favor and produced exploits oh that's why this message has come to you cuz he needed the people the will of the father and the favor of God brought you together oh Hallelujah brought a message in this generation so that there can be favor to understand what God is doing in this generation give me a few more minutes and I'll bring this down to a close but the favor of God has brought us something in this generation but you have to realize that's your favorite you got to realize if you never realize your fav you're never going to make this message yours you see without making this message yours you're never going to realize your identity of it you see I I heard a story I think Grandpa told a story before actually he says there was a man typ rope tight roping across nagar Falls I'm sure many of us heard the story and he said and he asked the people do you think I can walk across Niger Falls and they said oh yes you can do it he walks across and comes back he says you think I can take this wheelbarrow across the Rope they said yes sir you can do it he grabbed the wheelbarrow took it across brought it back and I and I and I googled to see if it was true and it was and they said he grabbed the stove he grabbed the stove and was cooking eggs while walking across that rope and then he grabs the W barrel and ask the people do y'all think I can take an individual a person in this wh Barrel across this roping back they all said yes sir he says okay get in and they all stopped and said oh I don't know about that brother brandom talks about a pastor and he says a pastor got his congregation together and says you think I can pick up this log they says yes sir you can do it the Lord's with you he picks up the log carries it he grabs it's the same star grabs the wol barrel says you think iin can to push it they said yes sir the Lord's with you you can do it he pushes the wheelbarrow and he says you think I can I can uh take put a person in this wheelbarrow they says yes sir and they said get in but the brandom says it's different when you're included in it yourself oh it's different when you're included in it yourself he says see That's mighty good for us here to say Amen It's mighty good for us to say I believe that's true but then put it into action you've got to put it into action so this message is a personal message not that one's message my message but without identifying it for yourself you're never going to get in the wool Barrel you're never going to get in the message for yourself and make it your absolute come on now if you can't make it your absolute you haven't seen it you haven't identified it as Christ yet but what you identified as Christ it becomes your absolute and you're jumping in it you're jumping in the world Bill s Lord take me wherever this message is going I'm going with it wherever this message leads me it's guiding me where I'm if it's a Rapture I'm going with it if it's through the valley of the shadow of death I'm going with it I've identified it as God in this generation oh my I've I've identified it because this message has brought our identity to us brother brand said no I've only thought I've thought of why don't the people come and listen and why don't they come and accept it but of course I know I know that you said they wouldn't they so they won't he's praying a prayer I know you said he he's praying to the Lord that you you said they wouldn't so they won't but there were some that's got their names written on the Lamb's Book of Life and when the seals are thrown open there they see their name and the Holy Ghost speaks to them they come oh my can you testify of that that when these seals were loose and you seen the message something spoke your name and they say my that's my identity as the musician has come this morning that's my identity the identity that you had before the fall is what this message has restored I know if I've talked about Lazarus many times but you ever thought about Lazarus before he was ever in the Tomb he had a house before he was ever in the Tomb he had he had money before he was ever in the Tomb he had sisters but once he went in the Tomb he lost all that he lost his identity it was no longer his but then the Bible says Christ went to the tomb and cried with a loud voice a loud voice of the voice of Resurrection a voice a message brought back his identity and you know if you read that if you read the scripture the Bible says they kept calling him dead they said the the the brother that was with the Dead the one that was with the dead remove the remove the stone that was covering the dead his identity was dead but before the dead identity he had an identity but he just needed the voice to restore that identity amen oh Hallelujah and before the foundation of the world in the mind of God your identity was the people your identity was the bride of Christ your identity was a people with exploits but you needed a voice oh Hallelujah you needed the voice to bring back your identity you wasn't a blasphemer you were the bride of Christ you wasn't a liar you're the bride of Christ oh you're not an adulterer you're the bride of Christ you're not an addict you're the Bride of Christ but we needed a voice to bring back our identity that we can stand and say that's mine this word is mine and could you imagine Lazarus walking to his home he was in the grave 4 days I believe 4 days have passed here he goes walking into his home and there's somebody on his couch hey now you don't belong there they could say no you're dead this ain't yours no more oh no cuz I've got a deed yeah that deed I may have lost it while I was in this Fallen state but since the voice of Resurrection here's the deed the deed has the same identity that was before the fall is back to me get out of my house and I say let's make a declaration this morning no more justifying Spirits the identity of the bride of Christ has been restored the deed is your the spoken word is your the the exploits of faith is yours let's kick out every spirit let's recognize the devil in every action and overcome every spirit it's a criticalness it's out the door get off my couch gossip get off my couch pornography off my couch lukewarmness off my couch here's the deed the voice of the Resurrection spoke to my heart brought me back to life oh Hallelujah throwing it out huj I will restore sayith the Lord I will restore sayith the Lord rest what was in the mind of God bitterness wasn't there bitterness wasn't there lukewarmness wasn't there gossip wasn't there but I will restore before all of those things say Lord I'm humbling myself to you this morning I'm want to purpose in my heart like Daniel so that the favor of God can express exploits in my flesh can we bow our heads this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to be a unit vessel to you lord lord we want to be somebody that's humble Lord have a purposed heart surrendering to you so we're not defiled what the Kings meet Lord Lord maybe there's some in a Lazarus condition they've still got some squaders in their house but Lord the title deed has their name on it father Lord The Voice has brought them to life but they still got to kick some things out and Lord if there's things in my life help me kick them out father Lord may we not justify Lord Spirits father may we not justify at the expense of our children Spirits Lord the expense of our marriage spirits but God may we may we make a dedication we're not justifying but we're recognizing we're recognizing that I know God and the only way to do EXP loit says unclog the channels Lord may we unclog the channels this morning Father so that we can hear you speak Lord Lord we're in the bride's Revival Lord we're in the Awakening of the Bride Lord help us to unclog the channels in Jesus name amen go ahead and sing it brother kby maybe you've got some channels this morning that are clogged the voice of Resurrection is here remember Lazarus I I I know we've talked on this before remember Lazarus the voice of Resurrection called Lazarus out of the Tomb but he still had grave clothes on he still had identification from the tomb for the same voice that brought him back to life was the same voice that says loose him and let him go oh the same voice that has brought back your identity is the same voice that has commissioned a five-fold Ministry to preach the word with the same authority to loose you of the Grave clothes maybe you've got grave clothes on this morning but you want to get rid of the word of God has spoken this morning the spirit of God is here to unclog [Music] channels my heart [Music] God may I be like [Music] you take my my heart oh [Music] God make it ever [Music] true take my heart oh [Music] God

Powerhouse I want my marriage to be a Powerhouse I want my children to be a Powerhouse but it starts with parents and clogging channels starts with parents recognizing the spirits I'm justifying can't

your Hallelujah I think that was a very important message here this morning were favored not because of [Music] our own works or our our smarts were favored because we were in his mind and on his book before the world ever even began but what we do with this favor is is quite important how we respond to that favor is is quite important I think that if there's anything that we should want is is the blessings of the Lord upon us we want to be in his perfect will and if there's any time that we ever really need to really so search why why do things come so many times many times bitterness comes or lots of times we're trying to put a a a a a square Block in a round hole and you get angry at God get angry at everyone else you get well lots of times we just need to look Inward and say Lord where am I at what what where am I at cuz I if I'm in your will I I I'm content I want your blessings and so we want that kind of a heart saying Lord I want you to use me I want your gift to be so manifest through me and if there's anything that's hindering it help me amen and um I Sister Mary had had sent a had had posted a little a deal and I I think I put it on the on the on the church uh page the other day that said tonight this this was something that she had seen and she just passed it along but it says tonight during the message my 9-year-old son Jay come to the realization that the children who were not on the ark didn't make it he looked to me with a with such a sad questioning face all I could say was their parents didn't make sure that they were on the ark the weight of that statement is still Weighing on me of all things I could do for the kingdom of God nothing is more more important than making sure that my children find their way to a relationship with Jesus I as I read that I pondered on that myself because there was nothing more important nothing more important no family uh Heritage no no no family characteristics no nothing but the power of the Holy Spirit making sure that our children are filled with the Holy Ghost and I I just I just wrote a little text for my family and I thought as Josh was preaching this morning I thought I would go ahead and and and just read it to you and I had on here praying for my family today and you can be seated if you want to for a moment says this morning I read as I read sister Mary's post about all the kids who missed the safety of the Ark because the masas and daddies didn't feel the urgency of the hour and hence did not get them on the ark one of the most sobering facts that there is is that this family is not exip exempt from a supernatural enemy whose aim is to use pain and pl pleasure to make us blind stupid miserable unproductive in our purpose we know this enemy as the devil and Satan the deceiver of the whole world the accuser Revelations 129 the prince of this world John 12:31 the God of this evil Age 2 Corinthians 4:4 please family please listen to me the devil is real and he is our adversary who prows around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour first Peter 5 and 8 yet in the most appalling and unwitting witting band bondage the whole world willingly follows the prince of the power of the air the spirit that is now at work in the sons of Disobedience now Satan's subjects march obliviously to destruction and they are going to take as many as they can but it is so sad to see so many believers who are unwittingly marching to the same tune but listen family we know Satan's tactics and we must stand guard against him think about it every sin imaginable is at the reach of our fingers temptation is always with us and all around us 24 hours a day 7 days a week never before has the temptation of evil been so present as now it is with us in our bedrooms bathrooms cars jobs pray meetings church services devotions Bible studies in the form of phones yes computers phones and internet can be a tool of absolute destruction tens of thousands of marriages have been mutilated and destroyed by Spirits coming through that internet Untold numbers of CH of kids who are addicted to gaming and social media or also heavily addicted to pornography evil spirits attached itself to the child while innocently playing games these evil spirits are released and transmitted into the spirits of young boys and unwitting men and these days girls who see nothing wrong with gaming watching movies browsing internet sites they can handle it they're big boys yet the statistics show otherwise hundreds of thousands of adulteries rapes and murders have been indirect results of the internet these unscrupulous individuals have danced with the devil when alone behind closed doors of a bedroom bathroom vehicle and these Spirits took form in their hearts minds and bodies and they becomes ens snared and imprisoned by Satan that's why I think we need to really monitor the use of our phones and not let it be the go-to for everything in life phones in themselves are harmless communication through text and phone calls are harmless but remember the time spent on our phones take away from what is currently happening around us in our homes jobs and families think about all the needless information we are putting in our Spirits Minds through Facebook gaming YouTube videos other internet use guys we must be smart and understand Satan's strategy Satan is not dumb and neither are we I promise this is a tactic of the devil and there is no way to overcome with junks with junk in our spirits and and then I put the scripture there in 2 Corinthian or yeah second Corinthians 2:11 the NIV that we would not be outwitted by Satan for we are not ignorant of his designs as we as as we think about this stretch that we're on I think we need to really as families we need to really we need need to really consider this is our in in our lives because Satan wants to take this last generation and he also wants to clog up our Spirits as men and women and I know he can do it in a lot of different ways but most any anyone today that is fighting battles that is that are struggling with their prayer life life that are struggling with their devotions are people that are spending most most everything is because we are putting too much time right here on these devices used to we had family games we'd all sit together around a table we'd play checkers or skip but these days everyone's got their phone families don't matter [Music] and I would dare say that matters of fact I I have been told Brother Wendell there's there's some of the young kids kid kids that's on the internet at late at night 1 and 2:00 in the [Music] morning it's not of our business but the maybe we ought to tell you really what are we what what what are we what are we teaching these these youngans what's I [Music] say that it won't ever it's it's it it it's going to happen it does happen but it won't be because I haven't screamed out against it I've screamed out against that stuff for years my children my grandchildren you know whatever but it ain't going to be because I haven't put it out there I think we need to be very wise your children your grandchildren it ain't because I haven't put it out there as pastor as the Watchman on the wall I just hope you all don't take these kinds of things as brother Wendell's just o fogy this ain't no fogy this is a trick of the devil in this last day to keep your mind away from the power and when he hit that this morning on clogged up clogged up got bitterness you got and the reason why we're bitter and the reason why we're is because we're not fulfilling people that's not fulfilling the purpose that God put them here oh they they they wanted they want to do their own thing and they want and they want God to bless that but the thing is is is is there's you've got a specific purpose and you want that anointing of the Holy Spirit to flow and what happens is we stay so busy you've got to you've got to feed your families you've got to take care of your families I I understand that but I'm here to tell you Satan has has has pulled a big one on us with these phones and things and this internet and these gaming and I I I I I I would I I I'm I'm just saying there's an evil spirit that wants our young people to get to get get hung up where you got to check your phone every two minutes where you got to they he they they want us and you all know how that addiction happens I mean come on we all know how that [Music] happens I'd say guys if we found favor with the Lord and God's sending us a prophet to be able to see these [Music] things let's let's really take these things to Heart let's take these things to Heart we could never go without these again never it's just not going to happen we're we we're in a world that has to have the phone we're in a world for most of us adults have to have the internet even for jobs for things of that nature but I'm here to tell you I'd put the Holy Ghost right there on those on on on these things right here and and and while I'm thankful for the while I'm thankful for the the WhatsApp and things it's really nice for us to be able to communicate and I I I appreciate that so there are some really good things that can come out of it but guys don't let nothing come in between your walk with God and your relationship the husband and wife and your children and don't let nothing take the time of you sitting at a table and and eating together and playing games together and asking each other how your days doing and how things are going don't don't let nothing hinder your your time of Fellowship around the H having a little bit of of of prayer time together and can you say Amen let's let's let's not let Satan let's not let Satan take our purpose strong strong

your desire amen so I just wanted to bring that since we're here and I I I thought the message was beautiful this morning amen hallelujah oh [Music] my sin happens because we're not fulfilling our
