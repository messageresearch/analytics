I tell you that we you know the Bible says we're the carcass is where the Eagles are being this morning brother Josh brought it down cut it up sliced it in little bitty pieces so I could chew on it with my bad teeth I mean that was a good service amen I I truly truly enjoyed that and now I'm a bit nervous amen but praise the lord it's an honor to be in the house of God with you again it's a

here with my head held high in the glory of Jesus Christ I'm not going to take it weary I'm not going to take it not down I'm flying out here happy happy amen amen [Applause] amen let's open our Bibles to job 23 and 1 if you would I love that song it's like my most favorite song ever I'll Fly Away looking forward to that day get to feeling a little bit down I sing that song I get to feeling a little bit Earthbound and I sing that song I get to fill in a little bit of this and I sing that song and then I just get happy and guess what I sing that song Amen oh yes one of these days and it's coming every single day that we live brothers and sisters on this Earth we are one day closer to going home you know it it may not be in the morning and it may not be in the next morning but this much I know if I wake up in the morning and I'm still here I'm just one day closer to the next morning that I ain't here amen amen ah God has promised it I believe it and I'm going to take that Heavenly flight amen so job 23-1 then job answered and said even today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning all that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with argument and I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me and then in John chapter 20 started verse 11. amen and then so John 20 and 11 it said but Mary stood without at the septic or weeping and now she wept she stooped down and looked into the Sepulcher and seeth two angels in white setting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had laying and they say unto her woman why weep us thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him amen and I know not where they have laid him so here's two people in the Bible that just want to know where God is they just want answers to their questions they have fears they have trials they have torments and they just want to know where they can find him let's go to the Lord in prayer dear heavenly father Lord we come before you tonight so thankful for the great wonderful things you've given us already today Lord Lord my cup already overfloweth over into my saucer father you've you brought me so much today but Lord I ask you one more time to come move us out of the way and come down and speak to your people and open the ears of your people to hear what you have to say Lord because Lord we know anything that I say is worthless but if you'll say it it'll bring life for you are the life Lord so we ask you to do it we ask you to come as you promised in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen y'all can be seated if you like and be comfortable if I had a title today and uh I know I think I say this just about every time but titles and me usually don't get along because I end up changing them but today it actually stayed the same brother so if I had a title it'd be the Winds of Change uh brother Josh came in this morning and and he was preaching and my goodness if he didn't take my notes and just oh man alive did he he done a good job and I know it was God because there ain't no way I could have done that amen so we're going to Lord willing just piggyback right off of it and just keep right on going amen uh so forgive me if I if I jumble it up brother but I I really can't get over that this morning God really spoke to me and I probably saying too much but not really I enjoyed this morning amen but I like that God put this in the Bible because it proves that we're not the only ones that cry out for God we're not alone in our little age and I say little age because it really is just a speck brother Brandon said in the circle of life it's just a little speck our entire age isn't the size of a ball peen pin or a ball Point pin if you would I mean so we really are very little in this whole spectrum of life this this whole thing but the one thing that stays constant the one thing that makes us bigger than life itself is Jesus Christ amen and with him we're bigger than life with him we're Eternal beings amen amen so when you come in to this life as the brother was talking in the trials are coming and all the things are hidden and the pressures are on and life is on you're not the only one that thought you were alone you're not the only one that's ever searched for God amen job was in the midst of one of the biggest Trials of his life and he's like if I could just find him I'd ask him because I know I haven't done anything wrong I know and now you know what he could honestly say that because he had sacrificed the sacrifice to God his lamb was still on the altar job could stand there and look anybody in the eye and say I am blameless I am sinless because he done what God had him do the sacrifice was done so then he could come in and say well if I could find him the one that told me to kill the lamb the one that told me to do the sacrifice if I could find him he would come tell you I'm fine this is what he was saying he was telling them you guys have this all wrong I am standing on the word of God so if I could find him then I'm going to put all this in front of him and I'm going to say Lord why why did you do this to me and the Lord's going to Simply look at him and say because I wanted to he did he told Satan have you considered him already known in his mind what he was about to put job through he already knew what he was about to do and he still said have you considered my servant job so if job would have found him he'd looked him in the eye and said because I wanted to and because I could but the biggest reason is to prove I'm God hahaha well you say well how could that prove it well brother when you were talking about the him down there to talking to job and nobody else could hear him you know could you imagine what these guys were thinking oh my goodness he talks to God lip to ear l oh my goodness what have I done what oh no if he can speak to God I'm in trouble because he he's my friend he knows my whole life my whole life every time God comes he brings life and he brings death on the same wind he speaks the word one takes it and lives one rejects it and dies it's the same word it's the same God it's the same holy spirit it's the same it's really up to you you can be the one sitting there just ripping job apart or you can be the other one sitting there going now wait a second you guys don't know what you're talking about look at this guy this guy he said you're telling you there you have no proof and you're just ripping him up and down and shredding him which one would you be the Lord moves through the church brings about a a feeling of repentance on somebody they come running up to the Altar and they fall down on their knees and they're like God forgive me help me Lord I'm sorry and right there at that point they never done it Tennessean forgetfulness it's gone they never done it but are you going to be the one over here man can you believe they did that can you honestly figure this but that day was a Christian and they did that can you believe that oh man or are you going to be the one over here well praise the Lord hallelujah we got one more flying into the Gates of Heaven we got one more that made it home can you believe that the spirit of David repentance which side of this coin are you going to be on because it's the same word that went that brought the repentance is the same word if you're rejected brings death amen it's not up to us to judge oh praise the lord it's really not up to us to judge when we see that kind of stuff amen but I I really do like this and I titled this to win to change because I'm going to get somewhere with it I promise Lord willing we're going to go back to that eagle where brother Brandon was talking about that eagle and the little squirrel chirping and all that and the eagle was sitting there and he kept filling his wings that God gave him right and he kept feeling the wings and he kept ruffling those feathers and he kept feeling those wings and and I was like Lord why did that eagle just sit there and keep feeling it I mean I understand that he trusted what God gave him he trusted those wings he trusted all of that but why didn't he fly away before the squirrel started chattering why why didn't he do all of this well when you read a little bit farther brother Brandon said that he got under the storm and so the storm was pushing him down so the pressure that the brother was preaching about this morning was pushing him down and so the eagle come in and said well you know what I'm just going to slip up underneath this branch and I'm going to hide myself in here I'm going to get under this cleft of The Rock and I'm just going to hide right in here until I can feel my way out of here and then it hit me and I went dancing in fact I was actually driving my truck so I don't know if you've ever seen somebody Dance and drive at the same time it doesn't work really good so I thank the Lord for driving my truck for me because it dawned on me at this point he had faith in his wings he had everything he needed to get out of there but he was waiting on one thing when he would move those feathers he was waiting for the wind to change he was waiting for the atmosphere to change he was ruffling those feathers to see if it was going to push him down or if it was going to push him up flexes it out a little bit nope that's still downward I'm not getting in on that ain't getting in on anything that pushes me toward the Earth oh no no no that's an uncertain sound that really pushes you down nope don't like that one ooh looky there two flaps and he just shed his wings in faith and was gone why the winds have changed the storm was no longer pushing him toward the ground the storm was taking him out foreign the same wind that pushed him down was the same exact wind that took him out the brother preached it so well the trials that comes comes from God where are you going to find him in your trial that's what job was missing when he was asking if I knew where he was if I knew where he was he was there the whole time heard the whole conversation so when he comes in on that wind I've got scripture for it let's read some of it Psalms 107 will start at 21. I I it really did I got home from work I was jumping and shouting and hollering up to think April thought something was wrong with me Psalms 107 and 21. oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing they that go down to the Sea and ships that do business in Great Waters these see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the Deep for he commandeth and raised it the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wit's end then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses he maketh the storm of calm so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired Haven he brought the storm waited for him to ask and then took it away and got all the glory but he brings the storm but then the going and going and going and as soon as you cry out to God he just changes the wind so let's go to another scripture let's go to second Samuel 22 and that's kind of a long one but I'm going to go ahead and read the whole thing anyway we'll start at verse 1. who they really like I said it really struck me and I'm excited so if I jump all over the place forgive me but we really are not Earthbound creatures we're really not if we if brother random said that we can speak and change our atmosphere we can we can do all this stuff why can't we change our own win and get off this Earth well we're supposed to be gathering in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus right he's only going to come down so far we heard brother Wendell he said it like two or three services now that God's not going to step foot on this Earth yet it's not time oh yeah he's appeared his spirit is here but himself right we know the only way we're going to do it is to meet him but we don't have to wait until the day that we fly out of here to meet him we don't have to wait to be in Heavenly places you are not an earth-bound creature get ahead of myself that's that's a love giving the punchline first so II Samuel 22 and 1 and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of his enemies and out of the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock and him will I trust he is my shield in the Horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge My Savior thou savest me from violence I will call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from mine enemies when the waves of death Compass me the floods of ungodly men made me afraid the Sorrows of Hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress I called upon the Lord and cried to my God and he did hear my voice out of his Temple and My Cry did enter into his ears then then the Earth Shook and trembled the foundations of Heaven moved and shook because he was Roth you ever wonder when you pray pray to God it seems like everything gets worse you say a prayer and you're like Lord I need you I'm in trouble and everything falls apart you know you're praying for one vehicle and everything in the house goes out finally get the vehicle fixed get the house fix the truck breaks down truck breaks down you're like well I ain't got the money to fix it so I'm just going to let it wait well you should have fixed it because now you're going to spend the money on the washing machine because it's going to go out and then why the Earth shook the foundations of the heaven shook why because you prayed to God and he moved oh that's scriptural too when he came down to the children of Israel and he was on the mountain there was earthquakes and there was smoke and there was fire so much so the people were scared to death to approach the mountain just because we think our life is falling apart doesn't mean it is just because we think we're stuck doesn't mean we are you prayed the prayer of a righteous man or woman God is obligated to do something because he wrote it in his scriptures the prayer of a righteous man of baileth much so as soon as you pray the prayer God has to move now it doesn't mean he's going to show up at your doorstep right now it may be 25 years later but that's okay because he started moving the minute you prayed then the Earth Shook and trembled the foundation of the heaven moved and shook because he was Roth there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and a fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also or maybe booed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet and he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen on the wings of the Wind the same wind that brought the storm he was riding it the same wind that takes the storm out he was riding it oh brothers and sisters don't you see he gives Satan the okay he says I tell you what Satan's like I got him this time I could take them same thing he said about job you let me do this I'll take him he's like I got him I'm telling you Lord right now if you'll just let me do it I got him Lord says okay go ahead Satan immediately well let's just take the the disciples out in the boat right oh he's like go for it it's all right I'm up in the mountain praying you do whatever you want down there well that well Satan can't create right so he just takes what's already there and he gets the wind and he gets the whipping that wind around and whipping that wind around and whipping he's like I got him now and the Sea starts rolling and everything going and all of a sudden you look out there and there's Jesus standing out there why because he was on the same wind that he gave Satan permission to use he wrote it in to save you the same wind that Satan got permission to start the trial to start the trouble to bring the storm is the exact same wind that reports to God there's only four winds The North Wind the south wind the East Wind and the West Wind and he controls all four well yeah because the Bible said nope you go back to your places it's not time for you yet because when they actually come out of their Corners it's going to bring tribulations on the Earth and it's not quite time yet but doesn't mean that Satan can't stir up the pot says all right use a little bit of it just give Satan like a a nostril full of it there and let him really think he's something big and Satan grabs the halt of that wind and he's like I got him now and here he goes and God's standing right behind him he don't even realize it he's so bound and determined he's got you he don't even realize that God is riding the same exact wind right behind him Satan comes in for the kill here he comes he's like I got him I got him I got him and as he sweeps by he hits them with cancer whoo immediately oh no oh no God's like huh and Satan takes and heads back to his hole I got him now you wait and see next time I see the Lord I got him God is still on that wind he just simply turns it back around and he waits and he's sitting there and he waits he's on with his cherubs on the wind and he's waiting and all of a sudden he hears it oh God the doctor told me and I don't believe him because your word said you healed all of my diseases It's Already Done Lord there's no way I can have this cancer because you already said you healed me from it so and what does God do turns that same exact wind back around heads it right back the opposite direction and on his way through grabs the cancer on his way up all right he brings the storm he takes the storm nothing absolutely nothing can take you from the love of God Paul said it he said I am persuaded or whichever word did he use that nothing and he went through a list not this not this not this not this none of this none of this none of this can take you away from the love of God nothing absolutely nothing so why are we still stuck on the ground well you say brother we're here we got to rub shoulders with this we got it in oh yeah I agree with that I really do we are here we're here for a purpose and when our purpose known God takes us home and I get that we have the faith that God gave us but he also sends back anointings to run that faith okay he doesn't leave you alone he said I'll send it back so I think the first one was a lion I may have the first two mixed up but I think the first one he sent back the lion anointing and then it was the ox anointing and under that one the people actually went to their own Slaughter with a glow of Love on their face so great that brother Branham actually said that they couldn't have that that's why they ended it all was because they were coming into their desk with their faces Shining and they're like well we can't have this where's your shine you're like well it was it was you know it was anointing of the time right oh I get that uh I get it but isn't the same love of God it's the same everything different annoying but still the same God if you love him as much as they did where's our Holy Ghost shine why can't people look at us and see the difference why can't people take one look at you brother Merle and go wow he's going they can you brother I'm just using you for an example all right so but hey and it does work because when you testify to somebody they know if you have it or you don't and you cannot testify something you haven't lived you can try all day long it ain't gonna work but if you've lived through it and God's brought you out the other side of it when you speak to people it works and that's why you went through it because God knew you'd come out on the other side so that you could reach back and grab your brother and pull them through the other side so he brings the ox and they all go left and right dying happy smiles just a glowing happy as they can be laying their heads on The Chopping Block I I wonder how many of those executioners got saved knowing good well when that they put their head down there on that block for that ax to fall down the glow that came off that body and the Praises that they were singing and asking God to forgive them and all of the humility and all of the love I wonder how many of those guys ran just dropped it and said not me I ain't doing it doesn't say but I bet there was a bunch of them because I tell you what if I come up on a Christian like that and I saw that glow of the heavenly father I couldn't have swung that thing they couldn't have paid me enough money they said well I'm going to kill you well you better make it faster I'm going to get over that wall you know it's pretty simple I'm pretty fast when I want to be you know I may not had to be able to do like they did and just put it there but I wouldn't well they glowed with their anointing then the next one was the man anointing all the reform right everybody's so smart everybody's intellect they're building Bibles they're coming out of the the uh Dark Ages you know and now the scriptures are coming to the people and everybody's so smart and everybody's so smart and everybody's so smart that they really ain't no good you know I heard a guy say one time you know they're so Heavenly minded they ain't no earthly good I was like well praise the Lord why ain't we Heavenly minded so much we ain't no earthly good because that Earth out there ain't mine oh the ground underneath it's mine but that out there Satan's eating I don't want nothing to do with that God let me be so Heavenly minded I ain't no earthly good because if I'm Heavenly minded I'll pull my brothers up the next one that comes into the eagle anointing oh there's the wind under his wings he was waiting for the change the changes come the other three were Earth Brown creatures the Eagle's not an Earthbound creature brother Wendell preaching about the word that anchored that anchor that's holding you well that anchor ain't on this Earth that anchor that's holding you is in the heavens that anchor that's holding you is a Celestial thing that word that's holding you don't belong down here so when that anchor is pulling you back out of the storm where is that anchor pulling you it's pulling you back to Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the storms come and they push you down but the anchor pulls you back I love it but the Heavenly places why because we are not earth-bound creatures the anointing isn't even an Earthbound anointing the seventh angel comes the Mysteries are all revealed we have the open book we have everything that we need to do anything that we need to have anything that we need why brothers and sisters why why why do we get so tied to this Earth so bad that we walk around like gravity itself is killing us why our faces droop down we get tired we frown we don't smile we ain't got no joy which makes no sense to me none because the physics and the laws of this Earth do not never have and never will pertain to you gravity can't pull you down when the anchor is pulling you up depression can't pull you down when Joy's pulling you up the winds have changed the pressure is no longer pushing down the pressures of life as they push on you and they press on you and they hurt and you fight they're pushing you up we're never going to make it through this thing without the love of Jesus Christ we've got to get to the top of this pyramid or it ain't happening you can go through it on the ground or you can go through it flying knowing that the same wind you're in he's already riding he controls it he takes care of it he moves it he tells it when to go he tells it when to stop he tells it everything well brother what happens if I fall out of the Wind you came fall out of the wind the whole entire atmosphere is the wind you know the only you know what causes wind besides God controlling it the atmosphere changes high pressure low pressure heat cold heat cold lukewarm you want to change your atmosphere you want to change where you're at get hot get in the word get to reading get this shouting get the jumping get that dancing you want to see your atmosphere move go cold and you'll kill an entire church you dance you skip you be joyful you walk around you come around and then this one rubs and then this one erupts and then this one erupts and next thing you know you've got licks of fire over the entire church we are not bound to this earth we are Heavenly Creatures we live and we survive in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this world does not control you you control this world you have the Dominion it was given to you before the foundation of the world take what's rightfully yours and you can because God's in it that's Satan's end stay out of it Samson stay out of it because if you don't you'll end up in prison but if you'll grab a halt to the wing of the great Jehovah he said I'm the eagle and you're my eaglets take your beat and grab a hold of that wing fly up out of here one time get a little bit of warmth going on get a little bit of spirit moving just once I beg you it'll change your life it will absolutely change your day to day life it not only will it heal your body it'll heal your mind it'll heal your spirit it'll heal your soul it'll heal your job it'll even heal that busy body you have to work next to every day of your life hey John as good as truth I had to go to work with a guy Lord help him Lord bless him I tell you you want to talk about trials you know I used to think I was over my temper brother he pushed the limits a couple times finally I was like Lord I don't know what to do you either get me out of this or something bad it's about to happen because God I honestly don't know what to do all of a sudden he came in he said you know what I never knew he was a preacher that was like it's because you never listened to me but I didn't say that I was like oh yeah I am he's like well what do you preach look at him right now I said Jesus Christ he said oh yeah that's what everybody says I was like yeah but I do it and he's like really he's like yeah he said well what's the most important thing that you could think of if you're going to preach Jesus Christ and I looked him right now I said the most important thing he's like yes I said Jesus Christ and he looked at me he was like well no no no I was like no it is it really is I said because it was the alpha to the omegas the beginning to the end it's Jesus Christ from the start of the Old Testament to the end of the New Testament it's Jesus Christ every single step of it is Jesus Christ and that guy looked at me he goes so you're trying to tell me you're Jesus Christ I said you're absolutely right and he looked at me he said well okay then I'm sorry he said I won't cuss no more he said I won't do that stuff no more he said I'll respect what you believe I won't understand it but I respect what you believe see how simple that was but it wasn't me that God did it and now when I run into him everybody's amazed they're like wow he can actually say a whole sentence you know because before it was like every other word was something horrible bad he'd talk about anything including my mom and that just don't settle well with me you know what I mean and I know he was joking just a rough crude guy I'm not trying to tear him down my point is God changed it God was there listening the whole time I was he was there listening to the same wind hot air if you will that the guy was spilling out okay he was there listening to but you know what God wanted what he really really wanted he wanted me to ask forgiveness for getting mad at him he wasn't so much worried about what he was doing that's between him and God but he was sitting there waiting for me to say Lord I'm sorry I'm losing my mind I need you to do something because the more I tried to do it myself the worse it got the more I tried to bring up stuff the words it got remember it takes God to do anything and it takes God to do everything when we can come to the realization that we're above it we're not above people we're not we're not better let me rephrase that we're not better than people but we are above anything in this world because the Bible says that he would put Satan under his feet and if we're the body of Jesus Christ and Satan is under our feet so this is Satan's Eden so we are literally above anything in this world payment and the whole reason I brought that out was my own attitude but when I changed that when I wanted a change of the atmosphere and I went to God I saw him coming in on the wings of the Wind I saw him coming in as my deliverer I saw him Lifting Me Up Above and then I find it in the scripture and I'm like praise the Lord I wasn't just seeing things I really saw God coming down on the Wind to pull me out of this situation for every single biblical question that you have there's a Biblical answer so if you want an answer to a situation God will give it to you from the first time I prayed that prayer to the time that everything actually went through good was a year and two months a year and two months I'm not very good at holding my tongue okay I'm really not I anyway but God helped me he really did and then I saw it Bar None hands down when he came through and I saw it and I looked up I promise you in my mind I saw him standing there on the Wind laughing because I was like Lord why because I could because I wanted to because I wanted to prove you'd keep your mouth shut because I wanted to prove you'd keep your temper I wanted to prove I had taken the anger away from you I wanted to prove to you that you're not the same guy you was 20 years ago even when in the back of your mind you're saying well Lord maybe just maybe I haven't been completely saved well Lord maybe just maybe I haven't because Lord I Lord I need help and he's over there going relax I've got this he's got this the winds have changed the winds of change has already come the prophet has preached the message the Mysteries are revealed he even said himself that he only saw that there was one thing left to do and that was the rapture brothers and sisters the winds have changed you're not an Earthbound creature you never have been an Earthbound creature you are a Heavenly creature you belong in the heavens the pressures of this life allow them to push you home you come from God you're going back to God you come from the heavens you're going back to the heavens and then yes we get to come back and rule the whole thing it's a win-win situation stop letting this Earth Hold You Down when your anchor keeps pulling you back the Earth pulls you down the anchors brings you back imagine a big bungee cord jumping off I never would do that saved my life anyway I've seen them do it jump off the bridges you know the big bungee cord they go down down the bungee cord stretches stretches stretches stretches stretches stretches and why they set them so close I don't know but it's almost like their head's almost going to hit the ground and then all of a sudden that bungee core Springs them right back again and I'm not even on the thing and I'm already losing my stomach you know that that kind of ride ain't for me but when I see that that's the way I picture my anchor when this Earth tries to pull me down and Satan tries to pull me to the same laws of physic as this Earth I know without a doubt my anchor will bring me back I don't know when I'm going to hit the end of that bungee cord I don't even know how I'm going to hit the end of that bungee cord but this much I can guarantee I may be falling a thousand miles an hour but eventually that cord's going to stop and when it does Satan let go or you're going back to heaven with me that simple because I'm not an Earthbound creature the winds have changed I'm a Heavenly creature I am the Son of God the bride to the Lord Jesus Christ gravity can't hold me sickness can't hold me nothing can hold me to this earth and I can say that none of those physics hold to me they have they pertain nothing to me because not a single one of those is making it into heaven sickness ain't making it into heaven brother diseases ain't making it into heaven lies ain't making it into heaven alcohol ain't licking it into heaven drug ain't making it in none of that stuff's making it to heaven so if it's not making it to heaven and I'm on my way to heaven it can't hold me here it can't hold me you can't grab me you can't do nothing with me because if it does them little demons getting saved because I'm going to heaven I'm a Heavenly creature and that's the truth so they cannot hold on to you they cannot keep you down they can't and they want because they belong here and under it because that's where God kicked them down to God said you're out of Heaven you're going to the Earth and he booted them and then started laughing and turned and looked at you brother Colby and said now will you go fight him and you looked over that banister and said Lord I'll do anything for you because you looked too and you saw you saw Christ you saw the picture you saw it all you don't remember it but you saw it and you said Lord that's an awesome plan Absolutely I'll go I did too I said Lord I'll fight I'll go well you know what it's going to cost you I don't care I'll go why because your honor and your glory means more to me than anything that you can put me through so if I can go down to laodicea and prove that your God send me that's Heavenly Creatures that's what you did before the foundation of the world where were you in the you were standing at the same banister he was looking out over the whole plan and he said will you go and you said absolutely I'll go and I'm telling you this because I want to bring it back to your remembrance because you realize then that you already won you realize then you couldn't be taken down you realize then that God's Redemptive plan was perfect absolutely perfect so you said I'll go and then we get here and boy oh boy it's a whole nother story ain't it well where's the joy you had there where's the joy you had at the beginning of your salvation we should be the happiest people That Ever Walked face this planet we should be so joyful and so happy that we can walk into Walmart of all places that I love to call the zoo we can walk into Walmart laughing and smiling and when we walk out half of that store should be saved or at least pretending it just to get us to shut up and I'm serious about that because where is it where's the globe where's the happy where's the testified the people of old testified all the way up to the chopping block they didn't stop Stephen brother out there they're Stones just to find just a hitting him and he looks up into the he didn't stop look I see Jesus on the right hand of God testified can you believe that stones so full of the Holy Spirit they didn't even feel it didn't even affect him didn't even bother him he crawled up in the building where God went to sleep so brother Brandon said right that's what he said so when people are throwing verbal stones at you and the people you're working with giving you four times as much work because you're actually going to get it done and they're lazy right and this one's hitting you and this one's hitting you and this Stone's hitting you and this Stone's hitting you look up your redemption's nigh can you see that he's coming in on the Wind look Christ is coming Heavenly Creatures we're not Earthly creatures yes we have to work yes we have to live here yes we have to be a part of it we have to do it but you don't have to act like it we don't have to act like everybody else we can actually be different because we are different if you truly are a son and daughter of God born into the body of Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ you are different plain and simple you're different it's okay to be different as long as you're heavenly doesn't mean dying here yeah okay we won't go there praise the Lord look up your Redemption tonight brother and sisters as the musicians come look up look up stop looking at what Satan's and look up at what's yours stop looking at what Satan's lying to you about and look to the truth of God I'll say it again this Earth doesn't pertain to you physics doesn't pertain to you oh brother yes it does then how did the Disciples of old transform one place to another just like that he's like hey I want you to go over here there he was you know they have movies about time machines and people doing all that you know there's nothing new Under the heaven where do you think they got it the Bible said that it was happened years ago people traveled through like nothing why because God said I need you here and they were there no no none of that's new he's just perverting it making you think it's not real so you watch the movies and you do all this stuff and it takes those little sensors in your mind that should be telling you God can do that and it's actually telling you oh that's just stuff's nonsense it's not nonsense if God needed you 20 years ago he's going to back you up and send you 20 years ago [Music] anything's possible we got to stop thinking like the world and start thinking like God put in you the mind of Christ and in that mind anything and all things are possible but we let the world dictate what we believe and what we don't believe we let the world say this is nonsense or it's not nonsense like the little story they said about letting an adult and a child draw a horse the adult goes away I can't draw no horse that child just goes to whipping in a drawing and pulls up and he's got this Big Blob look at my horse just a blob of colors on a piece of paper but it didn't matter that child drew a horse because nobody said she couldn't [Music] it's the same way with you you can go out to people and you can talk to them and bye to him and God can speak to you and through you and he can save people and he can heal people and he can do that but you have to believe you can the whole world says oh no no no no no no no no no you know that was that was from times past I was you know brother Branham you know he had a gift that was just you know that was him well you got the same gift oh no brother I'm not a prophet neither am I but he said he to the lay members of the church and I'll get the quote for you I have it at the house he said you can pray for the sick you can baptize people you can not just the ministers not just pastors or evangelists or missionaries you can't you can pray for the sick brother and guess what will happen to be healed the world says oh no no no no no no forget that and when I say the world you'd be surprised at how much of that comes right into our churches well it's just like anything else your upbringing the way you raise the things you learn the things you do you come together as a group of people the majority will outweigh the whatever okay so if you got half of the people coming in bringing in their upbringing bringing in their culture bringing in all this stuff and to them you know they were Baptists so healings and stuff was left back there guess what that's what's going to happen they believe it that way Oh They'll pray they'll say but deep down in their heart they're like well Lord help them and that ain't right when we pray for people we should believe it [Music] When you pray for someone you should really have in your heart that it's going to happen or why pray but you bring in someone like my grandma and she passed away many many years ago but I still remember not just like five or six years old when she passed away but I still remember because that little gal well maybe she wasn't so small but um I was little so I really can't tell but my grandma she would get up in church and that Spirit would hit and she would dance in the spirit up here not down here up here no screws holding no more abuse to the floor just wooden pews no pads on them no nothing no screws hold them to the floor and she danced up here why because nobody told her she couldn't so when the spirit moved and she felt like jumping up she jumped up gravity held nothing to her she danced on the back of a Pew and it never moved she would get in her kitchen cooking for Sunday meals and every single Sunday I mean there be people over family members not just church people we're talking into God family's huge so we're talking Mamie's house would be so full that she had an entire back porch that was nothing but a table and there would be people and for some odd reason she made all the men eat at the table and then the women and children had to wait and now they say that women talk a lot you get a table full of men together it's ours okay hours [Music] and I would be so hungry because I'm just a little bitty guy right but grandma was in there sneaking me bits of food as she's cooking and then all of a sudden she starts singing ah flowey and her feet gets to moving and she's just a cookie and she's in that kitchen and she's singing I ain't gonna die nope I'm not I'm Gonna Fly and boy making up her own word and she's in there just to singing and you know what you could hear I was five years old but you know what I could hear foreign [Music] those winds didn't just pick her up and Float around other nobody told her she couldn't find God in her kitchen nobody told her that she even though she's in there working herself her fingers to the Bone for all those guys out there cussing and smoking on her back porch no respect of course back then it was a little bit different anyway it was just normal but she's in there working away cooking none of the ladies helping her now maybe that was her own choice I don't know like I said I was young but she's in there cooking just to sing it change the whole ends I'd set up in there and I'd get other she had a big old huge teddy bear so right where her kitchen come out into the living room that big old huge teddy bear set like this so right on the edge of that kitchen I'd snuggle into that teddy bear and hide and she'd be in there just to singing in a cooking and she'd get something done and she'd hand it over that teddy bear and she'd get to cook and she'd hand it over that teddy bear in my mind I'm thinking why is she feeding the teddy bear well I'm Gonna Take It she was feeding me but I was five six years old beginning wonder if the teddy bear was real that was her just a singing and the dancing and God moving the whole time she wasn't in that kitchen she was in Heavenly places the spirit of God had lifted her so far up no wonder the food tasted so good no wonder Grandma's cooking was so good you want to know why Grandma's cooking was so good because the spirit cooked it while she was in the ovens hey she sure wasn't there paying no attention she was twirling around dancing singing all them old hymns he abides he abide and then she gets to dancing and she was elderly you know so she couldn't really do it a lot but the more she got into it the more she danced mom come around the corner my mom talking to my grandma come around the corner and say Mom we got people to feed yeah dear I'm cooking yo gone I'm not saying nothing bad about my mom she she'd do the same thing I'm just saying at that particular moment grandma was in Heavenly places my mom was worried about getting the men Fed so that she could get the women Fed so that they could get the children fed that's what my mom was worried about my grandma was worried about God you see the difference we are not earth-bound creatures and if you put God first the meal to get done because I don't remember not one time that there wasn't any food left for the last child d and there was a lot of us I mean a lot so much so that I'd be hanging out with the kids and I couldn't even tell you half of my cousin's names you know it's the truth but my favorite place snuggle up next to that teddy bear our grandma was singing because she Lifted Me into Heavenly places and now I want to say this and then I'm going to let you go things changed in my life things happen all of a sudden I end up I wake up after well too much stuff let me put it that way and I'm looking at 21 years in prison sitting on the floor wondering myself what in the world am I going to do what can I do I know Dad you know dad always told me if I ended up in here he's going to make me stay and he did for a little bit but then he helped me get out he made me sweat it though he really made me sweat it but anyways I'm in there thinking what in the world can I do in here I'm scared out of my mind I'm a what was a little bitty guy stood six foot tall weighed probably 130 pounds I mean I was little when April and I started dating I was 19 weighed what 140. we got married I only weighed 150. I mean I was a little bitty guy and I'm looking around me and these guys were huge I was scared but then I remembered Grandma I was like hmm I was like well Lord I don't know if this is going to work or not I don't know you haven't talked to you in years I was going through my head I thought Lord I know but right now if you don't come down in here I'm in some serious trouble foreign [Music] I could feel the same wind I could feel the same exact atmosphere coming in there and you know what's crazy I ain't the only one who felt it my buddy Chris that went in there with me like calling my boy yeah let's call him my buddy just leave that alone too he was in there too he kept doing this [Music] I was like man what's the matter with you he's like I don't know [Music] I don't know I feel weird I was like well I ain't stopping at any time oh I'll Fly Away doll you know been to church my whole life but for some reason I can only remember versus I'll Fly Away and hear about it never was real good with words I guess but I'm just laying in there in my mind I'm humming Lord what am I going to do I'm an adult now it ain't like this is childish stuff this ain't going on my record getting sealed I'm in trouble Lord I don't know where to go and I don't know what to do he buys he abides all of a sudden the biggest guy in the room comes over to me he says hi he gave me his name and I don't remember his name I laugh and they call him Bubba just because but he had an actual name but anyways he shook my hand he said nice to meet you so nice to meet you too he said well I'm out of here in a couple weeks he said her month or so he said he said so we're just going to stick together you and me I was like oh boy you know I was like this it's like well all right it's not like I'm big enough to say anything about it and you know what nobody there bothering me he didn't bother me just the fact that he was sitting next to me everybody else stayed away we'd come out to the table to eat and not have my meal in front of me they'd be knocking other people's meals off the table doing all sorts of stuff never one time did they touch mine [Music] that's God it wasn't him sitting next to me God put him next to me so when you look back on that you see God moving even when you ain't I wasn't serving God didn't even want to but I didn't make a promise to God and I made a promise to my dad I was like you get me out of here well I'll never go back that much I guarantee you get me out of here I'll never go back but then that wasn't even me that kept that promise well it couldn't have been me because because I'm a year out on supposed to be home and taking her out of the house don't do that it's not good the point being is I didn't keep myself from going up for 21 years God kept me from going up 21 years because I'm not Earthly bound and when I can look toward him and say God forgive me I no longer have a tie to this earth I am no longer a liar I was no longer born in sin shaped in iniquity when I can look and accept him as my savior and say Lord forgive me all ties to this Natural Earth disappeared so everything that you have need of you have and it's all heavenly so stop looking down and start looking up because we really ought to be so Heavenly minded we ain't a liquor Earthly good foreign I believe that with everything that's in me brothers and sisters look up your redemption's coming the rapture's here the whole end of this thing's coming [Music] I I personally don't want to be left for the foolish you know I want to be the one that woke up and trimmed my lamp and said Lord come quickly that's the one I want to be and that's the one we can be if we'll stop holding ourself to this earth the winds have changed the pressure in the trials are pushing you upward let it push you into the heavens let's stand [Music] I know that seemed maybe a little choppy and [Music] but when it started going through my head I'm telling you God drove that trope because there ain't no way I would drive it and you can ask my wife I come walking in the door of the house singing and a preaching I didn't even get two steps in the door and I had a whole congregation in there because I had them preaching away because it dawned on me I ain't of this world nothing that I have done pertains to me you realize that [Music] when you take the records of Heaven and you look through God's record and you flip through it he never even sees me in that cell [Music] so everything that I think I know really ain't true oh now brother I know you were there your mom told me she went and seen you there you're there no I prove it but you prove it by God's standards don't prove it by some Earthly thing prove to me I did it by God [Music] and now I'm not trying to be high Mighty because I'll never forget where I came from I know where God brought me from and I know where he's taking me and I will forever love him and be grateful for the things that he's done for me but I have got to stop letting that hold me here foreign because it's as though I never did it well how far is the how's that goal the city of God's forgetfulness you know how how big is it from as far as the East is from One Nail scarred hand to the other one and that is suspended in the heavens [Music] oh brothers and sisters I'm gonna let it go I hope you can understand the winds have changed the our anointing is no longer holding us down our anointing is lifting us above this world cars don't matter finances don't matter houses don't matter God will provide you everything you need everything praise the Lord what are we singing brother I'm I want to quit yeah [Music] [Music] I know the master of the way our gold of life [Music] I just love for me [Music] I know the master of the wind [Music] he can come storms side Sunshine again I know [Music] my soul can be found in unexpected sword may drive it may bring me low but never bring me down I know the master room [Music] behind us [Music] sometimes and in the sky above the Beats my soul can be found but in unexpected storm they drive me from the highs it may bring me low and it will never breathe I know the master of the ways I know the background he can come storms shine again I know [Music] you can take [Music] take the word of God watch yourself [Music] you can fly a higher place [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] little Moon but you will fly for you [Music] baby [Music] like it's true [Music] the skies [Music] it's already there already it's already done shine set your wings [Music] Grace [Music] amen set your wings to The Winds of faith and everything you have need of it's already in the sky ain't that the truth that's a powerful song right there amen everything that brings you the pressure everything that brings you the trial the same exact thing that takes you out of it we know because the camels that went took Elisa to pick up the bride I had the same camel I brought him back that's the way it is this holy spirit that God give us is a finished product it's not something that gets bigger or better it's finished look up your Redemption is nine what song are we going to sing as we dismiss brother [Music] rise rise right right [Music] above it all [Music] right rise above it all right [Music] Rise Above It All I'm gonna spread my wings will rise above it all I'm going
