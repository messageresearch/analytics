[1:11:48] so this evening i want to begin by for
[1:11:51] my brother reuben's sake
[1:11:53] i want to
[1:11:54] give him the title
[1:11:56] of the message tonight for brother
[1:11:58] reuben and the title of the service
[1:12:00] would be thoughts
[1:12:02] i think toward you
[1:12:06] thoughts i think toward you i want to
[1:12:08] talk tonight
[1:12:10] to a special group of people
[1:12:13] i was telling the church back home i'm
[1:12:15] getting too old i'm getting too grumpy
[1:12:18] getting too grouchy to be playing games
[1:12:22] we're not playing church come on church
[1:12:24] we're not playing church we're not here
[1:12:26] just to be seen or to be heard but we're
[1:12:28] here to praise our god
[1:12:31] and if we can't praise our god then we
[1:12:33] better go home
[1:12:35] because i'm here to praise my god
[1:12:37] tonight
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:43] now we
[1:12:45] want to begin i want to just read you
[1:12:47] something tonight and maybe a few things
[1:12:49] but
[1:12:50] brother branham says this in one of the
[1:12:52] messages he says god he said
[1:12:54] does things kind of strange
[1:12:58] how many has ever thought about that and
[1:13:01] said yeah he does things kind of strange
[1:13:04] he does things different than what i
[1:13:06] would have done it or maybe the way that
[1:13:08] we thought it should have been done god
[1:13:10] does things different
[1:13:12] and so the prophet of god came back and
[1:13:14] he said god does things strange and odd
[1:13:19] he does think strange and odd and he
[1:13:21] works in peculiar ways
[1:13:24] his wonders to perform
[1:13:27] and so we look at that tonight and we
[1:13:29] say wow how strange and how odd and how
[1:13:32] peculiar that god would literally allow
[1:13:36] his enemy satan to go ahead and choose
[1:13:40] the battleground
[1:13:42] he allowed him he said come on you're my
[1:13:44] enemy and i will allow you to to choose
[1:13:47] where we're going to have this fight
[1:13:51] and we find out that satan went ahead
[1:13:54] and we we know here tonight i know
[1:13:56] you're well taught that saiyan went
[1:13:58] ahead and he chose man's head
[1:14:02] and when brother branham talks about he
[1:14:04] says he chose man's head by the
[1:14:06] intellectual
[1:14:09] and so we have to look at that tonight
[1:14:11] and say well why would satan choose that
[1:14:14] why would satan say oh i have the rights
[1:14:16] to take the battleground and i'm going
[1:14:18] to take the battle here to your mind and
[1:14:21] your mind and your mind that's where
[1:14:24] he's going to place the battle
[1:14:26] and the reason that he chose that place
[1:14:28] that satan chose your mind is because he
[1:14:31] knew that he had access
[1:14:35] he knew that he could access certain
[1:14:37] things he knew that he could access your
[1:14:39] imagination
[1:14:41] he knew that he could get in there and
[1:14:43] they conjure up and you'd be imagining
[1:14:46] things
[1:14:46] he knew that he could access your
[1:14:49] conscience
[1:14:51] he knew that he could access your memory
[1:14:55] he knew he could access your affections
[1:14:58] and the way that you see and the way
[1:15:00] that you're here and the way that you
[1:15:01] smell he knew he had access to these
[1:15:04] things
[1:15:06] and we know that all those things are
[1:15:08] valuable to us
[1:15:10] if you've ever not been able to see your
[1:15:12] eyesight's very valuable to you or your
[1:15:15] smell or or these things or touch all
[1:15:18] these things are very valuable to the
[1:15:20] human being
[1:15:22] now we look at that and we can say we
[1:15:24] can all agree with that and say amen
[1:15:27] now these things are all right the
[1:15:28] prophet of god said as long as they
[1:15:31] agree with the word
[1:15:34] so your eyesight's good as long as it
[1:15:36] agrees with the word
[1:15:38] your smell is good it's long your
[1:15:40] imagination's good as long as it agrees
[1:15:42] with the word your worship's good as
[1:15:45] long as it agrees with the word
[1:15:54] now we want to watch this tonight so he
[1:15:57] knew that he could have access to these
[1:15:59] certain avenues and he took advantage of
[1:16:02] it
[1:16:03] but i want to tell you tonight he does
[1:16:06] not have access to the mind of god
[1:16:10] he has access to man's mind
[1:16:13] he can get in there by the intellectuals
[1:16:16] but he does not have access to the mind
[1:16:18] of god but i'm talking to a special
[1:16:22] group of people tonight
[1:16:24] that they have an all-access pass
[1:16:27] where
[1:16:28] to the mind of god
[1:16:31] journey to the center of the mind of god
[1:16:36] satan does not have access to that the
[1:16:39] angels do not have access
[1:16:42] but sons and daughters have access where
[1:16:47] to the very mind of god
[1:16:50] [Applause]
[1:16:54] why why are you saying that brother man
[1:16:55] because i want to tell you you're a
[1:16:57] special people
[1:17:01] you're a chosen people
[1:17:04] you're a peculiar people
[1:17:06] you're an odd people
[1:17:10] we don't have phds in lld's and double
[1:17:14] lds we have odds
[1:17:19] o d d
[1:17:21] our people
[1:17:23] to kill all your people
[1:17:25] come on church
[1:17:27] if we ever decided who was going to
[1:17:29] preach to us would we choose these men
[1:17:36] don't tell them about my preacher
[1:17:38] brother manuel
[1:17:42] i'm not i'm just saying well you know if
[1:17:44] it was my pick
[1:17:51] especially to this guy right here
[1:17:54] would have never picked him
[1:17:56] would have never chosen him but god did
[1:18:00] and that's how that matters
[1:18:05] notice when we we look to this and we
[1:18:07] see brother branham in the message
[1:18:09] called god's power to transform
[1:18:13] brother brahman said since the opening
[1:18:14] of those seven seals
[1:18:17] and them angels just behind the mountain
[1:18:19] yonder this has become a new book
[1:18:23] somebody said a new book it's the things
[1:18:26] that's been heard somebody say hid
[1:18:29] is being revealed as god promised in
[1:18:32] revelation 10.
[1:18:35] he would do it notice this he says and
[1:18:38] we are the privileged people
[1:18:42] that god has chosen
[1:18:45] so tonight i'm talking to a special
[1:18:48] breed of people here tonight that god
[1:18:51] has chosen
[1:18:53] he has elected
[1:18:55] he has
[1:18:56] pre-destinated you
[1:18:58] you're not here tonight
[1:19:00] by mistake
[1:19:02] you're not here by some kind of chance
[1:19:06] do you realize all the things that have
[1:19:08] to transpire just for you to be here
[1:19:10] tonight
[1:19:11] you're here for a reason
[1:19:13] and the reason is that god called you
[1:19:16] here tonight
[1:19:17] god told you to worship him here tonight
[1:19:20] it's not some kind of chance
[1:19:23] i said oh i think i'm just going to
[1:19:25] stroll in and kind of look to see how
[1:19:27] things are going that's not the way it
[1:19:28] works
[1:19:30] god's in control
[1:19:35] notice this he says and we are the
[1:19:37] privileged people
[1:19:44] so just coming from new mexico i just
[1:19:45] said i don't just come and say well it's
[1:19:47] brown privilege
[1:19:57] you know what's coming next
[1:20:00] and i'm just going to say this white
[1:20:02] privilege
[1:20:04] or i'm not just saying it's red
[1:20:07] privilege
[1:20:08] or black privilege
[1:20:10] we are the privileged people who
[1:20:13] christians
[1:20:15] [Applause]
[1:20:16] directions privilege tonight
[1:20:20] your privilege amongst everything about
[1:20:23] all the people
[1:20:30] notice the word privileged
[1:20:33] privilege means special rights
[1:20:38] privilege means advantages
[1:20:42] privileged means or immunities
[1:20:46] so tonight i'm talking about christian
[1:20:48] privilege
[1:20:55] now we looked and we see that god does
[1:20:57] things kind of strange and odd and
[1:21:00] brother batman said he works in peculiar
[1:21:02] ways
[1:21:03] when we look at the word peculiar it
[1:21:05] means a purchased possession
[1:21:10] peculiar means a people
[1:21:12] selected by god for his own possession
[1:21:19] but it could also mean unique
[1:21:23] it could also mean special
[1:21:26] peculiar can mean out of the ordinary
[1:21:30] now brother madam takes that word
[1:21:32] peculiar and if you search it through
[1:21:34] the message over 230 sometimes brother
[1:21:37] brahma uses the word peculiar
[1:21:40] he goes and even to his own birth
[1:21:43] he says my birth my my birth was a
[1:21:45] peculiar birth
[1:21:47] and he goes on he said well moses's
[1:21:49] birth was a peculiar birth
[1:21:51] and then he would take it a little
[1:21:52] further what about your birth and your
[1:21:54] birth and your birth it was a peculiar
[1:21:57] birth which one brother the one we
[1:21:59] celebrated with ronnie no the rebirth
[1:22:03] that was a peculiar birth
[1:22:06] that was different than what the world
[1:22:08] can ever celebrate
[1:22:10] peculiar birth
[1:22:13] notice he goes on he mentions a peculiar
[1:22:16] life how many could relate to a peculiar
[1:22:19] life here tonight
[1:22:20] is your life peculiar
[1:22:24] he comes and he says oh is this a
[1:22:26] peculiar ministry
[1:22:28] he mentions a peculiar feeling
[1:22:30] a peculiar child a peculiar specie
[1:22:35] a peculiar time
[1:22:37] peculiar ways
[1:22:39] peculiar actions a peculiar stone
[1:22:43] a peculiar sword or peculiar thing
[1:22:47] but more than that a peculiar people
[1:22:51] notice he says were called out of the
[1:22:54] world how many are called out of the
[1:22:56] world tonight
[1:22:58] remember a privileged people tonight he
[1:23:01] said we're called out of the world a
[1:23:03] peculiar people to do what to serve god
[1:23:08] god called an odd bunch of people to
[1:23:10] serve him
[1:23:12] he got a bunch of odd preachers to
[1:23:14] preach for him
[1:23:16] peculiar
[1:23:20] he says oh he peculiar to serve god and
[1:23:23] he said zealous unto good works
[1:23:27] notice in another place brother ram says
[1:23:28] peculiar because
[1:23:31] now we know that we're peculiar but why
[1:23:33] are we so peculiar why would he say
[1:23:36] we're peculiar and or we're different or
[1:23:39] or we're odd or we're this or that
[1:23:41] notice he says we're peculiar because
[1:23:43] someone say because
[1:23:46] we're peculiar because we're a people
[1:23:48] that are looking to god's word
[1:23:51] there's not a people out there that are
[1:23:53] looking at god's word they're not
[1:23:56] looking to it
[1:23:57] they're looking to ball games they're
[1:23:59] looking to all kinds of uh recreation
[1:24:02] but we're a people what what are you
[1:24:04] doing here what are you doing on your
[1:24:05] birthday what are we doing here in elk
[1:24:08] season
[1:24:13] pre-destinated us to be here tonight
[1:24:21] well you say well brother man i need a
[1:24:23] little more well let me tell you in
[1:24:24] deuteronomy chapter 14
[1:24:27] and verse 2 the bible says for thou art
[1:24:30] unholy people
[1:24:37] i'm talking to you
[1:24:40] you are a holy people
[1:24:42] he said for thou art a holy people unto
[1:24:44] the lord thy god
[1:24:47] and the lord hath chosen thee
[1:24:50] to be a peculiar people unto himself
[1:24:56] above all nations that are upon the
[1:24:59] earth
[1:25:00] and then we go to the new testament and
[1:25:02] in first peter it says oh it says but ye
[1:25:06] are a chosen generation
[1:25:09] a royal
[1:25:10] priesthood a holy nation
[1:25:14] a peculiar people
[1:25:16] that you should show forth the praises
[1:25:19] of who of him who have called you out of
[1:25:22] darkness
[1:25:23] into this
[1:25:24] marvelous light
[1:25:39] you're acting like that's not enough
[1:25:48] i just told you how great and how
[1:25:49] wonderful you
[1:25:52] are and you're like oh okay
[1:26:00] you're amazing you're wonderful yeah
[1:26:02] okay
[1:26:07] right sometimes you tell your wife that
[1:26:10] say oh i love you just no you don't
[1:26:15] no no i really i really love you say no
[1:26:17] i don't know if you really do
[1:26:19] and hear the lord's telling you tonight
[1:26:21] i love you your chosen people you're a
[1:26:24] wonderful people
[1:26:25] i don't know if he really does
[1:26:30] oh baby
[1:26:31] [Applause]
[1:26:34] maybe maybe i'm young maybe he loves
[1:26:37] that side better than this side
[1:26:49] now remember he said we're peculiar
[1:26:51] because
[1:26:54] we're looking to god's word
[1:26:58] we're peculiar because
[1:27:00] we're looking to god's word
[1:27:03] now if we're looking to god's word and
[1:27:05] we're peculiar because of that somewhere
[1:27:07] somebody left god's word
[1:27:11] because if they had it we wouldn't be
[1:27:13] peculiar looking for it
[1:27:16] but we know in the book of revelations
[1:27:18] right we we go in there and we see that
[1:27:21] there's a rebuke
[1:27:22] to every age
[1:27:27] notice
[1:27:28] the book in ephesus what was the rebuke
[1:27:31] thou has left thy first love
[1:27:36] we move on quickly into smyrna what was
[1:27:38] the rebuke i know thy blasphemy

[1:27:45] doctrine of balaam and nicolaitans
[1:27:48] we go to thiateria what was the rebuke
[1:27:52] thou suffers that woman jezebel to do
[1:27:55] what to teach
[1:28:02] to teach
[1:28:04] and serve
[1:28:06] the rebuking sardis i have not found thy
[1:28:09] work perfect before god
[1:28:12] notice the rebuke in philadelphia thou
[1:28:15] has little strength
[1:28:20] that's like many people
[1:28:22] in our day
[1:28:23] say well i got a little bit brother

[1:33:05] mad at all the preachers goody goody
[1:33:15] you know that was a rebuke in that age
[1:33:18] many people said well he did say that at
[1:33:20] least we have a little bit
[1:33:24] did you not listen to brother ronnie's
[1:33:26] service last night
[1:33:28] he said we're in the bright age
[1:33:32] he said we're there
[1:33:35] the limit
[1:33:36] i said oh my goodness then why are we
[1:33:38] wearing
[1:33:40] you should have been in coming in and
[1:33:41] encouraging your brother
[1:33:44] encouraging your sister
[1:33:46] hey how many times as a preacher have
[1:33:48] you gone to the hospital and the very
[1:33:50] person you're talking to encourages you
[1:33:53] and you walk out of there and say well i
[1:33:55] came to encourage her
[1:33:56] and i'm more encouraged than ever
[1:34:01] then i said did the pastor need some
[1:34:13] you know brother wendell
[1:34:16] one thing while we walked around so it's
[1:34:17] really tough
[1:34:24] it's a different breed of people these
[1:34:26] days
[1:34:28] they just won't listen
[1:34:32] you tell them the truth and they get
[1:34:34] upset
[1:34:46] notice in the last stage the rebuke to
[1:34:48] the philadelphia to the laodicean age
[1:34:50] was lukewarm
[1:34:53] wretched
[1:34:55] miserable
[1:34:57] poor
[1:35:00] blind
[1:35:03] naked
[1:35:09] but notice this in the church age book
[1:35:11] brother man comes back and he says every
[1:35:14] fresh and true revival
[1:35:18] somebody say fresh
[1:35:20] somebody say true
[1:35:22] he said every fresh and true revival
[1:35:25] will be
[1:35:26] because men have gotten back to the word
[1:35:30] for their age
[1:35:38] notice he said the cry of every age is
[1:35:41] the rebuke
[1:35:42] you have left the word of god repent
[1:35:46] and come back to the word
[1:35:48] for the first book in the bible genesis
[1:35:51] to the last book revelation there is
[1:35:53] only one reason for god's displeasure
[1:35:58] somebody say one reason
[1:36:00] there's only one way to really upset our
[1:36:03] god
[1:36:10] and that is leave
[1:36:11] his
[1:36:13] word
[1:36:20] and you say well brother i don't know i
[1:36:22] just i just don't know what's happening
[1:36:23] in my life
[1:36:25] you know what's happening
[1:36:27] where did you leave him
[1:36:31] let's make it simple
[1:36:35] say i'm having issues wait wait let's go
[1:36:37] back
[1:36:38] let's find where you left it
[1:36:41] now i'm not talking about the trials and
[1:36:43] tribulation that he allows us to go
[1:36:45] through
[1:36:46] you know the difference between that
[1:36:49] but there's something where he said oh i
[1:36:51] just don't feel it anymore you know i'm
[1:36:53] not so sure you know maybe church ain't
[1:36:55] that important anymore you know i kind
[1:36:57] of this or that whatever that it is
[1:37:00] maybe you're getting a little lukewarm
[1:37:03] and you know it
[1:37:07] and notice brother adam because he says
[1:37:09] there's only one reason for god's
[1:37:11] displeasure leaving the word he said and
[1:37:14] there is only one remedy
[1:37:17] to regain his favor back to the word
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:28] that's pretty simple isn't it
[1:37:30] even us in new mexico could understand
[1:37:32] that
[1:37:34] he said if we have god upset somewhere
[1:37:36] we left his word
[1:37:38] and all we have to do is repent and do
[1:37:40] what come back to his word
[1:37:46] well praise god
[1:37:49] i i i'm not so sure i like when someone
[1:37:51] tells me what's wrong and they never
[1:37:53] give me the answer
[1:37:56] right say oh well this is wrong and this
[1:37:57] is happening okay well tell us the
[1:37:59] answer
[1:38:02] tell me how to get out of this
[1:38:04] [Applause]
[1:38:07] well
[1:38:08] praise the lord
[1:38:10] so i'm going to ask how many here have
[1:38:12] gotten back to the word
[1:38:17] how many here have gotten back to the
[1:38:19] word
[1:38:24] then don't fuss about it
[1:38:27] all right
[1:38:31] when the revival comes
[1:38:32] don't fuss about it
[1:38:42] i say when the revival comes don't fuss
[1:38:44] about it
[1:38:49] don't try to put it in the box
[1:38:52] and say well this is the way the revival
[1:38:53] has to be
[1:38:56] oh this is the way the revival has to be
[1:38:59] well let me tell you the revival will be
[1:39:01] however god wants it to be
[1:39:04] i ain't gonna put him into a box if i
[1:39:07] want to shout herself if i want to run
[1:39:10] around if i want to cry i'll cry if i
[1:39:13] don't want to say a word i won't say a
[1:39:16] word but don't tell me how my revival is
[1:39:19] because i know what's happening in here
[1:39:26] and because people are out there jumping
[1:39:27] and shouting don't be jealous
[1:39:33] hey i'm happy when i see people shouting

[1:51:34] right
[1:51:36] good brother
[1:51:39] actually that care about you yeah let's
[1:51:41] go on to spend it
[1:51:43] right where's god tonight yeah
[1:51:45] where is he way out there
[1:51:58] so our opening scripture right
[1:52:01] book of ephesians
[1:52:03] notice we find out when you search it
[1:52:05] out it's written to believers
[1:52:08] somebody say that it's written to me
[1:52:11] brother says not to the outside world
[1:52:14] but to the saints
[1:52:17] a chosen people
[1:52:20] the book of ephesians to a predestinated
[1:52:23] people
[1:52:24] to a redeemed people
[1:52:27] and we understand the revelation of this
[1:52:29] was given to paul by the holy ghost
[1:52:33] it wasn't paul but it was the holy ghost
[1:52:36] working through paul
[1:52:38] to give us this revelation so this
[1:52:41] revelation doesn't come by man it's not
[1:52:44] a man just calling you a chosen people
[1:52:46] tonight
[1:52:47] it's not a man saying you're privileged
[1:52:49] just because he thinks so but it's
[1:52:51] because god thinks so
[1:52:53] [Applause]
[1:52:56] but notice brother ben takes that in the
[1:52:58] adoption theory and he says now he says
[1:53:00] the first thing he says
[1:53:02] and he's talking about the revealed word
[1:53:05] he said the first thing paul starts out
[1:53:07] here to tell the people he said remember
[1:53:09] this is to the church
[1:53:12] not to the outsider
[1:53:14] it's a mystery and a riddle to him
[1:53:19] never able to understand it it goes over
[1:53:22] the top of his head
[1:53:25] but notice he said he does no more know
[1:53:27] about it than nothing
[1:53:29] but watch what he says bought to the
[1:53:32] church
[1:53:33] he said it's honey it's rock
[1:53:37] oh he said it's joy unspeakable
[1:53:43] oh it's blessed assurance somebody say
[1:53:45] blessed assurance
[1:53:47] it's the anchor of the soul
[1:53:50] it's our hope and our stay
[1:53:53] it's the rack of ages
[1:53:57] and it's everything
[1:53:58] that's good
[1:54:01] it's everything that's good
[1:54:04] now the bible said
[1:54:06] in first john it says behold
[1:54:08] what manner of love the father hath
[1:54:10] bestowed upon us
[1:54:13] that we should be called
[1:54:15] the sons
[1:54:16] of god
[1:54:19] therefore the world no with us not yeah
[1:54:25] because it knew him not
[1:54:28] it says beloved now somebody say now
[1:54:32] now are we the sons of god
[1:54:37] and daughters
[1:54:39] now we're the sons of god and it does
[1:54:41] not yet appear
[1:54:43] what we shall be but but know that when

[1:54:54] i'm trying to close here so listen he
[1:54:56] says no he says the bible said

[2:01:19] in the mind of christ
[2:01:25] that the human being
[2:01:27] has the privilege
[2:01:30] to enter
[2:01:32] in
[2:01:40] remember
[2:01:42] satan himself
