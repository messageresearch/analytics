[45:56] Romans the fourth chapter and the 19th
[45:58] verse and from there we'll go to the
[46:01] book of Jude the 1 chapter and the 17th
[46:03] verse y'all pray for me this evening my
[46:06] voice is a little rough in this morning
[46:08] so y'all just keep me in your prayers
[46:10] and we'll get through this Romans
[46:14] 4:19 it says and being not weak in faith
[46:17] he considered not his own body now dead
[46:20] and when he was about 100 years old
[46:22] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[46:25] and he staggered not at the promise of
[46:27] God through unbelief but was strong in
[46:29] faith giving glory to God and being
[46:32] fully persuaded that what he had
[46:33] promised he was able also to
[46:36] perform in the book of Jude the 1
[46:38] chapter in the 17th
[46:42] verse it says but beloved remember ye
[46:45] The Words which were spoken before of
[46:47] the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ
[46:49] how that they told you there should be
[46:50] mockers in the last time who should walk
[46:53] after their own ungodly lust these be
[46:55] they who separate themselves sensual not
[46:58] having not the spirit but ye beloved
[47:01] building up yourselves on your Most Holy
[47:03] Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep
[47:06] yourselves in the love of God looking
[47:08] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:10] into eternal
[47:11] life tonight I like to take my text out
[47:14] of the 20th verse but ye beloved
[47:16] building up yourselves in The Most Holy
[47:18] Faith and the prophet of God would say
[47:20] this little lady sitting right there
[47:21] second one right in the back she's
[47:23] bought her with nervousness isn't that
[47:25] right lady see what I mean this demon
[47:27] knows if that woman will halfway believe
[47:29] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and
[47:31] that I'm his Prophet that it'll have to
[47:33] leave her and that demon was calling out
[47:35] to that one for help to help accumulate
[47:37] unbelief but he's lost the battle sure
[47:40] he has faith is gathering and tonight i'
[47:43] like to take for a title fear not faith
[47:46] is gathering let's bow our heads dear
[47:49] father Lord we come before you this
[47:50] evening Lord we thank you for this
[47:51] opportunity Lord to Lord be able to
[47:53] stand before these things father Lord
[47:55] these Believers are like Precious Faith
[47:57] father as we enter into this service
[47:59] father Lord your anointing is already
[48:00] here your spirit's already here we F we
[48:02] felt you the entire service and I ask as
[48:05] we enter in Father Lord to this portion
[48:06] of the service that you would just move
[48:07] in a mighty way that you would just move
[48:09] Lord this broken body aside father Lord
[48:12] and you would just speak through me
[48:13] Father Lord that your word would come
[48:14] forth in fullness and power and
[48:16] authority Lord and that you would meet
[48:18] the needs of each and every uh person in
[48:20] the building father we put the service
[48:21] into thy hands Lord I Surrender myself
[48:23] to you father Lord I ask that you would
[48:25] just come and move in a mighty ways we
[48:27] put the service to our hands in Jesus
[48:28] name we pray amen yall can be seated
[48:33] fear not faith is gathering the prophet
[48:36] would say when you're converted to
[48:37] Christ a love to Christ then you
[48:39] accumulate a faith in Christ like you
[48:42] would to your wife or to your husband
[48:44] you accumulate a faith that you walk in
[48:46] that faith and you just something about
[48:48] you something that anchors you there you
[48:50] see well that's the same way it is with
[48:52] Christ and what Christ says you believe
[48:54] it you just stay right with it and it
[48:57] just raises you right up above it and
[48:59] God brings it to pass and fulfills his
[49:01] promise amen tonight as we stand here as
[49:04] Believers what sets us apart from the
[49:06] rest of the world what sets what sets
[49:07] you and I apart from the rest of the
[49:09] world is that we believe God we believe
[49:11] his word no matter how dark the
[49:12] situation gets no how no matter how G
[49:14] the situation around us may be or no
[49:16] matter how hard life may get we have a
[49:18] rock that we stand on and that we anchor
[49:20] ourselves too and that rock or that
[49:21] Revelation is that God is able to
[49:23] perform what he said in his word if we
[49:26] believe that we we have faith in that we
[49:27] stand and confidence on that and the
[49:29] term believer it's only used two times
[49:31] in the Bible and the definition and the
[49:33] strongest concordance for that term is
[49:35] one who has kept the faith one who is
[49:37] fully persuaded and to trust in Jesus as
[49:40] able to Aid either in obtaining or in
[49:43] doing something and to entrust one's
[49:45] spiritual well-being to Christ so as
[49:47] Believers we are fully persuaded there
[49:49] is no doubt there is no fear there is no
[49:51] unbelief we don't stand on something
[49:53] intellectual we don't stand on something
[49:54] carnal we don't stand on a man's idea on
[49:56] a man's opinion or on or on a man's um
[49:59] we don't stand on something that's
[50:00] fallible but we stand in faith on a word
[50:02] that is never changing we stand on a
[50:04] word that is Jesus Christ the same
[50:06] yesterday today and forever and you know
[50:08] that that scripture is something we
[50:09] quote so much Jesus Christ the same
[50:11] yesterday today and forever it's
[50:12] something we quote so much you know if
[50:14] you're raised in the message church
[50:15] you've probably heard that quoted
[50:17] thousands and thousands of times that
[50:18] scripture but to the believer it's not a
[50:20] cliche to you and I that's not just
[50:22] something that we say whenever times are
[50:23] tough to make us feel better it's not
[50:25] just a good saying it's not not just a
[50:27] nice a nice phrase that we say but to
[50:28] you and I it's a revelation that if he
[50:30] ever was God he still is God if he ever
[50:33] was a Healer he still is a Healer if he
[50:35] ever was a deliver he still is a
[50:37] deliverer amen if he ever opened the
[50:39] blinded eyes he still opening the
[50:40] blinded eyes if he ever did walk on
[50:42] water he's still walking on water if he
[50:44] did it once he'll do it again amen as a
[50:47] Believer I don't put my trust in the god
[50:48] of yesterday I don't put my trust in the
[50:50] god of tomorrow oh but I put my trust in
[50:52] the god that's going to meet me right
[50:54] here tonight amen you know I you know I
[50:57] I love hearing about what he did in the
[50:58] past I love hearing about the
[51:00] testimonies and what he did back there
[51:01] and I'm excited to hear about what he's
[51:03] going to do in the future you know but a
[51:05] presentent God or but a god of yesterday
[51:07] don't do me no good right now a god of
[51:09] tomorrow don't do me no good right now
[51:10] but I serve a presentent god he's God
[51:13] right now he's a Healer right now he's
[51:15] still saving Souls right now he's
[51:18] healing the Brokenhearted right now he's
[51:20] open the blinded eyes right now he ain't
[51:22] a God of yesterday he ain't a God
[51:24] tomorrow but he's a god of right now now
[51:27] and we stand in faith on
[51:30] that amen we stand in faith we stand in
[51:33] faith on a God that when Moses stood on
[51:35] the mountain and said what shall I call
[51:36] you he said tell them I am that I am not
[51:39] I was not I will be but he said I am
[51:42] that I am amen just tell them I am and
[51:45] if you do that 50 years from now I'll
[51:47] still be I am if you tell them that 60
[51:49] years from now I'll still be I am when
[51:51] they're going through the storm and the
[51:52] rain's pouring I'll still be I am when
[51:55] times get tough and you're in trial and
[51:57] Hell rages I'll still be I am don't tell
[51:59] them I'm a got it yesterday don't tell
[52:01] them I'm a got it tomorrow but tell them
[52:03] I am that I am and I'm here to tell you
[52:06] tonight we can stand in the faith of a
[52:08] god that is I am today he is still I am
[52:11] he is still walking and today Among Us
[52:14] he is still living inside us he is still
[52:16] watching over his bride he is still
[52:17] living inside his bride he is still
[52:19] moving through the message of the hour I
[52:21] don't serve a dead God I don't serve
[52:23] that God but I serve a god that is alive
[52:25] today and he is living inside of me and
[52:28] then the prophet of God would say if
[52:29] he's dead why serve him he would say if
[52:32] he a god at times past why live for him
[52:34] but I don't believe that's the God I
[52:35] serve I believe that I can stand in
[52:37] faith that if he did it every one time
[52:39] in all history if he didn't it once he
[52:41] can do it again maybe he didn't do it a
[52:43] thousand times maybe he didn't do it a
[52:44] million times maybe you think that a
[52:46] situation you're going through that
[52:48] nobody's ever gone through this but I
[52:49] promise you if he ever did it one time
[52:51] in all of history he can do it again
[52:54] because he never changes he said Jes
[52:56] Christ the same yesterday today and
[52:58] forever and if he did it once he can do
[53:00] it again amen we can stand in perfect
[53:03] faith and it's an accumulating Faith or
[53:05] gathering Faith as a prophet would say
[53:07] and this word accumulate it means to
[53:09] gather to build up to assemble to amass
[53:12] it means to gather together and to focus
[53:14] on one point or on one body I believe
[53:17] the day we are living in there is a
[53:18] faith that has been gathered together
[53:20] and has been focused on the bride body
[53:22] of Jesus Christ and not only that but I
[53:24] believe that when the faith of the word
[53:25] is PL on the inside believer it doesn't
[53:27] just sit idle it doesn't just sit there
[53:29] and never move and never grow and never
[53:31] work but the prophet of God said that
[53:33] whenever that Faith begins to accumulate
[53:35] he says it will accumulate until it
[53:36] won't take no for an answer that faith
[53:38] will grow until it won't take no for an
[53:40] answer that faith will begin to grow
[53:42] until it'll manifest the supernatural
[53:44] that faith will begin to go and it'll
[53:46] begin to build and it'll begin to build
[53:47] it'll begin to build until there's no
[53:49] room for fear there there's no room for
[53:51] doubt till there's no room for unbelief
[53:53] and I just want to say there is no room
[53:54] for unbelief in this message there
[53:56] there's no room for fear in this message
[53:58] there's no room for doubt in this
[53:59] message there is no room for any of that
[54:01] second Timothy 1 17 for God had not
[54:04] given us a spirit of fear but of power
[54:07] and of love and of a sound mind this
[54:09] message does not produce fear this
[54:10] message didn't come to scare you and
[54:12] living a holy life this message didn't
[54:14] come to shock fear Into the Heart of
[54:15] believer I'm not living in a message of
[54:17] fear but I'm living in a message of
[54:19] faith I'm living in a message of Victory
[54:22] I'm living in a message of Freedom I'm
[54:23] living in a message that produces Divine
[54:25] Healing I'm living in a message that
[54:27] produces the supernatural it produces
[54:29] the will of God it still produces those
[54:32] things I'm living in a message of Faith
[54:34] amen the prophet said my faith doesn't
[54:36] anchor in what the coming meetings will
[54:38] be my faith doesn't rest and what only
[54:40] in only in ability that I would have or
[54:42] upon what church I should join or what
[54:44] people I should associate with my faith
[54:46] anchors and rest entirely upon the
[54:49] finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:51] that has already been received he said
[54:53] it's already been received so you can't
[54:55] have perfect faith in something that's
[54:57] fallible you can't have unadulterated
[54:59] faith in an adulterated word you can't
[55:01] have true faith if it's a false message
[55:04] oh but my faith doesn't anchor in
[55:05] something that fails my faith doesn't
[55:07] anchor in something that only works for
[55:09] a short amount of time my faith doesn't
[55:10] anchor in something that has ever failed
[55:13] over my faith is anchored in the
[55:14] finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:16] and it's already been received it's
[55:18] already been received inside of me all
[55:20] it's doing now is building all it's
[55:22] doing now is gathering all it's doing
[55:24] now is accumulating oh Hallelujah that
[55:26] faith is
[55:27] building oh I'm here to tell you tonight
[55:31] Brad oh you ain't got to live in fear
[55:33] any longer you ain't got to live in
[55:35] unbelief you ain't got to live under
[55:36] condemnation you ain't got to live under
[55:38] any demon power you ain't got to live
[55:40] under sickness because there is a faith
[55:42] that has been given to the bride through
[55:44] the prophet of Malachi 4 he has given
[55:46] you a bride he has given you a faith and
[55:49] he has instilled an inside of you oh a
[55:51] common belief I see so many times I
[55:52] think throughout the message is that
[55:54] that was for brother bandom oh that was
[55:56] for him that was for his ministry oh
[55:58] they say well all that was just to draw
[56:00] the crowds in no that was for you to do
[56:02] he said you're going to do what I did
[56:04] that that same power that was on the
[56:06] inside of me brother BR said it is now
[56:08] inside of a bride of Jesus Christ that
[56:11] faith is now inside you that Victory is
[56:13] now inside you that power is now inside
[56:15] you oh Elisha didn't come and say well
[56:18] the god of Elijah did this and the god
[56:20] of Elijah did that no he said I am
[56:22] Elijah and I have the same power that
[56:24] Elijah had I had the same Authority that
[56:27] Elijah had and watch me watch as I watch
[56:30] as I as I wave my reignment watch as the
[56:33] waters uh split apart just like they did
[56:35] for Elijah watch as I do the same thing
[56:37] as Elijah did because I didn't come to
[56:39] talk about Elijah I came to talk about
[56:41] the God of Elijah and the god of Elijah
[56:44] is still here the god of Elijah is still
[56:46] alive the god of Elijah is still living
[56:48] in The Bride of Jesus Christ and there
[56:50] is a faith that is gathering tonight oh
[56:53] let sin accumulate oh let fear
[56:55] accumulate let unbelief accumulate let s
[56:58] accumulate but then going to do no good
[57:00] cuz there was another Force there is
[57:02] accumulating inside of this body T not
[57:04] and there is a faith that is gathering
[57:07] oh watch out devil oh it's dangerous oh
[57:11] Christians get dangerous whenever Faith
[57:13] begins to build Christians get dangerous
[57:15] whenever Faith begins to gather oh he

[1:01:38] brother bam said David saw the victory
[1:01:41] before he ever face Goliath and
[1:01:43] therefore he could stand in in faith he

[1:01:47] adversary because he already saw the
[1:01:50] outcome of the battle oh church I'm here
[1:01:53] to tell you tonight we've already seen
[1:01:54] the outcome of the battle we already
[1:01:56] know the outcome of the war we've

[1:02:11] outcome we know where he ends up and we
[1:02:13] know where we end up we know who we are
[1:02:16] and we know who he is and we know that
[1:02:18] there is a faith Gathering here in this
[1:02:20] Tabernacle tonight and I'm here to tell
[1:02:23] you the devil you better watch out oh
[1:02:25] because I believe there are some people
[1:02:26] in this building T not that they're
[1:02:28] going to gather some Faith oh Hallelujah
[1:02:31] and they're going to run you into the
[1:02:32] ground oh this is not a church of
[1:02:35] unbelief this is not a church of fear
[1:02:37] this is not a church of doubt this is
[1:02:40] not oh a church that just goes this way
[1:02:42] in the wind and goes that way in the
[1:02:43] wind and follows after a man or after a
[1:02:46] denomination oh but this is a church
[1:02:48] that follows after the message of the
[1:02:50] hour and we stand in faith we can stand
[1:02:53] in a in a in a gathering and
[1:02:55] accumulating faith that he is going to
[1:02:57] fulfill his word
[1:03:01] amen the prophet said that little house
[1:03:03] wife he held that little baby in her
[1:03:05] arms and she wasn't afraid of the king's
[1:03:08] commandment she didn't care what the
[1:03:10] king said because she know God was able
[1:03:12] and God would keep his word and if we
[1:03:14] could only accumulate that kind of Faith
[1:03:17] tonight he said get that kind of Faith
[1:03:21] he get that kind of Faith living among
[1:03:23] us and moving in our beings moving
[1:03:26] through the church not just an emotional
[1:03:28] Faith but a real Solid Faith that won't
[1:03:30] take no for an answer know that God says
[1:03:33] so when that settles it he said it ain't
[1:03:35] just an emotional Faith you know it's
[1:03:37] really easy to have faith whenever
[1:03:39] you're sitting in church oh in the power
[1:03:41] of the Lord's move and there's oh it's
[1:03:43] easy to believe then it's easy to
[1:03:45] believe whenever everybody's on their
[1:03:46] feet everybody shouting everybody's
[1:03:48] praising it's easy to believe whenever
[1:03:49] you walk through the prayer lines and
[1:03:51] the meetings oh but what happens on
[1:03:53] Tuesday what happens on Friday whenever
[1:03:55] you're sitting at home and that complex
[1:03:57] begins to begins to rage in your mind
[1:04:00] what happens on the weekday when you're
[1:04:01] sitting at home and you've had a bad day
[1:04:03] at work oh and you just oh what happens
[1:04:06] then he said it's not an emotional Faith
[1:04:08] it's not something that can just be oh
[1:04:10] it is a solid faith and the messages of
[1:04:13] the hour is what builds up this Faith oh
[1:04:16] I'm here to tell you I'm just as strong
[1:04:18] Monday as I was on Sunday I'm just as
[1:04:21] strong Tuesday as I was on Monday I'm
[1:04:23] just as strong Thursday as I was on
[1:04:25] Wednesday oh because I am a believer I
[1:04:29] don't need a preacher to just come and
[1:04:31] to give me everything oh but I have the
[1:04:34] power I have the faith I have the
[1:04:36] authority I can speak the
[1:04:39] word oh when that Faith begins to
[1:04:42] accumulate oh it begins to build up and
[1:04:44] build up oh if you go and you read
[1:04:47] stories brother R talks about a lot if
[1:04:48] you read stories about Muhammad Ali and
[1:04:51] how he would fight what he would do was
[1:04:53] he would let the enemy come and just
[1:04:54] beat on him and beat on him and beat on
[1:04:56] him meanwhile he's sitting there and
[1:04:58] he's just accumulating oh he's letting
[1:05:01] the enemy beat on him and he's just
[1:05:03] accumulating oh he lets every emotion
[1:05:05] that he has he lets the anger just
[1:05:07] accumulate he lets that just build up
[1:05:09] and build up and build up oh until he
[1:05:11] look him in the eye and he gives him
[1:05:13] everything he has and he beat every
[1:05:15] single opponent and I say if anger will
[1:05:17] do that to a man what will the faith of
[1:05:19] a living God do that in the Bride of a
[1:05:21] Believer if it'll accumulate and
[1:05:23] accumulate oh a devil oh maybe you've
[1:05:26] hit me maybe you've knocked me down oh
[1:05:29] maybe you think you killed me oh but it
[1:05:31] ain't over yet I've accumulated faith
[1:05:33] and it's explosion time it's Rapture
[1:05:36] time it's body change time oh it's time
[1:05:40] that I defeat the Devil it's time that I
[1:05:42] punch the devil it's time that I sucker
[1:05:45] punch him right where he's needed it oh
[1:05:47] let that Faith accumulate tonight oh
[1:05:50] just let it begin to build let it begin
[1:05:52] to grow until it won't take no for an
[1:05:54] answer you know what that means that
[1:05:57] means whenever you claim healing and you
[1:05:58] don't get it you keep claiming it that
[1:06:00] means when you claim freedom and you
[1:06:02] don't feel it that means you keep
[1:06:03] claiming it oh that means whenever you
[1:06:06] don't feel good you still claim your
[1:06:08] healing when you don't feel like it you
[1:06:10] still say God said he would do it for me
[1:06:13] and I am standing in faith oh
[1:06:18] hallelujah oh if the word said it I
[1:06:21] believe it because I am a believer oh I
[1:06:24] am a believe I am a believer If the
[1:06:27] message said it I believe it if the word
[1:06:29] said it I believe it I don't believe
[1:06:31] there's any difference between the two I
[1:06:32] me a lot of people who think there's a
[1:06:34] difference there's the word and there's
[1:06:36] the message oh but their problem is they
[1:06:38] ain't got a revelation of what it is cuz
[1:06:40] if you get a revelation of this message
[1:06:41] you know that it is just as much word as
[1:06:44] the Bible is that we read and I say I
[1:06:46] maybe the Bible don't clearly state it
[1:06:48] but we had a prophet that came and that
[1:06:50] opened up this book to us in a way that
[1:06:52] we could never have imagined he came and
[1:06:54] he opened up this Bible and he said the
[1:06:57] prophet has come and he has Vindicated
[1:06:59] his word he has opened up his word to
[1:07:01] his bride and now everything that the
[1:07:03] prophet said you apply it everything the
[1:07:06] prophet said you live it everything the
[1:07:08] prophet had the power to do you've got
[1:07:10] the power to do because we are made out
[1:07:13] of bad material we are made out of word
[1:07:15] material we are made out of that
[1:07:18] material oh Hallelujah you aren't made
[1:07:21] out of material that falls apart you
[1:07:23] aren't made out of material that just
[1:07:25] will go so far and then quit in defeat
[1:07:27] you ain't made out of that kind of
[1:07:29] material oh but I'm standing before a
[1:07:31] bride I believe tonight that you're made
[1:07:33] out of word material oh I'm looking at a
[1:07:36] bride oh whenever that same material
[1:07:39] that Noah's made out of when the Hebrews
[1:07:41] 11 when it said by faith Noah built an
[1:07:44] ark I believe we're made out of the same
[1:07:45] material Abraham was made out of when it
[1:07:48] said by faith Abraham claimed his
[1:07:50] inheritance oh I believe I made out of
[1:07:52] the same word material that Enoch was
[1:07:55] made out
[1:07:56] when it said by faith Enoch took a body
[1:07:58] change we're made of the same material
[1:08:01] oh and I'm just going to say I believe
[1:08:03] Hebrews 11 is just getting started right
[1:08:06] now it's got 40 verses I can see verse
[1:08:08] 41 by faith Caleb took a body change
[1:08:11] verse 42 by faith Josh Martin stepped
[1:08:14] into his theophany verse 43 by faith
[1:08:18] there was an overcoming bride by faith
[1:08:21] oh there were some young people that
[1:08:23] were going to stand on the word by faith
[1:08:26] oh I've got some young sisters who won't
[1:08:28] be overcome by complexes by faith I'm
[1:08:30] going to have some young boys who will
[1:08:32] say I was called to stand on the word I
[1:08:36] was called to accumulate Faith oh
[1:08:40] hallelujah oh man you were made out of
[1:08:44] word material oh I'm telling I preach to

[1:09:09] no devil in hell that could ever give

[1:24:09] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:24:12] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:24:15] nor things present nor things to come
[1:24:18] nor he nor death nor any other creature
[1:24:21] shall be able to separate me from the
[1:24:23] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:24:25] lord he said I am persuaded oh
[1:24:29] everything he had been through look at
[1:24:31] Paul's life if anyone had the right to
[1:24:32] sit around the M it was Paul if anybody

[1:24:36] complain it was Paul if anybody had the
[1:24:38] right to sit there and the sing what was
[1:24:40] me it was Paul but look at him oh

[1:25:27] the midst of Chaos in the midst of
[1:25:29] Heartache in the midst of Trials I am

[1:25:34] trying to kill him I am persuaded in the
[1:25:37] midst of every devil in hell after him I
[1:25:39] am persuaded in the midst of every
[1:25:41] problem I am persuaded the prophet said

[1:26:23] better than the prophet oh he just
[1:26:25] dramatized it oh it just makes your
[1:26:27] heartache the way he dramatized that
[1:26:28] story oh that woman crawling to Jesus on

[1:27:26] the word that down on the inside of her
[1:27:29] oh no devil in hell is going to be able
[1:27:30] to stop her nothing's going to be able
[1:27:32] to stop her oh I am persuaded that

[1:28:08] the victory he said before one rock ever
[1:28:11] came out of the building walls of
[1:28:13] Jericho he was already walking around
[1:28:15] the walls shouting the victory for by
[1:28:17] faith he saw the Victory and he know
[1:28:20] that the walls was coming down he and
[1:28:22] his armed men walked around and around
[1:28:24] and around Jericho for 7even days in
[1:28:26] full armor doing what because he was
[1:28:29] looking at the Unseen it was a promise
[1:28:31] that God had made and now how much can

[1:31:05] stop this word nothing can stop this
[1:31:08] message oh once he gets going the
[1:31:10] prophet of God said when you know who
[1:31:11] you are you will be an invincible Army
[1:31:14] and I say if we know who we are why do
[1:31:17] we let Devils take us oh if we knew who

[1:31:41] purpose under the
[1:31:43] heaven a time to be born a time to die a
[1:31:46] time to plant and a time to pluck up
[1:31:48] that which is planted A Time to Kill a
[1:31:51] time to heal a time to break down and a
[1:31:54] time to build up he said there's a time
[1:31:55] to break down and there's a time to
[1:31:58] build up you know we know in the story
[1:32:00] of Hezekiah where he requested 15 more
[1:32:02] years from the prophet and brother
[1:32:04] Brandon would say that the reason he
[1:32:05] asked for that time he said the reason
[1:32:07] he asked for that time was so that
[1:32:09] Hezekiah could break down the authors of
[1:32:11] baill and build up the altars of God you
[1:32:13] look King Josiah as 16-year-old boy okay

[1:32:19] church we ain't talking about some man
[1:32:20] who's well established we're talking
