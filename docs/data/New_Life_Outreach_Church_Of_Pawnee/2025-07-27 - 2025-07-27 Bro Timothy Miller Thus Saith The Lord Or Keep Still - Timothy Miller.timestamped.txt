[5:21] power would come down in that room and
[5:23] touch him, Lord. God, we've seen you
[5:26] drop cancers. We've seen you bring

[15:50] brought me to his house.
[15:54] He said, "Fear not my child, for you are
[16:01] part of me and I'll not rest
[16:05] till you are at my side.
[16:10] I will do all that you, oh my, ask of

[16:21] virtuous woman.
[16:24] You are my bride.
[16:29] And I've responded to your call.

[17:16] I will do all that you
[17:20] ask of me. You're a jewel in my eyes.
[17:26] virtuous woman.

[19:22] no longer dead. He's risen
[19:27] and he's coming back for you and me.
[19:35] Amen. God bless you now.
[20:01] I'm really glad to be here with y'all.
[20:03] We enjoy coming here. Um, if you don't
[20:05] mind
[20:08] short, but um, I believe it was last
[20:11] week. I was struggling to breathe and I
[20:16] was up all night and my parents woke up
[20:19] in the morning. It was really early. I
[20:21] had been up all night struggling to
[20:23] breathe. And they asked me if I was
[20:25] okay. And I told them, I said, "No, I
[20:27] can barely talk." And they asked me if I
[20:30] would like for them to call the
[20:31] ambulance. And I told them that I would
[20:34] like
[20:35] So they got there and they told me that
[20:38] there wasn't really much that they could
[20:39] do that they could take me to the
[20:41] doctor, but I would be more comfortable
[20:43] with my parents. So they took me to the
[20:46] doctor and the doctor told me that my
[20:48] left lung was not functioning correctly
[20:51] and that's the reason it was hurting to
[20:53] breathe and I was struggling to breathe.
[20:55] And so she gave me some medicine and
[20:59] that night that I went home, I slept
[21:02] very well and was able to breathe and
[21:04] I'm able to breathe very well now. So
[21:06] I'm really thankful for that. So

[21:37] down. I'm losing faith and fall.

[29:24] Applegate. Uh we they you know they've
[29:28] they've probably known me uh besides my
[29:31] mother uh they've probably known me more
[29:34] longer than than uh than anyone else in
[29:36] the building. Um Sister Applegate uh
[29:40] remembers when I was just a kid. And so
[29:43] uh who would have thought that all these
[29:45] years later that that brother and sister
[29:47] Applegate would come to church uh here.
[29:50] And so we've been we've been so blessed
[29:52] to have them over the years. And um uh
[29:56] but her her oldest brother,
[30:00] younger brother uh this is this is
[30:03] brother Wall-E and uh his friend uh his
[30:09] wife
[30:11] Kathy that is with us. And he's been
[30:14] telling me for a long time that he was
[30:16] going to try to come over here someday.
[30:18] Now, they are they they drove two hours
[30:20] to get over here this morning. And uh
[30:24] Wally, I'm just so glad to see you.
[30:29] And then his daughter Teresa uh is here
[30:32] as well. And uh so we just say God bless
[30:36] all of you.
[30:39] And u uh just just really really
[30:43] wonderful. Uh we've uh you know I as I
[30:46] say I've I've always loved sister uh
[30:49] Applegate. We've uh I mean she she saved
[30:52] me when I was a little kid and and uh
[30:55] and grown up and they're from around the
[30:58] uh Henrietta area and u and then uh and
[31:02] it and it's and it's sort of a sad day
[31:05] in a way. Um, Brother Joe and Sister
[31:09] Stephanie
[31:12] uh are are are moving. They're they're
[31:15] moving to Louisiana.
[31:18] And um this will be the last service
[31:20] that Joe and Stephanie is here with us.
[31:24] And um so uh at the end of the service,
[31:29] we're going to be sending them off and
[31:31] and uh and so uh it's it's mixed
[31:35] emotions right now. U
[31:40] what God's done in Joe and Stephanie's
[31:42] life and and brought them from and and
[31:45] and these last years have just went by
[31:48] so quick. almost 10 years ago when the
[31:50] Lord saved them both from
[31:52] heroin addictions. They were they were
[31:55] in such incredible uh state of mind and
[31:58] body and soul. God saved them and has
[32:02] been they've been such a blessing to us
[32:04] here at the church and
[32:12] and so they will be moving on. uh
[32:14] they're moving to Louisiana and uh hey
[32:17] they're only seven eight hours away so
[32:20] it's not like well it is sort of like
[32:22] they're moving to another country. it's
[32:23] Louisiana, but uh but we pray God's
[32:27] blessings upon them and and we want them
[32:30] uh to feel uh you know that that we are
[32:34] we're behind them and supporting them in
[32:36] their in in their efforts and and uh
[32:39] they'll always be a part of us. And uh
[32:43] I'm just glad that God used our little
[32:45] church here to uh to have a a part in
[32:49] their lives and and what a testimony
[32:51] they are to the kingdom of God. And um
[32:55] and so we're, you know, we're just we're
[32:58] just so much blessed. We're blessed to
[32:59] have this other this this other uh
[33:02] brother there in the back uh to come and
[33:04] visit us. God bless you. Just just just
[33:07] glad to have uh everyone. We're missing
[33:09] a few here this morning, but we're glad
[33:11] to have everyone that is here this
[33:13] morning. And then uh we we had a
[33:15] surprise this morning. Brother uh
[33:18] brother Timothy Miller, who is uh a
[33:21] pastor of the No House of Prayer in in
[33:24] Noel, Missouri. He and his family uh uh
[33:27] showed up this morning. And so,
[33:31] Brother
[33:33] So, Brother Timothy Miller is going to
[33:37] be uh ministering this morning. He's
[33:39] going to be bringing the word and so
[33:41] we've got him in the back uh uh
[33:44] preparing and and uh we're fixing to
[33:46] have him to come out. So, it's just
[33:49] going to be a wonderful service. I
[33:50] believe God does everything perfect.
[33:55] Amen. Amen. And so, um, as we get ready,
[34:01] I've I've learned to I've got a new song
[34:04] that
[34:06] I might sing that this morning. Do we
[34:09] have time?
[34:11] &gt;&gt; We'll sing this song and then as we get
[34:14] ready for our brother,
[34:42] I put this at her just in case.
[34:48] Don't have as good a memory as I used
[34:50] to.
[34:56] When it was dark
[34:58] in my heart,
[35:03] you gave life to me.
[35:07] A child of darkness
[35:10] became a child of light.
[35:18] When my soul
[35:20] was so dry
[35:24] and I needed rain
[35:29] [Music]
[35:31] of life,
[35:34] you became to me.
[35:37] You can turn my guitar up a little bit.
[35:39] I am.
[35:42] I am.
[35:46] You said to me,
[35:49] I am alpha.
[35:52] I am omega.
[35:54] The in between.
[36:00] I I am
[36:03] I.
[36:06] You said to me,
[36:10] "I'll be what it takes
[36:15] to meet your need.
[36:21] You were the widow's cruise of oil
[36:26] and holy light me.
[36:30] You were the fourth man in the fire.
[36:36] A shepherd for the sheep
[36:40] and in the
[36:44] messed it.
[36:47] [Music]
[36:50] All right, let's try it again.
[36:55] You were the widow's
[36:57] cruise of oil
[37:01] and oh Elijah's me.
[37:04] You were the shelter
[37:07] for old Noah
[37:10] a shepherd for the sheep
[37:14] and in the fire.
[37:16] You were the fourth man
[37:20] and a cloud by day,
[37:24] a fire by night to lead your children
[37:30] in the way.
[37:34] I am
[37:36] I am.
[37:40] You said to me,
[37:43] I am Alpha. I am Omega,
[37:48] the in between.
[37:53] I am
[37:56] I am.
[37:59] You said to me,
[38:03] I'll be what it takes to meet your need.
[38:13] I'll be what it takes to meet your
[38:18] needs.
[38:20] [Music]
[38:25] Aren't you glad for that?
[38:28] He'll be what it takes. And I don't know
[38:31] what your need is here this morning, but
[38:33] the Lord loves his people and he's got a
[38:37] purpose for everything. And I believe
[38:39] God's got uh he's he's our needmaker. As
[38:42] the man of God comes, why don't we just
[38:44] stand to our feet here today.
[38:48] Oh, how see what key do we do that in?
[38:51] [Music]
[38:53] Oh, how
[38:55] he loves you
[38:58] and me.
[39:05] Oh, how
[39:07] he loves you
[39:10] and me.
[39:16] He gave
[39:19] his life.
[39:21] God for
[39:24] he
[39:26] [Music]
[39:31] of you
[39:33] and oh how he loves me.
[39:39] Oh how he loves you and me.
[39:46] [Music]
[39:49] Amen. And aren't you thankful for the
[39:50] love of God?
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful that we have an
[39:54] understanding?
[39:57] We live in a world that that love is a
[39:59] word that has been so twisted and so the
[40:03] meaning of it is lost.
[40:05] People don't know what it means when you
[40:07] say I love you anymore to where if you
[40:09] would tell a stranger in public I love
[40:11] you, you would feel very awkward. They
[40:12] would too maybe. Why? Because the word
[40:15] has been twisted. It's been it's been
[40:17] defiled.
[40:19] But we know that there's a pure and a
[40:21] true love that the father has for us.
[40:23] That that when we go back and we read
[40:25] the Old Testament laws and they seem so
[40:27] strange and so foreign to us, we
[40:30] understand that it was given through
[40:31] such a love.
[40:33] It wasn't just some kind of a challenge
[40:35] to him to to try to set him up for
[40:37] failure or something, but it was a love
[40:39] that God had for his people that he gave
[40:42] them the law,
[40:44] but he knew that there would have to
[40:45] take something greater than that to
[40:47] bring us salvation. And I'm glad that we
[40:49] have that today. Amen.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; I just like to say it's it's an honor to
[40:53] be here and uh just I'm not very good at
[40:57] sneaking, but I managed to sneak in and
[40:59] I thought I'd pulled it off, but uh I
[41:03] didn't didn't quite make it. So anyways,
[41:05] but I just have to believe that it was
[41:07] of God and that that he can you move me
[41:09] out of the way. And just to see a lot of
[41:12] old friends we just go way back with
[41:14] about everyone here. And brother Jimmy,
[41:16] me and him used to used to work out in
[41:18] the hot sun together and and
[41:21] slap stucco mud on the walls and the
[41:24] ceilings and and uh when we first got
[41:26] married, it's been coming up on 20 years
[41:28] ago. We we lived over there and and met
[41:30] them and it was just wonderful times and
[41:33] we we uh I enjoyed working with him.
[41:36] Good memories and good that it's
[41:37] memories, too. Well, we're not still
[41:39] doing that, brother Jimmy.
[41:41] But uh the the fellowship was good
[41:44] whether the work was pleasant or not.
[41:46] And so that made it a lot more pleasant.
[41:48] So we'll let the musicians go to their
[41:50] seats and if you turn with me to uh John
[41:53] chapter 5, we'll read our text and I
[41:56] might just give a little testimony
[41:57] before we get into the the word. But um
[42:04] just thank brother Wendell and the
[42:06] opportunity and the confidence that he
[42:08] has. I just pray that every person here
[42:09] will take a blessing and and I know if
[42:12] you come expecting then you will.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; We we had a man come to uh pick up a dog
[42:18] from 10 a couple of dogs from 10 hours
[42:20] away and uh he was going to come to our
[42:23] house and I said well Stephen I said we
[42:26] just had another brother call from
[42:28] Carolas and he was coming our way so we
[42:30] decided to have a Wednesday night
[42:32] service that we didn't normally have and
[42:35] uh so I told him I said well tell him
[42:37] we're having a service Wednesday night
[42:38] and if he wants to come Wednesday
[42:40] instead of Tuesday then I'll put him up
[42:43] in a room I thought he'll
[42:45] No, he jumped on it. He said, "Oh, yeah,
[42:47] that sounds good." I got to the church
[42:50] that evening and he was sitting in the
[42:51] parking lot and I introduced myself and
[42:53] and uh we talked a little bit and I
[42:54] said, "Well, I hope you take away a
[42:55] blessing tonight." He said, "Oh, I
[42:56] will."
[42:58] And I was just blown away. I thought,
[43:00] "What? Who goes to a church they've
[43:02] never heard of? They don't know a thing
[43:03] in the world about it. They don't know
[43:04] what they they don't know nothing."
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; But comes in and says, "Oh, I will."
[43:09] That man was expecting. I told the
[43:11] church, I said, "Well, if nobody else
[43:12] here gets a blessing tonight, that
[43:13] brother right there is going to get one
[43:14] because he come expecting and he wasn't
[43:16] coing, well, I don't know. What do y'all
[43:18] believe about this? How do y'all see
[43:19] this? And what do you think about this
[43:21] scripture?" You know, all full of
[43:22] questions and and doubts. He come
[43:24] expecting and and he went away blessed.
[43:27] And so anyways, I'll I'll stop talking
[43:30] and uh let's just have a word of prayer,
[43:32] then we'll read the text. Our gracious
[43:35] heavenly father, Lord, we come before
[43:37] you this morning, Lord, and we bow our
[43:39] hearts to you, Lord.
[43:41] God, this song says, "I am weak, thou
[43:44] art strong,
[43:46] Lord." And we know that perfect strength
[43:48] comes through perfect weakness, Lord.
[43:50] So, just let me lay myself aside, Lord,
[43:52] that you can come and you can speak to
[43:54] these people, Lord. And God, you heard
[43:56] the conversations, Lord, that they had
[43:58] on the way to church this morning, Lord.
[44:00] And you heard the questions that's in
[44:01] their hearts, Lord. the things that they
[44:03] didn't say, Lord. And God, you are the
[44:06] discerner of the thoughts and the
[44:07] intents of the heart, Lord. And God, I
[44:09] have no discernment of myself. But Lord,
[44:12] I know that you are still more than able
[44:15] to speak to every person here, Lord,
[44:17] from the eldest to the youngest, from
[44:18] the newest Christian to the most
[44:20] seasoned veteran. Lord, I lift your
[44:22] people up to you. And I ask you, Lord,
[44:24] guard my lips lest I should speak an
[44:26] offense. Father, we just love you and
[44:29] praise you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[44:33] Amen. John 5:es 19 and 20. It says,
[44:37] "Then answered Jesus and said unto them,
[44:40] verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son
[44:43] can do nothing of himself, but what he
[44:46] seeth the Father do. For what things
[44:48] soever he doeth these things also, these
[44:52] also doeth the Son likewise. For the
[44:54] Father loveth the Son, and showeth him
[44:56] all things that himself doeth, and he
[44:59] will show him greater works than these,
[45:02] that ye may marvel. Amen. You can have
[45:05] your seats.
[45:08] Before we go into the the scripture
[45:10] again, I just share a little testimony.
[45:12] And uh
[45:15] again, we've been my wife and I well 20
[45:18] years ago, we had just met and was
[45:19] getting to know each other and and uh I
[45:23] told her I said, "I'm not going to waste
[45:24] time and dating and stuff." I said, "I'm
[45:27] looking for a wife. If you're looking
[45:28] for a husband, let's talk. If you don't
[45:32] if if you don't uh if you're not
[45:35] interested in me, you just let me know
[45:37] and we'll move on. And if you're not the
[45:39] type for me, then I'll let you know and
[45:41] we'll move on. That way we don't get all
[45:43] caught up in in emotional attachments
[45:45] and get hurt or something because I I'd
[45:47] kind of done that already and I was over
[45:49] that. So, um, we we uh met in June and
[45:53] got married in February, 20 years ago.
[45:55] This this February. So, we just barely
[45:57] got to know each other. 20 years ago.
[46:02] But the doctor told us that we wouldn't
[46:03] be able to have kids without his help.
[46:05] and and he just elevated himself a
[46:08] little bit too high. And we said, "Well,
[46:10] we can't use a doctor that won't allow
[46:12] God to to be his uh his his help. If
[46:16] he's not leaning on God, he leaned on
[46:18] himself. Then what? We need to move on."
[46:20] So, we did. And uh well, you see,
[46:24] Stephen was up here and Lydia sang a
[46:25] special this morning. And then Jonathan
[46:28] um he's kind of shy when it comes to
[46:30] getting up in public when he decides to
[46:33] be. So, uh he's He's either all or
[46:36] nothing, you know, he's So anyways, it
[46:38] was 10 years between him and Lydia, but
[46:40] uh they were miracles and we're thankful
[46:44] thankful.
[46:48] We did 2012.
[46:50] We uh
[46:53] God had given us a uh vision or a dream
[46:56] or something before the children were
[46:58] born and my wife had seen
[47:01] a boy and a girl
[47:04] and we Jesus was there at our home and
[47:08] we kept watching for this fulfillment.
[47:10] thought we was going to buy a house and
[47:11] just it would all play out and had our
[47:12] minds made up. And it wasn't until it
[47:14] was all played out and done and we
[47:16] looked back on it that we realized the
[47:18] significance of what God had shown her.
[47:19] And it wasn't it it seemed like the the
[47:23] setting was just such a time of peace.
[47:26] But in reality, 2012 was just the worst
[47:29] of our life.
[47:31] We look back and realize that Christ had
[47:34] let us know he was there with us.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; He wasn't troubled. He wasn't upset.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; But I actually come to a place that
[47:42] Satan just had me down by the throat.
[47:45] I really felt like there was no hope for
[47:47] my family.
[47:49] Never amount to nothing. We never make
[47:52] it anywhere.
[47:55] So when they sing and they testify and
[47:58] so forth, it
[48:00] &gt;&gt; it means something to me
[48:02] &gt;&gt; to see what God can do
[48:04] &gt;&gt; when Satan has told you lies.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; And that's all that he can't do is he's
[48:08] a liar, the father of lies. So, if
[48:11] Satan's lying to you this morning, if
[48:13] there's a I'll tell you this. If if you
[48:15] take the scriptures, even you take this
[48:18] Bible right here, the word of God, and a
[48:21] scripture comes to you and it brings you
[48:24] down and it it brings discouragement,
[48:29] it brings hopelessness,
[48:31] it's Satan
[48:34] &gt;&gt; and it is a wrong inspiration.
[48:37] Now, it can bring conviction.
[48:40] It can it can tear the height off of
[48:42] you,
[48:44] &gt;&gt; but it's not going to push you down.
[48:46] It's not going to make you feel
[48:47] hopeless.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; It's not going to discourage you.
[48:52] If you're being discouraged, you need to
[48:53] get into the right inspiration and the
[48:55] channel of the Holy Ghost because this
[48:57] word will lift you up.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; When it tears a hide off of you, you'll
[49:02] you'll feel closer to God than you did
[49:04] before. And so uh just be careful that
[49:07] because Satan loves this word to try to
[49:11] use it and distort it and pervert it.
[49:13] And really what we find out is that when
[49:15] the one word has been changed or the
[49:17] inspiration spoken wrong, then it
[49:19] actually is no longer Christ's word, but
[49:22] it's the antichrist.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; And so we've got to watch that very
[49:25] closely. Pay attention to that. And his
[49:28] sheep know his voice, though. So that's
[49:31] why it's essential that we have the
[49:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost because it
[49:34] says he will show teach us all things
[49:36] and show us things to come.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; And so we'll get into that a little bit
[49:41] more later if if the Lord will. But we'd
[49:43] like to look at this scripture now that
[49:44] we've read and uh for a title that just
[49:47] thus sayeth the Lord or keep still.
[49:50] And and when we say when when you read
[49:53] that quote or you hear that word and you
[49:55] you think of that, I I know that it it
[49:58] seems like maybe it's just me, but you
[50:00] just kind of easy to get kind of a a
[50:03] swelled feeling like, you know, you're
[50:05] throw your chest out and like really?
[50:09] Wow.
[50:11] Thus sayeth the Lord or keep still. And
[50:14] I think of of a child when they hear
[50:16] about the genie and the lamp and you you
[50:18] rub the lamp, the genie comes out and
[50:20] when you hear that story, it sparks your
[50:22] imagination.
[50:23] And probably everybody here or most of
[50:25] us anyways has has had those thoughts,
[50:28] you know, man, I would I would wish for
[50:30] this. And boy, they just just dream
[50:31] about what would life be like if that
[50:34] happened. And I was able to to wish and
[50:36] you know, depending on your age and
[50:37] where you're at in life and so forth,
[50:39] you know, for when you're little, you
[50:40] know, it's all the ice cream you could
[50:42] ever eat,
[50:44] &gt;&gt; all the candy you could ever want,
[50:46] endless deal of soda, and now you got
[50:48] your three wishes, and you're just just
[50:51] wish yourself to death.
[50:53] and you get a little bit older and it's
[50:55] it's the sports car and it's the it's
[50:57] the uh you know the for the girls, you
[50:59] know, I don't know what girls like when
[51:01] they're because I never was a girl. I
[51:03] had three sisters, but you know, it's uh
[51:06] whatever the girls long for, you know,
[51:08] the young was like the baby dolls. um
[51:10] you know for my daughter it it might
[51:12] still be the sports car you know but uh
[51:15] anyways you know so you're you think of
[51:18] these things
[51:19] &gt;&gt; and you you just dream about imagine I
[51:22] share a little story it's kind of
[51:23] humorous but uh I worked in a little
[51:24] lumber yard and we heard a lot of
[51:26] stories and people coming through and
[51:28] and a man told us one time that his
[51:30] neighbor had come in and they was good
[51:32] buddies supposed to be you might
[51:34] question it after this story but uh he
[51:36] had come by and asked him he said uh can
[51:38] you get the lottery numbers for me from
[51:39] on the TV when they show him and and
[51:41] write them down cuz I'm going to be
[51:42] gone. I won't be able to get them. And
[51:43] he said, "Well, sure." So, the guy
[51:46] leaves and he goes over to his
[51:47] neighbor's house and he finds his ticket
[51:50] and he writes down all his numbers on
[51:51] the paper. He goes back home and the his
[51:54] buddy comes home and and he says, "Uh,
[51:56] you got them numbers?" He said, "Yeah,
[51:58] here you go." Boy, he comes back. He
[52:00] knocks on the door and he's just like
[52:02] trembling. He's white. He's he's just
[52:04] beside himself.
[52:06] You ain't going to believe this. I I
[52:08] just won so many million dollars.
[52:10] Every every one of these numbers
[52:12] matches. And man, when he told me that
[52:15] story, I just thought that's about as
[52:16] low as you could you could think to
[52:19] trick somebody. You just know all the
[52:21] way back from his house to his buddy's
[52:23] house, his brain was just 90 to nothing,
[52:27] just spinning. His life had just been
[52:30] transformed. It had been changed. Every
[52:32] care was gone. Everything was, what was
[52:35] he going to do with all this money? And
[52:37] then his buddy just sat there laughing,
[52:38] "No, you didn't." He's like, "Yes, all
[52:40] the numbers match. All the numbers
[52:42] match."
[52:44] And he said, "No, you didn't." And then
[52:47] it hit him what had happened.
[52:49] You dirty dog.
[52:52] Like I said, it's a little humorous, but
[52:54] man, just you think about those things.
[52:56] You think about, man, what would that be
[52:58] like, you know, to all of a sudden you
[52:59] legitimately in your mind you are now in
[53:02] possession of hund00 million dollars,
[53:05] you know? I mean, it just it's
[53:07] lifechanging. It's it it takes all the
[53:09] cares and everything away. But when I
[53:11] think about those things for myself and
[53:14] home, I got a little mirror that we
[53:15] finally got put up on the pull pit and
[53:17] and some of these things I just pick up
[53:18] my mirror and preach to myself and say,
[53:20] you know, for myself, when I think about
[53:22] these things and I begin to to ask
[53:24] myself, do I believe this word?
[53:28] Okay.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; When I think about the peace and the the
[53:31] satisfaction and the the the cares all
[53:34] gone, I mean, just what it would mean to
[53:35] me, how it would change my life for for
[53:38] $100 million just to be set at my
[53:41] possession and what I could do with it
[53:43] and all that. And just, you know, and
[53:44] then I think, well, wait a minute. Do I
[53:46] really believe what I read in this word?
[53:51] because there's so much greater
[53:54] &gt;&gt; than $100 million
[53:56] &gt;&gt; is promised to the believer.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; But yet it's so easy sometimes to sit at
[54:02] home and to to just, you know, when when
[54:04] no one else is around and we haven't
[54:06] been to church in a couple of days and
[54:08] and whatever in the morning in the heat
[54:10] and the trials and it's so easy to hear
[54:12] the voice of Satan whispering these
[54:14] things, you know, that oh, you know,
[54:16] well, what about this and what about
[54:18] that and what about this and what about
[54:20] that?
[54:21] and it searched to way on us
[54:26] &gt;&gt; and we think well thus sayeth the Lord
[54:28] or we keep still again you know but I I
[54:32] wonder if it's maybe that Hollywood
[54:36] has put painted pictures in our mind
[54:38] these little stories that seem innocent
[54:39] you know the the genie and all this it
[54:42] it's it's it's it poisoned our minds a
[54:45] little bit to where we really struggle
[54:46] it's just a fairy tale to us we really
[54:48] don't quite have a a fullblown
[54:51] revelation.
[54:53] Maybe that's not a good way to say it,
[54:54] but a good a revelated faith in the word
[54:58] of God.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says we've all got faith.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; But in Revelations, there was a mighty
[55:05] angel that came down and he said there
[55:08] was an open book in his hand and and he
[55:10] said to the angel on the earth, he said,
[55:12] "Take this book, John, and eat it."
[55:16] &gt;&gt; The open book. This book was open. Now,
[55:18] what honestly I never really understood
[55:20] that what does it mean to be an open
[55:21] book until I got around other people
[55:24] that we fellowship around the word and
[55:26] they didn't see it and everything you
[55:28] give them. They say, "Well, well, that
[55:29] was for another day. That was for the
[55:31] apostles." I'll tell you what he told
[55:32] the apostles. I go to prepare a place
[55:34] for you. Are you going to pawn that to
[55:36] the apostles,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; brother? Was that just for them?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Why do we take that one and just scrap
[55:42] the rest of them?
[55:44] &gt;&gt; That was for another day. That was for
[55:46] me. Amen.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for the bride of Jesus
[55:49] Christ. She's been taught in this day
[55:50] that every scripture from Genesis
[55:52] through Revelation, every word, as the
[55:55] Bible says is given by inspiration is
[55:58] profitable.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; So, it's valuable to me.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; I got to thinking recently and I get a
[56:05] little bit scattered. So, bear with me.
[56:06] Hold on. We'll try to tie all of it
[56:07] together. I won't leave you hanging too
[56:08] bad. But I got to think about that the
[56:10] other day about the where it says the
[56:12] mixed garments,
[56:14] the wool, the I should not mix woolen
[56:16] and linen and so forth. And I thought,
[56:18] man, we couldn't ever possibly really go
[56:20] back and and and live and and wear
[56:23] garments like that describes. It'd be
[56:26] almost impossible. But but that
[56:28] scripture has a meaning to me. What what
[56:29] does that scripture mean to me? How can
[56:31] I apply that to my life?
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, first of all, I
[56:35] know we all know that God doesn't like
[56:37] mixed things. He doesn't like mixing
[56:40] different things. But then it hit me,
[56:41] you know, that this was written again
[56:44] by the God who created the heavens and
[56:47] the earth, the God who spoke the
[56:50] universe, the God who has wisdom that is
[56:53] is far beyond anything that Elon Musk
[56:55] could ever dream of having
[56:58] &gt;&gt; or anybody else has ever walked. There's
[56:59] no man that could ever come close to
[57:01] touching the wisdom of God. and he said
[57:04] this
[57:05] &gt;&gt; and now because we don't understand it
[57:07] we laugh and scoff and just discard it
[57:09] and say well you know that don't mean
[57:11] nothing to me
[57:13] there's a value to that
[57:16] &gt;&gt; that still to this day I believe it
[57:18] would be the best way to do it if we
[57:20] never got away from that we'd be better
[57:21] off I believe that you don't have to
[57:22] agree with me that's just what I believe
[57:24] because that's what God said but then
[57:27] begin to think about that these you know
[57:28] that the Sabbath is no longer a Saturday
[57:30] that we observe and we don't work and
[57:32] all these things. We still consecrate
[57:34] Sunday to the Lord. We still give him a
[57:36] day of the week and and I personally try
[57:38] to um to reverence on Sunday and and and
[57:41] consecrate to that to the Lord, not out
[57:44] of Sabbath because he is the Sabbath.
[57:46] So, it's a spiritual arrest for the
[57:48] believer.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; But
[57:52] what if we apply that spiritually? The
[57:55] bride is dressed in what?
[57:57] His word.
[57:59] So in the spiritual world, in the in the
[58:02] spirit realm, we have got to be dressed
[58:03] in the word and it cannot be a mixed
[58:05] dress.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; But I got to thinking about that
[58:07] scripture and I just about got shouting
[58:09] just thinking about that scripture about
[58:11] a mixed garment.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; I thought, man, that's that's something.
[58:15] It is still valid. There is still
[58:17] something there for me.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; I don't want nothing mixed with the word
[58:20] of God to to be my covering.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; So
[58:28] again, we say, "Thus sayith the Lord,"
[58:30] or "Keep still."
[58:32] And when we get that that that little
[58:34] thought, you know, what would we do if
[58:36] we had thus sayith the Lord? What would
[58:37] we do if we just, you know, basically
[58:39] like a magic wand or something where we
[58:41] could just walk around? And
[58:44] I want to look at that a little bit this
[58:46] morning.
[58:48] The scripture said that Jesus answered
[58:50] and said unto them, "Verily, verily, I
[58:53] say unto you, the Son can do nothing of
[58:57] himself,
[58:59] but what he seeth the Father do."
[59:02] So, if we think somehow that we're
[59:04] greater than Jesus and we could just go
[59:06] out, you know, because it's easy to get
[59:08] the thought, well, you know, first off,
[59:10] let's go to the bar. We're going to take
[59:11] the bars out now. We're we got thus
[59:13] sayeth the Lord. We're we're headed
[59:14] straight for the bars. We're going to
[59:15] wipe out the hospitals. We're gonna
[59:16] we're gonna, you know, this this this
[59:18] battle's gone and this struggle's gone
[59:20] and this addiction and this temptation
[59:22] gone. Gone. Gone. Gone.
[59:25] Why didn't God do that already? He don't
[59:26] need us to do that. He could have done
[59:27] that a long time ago.
[59:30] Why didn't he do that? Because that's
[59:32] not his plan. First off, we're free
[59:34] moral agents.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; So to think that, you know, that that
[59:37] it's all you take it too far to free
[59:39] will or something. No, you got to have
[59:40] the balance because you got to
[59:41] understand this mess is not from the the
[59:44] predestination.
[59:46] The mess we're in is from the free will
[59:49] &gt;&gt; because God's given us free will. So, we
[59:51] have a will and we have a choice and we
[59:53] have a responsibility to make a choice
[59:55] &gt;&gt; and it's our choices has created the
[59:58] mess that we live in.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; This world and his condition is is here
[1:00:02] by the free will of man. And so, if God
[1:00:06] just wanted to obliterate all evil, he
[1:00:07] would have done it already. It's not the
[1:00:09] time for that. So if we've got if if
[1:00:12] we've got the think the thought in our
[1:00:14] mind that we've got this power that
[1:00:15] we're just going to go we're going to go
[1:00:17] com and we're going to we got to stop
[1:00:21] and remember if if Jesus himself said
[1:00:24] the son can do nothing but what he seeth
[1:00:26] the father do
[1:00:28] for whatsoever he doeth these things
[1:00:31] these also doeth the son likewise. Well
[1:00:32] you say well you know that Jesus was God
[1:00:35] himself. So he had something that we
[1:00:37] don't have and and so he could do things
[1:00:40] and he could see things and he could you
[1:00:42] know like he was some greater power than
[1:00:44] us. Well, but he has given his power
[1:00:46] into the church.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And remember he is the word. The angel
[1:00:52] gave the book and said eat the book.
[1:00:56] And then this come to me the other day I
[1:00:57] began to think you know it's easy to get
[1:00:59] a thought that that book has been eaten.
[1:01:01] Now John took the book from the angel.
[1:01:03] He ate it. So that's been fulfilled.
[1:01:06] But John represented every one of us
[1:01:08] here this morning.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; The eating of the book is not over.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; So are we just in a grazing stage now
[1:01:15] where we we walk by and just get a
[1:01:17] little bit here and there?
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; It's not going to work very well because
[1:01:24] if if he didn't do anything until the
[1:01:26] father had showed him, how did the
[1:01:29] father show him? Well, if you go back
[1:01:31] and check, when he would tell his
[1:01:33] disciples the things that were going to
[1:01:35] come of him, the way that he was going
[1:01:37] to be beaten and the things the the the
[1:01:40] death that he would die and so forth, he
[1:01:41] would tell his disciples these things
[1:01:43] and they never could quite catch it.
[1:01:44] Why? Because the Holy Ghost wasn't there
[1:01:46] to quicken it to him yet. So, they
[1:01:48] didn't understand it. All fulfilled just
[1:01:50] as he had told them. Where did he get
[1:01:51] that information? Was this just a
[1:01:54] connection with God that God was showing
[1:01:56] him all these things and telling him
[1:01:57] these things and we don't have that so
[1:01:59] we can't do as he did? No. He got it
[1:02:01] from the word.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; He searched the scriptures and he found
[1:02:07] himself because he took in there and he
[1:02:09] said he found where it was written.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; So he knew in the scriptures what would
[1:02:13] come of him. So it it was shown to him
[1:02:16] through the scriptures.
[1:02:18] So, we have the opportunity to search
[1:02:20] the scriptures, find oursel in the
[1:02:22] scriptures. You know, I've read the
[1:02:24] Bible through 10 times and I've never,
[1:02:26] but go back and seek the Lord and let
[1:02:28] him open these things up to you because
[1:02:31] he will, as he said, he will teach you
[1:02:33] all things and show you things to come.
[1:02:36] It doesn't mean you need to have a
[1:02:37] vision or you need somebody to come and
[1:02:39] give you a supernatural word from the
[1:02:41] Lord. And we put all these things out of
[1:02:43] reach. We don't. Satan does. He wants
[1:02:46] these things to be out of our reach up
[1:02:48] here somewhere.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, God did this and God did
[1:02:51] that, but God defeated Satan with it is
[1:02:54] written.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; It's not out of our reach.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; You want a greater arsenal of weapons,
[1:03:00] get a greater arsenal of scriptures.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; You You want more You want more to fight
[1:03:05] with, go back and eat more of the book.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; And so, I'm I'm guilty. Here's my I need
[1:03:10] that mirror again because I I I
[1:03:13] obviously eat
[1:03:16] But have I been eaten?
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And I realize there's a problem here. I
[1:03:20] haven't been eating. Feasting. We can we
[1:03:22] can feast on this.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; This is from too much feasting in the
[1:03:26] natural. The feast in the spiritual
[1:03:28] though will produce a a a revelation.
[1:03:32] It's not just a knowledge. It can't just
[1:03:33] be a a head knowledge that comes from
[1:03:35] reading this book and knowing all the
[1:03:37] scriptures. Again, it's got to be the
[1:03:39] inspiration that comes that brings the
[1:03:41] revelation. And that revelation
[1:03:45] shows us the things to come. It will
[1:03:47] show us before it happens and we
[1:03:48] realize, hey, you know what? There's
[1:03:50] something coming here, God speaking to
[1:03:52] our heart and showing us things through
[1:03:53] the word
[1:03:56] says, notice the harmony of the father
[1:03:58] and the son. Jesus never did anything
[1:04:01] until it was first showed him by the
[1:04:02] father. St. John 5:19. This harmony now
[1:04:06] exists between the groom and his bride.
[1:04:10] Yeah, it's easy to kind of get the
[1:04:11] attitude. Well,
[1:04:14] what good is it to have a spoken word if
[1:04:15] if be able to speak things if can't use
[1:04:19] it? Who said you can't use it?
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You ever had a little thought like that?
[1:04:23] Well, oh, yeah, that's good. But then if
[1:04:26] we can do nothing until Jesus shows us,
[1:04:28] well, good. No,
[1:04:30] that's the childish mentality. You watch
[1:04:32] a child, you know, well, I want to
[1:04:33] drive, Dad. I want to drive. Well, you
[1:04:34] can sit in my lap and I'll I'll let you
[1:04:36] steer. Never mind. They want to drive.
[1:04:40] They want full control of the vehicle.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; But you can't have that yet. You're not
[1:04:46] there yet. You know, I I I in my flesh,
[1:04:49] you know, I'm thinking, you know, I'm
[1:04:50] going to speak the word and I'm going to
[1:04:52] have power over unclean spirit. I'm
[1:04:53] going to have power in it. He says,
[1:04:55] "Well, first exercise the power to put
[1:04:57] your fork down and quit eating so much
[1:05:00] and and get the natural man in check."
[1:05:02] You say, "Well, that's kind of no." Do
[1:05:04] we have power? We have power then. And I
[1:05:08] believe that I can have power
[1:05:10] that I can put this body in subjection.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And things like that that we can that we
[1:05:15] have the we let's exercise the power on
[1:05:17] the little things.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; You know, if if you're a teenager here
[1:05:20] this morning and you want to drive dad's
[1:05:22] truck and he's kind of being a little
[1:05:24] obstinent about it or stubborn or uh
[1:05:26] resistant, he don't quite want you back
[1:05:28] there yet. Go clean your room.
[1:05:31] Pick up the candy wrappers out of the
[1:05:32] floor.
[1:05:35] I'm telling you, you can you can talk
[1:05:37] all day long and try to convince him and
[1:05:38] he walks into your room and and trips on
[1:05:40] something or steps on his flashlight or
[1:05:43] whatever you left in the floor. He ain't
[1:05:45] want you behind the wheel.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; And you say, "What's that got to do? I
[1:05:49] can drive the truck. It don't matter."
[1:05:51] So, I forgot to put his flashlight away
[1:05:52] or his tools or whatever you borrowed
[1:05:54] from dad that you left in in the yard
[1:05:56] and he hit it with the mower or
[1:05:57] whatever. What's that? That don't got
[1:05:59] nothing to do with me driving.
[1:06:02] It's responsibility.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; If you ain't going to take care of a $5
[1:06:06] flashlight or a $100 flashlight or a
[1:06:09] $500, whatever.
[1:06:11] You don't need to be behind the wheel
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; because it takes attention to detail.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; And God has wisdom and he knows these
[1:06:18] things. And so he knows that, you know,
[1:06:20] we he he's watching our daily conduct.
[1:06:24] You know, when when we spill something
[1:06:26] at the restaurant and it dumps all over
[1:06:28] the place or at the house by ourselves,
[1:06:31] we get our cup of coffee and we sit down
[1:06:32] and we bump it and knock it over. And do
[1:06:35] we have that much power?
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Have we come that high in the word that
[1:06:39] we have the power to to thus sayith the
[1:06:41] Lord or we keep still?
[1:06:44] We just keep still. We say, you know,
[1:06:47] that's just the devil. We'll just resist
[1:06:49] and say, Satan, you ain't going to get
[1:06:51] me frustrated over a silly cup of
[1:06:53] coffee. Are we that far in the word? We
[1:06:54] got that that kind of power. We was here
[1:06:56] at the meetings one year and and my
[1:06:58] little boy boy, he just likes to dump
[1:07:00] stuff out sometimes. He kind of got past
[1:07:02] it a little bit now, but you know, he
[1:07:03] get a bottle of water and take the lid
[1:07:04] off of it and just dump the whole thing
[1:07:05] out for no reason. And so we was getting
[1:07:08] ready to try to head home and and
[1:07:10] sometimes I struggle when it's been a
[1:07:12] long weekend especially, but I I just
[1:07:13] sometimes I really struggle with driving
[1:07:15] long distances and uh just getting
[1:07:17] sleepy. And so I was like, let's let's
[1:07:19] get on the road. I'd like to get on home
[1:07:20] before it gets late. And so it's kind of
[1:07:22] struggling trying to get everybody
[1:07:23] rounded up. You know how it is. And and
[1:07:25] lo and behold, I get in the car and
[1:07:26] everybody's ready to go and and
[1:07:29] water bottle dumping in the floor. And I
[1:07:32] jumped out and I started get frustrated
[1:07:34] and I I kind of got a little, you know,
[1:07:36] composure there, regained it. But but
[1:07:38] that started speaking to me on the way
[1:07:39] home and I thought, you know, there's
[1:07:42] power in the word of God. Power to
[1:07:44] control that part of nature.
[1:07:48] Where's the power in my life to control
[1:07:50] that? My my emotions,
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; these little things.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; I began to realize recently as I, you
[1:07:58] know, was thinking about our reaction to
[1:08:00] other people. And I began to realize in
[1:08:02] the scripture, there's no scripture
[1:08:04] given on a retaliation and and getting
[1:08:07] back at someone. Every scripture is
[1:08:10] always love them, pray for them, be kind
[1:08:12] to them, turn the other cheek.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; None of that.
[1:08:17] So, we want thus sayith the Lord or
[1:08:18] we're going to keep still. So, when it
[1:08:20] comes to what am I going to do about
[1:08:21] what this person did to me, we need thus
[1:08:23] sayith the Lord. Here it is.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; We don't need a supernatural voice to
[1:08:28] speak to us and say here's what you need
[1:08:30] to do now.
[1:08:32] We need to go back to the Bible. Here's
[1:08:33] the thus sayith the Lord. This is thus
[1:08:35] sayith the Lord right here.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; What does it say to do about this?
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; How should I handle this situation with
[1:08:41] this person? Go back. Thus say the Lord.
[1:08:43] It's right here.
[1:08:48] This harmony now exists between the
[1:08:50] groom and the bride. He shows her his
[1:08:53] word of life. She receives it. She never
[1:08:55] doubts it. Therefore, nothing can harm
[1:08:58] her, not even death.
[1:09:01] Again, now we're thinking about this
[1:09:02] like this is something that we literally
[1:09:05] possess.
[1:09:07] This is not something that is just out
[1:09:09] there somewhere. You know, there there's
[1:09:11] a a lottery ticket that's available.
[1:09:13] maybe we can buy it and hope that we
[1:09:14] could win it or something. It's not like
[1:09:16] that. No, this is literal possession for
[1:09:18] the believers.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:21] We need that revelation
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; because just like the thought of having
[1:09:25] that money, if we had that kind of
[1:09:27] money, what and what it would change our
[1:09:28] life, if we catch a revelation of who we
[1:09:31] are
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; and and how that we don't have to go
[1:09:34] around frustrated all the time and
[1:09:36] discouraged and upset and and and we can
[1:09:38] live a happy overcoming Christian life
[1:09:41] and and it's going to change our life.
[1:09:44] The problem is we want to control it
[1:09:46] through the flesh.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; And the flesh wants the circumstance to
[1:09:50] go away.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; We want to change that circumstance. But
[1:09:54] there's another person inside of us. And
[1:09:56] and when you really study the Bible out,
[1:09:57] if you're applying everything to the
[1:09:59] flesh, you're going to get in trouble
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; because it doesn't apply to the flesh.
[1:10:03] It applies to the spirit. You read
[1:10:06] Romans 8:28. It says, "All things work
[1:10:08] together for the good to them who are
[1:10:10] called and those who love the Lord." And
[1:10:12] I'm quoting it wrong, but
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; that doesn't mean the flesh.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; When you apply that to the flesh, then
[1:10:20] you're going to go do a good deed. And
[1:10:22] this is a way that Hollywood paints the
[1:10:23] picture.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; They paint the picture that, oh, you go
[1:10:27] give somebody $10 because you feel sorry
[1:10:29] for them and they need money and
[1:10:30] somebody else going to turn around give
[1:10:31] you 10,000. You say, "Why are you
[1:10:33] talking about money?" Because it's so
[1:10:35] relatable. It's so relatable. You You
[1:10:37] get them image of money in your mind. It
[1:10:40] it it it makes you think. We all
[1:10:42] everybody here, we all relate with
[1:10:43] money.
[1:10:45] And so that's the picture that's
[1:10:46] painted. It goes back to the flesh. A
[1:10:48] fleshly blessing comes. You give a
[1:10:49] little fleshly, you get a little
[1:10:50] fleshing back.
[1:10:53] But what if we give our $10 and then
[1:10:55] somebody just comes screaming in our
[1:10:57] face, shaking their finger from the
[1:10:58] church.
[1:11:00] Well, now you're in revival. Actually,
[1:11:03] you say, "Why would my flesh have
[1:11:04] revival?" No, the flesh isn't going to
[1:11:06] have revival. But the spirit man has a
[1:11:08] revelation that brings revival. And the
[1:11:10] Bible says when they go to point their
[1:11:12] finger in your face and shout to you for
[1:11:14] something you did, whatever, you can
[1:11:15] jump and run and shout and dance and
[1:11:17] have a revival because you're blessed of
[1:11:19] the Lord.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Now that's farfetched. Let's
[1:11:22] just read. It's not my notes, but let's
[1:11:24] go to it."
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Turn with me real quick to Luke 7, Luke
[1:11:30] 6, six or seven. We'll find it.
[1:11:36] And now we we don't need a piano. We
[1:11:38] don't need organ. We don't need a
[1:11:40] guitar, drums, none of that to have
[1:11:42] revival. Although those are nice and I
[1:11:45] really the again the flesh likes the
[1:11:48] ones that got all those things involved.
[1:11:49] But the spirit man can have the revival
[1:11:51] of this of the word here.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; And so it's word revival. We want a word
[1:11:55] revival, right?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; So let's see. All right. Let's start
[1:12:03] with verse 20. 620. Luke 6:20. He lifted
[1:12:06] up his eyes on his disciples and said,
[1:12:08] "Blessed are the ye poor, for yours is
[1:12:10] the kingdom of God." Well, the flesh
[1:12:12] isn't really excited about that, is it?
[1:12:15] But we can take consolation. We don't
[1:12:17] have a lot of money. So, hey, he did at
[1:12:19] least say we're blessed. So, you know,
[1:12:21] blessed are you that hunger, for now you
[1:12:23] shall be filled. Blessed are ye that
[1:12:25] weep, for you shall laugh. Okay, that's
[1:12:28] comforting. That's all right, right?
[1:12:30] Blessed, but that's not the revival yet.
[1:12:32] Blessed are ye when men shall hate you
[1:12:35] and when they shall separate you from
[1:12:37] their company. You're in their company.
[1:12:39] This isn't strangers on the road that
[1:12:40] you don't know. Those are the ones that
[1:12:42] are pretty easy. Like, what's that guy's
[1:12:44] problem, man? It wasn't me because he
[1:12:45] don't even know me. But this is people
[1:12:47] in your company.
[1:12:50] Blessed are ye when men shall hate you,
[1:12:52] and when you shall separate you from
[1:12:54] their company, and shall reproach you,
[1:12:58] and cast your name as evil for the son
[1:13:01] of man's sake.
[1:13:06] This don't sound like a good blessing to
[1:13:08] me, but the flesh is getting in the way.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; The spirit says, "That's thus sayeth the
[1:13:17] Lord." Okay.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Rejoice in that day and leap for joy.
[1:13:22] For behold, your reward is great in
[1:13:24] heaven. For in like manner did their
[1:13:26] their fathers unto the prophets. The
[1:13:28] problem is we we look at that and we
[1:13:30] say, "Well, this, you know, the
[1:13:31] prophets, they were out preaching the
[1:13:32] gospel. They were out doing great mighty
[1:13:34] works for God. They were out doing these
[1:13:36] wonderful things and and that's why
[1:13:38] people got upset with them." And so that
[1:13:40] was for righteousness sake. This person
[1:13:42] is just upset because I took their
[1:13:44] parking spot at the church and I didn't
[1:13:45] even mean to do it. I was running late.
[1:13:48] All right.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; This isn't spiritual at all,
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; but is it?
[1:13:55] Is it?
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Go back and look what Jesus did. He went
[1:13:58] and healed a man that was had a withered
[1:14:00] arm
[1:14:02] and he healed him. And that boy, that
[1:14:04] that's the revival right there, right?
[1:14:06] We can shout, "This guy's been withered
[1:14:07] up for years, been a Christian all his
[1:14:09] life, went to church, and the the
[1:14:10] priests were so dead, they couldn't help
[1:14:12] him. They had the word that was sent to
[1:14:14] heal him, but they wasn't using it,
[1:14:15] right? because it wasn't healing him.
[1:14:18] But Jesus comes along and knows how to
[1:14:19] use the word and he gives them the word
[1:14:21] and it heals him and they what do they
[1:14:23] want to destroy him?
[1:14:26] He wasn't out preaching, evangelizing,
[1:14:28] condemning them. He didn't have the whip
[1:14:30] in his hand. He wasn't out there chasing
[1:14:32] them and saying, "You sinners, get back
[1:14:33] here and repent. I'm going to He healed
[1:14:36] a man's withered hand and it said he
[1:14:38] they wanted to destroy him."
[1:14:42] So just understand this that Satan knows
[1:14:47] who you are and where you belong and
[1:14:49] he's going to bring an attack from any
[1:14:51] way that he can. So when somebody when
[1:14:53] you get under attack and you realize
[1:14:54] somebody's persecuting you, you can say,
[1:14:56] you know what, that person may be my
[1:14:58] brother. So I can't say that, you know,
[1:15:00] well, this is the enemy. He's not the
[1:15:02] Again, we're go back into the flesh and
[1:15:03] the spirit. This is their flesh, but
[1:15:05] it's the in the spirit realm. is
[1:15:07] bringing an attack
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; against your flesh.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; But in the spirit realm, it's because
[1:15:14] you are a Christian and because you are
[1:15:16] one of his that that there's an attack
[1:15:18] that's coming. You can rejoice. Now
[1:15:19] you're in revival.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; So the next time somebody starts that,
[1:15:22] just start shouting. Say, "Thank you,
[1:15:24] Lord. Thank you, Lord. What's your
[1:15:26] problem? I'm trying to tell you how you
[1:15:28] did me wrong." And you're Well, the
[1:15:31] Bible says to shout and rejoice and
[1:15:33] dance.
[1:15:36] See, it's thus sayith the Lord. This is
[1:15:38] not the way we think of thus sayith the
[1:15:40] Lord, is it?
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Again, we got that Hollywood picture.
[1:15:43] We're out here bristled up. We're going
[1:15:44] to defeat all these devils.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; But we need to go home and look in the
[1:15:48] mirror and say, you know, I know there's
[1:15:52] all these things that I don't like about
[1:15:53] myself.
[1:15:55] I got that kind of power.
[1:15:58] Lord, let's work on this guy here first.
[1:16:00] Because the thing is is when we can
[1:16:02] yield ourselves and we we get into a
[1:16:04] fellowship with Christ and we're really
[1:16:06] surrendered, he'll speak more to us.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; He'll speak more to us. When if we're if
[1:16:11] we're focused on this and that and our
[1:16:13] attention is not on him like it should
[1:16:14] be and our our fellowship is not in him
[1:16:17] like it should be, then he just has to
[1:16:19] kind of back off.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; You know, Peter began to sink, but when
[1:16:23] he asked the Lord, the Lord reached out
[1:16:25] and helped him.
[1:16:27] Sometimes God's just waiting on us to
[1:16:29] say, "Hey, I'm tired of fighting this on
[1:16:32] my own. I got resources here that I'm
[1:16:33] not using.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Let's not going according to plan, my
[1:16:39] plan, flesh, what I had."
[1:16:42] But I believe that there's something
[1:16:45] here.
[1:16:47] The word for this uh see
[1:16:52] this harmony is now to exist between the
[1:16:54] groom and his bride. He shows her his
[1:16:57] word of life. She receives it. She never
[1:17:00] doubts it. Therefore, nothing can harm
[1:17:02] her. Now, you see, this is the thus
[1:17:05] sayeth the Lord that we're receiving
[1:17:07] when we're receiving that word into us.
[1:17:09] Now, if we're going to speak thus sayeth
[1:17:11] the Lord, we've got to have that word in
[1:17:13] us for it to come forth out of our lips.
[1:17:18] This isn't just some again some big
[1:17:20] supernatural show that God's going to
[1:17:22] put on for everybody where he just
[1:17:23] starts, you know, saying, "Hey, tell
[1:17:25] them this, tell them that, tell them
[1:17:26] this." It's something inside of the
[1:17:28] person already that that God has been
[1:17:31] honing, God has been shaping. God has
[1:17:33] been changing. The word has been in
[1:17:35] there. We've been receiving that word,
[1:17:38] becoming one with him. And then when he
[1:17:40] speaks, we're just so in love with him.
[1:17:42] Well, that's what he said.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. So that's what I'm
[1:17:46] going to say. That's his stand on it. So
[1:17:50] we're coming to a time that there's an
[1:17:52] ecumenical movement that's going to be a
[1:17:54] a a joining together, a uniting time,
[1:17:57] but it's not around the word.
[1:18:00] And the churches that are going to come
[1:18:02] together around their own creeds and
[1:18:04] dogmas and so forth, they're going to
[1:18:07] come together and they're going to
[1:18:08] persecute the bride, the one has
[1:18:09] received the true word and will not
[1:18:11] compromise on it. And there's going to
[1:18:12] be that persecution coming. And we're
[1:18:15] going to have to know these things. And
[1:18:17] we're going to have to have the Holy
[1:18:18] Spirit in there to recognize and to call
[1:18:20] out the false because people are looking
[1:18:22] for the the Antichrist as an opposite.
[1:18:24] You know, we're white. He's going to be
[1:18:25] black and dressed in black and a hood
[1:18:28] over his. No.
[1:18:30] No. Go back in Revelations. The
[1:18:31] Antichrist come out. He copied Jesus and
[1:18:33] he got him a white horse
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; until almost deceived the very elect.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; But God said, "Now wait a minute. Look,
[1:18:42] is that really me?
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Wait. No. And that's the same thing
[1:18:46] today. He's not going to come out here
[1:18:47] with a pitchfork and a and and and
[1:18:49] speaking evil, hateful things and all
[1:18:51] this stuff.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; He's going to come with the word.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; You know, it's interesting. I'm hearing
[1:18:57] that this new pope, American pope, is
[1:19:00] speaking about going back to the word
[1:19:02] and and cutting out some of these things
[1:19:04] that is is against the word that has
[1:19:06] come into the Catholic Church and kind
[1:19:07] of a revival and a restoration going on.
[1:19:11] But will he take every word?
[1:19:14] The bride has the mind of Christ for she
[1:19:17] knows what he wants done with the word.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; No, you've got to apply that to
[1:19:25] yourself. You've got to take that
[1:19:27] personally and say, you know what, this
[1:19:29] this isn't this isn't word for the
[1:19:31] ministers. This isn't word just for for
[1:19:34] a prophet or or for a the pastor or or
[1:19:37] just the men or something like that.
[1:19:38] know this is the word for these young
[1:19:40] ladies right here.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; So, well, how how can I know?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Well, I think our problem is we're just
[1:19:48] very very busy nowadays. We got a lot of
[1:19:52] things to pull our minds and pull our
[1:19:54] attention and everything. We've got to
[1:19:56] recognize the value of of what is here
[1:19:59] and what we've been given and and get
[1:20:01] our minds back and change the channel
[1:20:03] and get it right back to the channel of
[1:20:05] the Holy Ghost. and and you look in the
[1:20:08] book of Acts and you think about, you
[1:20:10] know, how much time could they have
[1:20:11] spent on YouTube and Facebook and and
[1:20:13] all these other distractions and so
[1:20:15] forth and still went out and preached
[1:20:16] the gospel as they did.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; See, they they they notice the tongues
[1:20:22] and so forth in the book of Acts. They
[1:20:24] come out like drunk men staggering
[1:20:26] around. We try to copy that. They spoke
[1:20:28] in unknown tongues and they we try to
[1:20:30] copy that. Everybody understood in their
[1:20:32] own language. We want to copy that. We
[1:20:34] want to see all that stuff happen. But
[1:20:35] then they sat around and they dwelt on
[1:20:38] the word of God. They fellowshipped
[1:20:41] around the word of God.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; I believe it needs to be lifted back up.
[1:20:47] It needs to become more important to us.
[1:20:48] We've got to recognize the hour that
[1:20:50] we're living in. And and we're not going
[1:20:52] to find rapturing faith or thus sayeth
[1:20:54] the Lord through all these other things.
[1:20:57] It's got to be every word.
[1:21:01] The bride has a mind of Christ. For she
[1:21:03] knows what he wants done with the word.
[1:21:06] If you don't know, if you got questions
[1:21:09] about that, get your Bibles out and get
[1:21:11] real serious with God and say, "Lord, he
[1:21:13] said that I would know what you want
[1:21:15] done and how to use your word, and I
[1:21:17] don't really have that real clear in my
[1:21:19] mind. I need a revelation."
[1:21:22] It might cost you your fun times. It
[1:21:24] might cost you hanging out with your
[1:21:25] friends. It might cost you some things
[1:21:27] you really want to do, but are we going
[1:21:29] to live in the flesh? Are we going to
[1:21:30] pursue the spirit?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; She performs the command of the word in
[1:21:39] his name. For she has thus sayeth the
[1:21:42] Lord. Then the word is quickened by the
[1:21:45] spirit and it comes to pass like a seed
[1:21:49] that is planted and watered. It comes to
[1:21:51] full harvest serving its purpose. Those
[1:21:53] in the bride do only his will.
[1:21:57] So, it's not our thoughts about what all
[1:21:59] needs to be done here. We're going to go
[1:22:01] we're going to go out here and conquer
[1:22:03] something. It's just surrendering.
[1:22:05] Just surrendering, giving ourselves to
[1:22:07] the Lord, say, "Lord,
[1:22:09] whatever you want to do in my life
[1:22:11] today.
[1:22:13] You look and sometimes it's the most
[1:22:14] simple little thing." I was listening to
[1:22:15] a tape this morning. Brother Rand was
[1:22:16] saying that he went out in the woods and
[1:22:18] a mosquito come after him and just
[1:22:20] something spoke forth. He didn't rise up
[1:22:21] and roll this mosquito, I'm a son of
[1:22:23] God. What's he got no business? No, he
[1:22:26] just something spoke out of him. It
[1:22:29] really wasn't even him making a
[1:22:30] conscious effort. He just said, "There
[1:22:32] won't be a one bother me today." And
[1:22:34] there was mosquitoes everywhere
[1:22:37] and not another mosquito come and bother
[1:22:38] him.
[1:22:40] Simple little thing like that. Well, why
[1:22:42] would God waste his power on little
[1:22:44] nuisance things like, "Yeah, that'd be
[1:22:46] great. But we got much more important
[1:22:47] things." No, we've got to get in the
[1:22:50] channel of God and get into the mind of
[1:22:52] God. And then if he wants to speak to
[1:22:55] the mosquitoes, he can. He made the
[1:22:56] mosquitoes. Why did he make the
[1:22:57] mosquitoes? We think it's silly that he
[1:22:59] would speak to the mosquitoes. Why did
[1:23:01] he even make them? But he did. Why does
[1:23:05] he give them their breath? He did. God
[1:23:07] is sovereign. He does things the way
[1:23:08] that he wants to. And you look at David
[1:23:10] and Goliath and he chose a little boy to
[1:23:13] run out there with a sling and a stone.
[1:23:14] Go back into Acts and there was a king
[1:23:16] that rose up and he exalted himself and
[1:23:18] he just fell and crumpled in the floor
[1:23:20] dead and the worms ate him.
[1:23:23] You understand that David wasn't
[1:23:25] listening. The voice of the giant was so
[1:23:27] loud that it terrorized everybody out
[1:23:29] there. But David was listening to
[1:23:31] another voice that said, "Let there be
[1:23:33] light."
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; And the voice that said, "Let there be
[1:23:36] light," was much greater than the voice
[1:23:38] that said, "I defy you." David had heard
[1:23:42] another voice. And that voice he knew
[1:23:43] was so much more powerful, so much more
[1:23:46] authority, so much greater than this
[1:23:48] voice that he was hearing.
[1:23:51] See, again, David had the word of God
[1:23:53] there, and he knew what God had said
[1:23:55] about him.
[1:23:57] If David had been out there playing on
[1:23:59] his phone, I don't think he'd have
[1:24:01] probably been so hot with Goliath.
[1:24:06] I I think we're we got distractions. I
[1:24:08] feel like that where Satan has tried
[1:24:10] everything. You look what he did with
[1:24:11] the Bible. The Bible was just has fought
[1:24:14] for so many years to keep the Bible out
[1:24:15] of the hands of the people. He did not
[1:24:18] want the people of the church to have
[1:24:19] the Bible. But he couldn't kill them off
[1:24:21] fast enough to keep the Bible out of
[1:24:22] their hands.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; So what'd he do? He's like, "Well, just
[1:24:25] forget this. Just give them all the
[1:24:27] Bibles they want until like the man, it
[1:24:30] was run over there and it was stinking
[1:24:31] in their noses and it was we've got
[1:24:33] Bibles laying around our house. Probably
[1:24:35] every house here has got Bibles laying
[1:24:36] around. You don't know what to do with
[1:24:37] it's too precious to go throw it away,
[1:24:39] but it's it's too old and and you can't
[1:24:41] really use it anymore. What do we do
[1:24:42] with it?" And we got it on our phones
[1:24:43] and our tablets and everywhere. So we're
[1:24:45] just over and what happens when that
[1:24:47] happens? It becomes common to us.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; You know, we can read it anytime we want
[1:24:51] to, anywhere we want to, any we can read
[1:24:54] the Bible.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; No other age had this. They had to go
[1:24:58] out of their way. They had to get out
[1:24:59] volumes of books to try to do the
[1:25:00] searches we can do in seconds.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Even AI and all these different things
[1:25:05] that that has has come out. You can sit
[1:25:07] there and search the Bible with it and
[1:25:08] you can find scriptures you can't hardly
[1:25:09] find for nothing just in seconds.
[1:25:12] You understand? And I got books in my
[1:25:14] office where that was there when I got
[1:25:16] there. There just volumes of books that
[1:25:18] people used to have to get them all out
[1:25:19] and spread them across. You probably
[1:25:21] remember some of those times. I I
[1:25:22] remember even, you know, dad having
[1:25:24] concordances is looking things up in the
[1:25:26] concordances.
[1:25:28] They had to work. They had to get they
[1:25:30] had to set their sideside their time.
[1:25:32] They had to put an effort in. And now
[1:25:34] it's just effortless and and common to
[1:25:36] us. and oh, we treasure it,
[1:25:40] but it's just so available.
[1:25:43] Let's don't let it become common to us.
[1:25:45] It's still thus sayeth the Lord. It is
[1:25:48] the scripture. It's the holy word of
[1:25:50] God. It is the absolute. It's the only
[1:25:52] thing that's going to remain.
[1:25:58] Those in the bride do only his will. No
[1:25:59] one can make them do otherwise. They
[1:26:01] have thus sayeth the Lord, or they keep
[1:26:03] still.
[1:26:05] You know, I used to think about that.
[1:26:06] What does that mean? You know, thus
[1:26:09] sayeth the Lord, honey, I love you. Thus
[1:26:11] say the Lord, son, go the yard. It's
[1:26:14] just like, what is that supposed to
[1:26:16] mean? How how are we going to do that?
[1:26:17] Thus say the Lord, we keep still. And
[1:26:20] begin to realize,
[1:26:22] you know, they come and they say, well,
[1:26:24] you know, I really think that, you know,
[1:26:25] I don't really think it's as big an
[1:26:27] issue as people made over this that I
[1:26:29] don't think God really cares so much
[1:26:31] about the outside. He really is just
[1:26:33] looking at the inside. But we can't thus
[1:26:36] sayeth the Lord that you can't say thus
[1:26:38] sayith the Lord. I only care about the
[1:26:40] inside. Don't worry about the outside.
[1:26:44] You can't. You say thus sayith the Lord,
[1:26:47] those that love me keep my commandments.
[1:26:50] And then you realize that that you got
[1:26:52] the spirit of Christ in you and you say,
[1:26:54] well, I have the spirit of Christ. I are
[1:26:55] filled with the Holy Ghost and yet the
[1:26:57] commandments are just kind of okay with
[1:26:58] me. I don't, you know, it what's on the
[1:27:00] outside really isn't so important. Wait
[1:27:02] a minute. The outside is a reflection of
[1:27:04] the inside. And that's God reflecting
[1:27:06] that image on the outside.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; We know thus sayeth the Lord. We need to
[1:27:13] know God said
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; that a woman ought not to wear a man
[1:27:17] garments that pertain to a man. That was
[1:27:20] his word. That's thus sayith the Lord.
[1:27:21] We can speak that. And they say, well,
[1:27:23] you know, I don't think this actually
[1:27:24] fits in that cate. Well, I'll just keep
[1:27:26] still.
[1:27:28] So, well, you know, when we when we you
[1:27:30] know, the church ought to be out doing
[1:27:31] this and that and Well, you know, the
[1:27:33] Bible says this, and to me, that's thus
[1:27:35] the the Lord. So, as far as that goes,
[1:27:38] you know, you want to do that, I'll just
[1:27:39] have to keep still.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; She knows that for it was not time yet
[1:27:45] for him to do certain things he must now
[1:27:48] do. But he will now fulfill through the
[1:27:51] bride that work which he left for a
[1:27:54] specific time.
[1:27:59] St. John 10:17 and 18
[1:28:06] Jesus says, "Therefore doth my father
[1:28:07] love me because I lay down my life that
[1:28:11] I might take it up again. No man taketh
[1:28:14] it from me, but I lay it down of myself.
[1:28:17] I have power to lay it down. I have
[1:28:19] power to take it again. This commandment
[1:28:22] have I received of my father."
[1:28:25] Boy, we think about, you know, as
[1:28:26] Christians and having the Holy Spirit
[1:28:28] dwelling in us. And it's Christ and all
[1:28:30] that Christ was, he is in has poured
[1:28:32] into the believers. And these scriptures
[1:28:34] like this, we just, you know, they're
[1:28:35] they're they're very precious to us,
[1:28:37] very dear to us. They they comfort us
[1:28:40] through our hard times. They give us
[1:28:41] strength when we're weak. And and that's
[1:28:43] exactly what they're supposed to do. But
[1:28:45] sometimes it's easy to to overlook
[1:28:48] certain things. And and he said here, he
[1:28:50] said, "Because I lay down my life that I
[1:28:52] might take it up again." We appreciate
[1:28:53] that. Go. God laid down his life and
[1:28:55] everything, but he says, "I have power
[1:28:57] to lay it down, and I have power to take
[1:28:59] it up again." And it's easy to grab that
[1:29:02] and say, you know, man, he had power to
[1:29:03] raise the dead. He could raise the dead.
[1:29:06] We have power in us to raise the dead.
[1:29:10] And that's exciting to the believer
[1:29:11] because we know that if if somebody, you
[1:29:13] know, Satan comes and he tries to take
[1:29:15] someone before their time, God will
[1:29:16] speak out, "Thus sayeth the Lord, that
[1:29:18] person's got to come back. We have power
[1:29:21] to take that life up again.
[1:29:24] But let's don't forget, he said, "I have
[1:29:26] power to lay it down."
[1:29:30] That's just as important as the power to
[1:29:32] take it up. Do we have the power to lay
[1:29:37] it down? We want the power to take it
[1:29:39] up, but we need the power to lay it
[1:29:41] down.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, go die so we can raise
[1:29:45] ourselves." No. Paul said he died daily.
[1:29:48] He had to die to the flesh.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; We need that power to lay it down.
[1:29:52] Again, we meet somebody on the parking
[1:29:53] lot and and they come and confronting
[1:29:55] us. Do we have the power to lay it down?
[1:30:00] When God begins to convict us of
[1:30:01] something in our life and and we've been
[1:30:03] serving the Lord all these years and
[1:30:04] I've never felt like this was wrong and
[1:30:06] preachers preached against it, but I
[1:30:08] could I never I never had a conviction
[1:30:10] against this, but now there's something
[1:30:11] at me and I'm struggling with it in
[1:30:12] there. Do you have power to lay your
[1:30:14] life down?
[1:30:16] I said, "Well, you you you can't show me
[1:30:17] that in the word, but where's your
[1:30:19] attitude coming from?
[1:30:21] What is that in you that's that's
[1:30:22] pushing against that? Is that God
[1:30:24] pushing against that?
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Examine the spirits and pay attention
[1:30:28] and do you have the power to lay that
[1:30:30] thing down and say, you know what, I've
[1:30:33] always done this and I've always felt
[1:30:34] checked and I never could write see it,
[1:30:36] you know, but something's convicting me
[1:30:38] on this. Something's telling me I ought
[1:30:40] to stop doing this or something tells me
[1:30:42] I really should be doing this. You got
[1:30:45] the power to lay it down
[1:30:47] because we got to have the power to lay
[1:30:49] it down if we want the power to take it
[1:30:51] up again.
[1:30:54] You see now that we cannot afford to say
[1:30:57] what the Bible has not said. When the
[1:30:59] scripture teaches us that the work of
[1:31:00] the Holy Spirit and the manifestations
[1:31:02] of the blessed person is to bring the
[1:31:04] truth of each age to the true seed of
[1:31:07] that age, then we know that the spirit
[1:31:09] has to be abiding in the person or he
[1:31:11] cannot receive the truth for that time.
[1:31:14] Amen. Because the the the Holy Spirit,
[1:31:16] you know, it it's
[1:31:18] the author of the book.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; And so if he's the author of the book,
[1:31:22] he's the only one that can be trusted to
[1:31:24] teach us the book.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; And so people now, you know, they say,
[1:31:28] "Well, you know, I don't need a prophet.
[1:31:29] I don't believe in no prophet, you know,
[1:31:31] and you guys are just in a cult and all
[1:31:33] this and and I got close friends that,
[1:31:35] you know, they kind of scoff at me and
[1:31:36] stuff and, well, you're just following a
[1:31:38] man." And it's like, well, okay, you
[1:31:39] need nobody but Christ, right? Well,
[1:31:41] what are you going to church for? Well,
[1:31:43] you wasting your time for it. Just go
[1:31:44] let God speak to you. But the Bible says
[1:31:46] to assemble yourselves together. So, how
[1:31:48] are you going to obey the word and and
[1:31:49] serve Christ and and not have any other
[1:31:52] man involved?
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; We're going to reject all the other men.
[1:31:57] We just need Christ. Okay? So, let's
[1:31:59] don't listen to Luke anymore or Mark or
[1:32:01] Matthew or
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; was that them or was that God?
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Is it your pastor or is it God?
[1:32:11] Well, we that have a revelation
[1:32:13] understand this word is God.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; So, what it really means when you boil
[1:32:20] it down, if you're walking down the road
[1:32:23] and there's some woman looks like a
[1:32:24] prostitute standing on the corner there
[1:32:26] and you look over and and you you take a
[1:32:29] second glance, you know, and she calls
[1:32:31] you out on it. You're supposed to be a
[1:32:32] Christian. You're acting like that.
[1:32:35] Well, the flesh wants to turn and just
[1:32:36] give her the word. We're got thus say
[1:32:38] the Lord. Lady, you're going to listen
[1:32:40] here right now. You're going to tell me
[1:32:42] about being a Christian.
[1:32:44] You're going to dress like that and
[1:32:45] stand on the corner and you're going to
[1:32:46] tell me that I'm not a Oh, you don't
[1:32:49] even understand.
[1:32:50] You don't even We're going to lay it
[1:32:53] down. We got to recognize that when she
[1:32:56] quotes the scripture and she says that
[1:32:58] if you look on a woman to lust and
[1:32:59] you've committed adultery in her heart
[1:33:01] and she tells you that, then you you
[1:33:02] have no choice but to say, you know
[1:33:04] what, that's the word of God. just
[1:33:06] because it come from her lips.
[1:33:10] All you can do is say, "You know what?
[1:33:11] You're absolutely right. That's the word
[1:33:13] of God. I am a Christian. And I have
[1:33:16] broken the word of God here. You're
[1:33:20] right. I had no right to do that. I'm
[1:33:23] sorry that I set a bad example before
[1:33:26] you. I'm sorry that I did not hold my
[1:33:29] position as a son of God.
[1:33:32] I made a mistake. and I'm sorry that you
[1:33:35] saw me make that mistake. Forgive me.
[1:33:38] Are you a Christian?
[1:33:40] You seem to know something about the
[1:33:41] word. Maybe that's an opportunity. But
[1:33:43] if we just want to sit there and throw
[1:33:44] her and tell her how bad she is to prove
[1:33:46] that we're okay, we're in the filthy
[1:33:49] rags that she's in.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; The word is the word. And it it doesn't
[1:33:53] matter where it comes from. When the
[1:33:55] word is spoken, we have to to recognize
[1:33:59] we're going to say amen. You was in the
[1:34:02] wrong spirit.
[1:34:04] I don't stand for that spirit, but I
[1:34:05] stand for that word.
[1:34:12] The spirit has to be abiding in that
[1:34:14] person or he cannot receive the truth
[1:34:16] for that time. Amen. That's exactly
[1:34:18] correct. We need that Holy Ghost inside
[1:34:21] of us to teach us these things in the
[1:34:23] scripture, his word. He will quicken it
[1:34:25] to our hearts. He will bring us the
[1:34:27] revelation of it and show us. Why? Why
[1:34:29] do people get so so
[1:34:32] defensive about spiritual revelation?
[1:34:34] I've talked to people and they just, oh,
[1:34:36] you can't, you know, spiritual
[1:34:37] revelation. Well, you know, I know this
[1:34:38] guy over here, he got this revelation
[1:34:40] and this guy got which one's right? The
[1:34:43] word.
[1:34:44] It's simple. It's the word, you know.
[1:34:47] Well, one got a revelation that it's
[1:34:48] it's free will and there's no need to,
[1:34:51] you know, to even read the word elect.
[1:34:52] We can just take that scripture out.
[1:34:54] That scripture is not even in there
[1:34:55] because it's not election. It's free
[1:34:57] will.
[1:34:58] He got that revelation and the other guy
[1:35:01] got a revelation. Well, there's no free
[1:35:02] will. There's it's all only in God's
[1:35:04] choosing. It's only an election. So, so
[1:35:06] you know, there's no need to even
[1:35:07] evangelize because it's all an election.
[1:35:08] Which one's right? The word.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; By fornowledge of your free will, God
[1:35:14] elected you before the foundation of the
[1:35:16] world.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; So, both of them have a little bit of
[1:35:20] truth and they're fighting each other
[1:35:22] with it instead of fighting the enemy
[1:35:23] and and getting before God and the Holy
[1:35:25] Spirit coming. So, the word is right. it
[1:35:27] wins again.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; But it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:35:32] recognize the word
[1:35:35] and and and if we don't have spiritual
[1:35:37] revelation if we can't receive it
[1:35:38] spiritual revelation, then it's going to
[1:35:41] have to be our own interpretation.
[1:35:44] So, you're going to tell me that you're
[1:35:45] more reliable and understanding this
[1:35:47] word and translating it and and and then
[1:35:49] the Holy Spirit?
[1:35:52] I don't care how many false $100 bills
[1:35:53] they pass around. You'll still go out
[1:35:56] and throw them in the trash and go look
[1:35:57] for, you know, you you'll still receive
[1:35:58] a real one. It don't matter how many
[1:36:01] people come in the name of the Lord with
[1:36:02] this revelation and that revelation.
[1:36:04] There's still a true spirit revelation.
[1:36:08] It'll go back in Genesis. It'll line up
[1:36:10] perfectly. It'll come all the way over
[1:36:11] here in Revelation. It'll line up
[1:36:13] perfectly.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; It won't bring any contradictions.
[1:36:17] It'll bring unity all the way through
[1:36:19] the word. then you've got a real true
[1:36:21] revelation from God.
[1:36:24] That's what we have need of.
[1:36:27] And that's what he's saying here that
[1:36:28] that it it takes the spirit in that
[1:36:30] person to receive the truth. Now before
[1:36:33] we leave this subject, I want to make
[1:36:34] myself very clear on what the baptism of
[1:36:36] the Holy Ghost is according to the word.
[1:36:37] It is not according to me, is not
[1:36:39] according to you. It has to be according
[1:36:41] to thus sayeth the Lord or we are
[1:36:43] falsely led. Amen.
[1:36:46] So if they would have if if if if they
[1:36:49] could have understood this back years
[1:36:51] ago when they begin to go off into the
[1:36:54] tongues as a manifestation and so forth,
[1:36:56] if if they would have understood that
[1:36:58] well have thus said the Lord or we keep
[1:36:59] still and they say okay tonesues is the
[1:37:01] evidence they they spoke in tongues. Is
[1:37:02] it thus say the Lord? Well it says they
[1:37:05] spoke in tongues they received the Holy
[1:37:06] Ghost.
[1:37:08] But is it all the way through? Thus say
[1:37:09] the Lord. Paul said, "If I speak with
[1:37:12] tongues of men and angels and I have not
[1:37:14] charity, it's nothing." So indeed, we
[1:37:17] can speak with tongues of men and
[1:37:18] angels, it be nothing. So somewhere we
[1:37:22] have a problem. It can't be thus sayeth
[1:37:23] the Lord. And all these different
[1:37:26] doctrines, you know, well, you know,
[1:37:27] we're we we just we want to keep the
[1:37:29] word pure, so we're just going to get us
[1:37:30] a recorder. We're going to hit play.
[1:37:33] Thus sayith the Lord. No. No. I have
[1:37:37] thus say the Lord, preach the word. Paul
[1:37:41] told Timothy and I can put my name there
[1:37:44] more than one way.
[1:37:47] But he said, "Preach the word. Be
[1:37:49] instant." Instant. Where did that
[1:37:50] change?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; It didn't change in here. It didn't I
[1:37:55] can't find that in my Bible. It don't
[1:37:56] run all the way through.
[1:37:58] We need thus say the Lord.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Genesis to Revelation all the way
[1:38:04] through.
[1:38:08] But in the beginning was the word and
[1:38:10] the word was with God and the word was
[1:38:11] God and the word was made flesh and
[1:38:13] dwelt among us the same yesterday today
[1:38:16] and forever. This is what our judgment
[1:38:19] comes from the Bible. So let's solemnly
[1:38:21] believe every word.
[1:38:24] And I've said that genuine bornagain
[1:38:26] experience will punctuate every promise
[1:38:28] of God with amen.
[1:38:31] They won't try to say well that was for
[1:38:33] another day or that isn't for us. The
[1:38:36] Holy Ghost was for people back in
[1:38:38] another day. No. Peter said the day of
[1:38:41] Pentecost, "This promise is unto you, to
[1:38:43] your children, to them that's a far off,
[1:38:45] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:38:47] call."
[1:38:51] You know, when you when you look at
[1:38:52] these things, again, we kind of hit on
[1:38:53] this a little bit, but when you really
[1:38:55] look at these things that they say,
[1:38:56] "Well, you know, that was for another
[1:38:57] day." And they they explain that away. I
[1:38:59] I heard some say, you know, that uh the
[1:39:02] the church ages, you know, it's to the
[1:39:05] church at at Ephesus. Well, don't you
[1:39:07] understand that this church was actually
[1:39:09] a literal church in Asia that was at
[1:39:12] Ephesus.
[1:39:14] That's not to us. That was to a church
[1:39:16] at Ephesus. You know, why are we trying
[1:39:18] to make something out of that? The
[1:39:20] church at Leodysia was not us. It was
[1:39:22] the church in Asia in Leodysia. These
[1:39:25] are literal churches, people.
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:30] Romans. That was a literal church.
[1:39:33] Not to me. I'm not in the church at
[1:39:36] Rome. I'm not in the church at Corenth.
[1:39:39] I'm not in the church at at
[1:39:42] Galatia.
[1:39:44] We're here in 2025. So, you know, there
[1:39:47] illustration about the little boy that
[1:39:49] uh he come to his pastor and he would
[1:39:51] ask some questions about the Bible. And
[1:39:52] he said, "Well, son, son, do you have a
[1:39:54] Bible?" And he said, "Yeah." I said,
[1:39:55] "Right here." He said, "What? Wait a
[1:39:58] minute. Let me see that. That book's
[1:40:00] just about a thin. I've never seen a
[1:40:02] Bible that thin. There's hardly nothing
[1:40:03] to it. He said, "Look here, son. Look at
[1:40:05] my This is my Bible." He said, "This
[1:40:06] thing's huge." Like, look at it compared
[1:40:08] to yours. How can that be the Bible? And
[1:40:09] he said, "Oh, mine looked just like
[1:40:11] yours when I got it." He said, "But then
[1:40:14] you said that this wasn't wasn't any
[1:40:15] good anymore, and that wasn't any good
[1:40:16] anymore, so I just tore it out and this
[1:40:17] is what I got left."
[1:40:20] That's where we're at.
[1:40:22] Again, you know, if we want to say,
[1:40:24] "Well, that was that was Old Testament.
[1:40:25] That was that was Old Testament law.
[1:40:29] We got confidence in God or not?
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; We got confidence in the one that
[1:40:33] created the heavens and the earth.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Your car breaks down, would you drive it
[1:40:37] up to the dealership and and get get the
[1:40:40] guy that designed that car to come out
[1:40:41] there and talk to you and you tell them,
[1:40:43] "No, no, no, no, no. Listen, listen. No.
[1:40:45] I want to tell you something. We live in
[1:40:47] an age where that's that's about the
[1:40:49] case. You go to the doctor anymore. I
[1:40:51] wouldn't want to be a doctor today.
[1:40:53] Everybody that comes in there, they done
[1:40:55] googled everything. They know exactly
[1:40:56] what's wrong with them. All they want
[1:40:58] you to do is sit down in pull up a chair
[1:40:59] and listen. Doctor, I don't need you.
[1:41:01] I'll just tell you everything that's
[1:41:02] wrong and and what I Can you imagine
[1:41:05] that? You go to school, you learn all
[1:41:06] the medicine, all these things, and then
[1:41:08] you go in there and everybody's a
[1:41:09] know-it-all and everybody know. How
[1:41:12] would that be? What does God feel like
[1:41:13] when we we come up with these things?
[1:41:15] And the bride doesn't The bride doesn't
[1:41:19] do that. We But
[1:41:22] I'm thankful that we understand that
[1:41:24] from Genesis to Revelation is inspired
[1:41:27] word of God. Christ is the word.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Christ is the word. If there's something
[1:41:34] in here, I've said it before, the
[1:41:36] genealogies.
[1:41:38] Well, I remember we was kids, we'd have
[1:41:39] devotions and we'd read through the
[1:41:40] Bible and we get to them genealogies. Oh
[1:41:42] Lord, it just seemed like it's so long.
[1:41:44] Which was the son of? And try to
[1:41:47] pronounce it. Which was the son of? And
[1:41:48] mom and dad wouldn't skip them. We read
[1:41:50] through them, which was the son of, you
[1:41:52] know, and and it just it seems like, you
[1:41:54] know, honestly, if we would just be real
[1:41:56] plain and honest, it's like, God, why
[1:41:58] did you put those in there? Did you just
[1:42:01] want to challenge our reading or
[1:42:04] But he's the God that spoke the worlds
[1:42:07] into existence. The solar system is my
[1:42:10] to my knowledge is the only perfect time
[1:42:13] piece we have. We cannot duplicate it.
[1:42:16] We cannot recreate something. The sun is
[1:42:19] a light that that that no one to this
[1:42:21] day I I this is my opinion. If if we
[1:42:25] could equal the sun, we would be
[1:42:27] destroyed.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; That's my thoughts. But he said, "Let
[1:42:32] there be light." And he put the sun in
[1:42:34] the in the sky. And to this day, man's
[1:42:36] greatest lights that we're just blows
[1:42:38] your mind to see the light nowadays. You
[1:42:41] go to the ball field or something and
[1:42:42] they got them big stadium lights up and
[1:42:45] you think, man, it's just as bright as
[1:42:46] day in here. It's just as bright. You
[1:42:48] can see everything. There's no It's just
[1:42:50] It's It's incredible.
[1:42:52] Go back in the day. Those lights that
[1:42:55] you couldn't look up. You see, oh my why
[1:42:57] are they got them things so bright, man?
[1:42:58] It's I tell you what, it's And you go in
[1:43:00] there in the day, you're like, I think
[1:43:02] they're on. Well, let's step over here
[1:43:03] and make sure. Yeah. Yeah, they're on.
[1:43:07] You ever think about that? What? The sun
[1:43:10] is so much brighter. The sun is so much
[1:43:13] more of a perfect light.
[1:43:16] Why? Because God knows what he's doing.
[1:43:20] God knows how to do those things. He
[1:43:21] knew the distance to set it away from
[1:43:23] the earth where it would it would, you
[1:43:24] know,
[1:43:27] but then I got enough confidence if he
[1:43:30] could do that, he can put genealogies in
[1:43:33] the Bible
[1:43:34] and when the spirit moves on someone,
[1:43:36] they can go into those genealogies and
[1:43:38] they can pull out an inspired sermon
[1:43:41] that can minister to your heart and
[1:43:42] you're like,
[1:43:44] "How did they do that? How did that,
[1:43:47] man? I've never seen that. I would have
[1:43:49] never thought that was pos. I ain't I
[1:43:51] can't do that this morning. I'm sorry.
[1:43:53] But they're there for a purpose.
[1:43:56] I heard a motivational speaker and they
[1:43:58] could come to the music, but I heard a
[1:44:01] motivational speaker. I think his name
[1:44:02] was Simon Synynic and and he was given
[1:44:05] an account of a trip that he took over
[1:44:07] to uh Middle East somewhere. And he
[1:44:10] didn't tell anybody he was going because
[1:44:11] it's so dangerous. it was a time of war
[1:44:13] in Afghanistan or somewhere where he
[1:44:15] went and uh he he went told him he was
[1:44:19] going to a certain part but he went on
[1:44:21] from there and went on over to to this
[1:44:23] country and it was very very dangerous
[1:44:24] and and uh so he was trying to do this
[1:44:28] in covert you know and not not let
[1:44:30] anybody know and he gets over there and
[1:44:32] and he said as soon as I get on the
[1:44:33] ground there's this missile siren's
[1:44:35] going off they had to take cover the
[1:44:38] whole time he's there it's this way and
[1:44:39] and so um then they get ready to try to
[1:44:42] leave and they can't get out of there.
[1:44:44] He has no cell phone service. Nobody
[1:44:46] knows where he's at. He can't, you know,
[1:44:47] he's just stuck. And it started getting
[1:44:50] to his head and he started thinking
[1:44:52] about all the the
[1:44:55] speeches that he's made, all the advice
[1:44:57] that he's given, all these things and
[1:44:59] and trying to incorporate all his
[1:45:01] principles that he's taught and how to
[1:45:03] deal with stress and how to to make it
[1:45:06] through these certain kind of
[1:45:07] circumstances and all these different
[1:45:08] things.
[1:45:11] but it's still getting to him. It's
[1:45:14] still something greater than all his
[1:45:16] psychology or whatever that's called
[1:45:19] could handle.
[1:45:21] And I thought, you know what, Lord? I
[1:45:24] would take one chapter of your Bible,
[1:45:26] one verse, even if it come from the
[1:45:29] genealogies
[1:45:32] before I would take the words of these
[1:45:34] men of the motivational speakers and all
[1:45:36] these things because that one verse or
[1:45:38] one chapter is the inspired, infallible
[1:45:42] word of God.
[1:45:45] And if I can put my faith in that verse,
[1:45:48] say, "Lord, I don't have a clue what it
[1:45:49] means.
[1:45:52] He can quicken that to my heart. He can
[1:45:54] give me strength through that verse,
[1:45:56] though it seems to this world like it
[1:45:59] shouldn't even be there.
[1:46:02] You know, there's people that look at
[1:46:03] the message and they say, "Well, you
[1:46:06] know, that was his opinion now, and that
[1:46:08] was, you know, everything he said was
[1:46:09] thus sayith the Lord." Or everything he
[1:46:11] said wasn't thus say. You got to know
[1:46:12] where his opinion is, and all you got to
[1:46:14] know.
[1:46:17] You need the Holy Ghost.
[1:46:19] You need the Holy Ghost because
[1:46:22] Paul said some things and he was he told
[1:46:24] us he said this is just my opinion.
[1:46:28] But you ever think about that when you
[1:46:30] go over and you read that the rest say I
[1:46:32] not the Lord.
[1:46:34] Okay. So we don't really I it's not
[1:46:37] vital. It's that was just Paul.
[1:46:40] Where do you read that at?
[1:46:44] Is it the word of God or not?
[1:46:46] Is it just Paul's idea or is it
[1:46:49] It made it in my Bible. Did Paul put it
[1:46:52] there or did he say
[1:46:56] this is just my thoughts on it? And God
[1:46:58] said, "Amen." Put it in there. This is
[1:47:01] my word too, Paul. That inspiration come
[1:47:04] from me, Paul. Then he said, "If any man
[1:47:08] thinks himself spiritual, let him wait."
[1:47:11] That don't mean just the parts that was
[1:47:13] inspired. That means every word of it.
[1:47:16] Because again, he said it was his
[1:47:18] thoughts, but it's in the word. So it's
[1:47:21] no longer just his thoughts on it. He
[1:47:24] said, "Well, you saying that every word
[1:47:25] in the message, every word, brother B
[1:47:27] said, no, I'm saying you need the Holy
[1:47:29] Ghost." And you try to read it in a
[1:47:31] carnal understanding. You take the
[1:47:33] scriptures, you'll get all tangled up.
[1:47:36] The flesh and blood doesn't have any way
[1:47:37] to to discern these things. It takes the
[1:47:41] spirit of Christ to bring these things
[1:47:44] to life to us.
[1:47:46] Amen. I pray that something was said and
[1:47:49] and and it would encourage you.
[1:47:52] [Applause]
[1:47:58] When he said, "Thus sayeth the Lord, as
[1:47:59] she keeps still," that doesn't mean that
[1:48:03] we're going to be some big super
[1:48:04] spiritual supernatural
[1:48:08] people that just walks around with our
[1:48:10] chest out. No, it wasn't just to the
[1:48:14] preachers. It's not just to the big
[1:48:16] shot. It's to these young people right
[1:48:18] across the front row here.
[1:48:21] They'll have the wisdom, the spirit of
[1:48:22] Christ in them, we'll we'll speak
[1:48:24] through their lips and and when it's
[1:48:25] something that an uncertain sound comes
[1:48:27] along,
[1:48:29] say, you know, I just got to keep still
[1:48:30] on that
[1:48:32] because if they don't have, thus say the
[1:48:33] Lord, if they can't take it back and put
[1:48:35] it right out of these scriptures, say,
[1:48:37] well, I'm just going to leave that
[1:48:38] alone. you you you got to do what you
[1:48:39] got to do on that. But for me, this is
[1:48:42] what the scripture said.
[1:48:44] Maybe it's, you know, let's go do this.
[1:48:47] Well, my my Bible says, "Honor your
[1:48:50] father and mother." My mom and dad said,
[1:48:51] "I don't need to do that." And so
[1:48:53] whether or not you think the scriptures
[1:48:54] is is honor your father and mother, thus
[1:48:58] sayith the Lord, I'm not going to go
[1:48:59] against what they told me to do. So you
[1:49:03] you do what you want to do, but this is
[1:49:04] thus sayith the Lord. Honor your father
[1:49:07] and mother. Dad said don't do it. Mom
[1:49:08] said don't do it. They told me that I
[1:49:10] need to do this. And so I don't see what
[1:49:14] I'm saying. It's it's for all of us. And
[1:49:17] it's not some big worked up something.
[1:49:18] It's not something throw our chest out.
[1:49:21] It really comes back to Enoch.
[1:49:24] He walked with God.
[1:49:26] Walk with God. Go eat the book. It's
[1:49:29] still open. We still have it. Eat that
[1:49:33] book. Feast on that book and it will it
[1:49:37] will change you. It will open the will
[1:49:38] of God to you and it will transform your
[1:49:41] life. It'll take you out of here. That's
[1:49:43] what it'll do for you.
[1:49:45] If we can just have a word of prayer,
[1:49:49] our gracious heavenly father,
[1:49:51] Lord,
[1:49:53] we thank you for your word, Lord Jesus.
[1:49:56] We thank you for this spirit, Lord, to
[1:49:58] to quicken your word to us, Lord.
[1:50:02] God, that you've brought it back, Lord,
[1:50:04] when when Satan had sent all kinds of
[1:50:06] men to try to tangle it all up and and
[1:50:09] make creeds out of it and make dogmas
[1:50:11] and things, Lord. But God, you come and
[1:50:13] you sent a man that was just simple
[1:50:15] enough to believe you, Lord. God, may I
[1:50:18] echo those words, Lord, that be it unto
[1:50:20] me, Lord. The parts I don't understand,
[1:50:23] Lord, it's it's you, God.
[1:50:26] Lord, I know you understand them.
[1:50:28] There's no confusion in it to you, Lord.
[1:50:31] God, help me just to shut my life down,
[1:50:33] Lord. And let this the desires of the
[1:50:35] flesh and all the cares of life, Lord,
[1:50:39] let it go to the wayside, Lord,
[1:50:42] and let your word become the first and
[1:50:44] foremost thing in my life, Lord,
[1:50:48] till we become one, Lord Jesus.
[1:50:52] Lord, I pray that you'll bless each and
[1:50:53] every heart here, Lord. If I've said
[1:50:55] something in error, Lord, God, may it be
[1:50:57] corrected, Lord.
[1:50:59] God, would I pray, Father, go with your
[1:51:02] people, Lord. Encourage them, Lord. Lift
[1:51:03] their spirits. Lift the feeble hands.
[1:51:06] Heal the ones that are sick, Lord.
[1:51:08] Encourage the discouraged, Lord. And
[1:51:11] we love you, Lord. We praise you in
[1:51:13] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:51:18] We turn it back to brother Wendle. I'll
[1:51:20] just share this little thought with you.
[1:51:22] I just realized the other day is
[1:51:24] thinking on this the the spirit and the
[1:51:26] the flesh and the you know discerning
[1:51:29] between you know what what's to the
[1:51:30] spirit and what's to the flesh you know
[1:51:32] and
[1:51:34] and it's we we get so many cares of life
[1:51:37] we get so many so many trials and tests
[1:51:40] and things you know we get we get weary
[1:51:42] sometimes and and I begin to think about
[1:51:44] you know what what is it that's so
[1:51:48] worrisome to me you know if I would make
[1:51:50] a list and just write down the top five
[1:51:53] things that are really weighing me down,
[1:51:56] you know, like Lord, I just need you to
[1:51:57] move on these things right here. These
[1:51:59] are top priority to me.
[1:52:03] And let's take the list and let's look
[1:52:05] at them.
[1:52:06] You know, the car, the job, the the
[1:52:10] neighbor, you know, whatever. And then
[1:52:11] look at your list. You can do this. Just
[1:52:14] think of these things in your mind. What
[1:52:15] are the top five things or 10 or
[1:52:17] whatever, but what are the things that
[1:52:19] are the the hardest battles you're
[1:52:21] fighting right now? The the top priority
[1:52:23] things that you would if God would just
[1:52:25] say, you know, that that I I want to
[1:52:27] know what your what your pri what are
[1:52:29] they? And I began to realize that my
[1:52:32] list was pertain to the flesh. Pertain
[1:52:36] to the flesh. It pertains to the flesh.
[1:52:40] I realized that the very most important
[1:52:42] things in life wasn't even on that top
[1:52:44] five list. There wasn't nothing on there
[1:52:47] about Lord, I want to win a soul. Lord,
[1:52:50] I want to see the lost brought to you. I
[1:52:54] want to see my lost loved ones. Those
[1:52:56] are on my priorities. But why are they
[1:52:58] the first things that come to mind?
[1:53:01] All pertain to the flesh when these
[1:53:03] things are the true things that really
[1:53:05] have a value. and they really are the
[1:53:07] things that matter, the eternal things
[1:53:11] and yet they didn't come up.
[1:53:14] It really shook me. Say, God, I need to
[1:53:16] get some priority. I need to get some
[1:53:18] prioritizing here. I need to I need to
[1:53:21] change some things. Lord, help me. Lord,
[1:53:23] change me. And now when there's things
[1:53:25] that comes up and and and it's like,
[1:53:27] Lord, help me realize this is just flesh
[1:53:29] and blood. This is not affecting the
[1:53:32] spirit. Help me discern what's a word
[1:53:35] the spirit man needs.
[1:53:37] God bless you.
