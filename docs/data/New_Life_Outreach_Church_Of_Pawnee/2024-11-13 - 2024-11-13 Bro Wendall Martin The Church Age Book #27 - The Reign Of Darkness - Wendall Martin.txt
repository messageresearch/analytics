to hear about their home and uh you know I know the pressure it took off me just just hearing that and and so I I know it took pressure off them and so uh and and the Lord really it's the Lord really uh done a wonderful work for them to get that and so um U I'm not going to tell his their testimony we'll wait till Sunday amen but uh I want to say happy birthday to brother Michael his birthday was yesterday and um uh so we we sure do appreciate uh brother Michael and you know as I I was thinking yesterday is uh on his birthday and I thought you know he and Sister Amy and their their family you know it wasn't it wasn't too it wasn't too many moons ago and it was me and brother Mur raising our families you know and uh and now to's see uh this this next Generation coming up and see these these U men and women brothers and sisters that are raising their families it just really really makes me proud amen sister Denise it's good to see you tonight amen oh my I've been missing you and um so uh we appreciate appreciate our sister Denise let let's look here at at Revelations the the 2 chapter the 20th verse uh good to see sister Carol made it back from South Dakota and and you're still walking this is good and uh we we uh uh I tell you what that sister Carol she's she's a go-getter and U um we want to we want to keep sister Joe fiser in our prayers um she she got she went shopping yesterday with with um another sister and and it was you know it was just a good time for the both of them needed to to to have a just get out and enjoy themselves and and um well sister Joe fell and um and so um and and she fell good and so that that one arm that that she's not been able or that that she's that she's favored since the this since she has uh uh you know had that accident um you know she's not been able to use that but when she fell she had put her arm out and um and and then her weight hitting that thing it raised that arm up all the way over and and it is uh and she is just she she has a she has a a a fracture uh there in her shoulder but it's one of those type deals that really they can't do any surgery on it'll heal itself but um you know we're thinking that she's could have pulled some muscle and ligament and and so let's let's remember Sister Joe in our prayers and you know the devil always tries to take something good and make it turn it into bad and um so as as we go uh before we go to uh reading the scripture let's let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for for your love tonight your blessings upon us and we're asking Lord that your Holy Spirit would would just be uh be be king tonight that you would be Lord over our service and that you would have your way Among Us Lord I pray that your anointing would would be among us Lord Jesus and that your presence would be felt by us all just ask Lord that you would see our sister Joe Fisher Lord it was so good to have her here in pawy and and Lord uh we we just all love her father and I I'm just asking that you would be there with her and that you would help her and heal her Lord God I just ask that you would help her to recover you recover Lord without a a lot of pain and you'd give her full restoration of that arm father and Lord we just look to you tonight thank you for your presence Thank You for Your Love in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen Let's uh let's look here in the Book of Revelations the 20th chapter or or the second chapter I'm sorry and the 20th verse and um we're going to read down to the 27 second verse we've we've gone over these first uh two verses but um it it says not withstanding I have a few things against thee now this is this is talking to um the nominal Church there in thyra because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants and to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed un Idols I gave her a space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds let's go to the 23rd and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works amen God bless you you can be seated here tonight we um so we we want to um read a little bit tonight and we're not we're going to read a a few pages and then um and then we're going to uh end with with um 20 minutes or so of the Third Church age and uh we we'll play that now we're we're at a we're at a stage in in the um in in the church where we can understand where the Seven Seals come in now we've got the Seven Seals but there's only there there's there's only um the first second third fourth and the seventh seal that that is um that pertains to the church the fifth and the sixth seals are are tribulation seal and the uh and and which and has to do with the Jews but we so we are here we're we're at the th tyan Church age and so we've we've come we we have talked about how they've left the first love and how that they have come through but but now I want to bring on over into that the the black horse we had the under the SE uh uh under the seals first seal there was a white horse under the uh second seal there was a red horse under under the black or the the the third seal was a black horse under the fourth seal is a Pale Horse and of course this is the time that we're living in right now now as as we as we have talked about in the in in um as as Daniel saw the great colossal and and how that there was the image of gold then then then the silver and the brass and then down to the iron and then the mixed iron and clay and and we found that as that was uh if you look there at Daniel in the second chapter and in the 7th chapter you you find that there are there is the structure and then there is the powers behind it so we understand that there is a woman amen she is the great and then there is a power behind her and so it looks beautiful we see that through the two trees look a lot alike it looks like two churches it looks it looks very real they're both bearing fruit they're both Christians they're both they all sing they have altars they have all of these things here but the life or the power behind one tree is that of death it's that of the Antichrist and then you've got the power behind the the the the bride and and that is the power of Life which can only come from the word of God so you've got the tree of death and the tree of life now I know I I've got the tree of life bigger here but really it should be the tree of death the biggest because the tree of death seems to it it it seems to uh dwarf the tree of life but it's the Tree of Life that that God is interested in and so is as we look into the seals now amen because these four seals all come together there's happening uh uh uh there there's there's the good there's the righteous the spirit of God the Holy Ghost and then there's the spirit of the Antichrist it's the spirit of death and so while there is a satanic anointing here and that is anointing this tree there is also those four living creatures that are Before the Throne and y'all remember what the four living creatures were the first one was what a lion the second one a calf the third one uh a man and then the fourth one a flying eagle so so we have amen so a as we can see here uh uh we are we are at the breaking point if you notice this we are at the breaking point thyra is almost totally the the gospel is almost totally out the Roman Catholic Church is now has has now had a long Reign the black horse is is Darkness death it's she has she has squelched the word uh uh uh State and church has married and and now she is the ruler over the Kings she has taken over all of that and and so it has become quite she's she built up quite a monopoly amen but then of course thank God for a prophet amen because the prophet let us know that the one who introduced the black horse was the the the the living creature with a man's face uh intellect and that's when the reformers begin to come out Martin Luther came out with justification and sanctification through Wesley and then on up so so what we see here amen is is it it it seemed like the tree of life amen was down to a nub and the tree of death had taken over but God says I will restore and so we we want to look tonight I just wanted to uh uh uh sort of give you a uh you know uh and I love that quote did y'all anyone read that quote I sent today where brother bradam says justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and Incarnate Word believer oh my that just makes you feel really good amen that's right and and and he says in another place there in the spoken word he says it is justification sanctification he says he said justification made room for sanctification sanctification made room for the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost has made room for the Holy Ghost himself so we've had the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the word was coming the the the baptism of the Holy Ghost came in 1906 it made way for the opening of the word in 1963 y'all y'all see that now now that doesn't make it four stages it simply means this amen it means stage stage number Hallelujah stage number one stage number one made way for stage number two stage number three made way for the believer amen that God was looking for at the beginning amen right amen so we're not saying there's four stages or or we're not saying that the new birth is four stages but it consists of water blood spirit and then you've got then you've got yourself amen you've got a you've got a living baby and so this where the age we're living in right now is what God has been looking for all along the perfect word could not come in any of these other times it could not come until a prophet messenger come that was the eagle the e anointing to bring you and I Amen to our fullest potential that God's had in his mind from before the foundation of the world and don't you sell that word out don't you don't you look at that word in you and think that man you're just a little bit of nobody when God called you and ordained you amen and don't turn me all the way off now amen when God called you and ordained you to be a a a a Christian he called you to overcome amen he's called you and the only way you're going to overcome is with the word of the age right the word of the age so we overcome hallelujah amen the the lion Earthbound creature the calf Earthbound creature the man Earthbound creature but it didn't just say eagle it said flying eagle that's that's good because this is the rapturing season this is you going back to your inheritance that God's called you to in the beginning hallelujah it's Sons returning to the authority that God's called you to be that's what he's created you to be and and it's ironic that Satan has come in with with the with death amen and it's and it is it isn't it crazy that we're smarter now than we've ever been that that that we've got we've got so much at our fingertips and here we are right now amen in in this generation with more mind troubles there there there is more uh a mind mind disease uh uh uh mental illness is what I'm looking for amen they're saying one out of three in the world is suffering with mental illness the tree of death the the this this tree that is so big and that is so huge amen it it people are going insane right but here's the tree of life and the tree of life is going is taking you back to your original PL oh Hallelujah I said every devil should be under our feet every devil should be under our feet tonight and when that Old Devil tries to tell you that you're not a son of God you're not a daughter of God it's time for you to tell him his future amen his future the great and the fella that she committed adultery with are all going to be burnt that's what the scripture says they must be burnt all right let's look here now um and we're we're titling this um uh tonight's the reain of Darkness so let's let's look here at 232 page 232 and we're going to be down um to the second paragraph it says sentence against the Harlot past Revelations 222- 23 behold I will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works what this woman has children and she is a if that is the case uh that she had children by her whoredoms then she must be burnt with fire as the word is said that's exactly true that is her end for she will burn with fire her end is the Lake of Fire but stop and think about these children for a moment a woman is the one out of whom the children came it is evident that this woman had children that came out of her but they did the same thing she did show me one church that ever came out of organization that didn't go right back into it there isn't one not one Lutheran came out and then organized right back and today they are hand and glove with this ecumenical move the methodists came out and they organized right back the Pentecostals came out and they organized right back there is going to be another coming out and praise God they won't organize back because they know the truth why do they know the truth because the seal has taken the cover off the opening of the seals the lamb has come give that sent that open book to that seventh Church age messenger he's declared the truth you and I know what to look for he says that group will be the Bride of the last day now it it said here that this had children now what were they they were daughters they were churches just like her now here is a very interesting point Jezebel and Ahab had a daughter that daughter married jeroham uh U the son of Jehoshaphat and in 2 Kings 8:16 it says jehoram uh walked in the ways of his father-in-law he went right into idolatry by this marriage he brought God-fearing God worshipping Judah into idolatry and that is exactly what all these daughters churches have done even as I have pointed out to you you start in the truth and marry into organization leave the word for tradition Creeds Etc now let me get this across in Hebrews 13 and7 it says remember them that have the rule over you who have spoken to you the word of God it is the word that rules us not men now a man as a husband as a husband usband is head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word Jesus is the word if she rejects the word and takes another headship she is an adulteress now you name me one church that hasn't given up the word for traditions and Creeds they are all adulteresses like mother like daughter what will the punishment of the Harlot and her children well it's going to be twofold first he says I will cast her into a bed according to the last part of the verse 22 it will be a bed of tribulation or the Great Tribulation that is exactly what Jesus said in Matthew 25 1-13 there were 10 virgins five were wise five were foolish the five wise had oil the Holy Spirit the other five did not when the cry went up behold the Bri bridegroom cometh the the five foolish had to run seeking oil while while five wise virgins went into the marriage the five that remained outside were left to the Great Tribulation that that is what will happen to all who did not go up in the Rapture that is what will come upon the Harlot and her daughters secondly it says that he will kill them with death or as a literal translation says let them be put to death with death this is a strange saying we might say let a man be put to death by hanging or by electrocution or some other way but this says let them be put to death by death death itself is the cause of their death now I want you to see this clearly so I will take our illustration again of the daughter of Jezebel marrying into the house of Judah and there by bringing bringing it right into idolatry and causing God to deliver Judah to death what that is what balam did too so here was Jezebel with her paganism over there is Judah properly worshiping God and living under the word so Jezebel marries her daughter to jehoram the minute that happens jehoram causes the people to become idolators the minute that marriage took place Judah was dead spiritual death came in the minute the First Church of Rome organized it died the minute that the Lutheran organized death came in and they died Pentecostals come along last and they organized the spirit left though they don't believe it but he did that marriage brought death then the light of Oneness of the godhead came they organized and they died too then after the fire of God fell on the Ohio River 1933 a healing Revival swept the world and it never came through any organization God went outside the Pentecostal groups outside organization and what he is going to do in the future is going to be outside organization too God can't work through the dead he can only work through the living members somebody say he can only work only work through the living members those living members are outside of Babylon so you see death or organization came and the church died and to make it plainer death become a resident wherein shortly before only life reigned as the original Eve brought death to mankind so so now organization has brought death for organization is the product of the double corruptors nickan ISM and balonis propagated by The prophetess Jezebel Now Eve should have been burned along with a serpent for their awful deed but Adam intervened and taking her quickly to himself so that she was saved but when this satanic religion has gone the full course of the ages there will be no one to intervene she will be burned with her Seducer for the and her children and the Antichrist and Satan will all find their place in the L a fire right here I will be getting ahead of myself and maybe I ought to reserve this for the message on the last age but it seems like it just seems just right to put it in right now because it deals so clearly with organization and what it is going what's going to happen through it I want to warn you Revelations 13:1 And1 18 I stood up on the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and T horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the Beast was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power his seat great Authority I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who was able to make war with him there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 40 and two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle and them that dwell in in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear he that leadth into captivity shall go into captivity he that kth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the Saints and I beheld another Beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first Beast before him and causeth the Earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doth great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast now now that that second beast now remember the first Beast was Rome the second beast is the US is the USA and and and the Firepower and the all the Miracles in the skies those are were a superpower and uh we're a world leader and uh we we have our rockets and planes and we have all of those things and so but there is but there it says saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the womb by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast the image of the Beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed I want to stop right here again he's going to get into it but but U but we're not going to get that far into that tonight now remember there's the Beast then there's the image to the Beast right there is the Beast the Roman church and then there has been the organized church and then there is there is the image that has been raised up to the Beast and this is the World Council of churches these these denominational churches that have taken after their mother that are living amen and when you worship heard dogmas and take her Creeds and you you are doing nothing but you you're you're you're just the daughter of your mother y'all understanding so so brother brandom is fixing to show us here that uh um that the image there was the Beast and then here's the United States that helps make the image of the Beast solidify that and that's how that's how the man of sin is going to rule the world through that through that structure through that image it says um and he exercises all the power of the first beasts before him and csth the Earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly womb was healed this is the US turning his attention the world's attention to Rome and he doth great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven in the sight of men did I did I go backwards um well we we'll keep on going since I'm here the fire come down from heaven on in the sight of men deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of the Miracles by which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the womb by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast and the image of the Beast should speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and causeth all both small and great rich and poor free in bond to receive a mark in their right hand and in their foreheads that no man might bu cell save he that had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that ha uh let him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 6003 score and6 this chapter shows the power of the Roman Catholic church and what she will do through organization remember this is the false Vine let it name the name of the Lord it does so only in a lie its headship is not of the Lord but of Satan it finally ends up completely identified with the Beast the riding on the Scarlet Beast distin distinctly shows her power is the guard of God of force Satan and not our God the Lord Jesus Christ in verse 17 it emphatically shows that she will gain absolute control of the Commerce of the Earth for no man can buy or sell apart from her this is born out of Revelations 189 through 17 which shows her involvement with Kings princes Merchants all of whom have to do with Roman Commerce in Revelations 13:14 we learn that the Beast spreads his influence through the image which was built for him the image is made that is made is a worldwide ecumenical council wherein all the organized churches will get together with the Roman Catholics they're doing it even now and it is quite possible this Union will come in order to stop the power of Communism but since communism like Nebuchadnezzar has been raised up to burn the Flesh of the Harlot Rome will be overcome and destroyed take note that everywhere romanist the romanist church went communism followed it has to be that way let me warn you now don't get thinking communism is your only enemy no sir it is the Catholic Church also and even more so amen so so we can we can see where where the uh uh where where we are that that that Catholic church now I want us to listen how many are we doing okay so far now I want us to listen to the third seal and and um so uh sister keys if you can put that uh put put that on there and as I say this is going to be um uh 20 minutes or so uh of the of the third seal and and um and brother brandom's going to be bringing it in tying it in with the church church ages so here we go third horse First Church Hy why the nians had a Doctrine see this the first one all right and then the first thing we know this nickan Doctrine it becomes sanctioned and was right went into action and they crowned this fell then this Spirit Antichrist become incarnate in a man see and we find out later on he becomes an incarnate devil too the demon goes away the Devil comes in and just as that church is that kind of antichrist Church progresses so has the Bride come along amen with different things to justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost is moving right on only they taken their Revival first and the church has taken it at last their first three years first three stages with them and went through the Dark Age then the third three stages comes a church house from justification sanctification baptism holy ghost in incarnate God made manifest the moment here he comes in as the Antichrist as the false prophet then the Beast then the Dark Age and the church comes out of that Dark Age justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost Incarnate Word go in and he goes down he goes down the church goes up it's just as perfect as it can be oh it's beautiful I just love it this writer is the same one but another stage of his ministry the first stage of White Horse see he was uh just a teacher just an antichrist teacher he was against the word of God now how can you be an antichrist anybody that denies that every word of this isn't true to be taught just the same as an antichrist because they deny the the the word and he is the word now first stage White Horse He was just a teacher but an antichrist spirit in its Doctrine and its quality it was innocent it couldn't hurt nothing seemed like just going on that's way Satan comes in oh he's slick bird they told he said now you know you're looking for wisdom you don't know what's right and wrong so now if your eyes were open you would know what and said the fruit is very pleasant yeah it's good it's it's Pleasant to the eye you should take it now you don't know whether it is or not do you no I don't but God said not to do it but oh well I know but uh God said he we die he said surely you won't do that just sweet as it could be look what it did watch this Antichrist Spirit rise up amongst the early church a doctrine of nickel adans niol conquer the Ley make a holy name or just well we just want Fellowship while you're scattered out here nobody knows where nobody's at I think we all have to have an organization just be different we go put oursel together we work to make a lodge out of it that's why what it is there is no such a thing as the Christian Church of Methodist that's not a church that's a lodge Baptist that's not a church it's a lodge there's only one church that's the mystical body of Jesus Christ and you're born into that that's right by predestination that's right all the father has given me will come no man can come L the father calls him and all he's give me will come to me so that that's it he just the lamb sits there making s making intercession till the last one comes in the little bell rings and he walks out and takes his possession see so brings his church home his subjects and cast his enemy into the lake ofar and all of his subjects go in there with him and that's it then we walk out in a millennium same riter now this first stage he was innocent and second now if you went a little bit higher a little more than that the second stage the Bible say said he'd be given a crown and they crowned a man a Superman see crowned him and then the Bible didn't call him a pope the Bible called him a false prophet why yeah of course he was be a false prophet by his Antichrist spirit that taught Antichrist against the original word because if you taught against the original word it was Antichrist and the word is God see now after that we find him then crowned when he got crowned now he's very innocent helpless he's just a little fell but then in The N coun he was made it in Constantine give him all the property and then what did he do then he see Satan giv him his throne and Authority the Bible said so as we went through it now the next thing we find out that the devil controls all politics that ever has been or ever will be amen we find that Matthew 4:11 and now we find out then that Satan already had politics but he's trying to get the church so he goes down to dece it he gets his Superman Works him into an organization and crowns him viker a Christ Christ acted instead of God Amen see this guy's a biker instead of God see it's the same instead of God what he supposed to be a Vier under Christ now now when he did that then what did he do then he Satan tuck his political power which he was already over and Tu the religious power which has already been crowned and put him together and then he made him another Crown over hell and then had passed on if they pay enough money to get them out so now he's he's backer over Heaven over prator is he wants to call no such a thing in the Bible see but he had to make something the Bible said he come out of the bottomless pit and returns back the same way and on Earth the ruler now what was he given then first he had a bow but he didn't have any Arrow but now he's got a mighty sword in his hand he can do something now then he jumps off his White Horse the white horse rides on out now he straddles what a red horse blood blood red horse he really rids that one oh sure now he's giving great power and a great sword to kill then he rides his blood red horse we see from the second seal that was broke last night he taken peace from the earth and did kill one another and his own mology of the Roman Catholic Church shows that they put 68 million Protestants to death from the time of St hippo of St Augustine of Hippo until 1580 68 million Smucker's great reform if you want to read it gor reform 68 million recorded on the martyrology when one of their so-called Saints got the Revelation that anybody that disagreed with the Roman Church should die as a heretic that's just set him around then boy he went to spill in the blood he he jumped on his white his red horse and he went to ride oh now his great power comes he was made biker of heaven and uh worshiped his God ruler of the Earth by uniting the church and state Together made him ruler on Earth give him a crown over that he could pray the souls out of purgatory he could uh also uh inter he was just like God on Earth instead of God to gather he had great power to kill whomever did not agree with his command who's going to say anything to him Church can't say nothing he's head of IT State can't say nothing he's head of it so they died by the millions all them little Church's brother was busted up and killed and murdered and fed the Lions and everything else see a dragon Rome give him his seat and Authority the Bible said so so he rode his tied red horse through human blood till it become a red horse now John sees him on a black horse he chained something else now I have to to say this just the way it comes to me amen and then and if it come to me and didn't compare with the rest of the scriptures then God never give it amen amen see the scriptures has to ever one it's just one great big big thing like that scripture has to agree with scripture and anything's contrary to the scripture if that angel of the Lord told me anything it wasn't scripture I wouldn't believe him amen I said there're in Chicago the day when all them hundreds of ministers was anybody there at that meeting sure that meeting in Chicago I said now you all talk about you got you thought just twisting in heing

but the Holy Spirit told me said go on over there I'll Stand By You told him three or four days be before time you always there and heard Mr uh Carlson and them and and Tommy Hicks and all of them sat there and I went 3 days before and I said you're going to have to cancel that place it's a a stormy night I was having a meeting he said go stand at that window at that third little door there and I went there and stood right in there I looked out like that he said they got a trap set for you to go to ask you to speak at that Ministerial Association the greater Chicago said they got a trap set for you on your teaching of my word he said now they're going to Castel off that place so they ain't going to get there go to get to a place where it's found said here it looks I stopped I see myself in the corner look back there and seen I seen all seen all them ministers sit there the way they was I looked them all over and he said Oh I thought I better not go over there then Lord if they go do I don't want to hurt your feelings or do anything wrong he said go stand by you he did that's right now you all just Witnesses right here was sitting right there know that's true that's well you got the tape sure also but there you are you see now now here is the mystery of this and now it when it revealed to me early this morning for daylight then I went quickly to the scripture and begin to look search it up there it was three of them so far has been absolutely supernaturally revealed now here is the mystery of the black horse according to what it was revealed to meise the Lord he has started riding him in the time of the Dark Ages that's what the dark harsh represented the dark ages for it was a time of midnight to the True Believers amen that was led watch now in that church age that middle Church age the dark Church age watch how he says you just have a little stram is a midnight to them for the true belie now watch practically all hope had been taken from the true church for this fell controlled both church and state what are they going to do see Catholicism had taken over both church and state and all didn't agree with Catholicism was killed amen amen amen that tree is on a dark horse watch what a dark thing he done see then you see and you just you know your history watch it and you well you won't have to even know it to know this now watch all hope was gone that's his black horse now he had rode in on his White Horse cunning then he GI power he took peace slaughtered the millions that's what he was going to do is you rode on through and he still does it see now here he is on his black horse now coming forth Dark Age that was that time just about the time after the church got set up and got in power they smothered out everything else and went through about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of year is what every reader knows as the Dark Ages how many knows that the Dark Ages there's your Dark Horse amen representing that Dark Age now all Hope's gone no hope at all everything looked dark for the little Believers now that's the reason it's called represented a dark horse his balances are his scales in his hand you see calling out measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see actually that is wheat and barley is natural staff of life that's what bread and stuff's made from but you see he was charging for this yeah what it means that that he was charging his subjects for the kind of the hope of life that he was standing out to them by making he started in that very time of making them pay for prayers charging for prayer they still do it no venience because what was he doing capturing the wealth of the worlden the scale weighing out measure of wheat or a penny three measures of barley for a penny the rider on a black horse see he was making stripping his subjects of their money when the Bible predicts that he holds about the wealth of the world as we said last night about Russia and all that they just take all the money just strip the people for everything they got there you are now notice you see where that old money taken in Church comes from to build an organization a big something million dollar here you see what the mother of it is am thank you Lord oh my I'm so glad yes sir all right it's been his grace that's all all right all right it's a midnight time do you understand that now and here he is charging for the kind of life that's his for barley and stuff natural wasn't spiritual now it was barley so and uh barley bread and wheat bread he was charging for that kind of a life that he was giving to his subjects charging for Prayer by the priest to pray people out of purgatory charging I'm taking this right out of the history charging for I guess it's novenia I guess what everybody novenia I guess that's something you have to do you know some penants somebody have to charge that bringing the wealth of the world to him into his into the church itself and he's still riding oh he sure is yes sir still rid notice here's the good part now notice see that thou hurt not this wi arm just a little bit of it left but don't you touch [Music] that God now oral is symbolizes the spirit the Holy Spirit I'll give you a few verses if you want to through scriptures Leviticus 812 where Aaron before he went ah had be Anointed with or you know and and Zechariah 4:12 the oril coming pouring through the pipes and said this is my spirit or and another thing if you want to see Matthew 14:25 there was a foolish vers 253 the foolish virgin had no orl no spirit and Matthew 254 the wise virgin had all in her lamp spirit Spirit or typifies the spirit Oh Glory you get it all right now or tipify spirit and wine symbolizes stimulation of Revelation oh oh I like to run all over the place want didn't wake up the neighborhood when the Lord show me that stimulation of Revelation oil and wine in the Bible is associated together always I got the Concord looking stre of that like like that where wine and oil goes together all the time see when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with or they all get stimulated why is a stimulation I feel it right now stimulated with joy shouts and when it does it has the same effect upon them that that wine does upon an natural man because when the Revelation has been given of a truth amen of God and the True Believer filled with oil and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that he makes him behave himself unnormal [Music] hallu see that's what's matter with him now makes some Behavior St unseemingly Hallelujah now if you want scripture for this just start reading Acts 2 amen what hadise they had the promise that had been given them when oil of the promise of the Holy Spirit was p pour out on them and was it was scripturally AB Vindicated now I see the one of you said now wait he told us to wait up here for our ministry and after 8 days it said well I tell you boys Mark said to Matthew I I believe we've already got it fellas don't you think so see we already got it while we're waiting on Ministry we are strong out preaching he told us come up here and wait this is 8 days we've been here well let's wait another one nine days come then Mark comes around or or maybe one of the rest of them John said I I I believe you Wen to wait any longer I believe you've already got it don't you and I can see Simon cuz he had the keys you know wait a minute boys the scriptures got something to say about this you never told us just how many days wait he said you stay there [Music] until you stay there until Joel's prophecy comes to pass until Isaiah's prophecy is a Vindicator for with stand lips and with other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the refreshment this is the wine that's poured out what is wine in the Bible Refreshments this is the refreshments that comes from the presence of the Lord H hallelujah it's got to be scriptural now see Hallelujah so you see wine represents stimulation of Revelation and when the Holy Ghost fell and they seen the fire of God fall upon them M that be to stimulate him and at first thing you know they got so stimulated till the people actually thought they were drunk but they were stimulated by the Revelation the God here it is God's Vindicated Revelation made plain to them they was happy about it God promised it here was revealed to them and Vindicated to them Hallelujah here was the man standing there saying this is that this is it and there was being indicated by the same [Music] sign there's stimulation by Revelation hallah and now they really had it then that's reason Peter could get out there and say well you man of Judea than you that dwell in Jerusalem listen me Hallelujah all you doctors of divinity listen what I'm going to tell is oh how wonderful reveal reveal they become so stimulated when they seen it Vindicated that just always does that it always does I see that God promised to do a certain thing in this day when he promised to break off these seals in this last day and you don't know the joy The Glory Hallelujah when I seen him reveal this stand there and watch it happen amen and know that I'll take any person to charge he never did say one thing to us but what happened that way and then to see the joy that's in my heart when I see his promise for this last days as he promised to do it where I see get Vindicated and made perfectly right I'm just I you hear me say I feel religious that's what's the matter the stimulation is so bad I just just about ready to go to cutting up stimulation from Revelation all right they become so stimulated over the the Revelation amen that they vindicate all right the promise th M there broke out the joy of stimulation till the people said they're drunk on new one Hallelujah when God revealed his promise to him and not only did he reveal it but he proved it that's what I've always said a man can say anything he can just have to say anything but when God comes around and vindicates that now the Bible said if there be one among you who claims to be spiritual or Prophet if he says these things and it don't come to pass then don't pay no attention to him don't fear him at all don't fear that man but if he says it and it comes to pass amen that's me he I'm in that that proves what it's me then that little Samaritan woman when the scripture said that this Messiah would do these things and here he stood and did it just exactly what the scripture said she said there he is come see a man isn't that exactly the thing that the scripture said would happen see amen she got stimulated by Revelation is that right she becomes stimulated by Revelation when it was Vindicated see that's right she know that there was we know that Messiah is a coming who's called the Christ and when he comes he will do these things amen she seen it he said I'm he then the stimulation started I way she went shouting and down through the city she left her old water pot and went down there and said to the man come and see now if you only know the Eastern Traditions that's wrong for her to do that yes sir a woman of that type nobody listen to her no sir see she had a mark and when she if she would go down the street like that and act like that the man of Street pay attention to of a brother she had a Word of Life there she was stimulated you like Hallelujah trying to put a house out on fire on a windy day oh there's something Fanning she she was ready Hall yes he couldn't put that out that was God's fire she said if you don't believe it's so you just come over here where the meeting's going on I show yes sir and so the man went out there and he didn't do it one more time but they know something happened to that woman she was changed so they believed him yes sir they believed on him because Faith cometh by hearing hearing the promise of God the word of God and watch it being made real because it's a seed and when it's sewed it'll take life it'll produce just what it's talking about if it doesn't then it doesn't got seed PR the name of the Lord or the SE didn't know how to sew it he wasn't a sin of God to se seeds he might be sewing them on top of a rock or something so you so you see the SAR gr the seed God takes care of it it falls in the right place oh my then what does it say to this Rider in Black don't you hurt my wine in my oril don't you touch it my wine oril I've got just a little bit of it down there but he's still a little bit [Music] there yeah now you go on through and measure out all that kind of life it's you're putting out that's up to you you're going to pay for it down there but when you come across that wine oril you leave it alone oh my if you can if you in other words like this if you catch some of my little flock that's filled with my o and wine see wine and O of the pure word see and you're going to kill him CU you you're doing that's what you're doing don't you force them to say any hey Mary or do anything like that or some of your Creeds you keep your hands off of them they know where they're going or they are anointed with my oil and by being Anointed with my oil they have the wine of Joy CU you know my Word of Promise I'm going to raise him up [Music] again don't hurt that don't go try to mess them up CU just keep away from them amen no oh he vindicates his word and brings the they know they knew they had rise again oh how I like that they'll Rise Again amen here comes a black horse riding now Dark Ages I went the White Horse we've seen what he done perfectly here comes the red horse we see exactly what he done here comes a black horse you see the same Rider all time what he doing right down through the ages now you find out he measured it out and charge for it exactly wheat natural natural life what just living on but symbolizing spirit oril and joy of the wine that's spiritual life don't hurt that leave it alone otherwise Rome don't you touch it it's mine amen that belongs to me now we got another thing here I want you to not notice it was not one of the four beasts that said don't touch the oil and the wine did you notice that the four Beast have been talking but watch let me just read out here just a little bit see now measure a penny for bar wheat for a penny and three measures of barley um for a penny and see that thou hurt not the wine oil now listen here and I and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast what was it the lamb Hall hallu what the four Beast the lamb said it go take his own that belongs to him amen don't you touch that or now sir not the four Beast but the lamb was the one that said it oh my amen the lamb not the four Beast didn't announce this the lamb said itself when the four Beast said come and see and they went and seen it like that he said a majure wheat for a penny and for me and so much like this and so much barley but then the lamb cried out right among them and said but don't hurt the ring AR that's right oh my listen to it don't you hurt it or you going to pay for it someday oh oh my 9:30 well to the best of my understanding and the best of that I know of and with all that I believe in my heart that's the true meaning of those three seals I want to thank God for it I'll say this that it's a revelation that he gave me he gave that to me the revelation of and I do believe that we're living in the last days tomorrow night we're take that pale horse rider and now I don't know I do not know God knows that's true I do not know one thing about it no I looked up my old context I had years ago I seen brother Grim Snelling a while ago I might have went out but I remember when I was preaching here before I looked up to see what I said years ago one day I was going through Book of Revelations I took all four horse riders one time I said the White Horse that was the early church no out I read that out the book of the Adventist and I read something isah the early church it went forth concerete and the next was a black horse I said I forget not what I call that black horse I said um or the red horse rather I said that horse was probably mean that that trouble was on the road it going to mean a lot of Wars going to hang up or something like that I said probably it be a lot of War I said that's why the they be then I said the the pale hor or the the black horse I said that that means that that maybe there'll come a black time on earth when all the stars will quit shining the sun will go down and moon won't give its light I said that's probably what that means I said The Pale Horse it means a lot of sickness is coming on I don't know what it means but that's that was my interpretation of it then because I just took it best I could stay here in the pull pit but oh I almost said something all right Hallelujah glory to God hallu oh you you'll see we watching now oh aren't we happy for this hour that we and we see all this thing heading up I think nations are breaking Israel's Awakening the signs that the prophets for told the Gentiles days numbered with Harrows and cumed return oh disperse to your own the day of redemption is near man's hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirit your lamps trimmed and [Applause] clear look up your Redemption is here [Music] oh so you can see how that the how that the seals all tie in with those Church ages and and the church ages is dealing with that church but then and that was in in 1960 when the lord gave brother brandom the Revelation on the seven Church ages and divinely uh give him the the um the dates and um and The Messengers and then of course then we could see uh through the seals the opening of the seals you can see the Mysteries behind those churches what caused those churches uh that church to progress in the way that it has so and and as and as uh brother Brenham brought out it's the same Rider on each one of those horses so it was the same Rider that looked innocent that looked uh harmless you know as he as he said it had a bow without any arrows he says but later on it was given a crown and he began to con and he conquered and began to conquer so and then and then of course he uh and then he jumps off the white to that red Slaughters and then he he then he reigns uh almost a millennial uh there uh the Catholic church for 900 and something years and um you know they introduced any kind of a Doctrine they wanted to and they they done um cuz I guarantee you you ain't going to find none of their none of their uh doctrines and dogmas in the Bible but yet they're still the that they are still the uh um leader of of all the Christian churches I mean you look them up on the internet and they've got oh my word they are still the largest and um and so um and we're going to find out as as we go on that he changed his tactics because when when Martin Luther came out with justification and started that Reformation um it it broke that chain and that anointing that man AG anointing again you know if you look there at the man and then all of a sudden you know justification come Luther started uh uh you know uh translating scriptures and then all of these others begin to start translating and getting into the the people's hand and that it it that lost uh Rome lost its its Authority and the Kings begin to Buck and just it was the anointing of the age so Satan so the Roman Church knew that it had lost its hold or or Satan knew he had lost its hold through that Roman church so he had to change his tactics so then he started coming in and and and seducing the daughters and started seducing the the the Lutheran Church and she fell then he said started seducing these other churches until they had all fallen and and adopted their own stuff until here we are today into until every Church denominational that that that one time protested the Catholic church because it was nothing but dogma and now their churches are nothing they're they're Plum full of Dogma Plum full of opinion and God's not there they're dead but there is a bride and that bride will walk with God in the purity of heart walk with God in the Purity amen of his holy spirit amen do you love him amen is't that just wonderful amen I want to read uh uh this there're in 359 as we as we close the musicians can come uh page 359 and one it says now we see why there were two Vines one true and one false now we can see why Abraham had two sons one after the flesh that persecuted Isaac one after promise now we can see how that out of the same two parents the same parents two boys came forth as twins one knowing and loving the things of God and the other knowing much of the same truth but not of that same spirit and hence persecuted the child that was elect God does not reprobate for the sake of rep probation he rep probated for the sake of the elect elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm elect it is the reprobates that persecute and destroys the elect all those reprobates are religious they are smart they are of the C line the serpent seed they build their babbles they build their cities they build their Empires all the while calling on God they hate the true seed they will do all they can even in the name of the Lord to destroy God's elect ones but they are needed they are needed what is the chaff to the wheat no chaff no wheat but at the end what happens to the chaff it is burned with fire unquenchable and the wheat where is it it is gathered in his Garner it is where he is oh elect of God beware study closely be careful work out your salvation with fear and trembling rely upon God and not your and and be strong in his might your adversary the devil is even now going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour watch under prayer and be steadfast This is the End Time both the true and the false Vine are coming into maturity but before the wheat matures those ripened tears must be bound for the burning SE they are all joining the World Council of churches that is The Binding soon the garnering of the wheat will come but right now the two Spirits are at work in two Vines come out from among the Terrors start to overcome the way that you may be considered praiseworthy for your lord and fit to Reign and Rule with him and and and he uh let me just read u a little bit more down this page here he says to him that overcometh I will grant to sit with me in my throne even as I am overcome and set down with my father in his throne now what are we to overcome this is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome now this is logical for does it matter what we are to overcome as long as we know how to overcome a quick look at the scriptures which involves the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in Matthew 4 wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcome the personal Temptations of Satan by the word by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the pride of life Jesus overcome by the word he fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcome by the word and right now let me say this say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way you can know if you are overcoming because the word Can't Fail somebody say the word Can't Fail now notice again how Jesus overcome the world systems of religion when he was repeatedly badgered by theologians of his day and he constantly applied the word he spoke only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world was utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of God in his own personal life Contin ending with himself he overcame obedience by the word of God in Hebrews 5:7 it says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong cryingsad he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things that he suffered and being made perfect he become the perf the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him what was he obedient to the word of God now then there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus unless he has been living that word your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that Throne it will only be granted to the word bride as the Throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is United to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word shall Throne uh share the throne with him can you say Amen Lord give me don't let that false Vine even brush up against me don't let nothing take me from the purpose that I've been ordained to I want to fulfill my purpose sometimes we need that renewing as as brother Jonathan sings that wrote that song may I be renewed Like an Eagle to its youth may my eyes be fixed on heaven let the world fade far from view take me places that I've never gone before that I can fulfill my purpose that I was sent to Earth for and that's what we all want to do is fulfill that purpose amen you love him here tonight praise the name of the Lord amen why don't we sing that song it's a um it uh uh come to the uh something at the table uh where the saints of God are
