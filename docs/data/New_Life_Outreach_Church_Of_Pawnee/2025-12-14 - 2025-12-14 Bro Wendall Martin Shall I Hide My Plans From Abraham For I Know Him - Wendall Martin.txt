Brother Caleb and Sister Tina have their baby here this morning and um we are are are so grateful and so proud for them. if um there and you welcome to have the whole family to come up and uh this is brother Ezra Elias Martin and um I'd like to read a a scripture. I usually read a scripture before we do this. They're in Psalms 127 and3 this morning. It says, "Lo, children are inheritage of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of the youth. Happy is the man that has his quiver full of them. They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gates. And so we are um we're going to dedicate Ezra to the Lord and and um uh just like to say that we are just so uh so proud of of uh brother Caleb and Sister Tina. I hope I don't wake him up. Oh, lookie there. Isn't he a dandy? He's all cute this morning. Handsome. And uh and so I think the greatest thing we could do is give our children back to the Lord as as he has blessed them. And um I want us to all to pray here as we dedicate this child. Father, we want to thank you for your goodness to brother Caleb and Sister Tina, Lord, in blessing them with another child, a healthy child. And Lord, bringing Sister Tina through her labor and and keeping her healthy and keeping the baby healthy. And today, Lord, we're coming to give him back to you, Lord, as you have only loaned them to us, Lord, to raise in the fear and admonition of your grace. And Father, I ask that your blessings would be upon this child, that the anointing of God would cover him all the days of his life. I pray Lord that you would keep him healthy Lord and that you would protect him from all of the evil spirits around Lord but that your hand of protection would be upon his body upon his spirit upon his soul that Lord you would use him even as a child that your grace would be seen upon him father. Oh God, deal with him, Lord, and speak to him and show yourself real. Father, we give him to you. He is yours, Father. I pray that you give wisdom and grace to Brother Caleb and Sister Tina &gt;&gt; as they raise him. Father, meet their every need. always be with them, Lord, whenever they have a question or they're fearful or not knowing which way to go, Lord, in counsel for any of their children, always be there. And we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Oh, he's awake. Amen. Hallelujah. Usually I put kids to sleep. This time I woke them up. Amen. Love y'all's whole family. Brother Caleb, God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Isn't God just so wonderful to us? Amen. blessing blessed us with with these children and and we're so grateful uh to the Lord for his blessings and um Amen. I um and and to raise them in the in the ways of the Lord one of these days. Amen. We're all going home and uh so we want to do everything we can and Amen. to make sure that our children are ready to go. Is that right? Amen. and that we're all ready to go. If you wouldn't mind standing to your feet again and Amen. I'm going to read here in the book of Genesis and the 18th chapter and um Amen. We sure um uh appreciate every one of you. We we're looking forward to next week. The children's been working on a play, a Christmas play, and so we're we're sure looking forward to that. You don't want to miss that. In fact, you want to tell your kids and everyone that you that you know or your your your family members. Amen. Um I know it's going to be a a wonderful time. Um there in we're going to just break in here um to Genesis 18 and 17. And the Lord said, "Shall I hide anything from Abraham, or shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" &gt;&gt; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him. For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him. And they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice in judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he spoke hath spoken of him. I I want to I want to uh take a a text out of this. I know him that he will take charge of his family, of his household. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we want to thank you today for your your greatness, your goodness. Thank you, Lord, for always being so kind to us, Lord. And we are with great love and respect and reverence, Lord, giving you the lordship of our lives. and of this service. And Lord, I forgot to give to uh brother Merurl the prayer request from Henrietta. Lord there, brother Wallace is having problems with his heart. Is going in for a test this week, not feeling good at all. Lord and Sister Applegate, Father, is is is hurting and her leg is really giving her a a fit again. Father, oh God, I got a request from Brother Donald that Aunt Angie's just so hurting so bad this morning. And Father, you you hear the request of your children. I pray, Lord, that you would send your word and that you would heal them even now where they are, Father. Now Lord, we look to you and we love you and we know that your you're faithful and that your word will come to pass when you said that you will heal everyone that has the faith. Now, Father, we just thank you for it. Ask that you would Lord just open your words of life to us this morning and we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated here this morning. Amen. We want to uh thank God for his mighty hand. We talked a little bit last week on Amen. Abraham's life and and how that meant God had appeared to him in the form of Melzdc and and um and how that um it was a great happening there. Amen. the the um the the elect of God, if you will, that had the promise of God. Amen. And then God comes down through Melzdc. And &gt;&gt; and um and we understand that Melzdc is uh appeared to Abraham after the battle of the king. He was he was the he was prophet, priest, king. Amen. He was eternal without father, without mother, without beginning uh of days nor ending of life. And um Amen. And so God would come in a theophony. &gt;&gt; And so the great logos of God, Amen, would come and and appear in a temporal body unto Abraham. And and we believe it was none other than God himself. And God would appear to Abraham and and um he appeared again as we here in the 18th chapter. God is appearing again to Abraham and he's he's giving Abraham the uh uh God first of all Abraham sees God and he recognizes him as the one that he had been talking to and and so amen. The Bible The Bible says that God or that Abraham knew him. He knew uh God and he he he made a feast for him and and and so um Amen. when he come to visit with him, there was a reason for for a for God coming to Abraham. Amen. Was because he was the one he was the possessor of the promise. He was going to inherit the land. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there would uh and and and and so the the time was getting closer. It was coming in to the promise, closer to the time of promise when God was uh going to Amen. take care of him and uh uh uh fulfill his word as he had promised. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, um, and and I I I think it's it's a wonderful thing because the promise is that he would come again in this last day that God would reveal himself. If you remember, Amen. There he says, "As it was in the days of Sodom, &gt;&gt; so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man." Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, the 18th chapter is is is this scripture uh being fulfilled that Jesus was talking about as it was in the days of Sodom. When the son of man appeared to Abraham, so will it happen in the last day. &gt;&gt; And and so you can read that 18th chapter. Amen. And as as as God appears to him, he's fixing to go down. The two angels are fixing to go and to down to Sodom and and and to destroy Sodom. Amen. And and God says, "Can I can I hide anything from Abraham?" Amen. The thing that I do because I I I've GOT GREAT CONFIDENCE in Abraham. I've got a lot invested in Abraham &gt;&gt; and I know Abraham. I've given him a promise that he will inherit this land and that Amen. and he's going to produce a natural seed and a spiritual seed. &gt;&gt; AND AND SO GOD IS APPEARING unto uh the the natural seed and and he is letting him know, amen, he's he's saying the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah has risen up to me. Their sin is grievious and I'm going down to investigate. AND AND AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT ABRAHAM was so comfortable with God that he interceded with God. Abraham was so at one with God. He had recognized God so much that he is HE IS NOW TALKING WITH GOD, feeding God. God is eating there in his theophony body. Well, praise the Lord. Abraham called him Lord Jehovah. Can you say amen? and and and so he he was he you know he he was he was saying if there's 50 would you spare them and God says yeah I'll do that and then Abraham if there's 40 if there's 30 and he goes down and and he says listen if IF IF THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THERE but my family will you will you pull them out before the destruction isn't that just incredible how comfortable that Abraham was with this great God who had come talking to him in a body. And remember, as it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the revealing before Jesus comes. Can you say amen? That there was going to be a relationship with God and his church. Amen. And and SO I I I I've always loved this and how that Abraham God appeared to Abram and God separated him to himself and God gave Abraham a promise and he God nurtured his faith and God changed his body to receive the promise. Everything all was centered around God. &gt;&gt; There was nothing that Abraham could do. All he could do was just the only thing Abraham had going for him was that God showed him kindness. &gt;&gt; God's grace was upon Abraham. Well, can you say man? You can't buy that favor. YOU CAN'T BUY THAT LOVE from God. IT WAS GOD WHO ELECTED. IT WAS GOD WHO CALLED. IT IS GOD WHO GAVE THE PROMISE. AND IT'S GOD WHO IS GOING TO FULFILL HIS WORD IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE THE THE BIBLE EVEN SAYS THAT ABRAHAM WAS WAS GOD'S FRIEND. AMEN. Isaiah 41 and 8 it says he was the friend of God. Chron 2 Chronicles 20 and7. Amen. It says Abraham was your friend. Uh uh this the writer talking to God. James 2:23 the scripture was filled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God. You know, I want it to BE SAID THAT I AM A BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; OKAY. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY WANTS THAT TO BE SAID IN your life? &gt;&gt; That you believe God. You You don't You might not have everything else going for you, BUT IF IF YOU'RE A BELIEVER, you've got a lot You've got a lot going FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT A LOT GOING FOR YOU. AND AND GOD IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO BELIEVE HIM IN this day to believe him AND TO HAVE A CONFIDENCE IN HIM and to stand for that word in this day. I I BELIEVE THAT AMEN. IT WASN'T IT WASN'T JUST UH uh always uh uh uh uh uh uh just you know peaceful around Abraham's place because at ONE TIME LOT WAS THERE WITH ABRAHAM. AMEN. He didn't fully obey as we talked about last Sunday. Amen. He didn't fully surrender and and Lotus AND AND HIS DAD AND ALL OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE come with him and Amen. And it was it was not a good thing. And there was a A A REQUIREMENT from God to separate himself, Amen. from his family. HE HAD TO SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM LOT. That that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to when you get saved, you have to leave all of your kin folk. Amen. But I'm here to tell you, you do have to separate yourself from unbelief. You do have to separate yourself to God. And sometimes, AMEN. YOUR KIN FOLKS are you're going to have to separate yourself from your kin folk. Sometimes you're GOING TO HAVE TO SEPARATE yourself from your friends BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION THAT YOU ARE GOING IN, you've got to walk alone with God. &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? BUT SO HERE LOT WAS LOT DID NOT HAVE the same perception as Abraham had. Amen. They started together but they had two different goals. One was looking to the eternal value and there was the other that was looking to the earthly value. There was one, amen, that was just sort of out of his mind looking for a a a city whose builder and maker was God. Amen. A city and HE AND HE WAS CONSTANTLY looking for this. He was a revelation in his heart. Lot on the other hand, all he all he was interested in is more money, more things. And and when they finally separated, Amen. uh he looked down to the well-watered plains of Sodom and said, "I'll pitch my tent down there, and I there's where I can make some money, and there's where I'm going to raise my family." That was not what God had in mind for Abraham. God did not appear unto Sod UNTO LOT IN SODOM. He appeared unto Abram. He appeared to him. And and and WHY DID HE APPEAR? HE SAYS, "I CAN I keep anything away from Abraham? seeing that he is going to uh uh uh take charge of his children and his family. He's going to walk in my ways AND SHOW THEM THE ways of life. LOT IS NOT DOING THAT. BUT I DO KNOW ABRAHAM. I'VE HAD CONTACT WITH HIM. I AM A friend of Abraham. And there's where I want to speak here for a little bit this morning. Amen. as the head of the household, Lot failed. He failed his wife. He failed his children. They suffered for it is because there was not divine revelation in the in the uh in the HEART OF LOT. LOT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT GOD WAS DOING. GOD COULDN'T HE COULDN'T SEE, AMEN. that the sin was killing his children. He couldn't see that that the that the children were uh UH WERE BEING AFFECTED IN SUCH A WAY. AMEN. HE COULDN'T SEE THAT GOD WAS FIXING TO BURN IT UP. But Abraham could see, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I wonder today I wonder today as we as we stop and think about where we are at this A THIS MORNING, HOW GOOD IT IS TO KNOW. AMEN. NOT just hearing it, not just reading it that the B, you know, that that the earth is going to burn with fire and heat. Amen. But to have the revelation deep DOWN INSIDE THAT GOD IS CALLED YOU, elected you, predestinated you to COME AND YOU HAVE SEPARATED YOURSELF FROM THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE SEPARATED YOURSELF, AMEN, unto him. Not separating yourself unto me. not separating yourself unto William Brandham or to uh uh whoever else. YOU ARE SEPARATING YOURSELF UNTO GOD.

AND WE'RE NO LONGER AMEN WE'RE NO LONGER ANEMIC. WE'RE NO LONGER LETHARGIC. WE'RE NO LONGER JUST AMEN HERE AND THERE. BUT WE GOT A BACKBONE ABOUT US TO STAND UP AND SAY, "I BELIEVE GOD IS MY HEALER. I BELIEVE GOD IS MY SAVIOR. I BELIEVE GOD SHOULD BE THE ONE THAT MY FAMILY should live with." &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we're not to go by emotions. You'll end up feeling lost more than times than not. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You'll be defeated. Amen. Because of worship feelings. Can you say amen? But remember, we ought to thank God. We ought to thank God for for men. The the the Bible says there in Hebrews 13 and 77, remember them which have the rule over you. For they watch who have spoken unto you the word of God, whose faith following considering the end of their conversation or consider the outcome of their life and mimic or imitate their faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. For they must give an account. Amen. Let's go to the seventh. Is that is that the next part of it? Amen. Where they must give an account. Amen. Oh, the next the next one is um he Hebrews 13:17. Obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls. Amen. Did I mess those two scriptures up? Hebrews 13:7. Remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So the responsibility is there not not not for us men to lead how it to to to leave according to our own dictates. We've got to live according to the dictates of scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sisters, you're not to lead the family. &gt;&gt; Period. You say, "Well, don't don't don't isn't isn't the husband supposed to support the wife?" Yes. That is true. We play that supportive role. But the man is the He's the president. He's the executive. And he's called you to be his chief of staff. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He's called you, but the chief of staff has still got a Sure. Okay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I think I'm just going to keep on going. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. The family. The family, if it is ran by the woman, will always be under a curse until the family gets in order. The husband is not TO SUPPORT THE WIFE'S DECREES. THE H WIFE IS TO SUPPORT THE HUSBAND'S DECREES. AND THEN DON'T LEAVE YOUR WIFE. Don't leave her HOLDING THE BAG IF SHE'S DOING SOMETHING SHE YOU'VE TOLD HER TO DO. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That takes that TAKES THAT TAKES ALL OF the that takes all of the emotion or it takes all the load off of the lady. Because the man is stepping up and saying, "Listen, &gt;&gt; I'm not being mean." No, I I am not I'm not I'm not advocating mean. I'm not advocating being belligerent. I'm not advocating being Amen. A JERK. I'M ADVOCATING BEING A SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; BEING A SHEPHERD, WATCHING OVER THAT HOME, LOVING YOUR WIFE, LOVING YOUR CHILDREN AS GOD LOVES THE CHURCH. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Wives, you should support your husband. &gt;&gt; If your wife, if your husband says you shouldn't, you know, those girls shouldn't wear that kind of a blouse, don't jump in. He's a man. Maybe go talk to him at the side off to the side in the bedroom. Well, honey, I I don't and let the man talk the peace. But when it comes to that family, your husband is to lead that family. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and for those who are still I mean I mean I I brought these these scriptures here just in case it did go south. But 1 Corinthians 11 and3 I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of woman is the man &gt;&gt; and the head of Christ is God. Second 2 SECOND 2 TIMOTHY 2:12 BUT I SUFFER NOT A WOMAN TO TEACH NOR USURP AUTHORITY OVER THE MAN. &gt;&gt; We're not to usurp authority. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; OH, DON'T BE MAKING HIM LOOK GOOD IN FRONT OF YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE THE ONE AND AND AND AND YOU'RE YOU'RE MAKING HIM DO EVERYTHING according to you, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF AND YOU need to get right with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; A woman IS NOT TO USURP AUTHORITY OVER THE MAN. &gt;&gt; That is not her call. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Boy, this is serious, ain't it, brother Windle? Yeah, it is. Right? &gt;&gt; He's the shepherd. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; He's the shepherd over y'all's little flock. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I'm just going to go ahead and do a jig right now because I know some of you are wanting to. Praise the Lord. Good. &gt;&gt; I suffer not a woman to teach, nor usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve, Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding, she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in the faith and charity, and holiness with sobriety. When God visited Abraham, when God visited Abraham, God came to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. He come and reveal himself to Abraham. You know what the prophet said over and over and over in the messages? He said, "You will notice SARAH DIDN'T JUMP INTO THE CONVERSATION LIKE WE SEE A LOT OF OTHER WOMEN DO." &gt;&gt; She said, "Back then there was a respect for Abraham." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wasn't with women wasn't as brazen as they are today. They stayed back and take care of their business in them days. Amen. She was back in the tent. Today, she has to run her husband's business and all the rest of the business and everything else. Now, I'm not saying that to you sisters. Of course, you all don't wouldn't do that. I'm talking about the women of the world. Sarah stayed back in the tent where she belonged. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; SO, I'M GLAD I'M GLAD HE CLARIFIED THAT. WE DON'T HAVE TO have worry about that in the church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, AMEN. HERE THE APOSTLE PETER 1 PETER 3:1 LIKEWISE YOU WIVES BE IN SUBJECTION TO YOUR OWN HUSBANDS THAT IF ANY OBEY NOT IN NOT THE WORD THEY ALSO MAY WITHOUT THE WORD BE ONE BY THE CONVERSATION OF THE WIVES WHILE THEY BEHOLD YOUR CHASE conversation or lifestyle covered with fear uh uh whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of the plating of hair and the wearing of gold and the putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of GREAT PIES. FOR AFTER THIS MANNER IN OLD TIMES, BROTHER brother Merl's talked about going back to THE OLD LANDMARKS. OLD TIMES, HALLELUJAH. SEE, you was used to the Lord more than you thought this morning. Amen. Other times THEM WOMEN ALSO WHO TRUSTED IN GOD ADORNED THEMSELVES BEING and subjected to their own husband, even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord. HALLELUJAH. WHOSE DAUGHTERS ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement. Now, am I is this is this Bible? Are you are you are you pulling this stuff up out of the Bible? Amen. Where's the family today? &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Why is the family? &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. Smite the shepherd. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And scatter the sheep.

Yes, &gt;&gt; well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; So, God's not calling God's not calling just this thing. This this ain't a a This ain't just a little picnic. This thing ain't a a marriage is not a game. &gt;&gt; Families are not a game. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REAL SOULS &gt;&gt; RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REAL FAMILIES. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REAL GENERATIONS.

THAT DEVIL IS A LIAR. &gt;&gt; HE'S A THIEF. HE WANTS TO DESTROY OUR FAMILIES. BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME SHEPHERDS THAT'S GOING TO STAND UP AND SAY, "NO, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ON MY WATCH. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ON MY WATCH. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; It's my responsibility. Everyone say physically &gt;&gt; emotionally. &gt;&gt; Emotionally, &gt;&gt; spiritually. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm coming and talking to you, Abram. I ain't talking to this guy. He He don't He don't know the sky from the ground. But Abraham, I called you and you have separated yourself. And now I'm coming to tell you some secrets because I know that you are going to take me serious. &gt;&gt; You're going to take your family serious. You're going to take your call serious. You're going to take my word serious. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; In order to be an effective leader, Amen. you must have the same convictions that Jesus has. You boys, if you're going to be a coni a a if you're going to have be a SUCCESSFUL LEADER, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE SAME CONVICTIONS THAT JESUS JESUS CALLED US MEN. AMEN. TO BE LEADERS. HE CALLED US MEN TO BE SHEPHERDS. AND IN ORDER FOR US TO BE EFFECTIVE, WE HAVE WE HAVE GOT TO TO TO TO HAVE THE SAME EXACT CONVICTIONS THAT JESUS HAD when he gave them to us.

I'VE GOT TO HAVE THIS END TIME BANNER. GOD. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Oh God give us the convictions. OH GOD TO WHERE your word is our everything, to where your spirit is our everything. I pray God that these YOUNG MEN WILL RISE UP TODAY AND SAY, "LET ME BE ACCOUNTED FOR." EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN MARRIED, &gt;&gt; EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN MARRIED, STAND UP TODAY AND SAY, "LET ME BE ACCOUNTED FOR. LET ME BEAR THE CROSS OF JESUS. LET ME LET RAISE IT UP AS an end sign." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; John 12:26, "If any man serve me, let him follow me. Where I am, there shall also my servant be. And if any man serve me, him will my father honor. We want to be honored of the Lord. We want God to bless us. Then let me follow him that called me. Oh, praise the Lord, brothers. We've only got one one agenda, and it's not to cowell. Amen. To your wife. And it's not to make sure that your children have all the latest digital demons. And it's NOT TO HAVE THE FINEST CLOTHING in the church. Amen. You've got one priority, and that's to please the one who has called you to be a minister to your family. &gt;&gt; To please the one who has called you. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Again, I I I I'm not I'm not advocating to be indifferent and cruel and mean and belligerent. I'm saying that the responsibility for my family that I'M THE SHEPHERD OF MY FLOCK, IT'S NOT MY WIFE'S RESPONSIBILITY. I KNOW I KNOW SOME MEN, AMEN, THEY'VE WORKED ALL THEIR LIVES, AMEN, AND THEIR CHILDREN DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A A YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THEY'VE always been gone, always been all over the countryside and let the wife raise. That's not the way GOD INTENDED IT. A MAN IS TO RAISE. A MAN IS TO SHEPHERD. A MAN IS TO WATCH THOSE SAY. A MAN IS TO BE NOT THE WOMAN. THE WOMAN IS NOT THERE. THANK GOD FOR THE WOMAN. THE WOMAN HAS HER PLACE. I'M TALKING ABOUT LEADERSHIP THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND YOU ALL YOU LADIES KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I THINK ABOUT Y'ALL. I think you guys are y'all's way up here in my books. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have no problem with women helping me here at the church all the time. I mean, Sister Leah runs the the cleaning.

SHE BETTER RESPECT THIS POSITION THAT GOD'S PUT ME IN. &gt;&gt; IF NOT, IT HURTS HER. &gt;&gt; Am I doing all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I AM THE ONE RESPONSIBLE for watching for those spirits. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I am the one and my desire. I'm going to have to answer to God for my church. I'm going to have to answer to God for the community. I'm going to have to answer God for my family. I'm going to have God's called me as a man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, can you say amen? But I I I think us men are a lot like this one right here. John 4:34, Jesus said unto them, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work." &gt;&gt; Can Can I Can I Why don't us men, why don't you just raise a right hand to the Lord and say, "My meat &gt;&gt; is to do the will of him that sent me &gt;&gt; and to finish his work." &gt;&gt; That's my That's my desire. I'm making that commitment to the Lord. I want to do the will of him that has sent me. Can you say amen? Amen. Second 2 second Timothy 2 and4. NO MAN THAT WARS ENTANGLE HIMSELF WITH the affairs OF THIS LIFE THAT HE MAY PLEASE him who had chosen him to be a soldier. AND IF A MAN ALSO STRIVE FOR THE MASTERIES YET HE IS NOT CROWNED EXCEPT HE STRIVE LAWFULLY. AMEN. A SOLDIER, A A LEADER, ONE THAT IS CALLED IS NOT GOING TO BE amen in ALL OF THIS JUNK THAT'S THAT'S INTERFERED TO where he is not sensitive to the THINGS OF GOD. THE POWER OF GOD IS NOT FLOWING. BROTHER, I KNOW IT'S HARD. I'M A MAN, TOO. But I'm telling you, if there's ever a time for us to do it, &gt;&gt; today the day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; The call today, take courage. Take courage. Amen. Well, we strive to be worthy vessels of grace. Everyone in this assembly here this morning, every one of you are flawed. &gt;&gt; I'm flawed. You men are flawed. &gt;&gt; You women are flawed. &gt;&gt; And our children are flawed. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I I I I want to say here this morning that the blood of Jesus didn't come for anybody else but for the flawed. &gt;&gt; For the flawed sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Melzdc came to the flawed Abraham who could not produce. But Abraham had to believe it. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; And when God looked at his report card, when God gave Abraham the report card there in Hebrews 11, &gt;&gt; he said, "Abraham staggered not at the promises of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That makes you want to turn your head. Some of you ladies were to say, "Oh, I doubt if Sarah would say that. I doubt if Sarah would give him straight A's. But when God looked at him, God said a man or or or God says that he staggered not at the promises of God and he was imputed righteous and was called the friend of God. &gt;&gt; Now brothers, if you want that kind OF A GRACE FOR YOURSELF FROM FROM those that are following you, you give that kind of grace to those that you're leading too. That's true. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We lead in spite of our inadequacies and imperfections. None of God's earthly ministers are free from flaws. God's prophets did not fall from the sky. They were born from flawed human beings as flawed human beings. &gt;&gt; Right? Right? &gt;&gt; They were made up of men, mortal men, but on the inside of them, they had conviction. AND THEY WOULD STAND IN THE FACE OF LIONS FOR THAT CONVICTION. They would STAND IN THE FACE OF FURNACES for that conviction. &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD STAND UP AT KINGS AND CURSE them because of their convictions. THEY WOULD STAND OUT. GOD ELEVATED THESE MEN. &gt;&gt; GOD PLACED CONVICTION ON THE INSIDE OF THESE FLAWED HUMAN beings to fulfill a purpose. &gt;&gt; Every one of you men, whether whether or not Amen. I I'm I'm talking to you teenage young men, too. Every one of you young men, maybe in the light of my sermon here this morning, maybe you're feeling like maybe you need to you you feel like crawling under a bench or something. Hallelujah. And that's not what we want to do. God's not wanting us men to crawl under a bench. God's wanting us to get a little bit of conviction about us. God wants and first of all, conviction. Amen. Conviction is God is right and I'm wrong. God is always right and I'm always wrong. Conviction is is I'm going to bow beneath that cross and I'm going to let the blood of Jesus Christ, Amen, run over me and wash me, WASH MY MIND, WASH MY HEART, WASH THESE THINGS AWAY. OH, can you say amen? I I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED HERE THIS MORNING IS GOD LET US GO BACK TO AN OLDFASHIONED BAPTISM WHERE GOD WILL TAKE HIS SCRUB BRUSH AND BEGIN to wash our Well, I I believe I BELIEVE EVERY ONE OF US MEN YOU YOU'VE been a you you you've BEEN A EVEN YOU ELDERS, GOD CAN WASH YOU AND RENEW YOU, strengthen you again. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Five-fold ministry is made up of men who need the blood of Jesus. The responsibility to being a father, to being a mother has been given to flawed human beings. &gt;&gt; But I can hear the commission to Joshua as Joshua is now going Joshua now is still having to do with Abraham. Now I'm I'm I'm fixing to shut up. Amen. But Abraham Abraham, the Bible says that God given him that promise that there's going to be 400 years in a strange land. Then he's going to bring them back out. Now Moses has brought them out. Now Joshua is leading them in the land and placing them. And and and here Joshua is looking at his humanity. His leader is not allowed to even go over into the promised land because of a decision his leader made. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; He had done seen a lot of a a lot of a lot of stuff happened. But you know what God tells him? Be strong there. There one Joshua 1 and7 I believe it is. Amen. Maybe one and six, but I think it's one and seven. Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. And the book, this book of the law shall not depart of thy mouth, out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night. Thou shalt meditate therein day AND NIGHT. THOU SHALT meditate therein. Meditate is the therein. YouTube is the therein. Games is the therein. I'M TALKING ABOUT PARALYZED FAITH. Thou shalt meditate in my laws DAY AND night so THAT YOU CAN OBSERVE TO DO ALL THAT IS WRITTEN AND REQUIRED OF YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT THERE'S NO MEDITATING. THERE'S NO OBSERVING TO DO. I know I'm keeping you long, but &gt;&gt; there's no meditating. Oh, THERE'S A LOT OF MEDITATING GOING ON BECAUSE SATAN HAS FOUND OUT HOW TO TAKE OUR MIND. Tell it's easy to just church ain't important. The body of Christ ain't important. This ain't important. That ain't important. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And we fail to realize that that younger generation is watching our hypocritical lives. I want a responsibility. Put that back up, Sister Keys. And then now we're going to close now. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth. But thou shalt meditate therein day and night, and thou shalt observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Have I not commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage. &gt;&gt; BE NOT AFRAID, NEITHER BE THOU DISMAYED. FOR THE LORD THY GOD is with thee, whethersoever thou goest. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; My burden this morning is I I've what I've done is I I've been looking I've been looking at the closeness of Abraham. It got me amazed as I as I've been studying through Hebrews and and I've you know we we've studied for over the years and things but as I've gone around it Abraham and Melzdc was all through it. It's all through it. Abraham there he is going through his battles but he's believing God. Melzdc is right there and it's going down it's going down this this priesthood and how that God is there. And so I then I looked up the words or you know when I when I was going back and looking at Abraham's life and says I'm going to I want to talk to you because I know you. &gt;&gt; We've got a relationship together. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, now sisters, I I I I I want to tell you, your husband did not petition heaven to be a leader. That was God's job. Or that that was God that had that and decreed that in his mind. and his and he he's put every one of these men in your lives or you put that man in your life. Your man didn't ask for it. But if there's something that we know, I I know half this stuff that I'm preaching here this morning. I I am preaching uh under conviction. I believe the Lord is has been here to minister. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that it it's that I think everyone I as far as I know, we're all good people. Amen. But what if that man is struggling? What if that man is feeling like he's not what he needs to be? I say today to give him respect. I'm going to tell you this. I'm going to say give him respect even if he's not worthy of it. because he has he's under a respect the office because what I have found out is a lot there's a lot of people in counseling over the my 30 something years of pastoring is there's there's there there's always a reason not to respect your man. I found out there's a bunch of them. But we respect the office. It's the same way as the pastor. You don't might not always understand and agree with every decision made or every whatever else, but you do have to have respect for the office. And when I let you down, the office is not. That's God's call. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as it's a call of a leader to your family, it's a call. And many of times us men are not going to hit the mark. In fact, I would say most of us miss the mark. Amen. &gt;&gt; But my rally this morning is don't forsake your call. Don't forsake it. AND IF YOU GOT A GOOD MAN THAT'S PROVIDING FOR YOUR FAMILY, LOVING YOUR CHILDREN, YOU ought to love him and respect him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then IF THERE'S EVER A time to get into prayer or consecration to God, I say today, let's get into let's get into that consecration to the Lord. Can you say amen? You say, "I'm not addicted to to my phones." I'm just going to talk to you men and you women need to listen to me, too. But I'm talking to you men. &gt;&gt; Why don't you Why don't you do it for a week? Set your phone down. Look at your text. Unless you have for jobs or whatever, you know, &gt;&gt; I would tell you to just lay it beside you three minutes and you'd have that thing picked up. &gt;&gt; It's a trick of the devil. &gt;&gt; Am I old fogy? Am am I am I just getting to where I'm just I I can't I have I gotten to the point where I just can't fit in with modern times or is this still the gospel &gt;&gt; is is I I KNOW IT'S SO OUT THERE. THIS MESSAGE IS SO OUT THERE THIS MORNING, BUT IT'S BIBLE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you that that the inventor God is not the inventor of the internet. &gt;&gt; And neither was Al Gore. &gt;&gt; That's for you old people that remember Al Gore said he invented the internet. This online affair is so anti-God, anti-urch body, anti- family that a person can hide. Now, daddies, I want you to really catch this. Your children, mas and daddies too, can hide behind the computers and phones &gt;&gt; and never come out from behind. The rich face-to-face interactions are replaced with the superficial online texting. &gt;&gt; The ease of digital communications have has dwarfed our minds until they are saying today. go uh uh they're saying today that the attention spans has has shrunk so much in in in the kids. I get these I get these tutorials and on on church media and they say you don't want you don't want just a camera on you that people's going to lose they're going to lose they're going to lose track of you within five minutes. So, what they try to tell you is you need all these cameras and it is just needs to be constantly going. That's the reason why they're moving. They change the lights. Uh, you know, one minute the backdrop is red and the next church service it's blue and it's, you know, it's whatever else. Well, they're the big wigs are telling them how to run their church services so people won't fall asleep on them. Maybe ought to try. But they say the attention span has so shrunk these days because of the YouTube and Facebook that this generation mindset minds are being trained so differently than what they were even 30 years ago. It's a it's it's a big study. It's it's quite a it's quite an interesting thing because everything's done online now and you don't you you're not just getting on your phone. You're not just getting on your phone and saying one thing. Now, if I come to visit you, Kaylee, if I visit you, you're stuck with me for two hours or whatever and we're just sitting there in the living room and trying to think of something else to say, right? You don't have to do that with your phones. Take the phone. You can you can you can be doing you can you can be texting three people and watching a movie at the same time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; You're con you're con you don't stay on the same deal. You're constantly moving from this shopping to this to this to this this. It's fast-paced. It's fast-paced. You can shop online. Your friends are online. Your hobbies are online. Your games are online &gt;&gt; and you can do this all while working. &gt;&gt; Don't know how but they say there's FOUR THINGS THAT ARE LOST. the non-verbal communications you have lost the nuanced body language the eye contact the vocal tones and the commitment required in relationships &gt;&gt; you say why are we saying this because I'm saying we need some shepherds and I am saying there might be a wolf in your house with a child that smiling at you every morning. &gt;&gt; Make sure we know our children and make sure we know what spirits. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; They say these four things are so crucial for understanding emotions. thus making in-person interactions harder. I'll just block you. There's no working things out in here in the here and now with the real people in your church, in your community, in your family. It's just you can just you can just block. And social media promotes the ability to disengage and abruptly in contact People have lost the ability to navigate through conflicts. It has made it easy to shut just shut others off by unfriending them, by blocking them from their social accounts, from their lives. But they say what it's done is it's made people less confident. The psychologists are saying people are less confident today because they're hiding now. They've got they've got a rage in them, but they don't have confidence. &gt;&gt; I want our I want us to stand in the in the power of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? If the musicians would come. Oh God. Oh God. I know us all here. We all We're all God-fearing people. But don't you take for a minute that Satan don't want to kill every one of you. And here's the deal. The spoken word is the original seed. Mysteries open. Word has come back to us. If it lays dormant on a computer, it lays dormant on a phone. It lays dormant while we are down enjoying the pleasures of Sodom. The words of the son of man are not going to have the effect in our lives. &gt;&gt; Let's take Sodom out. &gt;&gt; Let's take these valuable God. Give me conviction for these words of life that have been restored to us this day. I'm not a saying that God's wanting us to all become nuns. Put oursel in a con. We're in the world. We're not of the world. We have to brush shoulders with those at school, those at work, &gt;&gt; but we're not of them. When our heart becomes hardened like them until we can't look at our wife and say sorry, the wife can't look at the husband and say sorry. Then it's passed down to the next generation to the kids can't say sorry. Mamas can't say sorry to their children. Boys grew up hearing me say sorry. I was a flub. I am a flub. And I don't want anything in my flubbiness to distract them from the Christ of Calvary. I'm a mortal. I can fall, but I can also repent. &gt;&gt; I can say things that I shouldn't, but I want to say I'm sorry. I can act ways that I shouldn't and I want but I can also say sorry because we have without us without this body here who do we have without the body of Christ who do we have we're Yeah. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. I am nothing without you. Take it up. &gt;&gt; For I am not the street to pray. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; near enough. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; for I am nothing. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; I am nothing &gt;&gt; without you. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.

Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; There God. &gt;&gt; Build it up. &gt;&gt; May it be broken as an offering of love. I am nothing. &gt;&gt; I am nothing without you. &gt;&gt; We bless you, Lord. Oh my soul needs your love to cover me so help me see Jesus that I people without you.

Yes, that I am nothing without you. In the morning when I rise. In the morning when I rise. In the morning when I &gt;&gt; give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. Oh, give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. You can have all this world. Oh, give me Jesus. Yes, Lord. Oh, when I &gt;&gt; feel alone, oh my. Oh, when I am alone. Oh, when I am the Lord, that's my prayer. Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus.

I'll have Jesus. I'll have Jesus. You can have all this world. I let you &gt;&gt; when I lost my direction. You're the compass for my way. You're the fiery light. When nights alone get cold in sadness, you're the laughter that shatters all my fears. And when I'm alone, your hand is there to hold. Oh Jesus, you're the center of my joy. Oh, all that's good and perfect comes from you. You're the heart of my content. Oh, for all I do. Jesus, you're the center of my joy. Oh my. You are why I find pleasure in the simple things of life. You're the music in the meadow and the streets. Voices of the children. my family and my home. You're the source and finish of all my highest dreams. And Jesus, you're the center of my joy. All that's good and perfect comes from you. You're the heart of my content. Oh, for all I do. Jesus, you're the center of my joy. Once again now. And Jesus, you're the center of my joy.

All that's good and perfect comes from you. You're the heart of my content. Oh, for all I do. Jesus, you're the center of my joy. In moments like these, I sing out a song. I sing out a love song to Jesus in moments like these. I lift up my hands. I lift up my hands to the Lord. Seeking I love you. Seek him. I love you, Lord. Seek him. I love you, Lord. I love you. When I after sermons that are direct, any time that I come out of the anointing, I I feel like crawling under a rock somewhere. I love our church. I love every one of you. And I I hope that it didn't sound derogatory towards you sisters at all. I'm saying is the way God's built the lady, he's not called the lady to be the leader. &gt;&gt; He's just not called the lady to be the leader. God's called the man. And a woman is not to be directing that house. whatsoever leading the house. But that doesn't take the value away. I have the highest regard for every one of you sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I do. But I know if there's going to be spirits that's cast out of a home, it's going to be a man that's going to have to stand up to his position. We want headship. We want headship. And the head of Christ is God. The head of man is Christ and the head of woman is man. God did not appear to Sarah because Sarah had no business talking to Abraham about any spiritual revelation. God appeared unto Abraham because Abraham had every responsibility to share it with Sarah. And he appeared to Abraham because he knew he would do it to the letter. I'm sharing it because he's the heir and he's going to direct his children and household after him. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Love every one of you. I love you, Lord. Singing I love you, Lord. God bless you. Now, &gt;&gt; as our brother dismisses us in moments like these, I sing out. I sing out a love song. Jesus in moments like these I lift up my hands. I lift up my hands to the Lord.
