evening what an assurance no matter what we're going through it's not over yet the devil don't have the last laugh we read the last of the book we know the end of the story so no matter where we're at we get the last laugh amen ought an assurance if you you have your Bibles let's turn to John 7 and 33 you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen John 7 and33 then Jesus said say I said unto them yet a little while I am with you then I go unto him that sent me ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am thither ye cannot come then said the Jews among themselves whether will he go that we shall not find him will he go into the uh unto the dispersed among the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me where I am thither ye cannot come in the last day and in the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake he of the spirit which they had believed on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified and many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is a prophet is the prophet others said this is the Christ but some said shall Christ come out of Galilee hath not the scripture said that that Christ cometh of the seed of David out of the town of Bethlehem where David was and this is what I want to catch out of this uh portion of scripture so there was division among the people because of him can we bow our heads tonight right dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord what a privilege it is to come into your house Lord God as we come into this part of the service Lord I ask that you would anoint me Father God As I Lay myself aside you see I'm nervous tonight Lord I ask that you'd help me to calm my nerves Lord Lord you see the needs of the people father I ask that you would come and speak in a mighty way father Lord only you can touch the hearts and meet the needs father you see the desires of the hearts Lord Lord we lay this service into your hands in Jesus name amen excuse me so if I had a title tonight you may be seated if I had a title I'm just going to continue on with a pressure that I've been speaking on for the last few Services I've been here I haven't uh spoken here in a couple months but I've been preaching these things on the road so I got a few different thoughts that I hope can make sense tonight but what I've been trying to show is pressure is trying to push us in a certain direction if we're not careful we can go in the opposite direction than what we're wanting to go you see one definition of pressure is the the use of persuasion influence or intimidation to make someone do something so pressure is pretty incredible pressure can influence pressure can persuade pressure can intimidate that's exactly what the devil is trying to do is push you in a direction influence your thought influence your actions influence the way you talk it's all by pressure you know like like we've said before somebody don't lose their temper right away but it's pressure upon pressure upon pressure and it makes somebody lose their temper and that's what the spirits of leot is doing with pressure after pressure is trying to make us lukewarm trying to make us form trying to make us powerless because we can't we can't overcome the enemy if we're powerless so he knows if he can get enough pressure against our mind against our bodies against our our our natural man it will start to bring us down you see how many has ever been driving down the road and you're in the fast lane going five miles over and somebody gets on your tail and they're they're right behind you they're trying to pressure you to get over normally I'm the guy that gets behind the car trying to PR pressure them what it is is you get on their tail and you're trying to let them know hey I don't like where you're at get over and whenever we feel the pressures of the enemy that's a good sign we're in a spot that the devil don't like he's coming with pressure saying get over I don't want you to defeat my kingdom I don't want you to overcome but that's a good sign we need to stand where we're at if you feel lukewarmness coming against you stand don't give in lukewarmness don't give in the formal ISM don't give in Leo but stand on the solid ground that God has given us and defy every intimidation you see that intimidating Spirit can come against your mind and say you can't believe that God sent a prophet because everybody is going to think you're strange if you witness at the job site they're not going to understand you they're going to think you're in a cult they're going to think you're crazy that's pressure and when you give in that that pressure you start to bow down to the enemy and you don't realize that every time you don't witness to somebody you're giving into pressure all right hey I've been there I've been you know working with co-workers and you get that little unction to witness and you're like well he's not going to understand he's going to think I'm crazy I'm giving in to pressure it's intimidation trying to put me down underneath its thumb but you see that takes away our Authority brother brandom says that's exactly right where we're standing irrelevant no matter what the word says well it's all right I believe it's all right you're presuming it's all right but the Bible says that's wrong and to presume is to Adventure without Authority you haven't got God's word and God's Authority behind it and that just struck me whenever I read that when we're presuming we got no we don't got God's Authority behind it and that's what pressure does it starts to push us where we're pursuing that the message is right we're just presuming that God sent a prophet we're just presuming that that there there's a body change we're presuming we're just hoping because the pressure is shaking up our faith oh but if we can just stand against the pressure there's all of Heaven backing us up we can believe for the impossible we can believe for God to heal the sick we can believe for miracles to take place even though the pressures are there you see it's pretty incredible you can have faith for so many people but once it comes to yourself it seems like you lack Faith how many's ever been there I know as a preacher whenever somebody comes up and and you pray for them you've got faith you know God can heal them but whenever I get sick of my body for some reason my faith starts to struggle what is it because it ain't my faith healing the people it's their faith coming in contact with God and now it's my faith that needs to come in contact with God but with pressure it starts to put my faith in a box oh my brother brandom says that we limit we limit the supernatural because of our faith we limit the power of God in our life because of our faith and that's what pressure is trying to do but brother brandom says this here there are so many voices in the Earth today that is it is absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural there are are so many intellectual voices so there's so many other voices out there that is trying to influence us away from the voice of God and I read this early and this really really hit me between the eyes brother brandom says it depends or what kind of spirit that is in you what you're feeding on he says your life is feeding on something and I thought my that is profound my life is feeding on something and that that pressure can put push me to feed on something that I ordinary would not what I normally wouldn't feed upon you know I think brother W was talking about it the other night whenever you come to study or come to pray all of a sudden you want to get on your phone all of a sudden you want to check Facebook all of a sudden you want to do this you want to do that it's pressure pushing you away from a life substance and trying to get you to feed on something else but you see a voice can influence you in a different direction you know the Bible would say in Genesis 3:7 and unto Adam he said because thou was hearken unto the voice of thy wife and brother brandom says he heard the voice of God but listen to the voice of Eve and am I that's that's something that we can think upon we can hear the voice of God but if we're not listening to it and we're being persuaded by another voice we're not going to see the Supernatural and brother Brandon would say this and today the one reason the church is in the condition that it's in is because there are so many voices so many of the voices to attract the church from the voice of god Till It's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of God though it spoke right in their midst they perhaps wouldn't even understand it because it would be a foreign thing to them they have got themselves so centered on the voices of the day he says the voice of God would would speak but we're so focused on the other voices that we wouldn't even hear the voice of God we wouldn't understand him hope you're following me this evening we can hear the voice of God but if we're being influenced if our life our life substance is coming from something else we're not going to hear the voice of God though it spoke right in our midst it would not have an effect on our life you see brother Brandon would preach a message the voice of God in the last days and he goes through many voices he says politics has a voice and he says that voice has now a stronger pull than the voice of God he says in the influence of politics is taken over the church and he was talking about the president that was just now voted in and he says this here is an example of it or they wouldn't have voted him in he says everybody I think he said at the time there were 70 people 70% of people claimed to go to church he says even though 70 % of the people claim to go to church the influence was from politics and so he say he's letting you know that the voice there's an influence behind the voice then he talks about Hollywood he says Hollywood has a voice and it's taken over the world he says let somebody come out of Hollywood with something and you'll find it all over the country he talks about Matt Dylan and gunm smoke he says he says Matt Dylan was a coward he says he would wait outside of do City and he would shoot the guys in the back he says he shot 16 innocent men but he says and now the the now uh Hollywood has taken a hold of that and turns him into a hero and he says and now all of the little kitties is wearing the hats they've got the six shooters he says they can tell everything about Matt Dylan but they can't tell anything about Jesus he says the influence of it the voice of Hollywood has crept into the homes oh my we can look at that today hey he says Hollywood is just one place but the voice is into every home it's in every life and the same thing is today it's on our cell phones it's on our computers it's an influence where we can talk about this talk about that but what about the message what are we what is our life feeding upon you see brother the Brandon would then go on to talk about the dress he says no now Hollywood has powdered or influenced the way they dress the way they do their hair and he says now it's become the pattern he says now it's the pattern where everybody's got to dress that certain way everybody's got to do their hair the certain way he talks about uh John F Kennedy's wife he says she has become the pattern now everybody's wanting to dress like her what is it it's pressure and it's pushing somebody in a certain direction but brother Brandon would say this the church ought to know the voice of the trumpet of God on that but there's so much confusion because you see others do so examples don't pattern yourself after that kind of an example because it's perishable he's talking about Hollywood in the dress and he says always hear the voice of God what he says about it and I just love how he puts that even though the voice can be creeping and trying to influence you go back to the voice of God and see what the voice of God says about it and I'm so glad God gave us a message no matter the the the pressures no matter the influences we've got a TI poost we've got an absolute we've got something that we can come right back to and says right here's the final say no matter the intimidation no matter the influence no matter the pressure no matter the voices of the world I've got something I can line my life up with oh Hallelujah yes sir he's given us something that is our example oh my he's given us something that we can follow no matter the pressure I believe that the message can be an influence it can be what our what our life substance is coming from you may say wow I'm so glad I'm not influenced by Hollywood it's not my pattern but the same thing can come into a church you know brother brandham talks about Hollywood he talks about politics he talks about the the Eve's wife or Adam's wife he talks about so many voice say then he comes down to a church voice he says now the church has a voice too and if you're not careful you'll follow after a church voice instead of God's voice and I started to think about that and I thought my how could that be and it distract me I remember as a teenager that I had a complex that I I was never on drugs I was never on alcohol I never I I never smoked I never dranked and I never I didn't think God did anything for me I I never had didn't have a testimony and that was a complex that I had thinking that God never did anything for me and then it was Tim SCH that was preaching at our church one day and he says you know what many people think that they didn't go into the world they never drank they never smoked they never did this they never done that that God never did anything for them and I'm sitting there thinking wow I've been thinking that I've been thinking that for some time and he says but that's a greater testimony you're sitting in the midst of Satan's Eden and yet you're not defiled you see that was a voice that was whispering to me influencing me persuading me to push away what God has done for me come on now it's a voice that can come and say well since you're not doing this you're not doing that God's not working in your life since the church ain't doing this it ain't doing that God ain't in the church that's a church voice trying to persuade you away from the voice of God oh but I believe if the message is being preached we might not be dancing the aows might not be speaking in tongues but if the message the voice is being preached the life of God the supernal is here Among Us oh the shout of the king is in the camp the voice of God is being preached there somebody believing there's somebody receiving it and that's becoming their influence oh my it's become their influence yes but if we're not careful we look at something else and say my that's great that's wonderful but God ain't doing nothing for me oh my but that doesn't mean God ain't doing something for you you might be in a certain season you might be in a spot where you're not hearing God so loud but he might be in a still Small Voice the Supernatural is still there you just got to make sure you're feeding on the right thing don't let the pressure get to you you know I was I was studying all these things today I started to think about it how many was here uh two two Sunday nights ago it was it last Sunday night but the Sunday night before and our dad was preaching on healing and the Lord just come and started to move um I think there was many miracles that was taking place we was up here praying for the people and many people were crying God was touching and that was great but what about Wednesday night you I started to think upon these lines what about Wednesday night we didn't have one one uh dried out not one person crying nobody come up for prayer nobody came to the altar but Dad was teaching he was teach preaching on Christmas and on the son of man did that mean that the supernatural wasn't with us like it was Sunday night the same God that was moving up here Sunday night was the same God that was moving Wednesday night he may have been working in a different way but it was the same God the same Supernatural the same voice coming and touching Hearts it don't matter where you are at If the message is being preached If the message is being accepted that is the voice of God that's the life of Christ coming on the inside and living its Life Through Your Vessel but then we move on to Sunday morning here Dad preaching again up the Sunday morning's message was powerful and that was wonderful but Sunday night come along and we have a Christmas program and what happens we had a Christmas play we wasn't here we was at the house because our kids were sick and we watched the Christmas play and I felt the presence of God has come in our house then brother Merl started doing his skits and the anointing of God just come down it's the same Supernatural if we're dancing the aisles if we're speaking in tongues if we're doing cartwheels or if it's just teaching if it's just a play if it's that if it's the message of God coming across it is the life of God it's the supernatural oh we put God in a box where we got to be shouting we got to be speaking in tongues but what about the word that's coming forth come on now we can't just put it off upon all of the emotion and let let the teaching alone the same anointing that is with the emotion and the dancing is the same anointing that is with the teaching come on now it's a pressure that is trying to persuade you that if we're not doing these things if it's not a camp meeting God ain't speaking to us the same God that speaks at our youth camp is the same God that is speaking here tonight the same God that speaks at Easter is the same God that is speaking here on Sunday mornings on Sunday nights on Wednesday nights if for Willing that feed off of the right thing oh my we don't want to be feeding off of a church voice and Fa to hear the voice amen oh come on what do you mean brother Josh we can feed off of a personality we can feed off of a gift we can feed off these things and Fa to feed off of the the message of the hour you know I know Dad talked about whenever he first come the pony he could sing he could preach he can play and he was the H of py everybody just loved dad but there was no substance there he needed something to to to to feed the people then once he come into the message of the hour there was a different attraction people wasn't attracted to his singing no more they weren't attracted to his playing no more but now they was attracted to the message come on now you got to make sure you're attracted by the right thing we're not attracted by gifts we're attracted by the message of the hour oh my but you see pressure can push us in way you see here's the quote I was talking about brother Brom says in the system of Eli a priest instead of a prophet the prophet is the word the priest was the church it's God in such a place till it begin to lose that the word is forign to the people they get it they cannot speak it they don't understand it because they're not trained to it Paul said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who will prepare himself to battle the people are so trained to a church voice a church trumpet we've got more in our Sunday school than the rest of them that don't mean a thing we got more in our denomination than the rest of them's got we're the biggest among the denominations see that's the kind of voice that the people are trained for oh my they're trained for a certain voice that they miss the voice of God oh my but I believe that there is a true bride not the false bride not the false fine but there is a true bride that is attracted to one thing that is the voice oh my I start I was thinking on these things you know God used a donkey to speak one time God used a burning bush to speak one time and so now if God wants to speak in a certain way I want to be willing to listen to what God is saying oh my because if we're not careful the gr the grass is greener on the other side of the fence and what that does is is it gets you in uncontent when you're not willing to step there and feed off of where you're at but you're trying to feed off this one you're trying to feed off that one you're trying to feed off this one and you're failing to see what God is doing right in your midst you know brother brandom talked about how the church people is always thanking God for what he did yesterday looking forward to what he's going to do tomorrow but fa to see what he's doing right now oh come on somebody we can be sitting in a church pew but looking over across the country saying wow I wish I was there they've got the power of God the power of God is where the message is being preached I'm preaching now I'm talking about pressure that is trying to get you and content with what God is doing in your life oh my I hope this is okay tonight like I said these are some things I've been preaching and so I'm I put everything together and I hope it makes sense tonight you see remember when brother Brandon was preaching letting go off the pressure and I talked about this a few times ago when I preached and I and as you listen to that tape brother brandom is preaching he's preaching then it it cuts off it comes back on and he's praying and and I never caught that until I was listening to it a few months ago and brother brandom explains what happens he's he's and he starts to pray and he says Lord while I was preaching letting off the pressure the devil thought he could run me from this pull pit and he cut off the power and so the power went off but brother brandom says he kept on preaching because he knew there was somebody out there that needed to hear him and he says as the last person come to the altar the power come back on and I thought my it was pressure way back then trying to get the prophet to let go and get out of the pull pit and it's pressure today upon the fivefold ministry you can't preach that you can't quote that quote you can't say this you can't say that but as the prophet defined the pressure there is still a five-fold Ministry today that is defying the pressure and letting the people know that the message ain't a preacher's message it's your message this say Malachi 4 ain't just the pastors it's your Prophet this is your inheritance this is your power it's your anointing oh my but what happens is we try to get a few holy men and we get the anointing away from the people the anointing a't for a few holy men the message come to do away with that and says it's a bride body it's a bride body the anointing that is behind the pulpit it's in every Mama it's in every Daddy it's in every teacher it's in every preacher it's not just one man but it's a multi membered body but it's pressure that tries to influence you and say it's not for you it's just for a few men that's not the case it's for you if you've got a heart to receive the word you've got something that is compatible with the supernatural if you're willing to feed off of it oh my brother Brandon would say h this is a portion of the quote I was talking about he says it may seem very strange father very simple you make things so simple that we won't Aram because they that raised out of their seat and come on the invitation because that Satan tried to keep them from doing it every effort he could put forth he tried to do it but he lost so it wasn't just for the brandom Under Pressure to get out of the pull pit but it was the people that was under pressure not to not to receive what he was saying oh my so it ain't just the Pullin that is under attack the congregation is under attack it's putting question marks there I can't believe that that this one can get the Holy Ghost anymore what it's pressure there's some saying God don't fill with the Holy Ghost anymore some saying that that that the message did away with the with the tongues and with the dancing that's not the case it's pressure trying to get us away from what the message has brought us you see God still heals the sick God still fills with the Holy Ghost but you see somebody has to defy the pressure you see that the person that was in the congregation brother Brom says Satan lost because they got up and come anyways and I think my let me be that person here in the middle of Le the causes Satan to lose that he can come with mind battles he can come with influences come with intimidation come with pressure but I said no say not today I've got a voice that I'm attracted to oh my the Bible would say a man Matthew 24 and 28 for wheresoever the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered together oh my where the carcass is they're the Eagles not a gift no not a personality but the carcass that's good that's good oh my let me say this if somebody is attracted around a gift what are they come on now if the Eagles are gathered around the carcass what are they that's gathered run a gift all right all right I I'll go on now he didn't appoint us to a gift he pointed us to a carcass it says here's the word we're not following man anymore we're following the word oh hallelujah oh my but now it's pressure that comes and he says you can't go preach for this hope this is okay this evening I've been studying going these things and brother Brandon I I don't got the quote in front of me I wish I would have got it here but brother brandham says that it's my job to stand in between them and unite him he says this one's against this one that one's against this one this one's fighting this one and he says as long as you're fighting each other the Devils don't even you don't got to fight you on and there's so much of that going on today I think that's the attitude of the Bride this one's fighting this one this one's against this one let us stand together and say we are all the Bride of Jesus Christ following the same message you might see it that way you might see it this way you might think it that way but we are all a part of one body that is Jesus Christ oh the Life of Christ is in my heart just like it's in your heart the anointing is in my church just like it's in your church we're all one body oh my we're all one body you see but we're going to Humble ourself to something we can look at Daniel the pressure was trying to get Daniel to hold humble himself to the king and that's exactly what pressure today is trying to do is get your Allegiance away from the word and on to something else you see brother brandom talks about the natural he says your first steps you're led by somebody he says your last steps you're led by somebody he says as he start to walk you might fall down but the same hand that is leading you picks you back up and he says you get to a certain age then you're handed over to his teacher that teacher leads you through an education then the teacher gives you back to your mother where she makes you a housewife or you turn over to your father where he teaches you about business he says we're LED every step of the way but then he comes down and then he says this here but he says but now who leads you he says that's the question now we're all led by something tonight we have to be were LED on just think about that now who is leading you now why does driving you what is pushing you is it a job is it Sports is it is it money is it this is a popularity what is leading you I believe if we're led by the right thing we're going to be going in the right direction you see what brother Brandon would say this a sheep is perfectly helpless he cannot go by himself that's the reason God likened him likened his believing children Hunter sheep they've got to be guided but watch what's guiding you don't be don't get a goat he'll walk you to the slaughter pin God never gives us goats he gives us his son the holy spirit to guide us he is our God not some man-made herdsman oh I love that not some man-made herdsman but a God given herdsman who feeds the Sheep upon sheep food who feeds the Sheep upon sheep food but he's letting you know we're all Guided by something make sure you're not Guided by a goat come on if you're Guided by a goat he's leading you to the slaughter pin but if you're Guided by the spirit of Truth is going to lead you into all truth all truth you see we're all being led by something but we got a choice of what we're going to be led by and brother the Brandon whenever he was overseas I think he was in Israel excuse me I've been having some ssts so just bear it with me tonight but brother Brandon was talking about how whenever he was over in the east and he seen a shepherd with some sheep and he says he was watching these sheep as they were coming into the city and he says he seen the all the cars started to stop and the shepherd was bringing the Sheep across the street and everything and he says then they started to go up the city to the market and he says over there the market is like a like a neighborhood market or or a farmers market he says everything is outside for everybody to go and look the bread the the the meat everything like that is all outside and he says he's watching the sheep and he says okay here's the riot now once those sheep see the goodies they're going to go crazy and he's watching them waiting for this to take place and he says he's watching he's watching and they all the sheep look at the goodies but then look right back at the shepherd and just kept on following the shepherd He says not one of them went to get the goodies but followed the shepherd and then he says this oh if I only had known their language I would have stopped the traffic myself and preached them a sermon on what I had just seen when you are sheep that belong to the great Shepherd you follow right along in each of his steps just like those sheeps did you won't be tempted to turn aside for some big flower of a church or listen to the voice of some DD or PhD or lld but you will stay with the shepherd the Bible says the Sheep know his voice and and they follow him but a stranger's voice that caused them to flee and run after the true sh Shepherd praise God he says if you're a true sheep following the true Shepherd you can see those other things but it's not the attraction the shepherd's the attraction oh you can see this pop up that pop up this pressure that influence that persuasion but our eyes is on one thing that is Jesus Christ they same yesterday today and forever and that is leading us all the way to the coming of the Lord you believe that tonight oh my you see so I like how the Bible puts that that that that there was division among the people because of him and I was just I was reading that on my devotions and that just when I'm sure the preachers could can relate you can just read something something just stands out to you you're like whoa I've read that before but there was division among the people because of him he wasn't bringing the division but there was division because the people had their own own ideas brother the brandom says they were trained the priests the preachers were trained in the coming of the law coming of the Messiah but they had their own interpretation on how he was to come oh my think about that now they knew he was coming but it had to be a certain way oh my many people do the same thing the church services have to be a certain way we know he's going to come but this has got to happen that's got to happen this is going to take place going to miss him if you're looking for something to take place you might miss him but if he's speaking if he's walking the ow don't fail to miss him look for him he's walking the ow he's still talking and taking taking the needs before the Thro you see what was causing the division was the people's opinions you see they couldn't submit themselves to divine revelation you look at Nicodemus the Bible would say in John 3 and 2 the same come to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know thou are a teacher from God no denying it we know you're a teacher from God for no man can do these things th Le unless God be with him and I could just say you have compassion for this guy because he really seen him wow there's something different about you Jesus no man can do these things unless God is with him how can you explain it but the pressure was so strong the pressure was so strong that he couldn't follow him he had to turn away because of the pressure oh my don't let us be that way that we can see something taking place but all might because because the pressure we fail to see Jesus hope this is okay tonight you see but the brandom talks about the denominations he says he they have the they have the they have the word right with them but then they formed their own way of it then the children accepted it he says the children accepted and now the spirit of God is bringing forth truth but they can't receive it because they're so the they're tied down by what the father's brought and I thought my each generation is going to get worse and going to get worse and going to get worse andless you stick with the message that's such an assurance to a parent that if I stick with the message my children is going to be okay if I stick with us sayith the Lord my children is going to see the rapture my children is going to walk on the streets of Glory but brother bandom says they had the word with him but they started to mix their own ideas with it then right after the Next Generation they was totally off and brother brandom says they're doing the same thing today that make it so complicated that they fail to see what the spirit is really seeing you see brother Brandon was say God can give a man a start and give him a Ministry and the first thing you know he says he will go to catering to what others are saying and he says the first thing you know is the Lord will take his hand off of him and take his anointing to something to somebody else and he says here and then he will try to find him another man somebody that will do it he's got to find somebody that will take his word take divine revelation and won't move with it stay right on that word that's the way he does it he's always doing it that way he says he can give a man a Ministry and give him something but as as soon as he starts to cater with somebody else's opinions the anointing comes from him and he goes to find somebody else and I think my that's not just for preachers that's for us as well that's for mas and for daddies and teenagers as long as you're catering to these other ideas it's going to pull the anointing from you come on now but the anointing is in the message of the hour oh mind you see we're going to Humble oursel to something or someone we're sheep we're being led by something but you see the the uh the Bible would say and this is I just love the scripture this is just stood out to me several times in Revelations 3 and8 I counsel thee so buy of me gold tried on the fire that thou mayest be rich white ra and white and white rment that thou mayest be cloth that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear anoint thine eyes with Isa that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent and behold to stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me he's letting the church know if you can repent I will come and Sh with you but there's nothing in the the make Believers the unbelievers to Humble themselves but there is something on the inside of the Bride that is willing to humble themsel and that just stood out to me if you're willing to humble yourself then you're able to open the door then once you open the door then the voice can come in and Sh with you and I say Lord let me humble myself to every part of the message every Avenue of my heart every Avenue of my house of my marriage of my family I'm humbling myself so that the voice can come in and St with me not the natural voice not not for the prom's voice but the word the message let it take control of every aspect of my life but it's going to take humility to hear the voice you see the the Bible would say in 2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves yes amen excuse me he's making a proclamation he's he's claiming a people if my people which are called by my name shall humble them themselves he's letting this people know if you're called by my name there's something inside that is willing to humble yourself and oh my if you're a true part if you're truly a part of this bride there's something on the inside that says Amen to every part of the message if it hurts it hurts if it cuts it cuts if it digs it digs but there's something on the inside that is humbling myself to it oh my I'll bring this down to a close here in a few minutes just bear with my bear with my voice here uh you see brother Brandon well the Bible would tell us here that the Pharisees started to pray and in Luke 18 And1 the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself he's talking about two people that come and started to pray and the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I'm not as the other men are exorts unjust adulterers even as this Publican so the Bible is saying there's two men that come to pray a Pharisee and a Publican the publicans over here and he says I fast twice I I fast twice in the week I gave tithes all that I possess and here he is throwing up to God what he's done his knowledge what he's achieved what I'm doing and here God says what are you doing I'm not coming this way I'm coming to the humble the next verse and the Publican standing a far off would not lift up so much as his eyes into heaven but smoted upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this is Jesus talking I tell you this man went down to his to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalt exalteth himself shall be a based and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted and let that that that is letting us know if you're willing to lay everything aside all of your achievements all of your smarts all of your gifts all of your popularity and come humble then watch God exalt hey I want as an evangelist I want God to exalt my Ministry not me if I exalt my Ministry somebody's going to tear it down if if if a pastor exalts himself somebody's going to tear it down but if God exalts it if God exalts a marriage nobody is going to tear it apart if God exalts a church nobody has a right to close the doors if God is doing something nobody can tear it down oh my brother brandom says here it won't be you exalting yourself but it would be God himself doing the exalting oh if you can just come humble then it won't be you exalting yourself it's God Luke 1: 52 and he put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree you know I've been listening to uh why had to be Shepherds and brother Brandon just goes through the whole message letting you know that uh the Shepherds were they didn't have much smarts they were unlearned but he says he passed all of the smart guys all the ones that were learned all the ones that had an education passed all of them up and come to the Shepherds and I was listening to that I started crying I said Lord thank you for letting me know I might not be smart I might not be learned I might not have an education but you still come to me you let me know that the Messiah is on Earth but the brandom says the highest of Heaven come to the lowest of Earth with the greatest message you know what that message was he says Messiah is on earth now not coming the scribes and the Pharisees were pushing it off into the future he's coming he's coming he's coming but the Shepherds come saying he's here where's he at he's here and as long as they follow the Angel's voice they would find the Messiah yes and you know I've read that story many times and I in my mind I always thought it was a group of angels that come to the Shepherds for some reason but you go and read it says the angel of the Lord come to the Shepherds right oh the same angel that was coming to brother Brandon with the message was the same angel that come to the Shepherds and says hey the messiah's on Earth he's on Earth if you will follow my instructions you will find him laying in the manger in swaddling clothes the other ones are missing him but if you're humble enough to listen if you're humble enough to listen you will find humility W wrapped and swaddling clothes and if you think about that he revealed himself in humility so that he can be wrapped once again in humility that's just beautiful he unveiled himself so that he can come in your skins he's not coming to the smart and the educated he's coming to the humble and it's not it's not that God can't reveal himself to the smart he can't reveal himself to the Arrogant that's who he's bypassing is the Arrogant you can be smart and still be humble you can have money and still be humble but a lot of times the arrogance he comes with that but he's bypassing the arrogant and coming to the humble oh my and I'm humble enough to believe that this is thus sayith the Lord this is my absolute brother bam says notice the highest Heavens hastening to honor honor I love that honor Earth's most humble and unlearned he's going to exalt The Humble think about that all the scribes and Pharisees were exalted with their knowledge but what exalted the Shepherds a message what's exalted the bride in this generation a message we're both bone of his bone flesh of his flesh power of his power we have become him once exalted us the message we're not trying to work something up it's the message that is exalting Us in this generation as the musicians come in James 1:9 let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted let him with low degree Rejoice because you have been exalted 1 Peter 5: 6 humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time in due time you might feel pretty low but don't worry you're being exalted brother Brandon would say you showed me a church that's humble real humble not arrogant a church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling herself before God and letting God just work through us he said show me a church that's humble I'll show you a church that's got the super natural oh let us be a church that's humble let us not be arrogant well we got W Martin as our pastor we got Kobe Martin as our song leader we got Austin Stout as our drum player let's not be arrogant and say Lord we got the message of the hour that's our claim the fame how might not be popular paon e might be in the middle of nowhere you might not even heard of New Life out reach but the message is here and where the message is there's liberty and if the message is in your home there's liberty If the message is in your family there's liberty don't let the pressure tell you otherwise don't let the pressure take away your Liberty don't let it take away your Liberty cuz without Liberty you can't you're going to be defeated but this message has liberated us brother brandom says notice and Elijah humbled himself and stayed with with what God Said in such a way catch this God said in such a way that it pleased God to take that same Spirit from him and promised to shove it three times down the road from here amen and he did it he sure did Elijah so humbled himself and stayed with the word that had pleased God to use that Spirit three more times my let me be so humble that I'm that that God is pleased with me brother brandom says God hides himself when a simple little washwoman or ordinary man ordinary man with his dinner under his arm kiss his wife children goodbye and go up there maybe hide himself in that man to do something that AR Archbishop would not would know nothing about you don't hear him with no blow horns and send out God just gets the glory that's all the simple hear it and are glad the simple hear it he says if God can find a simple man he can do something that the Archbishop can't even do do let's bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord thank you for giving us Simplicity Lord Lord you revealed yourself in Simplicity Lord the Bible says you spoke in the common man's language the Common People heard it Lord Lord in this generation you spoken our language Lord but we can understand him you spoke in simple terms Lord we want to say thank you Lord may we humble ourself Lord more the more every day father Lord as we listen to the messages listen to the tapes father Lord May there be a heart to Humble ourselves so you can exalt us Lord we're going to rule one day father we're going to set on the throne Lord help us today as we fight the pressure in Jesus name amen your eyes can we stand and sing this tonight for [Music] look for in his [Music] wonderful

we go straight light yes my lord of his [Music] glory I don't guess I never heard that one quote where he talks the B about the man-made herdsman and then the Sheep and the true Shepherd is the attraction that's pretty good the true [Music] Shepherd he's the attraction he's what we're looking at today he's our influence is that not what Revelations 10 is Revelations 10 is the influence of Heaven the influence of an open book the influence of divine revelation the influence of the Lamb is here on the earth when you when you see that everything else begins to pale everything everything else is that right and that's why the the prophet said we are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man we're feeding on that there's where there's where we gain our strength from oh let us never let us never become discontent with what God's given us never let us be discontent in our families with what this message is never let us get discontent amen with the beauty of what's G God has given us in this message lots of pressures out there oh but there's another pressure and it's pushing us up higher and higher and higher in Rapture Hallelujah that's what he's doing now are we fighting devils and I you know I I I I really enjoyed the message tonight and I you know we are fighting those Devils trying to keep us out of those heavenly places there there there there is an influence trying to get Daniel to quit praying and seeking God he knew the scripture says he knew by the books that it was time it was time for deliverance and as he began to pray amen it seemed it seemed like his prayer was not even reaching the ceiling and he prayed and he prayed and he prayed and he prayed 21 days later here comes the angel and says you were heard the first day yeah and because of your words God sent Michael to come and fight that Prince of Persia and I am here to deliver your message to you so the influences of the enemy is very real but the power of this word is even greater Revelation is you are destined to hear this revealed word you are destined to hear from God stay there don't get up don't turn around don't back up don't look to the right or to the left
