[26:50] but turn with me in your Bibles to the
[26:51] book of Galatians chapter 6.
[26:54] we'll begin reading verse 14.
[26:57] just want to thank brother Wendell I
[26:59] just was going to let him know that I
[27:00] was just come passing through and uh I
[27:04] hadn't been here in years and so I think
[27:07] I was last year around four years ago or
[27:09] so just uh for the meetings and I hadn't
[27:12] been here since and I just was heading
[27:14] towards kind of Northeast and just
[27:17] wanted to try to take a little bit of
[27:19] time and visit with with the Wendell and
[27:21] the rest of the folks here and we just
[27:24] appreciate the hospitality from Brother
[27:27] Wendell amen sister Fresco amen God
[27:30] bless you God bless the church amen I
[27:32] got to talk to a brother Jeremy about
[27:33] getting one about this size I I feel I
[27:36] feel good about that size amen
[27:39] amen it feels good to have enough space
[27:41] amen I've preached on some that was
[27:44] barely enough for my Bible and I
[27:45] preached and some that's this big so
[27:47] praise the Lord Galatians chapter six we
[27:51] just want to read this verse of
[27:53] scripture and hopefully there'll be
[27:54] something said here tonight that will
[27:56] bless your hearts I believe as the
[27:58] prophet said if you come expecting
[28:00] something that you will get what you
[28:02] expect
[28:03] and so I'm expecting a good time
[28:07] if you're expecting a good time you
[28:09] won't leave disappointed
[28:10] amen if you expect to find fault you
[28:13] will find it in this Texas boy even
[28:15] though I wasn't born in Texas I am I am
[28:18] from Texas so and that's okay it got
[28:20] quiet in here I can tell all right amen
[28:23] Galatians chapter 6 verse 14.
[28:26] it says but God forbid that I should
[28:28] Glory
[28:29] saving the cross of our Lord Jesus
[28:31] Christ
[28:33] by whom the world
[28:35] is crucified unto me and I unto the
[28:39] world
[28:40] it says for in Christ Jesus neither

[29:14] written about Paul

[29:17] what I mean by that there was things
[29:19] spread around that wasn't even true
[29:20] about Paul
[29:22] but here he's saying here right here

[30:50] of that tonight
[30:52] amen I'm going to read this quote
[30:53] brother Branham says this he says I
[30:54] think
[30:56] I want to paint this picture he says I
[30:58] think of what it will what it will be at
[31:00] that last supper
[31:03] and it's set there in glory
[31:05] it says and we've all overcome notice
[31:08] what he says we've all overcome and set
[31:10] across the table from one another
[31:13] he says I will look across the table and
[31:15] see these old battle scarred Saints
[31:17] sitting there
[31:19] tears of joy running down their cheeks
[31:21] he says we'll just have to reach across
[31:25] the table and take one another by the
[31:27] hand
[31:28] I want to put you there tonight for just
[31:30] a moment I want you to push the world
[31:32] out of the way and let's come into this
[31:34] Sanctuary here tonight I know you might
[31:36] be a little tired we'll not try to hold
[31:38] you too long but we want to hold you as
[31:40] long as the Lord wants but I want you to
[31:42] put yourself there for a moment he says
[31:44] and I will say oh brother I'm so glad to
[31:46] see it just think of that long supper
[31:49] table and then the king will come out in
[31:52] his Beauty in his beautiful garments and
[31:54] wipe all the tears from our eyes saying
[31:56] don't you cry no more we're all here now
[32:00] I love how he puts this he says it's all
[32:03] over the last prayer meetings is now
[32:05] done it says no more fasting no more
[32:07] praying we're all home
[32:09] now enter into the joys of the Lord he
[32:11] says that's what I want to hear that's
[32:14] what I'm working hard day and night all
[32:18] this time that I can do
[32:20] what is he trying to help us understand
[32:22] here brothers and sisters that that is a
[32:24] reality that that is coming brothers and
[32:27] sisters I've told the church back home I
[32:30] said that there when we get to the other
[32:31] side there's not going to be one vacant
[32:33] chair at that marriage supper not one
[32:36] and every chair I believe has reserved
[32:40] on it amen that you know brothers and
[32:43] sisters that's your name Hallelujah if
[32:45] it's if it's on the Lamb's Book of Life
[32:47] then you've got a chair at that marriage
[32:50] supper amen we're looking forward to
[32:53] that moment but we don't get there just
[32:55] by chance we don't get there brothers
[32:57] and sisters just happen to show up we've
[33:00] got to go through the trials of Life
[33:02] we've got to go through the scars of
[33:04] life and tonight I want to take this out
[33:06] of that first part that we read there
[33:08] and call this battle scarred Saints
[33:10] battle scarred Saints and I believe what
[33:14] Paul is putting out here and he talks
[33:16] about this in verse 17 it's from
[33:18] henceforth let no man trouble me it says
[33:21] for I bear in my body the marks of the
[33:23] Lord Jesus the marks these this word
[33:26] mark means it could be a cut on this in
[33:28] the surface or to to be uh to be punched
[33:31] or to also it shows the recognition of
[33:34] ownership
[33:35] I begin to think about that
[33:37] a recognition of ownership
[33:40] brothers and sisters we've been marked
[33:42] have you been marked do you have the
[33:45] token
[33:46] then you're Mark brothers and sisters
[33:48] and also it's talking about a scar of
[33:50] service it's this Mark and what about
[33:52] him continuously says when we reach
[33:54] across that table we see all these down
[33:56] there he says them old battles card
[33:58] veterans
[34:00] can you imagine what it's going to be
[34:01] like when we get on the other side
[34:02] brothers and sisters see each and every
[34:05] one sitting at that table and what a
[34:07] story we're going to have to tell
[34:09] amen we're going to have a story to tell
[34:11] it says in these battle scar veterans
[34:13] holding one another's hands weeping for
[34:15] Joy he says won't that be wonderful
[34:20] and he says oh I can hear announcement
[34:21] of silver in the blast of trumpet and
[34:23] out comes the king and his Beauty all
[34:26] this Majestic robe around how many walks
[34:28] along the table and he says and he'll
[34:30] take his own hand and wipe the tears out
[34:33] from our eyes and say don't cry now it's
[34:36] all over
[34:38] he says that's the day I'm living for
[34:41] yeah that's why I press and beg and
[34:43] plead for lost souls
[34:45] amen this is all that I that I know how
[34:48] to do to get them to the Lord Jesus he
[34:50] says then I want to I want to set down
[34:53] at his feet and hear him like these
[34:56] people did so I began to think about how
[34:58] what a time it must it's going to be
[35:01] brothers and sisters when we get over
[35:02] there but how many has ever heard of a
[35:04] veteran someone that's maybe been in the
[35:06] war or something that I begin to look
[35:08] this up just for information and I said
[35:11] how long do you have to be in there to
[35:15] be considered a veteran because I've
[35:16] seen some young guys as veterans I've
[35:19] seen Young when I say young they look
[35:22] young but I begin to look and I thought
[35:24] well they just look young they're called
[35:25] Veterans I always picture the veterans
[35:27] old guys look like me you know gray hair
[35:28] and missing hair or something one or two
[35:33] I'll begin to look this up says it says
[35:36] even in in the U.S 180 days of active
[35:40] duty not counting training
[35:43] or
[35:44] one day
[35:46] in a combat zone all right
[35:50] one day
[35:53] in the combat zone
[35:55] oh brothers and sisters I'm seeing
[35:58] battle scarred veterans here tonight
[36:01] how many here has been in the battle at
[36:03] least for one day
[36:05] I'm talking about the combat zone I'm
[36:07] talking about the place where you know
[36:09] those fiery darts are headed your
[36:12] direction
[36:13] if you've been there then brothers and
[36:15] sisters you may have scars you may have
[36:18] something brothers and sisters upon your
[36:20] spiritual body as it were showing proof
[36:23] that you've been in battle
[36:25] amen oh I begin to look at this and just
[36:28] begin to get excited one day Hallelujah
[36:30] in the battle I just love that I just
[36:33] love how God puts this but he he wants
[36:35] us to understand something he wants us
[36:37] to really look at this and see what a
[36:39] wound I want to kind of just
[36:40] differentiate a wound from a scar
[36:44] because a lot of times we have wounds
[36:47] and not scars yet
[36:49] now a wound is a wound is a rapid onset
[36:52] of injury that involves lacerations or a
[36:55] punctured skin
[36:56] and I begin to think there's a mighty
[36:58] difference between a wound and a scar if
[37:01] I was to ask you maybe here tonight
[37:03] something about something that happened
[37:05] in your life that caused a scar on your
[37:07] physical body
[37:09] you would go back to that moment
[37:13] that you were in
[37:14] and start reminiscing the things that
[37:17] took place that led up to that moment
[37:21] so I have a scar right now on my fist
[37:25] from plumbing plumbing it as as a
[37:28] plumber I was underneath the sink I'll
[37:29] go back to the story because I was a
[37:31] young man living at home just started in
[37:34] the plumbing career laying underneath
[37:35] the sink had a pair of channel locks on
[37:37] on us on a faucet and I grabbed a hold
[37:39] of it to turn and that thing slipped and
[37:42] this this part of my fist snagged
[37:44] something so sharp down there lacerated
[37:46] it was wide open
[37:49] they had to take a a butterfly bandage
[37:51] as it were to hold that thing back
[37:53] together I didn't go to the doctor we
[37:55] didn't hardly see doctors mom and dad
[37:56] just said hold it together let it let it
[37:59] let it heal up
[38:01] but I began to think about this now this
[38:04] is not a wound
[38:06] this is a scar
[38:08] a wound would be something that is still
[38:11] hurting
[38:12] a wound is something that is still has a
[38:15] potential to be opened
[38:17] so brothers and sisters my question
[38:19] tonight is is there wounds in your life
[38:21] that may still be there that when we
[38:24] begin to talk about this that it still
[38:26] hurts
[38:28] or is that has it healed enough where
[38:30] it's become a scar
[38:32] and it's okay brothers and sisters
[38:34] whether you're this one or that one but
[38:36] to know that if you give it time what
[38:39] has to happen that wound over time
[38:41] actually becomes a scar
[38:44] now you can look back at that and you're
[38:46] not as hurt as you used to be
[38:48] amen come on we can talk about these
[38:51] things because a scar is a mark That's
[38:53] remaining after the injured tissue was
[38:55] even healed
[38:56] hallelujah we're scarred brothers and
[38:59] sisters they're scars on us you've been
[39:01] through some stuff
[39:03] you fought some battles brothers and
[39:05] sisters you've had the hard times of
[39:08] your life where you didn't know if he
[39:09] was going to make it through as it were
[39:11] but it was by the grace of God that you
[39:14] came through at one more time that you
[39:16] had the breath that you could stand up
[39:18] and say I'm going on anyhow some way or
[39:21] another I'm Gonna Make It To Heaven
[39:24] what was that brothers and sisters now
[39:26] you're now you're looking at a scar now
[39:29] I'm looking back at the moments in my
[39:31] life where it felt like people begin to
[39:33] leave me
[39:34] but you know what I'm not no I'm no
[39:36] longer hurt over that
[39:38] amen why because now it's just a scar
[39:42] it's not a wound
[39:44] I believe we need to allow the great
[39:45] physician to come down
[39:47] and heal the wounds
[39:49] because we've all had them at some time
[39:51] in our life we've had something brothers
[39:53] and sisters that cut us so deep
[39:55] we thought we thought somehow or another
[39:57] we don't know if we're going to make
[39:59] that through that we've had those
[40:01] moments but what is that it's showing
[40:03] brothers and sisters each and every one
[40:05] of us are going to face tests
[40:07] but we need the great physician to do
[40:09] his work
[40:10] and what does he do he can take those
[40:12] wounds and he can turn them into scars
[40:15] why because he's gone
[40:17] see many and maybe have been wounded by
[40:19] another
[40:20] by someone's words
[40:22] question is have you let have you let
[40:24] him heal you okay
[40:27] what about his scars what about his
[40:29] scars
[40:30] what about his scars
[40:33] when I think about his scars when I
[40:34] think brothers and sisters about those
[40:36] nails and we can go to the Natural point
[40:39] and we could see I believe it hurt that
[40:41] body
[40:43] but what about when he began to cry out
[40:46] on that cross my God my God why hast
[40:49] Thou forsaken me
[40:50] why did he cry those out why because
[40:53] brothers and sisters he was taking on
[40:54] your sin and my sin that hurt brothers
[40:58] and sisters I want to tell you that hurt
[41:01] but he did it because he knew that there
[41:03] would be a bride that would come out of
[41:05] each and every single age that would
[41:07] overcome the oppression and the
[41:09] depression of the enemy he knew that
[41:11] each and every one of you would set foot
[41:13] on this Earth and begin to proclaim the
[41:16] good news of the Gospel
[41:18] oh brothers and sisters he knew that I
[41:21] want you to know you're on a battlefield
[41:22] the prophet said you're not on a picnic
[41:24] you're on a Battlefield
[41:26] if you woke up this morning expecting a
[41:28] picnic well
[41:29] did you hear the gunshots
[41:31] did you hear did you hear the Warfare
[41:33] going on
[41:34] the question is have you come through it
[41:36] brothers and sisters God has ordained
[41:39] you to come through these things
[41:41] the word through means to get through
[41:43] some to manage to deal with a difficult
[41:45] situation or to stay alive until it's
[41:48] over because I'm just going to look at
[41:50] you tonight and say stay alive
[41:52] look at someone say stay alive stay
[41:55] alive you might be in it you it feels so
[41:57] hot and heavy but stay alive
[42:00] if you're still alive you'll come
[42:02] through
[42:03] oh brothers and sisters we gotta we got
[42:05] to do everything that's within us to
[42:07] stay alive
[42:08] you're going to be in difficult
[42:09] situations
[42:11] you're going to have to go through those
[42:12] times
[42:14] and what has to happen brothers and
[42:15] sisters these trials and these tests
[42:17] come and you will either break down or
[42:20] you will break through
[42:22] which one are you going to be tonight
[42:24] are you the one is this a new life
[42:26] church a new life Outreach that will
[42:28] break through the struggle it'll break
[42:31] through every demonic power that comes
[42:34] this way what has to happen is there's
[42:36] got to be a seed of life down inside of
[42:39] your soul that says I will not fall
[42:42] listen and if I do so God will give me
[42:44] the strength to stand back up
[42:47] what has to happen there's got to be a
[42:49] whole makeup inside of your soul saying
[42:51] I'm going to break through not break
[42:53] down because the devil wants you to
[42:55] break down
[42:56] the devil wants you to sit at home and
[42:58] break down the devil wants you to sit in
[43:00] your chair or sit in your Pew and break
[43:02] down
[43:03] but God says I will have a bride that
[43:05] will break through
[43:06] [Music]
[43:07] I believe that with all my heart
[43:10] Hallelujah to get through it means that
[43:12] you will be able to do something
[43:16] to survive something
[43:18] if you're going through a hard time and
[43:20] someone tells you how many has ever
[43:22] heard this you'll get through this
[43:27] we've heard it and I believe people mean
[43:29] well
[43:31] if you really take what this means is
[43:33] you know what you're going to be an
[43:34] overcomer through this
[43:36] you what I mean you're going to get
[43:38] through this you're going to be you're
[43:39] going to come out on the other side and
[43:41] look back at this
[43:43] and recognize it was the grace of God
[43:45] that got you through
[43:47] see some of us may even wonder why do we
[43:49] have to go why does it feel like
[43:51] everything has to go wrong how has ever
[43:53] questioned that
[43:55] do we not serve the Living God
[43:57] does he not have control of the universe
[44:00] and then sometimes we say why am I going
[44:02] through this pain
[44:04] come on if you're human you probably had
[44:06] that thought once in your life
[44:08] I believe sometimes the simple thought
[44:10] of that is sometimes these difficult
[44:12] moments will bring you closer to God
[44:15] than the blessings will
[44:18] Amen in these hardships these moments in
[44:21] your life what does it begin to do it
[44:23] begins to make you get down on your
[44:25] knees and it begins to make you call out
[44:27] on God why because you need someone
[44:30] that's greater than your pain
[44:32] amen you need someone that's greater
[44:34] than your difficulties
[44:36] amen hallelujah I believe he'll do that
[44:39] trials drive us to our knees
[44:42] these knees of Prayer
[44:44] what we must do we must reach out we
[44:47] must call on the one that's able to
[44:48] bring order back to disorder
[44:51] amen how many how many knows he's able
[44:53] to do that
[44:54] amen if you really look at this he's
[44:56] wanting to give us peace he's wanting to
[44:58] give us joy I think what frustrates the
[45:00] devil the most is that he sends all of
[45:03] these trials and he sends all of these
[45:05] things in your life and you're still
[45:07] here
[45:12] he said I tried this and it didn't work
[45:15] come on I tried to get sister Sally I
[45:17] hope there's no Sally's in here tonight
[45:19] but I tried to get sister Sally against
[45:21] this one and I tried to get brother Joel
[45:23] against this one and I tried to get I'm
[45:25] just trying to help us understand what I
[45:27] was talking about we're trying to get
[45:28] this one against that one and that one
[45:30] and it's just not working
[45:32] they're still coming to church
[45:35] come on I've sold some Discord between
[45:37] this one and that one and still they're
[45:39] working it out and they're holding hands
[45:41] and they're still coming and worshiping
[45:43] in this place
[45:47] oh Hallelujah I like frustrating the
[45:50] devil don't you
[45:52] well that puts a smile on my face
[45:56] Hallelujah is it isn't life just amazed
[45:59] just think about just think about life
[46:01] for just a moment the power of life
[46:04] yeah we in construction you see a lot of
[46:07] things and and just thinking about this
[46:09] I've seen people run over these huge
[46:12] machines and trying to clear out areas
[46:14] and and then they'll put this dirt in
[46:16] and all these things but all it takes is
[46:17] one little seed
[46:20] to get mixed up in there somewhere
[46:22] and they'll put that oil on it they'll
[46:24] put the asphalt down
[46:27] and then all of a sudden guess what
[46:28] happens just give a little bit of time
[46:30] and the sun begins to shine down
[46:33] and it heats up that asphalt into warmth
[46:35] from the asphalt
[46:37] causes the reaction of that little seed
[46:40] down on underneath there
[46:42] that nobody can see at the moment you
[46:44] might be sitting in that service after
[46:45] service after service and it looks like
[46:48] sister Sally ain't getting it figured
[46:49] out
[46:50] come on chicks think about what I'm
[46:52] talking about and you'll see that but
[46:54] all of a sudden the sun begins to shine
[46:56] down and the devil loves to pave over
[46:59] you he loves to try to put this hard
[47:01] things on top of you but I'll tell you
[47:03] what it's amazing to me
[47:05] you'll just go out there one day and all
[47:08] of a sudden
[47:10] a little goody green thing
[47:12] huh because it's life
[47:15] it's life
[47:18] I've seen trees that grow up and as that
[47:21] tree gets out bigger and greater all of
[47:23] a sudden those roots spread out and it
[47:24] goes underneath sidewalks and it lifts
[47:26] up concrete
[47:28] what is that life
[47:30] the power of life
[47:32] I want to disturb the devil tonight I
[47:34] hope you do too that every battle that
[47:37] you put me through devil is just a scar
[47:42] hallelujah it's not even a wound anymore
[47:44] it's just a scar you know what that
[47:46] means brothers and sisters that I am
[47:48] proof that there's a living God you are
[47:51] proof that there's a living God tonight
[47:54] because if it was just not to me
[47:56] without him
[47:58] there would be no protruding through no
[48:00] asphalt

[48:12] great Warfare was coming on between
[48:14] right and wrong he knew what the enemy
[48:16] was going to do he know just exactly how
[48:19] to equip his people so if we notice the
[48:22] first the very first thing that God
[48:24] equips his children him being infinite
[48:27] he knowed what to what to what it took
[48:30] to defeat Satan any time any place and
[48:34] anywhere on any condition
[48:37] oh he knew aren't you glad he knew
[48:41] aren't you glad he knew oh my I've got
[48:43] to keep reading I gotta calm down
[48:45] Hallelujah he says I'll give them
[48:48] something here and in a few few years
[48:51] later he says I may study out something
[48:52] better and give them he says no that's
[48:54] not the way it works
[48:56] he says like we the military we have we
[48:59] used to have old bow and arrows and then
[49:01] a celebrity and all these things he
[49:02] begins to say and a musket and then
[49:04] after the musket the Springfield and he
[49:06] says now Atomic weapons and things he
[49:08] says we keep growing more and more he
[49:11] says but God at the beginning gave his
[49:14] children the atomic weapon
[49:16] because he's the infinite God
[49:20] now he's seeing there was going to be a
[49:23] conflict
[49:24] aren't you glad he knew there'd be a
[49:26] conflict he says and there was going to
[49:28] be a battle God equipped his children
[49:31] with the right kind of ammunition
[49:35] the right kind of an attack and the
[49:37] right kind of everything that they they
[49:38] had need of and would sweep them all the
[49:41] way from Eden to the rapture
[49:47] Hallelujah brothers and sisters he's
[49:49] giving you something that is proven
[49:52] he's given you something that will make
[49:54] it through
[49:55] he says what is it he says it's the word
[50:00] he says that's what defeats Satan is the
[50:03] word it'll defeat him he says it again
[50:05] anywhere any place
[50:08] he says now why do you want to
[50:11] substitute something else
[50:13] when you've already got the best thing
[50:16] that there is
[50:17] and it's the word
[50:21] take that
[50:23] take that
[50:25] brothers and sisters can you imagine
[50:26] he's giving I don't know about you
[50:30] but if that van out there was coming my
[50:32] direction
[50:34] I see a van straight ahead I don't know
[50:35] whose band that is but don't worry about
[50:37] it
[50:38] if I had an option here tonight of an
[50:40] arsenal
[50:41] and I had a 45 caliber pistol or I had a
[50:45] bazooka
[50:46] what do you think I want to use
[50:49] the biggest thing I've got
[50:52] the best thing I've got yeah God has
[50:55] given us the best thing
[50:57] he's given us his word it's been tried

[51:02] hurry praise God we're going to be here
[51:04] wow I can tell don't get nervous let's
[51:08] read on let's read let's turn with me if
[51:10] you will to the Book of Luke I love what
[51:11] Jesus says here this is Jesus as he's
[51:13] going back to his hometown in Nazareth I
[51:17] want to read this Luke chapter 4.
[51:19] verse 16.
[51:21] it says and he came to Nazareth where he
[51:24] had been brought up
[51:26] and as his custom was he went into the
[51:28] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[51:29] up for to read and there was delivered
[51:31] unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah
[51:34] it says and when he had opened the book
[51:36] he found the place where it was written
[51:38] Verse 18 the spirit of the Lord is upon
[51:41] me
[51:42] because he hath anointed me to preach
[51:44] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[51:49] heal the brokenhearted now notice I love
[51:51] how he puts these all together and to it
[51:54] says to preach Deliverance to the
[51:56] captives
[51:58] and recovering of the sight to the blind
[52:01] to set at Liberty them that are bruised
[52:04] to preach the acceptable year of the
[52:07] Lord
[52:08] he said right here as he stood up in the
[52:11] church and he began to read this the
[52:14] spirit of the Lord is upon me now
[52:16] they've looked at him as an illegitimate
[52:18] child
[52:20] is this not Joseph's son you can read on
[52:22] we don't get on all that but I want you
[52:24] to really now he's standing there and
[52:26] he's reading this he says I have been
[52:27] sent here hallelujah I've been anointed
[52:30] to preach that gospel
[52:32] I've been anointed if I can just help
[52:34] you help you understand to heal those
[52:36] that are brokenhearted I've been
[52:38] anointed to preach the Deliverance to
[52:40] the captives whole mind what is he and
[52:42] he closed the book and he gave it again
[52:44] to the minister and sat down in the eyes
[52:45] of them that were in the synagogue were
[52:48] fastened on him and he and he began to
[52:50] say unto them this day is this scripture
[52:53] fulfilled in your ears notice what he's
[52:55] saying here deliver I'm going to just
[52:57] pull out one of this portions right here
[52:59] Deliverance to the captives
[53:03] now if you've ever been in battle
[53:05] you maybe understand what I'm talking
[53:07] about
[53:09] sometimes in the battle people become
[53:11] captured
[53:15] not by Will
[53:18] Nobody by Will
[53:20] but it happens
[53:22] I'm going to say Amen to that
[53:24] y'all look this up and I'll just put in
[53:26] there just as a Naturals like how does
[53:28] this happen how do how do they become
[53:30] captives
[53:31] a captive is a prisoner of war
[53:34] that's what a captive is it's to capture
[53:37] to be taken taken for oneself
[53:40] and I looked it says the most common way
[53:42] to be captured is to get surrounded
[53:45] and then run out of ammunition
[53:50] think about that
[53:52] the most common way to be captured is to
[53:56] get surrounded
[53:58] and then run out of ammunition
[54:03] I'm beginning to think brothers and
[54:04] sisters
[54:06] what does the devil tried us to get us
[54:08] he begin to try to get us to separate he
[54:11] wants this church to separate we want
[54:14] this one to separate
[54:15] and he wants this one to separate in the
[54:17] church and that one to pull away
[54:20] because brothers and sisters there's a
[54:22] Unity
[54:23] when we come together as a body
[54:26] the devil begins to get nervous
[54:30] every time we come together with an
[54:33] intention to get closer to God the devil
[54:36] is on he's on the everybody be aware
[54:39] what's going on over here
[54:41] some go scope this out what is happening
[54:44] so what he tries to do is he tries to
[54:46] get people alienated or separated from
[54:49] one another
[54:50] if you get separated long enough most of
[54:54] the time that isolation causes you to
[54:56] run out of ammunition
[55:00] oh think about it so I begin to look
[55:02] this up how many years ever seen
[55:05] um the flag the POW flag it's actually a
[55:09] Black Flag if you remember what that
[55:10] looks like and it has a silhouette of a
[55:12] man and in the background it shows like
[55:15] a like a excuse me a guard Tower and
[55:19] then there's a little piece of barbed
[55:21] wire coming across as it were right down
[55:23] here
[55:24] I begin to look this up the POW flag
[55:26] which means a prisoner of war flag or
[55:29] M.I.A which means missing in action
[55:32] if you look at this it's also known that
[55:35] it consists of a silhouette which I just
[55:36] explained here but on the bottom it says
[55:39] you are not
[55:41] forgotten
[55:44] it appears in the very bottom of this
[55:47] flag
[55:48] now the U.S forces if you really think
[55:50] about this the U.S forces I'm trying to
[55:52] paint a picture here for just a moment
[55:54] the U.S forces in their dining Halls
[55:56] their mess halls and and in their with
[55:58] the places where they gather to eat
[56:01] it's they're on display in one part of
[56:06] this mess hall
[56:08] there's a table
[56:11] and a chair
[56:13] in a corner
[56:15] Drake with a p-o-w-m-i-a flag
[56:18] and there's a symbol for the missing
[56:21] thus reserving a chair in the hopes of
[56:23] their return
[56:25] it is flown by those that are home
[56:28] and are missing those soldiers
[56:30] I'm beginning to think about this as we
[56:32] come into the house of God
[56:34] I believe and I don't mean this in any
[56:36] disrespect we're in the dining hall
[56:37] tonight
[56:38] anybody here in the dining hall tonight
[56:40] now if I can paint you a picture here
[56:43] what they have in the corner is they
[56:45] have a let's think this is the flag they
[56:48] have that draped over that that table
[56:50] that chair and it represents that
[56:52] somebody
[56:53] is either missing an action
[56:55] or they've been a prisoner of war
[56:57] and they're waiting for their return
[56:59] yeah
[57:00] yeah and I begin to think about us
[57:02] sitting here tonight in the dining hall
[57:05] I believe we're sitting here tonight to
[57:07] dine
[57:09] but maybe there's somebody out there
[57:11] maybe you could raise your hand tonight
[57:13] and say I know that there's someone out
[57:15] there that I could raise and I could say
[57:17] I'm raising my flag
[57:19] for someone that's a pow or someone
[57:22] that's missing an action
[57:25] what does that mean brothers and sisters
[57:26] it's showing brothers and sisters that
[57:28] we believe that they'll return
[57:31] Hallelujah somewhere somehow
[57:34] amen only God can do this brothers and
[57:37] sisters but what does it do it's a
[57:39] reminder
[57:40] it is a reminder as we're sitting here
[57:43] tonight and we enjoy worshiping the Lord
[57:45] have we not enjoyed his presence already
[57:47] tonight
[57:48] on this Wednesday if we not enjoyed the
[57:50] worship we're enjoyed as we begin to
[57:52] enter into the word of God but some
[57:55] people don't in are not able to enjoy
[57:57] what we have enjoyed even at this
[57:59] evening
[58:02] and in my heart I said oh God
[58:05] give him a chance Lord
[58:08] there's got to be somebody that will
[58:10] remember these that may be may be
[58:13] missing in action
[58:14] I believe brother Brandon put it kind of
[58:16] like this when he talked about that
[58:17] eagle he says one time I was at that
[58:19] Cincinnati Zoo I was down there a little
[58:21] daughter and I were there
[58:23] he says I'm a great lover you probably
[58:24] know this story I just want to read it
[58:25] he says I'm a lover of the outdoors you
[58:28] know
[58:28] and I've seen they'd caught an eagle
[58:31] and they put him in a cage he said all
[58:33] that poor fella
[58:35] he said I heard a noise
[58:37] he said I was holding a little star by
[58:39] the hand we went down to the cage and
[58:41] there was this great big bird bloody all
[58:43] over his face feathers all beat off of
[58:46] him he's I thought oh what a pitiful
[58:47] sight
[58:50] he got down he walked back across the
[58:52] cage and he got a start and here he come
[58:54] flopping his wings again and burst his
[58:56] head up against the side of the cage
[58:58] flopping his wings up and down trying to
[59:01] get out of the cage
[59:02] and beating the feathers off
[59:05] but he was captured
[59:07] he fell back on the floor and laid there
[59:09] his eyes rolled around he looked up and
[59:11] seen the blue skies which he was born
[59:14] for
[59:14] I believe brothers and sisters and every
[59:17] True Believer there's a yearning
[59:20] for True freedom and you know what I
[59:22] mean by that I'm longing for those blue
[59:25] skies Hallelujah amen he says what he
[59:28] was born for he's a Heavenly bird you
[59:30] know he says but you see some wise
[59:33] achievement of man put him in a cage and
[59:35] I stood there looking at him I thought
[59:36] I'd give anything if I could buy him if
[59:39] I'd buy him I'd turn him loose
[59:41] I said go ahead go go ahead fella he
[59:44] says you'll like that he says I do too
[59:47] be free and go up there he says You
[59:49] Belong up there you're born for that I
[59:51] thought that was one of the most pitiful
[59:53] sights I've ever seen I picked up Sarah
[59:55] Helder in my arms and said honey there's
[59:57] one of the worst sights your eyes will
[59:58] ever look at and I stood there thinking
[1:00:00] I thought no
[1:00:02] I know a worse sight than that
[1:00:04] look up at the hill there
[1:00:06] the men with a can of beer in their hand
[1:00:09] women with the shorts and cigarettes he
[1:00:11] begin to tell them about this and he
[1:00:12] says that we're actually born to be Sons
[1:00:14] and Daughters of God
[1:00:18] he says in there in the cage of sin
[1:00:21] that Satan has put them in
[1:00:24] pitiful spiritually blind caged up he
[1:00:27] says maybe you belong to some church or
[1:00:29] maybe even sing in a choir yet caged in
[1:00:31] sin
[1:00:33] brothers and sisters I want to tell you
[1:00:34] tonight if you're in that cage there's
[1:00:37] the Liberator here tonight
[1:00:39] if you're in that place if the devil has
[1:00:42] pulled you down into just a deep pressed
[1:00:44] state in your mind brothers and sisters
[1:00:46] I believe there's a God here tonight
[1:00:48] that is able to set those captives free
[1:00:51] because he said he said listen he again
[1:00:54] said it the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:00:57] me
[1:00:58] Amen to what set these captives free
[1:01:01] oh Hallelujah I believe that with all my
[1:01:04] heart amen what is that Deliverance it's
[1:01:08] Freedom it's pardon it's forgiveness how
[1:01:11] many of you just come to church and just
[1:01:12] needed God's forgiveness
[1:01:14] Liberty how many just loves to have the
[1:01:16] liberty of God where the spirit of the
[1:01:18] Lord is there is Liberty
[1:01:21] oh brothers and sisters that's why I
[1:01:23] love coming to the house of God
[1:01:25] amen oh hallelujah what is it he wants
[1:01:29] he wants to give you
[1:01:31] he wants to give you
[1:01:32] such a peaceful moment in your life
[1:01:35] you remember that story brother Byron
[1:01:37] talks about
[1:01:38] I'll just paraphrase it
[1:01:40] he began to talk about that that captain
[1:01:43] of of Rome
[1:01:45] I believe it was Caesar
[1:01:48] and he's he said he said he wanted
[1:01:50] someone to sit by his side
[1:01:52] you remember the story probably
[1:01:55] and he said all these officers begin to
[1:01:57] shine up their armor and their plumes
[1:01:59] all these things trying to make ready
[1:02:00] because they wanted to be with Caesar
[1:02:05] and as he's going through the crowds and
[1:02:07] he sees all these that are dressed and
[1:02:09] they're shiny but he looks over and he
[1:02:10] sees one man
[1:02:13] it's all scarred up
[1:02:15] and he looks at him and says where'd you
[1:02:17] get those scars
[1:02:19] he said I got him on the battlefield
[1:02:22] for my Lord
[1:02:24] he said won't you come up here and ride
[1:02:25] with me
[1:02:27] brothers and sisters I believe he wants
[1:02:30] you to climb aboard
[1:02:32] and ride with him tonight
[1:02:34] how much ever just had the mercy of God
[1:02:36] just wrap his Mercy right around you as
[1:02:39] you just you felt his Mercy in his love
[1:02:42] brothers and sisters those are the those
[1:02:43] are the kind of things he's looking for
[1:02:46] true soldiers and I believe soldiers can
[1:02:48] be young people
[1:02:50] amen soldiers can be young men and young
[1:02:53] ladies
[1:02:54] amen what is that pressing the battle
[1:02:57] Hallelujah pushing forward brothers and
[1:03:00] sisters this is not an hour that we
[1:03:02] should be slacked this is the hour that
[1:03:04] we should be putting everything we have
[1:03:06] into serving the lord
[1:03:08] everything that's within US soldiers
[1:03:10] arise amen soldiers come to combat
[1:03:14] amen soldiers come on it's time that we
[1:03:17] press the battle
[1:03:18] I don't like going in Retreat brothers
[1:03:20] and sisters I like moving forward I like
[1:03:23] seeing the backside of the enemy
[1:03:26] amen what does that mean that they're on
[1:03:28] the Run
[1:03:29] oh Hallelujah you're a soldier ain't you
[1:03:32] you're a soldier ain't you
[1:03:35] oh my Hallelujah
[1:03:37] I believe we're soldiers
[1:03:39] I'm going to just read this right quick
[1:03:41] first John chapter 5 verse 4 and 5. I
[1:03:44] need to Define what time it is
[1:03:46] all right
[1:03:48] it says for whatsoever first John 5
[1:03:50] verses 4 4 whatsoever is born of God
[1:03:52] overcometh the world
[1:03:56] my I could just stop with that one
[1:04:00] I think that just seals the whole thing
[1:04:02] up right there
[1:04:04] for whatsoever is born of God if you
[1:04:06] know where you've been born Church it
[1:04:08] overcoming the world and this is the
[1:04:10] victory that overcometh the world even
[1:04:12] our faith who is he that overcometh the
[1:04:15] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[1:04:17] is the son of God
[1:04:19] do you believe brothers and sisters do
[1:04:21] you know where you've been born
[1:04:23] do you know that you're alive do you
[1:04:25] know that you're pressing the battle
[1:04:28] oh Hallelujah
[1:04:30] I'll quote this one you know what Isaiah
[1:04:32] 54 verse 17 no weapon that is formed
[1:04:34] against thee shall prosper
[1:04:36] and every tongue that rise against thee
[1:04:38] in judgment shall it says Thou shalt
[1:04:40] condemn
[1:04:42] if I could paint the picture tonight of
[1:04:43] and I just want to paint the picture of
[1:04:45] the old days when they would take and
[1:04:47] they would take steel and they would
[1:04:48] begin to go in the forgeries if you
[1:04:51] think in the Smith the smithies I
[1:04:53] believe and they would go in there and
[1:04:55] they begin to heat up this steel and
[1:04:56] they'd begin to pound on it and try to
[1:04:58] and get it uh red hot so that they could
[1:05:01] flatten it out so they could use these
[1:05:04] things for weapons and they would begin
[1:05:05] to form out Spears and and they would
[1:05:07] begin to form out swords and and shield
[1:05:10] all these things that begin to make all
[1:05:12] these weapons and if I could just paint
[1:05:14] the picture tonight as we would walk
[1:05:16] through uh if I could put it this way
[1:05:18] the Gates of Hell tonight and we could
[1:05:20] see the smithies and we could see the
[1:05:22] forgeries and we could see all these
[1:05:24] things and there's people beating them
[1:05:25] and they're they're forming an all this
[1:05:27] lined up as soon as this one gets done
[1:05:29] with this one they stack them up and
[1:05:30] here they are lined up
[1:05:34] weapons
[1:05:36] weapons
[1:05:38] that the devil
[1:05:40] wants to try to use against the bride of
[1:05:42] Christ
[1:05:44] if you really think about this even the
[1:05:46] Bible says that he which is gone created
[1:05:49] the Smith and bloweth the coals of in
[1:05:51] the fire but listen I want you to
[1:05:53] understand no matter how many spheres
[1:05:55] are made
[1:05:57] no matter how many swords have been made
[1:06:01] I begin to look at just you really look
[1:06:03] at things and most most things you'll
[1:06:06] look in the fine print you'll find
[1:06:08] something on there
[1:06:11] it says made in China
[1:06:15] most a lot of things right a lot of
[1:06:17] things it's made here maybe maybe it
[1:06:19] said maybe made in the U.S but there's
[1:06:22] little inscriptions right that's
[1:06:23] something on the bottom I believe that
[1:06:25] every sword
[1:06:27] that is made
[1:06:30] every spear that is made
[1:06:33] everything that the devil tries and he
[1:06:36] begins I'll just put this he he creates
[1:06:38] this great thing of sin he creates this
[1:06:40] sword of guilt and he he creates these
[1:06:43] things of depression and falsehood
[1:06:46] but at the little description before it
[1:06:48] can be even sent out and given to these
[1:06:51] demons there's an inscription on the
[1:06:53] bottom of it
[1:06:55] says it shall not
[1:06:58] prosper
[1:07:02] if you look at the very thing the devil
[1:07:05] has tried to use against you
[1:07:07] and you turn around say hey Neville
[1:07:10] read the fine print
[1:07:13] what does it say
[1:07:16] it says it shall not prosper
[1:07:21] every depression spirit that comes my
[1:07:24] direction every air that comes my way
[1:07:27] brothers and sisters I can tell the
[1:07:29] devil that it shall not prosper not
[1:07:34] because of what I've said or what I've
[1:07:36] done but God said it
[1:07:39] God said before it leaves the Gates of
[1:07:41] Hell
[1:07:42] before it leaves the forgeries and the
[1:07:45] smithies brothers and sisters there
[1:07:47] shall be an inscription on it
[1:07:49] and that inscription is going to say it
[1:07:52] shall not
[1:07:55] the next time brothers and sisters
[1:07:57] something comes your direction
[1:07:58] you turn it around when doubt comes to
[1:08:01] you comes your way look at him right in
[1:08:03] the face and say it shall not press
[1:08:06] fear will come and try to grab a halt of
[1:08:08] you brothers and sisters but you look
[1:08:10] him right back in the face and say it
[1:08:12] shall not prosper
[1:08:15] amen
[1:08:17] whatever it is you put that name
[1:08:19] whatever it is that the Devils try to
[1:08:21] send your direction
[1:08:23] you put that name right there
[1:08:25] and you tell them to look at the bottom
[1:08:27] look at the inscription
[1:08:30] Hallelujah
[1:08:32] I hope you never read that scripture the
[1:08:34] same way
[1:08:35] it shall not prosper
[1:08:37] it will not Prosper no matter what it is
[1:08:40] Satan you're defeated
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:44] oh he may try to get as big and ugly as
[1:08:46] he possibly can but it shall not oppress
[1:08:51] oh my how many times has he come in
[1:08:53] listen like a roaring lion
[1:08:56] how many times does he try to get you
[1:08:58] deceive you pull you down speak some
[1:09:00] ugly word in your ear that nobody even
[1:09:02] spoke but he told you somebody did look
[1:09:06] back at that devil say it shall not
[1:09:09] Prosper it ain't gonna work
[1:09:13] oh my because my God said
[1:09:16] write it down
[1:09:19] and he's got all power
[1:09:20] write it down
[1:09:22] like I said it can't leave till it has
[1:09:24] that inscription on there
[1:09:26] amen
[1:09:27] oh brother and sisters but but see I
[1:09:30] like the church it has to pass through
[1:09:32] that Hall of critics we've had to go
[1:09:34] through it
[1:09:35] come on
[1:09:37] he says you're going to be called a Holy
[1:09:38] Roller you're going to be called
[1:09:39] everything he says but if you could only
[1:09:42] hold your position in Christ
[1:09:44] oh brother and sister we just preached
[1:09:46] at home and talking about your position
[1:09:48] oh my let's let's find our position
[1:09:50] tonight oh brothers and sisters when
[1:09:52] people get in their position I'm trying
[1:09:54] not to preach on that but it sure
[1:09:55] burning when we get in position
[1:09:58] brothers and sisters you'll be amazed
[1:10:01] I'll how smoothly things will go and
[1:10:03] what I mean by that is how things will
[1:10:05] work together I didn't say that the
[1:10:08] battles wouldn't be there yeah but what
[1:10:10] happens is when this begins to happen
[1:10:12] all of a sudden Things fall into place
[1:10:13] why because this one's in their position
[1:10:15] and this one's holding the line there
[1:10:17] you go
[1:10:19] why do you think it's so important that
[1:10:20] each and every well you may say well I
[1:10:22] don't really do much
[1:10:24] all right don't let the devil tell you
[1:10:26] that yeah
[1:10:28] Oh my he says get in your positions hold
[1:10:30] your positions he says someday he'll
[1:10:32] take us take us to the Hall of Fame but
[1:10:36] first we've got to stand the criticism
[1:10:38] there's where the littleness of us stand
[1:10:40] it says there's where it shows it says
[1:10:42] that he cannot stand he that cannot
[1:10:45] stand chastisement is an illegitimate
[1:10:46] child and not a child of God no matter
[1:10:49] how much he's joined the church or
[1:10:50] whatever he's done if he cannot stand
[1:10:52] chastisement he's an illegitimate and
[1:10:54] he's not a real child of God but a real
[1:10:56] genuine child of God don't care what the
[1:10:59] world says everything else is secondary
[1:11:02] he's got his mind on Christ and that
[1:11:05] settles it
[1:11:07] whatever Christ says
[1:11:09] whatever he says
[1:11:11] oh brothers and sisters do you know what
[1:11:14] he says tonight
[1:11:16] do you do you recognize his voice I
[1:11:18] believe the Bible says that my sheep
[1:11:21] know my voice
[1:11:23] amen they know my voice
[1:11:25] amen
[1:11:31] I'm going to close with this
[1:11:35] how many here's ever seen a golf ball
[1:11:39] I know brother Merle has
[1:11:43] anybody else seen a golf ball you know
[1:11:46] okay that could be in different colors
[1:11:48] or whatever but yeah
[1:11:50] yeah just I thought this was very
[1:11:52] interesting
[1:11:53] originally he said what does this have
[1:11:55] to do with Battle Scars you'll get it
[1:11:56] here in just a minute
[1:11:58] originally golf balls were smooth
[1:12:02] as golfers use the same ball over and
[1:12:05] over
[1:12:06] they started to notice
[1:12:08] I love this
[1:12:10] that the more beat up golf balls were
[1:12:13] traveling farther
[1:12:16] the Knicks
[1:12:18] the bumps
[1:12:21] the slices
[1:12:23] were actually helping them win
[1:12:27] in other words when they first began to
[1:12:28] hit these balls they were smooth and as
[1:12:30] they hit them and they hit them and they
[1:12:32] reused they begin to put little dents in
[1:12:34] the little Parts into this into this
[1:12:37] ball and they they recognize that these
[1:12:39] bumps and these Nicks and all these
[1:12:41] things were actually now the ball was
[1:12:43] starting to go further than it had been
[1:12:45] going before eventually putting
[1:12:47] Impressions on the golf balls became a
[1:12:50] standard
[1:12:52] after being proved
[1:12:54] aerodynamically accurate by a physicist
[1:12:58] that says of course it says here's the
[1:13:01] deal I just thought this was good the
[1:13:03] dimples in the golf balls create
[1:13:05] turbulence
[1:13:08] anybody
[1:13:10] oh but yeah I didn't want to hear that
[1:13:12] tonight yeah I didn't drive all the way
[1:13:15] here
[1:13:16] all day to to hear tonight that
[1:13:19] turbulence is a great thing
[1:13:23] that's what you got
[1:13:26] what does he say here that this
[1:13:28] turbulence which means a turbulence is
[1:13:30] that means mixed airflow that means
[1:13:32] things are going this way and that way
[1:13:35] and this way and that way
[1:13:38] how many has ever been there
[1:13:40] how many has ever woke up in turbulence
[1:13:44] how many amen you woke up on a Monday
[1:13:46] morning in turbulence you woke up on a
[1:13:48] Saturday morning in turbulence you've
[1:13:51] had those moments what it happens
[1:13:52] brothers and sisters if you recognize it
[1:13:56] reduces drag when this is done right
[1:13:58] these little Impressions that are put
[1:14:00] into this ball it reduces the drag
[1:14:03] making it go farther
[1:14:07] not only that oh I love this one
[1:14:10] it creates lift
[1:14:18] I'm just giving you a second
[1:14:20] it creates lift
[1:14:23] without that you couldn't have lift or
[1:14:25] flight it says a golf ball without
[1:14:27] dimples it says that cannot have fly
[1:14:30] that way it'll he'll hit it and you'll
[1:14:31] get it to certain far but it's not going
[1:14:33] to go as far as they have designed
[1:14:36] so a ball without dimples won't fly half
[1:14:38] as far as a ball with dimples according
[1:14:41] to the USGA
[1:14:43] researchers today I begin to look at
[1:14:45] this up because I was interested and it
[1:14:47] says that most golf balls have anywhere
[1:14:49] from
[1:14:50] 336 to 500 dimples
[1:14:54] with an ideal range between 380 to 432
[1:14:57] dimples per golf ball
[1:15:02] how does that have anything to do with
[1:15:04] me
[1:15:06] so I said this
[1:15:08] if our
[1:15:10] if an average body
[1:15:12] was covered
[1:15:13] with these dimples
[1:15:18] using the number 400
[1:15:20] on a golf ball
[1:15:23] it would have an approximately 572
[1:15:27] 000 dimples
[1:15:30] on your body
[1:15:32] so I kind of broke this down
[1:15:34] if you had 16 trials every day
[1:15:41] nobody's asking nobody's hands are
[1:15:43] raised Lord pick me no no
[1:15:46] if you had 16 trials every day
[1:15:49] and I put this I just put this for 16 I
[1:15:53] just put this like every every hour that
[1:15:56] you're awake you would have to live
[1:15:57] approximately
[1:15:59] 198 or excuse me you'd have to live
[1:16:02] almost 98 years old to accumulate 572
[1:16:07] 000 trials
[1:16:11] so my question is
[1:16:13] if a ball
[1:16:16] can go further
[1:16:18] because of its design
[1:16:22] and they just figured this out however I
[1:16:25] mean ghosts oh but it ain't that old
[1:16:27] if they could design it to where now it
[1:16:30] can travel farther
[1:16:32] What About Us
[1:16:34] think about this every time that next
[1:16:37] trial comes your way
[1:16:38] that next battle comes your direction
[1:16:41] it's a scar
[1:16:44] but what is it doing it's making you get
[1:16:46] a little higher
[1:16:48] and go a little bit further
[1:16:51] every trial every battle when you get if
[1:16:54] you go into battle Tomorrow there's
[1:16:56] something that comes your direction you
[1:16:57] say there's another one I'm just getting
[1:16:58] a little higher brother window and I'm
[1:17:00] going a little bit further
[1:17:02] because I'll tell you this our lord
[1:17:05] Jesus knows just how to get that ball
[1:17:07] where it needs to go
[1:17:10] Hallelujah amen I don't tell you what I
[1:17:13] don't know how I'm a terrible golfer
[1:17:16] I'll just tell you that I hit the ball
[1:17:18] like this and it goes like that and I
[1:17:21] don't don't understand it one bit
[1:17:24] and I've practiced and practiced and I
[1:17:26] still ain't no good
[1:17:28] well I'll tell you what when someone's
[1:17:30] done it over and over and over
[1:17:33] they know exactly what to do
[1:17:35] oh my brothers and sisters I believe
[1:17:37] he's got some battle scarred Saints here
[1:17:39] tonight
[1:17:42] we'll close with this but the RAM says
[1:17:44] now we're expected to be tested
[1:17:47] hahaha
[1:17:48] how many of us have walked there said
[1:17:50] why Lord I got another test
[1:17:54] he says we're expected to be tested yeah
[1:17:57] he says that's a good lesson from my
[1:17:59] brother back there he says oh he says
[1:18:01] there were in the time of Daniel's time
[1:18:03] there were four Overcomers that could
[1:18:05] stand the test of the fire and the lion
[1:18:09] see now God has called you
[1:18:13] to be tested
[1:18:14] tested what with the word it says that's
[1:18:17] God's test do you believe it
[1:18:20] do you believe it so you tested right
[1:18:23] here do you believe it he said that only
[1:18:25] shows a true child then see to be tested
[1:18:28] and when the test comes on
[1:18:31] he says you can't you can't overcome
[1:18:33] lest there's a test to get that that's
[1:18:36] given to you and when the test is given
[1:18:38] it's to see whether you can overcome or
[1:18:41] not
[1:18:41] Jesus said to him that overcometh the
[1:18:44] test he says the test is the greatest
[1:18:46] thing that ever happened to you
[1:18:51] boy that that's something I think
[1:18:53] sometimes we need to remind ourselves
[1:18:55] that he says I believe it's written in
[1:18:57] the scripture Peter said that our trials
[1:18:59] are worth more to us than precious gold
[1:19:03] it's testing time
[1:19:05] it's one good evidence to us that God is
[1:19:08] with us when we're tested
[1:19:11] see we're for all children of God are
[1:19:14] tested and tried
[1:19:17] so the next time you face a trial
[1:19:19] and next time you face a battle
[1:19:22] brothers and sisters I want you to think
[1:19:24] of it differently
[1:19:26] because we all face trials
[1:19:29] young people face trials
[1:19:31] come on they're going through hard
[1:19:32] transitions in their life trying to
[1:19:35] figure things out it's hard for them
[1:19:38] but I'll tell you what God wouldn't put
[1:19:40] more on them than they could bear
[1:19:42] he said I will be your help and I will
[1:19:44] be your strength
[1:19:45] you want some you want someone that's
[1:19:47] even listen that's greater than the one
[1:19:49] sitting next to you I'll tell you what
[1:19:51] rely on him
[1:19:53] because when all men fail God will not
[1:19:55] fail
[1:19:57] amen hold to him
[1:20:00] that next trial that you got to go
[1:20:02] through you I'm telling you tonight I
[1:20:03] believe the Lord just laid this on my
[1:20:05] heart just for just for here just saying
[1:20:07] there's some battle scarred Saints here
[1:20:10] but I'll tell you this brother Wendell
[1:20:12] when I get to the other side and we're
[1:20:14] sitting at that table that's thousands
[1:20:16] of miles long
[1:20:18] I'm going to see some of you
[1:20:21] across the table
[1:20:24] scarred veterans
[1:20:27] you may have been in it for a day
[1:20:30] you may have been in it for a week you
[1:20:31] may have been in it for 20 years
[1:20:34] but brothers and sisters press the
[1:20:35] battle
[1:20:37] move forward
[1:20:39] don't don't turn around and run
[1:20:42] run towards the end I love the example
[1:20:45] and I'm done none of this is on here I
[1:20:48] just so musicians can come on up here as
[1:20:50] I'm testifying now Hallelujah I love the
[1:20:53] story that as as it's wrote in Samuel
[1:20:56] about David
[1:20:58] how did he recognizes he has this
[1:21:01] conversation with Goliath
[1:21:04] and then after this conversation and he
[1:21:06] has those five Stones it says that he
[1:21:08] runs towards him
[1:21:11] can you imagine what's going through the
[1:21:13] the Giant's mind
[1:21:15] Goliath's mind is he's looking at this
[1:21:18] little little Ruddy boy
[1:21:21] with a fire in his eyes
[1:21:24] oh brother sister think about this
[1:21:27] and he's running straight at you
[1:21:30] and he's reaching in his pocket he pulls
[1:21:32] out this Stone and he grabs this thing I
[1:21:35] don't know about you but who takes a
[1:21:36] rock to a sword fight
[1:21:40] God's people
[1:21:44] amen God's people
[1:21:46] the devil looks at you and says listen
[1:21:48] what do you think I am you come to me
[1:21:50] with staves and listen sticks I'm not
[1:21:52] out here
[1:21:53] I'm not out here to play games
[1:21:56] that's what goliath was telling him but
[1:21:58] what did he do he ran straight at him
[1:22:02] I love it how he takes that and he
[1:22:04] throws that
[1:22:05] he did his part
[1:22:10] now it's in the hands of God to do the
[1:22:11] rest
[1:22:13] can I ask you this tonight
[1:22:15] will you do your part
[1:22:18] will you do your part tonight
[1:22:21] Inspire hits for just a moment
[1:22:23] [Music]
[1:22:26] is there something you have need of
[1:22:27] tonight maybe you've been fighting some
[1:22:29] battles
[1:22:31] maybe you've been struggling maybe you
[1:22:33] have been in that mode of saying Lord I
[1:22:35] don't understand
[1:22:39] I have to face this
[1:22:41] is why the struggle seems to get harder
[1:22:47] I pray tonight that you will recognize
[1:22:51] he is with you
[1:22:53] with you in all of these things
[1:22:56] there's not one battle
[1:22:58] listen he will not
[1:23:00] he will not let a battle come your way
[1:23:04] unless he already knows that you are
[1:23:06] able to overcome it if you will just
[1:23:10] rely on him
[1:23:12] will you give him that tonight
[1:23:14] say Lord I'm putting my trust in you
[1:23:16] through I've tried to trust this thing
[1:23:18] and that thing I've tried to trust
[1:23:19] things in my life but tonight Lord I'm
[1:23:21] trusting you I'm going to put my full
[1:23:24] confidence in you just
[1:23:26] [Music]
[1:23:28] maybe you have a wound tonight maybe
[1:23:30] there's something that's still hurting
[1:23:32] maybe there's a something that's still
[1:23:34] through as it were it's still open
[1:23:36] tonight
[1:23:38] the great position to come by and you
[1:23:41] need him to heal that wound
[1:23:43] the trust in God that you can move
[1:23:46] forward
[1:23:47] that you can have that testimony that
[1:23:49] he's calling you to have each and every
[1:23:52] one of us are facing things brothers and
[1:23:54] sisters that maybe we thought we would
[1:23:55] never have to face
[1:23:57] but God will use those things he will
[1:24:00] use them he will bless you he's wanting
[1:24:04] to show you like he's we just read he
[1:24:07] wants to put you in that Hall of Fame
[1:24:10] he wants you tonight to recognize you're
[1:24:13] going through that Hall of critics
[1:24:14] because
[1:24:16] you fix it to be moved to that Hall of
