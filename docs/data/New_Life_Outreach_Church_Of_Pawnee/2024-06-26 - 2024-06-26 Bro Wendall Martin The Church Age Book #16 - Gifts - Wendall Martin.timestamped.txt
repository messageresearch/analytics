[26:13] brother Jonas and and brother Kelly um
[26:17] wanted us to send our greetings to
[26:19] everyone here at the church and and um
[26:23] uh they they uh I mean they ask by name
[26:27] however want is doing I mean those guys
[26:29] have got memories and uh then brother
[26:33] Merl they they asked how you were doing
[26:35] and
[26:36] so and uh so um but we had wonderful
[26:41] wonderful Services there and we're so
[26:43] thankful to see the Saints um uplifted
[26:46] in their
[26:48] Spirits so tonight we want to read in on
[26:52] um we're going to read here in book or
[26:54] in on page
[26:56] 166 and we're we're going to start here
[26:59] at the second
[27:01] paragraph and
[27:04] um uh some of you might have noticed
[27:06] that last time we had skipped a couple
[27:09] of pages um those of you that are that
[27:13] that are uh following closely and um uh
[27:17] so we we read from 171 the other night
[27:21] and read a couple of pages there and I
[27:23] skipped it because I I wanted to um I I
[27:27] I well that night I I wanted to deal
[27:29] with thoughts and and um uh how that if
[27:33] this word is going to be anything or if
[27:35] this message is going to be anything
[27:37] amen sometimes we we think that it's um
[27:41] it's all a supernatural act of God the
[27:43] supernatural act of God is what he done
[27:45] in your soul amen that's the new birth
[27:49] but you have to choose to think the
[27:51] right thoughts because it's got to come
[27:52] through this right here and this right
[27:55] here to get down into here can you say
[27:57] Amen so what you read and what you
[28:00] choose to listen to this Soul either
[28:02] agrees or doesn't agree amen and when
[28:05] our soul gets real swampy it starts
[28:07] letting anything inside there and and
[28:09] you don't want that you want your soul
[28:12] Amen to filter those things in our lives
[28:15] but tonight and maybe the next couple of
[28:18] us Wednesday nights we're going to deal
[28:20] with gifts gifts of the Spirit and um um
[28:24] because brother brandham talks a lot
[28:26] about the gifts in the Church age and in
[28:29] his ministry and and we understand that
[28:32] that brother brandham was not against
[28:34] the gifts but he was for sure um uh
[28:39] telling us that they need to be operated
[28:41] right and that they that that you cannot
[28:46] you you can speak in tongues all over
[28:48] the and and and and U and prophesy all
[28:52] you want and still go to hell amen now
[28:56] and that that's just that's just a fact
[28:58] and so we do not we do not base our
[29:02] Salvation Amen on gifts but to say gifts
[29:06] are not a part of the church then then I
[29:09] would have to say Amen uh because
[29:11] there's a lot of it wrong then I would
[29:13] have to say that I can't preach anymore
[29:15] and oops by the way that's the what what
[29:18] is being taught in in our message
[29:21] circles amen the gifts have have
[29:23] elements of of uh of of of of you know
[29:27] uh wrong and and they're Incorrect and
[29:30] preachers are wrong and they mess up and
[29:32] they do these kinds of things and so uh
[29:35] so you know you know we don't believe in
[29:37] speaking in tongues we don't believe in
[29:39] Prophecy we don't believe in Visions we
[29:40] don't believe in dreams we don't believe
[29:41] in Preachers we just don't believe in
[29:43] anything anymore if you're not careful
[29:45] that's not what brother brandham taught
[29:47] us Amen brother brandham taught us that
[29:49] we are that there will be a church there
[29:53] will be a five-fold Ministry and there
[29:55] will be the nine spiritual gift GI in
[29:59] operation and so but they've got but he
[30:03] also says go back to the scripture and
[30:06] how the Apostle Paul set it in order
[30:09] because Le oosa does not do it the way
[30:12] the Apostle Paul had it set in
[30:14] order can you say amen and so uh so
[30:19] we're going to read here and um amen and
[30:22] and we're going to um we're we're going
[30:26] to read um uh about three uh see one 2 3
[30:30] four pages and then we'll uh do some
[30:33] commenting and reading some scriptures
[30:35] but it says here in in 166 and we're
[30:38] going to start at the second paragraph
[30:40] but what are tongues and interpretation
[30:43] and the other gifts they are
[30:46] manifestations that is what the word
[30:48] teaches read it in 1 Corinthians 12: 7
[30:52] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[30:54] given to every man to profit withle then
[30:57] Paul names those
[30:59] manifestations now comes this very good
[31:01] question and I know you are all anxious
[31:04] to ask why isn't the manifestation an
[31:08] Evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[31:11] Ghost because surely you could not
[31:14] manifest the Holy Ghost unless you were
[31:16] truly Spirit-filled now I wish I could
[31:19] say that is right but I don't like to
[31:22] hurt people's feelings or because I
[31:23] don't like to hurt people's feelings or
[31:25] walk on their Doctrine but I wouldn't be
[31:28] a true servant of God if I didn't tell
[31:31] you the whole counsel of God this is
[31:34] that is right is it not just let us take
[31:37] a little look at balum he was religious
[31:40] he worshiped God he understood the
[31:42] prophet the proper method of sacrificing
[31:45] and worship and approaching unto God but
[31:48] he was not a true seed Prophet for he
[31:51] took the wages of unrighteousness and
[31:53] worst of all he led the people of God
[31:55] into sin and fornication of fornication
[31:58] and
[32:00] idolatry yet who would dare to deny that
[32:03] the spirit of God manifested through him
[32:07] in in one of the most beautiful portions
[32:09] of absolutely accurate prophecy the
[32:11] world has ever seen but he never had the
[32:14] Holy Ghost now then what do you think
[32:16] about Caiaphas the high priest the Bible
[32:20] says he prophesied the kind of death the
[32:22] Lord should die we all know there is no
[32:26] record of him being a spirit spirit
[32:28] filled spirit-led man like dear o Simeon
[32:32] or that sweet an uh uh the sweet Saint
[32:34] the an
[32:36] Anna yet he had a genuine manifestation
[32:40] of the Holy Ghost we can we we cannot
[32:43] deny that so where is the manifestation
[32:47] as an Evidence it isn't there if you are
[32:51] truly filled with the spirit of God you
[32:53] will have the evidence of the word in
[32:56] your life can I hear an amen so if
[33:00] you're spirit filled what we're looking
[33:02] for is the evidence of the word in our
[33:06] lives now let's show you uh let's show
[33:09] you how deeply I feel and understand
[33:11] this Truth by a revelation God gave to
[33:14] me gave me now before I tell it I want
[33:17] to say this many of you people believe
[33:20] me to be a prophet I don't say that I am
[33:23] you have said it but you but we both
[33:26] know that the visions God gives me never
[33:28] fail not once if anyone can prove a
[33:32] vision ever failed I want to know about
[33:34] it now that you follow me this far here
[33:38] is my story many years ago I came across
[33:41] the Pentecostal people I was in one of
[33:44] their camp meetings where there was much
[33:46] manifestation of tongues interpretation
[33:49] of tongues and prophecy two preachers in
[33:52] particular were engaged in this kind of
[33:53] speaking more than any of the other
[33:56] brethren I thoroughly enjoyed the
[33:58] services and was truly interested in the
[34:01] various
[34:02] manifestations they had a ring of
[34:04] reality to them it was my Earnest desire
[34:08] to learn all that I could about these
[34:10] gifts so I decided to talk to the two
[34:13] men about them through the gift of God
[34:16] resident in me I sought to know the
[34:18] spirit in the first man whether he was
[34:21] truly of God or not after their brief
[34:24] conversation uh after a brief
[34:26] conversation with that sweet humble
[34:28] brother I knew he was a genuine solid
[34:31] Christian he was real the next young man
[34:34] was not at all like the first one he was
[34:36] boastful and proud and as I spoke to him
[34:40] a vision moved across my eyes and I saw
[34:43] that he was married to a PL blonde lady
[34:46] lady but living with a brunette who had
[34:48] two children by
[34:50] her if I have if there were ever a
[34:52] hypocrite he was one let me tell you I
[34:56] was shocked how could I how could uh how
[35:00] could I not be here were two men one of
[35:04] them was a real believer and the other
[35:06] was a sinful impersonator yet both were
[35:10] manifesting gifts of the Spirit I was
[35:13] troubled by this confusion I left the
[35:16] meetings to seek God for the answer I
[35:19] went alone to a secret place and there
[35:21] with my Bible I prayed and waited on the
[35:23] Lord for the answer not knowing just
[35:26] what portion of scripture to read I
[35:28] casually open this the Bible to some
[35:31] place in Matthew I read for a while and
[35:34] then laid the Bible down in a moment a
[35:38] wind blew into the room and turned the
[35:40] pages of the Bible to Hebrews the 6th
[35:43] chapter I read it through and was
[35:46] particularly impressed by those strange
[35:48] verses in Hebrews 6:4 to9 for it is
[35:53] impossible for those who were once
[35:55] enlightened and have tasted of of the
[35:57] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[36:00] the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good
[36:04] word of God and the powers of the world
[36:06] to come if they should fall
[36:09] away to renew them again unto repentance
[36:13] seeing They Crucified to themselves the
[36:15] Son of God aresh and put him to an open
[36:18] shame for the Earth which drinketh in
[36:21] the rain that cometh of upon it and
[36:24] bringeth forth herbs for them by uh whom
[36:28] it is dressed receiveth blessing from
[36:30] the from God and that which beareth
[36:32] thorns and briers is rejected and is
[36:35] nigh un cursing whose end is to be
[36:38] burned but beloved we are persuaded
[36:41] better things of you and things that
[36:43] accompany salvation though we thus speak
[36:47] amen so how many understands what he is
[36:49] saying there now he was he's talking
[36:52] about the thorns and he's talking about
[36:54] the real and and and he says the thorns
[36:57] and the real all GA the same thing he he
[37:02] he you you he says that you he says they
[37:04] were made partakers of the Holy Ghost
[37:07] they've tasted of the word of God and
[37:09] the powers of the world to come they
[37:13] have tasted these things and it's
[37:16] brought them forth and they've grown but
[37:19] it's not produced Christ
[37:21] whatsoever God's Reign has come upon it
[37:24] God's word has been has fallen upon it
[37:27] amen they have tasted of that good life
[37:31] that good power of that world to
[37:34] come and yet amen they are bearing
[37:37] thorns and thistles they they they will
[37:40] be rejected so so you can have the Holy
[37:44] Spirit to to come upon you amen and and
[37:49] and um amen you you you the reason why
[37:52] we don't put emphasis on the
[37:55] gifts and and it in in and and to be
[37:58] honest with you amen it it's because of
[38:01] this and me coming from a Pentecostal
[38:04] background that that maybe I have done
[38:07] the church an injustice by by not uh uh
[38:12] really uh bringing out the gifts a
[38:14] little bit more and and teaching on them
[38:17] and showing you in the scripture that
[38:19] that the gifts are all right they're not
[38:22] wrong they are God's Heavenly
[38:25] gifts but devil are coming in in this
[38:28] last day and they're imitating those
[38:31] gifts and when they imitate the gifts
[38:34] amen they look spiritual they cry they
[38:39] they they dance they they they have
[38:41] visions dreams gifts prophecies and a
[38:45] lot of them do come true but they're
[38:47] evil they're devils and so we don't want
[38:52] we don't want the church amen uh uh you
[38:55] know
[38:57] uh um leaning on on gifts as if it's
[39:02] your spirituality because it does not
[39:05] make you amen a Son of God it does not
[39:08] mean you have the the Holy Ghost can you
[39:11] say Amen now I'll share a little bit
[39:14] more as we go but he says I closed the
[39:17] Bible laid it down and
[39:20] meditated a while and prayed some more I
[39:24] still had no answer I again to open the
[39:26] Bible aimlessly
[39:28] but did not uh but did not read suddenly
[39:30] the wind blew into the room again and
[39:33] once more the pages turned to Hebrews
[39:35] six and remain there as the wind
[39:38] ceased I read those words over
[39:41] again and when I did then the spirit of
[39:45] God came into the room and I beheld a
[39:47] vision I saw in the vision a man dressed
[39:49] in the purest white who went forth with
[39:52] a freshly plowed field and sold grain it
[39:56] was a bright day the sewing was done in
[39:58] the
[39:59] morning but late in at night after the
[40:02] sewer in White had gone a man in Black
[40:06] came and steeply solded some more seed
[40:09] amongst that which the man in White had
[40:11] sold the days went by the Sun and Rain
[40:15] blessed the ground and one day there
[40:17] appeared grain how fine it was but a day
[40:20] later appeared the tears and the wheat
[40:23] and tears grew together they partook of
[40:25] the same nourishment of the same soil
[40:28] they drank in the same sun and Rain one
[40:31] day then one day the skies turned brass
[40:34] and the plants all begin to droop and to
[40:36] die I heard the wheat lift their heads
[40:39] and cry to God for rain the tears also
[40:42] lifted up their voices and pleaded for
[40:44] rain then the skies darkened and the
[40:47] rain came and again the wheat now full
[40:50] of strength lifted up their voices and
[40:52] cried in adoration praise the Lord and
[40:56] to my wonderment
[40:57] I heard the revived tears also look up
[41:01] and say
[41:02] hallelujah then I knew the truth of the
[41:04] camp meeting and the vision the parable
[41:07] of the swer and the seed the sixth
[41:09] chapter of Hebrews and the
[41:12] evident manifestation of spiritual gifts
[41:16] in a mixed audience all became
[41:18] wonderfully clear the s in white was the
[41:21] Lord the s in Black was the devil the
[41:24] world was the field the seeds were
[41:26] people elect and
[41:28] repeate both partook of the same
[41:30] nourishment water and Sun both prayed
[41:33] both received help from God he maketh
[41:36] his Reign and son to fall on both good
[41:39] and evil and although they both had the
[41:42] same wonderful blessings and both had
[41:45] the same wonderful
[41:46] manifestations there was still that one
[41:49] great difference they were of different
[41:53] seed here also was the answer to to
[41:57] Matthew 7:21-23
[41:59] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[42:02] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[42:05] heaven but he that doeth the will of My
[42:08] Father which is in heaven many will say
[42:10] to me in that day Lord Lord have we not
[42:14] prophesied in thy name in thy name have
[42:16] cast out devils and in thy name done
[42:19] many wonderful works then will I profess
[42:22] unto them I never knew you depart from
[42:26] me you that work iniquity Jesus does not
[42:30] deny that they did Mighty works that
[42:34] only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by
[42:38] the way of men but he did deny ever
[42:42] knowing them they weren't backslide
[42:45] these weren't backsliders they were
[42:46] Wicked unregenerate
[42:49] rebates they were the seed of Satan
[42:52] there it is you can't claim the
[42:55] manifestation
[42:57] is the evidence of being Spirit born
[43:00] spirit filled no sir I will admit that
[43:04] true manifestation is the evidence of
[43:07] the Holy Ghost doing Mighty acts but it
[43:10] is not the evidence of the individual
[43:13] being Spirit-filled even though that
[43:16] individual has an abundance of those
[43:19] manifestations W now this is this is
[43:23] pretty incredible amen because and and
[43:26] again again uh uh we will we will uh uh
[43:31] do the three circles
[43:34] here praise the Lord so so you have got
[43:38] the um let's see this this here I didn't
[43:42] put that big enough that's
[43:43] soul
[43:45] spirit and here's
[43:48] body so here's here's the so they're in
[43:51] the middle you already know these things
[43:52] so if you can't read it you'll know what
[43:54] it is amen so here's the soul now God's
[43:57] design was to come in for Adam he was to
[44:01] rule this is the image that God created
[44:03] in Adam out of that's the image of God
[44:06] now God created him a body and gave him
[44:09] a spirit and that spirit is his mind
[44:11] it's his affections it's it's it's it's
[44:13] a spirit realm that you cannot see
[44:15] that's what makes him who he is God's
[44:17] design was to move on the
[44:20] inside of of this man here and live his
[44:25] desires his life through his thought
[44:28] process his Spirit man as well as his
[44:30] body that was God's Great design amen so
[44:34] what God does through the new birth
[44:37] that's what he does he comes in cleans
[44:39] out the throne room of the heart cleans
[44:41] it all out he moves on the inside he
[44:44] begins to think you you begin to think
[44:47] his thoughts you begin to act his ways
[44:51] you begin to meditate on the right
[44:53] things you amen your memory is you
[44:56] everything is direct directed by that
[44:58] Soul this Spirit Rim becomes in contact
[45:02] and because of that you entertain Angels
[45:06] amen God's living in you he is he is now
[45:09] you're able to come to church and you
[45:12] feel his presence you come when the word
[45:15] is being preached the soul agrees amen
[45:18] but the soul now the soul in itself amen
[45:22] it it it can't express like it wants to
[45:24] so it has the spirit there here's where
[45:27] your personality is that's the reason
[45:29] why every one of us are all different in
[45:31] our personalities that's the reason why
[45:33] we can all receive the word and someone
[45:36] will shout someone else will cry amen
[45:38] that's your spirit man amen but it is
[45:41] being influenced by the soul so you can
[45:44] come in amen some of you uh dance the
[45:48] aisles and the others of you just got
[45:50] your hands up in the air and and and and
[45:52] you're speaking in tongues or you there
[45:54] might be somebody else that has it is
[45:57] all the same working of God in that
[46:00] regenerated soul in in uh in your spirit
[46:05] using your personality using who you are
[46:09] to reflect what that soul is
[46:12] experiencing on the inside so that means
[46:14] we're not all we're not all shouting we
[46:17] might not all be uh dancing we might not
[46:20] all but that does not change that the
[46:23] word is not had its effect in that soul
[46:27] and that soul is rejoicing either
[46:31] way can you say Amen now so Satan comes
[46:35] in he sees what God has done amen so he
[46:38] takes the unregenerated
[46:40] heart
[46:42] amen and then he starts and then he just
[46:45] makes him religious so now the that now
[46:48] he's religious he's coming to church
[46:50] amen and he's he's he's learning the
[46:53] Bible and he's learning things and
[46:56] because of what he is learning and
[46:57] hearing of the genuine Word of Life he
[47:02] is learning to yield himself to the same
[47:06] spirit that the man who is Born Again
[47:09] yields himself
[47:11] to come on Hallelujah so this man here
[47:15] can yield himself to the same holy ghost
[47:19] that the genuine believer can yield
[47:20] himself to and will have the same
[47:24] manifestations his heart is is not right
[47:28] his heart does not want his heart's full
[47:30] of adultery his heart's full of sin his
[47:33] heart's full of bitterness his heart's
[47:35] full of envy and strife he's not
[47:37] converted but he comes to church and the
[47:41] spirit of the Lord that is moving in the
[47:44] church he can speak in
[47:47] tongues it's the same spirit it's the
[47:50] spirit real that manifests these things
[47:55] amen he can believe the spirit man can
[47:58] believe he can he can he can mimic
[48:02] anything that the word of God produces
[48:05] because he has learnt Hallelujah brother
[48:08] brandham says those witches th those
[48:10] witches that that uh would come and tell
[48:12] brother brandom who he was now let's
[48:15] let's just let's let's just call this
[48:17] guy right here a witch
[48:19] Hallelujah did I spell that right all
[48:22] right so
[48:24] which dark evil
[48:27] but when brother brandham the brother
[48:31] brandham would come into their presence
[48:33] because she was connected into that
[48:37] other RM she could tell him you're born
[48:39] with a
[48:40] sign tell them the date tell him he's a
[48:43] preacher how can he do that how did how
[48:47] did how did the Simon the
[48:50] Sorcerer well how was Simon the Sorcerer
[48:53] able to tell the people about
[48:55] Paul yeah
[48:57] and Paul turned around and says you are
[49:00] evil in your
[49:03] heart so these men were not converted
[49:07] but because they were able to yield
[49:10] themselves and now this is where I this
[49:13] is where amen I I I think that that that
[49:16] the church the elect of God needs to
[49:19] needs to get it get it together because
[49:21] if the spirit of God can work in a witch
[49:25] and the spirit of God can cause somebody
[49:27] who has an evil heart Amen to speak in
[49:30] tongues and and and even give prophecy
[49:33] and it be accurate like balum like like
[49:37] uh Caiaphas and and and many others in
[49:39] the scripture then how much more if God
[49:42] gave the Holy Ghost for the elect so
[49:46] that he can live his life and reflect
[49:49] through us how much more should we be
[49:51] Desiring that in our walks with God in
[49:54] this last day amen now it's not going to
[49:57] be a public show you know where where
[49:59] guys up here and and calling people out
[50:01] and doing you know and this that and the
[50:03] other and and you know God used a
[50:06] prophet to declare his word to show that
[50:10] was that was God Amen letting the world
[50:13] know that hey amen the this this is real
[50:16] and I want you to hear what this man has
[50:18] to say can you say Amen now but there
[50:21] there there are those things in our
[50:23] lives so I want you to understand that
[50:25] before uh uh uh before we go any further
[50:27] you've got to be so so here you can
[50:30] speak in this is where brother Brandon
[50:33] made the made the statement you can have
[50:35] the Holy Ghost every day of your life
[50:38] and still go to
[50:39] hell that's how it's done not here you
[50:44] ain't got the Holy Ghost here you've got
[50:46] the Holy Ghost here and that's the
[50:49] reason you can speak in tongues and then
[50:51] go out and commit adultery that's the
[50:53] reason you can have prophecy a and go
[50:55] out there and and and and and and wear
[50:58] your makeup and and and wear your pants
[51:01] you ladies and and do all of those
[51:02] things there because you're unconverted
[51:05] but if you ever get this here converted
[51:08] amen you get that real conversion of the
[51:12] heart and you receive the Holy Ghost
[51:15] right
[51:16] here you're sealed into the day of
[51:20] redemption seal it that's that's the
[51:22] ceiling we're looking for and you can
[51:25] have you can have have this ceiling and
[51:27] never speak in tongues a day in your
[51:30] life you can have this ceiling amen and
[51:33] never but you will have you will have
[51:36] one key manifestation that you are to
[51:39] look for that's a changed life a changed
[51:42] heart that believes every word of
[51:45] God can you say Amen
[51:48] now so so to how many understands that
[51:51] does that does that make it pretty clear
[51:53] amen so so we we don't want to say oh
[51:57] I've done all of this and then at that
[52:00] day I never knew you I never had an
[52:03] intimate relationship my seed was never
[52:06] placed in your soul you're a terror
[52:08] you're not a uh you're you're not a
[52:11] you're not a son of God can you say Amen
[52:14] now now to say some of these things um I
[52:17] and and we have already been looking
[52:19] through the church age book and I I I I
[52:22] I want us to go back and look at a few
[52:24] things just real quickly uh
[52:27] um that we have already looked at well
[52:29] that that we uh that maybe some of these
[52:32] we have not looked at but let's let's
[52:34] turn to page 249 just real quickly and
[52:38] um and and then
[52:44] we'll now so so here because we have
[52:48] this then now we've
[52:51] got so many in the message that has done
[52:54] away with the gifts and even the baptism
[52:57] of the Holy Ghost saying that all we
[52:59] want now all we need is just the word
[53:02] well do do you remember what brother
[53:04] brandham said in the invisible Union of
[53:06] the Bride he says the only kind that the
[53:10] word will produce is acts 238 screaming
[53:15] blabbering younging and they don't want
[53:19] that in their ecomic society right so so
[53:24] brother Brandon would say if you say you
[53:26] want the word you're not going to do
[53:30] away with any portion of the word right
[53:34] Hallelujah now hey I came out of
[53:37] Pentecost and if there was anybody that
[53:40] was that when I came into the message
[53:42] and when I seen amen the truth here amen
[53:46] I I'm going to tell you right now I
[53:47] could care I could have cared Le
[53:49] couldn't have cared any less if someone
[53:51] prophesied over me seen a vision over me
[53:53] or anything I was through with it I I
[53:56] I'd seen so much of the other I didn't
[53:58] want I you know what amen I I was ready
[54:00] to send you to hell if you even you even
[54:02] started telling me something from the
[54:04] Lord because I seen so much
[54:09] nonsense right but I was
[54:12] wrong I was wrong in My Heart by pushing
[54:17] by pushing that far off I was in one
[54:19] ditch and I and it was easy for me to
[54:21] come back over in this other ditch it's
[54:24] in the middle of the road there's where
[54:27] the spiritual church is not an
[54:29] emotionalism and not over here saying
[54:32] well I've got the word and I don't need
[54:33] none of those manifestations and I don't
[54:35] need and what you do is you just throw
[54:36] the you you you throw the Holy Ghost
[54:38] right out too because the manifestation
[54:40] of those gifts are from the Holy Ghost
[54:44] and if you want the Holy Ghost you're
[54:46] going to have those manifestations in
[54:48] your church that's what brother brandom
[54:50] said amen so amen so let's look here at
[54:55] at at page uh 2 49 and we're going to go
[54:57] down to the very last um uh chap U
[55:02] paragraph Paul was the first messenger
[55:04] and he said in Galatians 1:8 that if any
[55:07] Angel any messenger any viker no matter
[55:11] who he was if he preached any other
[55:14] gospel than Paul preached let him be
[55:16] accursed Paul knew that after he was
[55:19] gone Grievous wolves would come in he
[55:21] knew that Satan himself would appear as
[55:22] an angel of Light so how much more his
[55:26] ministers so he warns that this gospel
[55:30] would always be the same now Paul had
[55:34] baptized in Jesus name and re-baptized
[55:36] people where uh who where people had not
[55:39] been so immersed he set the church in
[55:43] order taught the proper use of the
[55:46] spirit and confirmed that they were to
[55:50] remain in the church till Jesus comes
[55:53] now I want you to catch that they didn't
[55:55] do away with the Corinth an he didn't
[55:57] say you know you're just a bunch of
[55:59] spiritual babies and they were and he
[56:00] did tell them they were babies but he
[56:02] was saying you got to get it in
[56:05] order you see what I'm saying so the
[56:08] gifts were to remain he says that's the
[56:11] next Messengers and all remaining six
[56:13] would by the same Holy Ghost burn with
[56:15] the same fire give the same light of the
[56:17] Gospel of Jesus Christ and signs would
[56:20] follow them can you say amen amen let's
[56:23] let's go on down um just just uh for uh
[56:27] the sake uh let's go down to the second
[56:30] uh paragraph here for the sake of time
[56:32] so we see the seven spirits actually
[56:34] refer to the one spirit of God working
[56:38] out the will and the word of God in
[56:39] different Generations I would like to
[56:42] illustrate that from the that from the
[56:44] word the spirit of God was mightily upon
[56:46] Elijah then that same P Spirit come upon
[56:49] Elisha in a two-fold way then centuries
[56:52] later The Same Spirit which we call the
[56:55] spirit of Elijah in order to describe
[56:57] his ministry came back upon John the
[56:59] Baptist one day that same Spirit
[57:01] identified by the same manner of
[57:03] ministry will come upon a man for the
[57:05] end of the Gentile Age
[57:08] Again the church says or the scripture
[57:11] says that God anointed Jesus with the
[57:13] Holy Ghost and power he went about doing
[57:16] good and healing all that were oppressed
[57:17] of the devil and Jesus went away as
[57:20] Jesus went away he told his disciples to
[57:23] T until Pentecost at which the very same
[57:27] spirit that was upon him would come back
[57:30] and fall upon them and F them then that
[57:33] called out body the church would be in
[57:36] his stad upon the Earth taking his place
[57:39] and because that same spirit that was in
[57:42] him would be in them they would do the
[57:44] very same Works any people that is truly
[57:46] the body of Jesus Christ the true church
[57:49] WIll manifest the same works as Jesus as
[57:52] as did Jesus and the Pentecostal church
[57:54] because the Same Spirit Will in them any
[57:57] other Church uh that does not have the
[58:00] spirit and the
[58:01] manifestations is going to give an
[58:04] account before God so you've got to have
[58:06] remember where the spirit is there will
[58:08] be the
[58:09] manifestations amen that's God and and
[58:12] and we want to say h well we well well
[58:14] we just don't believe in him well you're
[58:16] going to have to if you're going to
[58:17] understand the spirit of the
[58:18] day amen Spirit of wisdom the gift of
[58:22] wisdom the gift of knowledge the gift of
[58:25] faith
[58:26] these are things that come from the
[58:28] spirit of God Amen these are part of
[58:32] that in and and uh and a part of our
[58:36] Lives now uh for the sake of uh amen um
[58:42] for the sake of time let's go down to
[58:44] the next let's go to the next 251 and
[58:47] down to the second paragraph Yes the
[58:50] spirit is not seven spirits but one he
[58:53] will always be the same and act the same
[58:57] the seven Messengers will have the same
[58:59] spirit and teach the same word and have
[59:02] the same power and if the church is the
[59:05] true church she will have the same the
[59:07] very same spirit and word and acts of
[59:10] power that they had at Pentecost by
[59:12] experience it will be a Pentecostal
[59:14] Church there will be tongues
[59:17] interpretation prophecy healings God
[59:20] will be in the midst of her and God will
[59:23] declare himself in the midst of her as
[59:26] he always has Hallelujah she will be H
[59:30] uh
[59:31] unorganized don't forget that can you
[59:34] say Amen so so there there's there's
[59:38] there's a lot of those things in there
[59:39] now so the reason I wanted to bring um
[59:42] uh these in is is is to let you know now
[59:46] now brother Bram says they will be a
[59:49] part of the church now I want us to
[59:52] let's just turn to the book of um first
[59:56] 1 Corinthians in the 12th chapter here
[59:59] and um I want us to just read uh what
[1:00:02] the gifts are and with us you know um I
[1:00:07] don't know if anyone just has has really
[1:00:10] just read these but there are three
[1:00:11] chapters in the book of First
[1:00:13] Corinthians uh that deal with the gifts
[1:00:15] of the Spirit and and these are um are
[1:00:20] are incredibly wonderful U uh chapters
[1:00:23] here and I think I think you could
[1:00:26] understand a little more uh you know of
[1:00:29] what brother Bram was dealing with and
[1:00:31] but let's just look and see what God put
[1:00:34] in the church and this is what it's
[1:00:36] supposed to be in the church now again
[1:00:39] this is not for the backslider this is
[1:00:41] not for those outside there but when you
[1:00:43] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:46] then we should we should um expect to
[1:00:50] see these gifts manifested in in our
[1:00:54] lives amen so let's look here in in um 1
[1:00:57] Corinthians 12 and
[1:00:59] 1 it says now Brethren or or now
[1:01:03] concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I
[1:01:05] would have you I would not have you
[1:01:07] ignorant you know that ye were Gentiles
[1:01:10] carried away and with these dumb Idols
[1:01:13] even as you were lad wherefore I gave
[1:01:15] you to understand give you to understand
[1:01:18] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[1:01:19] God calls Jesus a curse and that no man
[1:01:23] can say that Jesus is the Lord but by
[1:01:26] the Holy Ghost now there are diversities
[1:01:28] of gifts but the Same Spirit there are
[1:01:32] differences of administration but the
[1:01:34] same Lord there are div diversities of
[1:01:37] operation but it is the same God which
[1:01:40] worketh all in all but the manifestation
[1:01:44] of the spirit is given to every man to
[1:01:46] profit withle for to one is given the
[1:01:50] spirit of the word of w by the spirit
[1:01:53] the word of wisdom to another the word
[1:01:56] of knowledge by The Same Spirit to
[1:01:59] another Faith by The Same Spirit to
[1:02:02] another the gifts of healing by The Same
[1:02:05] Spirit and I want you to notice gifts
[1:02:07] not Gift gifts of healing to another the
[1:02:11] working of Miracles to another prophecy
[1:02:14] to another Discerning of spirits to
[1:02:16] another diverse kinds of tongues to
[1:02:20] another interpretation of tongues but
[1:02:23] these but all these worketh that one and
[1:02:26] self-same spirit dividing to every man
[1:02:30] severally as he will now if you'll
[1:02:33] notice tongues and interpretation of
[1:02:34] tongues they're not on top of the
[1:02:38] list they're on the bottom of the list
[1:02:41] and as we read the Apostle Paul says
[1:02:46] listen this this is just to edify you
[1:02:50] and and as we read on we'll find that
[1:02:52] the Apostle Paul says covet one of those
[1:02:55] other gifts
[1:02:56] more than the
[1:02:58] tongues amen because it can edify the
[1:03:02] church whereas the speaking in tongues
[1:03:04] simply edifies yourself unless it has
[1:03:07] been interpreted amen all right so let's
[1:03:10] let's read on down for as the body is
[1:03:13] one and has many members and all the
[1:03:16] members of that one body being many are
[1:03:19] one body so also is Christ for by one
[1:03:24] Spirit are we all baptized into one body
[1:03:27] whether we be Jews or Gentiles Bond or
[1:03:30] free and have been all made to drink uh
[1:03:34] into that one Spirit into one Spirit but
[1:03:36] the B for the body is not one member but
[1:03:39] many if the foot shall say because I'm
[1:03:42] not the hand I am not of the body is it
[1:03:45] therefore not of the body if the ears
[1:03:47] shall say because I'm not the eye I I uh
[1:03:51] I'm am not of the body is it therefore
[1:03:53] not of the body if the whole body were
[1:03:56] an eye where were the hearing if the
[1:03:59] whole were hearing where were the
[1:04:01] smelling but now hath God set the
[1:04:04] members every one of them in the body as
[1:04:07] it have pleased him if they were all one
[1:04:10] member where were the body now I'm just
[1:04:13] just just what we've read right here do
[1:04:15] you see do you see the error that
[1:04:18] speaking in tongues is the evidence of
[1:04:21] the Holy Ghost the Apostle Paul is
[1:04:24] clearly putting out
[1:04:26] this one's going to do this this one's
[1:04:28] this this one's this now listen he just
[1:04:31] put it all out there the nine spiritual
[1:04:33] gifts and then he says because I'm not
[1:04:35] the eye I'm not because I'm not now
[1:04:37] watch watch what he's saying amen he
[1:04:40] says if uh 19th verse if they were all
[1:04:42] one member where were the body if they
[1:04:45] were all speaking in
[1:04:48] tongues now but now are they many
[1:04:53] members but yet one body the ey cannot
[1:04:56] say under the hand I have no need of
[1:04:57] thee nor again the head to the feet I
[1:05:00] have no need of you ye nay much more
[1:05:03] those members of the body which seem
[1:05:05] more feeble or necessary and those
[1:05:07] members of the body which we think less
[1:05:09] honorable upon these we bestow more
[1:05:11] abundant honor and our uncomely parts
[1:05:14] have more abundant cless for our comely
[1:05:16] Parts have no
[1:05:18] need uh but God hath tempered the body
[1:05:21] together having given more abundant
[1:05:24] honor to that which lath
[1:05:26] which lacked that there should be no
[1:05:28] Schism in the body that the members
[1:05:31] should have the same care for one
[1:05:32] another whether one member suffers all
[1:05:35] the members suffer with it when one
[1:05:38] member be honored all the members
[1:05:39] Rejoice with it now ye are the body of
[1:05:42] Christ and members in particular God has
[1:05:45] set some in the church first apostles
[1:05:47] secondarily prophets thirdly teachers
[1:05:50] after that Miracles then Gifts of
[1:05:52] healing helps governments diversities of
[1:05:54] tongues are all
[1:05:56] Apostles are all prophets are all
[1:06:00] teachers are all workers of Miracles
[1:06:04] have all the gifts of healing do all
[1:06:07] speak with tongues do all
[1:06:10] interpret but covet
[1:06:13] earnestly the best gift and yet I show
[1:06:17] unto
[1:06:18] you a more excellent way can you say
[1:06:22] Amen so so now the Apostle Paul
[1:06:26] is is is bringing it back in now he
[1:06:27] takes the body and the different members
[1:06:29] and he's and he's showing the more uh
[1:06:31] feeble and and and he's and he's letting
[1:06:33] you know that we all have our part but
[1:06:36] then he brings it right back again to
[1:06:38] these
[1:06:39] gifts amen do do do you see that now
[1:06:43] Pentecost says if you have not and and
[1:06:46] this is this is the way they I I'd say
[1:06:50] 99.9 believe if you don't speak in
[1:06:53] tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:57] did did you kids did you did y'all hear
[1:07:00] where the Apostle Paul was separating
[1:07:02] and letting them letting all of us know
[1:07:04] that these gifts are all different and
[1:07:07] they're all given to different people y
[1:07:09] you kids understand that you you adults
[1:07:13] understand that that if you read that's
[1:07:16] what that's what brother brandom kept
[1:07:17] coming back to us and telling hey come
[1:07:19] on come back to the word because the
[1:07:21] word will correct the issue
[1:07:24] here but now what you'll never uh uh
[1:07:27] what you'll never take away is the gifts
[1:07:31] the gifts are part of the church even
[1:07:34] though Satan can do it Hallelujah I I
[1:07:38] remember uh when we were selling shoes
[1:07:40] and I went into Walmart to go buy
[1:07:42] something and uh uh and and I gave him a
[1:07:46] $100 bill and before you know it I had
[1:07:48] security and policeman all over me and
[1:07:50] the these guys I mean they were pounding
[1:07:52] me where'd you get that $100 bill I want
[1:07:54] to know where you and this that and the
[1:07:56] other and I I kept telling them over and
[1:07:57] over I'm a Salesman I was just giv oh
[1:07:59] yeah you know they tell us who this take
[1:08:02] us to this person I said I don't know
[1:08:04] it's just like Walmart here uh I sold a
[1:08:07] product and someone gave me a
[1:08:09] counterfeit and and U uh so they
[1:08:14] harassed me and hounded me and I said
[1:08:16] listen you can have the $100 bill I I
[1:08:20] wasn't trying to uh and and the funniest
[1:08:23] thing is after all these guys I mean
[1:08:25] these policemen were giving me all this
[1:08:27] you know what they ended up
[1:08:28] doing I ended up with a $100 bill back
[1:08:31] in my pocket after
[1:08:33] all after all that commotion and I I
[1:08:35] brought the $100 back home uh to to show
[1:08:38] everybody but uh but just
[1:08:41] because just because there is a
[1:08:44] counterfeit $100 bill does not mean I'm
[1:08:47] going to quit using $100 bills right
[1:08:50] just because there's a counterfeit does
[1:08:53] not take away from that can you amen now
[1:08:58] let's read a little bit more in this uh
[1:09:00] let's go to the 13th chapter here amen
[1:09:04] he says though I speak with tongues of
[1:09:07] men and
[1:09:08] angels and have not
[1:09:11] charity I become as sounding brass or a
[1:09:14] tinkling symbol though I have the gift
[1:09:17] of Prophecy that's one of the gifts
[1:09:20] understand all Mysteries that's one of
[1:09:21] the gifts have all knowledge that's
[1:09:24] another of the gifts and though I have
[1:09:26] all Faith that's another gift so that I
[1:09:29] could remove mountains and have not
[1:09:32] charity I am nothing though I bestow all
[1:09:37] my goods to feed the poor though I give
[1:09:39] my body to be burned and have not
[1:09:42] charity it profiteth me nothing charity
[1:09:46] suffers long is
[1:09:48] kind charity envies not charity vauth
[1:09:52] not itself is not puffed up do not
[1:09:55] behave itself
[1:09:57] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[1:10:00] easily provoked thinketh no evil
[1:10:03] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[1:10:06] in truth beareth all things believeth
[1:10:09] all things hopeth all things endureth
[1:10:12] all things charity never fails but
[1:10:15] whether there be prophecies they shall
[1:10:17] fail whether there be tongues they shall
[1:10:19] cease whether there be knowledge it
[1:10:22] shall vanish away for we know in part
[1:10:24] and we prophesy in part but when that
[1:10:27] which is perfect has come then that
[1:10:29] which is done uh in part shall be done
[1:10:32] away with now that does not mean when
[1:10:34] you get perfect word then you're not
[1:10:36] going to have
[1:10:37] that amen the we are we are all striving
[1:10:41] to preach the same gospel that the
[1:10:43] Apostle Paul
[1:10:45] preached and he had the gifts but he was
[1:10:47] saying when that new body comes you're
[1:10:50] not going to need the gifts of healing
[1:10:53] the gifts of Miracles when that which is
[1:10:55] perfect has come now we understand the
[1:10:58] perfect word has come which is the
[1:11:00] rapturing church and as I read and as I
[1:11:02] read that quote to you the other day
[1:11:04] amen that that word that you have
[1:11:07] received is creating a body around it
[1:11:09] and you're fixing to move into that amen
[1:11:12] it took this message this gospel message
[1:11:15] the opening of the seals to bring us
[1:11:17] into that beautiful part amen now it
[1:11:21] says um for we know in part and we
[1:11:24] prophesy in part but when that which is
[1:11:26] perfect is come then that which is in
[1:11:28] part shall be done away with when I was
[1:11:29] a child I spake as a child I understood
[1:11:32] as a child I thought as a child but when
[1:11:34] I was become a man I put away childish
[1:11:37] things for now we see through a glass
[1:11:39] Darkly he's talking about that world in
[1:11:41] this world but then face to face for now
[1:11:45] I know in part but then shall I know
[1:11:47] even as I am known now abideth faith
[1:11:50] hope charity these things but the
[1:11:53] greatest of these is charity it follow
[1:11:57] after
[1:11:58] charity and desire spiritual gifts but
[1:12:03] rather that you may prophesy for he that
[1:12:06] speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh
[1:12:09] not unto men but unto God for no man
[1:12:14] understandeth him how be it in the
[1:12:16] spirit he speaketh he speaketh Mysteries
[1:12:19] but he that prophesieth speaketh unto
[1:12:22] men to edification and exhortation and
[1:12:24] comfort
[1:12:26] he that speaketh in an unknown tongue
[1:12:27] edifieth himself but he that prophesieth
[1:12:30] utter edifieth the church I would that
[1:12:34] ye all speak with tongues but rather
[1:12:37] that ye prophesied for greater is he
[1:12:40] that prophesieth and he that speaketh
[1:12:42] with
[1:12:43] tongues except he interpret that the
[1:12:46] church may receive edifica
[1:12:48] edifying but now uh now Brethren if I
[1:12:51] come unto you speaking with tongues what
[1:12:53] shall I profit you except I shall speak
[1:12:56] to you either by Revelation or by
[1:12:58] knowledge or by prophesying or by
[1:13:01] Doctrine even things without lifegiving
[1:13:04] sound whether they be pipe or harp
[1:13:06] except they give a distinction in the
[1:13:08] sounds how shall it be known what uh
[1:13:11] what is piped or harped but if the
[1:13:14] trumpet give an uncertain sound Who
[1:13:16] Shall Gather himself to the battle so
[1:13:19] likewise except you utter by the Tongue
[1:13:23] words easy to be understood
[1:13:26] how shall it be known what is spoken for
[1:13:29] ye shall speak into the air there are it
[1:13:32] may be so many kinds of voices in the
[1:13:35] world and none of them is without
[1:13:37] significance therefore if I know not the
[1:13:39] meaning of the voice I shall be unto him
[1:13:42] that speaketh a barbarian and he that
[1:13:45] speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me
[1:13:49] even so ye for as much as ye are zealous
[1:13:52] of spiritual gifts now he's correct his
[1:13:55] church here the Apostle Paul is is
[1:13:57] telling all of these tongue talkers seek
[1:14:00] ye that you may excel to the edifying of
[1:14:03] the church wherefore let him that
[1:14:06] speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
[1:14:09] he may interpret for if I pray in an
[1:14:12] unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my
[1:14:15] understanding is unfruitful what is it
[1:14:17] then I will pray with the spirit and I
[1:14:20] will pray with the understanding also I
[1:14:23] will sing with the spirit I will sing
[1:14:25] with understanding also else when thou
[1:14:28] shalt bless uh with the spirit how shall
[1:14:31] he that occupytheweb
[1:14:55] in the church I had rather speak five
[1:14:56] words with my understanding than by my
[1:15:00] voice uh that by my voice I may teach
[1:15:03] others
[1:15:04] also that uh than 10,000 wors in an
[1:15:07] unknown tongue Brethren be not children
[1:15:10] in understanding how be in Malice be ye
[1:15:13] children but in understanding be men in
[1:15:16] the law it is written with the men of
[1:15:19] other tongues and with other lips will I
[1:15:22] speak unto this people and yet for all
[1:15:24] the they will not hear me sayeth the
[1:15:26] Lord wherefore tongues are for a sign
[1:15:30] not to them that believe but to them
[1:15:32] that believe not but prophesying serveth
[1:15:35] not for them that believe not but for
[1:15:37] them which believe if therefore the
[1:15:39] whole church come together in one place
[1:15:42] and all speak with tongues and there
[1:15:44] come in those that are unlearned or
[1:15:47] unbelievers will they not say that ye
[1:15:49] are mad but if I'll prophesy and there
[1:15:53] come in one that believes not or one
[1:15:56] unlearned he he is convinced of all he
[1:15:59] is judged of all and thus are the
[1:16:02] secrets of his heart made manifest and
[1:16:05] so falling down on his face he will
[1:16:07] worship God and report that God is in
[1:16:09] you of a truth how is it then Brethren
[1:16:12] when you come together every one of you
[1:16:14] has a Psalm a Doctrine a tongue has a
[1:16:18] revelation and interpretation let all
[1:16:21] things be done unto edifying If any man
[1:16:24] speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by
[1:16:27] two or three at the most uh at the most
[1:16:30] by three that by course and let everyone
[1:16:33] interpret but if there be no interpreter
[1:16:35] let him keep silent in the church let
[1:16:38] him speak to himself and to God let the
[1:16:41] prophet speak two or three and and the
[1:16:43] other judge if anything be revealed to
[1:16:46] another that Seth by let the first hold
[1:16:49] his peace for ye may all prophesy one by
[1:16:53] one that all may learn and all be
[1:16:55] comforted and the spirits of the
[1:16:57] prophets are subject to the prophets for
[1:17:00] the Lord is not the author of confusion
[1:17:02] but of Peace as in all churches of the
[1:17:05] Saints now let your women keep silence
[1:17:08] in the church for it is not permitted
[1:17:09] unto them to speak for they are
[1:17:11] commanded to be under obedience as also
[1:17:13] saith the law if they will learn
[1:17:15] anything let them ask their husbands at
[1:17:18] home for it is shame for a woman to
[1:17:20] speak in the church what came the word
[1:17:23] out from you or came unto you only if
[1:17:27] any man think himself to be a prophet or
[1:17:29] a spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[1:17:32] things that I write unto you are the
[1:17:33] Commandments of the Lord but if any man
[1:17:36] be ignorant let him be ignorant
[1:17:39] wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy
[1:17:41] forbid not to speak with tongues and let
[1:17:44] all things be done decently and in order
[1:17:48] can the church say
[1:17:50] Amen now so we can see that it is a true
[1:17:57] manifestation these are true
[1:18:00] characteristics of the Holy Ghost but
[1:18:03] Satan comes in and and tries to
[1:18:07] counterfeit
[1:18:09] them so as as we have as as we go on uh
[1:18:14] further uh uh this next Wednesday night
[1:18:17] we will we will take uh we will continue
[1:18:20] on with what brother bradam is saying
[1:18:22] there and how that amen how that
[1:18:24] Satanist came in in in this church age
[1:18:29] to
[1:18:30] counteract what God is doing because he
[1:18:34] found a way to
[1:18:36] counteract the gifts and thus amen uh uh
[1:18:42] thinking that the church has arrived and
[1:18:44] that's why brother brandham says they
[1:18:45] thought 1906 that they had arrived but
[1:18:48] he says but they did not because the
[1:18:50] latter or the former Reign had to come
[1:18:53] first which had to be the opening of the
[1:18:55] book there had to be the teaching of the
[1:18:58] word first so that that watering amen so
[1:19:02] that so that the spirit of God could
[1:19:04] live itself through you you in other
[1:19:06] words you can have the tongues and you
[1:19:08] can have the nine spiritual gifts but if
[1:19:10] you don't have the word the Conquering
[1:19:13] power is in the
[1:19:15] word and so it had we there had to be a
[1:19:18] 1906 there had to be a baptism of the
[1:19:22] Holy Ghost to receive that word word
[1:19:25] when it
[1:19:26] came there has to be that to receive
[1:19:29] that word when it came amen and if
[1:19:32] you've got the Holy Ghost the word
[1:19:34] always comes to the spirit field is that
[1:19:37] what not what we read here a couple
[1:19:39] Wednesday nights ago the word comes to
[1:19:41] the spirit field now those guys Satan
[1:19:43] want to say it's all over here it's all
[1:19:45] over here it's in it's in this this this
[1:19:46] this this this and that's fine and
[1:19:48] they've all went and they've they they
[1:19:50] have he he's been successful the word
[1:19:54] the the word words of a prophet means
[1:19:55] little nothing to these guys it's all in
[1:19:58] the gifts that's all right but the elect
[1:20:02] the Holy Ghost baptism comes to you to
[1:20:06] receive that word and as you receive
[1:20:09] that word amen sure the manifestations
[1:20:12] of the holy spirit's going to be there
[1:20:13] in your life amen and sure you're going
[1:20:16] to cast out devils and sure you're going
[1:20:19] to raise the dead and do Miracles and
[1:20:20] speak with tongues and have prophecy and
[1:20:23] there everyone amen as you walk with God
[1:20:25] they're all going to line right up
[1:20:27] because it is the genuine spirit of God
[1:20:31] not on a rep probate but upon sons of
[1:20:35] God Amen all right so any questions here
[1:20:39] tonight anything y'all want to add or a
[1:20:41] question y'all might have praise the
[1:20:44] Lord lots of reading here tonight amen
[1:20:48] but but I I um you know I I I got to
[1:20:51] thinking you know
[1:20:55] it's it's sad it's sad but maybe some of
[1:20:57] you kids have never even known that
[1:20:59] those chapters are in the Bible amen
[1:21:02] because we We Don't Preach from it much
[1:21:04] when we do preach from it we we just
[1:21:06] take a few few little verses but but the
[1:21:09] the the gifts and the operations and and
[1:21:12] I I think I think we that the Apostle
[1:21:15] Paul says I I I think that you should
[1:21:18] all desire to prophesy that that's
[1:21:21] that's what he said there in the in that
[1:21:23] uh 13th the 14 chapter he said I would
[1:21:26] that you all prophesied you know gifts
[1:21:29] he says that's that's the thing that am
[1:21:32] man an encouragement and things of that
[1:21:34] nature there amen so so any any
[1:21:37] questions before we get ready to to
[1:21:39] dismiss here this
[1:21:50] evening yeah
[1:21:55] false Christ yes that's right that's
[1:21:59] right and and and that's the reason I
[1:22:02] wanted to and and we could have just
[1:22:04] went straight into that tonight but I
[1:22:07] when when preparing for this um even
[1:22:11] last Wednesday night I I thought that I
[1:22:13] needed to go
[1:22:15] back um in order for there to be a false
[1:22:18] you need to see what the scripture is
[1:22:21] for the real that there brother brother
[1:22:24] Bram was not against tongues and the
[1:22:27] nine spiritual gifts he was
[1:22:30] saying but you're putting the emphasis
[1:22:32] on the wrong thing and and when we get
[1:22:35] into that this next Wednesday night you
[1:22:36] will you you you kids can truly
[1:22:39] understand that Satan takes that that
[1:22:43] that genuine gift amen and and and and
[1:22:48] puts it on that uh
[1:22:50] uh spirit man amen and there is
[1:22:54] genuinely they're they're it's as
[1:22:56] genuine the Holy Ghost as it can be but
[1:22:59] they're false they're
[1:23:02] repeat praise the Lord amen someone you
[1:23:07] know
[1:23:10] U well
[1:23:12] um Hagen Kenneth
[1:23:15] Hagen prophesied that brother brandham
[1:23:18] was was uh was was going to die okay now
[1:23:23] I don't I don't take anything that they
[1:23:25] say is but but this this you know uh
[1:23:29] they they collaborated uh um um Gordon
[1:23:35] Lindsay claim that they you know he got
[1:23:37] he got the he got the prophecy a few
[1:23:40] months before brother brandham died that
[1:23:43] that the the great one is is is uh the
[1:23:47] my Prophet has that he's he's going to
[1:23:50] leave the scene going to take him off
[1:23:52] the scene because he has left the word
[1:23:56] and and so um so apparently there was a
[1:23:59] bunch of these guys that were all there
[1:24:01] saying huh oh so they were all talking
[1:24:03] about the only one that could be was
[1:24:04] Brother Brad so these guys were saying
[1:24:06] that they they knew he was he was about
[1:24:09] to go well
[1:24:11] okay
[1:24:13] um first of all all prophecy is to be
[1:24:17] judged and and um but they had this and
[1:24:22] so
[1:24:24] so here here we have it they were saying
[1:24:26] that brother bradam was going to die
[1:24:29] they were saying and and and and and
[1:24:32] that portion came to pass but then they
[1:24:34] also said because he was because he was
[1:24:38] a false because he was uh leading people
[1:24:41] astray and that he was
[1:24:44] okay do you see how that that mixture
[1:24:48] can come in how that a a a an
[1:24:52] unconverted man
[1:24:55] can get into that Spirit real and can
[1:24:57] pull things that are
[1:24:59] genuinely right yeah and mix his own
[1:25:04] stuff into
[1:25:06] it that's that that's exactly what those
[1:25:09] guys done that's exactly what balum done
[1:25:13] that's exactly what these other guys
[1:25:15] done and so they're going
[1:25:18] around you they if they if if they are
[1:25:22] 90% right
[1:25:24] and 10% wrong you can't accept
[1:25:29] it if they're
[1:25:31] 99% wrong or right and 1% wrong you
[1:25:37] can't accept
[1:25:39] it now and that's the deal here in it
[1:25:43] now Hallelujah if there's men that rise
[1:25:47] up in our ranks in this in the message
[1:25:50] ranks that are
[1:25:52] prophesying and 70% of it is right and
[1:25:56] the other s of it it's you don't accept
[1:25:59] any of
[1:26:01] it don't accept any of
[1:26:05] it you you you can't now if God is
[1:26:09] genuinely speaking through a person it
[1:26:12] will be
[1:26:13] God and it will come it'll come to pass
[1:26:16] and you'll be able to hear from God but
[1:26:18] if there is but if there are prophecies
[1:26:21] Visions dreams and and and people's
[1:26:23] having to manipulate these things in
[1:26:25] order for them to fit and for them to
[1:26:26] work let me tell you man is mixed up in
[1:26:29] it and I don't want anything to do with
[1:26:32] it amen we don't we don't want that and
[1:26:36] so Kenneth hanen got it right he he got
[1:26:40] it halfway
[1:26:42] right good job so do
[1:26:50] witches
[1:26:51] amen evil men can be be anointed of the
[1:26:55] Holy Ghost or enter into that Spirit
[1:26:58] realm you can do
[1:27:00] it every one of you if you all spend
[1:27:03] more enough time and back back in those
[1:27:05] days that's why brother Brandon preached
[1:27:07] so hard against fasting amen he said you
[1:27:09] guys are doing your 40-day fast where
[1:27:11] you can't and then then you're
[1:27:12] hallucinating and you're going back and
[1:27:14] you're he says that you were he said
[1:27:16] many people got had had had got their
[1:27:18] minds into such neutral gear amen that
[1:27:21] they lost their minds by trying to enter
[1:27:24] into that realm and you can enter into
[1:27:26] that RM there I mean there there are
[1:27:28] there are gifted people with dreams and
[1:27:30] and and they uh get gifted people that
[1:27:33] can enter into that real but that
[1:27:35] doesn't make it thus sayeth the
[1:27:37] Lord but on the other hand you can have
[1:27:40] a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:43] the Holy Ghost within you will speak and
[1:27:46] bring things to pass will show things to
[1:27:48] come we'll give prophecy amen and and
[1:27:53] and and uh you know uh uh I've got I've
[1:27:56] got a bunch of in the church age book
[1:27:57] where brother Brandon was saying uh that
[1:27:59] it's to keep the church clean it's to
[1:28:02] point out sin it's to bring things under
[1:28:05] from under cover and showing them to the
[1:28:07] church so that all will Fear Can you say
[1:28:09] Amen so so you know we we we we don't we
[1:28:14] we we um uh we don't want to be anointed
[1:28:18] of the devil
[1:28:20] whatsoever we want that anointing of God
[1:28:22] to be upon us but just because there's a
[1:28:26] lot of that out there does it mean that
[1:28:27] some of you weren't born to prophesy
[1:28:29] some of you weren't born to preach the
[1:28:31] gospel some of you weren't born to to uh
[1:28:34] uh uh and and the Lord's one gives it
[1:28:36] the Lord's one that puts those things in
[1:28:38] you but the thing is is we got a desire
[1:28:40] that more than playing basketball and
[1:28:42] more than playing with with the games
[1:28:45] and more than the internet we've got to
[1:28:46] spend that time with the Lord in prayer
[1:28:48] in order for those gifts to even come
[1:28:49] out and manifest themselves in our lives
[1:28:51] but what's what what the problem is amen
[1:28:54] is is we've put all that stuff away so
[1:28:56] we don't need to get a hold of God we
[1:28:58] don't need to line our spirits up with
[1:29:00] God anymore we just believe the Bible
[1:29:02] and we're all going to heaven we have
[1:29:04] been given this word to destroy the
[1:29:06] enemy of this day and there's going to
[1:29:09] be those nine spiritual gifts operating
[1:29:12] in in in every one of us and defeating
[1:29:15] that devil but we've got to desire it
[1:29:17] someone ask me well well why don't we
[1:29:19] see that I said because no one likes it
[1:29:24] no one wants
[1:29:26] it doesn't mean that God don't want to
[1:29:28] give it it doesn't mean the Holy Ghost
[1:29:30] isn't here it's just that we are a
[1:29:32] carnal
[1:29:34] people can you I'm not talking about you
[1:29:36] as I'm talking about the message we're
[1:29:38] we're a carnal people amen and and we
[1:29:41] don't we don't crave those things like
[1:29:43] they did in in in in the old times can
[1:29:47] can you you see what I'm saying so so
[1:29:49] it's it's it's it's Lord Give Me Lord
[1:29:52] give me whatever you want for me me amen
[1:29:55] I'm not going to try to manufacture
[1:29:56] nothing but Lord I believe it's there
[1:29:58] and I'm just I'm just I'm calling out to
[1:30:00] you and say Lord I want to see your
[1:30:03] Supernatural work in in in my life in
[1:30:05] the church can you say Amen so yes that
[1:30:08] so we will get get back to that brother
[1:30:10] Merl because that's that is exactly amen
[1:30:13] it's the anointed ones at the end time
[1:30:16] brother Mitch
[1:30:25] the order of it Sanic
[1:30:29] justification baptism of the Holy
[1:30:33] Ghost how that all aligns well you it
[1:30:37] you can you can align it like that you
[1:30:40] know um uh you know brother brother
[1:30:44] brandham took he he took this as as the
[1:30:48] temple of God he took your body as the
[1:30:51] temple of God and so you've got
[1:30:54] there were the three compartments of the
[1:30:56] Tabernacle just as there's three
[1:30:58] compartments here and and so the outer
[1:31:01] courts was your body the inner courts
[1:31:05] which was the Holy place is your spirit
[1:31:08] man and then your the the soul is the
[1:31:11] holies of holies the outer courts there
[1:31:14] your body that's the the light the light
[1:31:16] of the eye amen the the sunlight was
[1:31:19] dependent upon that your your inner
[1:31:22] court or your holy place that's where
[1:31:25] man had to light physically light the
[1:31:28] candles and they had to constantly keep
[1:31:30] the the oil in it or the fire would go
[1:31:33] out and and and it lit up the it it lit
[1:31:36] up that room in there uh uh in in in
[1:31:40] that portion of the building but in the
[1:31:42] in this room here needed no light at all
[1:31:45] in the most holy place was where the Ark
[1:31:49] of the Covenant was and that's where the
[1:31:51] shikina presence of God himself abided
[1:31:54] within so you can go you can use this
[1:31:57] and type that out justification
[1:32:00] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:32:02] Holy Ghost amen dividing the the the
[1:32:05] Bible says dividing between spirit and
[1:32:07] soul you're there so so you can what you
[1:32:10] are built that Tabernacle brother Bram
[1:32:13] says that Tabernacle was built Amen in
[1:32:16] three compartments just as you are the
[1:32:18] Tabernacles of God where God comes in
[1:32:21] and moves in those things and that's
[1:32:23] Spirit realm amen that that Spirit realm
[1:32:26] is is is where the battle is amen that's
[1:32:31] your mind that's your personality that's
[1:32:33] that's
[1:32:34] where if if you're going to have any
[1:32:36] kind of problems it's going to be with
[1:32:38] your personality it's going to be with
[1:32:39] your mind your your your your memories
[1:32:43] your effect that's where everything's at
[1:32:44] right there in that Spirit realm amen
[1:32:48] and the poor guy that's never been saved
[1:32:50] well he ain't got nothing he ain't got
[1:32:52] nothing if he's if he's has got the Holy
[1:32:54] Ghost in there he ain't got nothing that
[1:32:55] he can do anything with to overcome it
[1:32:59] and so we line everything up according
[1:33:01] to that new
[1:33:02] birth
[1:33:11] amen yeah
[1:33:24] um well I I mean justification is
[1:33:29] justification is is is uh as as real as
[1:33:34] real can be right right at the first I
[1:33:37] mean it when God the blood of Jesus
[1:33:40] Christ when he justifies you you're you
[1:33:43] are you are
[1:33:45] Justified the problem is is before the
[1:33:49] opening of that
[1:33:51] word the the blood the filter was going
[1:33:54] through man's man's Theology and man's
[1:33:57] interpretation so so when you were
[1:34:00] repenting there was no true
[1:34:02] justification because you were repenting
[1:34:05] according to what this guy says or what
[1:34:07] that guy says or amen but when we reive
[1:34:10] the fullness of this word and it came
[1:34:12] down this is genuine justification when
[1:34:15] we come in and truly come before God and
[1:34:18] repent of all the denominational
[1:34:20] thoughts of all of our anything contrary
[1:34:24] to the will of God as has been brought
[1:34:26] forth in this day then is when true
[1:34:29] justification can come and that's when
[1:34:32] you can progress on into the things of
[1:34:34] the Lord and and and you know brother
[1:34:37] Brandon would teach you know how that
[1:34:39] you know each Church um amen gives their
[1:34:44] gives their own forgiveness so every
[1:34:47] brand has their own forgiveness so you
[1:34:48] can only be
[1:34:50] justified as far as what that truth is
[1:34:53] from that church but given this word
[1:34:56] here we have something to
[1:34:57] believe and it's a blood that'll cover
[1:35:01] everything if you're willing to believe
[1:35:02] that blood will justify you amen as
[1:35:06] brother Josh preached on Sunday that was
[1:35:07] powerful that that blood is is is a
[1:35:11] powerful cleansing agent amen if the
[1:35:13] musicians would
[1:35:16] come amen any anything else you want to
[1:35:18] add or or or ask here this
[1:35:21] evening praise the Lord
[1:35:28] yeah they you under the bus under the
[1:35:31] bus but we just read how a woman must be
[1:35:34] silent in the church can a woman
[1:35:36] prophesy yes yes a woman a woman can
[1:35:42] prophesy and as you were um and it's all
[1:35:46] put in it's all put in right there
[1:35:48] together and so
[1:35:51] um the Corinthian Church was was
[1:35:55] was um they were they were children just
[1:35:59] just really children and so we had
[1:36:01] people
[1:36:02] prophesying uh you know and then and
[1:36:06] then ladies giving their opinions and
[1:36:08] this that and the other and so so the
[1:36:12] brother brandham did say that yes a
[1:36:14] woman can prophesy any of she's entitled
[1:36:17] to any of those nine spiritual
[1:36:20] gifts asking the questions are are are
[1:36:23] or or bringing the um um there was just
[1:36:27] a lot of Uprising there was a lot of
[1:36:30] controversy going on in the in in the
[1:36:32] Corinthian Church that was uh that just
[1:36:36] it was a lot of
[1:36:37] Confusion And so um they were all trying
[1:36:41] to be spiritual including the ladies and
[1:36:43] and so the Apostle Paul was telling them
[1:36:45] listen let the guys handle this you
[1:36:48] ladies talk to your husbands at home and
[1:36:51] U brother Brenham says that's a good
[1:36:52] idea that's a good idea today Amen Let
[1:36:56] the men figure it out and you sisters
[1:36:58] ask your husbands at home and um amen it
[1:37:02] was good back
[1:37:04] then question no no no in these kind of
[1:37:07] deals this is not this is not the same
[1:37:09] kind of a deal back back in in the day
[1:37:13] they were it was it um it was a
[1:37:18] competing for spirituality and and so it
[1:37:21] was
[1:37:21] just it was just a a a big confusing
[1:37:25] mess but but brother brother brandham
[1:37:27] says in the church as far as um singing
[1:37:33] prophesying um any any of that kind of
[1:37:37] thing he said there's that's all right
[1:37:38] just
[1:37:39] no the authority and the
[1:37:43] uh leadership should be to the men and
[1:37:47] the ladies shouldn't be adding to the
[1:37:49] confusion you you see what I'm saying
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:37:57] yeah
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:02] yeah
[1:38:04] yeah that's right that's right that's
[1:38:08] right yeah not not interrupting that
[1:38:10] that's that's good too yeah where you
[1:38:12] you know when the minister is trying to
[1:38:13] preach and
[1:38:15] and and someone trying to prophesy or
[1:38:17] someone trying to step up and and ask
[1:38:20] questions or or this that and the other
[1:38:21] you know but in this this portion of the
[1:38:24] service that's what we want is just to
[1:38:25] be able to
[1:38:27] U any of you ladies are welcome to ask
[1:38:30] questions no wonder you ask Kobe to ask
[1:38:31] the
[1:38:35] question amen praise the Lord
[1:38:44] yeah yes that's that's right the the
[1:38:47] that the that uh the the
[1:38:51] woman has no no place of authority in in
[1:38:55] the
[1:38:56] church she's not to preach or to usurp
[1:39:00] authority over over the man in in any of
[1:39:03] the leadership roles or or or any of
[1:39:06] that kind of thing and so you yield that
[1:39:08] to the Lord and for sure there is it's
[1:39:12] it's not permitted for a woman to
[1:39:15] preach uh in the congregation you know
[1:39:18] the leadership should be to the man and
[1:39:22] if you've got questions about about
[1:39:25] things then instead of disrupting
[1:39:28] everything all around you and um uh I've
[1:39:32] been in some of those places where
[1:39:34] there's a lot of disruption going on by
[1:39:36] spiritual ladies amen so praise the
[1:39:40] Lord any anything else real quick are we
[1:39:43] all
[1:39:45] clear praise the
[1:39:50] Lord you can ask questions at home not C
[1:39:53] me at home

[1:40:34] for for the gifts back in the church I'm
[1:40:37] I'm all for it I'm all for it but do it
[1:40:40] the way the Apostle taught us to do it
[1:40:42] the Apostle Paul do it the way the
[1:40:44] Vindicated prophet in our generation has
[1:40:46] done it amen and I I I listen if God
[1:40:50] wants to step up I I I I believe what
[1:40:53] brother brandom says he's not quit
[1:40:55] prophesying he's not quit speaking in
[1:40:56] tongues he's not quit we might have amen
[1:41:00] and I think a lot of us just because we
[1:41:03] have seen the fanatic the fanatical side
[1:41:05] of it so much that we don't even want to
[1:41:06] get close to it well I'm going to tell
