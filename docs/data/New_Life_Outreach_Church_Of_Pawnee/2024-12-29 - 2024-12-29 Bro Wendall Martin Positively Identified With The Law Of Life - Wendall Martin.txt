that was wonderful amen and uh just just good to see uh everyone that is here today so honored to have brother Josiah and sister Mindy and the youngans God bless y'all and uh uh just just wonderful such a a delight and we're going to hear from Brother Josiah tonight and um so it's uh it's going to be a wonderful time um let's go ahead and and and find our scriptures here in 1 Corinthians uh 15 and 12 and um uh so good to to see everyone I trust everyone had a had a wonderful uh week with your families and and um amen uh Christmas season you get to be around your families and enjoy Fellowship around food and and um uh we we were able to spend some time on Christmas day with with Mom and Dad and just went on on a drive and and enjoyed that and then Friday um we we were there with esa's family and um had a really wonderful time with her family and so uh we were thankful for that uh did did y'all enjoy the the last Sunday night service uh I thought both Services were wonderful brother Zachary Wallace and then the the play and everything on on Sunday night it was just wonderful uh we sure enjoyed it and um and so um but if you have if you have uh if you found your scriptures there 1 Corinthians 15-12 it says now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not risen if Christ is not be not risen then our preaching uh then is our preaching Vain and your faith is also vain yay we are found false Witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not Christ raised if Christ be not raised your faith is vain Ye Ye are yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for Since By Man Came Death by man also come the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive aren't you glad for that let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your many blessings and we want to thank you Lord for uh the wonderful what this uh season represents to the believer we thank you Lord for Lord the the the wonderful presence that we uh know is Among Us here this morning and that song Because You Live we live also we have a hope in you father now Lord I'm asking that your your spirit would just be with us as we Endeavor to preach your word I pray Lord that the anointing would be not just upon me as the minister Lord though I I I truly ask for that father but Lord I I pray that you will be with the congregation as well be with those who aren't here this morning Lord you see uh the the fair weather family and and all them Lord over there with the baby dedication in Kansas and ask that you would bless them and be with be with the services there father Lord be with brother Kobe and Sister Mary just be with all of your people in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here this morning amen if Christ be not risen from the dead then we of all men are most miserable in in fact he says if we have hope in this life only this fleshly life then we are uh of all men most miserable we are we hold something within our souls that that gave us a hope that we did not have amen uh in in our natural lives amen and so we we understand your first life is the natural life as the Apostle Paul would go on in there in uh further on down in the 46th verse he says now he says how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and then after that which is spiritual so there are two births amen and we we we understand as we have borne the image of this Earthly then we shall also bore the image bear the image of the Heavenly amen so you cannot allow the fleshly to identify the spiritual and you can't I use the spiritual Amen to uh identify the natural they will never be the same you are a spiritual being you are the seed of God the anointed one you are the very amen offspring of God living in a in a body of a natural body of Decay amen and so we we look here and and the Apostle Paul is just making it very clear amen if there's not a resurrection if there is not a doing away with the old old and putting on of the new then we are of all men most miserable if we only have hope of Christ amen just coming to church while we're here if if if all it is is church and all it is is is this life and the Christian Life here on this Earth in this natural world then we are all miserable because there's a lot of Trials there's a lot of circumstances there's a lot of things there amen each of you go through but we have an eternal hope because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and because he raised from the dead so shall every one of God's children raised from the dead can you say Amen aren't you glad for a direct word from the Lord in this hour that we're living in a direct word not no longer a amen it's not a question a direct word it's a POS positive word amen positively identified with the law of life here this morning amen positively identified not not not with my Martin genetics or your Apple Applegate genetics or Gonzales genetics or Cochran genetics but we are positively amen identified here this morning with the spirit of life in Christ Jesus the life that was in Christ raised him from the dead and the life that is in your mortal being will raise you from the dead there is no other there there is no other alternative eternal life dwells within your mortal body amen I I I'm thankful for something positive like your body and examine amen sometimes even your actions and and examine the situations you're in Amen to to to to to give you a a barometer of of of of eternal life eternal life is the genetics of God on the inside of you and your body will never agree with that can you say Amen so I'm glad for the direct word it gives an absolute Clarity brother brandham amen come to tell us that that you never began and you'll never have an ending am amen you were with God eternally in his mind before the foundation of the world Amen that that's exactly right now there's no guessing to it that's an absolute that is a positive word that is something amen you should never you should never question am I going to make it amen am I going to is is is God going to cast me aside is God going to there should be a positive think amen thoughts in your heart today that stands upon the words of God that has come through this evening time message amen well praise the Lord I I'm I'm glad brother bradam says you got to get the fear and the skar away from you amen he says you've got to identify yourself amen with the word of God you came from God you're going back to God it doesn't look amen you might not look like it in the mirror amen you might not always feel like it in your feelings but when you look upon the word of God there is a positive word concerning you that you are The Offspring of the almighty God Amen there's no guessing to it there's no wondering to it amen every question should be settled this morning amen why don't you just tell the Lord settle every question in my mind this morning settle every question I want Faith to look to you and to believe upon you I want Faith to be able to look in the mirror and say within that body is the resurrected Christ amen you were eternally in elohim's thoughts amen there's a certain quality to the elect it's an eternal quality it's something that amen no one else can experience amen you in this outward man there perishing this outward man is dying this outward Man is full of genetics amen and flaws but the inward word man is renewed day by day in the Holy Ghost amen so as a as a human amen you were never uh uh a cow before you were never a dog before you were never a pig before you've always been amen strictly a human amen you've not always acted like a human Amen in fact you've gotten spanking when you were a kid and and and you you a lot of us have have gotten spanking when we've been older amen Maybe by law Maybe by this or that amen but that didn't change the fact that you are human there's never a question in your mind whether you're a human you are strictly a human the the genetics cannot cannot crossbreed you cannot be part dog and and part monkey you are full human well praise the Lord amen now some of you might not think that sometimes of the other person but amen and neither can you be amen a part son of God you are a son of God because the genetics of God are within you amen the genetics of God has given you a new birth and there should never be a question of who you are amen never be a question that you're a son never be a question that you're a daughter never be a question that heaven is yours amen well praise the Lord I I you you you you might be hearing something else from the message amen but every time I hear the message message I hear that I'm a son every time I hear the message amen it's a certain sound every time I hear the message it is saying come out of my her my people that you receive not of her plagues you are my son amen if we could ever start acting like we're Sons acting like we're daughters acting like we we are the children of God Amen there is no question to it we are who God says we are well praise the Lord amen the scripture says if the S if the if the Trump it gives an uncertain sound amen then who can prepare himself for battle amen I I I I if it's saying one thing but yet it's not clear amen then then then you're never going to amen as the in the old days when the trumpets sounded it had to be sounded strong it had to be exactly the way amen the war trumpet was to sound so that others could prepare themselves for battle amen but today we got too many sounds we got this trumpet and this trumpet and that sound and this trumpet and the people don't know how to fight they don't know how to how to believe they don't know is because the Devils there's all kinds of Winds of doctrines and there's all kinds of things to try to amen until you're confused but God is not the author of confusion God is not the author that says amen yes I love you amen but I don't know if I love you anymore I started off and you started off amen but hey I'm taking my hands off if God ever loved you he will always love you if God ever called you that call is still the same if God's anointed you then his anointing is there to bring you to your completion can you say Amen 2 Corinthians 1:12 for all somebody say all all the promises of God in him are yay and in him amen unto the glory of God Amen now the Bible says let your yays let your yay B let your Nay be nay amen I'm talking about a positive gospel I'm talking about something that should never well glory to God I I want to tell you question marks amen should should should should be erased amen take the question mark and put a quotation mark Hallelujah a quotation mark who quotation his quotation amen for you now God commands us he He commands us to come out of Babylon now what is Babylon he says come out of her my people what what is Babylon what does Babylon represent amen it was at the Tower of Babel where the where the languages were confused amen until no one could understand the other and it was all just a bunch of mumble jumble it was all just a bunch of confusion amen and that's what that's what Babylon is today amen it's this opinion and it's that opinion and it's this opinion well praise the Lord amen but God don't want your opinion God don't want my opinion God wants his opinion and God sent a seventh angel messenger our way Amen to validate your soul by his word well someone shout hallelujah amen now amen many times we we I I want to I want to deal with this positive identification because we look amen that we we are two people amen we are you you live in a body of mortality yet within you is is the the the holy spirit of God Amen many times Satan will try to tell you that you don't you you you know you you you can't pray because of this or you can't believe because of this and amen but listen I just want to say this morning amen we've got way tooo many that put their their emphasis on the Flesh and this Mortal life Amen brother there should be zero confidence in the flesh zero confidence in the flesh well someone say zero confidence in the flesh 1 Peter 1 and 24 says All Flesh amen is is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away amen but when God sends a Vindicated voice it's not just another opinion when God sent that Prophet amen it was the revealing of the son of man or it was the it was the Enlightenment it was the thoughts of God coming to the elect in the midst of a day where there would be so many voices amen listen the voice of God come through that Prophet Amen to Squatch to to to silence all of the other voices that are out there screaming in your head that are screaming on your phone amen and that that voice is you are a son and daughter of God Amen even in his rebukes even in in the rebukes of Malachi 4 amen what is he doing he is saying get away from her come out of her quit putting your confidence in the flesh amen put your confidence in the word amen that's right how did he how does God declare it how does God separate One Voice from another he separates the voices by vindicating his own hallelujah amen you got all of us sitting here on the front row every one of you's got opinions amen but you see if one can come amen and and and and and and if you can claim that you have the voice of the Lord but when God comes upon one of y'all to validate what you're saying and declare that I am with that person then it silences everything else because the Vindication is upon that one and so what it is today in the midst of all of the voice and all of the talk there was a pillar of fire that came down to one voice and say I am with this one I am with this one now many look at the body but they don't recognize that it was God that raised that body living in that body speaking through that body to the elect to make sure that she was stabilized with the promises of God well aren't you glad you're stabilize with the promises of God Amen that's right and so God backs it up so what what was and and and before I get into my thoughts here what was the last sign to the Gentiles the last sign was the revealing of the son of man amen the revealing of the son of man was to be the last sign now there's going to be many signs there was a you know the moon turned to blood there's going to be uh uh you know the earthquakes and diverse places there's going to be tsunamis there's going to be amen all of these things but to the elect there's only one sign it's the sign of the son of man it's the same sign that came down to to Abraham before Sodom was burnt there was one sign it was the voice of the son of man that came and enabled the the the uh the the the the body or the womb of Abraham and Sarah for a body change the next thing after amen the visitation of Elohim in flesh was amen the body change and I I want to say today we're not waiting for anything else we're waiting for the body change we're not waiting for a Revival we're not waiting for amen a a a great move of speaking in tongues and seeing visions we're not waiting for a a great big move of Amen of of good emotions we are waiting for one last thing and that's the body change amen we have received our final sign and that was that positive word of Malachi for well I think we ought to get rejoicing around that that positive word of Malachi 4 we need to Rally around that voice like we've never rallied behind because the Rapture is on hallelujah what can you say Amen there's signs of tribulation there's signs of the sodomites there's signs of the world falling apart but we've already received our sign we're not look we those signs mean nothing to us we have done heard the sign of the voice of the son of manen can you say Amen there's only one sign that was given to the elect only one sign given it was the voice of Elohim that came he out what y y' y'all remember y don't y'all remember Sarah Hallelujah y'all remember Sarah Sarah thought that it was impossible Sarah says amen I there's no way I can produce Sarah's the one that was saying you've got to take Hagar there's got to be somebody else but me I can't do this but Elohim appeared not to Hagar Elohim appeared to Sarah and said you're doubting Sarah you're laughing Sarah but my promise is with you well glory to God you see on the inside of that Barren womb laid a promise on the inside of that Barren old lady laid a promise you shall have a son amen and laying within you the Bride of Jesus Christ amen is a promise that you are going to give birth to the word it's a word body it's a perfect word amen word life oh can you say Amen living within your womb Sarah was judging the Promise by what she felt by what she seen by what she well can you say Amen she was judging The Promise by her own ability and yet God was came when God came he turned her from looking at her flesh looking at her inabilities and turned her mind toward the promise of God you shall have that son amen amen so for Sarah if it was hope in that body only she was miserable but when the son of man came his desire was not to make a message believer his desire was to take the words that God had already spoke 25 years earlier and make those words real in her womb ah can you say amen hallelujah amen now she was just as much apart you see the words the words the mind of God was being expressed that day to Sarah and Abraham revealing her heart revealing God's heart it was God's mind being revealed and also he was also letting her know I know your mind as well I know you're I know where you're at you're laughing you're doubting amen but I want to tell you within you are the words of life and they shall come to pass amen if we could believe the words of God today friends don't go quit looking in the mirror quit looking at yourself and quit looking at everyone else and start looking at the words of life that God has planted within you before the foundation of the world Amen the son of man has come to reveal God's mind to you and to expose the doubt of your heart cleanse yourself you double-minded and walk with God can you say amen amen well glory to God I love second uh Corinthians 4 and amen and and seven it says but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels amen so there's a treasure and then there's the Earth and vessels treasure is not the Earth and vessels the Earth and vessel is is not the treasure and you've got to keep them both separate amen because if you're not getting them if if you don't keep them separate then then then then you'll be amen miserable we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we are persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always wearing about him the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body hallelujah what can you say Amen so God allows Sarah's womb to be to to be buried God allows these things to come God's not going to give any glory to your flesh he's not going to give any glory amen to your mind and your abilities he's going receive glory in that the treasure he has put within those old Earth and vessels is going to outshine the vessel oh the vessel's going to go amen the the the Earth and vessel is going to go through oh hell amen but the glory of God is going to rise why because it's the supernatural presence of God that's a positive word for you can you say amen amen if we in this life only have hope then we would be all men most miserable the Apostle Paul in Romans 7:24 says am man oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death this body is reigning with death so the Apostle Paul is sharing that within him there's a war going on Amen how many ever has a war going on on the inside of you there is none of us that uh are alone in the wars that go on on the inside of us we we all have these wars amen it's a battle of the two laws it's a battle of the two Natures amen there is the spirit of death working in your body and there is the law of life that is working amen through the eternal life amen what can you say amen amen what so what is what is this hope we have what is this hope there is a hope of Deliverance Deliverance from what you've been given a hope of deliverance from you you've been given a promise that you're going to be delivered from that body that you're living in you're going to be delivered from the house well glory to God there's sometimes you're living in that old to that old house and it's fallen in and you've just got to move out of it and move into another one well praise the Lord amen God is telling you you're going to move out amen of this old of This Old House I'm giving you a hope as Christ raised from the dead and he was delivered from the grave uh so shall you be delivered from those old moral bodies and you shall live forever more in that new mansion in that new body you will well glory to God Amen there is a hope of a promise there is a hope of Resurrection there is a hope within you of Deliverance amen freedom from the chains the bars of this flesh can you say amen amen hallelujah your your body is a body of death amen it's full of complexes and genetics genetics from this one and genetics from that one and just just so messed up amen sometimes we wonderand in our minds we we wonder what Hallelujah things are things are crazy amen diseases the you know what brother Brandon called it he said it's a past house amen he said that old past house you're living in amen that that past house it another word for it you know it was used back in the late 1800s and early 1900s those pest houses they were also called plague houses amen disease houses and and and and so when they when they had that uh yonic plague that that that that broke out amen they they they would take the these diseased people I mean they were dying just it was it was it was uh uh aund times worse than anything we've ever seen even with the last that that that pandemic that was anyway so but but this this thing here was people were dying amen they they were they didn't have enough Graves for all of the people amen so what they were doing they would take the all of the disease and they would put them over in this pest house Hallelujah put him in this pest house amen and and and and and they say they amen they were it was it you know people want to say they were like hospitals today amen but they said oh you can't classify them as hospitals they were put in there to die they were separated from the people amen and that they could die their miserable death alone so that so and kept him from the community trying to purge amen trying to purge the the disease the the deadly disease from the public amen they would die in those places amen separated from their family separated from from all and that's and that's what the brother brandom is saying you're living in a pest house your soul has has found its way Amen in this old diseased house but yet it's been bornn again there there's something that is saying I don't belong in this thing the old best house is for is for the diseased Soul amen full of sin but I'm not that person I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God get me out of here I I don't belong in this place oh can you say amen amen and so the Apostle Paul is telling you your Earthly amen is is full of chaos it's full of disease your spirit amen is full of complexes amen but he says but there's a promise there is a promise of eternal life you there is a resurrection for you there is a hope for you there is a promise of an eternal land you're coming out man so while the pest house was a was a symbol of death and suffering and pain amen you went in diseased and most of the time you came out in a body bag it was a forcible quarantine and when the soul of man died when the soul of man sinned and become diseased it was because of the Soul that that that that sin the soul that disbelieve now it is put in to this man quarantined into this body quarantine into that thing that you look in the mirror every morning and many times you're looking out those eyes you're looking in the mirror you're thinking do do I even know this person that I'm staring at do I Know Who I Am What am I am I what is going on I know way inside I know what I feel I know within my actions and my sometimes my my attitudes and sometimes my my I look at it don't look anything like what I feel on the inside of me the Apostle Paul says who can deliver me is there anyone who is able to deliver me from the body of this death but then he stops and he says but I thank God that my Lord oh can you say am man in fact let me just amen the brother Brandon would say brother Brandon would put it this way he would say as he's talking about the nature he he say I was speaking to my wife this morning I told her he said I said since I got saved 30 years ago as a boy she said what do you mean I said in this life some and I'm shaking myself to wake up take me into his presence did you wanted to that nightmare another place somewhere there something Beyond if conformed to IM time be it's just Dark Day a dream fixing to wake up who in a nightmare it was come out of into spring time Everlasting youth Everlasting Health Everlasting Joy Everlasting peace is it wonderful he so real the Apostle Paul in Romans 7:4 we know that the law is spiritual but I'm con sin that do not allow for I would that do I not and what I hate that I do if I that which I would not consent to the law that it is good now then it is no more how to do it but within me for I know not for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform it that which is good I I not for the good that I would not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more either do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind bringing it into some captivity to the law of sin which is my members oh riched man that I am who shall delivered me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin now brother brandham would would explain this the as someone has asked the question to explain Romans uh 7:14 to 18 we know that the law is spiritual but I'm carnal sold under sin for that which I would not and that I do and he says now she says this I cannot understand he said well they wrote out the scripture that's Paul speaking to Romans let me just kind of Polish it up so you can see in these two persons right one wants to do wrong the other one wants me to do every time I start to do right then the then the wrong hinders me how many of you people in interviews this afternoon has run the same thing and this morning the same thing I spoke on it this morning temporarily you're an outward man which is controlled by six senses and you're an inward man controlled by one sense which is Faith this Faith disagrees with all the six senses if the six senses don't agree with faith but one is contrary to the other now as long as the six senses agree with faith wonderful but when six senses disagree with faith then leave the six senses alone can you say Amen you see because that's that's that's the way that's that's God's plan you there is something Eternal on the inside of you you know if we have that kind of Grace and if we can find that kind of Grace for yourself in the mirror and understand that your your senses and your action sometimes doesn't always portray what you are on the inside you would have that same kind of Grace for somebody else you can't have that Grace for other people and have that Grace for you unless you're a hypocrite right because when you see that there is something on the inside of you that is screaming out screaming out to live that life screaming out to identify with that and then you find that the old flesh disagrees with it oh can you say amen amen that old thing just well Hallelujah you try to pray and then that old Devil's just right there to try you pull you down you you try you you you get up and you say I've I've overcome and then the next thing you know you fall flat on your face Hallelujah well glory to God amen amen the devil tell you why you lost the Holy Ghost and then you take him back to the scripture and say well you can't lose it amen you're sealed into the day of redemption then it'll tell you you never had it Hallelujah and then before you know it amen well why why why don't we quit wrestling with that because the Eternal Gene seed of God would not even want God's word it would not even crave for God's word well can you say amen amen you got to cry you got a craving for the things of God Amen the only way you'll ever receive the Holy Ghost the only way you're going to keep the Holy Ghost is by living in that world of Faith along with God living in that world of Faith saying God it's my desire to overcome it's my desire to live right it's my desire to press it's my desire to love it's my desire to show Mercy Mery it's my desire can you say Amen but yet you're Waring on the inside of you now he says for instance here Jesus made a statement of Promise the inside man says that's true the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you now I want you to understand that inside man says that's true the promise the statement a promise that Jesus made the inside man says that's true the outside man reasons that it's can't be true to you then ignore the outside man and accept the Inside Man now that's the same thing that Paul is speaking of he was sold under the law to carnal sin every one of us is the same that's the reason we have troubles married four or five times and this and that all kinds of sins adulteries and everything else in our lives is because of those things we're carnal but that must perish but then inside we are a spirit man the soul inside that's faith in God's word then when we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by Faith by accepting what God said well praise the Lord hallelujah how are you going to give power to the inside man amen by accepting by faith What God Says now you're you're only going to be able to believe that by that inside man that that inside word that was given to you well that energized by the Holy Ghost he says how can I take a ccka bird and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do the only way it can be is because inside that cockabur has been transmitted from cockabur wheat from a Cocker wheat a a cockabur to a germ called wheat life then you bury that Cocker it'll produce grain of wheat that's right that's that because there has been a life of wheat put in the cckar the life of the cockabur has been taken out the nature of the caber is still sticky it will be there until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again but when it comes forth then it'll be no more Cocker bir it'll be wheat but while it's on this Earth amen out of the earth a cucker it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it that is wheat and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky you're going to have a carnal nature and that's going to bother you as long as you live but inside of you you're born again can you say amen amen now now if it's the nature on the inside that wants to go out and and and party and do drugs and and and and and and commit adultery and lies and things like that amen then but if there is a eternal life on the inside of you that is screaming out for the will of God screaming out to overcome well can you say amen and that Old Devil sitting there telling you well what did you just think how did you just act what did you just say what what's what that Grudge that you amen that's been hanging on to your spirit amen what are these things it's time to rise up and say inside of me is eternal life inside of me amen is the genetics of the weak and when this thing is over I shall be free to express Express who I really am on the inside of me I want to be free I want to be free brother window I want to be free all it takes the Holy Spirit to take the cckar life out and put the eternal life and you say what do I have to do do I have to beg well let me just let me just give you some good news you're predestinated the seed is already on the inside of you all you've got to do is come before God and lay in the presence of God oh come on church amen on the inside go now now brother now it's impossible it's impossible to take the cockabur life out and put the wheat life in it that's impossible in the natural but it is all things are possible With God all things are POS so God took your Cocker your your wretched body and within you he's already planted before the foundation of the world his eternal seed on the inside of you that's right amen and I just want to tell you someone saying well if I could get the Holy Ghost brother wend I'm going to tell you the only way you're ever going to get the Holy Ghost is by faith that's the only way that this thing is going to ever come to life in you is by faith right and you you got to lay before God and say God I need the baptism of the whole I know the genetics are there I know the seed of God's on the inside of me because there is something on the inside of me that is screaming out can you say Amen you let the holy ghost ever come across that amen uh AC come across that that that seed and it's going to live amen but what it does is it starts a war amen that war on the inside of you hallelujah it's a war amen those that that old Satan is right there battling and battling and battling but I want to say greater is he that's on the inside of that wheat than that thing that's in that Cocker can you say Amen how can I have the Holy Ghost brother wend and struggle the way I struggle brother they they they asked brother Bram a woman asked brother brandham she said I got to know that I've got the Holy Ghost he he and he tells her he she says cuz I can't have it I want the Holy Ghost I ain't got it because my mind is just constantly it's it's in a war and in the interview he said sister I've went back and looked at your brother Earth and you were and and the sign that you were born under you're the kind of person that's constantly Crossing Bridges before you ever get to it you're the kind of person that is making things thinking they're happening when they're not you're you're you're you you you you it and and there's a war on the inside of you and he said sis the thing that has kept you is the baptism of the Holy Ghost she said but I need a sign I I want something for myself he says then you should ask God to let you speak in tongues that's what he said then ask God if you're needing a sign then we'll pray that God will let you speak in tongues to let you give you something of evidence that you can hold she had the Holy Ghost but Satan was taking her genetics taking things back to her childhood assigned that she was born under right and it was muddling up her mind right modling things up and every time she would rise up Satan would try to bring her right back down she' try to rise up Satan would bring her right back down can you say Amen now you can understand what brother random was saying about the nightmar since he's become a Christian amen but now now watch this he say as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky in the carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you're you're alive but on the inside of you born again when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ all that sin has been gone that's the thing Amen in in Hebrews chapter 4 he says you mustn't question anything to God for the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of God and every trial is put upon you to prove you the Bible says they're more precious to you than gold so if God let a few light afflictions happen to you remember it's for the correcting of you every son that comes to God must first be chasen of God and tried and child trained there's no exceptions every son that comes these afflictions are done or brought about to see what attitude you'll take it's God on this Proving Ground that's all Earth is it's The Proving Grounds where he is trying to prove you Earth here is proving what you have have on the inside of you many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers them from them all the Son of God has been given eternal life and the struggles are there can you say amen amen but remember things that are to be and I've read this to you hundreds of times over the years the real gift is your sew down in there see that was born of God that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God Amen and there you grow up a son you're then you're a son and daughter of God you're a child of God can you say Amen now when brother Brandon was talking about that that taking that that that verse as he's explaining amen that you know uh uh I thank God through my Lord through uh Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I serve the law of God and with the flesh the law of sin and and and brother bradam would would talk now what is he what is he talking about with a mind he says that mind man is is is is not talking about your fleshly mind amen he's not talking about your he bet but he's talking about that that new uh mind that was created in Christ amen he says now he says uh he says I thank God through our Lord Jesus Christ so that with a mind I myself serve the law of God he now he says now I uh uh he says uh all right exactly what Paul said many times over when I would do good evil is present see that's exactly what you do too with your mind that's your heart now remember you do not think with your mind you you think you you you see neither do you see with your eyes neither do you you see with your heart did you know that did you know your heart has another person in it besides yourself science just found that out about four years ago you know little compartment in the heart that the soul lives did you ever hear the subconscious you start to do anything and you think I'm just uh I'm just winding o over the top of it but your subconscious tells you different they take a light detector and and my my my good friend uh attorney Robinson sitting in the back he I I don't know whether he's ever done it or not uh but I happen to have put it on me one time about this Angel of the Lord here they put a light detector on you to confess the best of your knowledge the best thing that make it up just you know so nice and smoothed over that you you you uh didn't do such a thing like a criminal that that's a lie detector will turn right back and say you're lying see why it's the vibration of your nerves and they pick up uh on that lie detector and it'll tell you because why man was not made to lie in his original beginning and sin it's sin and the devil that's on you that makes you lie wasn't your makeup uh is is not to lie that that's the reason you have to live again because you was made created to live forever live always but you see sin come in and brought death to the body and then when this sin comes in and brings death to the body then of course the body has to die but in there can dwell eternal life when this Spirit has changed in you and you've got eternal life God will raise that body up in the last days so with your mind he says in another place I think or I have the mind of Christ now in the mind you serve Christ you serve God in the inward part you serve God the subconscious there's where faith lies and I want to ask you was there many times that you people in here many of you have seen times where you just know something was going to happen it look like it was impossible but you just know it was going to happen uh did did you ever have that he said that's that Faith it's the subconscious working and if and if it's getting now in the subconscious he says except a man be Born Again verely verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God you cannot see the kingdom because the kingdom of God is the holy spirit amen so brother bradam is is telling us I wanted to read just a portion of that because brother bradam is is is trying to to to let us know amen that it's not the natural mind but it is the spiritual mind what can you say man now the natural mind Romans 8 and seven because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be colians 1: 21 and you that were sometimes alienated enemies in your mind well Lord but Wicked works but he's reconciled you amen we see what what did what Galatians 524 they that are Christ have crucified the Flesh and the affections amen now I'm I'm just going to reach to you really quick keys can keep up with me that'll be but but write this down here the renewed mind in Romans 7:25 but thank God for Jesus Christ so then with the mind I serve the law of God Romans 12:2 be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is acceptable purp for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayith the Lord I will put my laws in their mind and write them in their heart Ephesians 4:23 be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man Philippians 2 let this mind that was in you be in you which is also in Christ Jesus Romans 8:26 likewise the spirit stop our infirmities we know not how we should pray for as we ought for the spirit make inter for us with groing and he that search the heart knows what is the mind of spirit because he makes intercession for the Saints amen the Romans 864 carnally minded is but spiritually minded is life and peace now now I want I want to bring these in is because you have within you to do a war going on there's a war going on in Israel there's a war going on Ukraine Russia there's Wars going on but within you is a war that's on since your new birth there been a new war brother says the the new birth he says there's when the battles really start to take place it's then after you have received the Holy Ghost and the battles really began but the Apostle Paul Romans 7:22 I Delight in the law of God after the inward man Colossians 4ans 4:6 which not though our man perish yet the inward man is renewed new can you say Amen now I want you to think L yourselves for just a moment I give another 15 there I really think of this because I think that this is freeing free you to yourself man the law of life I don't know if I ever heard of John G Lake he was he was one of the ministers there am man in the uh uh plague pic thousands and thousands had died and and he was a preacher that he was burying he was burying people for sometimes he he was putting one grave four five people at a time in it just but all the whole time he was there he says that he never he never took the plague the government came asking him and the medical and the medical field asking him man what what are you doing what what are you taking would like to use this man and and his response the law of life is greater than the law of death and he this I want to give you just a a little he says now watch the action of the law of life Faith belongs to the law of life it's the very opposite of fear Faith the opposite effect in spirit soul and body the spirit of man to become confident causes the mind of man to become restful and positive he says because in cont the spirit life I little fell with me went out marri many of who di from the plague we went into homes carried them out of the graves put them in sometimes with three or four grave we never took the disease why because the knowledge that the law of Life Christ Jesus protects us that law is working because of the fact that a man by the action of his will puts purposefully in contact with God faith takes possession of his heart and condition of his nature change instead of being Fe Faith instead being absorbent drawing everything to itself is spiritual sickness and disease the spirit of Christ Jesus from every the body plague I mentioned government ship supplies and core of doctors and one of the doctors sent for me and what they had been ask uh what we' been using protect ourselves and uh and they said but but we concluded that a man could stay on the ground as you have and ministering to the sicking the dead you must have a secret what is it Jesus I believe that just as long as I keep my soul in contact with the Living God so that his spirit is flowing into my soul and body that no germ will ever attach itself to me for the spirit of God will kill it he asked I replied no but doctor I think you would like to experiment with me and so what he told him he said e e e is now because that that plague was so bad that they would foam out the mouth and puss and and and uh take your take your instruments and put that upon the on your on your little scope your what is that little thing there microscope he says and you'll what the Bible says that I am the spirit of life is greater than the law of death oh Hallelujah have you ever thought about that the spirit of life in you is great than the law of death that surrounds you it allows you to believe can you say Amen it it it it it it causes you brother brandham would say he he he would say this he said he says for instance he says when when a man gets saved he said the light that comes into him is about like this white button on my shirt then on the inside he has only one gate one entrance to go in the shik of Glory where God can enter into him and take over his his his control tower and that way is through your self-will whether you will or not that's up to you but that's the only Avenue that opens up to the man that God can come into his heart is by your self-will it puts him right back like Adam and Eve on free moral agency you can choose right or wrong either one to do he goes on and says and he says now he can let that Spirit grow and take at all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again he can become in the same condition that he was when he was in the Garden of Eden Jesus said Mark 11:24 verily verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you will have what you said that puts him back Supreme again it puts him back in the condition he said the Messiah the anointed one a King to deliver your Kings and Priests someone shout hallelujah Kings to bring in priests to minister to a messiah his signs was to follow in all ages reflecting his light his presence with his kingdom people you don't have to die to get this you have to spiritually die but you don't have to physically die inside is where God gets into control you and as he presses his way forward hisself forward in you don't let any bitter uh roots of bitterness hatred malice and strife that'll run him right back again just get all the meanness and the superstitions and the unbelief out of you every time you move out of a little bit of unbelief God steps in right in and takes over move out unbelief he told Joshua whether the S of your feet uh uh your your foot is set that I give to you tonight as we enter into God's kingdom taking all the Philistine unbelievers all the amorites all the malachit and whatsoever more throw it out of us like that we take possession like that and they say well the days of Miracles has passed you Amorite get out of me well someone shout hallelujah hallelujah you Amorite right get out of me I put footprint there I took over there's no such thing as seeing visions get out of here you am malachite I'm coming over there you are you're pressing out from that little button is taking over the fibers of you spreading out God working through you in you and around you Hallelujah so this becomes the coat this body is simply the house and God says on the inside of that body I've not lost my purpose in fact it's fulfilling my purpose I could have out Adam to just be Kings and and Priests and rule that would be fine but I couldn't myself there was nothing there was nothing lost there was nothing B there was nothing but now I'm working myself out of a p house power of eternal life lives on the inside of my sons and daughters that lives on the inside of mamas it lives on the inside of boys and girl it lives on the inside that eternal life within you pressing press someone say pressing yes there is a war there is a press yes there is battle but you are winning get out of me am man that devil that is to Healing not get out of me that's trying to tell well this because is get out of me I am passing my way I am passing eternal life must come forth can you say Amen yes now brother BR would say he's got the light eternal life is the light of God he said not here not long ago they took an x-ray of a man praying for a man re digest rooted up found out ray of light coming from one of the men not not all of them but the men's hands reflected a r of light put a piece of full hands get you yourself in England they turned healers called to all the hospitals there was 80% more heal done than medical cures had performed read just picked here newed up tried it and and a r of light and man sincerely not knowing they were doing it but put his hands on man and pray Earnest prayer and they they down out they found out a light coming from his hand God knew what he talked about lay hands on the sick and they shall cover he knows he was speaking of I Church to press into that place where it can come like God want to see when was made flesh with the Messiah then if we can oursel to the anointed light that he was we become little lights that's what the church is supposed to be lights little ones anointed ones that's God's Church light is the light of the Messiah Christ in people the anointed car forth his life to all the church ages sometimes almost if Spirit it becomes us is him in his kingdom in oh can I hear a great hallelujah hallelujah yes s wants to try to say he ain't got but let know this this body don't Define who I am I got a positive identification and the voice of seventh angel has come to positively Place me where I belong it's not under the foot of the it's not under my circumstances this is simply the Proving Grounds for me rise up and let the devil know you yeah you took you took the in God's Eden but allowed them it was some God blind allowed their eyes to be blinded because he wanted to show you come and fight me in this day where I have absolutely no hope the Messiah were e e e son of man his words tell me produce my like Sarah is a spiritual I want one fashioned after [Music] God I want one that's made that dis that whenever he summons me I'm ready by the grace of God we have one already waiting that we move in that can't die from it no more how would you want to live in this not me we're we're going out of it and I'm glad of it this old human germ trap that we're living in death e trap what more it groans and pains in it its old age and why my who would want to stay in this body like that I'm glad there is one coming we got a body that's been prepared for us in glory and as soon as this life leaves this old hole here that eternal spirit of God that lives within it takes its journey into that Tabernacle Yonder and there it lives eternally why would we want something like this my yes sir oh I'm so glad that there is a God who has made all things plain can you say Amen the old Tabernacle here you you know what it is this body is like an old coat that you wear says you're on the inside of it the garments only done what it bore your image and that's the way this old body is you're it's bore the image of the Heavenly yes it's not you you're on the inside of that body you the spirit of God is on the inside of that body that's what makes the outside come into subjections because the inside is pulling it see the bringing it in line with the word your inside you yourself your your being your body is just an Overcoat your real body your real self is on
