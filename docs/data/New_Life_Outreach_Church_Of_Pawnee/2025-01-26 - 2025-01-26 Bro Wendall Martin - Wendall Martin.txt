very talented family and so we're sure uh glad to have them here this evening just good to be back in the house of the Lord here t tonight and um while you've while you're standing why don't we just look here in the book of Hebrews the 12th chapter and um we are going to continue along the lines that we ministered here this morning um amen we ministered on created to minister to the Lord and um amen and there is nothing that the devil can do to amen sideline that we were created for a purpose and God is he sees us through that Eternal purpose can you say Amen but tonight I want to minister on Amen along the same lines but I'm want to minister zeroed in on my purpose and so amen we you know if you can't use condemnation and if you can't get you sidetracked that way then he'll get you distracted in so many other ways in your in your purpose but I how many wants to Amen to to please the Lord in all that he has called you to do amen we want to please the Lord Jesus and uh so let's look here in in Hebrews the 12th chapter the first verse it says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us now if you there's there's there's got to be a goal and there's going to be many distractions many things to keep you from that goal the second verse looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of god let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for the presence that we feel here tonight and we come Lord that we lord can give you honor Lord to give you praise but we also come Lord to this service because we need something from you and Lord we're asking that you would Minister to to our needs Lord from the preacher to to whoever may feel that they would be the least in in the congregation tonight I pray Lord that the Holy Spirit would would just come through these aisles and Lord go from corner to corner Lord front to back minister to your people Lord we want to be washed with your word this evening we thank you for your blessings Lord Lord you see our our these these young men father that been hit hard with this Lord these uh the temperatures and the infections I just pray that you'd be with them Lord in their homes tonight ask that you would be with all of those who can't be here this evening Lord you know what they need and where they are and we'll just give you glory and honor now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated we um we love the Lord Jesus here tonight amen and so we as we uh go along these lines created to minister H amen we want to be zeroed in on our purpose amen the Apostle Paul was just talking about the the race and running that race and how the how important it is that we stay focused upon on the goal because there's going to be many things in in in this last leg of the journey to get you sidetracked Amen to uh hide your purpose from you but you've got to remember as I as I mentioned this morning we have been predestinated we have been placed here in this generation for a purpose and it's very important that we win the trophy it's important that we run this race amen but not just run the race but that we win the race amen now this is not a marathon amen this is a race with winners and losers there this is a this is a race that amen the scripture says not all that starts out is going to is going to finish the race amen this is a this is a race that is going to be a a a hard ran race it's going to be a fight amen the scripture says there in in 1 Corinthians 9:24 it says know ye not that they which run a race run all but one receives the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the masteries is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore Soul Run somebody say I so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body amen and bring it in subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Cast Away amen I I I look there at at at Revelations 3 and 19 to our generation to this church age he says as many as I love I rebuke and I chasen therefore be zelous therefore and repent can you say amen amen so so brother bradam would would take this the scripture and he would say be zealous and repent now this false church has Zeal no make no mistake about it her Zeal is literally been uh uh that of the Jews John 2:7 the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up but it is a wrong Zeal it is for the house of their own building it is for their own Creeds dogmas organizations their own righteousness they have put the word out uh for their own ideas and they have deposed the Holy Ghost and made men into leaders they have put aside uh uh eternal life as a person and make it good works or even the church conform uh Conformity rather than good works but God is calling for another Zeal someone say hallelujah it is the Zeal to cry I'm wrong now who is going to say that he is wrong can you say Amen so brother Brandon would tell us now there he is crying out remember amen there's a two-fold purpose for the messenger to our age that Messenger to our age is to Amen to condemn Egypt to condemn those uh uh uh Janis jambers is as it will but it is also to take you out of that land of bondage amen take you through the Wilderness and to bring you into a land amen of your own of God's choosing for you well glory to God Amen aren't you glad that God didn't just tell you amen I'm going to shed my blood and and and so that you can sing songs while you're in the jail cell of sin while you're in the while while you're in the muck and the M while you are all but God's Divine Grace has provided blood for you and I Amen to separate us from Egypt and say you are not part of them I'm taking you into a Promised Land it'll be your promise it'll be your call you can build houses there and the task Masters I'm going to kill every one of them well that should make you want to shout can you say Amen now amen now we we understand excuse me we understand that not everyone that came out of Egypt through the blood of the Lamb made it into the Promise Land amen there we found out that when they came out of Egypt amen the scripture says that uh uh that there was a 40-year Wilderness experience and amen that 40-year Wilderness experience it brought out a lot of things in their lives amen there was coming out of Egypt was one thing but God was wanting to get Egypt out of the people amen and there's where sanctification comes in amen many of times we're sitting on the pews and and we're thanking God for what he has amen for what he's done and amen and this is where Le osia is as a whole amen we got so many claiming to be Christians and claiming to be Sons and Daughters of God we've got mega churches everywhere it seemed like here in Oklahoma we've got amen I I I believe in Tulsa alone there's five mega churches Pentecostal mega churches that amen they you know they run anywhere from 15 to 25,000 people amen so so these guys are claiming to be Christians amen but remember God's not wanting to just shed his blood so that you can come to church he's not wanting to just shed his blood just so that you can uh a sing and a choir or amen just so that you can but he has brought you the reality of who you are amen now remember amen Satan wants to say that you're not you're not anything Satan wants you to look at yourself Satan wants you to look amen and say this is the only thing that you'll ever become amen you know you're just got to be satisfied with just the status quo but let me remind you Samson that you don't belong Amen in the in the chains of the Philistines you don't belong there amen grinding at the meal the Son and Daughter of God has been created with a purpose and that is to destroy the works of the devil Satan wants to keep you bound he wants to keep you defeated he wants to keep you under his his control so that you don't control him so that you well praise the Lord somebody amen you've got a purpose and that is that God's grace could flow in and through you Hallelujah now but the children of Israel had a hard time with it they couldn't recognize now here they were coming out of Egypt and they couldn't realize that the land that they were going to was going to be a land that was their very own land that there would never be a amen anything that can kick them out of their land because God had predestinated them for that inheritance well praise the Lord but instead amen through their trials and their weaknesses amen what were they W to do they were wanting to go back into Egypt they were saying oh we're we're going to die out here oh amen we wish to God that we would estate wish to God we would have the garlics and and the leaks and and the things there but you see there was some people that had the desire to go all the way somebody say all the way you know there's a song we used to sing amen back in Pentecost all the way I'm going all the way don't even try to turn me around amen all the way well can you say Amen you say but brother when I I just don't know if I can make it you're predestinated to go all the way now what I said this morning and what I I I brought out amen that that that bride that that girl that amen looked like she was so uh uh you know all the other girls were picked and amen the the they were all married off but this girl just seemed to be so despondent amen she she seen no value in herself her her her her her family saw no value in her but when the prince came and the prince identified something with her it changed who she was right can you say amen amen you see we can come out of Egypt but getting Egypt out of us is what God is looking for amen what can you say amen God sends the trials God sends the circumstances God sends the situations your way it ain't the devil that's bringing it your way it is God who created the devil it is God who has allowed those things to come your way to challenge your faith now hitting the Mark is so important you'll never overcome with a slaves mentality you'll never Hallelujah and God don't want us God don't want us painting the shackles he didn't come to uh G give you a nice amen uh uh um you know a beautiful paint job on your o on your on your jail sale God come to tell you who you are you are my bride I've created you with a purpose I've ordained you with a call amen don't let Satan come in and make you satisfied in this Wilderness or in Egypt I've got a land amen that I have predestinated for you can you say amen amen this is going to require keeping the goal in your mind somebody say help me Lord to keep the goal in my mind Amen brother Kobe sings a song Lord help me when I aim I believe he's ones that sings that amen let my bow be Rock Steady can you say Amen hitting the mark amen when we talk about hitting the mark and I amen uh uh those who who might not have been able to hear this morning maybe you can go back after the service and and listen to this morning's message but hitting the intended mark on the target is called the Bull's Eye and just because you've got a gun in your hand and just because you've amen you're pulling a trigger amen doesn't necessarily mean you're hitting the mark Hallelujah well glory to God I said just because you're in church tonight and just because you're singing songs of Zion doesn't mean you're hitting the mark God wants you to hit the bullseye amen whether it's in archery or rifle the target is set up amen it is it is placed out there amen we're not interested in just hitting the paper but we want to hit that Bullseye Amen in in in in the Air Force the pilots they are trained amen not to just drop bombs well Glory amen they're they're trained not to just we've seen that in Israel lately how that Israel can precisely just go in and just take out prec with Precision why they were trained to defeat the enemy they were trained to use their weapon well glory to God they've known how to zero win on the target can you say amen amen now they know how to make it count they know that they have been amen enlisted in the Army for a purpose and they want to fulfill that purpose I have been created by God for a purpose and I want to defeat the Devil for that is the purpose that God has brought me into this world Amen well praise the Lord amen my brother-in-law he's a he's a world he's he's he's he's been world champion multiple times amen Matt McLaren and uh uh he he he can you know he's he's my guns slinging uh brother-in-law Hallelujah and and but but Matt he man he he can he can take he can take his his uh handgun there and and he can shoot you know Six Bullets however much that magazine holds he can sit shoot that thing drop the other one out have another one in and do all of it within May under five seconds he can have that all done amen and hit the bullseye just like there's a lot of that where he's hitting inside bullet holes every time and it's and it's because this man has has he he's wants to win he wants to be the best he want well praise the Lord amen and so we his his guns amen they sell they they sell 10 $20,000 right now you know and they amen but but you see cuz they know he's a winner and they know that he what he makes it's it's not junk and and and and I just want to tell you this tonight that God doesn't make junk churches Make Junk preachers can be junk and and and Saints can be junk just halfway Christians but God does not make junk in other words we can be halfway Christians but God has created every every one of us to be Overcomers in this world that we're living in now so as we go on through amen I believe there are strategies in hitting the mark amen I I I've I thought about the and I hope this is okay here tonight but I I thought my my brother-in-law he had built me a rifle uh some years ago and and uh and so uh he he told me now every day that you uh before we were going to go hunting there in Colorado he said I want you to take this big old thing and every day don't put no bullets in it but every day pull that thing up look through it and and then and then pull the trigger amen clock it and pull the trigger just every day pull that thing up he said you got to get used to got to get used to not shaking and you never know when you're going to be able to to hit and you're and he was telling me all of this and then he would say Amen clean your gun Hallelujah he always accused me of not keeping my gun clean so he would say clean your gun so he called me up and he says now we're fixing to go have you cleaned your gun I said oh man I've cleaned it up amen and and uh so we get out there you know and and everyone else they're out there shooting their their rifles and and getting everything ready someone asked me are you going to shoot your rifle I said man Matt McLaren built my gun a man and I tried it before I left Oklahoma and I'm going to tell you right now I'm going to kill me an elk praise the Lord but I didn't take in consideration that there was the out itude I didn't take into consideration that there was a lot of these other things so they're out there tuning their gun in amen and and and and who was the first one to see that big old stag amen and and here was it was me and Jason Green amen we get up on this thing was about a 600 yard shot and and I I get down on the ground and I'm I'm aiming and I shoot and I miss my elk amen I totally miss it you see I I I thought I had it together I thought that I I had the best weapon around it was made by the best gunsmith around but you see the checklist I did not make sure that I was sure that I was well praise the Lord Satan is like a roaring lion and youve got to be prepared to destroy that enemy can you say amen amen if it's too hot it it'll affect the accuracy amen you've got to shreet your surroundings your amen your gun will act differently in the mountains as I found out amen we find that these kinds of things and I want to say the scripture says not to just lay aside the sins but he says lay aside the weights and the sin which does so easily beset you how many things have we allowed in our lives amen that we allow in our in our in our everyday walk maybe maybe it's in the music or maybe it's in the friends or or maybe amen it's the way uh just just our average life without prayer without dedication amen and when the time comes that we need the glory of the Lord in our church in our family and our homes and and these kinds of things here we find ourselves not in that position where we we need to be well can you say Amen but I want to say tonight if God has called you to be serpent bruisers then we need to act like serpent bruisers we need to be prepared to defeat the Devil and that's in every situation amen of Our Lives we must remain ready now Song of Solomon 2 and5 it says it says take or catch us the foxes it's the little foxes that spoil the vine for our Vines have tender grapes amen so what is he saying it's the little things that we justify in our lives that are that are the things that sap us of our strength I've got a a dump truck that can't seem to stay charged and um amen I go and put the put a new battery in it and then something is sapping the the juice out of that thing and going around and around well I found out that it was the break amen the break does not totally decompressed so when I push it down and I let back out there was a little portion of that and it that that that stays on and it keeps the lights on in the back Hallelujah and every time that I jump into that wonderful thing amen it's always dead and I I I have changed the battery I've and I have I have charged that thing I for the last last time I don't want to charge that sorry truck again amen but you see I I could cuss it amen preacher cussing amen you sorry thing you and and you can you can kick the tires you can say all of those things but until I am ready to get into the nitty-gritty find out what is sapping the life out of that battery that that truck is not going to run right that truck is not going well can you say Amen that truck is ordained it was built to carry load it was built to haul Rock and dirt it was built for the construction site but that truck does me no good as long as that battery keeps dying every time I get out of it can you say Amen so what do I have to do I have to go in and find out amen what is killing my lifeline what what what is causing that to drain out and I want to tell you there's a lot in Leota to take away the strength and the power of life out of the Christian it's not God's fault God's designed you God's built you God's anointed you to defeat the enemy amen but there are things in our lives that Satan wants to bring in and to ground his power within you well someone shout hallelujah amen now those little things brother Brandon would say amen he would say it's the word of the Living God it's so essential amen until all the heavens and earth will pass away and yet but it shall never pass away God knows his every word that little word that we read God knows all every little thought that goes through our mind every little act that we do I'm kindly thinking of this many times the church in its looseness gets to doing things and and and and thinking things and taking things as they are when we ought to weigh what we do and say and we ought to think it over before we speak it my old southern Mama used to tell me think twice and speak once it's the little things sometimes that we leave undone that means so much to us we get in such a hurry to race over things in this neurotic age that we're living in and it would behoove us as the Church of God tonight to stop and wait a minute and see where we're at can you say amen amen the Apostle Paul would say in Philippians 3 and7 what things were gained to me those things I count loss for Christ what things were gained to me those things I count loss amen what was he doing he was sharing uh he was sharing his strategy because the enemy was is going to fight them now you might be a new Christian sitting here tonight maybe you're an old Christian that is sitting here tonight but the strategies that the word of God has given us amen is there for us to live not just an average Christian life but an overcoming Christian Life how many want your marriage to be successful how many want your children to be successful how many wants your walk with God to be successful we want success and the way we get success is by God's grace within us through his word now as I as I think along these lines and amen as I have laid this this out before you tonight amen I I think of this scripture there in Philippians 3 and12 not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that word apprehend means arrest if I may arrest or take for myself that for which I am apprehended or arrested of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have already already apprehended but this one thing I do someone shout hallelujah forgetting those things which are behind me and reaching forth under those things which are before I press I press that means you can't ever get you Hallelujah Christianity is not going to be amen just coasting Christianity is not a vacation in the Bahamas amen Christianity is going to be a press enemy is going to fight you hard amen he's Hallelujah if if you don't run out of gas he'll get the the dog to bite the mailman and he'll get this and he'll get that anything to keep you or distract you from your purpose but as I am am I as I am trying to build to you here today we got to keep the goal in front of us the goal is a bride without spot the goal is a Rapture the goal is leaving this whole world behind and pre we're preparing for that can you say Amen it says I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ I like the Young's literal translation of that it says not that I had did already obtain or have already been perfected but I pursue if also I may lay hold on that for which also I uh I was laid a hold of by Christ Jesus Brethren I do not reckon myself to have laid hold and one thing the things which behind indeed forgetting and to the things which before uh stretching forth to the Mark I pursue or chase for the pr of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus as I begin to think as Israel was sitting there before the promise after God had brought them out of the promised land and God had shown himself real and God was wanting to make himself known very personal to them because they were fixing they were fixing to enter into that promised land and God was going to show them that every place their feet touched was theirs God was fixing to show them that no matter what the obstacle was no matter what the situation was God was going to bring them through but they were sitting there at cadis Baria which represent amen the line between doubt and Faith it was there at this place it was the Judgment Center amen of that of that of that area that's where it was the great metropolitan area and they were going to have to make their decision there was the day the time of judgment they were either going to judge God Faithful his word faithful or they were going to stay in the wilderness they were going to they had to bring up all of everything yes in the wilderness they had seen a lot of they had seen a lot of stuff they had seen the chorus and the daans they had seen the serpents biting and killing they had seen a lot of things that's going through but God had been faithful and the pillar of fire had led them and they are fixing to cross over into their promised land where they could build their house they were no longer going to be slaves they were no longer going to have to answer to anybody else it was going to be theirs but the only way this was going to happen is for them to believe the words of the Lord are you hearing me now I I I I'm talking to you because the reason why the devil or God allows the devil to bring things our way is to test your faith well how many believes you've been tested a lot lately amen there's a we we've been tested here and there we just just been every which direction brother John is still struggling so hard with his head we've got so many that are that are just struggling they're struggling and you can either look at these things and say well God hasn't God's not hearing our prayer or you can look at these things and saying God has allowed these things to test us and to see where we are to see where are we going to believe him are we we are here at the Cades Barne Maybe in your situation glory to God that land is yours healing is yours victory is yours but God is looking for men and women that'll stand to his word and believe what he says can you say Amen now we found that when the preachers come back and there was 10 of them that came back said man we can't do it there are giants in that land there's all kinds of devils over there I don't want to go we we're going to get slaughtered Hallelujah but Jake but there was a Caleb and a Joshua who came back and said yeah there's Giants but look at all of the promises here's the grapes where where I mean where where that takes two of us to bring the grapes back over the milk and honey that God said was in that land is there they went back and started confirming what God had already said God had already promised them oh can you say amen amen they came back Hallelujah he said we're more than able we're more than able here when God was when God was talking about Caleb I I like this right here in numbers 14 and 23 it says but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will I bring into the land whether he went and his seed shall possess it desire I know I I know that LE oia is all around us there's there we we we we are there's there's so many things to distract but if this Rapture is upon us and how many believes the Rapture is upon us if the coming of the Lord is so soon there should be something within every one of our hearts here tonight and I'm not just talking about you but I'm I've got my hand up as a as the minister there should be something in our hearts saying God I want to go all the way I don't want to be left in the wilderness with these folks here that don't want to go all the way Le osia don't want it they kicked you out of the church they've kicked your word out of the church they're they they they don't care about it but I must fulfill the reason I must fulfill my purpose I must make the go I don't care about all the everything else I've got one purpose in mind and that is reaching my destiny a young man talked to a a successful businessman and and and he was sort of making light of him and he says well you know he's this guy was a multi-millionaire and the young kid was jealous that he didn't have his money and he said hey I mean you know you're rich and and uh and so the the the millionaire says you want to be successful he said yes he said all right meet me 7 11:00 in the morning he man down down at the down at the river at the river yeah so he gets him down there at the river 7 o'clock in the morning first of all he he was trying to negotiate get it up there at 8 or 9ine but he said No 7 o'clock so he gets him down there and the old the the the rich man say he goes into the water about Knee Deep and says come on in here son and he goes what does this have to do with being successful he said come on in son amen and he gets him on out there to the waist deep and finally on out to the shoulder say come on in man then the then the then the millionaire grabs a hold of that boy and just dunks his head under the water and holds it under and that boy is struggling struggling struggling and finally he lets him up and the guy's just gasping for air amen he said what' you do that for the rich man says I I got a question for you what were you thinking when you had your head under that water he says all I could think of is I was going to drown unless I took a breath all I wanted to do was have a breath he says when you get that diligent about being successful then you're going to be successful you will do what it takes to be an overcomer when that is your only well glory to God when you want more of God more than you want anything else all of these other things will just all fade away and I want to tell you every Prophet that I've seen in the scripture and every every wise man that has ever come forth or or those men who were willing to lose it all in order to gain the prize the Apostle Paul says I count an all but dung that I may win Christ come on Church don't you give me amen just a church pew don't you make me just a Christian I want to be a Son of God fulfilling my purpose that I was ordained and birthed for can you say amen amen coming to your full potential brother Bram would say in perseverance 1963 he says if thou canst believe now to achieve anything you've got to set a goal and say this I believe and tie yourself to it and keep drawing and moving up closer to it knowing it's there knowing that there is something there that you're coming to oh Hallelujah set to go Lord I'm wanting to closer walk with you God I'm wanting to can you say Amen am do you remember the woman of of shunum and I hope this is okay here for tonight amen but the woman of shunan remember the woman that gave that was given the promise of a son and in her old age and and she and her husband had had this son and and and and and the Bible says that amen uh her husband brought the boy in about noon and the baby died and and and and and and here now this was a good woman now remember she asked her husband for permission to uh H uh to build a room onto the house for for the the prophet of God and so the prophet when he would come in through the area be weary and tired and here he would come in and amen and sleep and she would take care of him and and and and it was a wonderful thing and the prophet of God ask what can we give her amen and and and and and the servant says well she's a wealthy lady there's nothing you could really give her he says but I do know that she does never had a child and and God told him amen tell her that she's going to have a child and so when the child grew up to about 12 years old the baby died amen when the baby died here here She didn't grow in in discouragement it was a test she didn't accuse God wrongfully it was a test it wasn't she wasn't selfish in her way of thinking she she had a promise from God and she knew that God could not lie and when the test was on in her life and when she had to make the decision to either trust God believe God keep her thoughts upon god well can you say Amen what did she do amen she told her servant I want you to go and settle up a mule amen and I want you to take me to the man of God Hallelujah God gave the promise and I'm going to find the man of God because Hallelujah I've got a dead promise and so uh the the the Bible says she told him don't you salute anybody don't you say hello to anybody you get me to the man of God and the scripture says when she got up close to the man of God Amen the man of God was on the mountain and he seen her coming and he sent Gaza down there and told him he told the servant to see if everything was well well she didn't want to talked to the servant amen she came all the way on up to the prophet and and and he said is all well is all well with you yes is all well with uh uh uh your your husband yes is all well with your son yes then she says uh uh prophet of God you made a promise you gave me a promise I want you to go with with me cuz my baby is dead now she said all is well Hallelujah I said hallelujah oh I'm in the trial but it's still all is well I'm in my circumstance but it's still all is well you know why because my soul is at rest with God's word I have laid everything that I have I've gone through that I am not wrestling I'm not struggl Ling I'm not trying to turn pages and say well I don't believe that well I go no let's go to some I have taken God's word I believe what God says all is well God says he's a Healer all is well God says he's a savior all is well God says that I'm predestinated to make a Rapture all is well can you say amen I don't care what the doctor says I don't care amen what your situation is looking like if I can get you at one thing here tonight and that is to never limit God but to always take God at his word and to always stand strong on thus sayeth the Lord keep that go before you glory to God nothing can turn the purpose of God if God's ever had a thought he can't ever have a new thought if Kobe if God ever had a thought toward you and it was a good thought he can't have a bad thought because God's thoughts are Eternal Oh Glory to God oh glory to God now we live in this space here amen sister April we're here in this fin night we're in time and space and and it seems like it's been a million years since brother John has had those headaches it's it's been a it's been a long time for some of those situations maybe amen you you you you know different ones or may maybe in but you see God stands on the outside of time God is not limited by time God is Not amen he's not controlled by time God is in eternity he's always been in eternity God thought of you and his Hallelujah the scripture says the works were done before the foundation of the world so God seen it God knew it God decreed it God the scripture even says about your salvation amen Those whom he forew he also predestinated to be uh conformed to the image of his son and whom he did Forno he predestinated and then he predestinated them he also Justified whom he has Justified he is also already glorified it's all part of the same thought I let me just put it this way here there is no way that you can mess it up you might be miserable but if your name is on the book and the book is the Land There is well praise the Lord hallelujah I used to tell Caleb amen you're coming in amen he had he had he had backslid from the Lord you know amen and and um uh I would get I'd get I'd get phone calls from people all all across the land you wouldn't believe what Caleb's got on Facebook and you wouldn't believe what this and that and the other and uh uh uh this and I I would always amen and back back then brother Torrance was my he was my buddy Amen brother Torrance would be back there saying brother Wendell he can't mess it up and you remember that brother TS he would say you he can't mess it up I said he's messing it up I hallelujah amen and he and he would just keep on God's given you that promise God's giv you that come on Amen and I want to tell you there's nothing you can do sitting in this church that can make if you couldn't mess it up when you were in sin then you can't mess it up here but God sends you through your Wilderness experience because he's wanting to bring the true nature of who you are out in you those unbelievers amen that were wearing the cloak of a Believer amen when the time came they were just full of unbelief but there were Believers in that congregation that says I must I will come on church I don't care amen if it's in the Lion's Den or if it's in the fiery furnace or where it's been God's seed has went through the testing they've went through the rigid training they've gone through the trial and God has brought them out they didn't always look like a Christian they didn't always act like a Christian but they believe that God would bring them out and they [Applause] did Hallelujah well praise the Lord now here I I I I've thought you man every one of us have been in our in those situations where it just feels like usually about the time that the trial comes am me the situation whether whatever it is in your life also Satan brings that despair in your life and he and he's just trying to trying to soak it all out how many how many knows what I'm talking about where where the where the he just tries to to to suck it out of you amen there sometimes you don't have any feelings you don't have any you don't have any you don't feel like praying you don't feel like reading you don't feel like doing any of those things there but there is where I'm trying to say trust in his word he's going to bring you out and the woman of sha shuna she come and she grabbed a hold of the prophet and said I'm not going to let you go until you come and raise my baby Oh Glory to God now he says well I'm going to send Gaza and Gaza you go take my rod and and the woman says I didn't come for gahaz and I didn't come for your Rod you gave the promise you're going with me that's right and God brought that you see you've got to keep the gold before you are you hearing me I tell I tell these boys are these kids that's learning that's learning to play and um I guess I guess the majority of of everyone sitting here on in in the in the in these front two pews here are guitar players and and um or or at least three quers of them guitar players and different ones want to take off learning the piano do this that and the other I said you know if you get too scattered if you get too scattered out you you you're never going to be a master of anything get what you like amen and I don't know if you guys have ever heard uh uh Ashley play but that girl can play a fiddle amen well she didn't she didn't get that good just by going around trying to play Everything amen you had a goal in your mind and um and you with your with your Doo you you have to right and and and my dad can play anything but he's got one he but he he he's centered on the guitar now dad can play anything he wants to amen me I didn't Center on anything and so now I just like I'm not good at anything I I can just fill in wherever and and you've got and if you're going to get good at something you set the goal and say this is where my love is H I feel like I'm just preaching a flop here tonight but I but I'm telling you right now where's the goal you can't have your cake and eat it too what do you want what do we want if we want more of God then we can't have more of friends and this and that and this and that and this and that and still maintain a walk with God if if we're wanting to overcome we've got to Center our zero wi and say I I want more of you more than I want breath I want more of you more than I want wealth I want more of you than I want anything well can you say amen amen what we want what is it because there is we want all of the distractions away so that we can rise in the power of His might brother Brenham would put it this way he would say be simple just ask don't figure it out don't try to study it just believe it don't mentally figure it out just believe it with your soul the first conflict that ever come into the world was because somebody was seeking worldly wisdom instead of a simple faith in God listen to this you you say Dr so and so doesn't believe it that that doesn't change God's word word a bit remember you're not saved by wisdom you are not saved by your education you are saved by faith in Jesus Christ forget about your education and be simple in your own Doctrine Amen in the church age book and I'm closing but brother Brenham would say in the church age book in the sardian uh age he says in short christiandom has become a labyrinth the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and and how many knows what a labyrinth is it's it's it's a it's a maze it's it's got the little um uh how many's ever been in a maze or a corn corn maze or in those kinds of things and you know you've got one way in and one way out but then once you get in there Hallelujah I don't like them it just gets me confused I'm going I'm trying to think it out and and the prophet would tell us that Christendom has become that until it's so many different ways and he saying you've got to come back because the Salvation is not multiple it's a faith in Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ Alone can you say Amen be simple there are not many approaches to Salvation there's only one approach to Salvation there's only one way and it's Jesus Christ alone it's the the finished work of Calvary and if you fail to believe that Christ paid the price for you you're lost there's only one formula for being baptized or or for being born again Hallelujah blood water and spirit there's only one way to be baptized repent and be baptized every one of you and the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's only one way to be a disciple of Jesus Christ Jesus says if you're not willing to forsake your life and pick up your cross and follow me you're not worthy to be my disciple amen see it's it's it's a it's a it's not many it's not just anything it's pretty simple we simply follow the ways that God's laid out for you and me well praise the Lord for a simple guy like me that that makes me feel pretty good you see it's not it is simply taking God at his word and saying Lord I'm going to see my victory I'm going to see my victory I'm going to attend to my Lord without remember what was my title this morning amen my title this morning I was created to serve him I was created remember amen Adam and Eve and though Eve had fallen short though Eve had failed Adam wasn't going to stay in Paradise alone Adam came down Adam took on the sin of his wife amen Adam couldn't do anything about redeeming her but our Adam was able to redeem us and our Adam was saying listen I want you get that mentality that you're not an overcomer you've got to get the mentality that you came from me you are who I am you are the feminine portion of God can you say Amen there's only one way for the perfecting of the church amen that's through the preaching of the Gospel 1 Corinthians 1:18 for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God 1 Corinthians 1:21 for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that are lost there's only one requirement for healing faith in the finished work of Calvary there's too many distractions too many voices of reason too many doctor's opinions too many things but what did the scripture say casting down every thought every imagination every High thing that exalts itself above the knowledge of God Amen I listen I just I heard brother brandom as he was the anointing was there and and and and then he stops and he says Mister you sitting in the wheelchair you on the cot you you here or back Yonder where wherever you are if you're born of the spirit of God you got just as much right to rise from that chair and wheel cart tonight as any other man has you're born again get a little grit about you stand up and Jesus Christ standing here in his word proving what he is showing signs wonders miracles of his resurrection what more do we want well if God just someday I you're missing the point God's not someday you are the one that God's given the land to his anointing is upon you zero in get that sword and say Satan I'm anointed for this I'm anointed for this I don't have to knuckle down I don't have to quit I don't have to turn around I don't have to cry I'm anoy for this they say that India has got some of the richest resources under their grounds but because of their religion and because they're afraid of killing a natat or a ant or killing because they believe in reincarnation americ is getting close to being that way and they Gods but they won't let them they don't they won't drill they they they they they just there's so much things that they they have so many resources in the land of India they're wealthy they're wealthy and yet the majority are poor they they've got the resources but they don't have the knowledge to put it to work well praise the Lord I I do do you all believe do do you do do we really believe that that this is the power of God we've got the resources and I'm just happening to believe that God sent us a amen a seventh angel messenger he sent us our own spiritual Einstein and says listen you can put this thing to work you can be everything that God has said in his word can you say amen amen if the musicians would come praise the Lord I think too many times y'all heard the story of the Old Crow how many remembers the story of the crow amen farmer got tired of the crows coming in and eating his corn and eating his his crops so he finally caught one of those old crows as they come in and and um tied a little tied a little string around his his foot and gave him about 30 40 feet to play with and put him right down there and every time the crows would try to come he would take off try to follow him and amen and and um all all the action it would it would it would um scare the others away and so he had his own real scarecrow and so finally I a fell came by and you know sing sing this poor Crow out there and he had he had wore a he had wore a circle clean around that that that little peg in the ground where he he'd get out as far as he could go and he just got got pretty well accustomed being stuck there and the nice fella came over there caught the crow got his pocket knife out and cut the rope and uh but the crow didn't fly off the crow didn't fly off at all the crow day and the guy just you know sort of so well do what you want to do so the next time the crows came by next season as they were all beginning to fly over did you know what happened they say that the crow flew up as far as he could get what he was used to and he stopped right there where he had stopped all of those other times before he did not have have a rope on his foot anymore he did not have a string there was no bondage there was nothing there but he was imprisoned in his mind imprisoned in his mind therefore he would just go around the same old rut that he's went around all of this other time Bo it sounds like a bunch of Christians just go through the same old cycle God's not called you to go through cycle God's called you to fly Hallelujah fly high fly strong let the power and the presence of God lift you up in the spirit of prayer you say well I've I've tried praying and I and and I I I want I want a a closer walk with God I want a closer prayer life I want these things in my life amen break the cycle I've always started but I I I I brother Wendell I always pull back something always discourages me someone does something and it gets me and I fall right back down brother wend I I I just don't know I'm I I wish I I I I wish I could overcome I just want to tell you right now son of God all power of Heaven is invested in you you got got got to push past those things that try to hinder you in your mind push past those feelings maybe someone across the aisle done something to you and it's it's hindered you in the name of the Lord tonight make up your mind make up your mind I've not been called to just be a halfway I've been called to go all the way make up your mind those that are looking for the Holy Ghost and the devil is is saying you'll never get it make up your mind I'm not listening to that anymore I'm going to get the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost the devil's said you're always going to be bound by that pornography in the name of the Lord the blood has set you free get up fly you been created to fly fly in God's Great [Music] Heavens amen praise the Lord I think the greatest thing that Satan can ever do is keep us us down in condemnation and when we've been pressing towards our goal can can you imagine the condemnation that Samson must have felt could you imagine the condemnation that the man of Corinth y' y'all remember the man of Corinth who's who who took his father's wife to be his wife and laid with her y'all remember that and and and the Apostle Paul says listen cast him out for the destruction of the flesh that his soul can be saved I mean you remember that you you you you you remember when Peter made a big flub of himself and the and the Apostle Paul told told the church he said I had to withstand him to his face because he was causing divisions recovery is a great thing for it but did you know that in any mission of the military or anything they plan for Recovery I like to fly but I I I and I when I'm on that jet airplane I don't like those stewardess is coming up there and saying we're glad you're coming we're glad you're apart we tell you to put your seat back belts on in the case of an emergency there'll be something popped down we if you lose oxygen you got to put this mask on you know and then for those of you that are on an exit roll I want you you look at this exit that exit then the in the if you have to jump out you and I'm sitting there thinking but recovery is part of it in war in those kinds of things you're going to get wounded you're going to get your mind uh uh in this in this gospel War you're going to get your minds wounded you're going to get fighter jets they don't want them to fall out of the sky but if they do here's what you do how many's been a part of a fire drill we don't want your house catching on fire but want you to meet out there by the mailbox everyone get out however you can recovery and we've got the greatest recovery POS policy than any of anybody else I say I I I I say they're in they're in first John where's that at first first John uh is it one and no uh one and one brother I say that you sin not but if you do sin we have an advocate with the father two 1 John 2 and one amen my little children these things are write unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Christ Jesus the righteous for he is the perpetuation for our sins and not our sins only but for the sins of the world hereby we know that we know him if we keep his commandments so we know oh blessed be the name of the Lord you know what that means that means tonight if there's one of you young people that are missing the mark there's plenty of blood if there's any mamas and daddies grandpas and grandmas preachers deacons trustees Sunday school teachers musicians Pastor we've got an advocate and we got to get back up and we got to keep pressing toward that goal can you say am man I believe it was brother Timothy one time when he was preaching here he was talking that he had read something about those that were as they were storming the uh uh coming in on the shores of Normandy and and and it got such such a bad deal and they were there were some of them that were wounded and it and it seemed like they weren't going to make it and but but those soldiers said that they would draw a line in the sand man and they were struggling get across and then they'd get up and they' draw another Line in the Sand and then they they'd struggle and then they'd get another line and they said they'd done that until they were able to reach where they were going but they had to keep they had to keep their heads about them to get to safety to get over where they belonged and I say tonight by the by the blood of Jesus Christ that we will not we will not bow to the powers of the devil in our lives can you say Amen aren't you in love with him here this evening I love him with all of my heart as we look into our hearts here tonight getting ready to dismiss why don't you ask the Lord to renew renew the purpose have I become fearful have I become bitter have I become unbelieving do I believe that no weapon formed against me shall prosper do I do I believe that the Eternal God lives in me Lord renew me in the spirit of my mind let me go outside these doors with a greater fight in me than what I came in these doors tonight to reach that goal to be everything that God wants me to be you're anointed for it the only thing that can keep you from it is that unbelief in my name they shall cast out devils in my name they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name do you believe that tonight Hallelujah father we thank you thank you for your divine grace Your Divine Mercy I pray Lord that you would take my jumbled up way of preaching tonight and that you would Minister it to every heart I'm asking Lord that that great eternal life of God would so Reign and so come under the power of the Holy Ghost that you would Empower everyone from the youngest to the oldest from the least to the greatest I thank you for your power I thank you for your blood I thank you for all that you are in the name of the Lord Jesus take all
