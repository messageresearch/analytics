and uh but we're sure glad we we appreciate them coming back home I tried to convince them just St up there but they said no we we need to be here this morning and so uh so we're glad for we appreciate them coming back and their their diligence and and love for the church why don't we turn here to Second Peter 3 and12 my my iner monitors are uh are just crackly and I've got them turned all the way up uh I think I think maybe oh something's happening amen that's better amen it's still crackly but I I do have some volume now amen I um I've been ministering along the lines of of the Overcomer and I I know it has been pretty simple and um but I've just been hitting some some some um just some areas that amen that um I I think we need to apply in our everyday walk and today I want to preach on vigilance and um let's look here in second Peter 3 and uh 12 it says looking for and Hasting un to the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found in him found of him in peace without spot and blameless now I want us to all read this together wherefore be beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of Our Lord God or our lord of Salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you and um uh well let's just go one down as also and his other Epistles speaking in in them of some of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrestle as they do also the other scriptures under their own destruction ye therefore beloved uh seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the heir of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness but grow in great gra and in the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory now and forever amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your your goodness to us and thank you Lord for the presence that we feel here today and Lord the song that brother Merl felt on his heart to sing Lord you are Lord and that is that is what we want Lord is you to be the Lord of our of our spirit of our soul of our bodies we want you to be the Lord of this service and we ask Lord that you would come Among Us and speak to us and teach us of your word father help us Lord forgive us of all of our sins forgive us of all of our transgressions Lord we want to please you and to love you we thank you for your love to us in Jesus name we pray amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning we want to beware lest you also being led way with the wicked fall from your own steadfastness and we want to be found diligent be diligent that we may be found in him in peace without spot and blameless we know that we're in the coming of the Lord there is there is no doubt in our mind we can see we can see where we are at today amen we we can see uh the world is in the chaotic condition Israel is our time piece as we as we can see uh things that are are taking place there and there there's a power of of of uh Darkness there's a power of of hatred against the Jews we understand that the scripture has has declared in these last days that there would be uh 200,000,000 demons that uh would be released from the Euphrates river and there would be great Havoc that be upon the Earth amen first of all it will be upon the Jews as we have a scene that it's not just a natural hatred it's not just amen but there has been a a hatred from Satan against the the the Jews for many years since they have crucified the Lord Jesus there has been uh there that that demon those those Devils have have have been after the Jew and but because they and we understand according to Revelations the 12th chapter amen that it was the Jews that that carried the bloodline of the natural lineage of Jesus and it would be it was the Jews that God first dealt with and amen they were God's people and of course God has has a has um uh provoked them to jealousy by a people who were no people and that is the Gentile bride and because of the the the connection between God and those people the Jews Satan has tried to destroy them and because of the connection of the Bride Satan is out to kill you you and to destroy you and so as I uh Minister here this morning on vigilance amen the word Vigilant means to keep careful watch for possible danger or difficulties it means Wide Awake alert eagley observant attentive on one's guard so to to be uh uh uh Vigilant amen is to is to know your surroundings and know that there is an enemy that that that wants to kill you and uh amen so the opposite of vigilance of course would be negligent inattentive amen unresponsive um uh careless amen and so we we want to in order to resist the devil you've got to know where you are you've got to know who you are You' got to know what he is and I think Amen in order to do that you've got to find your place in scripture and that's why God sent a prophet in this day to point to you the scriptures that is related to you so that you can know how to fight and destroy the enemy amen I I I I do love the um as we listen to Netanyahu uh give his speeches amen he knows who he is and Israel knows who they are and they always point back amen Abraham was our father this nation is founded because God gave it to us this is our land he has he has a root that he can go back to amen it is founded upon the principle of God's word that nation of Israel amen belongs uh uh that that ground belongs to the Jew can you say amen and brother bradam would say for you he would say it's the most glorious time of all ages because we are facing the great Millennium again we're facing the Eden again but right at this age all the deceit all every tactic that he has ever used and has been able to deceive with he's gathered it all together and reinforced himself now this is amen this was there in Satan's Eden there in 65 and and so he is saying we are while we are at amen the the brink of the Millennium and while we are we are nearing what we have longed for looked for all of the ages have been looking for this time amen he is saying at this age you've got to remember all of the deceit amen every tactic that God or that Satan has ever used amen that he's able to deceive with all of the horse riders all of the deception is is is being brought in and focused on this one age and that is to prevent the Bride of Jesus Christ and so I think it's I think it's uh important that we that that we not get into a quagmire in our walk with God Amen a quagmire is a you know is a soft boggy area of ground that gives way under your foot and amen you know where you can't you you you you can't stand solidly and it's Amen you you just you're sinking in the ground but God's given us a solid ground it's divine revelation Satan comes out and he has presented a religion without a foundation there is no Foundation it's not there's nothing to really put your faith upon but the Gospel of Jesus Christ is solid it does have a foundation that Foundation is Jesus Christ and we are built upon Jesus Christ and the adop doctrines of the Apostles and I I I say today we we we we should we should be thankful for the doctrines that these amen that God has given us through the Lord Jesus Christ and those Apostles can you say amen amen God has pulled us the scripture says he's pulled us out of the Miry clay and he has set our feet upon a rock that is secure that Solid Rock Amen and so uh uh uh those swampy spirits have no hold you know those swamp you know swamp is a low lying uncultivated amen ground where water collects and amen it's just Wasteland there's there there you can't build anything on it it's just swampy but God's called you out of that now amen sometimes we get swampy in our in our thinking we get swampy in our walk with God we get swampy in our prayer life we get swampy in our Amen in our relationship with the Lord amen and and and again amen it's it's just uncultivated ground but God doesn't want swamping God wants solid Christians built upon the solid revelation of who he is well praise the Lord amen I'm going to tell you it's not God's will for you to have a muddled up spirit amen a mind of confusion a mind that is that that that has no peace and has no joy I I I I'm here to tell you we are in the last of the last there should be Joy there should be peace there should be love there should be perseverance there should be vigilance because we are on the last leg of the journey how many believes that the Rapture is is Right Upon Us amen I uh we were talking the other night amen I was talking uh we we were sitting there talking with Brother John and sister April and I said you know it it it could be just just just like this where we're just sitting amen and and and and then amen right right before our right here with us and the Rapture take place I believe it's coming I believe it's here I I listen Friends The Rapture is upon us I do not believe the Rapture is in another generation I believe the Rapture amen is so close to us it could be this very moment it could be this morning and we must be Vigilant against that enemy well can you say amen amen a muddled up spirit is to busy yourself Amen in a confusing or ineffective way a muddle up spirit is just running around without purpose a muddle up spirit amen is doing things that that that that really doesn't have a purpose brethren we need to keep one thing in mind and that is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen while we're working amen while we're raising our family while we're playing Amen on the playground amen there should be one desire and that is to make this Rapture amen I believe that amen now now why is the world in a in a in an identity crisis why do we have boys and girls trying to figure out who they are and why amen do we have so many the the world is in a huge identity crisis and and the reason they're in this huge identity crisis amen is because they have forsaken the way of life amen and and it and it gets into a amen the church has got into that state of identity crisis until amen we don't know what part of the word we're going to believe and what part of the word we're not going to believe I amen well brother teaches it this way and this brother teaches it that way well you know I I just believe that we need to just read the Bible and believe it for what it says believe it for what it says believe the scriptures come back to scripture amen because this is the only thing that is going to keep us in this time now remember Satan wants to bind you to himself amen and that's what sin is has has has come in and the and the immoral things that have that have come and amen and Satan wants to bind you I I I think there is there is nothing any any any great greater uh binding power than Darkness Darkness amen secrecy I I it it keeps it it it it keeps you from amen knowing what what is out there amen you don't know what is out there you don't know where you're at you don't know amen because of the of the of the darkness around and secrecy even of sin you allowing sin secret sins allowing secrets between you know uh uh uh you and your wife allowing secrets between you know the secret sins and hiding them in your life it it keeps the spirit of God away from you it muddles it muddles up your mind amen because you know that sin is is is not is not right you also know that God knows that sin is there amen so so instead of Satan binding us to to these secret sins I believe it's time for us to be diligent and to bring these sins before God Amen confess them openly and say God I don't want these sins in my life well praise the Lord God has came with an open book God has revealed himself Amen in such Clarity today so that you can have a way of overcoming the evil one in this dark and gross uh this gross dark generation can you say amen amen that's right and so you just remember this when Satan has an impediment against you when Satan has something on you he can hold that against you and every time you try to rise above it every time you try to rise above it amen H H Satan will say but you know but you know and and before you know it amen you're you're you're you're back down in the chicken pin again amen why because Satan's got a little string on your finger or on on your on your leg amen when you should be up fly flying and saring in the heavens Satan's got you Earthbound I say it's time to get rid of sin in our lives amen well praise the Lord amen Satan there condemning you there's one thing that Satan condemns you on Amen and and he and he doesn't have no strongholds amen he's lying against you he can can listen you can accuse me well I forgive you brother wend for for going out and getting drunk and amen well I guess you could if I if I had got out and got drunk but if I never got drunk if I've not been drunk then you then there's nothing you can hold against me can you say amen and so we want to make sure that the sins that the sins of our of our spirit and our body and and our soul amen are covered beneath the blood of Jesus Amen and I don't believe in that dirty Grace I I I I just simply believe that the blood of Jesus is able to forgive you of your sins and it's also able to deliver you from the power of sin where you no longer have to go back out and do the things of the world you are free from sin well bless the name of the Lord amen but but the church has taken on that amen that hypocrisy spirit amen it's a religious spirit that'll let us set in a church let let us pray let us go through the forms and while there are sins in our lives amen and it's holding us from Victory it's holding us from from praise it's holding us from amen overcoming the devil therefore we're defeated therefore we're discouraged therefore we are powerless but I want to tell you today the blood of Jesus is still powerful today if there is a man in a woman that is willing to rise in the power and say God I I want to bring every sin I want to lay it at Calvary and I want to leave it there well is there anyone else that wants to be free from the power of sin God I believe it was the psalmist it says Lord take forgive me and take away even my hidden secret sins Amen Let Me Hide Your word if there's going to be any hiding going on let me hide your word in my heart amen if there's going to be any if there's going to be any secrecy going on let it be a secret prayer in the prayer chamber let me get a hold of you I want your power in my life amen that's right Hallelujah Delilah Satan was able to find what was going on with Eve found where the power was at amen and and and it sold us all into into sickness and death amen that we're in today Delilah found the secret to uh to Samson's strength amen and he laid it her lap too long he thought that he could overcome he thought that he could and he did amen many of times he was laying in her lap and amen and and and and she says the Philistines are on you and he jumped up and strong as he ever was but there came a time where she found his secret amen and when he jumped up he had no power there he was powerless well praise the Lord and I say we're in that D today where the church has has lost its power because the enemy has found where her strength is you get bogged down you get away from God's word and you get muddled up in your mind you get bogged down in your spirit and you have no Authority with God but come back to the Bible come back to the absolute come back to a faith that'll believe God's word and I'm going to believe it I don't care what brother says sister says what the Pope says what what the preacher says what anything would say that would take me away from the word of God I want to stand up on that Hallelujah well can you say Amen why would you allow the devil to hold things over your head when you have the ability to bring him to God and put them under the blood of Jesus Christ why would you amen set there in your pride and allow the devil to keep you from being powerful I say today it's time for us to do some house cleaning some soul searching and get those Devils off of our back because we are victorious you young people are victorious you m and daddies are victorious you preachers are victorious God's called us to Divine Victory can you say Amen you weren't created to shine the devil's shoes you weren't created to amen pack his bag amen you're created to to to to follow the lord Jesus Christ just once more the prophet would say if that isn't just about the way the enemy likes to do when he's when he can get you down but he doesn't dare try as long as the power of God is operating through the church amen he he would be afraid to do that when the Nazarite blessings upon you but if he can see you whipped that's when he makes fun of you and that's when he can see can say there's no difference between them and us they're just the same uh man like we are amen but there's something different something outstanding with Jehovah's blessings upon it amen then they're scared to say anything can you say amen I want to be that kind of an individual hallelujah amen I I I I I I I've you know I told some a young person the other day I said well amen if if if you don't want to hear Mama's uh uh uh uh and Daddy's complaining to you and and and getting on to you so much then maybe you ought to stop and and think a little bit about what they're saying that's getting you in trouble hallelujah amen I would rather have the blessings of mom and dad than to have the Wrath amen give me a heart that is willing to follow the lord Jesus Christ amen amen well is that all right here this morning Hallelujah I said is that all right here this morning amen I say expose the devil that wants to shame you expose that devil that is wanting to keep you under his under his thumb can you say amen and I believe that the greatest thing that we could do is to be identified with God if you're going to identify yourself with God you're going to have to identify yourself with humility because you cannot serve God in the world at the same time you've got to humble yourself amen and walk with God Amen in identifi the identified Christ of all ages 64 it says that's the way we find God when we take off our pride lay it down walk up into his presence and listen to that voice identify I am that I am I am the god of Abraham Isaac and of Jacob I remember my promise I see the condition can you say amen amen another one he would say that's the way he does it amen what did he do it he says he said by identifying himself in his characteristics in the Supernatural and the supernatural sometimes is so phenomenal that it gets away from the people and the people get you know get to be good people nice people amen but sometimes they just understand it amen and misunderstanding and I I say God I want the supernatural in every day of my life I I want to get so part of the supernatural amen that that I have a hard time amen uh uh uh uh finding walking in the natural can you say Amen now we understand that we're living in the precursor of The Sixth Seal the fifth and The Sixth Seal is is we we we we understand that the Judgment of of the Jews we are uh uh uh that the there is fixing to come a time on Israel like no other time amen we we understand that amen the Battle of Gog and Magog is amen if this isn't uh uh uh the the the the the the the setting up of right now I we I believe with all of my heart that go and Magog is is amen the the the the the steps are being uh uh put in position where all of the world is going to turn against Israel amen the devil's are going to try to to destroy Israel and they're going to fight they're going to have they they've going to have some they're going to have some Bloodshed can you say amen amen but we also know that it's going to be the supernatural presence of God that comes down and fights for Israel it's going to be God coming down with earthquakes and amen and Bible says wind and and tornadoes and there's going to be come there's going to be things that come against these that are trying to destroy Israel because Israel we understand that God's dealing with Israel bringing Israel back to that Homeland not just Jerusalem amen but back to himself they were the blood of Jesus Christ has has redeemed them can you say Amen now I I want us to just read for a few minuts I want to give you a just give y'all some scriptures here uh there in Revelation 6 and9 I and I and I I I want you to I want you to to to see how many how many uh here this morning can say excuse me can say that you you can see that there is some real uh evil Powers working against Israel right now these nations are what what has Israel ever done to the Palestinians what has Israel ever done Amen to to to Lebanon and those except for bringing blessings to them they don't come in there and trying to to kill their children or try matters of fact amen Israel's got all kinds of of of uh uh uh you know Arabs that live there in the nation of Israel they sure do amen they sure do so they're not trying to go out and kill and and Destroy but there is an evil spirit that is orchestrating amen uh the these nations to fight against Israel did you know that the Bible says that it was going to happen the Bible says it was going to happen amen and there is a reason for it happening Israel must get her eyes off of herself off of the prosperity of her land and she's got to turn her heart to the true atonement which is Jesus Christ she has got to accept the atonement now right now she's still amen under the blood of bulls and goats and they still doing those kinds of things but Israel well listen folks amen the Gentile church is fixing to be caught up God is is is moving his attention from the Gentiles back to the Jews and he's preparing the Jews Hallelujah you know what I really believe I believe that there is Moses and Elijah I believe the spirit of Moses and the spirit of Elijah is there in Israel right now I believe that there are the two prophets over there right now I believe amen that things are transpiring and getting ready well you might not believe it you don't have to amen but I'm here to tell you I believe we're that close sir Hallelujah when you see all these nations turning against when you see amen the hatred the ha come on church amen look at the hatred in the United States for look look at the hatred all around the world for the Jews that's taking place right now these are devils but what are those Devils to do drive them back to their Homeland and that Homeland is not just is not just Israel but to know the Lord Jesus Christ amen now amen Revelation 6 and9 it says when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God Amen let's see um praise the Lord um where am I at see nine oh the fifth seal okay when under the fifth seal I saw of the altar of the souls them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they laid now I I want to I want to just say here the Jews so since the time of that Israel has uh was since they rejected Christ and Titus came in amen and they have been and they have and and they were scattered across every nation in the earth amen this they those Souls that are they they all under that fifth seal all under that altar amen it says for the testimony which they had and they cried how long amen uh saying uh uh how long oh Lord holy intrude does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren should be killed as they were should be fulfilled and so we're understanding that that is the Jewish seal that is the fifth seal it doesn't come into its fullness until after the church so I want you to understand amen the the the seal is going to be amen but we're in the precursor of the opening of this what we are seeing in the in the hatred for the Jew today amen what is it going to be when the church has taken out when the Rapture has taken place can you say Amen now we know that the fifth seal and The Sixth Seal amen is the Great Tribulation it's going they they happen amen consecutively they're in the 12th verse 612 of Revelations I beheld and when he' opened the six seal and oh there was a great earthquake and the sun become black a sackcloth of hair and and the moon become as blood and the stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is uh shaken of A Mighty Wind and the and the heavens uh Heaven departed as a scroll when it rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of its place and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the captains and the Mighty Men And every bondman and every Freeman hid themselves in dens and rocks of mountains and said to the rocks and mountains fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth upon the throne from the Wrath of the lamb for that great day of his wrath has come who is able to stand and so we we we understand that this is this is the precursor this is this is the the the setting up the foundation has being has been laid for for this that is taking place amen it's a it's a place where the world is is full of chaos amen it's a it's a place where the word of God is is totally amen been mutilated and amen and and dissected and and set aside it's a place where Jesus Christ is no longer revered and loved amen it's a place that Sinners no longer come to an altar to to to get changed in their heart and get changed in their lives amen they just come up and shake a preacher's hand and still go out there and live in sin and smoke their dope and drink their booze and amen and do those kinds of things there is nothing there amen there is no conviction in the heart because of the evil spirits that are all around and church I want to tell you that that that that devil is here to interpret the word of God to you too amen oh yeah you might say well I don't drink and I don't cut cuss and I don't do this but but the devil is right there to turn turn your attention away from the word of God and giving your everything and being vigilant amen and being and being on fire for the word of God he can you say Amen what was God's desire amen what did God pronounce there in this church age he says Thou sayest that you are amen uh rich and increase with good but I say you're riched I say you're miserable I say you're naked I say what can you say man he says you're you're lukewarm I wish you were cold and I wish you were hot but because you are lukewarm you're no longer mean you you don't claim to be a sinner you don't claim to be someone on fire amen you know those are just Fanatics amen those are just brandom eyeses that's just window Martin over there at that church but you're lukewarm you'll go to church occasionally amen you'll say Amen occasionally amen but I want to tell you I'll spew you out of my mouth the day of judgment is coming someone say it with me the day of of judgment is coming amen the wrath of God is fixing to be poured out but there is a church who has accepted the blood of Jesus Christ and has taken the atonement and said I want to be washed can you say Amen Now We're Here Revelations 9 and 1 now we understand that this Revelations 9 And1 is amen the tribulation time this is the fifth Seal The Sixth Seal amen this is there when the fifth angel had sounded and I saw a star fall from Heaven into the Earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit amen now this is not going to be a a literal uh a literal pit amen it's not going to be a literal key a but this is the day when religion without Foundation what is a bottomless pit amen it is religion without Foundation bottomless there's no Foundation to it amen where do praying the saints come from out of the bottomless pit where do statues come from out of the bottomless pit where do coming up and shaking the preacher's hand amen uh H to to be saved come from out of the bottomless pit where does uh putting your name on a row come from out of the bottomless pit where where do amen that it's okay for a woman to cut her hair amen out of the bottomless pit where is it okay for a woman to stand behind the pull pit to preach of the bottomless pit amen all of these religion all of these dogmas all of these things that people are clinging to amen are are you can't find no foundation in the Bible it doesn't come from the Bible they have their opinions they are basing their Eternal destination up on opinions that have come out of the bottomless pit are y'all understanding me now the scripture says that in the last days amen it would come so much that the smoke would cover the whole earth amen smoke fills every crevice how many's ever been around smoke amen and and it'll cover it covers every crevice and Corner Crook and Cy amen I'm I'm here to tell you amen you go up there on a bonfire and and and and you get you know you go back home you're underclothes your socks smell like smoke amen it gets everywhere amen and that's what this religion has done Satan has so infiltrated amen the people's minds and the people's hearts with unbelief until amen it has reached every Palace it has reached every high place it's reached every uh politician amen it's reached the cner it's reached the pope it's reached everywhere amen this smoke of unbelief is everywhere amen it's affecting the whole world amen and what is this what is this thing it's Amen that that that smoke amen until you can preach the Bible until there's no amen it's covered the sun amen you there's there's no sunlight anymore there's no amen it's all there there's no convicting power there's there's nothing of that nature anywhere can you say amen amen listen now amen but there's going to be an overcomer in these ages now now we we uh if you read on down amen Accord of course there amen these demons amen out come and came out of the smoke Locust upon the Earth and unto them was given power as the Scorpions of the Earth have power and it was given to them that they should uh not hurt the grass or the Earth and neither any green thing neither uh uh uh uh but tree but those that have not the Seal of God in their foreheads andto them it was given that they should not kill them but that it should be uh they should be tormented for 5 months and and and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion that that strikes a man and I tell you what let's let let me just go ahead and well we'll just go Ahad and continue let's let's go Ahad and continue to reading sister Keys amen uh the sixth verse there in those days shall men seek death and it shall not find it and it shall desire to die and Death Shall flee them amen and the shapes of the Locust were as under like under horses prepared under battle on their heads were as that were crowns like gold and their faces were as faces of men and they had hair as the hair of women and they had teeth as the teeth of lions and they had breastplates and as it were breastplates of iron the sound of their wings was as the sound of Chariots and many horses running to battle and they had tails like under scorpions and there were stings in their tails and and their power was to hurt men for five months and they had a king over them which is the Angel of the bottomless pit which name whose name in the Hebrew tongue is abidan but in the Greek tongue hath his name aoleon amen and so so we we we find that that that these are now these are not literal the prophet told us these are not literal scorpions and literal Locust but these are demons amen that have that have come to Earth and people are going now brother brandom says before the coming of the Lord the Earth would just go insane amen that they would see things amen mental illness would rise amen why because of of the sin that is prevailing upon the church amen upon the Earth can you say amen amen so so we understand that we're living in the in in the days where the wrath of God is fixing to be poured out amen this requires vigilance somebody say help me to be vigilant me be vigilant this requires men and women who know how to pray and spend time in prayer and calling out to God Amen and oh I want to tell you even in the time of all the darkness even in the time of all of the sin and the perversions and and the smoke out of that bottomless pit there is a blood that will sanctify the elect there is a blood be vigilant walk with God live with God stay with God Amen be vigilant about it amen now so we can see the fifth seal has to do with the Jews we have the Sixth Seal which is the Great Tribulation amen we understand that the ninth chapter amen is is when the minds are going to be so darkened amen and the evil spirits are going to take over praise the Lord amen now hallelujah it's in that day that the two 100,000,000 devils are going to be released out of the Euphrates amen now amen if you were to read the ninth chapter the sixth or the 13th verse and the sixth Angel sounded and I Heard a Voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying the sixth Angel which the trumpet loose the Four Angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates and the Four Angels were loose which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year to slay the third part of mountain and the number of the army of the horsemen that were 200,000,000 that's 2 million and and I heard the number of them amen and thus I saw the horses in the vision and and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of zinc and and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issue fire and smoke and brimstone and by these three was the third part of man killed and by the fire by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were as serpents and and had heads and with them they do hurt and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and Idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk neither repented they of the murders uh nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts now now this is this is this is the this is the demon powers that are coming upon the Earth and hopefully I'm I'm going to bring this all together to make sense you know when you're reading the book of Revelations these things are done in symbol form amen and this is the same thing here this is not literal uh horses these are not literal uh uh uh uh breathing fire out but these are demon powers what is the Beast a beast is a power amen the 200,000 Horsemen these are demons that are going to be released that have been released in this final day amen now now you say well I I just don't know about that amen well that's why we need to be listening to the message of the hour because the prophet of God told us these things and when you when you hear these things and you look at these things then you understand why the preacher preaches that there should be some fervency and and and I preach that there should be uh uh don't don't don't allow anything anything somebody say nothing allow nothing in your lives don't let the devil interpret the word to you in any way don't let him miscue anything to you he done it in one area of of of Eve's life and here we are today I say in the name of Jesus Christ come under the token word of the day amen it feels can you say Amen what are we fighting today amen though you've got the blood of Jesus Christ you're you're you're you're you're fighting those Devils amen those 200,000,000 Devils that are after Jews they're also after us brother Bram would say when Hitler and them persecuted the Jews and did the things that they' done Stalin and Hitler and those dictators had raised up if we had the time which to rehearse it to to some newcomers but but we but we've went through it and under the same age where uh that there had been in Germany and and the other nations and the Jews it's scattered throughout all the land H H but there has raised in the in the last 20 years a bitter persecution against the Jews I I've I've been out there in the the old places where they burnt their bodies and cremated and their Ashes to fertilize the ground Jewish children women and everything and and they tried to deny it and try to and take them right out and show them where it was done amen it's been a bitter persecution against Israel because it's been the time calling him back to the atonement he is still under the atonement of a natural lamb when the real Lamb of God is the atonement and he's rejected it and the blood has been upon him ever since notice making ready the people how perfect that when the seventh trumpet and the seventh seal perfectly together the persecution of the Jews and notice in in Revelations the 9th chapter and the 13th verse and he says notice it real close under that sixth trumpet amen 9 and 13 the sixth trumpet note there was 200,000,000 Horsemen that had been bound in the rivers euphrat and was turned loose under the six trumpet and now there's he says now there's not 200,000 Horsemen in the world but but there's 200,000 uh uh uh but there was amen I I want you to jot it down now so you can read it it wasn't natural horses they breathed fire they had breastplates of Jasper they had tails and and end the tail looked like a serpent snake's head at the end of it stinging it was spiritual horses spirit ual Devils spiritual Chargers that have been bound in Euphrates all these years Supernatural Devils what was it the old Roman Empire was being revived the persecution of the Jews they had been bound for nearly 2,000 years at the river Euphrates can't cross to the promise a religious sect that was trying to get to the other side Euphrates you know amen come from Eden and they were bound there for 200,000,000 Devils of persecution he says now what happens under that six trumpet they were loosed on the Jews the persecution of the Jews Supernatural Devils nearly 2,000 years then loosed by Stalin and Hitler upon the Jews well you say well it wasn't Roman it's the same Spirit they done the same thing that they did to the Christians in the old Pagan Roman days now watch the natural Israel and the spiritual church now as we separated here now now he's going to show that now they after after those devils are after Israel in the natural to kill them because they were the one that birthed Jesus Christ but now he says but I want you to watch those same devils are after The Bride to make her formal powerless and defeated now watch he he says he says notice the loosening of this EC ecclesiastical Spirit now 20 years later after the war see the Loos of the ecclesiastical Spirit he goes on and says now we find that the natural power under the natural to a natural Nation Israel was loose there what did it went made war and it murdered and persecuted amen now in the ecclesiastical real I hope you open your eyes to see this now cuz I realize that it's just not speaking to this church but the tapes goes worldwide I don't mean to hurt your feelings but just tell the truth now the ecclesiastical Rim has been open from the natural Revival of the old p in Rome went forth on those Jews which always has been their enemy the lion with teeth and everything it stomped and broke out the people in Rome always been God's enemy amen and it was turned loose In The Same Spirit by the dictators of the world because the the the religious system was still holding but now it's been loosed now what is it in the kindness amen now now now it's coming to our day he says now what has it done in the kindness it has he said he comeing like flatteries and what has he done bringing the Protestant ecumenical council of the world churches and the spirit of the Antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride now how they are loosed in the ecclesiastical Spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations but upon the bride Satan's not not after the denominations Satan is after the bride but you know what the bride has already heard from a prophet the bride has already heard from the spirit of the Lord the bride is Vigilant amen she is watching and watch he says but now that you'll get it the bride will not go through that the Bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you see ministers can't you see that Brethren the church has to go through the persecution for the Perfection of it but the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride now now why am I doing all of this reading and all this talking is because we've got to see where we're at if you can understand that there are devils that are out against Israel right now the natural always portrays the spiritual hallelujah oh are you you hearing me amen and there is a v listen they say that Israel is more aggressive right now than they have been that they have ever been uh since since they have become a nation back in 1948 amen Israel is becoming aggressive amen they they it's just blown everybody away I guarantee you they're amen they're wishing that those devils are wishing that they would have just sort of kept lobbing a few missiles over occasionally hallelujah amen but I'm I'm here to tell you it's time for you you and me to really understand who we are in this conflict we're not the natural Israel we are the spiritual Israel those demons are out there to try to amen make us lukewarm make us amen just church members well can you say amen amen I I'll tell you what what what the Bible says that you and I amen uh have got to watch for and I I just want to read just a just a few of these here uh a few scriptures talking about in the last days and uh amen now now those we understand that there's been Devils that have been called out with all those Nations have all been called out Gog and Magog we we understand that that's the prince of Russia is going to come down and there's amen and and and if you were to see the the map of of all of those that have that have been prophesied to come against Israel that I mean they're all going to come down that's already been prophesied it's in Ezekiel amen it it's it's it's it's going to happen amen come on now and and God's going to fight for her and and and all of that but before that can take place we've got to be out of here we're not going to be here for that persecution we're we're now listen amen the great the six seal is the Judgment of the wrath of God that's the great persecution upon the great and her daughters that's when the persecution is amen that's when the wrath of God is going to be poured out out the Great Tribulation no man will be able to buy or sell unless the pope gives him that permission unless you belong to the to that uh World Council of churches it's all being set up but what what I'm saying it's in the invisible Rim you don't see those things that are taking place but you can see what is taking place to Natural Israel when it's taking place in natural Israel I want you to know there must be a bride before God goes to Israel there must be a bride that is caught out Hallelujah so you don't think that those spirits that are that that are bringing that World Council of church together all of those demon powers that that are making an image to the Beast you don't think those Spirits ain't talking to you and trying to interpret the scripture to you and tell you what the amen uh uh what the scripture means and what it doesn't mean I'm here to tell you we we got to have a Bible Foundation we've got to have a religion with Foundation to it not because mama says it daddy says it preacher says it Pope says it anybody else says it we've got to have a foundation and we got to be vigilant to stand upon it now am I making sense so far now let's see what the church is going to look like now catch this this is what the church is going to look like in the last days Satan is going to come in and defile that church Church through that ecclesiastical power and he's going to take over until the church has no power no Victory no glory now watch this 2 Timothy 3 And1 know this also in the last days perilous or disastrous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves man I think that's the key thing right there lovers of their own selves not lovers of God but they are lovers of themselves lovers of pleasure lovers of of of me me me me and this is the church now Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors hey High minder High high-m minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof these are Christian people from such turnaway for of this sort are they which crep into houses which led captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with diverse lust ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth not now as Janice and jambers withstood Moses so do these also uh resists the truth men of corrupt mind repeate concerning the faith can you say Amen so so in the day that the prophet is to come there's amen as it was with Moses Janice and jambers are going to rise up and they're going to try to turn the heart this is to happen in the last days let's look here at 2 Timothy 4 And1 I charge thee and it's something for you kids to even know and have have in your Bibles because the these are these are spirits like at one that I just read you any spirit that is coming in that'll make you unthankful make you disobedient to your parents that'll make you despisers of those that are good make you high-minded prideful lovers of your own self these are spirits that have been released in this day to conquer you and it's already conquered the church but the bride is making herself ready these Spirits amen are not are not going to have a hold on us we're going to be holy we're going to be pure we're going to be humble we're going to take the humble seat amen we're going to love one another we're going to love Mom and Dad we're going to do everything we can to fall in line because that's what God's spirit does Amen so I think I think these things are very very prudent and and very pertinent for our day but second Timothy Timothy 4:1 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the living and the dead at is appearing in his kingdom preach the word be instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned into fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of evangelist make full proof of the ministry now the Apostle Paul is saying there's coming a time where they're going to Heap to themselves teachers are we not living in a day where you can we got all of these we got all of these mega churches with the mega preachers with uh everything else heaping to themselves Mega preachers teachers and they're teaching them what they want them to know they're turned to fables you can't you can no more get the gospel out of what you're hearing right but there is a bride who is preparing there's a bride who is preparing and she's reading her Bible she's not she's not sticking around John 3:16 God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that's wonderful he saved you now what what does he want you to do that now that you're saved amen hallelujah there's a whole bunch more of the Bible can you say Amen 1 Peter 2 and one amen it says and there were false prophets among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privately shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them and bring upon themselves Swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious ways this is to the church now pernicious Ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of now preachers anointed to preach against the truth imagine that it says through covetousness they with Fain words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingere Earth not in their damnation suth not for if God spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to Hell and delivering them into the chains of Darkness to be reserved into judgment and spared not the old world but saved Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes and condemn them with an overthrow making an example unto those that should after or after should live Godly and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation lifestyle of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them and seeing and hearing vexed his rightous soul from day to day with their unlawful Deeds for the Lord knoweth how to deliver The Godly out of Temptations and to reserve the unjust until the day of judgment to be punished but chiefly them that Walk In the Flesh in the lust of uncleanliness and despise government presumptuous are they self-willed they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities a whereas Angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord but these As Natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they count it pleasure to write in the daytime spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceiving while they Feast with you now it's amazing it's amazing how they can they can do all still believe in killing children and still belong to the Catholic Church they can they they they can they can believe in all of this transgender and mutilating these boys and girls mutilating giving them surgeries and turning boys into girls and girls into boys what however they do that doing that without parental consent and still claim to be Christians do you see the demons those demons are out there but those don't you don't you think for a moment that those Devils don't try to fight right here just as those Devils try to fight these devils and I want you m and daddies to understand there are real Devils that try to amen that that that plague that that try to get our boys uh uh uh lusting There's real homosexual devils that fights the Bride of Jesus Christ There's real lesbian Devils that try to infiltrate the Church of God there are real demons that are out there that want to try to come in against come on Church you're only exempt when you're on the foundation of the revelation of Jesus Christ the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against that amen but but that does not change the fact that many many many have been wounded in our circles okay true because the lack of diligence can you say amen amen now now they would they they would they would go and and and you can read the rest of that on down there but I I I'm I'm I'm trying to to just show you amen where we are at and how these devils are going to be released and they're they're going after after the Jews but he and and the denominations but he says what he's really trying to get at is the Bride of Jesus Christ amen don't you forget it don't you forget it when you're having a bad hair day amen just just remember those are devils that are just trying to come in amen hallelujah getting ready for church and then you get sick just just identify the devil identify that devil when when when man when when you're trying to do something and the devil come in and attack see we can identify him amen we identify him as the Antichrist those two million Devils that are to come after the bride and they're going to do it in the spirit realm so we don't amen now there's going to be many that give their lives there's going to be many put in jail there you know that that goes on around the world in those other countries but that's not the prophecy for the whole bride those demons are there trying to get you complacent those devils are there to trying to get you to Sidetrack the word of God and when he does you are on slippery slope you're back in swampy grounds you're muddled in your mind you're muddled in your heart you're allowing things and you cannot do it these are devils praise the Lord second 2 Thessalonians 2 I'm fixing to wind it down amen second Thessalonians 2 And1 we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ that by our gathering to him gather together unto him that you be not soon shaken in your mind or troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come the day of the Lord the day of the Lord is is the day of rapture it's the day of judgment that's going to be the fifth seal Sixth Seal amen so the day of the Lord it's all going that it there's got to be a Rapture fifth seal Sixth Seal tribulation time it's it's all going to be right there the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any day that the day shall not come except there be a falling away first the man of sin be revealed the son of predition uh who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worship so that he as God sets in the temple of God show himself that he is God remember ye not when I was yet with you I told you these things now now I want you to watch here we are amen he's going to he's going to claim to be God he opposes opposes the word of God he's going to set up another hierarchy and and and and here we are we finding that the church has bought into it show me a denomination that is living fervently with this Bible show me one denomination they've all they're all under their influence until anything goes anything flies anything there's no fervency with God prayer is a thing of the past amen there's no getting a hold of God there's no Supernatural in the lives there's nothing of that nature I'm here to tell you folks amen we don't belong to a denomination we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we're in love with with the Lord Jesus can you say Amen now remember amen he said there's going to be a great Falling Away remember ye not the fifth verse while I was with you and I told you these things now ye know sixth verse withhold it that that he might be revealed in his time the mystery of iniquity does already work only he who now lets will let until he be taken out of the way the Holy Ghost and the bride then shall the wicked be revealed from whom the Lord shall whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders with all deceivableness and unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a dam a lie and that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness can you say am M so this is a serious thing this is a serious thing don't let the power of influence Sidetrack you from the power of life well I'm predestinated brother Wendell I just don't believe these kind of sermons are important I believe the predestinated wants to hear these sermons cuz we must be clean we must be pure listen the Bible says those whose names are not written in that Lamb's Book of Life are all going to follow after that b system aren't you glad that God sent us a prophet find anyone today any of your any of your charismatic preachers any anybody today that'll tell you that it will be Rome that it is Rome the mother church and all of the denominations that are come that have come out of the mother church it's going to be Rome that is going to hold the influence and will rule the world Amen for the space of an hour it's going to be Rome that makes a covenant with the Jews it's going to be Rome but you know all of these guys that I was listening to I I listen I've listened to a few of them amen they're all they're all calling it Muslims that's it's going to be the Muslims the man of sin's going to come out of the Muslim world and and amen and so they they've got this whole that the King of the North Russia is is going to be but that's not what the prophet taught us and that's not the way the Bible taught us because that Beast amen we understand that that that power set on the on the city on uh uh uh Seven Hills we understand what the Lord prophesied and she was the one that Rome Church according to Revelations the 17th chapter she's the one that has the that that that's that's polluted the whole world with her religious systems she's the one that taught the whole world to to uh uh uh uh commit adultery against the word of God in other words that God's word is not the absolute and and and but we're living in the day to where we're not just following the word but we're living in the day to where the Bride of Jesus Christ has been pregnated with that word and we don't want any other words in the womb of our heart we we don't want to take another man's words into our mind we don't want to take Daddy's Mama's brothers sisters whoever we we want to make sure that we're Vigilant amen and we're guarding that heart just as a a woman's got to make sure that she's she's true to her husband and a man's got to make sure he's true to his wife so does his bride has to make sure you say well I don't believe in legalism you better be legalistic about it what what if a man were to say well I believe it's okay to look at other women I don't believe in legalism huh your wife don't believe that there needs to be something that is burning in your heart to stay true to Jesus Christ do we fail yes we fail and that we repent we ask God to give us Grace amen but our love is to Jesus Christ am I making sense here this morning our love is to Jesus now now amen in there there's you know we there there used to be the uh uh you know you you we used to just have the little X-rays and then we had the um uh what's what's the next thing up from the x-rays there's the cat scan it gives you a little bit more clarity then they invented the the MRI and and then I hear there's something even even greater than the MRI huh there's also the ultrasound and and and and so we had we we we had the X-ray back in Luther's day and then we we we had the the the the the C scan or whatever that is and and Cat Scan and then then then then you had the Mr God has brought it so clearly today for us to be able to see and the scripture says that what does what does uh Hebrews 4 uh what does uh uh s Keys um Hebrews 4 12 maybe the word of God is sharper and uh uh is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing to the dividing aunder of the Soul and Spirit and the joints of the maral is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and the scripture says we are naked before him is that on the next scripture or is that up above it amen there is neither is there any NE uh any creature that is not manifest in his sight for all things are naked and open into the eyes of him with whom we have to do but the word of God gives us the clarity so that we can can can walk with him amen now there's a lot of there's a lot of nonsense in the world and in and I I don't feel like I don't feel like I'm a good enough preacher to to to to to to be up here half the time but I do want you to understand the F the the urgency of what I'm talking about right now if there is an Israel that is facing a natural Israel that is facing for her life battling for her life you had better open up your spiritual eyes cuz if they're trying to kill the natural Israel what are those demons trying to do to you spiritual Israel and they'll come and I I'm telling you I'm telling you he'll hit sickness like even in our little congregation just bam just just just hit us all just every which direction with sickness what is he trying to do get us away from Faith get us away from it we think well we've prayed we've anointed I don't amen but we forget the scriptures where we're in a Warfare and you've got to fight f for every one of those promises and that takes Gap that takes someone with determination that takes someone that says hey I know what's going on I'm going to fight this devil this ain't just something that's just happening to my gut or happening to my head or happening to my you know my shoulder or happening to my kid or happening to my wife no this is a Dev and he's after your faith and he's just and he wants to he wants to try to just seow some kind of seeds of unbelief but we are not a part of the bottomless pit there might be smoke coming out of that religion without foundation and we are affected by it we are affected by it amen the reason listen the reason why our kids are are are having to be raised in a generation to where other kids don't know if they're boys and or a girl and they don't know which way they're right as the reason is is we're living in this world but we're not of this world this world is under judgment you say that's what what do you mean judgment the Bible says he turn he will turn them over to a repeate mind in other words he will sear their conscience Amen to where reprobate mind they will think they're doing God a service they will think that they are literally right those guys feel they are right that's part of the plague that's part of what God has done because they receive not the love for the truth God gave them over to believe a lie and be damned by it that's the world we're living in but that's not you it's not who you are keep your garments clean can you say amen amen and that's going to take humility that's going to take a willingness to say hey messed up forgive me honey and then go to God and say God forgive me a well can you say Amen children have to go to Mama and daddies and say hey I'm sorry I'm sorry and then go to God and say hey I'm sorry you say what you have to do it just like that I'll just go to God I don't have to go to Mom and Dad no no no the Bible says leave your gift at the altar go make go make it right with the person that you have wronged and then come back and bring your lamb back to the altar so so what is he saying amen you've got to go get right what whoever you've done wrong you've got to make that right then come to the altar of God and say forgive me we're not going to hide anything humil says hey it's all right to go to Mom and say you know what I've been a doofus sorry and it's okay for momas to look at their sons and their daughters and say hey I got it wrong sorry but ultimately we want the blood of Jesus Christ we want and we want to stay beneath that stay behind that fortification listen folks it's going home time it's going home time don't don't don't get this illusion don't you allow your mind to go here and there it's time to go home yes yes yes it's time to go home amen there's a world where there is no sin there's a world and I want to tell you brother W do you believe in do you love transgenders yes I do but they've got to come to Jesus the same way that I came do I love homosexuals oh yes I do God loves every man and woman he loves that soul and he loved him so much that he come shed his blood so that we can be free does he does he love alcoholics and drug addicts yes he does Amen if I were to ask for a show of hands of the drug addicts and alcoholics and things that God's and and and and and those that have come from a such a rugged life amen had you to stand up and give a testimony it would probably take us two hours of what God has done for your life but you come to Jesus Christ you've accepted the blood of Jesus and God has changed you God will still take alcohol away from you God can still take the drug ad addictions away from you God can still take the lust Devils away from you they're Devils somebody say Devils amen you are filled with Devils that are hungering amen sin in your life but the Bible say if the Bible says there shall not be no drunkard make it to heaven then I want to be I want to be free if the Bible says there's no sin in heaven then let me be free the blood of that brother that comes from a solid foundation that is found in the Bible that is something that is real and genuine and you can Bank on it you can't Bank on what that preacher doctor of divinity is telling you what this one's telling you and that one's telling you that it's okay we all sin and we're all going to I don't care what you are you know what you just sin and you're just going to make it to Heaven that's not the way the Bible teaches it and we' better come back to the foundation of scripture amen Lord open my eyes is it isn't it funny that in or sad that in this day is is the day where Jesus had to offer IA says you're blind he told him he said now you think you say you're rich and you're increased with Goods but I say you're blind you're wretched you're naked but you know what he says come to me come to me I will give you isav so that you can see amen if the musicians would come amen I'll give you ISF Hallelujah does God love his people he loved us that he so much that he gave us the warning these scriptures that I read to you today have been written 2,000 years ago and do they apply today do you see how accurate and how real these scriptures [Music] are here here's the thing the Bible says when you think about it now the Beast we understand that the Beast was that I mean you [Music] it's it's that denominational church I mean we've gone through that over and over the Bible just puts it very plainly but if but if you look [Music] there at the at the 13th chapter and and and how that that he's going to make war against the the Saints and we I mean the Bible just tells us that one of the heads were wounded it was the Roman Empire we understand that's the fourth Empire that's where we're at and then amen out of that comes uh one of the deadly heads were were were revived and come back Rome came back as spiritual Rome Papa Rome and he is just and and and and it says I uh there in 13 and three Revelations I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death deadly womb was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast they worshiped the dragon that gave the power unto the Beast they worshiped the Beast saying who is like an the Beast who is able to make war with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given un him and and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God blaspheme his name his Tabernacle and them that dwell upon the Earth to make war with the Saints to overcome them and the power was given to him and and it says all that dwell the eth verse all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life the lamb slain from the foundation of the world lots of scriptures to point to and to we've gone through that many a time so I've used use a lot of just skimming over a lot of things [Music] today but make war how Satan would do that how Satan would and everyone's putting it as theid the Muslims so the Muslims are man they're making war and yes I understand but those same those same Devils that were released out of the Euphrates River it come under that Roman Empire that has come in to try to destroy the Jews and it's power Rome today that is that has taught the church to commit fornication [Music] adultery take away our fervency you can't love your girl with fervency and you're not Vigilant with your girl and your vows as long as you've got a couple of concubines on the side you you you're you're sharing your love between your girl and [Music] others so you've got to in order to keep your passion for her you got to deny all [Music] others you got to you you've got to you can't be flirting with this one and flirting with that one and flirting with this one your love has to be to your girl why did the bible say that the church would be a and she would have daughters that would be called [Music] harlots their love wasn't true to the one that they claimed to love [Music] so what we do real prayer takes us back to that what is prayer that's spending time with the guy that you claim the one that you claim to love what is prayer that's an Earnest desire to talk to the one who called you his [Music] bride and just know that there is every kind of a devil out there going to try to pull you away from loving your guy and I shouldn't say guy that's our Lord trying to keep you from loving Jesus lots of things that you can you can commit spiritual fornication on and adultery on by taking something else besides God's word for you can you say am man you love [Music] him what are you playing there brother Co me [Music] heart oh [Music] God and create a right Spirit Within Me [Music] oh create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right [Music]

you ask the Lord to forgive you why don't you just in real humility ask him Lord I'm not on fire for you like I should help [Music] me I entertain things in my mind that I shouldn't I do things I act ways I allow things in my life I hold grudges es forgive me Lord I want the power of your Holy Spirit in this Final hours I want to be on fire help me [Music] Lord only you can do that [Music] oh
