[25:21] waiting

[25:53] been.
[25:55] It's the end that's so [singing]
[25:59] important.
[26:01] I've just got [singing] to [music] make
[26:05] it in.
[26:10] Not [singing] the one
[26:16] who runs the swiftest,
[26:20] [music]
[26:23] nor the one
[26:26] [music]
[26:29] who [singing] shines for a day,
[26:34] [music]
[26:35] but [singing] it's the one
[26:40] [music]
[26:42] who endure
[26:46] till [singing and music] the end.
[26:50] He
[26:53] [music] He shall [singing] be saved.
[26:59] [music]
[27:01] [singing] And by God's grace,
[27:07] I know I'll [singing] make it

[27:37] till [music] the end. And [singing] by
[27:40] God's grace,
[27:45] [music]
[27:45] I [singing] shall be saved.
[27:51] [music]
[27:54] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[27:55] &gt;&gt; How many's going to make it?
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Only going to make it because he reached
[28:01] down his hand for me. He's guiding me.
[28:04] His word is a light into my path, a lamp
[28:06] under my feet. And

[30:21] for me.
[30:27] I was nearing [music and singing]
[30:31] despair

[30:36] to me there.
[30:39] And he showed
[30:41] me that I [singing]
[30:44] could be free.

[38:34] [music] name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:37] Can the church say amen?
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; And amen. Wonderful presence that we

[38:48] and um he never fails and I'm so
[38:52] thankful for [music] that. Here today,
[38:54] you can be seated. We've got a a special
[38:58] treat this morning. We're going to
[39:01] uh dedicate Oliver
[39:05] and uh if they want to come up then do
[39:08] we have somebody that would uh that can
[39:10] take [music]
[39:10] uh that that would want to film it and
[39:12] take picture. Uh you're welcome to do
[39:14] that. I don't know who
[39:18] But um um we we sure do love Brother
[39:22] Josh and Sister Loretta and their
[39:24] family.
[39:26] And [music] um
[39:28] you know um I think I I believe uh
[39:32] dedications
[39:33] is [music] is special. We've seen it
[39:35] throughout the scripture.
[39:37] And um Jesus would take the babies and
[39:40] [music] and um the children they would
[39:43] they would trying to push the kids away.
[39:45] And so this is an important time,
[39:47] [music] you know, keep the kids away.
[39:49] And Jesus said, "Suffer the little
[39:50] children to come to me
[39:52] &gt;&gt; and he took them in his arms and he
[39:54] blessed them."
[39:56] &gt;&gt; And [music]
[39:57] um we appreciate they are children are
[40:01] are blessing from the Lord. They're in
[40:04] [music] 1st Samuel
[40:06] 1 and 27. This is Hannah giving her
[40:10] child back to the Lord. It says, "For
[40:12] this child I prayed, and the Lord hath
[40:15] given me my petition, [music] which I
[40:17] asked of him. Therefore also I have lent
[40:21] him to the Lord as long as he lives,
[40:24] that [music] he may be lent to the Lord,
[40:27] and he worshiped the Lord there."
[40:31] And so [music]
[40:33] we're we're so thankful uh for
[40:37] Lucas Oliver [music] Martin. And um I'm
[40:43] going to wake him up here.
[40:48] Oh yeah.
[40:50] Amen.
[40:52] Isn't he a fine looking [music] fella?
[40:53] Look, look at this good looking fella
[40:55] right there. Hallelujah. [applause]
[41:02] And um
[41:05] we're we're just, you know, I I'm so
[41:08] thankful for [music] what this message
[41:10] has produced
[41:12] because this message has
[41:15] we if if we didn't have this anointing
[41:19] in this in [music] this last day, there
[41:20] is no telling where the family would be.
[41:24] But I'm so glad that there will be
[41:26] another another [music]
[41:27] generation if the Lord should terry
[41:29] because there's men and women who's
[41:32] really taking their their [music]
[41:33] position seriously
[41:36] and raising these children before the
[41:38] Lord. I I wonder [music] if we could
[41:40] just all pray, bow our heads and pray.
[41:44] Father,
[41:46] we want to [music] thank you
[41:48] for Lucas Oliver. Lord,
[41:52] we thank you for [music] this precious
[41:53] gift of life that you have
[41:56] given to Josh and Loretta.
[42:01] And Lord, we're [music] offering him
[42:04] back to you and knowing, Lord, that you
[42:07] have just lent them, lent him to us,
[42:10] [music]
[42:11] Lord, to raise and to hold and to love.
[42:16] And I pray Lord that this child would be
[42:19] raised
[42:21] in the atmosphere of divine love.
[42:25] And Lord may love direct his life.
[42:29] Lord from the cradle
[42:31] all the way to the time that you come.
[42:34] [music] I pray Lord that your anointing
[42:36] would be upon him and that you would
[42:40] bless him physically [music] and keep
[42:42] your hands upon him Lord. Lord, keep him
[42:46] from the the evils of the world and keep
[42:50] his spirit and his body and his soul,
[42:53] Lord, until the coming of the Lord
[42:56] Jesus.
[42:58] I pray, Father, that the angels of God
[43:00] would minister [music] to him and lead
[43:03] him to his divine call and [music] that
[43:06] you would keep him all the days of his
[43:08] life.
[43:10] Lord, I pray a special blessing upon
[43:13] Brother Josh and Sister Loretta
[43:16] that you would give them wisdom, Lord,
[43:18] as they [music]
[43:20] as they follow you and as they lead
[43:23] their family.
[43:25] And I I pray, Lord, in the times, Lord,
[43:27] of questions, in the times where there's
[43:30] [music] the fork in the road, and Lord,
[43:33] maybe there will be decisions that has
[43:35] to be made for Oliver. [music]
[43:38] But Lord, I I pray, Father, that you'll
[43:40] always hear their prayer. When mama gets
[43:43] a little bit weary and and she needs
[43:46] some help from you, Lord, and she's
[43:48] asking, I [music] I pray, Lord, that you
[43:51] would send the angels all around her and
[43:53] that you would lift her up, that you
[43:55] would bless her, that you would bless,
[43:58] Lord, the family, and may this unit be
[44:04] uh so bound together, Lord, by your
[44:08] divine love that nothing would ever be
[44:10] able to come in, no woof
[44:12] &gt;&gt; [music]
[44:13] &gt;&gt; bearer demon. But father, may the
[44:16] blessings of God be upon them. Father,
[44:20] we thank you for it. We [music] thank
[44:22] you. We give Oliver to you now.

[45:16] [music] the Lord. Well, if you have your
[45:18] uh scriptures, you can you can stand to
[45:20] your feet and and um in honor to the
[45:23] word.
[45:26] [snorts] And uh well this morning uh
[45:28] brother brother brother brother Daniel
[45:29] Black was supposed to be preaching to
[45:31] you and uh uh the rain sort of hindered
[45:37] things here and so and we just want to
[45:40] say right off the bat sister Leah we are
[45:42] so sorry about those caramel apples. Now
[45:45] the thing is sister Leah she she talked
[45:48] to me personally in person on Thursday.
[45:51] She said, "Now, Brother Wendell, are we
[45:53] [snorts] going to be have it? I really,
[45:55] this is going to be a lot of work." And
[45:57] and um so it uh are we going to Is there
[46:02] a chance that we're not going to have
[46:04] it? And I said, "Sis, we are going to
[46:07] have that." And u uh hallelujah.
[46:12] Well, she made those caramel apples and
[46:14] and and
[46:16] we're not having it this weekend, but I
[46:18] did read the text that there are some
[46:20] caramel apples after church. Amen.
[46:22] [laughter]
[46:23] So, so for those ladies who have been
[46:26] working, uh you know, maybe you had some
[46:28] soups ready. Amen. Freeze them and I
[46:31] don't know. Amen. But uh we're just we
[46:34] we are looking forward two weeks from
[46:36] today uh we will be we're going to try
[46:38] that fall fellowship again and um we
[46:41] will see how that goes. Let's look here
[46:43] in 2 Corinthians 4 and6
[46:47] and um
[46:51] we're thankful to the Lord for his word.
[46:54] It says, "For God who commanded the
[46:56] light to shine out of darkness hath
[46:58] shined in our hearts to give the light
[47:01] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[47:04] the face of Jesus Christ."
[47:07] But we have this treasure in earth and
[47:09] vessels. And that's where my title is
[47:11] going to be this morning. Treasure in
[47:13] earth and vessels. That the excellency
[47:15] of the power may be of God and not of
[47:17] us. We are troubled on every side yet
[47:20] not distressed. We are perplexed but not
[47:22] in despair.
[47:24] persecuted but not forsaken, cast down
[47:27] but not destroyed, always bearing about
[47:30] in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,
[47:33] that the life also of Jesus might be
[47:35] made manifest in our body. For we which
[47:38] live are always delivered unto death for
[47:40] Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus
[47:44] might be made manifest
[47:46] in our mortal bodies. This is an
[47:49] incredible thing. the life of Jesus
[47:53] would be made manifest in our mortal
[47:56] bodies. I'd also like to look here in in
[47:58] First John 2 and 18
[48:04] and um then we'll let you have your
[48:06] seats.
[48:07] [clears throat]
[48:11] Uh 1 John 2:18. Little children,
[48:15] it is the last time as ye have heard
[48:18] that Antichrist shall come, even now
[48:21] there are many Antichrist, whereby we
[48:25] know that it is the last time. They went
[48:28] out from us, but they were not of us.
[48:32] For had they been of us, they would no
[48:35] doubt have continued with us. But they
[48:39] went out that they might be manifested
[48:42] that they were not of us.
[48:44] But you have an uncction from the Holy
[48:48] One, and you know all things. Aren't you
[48:52] glad for the uncction of the Holy One. I
[48:55] have not written unto you because you
[48:57] know not the truth, but because you know
[49:01] it, and that no lie is of the truth.
[49:06] Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father,
[49:09] we want to thank you today for your for
[49:12] your word of promise. We thank you,
[49:15] Lord, for this great anointing that is
[49:17] upon the earth today. And I pray, Lord,
[49:21] that your words of life would just that
[49:24] that they would become life to every one
[49:27] of us as we sit in your presence this
[49:29] morning. Help us, Lord. Help me to speak
[49:33] what you would have me to say Lord. Help
[49:36] me Lord remove every hindrance out of
[49:39] the way. And I also ask Lord that you
[49:42] would remove every hindrance from our
[49:43] hearing. And we'll give you glory and
[49:46] honor in Jesus name we pray. Can the
[49:50] church say amen?
[49:52] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be
[49:54] seated here today.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[49:57] &gt;&gt; So
[49:59] we we are looking here
[50:02] treasures in earthn vessels
[50:05] and um
[50:08] uh we we think as we look at this
[50:12] treasure
[50:14] we we know that we're in the last church
[50:16] age and that as as the last church age
[50:21] um there
[50:24] we're in the finality. This is the
[50:26] rapturing age.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the
[50:31] going to talk on the term of the
[50:33] anointing of uh anointing today for a
[50:38] few moments because brother Brandham
[50:41] says there is a rapture anointing here
[50:44] on on the earth. There is Amen. The
[50:47] mighty angel has come with that open
[50:49] book. That is the title deed. Amen. that
[50:52] mighty angel is the anointing upon the
[50:56] word to open that word to us.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; And when we think about the anointing, I
[51:03] think, amen, we in um our western
[51:06] culture, we use it very loosely today.
[51:10] uh uh uh we we we use the Pentecostals
[51:14] use the word uh uh anointed, you know,
[51:17] and sometimes we can say uh boy, that
[51:20] was an anointed preacher or that was an
[51:23] anointed song and and we talk about the
[51:25] anointing in in a in a loose way.
[51:31] But when you think about the anointed,
[51:34] you know, the the just because the
[51:37] preacher is a good ortor and maybe he
[51:40] has a great ability to study, that
[51:42] doesn't mean he's anointed.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. He may be able to place history
[51:47] and stories together and Amen. in such a
[51:50] way as to inspire. He may have great
[51:53] talent. Amen. And and lack and lack
[51:57] anointing. Zero anointing.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. There are singers who can who can
[52:01] belt out the lyrics and can can move a
[52:04] crowd. They can really sing.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that they are
[52:08] anointed.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; You see, we we we can we can uh uh see a
[52:15] lot of we we use that term in Pentecost.
[52:18] It's just constantly used. Amen. But you
[52:22] see anointed there there is a real
[52:26] anointing. So when we talk about the
[52:30] anointing,
[52:31] Amen. It it it is uh it it's a Hebrew
[52:35] term and and first of all the term was
[52:38] not used by only by Jews only. It was
[52:41] used by by pagans. Um uh most most all
[52:46] of of the pagans uh used the word the
[52:50] term anoint and they would they the word
[52:53] anoint means to rub or smear or paint
[52:57] oil uh on an object. Amen. And um it was
[53:02] to uh set that object aside and and they
[53:05] would consecrate it and um uh for a for
[53:09] a divine purpose and then they would
[53:12] worship that that uh object that idol or
[53:16] that that whatever. And so amen, another
[53:20] word was to pour out. Amen. to uh to to
[53:26] as a consecration to the priest where
[53:29] they would pour oil upon upon the
[53:32] priest. And um and again, it was to set
[53:36] that object aside or set that priest
[53:38] aside. And they would they would put it
[53:41] on like they were Amen. They would put
[53:43] it on uh uh oil upon the altars. They
[53:47] would put oil even in the on the
[53:49] tabernacle. And so with as we talk about
[53:53] the anointing here this morning, I want
[53:55] us to to get away maybe from the
[53:58] Pentecostal term of anointing because
[54:01] today we we have we have sort of made
[54:04] the anointing as if it is uh a good
[54:07] feeling. Amen. A good feeling in the
[54:09] church service or uh you or you know you
[54:13] you pray and you're anointed.
[54:17] But but the the the term anointing, I
[54:20] want us to go just a a little deeper.
[54:24] And as we as we look there in the in the
[54:27] Old Testament, Amen. Uh the earliest
[54:30] biblical use of of the term was when
[54:33] Jacob uh Jacob had anointed a stone. He
[54:37] he had laid his weary head on on a stone
[54:41] and amen had fallen asleep and and after
[54:44] which God gave him a dream and and the
[54:47] dream amen angels ascending and
[54:49] descending and God confirming the
[54:52] covenant with him and and and when he
[54:54] woke up he said this is holy ground.
[54:57] This is this is sacred ground. So he
[55:01] took the stone and he set it up as a
[55:03] pillar. Amen. and and he anointed or he
[55:08] smeared some oil upon that and he
[55:12] consecrated it and he later come back
[55:15] and he and and and and he called the
[55:17] place Bethl, the house of God. Amen. and
[55:22] and uh and and so the the Bible says
[55:25] there in Genesis 28:18, "And Jacob rose
[55:28] up early in the morning and he took the
[55:30] stone that he had put for his pillows
[55:33] and he set it up for a pillar and he
[55:35] poured the oil up on top of it. He was
[55:39] consecrating it or setting it aside."
[55:42] Amen. As a place that and God would
[55:45] honor that. God honored what he had done
[55:49] as he placed the oil upon it. Little
[55:52] later on, we we find that God instructed
[55:55] Moses, Amen, to take uh to take an oil
[55:59] and to prepare it. And there were
[56:01] certain spices and certain things that
[56:03] they were to to put upon it. AND THEY
[56:06] WOULD CONSECRATE THIS oil to the Lord.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It would be a sweet smelling
[56:12] incense unto the Lord. In Exodus 25 and6
[56:16] it says oil for the light and spices for
[56:20] anointing oil and for sweet incense. And
[56:23] so here here the anointing. Amen. It was
[56:27] now not upon a rock that was found but
[56:31] now God is instructing him to to take
[56:36] this specially prepared oil and and to
[56:40] set aside amen. the altar to set aside
[56:45] the the the tabernacle. Amen. For a
[56:48] place of worship. AND THEN GOD WOULD
[56:51] COME DOWN upon those sacred grounds and
[56:55] he would anoint. Amen. He would anoint
[56:59] that. He would he would uh his presence
[57:03] would come down upon that that was
[57:06] anointed. AMEN. SO GOD WAS placing a
[57:10] significant purpose upon this anointing.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He would use this term again. He
[57:18] was using a term that they were all very
[57:21] familiar with even in the Amen. uh in
[57:24] the pagan worship. But but he was using
[57:27] this term to express a much more divine
[57:32] meaning AND PURPOSE BECAUSE THEN GOD
[57:36] TOLD HIM, HE SAYS, "NOW I WANT YOU TO
[57:38] TAKE THIS OIL." He was going a little
[57:40] bit further. I want you to take this oil
[57:43] and I I want you to consecrate. Amen.
[57:48] Anoint the priest. I want you to take
[57:51] these these men, these certain men that
[57:54] I have chosen out of your out of your
[57:57] tribes, and I these MEN I HAVE SET aside
[58:01] and I WANT YOU TO POUR THE OIL UPON THEM
[58:05] FOR THEIR priestly roles. AMEN. AND AND
[58:09] THAT ANOINTING, AMEN. THAT THEY WILL BE
[58:12] SET ASIDE FOR MY GLORY TO COME UPON THEM
[58:17] AND I WILL USE them for my divine
[58:20] purpose. Amen. Exodus 30 and30. AND THOU
[58:23] SHALT ANOINT Aaron and his sons and
[58:27] consecrate them that they may be they
[58:30] may minister
[58:32] unto me in the priest's office. Amen.
[58:35] And so uh uh they they they they would
[58:39] use it. IT WAS GOD TAKING THIS this word
[58:44] anointing and he was it was IT WAS
[58:48] BRINGING GOD DOWN OUT OF THE THE THE the
[58:52] heavenly realm into the earthly realm.
[58:55] THEY WERE SET ASIDE FOR GOD'S GLORY,
[58:59] God's spirit to come here upon the
[59:02] earth.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you know we we we understand
[59:07] that uh that even Samuel and and I just
[59:11] want to go through this for a few
[59:13] moments here. Amen. When when God wanted
[59:16] to anoint uh David to be king, HE TOOK
[59:20] THE PROPHET SAMUEL. AMEN. AND INSTRUCTED
[59:23] HIM TO TAKE THE HORN of oil. Amen. And
[59:27] he was to anoint David to be the king.
[59:30] Amen. David uh was eternally a man after
[59:34] God's OWN HEART. AMEN. GOD had thought
[59:37] of DAVID FOR AMEN. GOD HAD A PURPOSE FOR
[59:40] DAVID. NOW, DAVID WAS in the sheep in in
[59:43] in in the you know, taking care of the
[59:46] sheep there in the pasture. Amen. David
[59:49] might not have known that that he was
[59:51] going to be a king. Maybe he didn't feel
[59:52] like he was a kingly type of guy, but
[59:56] yet he was forever in the MIND OF GOD.
[1:00:00] GOD HAD DETERMINED THAT David was going
[1:00:04] to be a king,
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; And that the lineage through his
[1:00:08] lineage, THE MESSIAH WOULD COME AS THE
[1:00:11] REDEEMER. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, DAVID WAS ETERNALLY a man
[1:00:16] after God's own heart. Amen. Brother
[1:00:19] Brandham says it was inevitably uh a
[1:00:22] wrote in in heaven by the blood of
[1:00:25] Jesus. Amen. There was nothing THAT
[1:00:27] COULD CHANGE THAT UH THAT ANOINTING AS
[1:00:31] SO AS AS AS HE COME. AMEN. Here here
[1:00:35] come here here comes Samuel with the the
[1:00:37] horn of oil and and he comes to THE
[1:00:40] HOUSE OF JESSE BECAUSE GOD HAD CHOSEN
[1:00:43] Samuel to be his representative. Amen.
[1:00:46] You take that as the prophet. You take
[1:00:48] that oil and you go down because you're
[1:00:51] going to anoint a son OF JESSE. NOW THE
[1:00:54] BIBLE SAYS THAT THERE were the son after
[1:00:57] son come through. And Samuel, Amen, EVEN
[1:01:01] AS A PROPHET OF GOD, HE HE LOOKED AT
[1:01:04] these at these men. They were strong in
[1:01:07] stature. They were good to look upon.
[1:01:09] They were Amen. And and and and he would
[1:01:12] stand there and say, "This must be the
[1:01:14] man that you have that you have called
[1:01:17] to be anointed." But God would say, "No,
[1:01:20] that's not the man."
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. uh uh uh uh MAN AFTER MAN, BOY
[1:01:25] AFTER BOY WENT through and until there
[1:01:28] there was no more. And Samuel left and
[1:01:30] said, "Do you have anyone else?" Amen.
[1:01:34] There's got to HAVE ANOTHER SON. AND HE
[1:01:36] SAYS, "YES, I'VE GOT A SON." HE'S OUT
[1:01:38] TAKING care of the sheep. He's just a
[1:01:40] He's just a lad. Amen. He's not really
[1:01:43] good for much of of of strong things cuz
[1:01:46] he's just Amen. He He's not He's not a
[1:01:49] real strong fella. and and and and and
[1:01:52] THE THE THE PROPHET SAMUEL SAYS, "FETCH
[1:01:55] HIM FROM THE FIELD." He says, "For I
[1:01:57] will not set down until he comes."
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Now, this was this
[1:02:05] was the THE PROPHET FIXING TO POUR THE
[1:02:10] ANOINTING UPON THE future king.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; THIS WAS THE PROPHET. GOD HAD INSTRUCTED
[1:02:17] HIM TO COME. AMEN. and to and to UH
[1:02:22] VALIDATE THE CALL THAT WAS ALREADY UPON
[1:02:25] HIS LIFE.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; And and so uh we we find out that this
[1:02:30] that that that he come and and uh Amen.
[1:02:34] And immediately there he knew. And the
[1:02:37] Bible says there in 1st Samuel 16:13,
[1:02:40] "Then Samuel took the horn of oil and
[1:02:43] anointed him in the midst of his
[1:02:45] brethren, and the spirit of the LORD
[1:02:49] COME UPON DAVID FROM THAT day forward."
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can see when that anointing
[1:02:57] come, AMEN. THAT THAT ANOINTING NOW NOW
[1:03:01] IT WASN'T THE OIL NECESSARILY BUT IT WAS
[1:03:05] GOD SENDING THE REPRESENTATIVE to anoint
[1:03:10] the word that was for that day
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; now he could have he could have poured
[1:03:16] he could have poured that oil amen on
[1:03:18] every one of those boys and it wouldn't
[1:03:20] have done any good
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; he could have poured THE OIL SO IT
[1:03:23] WASN'T IT WASN'T REALLY THE OIL BUT IT
[1:03:27] WAS THE EARTHLY AMEN AGREEMENT WITH WHAT
[1:03:31] GOD HAD. WELL, I WANT TO TELL YOU HERE
[1:03:33] TODAY, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT the
[1:03:36] anointing that has come in every one of
[1:03:39] those church ages. GOD WOULD SEND A
[1:03:41] MESSENGER TO ANOINT THAT CHURCH AGE WITH
[1:03:46] THE WORD. AND THE ELECT and the elect
[1:03:49] only were the ones that were going to
[1:03:51] hear that word.
[1:03:54] I I WANT YOU TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.
[1:03:56] I'M GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF, BUT I WANT
[1:03:57] YOU TO THINK THE BIBLE SAYS, AMEN, THAT
[1:04:00] THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD I WILL POUR
[1:04:03] OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; But that does not mean that all flesh is
[1:04:09] going to accept it. Amen. THAT ARE Y'ALL
[1:04:12] UNDERSTANDING. BUT IT'S THE WORD THAT
[1:04:15] THE ANOINTING OF THE PROPHET THAT HAS
[1:04:18] COME TO THE ELECT THAT IS WHAT energizes
[1:04:22] and brings you into that reality. Well,
[1:04:25] can you say amen?
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now brother uh uh brother
[1:04:29] Brandham would say David was called by
[1:04:31] election. He was elected. Called
[1:04:34] anointed placed elected by God. Called
[1:04:37] from the sheep heard him to be the king.
[1:04:39] Anointed positionally placed. Look,
[1:04:42] Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.
[1:04:45] Abraham, election, Isaac, justification,
[1:04:48] Jacob, grace, Joseph, perfection.
[1:04:50] Nothing against Joseph. All right, there
[1:04:52] you are. See, are you a David? Are you
[1:04:55] CALLED ELECTED FIRST BY GOD? HOW MANY
[1:04:58] CHRISTIANS here can raise your hand? If
[1:05:00] you're not a Christian, you're you're uh
[1:05:02] by your your desire. Or he says, you're
[1:05:04] not a Christian by your desire. YOU'RE A
[1:05:07] CHRISTIAN BY GOD'S DESIRE. GOD DESIRED
[1:05:11] YOU TO BE A CHRISTIAN. AND YOU'RE NOT A
[1:05:14] CHRISTIAN BECAUSE YOU HAVE ABILITY. IT'S
[1:05:16] BECAUSE THERE IS ANOINTING UPON YOU TO
[1:05:19] be a Christian. Amen. That's exactly
[1:05:21] right. HE SAYS, "NO man can come to me
[1:05:24] except my father draw him first. YOU WAS
[1:05:26] ELECTED BY GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF
[1:05:28] THE WORLD TO BE A CHRISTIAN." THAT'S
[1:05:30] SCRIPTURE. Jesus said, "No man can come
[1:05:33] except my father calls him." First thing
[1:05:36] you was elected and called. When God
[1:05:38] elected you, then he called you and you
[1:05:41] heeded to his call. Then he poured the
[1:05:44] anointing oil on you, the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:46] AMEN. WHAT DOES THAT OIL REPRESENT IN
[1:05:48] THE BIBLE? THIS THE HOLY SPIRIT. WHEN he
[1:05:51] poured OIL UPON HIM, HE BAPTIZED him
[1:05:53] with the spirit. Amen. In the symbol
[1:05:55] form.
[1:05:57] NOW HE WOULD GO ON DOWN. HE SAYS THERE
[1:05:59] HE WAS. AMEN. ELECTED, CALLED, ANOINTED,
[1:06:05] and positionally
[1:06:07] already king.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORD COME TO HIM AND THAT
[1:06:12] ANOINTING OIL WAS PLACED UPON HIM, HE
[1:06:15] WAS ALREADY,
[1:06:18] AMEN, a king. Now, it was going to be
[1:06:20] many years before he would become a
[1:06:22] before he'd become the king, but the
[1:06:24] anointing oil was upon him. And then
[1:06:27] brother Brandham would say, "Amen, the
[1:06:29] the scripture, those who he has called,
[1:06:32] he has justified and who is justified,
[1:06:34] he's also glorified." AMEN. IN THE
[1:06:37] PRESENCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD, your names
[1:06:41] indelibly wrote with the blood of Jesus
[1:06:44] Christ. You're glorified in his
[1:06:47] presence, POSITIONALLY PLACED here on
[1:06:49] earth for a purpose to do the will of
[1:06:53] God. DO YOU SEE YOUR POSITION,
[1:06:55] CHRISTIAN? THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS ASKING.
[1:06:57] CHRISTIAN, DO YOU SEE YOUR POSITION?
[1:07:00] WELL, PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; SO, SAMUEL WAS THE representative of
[1:07:05] God. Amen. HE HE HAD GONE BY COMMISSION.
[1:07:09] AMEN. HE HE WAS CALLED OF GOD. HE SAID,
[1:07:12] "I WANT YOU TO GO TO A CERTAIN TRIBE and
[1:07:15] a and a certain people, TO A CERTAIN
[1:07:18] HOUSEHOLD." AND HE WAS GUIDED BY GOD'S
[1:07:22] GREAT AMEN. UH UH UH BY THE GREAT GOD
[1:07:25] WHO COMMISSIONED HIM. AMEN. TO A CERTAIN
[1:07:28] BOY WITH A CERTAIN SEED WITHIN HIM
[1:07:32] BECAUSE THAT BOY WAS CHOSEN TO BE KING.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; WELL, bless the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:07:40] HE HAD A DIVINE PURPOSE. THAT PROPHET
[1:07:43] HAD A DIVINE PURPOSE TO LOOK OUT
[1:07:46] [screaming] THAT KING. TO LOOK OUT Oh
[1:07:49] my. He didn't look like a king. He was a
[1:07:52] LITTLE BOY WITH A WITH A SLINGSHOT. HE
[1:07:54] didn't look like He didn't FEEL LIKE A
[1:07:55] KING. AMEN. HE WAS HE WAS OUT IN THE
[1:07:58] PASTURE WHILE WHILE WHILE WHILE THE THE
[1:08:00] OTHER MEN WERE WERE WERE THEIR FATHER'S
[1:08:03] TREASURE. YOU UNDERSTANDING WHAT I'M
[1:08:05] SAYING? BUT THE PROPHET HAD A DIVINE
[1:08:08] COMMISSION. AND I SAY TODAY, THE
[1:08:11] PROPHETS GOT A DIVINE COMMISSION TODAY.
[1:08:13] AMEN. TO LOOK OUT THOSE ELECT OF GOD
[1:08:17] [screaming] THAT IS ORDAINED FOR
[1:08:18] RAPTURE. [applause]
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. That's right. HALLELUJAH. SO
[1:08:24] SAMUEL WAS GOD'S REPRESENTATIVE. SAMUEL
[1:08:27] POURED THE OIL ON DAVID. AMEN. HE POURED
[1:08:31] THE OIL ON DAVID AND GOD POURED THE oil
[1:08:34] and then God poured the oil. God poured
[1:08:37] the anointing. IT WAS HIM in a natural
[1:08:40] form, but it was GLORY TO GOD.
[1:08:44] DAVID [screaming] DIDN'T
[1:08:46] SAMUEL DID NOT MAKE SAM UH DAVID A KING.
[1:08:50] [screaming] SAMUEL COULD NOT MAKE DAVID
[1:08:53] A KING. SAMUEL FOLLOWED THE COMMISSION.
[1:08:57] AMEN. TO POUR THE OIL UPON THE ELECTED
[1:09:02] SEED OF [screaming] GOD. WELL, PRAISE
[1:09:04] THE NAME OF THE LORD. I WANT TO SAY THIS
[1:09:06] MESSAGE. AMEN. THE PROPHET DOES NOT MAKE
[1:09:09] YOU ELECT. THE PROPHET DOES NOT MAKE YOU
[1:09:11] A BRIDE MEMBER. AMEN. YOU DO NOT MAKE
[1:09:13] YOURSELF A BRIDE MEMBER. BUT I WANT TO
[1:09:16] TELL YOU, AMEN. GOD SENT HIS WORD IN
[1:09:18] THIS DAY TO POUR THE OIL UPON THE ELECT
[1:09:22] OF GOD BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS written in
[1:09:26] the lamb's book of life.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen?
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, David didn't feel it and
[1:09:36] Amen. But but I just want to tell you it
[1:09:38] never could leave him. The prophet says,
[1:09:40] "The anointing come upon David and it
[1:09:43] never left him."
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Someone say, "The anointing anointing
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; comes upon the bride."
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; And it never leaves you.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; It never leaves you.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; You see, we think THE ANOINTING IS SOME
[1:09:58] KIND OF A FEELING, something that's
[1:10:00] going to MAKE YOU SHOUT, SOMETHING
[1:10:02] THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU IT. THE
[1:10:03] ANOINTING IS WHAT IS DRAWING THE GIFT OF
[1:10:07] GOD OUT OF [screaming] YOUR LIFE.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. Brother Brandon would say,
[1:10:13] "Scott sometimes takes his people out
[1:10:15] like that and shaves a few of their own
[1:10:18] wheels off and shows them that they that
[1:10:21] they can't do just what they want to
[1:10:23] do." You know what I mean? Amen. They're
[1:10:25] not in liberty to do what they want to
[1:10:27] do because they could come INTO FULL
[1:10:30] POWER AND BE A LOVE SLAVE OR BE FOREIGN.
[1:10:32] THEY COULD COME INTO full power and be a
[1:10:34] love slave TO CHRIST. THEY HAVE TO BE
[1:10:37] SHAVED OFF AND THEN PRESENTED. SOMETIMES
[1:10:40] IT TAKES HIM, it takes them to the
[1:10:42] desert to do that and to shave THEM OFF
[1:10:45] AND AND then bring THEM OUT, THE
[1:10:47] ANOINTED ONE TO FULFILL THE PURPOSE THAT
[1:10:51] HE'S ORDAINED THEM TO BE. AMEN. AND HE
[1:10:54] SAYS, YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? AND BRETHREN,
[1:10:56] WE'RE AT THE END. SO HE'S SO HE'S HE'S
[1:10:59] LETTING US KNOW. HE BRINGS THEM OUT.
[1:11:01] THEN HE STOPS. WHO'S THIS THEM THAT
[1:11:03] THEY'RE BRINGING OUT? THE ANOINTED ONES
[1:11:07] BRINGS THEM OUT. THE ANOINTED ONE TO
[1:11:10] FULFILL THE [screaming] PURPOSE that
[1:11:12] he's ordained them to be.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Now, after the anointing COME UPON
[1:11:16] DAVID, AMEN. THE ANOINTING COME UPON
[1:11:20] DAVID. HOW MANY HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT
[1:11:21] TO BE THE TRUTH?
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; But now here, he's going TO GO THROUGH
[1:11:25] THE TESTINGS AND THE TRIALS AND HE'S
[1:11:27] GOING TO LIVE IN CAVES AND HE'S GOING TO
[1:11:29] BE HUNTED LIKE AMEN.
[1:11:31] LIKE AN ANIMAL. BUT YOU SEE, THAT DID
[1:11:33] NOT CHANGE [screaming] THE FACT GOD HAD
[1:11:35] ALREADY PLACED HIS ANOINTING UPON HIM.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; And that anointing was going TO KEEP
[1:11:40] HIM. THAT ANOINTING WAS GOING TO TAKE
[1:11:42] HIM FROM THE CAVE AND BRING HIM INTO THE
[1:11:45] PALACE. THE ANOINTING WAS GOING TO PLACE
[1:11:49] [screaming] HIM WHERE HE BELONGED.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; NOW, that anointing today is to place
[1:11:58] you. It's to position you. Amen. To
[1:12:03] position YOU. HE WAS ALL AT THAT MOMENT,
[1:12:06] he was already positionally a king,
[1:12:10] though it would be another 20 years
[1:12:12] before he sat on the throne.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's that special Amen. That
[1:12:20] that's that something special that had
[1:12:22] separated you. That anointing separates
[1:12:25] you to himself. Amen. the I I as I was
[1:12:29] looking as I was thinking I came out of
[1:12:31] Pentecost and and and we we term the
[1:12:36] anointing. Amen. We put the anointing
[1:12:38] with the feelings and the emotions. We
[1:12:41] we we we put Amen. When we felt a good
[1:12:45] service, amen, when we were on a high,
[1:12:48] we we connected that with the anointing.
[1:12:51] Amen. or when we when we spent time in
[1:12:54] prayer AND IT WAS A GOOD prayer meeting
[1:12:56] and the and we could JUST FEEL THE
[1:12:58] PRESENCE OF THE LORD, WE WOULD CALL THAT
[1:13:00] THE ANOINTING. AND I WILL SAY, AMEN, THE
[1:13:03] BLESSINGS OF GOD ARE WONDERFUL, BUT THE
[1:13:06] ANOINTING OF GOD, AMEN, IS NOT AN
[1:13:09] EMOTION. THE ANOINTING. NOT THAT YOUR
[1:13:12] EMOTIONS DO NOT GET AROUSED WHEN THE
[1:13:14] ANOINTING uh uh when when the uh when
[1:13:17] the anointing IS HERE, BUT WHAT WE ARE
[1:13:19] LOOKING AT, we're looking at the
[1:13:22] anointing or the the the THE PLACING OF
[1:13:28] GOD'S HAND UPON YOUR LIFE.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, now the in the Hebrews, I as
[1:13:36] I was looking, Amen. in in this
[1:13:39] anointing and and there in the in the in
[1:13:43] the lexicon, it it talks about among the
[1:13:45] Hebrews, it it was believed not only
[1:13:48] that it affected a transference to the
[1:13:51] anointed one of something of holiness
[1:13:54] and virtue of deity and whose name and
[1:13:58] by whose representative the the right or
[1:14:00] the act was performed, but also that IT
[1:14:04] IMPARTED A SPECIAL ENDOWMENT of the
[1:14:07] spirit spirit of God. Amen. So, so it
[1:14:10] was it was not just
[1:14:14] an oil or a smearing or a pouring. Amen.
[1:14:18] IT WAS ACTUALLY GOD COMING. AMEN. And
[1:14:22] sanctioning it. IT WAS IT WAS GOD
[1:14:25] SENDING THE MESSENGER. IT WAS GOD
[1:14:28] ORDAINING THE MESSENGER TO ANOINT. AND
[1:14:31] THEN GOD HIMSELF WOULD COME UPON
[1:14:35] [screaming] THAT PERSON TO ANOINT THEM.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; YEAH. RIGHT.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE GOD'S GREAT BLESSINGS, HIS
[1:14:41] HIS AUTHORITY, HIS HIS presence with
[1:14:44] them.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's that's the what?
[1:14:49] Amen. We could see that all through the
[1:14:51] scripture uh with this anointing. Now,
[1:14:53] Amen. that we also find that that that
[1:14:57] with this anointing also, Amen. uh uh
[1:15:00] become synonymous with the king. They
[1:15:02] would anoint the king. They they would
[1:15:06] take the oil. Any king that would come
[1:15:07] in Israel, they would anoint that king.
[1:15:10] And and it and just as the priest and
[1:15:12] and so it would become synonymous. David
[1:15:16] was that anointed king. Well, praise the
[1:15:19] Lord. Jesus, the son of David, was the
[1:15:22] anointed king. They were expecting him
[1:15:24] to be the king of the Jews.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were they were asking him
[1:15:29] when when are YOU GOING TO SET UP YOUR
[1:15:31] KINGDOM? BUT HE SAYS MY KINGDOM IS NOT
[1:15:34] OF THE JEWS. [screaming]
[1:15:35] MY KINGDOM IS OF AN ELECT. AMEN. IT'S
[1:15:39] THE SPIRITUAL ROYAL SEED of Abraham.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's not coming back to rule over
[1:15:45] the Jews. He's coming. He's come He's
[1:15:47] the king of saints.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; He's the king of the elect. Well, praise
[1:15:52] the Lord.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN JESUS COME AND HE SAYS THE
[1:15:57] ANOINTING OF THE LORD GOD, THE SPIRIT OF
[1:16:01] THE LORD GOD IS UPON ME BECAUSE HE HAS
[1:16:05] ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL. WHAT
[1:16:10] WHAT WAS HE SAYING? THERE IS A
[1:16:12] TRANSFERENCE. THERE IS AN ANOINTING
[1:16:15] UPON [screaming] THIS ONE to to
[1:16:19] liberate. AMEN. HIS WORDS. AS HE
[1:16:22] PREACHED THE WORD, THE ANOINTING WOULD
[1:16:26] COME UPON THAT ELECT and bring the
[1:16:29] desired results that God had.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. He hath anointed
[1:16:38] me to preach the gospel to the poor. He
[1:16:40] hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
[1:16:43] to preach deliverance to the captive,
[1:16:45] and the recovering of sight to the
[1:16:47] blind, and to set at liberty them that
[1:16:49] are bruised, to preach the acceptable
[1:16:52] year of the Lord. Oh, can you say amen?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN WHEN JESUS SO, WHAT WAS HE?
[1:16:57] JESUS WAS GOD'S REPRESENTATIVE. AMEN.
[1:17:01] The the the the Old Testament says,
[1:17:03] "This is my servant that I have sent TO
[1:17:07] THE HOUSE OF JESSE." MY SERVANT THAT I
[1:17:10] HAVE SENT TO THE HOUSE OF JACOB. AMEN.
[1:17:12] SO WHAT WHAT IS HE HE WAS SAYING? HE WAS
[1:17:15] anointed to BRING THE DELIVERANCE. HOW
[1:17:19] WAS HE TO BRING THE DELIVERANCE? AMEN.
[1:17:21] HE WOULD POUR [screaming]
[1:17:22] HE WOULD HE WOULD PREACH the gospel. HE
[1:17:26] WOULD PRE WELL, PRAISE the Lord. So
[1:17:28] there was Zakius standing up in the
[1:17:30] middle of sitting up in the tree, the
[1:17:31] elect of God. And he was a bad man. He
[1:17:34] was a crook. Amen. Worked for the
[1:17:36] government. And uh uh and there he there
[1:17:39] he was. He and and and Jesus looked up
[1:17:42] at him and he says, "Zakius, come down
[1:17:44] out of that tree." Amen. For I'm going
[1:17:46] home to eat with you today.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going home to eat with you today.
[1:17:51] And we and we pick it up there in Luke
[1:17:53] uh 19:7. AND WHEN THEY SAW IT, THEY ALL
[1:17:56] MURMURED, saying that he was going to be
[1:17:59] guest with a man that is a sinner. AND
[1:18:01] ZAKIUS STOOD AND SAID UNTO THE LORD,
[1:18:04] "BEHOLD, LORD, the half of my goods I
[1:18:06] give to the poor. If I have taken
[1:18:08] anything uh uh from from any man by
[1:18:11] false accusation, I'll restore uh
[1:18:13] four-fold." And Jesus said, "This day
[1:18:16] salvation UH IS SALVATION COME TO THIS
[1:18:20] HOUSE, for as MUCH AS HE ALSO IS A SON
[1:18:24] OF ABRAHAM. FOR THE SON OF MAN IS COME
[1:18:28] TO SEEK AND SAVE THEM WHICH WERE LOST.
[1:18:32] JESUS SAYS, I COME, AMEN, NOT TO DO MY
[1:18:35] WILL, BUT I AM LOOKING FOR GOD'S ELECT.
[1:18:38] [screaming]
[1:18:39] ALL THAT THE FATHER HATH GIVEN ME WILL
[1:18:42] COME. WHAT IS HE DOING? HE WAS there
[1:18:44] pouring God's anointing oil
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; upon Well, you praise the Lord. You're
[1:18:50] saying now what what what do you mean
[1:18:52] God's anointing oil? Amen. The Bible
[1:18:54] says that that his doctrine shall fall
[1:18:58] like rain. Amen. The anointings the as
[1:19:01] the dew. Amen. It shall come. God's word
[1:19:05] will would there would come a time where
[1:19:07] God's word would reach the elect. And as
[1:19:10] he is STANDING THERE PREACHING THE
[1:19:12] GOSPEL. IT IS GOD'S ANOINTING TO GOD'S
[1:19:15] ELECT. AMEN. It would IT WOULD IT WOULD
[1:19:19] CAUSE IT WOULD CAUSE THAT PREDESTINATED
[1:19:21] SEED TO COME INTO ACTION. THERE HE WAS.
[1:19:25] HE COULD NO LONGER BE WHAT HE WAS. AMEN.
[1:19:28] NOW [screaming] HE'S GOT A DIFFERENT
[1:19:30] HEART ABOUT HIM. WHAT THE ANOINTING HAD
[1:19:33] COME UPON him and brought out that life
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; of the seed.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh my. Amen. Salvation
[1:19:43] has come to this house for so much as he
[1:19:46] also is a son of David. For the son or
[1:19:48] Abraham's the son of man is come to seek
[1:19:51] and to save that which is lost. G Jesus
[1:19:54] just you know we read those scriptures
[1:19:56] here a couple weeks ago. Amen. Jesus
[1:19:58] just passed by the Peter. Amen. Follow
[1:20:01] thou me. And here he was dropped his
[1:20:03] nets his left his father left everything
[1:20:06] right there and took off on what was it?
[1:20:08] It was the anointing coming his way.
[1:20:11] Amen. Energizing the elect of the day.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:20:18] You see, brother Random, why are people
[1:20:20] so TOSSED ABOUT? HE SAID, SOME PEOPLE
[1:20:22] GETS THE WRONG IMPRESSION OF WHAT THE
[1:20:24] ANOINTING IS. Did you ever think of
[1:20:26] that? That when uh when was the greatest
[1:20:29] anointing ever gave to anyone? And what
[1:20:32] did they do when they had the anointing?
[1:20:34] The greatest anointing that was ever
[1:20:36] given to anyone was Jesus Christ. We
[1:20:38] have the spirit by measure. He had it
[1:20:40] without measure. And one day he entered
[1:20:42] into the temple and picked up the scroll
[1:20:44] and read, "The spirit of God is upon me,
[1:20:47] for he hath anointed me to preach the
[1:20:49] acceptable year, to bind up the broken
[1:20:51] hearts, to heal the sick, AND GIVE SIGHT
[1:20:53] TO THE BLIND." NOW, we would think IF
[1:20:56] SUCH AN ANOINTING WAS UPON HIM, IT HAD
[1:20:59] BEEN PROPHESIED 800 years before, AMEN,
[1:21:02] THAT IT WOULD COME. AND and uh here HE
[1:21:06] WAS WITH THAT TYPE OF ANOINTING, THE
[1:21:08] FULL BLESSINGS AND THE ANOINTING OF THE
[1:21:10] LORD UPON HIM. We we would want to run
[1:21:12] all over the building and scream and
[1:21:14] holler, BUT THE BIBLE SAID he laid DOWN
[1:21:17] THE SCROLL AND SAT DOWN AND PRECIOUS
[1:21:21] words proceeded from his mouth.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; That's what he done under the anointing.
[1:21:26] The anointing IS NOT AN EMOTION. THE
[1:21:28] ANOINTING IS THE SUPREME POWER in
[1:21:31] control.
[1:21:32] Knowing exactly what and how. See,
[1:21:36] that's what is here,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Did you catch that? Now,
[1:21:42] he's talking about Jesus, but now he's
[1:21:45] also bringing in now the anointing of
[1:21:48] this last day is is here AS WELL. IT'S
[1:21:53] THE WORDS THAT HAVE BEEN COMING OUT.
[1:21:56] WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:21:58] Deuteronomy 32:1. Give, give ear, O ye
[1:22:01] heavens, and I will speak. Here, O
[1:22:06] earth, THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH. MY
[1:22:09] DOCTRINE SHALL DROP AS RAIN. MY SPEECH
[1:22:13] SHALL DISTILL AS THE DEW, AS THE SMALL
[1:22:17] RAIN UPON THE TENDER HERB, AS THE
[1:22:19] SHOWERS upon the grass. This is the
[1:22:21] anointing. IT'S THE ANOINTING COMING
[1:22:24] DOWN TO MAKE THAT SEED TO LIVE. AMEN. HE
[1:22:27] SAYS, "MY WORDS, I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO
[1:22:30] ME. MY WORDS ARE HERE TO ANOINT YOU."
[1:22:34] AMEN. MY WORDS ARE HERE TO BRING LIFE TO
[1:22:38] THE PLANET. [applause]
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, if you're just sitting
[1:22:43] here and listening to words, Amen. Or
[1:22:45] maybe there's Amen. [laughter]
[1:22:46] Hallelujah. Maybe there's some uh uh
[1:22:48] someone here today that you
[1:22:51] there ain't no seed there. AMEN. THE
[1:22:54] ANOINTING CAN FALL AND IT MEANS NOTHING
[1:22:56] TO YOU. BUT WHEN THIS ANOINTING FALLS,
[1:23:00] IT is to energize the elect.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Now, [snorts] praise the Lord. Now there
[1:23:11] there in as he talks about this
[1:23:14] anointing that is coming. Now he also
[1:23:16] gives the prophecy there in in Isaiah 28
[1:23:20] and9. It says to whom shall he teach
[1:23:22] knowledge? To whom shall he make un to
[1:23:25] understand doctrine? Them that are
[1:23:27] weaned from the milk and drawn from the
[1:23:29] breast. For precept must be upon
[1:23:32] precept. Precept upon precept. Line upon
[1:23:35] line. Line upon line. Here a little and
[1:23:38] there a little. For with stammering lips
[1:23:40] and another tongue will I speak to this
[1:23:42] people to to whom he said, "This is the
[1:23:46] rest. This is that anointing wherewith
[1:23:48] you have caused you shall cause the
[1:23:50] weary to rest. This is the refreshing."
[1:23:53] Yet they would not hear. But the word of
[1:23:57] God was unto them. Precept upon precept,
[1:24:02] precept upon precept, line upon line,
[1:24:05] line upon line, here a little, there a
[1:24:07] little. that they might go fall
[1:24:09] backwards and be broken and snared and
[1:24:12] taken. So, so, so he WAS SAYING NOW
[1:24:15] THERE THE words came there the anointing
[1:24:19] fell. Amen. But the majority IT DID
[1:24:22] NOTHING TO. BUT THE ELECT SAID, "WHERE
[1:24:26] COULD WE GO?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; FOR THOU HAST THE WORDS of eternal
[1:24:30] life." It meant more than money. It
[1:24:32] meant more than jobs. It meant more than
[1:24:34] boyfriend and girlfriend. It meant more,
[1:24:37] amen, than the Sanhedrin. IT MEANT MORE
[1:24:39] THAN ANYTHING. AND IT MEANS MORE THAN
[1:24:41] ANYTHING TODAY. THIS ANOINTING THAT IS
[1:24:44] HERE ON THE EARTH. IT'S THE SON OF MAN
[1:24:48] ANOINTING. IT'S THAT GREAT MIGHTY ANGEL
[1:24:51] THAT HAS BEEN PROPHESIED TO COME TO MAKE
[1:24:55] THAT word live.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Anointed.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some of you may be sitting
[1:25:08] here and say, "Man, I don't feel
[1:25:09] anointed." You don't have to feel
[1:25:10] anointed. The anointing is here.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; What is it producing in you? Can you say
[1:25:16] amen?
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; The anointing has been here for seven
[1:25:18] ages. The Holy Spirit has been here in
[1:25:21] in measure throughout the seven ages.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; But there has got to be a rapturing
[1:25:27] anointing.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why God came in our in
[1:25:32] our day. Well, glory to God.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, "Now, you cannot
[1:25:37] make a holy church. There is no such
[1:25:40] thing as a holy church or a holy
[1:25:42] organization." The Holy Spirit can be
[1:25:44] preached in it, but in there you find
[1:25:47] good and bad, renegades, indifferent,
[1:25:49] everything else. So, an organization
[1:25:51] will not hold. You can't say, "We got
[1:25:53] it." None of the rest of them has it. No
[1:25:55] sir. The Holy Spirit is poured out on
[1:25:58] individuals. It's the individuals. GOES
[1:26:00] ON DOWN. IT SAYS ALL DOWN THROUGH THE
[1:26:02] AGES THEY re receive the Holy Spirit,
[1:26:07] but not in the measure that they have it
[1:26:10] now because it's the restoration of the
[1:26:12] first.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; If we take the candlesticks,
[1:26:16] alpha and omega, they how they lit the
[1:26:19] first candle, it went higher and higher
[1:26:21] and then it got dimmer and dimmer. Then
[1:26:23] it come back again, the first and the
[1:26:25] last and so forth. But in this church
[1:26:28] age, the message is being poured into
[1:26:33] the church,
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; the church body itself.
[1:26:38] See the tabernacle. Amen. We we'll say
[1:26:42] this tabernacle will say uh that's where
[1:26:44] she comes to church. This tabernacle is
[1:26:47] not a Holy Ghost tabernacle. There's no
[1:26:49] such thing. Individuals that come into
[1:26:51] this church is the Holy Ghost
[1:26:52] tabernacles. They are the tabernacles
[1:26:55] that contain the Holy Ghost, but not the
[1:26:57] church in the body, a group. Therefore,
[1:26:59] it runs out. And this man WAS POURING
[1:27:04] [screaming] THE WATER, THE MESSENGER to
[1:27:07] the church, pouring the message into the
[1:27:11] church.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Now, what he's doing, he's interpreting,
[1:27:15] Amen. He's interpreting a a a sister's
[1:27:17] dream that that had come and and and and
[1:27:20] he and he says there was a tall mountain
[1:27:22] and and and she she was going up the
[1:27:25] mountain and there was this rock box and
[1:27:27] uh and and and and this this messenger
[1:27:30] was coming and pouring the purest and
[1:27:32] the cleanest of water. He said now amen
[1:27:36] he he says uh he says that water was the
[1:27:38] Holy Ghost. That water was the Holy
[1:27:41] Ghost, but he said it kept pouring out
[1:27:43] because they were putting it in a
[1:27:44] denomination. So, Amen. So, then he went
[1:27:47] and got a a bucket of honey and he and
[1:27:49] he put it in there. And she said, "Well,
[1:27:51] all the honey's going to go out, too."
[1:27:53] But the honey stood, AMEN. UH, FILLED UP
[1:27:56] ALL OF THE HOLES. AND HE SAYS, "THAT'S
[1:27:58] BROTHERLY KINDNESS." He said this age is
[1:28:01] THE AGE THAT'S GOT TO PRODUCE BROTHERLY
[1:28:04] KINDNESS IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS GOING TO
[1:28:08] KEEP THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THE MESSENGER IS THE SEVENTH
[1:28:12] CHURCH AGE MESSENGER POURING [screaming]
[1:28:15] THE MESSAGE
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; POURING NOT [screaming] THE NOT WHAT IS
[1:28:22] THAT WATER? IT'S IT'S A TYPE OF THE HOLY
[1:28:24] GHOST. WHAT IS WHAT IS OIL? IT'S A TYPE
[1:28:26] OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND WHAT IS HE DOING?
[1:28:29] HE IS POURING THE HOLY GHOST. HE'S
[1:28:32] POURING THE message into the church.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandis is interpreting it
[1:28:38] a paragraph before he says, "Now, that
[1:28:41] water was the Holy Ghost." And then he
[1:28:43] stopped and then I I just got and then I
[1:28:45] came in here and read the next phase to
[1:28:47] you because it's a long it's a long uh
[1:28:50] uh quote there. It says, "And this man
[1:28:53] was pouring the water,
[1:28:55] the message into the church." He was
[1:29:00] using,
[1:29:01] Amen. synonymously water, HOLY SPIRIT,
[1:29:06] AND THE MESSAGE ALL AS ONE.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW YOU YOU MIGHT SAY, "AMEN." NOW,
[1:29:13] I I I now, brother Wendell, I'm I'm um
[1:29:20] I I I need a little bit more uh
[1:29:22] understanding of this. Amen. Now, he
[1:29:27] says uh uh uh he he says uh he says
[1:29:32] there in God keeps his word. He says you
[1:29:34] don't come to church to hear a message
[1:29:36] or to see a messenger. Amen. You you
[1:29:39] come to hear the message. The message is
[1:29:42] the Holy Spirit taking the word of God

[1:46:44] glory and my miracles which I did in
[1:46:47] Egypt and in the wilderness and have
[1:46:49] tented now the me these 10 times and
[1:46:51] have not hearkened my voice. Surely they
[1:46:53] shall not see the land
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; which I swear unto their fathers neither
[1:46:58] shall any of them that provoked me see
[1:47:00] it. Now, now here he's saying the glory
[1:47:03] of the Lord is upon the earth.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; And they've all seen my glory,
[1:47:11] but they'll not enter into the land.

[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; as rain.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:48:41] my conscience?
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.

[1:49:04] logos, the presence of God is here.
[1:49:09] You'll never be Jesus Christ. There will
[1:49:12] not be Hallelujah. There ain't two gods
[1:49:15] in heaven and there ain't there is only
[1:49:17] one God and he is in the body of Jesus
[1:49:20] Christ sitting on the throne.

[1:49:47] Psalms 110.
[1:49:49] And I'm talking about this treasure and
[1:49:51] earth and vessels. Now this is all you
[1:49:53] this is what's taking place on the
[1:49:55] inside of you. Psalms 110 and1 the Lord
[1:49:58] said unto my Lord sit thou on my right
[1:50:01] hand till I make thine enemies thy
[1:50:03] foottool.
[1:50:05] And the Lord shall send the rod of thy
[1:50:07] strength out of Zion. Rule thou in the
[1:50:10] midst of thine enemies.
[1:50:13] And I love this. Thy people
[1:50:17] shall be willing
[1:50:19] in the day of thy power.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; In the beauty of holiness from the womb
[1:50:25] of the morning, thou hast the due of thy
[1:50:29] youth. THE LORD HATH SWORN AND WILL NOT
[1:50:35] REPENT. Someone shout hallelujah.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; The Lord's word. The word that he you

[1:50:47] IT'S ALL A PART OF PREDESTINATION.
[1:50:49] The message has come. The message has
[1:50:52] come. So it THE MESSAGE HAS COME AS A
[1:50:57] vehicle
[1:50:58] as a vehicle for the anointing to come.
[1:51:01] BROTHER BRANDON WOULD PUT IT THIS WAY.
[1:51:03] HE SAYS THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS BEEN BOUND
[1:51:06] AT THE DOORS OF CREEDS AND DOGMAS FOR
[1:51:09] 2,000 YEARS. BUT THE HOLY SPIRIT is to
[1:51:12] be released by the evening time message.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; When the words come, it releases the
[1:51:23] Holy Spirit
[1:51:25] in praise the Lord.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, I'm not looking for the
[1:51:32] I'm not looking for the the the the the
[1:51:36] the feeling because the feeling is going
[1:51:38] to come and go. And I appreciate the
[1:51:40] feeling. And I and I am I I'm a guy that
[1:51:42] wears my feelings on my sleeve.

[1:52:09] the anointing.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; That anointing is that deep settledness
[1:52:14] down deep in the heart
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; that says God's got a divine purpose for
[1:52:19] me.

[1:53:22] disputing, that ye may be blameless and
[1:53:25] harmless, the sons of God, without
[1:53:27] rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
[1:53:29] perverse nation, among whom ye shine as
[1:53:33] lights in the world, holding forth the
[1:53:36] word of life, that I may rejoice in the
[1:53:38] day of Christ, that I have not run in
[1:53:41] vain, neither labored in vain.

[1:53:59] it is God who is effectively at work in
[1:54:03] you both to will and to work." That is
[1:54:06] strengthening, energizing, creating in
[1:54:09] you the longing and the ability to
[1:54:11] fulfill your purpose for his good
[1:54:14] pleasure. Amen.

[2:21:32] Brother
[2:21:35] Brandham would say
[2:21:39] that he takes the washing of this the
[2:21:41] water of this word. He says now [music]
[2:21:43] you can't use the word from the
[2:21:46] Pentecostal age. He says it won't work
[2:21:49] for the bride age. But he says [music]
[2:21:50] but you take this word and it'll wash
[2:21:54] you from those old prostitutes.
[2:21:56] It'll clean your garments. It'll make
[2:21:59] you
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; It'll make you what you want to be.
[2:22:02] There's power in that word.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Feed on it.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; See, [music] the problem is is this. We
[2:22:10] wonder why we don't have power and
[2:22:12] authority.
[2:22:13] And the authority is in the anointing.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; The anointing is on is upon the word.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; So, when we're putting these other stuff
[2:22:22] in our minds, [music] we're constantly
[2:22:24] on games. We're constantly on our phone.
[2:22:27] We're [music] and we're we're we're
[2:22:29] we're filling our we are
[2:22:33] we're embracing the prostitutes. [music]
[2:22:36] We're embracing that stuff.
[2:22:42] A a game is not is is is not is [music]
[2:22:45] not
[2:22:48] bad.
[2:22:50] [music]
[2:22:50] There are there are things, but
[2:22:55] Satan has connected. He's found a way to
[2:22:57] connect himself to our spirits.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; And the message of the hour, if you
[2:23:05] listen to the message of the hour, it'll
[2:23:07] [music] convict you of that stuff
[2:23:09] majorly.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; It'll convict you. It It's It's there. I
[2:23:13] mean, to me, it's [music] just as plain
[2:23:15] as plain can be.
[2:23:18] But we've got to
[2:23:21] separate ourselves from that. And then
[2:23:23] in order for the word to wash us, we've
[2:23:26] got to be [music] listening to the word,
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Let that word listen to us. And so you
[2:23:31] new ones, if you don't have the message
[2:23:33] on your phone and you're not listening
[2:23:35] [music] to a message, you're not hearing
[2:23:37] the seventh angel's words, and I'd
[2:23:40] encourage I don't know if you've got it
[2:23:41] on your phone or Patrick or [music] and
[2:23:42] and brother
[2:23:45] Bosow, but u any of you new ones, you
[2:23:48] [music] need you need need to be
[2:23:50] listening to that message. Let it wash
[2:23:52] you. But it [music] is that right?
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; And those of us that do listen to it, it
[2:23:59] can't become common.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; You know, [music] I I was telling the
[2:24:04] Lord the other day, I I I when it when
[2:24:07] it's when it first started coming,
