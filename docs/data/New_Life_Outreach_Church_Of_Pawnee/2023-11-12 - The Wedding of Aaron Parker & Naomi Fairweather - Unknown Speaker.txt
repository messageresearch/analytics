who gives this woman to be married to this man mother and I you can be seated could we just bow our heads for a word of prayer father we're so thankful for your blessings we're so thankful Lord for what this day means and Lord of all the planning and Lord all of the work that has been put in to make this such a special occasion but Lord it would be nothing without you and we're asking Lord that you would be here on with every song with every word Lord with everything that is done and said we want your approval and your blessings we ask this Lord in your name amen and amen well I'd like to first begin by welcoming everyone and thanking everyone uh for being here on this most happy day and I know it's it's no accident that you are here today you're here because you represent someone important in the individual and the collective lives of eron and Naomi and seeing so many people that are that are here today I um I think Naomi and Aaron should be very thankful to have such wonderful support and friends you know outside of Salvation the most remarkable moment in life is when you meet that special person who makes you feel complete the person who makes the world a beautiful and magical place it's this person with whom you share a bond so special that it transcends all normal relationships and it becomes something so pure and so wonderful that you just can't imagine spending your life without the other person and that's why we're here today that's why Naomi and Aaron is here and yet marriage is perhaps the greatest and most challenging Adventures of all human relationships there's no ceremony that can create a strong and lasting marriage there's nothing here that I can say that's going to make your marriage last there's only one thing that can do that and that is through your commitment to God and your commitment one to the other a strong marriage comes through love and patience through dedication and perseverance a strong relationship comes from talking and listening and I want to say listening it's it's important that we listen a strong relationship comes from helping supporting believing in one another through tenderness and laughter through learning to forgive through learning to appreciate each of the differences in in one another and by learning to make the important things matter and to let the rest of it to go that makes a strong relationship there's going to be plenty of Trials and I I I am sure if we took a poll here today of of of all of the successful marriages that have been married for a long time there's been a few times where things didn't look too good but because of this commit ment that they made one day before God and before their friends their marriage has lasted and they're stronger today than they've ever been you see this ceremony is to make vows before God and before these Witnesses and to affirm that you've chosen to forsake all others and cling to one another as lifelong companions the scripture says for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh it's quite obvious that the Lord God instituted marriage as an experience of love where Two Hearts Beat As One Elohim designed and instituted this Union as the only proper social order it is to provide that through well ordered families truth and Holiness might be transmitted from one generation ation to the next The Paton is going to be placed in your hands you're no longer under the authority of your parents as adults you're standing here today you're making lifelong decision that you and you alone will be responsible for your families your family raising your children it's the greatest thing it's the greatest honor it's the greatest responsibility I believe it's the greatest thing in the heartbeat of God Jesus when he performed his first miracle it was at a wedding the Apostle Paul through the divine revelation chose the symbol of husband and wife and the union that binds together he chose that to show the union between Christ himself and his blood bought ransomed bride what a wonderful wonderful thing this is today we are going to sing a song and I just want us to just bow our heads in prayer before we do father thinking of what I have just said and the blessedness of this relationship we're so thankful that you have chosen that you have ordained us and that you have given us lifelong companions and I'm asking God that you will bless this couple in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen praise the Lord last night this morning and so we're just we're just blessed to sing with these professional singers here man right test test [Music] test we stand here together by choices we have made we give ourselves completely to start our lives this [Music] day We join with each other asking God to [Music] lead knowing he'll be faithful to us [Music] eternally I give you my [Music] heart I give you my unending love I give you my word that I will be yours as long as there are stars [Applause] above and as long as there are Sands in the sea I promise that I will be ever [Music] faithful to you the years will have their hard times this side know is true but we'll count on each other and when each day is through [Music] yes we will pray together asking God to lead knowing he'll be faithful to us etern ET I give you my [Music] heart I give you my unending love I give you my word that I will be yours as long as there are stars above and as long as there are sins in the sea I promise that I will be ever faithful to you and as long as there are s in the sea I promise that I will be ever [Music] faithful to [Music] you the importance of starting the marriage off right doing it the way that God wants it done you see this is a blending of two individuals into one this is the blending of Hearts you're going to be two individuals you'll have two different opinions many of times but the goal it's a United goal it's a it's a it's a heart that beats us one and this Solomon sacred charge of this relationship should not be formed thoughtlessly irreverently but it should be formed advisedly and prayerfully and in the fear of God knowing that he God he is the Divine author he's the one who has ordained and blessed the marriage as Believers we know that we are in the presence in his presence and you will both answer someday when our hearts will be made manifest fast and the promise that you two make to one another will stand throughout eternity you see love is not an emotion love is the very core of your being we all wake up on the wrong side of the bed occasionally things go crazy and Haywire occasionally but love is not based on how we feel love is that something way down deep inside that God gave you for one another you see it's the sacred Act of God himself in The Binding of the two hearts together that no one else could ever share its beauty the only ones that can share this beauty of Love is you for her and you for him this is something that God has given you both just for one another you both must protect it and hold it sacred because happiness doesn't consist of how much of the world's good you own but how contented you are with the portions that you have been lotted now there's going to be times where you're not going to see things alike but you will always remember that you're still in love and sometimes we got to give in and say sorry and it and it's okay it's it's it's it's all right for a man to say sorry it's okay for a woman to say sorry it's okay to be able to stand there amen the prophet of God says there's a little bowl in a human heart that is full of golden oil called love he says if it's ever broken it can be healed but there will be a scar there as long as you live so let's start this thing off right let's love one another always amen now Aaron will you have this woman to be your wedded wife to live together after God's ordinances in the Holy estate of matrimony will you love her comfort her honor her keep her in sickness and in health forsaking all others and keep Naomi by your side as long as you both shall live Naomi will you have this man to be your wedded husband to live together after God's ordinance in the Holy estate of matrimony will you obey him and serve him and love and honor and keep him in sickness and in health forsaking all others and keep yourself only unto Aaron as long as you both shall live I do all right would you have your rings and what we'll have is you can just hand those to me there and then I'm going to have y'all to hold this Bible just like that and we're going to place these Rings right here and hopefully we won't drop any of them either amen you see these Rings here on this Bible you're making a covenant and our covenant the in the in the world today they've taken the Bible out of the courtrooms they've taken taking the Bible out of our public offices and we can see we can clearly see what is what has taken place in our country they removed the standard the standard is the foundation of this Bible That's the standard for marriage that's the standard that is holding those Rings If you do away with God's nature you do away with God's laws you've done away with God you've done away with your marriage you've done away with love love can only come from God and God has given us the foundation of his word and we must forever remember that of course the circle of a ring it symbolizes eternity you've chosen gold for your rings and it's it's a type of that which is least tarnished and most enduring these rings are to show how lasting and imperishable our faith is which is mutually pledged as the union now formed is to be separated only by death you both must truly understand and I want you to really Ponder the duties that you both assume as a believing couple marriage is not for the weak in faith marriage is for those who know Jesus and loves the Lord with all of their heart for only then can you truly love one another amen but I promise you through prayer you can and you will conquer any kind of a fold that'll come this union today is going to be a bond and if the Lord should Terry your family will become a great pillar in the house of the Lord and it's going to be because of this commitment that is made here today so Aaron it is the responsibility of the husband to shelter his bride from all danger and this is this protection is for physically and spiritually to provide for her every need it is your duty to cherish her and to give of yourself and to love her as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her now Naomi it is the responsibility of the wife to reverence and to trust and Obey her husband to put on the meek ornament of of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in God's side of great price now God's word commands that the wives be subject there's got to be a leader that doesn't mean that one's going to be lording over another that simply means there's got to be a provider there's got to be one that stands makes the decisions seeks the Lord and then there's got to be a team that says we're going to push toward the goal it's the privilege of both to Delight in the company of one another to be undivided in interest and affection seek God's will for your lives and work together in fulfilling God's your dreams and let each remember God's divine order in all things can you say Amen how many of the audience agrees with that amen now I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to take the Bible from you and brother Aaron I
