[40:40] Lord had delivered him out of the
[40:43] hand of all of his enemies and out of
[40:47] the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is
[40:49] my
[40:50] rock my Fortress and my
[40:54] deliverer the god of my rock in him will
[40:58] I trust he is my shield the Horn of my

[41:08] Savior thou savest me from violence I
[41:11] will call on the Lord who is worthy to
[41:14] be praised so shall I be saved from mine
[41:18] enemies when the waves of death
[41:21] compassed me in the floods of ungodly
[41:25] men made me afraid the Sorrows of Hell
[41:28] compassed me about the snares of death
[41:31] prevented me in my distress I called
[41:34] upon the Lord and cried to my God and he
[41:38] did hear my voice out of his Temple and
[41:42] My Cry did enter into his
[41:45] ears then the Earth Shook and trembled
[41:48] the foundations of Heaven moved and
[41:50] shook because he was wroth there went up
[41:54] a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out
[41:56] of his the mouth devoured Coes were
[42:00] kindled by it he bowed the heavens also
[42:03] and came down and darkness was under his
[42:06] feet he rode upon a cherub and did fly
[42:10] he was seen upon the wings of the wind
[42:12] he made Darkness Pavilions round about
[42:16] him dark Waters and thick clouds of the
[42:18] Skies through the brightness before him
[42:21] were coals of fire kindled the Lord
[42:24] thundered From Heaven and the most high
[42:27] uttered his voice he sent arrows and
[42:29] Scattered them lightning and
[42:31] discomforted
[42:32] them and the channels of the sea
[42:36] appeared and the foundations of the
[42:38] world were discovered at the rebuking of
[42:41] the Lord at the blast of the breath of
[42:43] his nostrils he sent from above and took
[42:47] me he drew me out of many Waters he
[42:51] delivered me from my strong enemy from
[42:55] them that hated me for they were strong

[44:09] give you glory and honor in Jesus name
[44:12] we pray can the church say
[44:15] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[44:19] seated here this
[44:21] morning amen I want to
[44:25] minister uh for a title the positive
[44:29] word over the
[44:32] bride amen and that truly is a positive
[44:36] word that is over us
[44:40] today amen as the psalmist wrote amen
[44:46] His Banner Over Me Is Love and his love
[44:50] is incredible as we have just read of
[44:55] what God done for David
[44:57] and David looking there at his in his
[45:00] situations and it looked so so
[45:04] incredibly uh impossible and the enemies
[45:08] had swore to to destroy David and to
[45:12] kill him but yet God in his goodness
[45:16] amen was not going to let the seed of
[45:18] God be Forsaken and destroyed and I I I
[45:23] want to say that every promise that God
[45:25] has given in the new and Old Testament
[45:28] is just as good today as it was the day
[45:31] that he first gave it amen it's a
[45:34] positive word amen David David had
[45:37] prayed and there were and there were
[45:39] times that amen uh uh there were
[45:42] wonderful times in David's life there
[45:45] were times that he come against the bear
[45:47] and the lion and Goliath and he had come
[45:50] through so many but this time he's
[45:53] looking at the whole thing all put
[45:55] together and how that God had a
[45:57] predestinated plan for him and how that
[46:00] he was going to be the king the
[46:03] anointing oil had already been put upon
[46:05] him he amen he was anointed to be king
[46:09] but yet it was a promise that was far
[46:13] out in the future and God all along was
[46:17] letting him know that he loved him and
[46:19] that he had a plan but on this day here
[46:22] stands David as the king and he's saying
[46:25] God has has kept his word to me God is
[46:30] is has has brought me through and shown
[46:33] his grace upon my life and there's
[46:36] something about when we're living in the
[46:38] in the Fulfillment you see a positive
[46:41] word amen would mean the the the
[46:44] Fulfillment sister juwel it's good to
[46:45] see you back there amen been missing you
[46:48] around here so a positive word would be
[46:52] the the the the Fulfillment it's the
[46:54] promise that is living right before our
[46:58] eyes amen that that is a amen the as
[47:01] brother Brandon would say it would it is
[47:03] the word made light he would say the
[47:06] life is only by the word of God made
[47:10] manifest life comes only by the word of
[47:12] God made manifest as long as it is in
[47:15] the book like this it can still be
[47:17] questioned but when it's made manifest
[47:21] then you see the product of what it
[47:24] spoke of being made manifest then that
[47:27] is light upon the word amen see that's
[47:31] what brings the word said so and then
[47:34] when it comes to pass that is the life
[47:37] in light light bringing life can you say
[47:40] Amen so so it is with the bride of the
[47:43] Lord Jesus Christ we are living amen
[47:47] under a a positive a more positive word
[47:52] than any other age because it was the
[47:55] promises that had been given given just
[47:57] as it was to David promises given but
[48:00] yet David would go through a lot of his
[48:03] journey in coming to the throne but when
[48:06] he got to the throne well blessed be the
[48:10] name of the Lord he could say I'm living
[48:13] in the light of the word and so I say
[48:16] today of all ages there is a people that
[48:20] is living in the light of the word it it
[48:23] amen the Old Testament Saints when Jesus
[48:25] was amen when Jesus was
[48:29] um when when he was here on the earth
[48:31] the Old Testament prophets that had
[48:33] talked about the Messiah had talked
[48:36] about amen the kinsman redeemer all of
[48:39] the uh uh all of the uh Old Testament uh
[48:44] uh you know statutes and and and and the
[48:47] the uh Ark and and the sacrifices and
[48:51] all of these things were pointing to a
[48:55] future time when the Messiah would come
[48:59] God on Earth amen a baby being born of a
[49:03] virgin but when the when the Apostle
[49:06] John amen begin to look back and begin
[49:09] to talk about uh uh what what he thought
[49:12] of this Christ amen there in 1 John 1
[49:15] And1 he says that which was from the
[49:17] beginning which we have heard which we
[49:20] have seen with our eyes which we have
[49:23] looked upon and our hands have hand L of
[49:27] the word of God Amen so he was saying it
[49:30] was a promise amen but guys our eyes
[49:34] literally seen word made flesh our ears
[49:40] literally heard words made flesh in fact
[49:45] amen our hands have handled of the very
[49:49] Word of Life Now how did it handle of
[49:51] the very Word of Life amen they ate with
[49:54] him they slept with him they amen they
[49:56] were with him in his ministry it was
[50:00] word made flesh I I I just want to say
[50:02] today amen when the word becomes
[50:05] positive that is God's word coming off
[50:08] of the pages and living in your
[50:12] flesh well hallelujah amen brother
[50:16] Brandon would say he says I like that
[50:18] God's promise can not fail won't you
[50:22] turn to your neighbor right now and tell
[50:23] them God's promise cannot fail amen man
[50:27] he says it cannot fail that's right the
[50:29] word is positive it cannot change it
[50:34] must stay the same It Was Written amen
[50:38] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[50:40] amen what did the prophet of God says
[50:42] amen when the enemy comes in like a
[50:44] flood God raises the standard Higher and
[50:48] Higher by bringing his word more
[50:52] positive and positive Hallelujah amen oh
[50:57] I I I I I like that this morning how I
[50:59] would like to preach Amen on that ever
[51:02] positive word of God in my everyday life
[51:06] amen oh when the enemy's coming in and
[51:08] it seems you're going to fail when it
[51:10] seems amen that all hope is gone just
[51:13] remember you've been given a word and
[51:17] how does he make it more positive by
[51:20] bringing it to pass in your life amen
[51:23] bringing it to pass in your life by Mak
[51:26] making his word more positive to
[51:31] you Hallelujah blessed be the name of
[51:34] the Lord hallelujah so I'm thankful for
[51:37] that here today amen I'm thankful for
[51:40] his promises now now I want us to look
[51:43] amen there in in Proverbs 4:18 amen the
[51:47] path of the just is as The Shining Light
[51:50] that shineth more and more unto that
[51:54] perfect day amen so so it's going to get
[51:58] amen our our path today is not going to
[52:00] get darker and darker unto the coming of
[52:03] the Lord but our path is going to grow
[52:06] what brighter and brighter somebody say
[52:09] brighter and brighter it's not darker
[52:13] and darker it's brighter and brighter
[52:17] how does where do we get light how does
[52:20] it come brighter is the word becomes
[52:24] more positive the word takes on flesh
[52:28] the word comes off of the pages well I
[52:31] wish somebody would preach with me right
[52:33] now the word comes off of the pages and
[52:38] made real in me amen it was the end of
[52:41] Israel's Journey amen where they found
[52:45] an Ephesians now amen there there was no
[52:49] placing or no positioning in Egypt for
[52:52] Israel amen it was part of the journey
[52:55] and the blood was initiated there amen
[52:58] but there was no positioning there was
[53:00] no place for them to build their own
[53:02] houses to have their own land amen there
[53:05] was no place in the wilderness God was
[53:07] good to them there amen they ate mana
[53:10] and ate ate ate angel food they they had
[53:13] many miracles but they could not build
[53:16] houses and dwell there because that was
[53:20] not the place that God had ordained for
[53:23] them but when they got to the promised
[53:25] land the place that God had in his mind
[53:29] predestinated before the foundation of
[53:31] the world then they could build their
[53:35] houses right there amen they could raise
[53:37] their children right there amen and I I
[53:40] I want you to look here today where we
[53:42] are at there has been a promise of
[53:45] redemption there was the blood of Jesus
[53:47] Christ amen that was shed on Calvary and
[53:51] we have been through Seven Ages amen of
[53:53] going through the Wilderness experiences
[53:55] of amen denominations coming and going
[53:58] and rising and falling there's been many
[54:01] of those amen type of uh of things and
[54:04] there has been no place for the bride to
[54:08] be able to build upon Amen to build a
[54:11] solid place of Refuge but God has
[54:14] promised that there was going to be a
[54:17] placing of the Sons and Daughters of God
[54:20] he promised that there would be sons and
[54:23] daughters with authority he promised
[54:26] there would rise a church that would be
[54:29] greater than any other church he
[54:32] hallelujah amen you know he promised
[54:34] that you know the prophet says there's
[54:36] been churches churches brides and
[54:39] churches but there must come one with
[54:42] all of the fullness of Christ in
[54:46] her I know the denominations have
[54:49] claimed it and fail I know others have
[54:51] claimed it and failed but I say today we
[54:54] are living in a positive word the reason
[54:58] for the first age is this age the reason
[55:01] for the second age is for this age the
[55:04] reason for the third and the fourth and
[55:06] the fifth is for this
[55:10] age this is the age of maturity this is
[55:14] the age that God's been taking you amen
[55:18] this is the positive to his
[55:22] word hallelujah can you say Amen now
[55:27] Amen brother Bram would say now he says
[55:30] there's got to come an
[55:33] Ephesians there must come now when you
[55:36] look at Ephesians you think now what is
[55:37] an Ephesians well he says Joshua at the
[55:41] Book of Joshua and the book of Ephesians
[55:44] parallel so what Joshua was in the Old
[55:47] Testament the the book of Ephesians was
[55:50] to the New Testament Joshua after they
[55:54] came through their wilderness after they
[55:57] gone through all of the denominational
[55:59] Cycles then Joshua took them across into
[56:04] their promised land and possession them
[56:08] according to what God had in his
[56:11] mind well that's just wonderful did you
[56:14] know that each one of those tribes as
[56:16] those as as the 12 sons of Jacob were
[56:19] being born amen their mama would
[56:22] intercede and as and and and she would
[56:24] amen give out a name and did you know
[56:27] that each name that that that that she
[56:30] gave uh those women would give those
[56:33] boys amen it was a it was a particular
[56:37] possession in that
[56:41] land hallelujah amen when she would name
[56:45] Ephraim that that maybe that meant corn
[56:48] and that was a certain portion of the
[56:49] land amen that they would possess there
[56:52] were amen it would go all the way down
[56:54] now here comes Joshua amen all of these
[56:57] hundreds of years later and Joshua is
[57:00] standing there under the inspiration of
[57:03] God and he is dividing the land of
[57:07] promise to those people now before that
[57:11] time amen they had to live on Mana
[57:14] before that time amen they had to depend
[57:17] upon God to send Quail before that time
[57:20] amen they they were having to ask for
[57:23] water and but when they got to their own
[57:26] land did you know the Bible says that
[57:29] when they got into that land the
[57:31] scripture says and they ate of the Corn
[57:35] of the land Hallelujah they were no
[57:39] longer in a journey they had arrived to
[57:43] the place I'm he Canan was no longer
[57:49] just a promise they were eating the milk
[57:52] and honey they were eating the corn of
[57:54] the land they were building houses and
[57:57] living therein it was God's promise to
[58:01] that people made
[58:06] light can you say amen amen now now
[58:10] brother bradam would say Amen there in
[58:13] Paradox he says we're we're promised
[58:15] according to Revelations 10 according to
[58:17] Malachi 4 Revelations amen
[58:21] 2217 amen I think he meant 17:30 and so
[58:25] forth that there had has got to come a
[58:28] an Ephesians to this there is promised
[58:30] it friends there must come an Ephesians
[58:34] that these Sevenfold Mysteries of the
[58:37] word of God would be M uh uh be unfolded
[58:40] amen it's an it's a lotsy an age that it
[58:44] takes place amen I believe we're here I
[58:47] believe we're right in the shadows of
[58:49] the coming of the Son of God as Joshua
[58:51] said before the Ephesians raised up so
[58:54] did John the Baptist raise up just
[58:57] before the next Ephesians and we're
[58:59] promised another Ephesians it's
[59:01] predicted here in scripture therefore I
[59:04] think we're living in Ephesians again we
[59:07] are promised that what was left off
[59:10] during those Seven Ages amen now you
[59:12] cannot add anything to the bi the book A
[59:15] A and you can't take anything from it
[59:17] Revelations 22:18 says so amen who will
[59:20] hear uh uh who will ever uh uh uh will
[59:24] add one word or take one word his part
[59:27] will be taken from the book of life and
[59:30] now we cannot at or take so therefore we
[59:33] know that Luther could not get to it
[59:36] Wesley and so forth the reformers knocks
[59:39] finny Calvin on down so forth they
[59:41] cannot get to it all amen but what they
[59:44] had was the Gospel truth but in the last
[59:47] days somebody say in the last days we
[59:49] are given the understanding or the
[59:52] Revelation by the word that there's
[59:55] going to be and to we're going to
[59:59] understand it because it'll come to an
[1:00:01] Ephesian age he says we're here right

[1:00:18] an Ephesian age that's when the word

[1:00:35] land what is the Ephesian age to you
[1:00:39] amen is where you are claiming your
[1:00:42] mountains in the land that God promised
[1:00:47] those guys in the wilderness could never
[1:00:49] understand it amen they talked about it
[1:00:51] amen but they feared it they talked
[1:00:53] about it but when it came C time to go
[1:00:56] into the land amen their fearful Hearts
[1:00:58] were saying I I I we just can't do it
[1:01:01] but when the age arrived when the
[1:01:03] Ephesus arri when it was time to go in
[1:01:06] there Rose an anointing and there was a
[1:01:09] Joshua say the land is yet before you

[1:01:41] the Promises of God Amen what what do
[1:01:43] you think Joshua would have said what do
[1:01:45] you think the Holy Ghost would have said
[1:01:47] amen if they would have just all got
[1:01:49] over to the other side and say okay
[1:01:50] we're here amen and I guess I guess
[1:01:53] we'll just have to huddle together so
[1:01:55] they can't amen kill very many of us
[1:01:57] amen not God would have that's not God's
[1:01:59] purpose the promise was given so that
[1:02:02] you could
[1:02:05] possess amen Caleb comes up and says
[1:02:08] listen amen it was 40 something years
[1:02:11] ago amen all right that that God gave me

[1:02:39] positive

[1:02:47] says the trouble with man tonight that's
[1:02:50] what the trouble with the people tonight
[1:02:52] you're scared it's the biggest curse
[1:02:55] there is on the Full Gospel people or
[1:02:57] any people is is because they are afraid
[1:03:02] God made the
[1:03:05] provision turn to your neighbor and say
[1:03:07] God made the
[1:03:08] provision but you're afraid to take his
[1:03:11] word for it if you wasn't afraid tonight
[1:03:15] why you could you would take your
[1:03:18] healing by faith know that God promised
[1:03:22] it and the thing would just go Plum away
[1:03:25] from you
[1:03:26] amen he says I've noticed it that's the
[1:03:28] reason I'm such a believer in
[1:03:32] healing it was promised for the day

[1:03:39] Elijah was to come with healing in his
[1:03:41] wings it's the promise for today if we

[1:04:33] and saying listen there's going to be
[1:04:35] somebody that's listening to me that's
[1:04:38] going to go take that mountain that

[1:06:50] the Brazen serpent was provided for the
[1:06:52] journey the pillar of fire was provided
[1:06:55] for the journey amen but the journey was
[1:06:59] not the position the journey was not the
[1:07:02] place they could not build houses there
[1:07:05] but when they got to the land that was
[1:07:10] promised then they could have confidence
[1:07:14] that every giant Must
[1:07:17] Fall every giant Must Fall why they had
[1:07:22] come back to their position that God God
[1:07:25] had ordained for them amen I wonder
[1:07:29] tonight or this morning if the Holy
[1:07:31] Spirit could touch to our hearts amen oh

[1:07:49] that we must be in our Promised Land
[1:07:52] amen possessing that land for the
[1:07:55] Messiah to come and pick us up brother
[1:07:57] bradam says the Messiah could not come
[1:08:00] to Egypt the Messiah could not come to
[1:08:03] uh uh the Wilderness he says only when
[1:08:06] the people was in their Promised Land
[1:08:10] Israel is where the Messiah could come
[1:08:13] word made flesh now I I I I hope I I I I
[1:08:18] hope you're hearing me here this morning
[1:08:20] amen it was not any other place that the
[1:08:23] Rapture could come to except for Christ
[1:08:26] can only come to the believer who has
[1:08:29] found that promised
[1:08:34] Landen you hear me amen now we're not
[1:08:38] talking about a natural Israel or a
[1:08:40] natural this or a natural that we're
[1:08:41] talking about the place where the where
[1:08:44] the Bible says I'll send you Elijah the
[1:08:47] prophet and he will take you back to
[1:08:51] your
[1:08:53] possession now
[1:08:56] amen the Holy Spirit In You Echoes what
[1:09:00] the voice has already said now now here
[1:09:03] brother brenon would say When God says
[1:09:05] it and it echoes against the crystal
[1:09:08] Echoes against that predestinated word
[1:09:11] he said just like it does on the crystal
[1:09:13] in the radio it makes it perfect God
[1:09:16] said I'm the Lord that Health thee that
[1:09:19] settles it amen that makes it real I'll
[1:09:22] be with thee even in you to the end of
[1:09:25] the world that makes it real he's here
[1:09:28] now that's the way it is when I'm taking
[1:09:31] Divine Healing can you say Amen now I
[1:09:34] want you to understand there's a
[1:09:36] specific word for this age I will send
[1:09:40] Elijah the prophet he's going to
[1:09:43] position you this is the day the Bible
[1:09:46] says amen that Heavens must keep Christ
[1:09:50] until the time of
[1:09:53] restitution there must come amen a
[1:09:57] restoration through that prophetic
[1:10:00] Ministry amen now now are are you
[1:10:04] hearing
[1:10:05] me the
[1:10:07] promise is more positive today
[1:10:14] now I think of brother
[1:10:18] bram's confidence have y'all ever
[1:10:20] thought about brother Brandon's
[1:10:21] confidence how he how he came up am man
[1:10:23] he would stand up behind the pulpit
[1:10:24] service after service discern thoughts
[1:10:26] and hearts and always always accurate
[1:10:29] just always hitting it on the money just
[1:10:32] I mean never failing amen you you you
[1:10:35] you know you know why is because the
[1:10:38] promise of Malachi 4 was made positive
[1:10:43] to
[1:10:43] him when the angel come to him and said
[1:10:48] this scripture here Belongs to
[1:10:52] You Hallelujah this scripture Belongs to
[1:10:56] You amen he said you're going to take
[1:10:58] healing to the world Amen you're going
[1:11:01] to go around the world you're going to
[1:11:02] pray for kings and potentates now now
[1:11:04] his preacher his Pastor actually says
[1:11:06] how are you going to do that with a with
[1:11:08] just a amen a seventh grade education
[1:11:10] how are you going to do those things but
[1:11:12] brother bradam would say I believed the
[1:11:17] angel because the angel made scripture
[1:11:21] real to his heart
[1:11:26] Hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah I said
[1:11:30] Hallelujah and then and then all of a
[1:11:32] sudden he's out there praying baptizing
[1:11:35] and then the angel of the Lord comes
[1:11:36] down on the 17th person and and it goes
[1:11:38] around the country he didn't do that but
[1:11:41] he was expecting it he was satisfied
[1:11:44] because the word had become positive to
[1:11:48] him amen are you hearing me well if the
[1:11:51] word came positive to send us in Elijah
[1:11:53] how much more should the the children of
[1:11:55] Elijah for the Bible says that he would
[1:11:58] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:12:00] the faith of the
[1:12:02] fathers amen now he says he says when
[1:12:07] the angel of the Lord uh appeared that
[1:12:09] night and said I'll be with you don't be
[1:12:12] afraid what he would do he said he'd
[1:12:16] show signs and wonders among the people
[1:12:17] I questioned him I said they won't
[1:12:20] believe that he says it'll come to pass
[1:12:23] that you'll even know the very secrets
[1:12:24] of the hearts and tell them these things
[1:12:27] I questioned that he referred it back to
[1:12:30] Christ he says I'll be with you and then
[1:12:34] when I walk to the platform the sick
[1:12:36] people or something like another like
[1:12:38] that on those things I come to a
[1:12:41] positive thing I believe it what the
[1:12:46] angel told me he told me to do it I walk
[1:12:50] up because I'm walking under a positive
[1:12:57] promise well y'all ought to be smiling
[1:12:59] about right
[1:13:00] now that's the way it is with the bride
[1:13:03] because we've been positioned in this
[1:13:06] day can you say amen amen someone asked
[1:13:10] him aren't you scared am me that you're
[1:13:12] going to make a
[1:13:13] mistake what if you make a mistake amen
[1:13:17] he says I can't as long as I'm relying
[1:13:18] on him because he gave the promise can
[1:13:22] you say Amen so what caused the
[1:13:24] confidence it was though a specific word
[1:13:27] now Amen brother Bram would say when God
[1:13:30] tells you anything it's a positive truth
[1:13:32] you cannot get away from it it's got to
[1:13:35] happen someone said brother brandom
[1:13:36] aren't you afraid that you'll make a
[1:13:38] mistake um when someone comes to the
[1:13:41] platform and you tell them the wrong
[1:13:43] disease no sir you aren't you afraid
[1:13:46] here the other day there's a man
[1:13:47] arrested down in the South for telling a
[1:13:49] man he lived untrue to his wife and so
[1:13:50] forth and was arrested because it was a
[1:13:52] story why sure if it's a story anything
[1:13:55] can happen you're you're you're working
[1:13:57] in yourself but when you stand under the
[1:14:00] Divine promise of God there is no fear
[1:14:03] in God that's right it's bound to be
[1:14:07] it's perfect it's never failed it never
[1:14:09] will fail because God cannot
[1:14:13] lie man another place somebody said
[1:14:16] brother Brandon aren't you afraid of
[1:14:17] mistake a mistake how can God make a
[1:14:20] mistake certainly that angel came up
[1:14:23] here that night and said he was sending
[1:14:25] me to do this certain thing about the
[1:14:28] visions and so forth and around the
[1:14:30] world I've went with it with all kinds
[1:14:32] of people all kinds of places and not
[1:14:34] one time did it fail why I'm certain it
[1:14:38] was
[1:14:40] God oh come on little bride you've got a
[1:14:43] promise today it's not the promise of a
[1:14:45] seminary it's God that has came
[1:14:47] specifically for this day to tell you
[1:14:50] that you are the rapturing bride
[1:14:55] right he says it come according to his
[1:14:57] word it's according to his spirit it's
[1:14:59] according to his nature and it's exactly
[1:15:02] on time to Abraham's
[1:15:05] seed man how could John the Baptist be
[1:15:08] so confident when he said Behold the
[1:15:11] Lamb of God that takes away to the sin
[1:15:12] of the world people all around him could
[1:15:14] ask the question look at here there's
[1:15:16] over two million people in Israel today
[1:15:20] how how will you know this Messiah how
[1:15:22] will you know he'll be an ordinary man
[1:15:24] he he'll be one of the sons of David why
[1:15:27] where where will he come from the
[1:15:29] lineage of David there's thousands times
[1:15:31] thousands of them how will you know how
[1:15:34] will you be able to introduce him to the
[1:15:36] world and know that it's him he says I
[1:15:38] have the word of God I'll know him he
[1:15:42] said one of uh there there is one
[1:15:44] standing in your midst there is one
[1:15:46] standing in the midst now who do who you
[1:15:48] do not know he will baptize with the
[1:15:50] Holy Ghost in fire how will you know
[1:15:52] John I'm resting upon the Water word
[1:15:55] because God in the wilderness that told
[1:15:58] me go baptize and upon whom I will see
[1:16:01] the spirit descending and remaining
[1:16:03] that's the one that's going to baptize
[1:16:05] with the Holy Ghost in fire he said John
[1:16:08] was was standing there he knew him not
[1:16:11] he I knew him not but he was an ordinary
[1:16:13] man he was dressed like a man he looked
[1:16:16] like a man he was a man he said I knew
[1:16:18] him not but one told me you'll see that
[1:16:22] sign and that will be the spirit resting
[1:16:25] upon Him John wasn't afraid he'd make a
[1:16:29] mistake because he knew him
[1:16:34] amen but then he stops and he says
[1:16:38] oh how can we be mistaken
[1:16:42] then when Jesus said these signs shall
[1:16:44] follow them that believe in my name
[1:16:47] you'll cast out devils and speak with
[1:16:49] new tongues and take up serpents and
[1:16:50] drink deadly things and will not harm
[1:16:52] them and they shall lay their hands upon
[1:16:54] the sick and they shall recover can you
[1:16:57] say Amen now Hallelujah now I I I want
[1:17:01] you to catch are y'all following me so
[1:17:03] far now brother bradam would say at the
[1:17:06] opening of the word amen they're they're
[1:17:09] in the they're in the Rapture message
[1:17:11] just before he passed away he actually
[1:17:13] says and I say this because it's life
[1:17:16] I'm responsible to God for saying it I
[1:17:18] must say it my message all the time
[1:17:21] knowing back there under the healing and
[1:17:23] so forth that was just to catch the
[1:17:26] people's attention knowing the message
[1:17:30] would
[1:17:31] come now he was saying now these signs
[1:17:35] were not the voice the signs were not
[1:17:38] the reason for me coming my
[1:17:41] purpose was to stand as Joshua and
[1:17:45] divide an inheritance to the
[1:17:49] people now now that might not mean much
[1:17:51] to you amen but it means a lot to the
[1:17:54] bride
[1:17:55] because when she knows beyond a shadow
[1:17:58] of a doubt that it's been Vindicated by
[1:18:00] God and that her faith is Vindicated by
[1:18:03] God it gives her faith for the Greater
[1:18:08] Works you see as long as it was brother
[1:18:11] brandham healing and Discerning you and
[1:18:15] I would sit there and think oh if
[1:18:16] brother brandham was here but he said my
[1:18:19] purpose was not for the healing and the
[1:18:22] prophecy my purpose was to deliver an
[1:18:26] open
[1:18:28] book and that is what has been given to
[1:18:31] the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ so it
[1:18:34] doesn't matter well you say well if if
[1:18:35] if there was just somebody that could
[1:18:37] discern over me you've got something
[1:18:39] more positive than discernment you've
[1:18:41] got word made flesh oh if I had somebody
[1:18:45] that could lay hands upon me some Gifted
[1:18:48] Man and that that would be wonderful but
[1:18:50] you've got something better than just
[1:18:52] someone laying hands although that's
[1:18:54] scripture and that's wonderful you've
[1:18:56] got a faith to possess healing
[1:19:00] yourself it's part of your
[1:19:06] land how's the Rapture going to take
[1:19:08] place somebody is in the living in the
[1:19:11] land of the word and possessing the
[1:19:13] Rapture believing all things are
[1:19:17] possible Hallelujah can you say amen
[1:19:20] amen now anointed one's at the end time
[1:19:23] he says my message is on my heart
[1:19:25] I must get it out that's my sole purpose
[1:19:28] oh I love that I must I know what God's
[1:19:31] revealed I've got to get it to the elect
[1:19:34] oh someone shout
[1:19:35] hallelujah if the people can get this
[1:19:38] message not that they can get my
[1:19:39] discernment not that they can have the
[1:19:41] gifts of healing no that they can have
[1:19:43] this message that they are God's
[1:19:49] people not legalism this ain't legalism
[1:19:52] this is your inheritance to believe
[1:19:56] every word of
[1:19:59] God Amen he says I've got it I must get

[1:22:38] another
[1:22:40] Ephesians he says
[1:22:42] Ephesians was the placing or the giving
[1:22:46] of understanding of who you
[1:22:51] are can you say Amen now now remember
[1:22:56] the Ephesian age amen is where we are
[1:22:59] given the Revelation that we're going to
[1:23:02] understand because it'll come to an
[1:23:04] Ephesian age now it's your placing again
[1:23:10] what is Ephesians it is the
[1:23:13] understanding of the father's
[1:23:15] wealth what is Ephesians it is that
[1:23:19] you're having the understanding that you
[1:23:20] are his son and daughter the
[1:23:24] understanding that your father says it
[1:23:25] all belongs to you it's the bringing you
[1:23:28] to your position in The Inheritance and
[1:23:32] making it more positive when I was a
[1:23:34] child I spake as a child I understood as
[1:23:37] a child amen but when it came when it
[1:23:41] came time to that maturity then I can
[1:23:44] tell them all about who they are and
[1:23:47] what they are and what well glory to God
[1:23:50] when they were children they were old
[1:23:52] they were up and down and in and out but
[1:23:53] now that they they've come amen they
[1:23:55] have come to a place where they can
[1:23:57] build their houses amen and they can
[1:23:59] inhabit the land amen they can stand
[1:24:02] there upon their promise and say there
[1:24:03] is not a giant that is going to
[1:24:05] withstand me that is going to stand
[1:24:07] before me I shall overcome every one of
[1:24:11] them Hallelujah can you say Amen It
[1:24:14] could only happen at the end of The
[1:24:17] Journey it couldn't happen at the first
[1:24:19] it couldn't happen in the middle It
[1:24:20] could only happen at the end of The
[1:24:22] Journey amen and in this SE and it well
[1:24:25] you say when now Ephesians was at the
[1:24:27] beginning of the journey Ephesians was
[1:24:29] at the end of the Jewish dispensation
[1:24:33] Ephesians amen what was it it was Jesus
[1:24:36] Christ the the sinless Son of God Amen
[1:24:41] that that took the sins of the world and
[1:24:43] there was a spirit born spirit filled
[1:24:47] church under operating under the
[1:24:51] authority of that word amen but then we
[1:24:55] left that and then we fell back and then
[1:24:57] we've gone to the Wilderness but I'm
[1:24:59] here to tell you it's in Ephesians again
[1:25:01] where God is declaring I am with my
[1:25:05] people I am healing I am delivering I Am
[1:25:11] with
[1:25:16] You
[1:25:18] Hallelujah in the book of Ephesians he
[1:25:21] do you do do you realize it's God it's
[1:25:24] not not us begging God for anything it's
[1:25:26] God God's running to
[1:25:29] you let's let's look up there Ephesians
[1:25:31] 5 one and five let's just break in
[1:25:34] amen
[1:25:36] hallelujah having predestinated us unto
[1:25:40] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:25:42] himself to himself according to the good
[1:25:46] pleasure of his
[1:25:48] will to the
[1:25:50] praise of the
[1:25:52] glory of whose Grace
[1:25:55] see it's all in God's plan for you to be
[1:25:59] with this it's all in God's plan for his
[1:26:02] glory to rest upon you to the praise of
[1:26:06] the glory of somebody say his
[1:26:09] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:26:12] in the
[1:26:13] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[1:26:16] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[1:26:20] sins according to the it'll never be by
[1:26:25] your works you'll never earn it you'll
[1:26:28] never be able to get God's attention any
[1:26:31] other way than through faith God's
[1:26:34] predestinated you to it amen you you say
[1:26:38] oh I if I was just good enough I if I
[1:26:40] was just good enough that I could pray
[1:26:42] and God would hear if I was just a
[1:26:44] better Christian why don't you come to
[1:26:46] the understanding why don't you have
[1:26:49] another Ephesus why don't you get a
[1:26:51] divine revelation that you you are the
[1:26:54] one that God died for so that you can
[1:26:58] possess every
[1:27:02] land well if I could ever that's a
[1:27:06] Wilderness mentality that's Wilderness
[1:27:09] means confusion confusion I'm confused
[1:27:12] don't know if I'm up don't know if I'm

[1:27:30] repentance and I know there's got to be
[1:27:32] those thing we got to keep ourselves
[1:27:33] pure and clean that does not change that
[1:27:36] does not take you in and out of the

[1:27:40] promised land that promised land is
[1:27:42] yours stand up and
[1:27:49] fight and whom to the praise of the

[1:28:21] had in his mind can you say Amen we have
[1:28:24] Redemption through his blood the
[1:28:27] Forgiveness of sins and I'm so glad he
[1:28:30] said according to the
[1:28:34] riches riches I can't get over it riches
[1:28:37] somebody say
[1:28:39] riches Riches of his grace you think
[1:28:43] you'll ever be able Amen to to siphon
[1:28:46] all of God's riches out of his his grace
[1:28:48] his bank amen what God has God is the
[1:28:52] Abundant of riches God amen is the
[1:28:55] Supreme he's the source he's The Giver
[1:28:57] he's hallelujah amen now watch amen it
[1:29:01] says where in he
[1:29:04] hath
[1:29:08] reluctantly now he's talking to the
[1:29:10] Ephesian Church you're at a position
[1:29:13] here you're at a place to where you can
[1:29:18] act as God would want you to act and
[1:29:21] understand wherein he has a bounded
[1:29:25] toward
[1:29:27] you in all
[1:29:32] wisdom are y'all hearing me abounded
[1:29:36] what's that word abounded amen came
[1:29:39] running what's that word abound amen
[1:29:44] hallelujah abound you know I mean here's
[1:29:47] here's here's a giving praise the Lord
[1:29:50] amen here is a giving there's a promise
[1:29:53] Hallelujah but this is
[1:29:55] abounding this this is
[1:29:58] abounding it's it's God throwing
[1:30:01] everything that is
[1:30:04] God this is coming up and saying I wish
[1:30:07] I could be healed but this is God just
[1:30:09] throwing everything right on top of you
[1:30:11] and saying come on it is yours this is
[1:30:14] what you're created for this is what I
[1:30:16] died for this is what I'm looking for
[1:30:19] you for believe what I've given you it's
[1:30:22] the riches of his grace
[1:30:25] we're not begging God for anything we're
[1:30:27] not asking God in a in a Beggar's
[1:30:29] mentality we're standing up and saying
[1:30:32] this is my land and devil get off my
[1:30:41] land we don't come up and say please we
[1:30:44] come up and say get
[1:30:46] off I'm
[1:30:48] positioned in the
[1:30:50] land it's my land did not brother brand
[1:30:54] say the title deed was the opening of
[1:30:56] the
[1:30:58] book are you hearing me
[1:31:01] now so the
[1:31:03] giving okay so wherein he
[1:31:09] abounded someone said and and I used to
[1:31:11] say it all the time myself well and I
[1:31:14] was dead
[1:31:16] wrong you used to say well the closer
[1:31:18] that God
[1:31:20] comes or the the closer we get to the
[1:31:23] coming of the Lord
[1:31:24] and as Grace lifts from the
[1:31:27] USA then we're going to find it harder
[1:31:30] to have our prayers
[1:31:31] answered you know I I it it might sound
[1:31:35] good in
[1:31:36] theory but just because are you those
[1:31:40] that those that are making that and I
[1:31:42] used to make that statement well you
[1:31:44] know just harder that's the reason why
[1:31:45] it's harder to pray it's the reason why
[1:31:46] it's harder to believe it's be because
[1:31:49] it's just Spirit of the Lord's lifting
[1:31:51] you United States I I I I I want to tell
[1:31:53] you
[1:31:55] the spirit of the Lord's lifting from
[1:31:56] the United States but he he'll never
[1:31:58] leave that
[1:31:59] bride he'll never leave that
[1:32:02] bride and the prophet says that this
[1:32:07] Ephesus must come why did he parallel
[1:32:12] Ephesus with Joshua go read
[1:32:16] Josh Joshua was dividing the Joshua is
[1:32:20] where you read of all the accounts of of
[1:32:23] War the the accounts of overcoming the
[1:32:27] accounts
[1:32:29] what they were in their
[1:32:34] land and the Holy Ghost has come and
[1:32:37] there was a which is the which is that
[1:32:40] Promised Land but the word had to come
[1:32:43] to position you in that
[1:32:49] land Pentecostals out there they can
[1:32:51] they can they can they can dance around
[1:32:53] Jesus name they can jump and they can
[1:32:54] shout and they can do all of that kind
[1:32:55] of thing there but until they've heard
[1:32:57] of Joshua to place them tell them what
[1:33:01] the Holy Ghost is there for well they're
[1:33:04] just nothing more than another
[1:33:08] denomination but the elect is saying hey
[1:33:12] this is my
[1:33:13] land I don't beg for it God's not left
[1:33:18] me I know there's a bunch of giants in
[1:33:20] the
[1:33:22] land but I'm going to ni name every one
[1:33:24] of you Hallelujah can you say amen
[1:33:28] hallelujah yes sir now now if you would
[1:33:32] go back to that uh that last verse we
[1:33:34] read there sister keys I think the
[1:33:35] seventh or eth verse wherein he hath
[1:33:37] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:33:39] Prudence now what is he abounding what
[1:33:41] is he trying to do what is God trying to
[1:33:45] do why did Brother Bram says Ephesus is
[1:33:48] the same in the New Testament as Joshua
[1:33:51] is in the Old Testament where in he got
[1:33:53] bound to toward us in all wisdom and
[1:33:55] Prudence having made known unto us the
[1:34:02] mystery of his
[1:34:06] plan according to his good
[1:34:09] pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:34:14] himself Christ died and that was the
[1:34:18] beginning that's the beginning of the
[1:34:20] journey justification sanctification yes
[1:34:24] I'm glad to have the Holy
[1:34:26] Ghost but the whole purpose for all of
[1:34:29] those three stages of Grace is so that I
[1:34:33] can act with
[1:34:35] confidence in the land that God's given
[1:34:42] me and for those of you that don't
[1:34:44] believe that well we don't need a
[1:34:46] prophet we've got the we've got
[1:34:47] justification sanctification and the
[1:34:49] Holy Ghost then why did they have to
[1:34:51] have Joshua
[1:34:54] it was their
[1:34:56] land it took a prophet to say Gad don't
[1:34:59] you get over there on on ephraim's land
[1:35:03] hey get get you you you stay in your as
[1:35:06] long as you are in your
[1:35:09] position you have a right to build your
[1:35:13] house and you have a right
[1:35:16] to I don't know about you but the
[1:35:19] prophet of God in the adoption series he
[1:35:21] says there wasn't even a Red Cross
[1:35:22] following them around
[1:35:25] he says amen when they were out there
[1:35:27] fighting there was no one dying there
[1:35:29] was no the amen that why because the
[1:35:31] angels of God were over there amen they
[1:35:34] they they were ministering healing to
[1:35:36] their little boo boos and their cuts and
[1:35:37] their scri oh come on Church why because
[1:35:40] God was proud that there was a people on
[1:35:42] the land and that was taking their place
[1:35:44] in the promised land and if there is
[1:35:45] somebody that needs to stand up today
[1:35:47] and say I'm going to take my position
[1:35:49] and let the angels of God come down and
[1:35:51] minister to me when I'm hurting when I'm
[1:35:53] when I'm needing healing I'm going to
[1:35:55] possess this is my land and you ain't
[1:35:57] keeping me out of it can I hear a great
[1:36:00] big
[1:36:02] amen amen having made known unto us the
[1:36:05] mystery of his will according to his
[1:36:09] purpose good pleasure which he has
[1:36:11] purposed in himself let's read another
[1:36:13] one I love this whole thing now I love
[1:36:16] this that in the
[1:36:17] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[1:36:21] might gather together and by the way
[1:36:22] he's that's a prophecy today he might
[1:36:25] gather together all in one uh all things
[1:36:28] in Christ which are in heaven which are
[1:36:30] on earth even in him in whom we have
[1:36:34] obtained an inheritance being
[1:36:36] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:36:38] of him who worketh I do are y'all
[1:36:42] catching the the drift here according to
[1:36:45] the
[1:36:46] purpose that he has purposed in himself
[1:36:49] after the counsel of his own will he
[1:36:52] keeps coming back what whatever plan he
[1:36:55] has here is what he is looking for his
[1:36:58] matured Sons and Daughters to accept
[1:37:01] you're not under you're you're not in
[1:37:02] the wilderness anymore you're not in
[1:37:04] Egypt anymore amen you're in this land
[1:37:06] and I'm here to tell you that
[1:37:08] inheritance is yours and it's not
[1:37:10] according to your Works it'll never be
[1:37:12] according to your Works it'll always be
[1:37:13] according to my divine power and if
[1:37:15] you'll believe me and trust me and walk
[1:37:17] with me amen I'm giving you a positive
[1:37:20] word that you'll overcome you'll defeat
[1:37:22] your enemy
[1:37:24] can you say
[1:37:25] Amen you've been given an inheritance
[1:37:28] being predestinated according to the
[1:37:30] purpose of him that worketh all things
[1:37:32] after the counsil of his own will
[1:37:35] Amen brother Brenham would say
[1:37:38] now he say now this is how this is this
[1:37:40] is how close it's getting as I go toward
[1:37:43] the wall that wall my shadow from a
[1:37:45] light the shadow becomes more positive
[1:37:47] and positive until it fades into the
[1:37:49] perfect me and as the coming of the Lord
[1:37:51] is coming to the Earth his presence is
[1:37:53] drawing closer and closer until we
[1:37:56] finally blend in with him and the spirit
[1:37:59] will take us with him can you say amen
[1:38:02] amen uh putting on the whole armor of
[1:38:04] God he says God just brings his word
[1:38:06] more positive all the time he don't have
[1:38:08] to refortify it and bring something else
[1:38:10] in he just makes his word more real all
[1:38:13] the time when the enemy comes in like a
[1:38:15] flood and the spirit of God raises up a
[1:38:17] standard against it amen then if the
[1:38:19] enemy comes in like a flood God's
[1:38:21] fortification to his people to fortify
[1:38:24] them is God's word he just raises the
[1:38:26] word a standard against him just like
[1:38:29] the word in the beginning was spoken to
[1:38:31] us in the Garden of Eden amen the spoken
[1:38:33] word the second time it was made flesh
[1:38:36] and dwelt Among Us the third time it
[1:38:38] become part of us in the Holy Ghost
[1:38:41] dwelling in us God coming into the man
[1:38:43] the first was the word the enemy tore it
[1:38:45] down the word was made flesh he was
[1:38:47] crucified but now amen there's a
[1:38:50] difference in the word the word is
[1:38:54] become the church and the church is the
[1:38:57] word
[1:39:01] God
[1:39:04] hallelujah he says now God doesn't have
[1:39:07] to do any more to his makeing get more
[1:39:09] appealing the only thing he has to do is
[1:39:11] just raise up a standard of his own word
[1:39:13] against the enemy and now what does he
[1:39:15] he when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:39:17] the spirit of God has raised the
[1:39:17] standard against it what does he do he
[1:39:19] makes the word that he's already SP uh
[1:39:22] spoken
[1:39:23] more positive taking the same word and
[1:39:28] making it more
[1:39:31] positive uh uh uh uh uh you know what
[1:39:34] you know what brother brandom says are
[1:39:35] we doing all right here this morning

[1:39:50] theophany he says this here is just the
[1:39:53] negative but the positive and the closer
[1:39:55] we're getting to the Rapture the greater
[1:39:57] the positive is the positive is saying

[1:42:39] image to be partakers of the word feed
[1:42:41] on the word by predestination since the
[1:42:43] beginning of
[1:42:47] time then if I'm here I'm going to start
[1:42:51] possessing you know one of the things
[1:42:52] that that that that that stands out to
[1:42:55] me and I and I have I have talked about
[1:42:58] this many
[1:42:59] times but one inherit one one one The
[1:43:03] Inheritance that was very specific from
[1:43:05] brother
[1:43:07] brandham that was very
[1:43:11] pafic he says your
[1:43:14] children are your
[1:43:19] inheritance let let me let let me let
[1:43:21] let me take you another place
[1:43:24] another thing did you know that the
[1:43:25] brother Bram says after the church is
[1:43:28] positioned they know who they are and
[1:43:30] what they
[1:43:32] are the prophet says they're not just
[1:43:35] standing there in that land he says I'll
[1:43:38] just read it to you he says after the
[1:43:40] church takes its position this is
[1:43:42] adoption four we are called to the
[1:43:45] adoption of sons by the Holy Spirit when
[1:43:47] each man takes his position what God has
[1:43:50] called him to do to stand to the end of
[1:43:53] the road going after the
[1:43:59] lost now if you were
[1:44:01] to to read because he's doing this all
[1:44:04] through the adoption series he is
[1:44:06] talking about
[1:44:09] Abram just before he melt met he met
[1:44:14] MDC and MDC gave him
[1:44:18] communion how many knows that we're
[1:44:20] fixing to go to MDC we're fixing to have
[1:44:22] the marriage of the Lamb amen and our
[1:44:25] King is going the Bible says we he's
[1:44:27] going to serve us just as MDC served a a
[1:44:32] a communion to Abraham right are y'all
[1:44:35] following me he says Abraham before this
[1:44:39] Abraham was going after
[1:44:45] lot lot was taken captive lot was down
[1:44:48] there amen the Kings had all got captive
[1:44:51] in his backsliding condition
[1:44:53] and he says he went after lot and his
[1:44:56] family and brought him back and God was
[1:44:58] so pleased after that I I just want to
[1:45:01] tell you that MDC was right there with
[1:45:04] Abraham fighting the battle with him I
[1:45:06] promise you
[1:45:08] that Abraham was doing God's
[1:45:11] bidding now I I I I I think I don't
[1:45:15] think I believe with all of my heart
[1:45:17] that the voice of the bride in her
[1:45:21] position stands before for
[1:45:24] God when two omnipotents come together
[1:45:27] and agreeing on God's word God the
[1:45:29] omnipotent given it you the omnipotent
[1:45:32] believer who has the you're the only one
[1:45:34] that has the ability to believe God's
[1:45:36] word lot don't have the ability to
[1:45:38] believe God's word he knows he's he
[1:45:40] knows he's wrong he knows he needs to
[1:45:41] get right he knows he needs to
[1:45:43] Hallelujah but it's an Abraham that goes
[1:45:45] after a lot backs well praise the
[1:45:49] Lord amen now brother says who was this
[1:45:53] man who was he he never had a father
[1:45:57] never had a mother he never had when he
[1:45:59] began a time when he
[1:46:02] died he met Abraham coming from the
[1:46:04] slaughter of the Kings what was he doing
[1:46:07] he went out to get lot his lost brother
[1:46:09] and to bring him back and he slaughtered
[1:46:10] the Kings and which them Kings had
[1:46:13] slaughtered I believe 10 15 Their
[1:46:15] Kingdoms but Abraham armed his servants
[1:46:18] went after him separated himself by
[1:46:20] night and he and and when he caught him
[1:46:23] in the night time oh brother we're to
[1:46:26] work in the darkness now the only light
[1:46:29] we have is the Gospel Light but he
[1:46:31] separated himself and caught him and
[1:46:33] brought him back and on his road back
[1:46:35] after the battle was over can I hear an
[1:46:38] amen he says Genesis 14:18 and MDC now
[1:46:41] that's Abraham returning now from his
[1:46:43] Slaughter of the Kings come come back on
[1:46:45] his Road bringing back lot and all the
[1:46:47] people that had taken away and then he
[1:46:49] says all like David who went and got uh
[1:46:53] the what what what did David do he took
[1:46:55] the little slingshot and went out and
[1:46:57] grabbed the little lamb out of the

[1:47:23] made to make us boast he went out after
[1:47:25] Goliath said the god of Heaven that let
[1:47:27] me let me deliver a lamb out of the
[1:47:29] mouth of a lion out of the mouth of the
