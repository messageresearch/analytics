[41:46] God just so wonderful amen amen he's so
[41:50] precious to us all isn't he amen I want
[41:54] to speak this morning on a on a
[41:56] just a simple title
[41:59] amen well it's a big title the token
[42:03] life of the son of
[42:05] man
[42:07] and what a incredible day that we live
[42:12] in we're living in a an incredible
[42:18] day we with modern society has has
[42:24] led all of us the world to Easy Living
[42:29] amen we we've got everything
[42:32] to uh uh just right at our fingertips
[42:35] and and uh you at one time could it it
[42:41] it it seemed like you could walk to
[42:43] Walmart or or go to Walmart or anywhere
[42:46] and you could pretty well find anything
[42:47] on the shelves and but we have seen a
[42:51] lot of things beginning to change these
[42:53] days as we have seen the the the war
[42:58] that is taking place the man uh we've
[43:03] got we've got Wars potential Wars that
[43:06] could just break out everywhere we've
[43:08] got amen that's we're living in a in an
[43:11] incredible
[43:13] hour
[43:14] and I think these things we can take
[43:17] advantage of them as
[43:19] we as as we see because you know brother
[43:22] brandham in countdown he says we notice
[43:24] the modern happen that we have we look
[43:27] at the scientific age that we live in
[43:30] the push button age and yet people have
[43:32] less time to pray than they ever did
[43:35] have and then in all these modern times
[43:38] they used to sit all night and listen to
[43:40] a mo to a sermon and now we can't do it
[43:44] we haven't got time to do it you see
[43:46] it's just in your head we think we
[43:48] haven't got time to do it but we
[43:51] have but we're living in that kind of a
[43:54] in that kind of an hour of Luke one
[43:56] warness and where the word of God but I
[43:59] uh where the word of God is not as as as
[44:01] rich as maybe it should be expectation
[44:05] isn't as rich as what it should be Amen
[44:07] in the lives of of of of God's people
[44:11] but yet as we begin to look and we see
[44:14] prophecies and the potential of
[44:16] prophecies and we as we're as we're
[44:19] beginning to see things getting a little
[44:22] uneasy man money's not as easy anymore
[44:25] and
[44:26] and and things are uh making you
[44:30] beginning to think a little bit more
[44:32] about the times about your life about
[44:35] your about where we are and I I think
[44:38] that maybe the Lord allows these kinds
[44:40] of times for the elect because I do
[44:43] believe that the coming of the Lord is
[44:45] right at
[44:46] hand I I I believe that
[44:49] lukewarmness should never dampen the
[44:53] expectation of of the believer
[44:57] and and because the tyranny of Satan has
[45:00] ruled and oppressed amen by his Wicked
[45:05] Fist and amen now he did have us
[45:09] laboring in sin and he had us laboring
[45:11] in we were Bound By by Demons of of sin
[45:17] before we come to Christ but we we find
[45:21] that many of times that we amen uh the
[45:25] we we are still laboring in his sweat
[45:28] shops uh amen uh he suppresses our joy
[45:33] he suppresses her praise suppresses our
[45:36] expectation keeping the soul the soul
[45:39] Bound by materialistic things and yet we
[45:43] are the very offspring of God and I want
[45:46] to amen let you know here this morning
[45:48] that we are not here on Earth to live to
[45:52] provide for our families we're not here
[45:54] on Earth to live in Comfort or to uh
[45:58] Drive nice cars or to live in nice
[46:02] houses we're not here on this Earth for
[46:06] materialistic things we we are here to
[46:09] be a body we're here to be an expression
[46:13] of Eternity we're we're here as the very
[46:18] Church of the Living God you see amen
[46:22] You're The Offspring of your creator you
[46:25] always were Sons you are the Eternal
[46:28] Gene seed of God but yet you were born
[46:32] in slavy to sin and death amen you were
[46:37] born
[46:38] with a sin nature you were born with uh
[46:43] uh in in corruption amen and Le out a
[46:47] sea Satan as Soul as so put it that amen
[46:52] he he he he wants the church to feel
[46:56] that they're totally free he wants Le
[46:58] Osa to rejoice and have churches and and
[47:01] wants Le osia to amen uh to have the
[47:04] mega churches wants wants families to
[47:07] raise their children in church he amen
[47:11] I'm talking about the oppressor I'm
[47:12] talking about Satan I'm talking about
[47:14] living under the tyranny of Satan amen
[47:17] once them amen you see he he takes the
[47:20] shackles that was once ound to the
[47:23] little to the little ball and chain and
[47:25] now he has extended the chain and so
[47:28] amen he he now allows you to get up and
[47:31] walk around in the room but you're still
[47:34] connected to a
[47:35] chain and so maybe we've been free from
[47:39] the cigarettes or maybe we've been free
[47:41] from the alcohol or maybe we've been
[47:44] free from a addictions of Amen of sin
[47:48] but you see Satan doesn't he he he owns
[47:52] the system Satan owns the church system
[47:56] amen and he and he and he wants us to to
[47:59] feel free he wants us to feel good that
[48:04] we we can walk around and go to church
[48:07] and that we can but yet we're still
[48:09] bound amen by by by the by by the chains
[48:14] of unbelief and still Bound by the
[48:16] chains of fear still Bound by amen H
[48:21] religious dogmas can you say Amen I I I
[48:26] say today that God is calling us to be
[48:29] free and and it's and and The Exodus
[48:32] time is upon us and it's going to take
[48:35] amen the blood the blood of Jesus Christ
[48:39] amen still can set the captives free
[48:42] amen we're not fighting against flesh
[48:45] and blood but we're fighting against
[48:46] spiritual
[48:48] wickedness amen and and and so we we we
[48:52] many of times we we uh the church seem
[48:55] seems to be happy when I say we I'm
[48:57] talking about the church system amen
[49:00] where uh the the the the the church
[49:02] world is
[49:04] just happy to to to have their name on a
[49:08] book or Amen to belong to a certain
[49:11] organization or belong and to have a
[49:14] Bible or a knowledge of God but God's
[49:16] not wanting people with a knowledge of
[49:18] him God is this is Exodus time folks
[49:22] amen this message uh uh church here this
[49:24] morning is not one that that that is
[49:27] that that that we are offering a a a a a
[49:31] a new idea we're not here preaching a
[49:34] just a a a different slant to the Bible
[49:37] what we have here today is the token
[49:39] life of Jesus Christ amen and we've got
[49:42] to have that token life of Jesus Christ
[49:44] it's not in the knowledge it's in the
[49:46] very life of the Lamb coming back upon
[49:48] the believer and making the believer
[49:51] amen securing the believer because the
[49:54] Death Angel is coming amen but it seems
[49:56] that the lukewarmness has caused the
[49:58] people Amen to be content to be in Egypt
[50:01] and content to just be a part of the
[50:04] system and content amen but God doesn't
[50:07] want us to be content because we've got
[50:09] a land that we're going to we've got a
[50:12] promise of we've got a promise your name
[50:16] is already written in that in that land
[50:19] can you say man I I I I see today as I
[50:23] you know as we a as we listened to or
[50:26] read this morning to uh uh the uh uh and
[50:30] I I thought maybe I might have had it
[50:32] here amen uh uh brother uh yes I have it
[50:36] right here you know where where brother
[50:38] Ken had put that quote out amen uh to to
[50:43] to you children and your parents and
[50:45] amen and and and how we should be
[50:47] thankful for what God has has has given
[50:51] us you you see amen we don't want to get
[50:53] caught up in in societ Society to where
[50:56] we don't appreciate what God has given
[50:59] to us in this day amen friends we are
[51:03] not a part of this Society amen we are a
[51:08] called out church we are not part of
[51:12] this Leo sea
[51:14] lukewarm amen uh the a church system
[51:19] that has no feeling and has no
[51:22] conviction we're not a part of a people
[51:25] a man that is wondering aimlessly and
[51:28] and and claiming
[51:30] Christianity we have been separated by
[51:33] God unto himself can you say amen amen I
[51:38] I I say as Peter here this morning amen
[51:41] there in Acts 2 and 40 save yourself
[51:44] from this HT a generation this
[51:48] generation is going to perish can you
[51:50] say amen God has called you out to
[51:55] uh separated you to Jesus Christ he has
[51:59] separated you and cleansing you and
[52:03] preparing you for an exodus that is to
[52:07] come I believe we are in that Exodus
[52:10] even now can you say amen amen and so I
[52:14] think even our attitudes of of this
[52:17] generation amen should should not uh
[52:20] should not be that of the generation the
[52:22] scripture says in the last days amen
[52:24] there would be unth thankful folks and
[52:26] that there would be Disobedience to
[52:28] parents and that there would be amen
[52:31] just just very arrogant people amen the
[52:34] Bible says that they would just be
[52:35] arrogant he spent a whole lot of time
[52:37] Peter dealt with it and Paul dealt with
[52:39] it a and talking about the arrogance of
[52:42] the people of this of of of of of Le OA
[52:46] but but I I want to say save yourself
[52:49] from this onour generation this cursed
[52:52] generation because God has got something
[52:55] and well praise the Lord I I want you to
[52:58] think about this because amen if you've
[53:00] ever thought about the amen the
[53:03] anointing that is on the earth at the
[53:07] time of this Exodus amen now I I I I I'm
[53:12] I hope I'm making sense here this
[53:13] morning as we as we sort of paint the
[53:15] picture of Gloom because Israel was was
[53:19] under the task masters of Amen of
[53:22] slavery now they were G God's people but
[53:26] yet they were under they had been years
[53:28] and years under under the task masters
[53:32] of bondage but yet when the pillar of
[53:35] fire showed up to Earth it came and
[53:39] appeared unto
[53:42] Moses that Pillar of Fire was ready to
[53:46] deliver and to
[53:48] avenge his people and the blood of his
[53:51] people it was the amen the the pillar of
[53:54] fire was the logos of God it was the son
[53:57] of man anointing it was God coming down
[54:01] upon a human being and would be a
[54:05] deliverer he God would be in flesh and
[54:10] would be a deliverer unto the people can
[54:13] you say Amen now Satan had to had to
[54:17] counter plan to God's Rapture plan amen
[54:20] Satan had to do this you see about the
[54:23] time of Deliverance when God's Prophet
[54:25] was born there was an evil spirit that
[54:28] caused pharaoh to to look at amen uh the
[54:33] all of the children of Israel and and
[54:36] and he says there's getting too many of
[54:38] them and he and so he he he sent out a
[54:41] decree to kill all of the babies that
[54:44] are two years and younger amen kill all
[54:47] of those babies you see there was an
[54:49] anointing not that that that that
[54:52] Pharaoh knew that that Moses was God
[54:55] deliverer it was Satan knew the Exodus
[55:00] was coming and the anointing on the
[55:04] earth well praise the Lord there was a
[55:07] satanic anointing to stop God's
[55:11] anointing on the earth and he tried to
[55:15] destroy H uh God's amen God's anointed
[55:19] so he started killing the babies but
[55:21] when God's anointing is upon the Earth
[55:23] brother there is nothing that Satan can
[55:26] do to stop that
[55:29] anointing when God's anointing is upon
[55:32] the Earth amen there is nothing Satan
[55:35] can well that should make you want to
[55:36] shout if you're predestinated for this
[55:40] age Satan's going to come against you
[55:42] he's going to try to destroy you he's
[55:45] going to try to destroy your purpose
[55:46] he's going to try to destroy your plag
[55:48] God's plan but he can't destroy God's
[55:51] plan he can't destroy God's purpose it
[55:55] was Exodus time it was time to go to the
[56:00] promised land brother I say today amen
[56:04] no matter what Satan does there is a
[56:08] purpose of God and it is a rapturing
[56:13] purpose now you man the scripture says
[56:17] that as the as the time begin to Drew
[56:20] draw nigh Moses was now on the scene
[56:24] Moses had heard from the pillar of fire
[56:27] Amen on the in the burning bush now
[56:30] Moses is is is there he's preaching to
[56:34] the people
[56:35] amen and and and now he's declaring that
[56:39] the promise is at hand the people are
[56:42] thrilled they're listening to what the
[56:45] prophet has to say but soon they found
[56:48] out that Pharaoh still had power over
[56:50] them people okay amen if you you could
[56:53] read there in Exodus the the the fifth
[56:56] chapter and it begins to deal with it
[56:58] and amen and uh and and the people
[57:01] started getting free and they started
[57:04] thinking you know amen it's it's time to
[57:06] go Moses the son of the the son of man
[57:09] is upon him the anointing is upon him
[57:12] and amen and and it's time to leave
[57:15] we're going to leave and no doubt they
[57:17] started getting a little cocky and no
[57:19] doubt they started looking at their task
[57:21] Masters and saying amen we're fixing to
[57:24] leave here you know amen but then
[57:26] Pharaoh comes in and Pharaoh tries to
[57:30] Squatch their Revival tries to Squatch
[57:34] their faith amen and and and you if you
[57:37] start there at the sixth verse it says
[57:39] amen Exodus 5 and six and Pharaoh
[57:42] commanded the same day that the
[57:43] taskmasters of the people and their
[57:44] offers saying you shall no more give the
[57:47] people straw to make brick as here to
[57:50] for but let them go and gather straw for
[57:53] themselves and the tail of the brick
[57:55] which they did make uh their here too
[57:59] for he shall lay upon them and ye shall
[58:02] not diminish off thereof for they be
[58:04] idle therefore they cry let us go and
[58:07] sacrifice to our god there let let their
[58:11] more work be laid upon the men that they
[58:14] may labor therein and let them not
[58:18] regard vain
[58:20] words amen so what did he do about the
[58:24] time
[58:25] about the time for Exodus the

[1:03:35] for God to fulfill his
[1:03:37] word can you say
[1:03:39] Amen they turn around and they they met
[1:03:43] with Moses and
[1:03:44] Aaron man they they is Moses and Aaron's
[1:03:49] coming from Pharaoh's courts and they
[1:03:51] said unto him amen the Lord look on you
[1:03:55] and judge you because you have made our
[1:03:58] Our Savior you've you've made our you

[1:04:03] the eyes of pharaoh the eyes of his
[1:04:06] servant amen and now youth Place Moses
[1:04:10] you've placed a sword in the hand of
[1:04:13] pharaoh to kill us hallelujah amen but I
[1:04:19] I want to tell you God's got a prophet
[1:04:21] when God sends a prophet on the earth
[1:04:22] there's a reason for that
[1:04:25] it's at the evening time that the token
[1:04:26] has got to be the token of blood has got
[1:04:29] to be replied or applied can you say
[1:04:31] amen amen there Comes A Time God was
[1:04:35] fulfilling the prophecy it doesn't
[1:04:38] matter and here we stand today amen we
[1:04:42] we've got so many things in life that
[1:04:44] we've just got to do we've got to
[1:04:47] provide for our family we've got to
[1:04:49] provide we've got to do those things
[1:04:52] amen that's part of sister listen you
[1:04:54] can drop off you can drop off the grid
[1:04:56] if you want to amen but there ain't none
[1:04:58] of us that can live amen without all of
[1:05:00] this convenience of leot see you can't
[1:05:03] go without a phone anymore and you can't
[1:05:05] go and and just go hunt your turkey and
[1:05:07] deer and and do your fish you you can't
[1:05:10] do that where the society is set up by
[1:05:14] pharaoh to keep you
[1:05:18] busy can you say Amen but in it all you
[1:05:23] can't lose the
[1:05:26] expectation because the Exodus is upon
[1:05:29] us the Exodus is upon us can you say
[1:05:33] amen amen you see in the evening time
[1:05:36] God required the token of blood Israel
[1:05:40] had heard God's Prophet they had seen
[1:05:43] the Vindicated signs and wonders and
[1:05:46] God's word was proven to be so real and
[1:05:50] so true amen oh Hallelujah that couldn't
[1:05:54] see any other way because God had come
[1:05:57] down so supernaturally through Moses
[1:06:00] they they they they didn't have a
[1:06:02] question because by the time that it was
[1:06:05] all set and done they knew that God's
[1:06:09] voice was in Moses they knew that the
[1:06:13] Exodus time was coming and they were
[1:06:16] prepared and when Moses said you've got
[1:06:19] to slay that lamb and put it upon the
[1:06:23] door Post in the lentil they were no
[1:06:26] longer questioning they were no longer
[1:06:28] wondering now they had seen the
[1:06:31] supernatural in Moses Ministry they had
[1:06:34] seen they knew that he was in connection
[1:06:38] with God and when Moses said I want you
[1:06:41] to kill that lamb I want you to apply
[1:06:44] that blood and you've got to stay it
[1:06:46] beneath
[1:06:47] it can you say amen amen there was no
[1:06:51] more
[1:06:52] questioning I I I I say tonight or this
[1:06:56] morning amen should there be any more
[1:06:59] questions left in our hearts how many of
[1:07:03] us can
[1:07:04] say that God was in this prophet of this
[1:07:08] generation how many of us can say
[1:07:11] without one
[1:07:13] doubt that God raised that Prophet up to
[1:07:18] bring us thus sayeth the Lord for a
[1:07:21] Rapture now come on Church amen without
[1:07:26] one doubt I have zero doubts that God
[1:07:30] sent William brandom as Malachi 4 in
[1:07:33] this last
[1:07:34] day the scripture says he was to turn
[1:07:38] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:07:43] promise can you say amen
[1:07:48] amen
[1:07:51] now there is a parallel
[1:07:55] that is taking
[1:07:56] place because brother brandham after the
[1:07:59] opening of the seal says this is the
[1:08:01] this is the greatest message even after
[1:08:03] the seals when he preached on the
[1:08:06] token you've got to have the
[1:08:09] token yes sir as Moses was standing
[1:08:14] there amen death the cogs of God's
[1:08:19] prophetic
[1:08:21] wheel had ever so slowly ground
[1:08:25] up the
[1:08:28] cogs of the
[1:08:29] wheels of
[1:08:32] Prophecy had been moving so
[1:08:36] slowly until they would not have known
[1:08:39] it except God did send a prophet okay
[1:08:43] can you say amen amen but now amen the
[1:08:47] final blow was
[1:08:49] on Satan was fixing to do the final amen
[1:08:55] the the the death angel was
[1:08:57] fixing was was fixing to to ride and
[1:09:03] amen and Israel was going to have to
[1:09:06] face the final blow they were going to
[1:09:10] have to face death itself okay
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:16] hallelujah mes told him said the death
[1:09:18] Angel's coming and there's no difference
[1:09:21] now there's there's there's no
[1:09:22] difference he doesn't care he doesn't
[1:09:24] care if you are Egyptian or Jew he's
[1:09:28] striking he's striking at midnight
[1:09:31] tonight he's going to
[1:09:34] come you you you stay in your house
[1:09:38] don't be taking the blood and putting it
[1:09:41] in a jar or in a five gallon can and say
[1:09:45] this is better this is better than just
[1:09:48] a little bit of blood amen displayed as
[1:09:51] a token ha I've got gallons of it here
[1:09:55] the
[1:09:56] requirement was to kill the
[1:09:59] lamb eat its
[1:10:02] flesh have have the have and apply that
[1:10:06] blood and you were to eat that Lamb with
[1:10:10] your staff in your hand your shoes on
[1:10:13] your
[1:10:14] feet you were there you were there with
[1:10:19] anticipation because God was fixing to
[1:10:23] bring the
[1:10:26] Exodus now once again this was not this
[1:10:29] was not amen just
[1:10:33] amen but God himself was on the earth oh
[1:10:38] can you say Amen when Moses came in and
[1:10:41] stood before Pharaoh he didn't say God
[1:10:44] said let my let his people go he stood
[1:10:46] up there and said first person Let My
[1:10:49] People
[1:10:51] Goen amen let my it was
[1:10:56] hallelujah what did God tell what did
[1:10:59] God tell Abraham he said your people's
[1:11:02] going to go into a land of bondage
[1:11:03] before he told him the prophecy before
[1:11:07] it ever happened that's right and he
[1:11:09] says but at the end of the 400 years I
[1:11:13] will deliver amen with a strong and
[1:11:16] mighty hand can you say Amen now this
[1:11:20] Prophet was saying amen you you got to

[1:11:35] come judgment is
[1:11:40] inevitable judgment has to
[1:11:44] come there's no way around it
[1:11:48] judgment must come because the Earth has
[1:11:52] spurned the mercy of of

[1:11:59] prophet and he says I'm going to bring
[1:12:02] you Deliverance apply that

[1:13:44] token has got to be
[1:13:47] applied right
[1:13:50] now it's not the chemistry of the blood
[1:13:54] as it was on that day when they applied
[1:13:56] when they painted the blood on the
[1:13:58] doorpost in the
[1:14:00] L but you see that was a that was a
[1:14:05] woolly

[1:27:47] come where the token must be there if
[1:27:50] this church ever expects to remain alive
[1:27:51] and until Jesus comes the token will
[1:27:55] have to be here he's talking to the
[1:27:58] brandom Tabernacle if this church
[1:28:01] expects to be existing and
[1:28:04] Alive okay it's going to have to have
[1:28:08] the token life all
[1:28:12] right amen well praise the Lord token
[1:28:16] life is more than just living a good
[1:28:18] life buddy that is called
[1:28:23] sanctification sanctification is when
[1:28:26] you quit your sinning sanctification is
[1:28:30] when you decide that God's word is more
[1:28:33] important than you sanctification is
[1:28:36] when you left drugs and alcohol and you
[1:28:39] left sin behind that's the second stage
[1:28:43] of Grace that's right but the token
[1:28:48] life is where the life of God the very
[1:28:52] life of rapture is dwelling in
[1:28:56] you and that perfect life of
[1:29:01] Christ I'm no longer mine but I'm
[1:29:04] his it's no longer about me but it's
[1:29:07] about him it's no longer about what I am
[1:29:11] it's God thy will be done I do not my
[1:29:16] meat is not to do my own will my meat is
[1:29:19] to do the will of the
[1:29:22] father amen
[1:29:26] well Hallelujah I was hoping it'd be a
[1:29:29] little bit more shouting this morning
[1:29:31] but
[1:29:32] hallelujah amen now I want you to pain
[1:29:35] yourself amen don't be going to sleep on
[1:29:38] me yet this is this I I I want to tell
[1:29:40] you the anointing is here this morning
[1:29:43] praise the Lord the hour has come where
[1:29:47] the blood the token must be there amen
[1:29:51] it says in this church if this church
[1:29:52] ever exists expects to remain alive
[1:29:55] until Jesus comes the token will have to
[1:29:58] be here you he he goes on and says you
[1:30:01] you you'd better really have the token
[1:30:03] shining but the hour is here for the
[1:30:06] Exodus and this time we're going to a
[1:30:09] Promised Land the promise of eternal
[1:30:12] life this token this token the holy
[1:30:14] ghost shows that Jesus has met every
[1:30:17] requirement for us that we are in our
[1:30:20] nature Fallen Sons of God and we have no
[1:30:23] power within us we have no life within
[1:30:25] us we are Fallen race of people from
[1:30:27] Adam but when we can see when we can
[1:30:30] display the token the word a and we
[1:30:33] become the same shows that Jesus Christ
[1:30:36] has met the requirement for our sin and
[1:30:38] death and has displayed his token within
[1:30:40] us oh how simple it can be you are
[1:30:46] condemned you you we are condemned we're
[1:30:49] all condemned there is no way to save
[1:30:51] our ourselves God sent us a token he
[1:30:54] killed his son at Calvary for us and the
[1:30:56] life that was in that blood that was
[1:30:58] shed at Calvary has come back to be a
[1:31:01] token upon us can you say
[1:31:06] Amen now the first church had
[1:31:10] served their time under the Son of
[1:31:15] God under the the the Son of God which
[1:31:19] brother brandham would say would be the
[1:31:20] Holy Ghost
[1:31:22] interceding for the seven Church
[1:31:25] ages you mind it would be the spirit
[1:31:29] that was in Christ and amen that Spirit
[1:31:32] of intercession and Romans 88:9 says the
[1:31:36] spirit amen if you want to go and put
[1:31:38] that up there sister keys this the the
[1:31:41] spirit man uh Romans 89 but you are not
[1:31:45] in the flesh but in the spirit of Christ
[1:31:46] will in you it so be that Spirit uh now
[1:31:50] if any man have not the spirit of Christ
[1:31:52] he is none of his uh I think it's 26 I'm
[1:31:55] sorry sister Keith am man the 26th
[1:31:59] verse likewise the spirit also helpeth
[1:32:02] our infirmities for we
[1:32:04] know uh not what we should pray for as
[1:32:07] we ought but the spirit itself maketh
[1:32:09] intercession with groanings brother
[1:32:11] brandham taught that the Son of God that
[1:32:15] Christ has amen the spirit of Christ is
[1:32:20] down here amen living his life
[1:32:23] interceding for us throughout the church
[1:32:27] ages amen and but he also said that the
[1:32:31] son of man was that original anointing
[1:32:34] that was upon
[1:32:36] Christ and that church that first church
[1:32:39] before amen as we have pointed out to
[1:32:43] you before The Seven Ages even began
[1:32:46] there was that Pentecostal church at the
[1:32:48] beginning man that God deemed perfect he
[1:32:52] didn't even have anything to say against
[1:32:54] it now am man as we have mentioned here
[1:32:58] a time or two in the last couple
[1:33:00] Wednesdays is it wasn't that there was
[1:33:03] the not the human element there were
[1:33:04] devils in when Jesus crowd in Jesus
[1:33:07] church there was a Judas right there
[1:33:09] when when when Jesus was on the earth
[1:33:12] amen and and and but that church was
[1:33:15] free that first church amen was under
[1:33:18] that same son of man anointing the L had
[1:33:22] been slain and God had come back upon
[1:33:25] that church amen they were the perfect
[1:33:28] Church they were the anointed Church
[1:33:30] they were the Earthly body of the
[1:33:31] invisible God there were signs and
[1:33:34] wonders there were the power of the Holy
[1:33:36] Spirit upon them but after they fail
[1:33:39] they were still the church they were
[1:33:42] still his but they weren't walking in
[1:33:45] the fullness of the word anymore they
[1:33:47] weren't walking and they they
[1:33:49] substituted the government of the word
[1:33:52] in that early in that early age already
[1:33:55] left their first love to Christ the word
[1:33:57] and are now amen beginning to heed to to
[1:34:01] men and and the whisperings of the
[1:34:04] Antichrist amen by the time they got to
[1:34:06] that second age they were already
[1:34:09] following the leadership of men amen
[1:34:12] they were walking in the permissive will
[1:34:16] amen and not the perfect will the light
[1:34:19] of the word had been
[1:34:22] substituted
[1:34:24] righten now brother Brenham says with
[1:34:26] these principles in mind we start to
[1:34:28] trace the church through the various
[1:34:29] Seven Ages the birth of the church was
[1:34:32] at
[1:34:32] Pentecost as the first Adam was given a
[1:34:35] bride fresh from the hand of God and was
[1:34:38] undefiled for a brief span so was Christ
[1:34:41] the last Adam given a bride pure and
[1:34:45] freshed at Pentecost and she remains
[1:34:48] separate and undefiled for some time
[1:34:53] amen how long this continued we do not
[1:34:56] know but one day even as Eve was tempted
[1:35:00] and seduced by Satan so the church was
[1:35:03] contaminated by the entrance of an
[1:35:05] antichrist
[1:35:07] spirit amen at John 4 and3 it says there
[1:35:12] this is that Spirit of the Antichrist
[1:35:15] wherefore you have heard that it should
[1:35:17] come and even now is already in the
[1:35:19] world Amen Jes Jesus said concerning his
[1:35:23] his his bride in the first age
[1:35:24] Revelations 2 and 4 I have somewhat
[1:35:26] against thee because thou has left thy
[1:35:29] First Love remember somebody say
[1:35:33] remember therefore from whence Thou Art
[1:35:37] fallen and
[1:35:40] repent this
[1:35:41] church was that the church was in that
[1:35:45] first age already a fallen woman Satan
[1:35:49] had gotten to Eve before Adam even now
[1:35:53] as Satan seduces the church the bride of
[1:35:55] Christ before the marriage of the supper
[1:35:57] of the lamb and what specifically was in
[1:36:00] her midst that caused her to
[1:36:02] fall what but Revelations 2:6 the Deeds
[1:36:05] of the
[1:36:06] nicians already that first church had
[1:36:09] turned from following the pure word of
[1:36:11] God they turned from God's demands of a
[1:36:15] church absolutely dependent upon Him
[1:36:18] depending entirely upon God to fulfill
[1:36:20] his word from start to finish apart from
[1:36:22] Human government to nickon ISM which is
[1:36:25] an organiz organizing a a human
[1:36:28] government within the church which uh
[1:36:31] which as all governments do legislate
[1:36:33] for the people they they did exactly
[1:36:35] what Israel did and they took the
[1:36:37] expediency of the human government
[1:36:39] instead of the word and the
[1:36:41] spirit now this is the first church age
[1:36:44] they started out they started out under
[1:36:48] this son of man anoint it was God in
[1:36:54] flesh amen the son of
[1:36:57] man but now we go through the Seven Ages
[1:37:01] brother brandham says he is serving the
[1:37:04] church has served the
[1:37:06] term Seven Ages with the Son of
[1:37:10] God okay
[1:37:13] interceding it ain't perfect now I love
[1:37:17] this I love this listen to what brother
[1:37:20] brandham says death has already set in
[1:37:23] but he said death had entered how do we
[1:37:26] know do we not hear the voice of the
[1:37:29] spirit raised in that first age for all
[1:37:32] who will hear as he is
[1:37:34] calling to him that overcometh will I
[1:37:37] give to eat the Tree of Life in The
[1:37:39] Paradise of God the church had already
[1:37:42] emed too deeply in the the tree of death
[1:37:45] or the denominational false Vine whose
[1:37:47] end is the Lake of Fire and there was
[1:37:51] but but somebody say but there's no
[1:37:54] chair of them with a flaming swords to
[1:37:55] guard the tree of life now God does not
[1:37:59] depart from the midst of the church as
[1:38:02] he departed from Eden Eden oh no he will
[1:38:06] ever be in the midst of his church till
[1:38:11] the final age until that time he caused
[1:38:15] to all to come okay so so Adam when e
[1:38:23] fail all of a sudden there was no there
[1:38:26] was no
[1:38:28] mercy but when this church
[1:38:31] fail God says no I'm not leaving I'm
[1:38:34] walking in and out of those church I'm
[1:38:37] walking through the
[1:38:39] candlesticks come on he's not going to
[1:38:42] be as the son of man where it's the true
[1:38:47] word living in
[1:38:50] flesh
[1:38:52] but now it's going to be the Son of God
[1:38:53] that Holy Ghost that is amen amen
[1:38:57] anointing partial
[1:38:59] words an well praise the Lord amen now
[1:39:04] now they're they're they're they're
[1:39:06] entrapped and they've got all kinds of
[1:39:08] things going on but the holy spir spirit
[1:39:10] is still among them amen are y'all with
[1:39:13] me yeah are y'all with me amen that
[1:39:16] false Vine brother let me just give you
[1:39:18] another one F Church age is that first
[1:39:21] Vine getting a hold it was teaching that
[1:39:23] the rulership of men was right it taught
[1:39:25] that the church had to be governed it
[1:39:27] taught the control over the people but
[1:39:28] instead of doing it God's way they
[1:39:29] simply took the authority and invested
[1:39:31] all the spiritual power in their own
[1:39:32] hands and come out with a holy
[1:39:34] priesthood standing between God and the
[1:39:35] people they went right back to the old
[1:39:38] ER ironic system they become Antichrist
[1:39:42] for they deposed his media mediatorship
[1:39:46] and and imposed their own and God hated
[1:39:49] that amen man and and and and as he and
[1:39:53] as he goes he says the the Ephesians
[1:39:55] hated that and any True Believer will
[1:39:57] hate that too amen we would have to be
[1:40:00] Stone blind not to see that the same
[1:40:02] thing is at work All Through the Ages
[1:40:04] and right now it is worst of all what it
[1:40:07] was was organization they separated the
[1:40:09] people God's people are supposed to be
[1:40:11] one by one Spirit they're baptized into
[1:40:14] one body everyone is to be moved upon by
[1:40:17] the Holy Ghost and everyone is to be
[1:40:19] have the participation and the worship
[1:40:21] of God but men wanted to have
[1:40:23] preeminence so they took over the
[1:40:24] control and Bishops became archbishops
[1:40:26] and with imposing titles and and they
[1:40:29] bypassed the word of God and taught
[1:40:31] their own doctrines and they got the
[1:40:33] people to obey them until the time come
[1:40:35] that their way of worship did not in any
[1:40:38] way at all resemble the early days of
[1:40:41] Pentecost these Deeds were becoming were
[1:40:44] the beginning of apostolic succession
[1:40:46] the apostolic succession is one easy and
[1:40:48] quick step to the church membership as
[1:40:51] means to the saving grace and the Word
[1:40:52] was reduced to a Creed and the
[1:40:54] Antichrist by his Spirit was
[1:40:56] predominating the
[1:40:57] church and this is what the church has
[1:40:59] gone through for Seven
[1:41:02] Ages come on they had a
[1:41:09] chain yes
[1:41:11] sir they were dragging the chain
[1:41:16] alone they were back under the the the
[1:41:21] dogmas they were under the control the
[1:41:24] task Masters has been dragging this that
[1:41:28] they have been dragging the chains of
[1:41:30] the task Masters for seven Church ages
[1:41:33] that's right come
[1:41:35] on that's right Hallelujah y'all still
[1:41:37] with
[1:41:38] me
[1:41:41] amen but brother brandham says the token
[1:41:46] could not the token message could not
[1:41:50] have been preached till after the Seven
[1:41:54] Seals okay
[1:41:56] okay well praise the
[1:42:00] Lorden why it was no longer partial word
[1:42:05] giving a substitute lamb but now it is
[1:42:10] perfect word bringing Christ back to his
[1:42:14] church that's right
[1:42:18] amen well praise the Lord
[1:42:22] amen it was a partial word that gave a
[1:42:25] substitute lamb the Old Testament could
[1:42:27] only have a substitute lamb until the
[1:42:29] fullness of the word come in the body of
[1:42:30] Jesus
[1:42:32] Christ it was only a partial lamb it was
[1:42:35] a partial word it was a part thousands
[1:42:37] and thousands and thousands of lambs
[1:42:39] were killed for atonement the Old
[1:42:41] Testament believer was accepted by God
[1:42:45] through those
[1:42:46] Lambs
[1:42:48] okay but this partial word
[1:42:51] provided a substitute lamb and it only
[1:42:55] rolled sin ahead are you hearing
[1:42:58] me Hallelujah It could only roll sin
[1:43:03] ahead but when the perfect lamb came
[1:43:06] amen word made
[1:43:10] flesh word
[1:43:13] living when he when that lamb the bi
[1:43:16] well praise the Bible says that when
[1:43:18] Jesus was hanging on Calvary
[1:43:21] that the veil was rent in the temple it
[1:43:24] rent from top to bottom exposing The
[1:43:28] Mercy Seat allowing the people to see
[1:43:31] God is not
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:43:36] there God was hanging on
[1:43:41] Calvary now now here's the crazy thing
[1:43:45] Jesus died on the same day that they
[1:43:47] killed the
[1:43:49] lamb
[1:43:51] Jesus was hanging on Calvary the same
[1:43:55] day they took the woly
[1:43:57] lamb and the priest was going through
[1:43:59] the
[1:44:01] ceremony fixing to walk in behind the
[1:44:07] veil when the lightning of the pillar of
[1:44:10] fire came down and ripped that Veil open
[1:44:12] showing and exposing it all to the whole
[1:44:17] world that the blood on that Mercy Seat
[1:44:21] will not work anymore The Mercy Seat was
[1:44:24] now in the body of Jesus Christ and
[1:44:27] Jesus Christ was living on Calvary oh
[1:44:30] come on
[1:44:32] church now every it wasn't that all the
[1:44:35] B all of the past years were in vain it
[1:44:38] just that it finally came up to the
[1:44:40] perfect one
[1:44:45] right can you say
[1:44:48] Amen now when Jesus was
[1:44:52] crucified all of the Old Testament
[1:44:55] shedding of blood all of the Old
[1:44:57] Testament priesthood it stopped it done
[1:44:59] away it was it was finished it was done
[1:45:02] can you say Amen now watch Amen brother
[1:45:06] Brandon would say in the indictment he
[1:45:08] says now how appropriate it was now
[1:45:12] showing that Jerusalem was
[1:45:15] ceasing when it was in effect until that
[1:45:19] hour the blood of the Lamb was all right
[1:45:22] until that day but now at the
[1:45:25] crucifixion it
[1:45:26] changes the old system is done there is
[1:45:29] a new one and the lamb was at the
[1:45:33] sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb
[1:45:36] was on the grounds and they were
[1:45:38] condemning and doing the very thing that
[1:45:41] they had to
[1:45:45] do when they crucified the
[1:45:49] word
[1:45:51] the atonement came into effect now now
[1:45:54] y'all stay with me a little longer now
[1:45:56] good and then brother Bram stops and he
[1:45:58] says God be blessed for seeing this
[1:46:02] wonderful Heavenly light in this last
[1:46:05] day because the churches is doing the
[1:46:07] same thing today until the hour that the
[1:46:10] organization religion is condemning and
[1:46:13] prove to be sacrificing Christ's word
[1:46:16] and from then on comes the word and the
[1:46:20] word only from the Pascal lamb passed
[1:46:23] away Christ become our lamb at the day
[1:46:25] of crucifixion and the day that the do
[1:46:28] denomination crucified the word of God
[1:46:30] and accepted a Creed instead of the word
[1:46:32] that's the day when the word comes into
[1:46:34] full effect that's just been
[1:46:39] recently okay
[1:46:41] wow
[1:46:42] now are y'all understanding the blood
[1:46:45] I'm we're using Brother Brandon's using
[1:46:46] the types he's he's inditing this
[1:46:48] generation he's using the types type
[1:46:50] that the old Pascal
[1:46:51] lamb the old woy
[1:46:54] lamb had served its time
[1:46:57] until now he's making the
[1:47:00] point we have had the intercession for
[1:47:03] all seven ages not in the perfect will
[1:47:07] of God man's teachings and dogmas
[1:47:10] Revival and death Revival and death
[1:47:12] Luther came up brought a portion of the
[1:47:14] word brought a portion of the word but
[1:47:16] the Holy Spirit could not now it was in
[1:47:19] it was in the it was in the beginning
[1:47:21] stages but it was not the
[1:47:25] original okay the original Pentecost was
[1:47:28] the church that God had in mind all
[1:47:31] right now it's stumble now it's just
[1:47:35] stumble we've had all of these

[1:49:30] anointing rested upon
[1:49:33] Isaiah the anointing rested upon
[1:49:38] Jeremiah but that day and that anointing

[2:15:06] difference that there's just
[2:15:08] a that there's that that light has
