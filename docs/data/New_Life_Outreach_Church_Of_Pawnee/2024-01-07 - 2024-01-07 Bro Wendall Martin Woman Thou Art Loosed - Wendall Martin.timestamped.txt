[39:55] there was a woman woman which had a
[39:58] spirit of infirmity 18 years and was
[40:02] bowed together and could in no wise lift
[40:06] up
[40:06] herself and when Jesus saw her he called
[40:10] her to him and he said unto her woman
[40:14] thou wart loosed from thine
[40:16] infirmity and he laid his hands on her
[40:19] and immediately she was made straight
[40:21] and glorified God and the ruler of the
[40:24] synagogue answered with indign
[40:26] because that Jesus had healed on the
[40:29] Sabbath day and said unto the people
[40:33] there are six days in which man ought to
[40:35] work in them therefore come and be
[40:38] healed and not on the Sabbath day and
[40:42] the Lord answered him and said thou
[40:44] hypocrite do not each one of you on the
[40:47] Sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the
[40:50] stall and lead him away to
[40:52] watering and ought not this woman being
[40:55] a daughter of Abraham whom Satan hath
[40:58] bound Lo these 18 years be loosed from
[41:02] the bond of on the Sabbath day and when
[41:06] he had said these things all his
[41:09] adversaries were ashamed and all the
[41:12] people rejoiced for all the Glorious
[41:15] things that were done by
[41:18] him why don't we go to the Lord in
[41:20] prayer and as we pray let's

[42:55] Lord oh God we love you we thank you for
[42:59] your grace and your
[43:00] mercies and we give ourselves to you now
[43:03] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can
[43:06] the church say amen amen and amen God
[43:09] bless you you may be seated here this
[43:12] morning amen want to this this scripture
[43:17] stood out to me the other day as I was
[43:20] um looking as I as I read it and I
[43:24] thought you know I'm just I'm I'm is
[43:26] going to minister a little bit on it
[43:29] here this morning and and um amen this
[43:33] is a a powerful scripture first of all I
[43:36] want us to notice that um Jesus amen was
[43:41] in the church on on Sabbath day and so
[43:44] uh Jesus believed in going to church
[43:47] amen and uh amen uh he he was he says he
[43:53] was teaching in one of the synagogues
[43:55] and and uh Luke 4 4:16 says that Jesus
[44:00] had a habit of going to the church on
[44:03] the Sabbath day and um so Jesus believed
[44:07] in going to church and I I I I think
[44:09] it's a wonderful thing to be here in the
[44:10] church here this morning can you amen
[44:13] now we we see here that this woman had
[44:16] been bound by by this Spirit of
[44:19] infirmity for for a long time amen for
[44:23] 18 years and she could not lift herself
[44:27] up amen she couldn't stand up or
[44:32] wct she uh uh you know couldn't stand
[44:37] tall and and straight as as as that
[44:41] which is reckon to man's honor and I
[44:46] begin to think a little bit of of this
[44:48] scripture and as we as we deal with the
[44:52] uh the natural infirmity I also want us
[44:54] to look at the spiritual infirmities
[44:57] because amen I think sometimes the the
[45:01] spirit man can be a little um uh uh can
[45:06] can be bound as well amen can be uh
[45:10] bowled over as well she this woman could
[45:12] not could could not stand upright she
[45:17] amen she wasn't herself she didn't look
[45:19] herself she she was um um you know maybe
[45:24] maybe she
[45:26] you know looked um mean maybe she was
[45:30] dismissed by Messi a society as a misfit
[45:33] maybe amen but but regardless of where
[45:38] she was she had been doing this she had
[45:40] been this way for 18 years amen but she
[45:43] was still very
[45:46] valuable uh a human being amen God
[45:51] seeing something in her it it's
[45:53] something about her attracted Christ the
[45:55] Bible did didn't say that she came to
[45:57] the Lord the scripture says that Jesus
[46:01] called unto her and told her to come to
[46:04] him that's right I I I I want to I I I
[46:08] want to say this morning every human
[46:10] being is valuable to the
[46:12] Lord as as we just look over some of
[46:15] these verses here God's not willing that
[46:17] any should perish but that all should
[46:20] come to repentance amen I and I I I also
[46:23] think you should never judge the book by
[46:26] its cover amen I you know she she was
[46:31] just as precious uh uh human being as as
[46:35] as anyone else she was she had a spirit
[46:39] of
[46:40] infirmity man you know I think all life
[46:43] is precious I think Born life is
[46:46] precious unborn life is precious life is
[46:49] precious period amen that's the reason
[46:52] we don't believe in abortions and amen
[46:55] we we we we believe that any life that
[46:58] God has put here on this Earth we should
[47:01] honor that and we should be thankful to
[47:04] God Amen for for life because all life
[47:09] comes from
[47:10] God all life comes from God I I don't
[47:13] care whether you belong to this church
[47:14] or whether you belong to the Methodist
[47:17] Church or whether you belong to the
[47:18] Satan Church or whether you amen what
[47:20] church you belong to all life is
[47:24] precious to the Lord
[47:26] how many believes that amen you you you
[47:29] don't have to agree with me to to be
[47:31] precious with God I don't have to agree
[47:33] with you God loves humans God loves life
[47:39] God's the author of Life am amen no
[47:43] matter how you got here this morning you
[47:45] amen it it it doesn't matter it don't
[47:48] matter whether amen if you if you came
[47:51] from holy wedlock or or whether you came
[47:55] from a shack up I don't care how you got
[47:59] here this morning all life is precious
[48:04] to the Lord and God loves every one of
[48:08] you just the same amen I I I I I like
[48:12] that there there was something about her
[48:15] Affliction that attracted the that
[48:18] attracted the the attention of Jesus now
[48:22] here they are they're in church together
[48:25] amen Jes Jesus is up there teaching he
[48:27] sees this woman that is bound over that
[48:31] is so bold over she can't stand upright
[48:34] amen she had lost dignity she amen was
[48:38] embarrassed no doubt in the way that
[48:41] that that she she was some of the
[48:44] scholars says that amen she would go
[48:46] into convulsions and and and and and
[48:49] just shake so so badly there amen and
[48:53] and and yet Jesus in the in in the midst
[48:57] of the church service Jesus stops and
[49:01] talks to the woman that had an
[49:04] Affliction amen GE he's not trying to
[49:09] sidestep her he's not trying to say you
[49:12] know she needs to be put uh uh somewhere
[49:14] else because she's distracting the
[49:16] service she says he says won't you come
[49:19] up to the front row come on well praise
[49:22] the Lord amen I I I I'm thankful for
[49:25] that here this morning amen now look at
[49:28] this woman she was bound but the
[49:29] scripture says amen uh that she was a
[49:32] Believer she she was a Seed of Abraham
[49:36] she had come to church to and she kept
[49:40] her vows to Jehovah regardless of her
[49:44] condition she kept her position all of
[49:47] these years as a Believer believing amen
[49:51] uh in God knowing that the Affliction is
[49:53] not of God how many knows your
[49:54] Affliction is not not of God Amen those
[49:58] things that you battle with are not of
[49:59] God sickness is not of God demons are
[50:03] there trying to to bring sickness and
[50:06] and make Havoc of your of your spirit
[50:09] man well can you say man amen the
[50:12] scripture says there in verse 16 that
[50:15] Satan bound This Woman This Woman was
[50:20] bound by the the evil spirit a and he
[50:24] called her to him amen I I like that
[50:28] song he came looking for me praise the
[50:31] Lord amen he the great Creator had seen
[50:35] value in this in this precious woman now
[50:39] the ruler of the synagogue as we just
[50:41] sort of lay out a a a little bit of a
[50:44] platform here amen uh he was very
[50:47] indignant he he uh you know religious
[50:51] leaders can sometimes be your worst
[50:53] enemy amen they they won't go in as
[50:56] Jesus said they amen there in Matthew 23
[50:58] and 13 it says be wo unto you scribes
[51:01] and Pharisees Hypocrites for you shut up
[51:03] the Kingdom of Heaven against men for
[51:05] you neither go in yourselves neither
[51:08] suffer ye that uh them that are enter uh
[51:12] entering to go in and and so we can see
[51:15] uh uh that these that the scripture says
[51:17] that the ruler was was indignant he was
[51:21] he was uh amen upset that Jesus would
[51:24] even heal on the Sabbath day he was he
[51:27] was Hallelujah you know I think church
[51:30] should be the place where the Miracles
[51:32] take
[51:33] place I I think that I think church
[51:36] should be the place that amen where the
[51:38] power of God is believ well can you say
[51:40] Amen you know I I I want to be known as
[51:43] one of those preachers that that that
[51:45] that can hold the two-handed sword how
[51:47] many wants to be one of those kind of
[51:48] Believers that that that that is known
[51:51] to hold a two-edged sword a two-handed
[51:53] sword amen not just puts you foot with
[51:55] the devil and say well amen you just got
[51:57] to live in your Affliction and you just
[51:59] got to live that way I say that God is
[52:02] big I say God's our healer I say God's
[52:06] our deliverer amen can you say amen I
[52:10] believe that God Is A Healer but you see
[52:13] these men were too sissified to pick up
[52:15] that who two and handed sword brother
[52:17] Brandon would say many of those men
[52:20] don't know what it what it is to pack a
[52:22] sword and and get out there a two-handed
[52:24] sword on the front line they they don't
[52:27] know what a battle is to fight against
[52:29] the enemy they get out here and they're
[52:32] smart men theologians brilliant men who
[52:34] can stand with put a sermon out there H
[52:38] that's just so touched up and and also
[52:40] can talk with such language till Webster
[52:43] would hardly know what they're saying
[52:45] they've got degrees in the college and
[52:48] that's all right when you're talking to
[52:50] an intellectual group but but that's
[52:53] looking for a church home but when
[52:55] you're out there on the Battlefront
[52:57] those men want more than that they've
[53:00] got to see the power of almighty God in
[53:05] manifestation or you'll never sell it to
[53:07] them they've got to see Christ in his
[53:12] resurrection yes sir can I hear a yes
[53:14] sir here this morning amen those men
[53:17] don't know what it is to hold a
[53:19] two-ended sword to fight Toe to Toe with
[53:22] the Enemy there where demons and witch
[53:24] doctors and everything else standing
[53:26] there challenging you on every hand
[53:28] where men who read the Bible say if
[53:31] Jesus is the same yesterday today and
[53:34] forever let me see the Holy Spirit
[53:37] perform like it did back there you can't
[53:40] take a scholarship and do that it takes
[53:43] the power and resurrection of Jesus
[53:46] Christ to produce that well can you say
[53:49] amen amen so we're not here this morning
[53:52] I don't think we should come to church
[53:53] just to come and have an intellectual
[53:55] Gathering I I I think the power of the
[53:58] Holy should Spirit should be here on the
[54:01] Sabbath day amen I think I think when we
[54:04] come to church we should expect the
[54:06] supernatural in our church I I think
[54:09] when we go to prayer we should expect
[54:11] the supernatural to be with us in our
[54:13] prayer amen now now now Jesus turns
[54:17] around and he's a little he's a little
[54:19] gets a little indignant himself amen and
[54:22] he says you hypocrite amen why shouldn't
[54:24] this woman be loosed Amen on the Sabbath
[54:28] day she she's been tormented by the evil
[54:31] spirit she's she's been amen oppressed
[54:34] for 18 years Satan has bound this woman
[54:38] and here she is the Seed of Abraham this
[54:41] woman is needing rest from the
[54:44] oppression of the enemy this woman is
[54:47] needing Amen to lay it down lay down
[54:51] amen her burden and and to understand
[54:53] that God is is the Healer and I have
[54:57] come to loose her and to set her
[55:01] free amen oh Hallelujah I I I say here
[55:05] this morning what is the church all
[55:07] about amen is it not are we not the
[55:10] bride body of Jesus Christ now I know
[55:13] this is going to be a little simple here
[55:14] this morning I I just want to try to
[55:17] build some Faith here amen because if
[55:20] we're the bride body of Jesus Christ it
[55:22] doesn't mean that that we are free from
[55:25] sickness and we're free from Affliction
[55:27] it doesn't mean that Satan isn't going
[55:30] to attack Us in fact amen if you are a
[55:34] Believer Satan is going to attack you
[55:37] Satan is going to try amen to to to get
[55:41] you to lay down your weapon and I I I I
[55:44] think church services are a wonderful
[55:46] thing amen what what is this about oh
[55:48] can you say amen I I I pray amen that
[55:51] the church never becomes a lodge to
[55:54] where we're just here here uh on a
[55:56] weekly on a weekly Gathering and a lodge
[55:59] to where we just belong to a certain uh
[56:02] a certain belief but I I want God to
[56:04] always feel at home in our church I I
[56:08] want I now now remember Jesus comes to
[56:10] church amen where the he believes in
[56:13] going to church amen and you believe in
[56:16] going to church but Jesus believes in
[56:19] the power of of the Holy Spirit to set
[56:23] the captives free while in church amen
[56:27] amen amen to set those captives free
[56:30] Amen to break up you know you you you
[56:33] see we we we don't want it to be a song
[56:36] a poem and a and a sermon and a Sunday
[56:39] dinner on the grounds we we we are a
[56:43] Sanctified group The reason we come in
[56:45] on on these Sundays is is we are
[56:48] sanctifying ourselves we are gathering
[56:51] together we're we're we're Binding
[56:53] Together the body of Christ and we've
[56:55] been all week on the job we amen we we
[56:59] we've been raising our children we've a
[57:01] we we've gone through a lot of of things
[57:03] but but when we come to church
[57:05] hallelujah we're coming to meet together
[57:08] we're coming to speak Christ we're
[57:11] coming to bring our faith together we're
[57:14] coming to to see God to come down Among
[57:17] Us I I I I think today amen I'm thankful
[57:21] for one of the for these kinds of of of
[57:24] of sanctification ations and pulling
[57:26] ourselves together can you say amen amen
[57:29] Jehovah there in in in in Isaiah 58 and
[57:33] five he says is it is it uh such a fast
[57:36] that I have chosen a day for a man to
[57:39] afflict a soul is it to bow down his
[57:41] head as a bull rush to to spread
[57:43] sackcloth and Ashes under him wil thou
[57:46] call this a fast an acceptable day to
[57:49] the Lord is not this the fast that I
[57:52] have chosen to loose the bands of the
[57:54] the wickedness to undo the heavy burdens
[57:57] to let the oppressed Go free and that ye
[58:00] break every yoke what can you say amen I
[58:04] I think that's what God shows up to
[58:06] church for God shows up to church not to

[1:24:09] uh uh uh uh Proverbs
[1:24:13] 18 amen um something about a wounded a

[1:24:45] bars
[1:24:47] hallelujah amen oh yes it's it's the the
[1:24:52] it's it's stronger a brother offended is
[1:24:55] harder to be one than a strong
[1:24:58] City it's it's it's one that is can you
[1:25:02] say Amen but the loosening power of the
[1:25:06] blood of Jesus Christ that comes through
[1:25:08] the word of God now the blood has
[1:25:11] already and I'm not going to hold you
[1:25:12] long I know as brother murl says I know
[1:25:15] there's there's some that are aren't
[1:25:16] feeling here well here this morning but

[1:25:21] Covenant has all already been has
[1:25:24] already uh been spilled how many believe
[1:25:26] that 2,000 years ago amen but but the
[1:25:29] problem was the word is the only way you
[1:25:33] can get the blood brother Brandon put it
[1:25:35] like this he says the blood Veil is
[1:25:37] brought down through the preaching of
[1:25:39] the word so while the word is being
[1:25:42] preached the blood Veil comes down for
[1:25:44] you to be washed cleansed healed
[1:25:46] delivered set free can you say Amen but
[1:25:49] when it was bound the Holy Spirit was
[1:25:51] bound not behind the word it was bound
[1:25:55] amen by Creeds it was bound by dogmas
[1:25:58] the Holy Spirit the blood was still
[1:26:01] there amen but there was a wall of
[1:26:04] petition between you and your answer
[1:26:08] amen that wall of petition was there so
[1:26:11] it took the son of man to come back and
[1:26:15] bring the word back to life again amen
[1:26:20] it took God to on Earth Earth to reveal
[1:26:24] what he already spoke how do we know
[1:26:27] this is because when the word come in
[1:26:30] our day it discerned Hearts it discerned

[1:26:39] you can you say Amen what was this for
[1:26:42] to let you
[1:26:44] know that there was the son of man s o n
[1:26:50] the anointing of the son
[1:26:52] back on the Earth
[1:26:56] again and the
[1:26:58] discernment at the woman at the
[1:27:00] well and the man Christ Jesus the man
[1:27:05] who said woman thou art loosed is the
[1:27:08] same one that come in this

[1:27:12] seals and showed what Satan's been doing
[1:27:16] and saying woman thou art
[1:27:20] loosed thou
[1:27:24] now we see the same God that was back in

[1:27:43] church and just let our this preaching
[1:27:47] let the preacher preach and it's and and
[1:27:49] it's just going through the filter of a
[1:27:51] man's interpretation
[1:27:52] we we got to go back there's a real
[1:27:54] thinking man's filter and that's the
[1:27:56] faith of God to believe every word
[1:27:59] that's the real thinking man can you say
[1:28:01] Amen not just an intellectual giant but

[1:41:49] loosed I have a right to to believe
[1:41:52] that whether I've got a
[1:41:56] cold whether I'm fighting a big battle
[1:41:59] like dad's fighting with
[1:42:03] Parkinson's whether you're fighting

[1:42:37] nothing but the son of man must come
[1:42:41] before the

[1:44:14] him into the heaven now we are seated
