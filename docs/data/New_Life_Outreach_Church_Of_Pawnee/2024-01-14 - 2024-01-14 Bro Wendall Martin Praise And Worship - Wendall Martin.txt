you I was uh the other night I was sharing with brother wend my testimony of how I came to the Lord and I just feel maybe it will bless someone so we're going to give a short testimony and then I'll sing this song which um has been a blessing to me um when I was 16 I I grew up in the message and um we we had the P privilege of listening to tapes I'm from the Netherlands but I didn't meet the true Lord Jesus Christ that yet I didn't have a born again experience and I was praying God I said God if I I wanted to do something with my whole heart I said I don't want to just be a churchgoer I don't want to be just serving the lord because my parents taught me that I want to have a true experience of you and there was um a a little camp meeting it was uh it was just a small little youth meeting and it was in kind of like a forest area with some uh some D sand dunes and so one morning I got up early in the morning and I I just felt so burdened I needed to know God I needed to know if this message was true and if there was still a living God that is still the same yesterday today and forever because I didn't want to a message from 50 years back I wanted a living God now and I knelt down in the sand dunes and I poured my heart out to God and I said God if you're true please show me and at that time the Whirlwind came and came circling down and it was like God came to me and and and said don't look at what others do there's a true message and there's a true Living God and I I'll show you the way as long as you stand for me and live for me so you know sometimes I feel like you walk in the Lord gets like in a habit you know you go to church and you you know but sometimes God just needs to give you another touch so the song that I'm going to sing it's been a long time so bear with me I'm not a perfect singer but it's has been a blessing for me and I hope it will be a blessing to you [Music] well we need wisdom we need power and true love for each other we have said so many big but empty words so we come before your face asking for your grace bring your people to a State of Kingdom Life restore your bride [Music] again touch your people once [Music] again with your
