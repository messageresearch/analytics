[2:41] called Calary
[2:45] for there you die
[2:48] to purchase my redemption.

[33:43] I remember who I was.
[33:47] I was lost.
[33:50] I was blind.
[33:52] I was running out of time.
[33:56] But sin
[33:58] separated.
[34:00] The bridge was far too wide. But from
[34:05] the far side of the chasm,
[34:09] you held me in your sight.
[34:13] So you
[34:15] made a way
[34:17] across that great divide,
[34:21] left behind heaven's throne
[34:26] to build it inside.
[34:30] There at the cross, you paid the debt I
[34:36] owe. Broke my chains, freed my soul. for
[34:42] the first time I had old.
[34:46] And thank you Jesus for the blood
[34:52] of light.
[34:55] Thank you Jesus.
[34:58] You have washed me white.
[35:02] Oh thank you Jesus.
[35:06] You have saved my life.
[35:11] brought me from the darkness
[35:15] into glorious
[35:18] light.
[35:21] And you
[35:23] took my place,
[35:25] laid inside my tomb of sin.
[35:29] You were buried for three days, but then
[35:33] you walked right out again.
[35:37] And now death has no sting.
[35:41] And life has no end. For I have been
[35:47] transformed
[35:49] by the blood of the lamb.
[35:54] Thank you Jesus
[35:57] for the blood
[35:59] applied.
[36:01] Thank you Jesus.
[36:05] You have washed me white. Oh, thank you
[36:11] Jesus. You have saved my life.
[36:17] Brought me from the darkness into
[36:21] glorious
[36:23] light.
[36:26] And there is nothing stronger
[36:30] than the wonder working power of the
[36:34] blood.
[36:37] Oh, I know what it did for me. Oh,
[36:42] that calls us sons and daughters.

[39:14] in your midst. I'll be with you. been in
[39:16] you till the end of the world. Amen. As
[39:20] we ask the man of God to come this
[39:22] morning. Amen. Let's just sing this one
[39:25] more course and ask Sister Mary if not
[39:28] for grace. Amen.

[40:13] but now I've found

[40:28] offering. Where would I be? Where would
[40:30] I be?

[43:58] a long time and God just gave that baby
[44:01] to them and we are so excited. Amen.
[44:04] Well, I'm not going to go back over what
[44:06] Brother Merurl has already uh introduced
[44:08] everyone. We're just glad to have all of
[44:10] y'all today. Let's let's look in here
[44:12] before you have your seats. Let's look
[44:14] here in Job the 14th chapter. And we're
[44:17] going to read the first verse. And um
[44:21] uh I I uh seen brother Kevin drive by
[44:24] the house the other day and I said,
[44:26] "Hey, good to see that he's in town."
[44:28] And we we sure love Brother Kevin and
[44:31] and we're proud of him. I mean, he's
[44:33] he's flying those big old jets and and
[44:36] uh Amen.
[44:39] You wouldn't ever want me in a pilot
[44:40] seat. I promise. Amen. And uh but we're
[44:44] we're sure proud of you, Brother Kevin.
[44:45] And so good to have you here this
[44:47] morning. Amen. There in the book of Job
[44:50] the 14th chapter, first verse, it says,
[44:54] "Man that is born of a woman is of a few
[44:57] days and full of trouble. He comes forth
[45:01] like a flower and is cut down. He fleth
[45:05] also as a shadow and continues not."
[45:09] And does thou open thine eyes upon such
[45:13] and one and bring me into judgment with
[45:16] thee? Who can bring a clean thing out of
[45:19] an unclean? Not one. Seeing his days are
[45:23] determined, the numbers of his months
[45:25] are with thee. Thou hast appointed his
[45:27] bounds that he cannot pass.
[45:29] Turn from him that he may rest till he
[45:33] shall accomplish as an hireling his day.
[45:37] For there is hope of a tree, if it be
[45:40] cut down, that it will sprout again, and
[45:43] the tender branch thereof will not
[45:46] cease.
[45:47] Though the root thereof waxs old in the
[45:50] earth, and the stalk thereof die in the
[45:52] ground, yet through the scent of water,
[45:54] it will bud and bring forth bows like a
[45:57] plant. But a man dies and waste away.
[46:02] Yay, man giveth up the ghost. Where is
[46:05] he? As the waters fail from the sea and
[46:08] the flood decays and dries up,
[46:12] so man lies down and rises not till the
[46:16] heaven be no more. They shall not awake
[46:20] nor be raised out of their sleep. Oh,
[46:23] that thou wouldest hide me in the grave,
[46:25] that thou wouldest keep me a secret
[46:28] until thy wrath be passed. That thou
[46:30] wouldest to appoint me a set time and
[46:32] remember me. If a man dies, shall he
[46:35] live again? All the days of my appointed
[46:37] time will I wait till my change come.
[46:42] Amen. And I just want to take a simple
[46:44] thought this morning. My change is
[46:47] coming. Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[46:50] Father, we thank you for your divine
[46:53] grace.
[46:54] And as brother Merl was singing that
[46:56] song, where would I be? God only knows.
[47:01] But Lord, you've looked down through
[47:03] love and with your grace toward your
[47:07] your sons of God, your daughters of God
[47:10] that were in your mind before the
[47:12] foundation of the world, you have
[47:14] brought redemption to us. Father, we
[47:17] thank you for it now. Lord, I'm asking
[47:20] that you would give us grace this
[47:21] morning.
[47:23] Help me, Lord, to get myself out of the
[47:26] way so that your words can be spoke.
[47:29] Lord, use me, Lord.
[47:31] I pray that you will be with the
[47:33] congregation and that you will bless
[47:36] each and everyone that that we not just
[47:38] hearing words of a man but Lord let us
[47:41] hear your words this morning. Father, we
[47:45] love you. We thank you for it now in
[47:48] Jesus name we pray. Can the church say
[47:51] amen?
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[47:54] seated here this morning. Amen.
[47:59] I want to minister here this morning
[48:03] along this lines. My change is coming.
[48:07] Job was asking the question. Amen. And I
[48:11] think every wise man and woman ask that
[48:14] same question. Amen. When they find that
[48:18] there are creatures of time, Amen. They
[48:21] wonder what happens. Amen. When time
[48:25] ceases, what what what am I? who who is
[48:28] man and it seems like that has been the
[48:31] question of the ages. Uh I believe it
[48:33] was brother uh Harry that had had
[48:36] mentioned the question where did I come
[48:39] from and where am I going? Many books
[48:44] have been written and and theories have
[48:46] have come forth. There's the the theory
[48:48] of of of evolution you know the big bang
[48:51] theory. There's the uh you know larvae
[48:54] uh you know crawling out of the Nile
[48:57] River and amen and and here comes man.
[49:01] But yet we know that there is something
[49:03] about man that is of a higher order than
[49:07] amen than that. Some will say mortal
[49:10] life is all there is and that this this
[49:14] life is is all you've got. So you've got
[49:17] to live life to the fullest right now.
[49:21] But the Bible teaches us differently. It
[49:23] teaches us that there is some part of us
[49:27] that came from God. Amen. At the very
[49:31] beginning, there was something there
[49:34] that was with God eternally. Amen. And
[49:39] so Job was in despair as he was in the
[49:42] the greatest time of his life being a
[49:45] prophet, a great man of God. And and and
[49:49] yet here he is. He had lost his
[49:51] children. He had lost everything that he
[49:53] had owned. And now he's scraping boils
[49:56] off of his body. And he and he's he's
[49:58] he's sitting there in the in the ash
[50:01] heap and he's and he's he's he's asking
[50:03] the question, is is God mindful of me?
[50:07] Amen. Does God know where I'm at? Does
[50:10] God understand
[50:12] you know that that I am uh uh I I am
[50:15] going to the grave and it and it seems
[50:18] like amen I have no hope beyond this
[50:21] grave. And as he begin to question amen
[50:25] God comes and visits him there in the in
[50:28] the 38th chapter of Job and and and you
[50:30] know and I'm just going to read it to
[50:31] you there in the first verse.
[50:33] He says, "And then the Lord answered Job
[50:35] out of the whirlwind and said, Who is
[50:38] this that darkeneth uh counsel by words
[50:42] without knowledge? Gird up thy loins
[50:45] like a man, for I will demand of thee,
[50:47] and answer thou me. Where was thou when
[50:50] I laid the foundations of the earth?
[50:53] Declare, if thou hast an understanding,
[50:57] who has laid the measures thereof, if
[50:59] thou knowest? Who hath stretched the
[51:02] line upon it? Whereupon are the
[51:05] foundations thereof fastened? Who laid
[51:08] the cornerstone thereof? When the
[51:10] morning stars sang together, and all the
[51:14] sons of God shouted for joy. Now he is
[51:18] talking to this prophet. Amen. And he's
[51:21] letting him know, now listen. Amen.
[51:23] Before the foundations of the earth,
[51:27] there were some sons and daughters that
[51:30] were in my mind. They were with me
[51:33] eternally. Amen. Before the world ever
[51:37] began, in my mind, I I I want to tell
[51:40] you here this morning, there is an
[51:42] eternal quality to God's elect people.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's people, God's sons and
[51:48] daughters. Can you say amen? Amen.
[51:51] There. Amen. Job, you were e eternally
[51:55] in my mind. You know, it reminds me of
[51:57] the scripture there there in in Hebrews
[51:59] the 4th chapter that the works were
[52:02] finished. Amen. Before the foundation of
[52:05] the world. A and so the Bible is
[52:07] declaring to to to God is declaring to
[52:11] Job, amen, that that this human
[52:14] experience or this Amen. this finite
[52:18] lifestyle of of of sickness and decay
[52:21] and sin a and death there there is a
[52:26] resurrection there there is a promise
[52:29] you came from God and you're going to go
[52:32] back to God amen there in Job the 19th
[52:36] chapter and the and the 25th verse he
[52:39] says for I this is the same one asking
[52:42] the question now now he is saying I know
[52:45] my redeemer redeemer lives and he shall
[52:48] stand in the latter day upon the earth.
[52:51] And though amen after my though after my
[52:55] skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
[53:00] flesh shall I see God. Amen. What was
[53:04] God revealing to him? Is there is
[53:07] something about you. There is something
[53:09] in you that is of an eternal quality.
[53:13] God's eternal seed was with Well, glory
[53:16] to God. How many believes that God is
[53:18] all knowing? How many knows God's got a
[53:21] divine plan? God's got a divine purpose
[53:24] for every one of you in your lives.
[53:27] Amen. I I I just want to tell you this
[53:29] morning. I want to bring some news to
[53:32] you. Amen. That God's got some people
[53:35] that has been in his mind for a very
[53:37] long time. And there is no trial.
[53:40] There's no circumstance. There is
[53:42] nothing that can ever separate you from
[53:45] God's divine love toward you.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You study the botney life. Amen.
[53:54] And nature has an Easter when the flower
[53:58] comes up. Amen. On Easter time and it
[54:01] begins to bud, it begins to bloom. And
[54:04] amen. The fragrance of the roses as they
[54:07] come out. Amen. And it's a glorious
[54:10] time. It goes through the spring and the
[54:13] summer and then things begin to as as as
[54:16] the the fall time begins to come, the
[54:19] little petals begin to fall off, the the
[54:22] flowers begin to to uh uh fade away and
[54:26] before you know it, amen, winter comes
[54:28] and the flower is is dead. And you look
[54:31] at the rose bush there, it's dead. You
[54:34] look at everything and it's dead. But
[54:37] you see, there is eternal life or there
[54:40] is h a perpetual life down in the seed
[54:44] of that plant. Amen. It may be dead, but
[54:48] it's not dead. It may be over, but it's
[54:52] not over. There's going to come an
[54:55] Easter time for the lily. There's going
[54:58] to be an Well, I just want Amen. you to
[55:00] know you might have some gray hair and
[55:03] you may be on a cane or a walker this
[55:05] morning. Amen. And you may be getting
[55:07] old, but if you possess eternal life,
[55:11] amen, there is an Easter for you. There
[55:16] is a springtime for you that will come
[55:19] back up in the spring again. Well, can I
[55:22] hear a great big amen?
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You look there at the
[55:27] sun. The sun rises up as a little baby
[55:30] in the morning. Amen. As it's coming up
[55:33] from the east. Amen. at 10:00 it's in
[55:36] its teenage years a noon day. Amen. It's
[55:40] in a it's in its full strength and the
[55:43] afternoon. Amen. It it it's in the
[55:46] middle age and the evening time it
[55:48] begins to go back down. Is that the end
[55:51] of the sun? Is is this the end of it?
[55:54] Amen. We don't see the sun anymore. All
[55:57] we see is darkness. All we see is Amen.
[56:01] You You can't see the sun. Amen. Where
[56:03] did it go? Surely it's not gone forever.
[56:07] Well, can you say amen? God has a
[56:10] purpose for the sun. So, it has to come
[56:14] back up in the morning season. It'll
[56:16] rise back up. What does that speak of,
[56:19] friends? It speaks that when this mortal
[56:23] life is over and you go down in the
[56:27] grave, you are going to rise again, a
[56:31] brand new body. Well, praise the Lord.
[56:34] You may be staggering a little bit right
[56:36] now. Amen. You may be feeble right now,
[56:39] but you have got, Amen. the promise of a
[56:43] resurrection. And in your flesh, you
[56:46] shall see God again.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] The believer was witnessing to a really
[56:56] important man one day, and as they sit
[56:58] around a little bonfire,
[57:01] Amen. and he he just put some more logs
[57:04] on the fire and he and he was he was
[57:06] trying to explain the shortness of this
[57:08] life and he man a little sparrow had had
[57:11] flown into the light of the of of the of
[57:15] the the you know out of the night into
[57:17] the light and and then as a sparrow flew
[57:20] in a man he just flies right back off
[57:22] into the night and and the and the
[57:24] Christian asks the man he says where did
[57:28] he go and where did where did he come
[57:31] come from? And where did he go? He come
[57:34] from somewhere and he went somewhere.
[57:37] Are you hearing me? You see, Jesus says,
[57:40] "I come from God and I go back to God."
[57:45] And as a believer, you can stand here
[57:48] and say, "I came from God and I'm going
[57:54] back to God."
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that this current present
[58:01] life, this life. Amen. This world that
[58:04] we live in cannot exist forever. Amen.
[58:08] It is it is controlled by sin and death.
[58:12] Amen. And I just want to say the moment
[58:13] that you're born, you start to die.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I I see some of these uh
[58:19] beautiful girls here and and some of you
[58:22] young people are in the prime of your
[58:24] life. Amen. You better take a picture
[58:26] while you can because I'm telling you,
[58:29] you're dying. Hallelujah. We don't want
[58:31] to hear that. Amen. And and and you
[58:33] know, you guys wouldn't believe it, but
[58:35] at one time I was good-look. Hallelujah.
[58:38] At one time, I had hair. At one time I I
[58:42] didn't have these wrinkles. At one time
[58:44] there, Amen. I I I didn't Well, glory to
[58:48] God. But you see, as you everything in
[58:51] this life, Amen, is is full of decay.
[58:55] You go buy a car today, Amen. and it's
[58:58] going to rust and decay tomorrow. You
[59:00] can go buy a brand new househ and before
[59:02] you know it, you're going to have to put
[59:04] some more shingles in. You're going to
[59:05] have to put some more paint on it.
[59:07] You're going to have to replace the
[59:08] carpet. There is nothing here in this
[59:12] life that is eternal. There is nothing
[59:15] internal. There is not one thing in this
[59:17] life that you can put your hand upon,
[59:20] your finger upon and say this is
[59:22] eternal. Amen. If it comes today, it
[59:25] will go tomorrow.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. This life there
[59:30] there's so many people that build upon
[59:33] this life. But listen friends, we don't
[59:35] want to put stock in this life. We want
[59:38] to put stock in that life that we came
[59:42] from.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; The life, that eternal life. Can you say
[59:46] amen?
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. This life is full of wars and
[59:50] strife. Hallelujah. I just read a little
[59:53] article today. You know, we we
[59:54] understand that the the Russia has met
[59:56] with the with with the US and and then
[59:59] Ukraine and the and and the other
[1:00:01] leaders have met and they're trying to
[1:00:03] find peace. And read an article this
[1:00:05] morning that now Russia is also having a
[1:00:07] peace summit over there with China.
[1:00:09] Amen. And they're talking and everyone
[1:00:11] is scared to death. Amen. They're
[1:00:13] they're wondering which way is going to
[1:00:15] be. Amen. And we we we look at our
[1:00:17] administration and so many things
[1:00:19] changing and so many things going on.
[1:00:22] Amen. We we wonder what's tomorrow going
[1:00:24] to hold. What's the next administration
[1:00:26] going to be? Amen. Friends, I just want
[1:00:29] to tell you there is nothing that you
[1:00:32] can put your hope in in this life. But
[1:00:36] there is a there is a promise and that
[1:00:40] is through Jesus Christ.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:00:45] Amen. There's lords and peasants.
[1:00:47] There's rich and there's poor. There's
[1:00:49] dividing and conquering. Amen. This old
[1:00:52] earth is aching. It's groaning. It's
[1:00:55] longing. Amen. For the sons of God. Can
[1:00:58] you say amen?
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; But you see, this is not the way that
[1:01:04] God intended it to be.
[1:01:07] Amen. When God created this earth, he
[1:01:11] created this earth for man to live in
[1:01:14] it. Adam to have authority over it, for
[1:01:18] mankind to walk and to live in harmony
[1:01:21] with God and with one another, to live
[1:01:24] with no turmoil or regret. When God
[1:01:28] created this earth, he did not create
[1:01:31] this earth for wars and strife. He did
[1:01:35] not create this earth, amen, for for you
[1:01:38] to be bearing your grandmother or your
[1:01:40] mother or to be bearing your children.
[1:01:43] God created this earth, amen, for peace
[1:01:48] and harmony and eternal life
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; and joy and happiness. Well, can you say
[1:01:55] amen?
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it's it's been Listen, friends.
[1:01:59] Amen. We we I I buried way too many
[1:02:01] people as a minister. I have I preached
[1:02:04] too many funerals as a as a as a family
[1:02:08] member. Amen. I I I I've seen too many
[1:02:11] go too early. That's not God's
[1:02:15] intention. But you see, when man fell,
[1:02:19] Adam was the as the father of us all.
[1:02:22] Amen. Adam came and and he sold us into
[1:02:28] sin. Solded us into slavery. The Bible
[1:02:32] says, Amen. By one man, that's Romans
[1:02:35] 5:17.
[1:02:36] It says, "For if by one man's offense,
[1:02:40] death reigned by one, therefore the one
[1:02:43] by the offense of one judgment came upon
[1:02:46] all men to uh condemnation." Can you say
[1:02:50] amen? So, it's like it was like a a
[1:02:53] local businessman one time who had a who
[1:02:55] had a really good business here in town,
[1:02:57] but he loved to gamble. And uh he was
[1:02:59] over in Vegas and he man he he he
[1:03:02] thought that he was feeling he was
[1:03:04] feeling like a winner. Hallelujah. And
[1:03:06] and and uh he he he he he puts his whole
[1:03:09] business on the uh on the line. Amen.
[1:03:13] Well, he lost. And when he lost, he lost
[1:03:17] everything. He lost his whole business.
[1:03:19] He lost everything. And you see that's
[1:03:22] what Adam had done. He gambled. He
[1:03:24] played. and he lost and sowed every one
[1:03:29] of us into slavery.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Adam and Eve might might
[1:03:39] have lived for they might have lived for
[1:03:42] millions of years before before the
[1:03:45] fall.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Walk the Bible says they would walk with
[1:03:48] God every evening. God would come down
[1:03:49] in the cool of the garden cool of the
[1:03:51] evening and walk through the garden with
[1:03:53] them. Can you say amen? The Bible says
[1:03:56] that he walked right there. Amen. He
[1:03:58] named all of the animals. There was no
[1:04:00] no fear of Leo the lion. There was no
[1:04:03] fear of of anything. Everything was calm
[1:04:07] and pure and meek and righteous. Well,
[1:04:10] can you say amen? Amen. There was
[1:04:12] confidence because there was fellowship.
[1:04:14] But now, Amen. Why? They were made in
[1:04:17] the very word image of God. The Bible
[1:04:20] says he created God had created
[1:04:22] everything. In the first day, he said it
[1:04:24] was good. And the second day it was
[1:04:26] good. And the and the all the way up.
[1:04:28] And when God created man, on the sixth
[1:04:30] day, he said it is very good. Very good.
[1:04:34] He made man in his image as a miniature
[1:04:37] God to rule and have dominion and
[1:04:40] authority over the earth. But now when
[1:04:44] sin came in, now man is running from Leo
[1:04:48] the lion. Now man is running from the
[1:04:50] storm. Now man is hiding from God. Now
[1:04:53] man is finding himself in death. Now man
[1:04:56] is finding himself. Matters of fact,
[1:04:58] Amen. Eve's uh uh uh uh Eve's son, Amen,
[1:05:02] killed his very own brother.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; They're outside of the garden. There's
[1:05:12] no harmony.
[1:05:13] They've lost their fellowship with God.
[1:05:16] Now there's angels with flaming swords
[1:05:19] of fire guarding the tree of life. Oh my
[1:05:22] goodness. Can you think about it? Amen.
[1:05:25] Can you imagine? Could you imagine Adam
[1:05:28] and Eve walking up to the garden gate
[1:05:31] with all the memories? Can you imagine
[1:05:34] Adam and Eve walking up to the garden
[1:05:35] gate? Amen. Looking over past those
[1:05:38] swords of fire and remembering what it
[1:05:41] was when they walked with God and
[1:05:43] fellowship with God. Amen. and had
[1:05:45] communion with God. But now here they
[1:05:48] are in their regrets. Here they are.
[1:05:51] Amen. They have messed up. They have
[1:05:53] Amen. They have sinned. Here they are.
[1:05:56] Their very own son has just killed his
[1:05:58] brother. Amen. Here they are. They're
[1:06:02] just sitting there at the gates. And all
[1:06:04] they have is the memory of yesterday.
[1:06:07] And I just want to tell you something
[1:06:09] today. Amen. Friends, uh we we we all
[1:06:13] have those regrets. We all have those
[1:06:16] things in our life that we can look back
[1:06:18] on and say, "God, how how it it it it
[1:06:22] just tears our minds up." Amen. Many of
[1:06:24] us, amen, wake up at night in cold sweat
[1:06:27] of something we done or something that
[1:06:29] happened to us because this life is full
[1:06:32] of sin and regret and death and sorrow.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:40] Death at end. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:06:44] I I liken it to a to a man or to a maybe
[1:06:47] even to a beast. Let's take a lion.
[1:06:51] Amen. That has been captured.
[1:06:53] And this lion has been placed into into
[1:06:56] a cage. Now, he's used to being out
[1:06:59] there in the in in the wild. He's the
[1:07:02] king of the jungle, but now he's in a
[1:07:04] cage. Could you imagine that lion
[1:07:07] walking from end to end going from Amen
[1:07:10] the bar to bar amen coming back and
[1:07:12] forth and he's roaring with everything
[1:07:15] that he's got. I can imagine that being
[1:07:17] Adam and Eve. Amen. Knowing what they
[1:07:19] had and now they're in the bondage of
[1:07:21] sin. Now they're in the bondage of
[1:07:23] death. Now they're in the bondage of
[1:07:25] regret. And that line is wanting to get
[1:07:27] but he can't break out of the bars. Yet
[1:07:29] he can't break loose. He wants to be
[1:07:31] free. He was created to be free, but now
[1:07:34] he's in the bars.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; He's not in his original condition.
[1:07:47] Now you say, "Now what? Where? Where?
[1:07:48] Where? Where are you going?"
[1:07:52] You You listen to me. We can grow
[1:07:54] content
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; living behind the bars.
[1:08:03] God's created you to be an overcomer.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; God created you to overcome all
[1:08:11] principalities, all devils, to overcome
[1:08:14] everyone. Are y'all hearing me?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; But when Eve sold us in, Adam sold us
[1:08:21] in. Amen. It's It's like that lion. If
[1:08:25] that lion were to stay in that cage and
[1:08:27] he was to breed again and then his
[1:08:29] offspring, Amen. the first generation,
[1:08:31] the second generation, the third
[1:08:33] generation before the by the time you
[1:08:34] get to that third and fourth generation.
[1:08:37] Now you've got a lion that's just a
[1:08:38] little pycat. He ain't he he's never
[1:08:40] been out of the free out in the free
[1:08:43] world. He's never been outside of the
[1:08:45] bars. He's He doesn't know what it is.
[1:08:48] He is now. Amen. He's been born in
[1:08:51] captivity. And that's where you are.
[1:08:54] Amen. We've been born in sin. We've gone
[1:08:56] through life. Amen. It's just a It's
[1:08:58] just a common practice. We're all born,
[1:09:01] Amen, in the bars of sin and death. We
[1:09:04] are all born defeated. We are all born,
[1:09:07] but that's not the way it was in the
[1:09:09] beginning. That's not the way that God
[1:09:11] created it. Well, can you say amen?
[1:09:14] Amen. But I want to tell you something
[1:09:16] today. God's never lost one of his sons.
[1:09:21] And God has got a promise. I'm going to
[1:09:24] restore. I'm going to find. I'm going to
[1:09:27] bring my sons back. Can you say amen?
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:35] It's sad when you see humanity satisfied
[1:09:41] with just the mediocrity of life,
[1:09:44] satisfied with just having a family,
[1:09:47] satisfied with just go having a job,
[1:09:50] satisfied with a new car.
[1:09:53] Amen.
[1:09:54] When God has called us to eternal
[1:09:56] things.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] God's not called us to be church
[1:10:04] members. God's called us to soar in the
[1:10:06] heavens.
[1:10:08] Amen. I heard the story of a of an eagle
[1:10:11] that a man that had been captured and it
[1:10:14] was in bars and they they they had just
[1:10:17] remember brother Brandham had just uh uh
[1:10:19] uh walked in as as they were as as this
[1:10:22] eagle. Amen. Would he he would he would
[1:10:25] get back as a large it was a large cage
[1:10:27] and Amen. and he would he would he would
[1:10:29] just sit there and stare out past the
[1:10:32] bars and to the skies. He would he would
[1:10:34] sit out there just Amen. and just dream
[1:10:36] of where he used to fly and what he was
[1:10:39] and he'd look around him. Amen. He would
[1:10:42] look up and and and they said that he
[1:10:44] would get his feathers all ruffled up
[1:10:46] and together and would take offline and
[1:10:49] hit those bars and knock him down. Amen.
[1:10:52] Unconscious. And he would lay there.
[1:10:54] Amen. Until he come back to himself and
[1:10:56] he would shake his shake his head and
[1:10:59] and he would come back again to the to
[1:11:01] the bar and and there he would, Amen.
[1:11:04] take off again. And he done it over and
[1:11:07] over until he had beat his feathers out.
[1:11:09] His his head was all bloody. Why?
[1:11:12] Because he was not created for a cage.
[1:11:16] He was created to soar in the
[1:11:19] heavenlies.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:22] There is something in a man.
[1:11:26] There is something in a woman
[1:11:28] that is crying out for more than what we
[1:11:32] have in this life. There is something
[1:11:35] about a son of God that is that is
[1:11:38] longing for something greater because
[1:11:42] you were created in the very image of
[1:11:44] God.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:52] But you see,
[1:11:54] even if one of those that have been held
[1:11:56] in captivity, they they and and and and
[1:12:00] generation after generation, they can't
[1:12:02] just go let them out because they'd know
[1:12:05] they'd never know how to survive in the
[1:12:07] wild anymore. They wouldn't know how to
[1:12:09] find hunt their own food anymore. Though
[1:12:12] the lion is the king of the jungle, yet
[1:12:16] he doesn't know how to be himself. Well,
[1:12:18] I'm I'm preaching to somebody here this
[1:12:20] morning. Can you say amen? But you see,
[1:12:23] we were all born in that condemnation.
[1:12:26] We were all born with that sin nature.
[1:12:29] We were all born under the domain of the
[1:12:33] law of sin and death. We were shaped in
[1:12:36] iniquity and in sin did our mothers
[1:12:38] conceive us. Well, can you say amen? The
[1:12:40] Bible says the wicked are estranged from
[1:12:44] the the womb and they go astray as soon
[1:12:48] as they are born.
[1:12:50] Yes, sir.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Sounds like a pretty pretty tough
[1:12:55] situation to be in.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; But fear not, little children,
[1:13:00] Papa. God knows everyone
[1:13:03] of his children.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; God knows every one of his sons and
[1:13:10] daughters.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; He knows his own. Well, can you say
[1:13:14] amen? Just like a mama eagle hunting her
[1:13:18] son. Amen. What we needed is someone
[1:13:21] with the ability to redeem us. We
[1:13:24] couldn't pull ourselves up by our own
[1:13:26] bootstraps. We couldn't put Well, glory
[1:13:28] to God. Too many go to a psychologist
[1:13:31] and Amen. and they they they go to uh
[1:13:34] you know, all of these doctors trying to
[1:13:36] to help their mind. Do you realize,
[1:13:38] Amen, that the number one illness today,
[1:13:41] Amen, is the sickness of the mind. They
[1:13:43] It is in the top three. Amen. Mental
[1:13:46] illness is in the top three of the
[1:13:48] world. Amen. People are going to doctors
[1:13:51] trying to find an answer, trying to find
[1:13:54] help, trying to be satisfied. But I just
[1:13:57] want to tell you, there is nobody that
[1:13:59] can satisfy your soul like the Lord
[1:14:02] Jesus Christ. God knows who you are and
[1:14:06] God has come to redeem you. Can you say
[1:14:09] amen?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, blessed be the name of
[1:14:16] the Lord. Now, here's the catch.
[1:14:20] We needed a kinsman.
[1:14:23] Now, we understand the mind of God
[1:14:26] through the Old Testament law that it
[1:14:29] had to be a kinsman who could redeem.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; So, if you were Amen. If in in the Old
[1:14:37] Testament law, Amen. And if if you had a
[1:14:41] debt that you had that you needed to pay
[1:14:44] and you did not have the money to pay
[1:14:46] that debt, then they could take you as
[1:14:50] their servant.
[1:14:52] Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; And there had to be only one that could
[1:14:55] redeem you would be somebody that was
[1:14:58] kin who and who was willing and able to
[1:15:02] pay the price to redeem you back.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:07] Well, I just want to tell you,
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve have had paid a price and
[1:15:12] sold us into sin. And there was no one
[1:15:15] human that was able to pay that price.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; We're all born sinners.
[1:15:21] There was no one that could redeem us
[1:15:24] back to God.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; It took a kinsman.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know. you know, you uh you
[1:15:35] you owe him you owed him uh $150
[1:15:40] and you ain't got it. Amen. So,
[1:15:44] according to the old the old law, Amen.
[1:15:47] you would now become a servant. Amen.
[1:15:50] And and and and there's only one way.
[1:15:53] There would have to be somebody and it
[1:15:55] couldn't be it couldn't be him. It
[1:15:56] couldn't be me because we're not kin. It
[1:15:59] would have to be Ken. And if your mama
[1:16:01] looked and said, Hope you are forever
[1:16:03] more a slave. Your dad's looking and
[1:16:06] saying, I don't know. I just don't know.
[1:16:09] And you're going
[1:16:12] and and and and now you see this was
[1:16:15] serious stuff. This was serious stuff.
[1:16:17] Hallelujah. We sinned. And the wages of
[1:16:20] sin is death. Humanity. There is no one
[1:16:24] in humanity that can redeem us.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; We're all sinners. We're all dying.
[1:16:30] There is not a human being that is able
[1:16:32] to pay the price. I want y'all to catch
[1:16:34] this picture. Hopefully, I'm not going
[1:16:35] too slow this morning. I want you to
[1:16:38] catch this picture. No one was able. But
[1:16:40] God looked down and the Bible says there
[1:16:43] were names written on his book before
[1:16:47] the foundation of the world.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; God knows every one of his children.
[1:16:57] Amen.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Can I blow your mind?
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; You were a son and daughter of God when
[1:17:04] you were still in the honky tonks.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; You were in the You were sons and
[1:17:10] daughters of God while you were in jail.
[1:17:13] You were sons and daughters of God.
[1:17:16] Amen. While you were committing
[1:17:17] adultery, you were fallen sons of God.
[1:17:21] We needed a redeemer. What is a
[1:17:24] redeemer? Redeemer means to redeem back.
[1:17:27] You're a slave. You need somebody to
[1:17:30] come pay the price and redeem you back
[1:17:34] to the family.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; You need Hallelujah. Isn't this a fine
[1:17:42] looking fella right here? He needed
[1:17:45] somebody to pay the price.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Redeem. Yes,
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; redeem means you were once free. You
[1:17:54] were always and I should be having
[1:17:55] brother Harry up there up here, but he's
[1:17:57] got his he's got his boy back there. And
[1:17:59] but dad was saying, I I love Paul. I'm
[1:18:03] going to pay the price for Paul even
[1:18:06] though he was stupid to do what he's
[1:18:08] done. Amen. I'm going to come and redeem
[1:18:12] Paul.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Give him a hand clap. Amen.
[1:18:20] redeem. We needed somebody to redeem us.
[1:18:23] We were sons of God, though we were born
[1:18:27] in the jail cell of sin and death.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not making that up. The Bible says
[1:18:35] your name, your name ain't put in the
[1:18:37] You ain't even put on the Bible. It
[1:18:38] ain't put in the book of life when you
[1:18:40] come to the altar. Your name was put in
[1:18:42] the book of life before the foundation
[1:18:44] of the world.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Is that not what the Bible says? God
[1:18:47] knows every one of you. You might not
[1:18:51] look like a son of God. You might not
[1:18:52] smell like a son of God. You might not
[1:18:55] act like a son of God. You might you
[1:18:57] might well praise the Lord. But God knew
[1:19:00] you.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; The only problem is
[1:19:07] Hallelujah.
[1:19:10] We needed a human
[1:19:13] and we needed a God
[1:19:16] because we were made in his the God
[1:19:19] image and we were placed in this body.
[1:19:23] Hallelujah. Go back and look in in in
[1:19:25] Genesis the first chapter. We were made
[1:19:26] in the image of God. The second chapter
[1:19:29] of Genesis, we were in a God created the
[1:19:32] body for man.
[1:19:35] That's why you'll never be able to
[1:19:37] satisfy the longing of your soul with
[1:19:39] alcohol. You'll never be able to satisfy
[1:19:42] the longing of your soul with drugs.
[1:19:44] You'll never be able to satisfy you s
[1:19:46] you find somebody that's constantly just
[1:19:48] fighting everybody that's just fighting
[1:19:50] just
[1:19:52] they're just going to fight. I don't
[1:19:54] care if it's a million dollars. They'll
[1:19:56] fight somebody. They'll find something
[1:19:58] wrong with it somehow
[1:20:02] because they're unsatisfied in their
[1:20:04] soul
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; and they need something to satisfy the
[1:20:08] soul. Are you hearing me?
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Humanity cannot help humanity. Preacher
[1:20:16] can't help humanity. I'm lost, too.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; I was born in sin, too.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. God looked down. God
[1:20:26] didn't have a body. He had sons. He had
[1:20:29] daughters, but no body.
[1:20:34] Tough situation.
[1:20:36] But God wasn't going to give up. You
[1:20:37] know what God done? How many can tell
[1:20:40] me? Can you tell me what God done? He
[1:20:42] had no body, but he needed one. So what
[1:20:44] did he do?
[1:20:52] Oh boy. I'm going to go to the girls.
[1:20:54] Hallelujah.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; What did he do?
[1:20:59] Oh boy.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Saved us. At least we got a response.
[1:21:06] How did he save us?
[1:21:13] I can hear you.
[1:21:16] That's Give her a hand clap. Created a
[1:21:19] body.
[1:21:24] They were saying, "What? What? What?
[1:21:25] What? What? What? What's going to
[1:21:26] happen?" And God says, "I'm there." They
[1:21:28] there in the book of Isaiah, the seventh
[1:21:30] chapter, he says, "I'm going to give you
[1:21:31] a sign, and it's going to be an
[1:21:32] everlasting sign. A virgin is going to
[1:21:36] conceive and bear a son."
[1:21:40] Isaiah 9:6 says, "And a son is given."
[1:21:44] Uh uh uh uh. Put that up there. Isaiah 9
[1:21:47] and six. Hallelujah. So I can I can I
[1:21:49] can do it right. child. For unto us a
[1:21:51] child is born, unto us a son is given,
[1:21:54] and the government shall be upon his
[1:21:56] shoulders, and his name shall be called
[1:21:58] wonderful. Someone say hallelujah.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Counselor,
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; uh the mighty God,
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; everlasting father,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; the prince of peace,
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; God was going to become a man in order
[1:22:16] to redeem us back.
[1:22:22] God was going to become a human being.
[1:22:27] It
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; you guys just aren't excited enough yet.
[1:22:31] God, the invisible God, created a body,
[1:22:36] moved in that body.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:44] Hallelujah.
[1:22:45] To redeem.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; To redeem.
[1:22:50] Now, it's not to buy. I can come and buy
[1:22:54] something from you. Hallelujah. I don't
[1:22:56] know what I'm going to buy, man. I've
[1:22:59] took everything out of my pocket. Hey,
[1:23:00] I've still got something in my pocket.
[1:23:03] Hallelujah.
[1:23:05] Now, if you wanted
[1:23:07] this,
[1:23:09] Amen. You got to buy it from me.
[1:23:12] Amen. Give me what you whatever you want
[1:23:14] to pay for it. Just give me some.
[1:23:17] Oh, give me your whole wallet. I'll take
[1:23:19] it.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:23:23] This is yours. You bought it. He never
[1:23:26] had it before.
[1:23:27] He bought it. It's his fair and square.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Right. All right. Let's go to the next
[1:23:35] scenario. Redeem. Redeem.
[1:23:40] If I have lost this
[1:23:44] and you find it and you've got it
[1:23:47] and I've been looking everywhere for it
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; and I'm looking and looking and looking
[1:23:53] and looking and look and I find, "Hey,
[1:23:56] that's mine." And you say, "Tough, I
[1:24:00] found it." And I say, "I really want
[1:24:03] it." And he says,
[1:24:06] "Let your money do the talking.
[1:24:11] Then I in order to get this back, he
[1:24:14] says, "Give me 10 bucks.
[1:24:17] If I want to redeem it back, I've got to
[1:24:22] pay the $10 in order to get it."
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Third scenario, and this is what
[1:24:33] literally happened.
[1:24:35] Satan seeing that Adam had the rule of
[1:24:39] the earth.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; And Satan and Satan says,
[1:24:44] "I'm going to take that man under my
[1:24:48] rule.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; I will use that man to fulfill my evil
[1:24:52] purposes."
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; So, we ain't talking about things. We're
[1:24:57] talking about humans. All right. Here we
[1:25:00] are. Here you come. Come on up here.
[1:25:02] Let's find you a beautiful girl.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're gonna take your sister
[1:25:07] that way. Hallelujah. Amen. All right.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Here's
[1:25:14] walking in harmony with God.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; I'm God
[1:25:21] in the cool of the evening. They're
[1:25:23] walking with God. They're fellowshipping
[1:25:25] with God.
[1:25:27] The old devil is looking and thinking,
[1:25:29] "I heard what God told him. God's told
[1:25:32] I've given you dominion over the fish,
[1:25:35] over the foul of the air, the be you.
[1:25:38] Planet Earth is yours, my children.
[1:25:41] It's yours.
[1:25:43] And that old sorry devil was listening
[1:25:46] and he's going.
[1:25:52] So Adam was over there taking a break.
[1:25:55] Amen. He was over there talking to Leo
[1:25:57] the line.
[1:25:59] And here off to herself. And then the
[1:26:02] old serpent comes up.
[1:26:05] You serpent, you
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; and the de and the devil used this
[1:26:09] serpent and started talking. God knows.
[1:26:13] She says, "I can't eat of that tree, but
[1:26:15] oh, but it's really good and it'll make
[1:26:17] you wise like God. You'll know good and
[1:26:19] evil." And and she's going, "Really,
[1:26:22] man? God didn't tell us that." Oh, yeah.
[1:26:24] God don't want you to know that. And
[1:26:26] then before you know it, then before you
[1:26:28] know it, a serpent caused her to sin.
[1:26:31] She ptook of the forbidden fruit. You
[1:26:33] can be seated now. Now death is reigning
[1:26:36] in her. Now she comes and she talks
[1:26:40] about this great hidden mystery that the
[1:26:44] devil just gave to her. They both sin.
[1:26:47] Now what has happened? They have just
[1:26:50] they have just become they have just
[1:26:53] become servants to the devil.
[1:26:57] Sin and death would come over here.
[1:27:00] Hallelujah. Amen. Now you're over there
[1:27:02] going.
[1:27:05] They don't know. But all of a sudden now
[1:27:09] their eyes were open. Now they're seeing
[1:27:12] and understanding sin. Now they know
[1:27:15] they're naked. Now, when God is walking
[1:27:18] and he's looking, he's walking in the
[1:27:20] cool and he's saying, "Adam,
[1:27:22] Adam." Adam's always met him. Adam's
[1:27:24] always been there. Adam's always
[1:27:26] fellowship. Adam and Eve, look for this
[1:27:29] evening experience every day. Adam,
[1:27:32] where art thou? Adam, go hide behind the
[1:27:35] pullpit. Hallelujah. Both of you go hide
[1:27:36] behind the pullpit. Adam, where art
[1:27:39] thou? Serpent's over going,
[1:27:43] Adam.
[1:27:45] Adam,
[1:27:47] Adam,
[1:27:49] what are y'all doing hiding? Adam,
[1:27:52] Adam, the Bible says
[1:27:57] we're afraid
[1:28:00] because we're naked. The righteousness
[1:28:03] of God is no longer covering them. Now
[1:28:07] their eyes have been open to sin. Come
[1:28:10] on out here. Amen.
[1:28:12] Now
[1:28:14] they can't fellowship with God. He's
[1:28:16] holy. They're sinners. Well, can you say
[1:28:19] amen?
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Now this guy, this guy right here.
[1:28:34] You give her a hug. Hallelujah.
[1:28:38] And he's and he's got now it's the evil
[1:28:40] one. Now they're cursing. Now their very
[1:28:44] own son. Amen. Eve's very own son killed
[1:28:49] uh his brother.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about
[1:28:53] first man, first woman, and their oldest
[1:28:56] son kills his brother.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Now there's sin and death. All right. Go
[1:29:02] be seated. Give them all a hand clap.
[1:29:07] sin and death.
[1:29:11] They needed someone to redeem them, but
[1:29:12] there was no one that could redeem them.
[1:29:14] This wasn't the same thing as buying.
[1:29:16] This wasn't the same thing as losing my
[1:29:19] little my little tool.
[1:29:22] It was God's son.
[1:29:25] It was God's daughter.
[1:29:27] There had to be somebody that was going
[1:29:29] to re and it had to be a redeemer, a a
[1:29:31] kinsman redeemer.
[1:29:33] So God created a body in the womb of
[1:29:39] Mary.
[1:29:41] This would God would be living in a
[1:29:44] perfect body that knew no sin, knew knew
[1:29:49] nothing about sin. He was the very
[1:29:52] tabernacle of God. And that man, Jesus
[1:29:56] Christ, would pay the ransom price to
[1:30:00] redeem his sons and daughters back to
[1:30:05] him.
[1:30:07] Oh, glory to the lamb of God. Are are
[1:30:10] you hearing me? We were subject to
[1:30:12] death. We were subject to hell. Everyone
[1:30:15] of us would have to go to hell because
[1:30:18] of Adam's sin. Amen. The h condemnation
[1:30:22] came upon us all. But the Bible says
[1:30:24] through one man's righteousness, through
[1:30:27] one man's obedience,
[1:30:29] eternal life now reigns in you. Eternal
[1:30:34] life now reigns in me. We are sons. We
[1:30:38] are daughters. We have been restored
[1:30:40] back to God. Somebody shout hallelujah.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Redemption. Redemption is to buy back.
[1:30:50] That means you had to be God's at the
[1:30:52] very beginning in order to redeem.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; I feel pretty tall right now.
[1:31:05] No matter what the devil tried to do, no
[1:31:08] matter how much the devil has tried to
[1:31:10] kill you, no matter how much the devil
[1:31:12] Amen. Maybe he has broken marriages.
[1:31:15] Maybe he has taken you and held you in
[1:31:17] chains for so long. But I'm here to give
[1:31:19] you some good news. Jesus says, "I've
[1:31:22] come to give you life and that you have
[1:31:25] life more abundantly. I've come to take
[1:31:28] you back so you know who I am and who
[1:31:32] you are."
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; The Bible would liken him to Jesus as
[1:31:42] the lamb. Amen. The lamb, the innocent
[1:31:46] lamb. Amen. That the wrath of God would
[1:31:50] be satisfied. It wasn't that the lamb
[1:31:52] was guilty of the crime. The lamb never
[1:31:54] paid or never never done the crime.
[1:31:57] Amen. But the lamb could now take your
[1:31:59] place. Sin was placed on Jesus Christ.
[1:32:03] The innocent life of Jesus Christ would
[1:32:06] now come back upon you as a believer.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; The perfect lamb shed its blood. Now,
[1:32:16] I'm not talking about a woolly lamb from
[1:32:18] the pasture. I'm talking about Jesus
[1:32:21] sacrificing his life. He who knew
[1:32:25] never will never know how it feels to be
[1:32:29] plagued by sin. This great God who
[1:32:31] doesn't have an inkling of what
[1:32:33] temptation is. This great God who never
[1:32:37] had a mind battle.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; He came in the form of a human being.
[1:32:43] The Bible says he was tempted in every
[1:32:45] way like you and like me.
[1:32:49] He lived in a flawed body of decay. In
[1:32:52] fact, that body died. He was so tired
[1:32:54] that he slept in the boat on stormy
[1:32:56] seas. Jesus was so weary that he cried
[1:32:59] at Lazarus's grave, so hard of a trial
[1:33:02] that the angels had to come and
[1:33:03] strengthen him. He was so human that he
[1:33:06] cried, "If it be thy will, let this cup
[1:33:08] pass from me." He was so weak that Simon
[1:33:10] had to carry his cross. He was so
[1:33:12] forsaken that he cried, "My God, my God,
[1:33:16] why hast thou forsaken me?"
[1:33:21] Hebrews 2:14
[1:33:23] says, "For as much then as the
[1:33:26] children," in the original, it says,
[1:33:27] "For as much then as these his children
[1:33:30] are partakers of flesh and blood, he
[1:33:33] also himself likewise
[1:33:36] took part of the same, that through
[1:33:40] death he might destroy him who had the
[1:33:44] power of death, that is the devil, and
[1:33:47] deliver them who through fear of death
[1:33:50] were all their lifetime subject to
[1:33:53] bondage. Oh, can you say amen? Amen.
[1:33:57] Hallelujah. For verily he took not on
[1:34:00] him the nature of angels, but he took on
[1:34:02] him the seed of Abraham on human flesh.
[1:34:05] Wherefore in all things it behooveth him
[1:34:09] to be made like unto his brethren that
[1:34:11] he might be a merciful and faithful high
[1:34:14] priest and things pertaining to God to
[1:34:17] make reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:34:20] people. For in that he himself has
[1:34:22] suffered being tempted. He is able to
[1:34:25] secure them that are tempted.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; He knows how you feel. He knows your
[1:34:32] sickness. Jesus knows what you're going
[1:34:35] through. this morning. Maybe you've had
[1:34:36] a a bad week this week. Maybe the devil
[1:34:39] is is fighting you in your mind. Maybe
[1:34:41] you've got a son or a daughter, amen,
[1:34:43] who's really going through it and they
[1:34:45] don't know which way to go. I just want
[1:34:46] to let you know that we have got a God
[1:34:50] that lives in a body just like yours.
[1:34:54] And he knows who you are. He knows what
[1:34:57] you're facing. And he's able to secure
[1:35:00] you.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:05] Well, glory to God.
[1:35:08] It's God
[1:35:10] redeeming us.
[1:35:12] Redeeming us.
[1:35:14] Maybe you say, "I I'm still having a
[1:35:17] hard time." Well, Colossians 1:13 says,
[1:35:19] "Who hath delivered us from the power of
[1:35:22] darkness
[1:35:24] and has translated us into the kingdom
[1:35:27] of his dear son in whom we have
[1:35:31] redemption." What does redeem mean? Buy
[1:35:34] back.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Buy back.
[1:35:38] I had some ladders stolen one time. Had
[1:35:40] some equipment, some stuff stolen. And
[1:35:44] I was in a pawn shop one time. And I
[1:35:48] and I looked over at the ladder and I
[1:35:49] said, "That looks like a Wendel Martin
[1:35:51] ladder." Hallelujah.
[1:35:53] And uh and so
[1:35:57] I I I went over there and I man they had
[1:36:00] taken they had taken some of my name off
[1:36:02] but they didn't they I had a good place
[1:36:05] where I I I kept my name. Turned that
[1:36:08] thing over and I looked and there it
[1:36:10] said Martin Electric.
[1:36:16] I went up to the dude and I said that
[1:36:18] thing is mine.
[1:36:20] He said well I'm sorry sir. You can buy
[1:36:22] it back if you want to.
[1:36:24] Hallelujah.
[1:36:31] But I looked at that old thing and I
[1:36:33] said, "I ain't buying that sorry thing
[1:36:35] back."
[1:36:39] But when God looked at you, God didn't
[1:36:41] say.
[1:36:44] God didn't say, "I ain't buying that
[1:36:46] sorry thing back." God says, "They're my
[1:36:48] sons.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; They're my daughters.
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:36:56] In this congregation this morning, you
[1:36:59] would never know
[1:37:01] that there were people that were in
[1:37:04] bondage to sins so great,
[1:37:09] so great in this service here this
[1:37:12] morning.
[1:37:14] But God
[1:37:16] has redeemed them.
[1:37:20] God
[1:37:22] has delivered from alcohol and drugs and
[1:37:25] abortions and every kind of a sexual
[1:37:29] sin, every kind. And we are all sitting
[1:37:32] in this building here this morning. And
[1:37:35] we can all worship the Lord Jesus. Why?
[1:37:38] It's because there was a lamb that was
[1:37:41] found worthy. There was a God who come
[1:37:44] to redeem us. And we are all here
[1:37:47] redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; I remember sister
[1:37:57] Julie.
[1:38:00] She gave us a hard time
[1:38:03] always. Oh, she was pretty rough on us.
[1:38:06] She owned a little business in town and
[1:38:07] every time we'd go in, oh, she was
[1:38:09] giving me a hard time.
[1:38:12] I quit going in. Amen. She had a
[1:38:15] restaurant. I quit going in because I
[1:38:17] just Oh my goodness.
[1:38:20] One time
[1:38:22] I brought I took I took Forest Farmer in
[1:38:24] there and y'all know Forest Farmer
[1:38:26] before before we went to uh the service
[1:38:29] that one Sunday morning. And so we was
[1:38:31] in there and it was plum packed out and
[1:38:33] she and she sees it and she just seen
[1:38:35] great delight. She goes, "Hey everyone."
[1:38:41] Oh boy. Here we go.
[1:38:44] Here comes
[1:38:47] the preacher of the church of the skirt
[1:38:51] and he brought a friend
[1:38:56] and force farmer looks at me says, "Did
[1:38:59] we just get greeted?"
[1:39:02] "Oh yeah, this woman is rough. She's
[1:39:05] rough." I said, "I'm sorry. I'm so
[1:39:07] sorry." He goes, "Oh, it's all right."
[1:39:09] So we sat down. He had his back toward
[1:39:11] her and I'm sitting there and of course
[1:39:12] I know everybody in there and they're
[1:39:14] all giggling, you know, and we're we're
[1:39:16] talking back and forth and she comes
[1:39:17] back in and she starts digging a little
[1:39:19] bit more and I'm looking at brother
[1:39:22] Forest and I know he's not going to take
[1:39:23] this too much and all of a sudden I look
[1:39:26] at him, he was eating his eggs
[1:39:28] and then his jaw set.
[1:39:31] I said, "Brother Forest, it's okay." He
[1:39:33] turned right around.
[1:39:36] He said, "Let me tell you something
[1:39:38] about this preacher."
[1:39:41] Said, "Brother Forest, Brother Forest,
[1:39:42] just sit down. It'd be all right." He
[1:39:45] said, "There ain't nobody that can pray
[1:39:48] any of y'all to Jesus Christ here this
[1:39:50] morning like this man." He said, "This
[1:39:53] man knows how to get a hold of God and
[1:39:55] he can save you." And before, you know,
[1:39:56] we're we're just sat there. I'm going to
[1:39:58] and there. And by the time he got
[1:40:00] through, everyone was crying and feeling
[1:40:02] sorry for for the other woman because
[1:40:05] Julie was having she was matter of fact,
[1:40:07] she left. She just went back there in
[1:40:09] the kitchen.
[1:40:14] Kobe kept going in to see her. I I
[1:40:16] wasn't
[1:40:19] I I Kobe just kept going in there to see
[1:40:22] her and he'd come back and say, "You got
[1:40:25] some scriptures on homosexuality or you
[1:40:28] got scriptures on abortion or I mean she
[1:40:30] she was hitting him hard. I mean, she
[1:40:32] was just horny,
[1:40:34] you know. I So, finally I said, "Yeah,
[1:40:36] yeah, let's get some man." So, we we
[1:40:38] loaded him down, man. He'd go over there
[1:40:39] and he'd get the Bible out and start
[1:40:41] showing her. And
[1:40:43] long story short,
[1:40:46] Guess who walks in
[1:40:49] to one of our services?
[1:40:52] Julie,
[1:40:53] the church of the skirt, Littleton.
[1:40:59] And she went, she had other nicknames
[1:41:01] for us, too. She had nickname. Oh my
[1:41:02] goodness. You know, here's here's here's
[1:41:04] the Mr. Goody
[1:41:08] Goodie shoes or whatever. And uh uh she
[1:41:12] come she started coming to church and
[1:41:14] I'm going
[1:41:19] but she said but I'm just coming here
[1:41:22] because I like the music. I said okay.
[1:41:26] Well one day we were I we we were out of
[1:41:29] town is Michael and I we were out of
[1:41:31] town. We were out of state. We were over
[1:41:33] in in in in the Carolinas. And guess who
[1:41:36] calls me? It was Julie.
[1:41:40] And she's over there screaming and what
[1:41:46] where were you? And I'm going, "Man,
[1:41:48] what's wrong, Judah? What's wrong?
[1:41:49] What's wrong? What's wrong?" She says,
[1:41:51] "Find me." She said, "Where are you
[1:41:52] tonight?" I said, "Well, I was was out
[1:41:54] preaching." She says, "I wanted you to
[1:41:56] be at church. I wanted you to be at
[1:41:58] church." And I said, "Well, you know, I
[1:42:01] was at church, just not at our church."
[1:42:03] "Yeah, but you should have been here
[1:42:04] tonight." I'm like, "Yeah, well, sorry."
[1:42:07] She said, "I just wanted you to be at
[1:42:09] our church tonight."
[1:42:11] And I said, "Well, okay." She says,
[1:42:14] "While the preacher was preaching,
[1:42:16] Jonathan was preaching, he was preaching
[1:42:20] on the love of Jesus and redemption."
[1:42:23] And she says, "All of a sudden, she said
[1:42:27] this, the the ceiling opened up and the
[1:42:30] ceiling and water come down and what
[1:42:33] went up and down me like this." She
[1:42:35] said, "I it happened, Wendle." And I
[1:42:37] said, "Well, I believe that." And she
[1:42:39] was crying and she says, she says, "You
[1:42:42] put all of those people in that church
[1:42:45] together, add up every sin that they've
[1:42:48] ever committed. Every one of them." She
[1:42:51] said, "I have more sins than any of
[1:42:55] them."
[1:42:57] She said, "Let's talk about it. I've
[1:43:00] had," and she told me had the amount
[1:43:01] abortions. She's told me the the the the
[1:43:04] the sins that I mean, she was going
[1:43:06] through it all and I'm thinking, "Oh
[1:43:08] my."
[1:43:10] She said, "That's how evil of a woman."
[1:43:15] She said, "But tonight,
[1:43:18] something happened in that church
[1:43:20] service, and I know that my sins
[1:43:26] are forgiven.
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:34] I know. She says, "I I just I'm free.
[1:43:39] He's forgiven me." She says, "I can love
[1:43:42] him the way I want to." Are you hearing
[1:43:44] me? Satan had that woman bound all of
[1:43:48] those years. But when Jesus comes to set
[1:43:52] us free, we are free. Free indeed.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen?
[1:44:00] As I get ready to close,
[1:44:03] there was a
[1:44:06] there was a case
[1:44:09] here in in Oklahoma years ago. Some of
[1:44:11] you probably remember it, that there was
[1:44:14] a there was a a a a girl that had been
[1:44:20] stolen from the hospital from birth.
[1:44:24] She was kidnapped out of the hospital by
[1:44:28] this guy and and and by an evil man
[1:44:32] and and she had went all of her life
[1:44:35] with this evil man. And this man had had
[1:44:38] a great big criminal record and this man
[1:44:42] done a lot of evil things and made her
[1:44:44] do a lot of evil things. He she she at
[1:44:49] at by the time she was 12 years old she
[1:44:51] was a thief. She was I mean she she she
[1:44:54] had a wrap sheet and well Amen. But the
[1:44:57] daddy and the mother never quit looking
[1:45:00] for her.
[1:45:04] And finally through the through the
[1:45:06] updates, you know, through the record
[1:45:07] they would do the the images, the
[1:45:09] pictures of what she would look like,
[1:45:10] this that someone called the hotline and
[1:45:13] said, "I think we have seen that girl."
[1:45:19] They so so they come in and they follow
[1:45:21] up on it.
[1:45:24] They come in, do the sting operation.
[1:45:26] They grab the girl.
[1:45:29] They they do the DNA test
[1:45:32] and the DNA test matched her father's
[1:45:40] and did her original father and did not
[1:45:45] match this other man.
[1:45:48] So the day come where they were said,
[1:45:50] "No, you've got to go back. You're She
[1:45:53] looked at her daddy and said,
[1:45:58] "He's not my daddy.
[1:46:00] I've never known him."
[1:46:03] They said, "Well, who's your daddy?" He
[1:46:06] said, "This man right here."
[1:46:09] They said, "You were stolen
[1:46:12] from the hospital at birth. You were
[1:46:15] never this man's.
[1:46:19] No, this is my daddy.
[1:46:22] Showing the DNA.
[1:46:24] They said, "Listen,
[1:46:27] this daddy still has a crib
[1:46:30] in your room.
[1:46:33] He never even took the crib down. He
[1:46:37] never even they never even took never
[1:46:40] moved the room from when you were
[1:46:42] supposed to come home from the hospital.
[1:46:47] This man
[1:46:49] loves you. This mom and dad has been
[1:46:53] looking for you all of these 12 years.
[1:46:58] This man stole you when you were a
[1:47:01] little baby and he's raped you and
[1:47:04] molested you and made you do evil
[1:47:07] things.
[1:47:09] This man
[1:47:12] is evil.
[1:47:16] Now watch.
[1:47:18] She had to look and say,
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; "This is not who I am.
[1:47:27] I am Am I Are Are y'all putting it
[1:47:30] together with the devil and God?" The
[1:47:32] devil came in and said, "No, you're
[1:47:34] mine. No, you're mine." But God's come
[1:47:38] in in this day with a DNA test and said,
[1:47:40] "No,
[1:47:42] you're mine.
[1:47:46] You're mine. You never were the devil's.
[1:47:50] You never did belong to him. You never
[1:47:53] did belong in hell. You never did. You
[1:47:56] belong in heaven. You belong with joy.
[1:47:59] You belong with peace. You belong with
[1:48:01] Well, are y'all hearing me today?" Amen.
[1:48:03] I hope this has been good for you here
[1:48:05] this morning. What I'm saying is God's
[1:48:08] given you an assurance that there is
[1:48:11] another land.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; And I've talked too long without reading
[1:48:18] my notes. So I'm just going to have to
[1:48:19] cut it short here. But the Bible says
[1:48:21] that every one of us have been given
[1:48:23] promise
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; that there's going to be a resurrection.
[1:48:29] This body may go down in corruption, but
[1:48:31] it's going to come back up in
[1:48:32] incorruption.
[1:48:33] Oh, glory to God. There will be no there
[1:48:36] will be no fake eyes over there.
[1:48:38] There'll never be no false teeth over
[1:48:40] there. There'll You'll have all of your
[1:48:42] body parts when you get over there. Can
[1:48:44] you say amen? It doesn't matter where
[1:48:46] you are or what you're fighting.
[1:48:49] Redemption has come to give you bring
[1:48:53] you back to him.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you love the Lord
[1:48:58] Jesus?
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:04] He's paid the price for you to redeem
[1:49:07] you back to himself to show his glory to
[1:49:11] you.
[1:49:13] You say this morning, "Brother Wendle,
[1:49:15] I've been a Christian for a long time.
[1:49:19] I I've been a believer.
[1:49:22] Brother Wendle, I'm fighting
[1:49:25] man's old body getting older. But I just
[1:49:29] want to let you know just as the sun is
[1:49:32] going down, the sun's going to rise
[1:49:35] again.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Not going to be too much longer
[1:49:39] and all the leaves are going to come off
[1:49:41] the trees.
[1:49:43] Not going to be too much longer.
[1:49:46] It's going to look dead and the ice and
[1:49:48] the snow is going to be covering
[1:49:50] everything.
[1:49:52] But don't you worry.
[1:49:55] Yeah,
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; don't you worry. When the su n, the
[1:49:58] sunlight comes, come come spring,
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; that old tree that's all dead and looks
[1:50:08] like all hope is gone. What has
[1:50:10] happened? The life is still there. It's
[1:50:12] just the life went down into the roots.
[1:50:15] And brother, when we die, Amen. We're
[1:50:18] not really dead. Amen. We have got
[1:50:21] eternal life in the soul. And when God
[1:50:25] calls, we're going to everyone rise.
[1:50:30] You're going to go down in gray hair,
[1:50:32] but you're going to come back up with
[1:50:33] black hair. You might go down with no
[1:50:36] hair, but you're coming back up. Well,
[1:50:38] can you say that?
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; But even greater still, the Bible says
[1:50:45] that there is a rapture.
[1:50:48] I believe that there are people in this
[1:50:50] building right now that is
[1:50:53] going to make a rapture. That means
[1:50:55] we'll never see death
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; will be changed. The Bible. You say, "Do
[1:50:59] you believe that?"
[1:51:02] I nature declares it.
[1:51:06] We we we we can see that God's word we
[1:51:08] can just look at nature and we can see
[1:51:11] God in it.
[1:51:14] There has to be life.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:51:19] If there if there's someone here, maybe
[1:51:21] maybe there's one of you young people or
[1:51:23] or maybe there's someone maybe there's
[1:51:24] an elder here that says, "I I don't have
[1:51:28] the promise of eternal life in my soul
[1:51:31] yet, brother." When I know something's
[1:51:32] there, but I'm still locked. I'm still
[1:51:35] locked in the
[1:51:38] in the jail cell of Satan.
[1:51:41] I just want to tell you, you never were
[1:51:43] a child of the devil.
[1:51:46] You never were a child of the devil. You
[1:51:52] always were a child of God.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:00] Hallelujah. And I just want to tell you
[1:52:03] that God loves you more than the devil
[1:52:05] hates you.
[1:52:07] And I want to tell you God's power is
[1:52:09] greater. God's power. Are you young
[1:52:12] people hearing me? God's power is
[1:52:14] greater than anything the devil tries to
[1:52:17] throw your way.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Thinking of some scriptures,
[1:52:27] something that Jesus had said.
[1:52:30] Think about it.
[1:52:33] John 6 and37 he says all that the father
[1:52:38] hath given me
[1:52:41] shall come to me
[1:52:44] all Jesus came for a purpose he came to
[1:52:47] redeem all that I've come for
[1:52:52] are going to come
[1:52:55] I
[1:52:57] am the body that God has sent to redeem
[1:53:03] He says, "All the Father hath given me
[1:53:06] shall come to me, and him that cometh to
[1:53:08] me, I will in no wise cast out. I came
[1:53:13] down from heaven not to do my own will,
[1:53:15] but the will of him that sent me." And
[1:53:18] this is the Father's will that sent me.
[1:53:21] That of all. Somebody say all.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; A double L. All.
[1:53:28] Well, glory to God.
[1:53:30] All
[1:53:32] which he hath given me. Uh this is am I
[1:53:37] on the right place with the 39th verse?
[1:53:39] Yeah. It's okay. This is the father's
[1:53:41] will which hath sent me that all which
[1:53:44] he hath given me I should lose nothing.
[1:53:49] Somebody say nothing.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; But should raise it up again in the last
[1:53:54] day. And this is the will of him that
[1:53:55] sent me, that everyone which seeth the
[1:53:58] son believeth on him may have
[1:54:00] everlasting life, and I will raise him
[1:54:02] up at the end of the day. Someone shout,
[1:54:05] "Amen."
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Jesus said there in John 6:44,
[1:54:10] "No man can come to me except the father
[1:54:13] which hath sent me. Draw him and I will
[1:54:17] raise him up at the last day."
[1:54:20] John 14:2 in my father's house and the
[1:54:22] musicians can come in my father's house
[1:54:25] that means household kingdom family in
[1:54:27] my father's household or his kingdom are
[1:54:30] many mansions that word is really
[1:54:32] dwellings
[1:54:33] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:54:38] I go to prepare a place for you and if I
[1:54:45] go and prepare a place for you I will
[1:54:47] come again and receive you unto myself,
[1:54:50] that where I am, there ye may be also.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Whether I go, you know, and the way you
[1:54:59] know. Thomas said, Lord, we know not
[1:55:01] where you go. How can we know the way?
[1:55:04] And Jesus says, I
[1:55:06] am the way,
[1:55:08] the truth, and the life, and no man
[1:55:12] comes to the Father
[1:55:16] but by me.
[1:55:20] What a promise.
[1:55:23] [Music]
[1:55:26] Some says, "Well, I just don't know if
[1:55:27] I'm going to make it." I'm going to tell
[1:55:29] you, if God's not big enough to keep
[1:55:32] you, then I think we need to go find
[1:55:34] another God.
[1:55:38] I want to tell you if my name brother
[1:55:40] Merl was written on that book, the
[1:55:42] lamb's book of life. Now, there is a
[1:55:45] book of life that has all of your all of
[1:55:47] your names. It's got it's got people
[1:55:49] that saved not saved. It's got all those
[1:55:50] all those names on it. But also, but
[1:55:52] there's a lamb's book of life. That's
[1:55:54] Jesus, the lamb that was slain before
[1:55:55] the foundation of the world. Your name
[1:55:56] was put in the lamb section of the book.
[1:55:59] In other words, your name is represented
[1:56:01] under his righteousness, represented
[1:56:04] under his goodness, represented under
[1:56:06] his forgiveness.
[1:56:09] My name is put there. And if God
[1:56:13] so seen me and put my name in that book
[1:56:17] before the foundation of the world, then
[1:56:19] I just believe that God's big enough to
[1:56:21] save me and to keep me.
[1:56:27] I believe God's big enough.
[1:56:31] He's big enough.
[1:56:34] There is no trial that you young men are
[1:56:36] ever going to go through.
[1:56:39] There is nothing that you young married
[1:56:42] couples
[1:56:45] go through
[1:56:48] that God is not going to get you
[1:56:49] through. There is nothing that you
[1:56:52] elders,
[1:56:54] whether it be sickness,
[1:56:56] whether it be struggling in your health
[1:56:59] or whatever,
[1:57:01] there is nothing that you're going to go
[1:57:03] through but what God is not going to be
[1:57:05] there for you.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; God's going to finish his work.
[1:57:15] Oh, bless the name of the Lord. Could
[1:57:17] you put Philippians 1 and 8 up there
[1:57:18] just real quickly?
[1:57:21] Glory to God.
[1:57:22] [Music]
[1:57:24] Oops, that's the wrong one. Hallelujah.
[1:57:27] He that begun a good work in you. Amen.
[1:57:30] I missed it by a few verses. Hallelujah.
[1:57:36] Hallelujah.
[1:57:38] One and six. being confident of this
[1:57:42] very thing
[1:57:44] that he Christ
[1:57:47] which has begun
[1:57:51] a good work in you Shayla the God that
[1:57:55] has begun the good work in you
[1:57:59] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:58:02] Christ. God is not going to do something
[1:58:05] and then say I got myself in trouble.
[1:58:08] Well,
[1:58:10] when God starts something, God's going
[1:58:12] to finish it.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that, Sister Mary?
[1:58:16] Aren't you boys glad for that? What God
[1:58:19] started in me? Now, my wife gives up on
[1:58:21] me. Amen. A time or two every year, and
[1:58:23] I might give up on her a time or two
[1:58:24] every year, thinking, "Lord, there I God
[1:58:27] says, "Oh, goofballs. Y'all's going to
[1:58:29] make it." Right. Right. We all get
[1:58:33] there. We all We all question one
[1:58:35] another, but God is not scratching his
[1:58:38] head wondering who's going to make it.
[1:58:40] God has come to redeem you, and the
[1:58:44] devil cannot have you.
[1:58:47] [Music]
[1:58:49] Glory be to the lamb of God.
[1:58:53] Now, what is baptism about?
[1:58:57] Why? Why? Why is it Why is it that the
[1:58:59] Bible says
[1:59:01] they're they're in in in uh in Matthew
[1:59:04] the
[1:59:06] the 28th chapter, actually they're in in
[1:59:09] Mark the 16th chapter,
[1:59:12] Mark 16,
[1:59:17] and he and he tells them, this is just
[1:59:20] before he's risen from the dead. Now
[1:59:21] he's he's he he appears the 14th verse.
[1:59:24] Afterward he appears to the 11 as they
[1:59:27] sat at meat and araided them for their
[1:59:28] unbelief and hardness of their heart
[1:59:30] because they believed not them which had
[1:59:32] seen him after he was risen. And he said
[1:59:34] to them, "Go ye into all the world and
[1:59:37] preach the gospel to every creature. And
[1:59:40] he that believeth
[1:59:42] and is baptized shall be saved, and he
[1:59:45] that believeth not shall be damned.
[1:59:48] These signs shall follow them that
[1:59:50] believe in my name. They shall cast out
[1:59:51] devils.
[1:59:53] They shall speak with new tongues. They
[1:59:56] shall drink. They shall take up
[1:59:57] serpents. And if they drink any deadly
[1:59:58] thing, it shall not harm them. For they
[2:00:01] shall lay hands on the sick, and they
[2:00:03] shall recover. So then, after the Lord
[2:00:07] had spoken unto them, he was received up
[2:00:09] into heaven and sat on the right hand of
[2:00:12] God. And they went forth and preached
[2:00:14] everywhere to the Lord, working with
[2:00:16] them, confirming the word with signs
[2:00:17] following.
[2:00:19] So the commission was go proclaim the
[2:00:22] good news. Acts 2:38,
[2:00:26] we find
[2:00:28] that as they came, they went to the
[2:00:30] upper room as Jesus had told them to do
[2:00:35] and he says, "I want you to wait there.
[2:00:38] I want you to wait there until you
[2:00:40] receive the Holy Spirit."
[2:00:44] Now they've been filled with the Holy
[2:00:46] Ghost. They come out and they
[2:00:49] And Peter began to preach to them this
[2:00:51] what this Christ does done. And he says
[2:00:54] this is that which the prophet Joel had
[2:00:56] talked about. And he began to talk to
[2:00:59] them and how that the redeemer had come.
[2:01:02] He was the redeemer and he's come to
[2:01:04] redeem us to himself.
[2:01:06] And that his holy spirit would now come
[2:01:09] back upon them.
[2:01:11] [Music]
[2:01:12] The very fellowship between God would be
[2:01:16] mended and heaven and earth
[2:01:21] would once again come hand in hand
[2:01:23] together.
[2:01:25] The eternal God would now fellowship
[2:01:27] with his people.
[2:01:30] And the Bible says there in Acts the 2
[2:01:33] chapter at the end of his sermon, Acts 2
[2:01:35] and 37, he says, "When they heard this,
[2:01:38] they were pricricked in their heart and
[2:01:40] said unto Peter and to the rest of the
[2:01:42] apostles, men and brethren, what shall
[2:01:44] we do?"
[2:01:47] Peter answered or Peter said unto
[2:01:49] them,"Repent
[2:01:51] and be baptized every one of you in the
[2:01:53] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:01:55] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[2:01:58] of the Holy Ghost."
[2:02:02] 41st verse. And then they that gladly
[2:02:05] received his word were baptized,
[2:02:08] and the same day there were added unto
[2:02:10] them 3,000 souls.
[2:02:14] Incredible.
[2:02:18] Now what does baptism represent?
[2:02:21] [Music]
[2:02:24] Baptism represents the death,
[2:02:28] the burial,
[2:02:30] and the resurrection of Jesus,
[2:02:33] our redeemer. Now, this is all there in
[2:02:36] the book of Romans, the sixth chapter,
[2:02:38] the entire chapter. And I'd encourage
[2:02:40] everyone to go back and read that. It
[2:02:43] talks about what this baptism represents
[2:02:47] as Jesus died.
[2:02:52] And why is this important to you?
[2:02:56] Because
[2:02:58] if I'm Jesus and I'm representing you
[2:03:00] and redeeming you,
[2:03:03] when I die,
[2:03:05] your sins are coming on me. So I am
[2:03:07] dying for your sins.
[2:03:11] I'm being buried.
[2:03:13] The Bible says Jesus went to hell,
[2:03:18] but then was raised again in the newness
[2:03:22] of life. So you
[2:03:25] when you're baptized, it's not that the
[2:03:28] water has any power.
[2:03:31] It's not that the water can even save
[2:03:33] you. It's the blood of Jesus that saves
[2:03:35] us. But this is in representation
[2:03:40] of the one who did say. So when we die,
[2:03:44] then we're dying to our sins. We're
[2:03:46] saying, "Forgive me
[2:03:48] if your Bible says
[2:03:51] [Music]
[2:03:53] that I'm wrong.
[2:03:56] I want to look at that and say, I I'm
[2:03:58] sorry.
[2:04:00] [Music]
[2:04:03] The devil's had me in the prison house
[2:04:05] and I want out of this prison house. I
[2:04:06] want to live for you, Lord.
[2:04:09] I want peace. I want joy. I want life.
[2:04:14] So what does God do?
[2:04:17] He died,
[2:04:19] buried, rose again. You are repenting.
[2:04:24] You're going down washing all those s.
[2:04:28] I want you to look at it just like that,
[2:04:30] Shayla. that when you're going down,
[2:04:32] you're coming up and there's not one sin
[2:04:34] held against you
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; because Jesus paid that price.
[2:04:44] But when you raise again, the scripture
[2:04:46] says,
[2:04:48] then you receive the Holy Spirit.
[2:04:51] And we want that Holy Ghost to come upon
[2:04:53] us and say, "Lord,
[2:04:56] that logos I've been preaching about
[2:04:57] these last few Sundays, that life of
[2:05:00] God, come down upon me and to live
[2:05:04] in me."
[2:05:06] Isn't that beautiful?
[2:05:09] As we get prepared for this, um, I
[2:05:12] wonder if Sister Shayla, if you want to,
[2:05:15] if you want to go ahead and get ready
[2:05:17] for baptism, y'all just come. You know
[2:05:19] where it's at, sister. Okay. All right.
[2:05:23] And uh I'm so I you know I I I I've only
[2:05:28] known Shayla and um and Hayden for I
[2:05:33] don't know five or six weeks, but
[2:05:34] they're just wonderful couple. Haven't
[2:05:37] you just enjoyed having them here at the
[2:05:39] church?
[2:05:42] And uh
[2:05:44] and so what I'm going to do is I'm going
[2:05:46] to go ahead and and and go back and and
[2:05:48] change my uh I've got light colored
[2:05:51] riches on. So I'm going I'm going to go
[2:05:52] change and let brother Kobe if you want
[2:05:54] to just lead us in some worship songs
[2:05:56] and then we'll get ready.

[2:14:06] that right there. And then what I'm
[2:14:08] going to do is just come on up here a
[2:14:10] little bit closer to the
[2:14:12] Now when I when I take you I'll have you
[2:14:15] to hold my hand and then I want to
[2:14:17] baptize you right
[2:14:22] and
[2:14:23] So, do you understand
[2:14:27] my my uh my my thoughts on redemption as
[2:14:31] as we brought that out this morning?
[2:14:34] God's been looking for you all of your
[2:14:36] life. He knew you were here and God
[2:14:39] directs us and God has a time in our
[2:14:42] life that he reveals himself to us. And
[2:14:45] you just can't help it. You just you see
[2:14:47] Christ. You see that you're that he
[2:14:51] loved everlasting love. And now as this
[2:14:55] is the most wonderful time as we go down
[2:14:57] this watery grave
[2:15:00] and accepting what God has has done for
[2:15:03] you is the greatest thing that could
[2:15:05] ever happen. And you just held like that
[2:15:07] and just like that.
[2:15:09] Sister Shayen, upon the confession of
[2:15:12] your sins, the obedience of your faith,
[2:15:16] I now baptize you into the name of our
[2:15:19] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Take a
[2:15:22] deep breath.
[2:15:25] [Music]
[2:15:27] Hallelujah.
[2:15:29] Glory to God.
[2:15:33] Happy day.
[2:15:36] Oh happy day.
[2:15:40] When Jesus
[2:15:42] [Music]
[2:15:44] Jesus
[2:15:48] Jesus walk.
[2:15:51] Bless her.
[2:15:54] Oh happy day.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Oh happy
[2:16:00] happy day.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Happy day.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When Jesus walk
[2:16:12] Jesus walk
[2:16:15] with my Jesus walk
[2:16:20] my s away.
[2:16:22] [Applause]
[2:16:23] [Music]
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; I just wonder would there be anyone else
[2:16:28] here this morning? Maybe you don't have
[2:16:30] clothes but we could find some clothes
[2:16:31] for you. Is there anyone else here today
[2:16:34] that would want to get baptized in the
[2:16:36] lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ?
[2:16:39] Maybe maybe there was maybe the sermon
[2:16:43] touched your heart and you said, "Wait a
[2:16:45] minute. I am a son of God. I've just
[2:16:47] been bound in the prison in the shackles
[2:16:50] of sin by the devil."
[2:16:53] But if you're you want to be free this
[2:16:54] morning, if there's someone that wants
[2:16:56] it, listen,
[2:16:59] the grace of God is so has been so
[2:17:02] eternal. God's love for you has been
[2:17:04] eternal. He loves you.
[2:17:06] [Music]
[2:17:08] I have baptized people way up in years.
[2:17:12] I've baptized children that it doesn't
[2:17:15] matter your age. It matters is knowing
[2:17:18] who he is and who you are. Amen.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; That's the greatest thing that we could
[2:17:24] ever do. Can you say amen? I wonder if
[2:17:27] we could just sing that song on a hill

[2:33:31] Hallelujah.
[2:33:33] Hallelujah. Isn't he just wonderful?
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I love him. I thank God
[2:33:40] for his abundance of grace for you. Just
[2:33:43] think about it. There is a difference.
[2:33:46] Now the Bible said that the woman would
[2:33:47] have a seed and that that the that that
[2:33:50] the serpent would have a seed. The
[2:33:53] serpent seed was condemned. The woman's
[2:33:56] seed was fallen. Amen. So Christ come to
[2:34:00] redeem all of those that were in God's
[2:34:03] book.
[2:34:04] Amen. Now the Bible would Jesus would
[2:34:07] tell he would tell some of them as they
[2:34:09] they they were just on him all the time.
[2:34:12] He would come and quote the scripture to
[2:34:14] him. They said, "No, you you've got a
[2:34:15] devil and you're this and you're that."
[2:34:17] Amen. Finally, Jesus turned around him
[2:34:19] and says, "You are of your father, the
[2:34:21] devil. Your father was a murderer from
[2:34:24] the beginning." Which was linking him to
[2:34:26] Cain. Putting him all the way back. But
[2:34:28] then he'll turn around and says, "But
[2:34:30] all that the Father hath given me, I
[2:34:33] will not lose one." And then he would
[2:34:36] say the next verse, "And they I will
[2:34:39] give them my word and they will hear."
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe not the next verse.
[2:34:45] It's there's there's there's about four
[2:34:46] or five verses right in there. They will
[2:34:48] hear my words. And I just want to say
[2:34:51] when God speaks something and then it
[2:34:53] just rings in your ear, just raise up
[2:34:55] your hand and say, "Thank you, Jesus.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you for giving me an ear to hear."
[2:35:00] He said, "My sheep will hear my voice
[2:35:03] and another they won't follow. So, you
[2:35:05] were always a sheep. You were just lost.
[2:35:08] You were always a son. You just didn't
[2:35:10] know it." But thank God for the blood of
[2:35:12] Jesus Christ. And when the devil tries
[2:35:15] to tell you, Shayla, "Well, you're not a
[2:35:17] daughter of God." You just tell him,
[2:35:19] "Amen." Listen,
[2:35:22] I've got, we both got two things that
[2:35:25] have been said. The devil has been
[2:35:26] promised the lake of fire and you've
[2:35:28] been promised eternal life in heaven.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; As I always say, put that in your pipe
[2:35:39] and smoke it, devil. Amen. I'm a
[2:35:41] daughter of God, son of God, child of
[2:35:43] God. Is that right?
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God richly bless you. We're going
