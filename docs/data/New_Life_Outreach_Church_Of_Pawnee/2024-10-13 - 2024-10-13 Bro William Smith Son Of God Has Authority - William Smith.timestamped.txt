[36:25] get his legs all spread but two legs
[36:28] would stay on the ground and I'd be
[36:29] still pulling up and and Dad he'd just
[36:32] walk up there and and uh kick that front
[36:36] leg and I'd flip it over and man I felt
[36:38] like I was to Cowboy him

[38:11] here with acts one first we're going to
[38:14] read this one scripture the eth verse
[38:18] but he shall receive
[38:20] power after that the Holy Ghost is come
[38:23] upon you and he shall be Witnesses and
[38:27] to me both in Jerusalem and to J uh
[38:30] Judah and Samaria and to the other parts
[38:35] of the earth I thank God for that
[38:38] because I'm in that other part of the
[38:40] earth here in the
[38:42] second chapter we like to start at the
[38:47] 37th
[38:50] verse Acts
[38:52] 2:37 now when they heard this they were
[38:57] pricked in their heart and said unto
[39:00] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[39:03] men and
[39:04] Brethren what shall we do then Peter
[39:08] said unto them repent and be baptized
[39:10] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[39:13] Christ for the remissions of sins and he
[39:16] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[39:20] for the promise is unto you and to your
[39:23] children to all that are far off even as
[39:27] many as the Lord Our God shall call and
[39:31] with many other
[39:32] words did he testify and exhort saying
[39:36] save yourselves from this unw
[39:40] generation then they that gladly
[39:45] received the word were baptized and the
[39:48] same day there were added unto them
[39:51] about 3,000 souls and they continued
[39:55] steadfast in the apostles Doctrine and
[39:58] fellowship and in the breaking of bread
[40:01] and
[40:03] praying and fear came up fear Came Upon
[40:08] every
[40:09] soul and Many Wonders and signs were
[40:13] done by the apostles let's
[40:17] pray Heavenly
[40:19] Father we just love you
[40:22] Lord I always get nervous Lord when I
[40:24] get up
[40:26] here and Lord we just ask you father God
[40:30] to help me I pray Lord that you bless
[40:33] your children father God we got many
[40:37] that are not feeling well we ask you
[40:39] Lord to be with them and Lord we just
[40:43] ask you Lord to to be in this service
[40:46] Lord we thank you for the songs
[40:49] Lord we're so thankful that you have
[40:52] given us an opportunity to be Overcomers
[40:55] in this day
[40:57] and Lord we just ask you to help me with
[40:59] this little thought and Lord I pray you
[41:02] bless each and every heart those that
[41:04] are listening in Lord I pray that you
[41:06] bless them we thank you for all you do
[41:09] for us in Jesus name amen you may be
[41:14] seated I would like to minister just a
[41:16] little thought here sons of God has
[41:23] Authority but to have authority you have
[41:26] to be an overcomer
[41:30] and so your
[41:32] soul is the only thing that God's coming
[41:35] back for he's not coming back for your
[41:38] mind he's not coming back for your
[41:41] flesh because we were born in the shape
[41:44] of iniquity of speaking
[41:46] lies in a in a a marriage from a man and
[41:51] woman being born in this world we've got
[41:55] the
[41:56] worldly flesh our mind is perverted
[42:00] because of the things of this world has
[42:03] put out there so that you and I can grow
[42:06] as a little boy to a per to a man if you
[42:10] haven't had God in a young age you're
[42:12] going to get more trash of this world
[42:15] laying inside of your mind and what's so
[42:17] sad is even after you're born again and
[42:20] you got the spirit of God if you're not
[42:21] careful you'll still get the things of
[42:24] this world in your mind that's the
[42:26] hardest place to get things out of our
[42:28] mind is the things of the world and not
[42:30] only getting the things of the world out
[42:32] of your mind but doubt doubt is one of
[42:35] the greatest things that that hinders
[42:37] you and I is doubt because a lots of
[42:40] times we don't doubt somebody else but
[42:42] we doubt ourselves and we look in the
[42:44] mirror and we say we're no good for this
[42:46] we're not this and this and that it
[42:47] doesn't matter what you think it's what
[42:50] the word says what he thinks about you
[42:53] and that's why you got to stay in the
[42:55] word of God to make sure that he's the
[42:58] one that's kicking that foot out for you
[43:01] so you can flip that cow over every
[43:04] every burden that you've got we've got
[43:06] to let God have his control into it but
[43:10] there is a control that you and I have
[43:12] to have so that God can control the
[43:16] situations because this flesh is
[43:19] sticky Paul says I Die daily it's not
[43:23] because he sinned every day it's because
[43:26] he's getting his mind mind cleaned he's
[43:28] getting his flesh out of the way so that
[43:31] he can have fellowship with the word so
[43:34] that he can be able to be a witness as
[43:38] Paul was a I mean Peter was a witness
[43:40] after he got pervert after he got
[43:45] saved but when he was not saved he
[43:48] wanted to cut people's ears off he
[43:50] wanted to protect Jesus he wanted to do
[43:52] this and do that he even lied and he
[43:55] cursed
[43:57] but see today it's so wicked for our
[44:00] little ones here the other day I was
[44:02] waiting for Sharon and and so I'm
[44:04] sitting there in this this this this
[44:06] building and and this man and this woman
[44:09] was sitting there with her little boy
[44:10] and this little boy was doing something
[44:12] and his daddy says son get over here and
[44:14] the little boy cursed him and he thought
[44:17] it was funny they were laughing about
[44:22] it the worldly things in this world is
[44:25] going to go into that boy mind that he's
[44:28] got a in his mind he will be able to say
[44:32] Daddy no and he's just going to laugh at
[44:36] him that boy's going to grow up one of
[44:39] these days and tell everybody no he's
[44:41] going to be a rotten no good
[44:46] kid he's going to be full of the devil
[44:49] and it wasn't even his fault that's why
[44:52] it's important for us parents to make
[44:54] sure our children is raised in The Godly
[45:00] atmosphere because you're the ones going
[45:02] to be judged for what your children are
[45:04] doing and so I look at it
[45:08] here God's coming back for the Soul Your
[45:12] Soul has to have all control of your
[45:15] mind and body all
[45:17] right and the way that we even ever get
[45:21] to a place is there's something on the
[45:24] inside deep my brother always said this
[45:27] to me when I was a young boy he said
[45:30] when I didn't want to do something he
[45:32] brother William he goes you're going to
[45:33] have to reach way down deep
[45:36] inside and get after
[45:40] it and that's the truth if we're going
[45:43] to call ourselves
[45:46] Christians then we've got to reach way
[45:48] down deep
[45:50] inside and let this soul that has been
[45:53] redeemed if you really believe that you
[45:56] re
[45:58] redeemed I wonder sometimes are we we
[46:01] hear the preacher talk about Redemption
[46:04] we hear the preacher talk about
[46:06] salvation we hear all these great things
[46:08] and we get so caught up all the time
[46:10] saying Amen brother amen oh it gets the
[46:13] preacher going it gets everybody else
[46:15] going but is it going through one ear
[46:17] and out the other going through this ear
[46:20] and out this way you've got to have that
[46:23] whatever comes across this Pulpit if
[46:26] it's the word
[46:27] you've got to let that word drop down
[46:29] into that soul that God prepared so that
[46:33] Soul can have
[46:36] authority it cannot have authority if
[46:38] it's just in the mind or in this flesh
[46:41] right brother B says you can have the
[46:43] Holy Ghost every day and still go to
[46:44] hell what is he talking about the Holy
[46:47] Ghost can tackle you and touch your body
[46:50] and make you feel good he wants to put
[46:53] you a good pattern once in a while on
[46:54] the back but you got to have him living
[46:57] inside of
[46:58] you he has to have the complete control
[47:02] in your life if he doesn't have the
[47:05] complete control in your life you are
[47:07] going to suffer as
[47:09] Christians you're up and down you're up
[47:12] and down you're up and down is because
[47:14] it's a head knowledge it ain't a soul
[47:18] Revelation it has to come into the soul
[47:21] that Soul had to be prepared for you to
[47:25] receive word we had to come down to an
[47:28] altar it might have been in a car it
[47:30] might have been at a job site it might
[47:32] have been in church but you have to
[47:35] repent repenting is giving up your
[47:38] Authority and letting God come in to
[47:41] wash you
[47:43] clean because when you get up in
[47:45] justification it doesn't mean that
[47:47] you're peer
[47:48] clean now he starts working on the
[47:51] inside he's got the Mind thinking now
[47:54] you got a thought saying hey I'm a
[47:56] sinner I need to be
[47:58] saved he saved you he's got you in his
[48:03] hands but now he's got to wash you by
[48:07] the word and if you're not picking up
[48:09] your Bible and if you're not reading the
[48:11] message of the hour how is he going to
[48:14] help you to get clean how is he going to
[48:18] help you to have faith he gave you
[48:21] enough Faith to get off your seat to
[48:23] come and repent because you had to reach
[48:25] down deep in died sometime this this is
[48:28] a Warfare not between you and the Satan
[48:31] if you can recognize who you are today
[48:35] the Bible says the prophet of God says
[48:37] the devil has to listen to you because
[48:40] real Authority comes from who God and if
[48:45] he's living inside of you then every
[48:47] devil has to listen to you we're
[48:50] fighting the devil way too much we need
[48:53] to stop right here and look in the
[48:54] mirror and say this man needs
[48:57] a good whooping by
[48:59] myself and that is getting down on my
[49:02] knees and crying out to God and asking
[49:04] him the right way to get this body get
[49:07] this mind clean and Washed by the Water
[49:11] of the word hallelujah so I can sit in
[49:13] Heavenly places in Christ
[49:15] Jesus the definition of authority
[49:19] because listen we have a
[49:22] fight this Soul has to fight every inch
[49:24] he gets because this is thing sticky and
[49:27] because this thing is sticky then the
[49:29] Devil comes by and throws stuff on it to
[49:31] make it more
[49:32] stickier so you're not only fighting
[49:35] yourself you are fighting against Satan
[49:37] but if you don't have something that can
[49:40] back you up you're lost you're not going
[49:43] to make
[49:46] it and so here is definition here of
[49:50] authority is a power or right to do
[49:54] something given by a higher Authority in
[49:58] the New Testament that giving Authority
[50:01] is
[50:02] linked to the precious Holy Ghost the
[50:07] Bible says that people have been given
[50:10] Authority in Christ to Aventure in God's
[50:13] kingdom heal the sick defeat Satan and
[50:17] the power of Darkness Romans 13 And1 it
[50:22] says let every soul be subject into the
[50:25] higher pow
[50:27] for there is no power but of god the
[50:31] powers that be our he says excuse me the
[50:36] powers that be
[50:41] our our
[50:43] scar I need new glasses don't
[50:47] I okay the powers that be our our our
[50:53] we're having Sunday school lesson here
[50:55] just morning this afternoon ordained of
[50:59] God whosoever therefore resist the power
[51:03] resist the ordinance of God and they
[51:07] that resist shall receive to themselves
[51:11] damnation I don't want that to be
[51:13] me who wants that to be
[51:16] you I want to be so close to
[51:20] God that he has fellowship with me at
[51:24] any time if he whispers to me I'll say
[51:26] yes Lord Here I Am Lord yes what you
[51:30] need Lord yes I don't want it to just be
[51:33] me saying Lord I need this I need that
[51:36] but no I need the Lord once in a while
[51:37] to come down and say hey son I got your
[51:40] back but he can't and we're so bogged up
[51:43] with the things of this world man let me
[51:46] tell you something this thing right here
[51:48] I was preached on this morning if you
[51:51] heard me I said preach on brother I need
[51:53] it yes I'm guilty too
[51:57] he even said he was
[51:58] guilty we need to make a pack as
[52:01] brothers and sisters to back ourselves
[52:03] up and start invting people over and
[52:06] having Fellowship one another instead of
[52:08] having this into dinner table and
[52:10] playing this we should be fellowshipping
[52:12] with your
[52:17] family we got to sharpen our own
[52:21] swords we don't have to we can sharpen
[52:25] together we can talk talk about the
[52:27] things of God and Bible says that two or
[52:29] three gathered in my name I'll be in the
[52:31] midst it's not just church it's at home
[52:34] it's at the park it's in the truck it's
[52:37] wherever you could be start talking
[52:39] about God and he'll come down and he
[52:41] will cleanse you and wash your
[52:44] minds and give you the power to be
[52:48] Overcomers all right but this Authority
[52:52] it's important we hear it all the time
[52:54] we shout hallelujah we got
[52:57] Authority and we walk out and we're
[53:00] defeated because Satan knows if you are
[53:03] a true Son of
[53:06] God he knows because then when he knows
[53:09] he's not looking at you he's looking it
[53:12] something that's in you and that's the
[53:15] glory of God through the holy ghost that
[53:18] great power that fire that is built in
[53:21] now it's in you it's not some Pillar of
[53:25] Fire that's leading you
[53:27] out there but it's in you leading you
[53:29] through what he wants to accomplish in
[53:32] your life
[53:34] Hallelujah and so
[53:37] now he he's talking here and he goes
[53:41] right in your heart remember Christ
[53:44] savior remember he dies for you and if
[53:48] you'll just die to yourself that'll
[53:52] empty your body empty your soul empty
[53:55] your heart and everything of this world
[53:59] and all of its Pleasures then Christ
[54:02] you'll raise with
[54:04] him if you haven't been baptized in the
[54:08] name of Jesus Christ there's the pool
[54:12] it's not full but we can fill it
[54:14] up when you raise up he goes when you
[54:19] raise up out of the water you are raised
[54:24] to walk with Christ
[54:27] in a new
[54:31] life a new
[54:34] life if you and I really recognize what
[54:37] he did on Calvary for you and I it's not
[54:40] going to be a head knowledge it's going
[54:43] to be a revelation from God to the
[54:49] soul and this Soul when it gets
[54:52] Revelation it has power it will be
[54:54] Overcomer of this in the mind and when
[54:57] you have battles in the mind you should
[55:00] be able to say Satan get behind me and
[55:03] he has to flee my Bible says
[55:07] so but we let circumstances we let
[55:11] things of this world overwhelm us until
[55:15] we forget who we are brother R says we
[55:18] forget who we are he'll bless us and we
[55:21] bless and he'll bless us we see Miracles
[55:24] we see Miracles but then all of a sudden
[55:26] when it comes to your time you forget
[55:29] who you
[55:31] are if we're in the word if we're in the
[55:35] book we won't forget who we are because
[55:37] this is us he's already did his part now
[55:41] it's our part to receive the book by
[55:44] eating the book and becoming M Jesus
[55:46] Christ as a body of
[55:48] Believers individuales were Sons and
[55:51] Daughters of
[55:54] God when we got twoo much pride to be
[55:57] able to call a brother up and say
[55:59] brother I am hurting I need your
[56:02] prayer
[56:04] sisters don't have that kind of thing as
[56:07] men we are so bold and man we're we're
[56:10] better than anybody we walk around I
[56:13] don't need nobody it's just me and God
[56:15] I'll take care of this I'm all right no
[56:18] you're not you're a miserable
[56:22] wreck but if we can get to a place and
[56:26] deny this flesh and say no more you're
[56:29] not going to have even um power over me
[56:32] no more because I'm going to read my
[56:34] Bible I'm going to listen to tapes and
[56:36] I'm going to eat the book and I'm going
[56:38] to digest it and it's going down into my
[56:40] soul and it's going to wash me and it's
[56:42] going to cleanse me and it's going to
[56:44] give me the authority to come back at
[56:46] your face and tell you get out of my
[56:49] head get out of my heart get out of my
[56:51] back get out of my
[56:55] feet because there's something in a real
[56:59] believer if you don't know one get in
[57:02] the
[57:05] book you'll find men that had to go in
[57:09] the same church as as you did the first
[57:12] one and had to receive the baptism of
[57:14] the Holy
[57:16] Ghost and they lived God so much because
[57:21] they didn't leave it here they brought
[57:23] it here and that predestined ated Soul
[57:27] started
[57:28] working and when they put their hands on
[57:32] somebody they were sick and a dog before
[57:35] he let the hands up they were
[57:39] healed silver and gold I don't have but
[57:42] what I do have I give unto you stand up
[57:45] and
[57:46] walk that's
[57:48] Authority that's power from God coming
[57:52] to you speaking for him
[57:56] little
[57:57] ambassadors you're the one that God is
[58:00] using to help the church not only
[58:04] yourself but to help the people in the
[58:07] church God places us places so that we
[58:11] can be a body of Believers in
[58:15] power brother says we should come to
[58:17] church and we recognize who we are we
[58:20] shouldn't have one feeble person to
[58:22] leave the
[58:24] church amen
[58:31] Hallelujah he says now no matter how
[58:35] little if you're a little wash
[58:38] woman if you're just a brother that
[58:41] don't have his ABCs don't make no
[58:45] difference who you are you're in Christ
[58:49] triumphant over all things your
[58:52] Authority is over every demon every
[58:56] power that the devil has you're in
[58:58] Christ
[59:01] triumphant we get into that presence
[59:04] Church you won't want to get out of
[59:07] it it's not just for the preacher in the
[59:10] back room and he's praying and seeking
[59:12] God and the Lord Holy Ghost comes down
[59:14] on a man and he comes out here and he's
[59:16] fired up and he's preaching and he's
[59:17] telling you the
[59:20] truth but what is it when you're a man
[59:23] or a preacher or a sister and you're
[59:25] watching dishes and you're now there're
[59:27] in the yard and you're working and
[59:28] you're mowing yard and you talking about
[59:30] God and God starts coming down and you
[59:32] start you start having a good Jubilee on
[59:34] the mower or you're washing
[59:38] dishes or you're at work and somebody's
[59:40] looking at you going what in the world's
[59:42] his
[59:44] problem if you get out of yourself out
[59:47] of the way and let God take over you'll
[59:50] save
[59:51] Souls but if you're in it you're not
[59:54] saving One Soul
[59:56] but if he's operating that gift and he's
[1:00:00] taking care of you and you're listening
[1:00:03] to what the word of God says you have
[1:00:06] authority sons of God hallelujah why
[1:00:11] because it's
[1:00:14] yours I like this message in
[1:00:18] 1953 greater than Soloman is here and
[1:00:21] he's preaching and he's preaching and
[1:00:22] he's preaching and he's he gets down to
[1:00:25] almost to the end before he does his
[1:00:27] prayer and and he's just going off and
[1:00:30] he's talking about the blood and he's
[1:00:31] talking about the Redemption he's
[1:00:33] talking about the kinsman redeemer and
[1:00:35] then all of a sudden he starts singing
[1:00:37] and he sings about two or three songs
[1:00:39] and then he comes in and goes oh don't
[1:00:43] it make you feel all scoured out just
[1:00:47] feel the SED of the presence of God when
[1:00:50] you are the sons of God now we're
[1:00:54] lifting up in the heaven ly places in
[1:00:56] Christ Jesus with all authority Heaven
[1:01:00] and Earth gives to
[1:01:03] us did you ever think of that somebody
[1:01:07] says have you got power no I got
[1:01:11] Authority he
[1:01:13] says what is
[1:01:16] it he's fallen in love with
[1:01:20] him why because brother brandham had a
[1:01:24] revelation who God was he realized that
[1:01:27] he was a sinner he needed saving and he
[1:01:29] gave his whole heart to
[1:01:33] Christ did he make his mistakes
[1:01:35] absolutely he made mistakes but in God's
[1:01:39] eyes he saw a Son of
[1:01:41] God if we're under the
[1:01:44] blood and the blood has covered your
[1:01:47] sins and covered you not only through
[1:01:50] your sins but down into your soul that
[1:01:52] Redemption blood's ripping down in your
[1:01:55] soul
[1:01:57] only thing he sees is that blood he sees
[1:02:00] Christ he sees Sons and Daughters of
[1:02:03] God and if he sees Sons and Daughters of
[1:02:06] God then why don't we use our exercise
[1:02:10] faith and tell the devil it's no more
[1:02:12] devil we're through it's time to stand
[1:02:16] up and stand on our two feet and say
[1:02:19] Satan it's
[1:02:23] over we've got enough scripture we've
[1:02:27] got enough quotes to show where we're at
[1:02:31] today all the critics all the ones are
[1:02:34] saying brother bandam is not this and
[1:02:36] that and that it proves that he was
[1:02:38] right it proves that he was the anointed
[1:02:41] one in Malachi 4 you know he's true
[1:02:44] because it lines up with the scriptures
[1:02:47] all
[1:02:50] right and brother Timothy puit puts that
[1:02:54] thing on there on his uh brother
[1:02:57] Wendell's Minister's chat of that
[1:03:00] car it's amazing now guy walks like he
[1:03:03] said he walks right into the thing he
[1:03:05] sits down in the passenger seat it goes
[1:03:08] around and around and takes him to
[1:03:09] another building he stops he gets
[1:03:13] out walks right up
[1:03:18] there years before a little tiny
[1:03:21] Kentucky
[1:03:23] man was already prophesied
[1:03:26] that if that don't get our our insides
[1:03:30] moving you're
[1:03:33] dead we need to go find find Jesus if
[1:03:36] that ain't going to motivate us enough
[1:03:38] to get on our knees and say oh God I
[1:03:40] need another experience in you I need
[1:03:43] something from you now Lord I need to
[1:03:45] make sure every little dot is dotted
[1:03:48] with your blood I need every sentence
[1:03:51] everything I got washed in the blood of
[1:03:54] the Lamb cover me father God cover
[1:03:57] me don't let me go oh God make sure that
[1:04:01] I've got your
[1:04:03] Authority because devils are going to
[1:04:05] come in and he's going to say oh that's
[1:04:07] a bunch of
[1:04:11] nonsense he just had a an a guess
[1:04:15] thousands and thousands of Visions
[1:04:18] you're telling me that's a
[1:04:20] guess
[1:04:23] hogwash and we got people in this
[1:04:25] message today that dream and they do
[1:04:28] things and they're off on one and people
[1:04:31] just still worshiping it now them guys
[1:04:33] need to come up to the front of the
[1:04:34] church and get that devil laid off of
[1:04:36] them prayed off of them that's what the
[1:04:39] Bible says well the prophet of God said
[1:04:42] but they're all puffed up I don't want
[1:04:44] to be puffed up I want to be in humility
[1:04:48] of the Holy Spirit leading me and
[1:04:50] guiding me and taking care of me making
[1:04:53] me washing me in the
[1:04:56] presence so that I could be the real
[1:04:59] brother William not in this flesh this
[1:05:03] flesh has to go back into the elements
[1:05:04] of this ground it's got to die out this
[1:05:07] mind has to completely die and fade away
[1:05:10] and when God comes and he's ready to
[1:05:13] give you a new
[1:05:14] body he's going to speak the body and
[1:05:18] them elements are going to come up in a
[1:05:20] spoken word revelation body that that
[1:05:24] soul that he is preparing
[1:05:26] will step into that
[1:05:28] body and he'll be just like his
[1:05:34] daddy
[1:05:36] Hallelujah we won't think about Sin
[1:05:38] anymore we won't even have the nature of
[1:05:41] what sin is all about we'll know where
[1:05:43] we come
[1:05:45] from
[1:05:49] but we're running a race today Church
[1:05:53] we're almost at the Finish Line brother
[1:05:55] Steve keep running buddy keep your head
[1:05:57] up buddy we're almost there keep
[1:06:02] running but we still need to listen to
[1:06:04] the
[1:06:06] coach coaches always Tak Ser their
[1:06:09] Runners and they don't run them on the
[1:06:11] same course that they're going to race
[1:06:13] they take them to a course that is worse
[1:06:15] than that course and when they can
[1:06:18] overwhelm that course by the way they
[1:06:20] eat and the way they take their vitamins
[1:06:23] and they drink their water at the end of
[1:06:25] that day or into that month into of that
[1:06:28] year as they run and they run up those
[1:06:31] mountains and when they come to this
[1:06:33] race they already know who they are
[1:06:36] because their coach taught them exactly
[1:06:39] how to win he told them how exactly how
[1:06:42] to keep your stride he told him how
[1:06:43] exactly when you get to this part you
[1:06:45] take off running and you run until you
[1:06:47] get to the top and then you slow down a
[1:06:49] little bit until you get to the next one
[1:06:52] because these guys are these other men
[1:06:54] are going to run at they're going to run
[1:06:56] real fast to the to the mountain and
[1:06:58] then they're going to try to run fast up
[1:06:59] that mountain and you'll be able to walk
[1:07:03] right by them because they're going to
[1:07:05] be gassed out but children of God
[1:07:08] they've got all power in heaven backing
[1:07:11] them
[1:07:12] up it's just like that little police
[1:07:15] officer standing there in the street
[1:07:17] that little fell is about a with his cap
[1:07:19] on he's about 100 PB has a badge stuck
[1:07:23] to him
[1:07:26] bunch of cars starts rolling down the
[1:07:28] road 100 miles an hour he can't stop
[1:07:32] them but when he stands out there with
[1:07:35] that badge on and he puts his hands up
[1:07:38] they start sking and tires are melting
[1:07:42] why because he's got that whole city
[1:07:44] backing him up and when you got your
[1:07:47] heart cleaned out with the word of God
[1:07:50] and God stamps his approval on it you
[1:07:52] can stand there at any devil any place
[1:07:55] any disease and stand there and put your
[1:07:57] hands up and the prophet of God says
[1:08:00] there that devil will
[1:08:04] screamen GL to God brothers and sisters
[1:08:07] brother Brown says he said he'll scream
[1:08:10] and every time you heard him preaching
[1:08:12] and he'd be telling somebody you you
[1:08:14] have cancer and this and this it's gone
[1:08:17] you hear a
[1:08:19] scream what is it he says that devil
[1:08:23] over there is that one screaming over
[1:08:24] here and calling him over here to help
[1:08:28] him but this one here smart enough to
[1:08:30] know that what's backing her up is the
[1:08:33] heaven above standing there in her
[1:08:36] position putting her hands up and saying
[1:08:38] no
[1:08:40] more and they have to
[1:08:42] flee but we've got to get to a place
[1:08:44] that this is not running my life it's
[1:08:47] not running my flesh it's not running my
[1:08:49] desires it's not running my lips it's
[1:08:51] not running my ears or what comes in and
[1:08:53] wugs out
[1:08:58] but this is running my life this is
[1:09:01] telling me what the word of God says
[1:09:03] about me and this is where I'm going to
[1:09:05] line up with my my
[1:09:08] life all right because
[1:09:11] why because that's eternity if it's in
[1:09:17] me Jesus says I'm going to go back to my
[1:09:20] father I can turn around and say the
[1:09:22] same thing this day if I am washed in
[1:09:25] the blood and I've repented of all my
[1:09:27] sins and he's filled me with the baptism
[1:09:29] of the Holy Ghost I have the right to
[1:09:31] say that I'm going back to my
[1:09:33] father whenever that day is I'm going to
[1:09:36] be there and every day until then I'm
[1:09:38] going to serve him and I'm going to wash
[1:09:40] in the word of word in the word wash in
[1:09:42] that water and I'm going to get closer
[1:09:44] to him and closer to him because I'm no
[1:09:47] good to you and I'm not no good to Pine
[1:09:49] I mean uh Pine Top unless I dedicate my
[1:09:53] life and get my life under the word
[1:09:57] not because I want to be somebody I want
[1:09:59] to be dead so God could reign in my life
[1:10:05] Hallelujah I won't be able to help him
[1:10:07] at all if I'm go there because I think
[1:10:09] I'm
[1:10:10] somebody but if I go over there humble
[1:10:13] and I say God you lead me and you lead
[1:10:15] me to the sermons you lead me to what
[1:10:17] you want them to hear and you get me out
[1:10:20] of the way and you teach
[1:10:23] them it will grow
[1:10:25] and the power of God will
[1:10:29] run but you got to look at all
[1:10:31] yourselves look in this church and look
[1:10:34] at each other and say do you love each
[1:10:36] other really do we love each other and
[1:10:38] we love each other they put your
[1:10:40] shoulder to the
[1:10:44] will we do there's only one man that's
[1:10:47] in this church that has the right to go
[1:10:50] to your house and say Hey you better
[1:10:51] step up only one man and that's the one
[1:10:55] that you pay your ties to he's the one
[1:10:58] that is a Shepherd that will go and
[1:10:59] break your leg and put him on your
[1:11:01] should his shoulders and carry you he's
[1:11:04] the only one that can do that the rest
[1:11:07] of
[1:11:08] us we got to get that two4 out of our
[1:11:11] eye
[1:11:12] first and we still don't have the right
[1:11:14] to do
[1:11:17] it God knocked me in the in the wall
[1:11:19] here the other day it's been about three
[1:11:21] we three months a three months
[1:11:23] ago I was listening to brother Brandon
[1:11:26] and he was
[1:11:27] talking he's talking about
[1:11:29] love and all of a sudden I got done I'm
[1:11:31] listening to thinking about what he was
[1:11:33] talking about and all of a sudden this
[1:11:34] this thought came to my mind and
[1:11:37] says why are you so worried about people
[1:11:40] in Pon being 30 minutes
[1:11:44] late when you can't even handle your own
[1:11:49] self just like somebody was speaking to
[1:11:52] me I'm looking around I'm think who in
[1:11:55] the world's in this room with
[1:11:58] me I opened up the door stepped out of
[1:12:01] the the the place I was uh staying in a
[1:12:04] camper and walked all the way around it
[1:12:06] to see if brother brother one of the
[1:12:08] brothers were giving me a hard time or
[1:12:10] something nobody was there I walked in I
[1:12:14] said oh God help me to get that beam out
[1:12:16] of my
[1:12:18] eye and Pastor just preached on it this
[1:12:20] morning
[1:12:25] this side right here is my worst enemy
[1:12:28] besides
[1:12:31] myself I like funny things just like you
[1:12:34] guys do I said oh
[1:12:37] God I need you Lord I cried out to him
[1:12:41] brothers and sisters I wased and I wased
[1:12:44] and I wased in the word I said Lord let
[1:12:47] my eyes only see
[1:12:53] you we don't know what's going on but
[1:12:56] it's not our business our business is to
[1:12:58] pray for our brother our
[1:13:01] sister pray and say oh God whatever
[1:13:04] they're going through let me be a b let
[1:13:07] that burden fall upon me let me pray and
[1:13:11] seek for whatever they're going through
[1:13:13] Lord give me the power Lord to cast
[1:13:17] those Devils out for with her if they're
[1:13:19] getting in a fight Lord let me put my
[1:13:22] shoulder to their shoulder Lord that'll
[1:13:25] help the pastor out more than
[1:13:27] anything why because now the body is
[1:13:30] working
[1:13:31] together the toe needs to be fixed what
[1:13:35] do you do you go grab it and you pull on
[1:13:37] it a little bit and make it pop oh man
[1:13:38] it makes it feel better don't it that's
[1:13:41] how we do
[1:13:42] it praise be to God we see it here he he
[1:13:48] goes he goes on and he says the works
[1:13:51] that I do shall ye do also Christ the
[1:13:54] same yesterday today and forever I
[1:13:56] believe him now we're sitting in
[1:13:58] Heavenly places in the presence of
[1:14:02] Christ lifted up above the cares of the
[1:14:06] world into a realm of
[1:14:11] Faith the only way we're going to get to
[1:14:14] that point is right here this is the
[1:14:16] realm he's talking about we got to get
[1:14:19] into Heavenly places in Christ so that
[1:14:22] he can pull you up into that faith to be
[1:14:25] more than conquerors where that real
[1:14:29] genuine power of God living down inside
[1:14:32] of your soul when you need it the most
[1:14:35] in the time of your desperation you can
[1:14:37] stand there with authority and
[1:14:39] say stop
[1:14:41] Satan and he has to
[1:14:45] stop brother William it's easier than
[1:14:47] what you're saying it's it's harder than
[1:14:49] what you're saying no it
[1:14:51] isn't what's hard is we're too lazy to
[1:14:54] get down on our knees
[1:14:57] we're too
[1:14:59] lazy but it's so easy to push play and
[1:15:03] watch videos it's easier to play a game
[1:15:05] with
[1:15:06] these than getting down on our knees and
[1:15:09] crying out to
[1:15:11] God brother brandham never stopped
[1:15:14] talking
[1:15:16] about prayer uh meetings all the way up
[1:15:19] to his death and if he was here today he
[1:15:22] would still be preaching on it because
[1:15:24] it's
[1:15:25] power every man that we know in history
[1:15:29] was a prayer Warrior that's the reason
[1:15:32] why they had so much overcoming power in
[1:15:36] their day the reason why they had so
[1:15:39] much good results is because they were
[1:15:41] in prayer brother Bram said it was on
[1:15:43] this on the screen this morning prayer
[1:15:47] is the most powerful weapon we
[1:15:50] have because prayer brings love and love
[1:15:53] conquers the world
[1:15:56] Hallelujah but in that realm of faith I
[1:16:00] was I was looking up some
[1:16:03] scriptures and it gave me the scripture
[1:16:07] and I kept reading and I said oh man I
[1:16:08] got to put this down and I go into my
[1:16:10] Bible and it tells me something
[1:16:13] different I'm thinking where's the
[1:16:14] scripture got so I go in there and I
[1:16:16] said okay how many bibles has this
[1:16:19] scripture and it showed me two of them
[1:16:21] that I really liked but I would like you
[1:16:24] to put up
[1:16:25] our scripture of Hebrews uh 12 And1 but
[1:16:29] I'm going to read the other two first
[1:16:31] and then we'll read the uh the one that
[1:16:33] is on our King James version but I
[1:16:35] thought this was really
[1:16:37] good in the new uh International uh uh V
[1:16:43] uh Vision it says Hebrews uh 12 And1 for
[1:16:47] everyone born of God overcomes the world
[1:16:51] this is the victory that has overcome
[1:16:53] the world even our faith in the in the
[1:16:57] new uh living the New Living Translation
[1:17:01] it says Hebrews 12 and one for every
[1:17:04] child of God defeats the evil world and
[1:17:08] we achieve this Victory through our
[1:17:11] faith I thought that was pretty good and
[1:17:14] then it goes on here and it says the way
[1:17:17] we read it in our Scriptures it says
[1:17:20] wherefore seeing we also are comp
[1:17:23] compassed about out with so great of
[1:17:26] clouds of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:17:29] every weight and the sin which do do so
[1:17:33] easily beset
[1:17:36] us and let us run with patience the race
[1:17:40] that is set before
[1:17:43] us all three of them are
[1:17:46] powerful but brothers and sisters we've
[1:17:49] got to learn not just to read it we've
[1:17:52] got to dissect these these
[1:17:55] these scriptures we've got to get in
[1:17:57] there and find the meaning of some of
[1:17:59] these Scriptures it will help you to
[1:18:02] understand what the prophet of God is
[1:18:04] trying to tell us we can't just read and
[1:18:07] say oh I believe it we've got to do our
[1:18:10] study and we've got to get in prayer and
[1:18:12] ask God to give us a revelation of every
[1:18:15] word that proceeded out of the mouth of
[1:18:16] God it's because it's going to be power
[1:18:20] for
[1:18:20] you it's going to help you come to be an
[1:18:24] overcomer is going to give you the
[1:18:26] authority to be able to cast out every
[1:18:30] devil it's going to give you the
[1:18:32] authority in this world that people can
[1:18:35] see that you are really truly a
[1:18:38] Christian they might make fun of you
[1:18:41] sisters but they know that you're real
[1:18:44] they've watched you you've got the
[1:18:47] greatest gift with long hair and and
[1:18:49] these
[1:18:51] dresses because that's the thing on the
[1:18:53] outside that people fight more than
[1:18:55] anything in the denominations the
[1:18:58] preachers say it's okay to wear anything
[1:19:00] you want to he's a perverted man it's
[1:19:03] not he is a man that is full of the
[1:19:06] devil that tells people that but a real
[1:19:09] man that tells you that it's Abomination
[1:19:12] for a woman to wear a man's
[1:19:15] apparel and a man wearing shorts wearing
[1:19:19] these things is
[1:19:22] ungodly something's wrong
[1:19:25] but we got to get to a place that we
[1:19:28] dissect the word of what it really means
[1:19:32] and not what you want it to
[1:19:35] mean we hear people say things and we're
[1:19:38] not listening to the person and we'll
[1:19:41] hear something totally different where
[1:19:43] that person said it because we're not
[1:19:45] giving that person our
[1:19:48] total ears to that
[1:19:52] person if I walk up to my wife say I
[1:19:54] love you y y what did you just say that
[1:19:58] means she wasn't even paying attention
[1:20:00] she's too worried about the
[1:20:06] dishes but we got to get to a place that
[1:20:10] we are considered the other person more
[1:20:13] than
[1:20:15] ourselves they matter to
[1:20:19] us brother William what does that got to
[1:20:21] do with Victory what does that got to do
[1:20:24] with overc
[1:20:25] rers it's a Christian Life a Christian
[1:20:28] life has to have these
[1:20:32] things
[1:20:33] royalty everybody in a royalty family
[1:20:36] has to walk and
[1:20:39] act like the
[1:20:41] king you have to eat just like the king
[1:20:44] you walk like the king you dress like
[1:20:46] the king you do everything as the king
[1:20:49] and Jesus just asked us to be humble
[1:20:52] like Christ
[1:20:55] and to be humble is to die out to
[1:20:58] ourselves and let God take over so that
[1:21:01] he can use that Authority through your
[1:21:04] life and you won't be boggled you'll see
[1:21:08] signs and wonders following you you
[1:21:10] young people can have signs and wonders
[1:21:12] following you brother wle has talked
[1:21:14] about when he was 12 years old laying
[1:21:17] hands on people and they were covered
[1:21:19] blind lies were open in
[1:21:22] Pentecost but see there was something
[1:21:24] down inside of his soul that was called
[1:21:27] predestinated seed of God and God was
[1:21:31] exercising that faith that he had in him
[1:21:33] and before long it came to a word and
[1:21:35] that word changed his life adoption
[1:21:38] series changed the man's life and
[1:21:42] today he's in the fullness of adoption
[1:21:47] waiting for his body change why because
[1:21:51] he fell in love with the maker
[1:21:55] and now there's Authority that comes out
[1:21:58] and it's not him no more it's
[1:22:01] Christ working through
[1:22:04] you as long as you're working on
[1:22:06] yourself he's going to use you in power
[1:22:10] use you for every devil that comes by
[1:22:13] and sometimes he'll use you to knock out
[1:22:16] Devils for your families he says here
[1:22:19] but why don't you just remember that
[1:22:23] you're raised with him
[1:22:25] and you're setting with him the counsel
[1:22:28] of God Christ you're setting with Christ
[1:22:32] with Christ now all authority is right
[1:22:35] with you so why don't you by faith just
[1:22:39] touch His
[1:22:42] Garment what is His Garment it's the
[1:22:46] word it's the word grab a hold to this
[1:22:52] word and eat the book
[1:22:55] and

[1:23:09] 11 and in the morning as they passed by
[1:23:14] they saw a fig tree dried up from the
[1:23:17] roots and
[1:23:18] Peter calling to remembrance said unto
[1:23:21] them
[1:23:22] Master behold the tree which thou cursed
[1:23:27] is withered away and Jesus answered and
[1:23:30] said to them have faith in
[1:23:32] God that's all it is have faith in God
[1:23:36] it's not some great big thing it's have
[1:23:38] faith in God if you have faith in God
[1:23:41] it's going to be easy to read our Bibles
[1:23:43] for every for every I say unto you that
[1:23:47] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:23:51] be removed and be thou cast into thy see
[1:23:55] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:23:58] shall believe that those things which he
[1:24:01] say shall come to pass he shall have
[1:24:04] whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto
[1:24:08] you what things soever ye desire When
[1:24:11] you pray believe that he receive them
[1:24:15] and he shall have
[1:24:18] them brothers and
[1:24:22] sisters I know every one of you love
[1:24:27] God some of you guys are a whole lot
[1:24:29] smarter than I
[1:24:32] am but one thing that God has given
[1:24:38] me he gave me eternal
[1:24:42] life and eight 19 years old in high
[1:24:47] school should have been only 17 years
[1:24:49] old when I graduated but I didn't I went
[1:24:52] two more years so I went 14 years and
[1:24:54] school I had a third grade education and
[1:24:57] I know I said this many
[1:25:02] times I had to learn things hands
[1:25:09] on that was my
[1:25:12] experience my first thing I ever had to
[1:25:15] do was feed chickens and cows and horses
[1:25:19] and fix fence and cut wood and I learned
[1:25:23] those things by going going out there
[1:25:24] and Dad teaching me how to do those
[1:25:28] things then I was learned how to be a
[1:25:30] carpenter and I learned how to to be a
[1:25:33] landscaper I learned how to mow yards I
[1:25:36] learned how to to do all kinds of things
[1:25:39] to drill and drill for water and wailed
[1:25:42] and did a whole bunch of these things
[1:25:45] but I never mastered not one of
[1:25:49] them and God has taught me
[1:25:54] as long as I love him he'll guide me and
[1:25:57] he'll lead me to all
[1:26:00] truth when I got down into the murdery d
[1:26:04] d uh dumps and I went back out in the
[1:26:07] world he still holded me up and one day
[1:26:11] when I was fixing to blow my brains out
[1:26:13] God come down and spoke to my heart and
[1:26:16] says if you serve me I'll fix your
[1:26:18] broken
[1:26:20] heart from that day
[1:26:22] forward God had has taken good care of
[1:26:25] me I've made a lot of mistakes I've said
[1:26:29] a lot of things that hurt people I've
[1:26:31] said a lot of things in this church that
[1:26:33] I heard people said things across this
[1:26:35] Pulpit that it wasn't right and I
[1:26:36] shouldn't have
[1:26:37] said and you guys have forgiven me
[1:26:41] because you're
[1:26:43] Christlike but brothers and sisters one

[1:54:26] and um just so glad to have them I
[1:54:30] wanted to just before we dismiss this it
[1:54:32] shouldn't take me very long but we
[1:54:34] talked about uh these boys that had
[1:54:37] asked me yesterday about these seven
[1:54:39] visions and um that brother brandham had
[1:54:43] and so I would mentioned a little bit
[1:54:44] this morning but I'm just going to read
[1:54:45] it to you okay is that all right with
[1:54:47] y'all and um while while their thoughts
[1:54:50] are on this and and and maybe there's
[1:54:53] some other of you young people that have
[1:54:54] not you've probably been raised
[1:54:57] listening but this is um this is this is
[1:55:02] something that brother brandham had um
[1:55:04] or he read this Sunday
[1:55:07] morning June uh
[1:55:10] 1933 he said the Lord spoke to me and
[1:55:15] said that the coming of the Lord was
[1:55:17] drawing
[1:55:18] nigh but that before he came seven major
[1:55:21] Evis uh uh events would
[1:55:24] transpire I wrote them all down and that
[1:55:28] morning gave forth the revelation of the
[1:55:30] Lord the first Vision
[1:55:33] was that M musolini would invade
[1:55:38] Ethiopia and that Nation would fall at
[1:55:40] his
[1:55:41] steps and that Vision surely did cause
[1:55:44] some
[1:55:45] repercussions some were very angry when
[1:55:47] I said
[1:55:49] it and it and would not believe it
[1:55:52] but it happened that way he was he
[1:55:55] walked in there with his modern arms and
[1:55:57] took over and the natives didn't have a
[1:56:00] chance but the vision also said that
[1:56:03] musolini would come to a horrible end
[1:56:06] with his own people turning on him and
[1:56:08] that came to pass exactly as it was said
[1:56:12] the next Vision foretold was an
[1:56:14] Australian by the name of Adolf Hitler
[1:56:18] a
[1:56:20] Austrian um right uh name of Adolf
[1:56:26] Hitler which which uh would rise up as a
[1:56:30] dictator over
[1:56:31] Germany and he would draw the world into
[1:56:35] war it showed the Sig Sig freed line now
[1:56:39] this was 11 years before it happened now
[1:56:42] and how our troops would have a terrible
[1:56:45] time to overcome
[1:56:46] it and then it showed that Hitler would
[1:56:49] come to a mysterious
[1:56:51] end those two have
[1:56:53] happened the third Vision was in the rim
[1:56:56] of world politics for it showed me that
[1:56:58] there would be three isms fascism na uh
[1:57:03] Nazism and uh com uh communism but that
[1:57:07] the first two would be swallowed up into
[1:57:10] the third The Voice admonished watch
[1:57:13] Russia watch Russia keep your eyes on
[1:57:17] the King of the
[1:57:18] North the fourth Vision showed the Great
[1:57:21] advant es in
[1:57:23] science that would come after the second
[1:57:25] world war also science will progress
[1:57:30] especially in the mechanical world
[1:57:32] automobiles will continue to get like an
[1:57:35] egg shape and finally they will build
[1:57:37] one that won't need a steering
[1:57:40] wheel it will be controlled by some
[1:57:42] other power it was headed up in the
[1:57:45] vision of a plastic bubble car that was
[1:57:48] running down beautiful
[1:57:50] highways under a remote control so that
[1:57:53] people appeared seated in this car
[1:57:55] without a steering wheel and they were
[1:57:58] playing some sort of a game to amuse
[1:58:01] themselves now I I want to stop right
[1:58:04] here in 1932 sister Keys won't you won't
[1:58:07] you show the cars of 1932 just real
[1:58:10] quickly so so here's what the cars they
[1:58:14] were cool looking cars uh
[1:58:17] 1932 th those those cars that's what
[1:58:20] they had
[1:58:22] and so you can you can see that that
[1:58:25] they sure didn't look egg shaped um and
[1:58:29] um but brother brandham said before the
[1:58:32] coming of the Lord they would the cars
[1:58:33] would get progressively egg shaped now
[1:58:35] this is this is a prophet seeing this
[1:58:37] okay just show you can go you can go
[1:58:39] through some of these pretty fast on on
[1:58:41] all those egg shaped cars I just I just
[1:58:44] uh some of the modern cars today and um
[1:58:49] uh that are that that we
[1:58:57] have so
[1:59:01] now um go go back to the uh that Google
[1:59:07] car um let's see there was another
[1:59:11] car that one right before
[1:59:14] yeah now that's a self-driving
[1:59:17] car and um that that looks really like
[1:59:21] an egg
[1:59:22] uh you know
[1:59:23] rounded and
[1:59:26] um so you know
[1:59:31] uh but uh but but Elon Musk Elon Musk
[1:59:37] and you can go and show the other this
[1:59:39] this one here this car here does not
[1:59:41] have a steering wheel in it
[1:59:44] whatsoever and um you can goad and show
[1:59:46] that
[1:59:48] that yeah there's that right there
[1:59:50] that's that's inside that's looking
[1:59:53] that's that's looking at it there is no
[1:59:55] steering
[1:59:56] wheel in this car now now brother
[2:00:00] branam God's
[2:00:03] Prophet told us these things that would
[2:00:07] transpire before the coming of the Lord
[2:00:12] now that's that's an incredible thing
[2:00:15] how that how that
[2:00:17] God uh keeps his word as I was saying
[2:00:20] this morning he keeps his word not for
[2:00:24] us to to to to to feel pretty proud that
[2:00:27] we belong to the right
[2:00:31] group he keeps his word so that you will
[2:00:34] know to believe him the Rapture is upon
[2:00:37] us and there should be fervency in our
[2:00:39] heart to serve him to love him to get
[2:00:43] sin out of our Lives to to because
[2:00:46] listen we are fixing to possess the
[2:00:47] Earth friends we are fixing to possess
[2:00:51] this Earth God's fixing to wash it or
[2:00:54] he's he's he's fixing to burn it with
[2:00:55] fire and and we're going to inherit this
[2:00:59] earth now the fifth
[2:01:03] Vision had to do with the moral problem
[2:01:06] of our
[2:01:07] age centering mostly around women God
[2:01:11] showed me that women begin to be out of
[2:01:14] their place with the granting of the
[2:01:16] vote then they would cut off their hair
[2:01:19] or then they cut off their hair which
[2:01:21] signified that they were no longer under
[2:01:23] the authority of a man but insisted on
[2:01:27] either equal rights or in most case more
[2:01:30] than equal rights she adopted man's
[2:01:33] clothing and went into the state of
[2:01:36] undress until the last picture I saw was
[2:01:38] a woman naked excepted except for a
[2:01:41] little fig leaf type
[2:01:44] apron uh with this Vision I saw the
[2:01:46] terrible perversion of a moral plot of
[2:01:50] the whole earth the whole world so now
[2:01:52] again go back to 1932 I didn't get the
[2:01:55] picture for that
[2:01:58] um the way the women dressed in
[2:02:01] 1932 and um you know the uh the women
[2:02:05] still wore dresses women still had long
[2:02:08] hair they had they were beginning to
[2:02:10] Fall From Grace at that
[2:02:12] time but brother bradam seen the he seen
[2:02:17] the he he he seen the state that this
[2:02:20] world was going to be until till we are
[2:02:24] in a total absolute filth and Abyss it's
[2:02:28] it's
[2:02:29] incredible and so I would say but that
[2:02:33] vision is fulfilled now that's five
[2:02:35] visions that have that have taken
[2:02:37] place then in the sixth
[2:02:41] Vision there arose in America a most
[2:02:44] beautiful but a cruel woman she held the
[2:02:47] people in her complete power I believe
[2:02:50] that it was the right of the Roman
[2:02:52] Catholic Church though I knew it could
[2:02:54] possibly be a vision of some woman
[2:02:57] rising in great power in America due to
[2:03:00] a popular vote by
[2:03:02] women another place is remember that's
[2:03:05] thus saith the Lord there will be a
[2:03:06] Roman rule before the end time she'll be
[2:03:10] either she'll either be president vice
[2:03:13] president or it'll be the Catholic
[2:03:15] Church as a woman I've seen her a great
[2:03:18] woman the nation bowed to her it'll be
[2:03:21] one before for the
[2:03:23] end he says thus saith the Lord write it
[2:03:27] down find out you young people see if it
[2:03:30] happens if it isn't then I'm a false
[2:03:32] prophet I saw a great woman stand up
[2:03:35] beautiful looking dressed in high in
[2:03:38] real highly royall like purple and a
[2:03:43] little little parenthesis here she was a
[2:03:47] great ruler in the United States perhaps
[2:03:49] the Catholic Church a woman woman some
[2:03:52] woman I don't know if it'll be the
[2:03:56] Catholic church I don't know I can't say
[2:03:58] the only thing I seen I seen the woman
[2:04:01] that was all and of course you know uh
[2:04:04] you can put that up there you you know
[2:04:06] there there's there is sister or sister
[2:04:09] there's Cala Harris uh re you know
[2:04:13] dressed in in in Royal Purple Royal
[2:04:18] Purple now you know
[2:04:22] he says it's either going to be a
[2:04:23] president she'll either be the uh be be
[2:04:26] he said the woman will rule before the
[2:04:28] end time she'll be either president vice
[2:04:30] president or the Catholic Church as a
[2:04:32] woman he says he he wasn't for sure he
[2:04:35] just saw a woman and so he didn't know
[2:04:37] how it was going to happen but but here
[2:04:40] and I and I want to say she might be a
[2:04:42] giggle a little giggle box everyone
[2:04:44] wants to make fun of her but behind that
[2:04:46] woman she's she's got an
[2:04:49] agenda and uh uh that that woman
[2:04:54] is she she's she's got a heart that is
[2:04:57] totally opposite of that of a Christian
[2:05:01] and um uh you know we don't know what
[2:05:04] God's got but I guarantee you I can I
[2:05:07] can definitely see if she were in power
[2:05:10] she would be willing to prove to the
[2:05:12] world that she's a
[2:05:14] leader so we don't know so but I would
[2:05:18] say I would say we've got a vice
[2:05:22] president and she was sworn into office
[2:05:24] in in in Royal
[2:05:27] Purple six Vision fulfilled he says the
[2:05:31] last and seventh Vision wherein I I
[2:05:35] heard a most terrible
[2:05:37] explosion and as I turned to look I saw
[2:05:40] nothing but debris and craters and smoke
[2:05:45] all over the land of
[2:05:49] America so we can see see
[2:05:52] here that there's only one Vision
[2:05:56] left now when when is that Vision going
[2:06:00] to
[2:06:01] transpire
[2:06:04] well you know
[2:06:07] uh brother brother Brenham uh you know
[2:06:11] did say that that Russia's got a bomb
[2:06:14] that Russia will uh of course we know
[2:06:16] the scripture says that Ro Russia is
[2:06:17] going to drop a bomb on the vaan and uh
[2:06:24] we'll destroy the Vatican once we're
[2:06:26] gone but you
[2:06:29] [Music]
[2:06:30] know uh Russia right now is is really
[2:06:33] flexing her muscle matter of fact
[2:06:36] Russia Russia says that if the World War
[2:06:39] I breaks out the US will be in it and
[2:06:42] and Russia is saying some pretty they're
[2:06:45] flexing their muscles they're getting
[2:06:47] whooped right now uh over there in
[2:06:50] Ukraine they're you know they're they're
[2:06:52] uh I mean they're losing a lot of losing
[2:06:55] a lot of lives and the US is sending
[2:06:58] over weapons and and uh and Ukraine is
[2:07:02] has been lobbing them deeper in into
[2:07:04] Russia and Russia's not
[2:07:06] happy and
[2:07:09] uh and so we we can see that things are
[2:07:13] are really gearing
[2:07:15] up thing things are really gearing up
[2:07:18] and so the coming of the Lord
[2:07:22] is
[2:07:24] so darn
[2:07:28] close
[2:07:29] and
[2:07:32] what uh my my buddy had told me last
[2:07:36] night he said I'm glad that God allowed
[2:07:38] us to come to paon he to to to know
[2:07:42] these things and and I think that's I
[2:07:44] think that's a very sensible thing for a
[2:07:47] a young man to to say and and to and to
[2:07:50] desire
[2:07:53] because God wants all of us to to make
[2:07:55] the Rapture he loves the whole
[2:07:57] world the whole world knows these
[2:07:59] Visions the whole world knows all of all
[2:08:02] of any kind of Mo most preachers have
[2:08:05] heard of brother brandom and they've
[2:08:07] they've they've studied these things but
[2:08:10] I am glad that God
[2:08:13] has given me a heart to love the Lord
[2:08:16] and to take this message and I'm glad to
[2:08:19] see others that have a heart to love him
[2:08:22] and and and we're we're looking to
[2:08:27] that California is is on it's you know
[2:08:32] um
[2:08:34] uh you know
[2:08:36] it Angel of the Lord told Brother
[2:08:40] brandham uh that that California is is
[2:08:43] is going to is going to go under that
[2:08:45] Los Angeles is going to break and go
[2:08:48] beneath the ocean and and and uh um you
[2:08:52] know he says he says in a few he says it
[2:08:56] won't stop
[2:08:57] California Los Angeles will sink it's
[2:09:00] going down she'll slide in the
[2:09:05] ocean he says in the last meeting I I
[2:09:08] had in California while
[2:09:09] speaking didn't know nothing happened
[2:09:12] till I got on the street and I told
[2:09:13] California capernium capernium the city
[2:09:15] that's called by the name of the Angels
[2:09:17] that's Los
[2:09:18] Angeles you've exalted yourself in into
[2:09:21] heaven but you'll be brought down into
[2:09:23] hell for if the mighty works that had
[2:09:26] been done in in Sodom that's been done
[2:09:28] in you it it would be standing to this
[2:09:31] day now the last few days there's been a
[2:09:34] roaring and a popping here coming the
