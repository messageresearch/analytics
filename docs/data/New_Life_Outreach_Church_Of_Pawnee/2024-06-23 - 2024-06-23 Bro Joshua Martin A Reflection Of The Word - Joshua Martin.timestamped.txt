[28:18] Lord such a remedy father to bring us
[28:20] separation father and that we can live a
[28:22] life above reproach Lord God as we come
[28:24] into this service Lord a new opportunity
[28:27] father father God I ask that you would
[28:30] speak to the hearts tonight Lord speak
[28:32] through these lips of clay father Lord I
[28:34] ask that your spirit would come and
[28:36] confirm your word to the hearts father
[28:38] may it edify father Lord may it be not
[28:40] just be another sermon that we hear
[28:42] tonight or another service that we come
[28:44] to Lord but God may we leave this place
[28:47] renewed Lord and energized by your
[28:49] spirit we ask these things in your name
[28:52] amen amen Luke 1 and one the Bible would
[28:55] say for as much as many have taken in
[28:57] hand a set forth in order a declaration
[29:00] of those things which are most likely
[29:02] believed among us even as they delivered
[29:05] them unto us which from the beginning
[29:08] were eyewitnesses and Ministers of the
[29:10] word it seemed good to me also having a
[29:13] perfect understanding of all things from
[29:16] the very first to write unto thee in
[29:18] order most excellent Theophilus that
[29:21] thou mightest know the certainty of
[29:23] those things wherein thou Hast been
[29:25] instructed and John 14 14 and 12 I like
[29:29] how he's putting that that a perfect
[29:32] understanding is bringing a certainty
[29:35] John 14 and2 verily verily I say unto
[29:38] you he that believeth on me the works
[29:41] that I do he shall he do also and
[29:44] Greater Works than these shall he do
[29:46] because I go unto my father and
[29:49] whatsoever things ye shall whatsoever ye
[29:51] shall ask in my name that will I do that
[29:54] the father may be glorified in the son
[29:57] amen you may maybe sea tonight and if I
[29:59] just had a simple thought tonight it
[30:01] would be a reflection of the word and
[30:04] one definition of certainty as I I
[30:07] pointed out a perfect understanding uh
[30:10] brings a certainty one definition of
[30:12] that word certainty is firmness and you
[30:15] know so it took a perfect understanding
[30:18] to bring to us the firmness of the word
[30:21] that we might not that we may know the
[30:23] direction we're going and brother
[30:25] Brandon would say the church can never
[30:27] progress until it knows what grounds
[30:29] it's progressing on and I believe that
[30:32] before anybody can ever move or have
[30:34] real confidential Faith it's first have
[30:37] to know where they stand how to stand
[30:39] and after they make their stand I
[30:41] believe that's essential for you cannot
[30:44] just headlong plunge into something with
[30:46] faith when you don't know where you are
[30:48] plunging and you've got to know and if
[30:50] our faith is set in the right position
[30:53] it gives a constant satisfaction and you
[30:56] know and I like how brother br is
[30:58] putting that the church can never
[30:59] progress until it knows the grounds it's
[31:03] uh progressing upon and so it would take
[31:05] a perfect understanding to give uh
[31:08] positively in a day that there's there
[31:10] that there's negative all around us and
[31:12] I I Clos this morning talking about how
[31:15] we're living in a negative world but
[31:17] there's a positive world that is the
[31:19] word that has been giv to us and we can
[31:21] see that we're living in a day where
[31:23] there's depression anxiety you know no
[31:25] one has a good day anymore you can ask
[31:27] somebody going down the road you know
[31:29] you're having a good day well this
[31:31] happened to me that happened you know
[31:33] this went wrong you know nobody has a
[31:35] good day anymore we're living in a day
[31:37] where it's negative our our our speech
[31:39] is negative you know we're tearing this
[31:41] down or or this ain't right it's a
[31:43] negative world where you can't even
[31:45] believe anybody's word anymore you know
[31:47] but in the midst of that all God has
[31:49] given us a perfect understanding to give
[31:52] us a firmness to know that this one's
[31:55] word may fail this here might not happen
[31:57] the way we want it to happen but there's
[31:59] one thing that is firm that is the word
[32:02] of God and I believe that we have a we
[32:04] have a positive word in this generation
[32:07] that has dissolved all of the doubt and
[32:09] has put us upon a solid rock and brother
[32:12] Brandon would tell us in Redemption has
[32:14] two parts are coming out and entering
[32:16] into two first you have to come out some
[32:19] people wants to bring the world in with
[32:21] them but you've got to come out of the
[32:23] world to enter into Christ and you have
[32:25] to come out of unbelief to enter into
[32:28] Faith there cannot be one thing in your
[32:30] way you really to really have genuine
[32:32] Faith you must leave everything that's
[32:35] contrary to the word of God behind to
[32:37] enter into Faith so before you can move
[32:40] into Faith you got to come out of doubt
[32:43] and that's why we needed a positive word
[32:45] to dissolve the doubts to let us know we
[32:48] can move into the firmness of the word
[32:51] and I believe we're living in a day
[32:53] where the bride is no longer an infant
[32:55] bride but she has grown into maturity
[32:58] and that's why the the uh uh the devil
[33:00] fights so hard against this message
[33:03] because I believe this message is our
[33:05] adoption it's the placing of sons we're
[33:07] not just an infant bride wandering
[33:09] around wondering where we're going
[33:11] wondering what to say but we've come to
[33:13] a place of maturity where we know the
[33:15] grounds we are progressing we know that
[33:18] we're we're being placed into our
[33:20] inheritance being placed into our
[33:22] adoption where the word all of Heaven is
[33:25] backing you up and so we see that the
[33:28] and since this is the casee the devil is
[33:30] coming so hard against this message and
[33:33] brother Brandon would say they want to
[33:34] say the days of Miracles has passed and
[33:37] so forth let him go ahead and say it but
[33:40] let us do the service for the Lord they
[33:42] hated him because they were jealous of
[33:44] him that's the only reason they were
[33:46] jealous they were trying to destroy his
[33:49] influence before the people and the same
[33:51] as they're doing now if they can destroy
[33:54] the influence of the message before the
[33:57] people they've got the thing whipped and
[33:59] so we see what the Devil comes and read
[34:02] what he's after when he comes with doubt
[34:03] when he comes with Skeptics when he
[34:05] comes with criticism he's trying to
[34:07] destroy the influence of the message in
[34:10] our lives you know he's trying to
[34:12] destroy the positivity and that's why
[34:14] there's all these other websites believe
[34:16] the sign you've got this one that's left
[34:18] the message but if you go and look up
[34:20] these these these these guys as life
[34:22] that has left the message there's no
[34:24] reflection there's no reflection of the
[34:26] word you know there there their children
[34:28] are lesbians and there are there was a
[34:30] pastor that had a big old church that
[34:32] has left the message now was daughters
[34:33] are lesbians he's he's drinking beer now
[34:36] his wife was cut cut her hair living in
[34:38] shorts now you know you see they're
[34:40] trying to destroy the influence while
[34:42] they're being on to by they're being uh
[34:44] where they're being influenced by
[34:46] another life but you see we can see the
[34:48] direction that they are going that
[34:51] should put a determination in our life
[34:53] that this message is the truth what they
[34:56] God has no ly but what we have is the
[34:59] life and we see that if the influence of
[35:02] the message is ever destroyed then we're
[35:05] willing to be influenced by something
[35:07] else we're willing to be influenced by
[35:10] what this one says about us or what that
[35:12] one says about us you know but if our
[35:14] influence is on the right thing then it
[35:16] don't matter what anybody says it's what
[35:19] the word says like I was saying this
[35:21] morning and the blood speaks positive
[35:23] things so it don't matter the negativity
[35:25] around us if our influence is on the
[35:28] right thing then we don't matter what
[35:30] they say about us and brother Brandon
[35:32] would say it's a chain you're hanging
[35:34] over hell with it and that's the only
[35:36] thing that'll carry you through when the
[35:39] believer becomes a make believer and
[35:41] lives on one word that's contrary to
[35:43] this word he cuts his fellowship with
[35:45] God and one leag broke and remember your
[35:48] faith in this word is like a chain a
[35:51] chain is its strongest out its weakest
[35:53] length that's right it's the strongest
[35:55] cuz that's all it'll hold and if there's
[35:57] if there's something in the word that's
[35:59] puzzling to you something that you have
[36:01] heard different but they say but they
[36:03] say thee or or that was for the apostles
[36:06] and things that was for a day gone by
[36:08] when the scripture says Jesus Christ is
[36:10] the same yesterday today and forever
[36:12] don't let that be a weakness fortify it
[36:15] hold it up and wrap your life into it
[36:18] because that's the only thing that's
[36:20] going to take you to take you over the
[36:22] Flames of hell that is right and I like
[36:25] how brother Brandon puts it if there's
[36:27] something puzzling to you in the word
[36:29] don't let that be a weakness and I think
[36:32] that that that is some good advice if
[36:34] you run into something and you don't
[36:36] understand don't dwell on it in a way
[36:39] where the devil's going to come and say
[36:41] yep the message is wrong you know oh see
[36:43] here because brother Brandon would tell
[36:44] us we have the devil's we have the
[36:46] answer to the devil's question so I
[36:48] believe this message has every solution
[36:51] to every problem but if it's something
[36:53] puzzling to us and if we're influenced
[36:56] by the wrong thing that question is
[36:58] going to turn to doubt you know cuz one
[37:01] question leads to another question but
[37:03] it's okay to have questions it's natural
[37:05] to have questions but don't let that
[37:07] question turn into doubt because once it
[37:10] turns into doubt then your chain is
[37:13] going to be weaken you know cuz brother
[37:15] Brandon would say this word is what is
[37:17] going to carry you over the Flames of
[37:19] hell and so if your change starts to get
[37:22] weak then you're going to fall right
[37:23] into right into despair right into doubt
[37:26] right into discouragement but if you can
[37:29] remain in the influence with no doubts
[37:32] with no negativity you've got a road
[37:34] that you're walking you've got like I
[37:36] said this morning it's the King's
[37:37] Highway that we are walking upon but you
[37:40] see the Bible would tell us that the
[37:43] name of the Lord is a strong tower and
[37:45] the righteous run into it and are safe
[37:48] but in order to remain safe you got to
[37:50] dwell in it you know and so faith in the
[37:53] positive word is is carrying us over the
[37:57] flame of hell but we got to make sure
[37:59] our our our chain is strong and you know
[38:02] brother Brandon would say and and and I
[38:05] said it again that the scripture says
[38:07] that the angels of God are encamped
[38:09] about those who fear Him so in another
[38:12] world where these five senses do not
[38:14] declare five senses only contact this
[38:17] world if you had no feeling you couldn't
[38:20] feel nothing feeling wouldn't be nothing
[38:22] to you that would be in another world if
[38:25] you had no sight then then then what you
[38:27] look at would be another world you know
[38:30] nothing about it so these five senses is
[38:33] the only thing that God L us that let us
[38:36] use and he says now there was another
[38:39] one called Faith but by faith you walk
[38:42] up a ladder and finally you can get so
[38:44] high until you break into another world
[38:48] which is a vision there you can see and
[38:51] that's so incredible cuz he's saying if
[38:53] you can't see the things that are in
[38:56] front of you are in a another world
[38:58] because you can't tap into that
[39:00] Dimension but if you can see the things
[39:03] that are in another world become clear
[39:05] to you and he says that's the way it is
[39:07] with faith faith you climb up a ladder
[39:10] and you get so high that by a vision you
[39:13] can see what is in another world that's
[39:16] why we have to hang on to our faith
[39:19] because it's faith that Taps into the
[39:21] Unseen World and we and this is simple
[39:23] brother Brandon would tell us that
[39:25] there's pictures going through here
[39:26] there's radio wav right that's going
[39:28] through this building right now but it's
[39:30] in another dimension and you need an
[39:32] instrument to tap into that Dimension
[39:34] and bring it into reality and he says
[39:36] that's what a radio is that's what a
[39:38] television is it Taps into those
[39:40] dimensions and brings those pictures
[39:43] into reality and he would say the
[39:45] promises of God are going through the
[39:47] building right your healing your
[39:48] deliverance the Holy Ghost but it's in
[39:50] another dimension so we needed an
[39:52] instrument which is Faith to tap into
[39:55] that Dimension and bring it into reality
[39:58] and brother brandom says faith climbs up
[40:00] the ladder and looks into another world
[40:03] and by Vision you can see what is there
[40:07] oh my that's why you cannot be dissolved
[40:10] in doubt because it's your faith you
[40:12] know like I was saying this morning
[40:14] brother brandom says hisp would apply
[40:16] the blood and he says it's your faith
[40:18] that applies the token you know so it's
[40:20] your faith that connects you with the
[40:23] supernatural so if you lose your faith
[40:25] you lose the connection that brings you
[40:28] up a ladder where you can see the
[40:31] Supernatural cuz you know you can't see
[40:33] your rapture right now but it's faith
[40:35] that says it's there you can't see the
[40:37] body change right now but it's faith
[40:39] that says it's mine so we cannot allow
[40:42] the influences of Doubt allow the
[40:44] influences of negativity tear down the
[40:47] faith that God has given us in this
[40:50] generation you know brother Brandon
[40:52] would talk about the carnival and would
[40:54] say if you're at the carnival and we
[40:55] didn't have money to get into y'all
[40:57] remember the story says if we didn't
[40:59] have the money to get into it he says
[41:01] what we would do is we'd go to the fence
[41:03] and we would look for a little knole you
[41:05] know and he says I would jump up and
[41:07] grab the top of the fence and would pull
[41:09] myself up and look through the hole but
[41:12] you wasn't able to see it but I was and
[41:15] so you would ask me what do you see and
[41:17] I would tell you that he would tell us
[41:20] that I see a giraffe or or I see this
[41:22] and he would come back down he says then
[41:24] you would ask again well what else is
[41:26] there and so he would jump back up grab
[41:28] a hold of the fence pull himself and
[41:30] look again and would say well there's an
[41:32] elephant there's this there's that and
[41:35] you see brother Brandon was able to see
[41:37] those things in this type we wasn't able
[41:40] to but our faith in his report would put
[41:43] us there oh Hallelujah and brother
[41:46] Brandon would go so high brother brother
[41:47] Brandon would type prophets as Eagles
[41:50] right he says those Eagles would go so
[41:52] high and he says John the Revelator and
[41:54] all of them would see all the way into
[41:56] the millenni him and would report it
[41:58] back they were Eagles that would go up
[42:01] so high and would report what they saw
[42:04] but it's our faith that lifts us up that
[42:07] ladder where we can see the same things
[42:10] that they saw oh if he seen Victory I
[42:13] see Victory if you seen the holy ghost
[42:15] in the age I see the Holy Ghost if you
[42:18] seen a Rapture I see the Rapture I'm not
[42:21] allowing my faith to be dissolved in the
[42:24] doubt but I'm allowing my faith to
[42:26] dissolve the doubt oh Hallelujah but we
[42:29] see what the Brandon would tell us if we
[42:31] lose Faith all of our hopes is gone and
[42:34] if we lose Faith all of our spiritual
[42:36] reality is gone oh my so if you lose
[42:40] your faith our spiritual reality is gone
[42:43] and and and and you notice that it was
[42:46] Jesus that would pray for Peter and
[42:48] would say the the devil desires to have
[42:51] you that he can sift you like wheat but
[42:53] I have prayed for you that you lose not
[42:56] your faith how come he didn't say that
[42:58] you lose not your mind or lose not your
[43:00] courage or or lose not your health or
[43:03] lose this or lose that he knew if he
[43:05] would keep the faith his health would be
[43:08] okay if he keeps the faith his mind
[43:11] might be battered his body might be torn
[43:14] but if he keeps the faith there's
[43:16] nothing the devil can do to destroy him
[43:19] but I believe that he didn't just pray
[43:21] for Peter but he prayed for you he
[43:24] interceded and he's interceding now on
[43:26] your behalf that you lose not your faith
[43:29] oh he didn't say it wouldn't be easy
[43:31] that the cross wouldn't be heavy that
[43:33] the struggles wouldn't be hard but he
[43:35] prayed that you will lose that he will
[43:37] lose not your spiritual reality which is
[43:40] your faith oh Hallelujah that he may
[43:44] sift you like wheat he desired to have
[43:47] you and I'm so glad he's just
[43:49] Desiring the the devil desired to have
[43:52] your mind Desir to have your children
[43:54] desired to have your marriage but if the
[43:57] the faith is there there's nothing he
[43:59] can do but desire and you notice brother
[44:02] Brandon would say to to you my brethren
[44:04] that is standing here tonight you did
[44:06] the only thing you can do when you're
[44:08] convinced that you're wrong then you're
[44:10] convicted of sin something You' done
[44:13] wrong there was only one pardon there
[44:15] was only one way of Pardon and that's
[44:17] through the cross and you've walked up
[44:19] here tonight before the all this people
[44:21] and accepted him as your savior he says
[44:24] and then that was you being convinced
[44:27] that you're wrong convicted that
[44:29] convicted and convinced that he is right
[44:32] convicted that you are wrong and and you
[44:34] know that really struck me that this can
[44:36] happen in the positive as well when
[44:39] you're convinced then you're convicted
[44:41] you see a god a conviction me message
[44:44] convictions don't come by accident it's
[44:46] by you being convinced and you don't
[44:48] become convinced by accident it's you
[44:51] getting all the doubt I hope this okay
[44:52] this evening I know it's slower but you
[44:55] see it's you getting all the doubt out
[44:57] that you can be convinced so it can
[45:00] produce convictions you see you you can
[45:02] look at our elders here brother Merl or
[45:04] or these Elders that are among us you
[45:05] know they didn't get here by accident it
[45:08] was by some convictions you know it was
[45:10] convictions that would stand against the
[45:11] tide convictions that was stand against
[45:14] the pressure and that and we can take a
[45:16] take example as young people that how
[45:18] did they do this it wasn't easy the
[45:21] pressures were hard but they were
[45:22] convinced of it and I say if there's
[45:24] ever a time to be convinced of the
[45:27] message H is today if there's ever a
[45:29] time to get into the tapes for ourself H
[45:32] is today and not just listen to a tape
[45:35] but hear it you know cuz you can listen
[45:37] the the definition of uh of hearing is
[45:40] to do it unconsciously you know you can
[45:42] holler somebody and they hear you but to
[45:44] listen to it you got to make a choice
[45:46] you know so let's not just hear the
[45:48] words of a prophet but let's listen to
[45:50] it let's apply it let's take it more
[45:53] than just an idea or an opinion and put
[45:55] it as an absolute I believe this message
[45:57] is the absolute to the bride it's not an
[46:00] opinion it's not an idea but it's our
[46:02] ticket out of here it's the way that is
[46:04] going to get us Rapture Ready you
[46:06] believe that this this evening but you
[46:09] notice Nicodemus would tell Jesus no man
[46:12] can do these things andless God be with
[46:14] him and you can almost have pity upon
[46:16] Nicodemus because he would realize
[46:18] something different about Jesus but this
[46:21] is more than a man this is more than
[46:23] more than just a a a human human ability
[46:26] but but God has got to be with him but
[46:29] you notice that there was another
[46:31] influence that had convinced him
[46:33] otherwise because the Bible tell us that
[46:35] he would come to Jesus in the middle of
[46:37] the night he was ashamed to be
[46:39] identified with him because he was still
[46:41] tied by another influence and it was
[46:44] because of these influences that Jesus
[46:47] would be upon the Earth God made flesh
[46:50] and they would not recognizing and you
[46:52] see if we're influenced by other things
[46:55] the realities of the world will be right
[46:57] among us but we will not recognize it
[47:00] you know like I was saying this morning
[47:02] that the blood of bulls and goats were
[47:04] types and shadows of the Redeemer to
[47:06] come they could not they would cover sin
[47:08] but they could not divorce sin but
[47:10] whenever Jesus would come he wasn't a
[47:13] type he was the reality he wasn't a form
[47:16] he was the person he wasn't pointing to
[47:19] something but all that they were
[47:21] pointing to was met up in Jesus you know
[47:24] brother Brandon would preach the
[47:25] Masterpiece and would say after after
[47:28] Adam had felled in the in the garden God
[47:30] went back to work to create another
[47:32] Masterpiece you know and brother Brandon
[47:34] would say he would start up the
[47:36] foundation which was the Patriarchs
[47:38] Joseph Jacob Isaac and uh and and
[47:41] Abraham he would move up to the body you
[47:43] know which was the prophets and all of
[47:45] these were pointing to one to come and
[47:48] whenever Jesus come upon the Earth the
[47:50] portion that Abraham had was now in him
[47:54] with fullness what Isaac had was in him
[47:57] what Jacob had what all of these other
[47:59] ones had was in the fullness but because
[48:02] of another influence Nicodemus was in
[48:06] the presence of the fullness and could
[48:08] not recognize it oh my we can be in a
[48:11] message Church hear a message preached
[48:13] but if our influence is from another
[48:16] world or from another another Direction
[48:18] the fullness of the word can be in our
[48:21] midst with the resurrected power with
[48:24] the power to shave and to and to deliver
[48:26] but we will not recognize it if our
[48:29] influence is from somewhere else but you
[48:32] see here stood a perfect reflection of
[48:35] God himself when you seen Jesus you seen
[48:37] the father if you wanted to see the
[48:39] father you looked at Jesus and brother
[48:41] Brandon would say remember he was
[48:43] betrayed all times back through the Old
[48:46] Testament we find him being The Rock in
[48:48] the wilderness that was smitten Rock in
[48:50] the wilderness I am the rock that was in
[48:52] the wilderness but that was the stone
[48:54] that had not come to his Perfection yet
[48:56] but in type form it followed the church
[49:00] to draw from it that he could draw and
[49:02] to give life to those he could give life
[49:05] to but he was The Rock in the wilderness
[49:08] he had not been made man yet he was only
[49:11] a type and so the types they would have
[49:13] in the wilderness Was Made Up in Jesus
[49:16] the Mana that fell in the wilderness was
[49:18] in Jesus Jesus would tell them your
[49:21] fathers ate of the man in the wilderness
[49:23] and are every one of them dead in other
[49:25] words the type that did not have a
[49:28] sustaining power it could quench the
[49:30] hunger but they got hungry again but he
[49:32] would say I am the bread of life that
[49:34] has come out of Heaven if you weat of me
[49:37] you look at the rock that was smitten in
[49:39] the wilderness was a type here was Jesus
[49:42] saying I am the Fountain of Life in
[49:45] other words all of the types through the
[49:47] Old Testament was met in the fullness oh
[49:50] what the Rock had was in the fness what
[49:53] the Mana had was in the fness The Brass
[49:55] serpent was in the fullness the the the
[49:58] Aaron or Moses's Rod was in the fullness
[50:01] and I say little church we're not
[50:03] following a type in this generation
[50:06] we've got the fullness oh what
[50:08] justification had was made up in
[50:10] sanctification what sanctification had
[50:13] was met in 1906 the restoration of the
[50:16] gifts but we're not stuck there we've
[50:18] had to move on to the fullness of the
[50:21] word oh my we're not just Justified
[50:23] we're not just Sanctified we're not just
[50:25] restored to the gift
[50:27] but the life of the word the literal
[50:29] life of the word has come to a body and
[50:32] is reflecting itself oh Hallelujah
[50:35] that's why you got to move on we're
[50:36] thankful for justification but you got
[50:38] to be Sanctified you can't just stay as
[50:41] Sanctified you got to move on to the
[50:43] Holy Ghost but you can't just stay there
[50:45] there's a fullness there's a word that
[50:48] has been given in this generation oh
[50:51] Hallelujah but but the Brandon would say
[50:53] they did it because they didn't know who
[50:55] he was they they didn't know the
[50:57] Vindication of God's word wasn't
[50:59] standing up there on that day now it was
[51:02] that one day excuse me that was right it
[51:05] was that one day just keep them lws and
[51:07] things but the same laws they was
[51:10] keeping was pointing them to a time that
[51:13] he would come to be this man that he was
[51:16] supposed to be they had this part but
[51:19] they didn't take the other part but the
[51:21] Brandon is saying the portion of truth
[51:24] that they had was pointing them to to
[51:26] the fullness and brother Brandon would
[51:28] tell us that all of the denominations
[51:31] denominated around a portion of truth
[51:34] but left the rest of the truth you know
[51:35] if they would just realize what they're
[51:37] hanging on to was pointing to something
[51:40] greater to come you know if the pente
[51:42] costs could never realize that the
[51:44] fullness of the word has come you know
[51:46] brother Brandon would tell us that it's
[51:48] like a man who can write a check but has
[51:50] no money in the bank or the man can
[51:52] write a has the money in the bank but
[51:53] don't don't don't know how to write the
[51:55] check you know here they are they've got
[51:57] portions of truth but they're not
[51:59] willing to move on to the fullness that
[52:02] God has brought in this generation and
[52:05] you know brother Brandon would tell us
[52:07] that here God would enveil himself but
[52:09] then they would Avil him again not by by
[52:12] not by a natural Veil but by a spiritual
[52:14] veil of Creeds and of traditions and
[52:17] brother Brandon would say just like God
[52:19] went to work to make make another
[52:21] Masterpiece in Jesus he would go back to
[52:24] work to make another masterpiece upon
[52:27] the Earth and he would say the church
[52:29] had started there at Pentecost that's
[52:31] where the church had began and he says
[52:33] then it went to the Dark Ages whenever
[52:36] had not see a Rome the church would
[52:37] denominate right and he says he go
[52:39] through the Dark Ages he would have to
[52:41] go into the ground because the corn of
[52:44] wheat if it don't die it abides alone
[52:46] right where the brandom says the life
[52:48] would go into the seed or go into the
[52:50] ground but the life was still there and
[52:53] I think it's so incredible they were
[52:55] persecuted the first church was
[52:57] persecuted they were burnt to the Stak
[52:59] they were crucified the devil was trying
[53:01] to do everything that he could do but
[53:04] the life was still there and brother
[53:06] Brandon would say that it was like the
[53:08] wheat plant youall remember the wheat
[53:10] plant and brother Brandon would says God
[53:12] will bring this life through the
[53:13] reformers and he would say this here a
[53:16] grain of wheat is planted to the end
[53:18] that a single grain of wheat will
[53:20] reproduce and multiply itself it's
[53:23] through a certain process during a
[53:25] certain period of time that a Single
[53:27] Seed will die but in dying the life that
[53:30] was in it will come into a plant which
[53:33] will in turn be a barrier or carrier of
[53:36] that life which is to come back to
[53:39] originality in multiplied form oh like
[53:42] the seed that would go into the ground
[53:45] would come through a process back to the
[53:48] originality but it multiplied for oh
[53:52] that's the day we are living in and
[53:53] brother Brandon would say he would go
[53:55] through a process say he would say here
[53:57] whenever the seed would go into the
[53:59] ground then that life would move into
[54:02] the stock and he says which was Luther
[54:04] the First Reformation and then he says
[54:06] that life would move from the stalk to
[54:09] the tsel which was Wesley and he says
[54:11] then that life would keep on moving it
[54:14] would move into the shook which was 1906
[54:17] the restoration of the gifts but then he
[54:19] says that life would move on again to
[54:22] its originality to back back to what it
[54:26] was when it went into the ground and
[54:28] brother Brandon would say this like in
[54:30] Israel perfect type if we had time I
[54:33] just got a few minutes left but in a
[54:35] perfect type in the beginning everywhere
[54:38] the pillar of fire went was life and God
[54:41] was that light and I don't care if it
[54:43] was midnight whether it was a good
[54:45] selected place when that Pillar of Fire
[54:47] moved the trumpet sounded and Israel
[54:50] moved with it he says hallelujah when
[54:53] the trumpet sounded Martin Luther moved
[54:55] on with it he organized not himself but
[54:58] the man after him God took the life out
[55:01] of that brought it laid it in the grave
[55:03] then out come wesling he saw that great
[55:05] big organization so he sounded a trumpet
[55:08] of sanctification see more of the word
[55:11] when he did out they moved out right out
[55:13] of Luther right into Methodist and when
[55:15] the Pinnacle saw it they sounded a
[55:17] trumpet it's time the return of the
[55:20] gifts see what they did they sounded a
[55:22] trumpet how they come and then they
[55:25] organized but remember after the husk
[55:28] that's three stages that we know of
[55:30] there was nothing left but the grain oh
[55:33] so after the third stage it's back to
[55:36] its
[55:36] originality again so justification made
[55:39] way for sanctification sanctification
[55:42] made room for the baptism of the Holy
[55:44] Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:46] made room for the Holy Ghost himself the
[55:48] person to return back to the word oh
[55:51] Hallelujah that's the day we're living
[55:53] in church we're not living in the first
[55:55] we're living at the end time where the
[55:58] word has come back in its maturity and
[56:01] it's getting a bride ready for Rapture
[56:03] oh hallelujah it's getting a pride to
[56:06] produce the promises of an invincible
[56:09] Army of a spotless Pride it's not your
[56:12] works it's the word back in its
[56:14] originality inside of a body oh
[56:18] hallelujah we're reflection of what this
[56:21] word is not of what you can do not of
[56:24] your ideas we're reflecting the power of
[56:27] the word oh Hallelujah and brother
[56:30] Brandon would say uh how would the bride
[56:33] be brought back to the side of the word
[56:36] because he said it was smitten off of
[56:37] the word he says how would it get back
[56:40] to him he said but Malachi 4 he was to
[56:43] restore back to the original I will
[56:46] restore saith the Lord so the way we're
[56:49] getting back to the originality was by
[56:52] or the original word and brother Brandon
[56:55] would say the stalk and the TOs and the
[56:57] Shu was never the seed but it looked
[56:59] more like the seed as they progressed
[57:02] but he would say that the Shu will look
[57:04] so much like the seed but it would start
[57:07] to pull back and whenever you would pull
[57:09] back there stood The Original Seed oh my
[57:13] but the brandom would say now what did
[57:15] it say what did he say in Revelations 10
[57:17] that would take place why was the trip
[57:19] the Tucson to open to the to the church
[57:23] in the days of the messenger of the
[57:25] seventh angel the seventh angel message
[57:27] the whole word of God would be made
[57:29] manifest the seal that what that uh that
[57:32] what all the stock has left off and why
[57:35] and all about it would be manifest in
[57:37] this time is that what the word said
[57:40] then we see it then here we are where
[57:43] are we at the only thing that the there
[57:46] was only one thing that is the Harvest
[57:49] is here she is dead ripe she is ready
[57:51] now for the coming oh brother br going
[57:54] say the alpha has been become the Omega
[57:57] the seed that went into the ground has
[57:59] come through the process and is now back
[58:02] in its
[58:03] originality oh Hallelujah brother
[58:05] brandom you know he would have the
[58:07] vision he would have the vision of the
[58:09] preview of the Bride y'all remember that
[58:12] and it was it was sort of neat because
[58:13] we was in Jeffersonville uh a few months
[58:16] back or or whenever it was and we was
[58:18] able to go to the shopping center to
[58:20] where this was at it was sort of neat
[58:22] you know hearing brother brandom tell
[58:24] this and reading it and here we are at
[58:26] the location of it you know brother
[58:27] Brandon would have a vision and he would
[58:29] say there was a man there was a voice
[58:31] with him that would tell him I'm going
[58:33] to give you a preview of The Bride you
[58:35] remember that he says here would come
[58:36] the bride and he would say it was they
[58:38] were long dresses no makeup lone care he
[58:41] says there were just beautiful and he
[58:43] says they were marching on they were
[58:45] looking up and marching and then the
[58:47] voice would say I'm giving you a preview
[58:49] of the church and he says here would
[58:50] come the church we all we all know the
[58:52] vision here would come the church you
[58:53] know they were ugly they they were
[58:55] dressed red and he says then the
[58:57] American church will come and here would
[58:59] come the American church he would say
[59:01] they were naked dancing the worldly
[59:03] music and his heart would begin to break
[59:05] you know is this all that we could
[59:07] produce you know and then he heard the
[59:09] voice saying the the the bride will come
[59:12] and previe youw again oh my and here
[59:15] would come the bride and he says they
[59:16] were dressed the same and he says they
[59:18] were all in different different garments
[59:21] but they were all modest and he says you
[59:23] notice that the Bride come twice but the
[59:26] church came once he says how come
[59:29] because the same bride the same seed
[59:32] that went into the ground in the
[59:33] beginning is the same seed that has come
[59:37] back in its originality in the end time
[59:40] oh my the devil has tried to destroy
[59:43] this life but he has not got enough
[59:45] power to keep you down he may throw
[59:48] complexes he may throw insecurities but
[59:50] there's a life on the inside of this
[59:53] bride that is reflecting the word and
[59:56] you know he would say that the Bride
[59:58] come twice the church came once and he
[1:00:00] says you notice how come they were all
[1:00:02] dressed differently cuz he says that
[1:00:04] represents the bride around the world of
[1:00:06] many different many different nations he
[1:00:08] says this one may have been German you
[1:00:10] know I'm so thankful that it ain't just
[1:00:12] Americans that it's going to make a
[1:00:13] Rapture that it's making up the bride
[1:00:15] but it's there maybe in Russia or in
[1:00:18] Germany or in Australia wherever it is
[1:00:20] it is all making up the same word making
[1:00:23] up the same bride oh Hallelujah but you
[1:00:26] will see that whenever Jesus was upon
[1:00:29] the Earth what would he would say he
[1:00:31] would say go to the upper room and tell
[1:00:33] you're end doed with power upon High
[1:00:36] then the life would go from one person
[1:00:38] to multiple people and brother Brandon
[1:00:40] would say here he Has Come Today he says
[1:00:42] not in a man but now in Men In other
[1:00:45] words not just one person but it's in a
[1:00:48] multiplied form and I believe we're more
[1:00:50] than just the church but we are the
[1:00:53] literal spoken word of Jesus Christ and
[1:00:56] you know the Bible would say that they
[1:00:57] looked at Peter and John and perceived
[1:01:00] that they were ignorant and unlearned
[1:01:02] men but they took notice they had been
[1:01:05] with Jesus and I said let me be that let
[1:01:07] that be my testimony I might not have
[1:01:09] much I might not look like much I might
[1:01:11] be look like ignorant and unlearned but
[1:01:14] let them take notice that I have been
[1:01:16] with Jesus and what what would give this
[1:01:19] what would give this reflection I think
[1:01:21] it was Peter and John that would walk by
[1:01:23] the gate beautiful and would say silver
[1:01:25] and Gold Have I None but what I do have
[1:01:29] I give unto thee they was just a
[1:01:31] reflection of what Jesus was they didn't
[1:01:34] have anything to offer but the
[1:01:36] supernatural oh man I see that's what
[1:01:39] the bride has might not have much to
[1:01:41] offer but we've got the supernatural
[1:01:43] we've got the supernatural in our homes
[1:01:45] we've got the supernatural in our
[1:01:47] marriages we've got the supernatural
[1:01:49] when we go to work the supernatural goes
[1:01:52] with us you know brother Brandon would
[1:01:53] say the angel of the Lord accompanies
[1:01:55] the message over and you know I always
[1:01:57] listen to messages at chur or when I'm
[1:01:59] working and that's comforting that
[1:02:01] whenever I'm at work the angel of the
[1:02:02] Lord's with me when I go through a trial
[1:02:04] the angel of the Lord is with me that's
[1:02:06] why we play those tapes because that is
[1:02:08] the Angel of the Lord that is
[1:02:10] accompanying it if it's young boys play
[1:02:12] those tapes young girls play those tapes
[1:02:15] it ain't you're not too young to get
[1:02:17] into the into this word and get a
[1:02:19] revelation you know I remember I think I
[1:02:22] was probably 15 or 16 and you know here
[1:02:24] would come the the Je 's Witnesses you
[1:02:27] know would come up and and would try to
[1:02:29] debate you know and I remember this
[1:02:30] finally okay I'll talk with you and he
[1:02:33] he had a pamphlet you know and he would
[1:02:34] say okay you know what do you want to
[1:02:36] talk about out of these out of these
[1:02:38] these subjects and I said let's talk
[1:02:40] about the godhead you know and here we
[1:02:41] go I was a teenage boy running around in
[1:02:44] circles around this guy and he would say
[1:02:46] you know what let's have another meeting
[1:02:48] I got to go I don't have enough time
[1:02:49] today he would go back and he would come
[1:02:51] back again the next week with some more
[1:02:53] material we would go round and round he
[1:02:55] will leave again come back the next week
[1:02:57] you know and here we was mowing I think
[1:03:00] it was a few weeks later I was out
[1:03:02] Mowing and here comes some more
[1:03:03] Jehovah's Witnesses you know and they
[1:03:05] would come up and would say hey we're
[1:03:07] talking and he they would say what do
[1:03:08] you want to talk about I said well I
[1:03:10] think I got water baptism that time I
[1:03:12] said well let's talk about this one and
[1:03:14] we started to talk and she stopped and
[1:03:16] she says wait what's your name and I
[1:03:17] said I'm Josh Martin she goes oh I've
[1:03:19] heard if you have a good day it was a
[1:03:21] teenage boy that had got into the word
[1:03:24] for himself not an adult I was I wasn't
[1:03:27] even preaching much at that time but it
[1:03:29] was somebody that was under the
[1:03:31] influence that was able to handle a
[1:03:34] sword and that's what we need today is
[1:03:36] somebody Under the Influence that is
[1:03:39] able to handle a sword if the spirits
[1:03:42] come against you you're able to handle
[1:03:44] it if lust comes against you you're able
[1:03:46] to handle it it ain't how much you can
[1:03:48] know it's how much Revelation you can
[1:03:50] get come on now you can know all of it
[1:03:53] but if you don't got a revelation of it
[1:03:55] if you're not influenced by it it's not
[1:03:58] going to do much for
[1:03:59] you oh Hallelujah but we would see that
[1:04:03] God changes his mask but never his
[1:04:05] nature and brother Brandon would say
[1:04:07] whenever whenever Moses or whenever God
[1:04:09] was veiled in Moses he was the Living
[1:04:11] Word to the people and you know whenever
[1:04:14] Moses was veiled when God was veiled
[1:04:16] behind Moses the supernatural accompany
[1:04:19] right here with the the the frogs were
[1:04:20] brought into existence the lice the
[1:04:22] water was turned into blood the
[1:04:24] supernatural fire followed where he was
[1:04:26] veiled whenever he was veiled in the
[1:04:28] prophets It Was Elijah I think that
[1:04:30] would say no there's not going to be no
[1:04:32] rain nor due till I call for it the
[1:04:34] supernatural will accompany him because
[1:04:37] God was veiled in him and oh my and the
[1:04:39] same thing today brother the brandom
[1:04:41] says God changes his mask but never his
[1:04:44] nature and so if God is veiled inside of
[1:04:47] a body today that means the superatural
[1:04:50] accompanies it oh hallelujah or our
[1:04:53] skins have been changed and and I know I
[1:04:56] went over some of these things I think a
[1:04:57] few Services ago and by the brand I
[1:04:59] would say that whenever the the the Shak
[1:05:02] Glory was Behind the B your skins he
[1:05:04] says it was once animals behind those
[1:05:07] skins but now with those Skins are a
[1:05:10] housing place for the glory of God and
[1:05:12] then he says so can your skins be
[1:05:14] changed into the housing place for the
[1:05:17] glory of God oh hallelujah what would
[1:05:20] happen behind those Badger skins it was
[1:05:23] dead Aaron's dead Rod right that was
[1:05:25] dead and old and all dried up but in the
[1:05:27] Shina Glory it would Blossom like it did
[1:05:31] at the originality oh the church we
[1:05:34] might have been dead we might have been
[1:05:35] in Creeds but in the shakina of Glory it
[1:05:38] brought back the same life that went
[1:05:41] into the ground at the beginning oh the
[1:05:44] works that I do you shall do I will
[1:05:46] restore sayith the Lord and brother
[1:05:48] Brandon he would preach the restoration
[1:05:50] of the brid tree it would say it was
[1:05:52] four death Messengers that brought life
[1:05:55] brought de death to the tree and he says
[1:05:57] now it's for Life Messengers that has
[1:05:59] brought the life back to the tree and
[1:06:01] it's give me a few more minutes and and
[1:06:03] I'll bring us to a close and but the
[1:06:05] Brandon will tell us that these four
[1:06:06] death Messengers one took the fruit one
[1:06:09] took the leaves one took the bark one
[1:06:11] took the life but he says the roots was
[1:06:13] still there and he says God promised to
[1:06:16] restore and I think it's so incredible
[1:06:19] that he would say and four messengers of
[1:06:21] Death kill the tree four messengers of
[1:06:23] Life restores the tree to you get it he
[1:06:26] says amen for God said I will restore
[1:06:29] he's going to restore it how but death
[1:06:32] Messengers killed it then four life
[1:06:34] Messengers will restore it what was the
[1:06:37] first Martin Luther justification what
[1:06:39] was the second John Wesley
[1:06:41] sanctification what was the third
[1:06:44] Pentecost by the restoration of the
[1:06:46] gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy
[1:06:48] Ghost what was the fourth the word what
[1:06:51] the word and then brother Brandon would
[1:06:53] would go on in the message and would
[1:06:55] call up the fourth light he says there
[1:06:57] was three lights justification
[1:06:58] sanctification the Holy Ghost but he
[1:07:00] says now we're in the fourth light and
[1:07:02] then he ask what is the fourth light and
[1:07:05] he would say the word made manifest oh
[1:07:08] and I thought that was so incredible and
[1:07:09] he says what the fourth was the word
[1:07:11] itself the word made flesh the fruits of
[1:07:15] the proof of the Resurrection sign that
[1:07:18] Christ has finally after justification
[1:07:20] being planted sorry sanctification being
[1:07:22] planted the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:24] organization ations died out and Christ
[1:07:27] has again centered himself like the cap
[1:07:30] of the pyramid first line justification
[1:07:32] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:35] then coming of the cap so what is the
[1:07:38] fourth it is the word made flesh the
[1:07:40] proof of the Resurrection sign what was
[1:07:44] the resurrection sign y'all remember
[1:07:45] whenever they come to Jesus and would
[1:07:47] say give us a sign and he would say as
[1:07:49] Jonah was in the belly of the well for
[1:07:51] three days and nights so will the son of
[1:07:53] man be in the belly of the Earth for for
[1:07:55] three days and nights and so in order
[1:07:57] for there to be a proof of the
[1:07:59] Resurrection sign the body had to come
[1:08:02] to life right cuz we know that the
[1:08:04] spirit was alive the body was in the
[1:08:06] grave but Jesus he would go brother
[1:08:08] Brandon would tell us he would go to he
[1:08:10] would go to hell right and preach to the
[1:08:12] to the souls that was in prison he would
[1:08:14] go up to Paradise right so God didn't
[1:08:16] die the body died so in order for the
[1:08:19] resurrection sign to have proof the body
[1:08:22] had to come out of the Tomb oh
[1:08:25] Hallelujah and what would happen the
[1:08:26] body come out of the Tomb and would meet
[1:08:29] the Tom that was walking on the road to
[1:08:31] EMAs right what would happen as he broke
[1:08:33] the bread they realize he's doing the
[1:08:36] same signs that he did before he died
[1:08:39] before he went into the ground he's
[1:08:41] doing now after he resurrected again oh
[1:08:45] and brother brandom says the fourth
[1:08:46] light is the word made flesh the proof
[1:08:49] of the Resurrection sign what's that
[1:08:52] mean brother Josh the life of God has
[1:08:54] come back to the body the bride of
[1:08:56] Christ has resurrected out of the tombs
[1:08:59] of organizations out of dogmas out of
[1:09:02] traditions and has the same life oh just
[1:09:05] like Jesus broke the bread before he
[1:09:08] went into the ground after he came out
[1:09:10] of the ground he broke the bread the
[1:09:12] same way he had the same signs oh when
[1:09:15] the first church that went into the
[1:09:17] ground the second this last church that
[1:09:19] is risen up again as the same life oh
[1:09:23] brother Brandon would say it be a
[1:09:24] continuation of the book of Acts were a
[1:09:27] reflection of what this word is oh
[1:09:31] Hallelujah his body there had to be a
[1:09:34] body proof that he's alive you're his
[1:09:37] body this evening you're his mouth
[1:09:39] you're his hands you're is feet your is
[1:09:42] life upon the earth oh Hallelujah your
[1:09:47] is life upon the earth oh but the Brad
[1:09:50] of Messiah as Christ was the first one
[1:09:52] to raise from all the prophets and so
[1:09:54] forth although tied in many places he
[1:09:57] was the first fruits of those who slept
[1:10:00] in the bride coming of Christ coming out
[1:10:02] of the church there have to be a sheath
[1:10:04] wave again in the last days oh my waving
[1:10:06] of the sheath what was the sheath the
[1:10:09] first one to come to maturity the that
[1:10:11] the first one that proved it was the
[1:10:13] wheat and it proved that it was the
[1:10:15] Sheep Hallelujah I'm sure you see what
[1:10:18] I'm talking about it was waved over the
[1:10:20] people and the first time the first time
[1:10:22] there would come forth for the bright
[1:10:24] age for a resurrection out of a dark
[1:10:27] denominationalism will be a message but
[1:10:30] the further that the full maturity of
[1:10:32] the word has turned back again in its
[1:10:35] full power and is being waved over the
[1:10:38] People by the same signs Wonders that he
[1:10:41] did back there oh I just love the full
[1:10:44] maturity of the word back to its full
[1:10:46] power the full maturity but like like a
[1:10:49] pastor had said Wednesday it's the
[1:10:51] Living Word the Locos it's the Dynamics
[1:10:54] coming to the mechanics you know brother
[1:10:56] Brandon would stress that so much you
[1:10:58] know and he would say I think it what
[1:11:00] what what what the rising of the sun he
[1:11:02] would say we've got the mechanics down
[1:11:04] we've got the word down but where's the
[1:11:06] Dynamics and here brother Brandon was
[1:11:08] saying the full the word is coming as
[1:11:10] maturity with its full power oh my
[1:11:14] that's what I want this evening is power

[1:11:43] many how many false impersonators rise
[1:11:45] from Janus and jambers with all their
[1:11:47] gimmicks to do everything that Moses did
[1:11:50] never shook him or Aaron at all they
[1:11:53] know like job they knew knew who their
[1:11:55] inspiration come from they knew it was

[1:12:15] the Lord you know brother Brandon would
[1:12:17] say that Moses would write he would meet
[1:12:19] the pillar of fire and by Revelation he
[1:12:22] would write the four books of the of the
[1:12:24] Old Testament you know the four the the
[1:12:26] first books he would write up by
[1:12:27] Revelation and then he would say that
[1:12:29] the Apostle Paul would meet the same
[1:12:31] Pillar of Fire in by Revelation would
[1:12:34] say that je Jesus of the new or Jehovah
[1:12:37] of the old is Jesus of the new he would
[1:12:40] say Matthew Mark Luke and John wrote
[1:12:42] what they saw but the Apostle Paul would
[1:12:44] write by Revelation because he metant
[1:12:46] the pillar of fire and then he would say
[1:12:48] the same Pillar of Fire that wrote the
[1:12:50] old and the New Testament is here today
[1:12:54] interpreting what the word says oh
[1:12:57] Hallelujah the same Pillar of Fire that
[1:13:00] gave Revelation to the Apostle Paul to
[1:13:03] say Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the
[1:13:05] new is the same Pillar of Fire that says
[1:13:08] this message is Christ this message is
