[38:28] amen there in 1 Thessalonians the 4th
[38:33] chapter amen it talks starting there at
[38:36] the 13th verse it said I for I would not
[38:38] have you to be ignorant Brethren
[38:40] concerning them which are asleep that ye
[38:42] sorrow not even as others which have no
[38:45] hope for if we believe that Jesus died
[38:48] and rose again even so also them which

[38:55] for we say unto you by the word of the
[38:57] Lord that we which are alive and remain
[38:59] shall

[39:10] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[39:12] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[39:13] Christ shall rise first then we which
[39:16] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[39:18] together with them in the clouds to meet
[39:20] the Lord in the air and we shall be ever
[39:22] with the Lord wherefore Comfort one
[39:25] another with these words
[39:28] thou art with me I want to minister
[39:31] again on the rejoicing in this
[39:34] Revelation that God is with me we looked
[39:38] here as the psalmist depicted going
[39:42] through that Valley of the shadow of
[39:45] death I talked uh last Wednesday night
[39:48] of the influence of the earth and the
[39:51] amen how the death angel is striking
[39:54] amen and those that are without the sea
[39:57] of God Amen we there's there they
[40:01] they've it's just absolutely crazy amen
[40:05] and brother brandham would say in
[40:07] Watchman what of the night he said oh my
[40:09] friends listen to thus sayith the Lord
[40:11] if you consider me to be a servant it's
[40:14] just before the break of day amen just
[40:18] before the break of day and that's why
[40:21] this horrible Gloom is over the Earth
[40:23] it's just before the coming of the Lord
[40:25] Jesus there's no hope left left and
[40:28] nothing but his coming nations are
[40:30] against Nations they have fooled through
[40:32] God's uh laboratory until they got the
[40:35] power to blow one another up into Atomic
[40:38] ashes they're Wicked they're unreligious
[40:40] they're un Christlike and the only
[40:43] motive they have an objective is to
[40:45] destroy and they are inspired by the
[40:48] destroying angel that was sent from
[40:50] heaven to inspire these men let me say
[40:54] in the name of the Lord Jesus the Holy
[40:56] Spirit has sent as a Watchman on the
[40:58] tower and as people cry what of the
[41:01] night are you weary of this life are you
[41:05] wey of sin are you weary of funeral
[41:07] processions and sickness and ungodliness
[41:09] and on every hand has night been long
[41:12] and weary what of the night Watchmen he
[41:15] said the the morning cometh and he then
[41:18] brother brandham would say see the
[41:20] comfort and so as we look here this is
[41:23] the kind amen of of environment that we
[41:27] are in the destroying Angel is all
[41:30] around and and we can see the sickness
[41:33] there are diseases it seems like amen
[41:36] you there's no one safe anymore amen
[41:39] we're battling uh every kind of a
[41:42] disease and every kind even in the bride
[41:45] right here we amen we we are fighting
[41:47] sicknesses and our and and our and our
[41:49] bodies just seemed like amen they can't
[41:52] hold up like they used to hold up amen
[41:55] but in it all there is a Revelation that
[41:58] God is with me the promise was amen that
[42:03] in these days that Christ himself should
[42:06] descend can you say amen amen there in
[42:09] Isaiah 45 and22 it was one that brother
[42:11] Brenham loved to quote and he says look
[42:14] unto me and be ye saved all the ends of
[42:18] the Earth for I am God and there is none
[42:23] else God didn't sin in this day he
[42:26] didn't sin uh amen uh H H help he didn't
[42:30] send an angel to help he didn't send uh
[42:33] amen didn't pacify us with a amen a
[42:36] bishop or a priest or a preacher or amen
[42:39] or even an angel but God himself has
[42:43] come in this last day the Lord himself
[42:48] shall descend can you say Amen you know
[42:50] it's no wonder that we can amen praise
[42:53] the Lord as we did here tonight because
[42:55] the Revelation is
[42:57] I am with you and I'll never leave you
[43:00] nor forsake you amen he truly has become
[43:04] our Salvation can you say amen amen I
[43:07] don't I don't know where you are or what
[43:09] you're facing or amen the situations
[43:12] that you're in but I I think the
[43:14] Revelation that Christ has come in this
[43:18] day should be something that is that
[43:20] means something to us to say that we are
[43:23] in the Rapture to say that we are in the
[43:25] coming of the Lord to say that he has
[43:28] ascended or descended with the shout and
[43:30] with the Trump and and with the uh with
[43:33] the voice and the Trump should mean
[43:36] something to us God wanted you to know
[43:38] that he's not just going to come someday
[43:41] and lift you off this Earth but while
[43:43] the Earth is in its greatest of climax
[43:47] When sin is all around he's letting you
[43:50] know that I'm first going to come before
[43:53] that body change I'm going to come with
[43:56] that shout message I'm going to come
[43:59] with an inspiration I myself I'm not
[44:03] sending an angel I'm not sending a
[44:04] doctor of divinity I am coming down I
[44:07] will be with you and I will lead you
[44:11] home well can you say man amen I as
[44:14] brother Harry was ministering this

[44:26] the heart of God I I I believe when you

[1:09:13] chapter and it says and all that shall
[1:09:16] be found written in the book shall be
[1:09:20] delivered he said the book's going to be
[1:09:22] sealed but when the book's unsealed all
[1:09:25] that's written in the book shall be
[1:09:28] delivered Amen in this day God's not
[1:09:31] wanting you to go down into the ground

[1:09:42] released you will there will be a faith
[1:09:45] released there will be an anointing
[1:09:48] released there will be that you will
[1:09:50] become the voice not because you're
[1:09:53] learning to recite anointing on the word
[1:09:57] is in your heart and you become the
[1:10:00] Living
[1:10:03] Word you got to expect that Hallelujah
[1:10:07] if you understand amen that that faith
[1:10:10] in that word the creative word of God
[1:10:14] will the creative word of God is what
[1:10:16] what what what created everything around
[1:10:18] us the word god having faith in himself
[1:10:22] God having faith in his own word and
[1:10:25] when he spoke it it was just as good as
[1:10:28] done and brother bradam would say Amen
[1:10:31] it might have been a thousand years
[1:10:32] before the that the sun was ever came
[1:10:34] into fru but God never one time went
[1:10:37] back and Revisited it he already spoke
[1:10:39] it he knew it was going to come to pass
[1:10:42] he was the word and when that word is
[1:10:45] released to us in this second phase of
[1:10:48] the Rapture it is a it is a confidence
[1:10:52] God is with me
[1:10:55] right for thy rod and thy staff does
[1:11:00] comfort
[1:11:03] Meen that's the reason why Isaiah 59 and
[1:11:06] 19 says so shall they fear the name of
[1:11:09] the Lord from the West and his glory
[1:11:12] from the rising of the sun amen and when
[1:11:14] the enemy shall come in like a flood the
[1:11:17] spirit of the Lord shall raise up a
[1:11:18] standard against him and the Redeemer
[1:11:20] shall come to Zion which is the church
[1:11:23] and unto them the turn uh from
[1:11:24] transgression and Jacob sayith the Lord
[1:11:27] as for me this is my Covenant with him
[1:11:29] sayith the Lord my spirit is upon thee
[1:11:32] my words which I have put in thy mouth
[1:11:34] shall not depart out of thy mouth nor
[1:11:35] out of the mouth of thy s there is an
[1:11:38] anointing here to make that come to pass
[1:11:43] brother Brandon would say this in the
[1:11:44] mystery of God revealed he would say now
[1:11:46] you see the seals when he was in his
[1:11:49] meditor work back there redeeming but
[1:11:51] someday he comes forth to get the book
[1:11:54] that he's redeemed and all that's in
[1:11:57] this book would be him for that's the
[1:12:00] believer the words in the book and the
[1:12:05] word is
[1:12:07] him now you say now that's just some
[1:12:09] mumble jumble brother random don't even
[1:12:10] make sense there all that's in this book
[1:12:14] would be him okay
[1:12:18] Hallelujah all that's in this book would
[1:12:20] be him yes
[1:12:22] sir right if you can't see Christ from
[1:12:25] kber to kber you got to go back and read
[1:12:27] it
[1:12:28] again all that's in the book would be
[1:12:30] him but then brother Brenham
[1:12:32] says all that's in the book would be him
[1:12:35] for that is the
[1:12:39] believer I thought it was
[1:12:41] him in the beginning was the word the
[1:12:44] word was with God the Word was God the
[1:12:46] word was made flesh in this last day the
[1:12:48] bride has come to her
[1:12:51] completion this is a word bride
[1:12:55] all that's in the book has been
[1:12:58] testifying of your coming and when the
[1:13:02] Revelation comes that he is in me bride
[1:13:10] form right the cover the first the first
[1:13:16] part is the is the revealing of the
[1:13:19] Mysteries it's the declaring it's the
[1:13:22] revealing in flesh it's God saying say
[1:13:25] I'm no longer in the heavens I am now in
[1:13:29] a body that I have
[1:13:34] redeemed it's got to be a revelation now
[1:13:37] if
[1:13:38] not Hallelujah if you don't have that
[1:13:41] Revelation you'll never it's uh I
[1:13:44] believe I brother Sean that was saying
[1:13:47] something uh or amen it was it was one
[1:13:51] of the preachers saying something amen
[1:13:53] over this week or the last couple weeks
[1:13:56] I've heard somewhere amen he said I want
[1:13:58] you to look at the three fa Hallelujah
[1:14:01] here's the three fa he said now the Jews
[1:14:04] Faith Jared says if you come lay hands
[1:14:07] on my daughter yeah then then she will
[1:14:11] live the Gentile faith says if you just
[1:14:16] speak the word I'm a man of authority
[1:14:19] you're a man of authority I say go and
[1:14:22] he goes come come I know you have author
[1:14:25] you just speak the
[1:14:27] word and my servant will
[1:14:30] live those were incredible fa but both
[1:14:33] of those
[1:14:35] individuals were
[1:14:37] needing something outside of
[1:14:42] themselves Jesus had a totally different
[1:14:46] faith on now he did not have something
[1:14:49] outside himself he says I am my father
[1:14:55] are one that's
[1:14:57] right he knew who he was God reside he
[1:15:02] had
[1:15:03] faith not in somebody coming and making
[1:15:06] him something he had faith that he was
[1:15:10] the word in
[1:15:13] flesh Hallelujah now the others were
[1:15:16] saying if you would come and lay hands
[1:15:19] another one if you would speak Jesus
[1:15:22] stood there he didn't have to look
[1:15:24] somewh else he said peace be still and
[1:15:28] the winds obeyed him brother Bram says
[1:15:31] if he has faith for himself and knew who
[1:15:36] he was in that Revelation how much more
[1:15:41] in the second phase that God the bride
[1:15:44] should have a revelation of who you are
[1:15:49] in the unveiled mystery
[1:15:55] all that's in the book would be him for
[1:15:57] that is the
[1:15:59] believer amen for the words in the book
[1:16:04] and the word is him now what do we do
[1:16:08] hallelujah what what is required of me
[1:16:10] do I have to do I have to do anything no

[1:16:23] is nothing outside beside you for you
[1:16:27] are the bride coming of
[1:16:29] Christ

[1:16:41] can't get a hold of Mama and you can't
[1:16:42] get a hold of no one else you can
[1:16:44] realize
[1:16:46] that I am this phase I am the final

[1:17:43] like you're the the lowest in the church

[1:18:13] and and the Bible says that God come

[1:18:50] understand amen and you look you can
[1:18:52] look through the scriptures and and how
[1:18:54] that once the Revelation strikes once
[1:18:57] that Revelation strikes something amen
[1:19:00] it changes your attitude about it if if
[1:19:03] you if if you don't know what you're
[1:19:05] supposed to do or who you are on the job
[1:19:08] it's hard for you to really fulfill your
[1:19:09] duty but once you know what God wants
[1:19:13] done with
[1:19:15] you and you know that the power of God
[1:19:18] is residing in you you don't have to
[1:19:19] question it anymore
[1:19:22] amen I am the devil's worst
[1:19:26] nightmare see it's because it's not a
[1:19:29] mental thing it's divine revelation

[1:20:02] be a people that he is coming down and
[1:20:06] he is revealing himself to and through
[1:20:10] and the ones that the devil has
[1:20:12] tormented and tormented and tormented is
[1:20:15] catching a revelation and through that
[1:20:18] Revelation Satan is starting to lose his
[1:20:21] grip on you because Satan's found out
[1:20:25] that he thinks that you're just a reject
[1:20:27] and you're not a reject God has got an
[1:20:31] eternal purpose through you and when he

[1:21:09] saying this one is worth Hallelujah is
[1:21:13] worth everything to me amen now when you

[1:21:19] Christ Living his word believing his
[1:21:21] word doing that through you now brother
[1:21:23] Bram would would would talk about the uh
[1:21:26] woman the shunamite woman amen now she
[1:21:30] had prepared a place let me just say
[1:21:32] this she would she had prepared a place
[1:21:33] for the word she prepared a place for

[1:21:42] the house amen when he comes through
[1:21:45] that that we can uh that we can you know
[1:21:48] uh let him rest she prepared a place for
[1:21:51] the word then what took place because
[1:21:54] she prepared the place for the word then
[1:21:57] the word came back and opened her womb
[1:22:02] she had never been able to have a child
[1:22:04] but because she prepared a place for the
[1:22:06] word the word opened up her womb she was
[1:22:10] a stir woman amen and she gave
[1:22:15] birth to the promise yeah he had asked
[1:22:19] what can I do for this woman and his
[1:22:21] servant says well I've asked her and she
[1:22:24] she he says says can I can I mention
[1:22:25] something to the king can I do this that
[1:22:27] other the woman says no we don't I don't

[1:22:34] of the Lord says h i and and and I'll
[1:22:37] give you a child well according to the
[1:22:40] time of life she had her child the
[1:22:42] promised word now brother Brandon would
[1:22:43] put it this way he'd said when the woman
[1:22:46] realized that this inspiration was on
[1:22:50] her what
[1:22:52] inspiration she seen the word she
[1:22:56] received the word she built a place for
[1:22:59] the word when this woman realized that
[1:23:03] this inspiration was on her she obeyed
[1:23:06] exactly because she know it was in
[1:23:09] harmony with the supernatural you say
[1:23:11] what are you talking about brother
[1:23:12] brandom I'm trying to base your faith on
[1:23:15] a level with God being Almighty Supreme
[1:23:18] all powerful and omnipotent he hasn't
[1:23:21] changed his nature doesn't change my
[1:23:24] nature might change yours might change
[1:23:25] but God's nature never changed he's
[1:23:27] still Jehovah God that created heaven
[1:23:31] and earth and all the powers in his
[1:23:32] hands he's still the same Jehovah
[1:23:34] tonight he's almighty God he can do all
[1:23:36] things and if he can't do all things
[1:23:37] he's not almighty God inspiration tells
[1:23:40] you that reasonings will say it's not so
[1:23:42] but inspiration says it's so inspiration
[1:23:45] from the soul and not the mind she
[1:23:47] obeyed the
[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:23:53] inspiration what has been poured out
[1:23:55] what is taking what is that Mighty Angel
[1:23:57] what is taking place what has caused you
[1:24:00] to see this open what has what has God
[1:24:03] done when he has
[1:24:04] unveiled it's the supernatural right
[1:24:08] theologians couldn't do
[1:24:12] that theologians didn't open up the
[1:24:16] book brother brandom didn't open up the
[1:24:22] book he wasn't smart
[1:24:27] enough if the theologians weren't smart
[1:24:30] enough brother brandham wouldn't been
[1:24:31] smart
[1:24:33] enough and we can't put anything on
[1:24:35] brother brandham saying it was his
[1:24:38] smarts he was
[1:24:41] wise he knew the
[1:24:44] Supernatural and he knew who he
[1:24:48] was and he obeyed the inspiration
[1:24:54] and he became a voice of authority to
[1:24:59] the seventh Church
[1:25:01] age Oh Glory to God and when the inspir
[1:25:06] it didn't come it was not it was the
[1:25:08] inspiration of God coming through that
[1:25:10] prophet and when it is received you can
[1:25:14] in you can see that this is a
[1:25:16] supernatural move it is not anything
[1:25:20] that that that that that that brother
[1:25:23] brandham had to do with well come on now
[1:25:26] we had all kinds of
[1:25:27] denominations this this is not a
[1:25:29] denomination this is not another group
[1:25:31] this is not another sec this is not
[1:25:33] another idea this was
[1:25:36] God this
[1:25:38] is God
[1:25:40] himself
[1:25:42] descending
[1:25:44] yeahall like he
[1:25:48] promised the inspiration is
[1:25:53] here when the book is open like it's
[1:25:56] promised you can't make that up that's
[1:25:59] scripture when the mighty Angel
[1:26:02] descends with an open
[1:26:04] book hands it to the seventh angel
[1:26:07] messenger he in
[1:26:09] turn amen is declaring to you to go to
[1:26:14] that Supernatural angel don't accept it
[1:26:16] from Brother Brenham accept it from the
[1:26:20] angel now you're going to have to hear
[1:26:22] the voice you're going to have to hear
[1:26:24] the Revelation through the mouth of that
[1:26:27] Prophet but it did not come from the
[1:26:33] prophet it's a supernatural move and
[1:26:36] when you come and you take that and you
[1:26:39] Embrace that it's the
[1:26:42] same as deity speaking you've got it in
[1:26:48] you I believe you can believe for your
[1:26:50] children I believe you can believe for
[1:26:52] your spouses you say brother wend it
[1:26:53] just it's just
[1:26:55] impossible you've got to either accept
[1:26:58] that this message is a natural man with
[1:27:02] a natural message or it's a supernatural
[1:27:05] god with a supernatural message and
[1:27:08] you're going to have to accept these
[1:27:10] things that brother Brandon brought to
[1:27:11] us he brought all three of these to you
[1:27:14] to let you
[1:27:17] know this is already taken care of so so
[1:27:20] you got to mark that out this has been
[1:27:21] revealed through that prophet
[1:27:25] that's already been
[1:27:27] revealed The
[1:27:29] Voice is not a B brother B says what we
[1:27:32] need in Jeffersonville is thousands of
[1:27:35] Living
[1:27:37] Voices thundering out and humility and
[1:27:42] Sweetness in other words
[1:27:47] believing Hallelujah the
[1:27:51] supernatural God that came in that
[1:27:54] Prophet on Mount
[1:27:56] Sunset and appeared to him and and told
[1:28:00] him to go back and open and and and
[1:28:02] declare the the preacher on the Seven
[1:28:05] Seals what did he
[1:28:07] do he called
[1:28:10] all well praise the
[1:28:12] Lord the shout was fixing to come forth
[1:28:15] and they all gathered right there in
[1:28:16] Jeffersonville
[1:28:20] Indiana and every
[1:28:22] night God God would come down and unveil
[1:28:26] another mystery another mystery another
[1:28:29] M well
[1:28:35] Hallelujah
[1:28:36] why because there is a people who is not
[1:28:41] going to have a magical catching
[1:28:45] away it's a supernatural
[1:28:48] Soul hearing being empowered by a
[1:28:51] supernatural God through super
[1:28:54] Supernatural words and they are standing
[1:28:58] up in faith
[1:29:03] believing yes
[1:29:07] sir amen she obeyed the
[1:29:11] inspiration when the inspiration was on
[1:29:13] the earth
[1:29:15] now read you a last quote here he said
[1:29:18] now no matter how religious you
[1:29:21] are he said now we see we're close to
[1:29:23] the coming of the Lord you've put off
[1:29:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost you may have
[1:29:26] relied upon some sensation maybe uh
[1:29:29] something that you've you've done that
[1:29:32] Satan can impersonate you can't have the
[1:29:33] real spirit in you to go all the way
[1:29:35] into the promises of
[1:29:37] God how can a man that claims to have
[1:29:39] the Holy Ghost deny one word of the
[1:29:41] Bible being not right you can't do it no
[1:29:43] matter how religious you are how many
[1:29:45] churches you belong to how many books
[1:29:47] your names on if that genuine Holy Ghost
[1:29:49] is in you which is the word manifested
[1:29:52] you'll see the message of the hour power
[1:29:54] because it's the holy ghost that does it
[1:29:56] but there has to be something to light
[1:29:58] that
[1:29:59] off inspiration to strike you if you
[1:30:03] pour water on the ground on the ground
[1:30:05] on the ground and there's no seed in
[1:30:06] there to strike it well it'll never
[1:30:08] bring forth anything there's nothing to
[1:30:10] bring forth that is that's the the only
[1:30:12] the elect will see it now this is the
[1:30:14] reason the inspiration struck
[1:30:16] inspiration ain't for those guys out
[1:30:17] there the inspiration is
[1:30:19] for and the devil tries to tell you he
[1:30:22] tries to he tries to get you to looking
[1:30:24] at yourself your situation your Humanity
[1:30:28] God don't want you looking at your
[1:30:30] Humanity God wants you to look at the
[1:30:32] supernatural inspiration that's on the
[1:30:34] earth the seed's already in
[1:30:40] you
[1:30:41] Hallelujah he says now the elected of
[1:30:44] God seen it in Noah's day Moses time
[1:30:47] Jesus time Apostles time Luther's time
[1:30:49] Wesley's time Pentecostal time because
[1:30:52] that was the seed that was on the earth
[1:30:54] when this inspiration poured out now
[1:30:57] while the in this inspiration is poured
[1:30:59] out to gather the bride together it's
[1:31:02] only those that are elected will see it
[1:31:04] Jesus says I thank thee father I thank
[1:31:07] thee um Hallelujah thou has hid this
[1:31:11] from these things from the Wise Eyes of
[1:31:13] the wise and The Prudent revealed to v
[1:31:15] such as we learn now inspiration has to
[1:31:18] strike that inspiration has to strike it
[1:31:21] and when the inspir inspiration struck
[1:31:23] him that that did it he had it then now
[1:31:26] we find out comes a time that these
[1:31:28] crisis when we press right on into it
[1:31:31] now you look around the day look at the
[1:31:33] condition we're living in aren't we
[1:31:35] living in the Sodom modern Sodom and
[1:31:37] Gomorrah hasn't the world come come back
[1:31:40] that was a gentile world that was
[1:31:43] destroyed then by fire didn't Jesus say
[1:31:46] in Luke
[1:31:47] 17 it says uh uh the 28 29 30th verse as
[1:31:52] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[1:31:55] be in the coming of the son of man when
[1:31:56] the son of man is being revealed what is
[1:31:58] revealed it's a secret made known it's a
[1:32:00] revelation it's to reveal to make known
[1:32:03] a secret now these things has been hid
[1:32:07] throughout all the church ages and now
[1:32:10] being
[1:32:11] revealed and made
[1:32:14] known are are are you catching what I'm
[1:32:16] saying now are are you are you
[1:32:17] understanding what brother brandom is is
[1:32:19] is is really really trying to to to hint
[1:32:23] at
[1:32:24] or to point at amen you are anointed the
[1:32:28] under the fifth seal brother Bram says
[1:32:30] he says the martyrs down Through the
[1:32:32] Ages they suffered terribly what were
[1:32:34] they they were under the inspiration the
[1:32:36] spirit of God the power now don't forget
[1:32:39] this church you Brethren that's on tape
[1:32:40] I want you to examine this how could men
[1:32:42] do anything else besides the power of
[1:32:45] God that's been released to them he said
[1:32:47] I'm going to set a box up here to to
[1:32:49] represent that if God sends a spirit a
[1:32:51] certain Spirit among them that's the
[1:32:53] only thing they can work by is the
[1:32:57] spirit that works among them and we'll
[1:32:59] prove that by the history of the church
[1:33:01] then the opening of the seals the powers
[1:33:02] that's let loose exactly the church
[1:33:05] responds to the anointing and can do
[1:33:09] nothing else Hallelujah am I am I making
[1:33:11] any sense to you at all tonight huh
[1:33:14] Hallelujah he's here he's here to do
[1:33:19] what to Quicken the seed of rapture that
[1:33:24] lays in your bosom and he's saying
[1:33:26] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:33:28] shadow of
[1:33:30] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:33:32] with
[1:33:34] me thy rod and thy staff they comfort
[1:33:39] me amen when he's talking about the
[1:33:42] angels He says now he says uh he says
[1:33:44] now they don't know what it's all about
[1:33:45] scientist trying to everyone's got a
[1:33:47] picture of it or anybody got a picture
[1:33:49] of it uh a cloud 26 Mi high in the shape
[1:33:52] of pyramid seven angels represent in
[1:33:53] there brought back to you and brought
[1:33:55] you the word of God under the
[1:33:56] inspiration tells you these hours that
[1:33:59] we're living in amen he goes on down and
[1:34:01] he says that Pillar of Fire that called
[1:34:02] them out and led them from the promised
[1:34:04] land under the anointing of a prophet a
[1:34:06] pillar of fire that they could look at
[1:34:08] amen or are are you understanding aren't
[1:34:11] aren't you proud for that aren't you
[1:34:12] thankful for that hallelujah amen you've
[1:34:16] got to obey it in that season now now
[1:34:18] watch it watch what happens hallelujah
[1:34:21] amen I thought I okay this is the last
[1:34:23] last quote all right amen so now the
[1:34:26] word the word's come all right all right
[1:34:28] the word had to come the Revelation had
[1:34:31] to come catch the Revelation I'm no
[1:34:35] longer oh Church you're not a wannab
[1:34:42] be we're not biting our
[1:34:46] time God came with a specific
[1:34:49] inspiration with a specific Revelation
[1:34:53] that he's not not giving to anybody else
[1:34:54] but
[1:34:56] you and he wants you to believe that
[1:35:01] word because you're going to find out
[1:35:06] Amen brother brandham someone would ask
[1:35:08] him please explain the mystery of the
[1:35:10] translation of the Bride he says well he
[1:35:13] said well it's just a change of our
[1:35:14] bodies now he said you you you you know
[1:35:17] what I mean when I say that I I don't
[1:35:19] mean to be sacrilegious I don't mean to
[1:35:21] say ours I I I mean to say or I don't
[1:35:24] mean to say this church I I mean for to
[1:35:26] every believer Abraham was looking for a
[1:35:28] promised son that was promised him now
[1:35:31] y'all catch this and that's it's going
[1:35:32] to this quote will tie up everything
[1:35:33] else I hope that I've been saying and
[1:35:36] the church is looking for the promised
[1:35:37] son the bride is looking for the
[1:35:39] promised son before the promised son
[1:35:42] could come to Sarah and Abraham their
[1:35:44] bodies had to be changed is that right
[1:35:46] they she was too old to have a baby she
[1:35:48] had no milk veins in her breast her
[1:35:49] breast was dried up her womb was
[1:35:51] infertile she was sterile she couldn't
[1:35:53] have the the baby her heart was too old
[1:35:55] to stand labor so what happened God
[1:35:57] changed her back to an old to a young
[1:35:59] woman and he did Abraham the same way
[1:36:01] because his body was good as dead and he
[1:36:04] had to change their body in order to
[1:36:05] receive the promised son we cannot
[1:36:08] receive the promised son that's promised
[1:36:11] us today in these bodies that we live in
[1:36:16] these bodies are sin so potentially it's
[1:36:19] in here what is it the word promised
[1:36:22] before the foundation in the world all
[1:36:24] around there that's this only reflects
[1:36:26] the negative and and will it will that
[1:36:29] will reflect the positive the word the
[1:36:31] translation of the Bride will be the
[1:36:33] same thing the word that is in you the
[1:36:38] body will
[1:36:40] materialize around that
[1:36:46] word so once he unveils who you are now
[1:36:50] you've already been you're already the
[1:36:52] elect you didn't know who you are they
[1:36:54] didn't know who they are but once the
[1:36:57] once the the the the veil's been taken
[1:36:59] off the word hallelujah we found amen
[1:37:04] that's got boogers in it amen so the wor
[1:37:07] so once the
[1:37:11] veil you guys are making me preach
[1:37:18] hard I I I need someone to help come on
[1:37:22] up here
[1:37:35] once the
[1:37:40] word the word was bailed so when now
[1:37:44] when open the Bible now once the word
[1:37:47] the veil came off the word the veil came
[1:37:52] off the
[1:37:55] okay see she's always been the word so
[1:38:00] when the prophet's message came the
[1:38:02] shout was to declare he's on Earth he's
[1:38:07] on Earth and when it was when it was
[1:38:10] unveiled when the book was revealed it
[1:38:13] revealed the
[1:38:21] Beautiful married any
[1:38:25] so the only boyfriend you get is your
[1:38:27] daddy maybe so so this has now but but
[1:38:34] why I sit in a
[1:38:36] church with an open book yeah and not
[1:38:40] and not realize who you
[1:38:42] are we're not
[1:38:45] beg you are the book when the book was
[1:38:48] released you were read the Bible
[1:38:52] remember seal Daniel put put that up
[1:38:54] Daniel 12
[1:38:58] And1 praise the
[1:39:02] Lord at the time at that time Michael
[1:39:07] Michael shall stand up for thy people
[1:39:10] let's
[1:39:11] see well we need we need to go back and
[1:39:14] read the other okay so so first of all
[1:39:16] he told Daniel seal up the book seal it
[1:39:20] up okay but now he says time and he
[1:39:24] tells him he says you're going to go to
[1:39:25] the way of the Grave he

[1:43:53] there was amen one to an
[1:43:58] age and he's
[1:44:00] King now back in the other ages I must

[1:44:11] um uh Wigglesworth there there there
[1:44:14] there were plenty of those guys that
[1:44:15] raised up that had great gifts and and
[1:44:19] and and and were incredibly gifted men
[1:44:23] who could who could speak and raise the
[1:44:26] dead and and and that was all through
[1:44:28] that they were through those uh uh you
[1:44:30] know those those Church ages God would
[1:44:33] drop upon those men those those certain
[1:44:36] men and and they were very gifted I
[1:44:39] don't
[1:44:40] see I I just don't see that happening
[1:44:45] today I see a bride
[1:44:48] Ministry I see not someone coming and
[1:44:52] propping you you up or propping me up I
[1:44:55] see a a the bride standing up to her
[1:45:00] position and claiming her own
[1:45:07] victories because there's a faith not in
