that's the greatest need no matter what the need is we serve a god this morning who can meet that need amen that's true you know i heard brother david seiler say one time he said he was over in india

that he made with his own hands brother david said i thought i'm so glad [Music] that i don't worship the god that i made with my hands but i worship the god who made me with his hands [Music] the

you love him amen may the lord bless you i bring you greetings this morning from my church and my pastor brother donny reagan want to make sure to tell everyone hello and sure appreciate you and i want to thank brother wendell for the opportunity to come and realizing that you know there's some great great men of god preaching the gospel and yet he allowed someone like me to come and i appreciate that brother may the lord bless you richly thank you for the room that you give us to rest in and thank you for the food that you've provided for us and thank you sisters for all the labor that you've done and thank you for all the special songs and for the privilege of being here may the lord bless you richly this morning you know i'm certainly no great preacher if you come to hear somebody great you're really going to be disappointed but i do love the lord with all my heart and i trust he'll just speak to you this morning if you have your bibles turn with us to the book of john and [Music] last night brother jonathan done such a wonderful job all the brothers of oh my the words he's just been so rich this week and so brother jonathan jonathan was speaking last night on look and this was in my my heart and coming down this way looking along these lines and so we want to preach this morning the lord had just helped us that brother jonathan preached on look and so we want to kind of go this direction this morning john 1 starting at verse 32. hallelujah thank you father and the bible says this and john bear records saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it evoled upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on the same is he which baptized with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god amen let us bow our heads i want to speak to you this morning for just a few minutes on he told me what to look for heavenly father we love you lord thank you for all that you've done for us and father i just pray that you would take this simple thought lord break it to the hearts of your children oh god that our faith can rise up and receive that which you've already done for us lord bless your children today we'll be careful to give you the honor and the praise for we ask these things in jesus name and the bride says god bless you you'll be seated he told me what to look for you know god who is rich in mercy has always gave instructions to his people so that they would not error in the way that they should go you know paul told us in thessalonians he said but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others who have no hope paul said i don't want you to be dumb about this thing but i want you to understand who we serve i want you to understand that even though our loved ones may go by the way of the grave they are not dead and we do not weep as those who have no hope i do not want you to be ignorant now we find in luke chapter 2 that he sent angels to the shepherds who was watching over their flocks by night and the angel of the lord came unto them and and the glory of the lord shone around about them and they were afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling cloths lying in a manger and it came to pass as the angels were going away into the heavens that the shepherd said to one another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us now notice they didn't go to the king's palace they didn't go to a high dollar inn they didn't go to the ritz carlton they didn't go to some resort for the elite why why didn't they go there because they knew he wasn't there but the bible said with haste they found mary and joseph and the baby lying in a manger and i could just see mary said how did you find us how did you know we were here and the lady might have said to mary he the angel he told us what to look for you want to find jesus in your day look to where the angel messenger says that he's at we've had an angel messenger to tell us where he's at in the hour that we're living in that's where you will find him you'll not find him in a denomination you'll not find him in an organization you'll not find him in an educational program he's not there but you'll find him in the baptism of the holy ghost amen that's the only place you'll find him i was out in the back field the other day praying my burden for the young people seemed like so many of them were slipping out and i was praying to the lord and i felt like he spoke to me and so are we just getting them to shout out or are we getting them to christ and he said go ask them are you in the message or is the message in you because you see if you're just in this message somebody will talk you out of it but if the message is in you oh hell can't get it out of you that's what will keep our young people it's that life amen that's where he's at amen [Applause] don't look for him where he's not don't waste your time looking for him where he's not just look for him where he's at amen [Applause] he sent prophets with eagle vision who could raise up and they would be able to see the things that are to come and look and fall off they can begin to cry and he would give his people insight to things that are to be he would tell them what to look for i think of the mighty prophet isaiah who was caught up in the spirit and he began to cry out the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare you the way of the lord make straight in the desert highway for our god 712 years later the pharisees came from jerusalem into the desert asking john who are you they sent the priests and the levites from jerusalem said who are you and he confessed and he denied not but he said i am not the christ and they ask him who are you then art thou that elias she said no i am not i found that prophet he answered no they said unto him then who are you that we may give an answer to them that sent us what saith thou of thyself and he said ah and the voice of one crying in the wilderness makes straight the way of the lord as saith the prophet isaiah i am isaiah's prophecy fulfilled [Applause] this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears god told them what to look for he was the very vindication of isaiah's prophecy his teaching his nature his character they even came from jerusalem to the wilderness to see him the very words of the prophet was made flesh and was standing right before them he could stand there and say it's me isaiah was speaking of me how could they have missed it how could they have missed it when he told them what to look for but jesus said you hypocrites you blind leaders of the blind i sent you prophets i told you what to look for through those prophets and you stoned them oh jerusalem jerusalem thou that kill us the prophets and stone them with your sin unto thee how oft i would have gathered you under my wings but you would not i would have loved you i would have protected you i would have spread my skirt over you which you would god woe unto you scribes and pharisees stephen told them there in books acts chapter seven stephen said he sent you prophets to tell you what to look for before the just one come but what did you do you persecuted and you stoned them and now you have betrayed and killed the very one they said would come they were blinded by the creeds their self-righteousness the religion the pride i could just see on that day in jerusalem when the prophecy of zechariah was being fulfilled they might have been sitting around the table finishing their lunch and him i said honey let's get a scroll let's read from the scroll let's read from zechariah today and he pulls it out rejoice oh greatly oh daughter of zion shallow daughter of jerusalem behold that king cometh unto thee he has just been having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass upon the coat the fold of an ass and as they were reading the scroll they hear a noise and they look up over the scroll and they see him come riding into the city and no doubt he said to his wife who is this the bible said in matthew 21 when he was coming to jerusalem oh the city was moved saying who is this the city they might have not known they didn't know who it was even though it was the very word for their hour being manifested they did not know but they were son there oh glory to god who got the revelation why because zechariah told them what to look for [Applause] and when they saw zechariah's words made flesh they said it's him [Applause] the city of pauline may not know the city of tulsa may not know claremore may not know but there are some here this morning [Music] we know we know [Applause] the prophets prophecy has become flesh and by revelation what is revelation faith we can say this is jesus if you want to see jesus you've got to see him in the form he said he would appear in in the day you're living if someone come through that door dragging across bleeding people would scream men would faint and that wouldn't even be jesus i don't want to hurt your catholic feelings but that wouldn't be jesus he's already done that he'll never do it again they'll never nail him to a cross again he's already fulfilled that so if you're going to see christ in your day you've got to see the word for your hour made flesh when you find the word for your hour made flesh you have found jesus regardless of the skin color hallelujah regardless somebody [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the form doesn't matter you've got to see the life the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life [Music]
