[46:14] Abraham his servant and he brought forth
[46:17] his people with joy his chosen with
[46:20] gladness and gave them the lands of the
[46:23] Heathen and they inherited the LA of the
[46:26] people that they might observe his
[46:29] statutes and keep his laws and everyone
[46:32] say it together praise ye the Lord let's
[46:36] go to the Lord in prayer father we just
[46:39] want to thank you today for your
[46:41] blessings thank you Lord for all that
[46:43] you have done for us and I'm asking Lord
[46:47] that you would just be honored as we
[46:50] begin to think of of of your goodness
[46:53] and and what you have done for us Lord
[46:55] Lord I pray Lord that you would be in
[46:58] everything that we say that we would
[47:01] speak only as you would have us to speak
[47:03] Lord I pray Lord that you would be with
[47:06] all of your faithful folks here Lord who
[47:09] have been faithful to to come out and to
[47:12] give you glory and honor we love you
[47:15] Lord but we want your blessings upon
[47:17] this service lord it's nothing without
[47:20] you now Lord we just ask that you would
[47:23] have preeminence in Jesus name we pray
[47:25] pray can the church say amen and amen
[47:29] God bless you you may be seated here
[47:32] amen this morning um we um this may be
[47:37] just a little bit of a different service
[47:40] that as as far as um I think sometimes
[47:42] it's good to to to just look back on on
[47:46] how blessed we are as a people as a
[47:49] nation and um uh I I am I I think we
[47:54] should uh um that God raised this nation
[47:58] up uh for a specific purpose amen and so
[48:04] um uh we are as we look here amen uh our
[48:10] our nation I as we can look back at the
[48:13] founding of our nation God was behind
[48:16] this nation and and blessed this nation
[48:20] and our forefathers as as the um as as
[48:26] they fought and as we came for the
[48:29] principles of freedom and and and it is
[48:32] a lot like uh as we just read here amen
[48:36] um it's it's a lot like Israel Israel
[48:39] was brought out of out of Egypt they
[48:41] wanted a place of their own amen and and
[48:45] the supernatural was ever present as as
[48:49] God brought them out even all the way
[48:52] back to Abraham giving him a promise
[48:54] that he his out of his Lo would come uh
[48:59] amen the deliverer and there would be a
[49:03] uh a great nation that would be uh
[49:06] birthed and that there would be the
[49:09] nations of the earth that would be
[49:11] blessed because of Israel and and so
[49:16] amen and there was nothing that there
[49:18] was nothing that um uh Satan could do or
[49:22] or anyone else could do that would ever
[49:25] be able to destroy that Nation except
[49:29] amen the people themselves so Israel
[49:33] would be the only one that would that
[49:37] that could ever allow themselves to be
[49:40] taken in uh captivity and it would be
[49:44] when they started denying the word of
[49:46] God and and walking away from God then
[49:51] amen the blessings of God was no longer
[49:54] on them but the purpose of God was with
[49:58] Israel and the purpose of God Israel
[50:01] still has a Divine Purpose even today
[50:05] and so they as we just remember or or as
[50:09] we just read this scripture here and in
[50:12] Psalms 105 and 42 for he remembered his
[50:15] holy promise and Abraham his
[50:19] servant and he gave them the lands of
[50:22] the Heathen and they inherited the labor
[50:24] of the people
[50:26] that they might observe his statutes and
[50:30] keep his laws and then he said praise ye
[50:34] the Lord amen so so it is remember amen
[50:39] and he and he told him there in Exodus
[50:41] there in Exodus 13 and3 and if you want
[50:43] to put it up amen it just comes to my
[50:46] mind and Moses said unto the people
[50:48] remember this day in which you come out
[50:51] from Egypt out of the house of bondage
[50:53] for by the strength of hand the Lord
[50:57] brought you out from the place this
[50:59] place and there shall be no living bread
[51:02] uh be eaten so so it was a time that was
[51:05] to be told to their sons and and for
[51:07] Generation after generation because it
[51:10] was the blessing of the Lord that was
[51:14] upon the people amen now it would be it
[51:18] would be something that would be
[51:20] expressed for all of their Generations
[51:23] Thanksgiving to God for what God done to
[51:26] them God chose them and and established
[51:30] them a holy nation unto himself amen so
[51:35] when you would look there at Psalms 50
[51:37] and4 it would say offer unto God
[51:40] Thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the
[51:44] most high why are we giving thanks why
[51:47] are we paying our vows why should we pay
[51:50] our vows because it was God who chose us
[51:54] ordained us established us and our heart
[51:58] is to be a Heart of Thanksgiving and say
[52:01] God I owe you everything that I
[52:05] am I owe you everything I am can you say
[52:08] amen amen but he didn't stop there when
[52:11] he said Pay thou vows unto the most high
[52:14] and it says and call upon me in the day
[52:17] of trouble and I will deliver thee and
[52:22] thou shalt glorify me amen Psalms 98
[52:26] And1 oh sing unto the Lord a new song
[52:30] for he hath done marvelous things now
[52:32] remember remember he's chose you you are
[52:37] a peculiar people is that right amen
[52:40] before we go there let's just uh let's
[52:42] just run to uh 1 Peter 2 and 29 amen or
[52:46] 2 and N I'm sorry amen 1 Peter 2 and N I
[52:50] want you to understand where I'm going

[54:00] his righteousness hath he o openly
[54:02] showed in the sight of the Heathen he
[54:05] remembered his Mercy his truth toward
[54:07] the house of Israel all the ends of the
[54:10] Earth shall see the salvation of our God

[54:41] aside where our Pilgrim forefathers set
[54:44] that day aside to give thanks to the
[54:46] Lord for what he had done for for what
[54:48] we had and what he had done for us for
[54:52] blessing them giving them crops and so
[54:54] forth forth it was one real American day

[55:23] family together set down
[55:25] take God's word and read it tell your
[55:28] children about it tell them that this
[55:31] nation was built upon such as that our
[55:34] forefathers who fought to bring this
[55:36] freedom to us left the other country so
[55:39] that we could have freedom of worship
[55:41] freedom of speech freedom of press and
[55:44] so forth we're thankful yet for it we
[55:48] don't know how long that it'll be that
[55:50] way but I say long may our lands be
[55:53] bright with Freedom's whole Holy Light

[56:24] can still get up and preach our
[56:26] convictions amen without having to hide
[56:29] somewhere we ought to be thankful that
[56:31] we can still meet in a building like
[56:33] this and a beautiful building that God
[56:34] has blessed us with amen instead of a a
[56:37] dingy dungeon somewhere amen where we're
[56:39] having to hide from the government
[56:41] brother I I want to say it's the
[56:43] blessings of God that is upon this

[56:50] upon you children that you all are able
[56:52] to come here learn to play and sing and
[56:55] preach and amen learn to learn to do
[56:57] these kinds of things it's not always
[57:00] been the case matters of fact our
[57:02] forefathers when they come to America
[57:06] they came because they were under
[57:09] persecution they were under amen
[57:11] persecution they didn't have the freedom
[57:12] of religion amen they they were they
[57:15] were they were uh the the land the
[57:17] government was putting their thumb upon
[57:19] the people and they had to believe a
[57:21] certain way they had to they had to take
[57:23] orders and could only preach certain way
[57:25] but God always gives a light God always
[57:29] gives a help why because God's got a
[57:32] people that'll never be defeated amen
[57:35] and God brought them over to this land
[57:38] and God
[57:40] supernaturally blessed them here in
[57:44] America amen that's exactly right the
[57:47] Puritans and the separatist they they
[57:50] wanted to express themselves to God Amen
[57:52] their Liberties had been taken away and
[57:54] they had become so taxed John Wesley's
[57:57] Revival fires had amen was was dying out
[58:01] and and sin was creeping in the church
[58:04] and the National Church of England had
[58:06] had silenced all others amen they had
[58:10] rejected the move of God and now they
[58:12] had come to a place to where amen they
[58:15] were they they they they they were
[58:18] trying to silence everything amen and
[58:20] the National Church had taken over amen
[58:23] and so uh uh uh they they had originally
[58:27] left to Holland went to Holland and amen
[58:30] this is our forefathers now this is how
[58:32] this is how we coming about here in
[58:34] America amen but they found so much uh
[58:37] immorality and in the schools and the
[58:40] government and even the churches there
[58:43] was there was just so much sin and
[58:45] perversions and the pilgrims wanted a
[58:48] place that they could raise their
[58:51] children in Freedom right
[58:55] now kids you might not understand the
[58:56] freedoms that we have you you might not
[59:00] understand how blessed you are amen did
[59:03] you realize that that that uh being
[59:06] homeschooled is a blessing do you
[59:09] realize that there are people that want
[59:13] to take the freedom of being
[59:15] homeschooled away to make you go to a to
[59:19] a government educated Place Hallelujah
[59:23] you know why because they don't have
[59:25] their hands on

[59:53] mind
[59:55] right
[59:56] amen amen do you realize that in China
[1:00:00] that you can't preach like this in
[1:00:03] China you've got to preach what the
[1:00:06] government tells you to
[1:00:07] preach amen and their Bible is not our
[1:00:11] Bible oh they'll let you have a Bible
[1:00:14] amen but where it says to worship God it
[1:00:17] is it is saying to something to the

[1:09:00] sometimes that anything that doesn't
[1:09:03] cost you something isn't worth

[1:09:09] for now are y'all hearing me you kids
[1:09:11] hearing for us to have this Freedom
[1:09:14] today is because there's been people who

[1:09:24] Thanksgiving Day this cost the blood of
[1:09:26] many American millions of them it's
[1:09:29] worth something and if it's worth
[1:09:32] something it's worth dying for and this

[1:09:40] us bring bring back to us a resurrected
[1:09:44] Lord Jesus Christ alive after 1900 years

[1:09:51] efforts and everything that we do it's
[1:09:54] worth All To Us thou the stream of all
[1:09:57] thy Comforts said Fanny Crosby more than

[1:10:03] thee and whom in heaven but thee pass me

[1:12:36] because God needed a
[1:12:40] nation because there was going to be a
[1:12:43] bride in this end time and there was
[1:12:46] going to be a message and the messenger
[1:12:49] in this end time and there had to be a
[1:12:53] free country that would spread the
[1:12:55] gospel around the
[1:12:57] world aren't you glad for America sir
[1:13:02] man
[1:13:04] now I think it's wonderful now that was
[1:13:07] our first Thanksgiving and next am man
[1:13:10] if you were to go on down now you think
[1:13:14] of this how the supernatural was with
[1:13:17] our fora such as Washington amen when
[1:13:21] when half of the army that he had you
[1:13:25] know they they didn't have they they
[1:13:27] didn't have a lot of Weaponry am man
[1:13:30] when England was coming back after them
[1:13:32] amen they were coming in they wanted to
[1:13:34] come back they wanted to take these
[1:13:36] people back home take them back to
[1:13:37] England amen and so they uh uh it was
[1:13:43] they were wanting to uh declare their
[1:13:46] independence and and when they when they
[1:13:48] had done it amen they were ill equipped
[1:13:51] they didn't have the right kind of armor
[1:13:53] didn't have the right kind of clothes
[1:13:55] they didn't they didn't they didn't have
[1:13:57] hardly any kind of Weaponry at all amen
[1:14:00] and history tells us that at one point
[1:14:03] amen half the Army uh Washington's Army
[1:14:06] was barefooted and just wrapping them up
[1:14:08] in in in in in uh a racks amen as
[1:14:12] they're marching across the Delaware
[1:14:15] amen the supplies were gone the enemy
[1:14:18] was coming in and and and and shooting
[1:14:22] and did you know that that history tells
[1:14:24] us that that Washington was a praying
[1:14:27] man and that Washington would pray and
[1:14:29] that that one night he prayed all night
[1:14:31] long and just asking God for his great
[1:14:34] Powers amen that he that he stood for a
[1:14:37] worthy cause and and amen they say that
[1:14:43] that that the enemy had come in and
[1:14:44] there were several hoes and and there
[1:14:46] were were soldiers that had witnessed
[1:14:49] amen bullets hitting him and and and
[1:14:52] even holes in his coat but yet it didn't
[1:14:55] penetrate his body that God was fighting
[1:14:59] God was preserving Washington Hallelujah
[1:15:03] now come on folks this ain't this ain't
[1:15:05] this ain't fictional
[1:15:07] stuff amen I know people want to say the
[1:15:10] pillar of fire is a fictional thing it's
[1:15:12] not a fictional thing and neither was
[1:15:13] the founding of our nation a fictional
[1:15:15] thing it was God preserving this for
[1:15:18] this great
[1:15:20] time Hallelujah because there had to a
[1:15:23] lamb amen there had to rise that Beast
[1:15:27] up with the with the civil and
[1:15:29] ecclesiastical horns there had to be
[1:15:33] America now we know that that lamb will
[1:15:36] rise up and start speaking like the
[1:15:37] Beast and we know like the dragon and we
[1:15:39] know we are
[1:15:42] here but I'm here to tell you we rose up
[1:15:44] on the power of that of that Beast that
[1:15:46] came up amen out of the ground God done
[1:15:50] that for
[1:15:52] you can you sayen now the composers or
[1:15:57] The
[1:15:57] Architects of of our constitutions the
[1:16:00] designers of our
[1:16:02] constitution amen had a picture in mind
[1:16:05] and and so this picture amen that they
[1:16:08] had in mind was a land of Freedom it was
[1:16:11] it was a land that would be free from
[1:16:13] tax oppression it would be a land that
[1:16:16] would be free from religious oppression
[1:16:19] amen they envisioned the empowerment of
[1:16:21] the family and under the directive of
[1:16:24] God and to live to the fullest of
[1:16:28] god-given
[1:16:29] dreams and to be able to express all of
[1:16:32] the potentials that each uh member of
[1:16:35] the family amen came with amen that's
[1:16:39] that was that was their design now now I
[1:16:42] I I want you to really think about this
[1:16:44] here this morning because a lot of
[1:16:45] people try to take away uh uh a lot lot
[1:16:49] lot of people try to tr try to separate
[1:16:51] us uh you know religion from uh uh uh
[1:16:55] you know the government and try to say
[1:16:57] you know but but I want to tell you the
[1:16:59] the the the Constitution was written by
[1:17:02] Christian people for
[1:17:04] us it wasn't it wasn't written it wasn't
[1:17:07] written for the for the Sinners out
[1:17:08] there it was written now you can serve
[1:17:10] God however you wanted to but they were
[1:17:12] not there amen they were not giving you
[1:17:14] freedom to kill babies they were not
[1:17:16] giving you freedom to be transgender
[1:17:18] they were not giving you freedoms for
[1:17:20] those kinds of things those are sin they
[1:17:22] were not giving you freed fre to sin
[1:17:24] they were given you freedoms to worship
[1:17:26] God according to the own your own
[1:17:28] dictates of your own
[1:17:30] heart in other words you don't have to
[1:17:32] believe like I believe and I don't have
[1:17:33] to believe like you believe we've got we
[1:17:36] had a freedom of
[1:17:39] religion purist and the separatist were
[1:17:42] a little were different uh the Quakers
[1:17:44] you know they they they they were all
[1:17:46] but the thing is they all come with one
[1:17:52] agreement praise the Lord so we just let
[1:17:55] let all the denominations say serve God
[1:17:57] however you want to serve him we
[1:17:59] Hallelujah but let me serve God how I
[1:18:01] want to serve
[1:18:04] him is that
[1:18:06] right
[1:18:07] amen once
[1:18:09] again sin wants to come in and these
[1:18:14] that want to pursue sin and make you
[1:18:20] agree with their position with
[1:18:24] transgenders make you agree with their
[1:18:26] position of abortion
[1:18:30] I Hallelujah all of you belong in
[1:18:34] jail amen the Constitution was not set
[1:18:39] up for you to hide behind so that you
[1:18:42] can butcher children before they come in
[1:18:46] to an age of
[1:18:49] puberty the Constitution was not set up
[1:18:52] for that it was set up for
[1:18:55] Religious
[1:18:57] Freedom well glory to God Amen
[1:19:02] now so amen we got to understand that
[1:19:06] now you know what were they thinking why
[1:19:08] why were why was this done what were
[1:19:10] they opposing what were they fighting
[1:19:12] for amen I think an American needs to
[1:19:17] identify with the dream that was in
[1:19:20] those guys' hearts and Minds at the
[1:19:22] beginning
[1:19:25] amen so I started thinking you know I I
[1:19:29] I just I just want to give you a few
[1:19:31] proclamations how many believe that'll
[1:19:33] be all right I told you it's going to be
[1:19:35] a weird service amen but the first
[1:19:38] national Thanksgiving Proclamation uh uh
[1:19:42] the N the first national proclamation of
[1:19:44] Thanksgiving was in 197 or in
[1:19:48] 1777 uh given by the Continental uh
[1:19:51] Congress and it was h a temporary
[1:19:54] location of York of Pennsylvania amen
[1:19:57] because the British occupied the
[1:19:58] national capital in
[1:20:00] Philadelphia and so Samuel Adams created
[1:20:04] the first draft of the Proclamation and
[1:20:06] this is the way it read for as much as
[1:20:10] it is the in indispensable duty of all
[1:20:13] men to adore these super intending
[1:20:18] Providence of almighty God to
[1:20:21] acknowledge gratitude their obligation
[1:20:25] to him for benefits received and to
[1:20:28] implore such further blessings as they
[1:20:31] stand in need of and it having pleased

[1:41:21] ifying of the body of Christ until we do
[1:41:24] come into the unity of the
[1:41:28] faith but I'm not pointing you to me and
[1:41:30] neither is any of these preachers
[1:41:31] pointing you to we're pointing you to
[1:41:36] Christ he's the
[1:41:38] unifier he's the one when you get man
[1:41:41] all involved then
[1:41:43] amen then we got we got everything that
[1:41:46] we've got today but God's got Believers
[1:41:49] God's got Believers all over this world
[1:41:51] they ain't the one that's made the rules
[1:41:53] and made the all these uh dogmas and
[1:41:56] Creeds well come on all they want to do
[1:41:58] is just love
[1:41:59] God right praise the Lord and I'm
[1:42:03] thankful for this I'm thankful for this
[1:42:05] freedom to worship God here this
[1:42:08] morning I I'm thankful I I'm thankful
[1:42:13] Hallelujah I'll fight I I I'll fight for
[1:42:15] anyone's freedom to worship God I don't
[1:42:17] care whether you're a Baptist I don't
[1:42:18] care whether you're a Pentecostal I
[1:42:20] don't care whether you're Methodist amen
[1:42:23] I I I I I'm thankful for Freedom that we
[1:42:25] can all worship
[1:42:27] God are are y'all understanding but
[1:42:31] here's the here's the
[1:42:32] kicker when you've heard the shepherd's
[1:42:35] voice when you've heard the seventh
[1:42:38] Angel's message when you've heard saying
[1:42:41] come out of her my people and be ye
[1:42:46] separate then that is something that is
[1:42:48] calling you even out of the religious
[1:42:51] system to himself and saying I've called
[1:42:54] some for the first resurrection and some
[1:42:56] for the second
[1:42:59] Resurrection I I I I want to take the
[1:43:01] blood of Jesus Christ I want to take
[1:43:03] God's word because I want to tell you
[1:43:05] amen he he he's given you these freedoms
[1:43:09] today he has sent you a messenger in
[1:43:11] this day not for us to take what we want
[1:43:14] and discard what we want it's for us to
[1:43:16] follow the pillar of
[1:43:18] fire according to the dictates of our
[1:43:21] hearts and sometimes it's going to take
[1:43:23] me a totally different direction than
[1:43:25] what it might be taking that
[1:43:26] denomination next door but that's okay
[1:43:28] follow God according to the dictate of
[1:43:30] your heart but God's placed a
[1:43:32] predestinated seat on me that is saying
[1:43:34] I must
[1:43:37] follow well praise the
[1:43:40] Lord I'm thankful for that
[1:43:44] freedom I'm
[1:43:46] thankful I'm thankful that we can
[1:43:49] come and love God
[1:43:53] god brother Brenham would say before
[1:43:56] right before he passed
[1:43:59] away he
[1:44:05] said he said the scriptures that I would
[1:44:08] like to follow up closely behind if the
[1:44:09] Lord willing to the Thanksgiving
[1:44:13] message to the
[1:44:15] invisible
[1:44:17] Union of the bride of
[1:44:19] Christ
[1:44:21] the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:44:22] Christ doesn't sound like a Thanksgiving
[1:44:25] message though any Scripture we're
[1:44:27] thankful for all of
[1:44:28] it I'm thankful to
[1:44:31] God to be living in this time of the
[1:44:35] closing scenes of the world's
[1:44:37] history I don't
[1:44:40] know if I would have had to say so
[1:44:43] before the foundation of the
[1:44:44] world and God would have laid out the
[1:44:47] whole program to me and said I want you
[1:44:50] to pre
[1:44:51] preach what age do you
[1:44:54] desire to go to the Earth to
[1:44:59] preach he says I would have chose this
[1:45:02] age for I think this is the Golden
[1:45:06] Age I certainly would have loved to have
[1:45:09] been here during the time of his visit
[1:45:11] to Earth but still I think this right
[1:45:15] now is a greater
[1:45:19] time stay with me here I'm fixing the
[1:45:22] close this is a greater
[1:45:27] time because it's a time that he's
[1:45:29] coming to take the people that he's
[1:45:31] redeemed nearing the resurrection when
[1:45:33] all the redeem will come forth what a
[1:45:36] glorious opportunity we have to speak to
[1:45:38] a dying people what a great time we are
[1:45:41] enthused about it we know that history
[1:45:44] is closing out the world's history will
[1:45:46] soon be over and then we're going to
[1:45:48] step into a new day to the great
[1:45:52] Millennium I believe as a Believer I
[1:45:55] believe in a
[1:45:56] millennium a millennial reign with
[1:45:58] Christ A Thousand Years upon the Earth
[1:46:00] the physical Return of the Lord Jesus to
[1:46:02] take a physical people glorified by his
[1:46:06] cleansing
