[44:33] that he rose from the dead how say some
[44:37] among you that there is no resurrection
[44:40] of the
[44:41] dead but if there be no resurrection of
[44:44] the dead then is Christ not risen if
[44:48] Christ is not be not risen then our
[44:51] preaching uh then is our preaching Vain
[44:55] and your faith is also vain
[44:58] yay we are found false Witnesses of God
[45:01] because we have testified of God that he
[45:03] raised up
[45:05] Christ whom he raised not up if so be
[45:08] that the dead rise not for if the dead
[45:12] rise not then is not Christ raised if
[45:15] Christ be not raised your faith is vain
[45:18] Ye Ye are yet in your sins then they
[45:22] also which are fallen asleep in Christ
[45:24] are perished if in this life only we
[45:28] have hope in Christ we are of all men
[45:31] most miserable but now is Christ risen
[45:34] from the dead and become the first
[45:37] fruits of them that slept for Since By
[45:40] Man Came Death by man also come the
[45:43] resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam
[45:47] all die even so in Christ shall all be
[45:52] made alive aren't you glad for that

[46:36] anointing would be not just upon me as
[46:39] the minister Lord though I I I truly ask

[47:13] Jesus Christ can the church say amen
[47:16] amen and amen God bless you you can be
[47:19] seated here this
[47:22] morning
[47:23] amen if Christ be not risen
[47:28] from the dead then we of all
[47:32] men are most miserable in in fact he
[47:37] says if we have hope in this life only
[47:41] this fleshly life then we are uh of all
[47:46] men most miserable we are we hold
[47:51] something within our souls that that
[47:54] gave us a hope that we did not have amen
[47:59] uh in in our natural lives amen and so
[48:04] we we understand your first life is the
[48:07] natural life as the Apostle Paul would
[48:10] go on in there in uh further on down in
[48:14] the 46th verse he says now he says how
[48:17] be it that was not first which is
[48:20] spiritual but that which is natural and
[48:23] then after that which is spiritual so
[48:26] there are two births amen and we we we
[48:30] understand as we have borne the image of
[48:32] this Earthly then we shall also bore the
[48:35] image bear the image of the Heavenly
[48:39] amen so you cannot allow the fleshly to
[48:43] identify the spiritual and you can't I
[48:46] use the spiritual Amen to uh identify
[48:51] the natural they will never be the same
[48:54] you are a spiritual being
[48:57] you are the seed of God the anointed one
[49:01] you are the very amen offspring of God
[49:06] living in a in a body of a natural body
[49:11] of Decay amen and so we we look here and
[49:17] and the Apostle Paul is just making it
[49:19] very clear amen if there's not a
[49:22] resurrection if there is not a doing
[49:25] away with the old old and putting on of
[49:28] the new then we are of all men most
[49:30] miserable if we only have hope of Christ
[49:35] amen just coming to church while we're
[49:37] here if if if all it is is church and
[49:40] all it is is is this life and the
[49:43] Christian Life here on this Earth in
[49:46] this natural world then we are all
[49:50] miserable because there's a lot of
[49:52] Trials there's a lot of circumstances
[49:54] there's a lot of things there amen each
[49:57] of you go through but we have an eternal
[50:01] hope because of the resurrection of
[50:04] Jesus Christ and because he raised from
[50:08] the dead so shall every one of God's
[50:11] children raised from the dead can you
[50:14] say Amen aren't you glad for a direct
[50:17] word from the Lord in this hour that
[50:18] we're living in a direct word not no
[50:21] longer a amen it's not a question a
[50:25] direct word it's a POS positive word

[50:47] positively amen identified here this
[50:51] morning with the spirit of life in
[50:55] Christ Jesus the life that was in Christ
[50:59] raised him from the dead and the life
[51:02] that is in your mortal being will raise
[51:05] you from the dead there is no other
[51:09] there there is no other alternative

[53:25] mirror and say within that body is the

[53:31] Christ amen you were eternally in
[53:35] elohim's thoughts amen there's a certain
[53:39] quality to the elect it's an eternal
[53:41] quality it's something that amen no one
[53:44] else can experience amen you in this
[53:46] outward man there perishing this outward
[53:49] man is dying this outward Man is full of
[53:53] genetics amen and flaws but the inward
[53:56] word man is renewed day by day in the
[53:59] Holy Ghost amen so as a as a human amen
[54:04] you were never uh uh a cow before you
[54:08] were never a dog before you were never a
[54:10] pig before you've always been amen

[54:23] gotten spanking when we've been older
[54:25] amen Maybe by law Maybe by this or that
[54:28] amen but that didn't change the fact
[54:30] that you are human there's never a
[54:32] question in your mind whether you're a
[54:33] human you are strictly a human the the
[54:36] genetics cannot cannot crossbreed you
[54:39] cannot be part dog and and part monkey

[55:17] a question that heaven is yours amen
[55:20] well praise the Lord I I you you you you
[55:22] might be hearing something else from the
[55:24] message amen but every time I hear the
[55:26] message message I hear that I'm a son
[55:28] every time I hear the message amen it's
[55:30] a certain sound every time I hear the
[55:32] message it is saying come out of my her
[55:35] my people that you receive not of her
[55:37] plagues you are my son amen if we could
[55:41] ever start acting like we're Sons acting
[55:43] like we're daughters acting like we we
[55:45] are the children of God Amen there is no
[55:47] question to it we are who God says we
[55:51] are well praise the Lord amen the
[55:54] scripture says if the S if the if the
[55:55] Trump it gives an uncertain sound amen
[55:59] then who can prepare himself for battle
[56:01] amen I I I I if it's saying one thing
[56:04] but yet it's not clear amen then then
[56:07] then you're never going to amen as the
[56:09] in the old days when the trumpets
[56:11] sounded it had to be sounded strong it
[56:14] had to be exactly the way amen the war
[56:17] trumpet was to sound so that others
[56:19] could prepare themselves for battle amen
[56:22] but today we got too many sounds we got
[56:24] this trumpet and this trumpet and that
[56:26] sound and this trumpet and the people
[56:28] don't know how to fight they don't know
[56:30] how to how to believe they don't know is
[56:32] because the Devils there's all kinds of
[56:34] Winds of doctrines and there's all kinds
[56:36] of things to try to amen until you're
[56:39] confused but God is not the author of
[56:41] confusion God is not the author that
[56:43] says amen yes I love you amen but I
[56:46] don't know if I love you anymore I
[56:48] started off and you started off amen but
[56:51] hey I'm taking my hands off if God ever
[56:53] loved you he will always love you if God
[56:56] ever called you that call is still the
[56:58] same if God's anointed you then his
[57:01] anointing is there to bring you to your
[57:04] completion can you say Amen 2
[57:07] Corinthians 1:12 for all somebody say
[57:10] all all the promises of God in him are
[57:14] yay and in him amen unto the glory of
[57:20] God Amen now the Bible says let your
[57:24] yays let your yay
[57:26] B let your Nay be nay amen I'm talking
[57:31] about a positive gospel I'm talking
[57:33] about something that should never well
[57:36] glory to God I I want to tell you
[57:39] question marks amen should should should
[57:42] should be erased amen take the question
[57:44] mark and put a quotation mark Hallelujah
[57:48] a quotation mark who quotation his
[57:51] quotation amen for you now God commands
[57:55] us he He commands us to come out of
[57:57] Babylon now what is Babylon he says come
[57:59] out of her my people what what is
[58:02] Babylon what does Babylon represent amen
[58:05] it was at the Tower of Babel where the
[58:08] where the languages were confused amen
[58:12] until no one could understand the other
[58:14] and it was all just a bunch of mumble
[58:17] jumble it was all just a bunch of
[58:19] confusion amen and that's what that's
[58:22] what Babylon is today amen it's this
[58:24] opinion and it's that opinion and it's
[58:26] this opinion well praise the Lord amen
[58:28] but God don't want your opinion God
[58:30] don't want my opinion God wants his
[58:33] opinion and God sent a seventh angel
[58:36] messenger our way Amen to validate your
[58:40] soul by his
[58:42] word well someone shout
[58:45] hallelujah amen now amen many times we
[58:50] we I I want to I want to deal with this
[58:53] positive identification
[58:56] because we look amen that we we are two
[59:00] people amen we are you you live in a
[59:04] body of
[59:06] mortality yet within you is is the the
[59:10] the holy spirit of God Amen many times
[59:15] Satan will try to tell you that you
[59:17] don't you you you know you you you can't
[59:19] pray because of this or you can't
[59:21] believe because of this and amen but
[59:24] listen I just want to say this morning
[59:26] amen we've got way tooo many that put
[59:29] their their emphasis on the Flesh and
[59:32] this Mortal life Amen brother there
[59:34] should be zero confidence in the
[59:37] flesh zero confidence in the flesh well
[59:40] someone say zero confidence in the flesh
[59:44] 1 Peter 1 and 24 says All Flesh amen is
[59:48] is as grass and all the glory of man as
[59:53] the flower of grass the grass grass
[59:56] withereth and the flower thereof falleth
[59:59] away amen but when God sends a
[1:00:02] Vindicated voice it's not just another
[1:00:06] opinion when God sent that Prophet amen
[1:00:10] it was the revealing of the son of man
[1:00:12] or it was the it was the Enlightenment
[1:00:15] it was the thoughts of God coming to the
[1:00:18] elect in the midst of a day where there
[1:00:22] would be so many voices amen listen the
[1:00:26] voice of God come through that Prophet
[1:00:29] Amen to Squatch to to to silence all of
[1:00:34] the other voices that are out there
[1:00:36] screaming in your head that are
[1:00:39] screaming on your phone amen and that
[1:00:41] that voice is you are a son and daughter
[1:00:47] of
[1:00:48] God Amen even in his rebukes even in in
[1:00:52] the rebukes of Malachi 4 amen what is he
[1:00:55] doing he is saying get away from her
[1:00:57] come out of her quit putting your
[1:00:59] confidence in the flesh amen put your
[1:01:02] confidence in the
[1:01:05] word amen that's right how did he how
[1:01:09] does God declare it how does God
[1:01:11] separate One Voice from another he
[1:01:13] separates the voices by vindicating his
[1:01:16] own hallelujah amen you got all of us
[1:01:20] sitting here on the front row every one
[1:01:21] of you's got opinions amen but you see
[1:01:24] if one can come amen and and and and and
[1:01:28] and if you can claim that you have the
[1:01:30] voice of the Lord but when God comes
[1:01:32] upon one of y'all to validate what
[1:01:35] you're saying and declare that I am with
[1:01:38] that person then it silences everything
[1:01:41] else because the Vindication is upon
[1:01:44] that one and so what it is today in the
[1:01:47] midst of all of the voice and all of the
[1:01:50] talk there was a pillar of fire that
[1:01:53] came down to one voice and say I am with
[1:01:57] this
[1:01:58] one I am with this one now many look at
[1:02:02] the body but they don't recognize that
[1:02:06] it was God that raised that body living
[1:02:09] in that body speaking through that body
[1:02:12] to the elect to make sure that she was
[1:02:15] stabilized with the promises of God well
[1:02:18] aren't you glad you're stabilize with
[1:02:20] the promises of God Amen that's right
[1:02:23] and so God backs it up so what what was
[1:02:26] and and and before I get into my
[1:02:28] thoughts here what was the last sign to
[1:02:31] the Gentiles the last sign was the
[1:02:34] revealing of the son of man amen the
[1:02:37] revealing of the son of man was to be
[1:02:38] the last sign now there's going to be
[1:02:40] many signs there was a you know the moon
[1:02:42] turned to blood there's going to be uh
[1:02:44] uh you know the earthquakes and diverse
[1:02:47] places there's going to be tsunamis
[1:02:48] there's going to be amen all of these
[1:02:50] things but to the elect there's only one
[1:02:53] sign it's the sign of the son of man
[1:02:57] it's the same sign that came down to to
[1:03:00] Abraham before Sodom was burnt there was
[1:03:04] one sign it was the voice of the son of
[1:03:07] man that came and enabled the the the uh
[1:03:12] the the the the body or the womb of
[1:03:15] Abraham and Sarah for a body change the
[1:03:18] next thing after amen the visitation of
[1:03:21] Elohim in flesh was amen the body change
[1:03:25] and I I want to say today we're not
[1:03:27] waiting for anything else we're waiting
[1:03:31] for the body change we're not waiting
[1:03:33] for a Revival we're not waiting for amen
[1:03:36] a a a great move of speaking in tongues
[1:03:40] and seeing visions we're not waiting for
[1:03:42] a a great big move of Amen of of good
[1:03:45] emotions we are waiting for one last
[1:03:49] thing and that's the body change amen we
[1:03:52] have received our final sign and that
[1:03:55] was that positive word of Malachi
[1:04:00] for well I think we ought to get
[1:04:02] rejoicing around that that positive word
[1:04:05] of Malachi 4 we need to Rally around
[1:04:07] that voice like we've never rallied
[1:04:09] behind because the Rapture is
[1:04:13] on hallelujah what can you say Amen
[1:04:16] there's signs of tribulation there's
[1:04:18] signs of the sodomites there's signs of
[1:04:20] the world falling apart but we've
[1:04:22] already received our sign we're not look
[1:04:24] we those signs mean nothing to us we
[1:04:26] have done heard the sign of the voice of
[1:04:29] the son of
[1:04:32] manen can you say Amen there's only one
[1:04:35] sign that was given to the elect only
[1:04:36] one sign given it was the voice of
[1:04:40] Elohim that came he out what y y' y'all
[1:04:44] remember y don't y'all remember Sarah
[1:04:46] Hallelujah y'all remember Sarah Sarah
[1:04:48] thought that it was impossible Sarah
[1:04:50] says amen I there's no way I can produce
[1:04:54] Sarah's the one that was saying you've
[1:04:56] got to take Hagar there's got to be
[1:04:58] somebody else but me I can't do this but
[1:05:01] Elohim appeared not to Hagar Elohim
[1:05:05] appeared to Sarah and said you're
[1:05:08] doubting Sarah you're laughing Sarah but
[1:05:12] my promise is with
[1:05:17] you well glory to God you see on the
[1:05:20] inside of that Barren womb laid a
[1:05:24] promise on the inside of that Barren old
[1:05:28] lady laid a promise you shall have a son
[1:05:35] amen and laying within you the Bride of
[1:05:38] Jesus Christ amen is a promise that you
[1:05:41] are going to give birth to the word it's
[1:05:44] a word body it's a perfect word amen
[1:05:48] word life oh can you say Amen living
[1:05:51] within your womb Sarah was judging the
[1:05:55] Promise by what she felt by what she
[1:05:59] seen by what she well can you say Amen
[1:06:02] she was judging The Promise by her own
[1:06:06] ability and yet God was came when God
[1:06:10] came he turned her from looking at her
[1:06:15] flesh looking at her
[1:06:18] inabilities and turned her mind toward
[1:06:22] the promise of God you shall have that
[1:06:28] son
[1:06:30] amen
[1:06:32] amen so for Sarah if it was hope in that
[1:06:36] body only she was miserable but when the
[1:06:40] son of man came his desire was not to
[1:06:44] make a message believer his desire was
[1:06:47] to take the words that God had already
[1:06:51] spoke 25 years earlier and make those
[1:06:54] words real
[1:06:56] in her
[1:06:58] womb ah can you say amen hallelujah amen
[1:07:03] now she was just as much
[1:07:05] apart you see the words the words the
[1:07:10] mind of God was being expressed that day
[1:07:13] to Sarah and Abraham revealing her heart
[1:07:17] revealing God's heart it was God's mind
[1:07:20] being revealed and also he was also
[1:07:22] letting her know I know your mind as

[1:07:30] but I want to tell you within you are
[1:07:34] the words of life and they shall come to
[1:07:37] pass amen if we could believe the words
[1:07:39] of God today friends don't go quit
[1:07:41] looking in the mirror quit looking at
[1:07:43] yourself and quit looking at everyone
[1:07:44] else and start looking at the words of
[1:07:46] life that God has planted within you
[1:07:48] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:07:51] the son of man has come to reveal God's
[1:07:54] mind to you
[1:07:56] and to expose the doubt of your heart
[1:07:58] cleanse yourself you double-minded and
[1:08:01] walk with God can you say
[1:08:04] amen amen well glory to God I love
[1:08:08] second uh Corinthians 4 and amen and and

[1:08:17] treasure and then there's the Earth and
[1:08:20] vessels treasure is not the Earth and
[1:08:23] vessels the Earth and vessel is is not
[1:08:25] the treasure and you've got to keep them
[1:08:27] both separate amen because if you're not
[1:08:30] getting them if if you don't keep them
[1:08:31] separate then then then then you'll be
[1:08:33] amen miserable we have this treasure in
[1:08:36] Earth and vessels that the Excellency of
[1:08:39] the power may be of God and not of us we
[1:08:45] are troubled on every side yet not
[1:08:48] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:08:51] despair we are persecuted but not
[1:08:54] forsaken cast down but not destroyed
[1:08:57] always wearing about him the body the
[1:09:00] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[1:09:03] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:09:07] our body hallelujah what can you say
[1:09:10] Amen so God allows Sarah's womb to be to
[1:09:14] to be buried God allows these things to
[1:09:17] come God's not going to give any glory
[1:09:19] to your flesh he's not going to give any

[1:09:49] a positive word for you can you say amen
[1:09:54] amen if we in this life only have hope
[1:09:59] then we would be all men most miserable

[1:10:04] man oh Wretched Man that I am who shall
[1:10:07] deliver me from the body of this death
[1:10:11] this body is reigning with death so the
[1:10:14] Apostle Paul is sharing that within him

[1:12:35] diseases the you know what brother
[1:12:37] Brandon called it he said it's a past
[1:12:38] house amen he said that old past house
[1:12:41] you're living in amen that that past
[1:12:43] house it another word for it you know it
[1:12:45] was used back in the late 1800s and
[1:12:47] early 1900s those pest houses they were
[1:12:50] also called plague houses amen disease
[1:12:52] houses and and and and so when they when
[1:12:55] they had that uh yonic plague that that
[1:12:58] that that broke out amen they they they
[1:13:01] would take the these diseased people I
[1:13:03] mean they were dying just it was it was
[1:13:07] it was uh uh aund times worse than
[1:13:10] anything we've ever seen even with the
[1:13:12] last that that that pandemic that was
[1:13:14] anyway
[1:13:16] so but but this this thing here was
[1:13:19] people were dying amen they they were
[1:13:22] they didn't have enough Graves for all
[1:13:24] of the people amen so what they were
[1:13:26] doing they would take the all of the
[1:13:28] disease and they would put them over in
[1:13:30] this pest house Hallelujah put him in
[1:13:33] this pest house amen and and and and and
[1:13:37] they say they amen they were it was it
[1:13:41] you know people want to say they were
[1:13:42] like hospitals today amen but they said
[1:13:45] oh you can't classify them as hospitals
[1:13:47] they were put in there to die they were
[1:13:49] separated from the people amen and that
[1:13:52] they could die their miserable death
[1:13:54] alone so that so and kept him from the
[1:13:58] community trying to purge amen trying to
[1:14:01] purge the the disease the the deadly
[1:14:04] disease from the public amen they would
[1:14:07] die in those places amen separated from
[1:14:10] their family separated from from all and
[1:14:13] that's and that's what the brother
[1:14:15] brandom is saying you're living in a
[1:14:18] pest house your soul has has found its
[1:14:21] way Amen in this old diseased house
[1:14:25] but yet it's been bornn again there
[1:14:28] there's something that is saying I don't
[1:14:31] belong in this
[1:14:32] thing the old best house is for is for
[1:14:36] the diseased Soul amen full of sin but
[1:14:40] I'm not that person I'm a Son of God I'm
[1:14:44] a daughter of God get me out of here I I
[1:14:48] don't belong in this place oh can you
[1:14:51] say amen amen and so the Apostle Paul is
[1:14:55] telling you your Earthly amen is is full
[1:14:58] of chaos it's full of disease your
[1:15:01] spirit amen is full of complexes amen
[1:15:05] but he says but there's a promise there
[1:15:07] is a promise of eternal life you there
[1:15:10] is a resurrection for you there is a
[1:15:13] hope for you there is a promise of an
[1:15:17] eternal
[1:15:19] land you're coming out
[1:15:26] man so while the pest house was a was a
[1:15:31] symbol of death and suffering and pain
[1:15:35] amen you went in diseased and most of
[1:15:39] the time you came out in a body bag it
[1:15:44] was a forcible
[1:15:47] quarantine and when the soul of man died
[1:15:50] when the soul of man sinned and become
[1:15:52] diseased it was because of the Soul that
[1:15:55] that that that sin the soul that
[1:15:57] disbelieve now it is put in to
[1:16:01] this man quarantined into this
[1:16:06] body
[1:16:10] quarantine into that thing that you look
[1:16:12] in the mirror every
[1:16:14] morning and many times you're looking
[1:16:16] out those
[1:16:18] eyes you're looking in the
[1:16:20] mirror you're thinking do do I even know
[1:16:23] this person that I'm staring
[1:16:27] at do I Know Who I Am What am I am
[1:16:32] I what is going
[1:16:35] on I know way inside I know what I feel
[1:16:39] I know within my actions and my
[1:16:42] sometimes my my attitudes and sometimes
[1:16:45] my
[1:16:46] my I look at it don't look anything like
[1:16:49] what I feel on the inside of me
[1:16:56] the Apostle Paul says who can deliver
[1:17:01] me is there anyone who is able to
[1:17:05] deliver me from the body of this
[1:17:12] death but then he stops and he says but
[1:17:16] I thank God that my
[1:17:19] Lord oh can you say am man in fact let
[1:17:23] me just
[1:17:25] amen the brother Brandon would say
[1:17:29] brother Brandon would put it this way he
[1:17:30] would
[1:17:31] say as he's talking about the nature he
[1:17:34] he say I was speaking to my wife this
[1:17:35] morning I told her he said I said since
[1:17:38] I got saved 30 years ago as a
[1:17:44] boy she said what do you
[1:17:47] mean I said in this life
[1:17:51] some and I'm shaking myself to wake up
[1:17:56] take me into his presence
[1:18:02] did you wanted
[1:18:05] to that nightmare another
[1:18:09] place somewhere there something Beyond
[1:18:16] if conformed to IM time
[1:18:19] be it's just Dark Day a dream fixing to
[1:18:23] wake up who in a nightmare it was come
[1:18:25] out of into spring time Everlasting
[1:18:26] youth Everlasting Health Everlasting Joy
[1:18:28] Everlasting peace is it wonderful he so
[1:18:32] real the Apostle Paul in Romans 7:4 we
[1:18:35] know that the law is spiritual but I'm
[1:18:36] con sin that do not allow for I would
[1:18:39] that do I not and what I hate that I do
[1:18:42] if I that which I would not consent to
[1:18:43] the law that it is good now then it is
[1:18:45] no more how to do it but within me for I
[1:18:48] know not for I know that in me that is
[1:18:51] in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for
[1:18:55] to will is present with me but how to
[1:18:56] perform it that which is good I I not
[1:18:59] for the good that I would not but the
[1:19:01] evil which I would not that I do now if
[1:19:05] I do that I would not it is no more
[1:19:07] either do it but sin that dwelleth in me
[1:19:09] I find then a law that when I would do
[1:19:11] good evil is
[1:19:13] present for I Delight in the law of
[1:19:41] God after the inward
[1:19:44] man but I see another law in my members
[1:19:48] Waring against the law of my mind
[1:19:50] bringing it into some captivity to the
[1:19:53] law of sin which is my members oh riched
[1:19:56] man that I am who shall delivered me
[1:19:58] from the body of this death I thank God
[1:20:01] through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then
[1:20:04] with the mind I myself serve the law of
[1:20:07] God but with the flesh the law of
[1:20:10] sin now brother brandham would would
[1:20:14] explain this the as someone has asked
[1:20:17] the question to explain Romans uh 7:14
[1:20:22] to 18 we know that the law is spiritual
[1:20:24] but I'm carnal sold under sin for that
[1:20:27] which I would not and that I do and he
[1:20:29] says now she says this I cannot
[1:20:32] understand he said well they wrote out
[1:20:34] the scripture that's Paul speaking to
[1:20:36] Romans let me just kind of Polish it up
[1:20:38] so you can see in these two persons
[1:20:40] right one wants to do wrong the other
[1:20:43] one wants me to do every time I start to
[1:20:45] do right then the then the wrong hinders
[1:20:48] me how many of you people in interviews
[1:20:50] this afternoon has run the same thing
[1:20:52] and this morning the same thing I spoke
[1:20:55] on it this morning temporarily you're an
[1:20:57] outward man which is controlled by six
[1:20:59] senses and you're an inward man
[1:21:01] controlled by one sense which is Faith
[1:21:03] this Faith disagrees with all the six
[1:21:05] senses if the six senses don't agree
[1:21:07] with faith but one is contrary to the
[1:21:10] other now as long as the six senses
[1:21:13] agree with faith wonderful but when six
[1:21:15] senses disagree with faith then leave
[1:21:17] the six senses alone can you say Amen
[1:21:20] you see because that's that's that's the
[1:21:22] way that's that's God's plan you there
[1:21:25] is something Eternal on the inside of
[1:21:30] you you know if we have that kind of
[1:21:33] Grace and if we can find that kind of
[1:21:34] Grace for yourself in the mirror and
[1:21:37] understand that your your senses and
[1:21:39] your action sometimes doesn't always
[1:21:41] portray what you are on the inside you
[1:21:44] would have that same kind of Grace for
[1:21:45] somebody
[1:21:46] else you can't have that Grace for other
[1:21:49] people and have that Grace for you
[1:21:52] unless you're a hypocrite
[1:21:54] right because when you
[1:21:58] see that there is something on the
[1:22:01] inside of you that is screaming
[1:22:04] out screaming
[1:22:07] out to live that life screaming out to
[1:22:12] identify with
[1:22:14] that and
[1:22:16] then you find that the old flesh
[1:22:19] disagrees with it oh can you say amen
[1:22:23] amen that old thing just well Hallelujah
[1:22:26] you try to pray and then that old
[1:22:27] Devil's just right there to try you pull
[1:22:29] you down you you try you you you get up
[1:22:31] and you say I've I've overcome and then
[1:22:33] the next thing you know you fall flat on
[1:22:34] your face Hallelujah well glory to God
[1:22:38] amen amen the devil tell you why you
[1:22:41] lost the Holy Ghost and then you take
[1:22:43] him back to the scripture and say well
[1:22:44] you can't lose it amen you're sealed
[1:22:46] into the day of redemption then it'll
[1:22:47] tell you you never had it Hallelujah and
[1:22:49] then before you know it amen well why
[1:22:52] why why don't we quit wrestling with
[1:22:53] that because the Eternal Gene seed of
[1:22:55] God would not even want God's word it
[1:22:57] would not even crave for God's word well
[1:23:00] can you say amen amen you got to cry you
[1:23:03] got a craving for the things of God Amen
[1:23:06] the only way you'll ever receive the
[1:23:08] Holy Ghost the only way you're going to
[1:23:09] keep the Holy Ghost is by living in that
[1:23:11] world of Faith along with God living in
[1:23:14] that world of Faith saying God it's my
[1:23:16] desire to overcome it's my desire to
[1:23:19] live right it's my desire to press it's
[1:23:21] my desire to love it's my desire to show
[1:23:24] Mercy Mery it's my desire can you say
[1:23:28] Amen but yet you're
[1:23:30] Waring on the inside of
[1:23:42] you
[1:23:44] now he says for instance here Jesus made
[1:23:47] a statement of Promise the inside man
[1:23:48] says that's true the outside man reasons
[1:23:51] that it can't be true to you now I want
[1:23:54] you to understand that inside man says
[1:23:55] that's true the promise the statement a
[1:23:58] promise that Jesus made the inside man
[1:24:01] says that's true the outside man reasons
[1:24:03] that it's can't be true to
[1:24:06] you then ignore the outside man and
[1:24:09] accept the Inside Man now that's the
[1:24:11] same thing that Paul is speaking of he
[1:24:14] was sold under the law to carnal sin
[1:24:17] every one of us is the same that's the
[1:24:19] reason we have troubles married four or
[1:24:21] five times and this and that all kinds
[1:24:23] of sins adulteries and everything else
[1:24:26] in our lives is because of those things
[1:24:28] we're carnal but that must perish but
[1:24:33] then inside we are a spirit man the soul
[1:24:37] inside that's faith in God's word then
[1:24:41] when we bring our outside body under
[1:24:44] subjection to the word by Faith by
[1:24:46] accepting what God said well praise the
[1:24:49] Lord hallelujah how are you going to
[1:24:51] give power to the inside man amen by
[1:24:54] accepting by faith What God

[1:25:11] and make a grain of wheat out of it it's
[1:25:13] impossible for me to do the only way it

[1:25:19] has been transmitted from cockabur
[1:25:22] wheat from a Cocker wheat a a cockabur
[1:25:25] to a germ called wheat life then you

[1:26:06] you're going to be sticky you're going
[1:26:08] to have a carnal nature and that's going
[1:26:10] to bother you as long as you live but

[1:32:18] life you're going to be sticky in the
[1:32:19] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[1:32:21] as long as you're you're alive but on
[1:32:23] the inside of you born again when you're
[1:32:25] raised up you're in the likeness of
[1:32:26] Christ all that sin has been gone that's
[1:32:28] the
[1:32:29] thing
[1:32:32] Amen in in Hebrews chapter 4 he says you
[1:32:34] mustn't question anything to God for the
[1:32:37] footsteps of the righteous is ordered of
[1:32:38] God and every trial is put upon you to
[1:32:41] prove you the Bible says they're more
[1:32:44] precious to you than gold so if God let

[1:32:49] remember it's for the correcting of
[1:32:51] you every son that comes to God must
[1:32:54] first be chasen of God and tried and
[1:32:56] child trained there's no exceptions
[1:32:58] every son that
[1:32:59] comes these afflictions are done or
[1:33:02] brought about to see what attitude
[1:33:04] you'll take it's God on this Proving
[1:33:07] Ground that's all Earth is it's The
[1:33:10] Proving Grounds where he is trying to
[1:33:14] prove

[1:33:30] righteous but the Lord delivers them
[1:33:32] from them

[1:33:38] eternal
[1:33:41] life and the struggles are there can you
[1:33:45] say amen amen but
[1:33:48] remember things that are to be and I've
[1:33:51] read this to you hundreds of times over
[1:33:53] the years the real gift is your sew down
[1:33:55] in there see that was born of God that
[1:33:57] controls the whole thing to the word of

[1:34:05] son and daughter of God you're a child
[1:34:06] of God can you say
[1:34:08] Amen now when brother Brandon was
[1:34:10] talking about that that taking that that
[1:34:15] that verse as he's explaining amen that
[1:34:19] you know uh uh I thank God through my
[1:34:22] Lord through uh Jesus Christ Our Lord so
[1:34:26] then with the mind I serve the law of
[1:34:30] God and with the flesh the law of
[1:34:33] sin and and and brother bradam would
[1:34:35] would talk now what is he what is he
[1:34:37] talking about with a mind he says that
[1:34:41] mind man is is is is not talking about
[1:34:45] your fleshly mind
[1:34:50] amen he's not talking about your he bet
[1:34:53] but he's talking about that that new uh
[1:34:57] mind that was created in Christ amen he
[1:35:01] says now he says uh he says I thank God
[1:35:05] through our Lord Jesus Christ so that
[1:35:07] with a mind I myself serve the law of
[1:35:10] God he now he says now I uh uh he
[1:35:15] says uh all right exactly what Paul said
[1:35:19] many times over when I would do good
[1:35:21] evil is present see that's exactly what
[1:35:24] you do too with your mind that's your
[1:35:28] heart now remember you do not think with
[1:35:31] your mind you you think you you you see
[1:35:34] neither do you see with your eyes
[1:35:35] neither do you you see with your heart
[1:35:38] did you know that did you know your
[1:35:40] heart has another person in it besides
[1:35:42] yourself science just found that out
[1:35:44] about four years ago you know little
[1:35:46] compartment in the heart that the soul
[1:35:48] lives did you ever hear the subconscious
[1:35:50] you start to do anything and you think
[1:35:52] I'm just uh I'm just winding o over the
[1:35:55] top of it but your subconscious tells
[1:35:57] you different they take a light detector
[1:36:00] and and my my my good friend uh attorney
[1:36:03] Robinson sitting in the back he I I
[1:36:06] don't know whether he's ever done it or
[1:36:08] not uh but I happen to have put it on me
[1:36:12] one time about this Angel of the Lord
[1:36:13] here they put a light detector on you to
[1:36:16] confess the best of your knowledge the
[1:36:18] best thing that make it up just you know
[1:36:21] so nice and smoothed over that you you
[1:36:24] you uh didn't do such a thing like a
[1:36:27] criminal that that's a lie detector will
[1:36:29] turn right back and say you're lying see
[1:36:32] why it's the vibration of your nerves
[1:36:34] and they pick up uh on that lie detector
[1:36:37] and it'll tell you because why man was
[1:36:41] not made to lie in his original
[1:36:43] beginning and sin it's sin and the devil
[1:36:46] that's on you that makes you lie wasn't
[1:36:48] your makeup uh is is not to lie that
[1:36:51] that's the reason you have to live again
[1:36:54] because you was made created to live
[1:36:57] forever live always but you see sin come
[1:36:59] in and brought death to the body and
[1:37:02] then when this sin comes in and brings
[1:37:03] death to the body then of course the
[1:37:05] body has to die but in there can dwell
[1:37:08] eternal life when this Spirit has
[1:37:09] changed in you and you've got eternal
[1:37:11] life God will raise that body up in the
[1:37:14] last days so with your mind he says in
[1:37:16] another place I think or I have the mind
[1:37:19] of Christ now in the mind you serve
[1:37:23] Christ you serve God in the inward part
[1:37:26] you serve God the subconscious there's
[1:37:28] where faith lies and I want to ask you
[1:37:31] was there many times that you people in
[1:37:33] here many of you have seen times where
[1:37:36] you just know something was going to
[1:37:38] happen it look like it was impossible
[1:37:40] but you just know it was going to happen
[1:37:42] uh did did you ever have that he said
[1:37:44] that's that Faith it's the subconscious
[1:37:47] working and if and if it's getting now
[1:37:50] in the subconscious he says except a man
[1:37:53] be Born Again verely verily I say unto
[1:37:55] you except a man be born again he cannot
[1:37:58] see the kingdom of God you cannot see
[1:38:00] the kingdom because the kingdom of God
[1:38:02] is the holy spirit amen so brother
[1:38:05] bradam is is telling us I wanted to read
[1:38:07] just a portion of that because brother
[1:38:08] bradam is is is trying to to to let us
[1:38:12] know amen that it's not the natural mind
[1:38:16] but it is the spiritual mind what can
[1:38:19] you say man now the natural mind Romans
[1:38:23] 8 and seven because the carnal mind is
[1:38:26] enmity against God for it is not subject
[1:38:29] to the law of God neither indeed can be
[1:38:31] colians 1: 21 and you that were
[1:38:33] sometimes alienated enemies in your mind
[1:38:36] well Lord but Wicked works but he's
[1:38:38] reconciled you amen we see what what did
[1:38:41] what Galatians 524 they that are Christ
[1:38:43] have crucified the Flesh and the
[1:38:45] affections amen now I'm I'm just going
[1:38:48] to reach to you really quick keys can
[1:38:49] keep up with me that'll be but but write
[1:38:51] this down here the renewed mind in
[1:38:53] Romans 7:25 but thank God for Jesus
[1:38:55] Christ so then with the mind I serve the
[1:38:57] law of God Romans 12:2 be not conformed
[1:38:59] to this world but be transformed by the
[1:39:01] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:39:03] what is acceptable purp for this is the
[1:39:06] Covenant that I will make with the house
[1:39:07] of Israel after those days sayith the
[1:39:08] Lord I will put my laws in their mind
[1:39:11] and write them in their heart Ephesians
[1:39:14] 4:23 be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:39:18] mind and put on the new man Philippians
[1:39:21] 2 let this mind that was in you be in
[1:39:23] you which is also in Christ Jesus Romans
[1:39:26] 8:26 likewise the spirit stop our
[1:39:28] infirmities we know not how we should
[1:39:30] pray for as we ought for the spirit make
[1:39:33] inter for us with groing and he that
[1:39:35] search the heart knows what is the mind
[1:39:37] of spirit because he makes intercession
[1:39:39] for the Saints amen the Romans 864
[1:39:41] carnally minded is but spiritually
[1:39:43] minded is life and peace now now I want
[1:39:46] I want to bring these in is because you
[1:39:48] have within you to do a war going on
[1:39:51] there's a war going on in Israel there's
[1:39:53] a war going on Ukraine Russia there's
[1:39:54] Wars going on but within you is a war
[1:39:57] that's on since your new birth there
[1:39:58] been a new war brother says the the new
[1:40:00] birth he says there's when the battles
[1:40:03] really start to take
[1:40:05] place it's then after you have received
[1:40:07] the Holy Ghost and the battles really
[1:40:09] began but the Apostle Paul Romans 7:22 I
[1:40:12] Delight in the law of God after the
[1:40:15] inward man Colossians 4ans 4:6 which not
[1:40:20] though our man perish yet the inward man
[1:40:22] is renewed
[1:40:24] new can you say Amen
[1:40:28] now I want you to
[1:40:30] think L yourselves for just a moment I
[1:40:33] give another 15 there I really think of
[1:40:36] this because I think that this is
[1:40:38] freeing free you to yourself man the law
[1:40:42] of life I don't know if I ever heard of
[1:40:44] John G Lake he was he was one of the
[1:40:47] ministers there am man in the uh uh
[1:40:51] plague pic thousands and thousands had
[1:40:53] died and and he was a preacher
[1:40:56] that he was burying he was burying
[1:40:58] people for sometimes he he was putting
[1:41:01] one grave four five people at a time in
[1:41:03] it just but all the whole time he was
[1:41:05] there he says that he never he never
[1:41:07] took the plague the government came
[1:41:09] asking him and the medical and the
[1:41:11] medical field asking him man what what
[1:41:13] are you doing what what are you taking
[1:41:15] would like to use this man and and his
[1:41:18] response the law of life is greater than
[1:41:20] the law of death and he this I want to
[1:41:23] give you just a a little he says now
[1:41:25] watch the action of the law of life
[1:41:27] Faith belongs to the law of life it's
[1:41:29] the very opposite of fear Faith the
[1:41:30] opposite effect in spirit soul and body
[1:41:32] the spirit of man to become confident
[1:41:34] causes the mind of man to become restful
[1:41:36] and positive he says because in cont the
[1:41:38] spirit life I little fell with me went
[1:41:40] out marri many of who di from the plague
[1:41:42] we went into homes carried them out of
[1:41:44] the graves put them in sometimes with
[1:41:45] three or four grave we never took the
[1:41:47] disease why because the knowledge that
[1:41:49] the law of Life Christ Jesus protects us
[1:41:51] that law is working because of the fact
[1:41:53] that a man by the action of his will
[1:41:55] puts purposefully in contact with God
[1:41:57] faith takes possession of his heart and
[1:41:58] condition of his nature change instead
[1:42:00] of being Fe Faith instead being
[1:42:01] absorbent drawing everything to itself
[1:42:03] is spiritual sickness and disease the
[1:42:05] spirit of Christ
[1:42:07] Jesus from every the body plague I
[1:42:11] mentioned government ship supplies and
[1:42:12] core of doctors and one of the doctors
[1:42:15] sent for me and what they had been ask
[1:42:19] uh what we' been using protect ourselves
[1:42:21] and
[1:42:26] uh and they said but but we concluded
[1:42:29] that a man could stay on the ground as
[1:42:30] you have and ministering to the sicking
[1:42:32] the dead you must have a secret what is
[1:42:37] it Jesus I believe that just as long as
[1:42:41] I keep my soul in contact with the
[1:42:42] Living God so that his spirit is flowing
[1:42:45] into my soul and body that no germ will
[1:42:47] ever attach itself to me for the spirit
[1:42:49] of God will kill it he asked
[1:42:56] I replied no but doctor I think you
[1:42:59] would like to experiment with me and so
[1:43:01] what he told him he
[1:43:22] said
[1:43:52] e
[1:44:22] e e
[1:45:11] is now because that that plague was so
[1:45:13] bad that they would foam out the mouth
[1:45:17] and puss and and and uh take your take
[1:45:22] your instruments and put that upon the
[1:45:26] on your on your little scope your what
[1:45:29] is that little thing there microscope he
[1:45:32] says and you'll what the Bible says that
[1:45:35] I am the spirit of
[1:45:38] life is greater than the law of
[1:45:43] death oh Hallelujah have you ever
[1:45:47] thought about that the spirit of life in
[1:45:51] you is great
[1:45:53] than the law of death that surrounds
[1:45:57] you it allows you to believe can you say
[1:46:02] Amen it it it it it it causes you
[1:46:06] brother brandham would
[1:46:07] say he he he would say this he said
[1:46:50] he says for instance he says when when a
[1:46:53] man gets saved he said the light that
[1:46:56] comes into him is about like this white
[1:46:58] button on my shirt then on the inside he
[1:47:02] has only one gate one entrance to go in
[1:47:04] the shik of Glory where God can enter
[1:47:06] into him and take over his his his
[1:47:09] control tower and that way is through
[1:47:11] your self-will whether you will or not
[1:47:13] that's up to you but that's the only
[1:47:15] Avenue that opens up to the man that God
[1:47:18] can come into his heart is by your
[1:47:21] self-will it puts him right back like
[1:47:23] Adam and Eve on free moral agency you
[1:47:25] can choose right or wrong either one to
[1:47:28] do he goes on and says and he says now
[1:47:31] he can let that Spirit grow and take at
[1:47:35] all the roots of bitterness and press
[1:47:37] God's way through him again he can
[1:47:40] become in the same condition that he was
[1:47:43] when he was in the Garden of Eden Jesus
[1:47:45] said Mark 11:24 verily verily I say unto
[1:47:48] you if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:47:50] and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:47:52] believe what you said will come to pass
[1:47:55] you will have what you said that puts
[1:47:57] him back Supreme again it puts him back
[1:48:01] in the condition he said the Messiah the
