[39:16] heard it before but I trust it'll be a
[39:18] blessing to you I I uh just have to do
[39:22] what we feel led just have to be myself
[39:24] and I can't be anybody else so but I
[39:27] appreciate you having us here and I know
[39:29] you're your pastor brother Wendell
[39:31] having us it's intimidating to preach in
[39:34] wle Martin's Pulpit because of the the
[39:37] the the uh standard that he has held in
[39:40] Ministry and he can sing and preach and
[39:42] I can't so but uh we do what we can and
[39:46] we want to be a help wherever we're at
[39:48] we want to pick up our cross and carry
[39:51] it what I want to talk to you tonight
[39:52] compelled to carry the cross and I just
[39:55] want us to think about it won't keep you
[39:57] long tonight the Lord willing Matthew
[39:59] 27:32 and as they came out they found a
[40:02] man of sirene Simon by name him they
[40:06] compelled to bear his cross Luke
[40:11] 23:26 tells the same story as they led
[40:14] him away they laid hold upon one Simon a
[40:18] sirenian coming out of the country on
[40:21] him they laid the cross that he might
[40:24] bear it after Jesus I pray the Lord
[40:26] would add his Blessing to the word you
[40:28] may be
[40:33] seated at the time that Simon was
[40:36] compelled to carry the Cross of Christ
[40:39] he' been Jesus had been through uh six
[40:42] separate trials right lasting more than
[40:46] 24 hours that he had been from the time
[40:49] he'd been with his disciples and then
[40:51] he'd went through the hours of Agony in
[40:53] the garden he'd been taken beaten and he
[40:56] humiliated to
[40:58] prison and and I love this about Jesus
[41:01] that as he was examined by them none of
[41:03] them found a reason that they could
[41:06] accuse him
[41:07] righteously I'll be honest with you
[41:09] brother Josh if they put me through six
[41:11] separate trials they'd find
[41:13] something they'd say he didn't do this
[41:15] or he didn't do that or he he was not
[41:18] diligent enough and whatever they'd find
[41:20] something to accuse me of and they could
[41:22] righteously accuse me but they could not
[41:24] find a thing against the Lamb of God I'm
[41:27] so glad we have a spotless lamb tonight
[41:29] I'm so glad we can trust him I'm so glad
[41:32] we can put our faith and our confidence
[41:34] in the one that came and took our sins
[41:36] we don't have to carry them anymore he
[41:38] carried them for us and he was that
[41:41] spotless lamb that was examined and he
[41:43] was held up before him and even pilate
[41:45] had to say I find no fault in him oh I
[41:49] wonder if we can say that tonight I find
[41:51] no fault in him I'm looking at the word
[41:54] I look at the message of the hour and
[41:56] and I can't find any fault in it I see
[41:58] the bloody lamb and I know that there's
[42:00] no fault in it at all it's just him he's
[42:03] the one that died for me he's the one to
[42:05] save me and the word has no fault in it
[42:07] at all amen I find no fault in him and
[42:10] if I find no fault in him I find no
[42:13] fault in you either because you're the
[42:15] purchase of his
[42:17] blood oh don't you believe that tonight
[42:20] amen he they could not accuse him
[42:23] righteously you know what he was he was
[42:25] a suffering
[42:26] servant a suffering servant you find the
[42:30] concept of a suffering servant in the
[42:32] book of Isaiah I didn't I didn't give
[42:35] them all the scriptures tonight and I
[42:37] even don't have this on my notes but
[42:39] I've thought about this a lot lately
[42:41] that God there's an attribute of God
[42:42] that's a suffering servant and and I
[42:45] believe your pastor uh is acquainted
[42:48] with that I believe that's something
[42:50] that he does you know you don't always
[42:51] you know it's not always for popularity
[42:54] but you you suffer many times as you
[42:55] serve God and if you serve God for long
[42:58] you know that and yet you yet you must
[43:01] do it you're compelled to do it there's
[43:02] something inside of you that that calls
[43:04] you to it it's servanthood but it's what
[43:07] God wants you to do and so you're
[43:08] willing to do it but you suffer many
[43:11] times in doing that and and so in Isaiah
[43:13] 42 he talks about if you give me Isaiah
[43:15] 42:1 he talks about a suffering servant
[43:18] he said behold my servant whom I uphold
[43:21] my elect in whom my soul delighted all
[43:24] right I put my spirit upon on him now
[43:27] when we look at having the spirit of God
[43:29] upon upon us we would think we would
[43:32] think that that would mean that we were
[43:34] uh we we were jumping and shouting and
[43:36] running and that's wonderful when we do
[43:38] but that's not the his Spirit as it was
[43:40] displayed in the suffering servant was
[43:42] actually one who would not bear witness
[43:45] to
[43:46] himself amen so the next verse says he
[43:48] shall not cry nor lift up his his voice
[43:52] in the streets Oh my he he will not
[43:55] cause his voice to be heard in the
[43:58] street he will not cry and he will not
[44:00] cause his voice to be heard in the
[44:02] street and and verse three Isaiah 42:3 a
[44:05] bruised re shall he not break and what
[44:08] that verse two means is is that he will
[44:10] not be a
[44:11] self-promoter I wonder if we've got that
[44:13] kind of spirit on us that would not be a
[44:16] self-promoter I'll do whatever you call
[44:18] me to do Lord I'll I'll fill the place
[44:20] that you've given me to fill I'm not
[44:22] going to I'm not going to toot my own
[44:24] horn I'm not going to go out and try to
[44:25] find something to do but I'm going to do
[44:27] whatever needs to be done in the place
[44:29] where I'm at
[44:30] today that's right everybody's looking
[44:33] to serve God I say serve God in the
[44:35] place where you are in the condition
[44:37] where you are it may be just vacuuming
[44:39] the church it might be picking up some
[44:41] dishes whatever it is and I thank God
[44:43] for those men who have a revelation
[44:45] those ladies who have a revelation that
[44:46] serving God is serving his people we
[44:49] need more suffering servants and and
[44:51] let's uh start them around us very true
[44:57] amen yes he was a suffering servant said
[45:02] a bruised readed shall he not break I
[45:04] love that what that means is if you're
[45:06] already bruised he won't break
[45:08] you if you're already bruised he's not
[45:11] going to kick you down he's not going to
[45:13] cause more harm to you but he's actually
[45:15] going to help you brother B says if
[45:17] you're if you're if you struggle and
[45:18] things like that I'm paraphrasing but he
[45:20] uses that scripture a bruised read he
[45:22] won't break if you had trouble in your
[45:24] life he won't break you he wants to miss
[45:26] you he wants to heal
[45:28] you bruised breed that's his purpose a
[45:31] bruised breed rather he he will not
[45:33] break the smoking flx shall he not Quin
[45:36] he qu sh he shall bring forth judgment
[45:38] unto truth he shall not fail nor be
[45:41] discouraged shall he set judgment in the
[45:43] earth and the a shall wait for his law
[45:45] oh what a wonderful promise that the
[45:47] suffering servant has you can find more
[45:49] on the suffering servant in in Isaiah 52
[45:52] at the very end there at verse 13 you
[45:54] can read down into Isaiah 53 and find
[45:57] that he was one who was despised and
[45:59] rejected of Men Who Bore our grease and
[46:01] carried our sorrows yet we did a steem
[46:04] him strick and smitten of God and
[46:06] Afflicted but he was wounded for my
[46:07] transgression he was bruised for my
[46:10] iniquity the chastisement of my peace
[46:12] was upon him and by his stripes I am
[46:16] healed oh do we believe that tonight
[46:20] amen bless the Lord he is the suffering
[46:22] servant bless the Lord in Mark 146 5 it
[46:26] says some begin to spit on
[46:29] him to cover his face and to Buffet him
[46:32] and to say unto him prophesy and the
[46:35] servants oh you don't know how that
[46:37] makes me feel tonight the
[46:40] slaves struck him with the palm of their
[46:43] hands he was a suffering
[46:46] servant Psalms 1293 the plowers plowed
[46:49] upon my back they made long their
[46:52] furrows Isaiah 50 and6 I gave my back to
[46:55] the smiters my cheeks to them that
[46:57] plucked off the hair I hid not my face
[47:00] from shame and
[47:03] spitting in John 19:1 the Bible says
[47:05] that pilate took Jesus and scourged him
[47:08] Scourge is the word scourged isn't very
[47:10] descriptive but they took a cat of
[47:12] Ninetails they took a whip and what it
[47:14] would do they would put glass or little
[47:15] rocks in the end of it and they would
[47:17] actually hit you when they hit you it
[47:19] would wrap around your body and as it as
[47:21] they pulled it it would pull chunks of
[47:23] flesh out of your back oh my
[47:26] they said the Bible says in Isaiah when
[47:28] he's describing the suffering servant he
[47:30] describes him as being so marred that
[47:33] you couldn't even recognize who he
[47:36] was the soldiers platted a PL a crown of
[47:39] thorns and put it on his head and they
[47:41] put on him a purple robe and said hail
[47:43] King of the Jews and they smote him with
[47:45] their hands in verse four four pilate
[47:48] therefore went forth again and said unto
[47:50] them behold I bring him forth to you
[47:52] that you may know I find no fault in
[47:57] him brother Bram talks about that time
[47:59] when he goes back to Jerusalem and he
[48:01] gives us a little drama of it he said
[48:03] 1900 years ago was a strange odd morning
[48:05] he said there was never a morning like
[48:07] that morning the sun came up but it
[48:08] looked like it was very strange
[48:10] something was going on he said about
[48:12] 9:00 we're standing in a room I hear a
[48:14] mob screaming someone says away with him
[48:17] I see a little woman run out in front of
[48:19] the mob and say what has he done he's
[48:21] only healed your sick and brought hopes
[48:22] to the Hopeless what has he done to
[48:24] deserve this who's she talking about out
[48:26] yeah he said I look behind I hear
[48:27] something going bump you've heard this
[48:29] many times but just think about it now
[48:31] in this context bump bump bump he said
[48:34] here's an old cross coming dragging down
[48:36] the street blood just dragging out the
[48:38] cross is dragging his bloody Footprints
[48:41] out coming down the street spit hanging
[48:43] over his face he carried his cross after
[48:46] he'd been beaten after he'd been up all
[48:48] night after he had been through the
[48:49] struggle after they falsely accused him
[48:52] after he'd given everything he had in
[48:54] the Garden of Gethsemane after after he
[48:55] prayed all night that's when he did the
[48:57] work that God required him to
[49:03] do the devil walking around saying
[49:05] enough he was the son of God he never
[49:08] put up with something like that he does
[49:09] the same thing today he walks around and
[49:12] accuses and says if you were a real
[49:13] Christian you wouldn't be going through
[49:15] that he went through it it's becoming to
[49:19] me to suffer in my life at times when
[49:22] need be I believe that there's joy as a
[49:24] Christian and and there's peace as a
[49:26] Christian all those things but there's
[49:28] times when it's becoming to me as a
[49:29] Christian to suffer for him and I said
[49:32] let it be so he suffered for
[49:36] me all
[49:38] right he goes up the
[49:42] hill brother brand said I noticed he's
[49:44] got a white garment on but there's
[49:45] little red spots all over that white
[49:47] garment and they get bigger and larger
[49:49] as he goes he's losing blood with his
[49:52] blood he's losing strength yeah you ever
[49:55] known somebody that needed a blood
[49:56] transfusion they don't know why they're
[49:57] really weak they need a blood
[49:58] transfusion they need more blood they're
[50:01] just they're losing blood somewhere they
[50:03] need more blood he's losing blood as he
[50:04] walks up the
[50:06] hill he didn't make it easy on him to
[50:09] take it he said here's this after a
[50:11] while just one great big bloody Splash
[50:14] smacking up against his legs going to
[50:18] Calvary you get the picture of one who's
[50:21] who's done all that he can do humanly
[50:23] speaking and we know he went to Calvary
[50:25] as a
[50:25] man he didn't go as an angel he didn't
[50:29] go even as God he went as a
[50:33] man he could have went in a different
[50:35] way he could have he could have done it
[50:37] but he had to do what his father called
[50:39] him to do so he goes as a man and when
[50:43] he does in in his Humanity he gets weak
[50:46] yeah God doesn't get weak but the body
[50:50] got
[50:51] weak I want you to understand it tonight
[50:53] God doesn't get weak but his body
[50:57] does and so he he God was not weak but
[51:00] but the body of Christ that God had
[51:03] dwelt him he was going up the hill and
[51:05] he
[51:08] falls and I want you to understand when
[51:10] he
[51:11] fell that heaven was
[51:15] quiet can you imagine come on you kids I
[51:18] hope you can see it tonight can you
[51:20] imagine he
[51:22] falls if he can't go on up the hill
[51:26] All Is
[51:29] Lost see he has to fulfill what's
[51:33] written about him in the
[51:35] scripture so he has to be able to get up
[51:38] and carry his cross but he's physically
[51:40] unable to do
[51:43] it now I can imagine the angels caught
[51:47] their breath yeah for a moment for a
[51:50] brief moment the work of redemption was
[51:53] suspended all right
[51:56] yeah come on but Before Time
[52:00] began God had a way a plan for this
[52:04] moment I want to tell you tonight when
[52:06] the body of Christ gets weak Before Time
[52:08] began God had a plan to get you through
[52:11] he had a plan to pick you up he had a
[52:13] plan that there would be somebody there
[52:15] to help
[52:16] [Applause]
[52:19] youall Bless The Name of Jesus and the
[52:22] Roman
[52:23] soldier not even knowing the part he was
[52:28] playing as they come to a Crossroads and
[52:30] here stands people at the crossroads and
[52:32] there's one there in African man named
[52:34] Simon of
[52:36] sirene from Northern Africa he sees that
[52:40] African man standing in the crowd and he
[52:42] says
[52:43] you you carry his
[52:46] cross if you had asked Simon who called
[52:48] him he would have said a Roman soldier
[52:50] all right if you'd asked Simon why he
[52:53] did what he did he' have said I just did
[52:54] what I had to do I did what I was
[52:56] compelled to
[52:59] do and it's it's interesting to note at
[53:03] that time that who was not there when
[53:06] Jesus got weak Peter wasn't there come
[53:09] on he had denied him all right James and
[53:12] John weren't
[53:15] there they weren't called upon no men of
[53:17] great reputation I I don't want you to
[53:19] saell yourself short tonight God's got
[53:21] something for you to do he's got
[53:23] something for me to do yeah huj the men
[53:26] of great reputation weren't standing
[53:28] there he said well we're we're a small
[53:30] group and we're we're in Pony Oklahoma
[53:32] and and we're just a a bunch of
[53:35] hillbillies or rednecks that's what we
[53:36] are in Arkansas anyway you said that's
[53:38] just who we are but I'll say this God's
[53:40] got something for you to do and I'm so
[53:42] thankful that when I get weak that the
[53:45] body of Christ in Pony Oklahoma can pick
[53:47] up the slack and when you get weak I
[53:49] hope the body of Christ in in Hardy
[53:51] Arkansas can pick up the slack on Carry
[53:55] the
[53:57] Cross bless the
[53:59] Lord he was a seemingly random
[54:03] bystander of A different
[54:06] race the black man from sirene near
[54:10] Libya the Bible tells us he was coming
[54:12] out of the country he didn't live in
[54:13] Jerusalem perhaps he was going to offer
[54:15] a lamb for a sacrifice maybe on some
[54:17] other business and he just happened to
[54:20] be standing there caught by circumstance
[54:22] in the very place where Jesus would need
[54:25] him to
[54:32] be I want to ask you tonight why
[54:34] wouldn't God just send Supernatural
[54:36] strength yeah on to Jesus to carry the
[54:39] cross yeah why not have Angels pick it
[54:42] up and carry it Jesus has done enough
[54:44] you would think at that moment why not
[54:46] just have Angels carry it but that's not
[54:47] how God works brother Brown said he uses
[54:51] men how many believe that tonight he
[54:53] does nothing outside of what he does by
[54:55] men he said we realize that that's his
[54:58] agent that's what he chose he said why I
[55:00] don't
[55:01] know that's pretty good is it that's he
[55:04] said why I don't know but he does it
[55:06] amen why I don't know he said he could
[55:09] have made the son to preach the gospel
[55:10] he could make the wind to preach the
[55:12] gospel he can make the wind to do things
[55:13] but he chose men that was his idea that
[55:17] human being would speak back through
[55:18] human not himself but the word of the
[55:20] Lord came to the prophets the prophesy
[55:22] the preachers he said in a prophet s
[55:25] that denies the original word how can he
[55:26] be a true prophet he can't be because
[55:28] he's denying the truth of the word but
[55:30] he uses men he uses men only he uses the
[55:33] agency of men and not Mechanical Devices
[55:35] he hides himself behind skin and uses
[55:38] the space created by the weakness of Man
[55:41] by by by the by the struggles that we
[55:43] have he actually uses the space created
[55:45] by weakness to make himself strong amen
[55:48] and and he fulfills his word Through
[55:51] People Like Us okay all right are you
[55:54] still with me tonight oh yeah oh
[56:01] yeah without someone there to carry the
[56:03] cross of scripture could not be
[56:05] fulfilled and I and I'll say it like
[56:07] this and just don't know how to more
[56:09] bluntly to put it without you doing your
[56:11] job in the
[56:12] church the scripture couldn't be
[56:15] fulfilled there's a scripture written
[56:17] for our day it'll be a glorious Church
[56:19] Without spot a wrinkle a bride to put
[56:21] her wedding garments on and you say well
[56:22] my job's not very important but without
[56:25] you doing what you do the scripture
[56:27] could not be
[56:29] fulfilled it's part of it and so in
[56:32] Psalms 224 there was a scripture said
[56:34] I'm poured out like water my bones d a
[56:36] joint my heart is like Wax it's melted
[56:38] in the midst of my bows my strength is
[56:40] dried up like a pot shirt my tongue
[56:42] cleaveth to my jaws thou Hast brought me
[56:44] into the dust of death dogs have
[56:46] encompassed me the Assembly of the
[56:47] wicked have enclosed me they pierced my
[56:50] hands and my feet he said I may tell all
[56:52] my bones they look and stare upon me
[56:54] they part my garment among them cast
[56:55] thought upon my vesture this the
[56:57] scripture David speaking under prophecy
[57:00] he's speaking of the
[57:02] crucifixion Jesus cannot die on the way
[57:05] to the to Calvary he's got to go through
[57:07] with it how's he going to go through
[57:08] with it with the help of
[57:11] Simon without Simon oh God I hope you
[57:14] recognize your part in the message of
[57:16] the hour you say well I'm not a prophet
[57:18] I'm not a preacher but you have a part
[57:19] in the message of the hour without Simon
[57:22] picking up his cross there would be no
[57:24] crucifix
[57:25] without you picking up your cross and
[57:27] carrying it in the house of God there
[57:29] would be no good server there would be
[57:30] no meetings there would be no no lost
[57:32] loved ones come in there would be no
[57:34] healing why because you didn't do it but
[57:36] I believe you've taken up your cross and
[57:38] you do it and because of that you
[57:40] fulfilled the word of God for your day
[57:42] because of that the words of God could
[57:45] be
[57:46] fulfilled brother brandom talked about
[57:48] how many outstanding prophecies was
[57:50] fulfilled he said you said this has to
[57:52] happen and that has to happen but he
[57:53] said if you look at the 20 22d Psalm
[57:56] watch his dying hour at the cross he
[57:58] said many outstanding prophecies was
[58:00] fulfilled in the last two or three hours
[58:03] of his life as he hung on a cross that
[58:07] Simon
[58:09] carried come
[58:13] on he could have called 10,000
[58:16] angels but he chose
[58:23] Simon the scripture says Simon was
[58:26] compelled that's always struck me he was
[58:28] compelled compelled by a Roman
[58:31] soldier but I believe predestined by
[58:34] God to be in that moment because we know
[58:37] nothing happens by chance he was
[58:40] compelled to be at that crossroads at
[58:42] that time to to be at that stoplight as
[58:45] we would say today at the right time
[58:48] that when the body of Christ grew weak
[58:51] he was there to pick up the
[58:53] cross and I'm I just want this to be my
[58:57] testimony church and I preach this all
[58:59] over the world but I want this to be my
[59:01] testimony I pray it be the testimony of
[59:03] this church and our church and Hardy and
[59:05] others around the message uh we don't
[59:06] want great fortune or fame I I don't
[59:08] want my name to be known all over the
[59:10] world just let me be there that when the
[59:13] body if the body of Christ is weak let
[59:15] me be there to pick it
[59:17] up let me be there to be one somebody's
[59:20] got to take the hard jobs somebody's got
[59:23] to do what others won't be with willing
[59:24] to do somebody's got to do the thing
[59:27] that needs to be done let it be me would
[59:29] that be your prayer tonight let it be me
[59:32] I won't be a complainer I won't be a
[59:34] rejector I won't be a a burden on the
[59:36] people of the pastor of the church I'm
[59:38] going to be one who carries my cross
[59:40] with all that I've got in me I'm going
[59:42] to I'm going to live for this message
[59:44] I'm going to believe this message you're
[59:46] not here by chance Simon wasn't there by
[59:48] chance you are not here tonight in this
[59:50] building by chance you are not given the
[59:53] gifts that you have by chance you've
[59:55] been compelled to carry the
[59:57] cross you were not born into your family
[59:59] by chance but in God's Great drama you
[1:00:02] play a part you see some had to be the
[1:00:05] high priest that lied on him some had to
[1:00:09] be the guards that smoted him some were
[1:00:14] disciples but some somebody had to carry
[1:00:18] his
[1:00:22] cross brother Bram says this
[1:00:25] he said in his army presents his army in
[1:00:27] the form of five officers Apostles
[1:00:29] prophets teachers pastors evangelists
[1:00:31] that's his soldiers commanding officers
[1:00:33] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:35] waiting out there to meet the enemy on
[1:00:37] any grounds he comes upon to meet the
[1:00:39] enemy with the word of God He said Each
[1:00:42] one backing one another up I believe
[1:00:44] that's what we ought to do I believe if
[1:00:46] I come to the house of God and I preach
[1:00:48] from the window he preaches we ought to
[1:00:49] back one another up as long as we stay
[1:00:52] with the word let's back each other up
[1:00:55] He said Each one backing one another up
[1:00:57] with him the chief Captain not out there
[1:00:59] in front up here above back behind but
[1:01:01] in them he said that's the Army
[1:01:03] vindicating his resurrection by the
[1:01:05] proof of his Works he said he that
[1:01:07] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:01:09] shall he do also what is it it's God in
[1:01:11] the church and these five predestinated
[1:01:13] officers backing up every word that he
[1:01:15] said with the Holy Spirit himself in
[1:01:17] there which is the word made manifest
[1:01:19] proving his resurrection proving that he
[1:01:20] lives you believe he lives tonight he
[1:01:23] proved that he lives listen he compels
[1:01:27] us if you're a preacher today I want to
[1:01:30] challenge you by this he compels you to
[1:01:32] car you can't stop preaching because
[1:01:35] when you stop it just burns within you
[1:01:37] I've tried to do it you try to stop for
[1:01:39] a while and you just can't do it why
[1:01:41] there's something inside of you you may
[1:01:42] not be the best preacher in the world
[1:01:44] you may not I understand that I I'm I I
[1:01:46] realize that I'm not the one that can be
[1:01:49] the best preacher out there but I also
[1:01:51] know this I may not be the best speaker
[1:01:53] but I'm needed somewhere not everybody
[1:01:55] has to hear my Ministry but somebody
[1:01:57] does or God wouldn't have given me this
[1:01:58] ministry that's
[1:02:02] right he compels me to fulfill his
[1:02:07] word now brother Brandon said Jesus
[1:02:10] Corporal body is sitting at the right
[1:02:12] hand of God in the Majesty on high as a
[1:02:14] sin offering and then his spirit that
[1:02:16] was in that body has come back into
[1:02:18] predestined for ordained offices in the
[1:02:21] church he said that this is powerful he
[1:02:24] he said you touch God the same way
[1:02:26] through these bodies that's not in their
[1:02:29] own self not worthy sure not but they
[1:02:32] don't stand in their own righteousness
[1:02:34] they stand in the robe of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:37] in his righteousness to declare his
[1:02:42] Works see we we've but we've each been
[1:02:44] called to car cross not just prophets
[1:02:45] and preachers Luke 9:23 he said to them
[1:02:49] all he said to them all if any man
[1:02:53] someone say it with me any man man any
[1:02:55] man will come after me let him deny
[1:02:57] himself take up his cross daily and
[1:03:01] follow me Paul put it this way in
[1:03:04] Galatians he said I'm crucified with
[1:03:05] Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but
[1:03:08] Christ liveth in me and the life which I
[1:03:10] now live in the flesh I live by the
[1:03:11] faith of the Son of God who loved me and
[1:03:13] gave himself for me I'm crucified with
[1:03:16] Christ oh carry my
[1:03:18] cross I've been compelled I wasn't
[1:03:21] compelled because I chose to I wasn't
[1:03:23] compelled I didn't put myself in the
[1:03:25] ministry I didn't promote myself but I
[1:03:27] was standing there when the body of
[1:03:29] Christ had a need and I just stepped up
[1:03:31] and took up my cross what what about any
[1:03:33] other job not just preaching but
[1:03:35] anything you do for God you said brother
[1:03:36] Ben I don't know what I'm supposed to be
[1:03:38] doing the Lord hasn't revealed to me do
[1:03:40] what needs to be
[1:03:45] done do what do what you can do that
[1:03:48] needs to be done and you'll fulfill the
[1:03:50] word of God you'll move the power of God
[1:03:52] forward there are things you can can do
[1:03:54] if you're a woman you won't be called to
[1:03:55] be a preacher but you might be called to
[1:03:57] do something else in the body that's
[1:03:59] just as important for that particular
[1:04:00] service as the preacher that preach his
[1:04:02] sermon you might be called to get down
[1:04:04] on your knees and pray and call out to
[1:04:06] God for this service you might be called
[1:04:08] to to sing or to worship or do whatever
[1:04:10] it is that you do you might have been
[1:04:12] called just to be there so someone could
[1:04:14] see you there and be
[1:04:22] encouraged I'm compelled
[1:04:24] to carry the cross I don't know this is
[1:04:26] different but if you ever felt like that
[1:04:28] I'm
[1:04:32] compelled now each one of you each per
[1:04:34] each person's cross is different because
[1:04:36] each one has a different purpose well
[1:04:37] the brandom says this this is an
[1:04:38] interesting way of looking at it
[1:04:39] especially after the banquet last night
[1:04:42] brother Brown said don't turn your wife
[1:04:43] down because she's got a little
[1:04:45] temper he said maybe that's your
[1:04:48] cross wo it got
[1:04:53] quiet
[1:04:55] I married a thank God I married a girl
[1:04:58] with almost no temper like she just
[1:05:00] almost no temper she it's possible for
[1:05:04] me to make her mad but make her angry
[1:05:06] but it's very rare and I'm so thankful
[1:05:08] for that because there was a lot of
[1:05:09] people that wouldn't have worked
[1:05:11] with but I'm so glad God gave me the
[1:05:13] right one aren't you glad of
[1:05:15] that but he said maybe that's your cross
[1:05:18] people think well I meant this is
[1:05:20] difficult I need to get out of it that's
[1:05:21] not what we
[1:05:22] do maybe that's your cross he said God
[1:05:26] might have give it to you to kind of
[1:05:27] keep you lined up he said same thing
[1:05:29] with you women do your husband stick
[1:05:30] together you promis God you would so
[1:05:32] stay with
[1:05:34] it a preacher's wife has a cross to bear
[1:05:37] and many times it's her husband's
[1:05:38] Ministry you think of Moses and zephra
[1:05:40] and what brother brother R talked about
[1:05:42] this and he said what that's what a what
[1:05:44] a mixup the people has got in today I
[1:05:46] think that Christianity is one of the
[1:05:47] softest things said all they do is put
[1:05:49] their name on a book and have somebody
[1:05:50] to sprinkle them or something another
[1:05:52] and give the minister the right hand of
[1:05:53] Fellowship that's all there is to it he
[1:05:55] said going out he said that's not
[1:05:56] Christianity Christianity is self-denial
[1:05:59] amen no matter who you are preacher
[1:06:01] Preachers Wife Deacon just a person in
[1:06:03] the church Christianity is self-denial
[1:06:05] take up your cross daily and follow
[1:06:09] him see to take up your cross and to
[1:06:13] take up your cross I know there's
[1:06:14] nothing new but listen to me for just a
[1:06:18] minute to take up your cross is to
[1:06:21] humble yourself to the vision that God
[1:06:24] has for your life and it may not match
[1:06:26] what you wanted to
[1:06:29] do I remember wanting to be a mechanic
[1:06:32] at some point in my life and I have no
[1:06:33] gift at all for working on
[1:06:37] cars but I had decided that I was going
[1:06:39] to be a mechanic because I did not want
[1:06:41] to become my father my father was a
[1:06:44] preacher and I just did not want to do
[1:06:46] that and so I I decided I was going to
[1:06:49] be a mechanic and that's the problem I I
[1:06:51] can't even I I can't even change my own
[1:06:53] oil and and so I pay somebody else to do
[1:06:56] that so I found that that was not I was
[1:06:59] not gifted with that and and you've been
[1:07:01] gifted with certain things but it may
[1:07:03] not be what you had in your mind but you
[1:07:05] got to humble yourself to the vision of
[1:07:07] God to what we talked about this morning
[1:07:09] the thoughts that God had of you for
[1:07:11] your own life the Rich Young Ruler was
[1:07:14] UN unwilling to do that in mark 10:21 it
[1:07:16] says Jesus beholding him loved him and
[1:07:20] said one thing you lack go your way sell
[1:07:22] whatever you have and give to the poor
[1:07:24] and you will have treasure in heaven and
[1:07:25] come take up the cross and follow me and
[1:07:28] it said he was sad at that saying and
[1:07:30] went away grief for he had great
[1:07:32] possessions the message of the hour did
[1:07:34] not match the vision he had for his life
[1:07:37] and so he could would not carry the
[1:07:39] cross and because he would not carry the
[1:07:40] cross he could not receive the reward
[1:07:43] but I'm so glad there's some people here
[1:07:44] today that Carri the cross like Moses
[1:07:47] did he refused to be called the son of
[1:07:49] Pharaoh's daughter but he took upon
[1:07:51] himself the form of a servant and oh my
[1:07:54] just like Jesus did in a type he took on
[1:07:56] himself the form of a servant and become
[1:07:58] a mud dber for the people of God I
[1:08:00] believe there's some people here willing
[1:08:02] to take up their cross and follow him
[1:08:05] the Rich Young Ruler was not willing to
[1:08:06] do what it takes to be saved until it
[1:08:08] was too late and then he tried to get
[1:08:10] them to go back and raise the dead so
[1:08:12] people would believe but it was too late
[1:08:13] we got to carry the cross now today at
[1:08:16] the moment the opportunity is
[1:08:18] given when we meet the body of Christ
[1:08:20] when we meet together and we see some
[1:08:22] part that's weak when we see some part
[1:08:24] that's burdened when we see some part of
[1:08:26] it that needs something from God let me
[1:08:28] be the one that offers the prayer let me
[1:08:30] be the one that cries out to
[1:08:33] God Amen me do what needs to be done yes
[1:08:38] that's why sometimes you see preachers
[1:08:39] taking out the trash or helping in some
[1:08:43] way because it just needs to be
[1:08:46] done right and I just call attention to
[1:08:49] that because you all do that wonderfully
[1:08:50] and I'm so glad for the ministry God has
[1:08:52] put here but all of us
[1:08:54] just do what needs to be
[1:08:55] done wouldn't it go a lot
[1:08:58] better if we just work like that he said
[1:09:02] but but it won't be easy no it won't be
[1:09:03] easy of course not it's a
[1:09:07] cross but you got to have a lamb nature
[1:09:10] that's why he could be the the servant
[1:09:13] the suffering servant of God he was a
[1:09:14] lamb the Bible says he was oppressed and
[1:09:17] he was afflicted yet he opened not his
[1:09:20] mouth oh God help me today I want to
[1:09:22] speak out in my defense so often but God
[1:09:24] help me as a pastor to to to take the
[1:09:27] nature of Christ in my own in my own
[1:09:29] Ministry in my own personal life let me
[1:09:32] be as one who has brought as a lamb to
[1:09:34] the solder as a sheep before his shears
[1:09:36] is done so he opened not his mouth a
[1:09:40] lamb is born without the ability to take
[1:09:41] care of himself even to survive without
[1:09:43] help his nature is to be led he learns
[1:09:45] to follow his master's voice all he has
[1:09:48] is
[1:09:49] wo it's all he has and he gives it up
[1:09:52] willingly he can't make it come and he
[1:09:55] don't stop it from going amen he just
[1:09:57] Bears wall and someone comes and shears
[1:10:00] him and he has no complaint because he
[1:10:03] has complete trust in the shepherd bless
[1:10:06] the lordu I believe that Simon the
[1:10:09] sirene was a
[1:10:10] lamb he he may have been doing other
[1:10:13] things but when he was compelled to
[1:10:15] carry the cross he just followed what
[1:10:17] what God had compelled him to do even
[1:10:20] though it was through the hands of a
[1:10:22] Roman soldier so he was compelled to do
[1:10:25] this to do what needed to be done he
[1:10:27] proved who he was by being obedient to
[1:10:30] God's will so that the work of God could
[1:10:32] go on so the words of God could be
[1:10:34] fulfilled he he might have you know it
[1:10:37] might have been a Wonder to him you know
[1:10:38] as he stood there and he's standing at
[1:10:40] that crossroads he just happened to be
[1:10:42] there at the right place at the right
[1:10:43] time and and he might have stood there
[1:10:45] and he might have said well this is not
[1:10:47] what I had planned I was going to do
[1:10:50] some business I was going down to make
[1:10:52] some money I wonder how many of us have
[1:10:54] stood at that same Crossroads and said
[1:10:56] you know I had plans for my life but God
[1:10:58] interrupted those plans and called me to
[1:11:00] a life of service out of my own desires
[1:11:03] and called me to
[1:11:05] his Simon is carrying that cross he
[1:11:07] might have thought I didn't I didn't
[1:11:08] wake up this morning and think that I'd
[1:11:10] have blood running all over me where his
[1:11:12] Blood Stained The Old Rugged Cross I
[1:11:14] didn't wake up this morning and think
[1:11:16] that I would be following oh God one a
[1:11:18] lamb who was going to the cross I didn't
[1:11:20] wake up this morning and think that I
[1:11:22] would be the one that would have to do
[1:11:24] it but this is my opportunity to do
[1:11:27] something for him oh I wonder tonight if
[1:11:29] we have an opportunity to do something
[1:11:31] for him even if it's just raising our
[1:11:33] hands in church even if it's saying Amen
[1:11:35] to the preacher let me be one who who
[1:11:37] takes my opportunity Hallelujah don't
[1:11:40] leave it for somebody else it's me that
[1:11:42] was at the crossroads it's me that felt
[1:11:44] the power of God it's me that let him
[1:11:46] work in my
[1:11:48] life
[1:11:49] Hallelujah this may not be what I
[1:11:51] intended to do with my life but this is
[1:11:53] what was needed and this is what I'll do
[1:11:57] not my will but thine be
[1:12:01] done what happened to
[1:12:04] Simon that
[1:12:06] intersection of his way and God's way
[1:12:10] changed the trajectory of Simon's life
[1:12:14] are you waking up to listen for just a
[1:12:16] few more
[1:12:18] minutes I know it's Sunday night but
[1:12:21] listen we're all I believe we're
[1:12:23] Christians here tonight you want to hear
[1:12:25] the word of
[1:12:28] God the Bible says they compelled Mark
[1:12:31] 15:21 if you can pull that up they
[1:12:34] compel one Simon a sirenian who passed
[1:12:38] by like he just happened to be
[1:12:41] there like you think you just happened
[1:12:43] to be born in Pony here in this church
[1:12:45] or into your family you just happened to
[1:12:47] be there and they're all preachers so
[1:12:49] you were one anyway but God did that for
[1:12:51] a reason are you with me now you were
[1:12:54] born there for a reason they compelled
[1:12:57] who one who passed by coming out of the
[1:12:59] country listen now what it says it's
[1:13:00] very interesting he said the father of
[1:13:02] Alexander and Rufus to bear his cross
[1:13:07] and Alexander and Rufus I guess were
[1:13:08] like a were like Kobe and and Josh and
[1:13:12] and Caleb Martin you know they were so
[1:13:14] well known around the message of the
[1:13:18] hour that Paul didn't or or Mark rather
[1:13:21] didn't have to explain who they were
[1:13:25] right think about it for a
[1:13:26] minute he said they was the father of
[1:13:28] Alexander and Rufus and and they
[1:13:30] compelled Simon to carry his cross and
[1:13:33] by in in explanation of who Simon was he
[1:13:35] said he was the father of Alexander and
[1:13:37] Rufus they're so well known to the
[1:13:39] Christian Church Mark doesn't have to
[1:13:41] explain who they are you find Rufus
[1:13:42] again in Romans 16:13 and we believe
[1:13:45] it's the same one historians believe the
[1:13:47] same one say salute Rufus chosen in the
[1:13:49] Lord and his mother and mine I'm going
[1:13:51] to challenge you tonight you want to
[1:13:52] change your story of your family you
[1:13:55] want to change you want to break
[1:13:56] generational curses you you want to make
[1:13:59] a difference in your family and the way
[1:14:01] things have been pick up your cross
[1:14:03] it'll make a difference to your children
[1:14:05] it'll make a difference to your
[1:14:06] grandchildren be willing to do the work
[1:14:08] of the Lord and it'll make a difference
[1:14:10] in your life because men like brother
[1:14:12] durren who was here this morning when
[1:14:14] men like that took up their cross be
[1:14:17] bore their cross because he bore his
[1:14:19] cross it makes it that much easier for
[1:14:20] the next generation and the Next
[1:14:22] Generation and the people of God may not
[1:14:24] know his name but they know their
[1:14:27] names he changed his family history now
[1:14:30] let me tell you how radically he changed
[1:14:32] his family history 2,000 years later oh
[1:14:37] God oh God a prophet was praying for a
[1:14:40] blind girl in Jonesboro Arkansas near
[1:14:43] where we live he's praying for a blind
[1:14:46] girl she had you remember the story how
[1:14:48] she had lost her way and she told him if
[1:14:50] I can get to the Healer she said I'll
[1:14:52] find my own Daddy
[1:14:54] and and he saidwell I'm brother brandom
[1:14:56] and he began to talk to her and when he
[1:14:57] got down to pray for her he said
[1:15:00] something interesting which he said
[1:15:01] often if you go look it up on the tape
[1:15:03] he said Lord said this is one of Simon's
[1:15:07] children and basically brother brandham
[1:15:10] over and over again when he met when he
[1:15:11] prayed for an African person he'd pray
[1:15:13] for them or an African-American person
[1:15:15] he would pray for them and say this is
[1:15:17] one of Simon's
[1:15:19] children amen he was reminding God and
[1:15:23] he would do that he'd say Lord you
[1:15:24] remember what Simon did for you 2,000
[1:15:29] years later Simon's family was still
[1:15:31] receiving the benefits and a little
[1:15:33] blind girl's eyes came open because
[1:15:35] Simon picked up his cross and a prophet
[1:15:37] grabs a hold of inspiration and says
[1:15:40] Simon picked up his cross would you heal
[1:15:42] her
[1:15:44] eyes you think it don't make a
[1:15:46] difference what you do in the church you
[1:15:48] think it don't make a difference how
[1:15:49] when you come and pray you think it
[1:15:50] don't make a difference whether you're
[1:15:52] there on Sunday night or not because you
[1:15:53] picked up your cross today if the Lord
[1:15:55] carries many years down the road there
[1:15:58] will be something that'll come out of
[1:16:00] thatl something good you want to break
[1:16:03] your family curse you want to get out of
[1:16:05] that that rut pick up your
[1:16:13] cross you
[1:16:19] never sorry a little bit of a baby I
[1:16:22] went to Africa
[1:16:24] twice once
[1:16:26] about six years ago I think and once
[1:16:30] this
[1:16:32] spring or last spring
[1:16:35] Easter when I was there before the very
[1:16:38] first thing I ever did in Africa they we
[1:16:40] arrived on Saturday night and on Sunday
[1:16:43] morning I went to preach in a church by
[1:16:46] myself and they took me to a pastor Bene
[1:16:49] there in L Togo and and I was there in
[1:16:52] his church and I preached this message
[1:16:54] in that church and I'll never forget
[1:16:57] that because at the beginning before I
[1:16:58] come to preach you know how they'll do
[1:16:59] they'll bring their babies to be
[1:17:00] dedicated and they brought up one baby
[1:17:02] to be dedicated and I dedicated and they
[1:17:04] brought up another one this baby had a
[1:17:06] cliff
[1:17:07] lip and I just for Kobe I just was hard
[1:17:10] for me to take because I knew I'd read
[1:17:12] up on Togo and I knew they didn't have
[1:17:14] any doctors hardly their their Hospital
[1:17:16] their one hospitals known as the morg
[1:17:19] and so it's a place where they just go
[1:17:20] to die and I knew this baby didn't have
[1:17:22] any Chan growing up to be normal and I
[1:17:24] thought for a brief moment what if I
[1:17:26] could take it home with me I don't have
[1:17:27] a way of doing it I don't have the money
[1:17:29] to care for it oh I wish I could do
[1:17:31] something for it and the only thing I
[1:17:33] could think to do because I was about to
[1:17:35] preach this sermon is I I thought Lord
[1:17:37] and I prayed out I said Lord this is one
[1:17:40] of Simon's
[1:17:42] children this is one of Simon's children
[1:17:46] well would you just take Simon's you
[1:17:48] remember what he did for you and I just
[1:17:49] prayed like brother brandham did because
[1:17:51] I knew he had prayed that way and and
[1:17:53] and and we give it back to the mother
[1:17:55] and I go back five years
[1:17:57] later and and it so struck my heart I've
[1:17:59] got a picture of myself with that baby
[1:18:01] with that Cliff lip baby it so struck my
[1:18:03] heart that I I went back five years
[1:18:06] later and I asked the pastor through an
[1:18:07] interpreter I said what you know what
[1:18:10] happened to that baby I'd like to know I
[1:18:13] was almost afraid to ask I said I'd like
[1:18:15] to know and when he was translated to
[1:18:17] him a big smile covered his face and he
[1:18:19] said they translated it back to me he
[1:18:21] said he's completely well
[1:18:26] hallah he's completely well I believe
[1:18:29] God still does that and I don't know
[1:18:32] what happened brother W in between time
[1:18:34] I don't know if he made it to a doctor I
[1:18:35] don't know if it supernaturally he was
[1:18:37] just completely healed at that moment
[1:18:38] but by the time five years later arrived
[1:18:40] he was completely implausibly without I
[1:18:43] thought any hope of getting better and
[1:18:45] he was better let me tell you tonight
[1:18:47] what was it God honoring his word
[1:18:49] because Simon picked up his cross 2,000
[1:18:51] years ago God was still honoring that
[1:18:53] family don't you know God will honor
[1:18:55] your family as well don't be weary and
[1:18:57] wello don't give up because people don't
[1:19:00] look at you and say well there's
[1:19:01] something big but realize that God is
[1:19:03] doing something he's working in your
[1:19:05] life pick up your cross and there'll be
[1:19:07] lasting
[1:19:08] success not momentary
[1:19:11] Fame cu the cross doesn't look like
[1:19:14] success but it
[1:19:17] is and I feel like and I know that you
[1:19:20] do as well I feel like when Jesus said
[1:19:22] in Luke 17:10 he's instructing his
[1:19:24] disciples he says when you've done all
[1:19:27] those things which are commanded you
[1:19:29] heal the
[1:19:31] sick cast out Devils when you've done
[1:19:34] all those things which are commanded you
[1:19:37] say we are
[1:19:39] unprofitable
[1:19:41] servants we have done that which was our
[1:19:44] duty to
[1:19:46] do that's all I can do just let me do
[1:19:50] what you called me to do let me do I've
[1:19:51] been compelled to do it it but I'll do
[1:19:54] it with all of my
[1:19:55] heart you see I cannot do for him what
[1:19:58] he did for me David says that in the
[1:19:59] Psalms he says I can't repay all the
[1:20:01] goodness that he's given me he said but
[1:20:03] I'll pay my vows in the midst of the
[1:20:04] congregation and he says this he said I
[1:20:06] will take the cup and I preach that in
[1:20:09] communion services that that was it was
[1:20:11] a way we can't do anything to uh we
[1:20:14] cannot die for our own sins he already
[1:20:15] did that but we can take the cup we can
[1:20:17] Fellowship together we can worship
[1:20:19] together we can take communion we can do
[1:20:21] our part to carry
[1:20:23] the
[1:20:26] cross closing here in just a moment the
[1:20:30] Bible tells us if we suffer with him we
[1:20:32] shall also reign with him if we deny him
[1:20:35] he will deny us all of us have something
[1:20:38] to do brother brandham did what he was
[1:20:39] born to do brother brandham says this in
[1:20:43] the token he said just what I've seen in
[1:20:45] my own Ministry seen him done you
[1:20:47] couldn't pile the volumes on this
[1:20:49] platform here he said if I wrote it in
[1:20:50] details what I seen him just do in my
[1:20:52] own Ministry he said he had more success
[1:20:55] in my Ministry than he did in his own
[1:20:57] now look at his attitude he said no now
[1:20:59] remember he had more success now not me
[1:21:02] he had he said he had more success in
[1:21:04] Jeffersonville than he did in Nazareth
[1:21:07] in that Wicked City in this wicked City
[1:21:09] CU he could for could perform no
[1:21:11] Miracles there but he did here he
[1:21:13] finally broke through here he got it
[1:21:14] done here he might have had to get
[1:21:16] people somewhere else but he got it done
[1:21:18] anyhow he said he had more success right
[1:21:21] here than he did in capernium or
[1:21:22] Nazareth in that he said he done more
[1:21:24] miracles right here in this Tabernacle
[1:21:26] than he did in his entire Ministry on
[1:21:28] Earth he said that's right he did it now
[1:21:30] what about the rest of the world he said
[1:21:32] Oh my he said no that's what he done he
[1:21:34] said now remember he done now listen to
[1:21:37] the secret you want to know the secret
[1:21:38] to a prophet's Ministry listen to what
[1:21:40] he says he said remember he done he said
[1:21:43] now never said I done it cuz I didn't do
[1:21:45] it he said I just I just loved
[1:21:51] him I I just loved him and said what he
[1:21:55] said and the Holy Spirit went to the
[1:21:57] other people and they believed what he
[1:21:59] said and then he done the work what a
[1:22:02] great description of ministry what a
[1:22:04] great description of picking up your
[1:22:05] cross aren't you glad a prophet of God
[1:22:07] took up his cross and follow Jesus
[1:22:09] aren't you glad you can do the same
[1:22:11] thing he said I just loved him and
[1:22:13] submitted myself to him and the Holy
[1:22:15] Spirit went to the other people and they
[1:22:16] believe what he said and he done the
[1:22:19] work what did it take to get his life to
[1:22:22] that Point musicians go ahead and come
[1:22:26] if you
[1:22:27] will look at his attitude at the end of
[1:22:31] a life story you forgive me if you've
[1:22:33] heard me say this before but it just
[1:22:35] means so much to
[1:22:37] me brother brandham goes through and he
[1:22:39] talks about his wife that he lost and
[1:22:42] his baby and all those things and he
[1:22:43] just broke him up and he was
[1:22:44] tender-hearted we don't want to get
[1:22:46] bitter when we go through things get
[1:22:48] hard I want to stay
[1:22:51] tender brother Brown says he got to a
[1:22:53] place he can't preach no more he said I
[1:22:54] just can't do it anymore he said oh God
[1:22:57] have
[1:22:58] mercy I just think back across the
[1:23:00] streaks of tears and heartaches and
[1:23:03] troubles said oh Father and I'm ashamed
[1:23:06] of all of my
[1:23:07] life why didn't I know you
[1:23:11] before he said I've tried with all my
[1:23:13] heart dear Jesus to live for you wonder
[1:23:18] if we could say that
[1:23:19] tonight he said to do the thing and I
[1:23:23] just love the way he puts it he said
[1:23:25] I've tried to do the
[1:23:27] thing and he had his thing to do you
[1:23:30] have your thing to do but it's to do
[1:23:32] what you're called to do to do the thing
[1:23:34] he said no matter what this cross is or
[1:23:37] how scornful it seems to
[1:23:39] be and he says
[1:23:42] this he said I love you dear
[1:23:45] Jesus you've broken my heart over and
[1:23:49] over but I love you for it
[1:23:57] I want to stand here today I'm not
[1:23:58] trying to be a prophet or trying to be
[1:24:00] what he was but I can say in the short
[1:24:02] time that I've been alive that I've had
[1:24:04] my heart broken over and over again but
[1:24:06] I want to stand here and say with the
[1:24:07] prophet of God I love you for
[1:24:10] it I love you dear
[1:24:14] Jesus I wouldn't trade it for
[1:24:17] anything this is my life story when pick
[1:24:22] up my
[1:24:23] cross and follow
[1:24:27] him there was a woman brother Bram tells
[1:24:30] about with a drunk husband a husband who
[1:24:32] was a
[1:24:33] drunk and the husband went down to the
[1:24:37] bar and he was talking to his fellows
[1:24:39] and they said there is no real
[1:24:40] Christians they're all just a bunch of
[1:24:42] fakes he said but I know one they said
[1:24:46] prove it to us he said I will so they go
[1:24:49] down to his house and they come in act
[1:24:51] like they're all drunk and they go
[1:24:52] inside the house and they and they just
[1:24:55] make a big mess and the woman fix me
[1:24:57] something to eat and she makes him some
[1:24:59] eggs and he brings them in there and he
[1:25:02] takes them he throws them on the floor
[1:25:03] he said you know I don't want my eggs
[1:25:05] like
[1:25:10] that and she said okay dear I'll make
[1:25:14] you some more he said oh I don't want
[1:25:15] anymore he walked outside with his
[1:25:17] friends went out on the
[1:25:19] porch and
[1:25:21] the
[1:25:23] they're sitting there on the porch and
[1:25:25] she's trying to clean up after the mess
[1:25:27] he made when he threw his dish down on
[1:25:29] the floor and clean up the eggs and the
[1:25:31] dishes and she's sniffing like that
[1:25:34] she's trying not to
[1:25:37] cry brother B since she begin to sing
[1:25:39] the song must Jesus bear the cross
[1:25:42] alone and all the world go free no
[1:25:46] there's a cross for
[1:25:48] everyone and there's a cross for me
[1:25:53] he said this consecrated cross I'll bear
[1:25:55] Till Death Shall Set Me Free and then go
[1:25:58] home my crown to wear for there is a
[1:26:00] crown for
[1:26:02] me he told his friends he said see there
[1:26:05] is a real Christian and those men gave
[1:26:07] their heart to the
[1:26:09] Lord song goes on to say oh precious
[1:26:12] cross oh glorious Crown oh Resurrection
[1:26:16] Day when Christ the Lord From Heaven
[1:26:18] comes down and bears my soul away you
[1:26:22] know when that song was written it was
[1:26:24] originally written differently than must
[1:26:27] Jesus bear the cross alone they the
[1:26:29] Publishers changed it but the original
[1:26:31] author wrote it like this must Simon
[1:26:34] bear the cross
[1:26:35] alone and other Saints be free each
[1:26:40] saint of thine shall find his own there
[1:26:43] is one for me would you bow your heads
[1:26:45] with
[1:26:51] me
[1:26:53] I know it's solemn and maybe a quiet
[1:26:56] moment I can't be everybody else I'm
[1:26:59] just who I am this is just who I am and
[1:27:01] I but I'll say this I I found great
[1:27:04] strength in moments of
[1:27:07] quietness when we just know that the
[1:27:09] presence of God is
[1:27:12] here there is a cross for everyone and
[1:27:15] there's a cross for me I don't know what
[1:27:17] that cross is today but will you will
[1:27:20] you pick it up you see the body of
[1:27:23] Christ as we whether you realize your
[1:27:24] your husband your wife they're a part of
[1:27:26] the body of Christ
[1:27:28] today this church our church back in
[1:27:32] Hardy the churches everywhere I'm so
[1:27:35] glad that other churches took an
[1:27:37] interest in other pastors have taken an
[1:27:39] interest in in my life and helped me and
[1:27:42] I want to thank them for doing that they
[1:27:44] didn't realize it but they were picking
[1:27:45] up their cross when the body of Christ
[1:27:47] was weak and it just didn't seem like he
[1:27:49] could go another day I don't know about
[1:27:50] you but sometimes serving God Mondays
[1:27:52] are
[1:27:54] hard and sometimes you feel like you
[1:27:56] just you just thought I've resigned so
[1:27:58] many times on Mondays and I know every
[1:27:59] Pastor has and you feel like you just
[1:28:02] can't go another way but every once
[1:28:03] another day but every once in a while
[1:28:05] I'll get a text from somebody or a note
[1:28:08] or a little kid will write something say
[1:28:10] pastor we love you just thinking about
[1:28:12] you today I want to tell you want to
[1:28:14] tell you that you're to keep keep
[1:28:16] pressing battle what did the Saints say
[1:28:19] to brother Brandon when he looked beyond
[1:28:20] the curtain of time they told him before
[1:28:22] left they said keep pressing
[1:28:25] on keep pressing on is what I want to
[1:28:27] say to you tonight keep pressing on but
[1:28:30] I wonder if you've had opportunity to to
[1:28:32] pick up the body of Christ when it was
[1:28:34] weak to help it along to do the work
[1:28:37] that maybe someone else was doing but to
[1:28:40] do it because you realize they just
[1:28:42] can't carry it
[1:28:44] anymore if you have that opportunity
[1:28:46] just take
[1:28:47] it just take it walk with Jesus be like
[1:28:52] Simon carry his cross you could I could
[1:28:55] never be Jesus but let me carry the
[1:28:58] cross let me carry the cross let me do
[1:29:02] my part and everything will be okay
[1:29:05] could you pray that way with me oh God
[1:29:07] help me to do my part to carry my cross
[1:29:10] Heavenly
[1:29:11] Father Lord this is my desire
[1:29:14] tonight I want to carry the
[1:29:16] cross Lord this consecrated cross I'll
[1:29:19] bear I want to do that I want to keep
[1:29:21] doing that let me not to lose sight of
[1:29:23] it
[1:29:24] Lord success sometimes blinds us from
[1:29:27] from who we really ought to be and I
[1:29:30] pray God that you would help us to be
[1:29:33] who you who you want us to be to carry
[1:29:36] our
[1:29:37] cross to be compelled by your spirit
[1:29:41] compelled by Your Word by the fire
[1:29:43] that's raging within us of the Holy
[1:29:45] Ghost to go out and do the thing whether
[1:29:50] that's picking up trash or
[1:29:52] helping Park cars or helping the pastor
[1:29:55] in some way so he can do other work or
[1:29:58] just being in the house of God
[1:30:01] Faithfully let me carry my cross Lord
[1:30:04] nobody said it would be easy but you did
[1:30:07] so much for me help me to do my part for
[1:30:10] you Lord may we be reminded I know
[1:30:12] there's nothing new tonight may we be
[1:30:14] reminded of it reminded by it Lord to do
[1:30:18] our work and believe that there's a
