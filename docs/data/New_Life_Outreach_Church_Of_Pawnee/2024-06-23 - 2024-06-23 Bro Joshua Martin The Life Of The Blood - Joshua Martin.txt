other day amen this great battle between God and Satan amen and somebody put on the WhatsApp about uh the soul of man must be quite uh worth a lot because Satan's doing all he can to destroy it and

God or what you see what do you believe how many's going to take the word of God this morning oh set your wings to The Winds of Faith you can fly in a higher Place do not struggle it's by Grace set your wings to The Winds of Faith what your [Music] need and watch your cry watch your Mountain there's some mountains this morning may to be brought down speak the word of God and by and by it will move maybe just one grain of sand at a time w set your wings to The Winds of Faith all things are possible you can fly in a [Music] higher set your wings to the winds can we sing that again again now oh set your wings to The Winds of Faith you can fly your place do not struggle it's by Grace set your wings to the wind of fi do not struggle it's by Grace set your wings to The Winds of fa amen you're thankful for that this morning no need to struggle we have to fight we have to press but we don't have to struggle and that's a promise that we have we've we've got such a message in this hour that has lifted us up you know brother Brandon I've been listening to the token and he would say we haven't come here to talk about it we've come here to get underneath it you know so we've got something we're grabbing we're applying it and it's picking us up oh my and it's carrying us all the way the wind that that the eagle needed was already in the sky all he had to do was relax and I say Lord help us to relax In The Presence of Jehovah and he would carry us all the way through amen if you have your Bibles this morning let's open our scriptures to Matthew 26 and 26 have a simple subject this morning but I pray you can be edifying and strengthen and encourage this morning you happen to be in the house of the Lord amen amen if you come to hear from the Lord this morning not from from a man if you come expecting to hear from a man you're going to be disappointed so and that's what's so incredible about the right expectation it don't matter who's preaching as long as we're expecting to hear from God God can meet the needs amen Matthew 26 and 26 the Bible says as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body he and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many the remission of sins amen can we bow our heads this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father father Lord we're humbled by your presence this morning Father Lord as we felt you Lord come down and settle Among Us Lord I I I felt you as soon as I walked into the office this morning Lord as Sister Amy was singing Lord God I believe this is a special service Lord I don't believe any of us are here by accident father but Lord you pre-ordained us to be here father and you you pre-ordained a word to come this morning Lord to speak to the hearts and speak to the needs Lord God as a man we can only do so much father we can study and prepare Lord but it's only you that can speak to the needs Lord and break the yolks father Lord as we come to this part of the service Lord I lay myself aside father I surrender to you Lord and I ask that you would speak this morning Father I ask that you would anoint the congregation father may they get themselves aside as well Lord and receive what you have for them Father we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated this morning and if I had a subject I would like to speak on the life of the blood and brother brandom would tell us that we live off of dead substance he says naturally he says what we eat if you're going to eat of anything it's got to be dead you know and he says if you eat a hamburger the cow how to die if you eat bacon in the morning the pig how to die you know it says whatever you eat of and he says even the vegetarians it says if you eat a vegetable the vegetable had to die or the or if you drink milk the bacteria had to die he says we live off of dead dead substance and he says if we live naturally off of dead de substance we got to live now spiritually off of dead substance as well and he and through the Old Testament they we would see that they would come to the Tabernacle and they would slay a lamb and that lamb the blood of that lamb would sprinkle on them pour on them and it would cover them but there was no separation and even though they were forgiven there was no separation the Bible would tell us I believe in Leviticus that the blood would forgive but there was no separation there was no remission and so we see that whenever they would come and slay a lamb maybe if you if they had told a lie they would slay a lamb of the of the bull or the goat in that lamb the blood of it would pour upon them and it would forgive the lie but they would leave with the same desire to tell a lie and so it was a cycle of a lie a lie a lie they would be forgiven but there was no separation but we see here in Hebrews 10:1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make comers there un to perfect but whenever Christ come he didn't just forgive he brought a remission and the word remission means to be separated released from prison or from bondage so when the blood of Christ come it didn't just forgive the worshipper but it would separate the worshipper whenever it would leave whenever you would leave the cross or whenever you would you would leave a church service you would go with a different desire you wouldn't be coming to church out of a cycle Lord forgive me for telling a lie Lord forgive me for doing this Lord forgive me for doing that cuz the Lord would forgive but we want to go from forgiveness to a remission and that's what the blood of Christ has done to us it has brought a remission a separation the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 10 and 17 and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more that's not just forgiveness that's a remission that's separated so when God looks at you he don't see sins he don't see failures he don't see mistakes when he look looks at you he sees the blood and brother Brandon would tell us that he don't even see you all he hears is your voice he says when he looks at you all he sees as your representation which is the blood and I think that is so incredible that we're represented by somebody perfect when we wasn't able to achieve Perfection when we wasn't able to get past our mistakes get past our failures there was a blood that would represent us and that would remove us and separate us from our mistakes and brother Brandon would tell us consider this since it is the blood of God it is a perfect blood and the perfect blood is loosening us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosening is perfect and complete there was now no therefore there was now therefore no condemnation who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect is a God that justifieth declares us righteous who is he that condemneth is a Christ that died there it is he gave us the blood and the blood has loosed us and there was now no condemnation How can there be there was nothing to condemn for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free Guiltless don't listen to the man listen to the word you were loosed by the blood and I say we can put that more than just a man don't listen to condemnation don't listen to complexes don't listen to other voices that says you're not separated but listen to the blood that says you were loosed a perfect loosening and we see that since the blood is is perfect we are perfect and I now I'm no longer known by my own nature but the man I used to be has taken has taken play has been separated and there's a new man that has come on the inside and I like how the Bible would put it in Hebrews 10:2 for then when they have not ceased to be offered because that the worshipper once purged should not should have no Cal more conscience of sins and so it's no longer a cycle but once you are purged the conscience of sin is you see the conscience of sin wasn't gone under the blood of bulls and goats but once the blood of Christ come the conscience of it was gone the desire of it was gone and so we see that it wasn't the literal blood of Jesus but the life of the blood that would bring the remission because if you fail to see the life of the blood all you have is a for because if it's the natural blood of Jesus that you're looking for it's not here we don't got the natural blood of Jesus but we do got the life of the blood which is the Holy Ghost and you see that's what I love about the message is it's brought us out of a form of Creeds and ideas and traditions and has brought us into a reality and we're not we're thankful for the cross but what did the cross do for me I'm thankful for the blood but what did the blood do for me and the message will let us know that the cross is more than a crucifix the blood is more than just a chemical but the cross and the blood is was the releasing of God and brother Brandon would tell us whenever he was on the cross the blood shell when it was broke it released God and so the blood is more than just a chemical but it's the life it's deity coming inside of humanity to bring a separation where we have no more conscience of sin where we can come the church out of a pure mind knowing that I'm not going to come next week asking for forgiveness of the same things of last week but there's a separation there's a Deliverance there's a liberty that was taking place place and we would see brother brandom he would tell us that God would show his longsuffering and kindness to pharaoh and to the people of Egypt and and in in the token he would say that that it was his it was God's longsuffering to pharaoh and he sent a prophet he would show him the signs he would show him the pillar of fire you see behind the signs was a message and the message was let my people go but you see brother the Brandon would say they would not repent they ignored all of his signs ignored his prophet and his message so now God was making a separation and what would make the separation was the token and we would see that God would require a lamb to be slain and he didn't say put the lamb above above the doorpost he said put the blood above the doorpost in other words you can listen to the message but you got to get the life of the message you we're not going to be raptured because of a tape player we're being raptured because there's a life that has been brought and brother Brandon would tell us that if you didn't apply the life of it if you didn't reply the blood then you was not you was not under the token and brother Brandon would tell us that's what he's requiring that night to separate the Believers from the believer or the unbelievers from the believer the believer the worshipper was identified with the sacrifice he must apply the blood it wasn't and take the lamb and set the blood out there somewhere or keep it in a charger or take it down to the neighbors he had to apply the blood and we see that whenever the Judgment would be passing would be passing through the city they would be hearing the screams of this one dying of that one dying they could rest assured that there was a separation that had separated them there was a remission a separation from the Judgment that even though there was a judgment coming by their house they could rest assure that none of the spirits none of the plagues that was coming against the city would come against them cuz we know the plagues of Egypt eypt was not for the Israelites it was for the Egyptians and the same thing today we've had 200,000,000 demons that has been lifted out has been brought in this generation but we see that it's not for you it's for the world the evil spirits that is plaguing the minds plaguing the world plaguing the hearts is not for you but it's for the world but what separates you from the world and from the judgment is there's a life behind the blood that has brought us separation and brother brand will tell us that the token today is the Holy Ghost and we see that the blood will do no good for you unless it is applied and we would see that they would have to apply the blood with hisp and brother Brandon would say the hisp wasn't anything special it was just common weeds that was that that was around that area so they would take that his up that plain thing and would apply the blood and brother Brandon would say you was symbolizing that it's faith that applies the blood today it's not something it's not something uh something big it's something common and no my we're living in the day where the world is looking for something big to bring certainty they think a new president will help or or more money will help or this here is going to help and they fail to realize that right among them there's a common faith that has been restored in this generation that we can apply the token and it will separate us from the Judgment that is coming upon the Earth and we would see that that it's faith that would apply the token so while the world is fearing we're living in a peace while the world is panicking we have a sound of mind it's something so common but it's brought us separation and brother Brandon would preach the token and would tell us that the ticket is the price that has been prid that has been paid he would talk about the box car or if you if you would fly or whatever it is you can't bring the money to the ticket or to the to the uh to the gates you had to bring the token and you know and whenever you would fly you get to show them your ticket I don't know if any how many's ever has flown before but that proves that the price is paid and so first you before you can get the token there's got to be a purchase made for the token but once it's purchased then you got to go and check in you know I don't know how many's ever flown before you know before you ever go to the airport you buy a ticket right and then you get to the airport you don't go to security you don't go to you don't go to your gate you go to the counter and you apply the purchase right you go and you check in and say hey I'm Josh Martin there's a purchase ticket for me and now I'm wanting the token and you see that's what it is when you apply the Holy Ghost the blood has purchased your separation but you got to apply it somebody's got to go and identify it and say hey it's been bought for me but I want to identify it but you notice that after after you check in and you get your token now you're eligible to go through security you're eligible to go through customs you're eligible to go through all of the next steps because you are identified with the purchase and the Holy Ghost makes you eligible for the supernatural you see brother Brandon will tell us you're not even off first base without the Holy Ghost but once you get the Holy Ghost it identifies you with everything that the blood has purchased for you oh my you see this message has let us know that the blood has brought our Redemption it has brought salvation it has brought a sound of mind it's paid the price for deliverance it's paid the price for lost loved ones but the Holy Ghost identifies you and lets you know what the blood bot is yours it's not for your neighbor it's not for so and so but this purchase is for you and then that put you in a position and brother Brandon would tell us that whenever you go and pray he says put the token before you he says when you would go and pray Shake That token before the devil and you can't keep me from it because he may battle your mind he may battle your body he may battle you but there's one thing he cannot take away that is the identification of the token and you see that Egypt the literal blood of the Lamb was the token but brother Brandon would say that the chemical blood of Jesus is not the token it is the Holy Ghost and he would tell us that there's a difference between the blood and the life and it's pretty incredible because he would tell us that the life life would come and create a blood cell and that blood cell would create another cell it would create another cell in the womb of Mary and then there would come Jesus he says it was the man Jesus Christ which was God and he says but whenever he was on the cross he says the chemical blood went back to its natural elements he went back it went to the ground maybe Jesus ate some ate some weed or ate some ate some fruit and he says the blood went back to the natural elements but the life went to the church and so we don't got the natural blood of Jesus but we got the literal life of Jesus brother Brandon would tell us he says if we if I had a charger of two drops of the blood of Jesus he says oh how I would walk so humbly I would walk walk so carefully because I have the literal blood of Jesus but he says now I'm standing before the purchased of the blood of Jesus and he says that is greater than the literal blood oh my if you ever realize what the blood has done for you the blood has broke the has him and has created a highway where you can come back to the come back to the throne of God and come on talking terms and say Satan get out of my family get out of my mind get out of my marriage you see it's somebody that knows who they are their identification has identified them with what the blood has purchased oh my brother the Brandon would say and being man and God being manifested in the flesh with Jesus Jesus the anointed WRA himself in a blood cell oh my in the womb of Mary brought forth his life he lived and he lived a man he died a man to give us blood and though his body and the shedding and through his body and the shedding of his blood that every believer could be wrapped in that blood shell with him which if which if a man a born again Spirit of a man is wrapped in the blood shell of the Son of God God can no more deny you than he can deny himself for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and become partakers of The Same Spirit that's in that blood cell and the church is wrapped into the blood cell of the life of Jesus Christ oh I like how we put that not just the blood cell but the blood cell of the life of Jesus Christ and other words just that Christ was perfect in this blood cell the life of this blood cell you are perfect there's a separation where there's not even a condemnation that can come against your mind if the blood is applied you see too many people fail to apply the blood which is the Holy Ghost and they're trying to be a good Christian they're trying to live a good life they're trying to be an overcomer but all you have to do is apply the blood and that brings uing and you get into this blood cell with Jesus Christ and you are therefore perfect even as our father in Heaven is perfect how can we be perfect with a Josh in a day where there's lesbians there's homosexuals there's pornography there's drugs there's alcohol where living in a day where the blood brother Brandon would say the token couldn't even be applied till the evening time we're living in the day brother Brandon would tell us that the Holy Ghost was bared by denominational Rivers right for 2,000 years but is to be loosed by an evening time message so we're living in the day where all of Heaven has been poured out to the believer that even though the we're in sat and heeden there's another life that is on the inside of the believer that can defy every obstacle that can defy every spirit that speaks against you oh my we've been made eligible with the Supernatural and so it's the token that connects you with the purchase and brother Brandon would say listen close while I make these closing remarks if Satan tries to tries to hand you some of his stuff like sickness you know what to do just show him the token and say I'm a purchased product my healing has been paid for I'm a product of God because I have a token the Holy Ghost you cannot keep me off of this highway you cannot keep me from my health I present the token and show you that by his stripes I was healed here is the resurrection of Jesus Christ right in me now to prove to you oh there is a real thing there is the token oh I like how he says that there is a real thing there is a token while the church has something in their imagination they've got Sensations they've got goosebumps they've got all these other things there is a real thing that the bride of Christ has it is the literal life on the inside of them that is brought a separation oh hallelujah it's bright of Separation while the world is in cycle the church members in a cycle there's been a separation that has called you out of the cycle and has placed you upon a highway that has taken you all the way to the Rapture you know what the Brandon would say that Enoch when he got up that last morning he didn't take his regular path He Walked on God's Highway oh my what is zoch he is your type that is the same Highway that you were walking on today and you can't beat your type if this highway LED Enoch all the way to his Rapture want about you today we're walking on the same Highway where there's no spirits that can condemn you there's no voices of the enemy that can pull you down we're walking on the King's Highway that has taken us all the way to the coming of the Lord oh Hallelujah I'm purchased that means your health is purchased and the Bible would tell us in Proverbs 16 and 17 the highway of the upright is to depart from Evil and he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul oh my the way the highway of the upright is to depart in other words it's to separate there's a remission so on this on this highway the only ones that can walk on it is the ones that is separated from the voice of the enemy enemy is the one that is separated and under the remission of their sins oh my but brand would say that's the way real Christianity is a living experience Pentecost is not a denomination Pentecost is an experience that anybody can have if they wish to have it's something you can experience the Holy Spirit oh my Christianity is more than reading the Bible it's more than praying a prayer it's more than saying Hell mares it's more than just listening to a tape Christian chity is a living experience and he says you can have it if you want it oh too many times we are we're so we're so full on the things of the world that we don't got no appetite for the Holy Ghost we're so full on Theology and man's ideas that we've got no appetite for the Holy Ghost but there's a real living experience that can come and change the nature of a young boy that can change the nature of an adult that can change the nature and bring a separation oh my you may say Josh I've been in this message 50 years maybe you've got the Holy Ghost but you've allowed some things to come back in your life you need a separation we're never too old for a refilling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm preaching now we're never too old we're never in this message too long to get a renewing we never we never know too much to get a renewing oh Hallelujah it don't matter how much we know how much we learn we still need to be separated from the things that the world becomes inside of our mind mind comes inside of our body you see what the brand was said the Bible said he ascended on high and gave gifts unto men there was an atmosphere that hung over the Earth of Darkness of Gloom and of death and and of weariness the prayers couldn't come up because the atonement wasn't made but he broke through the veil he opened up the way he broke the veil of sickness he broke the veil of sin he broke the veil of weariness he broke the veil of depression he broke every Veil and made a highway for the wayfaring Men Walking Up The King's Highway oh you know what that means that the blood is more than just something in our imagination the blood is your deliverance the blood is your rapture the blood is your sanctification the blood is the freedom from condemnation he broke every Veil and put a highway into existence that would go over the CM you know brother the Brandon would tell us that when man fell from the be in the beginning that there was a Chasm that kept man from God and so this highway that the blood purchased it goes over the chasm where you can walk back to the throne of God with boldness that we can come before the presence of God and say Lord I'm having problems in my marriage I'm having problems with my teenagers I'm having problems and the blood has identified you that your prayers ain't being stopped by condemnation your prayers ain't being stopped by a by a broken Spirit your prayers ain't being stopped by complexes but every veil has been rined and that prayer take you straight to the throne room of God where you can speak to Papa God and he speaks back to you oh that's what we need today is somebody that is on talking terms with Papa God that can get into a prayer closet somewhere and say Lord I'm getting past the pressure I'm getting past the Mind battles I'm getting past these things I'm I'm going to apply the blood over my children I'm applying the blood over my household I'm applying the blood it's somebody that is on talking terms but we see that the token identified you with the Redemptive rights of calary and whether the Brandon would say many people don't believe this is because the token hasn't been applied and he would say this here uhh he would say uh uh uh and he says uh you cannot keep me from my health I present the token and show you by your stripes I was healed here is the resurrection of Jesus Christ right in me to prove to you oh there was a real thing there is the token that's the reason people don't believe it that's the reason it's hard for them to see it the token has never been applied so that is the reason they say all the days of Miracles is passed and so that's the reason we fail to see the supernatural many times is we fail to be identified with what the Supernatural is and you see you know I went to England uh a couple years ago and uh we had a layover in Paris and you know and it was AG ating because we had a ticket me and brother Andrew had a ticket that had brought us this far into the journey it had brought us through the Customs it brought us through security it brought it has brought us all the way it brought us to our gate you know and I guess there in Paris they don't like Americans and I man they were so rude to us you know and so we get there to our gate there they got the boarding calls you know me and brother Andrew get up to the gate and we give him a ticket they said no you don't got a ticket and we said yeah we got a ticket right here they said no you don't got one we said we got a ticket right here they said no you don't got one next and here they canceled our ticket here we got a purchased product we have the token showing that the purchase was made and now I'm identified to get on that plane but what they done was they had cancelled my token and now they expected me to get to my destination with help of token and oh my too many times we get wet blankets in the house of God that is trying to cancel the Holy Ghost and they expect their children to be saved they expect their teenagers to get filled with the Holy Ghost and they set there trying to cancel and bind up the Holy Ghost but let me say this if you loose the Holy Ghost and actually get into a service and say Lord move for my children move for my loved ones move for my daughter move for my son you might actually see a Revival but too many people oh my I'm just preaching this morning too many people is so stuck up in their ways that they fa to release the Holy Ghost to bring a Revival let me say this the Holy Ghost will f a fix a broken heart the Holy Ghost will fix marriages the Holy Ghost will save a rebellious teenager but you got to let it go you you got to let the Holy Ghost loose in your house in your marriage in your bedroom in your life in your music in your movies whatever it is release the Holy Ghost and say Lord have a way in my life oh Hallelujah but you know what we had to do or our flight flew off our plane flew off but brother Andrew we had a we we booked our tickets through Delta so he called Delta and say hey this is what this is what's going on and then they would book us another flight you see there's a representative that is connecting us even though we was in a foreign country there was somebody that was connecting us from our homeland and to where we was and little church you may have got dry you may have your fire May has went out there is still a representative there is still the blood that has crying got name and saying if you want to refill him if you want to renew him there is something that is connecting you with your Homeland to where you are at now oh Hallelujah I say that's what new life Outreach needs is somebody to get hungry for the things of God and say Lord give me a fresh Revival give me a fresh renewing we know what it was like oh come on now we know what it was like to be in Revival and we were press through mind battles we were press through heartaches it didn't matter what we went through we was hungry for the supernatural I said Lord make new life Outreach like that again that it don't matter what I went through yesterday I want to see the supernatural I want to see a Revival I want to see this youth group on fire with the things of God I want to see my children not in sports not in not in television I want to see my children on fire with the things of God it takes somebody releasing oh come on now you can try to bind up the service but the Holy Ghost is going to have its way this morning I say let loose and let the Holy Ghost move among young people let the Holy Ghost fix broken marriages let the Holy Ghost move it's the Supernatural come on now it's the supernatural too many people are scared that they're going to have to love their neighbor they're scared that they're going to have to forgive their neighbor but I say let loose let loose and let the Holy Ghost make you love again let the Holy Ghost make you look at your neighbor again oh Hallelujah you see whenever I was uh I was working on my house and you know I hate tile work you know and here I was working on my tile and here I was grouting my ti you know I got it all grouted and it come to the phase where had to clean up the grout and I'm sure I'm sure stamy knows what I'm talking about I had my bucket of water I had my sponge you know I was cleaning up my towel you know I was going at it and I look and the to's still dirty and I thought my goodness I would go over it again I'm wiping it down with my sponge and I was getting mad at my sponge because I thought M I'm dipping it in the water I'm cleaning it up dipping it in the water and yet the sponge is still producing dirty water and you know something hit me as I was going outside it wasn't the sponge's fault I was putting it in an environment that it was just soaking up oh come on Church you can't blame your children if they get rebellious if you're putting them in an environment that they're soaking up bitterness they're soaking up gossip they're soaking up criticalness I'm preaching this morning and what it is was I was putting that sponge inside of an environment it wasn't the sponge's fault it was my fault and in order for the sponge to have a Revival I had to throw out that environment and rinse it out a little bit and put some clean water in there and you notice that I had to dump out that water every few little every few Washings I had to dump the water out get some more water you see sometimes that's what it takes for a Revival to come inside of a home is Lord I'm reconsecration myself not just today but however long it takes I'm throwing up the criticalness you know it's criticalness that can bind up the Holy Ghost for your children it's criticalness that can bind up if that's all they're hearing what do you expect could you imagine if if somebody comes to you and it's saying hey so and so did this so and so done that this person done that and then you say hey so and so can you go talk to my daughter cuz she's needing help you think your daughter is going to listen to so and so and after you just tore them down come on now too many times we do that we're talking about this one we're criticizing this one oh man this one I oh across the country they do it this way across the country they do it that way what you're doing is binding up a Revival that can release your children from the defilement of sin I say let's take our buckets this morning let's take our atmospheres and throw it out let's take our environments and throw it out and say Lord give me the life of the blood if I need to throw some things out I'm going to throw it out if I got to stop being critical I'm going to stop it I want a Revival inside of my life oh somebody's got to get a Revival oh it's the life of the blood it's the life brother the random says how are you going to have a Revival of the Holy Ghost and people quench it and bind it and afraid of it that's where the trouble lies oh that's where the trouble Lies when they're trying to quench the Holy Ghost oh this is okay this morning this is something that's been on my heart and I haven't just preached it here I preached it out too you see some people are getting them to they're getting afraid of letting loose brother Brandon would say the blood was a token or identification that the blood identified that the worshipper had slain the lamb and accepted the lamb and applied the token to himself that he was not ashamed he didn't care who saw it he wanted everybody to see it and the play with the was placed in such a position that everybody passing by could see the token he wasn't ashamed of it he wanted everybody to see the token oh my that should be your attitudes I wanted everybody to see that the Holy Ghost is moving in my church come on now I want everybody to say that we're not dead church members now I'm not talking about going and being fanatical and doing these things but there is a true token there is a true Holy Ghost that can take the starchiness and take and and and make a separation you see brother the Brandon would say this there's been much mockery in in every phase of religion but there is a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the human being from the bondage of sin there's a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the sufferer from his suffering there is a real Holy Spirit but the brandom said there that there's many mockeries out there but that don't take away that there is still something genuine come on now you might be afraid saying well we see what this person's doing we see what that church is doing it might be a moery but that doesn't mean there's not a real thing there can't be a moery unless there's a real thing right you can't be a counterfeit $5 bill if there's no real $5 bill right you've never seen a counterfeit $9 bill right cuz there's not one out there but there are counterfeits off of the genuine so if there's a marree of the Holy Ghost that means there's a genuine holy ghost that the church can have there's a genuine Revival that can come on the inside you know what I say to do let's start digging ditches I say let's let's start digging ditches you know the prophet under inspiration there in Second Kings would say we're not going to hear no Thunder we're not going to see no rain but you dig ditches and you get up the next morning and there's going to be water you might not know how it's going to happen but I say let's dig ditches we might not know how the Next Generation is going to make a Rapture but let's dig ditches we might not know how my rebellious teenager is going to be set free but I'm making preparations I know that the same holy ghost that set me a fire is the same holy ghost that can get a hold of their life let's start digging ditches you know what happens when you dig a ditch you got to get the dirt out you got to get it out I'm sure the water was already there but the dirt was covering up the water oh when your Revival is already there but the criticalness can bury up your Revival bitterness can bury up the Revival but as you start to dig the ditches you're you're you're released on the Holy Ghost the come inside of a family the come inside of a church oh Hallelujah but you see when you're expecting something to happen you make preparations for it and we see that that how come it's in the evening time that the devil has fought so hard against the Holy Ghost we're living in the day where the Holy Ghost you know man we can't do this this we can't do that there's so many there's intellectual Devils intellectual spirits that is trying to bind it up how come cuz brother Brandon would say this the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept for 14 days and the lamb was killed and the blood was applied in the evening time he says you get it so it's the holy ghost that identifies you with the purchase of the blood and we would see that we're living in the day where the open book has been given to us and what was inside of the open book was your Redemption right it was your Redemption claims it was your the right for a Rapture it was your right for the Holy Ghost it was your right forever redempt the promise of God but it's applying the blood that identifies you with what this message has brought so without the Holy Ghost the the the this message is still a closed book but with the Holy Ghost the message is more than tapes more than quotes but it's my Redemption so that's why the devil is fighting so hard against the Holy Ghost because he knows if he can keep you from the Holy Ghost he's keeping you from your Redemptive claims from your Redemptive rights that's why the Holy Ghost is so important today it don't matter what comes against it we need the Holy Ghost today cuz we would see that the Bible would tell us that the blood of Jesus speaks better things than that of Abel cuz we know that Abel his blood spoke condemnation right cuz it was it was God that would come to Cain and would say where's your brother you know and he would say am I my am I My Brother's Keeper and he would say well his blood cries against you and so it was the blood of Cain it was the blood of Abel that spoke condemnation but we would see that it's the blood of Jesus that speaks of redemption it's not speaking condemnation it's speaking Redemption and so brother Brandon would say this here Paul tells us talking about speaking of the blood Paul said Paul tells us the the blood speaks you believe the blood speaks in Genesis 4:1 or 410 God told Cain he says where is your brother he says his blood the blood is the voice of his blood calls out against you now we also find in Hebrews the 12th chapter the 24th verse that the New Testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word oh my so if the blood is speaking that means it's the word and so the life of the blood connects you to the voice of the blood and that brings Redemption inside of Fallen Humanity that's why the devil is fighting so hard for you to get the Holy Ghost brother the brand would say this the life that is in you speaks from the shed blood oh my oh brother I wish everybody could see that if you can see what it is it's the life that is in you see the blood is identifying you with it it's the token what is the blood shed for shed for you you've accepted it and the life has come into you you have the token he says the blood is identifying you with the voice of the blood and so if the voice speaks something that means I'm identified with it and that's what this message has done it is released to you and let you know that your name was always here in the book but it was sealed up the true Redemption was always in the book but it was sealed up you remember the violin that that brother Brandon would talk about in the unveiling of God he would say that the that the violin was on the oxion Block right and he would say that the auctioneer would say how much are we offered for the violin and one would say $1 another would say $5 one would say $10 and brother brandom says there was a man that was in the midst that did not think it should go for that little so what he would do is he would come pick up the bow tighten up the bow pick up the fiddle and would start to play music and then and then everybody started to cry they had never heard such beautiful music before and then the auctioneer would say now what am I offered for it one would say 1,000 2,000 5,000 10,000 brother the Bram says what was it the Master's Hand unveiled what was hidden in the old instrument he did magically put something there he just unveiled the potential is now manifestation and inside of this old book was all potentials of an overcomer potentials of your body change potentials of your rapture but the Master's Hand would unveil it and let you know it's no more potentials but now it's manifestation and now the token the life of the blood identifies what was unveiled oh my that's why you cannot lose it's God saying hey here's the Rapture and the life inside of you says yep it's mine God says here's your body change the life says yep it's mine here's your healing yes it's mine here's your deliverance yes it's mine here's your here's your ey here's the liberty for your children yes it's mine and so it's the life of the blood identifying you with the voice of the blood oh Hallelujah it identifies you and says hey it's yours you see now whenever whenever we go and fly I got my token I got my ticket you know and I don't know if I'm the only one that gets nervous security if anybody I don't know why there's nothing they can do from keeping me on getting to my plane but I get nervous I don't know why I get there you know and I've even got that uh I've got I can't remember what what it's called now the global global entry that I don't even got to take off my shoes I don't even got to take off my belt I don't got to I don't got to take out uh my computer or iPad all I got to do was walk through and I still get nervous but you see I I'm starting to question my token all I got to do is give them my token they scan it and say okay have a good day and I just walk on right on through but you see that's what the devil does too many times he gets you to question your token that whenever you see your Revival you get nervous you see your healing you get nervous and say what if God don't hear my prayer what if God don't heal me you've got the token it don't matter what the devil says the blood speaks for you the blood speaks better things so it don't matter what the sickness says the blood speaks healing oh it don't matter what the bondage says the blood speaks Liberty and the token says yep I'm marching on through it I say this morning we need to get some courage about oursel and see I've got the token I've got the purchas product and healing is mine Deliverance is mine the Holy Ghost for my children is mine I'm not getting nervous with my token but it is mine oh Hallelujah this message has brought it to me and now the life of it is just bringing it to pass oh Hallelujah you know brother Brandon would say that in a court when the court writes out a word the penalty is such and such he says the law of the Court enforces the word of the Court oh the law of the Court enforces what the court says it don't matter the sentence it don't matter if they say man that's harsh that's crazy how come they got to do that the law of the Court enforces it it don't matter what the word is as long as it comes from the court then the law enforces it and it don't matter how hard the promises of God looks the law of God enforces the word of God so if you've got the Holy Ghost your Mountain might be as big as Caleb's Mountain was but you know what he says he says give me my mountain and you notice what Caleb would say Caleb would say we are more than able to take the land flowing with milk and honey how did he know it was flowing with milk and honey Moses had said so and so he might not have seen a yet it might have looked impossible but there was a voice that had already spoke for him oh Hallelujah and his voice was just matching up with the voice that God placed for that generation oh my you might not know how you're going to make a Rapture but your confession is just that of what the voice of the blood sees what the voice of the blood says that is My Confession I'm not letting no negative confession come out of my mouth I'm My Confession is going to be that of positive I might not know how I'm going to get up in the morning you might be sick and angry but your confession is a positive confession the blood speaks for me the blood speaks greater things not bad things greater things Abel's blood spoke condemnation but the blood of Jesus speaks of redemption oh it's greater things regardless of the condition it's the law regardless of it it's the law and it's going to come to pass and we would see that brother brandom says apply the token and claim your rights and shake it before Satan oh I love it he says shake it before Satan and claim your rights and he says no he says if if he comes with a box of rattlesnakes he says turn it back shake the token if he tries to give you Parkinson shake the token say oh no I know in my look the conditions my look Bleak the conditions might look hopeless but the blood is speaking in my behalf oh Hallelujah brother the brand would say this heal every one of these Lord Heal everyone that is sitting present that is sick who are you sickness who do you think you are Satan who do you claim to be every claim that you have was cancelled at caly you're blood you have no rights we defy you in the name of Jesus Christ and a holy ghost filled body you know what's so incredible is it's the holy go it's it's the spirit of the enemy that tries to cancel the Holy Ghost but once you make room for the Holy Ghost it cancels the claims that the devil has on your life oh but the random says who are you sickness who do you claim to be your claims were cancelled oh and I say whatever he claims to have on you the devil might have claimed your marriage but it's been cancelled the devil might have claimed your health but it's been canceled the devil might have claimed your mind but it has been canceled there's another voice that is speaking in your behalf brother Brandon would say it speaks of resurrection and life it speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of heaven and that same blood that was shed on the ground that called out after his dead brother or called after called out after his brother that that had killed him the blood of Jesus covers all our sins and speaks peace resurrection power life healing and all the Redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for it speaks for us certainly the blood speaks oh I hope this is okay this morning all the Redemptive rights that the blood was shed for it speaks for us and you you look in in Exodus 12:23 for the Lord would pass through the which would pass through to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the the inel and on the two side the two side post the Lord would pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer to come into your house to Smite you oh ain't that powerful he will not suffer the Destroyer oh the devil's he's seeking who he may he may devire he's out to still kill and destroy but because of the token oh he's not allowing the Destroyer to come inside of your home oh Hallelujah you remember whenever uh whenever uh uh Moses whenever they had come to kill Moses brother brandham he would preach a message on it and would say there was a bunch of witch witch ladies with long noses you know that was coming to kill to kill all the babies and they would come to Moses house and would knock on the door and he would say we know you got a baby in there and amram will look and say yeah but we don't have one for you to give oh man the Destroyer is coming to every home with lesbian Spirits homosexual Spirits with pornography with lust with this with gossip with smoking but there's been a token the speaking for you oh could you imagine being in that being in that home you know and here comes the to or Here Comes The Destroyer go into this home go into that home go into this home but knowing there was a certainty that there was a blood speaking for you oh you didn't have to get out there and say come on Destroyer there was the blood that was speaking for you oh little church you don't got the ability to keep your children safe you don't got the ability to keep them from drugs but there's a blood that is speaking and say Destroyer you can't have them corn plexes you can't have them pornography you can't have them oh hallelujah it's speaking in your behalf brother Brandon will say it's a household he says it's a household get your household in it he says it's for a family oh well brother brand going say it must be yourself it must we must believe for oursel like they did down there in Egypt and also for the house like they did in Egypt in Jericho and so forth we find out we got a scripture wrote here acts 16:31 where the Roman Centurion was to take his own life and was going to stab himself to death and Paul told him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy household shall be saved it's got to be a household so it's more than just a Daddy it's more than just a mama it's for the household you see that's an Ence as a parent that if I can get my children under the token under the token I don't got to worry about them the blood speaks for him oh Hallelujah the blood speaks for him it's a true token oh my it was Rahab the Harlot and Joshua 2 and 12 now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token oh a true token I don't want a knockoff come on now I don't want a sensation I don't want just a chill bump I don't want just dancing or speaking in tongues I I if that comes with it that's fine but I want the true token oh that should be our desire I don't want some knock off give me the true token give me the true Supernatural give me a living God give me a resurrected savior give me a Revival where I can go through the valley of the shadow of death but the blood speak speak for me I may go in the Lion's Den but the blood speaks it's a true token oh hallelujah oh hallelujah it's a true token and here she would say the next verse that ye will save alive my father my mother my brother my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from Death she didn't just say give me a true token but give my mother a true token give my daddy a true token oh that is in my house give them a true token repent be baptized for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and This Promise is unto you and your children and as many as the Lord Our God shall call it's a promise that a true token ain't just for this generation but the Next Generation can have their own Revival oh Hallelujah give me a true token I don't want to water down religion they can't keep homes together I don't want to water down religion that can can't keep me from falling and falling I don't want to water down religion I want something true but the Brandon would say in him is the fullness in him is all the sufficiency that we have need of all the sufficiency that we have need of is in him and this true token you notice whenever whenever the the children of Israel would come out of of the land of Egypt they didn't have to go look for food they God provided food he they didn't have to go find shoes god provided shoes they didn't have to go find medicine God God healed the sick all they had to do was follow the light oh my little church and himy is all the sufficiency that we have need of the blood speaks for you the blood has got your rapture brother Brandon would say but the CH the true token of the blood the true token the true token of the blood speaking out speaks of living resurrected presence the true token speaks of a living resurrected presence oh we're not Gathering here in vain we're Gathering under a living resurrected presence that in this presence Supernatural can Supernatural things can take place in this presence this morning it can fix brok it can fix broken marriages you know it was in this presence it was in this presence that whenever uh the woman that was caught in the act of adultery you remember they threw at the feet of Jesus that they might condemn him and here he stood perfect but once they threw him in threw her in his presence it released to her a liberty it released to her a separation you know brother the Brandon would say when the when the the Widow of the uh the RAB the the Harlot that would walk by Jesus at Simon's house whenever she recognized the presence of Jesus it released to her her forgiveness oh whenever brother brandom would say whenever the the woman at the well whenever she recognized that this was the Messiah it opened up a channel and the thoughts that God had in God's mind were brought back to her whenever she would recognize the presence of the the resurrected savior it would release the supernatural oh I see let's recognize who is in our midst we're not here Gathering under a Creed we're not here Gathering under a tradition we're gathering around the resurrection the presence of Jesus Christ oh that's why Rahab W the true token the Bible would tell us in Joshua 29 she said unto the men I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your terror is Fallen upon us and all that the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for We Have Heard now how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you come out of Egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of Jordan sihon and OG will who you utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in Earth beneath so she knew she already knew of the supernatural oh Hallelujah she already knew what Jehovah could do she already knew that Jehovah opened the Red Sea that destroyed the two kings of the amorites and she knew the only way she could be identified with the supernatural was a true token oh Hallelujah she wasn't just happy just hearing about it she wanted to experience she wanted to experience and brother Brandon would say there's no devil that can stand before it there's nothing that can stand before it because God has accepted it and you hold the token in your hand the price is paid oh it's a positive token a positive token in other words what the devil speaks is negative but God takes the negative and turns a positive so that's why you see Rahab was in a negative situation she was on the walls right she was on the wall so whenever the walls would come down she was coming down so she realized that the negative she was in was going to be her death but if she could get a true token it was a positive token that would take the negative and change the circumstance into a positive oh you know brother Brandon would talk about Oswald and would say could you imagine sting in his sale that he had killed he had just killed the president and he says now there's a supreme court that is angry at him all everybody is wanting his blood because he killed a fellow American and could you just imagine you're oswal sitting in your prison cell you're wanting somebody to speak for you right you want an attorney that can speak on your behalf but who would accept to be his voice if he's the one that killed the President right nobody wants to speak for him you know and so then brother the brandom later on in the tape would say what if you committed a crime and he says you know you're guilty the judge knows you're guilty and he says the evidence is stacked up against you and he says now if you found guilty he says you're going to go to the gas Chambers or you might be hung or you might go to the firing squad he says whatever the penalty is whenever you're found guilty you're going to die unless you get an attorney that can represent you and speak for you but he says now you you you can relax a little bit knowing you have a good attorney but you still got that fear in your mind that the attorne the attorney might not be able to change the judge's mind and then he would say this if this attorney with the shrewd speaking and knowing of the laws could change that and could plead your case and prove that you should live but yet in all of his great Authority and the great speech that he could make and the impr that he could put on the jury or on the judge that maybe you can relax for a little bit but still there was a question in your mind can he do it and I like how he's pointing back to the speech can he speak good enough can he speak elegant enough is there enough Authority in his speech to change his mind in other words this the the voice of his attorney has got to be speak greater things than that of the accusation because if it didn't speak greater things he was going to die but but then he would stop and he would say but your judge become your attorney oh Hallelujah in other ones in other words the one that gave the law speaks up for you against the law that's why we cannot be defeated is the one that put the law into motion is the one that separated you from the law and speaks in your behalf oh Hallelujah cuz whenever God does something it's opposite to what the devil does cuz the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 14 how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered for himself without without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God in other words this true token takes you from dead Works to living works and so the negativity you're separated from and you're put into a positive and the word positive means fully assured independent or independent of changing circumstances unconditional so if we have a if we have a positive token that means what the blood speaks is fully assured that means it cannot change so the word of God concerning your life it can never change the purpose that the blood has put upon you can never change and brother Brandon would say I don't like the negative thing I don't like to get mixed up in the negative side I like a positive beyond the positive side he would say it in another place brother brandom he would say and taking man's word is uncertain but God's word is positive and that's where we're standing on today heavens and earth may pass away but his word will never fail it's a positive word you know the Bible would tell us that that the King belshazzar was troubled and the Bible would say he was troubled and his countenance was changed and I thought it was incredible that it was because he was troubled it started to change who he was and I thought that is very that's a powerful thing cuz the Bible would tell us in Luke 24:38 and he said unto them why are you troubled why do your thoughts arise or why do thoughts arise in your hearts then being troubled started them to think negative and you see that's why we cannot be troubled in our hearts because we've got a positive token why do we need to be troubled if you've got something speaking positive you see if you go through hard times we already know that we're going to get through it because something already spoke over our life the Bible would tell us in John 14:1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and I think I love it because the Bible is putting it let your heart not be troubled he saying that they were troubled but then he would give a positive word to bring them out of the negative he would say I'm going to I'm going away but I'm going to I'm going to a place where you're going to come with me in my father's house are many mansions in other word the positive word would bring them out of the troubled condition and place them upon a solid ground oh you might be in a in a negative condition this morning but what the blood speaks is enough power to bring you out of the negative bring you out of the troubled condition and place you upon a solid rock oh the Bible would say in 2 Corinthians 4:7 but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power of God may be of God not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed so in the midst of the troubled situations there's a treasure inside of Earth and vessels oh that is bringing us through the troubless bringing us through the negative and placing Us in the positive oh you know right before that the Bible would tell us that uh that the same God the spoke light in the beginning has shined into our hearts in other words the same Living Word that brought order out of chaos is the same living word that has restored order in your chaos that's why we we don't have to be troubled we might be troubled on every side but our heart does not have to be troubled because we've got a positive token that is fully assured oh the devil might want to get to you but he has to get through the Living Word first and he can't get through it you know but the brand would say the only way the devil can get in is he has to be I think he says he has to be a he yes be justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and then he says then he's your brother right so he cannot get to you the only way for him to get to you is to become your brother oh I say we've got a positive token it's a true token it don't matter what the negativity says what complexes say what the Mind battles say we've got a positive token it's the life of the blood that is carrying us you know brother Brandon would say the blood carries us oh not the literal blood the life of the blood it carries us oh Hallelujah but we see that the king here the King was troubled but then his wife would say here's a man with an excellent spirit and he could dissolve the doubts and in Daniel 5:12 for as much an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding interpreting of dreams and chowing of hard sentences and dissolving of doubts amen dissolving of doubts so here he was in a troubled heart but there would be a man with an excellent spirit that could dissolve the doubts and we would know what do we get in this generation was an excellent Spirit you know brother Brandon would tell us he let the let the Holy Spirit search your cons conscience and you'll agree with Daniel 5:12 when the queing when the queen came in before belshazzar and said she found out there was a Prophet Daniel that was among them he was a dissolver of the doubts and you let the Holy Spirit he is the prophet of the day let him come into your heart right now and examine the word of God and you'll and the down doubts about this message will be all dissolved he dissolves all the doubts you find out exactly on the word for this day and so the same excellent spirit that will dissolve the doubts of the troubled heart for Bazar is the same excellent Spirit the prophet of the day has come here in this generation to troubled hearts to bring a to bring a separation from the doubts because you know the word dissolve I think it's pretty incredible the word dissolve in the strong means to loosen and so here the blood the life of the blood brings a remission means to separate and then the blood brings a brings a loosens you from doubt so God didn't want to just save you and then lose you in unbelief but he purchased you with the life of the blood then now he sent the prophet today to loose you from all of the doubts so that there's nothing that can keep you from your inheritance oh hope you can catch it this morning that it's the life of the blood that not only claims you but it enforces all the redempt of Rights oh Hallelujah the Bible will tell us Galatians 5:1 Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ has made us free be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage so the yok of bondage might not be smoking drinking but it can be a troubled heart okay but this morning he's here to produce Liberty to heal the troubled heart to bring a calm the circumstances to bring a positive in the negative would say you don't got to go that way right oh Hallelujah you don't got to go that way there's a positive token there's a positive token brother the Brandon would say let our musicians come brother Brandon would say just stand in the presence like I am this afternoon just bathe in care in the presence of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit taking all doubts and fears all things away from us and we stand together after a shower from Heaven has filled our souls another place he would say this here you can go along you've seen many impersonators come along saying this and glory to God I got this Hallelujah I got that you find out they haven't got anything and the devil did that to rise doubt in your heart my the devil done that to rise doubt in your heart see he done that purposely to and to do that but remember the only says one thing that there's a genuine that the that there's a genuine that the impersonator is trying to act like there is a genuine Holy Ghost there is the genuine spirit of God there is a genuine power of God there's the Son of God that's reflecting himself tonight as the Holy Ghost to shine forth this light he is standing here tonight in the midst of you in the form of the Holy Ghost to pound out all the draws out of you the doubts and to reflect to you his resurrection you know how a troubled heart can come so many times did you see this one fall you see that one backslide this one turns away and then then you're sitting there is there a real God how many's ever thought that you know is this message really true this one's fell away that one's a hypocrite you know this one's doing that and then a troubled heart can come on the inside and that troubled heart is going to bring up doubts but brother brandom says the devil done that to bring doubt in your heart but there's a genuine holy ghost that is here to remove the doubts oh my I know this was simple this morning but if there's a trouble at heart this morning there's a true token there's a true token if you can just recognize he's in the midst let's bow our heads tonight for this morning dear heavenly father Lord this is what you had upon my heart father Lord maybe there's somebody here that's got a troubled Heart Lord maybe there's doubts that has risen up Lord against the what the blood is speaking Lord the blood is still speaking for him it don't matter the doubts it don't matter the troubl at heart it don't matter Lord what is rising up don't matter if they're in the negative Lord the blood still speaks a positive token and it's here to resolve the doubts and Lord if there's somebody here that is struggling I ask that you would lift them up Lord P pull them out of the negative and place them Lord and say here Lord I'm going to disolve your doubts I'm I'm going to heal your troubled heart the same light that shined in the beginning is the same light that I'm going to shine in
