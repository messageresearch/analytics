[29:56] and having an ear to to hear what you're
[29:59] saying and Lord we ask tonight that you
[30:02] would just speak to our hearts I ask
[30:04] Lord that you would Lord just be uh with
[30:08] with everyone that is that is uh that is
[30:11] here and those that may not be feeling

[30:17] Spirit would be with them Lord we need

[30:27] we pray can the church say
[30:30] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[30:33] seated here
[30:35] tonight and um so we've we've been on um
[30:40] brother uh brandom has been dealing with
[30:43] the with the uh Holy Ghost the the last
[30:49] um uh two or three uh Wednesday nights
[30:54] and um so we dealt one night where where
[30:58] we had the
[31:00] fanaticism uh the there was there were
[31:02] those that were claiming they they had
[31:05] the
[31:06] manifestations and so then they begin to
[31:09] judge one another their spirituality by
[31:12] by the gifts and the performances and
[31:14] the things of that nature and we found
[31:16] that Christ was not even in that at all
[31:19] that the devil can can imitate any of
[31:21] the nine spiritual gifts he can um he he
[31:25] can he can do a pretty good job at it
[31:28] and then this last uh then we dealt this
[31:31] last Wednesday night with um the another
[31:35] another ditch and that is formalism and
[31:38] that is amen well I believe it's it's
[31:41] easy believism and that's that's where
[31:44] the world is today uh I I've come and
[31:47] shook the preacher's hand or I I belong
[31:50] to a certain church or I amen I you know
[31:53] and and so uh we found out that uh that
[31:58] is not eternal life neither you've
[32:00] believed unto eternal life but we're but
[32:05] we you receive eternal life amen when
[32:08] you receive the Holy Ghost and so it's
[32:12] important don't ever let the devil tell
[32:15] you you've arrived amen if the power of
[32:18] the holy spirit is not there amen and if
[32:22] there's not a burning deep down in
[32:24] desire for the for the word of God to
[32:28] have its effect in your life more than
[32:31] anything else more than your pet
[32:34] feelings your pet emotions or amen your
[32:37] pet doctrines or anything of that nature
[32:39] if there's if there's nothing within you
[32:42] amen if there's not that solid
[32:44] foundation for that then you need a new
[32:46] birth you've got to have a new birth
[32:49] it's it's it's it's a total different
[32:51] way of thinking it's a total different
[32:54] way of of of seeing the word it's a to
[32:57] total different way of believing you are
[33:00] a new creature when you receive the
[33:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost and and so we
[33:06] we went with last last uh uh week we we
[33:11] we looked at um you know at the one that
[33:15] um that there in 147 we'll just go back
[33:17] and read that to you at at at the um
[33:20] second paragraph down there 147 you know
[33:23] he says what what has caused this
[33:25] misunderstanding the answer is
[33:28] experience we have gone by experience
[33:30] and not the word away with experience as
[33:34] your measuring line there is only one
[33:37] Plum line only one rod and that is the
[33:40] word now watch carefully and get this
[33:43] Peter said repent be baptized in the
[33:46] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[33:48] of sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[33:50] the Holy Ghost Paul said have you
[33:54] received the Holy Ghost since you
[33:55] believed this is the whole
[33:58] of our problem right here people repent
[34:02] of their sins they get baptized in water
[34:06] but they don't go on and receive the
[34:09] Holy Ghost you believe unto receiving
[34:13] the spirit Believing on Jesus is the
[34:16] step in the right direction which is
[34:18] toward the Holy Ghost but the people
[34:20] stop there they go as far as water then
[34:23] stop they believe and then stop the
[34:27] Bible does not not say you receive when
[34:29] you believe it says have you received
[34:32] the Holy Ghost since you believe the
[34:35] exact literal translation is did you
[34:39] having previously believed received the
[34:41] Holy Ghost and the people believe and
[34:44] then stop you don't receive the Holy
[34:46] Ghost when you believe unto him having
[34:49] repented you go on and receive the Holy
[34:53] Ghost so so we could see that how that
[34:57] the that that the the how that this is
[35:01] really become a um this is this and I I
[35:05] you know you being my church I I just
[35:08] feel like I need to say it but but we
[35:10] got too many message Believers that are
[35:13] just amen that have thrown aside the
[35:16] power of the Holy Ghost and if you
[35:18] believe then then you've got it and and
[35:21] so they have fought so hard against
[35:24] emotionalism and fought so hard against
[35:27] G the gifts and and and brother brandham
[35:30] had brother brandham he was he had
[35:32] visions and dreams and prophecy and he
[35:36] spoke in tongues I mean that was our
[35:38] church age messenger and yet in a lot of
[35:40] these U places it's it's become so much
[35:43] like a morg until the the life of God's
[35:46] not even in it and so amen uh and and
[35:49] it's wrong folks the prophet came to
[35:52] take us back to that early church and
[35:56] that's what we should be be striving for
[35:59] don't don't sit in a in in in this
[36:01] church and just be satisfied if if the
[36:04] life of God is not permeating in you and
[36:07] bubbling out of you if it's not if if
[36:09] your ever being is is is not to please
[36:12] God with all of your heart and and and
[36:15] it doesn't cause you to to bring uh uh
[36:18] you know uh self-inspection on a daily
[36:21] Bas saying God I want to be more like
[36:24] you let me live this life help me to
[36:27] over come amen if that's not there then
[36:31] then we've got to get to that point
[36:33] where it is there amen we want the power
[36:37] of God's eternal life within us can you
[36:40] say amen that's that's that that's what
[36:43] we must have wi within the church and so
[36:47] am man and friends do not fool yourself
[36:51] if you do not have the Holy Ghost you
[36:54] are not going to make the Rapture
[36:57] there's only one group that'll make the
[36:59] Rapture and that'll be those that are
[37:01] sealed away into the kingdom of God Amen
[37:04] now that tonight we're going to be
[37:06] dealing with election a little bit and
[37:08] and um and and and I I I I I I I hope
[37:13] that you're catching this especially
[37:14] these last three services is the uh uh
[37:17] what brother Brandon was trying to say
[37:19] because he's he's he's not trying to
[37:22] scare you into the Holy Ghost cuz you
[37:24] can't be scared into it there's no way
[37:26] you can be scared into to it you can't
[37:28] you can't go on to go to heaven because
[37:30] well you don't going to get right with
[37:31] God because Grandma's there or you're
[37:33] you're afraid of going to hell or
[37:34] anything like that listen the seed of
[37:38] God the elect of God has something in
[37:42] their soul that nobody else has they
[37:46] want to be right with God and they will
[37:49] do whatever it takes because there's
[37:52] something on the inside of them driving
[37:55] them for that can you amen aren't you
[37:58] glad for that something on the inside of
[38:00] you don't ever
[38:03] ignore that seed of life on the inside
[38:07] amen and the and the convicting power of
[38:09] the Holy Ghost and so I I want us to go
[38:12] ahead and uh let's let's go ahead and
[38:15] and uh here at 148 and we'll start down
[38:19] at the very last paragraph
[38:21] here he says uh all right we have come
[38:24] this far now I want to go further and
[38:27] when I do I'm going to cause some
[38:30] emotions to rise but that is something
[38:32] I'm not responsible for to God and his
[38:35] word and the people God has sent me to
[38:39] or I am responsible to God and his word
[38:42] and the people that God has sent me to I
[38:45] have to be faithful in all he gives me
[38:47] to say in John
[38:50] 637 and and also verse 44 it says all
[38:55] that the father giveth me shall come to
[38:59] me and him that cometh to me I shall in
[39:03] no wise cast out no man can come to me
[39:08] except the Father which hath sent me
[39:11] draw him and I will raise him up at the
[39:15] last day John 1 and12 and 13 it says but
[39:19] as many as received him somebody say
[39:22] received him to them gave he power to
[39:25] become sons of God even to them that
[39:29] believe uh on his name now that sounds
[39:31] like this scripture here is saying okay
[39:33] all right so you had to do something and
[39:36] then God see as many as received him you
[39:39] had to receive him first and then those
[39:41] that believed on his name but then he
[39:43] but then he goes on it says which were
[39:46] born not of blood nor of the will of
[39:50] Flesh nor of the will of man but of God
[39:57] amen all the father hath given me will
[40:02] come to me and when they come they're
[40:06] going to listen to me amen they're going
[40:10] to receive me they're going to believe
[40:13] me because there is something special
[40:17] about that individual that individual
[40:20] God has prepared that heart before the
[40:24] foundation of the world to love him
[40:28] well that should make you want to shout
[40:30] amen amen now Ephesians 1:4 and 5 it
[40:35] says according as he somebody say he
[40:38] hath
[40:39] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[40:42] of the world that we should be holy and
[40:46] Without Blame before him and love having
[40:49] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[40:52] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[40:56] according to the good pleasure of his
[40:57] will now without getting too involved in
[40:59] the subject of the sovereignty of God
[41:01] for that would take a book in itself let
[41:03] me point out here that according to
[41:06] these vers this uh these verses Jesus
[41:09] Christ is choosing his own bride amen
[41:13] just uh the same as men choose their
[41:16] Brides today the bride today does not
[41:19] simply decide she is going to take a
[41:21] certain man for a husband no sir it is
[41:24] the groom who decides and chooses a
[41:26] certain woman for his bride John
[41:29] 15-6 you have not chosen me but I have
[41:34] chosen you now according to the word of
[41:37] God the bride was chosen before the
[41:39] foundation of the world this choosing of
[41:42] the bride was purposed in himself
[41:43] Ephesians
[41:44] 1:9 and in uh Romans 9 and11 it says
[41:49] that the purpose of God according to
[41:51] election might stand you can't read it
[41:54] any other way the heart purpose the
[41:57] Eternal purpose of God was to take a
[42:00] bride of his own choosing and that
[42:03] purpose was in himself being Eternal was
[42:07] decreed before the foundation of the
[42:09] world now I I want you to just really
[42:12] really stop and and really see this now
[42:15] you see my pretty picture over there
[42:17] hallelujah amen now now out of all of
[42:21] humanity out of all of the thousands of
[42:24] the humanity God as an individual that
[42:29] was in or individuals that was in his
[42:33] mind before the foundation of the world
[42:36] and has that predestinated seed right
[42:39] there in the heart hallelujah
[42:43] amen right there in the in the heart now
[42:46] now they he looks the same she looks the
[42:49] same we all look like we're all human
[42:52] beings we all like ice cream and and and
[42:56] playing and and and and we all do this
[42:59] thing all these things together but yet
[43:03] there are the elect of God and you boys
[43:07] and girls I want you to know that God's
[43:09] got put something special in your heart
[43:14] before the world ever began he loved you
[43:17] with an undying love and that's why
[43:20] you've got a tender heart toward him
[43:23] that's the reason why you come and sat
[43:25] here at the church amen and look forward
[43:27] to these Wednesday nights and and and
[43:29] you look forward to to to doing some of
[43:32] those things even as a kid amen you you
[43:35] have something on the inside of you that
[43:37] really loves the Lord amen how could
[43:40] that be it's because God chose you and
[43:45] place something on the inside of your
[43:47] heart before you were ever even a a
[43:50] human
[43:51] being
[43:53] hallelujah amen even when you were out
[43:55] in the world when you were out there act
[43:57] and crazy and painting the town red and
[43:59] all that you had something within you
[44:02] right there can you say amen amen God
[44:05] placed that there
[44:07] now amen so we we'll just uh we'll
[44:11] continue on here now it says watch
[44:14] carefully
[44:16] now um we're at the second paragraph
[44:19] watch carefully now and see this before
[44:21] there was ever a star um a a speck of
[44:25] star dust before God was God God is an
[44:28] object of adoration and no one was there
[44:30] to worship him so he was at that time
[44:34] only potentially God he was known only
[44:37] as eternal spirit the bride was already
[44:42] in his mind yes she was she was existing
[44:46] in his thoughts and what about the those
[44:49] thoughts of God they are Eternal are
[44:51] they not the thoughts of God Amen Let me
[44:55] let me ask you are the thoughts of God
[44:57] Eternal if you can see this you will see
[45:00] many things and I can say Amen to that
[45:03] God is unchangeable in both Essence and
[45:06] behavior we have studied that and proven
[45:09] that already God is infinite in his
[45:12] abilities so therefore he as God must be
[45:16] omniscient if he is omniscient then he
[45:19] is uh then he is not now learning nor is
[45:23] he taking counsel even with himself nor
[45:26] is he at any time adding to his
[45:28] knowledge if he can add to his knowledge
[45:31] then he's not omnip omniscient the best
[45:34] we can say is that sometime he will be
[45:38] but that is not scriptural he is
[45:41] omniscient someone shout
[45:43] hallelujah he has never had a new
[45:47] thought about anything now think about
[45:51] that he has
[45:53] God don't have new thoughts now we have
[45:57] we wake up in a new world every few
[45:59] minutes our thoughts are are we're just
[46:01] constantly new thoughts
[46:04] God has never had a new thought what God
[46:08] seen in his
[46:10] mind millions of years ago he's still
[46:13] thinking about the same thing no new
[46:16] thoughts this this will blow your mind
[46:19] no new thoughts but the thing is if you
[46:22] were in his thoughts and there was a
[46:26] little there was a little heart
[46:29] around around you when he's thinking
[46:32] about you and he saw you and he saw you
[46:35] all messed up seen you just totally sold
[46:39] you out in sin seen you out in drugs
[46:41] seen you in alcohol seen you seen your
[46:44] life tore apart seen maybe maybe your
[46:46] Mom and Daddy was just all maybe maybe
[46:49] maybe you maybe he's seen that you you
[46:51] were just a broken individual or or
[46:54] maybe he's seen that that you weren't
[46:55] going to receive the love that you
[46:57] deserve may I don't know whatever he saw
[47:01] and God looked down through that time
[47:04] and he says those are
[47:06] mine those are mine and I'm going to
[47:10] reach them in their conditions and I'm
[47:12] going to show my love and my mercy and
[47:16] my power to and through them well that
[47:19] should make you want to just love him
[47:22] with all of your heart I want to love
[47:26] him with all of my heart amen so so that
[47:30] so I'm so thankful now he says he is
[47:33] omniscient he has never had a new
[47:36] thought about anything because all his
[47:38] thoughts he has always had and always
[47:42] will have and knows the end from the
[47:45] beginning because he's God thus the
[47:48] thoughts of God are Eternal they are
[47:51] real they are not simply like a man with
[47:54] a blueprint he has drawn up which one
[47:56] one day will be translated into
[47:58] substance and form they are already real
[48:01] and eternal and part of God hallelujah
[48:05] so how see see how this works God always
[48:10] had his thoughts for Adam somebody say
[48:14] always Adam as his thoughts was not yet
[48:18] expressed Psalms 139 15 and 16 will give
[48:23] you a little bit of an idea of this my
[48:25] substance was not hid from thee when I
[48:28] was made in secret and curiously wrot in
[48:31] the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes
[48:33] did not see my I did see my substance
[48:36] yet being imperfect and in thy book all
[48:39] my members were written which in
[48:41] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[48:44] there was none that as I said was not
[48:47] written about Adam but it gives you the
[48:50] idea and knowledge that the thought was
[48:53] there in his mind and that thought was
[48:55] eternal and it had to be
[48:59] expressed if you were part of God's
[49:04] thoughts you have to be
[49:09] expressed for those of you that think
[49:11] well I I just don't know if I'll ever
[49:12] receive the Holy Ghost God's already
[49:15] predestined
[49:17] it I think we just need to get a little
[49:20] more serious about amen about God's will
[49:23] in our lives and say Lord amen I I I
[49:26] want everything now you're going to
[49:28] notice as we've been going through this
[49:30] church AE these Church ages that it is
[49:33] not dependent this is not dependent upon
[49:37] your abilities at all it's all dependent
[49:40] upon what God thought at the very
[49:44] beginning God seen the false church God
[49:47] seen the real church and God placed his
[49:51] seed on the real believer so that they
[49:54] could not be deceived amen and someday
[49:57] you would come to life well that just
[49:59] that that's just wonderful is it amen
[50:02] all right so so it uh it says uh uh it
[50:07] says that as I said was not written
[50:10] about Adam but it gives you the idea and
[50:12] the knowledge that the thought was there
[50:13] in his mind and that thought was eternal
[50:16] and had to be expressed so when Adam was
[50:17] formed of the Dust of the earth and a
[50:21] spiritual being created by God then Adam
[50:24] became God's thoughts expressed
[50:27] and those e those Eternal thoughts were
[50:30] now manifested go down through the the
[50:32] centuries we down through the centuries
[50:35] we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah
[50:37] John the Baptist and each one of these
[50:39] were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in
[50:41] its season then we come to Jesus the
[50:44] logos he was the perfect and complete
[50:47] thought expressed and he become known as
[50:49] the word that is what he is and will
[50:52] forever be now it says that he ha chosen
[50:56] Us in him Jesus before the foundation of
[51:00] the world that means that we were right
[51:04] there with him in the mind and thoughts
[51:08] of God before the foundation of the
[51:11] world that gives an eternal quality to
[51:15] the elect you can't get away from that
[51:19] now let me let let me inject a thought
[51:21] in here even our natural birth is based
[51:24] on Election the female ovaries produce
[51:27] many many eggs that is uh uh but why is
[51:30] it that a certain time a certain egg
[51:34] comes down and not another one and then
[51:37] amongst the the male sperm for no known
[51:40] reason a certain germ attaches itself to
[51:43] the egg While others that could have
[51:46] just as easily attached themselves or
[51:49] had a better opportunity to do so did
[51:52] not do so and perished there is an
[51:55] intell intelligence behind all this
[51:58] otherwise what determines whether the
[52:00] baby is a boy or a girl blonde or
[52:02] brunette light or dark type of eyes Etc
[52:06] with these thoughts in mind think of
[52:08] Joshua and Caleb did not Jesus say in
[52:11] John 6:49 your fathers did eat Mana in
[52:14] the wilderness and are dead those
[52:16] parents that died were NE uh were
[52:19] necessary as the fourfathers of people
[52:22] of the people to whom Jesus was speaking
[52:24] they perished yet they were in the
[52:27] election of God naturally as Joshua and
[52:31] Caleb were spiritually but to go on
[52:34] these elect were not only the Eternal
[52:37] thoughts of God which were to be
[52:40] expressed in flesh in their due season
[52:43] but these same elect are called by
[52:46] another name now are we doing okay so
[52:48] far amen so so is are we making it
[52:52] pretty clear amen that that out of all
[52:56] the all brother bram's uh appoint us
[52:59] back to the Israel and uh uh you know
[53:03] and and there were there were millions
[53:05] millions millions millions we just put
[53:08] all these millions all over amen they
[53:11] were just everywhere and yet there were
[53:14] two elected
[53:16] individuals that were loved by God
[53:20] predestinated by God to go into that
[53:24] Promised Land amen now we're fixing to
[53:26] show that in just a minute now listen we
[53:29] ought to be
[53:30] thankful and those of us that have been
[53:33] elected to God elected and and been
[53:36] given that that's something on the
[53:38] inside don't ever let the tree of
[53:41] knowledge ever ever take the the the
[53:45] love for this word away from you Amen
[53:48] brother brandom taught us that science
[53:51] culture religion all comes off they are
[53:55] fruit off the tree of life amen Satan
[53:58] can produce science what is science amen
[54:02] well science is is is your uh your
[54:05] inventions you get you know your smarts
[54:08] your uh you know
[54:10] everything your your iPad your your uh
[54:14] computer all of these things all come
[54:16] off that tree of knowledge amen culture
[54:19] uh the the the way the society is has is
[54:22] is is uh is set up and and the way that
[54:26] everything is going in our in in our
[54:28] society today that all comes off that
[54:31] tree of knowledge religion all of these
[54:34] churches all of these religions all of
[54:37] this that all comes from the
[54:40] devil amen and Pentecostals see they
[54:44] that's where that's where they messed up
[54:46] because now they they're out speaking in
[54:48] tongues jumping and shouting and doing
[54:50] all of these things and yet they won't
[54:52] line up to the word of God they'll
[54:55] blaspheme the word of God they'll say
[54:57] it's okay for me to be a homosexual it's
[54:59] okay for me to wear wear tight uh uh
[55:02] skirts and blouses it's okay it don't
[55:05] matter it don't matter what I when the
[55:06] when the prophet came in and Blasting
[55:09] those kinds of things the Bible blasted
[55:11] those things but at individual that is
[55:14] satisfied with their
[55:16] experience and not the word of God
[55:19] they're going to be deceived that's
[55:22] right you can sit right in here in this
[55:24] church and and and be satisfied IED with
[55:26] your experience oh the Lord's touched me
[55:29] oh and and yet you will just willfully
[55:32] walk against the word of God it shows
[55:35] that there might be something they're
[55:37] missing can you say Amen so we if there
[55:40] is something in our heart is something
[55:42] in our heart that says I I love the Lord
[55:45] am man I I I I I I want to please the
[55:50] Lord that seed on the inside of you
[55:54] though it's a little bitty seed amen
[55:57] when the spirit of God Christ the logos
[56:00] that is the tree of life now now when we
[56:02] talk about the two trees the they there
[56:05] uh for for you kids I I don't want to go
[56:07] off in too many uh Trails here tonight
[56:09] but but the tree there is not a literal
[56:11] tree called the Tree of Life there is
[56:14] not a literal tree called the knowledge
[56:17] of Good and Evil these are amen These
[56:20] Are Spiritual trees these are
[56:22] figuratively one Speaking of Christ the
[56:26] anointing the logos the word amen the
[56:30] pillar of fire that's the tree of life
[56:34] amen the tree of knowledge that's the
[56:36] devil that's that evil one that says I
[56:39] want to I want to sit in the
[56:41] congregation of God above the
[56:43] congregation and I want them to bow to
[56:45] me and I want them well so how did he do
[56:49] it the Bible says that he would end up
[56:52] in this last day sitting in the
[56:55] congregation of God God claiming to be
[56:59] Christian amen and while they're all
[57:02] lifting their hands up their hearts
[57:05] because they're they they say I love you
[57:07] Lord but the word has been totally
[57:10] dismissed amen and we've got this fake
[57:13] Christ that is set up here amen we've
[57:15] got the fake Christ and everyone say I
[57:17] love you Jesus I love you Jesus and the
[57:20] word of God they ignore they don't want
[57:22] no they won't surrender they won't obey
[57:25] they won't give any think is because
[57:27] they are worshiping the devil and they
[57:31] think they're worshiping
[57:35] Christ man so when the Holy what's going
[57:38] to tell the difference the Holy Ghost
[57:41] ignites this seed on the inside of you
[57:45] and all of a sudden you thinking like
[57:48] Christ you're acting like Christ you're
[57:51] wanting Christ right yes now these
[57:55] individuals
[57:56] they're all amen one in a million one in
[58:00] a million all of these others amen may
[58:03] may may may end up looking like this
[58:05] Hallelujah hands up in the air and
[58:08] worshiping God and all of this and and
[58:11] and ain't got nothing in here inside
[58:12] their heart it's
[58:14] dark amen all right y'all catching
[58:20] me so why do we need the Holy Ghost in
[58:23] our church only light
[58:27] only light striking the seed can make
[58:33] the seed to
[58:35] live and so we need the anointing in the
[58:37] church Hallelujah we need the power of
[58:40] God in the church and we need seeds to
[58:43] come in so when we have church services
[58:46] we should say Lord take the rocks out of
[58:48] over away from my seed take the Rocks
[58:50] away from my heart amen when we come
[58:52] into church say Lord I want this seed in
[58:54] me to grow and when once you start amen
[58:58] uh doing that getting rid of all the
[58:59] junk in your seat over above your seat
[59:02] and get rid of the video games and get
[59:04] rid of all that carnality stuff and quit
[59:06] eating off that tree of life you're
[59:08] going to find that the Holy Spirit Will
[59:09] ignite that seed it will not be legalism
[59:13] whatsoever that's right you won't have
[59:16] to make yourself pray you won't have to
[59:18] make yourself read you won't have to
[59:20] make yourself go to church you won't
[59:23] have it's already
[59:26] there
[59:28] am
[59:30] amen already there amen praise the Lord
[59:35] all right we all
[59:37] right okay I got to keep reading and
[59:40] quit talking
[59:42] amen now um so where were we
[59:46] at are we down through the centuries no
[59:48] we've already went through
[59:50] that uh oh we're are I'm we're on we're
[59:53] on 151 aren't we okay so in the first
[59:56] paragraph but to go on the elect were
[1:00:00] not only the Eternal thoughts of God
[1:00:01] which were to be expressed in flesh and
[1:00:03] their due season but the same elect are
[1:00:06] called by another name Romans
[1:00:09] 4:16 therefore it is a faith that it
[1:00:13] might be by grace to the end the promise
[1:00:17] might be sure to some of the
[1:00:22] seed to all somebody underline that you
[1:00:25] need a underline that all the
[1:00:29] seed not to that only which is of the
[1:00:31] law but to that also which is of the
[1:00:33] faith of Abraham who is the father of us
[1:00:36] all Romans 9:7 through1
[1:00:39] 13 neither because they are the Seed of
[1:00:43] Abraham are they all children but in
[1:00:46] Isaac shall thy seed be called that is
[1:00:49] they which are of the children of the
[1:00:51] flesh are not the children of God but
[1:00:55] the children of the promise are counted
[1:00:57] for seed for This Is The Word of Promise
[1:01:01] at this time I will come Sarah shall
[1:01:04] have a son and not only this but when
[1:01:07] Rebecca had also conceived by one even
[1:01:10] by Our Father Isaac for the children
[1:01:13] being not yet born neither having done
[1:01:17] any good or evil that the purpose of God
[1:01:21] according to election might stand not of
[1:01:25] works
[1:01:26] but of him that calleth it was said unto
[1:01:29] her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as
[1:01:32] it is written Jacob have I loved but
[1:01:36] Esau have I hated Galatians
[1:01:39] 3:16 now to Abraham and his seed were
[1:01:43] the promises made he saith not to seeds
[1:01:47] as of
[1:01:48] many but as of one to thy seed which is
[1:01:53] Christ Galatians 3:29
[1:01:56] if ye be Christ then are you Abraham's
[1:01:59] seed and HS according to the promise
[1:02:03] according to Romans 4:16 we find that
[1:02:06] God has given a sure promise to all of
[1:02:12] Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and
[1:02:17] all believers under the designation
[1:02:19] because he says Abraham who is the
[1:02:23] father of us all
[1:02:26] then he goes on to not only narrow down
[1:02:29] his definition but rather to finalize it
[1:02:31] in Galatians 3 he identified the seed
[1:02:35] singular with Christ and the counted the
[1:02:39] seed children uh the seed children as
[1:02:42] children of promise and the promise as
[1:02:45] having to do with
[1:02:47] election a or the choosing of God that
[1:02:51] is exactly what we have been saying
[1:02:54] these are of the royal seed of seed uh
[1:02:57] see these who are of the royal seed are
[1:02:59] the elect of God are the predestinated
[1:03:03] for known of God were in the mind of God
[1:03:06] and His Thoughts well Hallelujah in very
[1:03:10] plain language the true bride of Christ
[1:03:13] was in the mind of God eternally though
[1:03:16] not expressed until each came forth in
[1:03:18] the designated decreed season as each
[1:03:22] member came forth it became expressed
[1:03:26] and took its place in the body because
[1:03:28] this bride is the literal spoken word
[1:03:32] seed bride though she is feminine in
[1:03:35] designation she is also called the body
[1:03:37] of Christ it is very apparent that she
[1:03:40] ought to be called that for she was
[1:03:42] predestinated in him came from the same
[1:03:45] Source was eternal with him oh I just
[1:03:48] want to Rejoice right now and is now
[1:03:51] manifesting God in a many membered body
[1:03:54] whereas God once was manifested in one
[1:03:56] member even our Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:03:59] then we are coming to a conclusion as
[1:04:02] the Eternal L go God was manifest In the
[1:04:06] Flesh and Jesus dwelt and in Jesus dwelt
[1:04:10] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:04:13] that Eternal one was the father manifest
[1:04:17] in flesh and thereby gained the title of
[1:04:19] son even so we Eternal in his thoughts
[1:04:24] in our turn become the many membered
[1:04:27] spoken word seed manifest In the Flesh
[1:04:31] those Eternal thoughts now manifest In
[1:04:33] the Flesh are the sons of God even as we
[1:04:36] are so called we did not become seed by
[1:04:40] the rebirth we were seed somebody say we
[1:04:44] did not become
[1:04:46] seed when we got when we got filled with
[1:04:49] the Holy Ghost we were seed
[1:04:56] only seed can have a new birth now he'll
[1:04:59] say that he says we are seed or we were
[1:05:02] seed and therefore we're reborn for only
[1:05:06] the elect can be
[1:05:09] reborn because we wor seed is the reason
[1:05:13] we could be quickened in nonseed there
[1:05:16] is nothing to Quicken hold this
[1:05:19] carefully in mind and take the next step
[1:05:21] redeem means to buy back it restores to
[1:05:25] the original owner God by his death shed
[1:05:29] the shed Blood Bought back his own he
[1:05:33] brought back the spoken word seed bride
[1:05:36] my sheep hear my voice word and they
[1:05:40] follow me you always were a sheep you
[1:05:44] never were a pig or a dog turned into a
[1:05:49] sheep that is impossible for every kind
[1:05:53] of Life produces the same kind and
[1:05:55] there's no change in species as we were
[1:05:59] in the thoughts of God and then
[1:06:00] expressed in flesh there had to come a
[1:06:03] day when we would hear his voice the
[1:06:06] word and hearing the voice become aware
[1:06:09] of our father calling us and recognize
[1:06:12] that we are the sons of God we heard his
[1:06:16] voice and we cried out as did the
[1:06:18] prodical son save me oh my father I'm
[1:06:21] returning unto thee oh
[1:06:25] my don't you just love that so so here
[1:06:28] we are amen God placed something sister
[1:06:33] Keys how easy would it be to put that
[1:06:35] the three the three rings with the Holy
[1:06:37] Spirit in it uh Body Soul and
[1:06:40] Spirit inside here I'm putting I I'm I'm
[1:06:43] putting Red Heart amen for the Holy
[1:06:45] Ghost all right so all of these guys
[1:06:48] have got black hearts they're all got
[1:06:51] they've all got black hearts because
[1:06:52] there's no election there's nothing to
[1:06:54] them now again as we tried to say last
[1:06:58] week and I sort of felt like I might
[1:06:59] have uh um uh messed things up a little
[1:07:02] bit in in the Minds last week and this
[1:07:04] we are all
[1:07:06] born off the tree of
[1:07:10] knowledge including this fellow
[1:07:13] here all of us were born off that tree
[1:07:17] of of of knowledge amen the only the
[1:07:21] only difference is is there's an elect
[1:07:24] seat God place that elect God PL he
[1:07:28] predestinated you you came in a body of
[1:07:33] Decay but within you was always the seed
[1:07:37] of God now this is not in the church age
[1:07:40] book but I wanted to to to read this he
[1:07:43] says in the in the spoken word is the
[1:07:45] Original Seed he says all of God's Sons
[1:07:48] must be the same yes sir to be born of
[1:07:51] the word and spirit brings us back to
[1:07:54] the spoken word again what is that
[1:07:57] spoken that's the logos that's Christ
[1:08:00] that's that's the word the living word
[1:08:03] amen so he says brings us back to the
[1:08:06] spoken word again like in John 3 to be
[1:08:08] born of water and spirit what does it do
[1:08:11] then it brings you right back unto the
[1:08:14] place where you should have been at the
[1:08:20] beginning Adam was not born off this
[1:08:24] tree of life a
[1:08:26] knowledge Adam was created Body Soul and
[1:08:31] Spirit off of the tree of life he was
[1:08:35] spoken word
[1:08:37] seed you should have came amen spoken
[1:08:42] word if if if if Eve hadn't to listen to
[1:08:45] Satan then then then you would come in
[1:08:48] our discreet now now nothing's changed
[1:08:51] nothing's changed I am here according to
[1:08:53] God's Eternal predestination ated plan
[1:08:57] that seed Hallelujah now this body this
[1:09:01] this body there's a lot of ups and downs
[1:09:03] and I'm in the I I am in the the the uh
[1:09:07] imperfect will of God the permissive
[1:09:09] will of God in these in this body here
[1:09:12] but the soul is right here God eternally
[1:09:17] saw me right here in
[1:09:21] 2024 but I come in a fallen body
[1:09:25] now if we would have come the way we
[1:09:27] should have came amen there there this
[1:09:31] this this hunk right here would not
[1:09:34] would would would never
[1:09:35] die this hunk right here man would never
[1:09:39] uh he he would never he he would never
[1:09:42] sin he would never fall he would never
[1:09:45] why amen because he come in that and
[1:09:49] under the power of the Holy Spirit but
[1:09:52] now we understand that God had a a had a
[1:09:55] greater plan and we can't we can't take
[1:09:58] away from that God had a greater plan
[1:10:00] he's wanting to uh bring about
[1:10:02] Redemption and show his grace and show
[1:10:04] his mercy and show his love through us
[1:10:07] can you say Amen now now he said now
[1:10:09] watch he says that's the reason for
[1:10:11] Christ's death is to bring us right back
[1:10:14] to where sons of God if Eve would have
[1:10:17] brought forth that child she would have
[1:10:20] finally done it did not God tell her to
[1:10:23] multiply and replenish the Earth
[1:10:25] but she had to walk over and play the
[1:10:29] part of a now instead of Amen
[1:10:33] instead of doing it God's way she
[1:10:35] listened to this knowledge here she
[1:10:38] listened to Satan she listened how
[1:10:40] many's understanding any questions on
[1:10:43] that amen and now any of these questions
[1:10:46] that you do have make sure you make make
[1:10:49] sure you let us uh I I I don't want to
[1:10:52] leave anyone confused amen so
[1:10:59] uhhuh
[1:11:06] yeah Fallen
[1:11:10] yeah
[1:11:12] yeah okay so all right so that's that's
[1:11:15] a good question now remember God seen
[1:11:19] that was all part of his
[1:11:21] plan God eternally he he saw the end
[1:11:24] from the beginning he saw the fall he
[1:11:28] saw and the Bible says that even before
[1:11:30] the world was ever ever began he he uh
[1:11:34] uh uh uh Christ Jesus the lamb was slain
[1:11:37] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:11:40] so Christ said or so so this is a
[1:11:44] beautiful Plan of Redemption
[1:11:47] Adam Adam could not be
[1:11:50] deceived Adam was not deceived it was
[1:11:53] Eve and brother brandham taught us how
[1:11:56] Eve could be deceived because Adam in
[1:11:58] his in in his condition right here
[1:12:01] there's no way that he would walk away
[1:12:03] there's no way he could be deceived the
[1:12:05] only reason that Eve was uh the fell is
[1:12:08] because she was deceived all right
[1:12:11] brother bradam says she was not part of
[1:12:14] that original
[1:12:16] creation she came out of Adam Adam came
[1:12:21] straight from God she was that byproduct
[1:12:24] so she could
[1:12:27] fall because again Redemption was all a
[1:12:31] part of that Eternal plan of God uh to
[1:12:33] begin with so what happened to Adam Adam
[1:12:38] chose to follow his wife Adam chose to
[1:12:44] give to to to walk away out of that
[1:12:47] Garden to redeem his wife
[1:12:58] amen I see I see heads I see heads are
[1:13:01] turning and I'm just going to and I'm
[1:13:02] just going to put this we we've got
[1:13:05] we've got different we we we we this is
[1:13:08] a this is a uh a mixed audience and so
[1:13:11] let but but Adam put his seed in
[1:13:17] her amen sealed that
[1:13:20] womb
[1:13:22] Hallelujah Satan God could not take her
[1:13:26] because part of Adam was in
[1:13:29] her amen and that's what Christ has done
[1:13:33] with us in our fallen condition he seen
[1:13:38] us he put his seed within us so the
[1:13:43] devil could not have
[1:13:46] us and could not destroy us can you say
[1:13:50] Amen Even in our fallen condition God
[1:13:55] placed his seed there and say you can't
[1:13:59] have him
[1:14:02] am
[1:14:03] amen all right I seen some faces that
[1:14:06] were sort of a little bit skeptical of
[1:14:08] my U of of of my explanation so any
[1:14:12] questions Come on talk to
[1:14:19] me where where was that at in this B 11
[1:14:24] 116 110 to
[1:14:30] 116
[1:14:35] yeah does it does it deal with it pretty
[1:14:43] good let's let's go let's just go right
[1:14:53] now praise the
[1:15:00] Lord amen and the beauty the the
[1:15:04] beautiful part of God now now God could
[1:15:07] not God could not cause Adam to
[1:15:12] sin God could not cause Eve to sin God
[1:15:17] knew that Adam couldn't be deceived so
[1:15:20] when he took the byproduct out of Adam
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:25] there is where the fall came there's
[1:15:28] where the sin came but at that point is
[1:15:31] where Adam is reflecting the heartbeat
[1:15:34] of God in going after his wife in other
[1:15:37] words Adam could have stayed in that
[1:15:41] Garden
[1:15:42] alone and his wife outside the garden
[1:15:46] deceived and and and in death Adam would
[1:15:50] have
[1:15:52] lived but you know what
[1:15:55] Adam could not see himself living
[1:15:59] eternally without the girl that came
[1:16:01] from his side come on SO Adam
[1:16:06] willingly willingly walked outside the
[1:16:09] garden and died with Eve just as
[1:16:13] Christ could not stay in heaven in a in
[1:16:16] a paradise all alone when he had his Bri
[1:16:19] his his Fallen wife here are you
[1:16:21] understanding Fallen wife there and God
[1:16:25] God came down built himself a body and
[1:16:29] came in and lived his life and paid the
[1:16:33] price for his bride for his
[1:16:37] wife isn't that beautiful and that's the
[1:16:40] kind of heartbeat us guys should have
[1:16:42] every one of us husbands should should
[1:16:44] be to our wives too we we talked about
[1:16:47] our wives being that weaker vessel it
[1:16:49] should be our honor to love our wives
[1:16:52] and to express our love to our wives
[1:16:56] amen amen to to hide their weakness and
[1:17:00] to say I love you despite amen and and
[1:17:03] and and and and because us guys are in a
[1:17:06] fallen body our wives have to H has to
[1:17:09] look at that Eternal seat on the inside
[1:17:12] and say I love you too can you say Amen
[1:17:16] all right let's go back to
[1:17:17] 104 is that what you said it was
[1:17:20] 104 all
[1:17:23] right praise the
[1:17:28] Lord uh let's see
[1:17:33] here
[1:17:42] amen where do we want to break in
[1:17:48] at okay so so
[1:17:53] um let let let's go go down to um let's
[1:17:56] go down it's
[1:17:58] 103 and um just
[1:18:02] uh I mean about halfway in the middle of
[1:18:05] your
[1:18:06] book
[1:18:07] um we we've got Revelations 138 do you
[1:18:11] see that all that dwell uh upon the
[1:18:14] Earth shall worship him Satan whose
[1:18:16] names are not written in the Lamb's Book
[1:18:18] of Life of the lamb slain from the
[1:18:20] foundation of the world but that life
[1:18:23] could not and would not be shared in any
[1:18:26] other way than through the way of God
[1:18:30] manifest In the Flesh that was a part of
[1:18:33] his eternal and predestinated purpose
[1:18:36] this plan was to be to the praise of the
[1:18:38] glory of his grace it was the Plan of
[1:18:41] Redemption it was the Plan of Salvation
[1:18:44] now listen closely God being a savior it
[1:18:46] was necessary that he predestinate a man
[1:18:50] who would require salvation in order to
[1:18:52] give himself reason and purpose of being
[1:18:55] that is 100% correct multitudes of
[1:18:58] scriptures bear bears it out a as does
[1:19:02] the very pointed verse of of Romans
[1:19:05] 11:36 for for of him and through him and
[1:19:08] to him are all things to whom be glory
[1:19:12] forever
[1:19:13] amen man could not directly come and
[1:19:16] partake of the tree of life or see a man
[1:19:20] could not directly come partake of the
[1:19:21] Tree of Life in the midst of the garden
[1:19:23] that eternal life of the the tree had to
[1:19:25] become flesh first but before God could
[1:19:29] raise and save a sinner he had to have a
[1:19:32] sinner to raise and save man had to fall
[1:19:36] The Fall which which would be caused by
[1:19:39] Satan had to have flesh to make fall
[1:19:42] Satan had to come through flesh also but
[1:19:45] Satan would not come through human uh uh
[1:19:49] uh could not come through human flesh to
[1:19:52] make the fall as would Christ come in
[1:19:55] human flesh to restore the Fallen but
[1:19:57] there was an animal the serpent so close
[1:20:00] to man that Satan would get uh that
[1:20:04] beast and
[1:20:06] through uh and through that Beast he
[1:20:08] could get to the human flesh and cause
[1:20:10] the
[1:20:12] fall and inject himself thereby into the
[1:20:15] human race even as Jesus would one day
[1:20:17] come and inject himself into the human
[1:20:19] race into human bodies even to the
[1:20:21] extent of a resurrection wherein we
[1:20:24] would have bodies like unto his glorious
[1:20:27] one thus what God worked out here in the
[1:20:30] garden was his predestinated plan when
[1:20:34] when Satan had brought about that which
[1:20:37] was necessary to the purpose of God then
[1:20:40] man could not get to the Tree of Life In
[1:20:42] The Garden certainly not it wasn't time
[1:20:46] but an animal animal had caused the fall
[1:20:48] had it not let animal life be shed was
[1:20:53] taken and his blood shed then God had
[1:20:55] communion with man again then there was
[1:20:57] to come a day when God would appear in
[1:20:59] flesh and by means of his humiliation he
[1:21:02] would restore the Fallen man and make
[1:21:04] him partaker of that eternal life once
[1:21:07] you see this you can understand the
[1:21:09] serpent seed and know that it was no
[1:21:11] apple Eve ate no it was degradation of
[1:21:15] humanity by intermingling the seed now I
[1:21:17] know in answering one question another
[1:21:20] one is apt to come up and people ask if
[1:21:22] Eve fell that way what did Adam do God
[1:21:26] lays the blame on Adam that is simple
[1:21:29] the word of God forever is is forever
[1:21:31] settled in heaven before one Speck of
[1:21:34] Stardust was made that word God's law
[1:21:37] was exactly as it is written in our
[1:21:39] Bible now that word teaches us that if a
[1:21:41] woman leaves her husband and goes with
[1:21:44] another man she's an adulteress and is
[1:21:46] no longer married and the husband is not
[1:21:49] to take her back that word was true in
[1:21:52] Eden as it was true when Moses wrote it
[1:21:55] in the law the word can't change Adam
[1:21:59] took her back he knew exactly what he
[1:22:02] was doing but he did it anyway she was
[1:22:05] part of him he was willing to take her
[1:22:09] responsibility upon himself he would not
[1:22:12] let her go so Eve conceived by him he
[1:22:16] knew she would he knew exactly what
[1:22:20] would happen to the human race he sold
[1:22:23] the human race into sin
[1:22:25] that he might have Eve for he loved
[1:22:30] her amen now do you see that Adam could
[1:22:34] not
[1:22:34] fall but God worked it in his plan God
[1:22:38] could not create sin God's not the
[1:22:40] author of sin but God knew in his mind
[1:22:44] he knew the beginning from the end and
[1:22:46] God knew
[1:22:48] exactly what was going to bring about
[1:22:50] glory to himself and so uh uh so so how
[1:22:55] many understands that see you see that
[1:22:58] it's the beautiful part of redemption
[1:23:00] Adam had to go after his wife and so did
[1:23:05] Christ come after you and me bringing us
[1:23:08] back what is called now it's not a
[1:23:10] literal seed but it's a predestinated
[1:23:13] seed that he put in every one of our
[1:23:16] hearts to come to himall amen amen
[1:23:21] praise the Lord all right so so we so we
[1:23:25] we can we we can see that um here
[1:23:29] tonight in in our in our reading that
[1:23:32] that that
[1:23:35] election election that that beautiful
[1:23:38] purpose of God living in us now so here
[1:23:42] we are what what makes what brings about
[1:23:44] complexes so much in us as the elect
[1:23:47] because this guy has has that that seed
[1:23:51] of life within him he has that seed of
[1:23:54] life life within him but he's born he's
[1:23:58] born
[1:23:59] sexually and so even you can have the
[1:24:02] Holy Ghost and and and yet the the the
[1:24:06] uh uh have that Waring on the inside as
[1:24:09] we as we talked with last week and and I
[1:24:13] think that's all we're going to read on
[1:24:14] the church age book for tonight we'll
[1:24:16] just we we we'll we'll start on the uh
[1:24:18] other one the next time um but let me
[1:24:21] just read a a quote to you brother Bram
[1:24:23] says now the gene
[1:24:25] and he's talking about a boy that's been
[1:24:26] born in a into a complex because he's
[1:24:30] got mother uh which I believe was German
[1:24:34] and and and had the father was Irish I
[1:24:37] believe um it is and and he says the the
[1:24:42] boy in his natural was was born with a
[1:24:45] complex coming from his
[1:24:48] genetics and and and and brother brandom
[1:24:51] is telling the son or you know he's
[1:24:53] telling the father father or the
[1:24:54] father's telling him well he's he's come
[1:24:57] he's given his heart to the Lord he's
[1:24:58] been baptized we've raised him right and
[1:25:02] and because he done a girl wrong and he
[1:25:04] won't apologize about it and so when
[1:25:06] brother bradam goes and talks talks to
[1:25:08] the to the man about it he says well I
[1:25:11] don't I don't understand my my boy's
[1:25:13] being so arrogant just he says but yet
[1:25:15] he's he's he's he's come he's he's he's
[1:25:19] repented accepted Christ he's been
[1:25:21] baptized and brother brandham says sh
[1:25:25] but he's got to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:25:28] he says now the genes and this this is
[1:25:30] there in in Paradox in in 63 he says now
[1:25:34] the genes in the father and the mother
[1:25:36] of this boy no matter how much they are
[1:25:38] converted Still Remains the flesh that's
[1:25:42] been intered into this boy so so so uh
[1:25:46] uh uh uh uh father and mother can have
[1:25:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that
[1:25:51] doesn't mean that My Three Sons are not
[1:25:55] going to battle the
[1:25:58] genetics between Mom and
[1:26:01] Dad just just because you girls just
[1:26:04] because uh Michael and Amy uh uh receive
[1:26:07] the Holy Ghost doesn't mean that you're
[1:26:09] not going to battle the things that goes
[1:26:11] down back back down your daddy's uh uh
[1:26:14] tree uh bloodline and your mama's
[1:26:18] bloodline and that's the same way also
[1:26:21] it's the same way between you and your
[1:26:22] dad and mom you you the only only one
[1:26:24] there's only one way to to to uh get out
[1:26:29] of this Mass that's the new birth that's
[1:26:34] right and so so so we get we get into a
[1:26:38] complex many times setting in the church
[1:26:41] good church
[1:26:44] people good young people and yet
[1:26:48] sometimes we get to that point we just
[1:26:49] we just wonder amen what you know what I
[1:26:54] just and and and it's your
[1:26:57] genetics you're you're just a you're
[1:27:00] you're you're just an
[1:27:05] inbred body of
[1:27:08] Decay and Christ has come the only way
[1:27:12] out
[1:27:13] folks is
[1:27:17] election but just being being elected is
[1:27:19] not good
[1:27:20] enough it's got to be energized
[1:27:24] you've got to have the Holy
[1:27:26] Ghost and when that when that when that
[1:27:28] seed is energized not by not not not
[1:27:32] pregnated by a sexual uh interaction but
[1:27:36] pregnated by the Holy Spirit coming down
[1:27:39] upon that seed Just Like Water and Light
[1:27:42] upon upon an apple seed to make it to
[1:27:45] live that's our way
[1:27:48] out that's our way out now he says uh
[1:27:52] Still Remains he said uh now the jeans
[1:27:55] and and mother and father of this boy no
[1:27:57] matter how much they are converted Still
[1:27:59] Remains the flesh that's been in her in
[1:28:01] her breed into this boy therefore the
[1:28:03] boy's got a complex in him just like his
[1:28:06] mother's family they're not forgiving
[1:28:08] they they will not apologize that's
[1:28:11] where the boy stands and I said to the
[1:28:13] father no matter how much you've raised
[1:28:15] him I said now look at you out of your
[1:28:18] family all of them drunks and fighting
[1:28:20] and shooting and cutting and so forth
[1:28:22] now look at your family and I said now
[1:28:24] look at your family to the
[1:28:26] mother there there are a bunch of people
[1:28:28] they just sat there and won't speak very
[1:28:31] independent so forth IR irrevelant to
[1:28:34] religion I I but I said it's not
[1:28:38] you you're the only one of your sisters
[1:28:41] and brothers and you are sweet and kind
[1:28:44] and forgiving what does that your tree
[1:28:49] part of that family tree yet you have
[1:28:53] received the Holy Ghost that's the thing
[1:28:56] that made you tender and sweet it's not
[1:29:00] your people anymore it's Christ lives in
[1:29:06] you this
[1:29:09] body came from
[1:29:12] here but when the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:29:15] logos it's the Life of Christ coming
[1:29:17] down you are now eating from that tree
[1:29:20] of
[1:29:21] life it's eternal life
[1:29:24] within you you see that it's not this
[1:29:29] mind over matter will not work against
[1:29:33] against the tree of knowledge it just
[1:29:34] ain't going to work but all the life of
[1:29:37] God can you say Amen you love
[1:29:41] him so when you get the Holy Ghost now
[1:29:44] you're sweet and you're tender and
[1:29:45] you're thinking H my now now there's no
[1:29:48] more problems no you're still living in
[1:29:51] that body that came from the Tree of
[1:29:53] knowledge
[1:29:56] but that's where you have to bring every
[1:29:58] thought under the control of that Holy
[1:30:01] Spirit that's where you have to bring
[1:30:03] every imagination line it all up come
[1:30:06] bring it right back and say
[1:30:09] nope the Holy Spirit lives in here and
[1:30:12] the same God that took amen the the the
[1:30:15] junk of the old uh at the beginning and
[1:30:18] and when the world was without form and
[1:30:21] void and chaos and amen and when the
[1:30:24] Holy Spirit moved upon the face of the
[1:30:27] deep and started bringing about a
[1:30:29] beautiful creation that's what the holy
[1:30:32] spirit is doing in you bringing about a
[1:30:35] creation as the musicians can come but
[1:30:38] I'm still going to open this up for some
[1:30:39] more another question if if if there's
[1:30:42] anyone else that would that would want
[1:30:44] to um that would have a
[1:30:47] question
[1:30:51] amen praise the Lord
[1:30:57] no
[1:30:58] questions
[1:31:00] comments anything from you
[1:31:04] youngans see man you're 9 years old you
[1:31:06] have any
[1:31:08] questions
[1:31:11] amen amen says I'm I'm I'm I'm nine and
[1:31:16] I've learned to just sit down and Nod
[1:31:20] amen praise the Lord
[1:31:27] see when I
[1:31:29] was a child I used to think that God is
[1:31:33] just looking for a way to send me to
[1:31:36] [Music]
[1:31:41] hell and I will say that
[1:31:44] kind of mentality did produce
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:50] prayer it did produce agony
[1:31:55] iing we would
[1:31:58] agonize in
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:04] Pentecost we pray to be ready and be
[1:32:08] right
[1:32:13] we but the prayer wasn't a
[1:32:16] prayer of a
[1:32:19] son it was a prayer
[1:32:25] don't let me don't don't don't don't let
[1:32:28] me go to hell don't let me I don't want
[1:32:31] to I
[1:32:33] [Music]
[1:32:37] don't but what I have
[1:32:41] found is that I am a
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:46] son and the desires that I have in me to
[1:32:49] serving and to
[1:32:52] loving can only come from
[1:32:59] God in
[1:33:00] Me In This complex being that I
[1:33:04] am when I can't understand
[1:33:08] myself why can't you understand yourself
[1:33:10] is
[1:33:12] because you're a
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:16] mut you're a
[1:33:18] mut you got all of this from all of
[1:33:21] these you're just your your your family
[1:33:23] tree is messed
[1:33:26] up your mind is
[1:33:29] muddled you you're a mixture of
[1:33:37] everything inside of
[1:33:42] you is an eternal
[1:33:46] purpose only inside of
[1:33:49] you when he saw you in your Fallen state
[1:33:55] he said I'm not going to let you
[1:33:57] leave you were in my mind you're part of
[1:34:03] me I want to place before the foundation
[1:34:06] of the world he placed his seed and says
[1:34:10] I see him in his Fallen state but he's
[1:34:12] mine I see her in her Fallen state but
[1:34:15] she's
[1:34:16] [Music]
[1:34:20] mine election is very real
[1:34:24] but now Satan wants to get us into
[1:34:28] this he wants to get us into
[1:34:30] this Frame of Mind
[1:34:33] [Music]
[1:34:38] where where we're
[1:34:42] lukewarm to
[1:34:44] where numus we're we're we're we're
[1:34:46] we're in a we're in an age of of of
[1:34:50] drugs
[1:34:53] anything to numb your conscience
[1:34:55] anything to numb what's real
[1:35:01] we you drink you you you smoke the
[1:35:03] marijuana to sort of relax you a little
[1:35:06] bit you you take a certain drug to help
[1:35:11] you to sort of escape the present
[1:35:15] and make you to
[1:35:18] feel different and some people that's
[1:35:21] the reason why drugs are that's the
[1:35:23] reason why drugs are so addicting
[1:35:24] because it makes you
[1:35:29] feel bigger than you makes you feel like
[1:35:32] you want to makes you feel bigger than
[1:35:34] you are makes

[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:35:43] ease and though we don't take drugs and
[1:35:47] we shouldn't we shouldn't
[1:35:50] rely on drugs and whe whether they're
