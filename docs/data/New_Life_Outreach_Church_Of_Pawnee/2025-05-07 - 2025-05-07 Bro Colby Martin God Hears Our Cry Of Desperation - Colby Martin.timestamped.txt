[35:39] master. Are you thankful for that here
[35:41] tonight?
[35:43] My so glad that we have a God that
[35:46] hears.
[35:47] Amen. That he's never too busy not to
[35:51] care and understand what we're dealing
[35:53] with. Do you do you know those verses?
[35:56] Don't you sing
[35:58] it? Maybe. Okay, maybe afterwards you
[36:01] can try it or something. Those verses
[36:03] are powerful. I just don't know them.
[36:05] God bless you here tonight. If you have
[36:07] your
[36:09] Bibles, like to turn uh to Genesis
[36:13] 16:11, keep it
[36:15] simple, short tonight, and uh do more
[36:19] like a Bible study for the young people.
[36:20] So, I hope that's all right here
[36:22] tonight. But Genesis 16 and verse 11,
[36:25] when you're there, say amen. It is good
[36:28] to see everybody. It's good to have
[36:29] brother Merl, sister Leah back with us.
[36:31] I tell you, sure been missing them.
[36:35] It's all right to clap. It's all right
[36:36] to
[36:37] clap. Amen. I know they got stuck in
[36:40] Dallas there for a night or so, but I'm
[36:42] sure sure glad to see them back safely.
[36:44] And uh Genesis 16 and verse
[36:47] 11. And the angel of the Lord said unto
[36:50] her, "Behold, thou art with child, and
[36:53] shall bear a son, and shall call his
[36:55] name Ishmamail." This is what I want to
[36:57] get to. Because the Lord hath heard thy
[37:00] affliction. Let's also turn to Exodus 3
[37:04] and verse 7. Just a few more passages of
[37:07] scripture, then I'll let you be seated
[37:08] here tonight. But Exodus 3 and verse
[37:13] 7. Amen. Want to say I really enjoyed
[37:17] brother Caleb Farweather Fairweathers
[37:20] and Jonah's song leading. Amen. I got to
[37:22] tune in a little bit and got to hear
[37:24] them do it and I thought they did a a
[37:26] really good job. Brother Caleb said that
[37:28] was his first time song leading. So, I
[37:31] appreciate him doing that. It was good.
[37:33] Amen. Jordan Caleb Martins as well
[37:36] tonight. Amen. All these I tell you, I
[37:39] can just sit back and retire. Me and
[37:41] Brother Merl can just retire and and let
[37:43] them do it. Amen. Exodus 3 and verse 7.
[37:46] When you're there, say amen. And the
[37:48] Lord said, I have surely seen the
[37:50] affliction of my people which are in
[37:53] Egypt and had heard their cry by reason
[37:56] of their task masters, for I know their
[38:00] sorrows. Nehemiah of 9 and verse
[38:05] 9. Nine and verse
[38:11] 9. Amen. and did see the affliction of
[38:16] our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their
[38:20] cry by the Red Sea. One more passage of
[38:23] scripture, then I'll we can I'll let you
[38:25] have your seats. Job 34 and verse
[38:29] 28. Job 34 and verse
[38:39] 28. Amen.
[38:42] So, so that they caused the cry of the
[38:46] poor to come unto him, and he heareth
[38:49] the cry of the afflicted. Heavenly
[38:52] Father, how we love you here tonight and
[38:55] want to appreciate, we appreciate your
[38:57] presence that we feel on this Wednesday
[38:59] night. We're so honored. I know I'm
[39:01] honored, Lord, and humbled to have this
[39:04] opportunity. And I pray that you'll just
[39:06] bless the reading of the word, Lord.
[39:08] bless all the the faithful that has come
[39:10] out here tonight. In your lovely name we
[39:13] pray. Amen. And amen. God bless you. Now
[39:16] you may have your seats. And if I had a
[39:18] title be a very simple title, it would
[39:21] be God hears the cry of
[39:24] desperation. God hears the cry of
[39:26] desperation. Brother Brandham says here
[39:28] he says in desperation we know it is
[39:31] true that God will meet a desperate
[39:34] soul. Now we all know that but it
[39:37] usually takes something to drive us into
[39:39] that to that despair to
[39:41] desperation. It takes something to do
[39:45] it. Look it up the definition of
[39:48] desperation. It says desperation is a
[39:50] feeling of extreme need or urgency. Says
[39:54] usually related to a difficult or
[39:56] desperate situation. It's a powerful
[39:58] emotion that motivates someone to take
[40:02] action. And tonight, if I can just for a
[40:06] little bit, I want to start off with one
[40:08] of my favorite stories in the Bible,
[40:10] blind Barnameus. And I like to, brother
[40:12] Brandham, if you haven't
[40:15] um went back and listened to brother
[40:16] Brandham tell the story of blind
[40:17] Barameus, I would definitely recommend
[40:19] you doing so. He he does a tremendous
[40:22] job. But I want to talk on blind
[40:24] Barnameus just for a little bit tonight.
[40:26] And if we can look in Ma Mark 10 and 46,
[40:29] that's where we find his story. In Mark
[40:31] 10 and verse
[40:36] 46-52 and they came to Jericho and as he
[40:40] went out of Jericho with his disciples
[40:42] and a great number of people blind
[40:44] Barnameus the son
[40:46] of that person sat by the highway side
[40:50] begging. And when he heard that it was
[40:52] Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out
[40:54] and say, "Jesus, thou son of David, have
[40:57] mercy upon me." And many charged him
[41:00] that he would hold his peace. But he
[41:03] cried the more a great deal, thou son of
[41:05] David, have mercy upon me. And Jesus
[41:09] stood still. Ain't that amazing? And
[41:12] commanded him to be called. And they
[41:14] called the blind man, saying unto him,
[41:16] Be of good comfort, rise, he calleth
[41:20] thee. And he cast away his garment,
[41:23] rose, and came to Jesus.
[41:25] And Jesus answered or said unto
[41:28] him,"What wilt
[41:31] uh what wil thou that I should do unto
[41:33] thee?" And the blind man said unto him,
[41:35] "Gee, Lord, that I might receive my
[41:38] sight." And Jesus said unto him, "Go thy
[41:41] way. Thy faith has made thee whole." And
[41:45] immediately he received his sight and
[41:48] followed Jesus in the way. How many's
[41:51] ever been in that that place in your
[41:54] life where you need a a change? You get
[41:59] so desperate and so tired of the cycles
[42:01] that you've gone through, the conditions
[42:04] and the rituals a at everything that you
[42:08] get you you have in your life and you
[42:10] get to such a place like blind Barameus
[42:13] that you have to have a change or
[42:15] perish.
[42:16] And I want to look at blind Barnameus
[42:18] for a moment. And one man that certainly
[42:21] comes to my mind when I think of
[42:24] desperation is blind Barnameus. And I'm
[42:28] amazed at the desperation that crept up
[42:30] on this man when he heard that Jesus was
[42:33] passing by the streets of Jericho. And I
[42:36] bet he was tired of sitting on the dirt
[42:38] of the streets begging and and being
[42:40] passed by people that has had their
[42:42] sight and and living in in night. Night
[42:45] was his day. He lived in darkness since
[42:48] he was born. And he was yearning to see
[42:51] the light of daybreak. He was tired of a
[42:54] life and that held him captive for one
[42:57] for one spot for so many years. The
[43:00] question is, are are you tired of living
[43:02] in that condition here tonight? Brother
[43:04] Brandham says until you get to that
[43:06] place, until the whole church gets to a
[43:09] place that it's between death and life,
[43:12] you've got to have it now or perish.
[43:15] Then God can move upon the scene. He
[43:17] said it takes desperation to bring God
[43:20] upon the scene. So we see while blind
[43:23] Barameus was sitting by the streets
[43:25] begging, he heard that Jesus was passing
[43:29] by and there was only one thing that was
[43:32] in his mind that I must see Jesus.
[43:37] Hallelujah. I must get to the one that
[43:40] can touch my blinded eyes. He knew that
[43:43] this was his moment. He didn't know if
[43:46] he would have another moment. So he
[43:48] began to cry out to the Lord. Jesus,
[43:52] thou son of David, have mercy upon me.
[43:55] The quest within his heart could not
[43:58] allow him to be quiet, so he cried out
[44:01] all the more. Jesus, thou son of David,
[44:05] have mercy upon
[44:07] me. Is the thing you are desperate for
[44:11] bringing you to the realization that
[44:13] crying out to Jesus is the only way? We
[44:17] can try in our own ability and we try
[44:20] it. We can try to get out of the
[44:22] temptations. We can try to get out of
[44:24] the addictions. We can try to keep our
[44:26] marriage together. And we can try to do
[44:29] better. We can make all the New Year's
[44:31] resolutions that I am going to be
[44:33] better, that I am going to read my Bible
[44:35] and I'm going to listen to a message and
[44:37] I'm going to get out of this thing that
[44:40] has kept me bound for so many years. And
[44:42] we can try and we can try but you got to
[44:46] come to a place that Christ is the only
[44:49] way that you can get out of the
[44:51] impossible circumstance that you are in.
[44:55] Blind Barnameus came to the realization
[44:58] that the man that was passing him by was
[45:01] the only one that can heal him of his
[45:03] blindness that he had. and he began to
[45:06] cry in his heart, Jesus, thou son of
[45:09] David, have mercy upon me. Do you
[45:12] realize that every time you're going to
[45:14] have a breakthrough that it doesn't come
[45:17] easy? Hello, somebody. Every time you
[45:21] need a touch in your body or every time
[45:23] you need a deliverance from from an
[45:25] addiction or whatever it may be in your
[45:27] life, it is a fight. It's a struggle.
[45:31] But anything worth having is worth
[45:32] fighting for. I believe that if you want
[45:35] to be free of something, you must get to
[45:38] a place to where you're willing to fight
[45:40] tooth and nail for
[45:42] it. Well, who was it? Was it Robinson?
[45:45] Billy Robinson or whatever his name was?
[45:46] Forgive me, I don't remember. Where he
[45:48] says that you'll find my bones in this
[45:52] field if I don't get something from you.
[45:54] We got to get to a place to where God,
[45:56] it's either I get my answer or I'll die
[45:59] right here trying. We got to come to a
[46:02] place of desperation to where our cries
[46:05] have awoken the master.
[46:10] But there are things and and and people
[46:12] in your life that will try to silence
[46:15] your cry.
[46:17] Hallelujah. Don't get discouraged when
[46:20] you try the first time and fail. Don't
[46:23] get discouraged if you feel like Christ
[46:25] hasn't heard you the second time.
[46:26] Remember, it took Daniel 21 days to get
[46:30] his answer. But did did Daniel qu did
[46:32] Daniel give up? He kept on fighting. He
[46:36] kept on praying because he knew that God
[46:38] would answer what he had need
[46:41] of. Satan wants to silence you. He wants
[46:44] to keep you quiet. He wants to keep you
[46:47] satisfied in the state that you're
[46:50] sitting in right now. But it's time that
[46:52] we break out of cycles,
[46:55] of coming to church and being content of
[46:59] paying our tithes and our offering a and
[47:01] being content in the condition that
[47:03] we're in. It's time that we begin to
[47:05] break those cycles and say, "God, I'm
[47:08] here for something more than this
[47:11] showing up with this pretty face."
[47:14] Hello, somebody. We can get in the rut
[47:16] of coming to church. We can get in the
[47:19] what of listening to a message before we
[47:23] go to bed. We can get into the cycle of
[47:26] these things, but we got to realize that
[47:29] God has something more for you than just
[47:33] church. Hello, somebody. He wants to be
[47:36] a friend when you're friendless. He
[47:38] wants to be a a help in your time of
[47:40] need. He wants to be Jehovah, your
[47:43] provider. But you've got to quit trying
[47:45] in your own ability.
[47:50] It's
[47:52] sad when we use God as our emergency
[47:55] backup plan. Hello, somebody.
[47:59] When we need something, you've seen
[48:00] those those those those glass cases
[48:03] where it says break in case of
[48:04] emergency.
[48:06] Why is it that in a case of emergency,
[48:09] we break the glass? Why is it we only
[48:12] call upon God when we're in a crisis?
[48:15] Why is it we only call upon God when
[48:17] we're in an
[48:19] emergency? Hello somebody. God wants to
[48:22] be your friend. Hello somebody. He wants
[48:25] to have a relationship with you.
[48:28] Do you think my wife would still be with
[48:30] me if I gave
[48:32] her once a week part of my
[48:35] time? Do you think she would love me
[48:38] still? Do you think she would care for
[48:40] me still? Do you really think she would
[48:41] iron my clothes? Thank you for ironing
[48:44] brother Austin's clothes. Sister Rose,
[48:46] man, I'll tell
[48:47] you. Do you really think she would do it
[48:50] with a smile? If I only gave her a
[48:52] little bit of my
[48:54] time? No. No. We have to have a
[48:58] relationship. Christ wants a
[49:00] relationship. He don't want you calling
[49:03] upon him in your time of trouble, but he
[49:06] wants to be there in the good times. He
[49:09] wants to be there in the bad times. He
[49:11] wants to have such a relationship with
[49:13] you that when you do hit that emergency,
[49:17] you will know that you can fully trust
[49:19] in God because you have a relationship
[49:23] with him.
[49:25] Hallelujah. Now, back to our story.
[49:28] Blind Barmus kept on crying and he was
[49:31] calling out to Jesus repeating the same
[49:33] words, "Son of David, have mercy upon
[49:36] me.
[49:40] Brother Merl, when you're trying to get
[49:42] someone's
[49:44] attention, do you just quietly yell out
[49:47] their name? I'm asking the wrong person.
[49:50] Brother Merl doesn't yell anything
[49:55] quietly? Do you just
[49:57] quietly yell out their name? Sister
[50:00] Kaylee. When you see a kid about to walk
[50:02] in front of the a car, what do you do?
[50:05] You just say, "Hey, hey, hey, you're
[50:08] about to get hit by a
[50:11] car." No, no. It it it puts you into
[50:14] action, doesn't it? You're doing all
[50:16] kind of things. You're yelling out their
[50:18] name, "Hey." And do you think blind
[50:20] Barameus was sitting on the side of the
[50:22] road just
[50:23] saying, "Jesus, thou son of David, have
[50:25] mercy on me.
[50:27] Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy
[50:29] upon me." Um, you know, Jesus, if you
[50:32] have the time, I believe there was such
[50:34] an urgency there. He was tired of
[50:38] sitting blind in that same spot that
[50:41] when he heard that Jesus was coming his
[50:44] way, what did he begin to do? He began
[50:46] to yell, "Jesus,
[50:49] Jesus." He began to yell so loud that
[50:53] the people around him were saying, "Hey,
[50:55] sh be quiet. Be quiet. I don't want to
[50:58] hear it. We don't want to hear it. Shut
[50:59] up. Sh. Oh, the days of miracles have
[51:02] passed. So, nope. Jesus can't do
[51:04] anything for you. You're always going to
[51:06] be in that that condition. You're always
[51:08] going to be bound by drugs and alcohol.
[51:11] There's no hope for you. We're going to
[51:13] have so many voices out there saying
[51:15] you're not good enough. Saying that you
[51:17] you you send your day of grace away. But
[51:19] you've got to steal the noise and say,
[51:22] "Jesus, now son of
[51:24] David, have mercy upon me."
[51:28] You got to get to such a state of
[51:30] desperation that you don't care who's
[51:33] talking. That you're not going to shut
[51:35] up no matter what they are
[51:39] saying. Come on,
[51:41] somebody. Do you really think that Jesus
[51:44] heard blind Barnameus over the crowd? I
[51:48] want everyone to do me a favor. Everyone
[51:50] yell at one time. Just yell
[51:52] [Music]
[51:53] really loud. Kitty. Kitty. No. No. Keep
[51:55] yelling. Keep yelling. Everybody yell,
[51:58] "Can y'all hear me?
[52:00] Can you hear? Can you hear what I'm
[52:01] saying? Can you Did you hear anything I
[52:04] was
[52:05] saying? This is a group of what 40
[52:08] people and you guys are yelling and
[52:11] couldn't hear anything I was saying?" Do
[52:13] you really think Jesus heard blind
[52:15] Barameus over thousands of people
[52:17] screaming out, wanting his
[52:20] attention? What stopped Jesus?
[52:26] what his
[52:28] faith a cry of
[52:31] desperation that Lord I am done being
[52:34] blind.
[52:38] See
[52:39] desperation will require us to be
[52:43] persistent, perseverant.
[52:47] It will not allow you to be silent, to
[52:49] be dumbed down. Blind Barameus pushed
[52:52] and he pushed and he cried and he
[52:56] cried. We got to get Now say persistence
[53:00] that Lord, I'm going to push. I'm going
[53:02] to push for my healing. I'm going to
[53:04] push for my breakthrough. I'm going to
[53:06] fight for my family. Hello, somebody.
[53:09] I'm going to give everything that I got
[53:11] until I can break that
[53:14] barrier and get what I have need
[53:17] of. Hallelujah.
[53:20] It will require us to come out of our
[53:22] comfort zone and pursue something
[53:26] greater. But blind Barnabas threw aside
[53:28] his garment. Brother Brandham said that
[53:30] garment
[53:31] identified that he was
[53:33] blind. But blind Barnabas knew that if
[53:37] he got to Jesus, oh my, that he wouldn't
[53:41] be needing that garment anymore.
[53:44] He knew that if he can ever get into the
[53:46] presence of the Lord and if we can ever
[53:49] get to that place to where we know that
[53:52] if we can ever get into the presence of
[53:55] the Lord, we will have our
[53:57] deliverance. If we know beyond a shadow
[54:00] of a doubt that we won't have to go back
[54:03] to that place again. We can drop the
[54:05] garments and the chains and the things
[54:08] that keep us bound. We can be free. But
[54:10] it takes a cry of desperation. You got
[54:13] to get to a point that you're sick of
[54:15] it. Until you get to that point, you're
[54:19] never going to receive nothing from
[54:21] God. Hello, somebody.
[54:26] Let me tell you something.
[54:29] Desperation always
[54:31] leads to
[54:33] faith. Desperation always leads to
[54:36] faith. You look at the woman with the
[54:37] issue of blood. She got so desperate
[54:40] that she didn't care what people
[54:41] thought. She just knew if she can touch
[54:44] the master's garment that she would be
[54:47] well.
[54:50] She just knew. She spent money with
[54:53] doctor after doctor after doctor trying
[54:56] to have the situation resolved. But she
[54:58] only got
[55:00] worse. Let me tell you something. When
[55:02] friends forsake
[55:03] you, when family forsakes you, you're
[55:06] the God that sticks closer than a
[55:08] brother. And if you could only I know
[55:11] I'm probably beating a dead horse, but
[55:12] I'm trying to get you to understand if
[55:14] you could only get into his presence,
[55:16] whatever you have need of will be made
[55:19] possible. You don't have to be in a
[55:22] church to have your prayers answered.
[55:25] Church is great and I and I strongly
[55:27] believe in going to church, but God can
[55:30] answer you right there at your home. God
[55:32] can answer your cry of desperation right
[55:34] there in your vehicle. God can answer
[55:37] wherever you're at. He responds to a cry
[55:40] of desperation.
[55:42] Amen. That God, I need you. I may be on
[55:45] my way to work, but I got bills that are
[55:47] are piling up. God, I need your
[55:53] help. God hears your
[55:55] cries. God remembers his promise towards
[55:58] you. God sees every situation before it
[56:02] happens. And God responds to every
[56:05] prayer of
[56:06] desperation. If you're facing a
[56:08] difficult situation in your life, the
[56:10] first thing you must always realize that
[56:12] God is as close as the mention of his
[56:16] name. His line is never busy and his ear
[56:20] is always open. And he desires for you
[56:23] to call upon his name. God wants to show
[56:26] you how great he is. God wants to show
[56:29] his power. You know,
[56:31] like I don't mind showing off for my
[56:34] wife every now and
[56:36] then. Brother
[56:37] Merl, you like taking your wife golfing,
[56:40] right? Showing how good you are.
[56:44] Austin, I mean, what'd you have to do to
[56:46] get Sister Rose? It must have been must
[56:48] have been something
[56:52] great. God loves his
[56:54] bride and God will do anything he can to
[56:58] show off his power, but he is waiting
[57:01] for you to ask him. He knows what you
[57:04] have need of. God
[57:07] is God is wanting to show you himself,
[57:11] but he needs a cry. He needs you to ask.
[57:15] What happened when blind Barnameus came
[57:17] up to him? Jesus asked, "What do you
[57:19] have need of?" Jesus knew what he had
[57:22] need of. Jesus knew he was blind since
[57:24] birth. Jesus knew he needed sight, but
[57:28] he had to hear him
[57:29] mask. And blind Barnameus said, "Lord, I
[57:32] want my sight.
[57:35] And Jesus said, "Your faith has made you
[57:38] whole." God has the power to give you
[57:41] what you have need of. There's no if
[57:43] ands or buts about it. We We're not
[57:45] wondering if God can still do it. God is
[57:47] powerful enough to take care of the
[57:49] situation you're in right now. Sister
[57:51] April, I believe God is powerful enough
[57:53] to deliver Brother John of those
[57:54] headaches. I'm believing for it. But you
[57:57] got to get to a place of desperation
[57:59] where I'm tired of this thing. I'm tired
[58:01] of feeling these headaches. I I'm I'm
[58:03] tired of the struggle. Hello somebody.
[58:05] God responds to
[58:08] desperation. And if our prayers are not
[58:10] important to us, they will not be
[58:13] important to God. Hello, somebody. You
[58:17] got to come up to God and you've got to
[58:20] know what you want. And you got to
[58:22] realize that God, I need this. God hears
[58:25] our prayers, but God can tell a cry of
[58:28] desperation. Hello, somebody. God
[58:31] responds to faith. that without faith it
[58:34] is impossible to please God.
[58:38] God has not forgotten about you. You may
[58:42] be in a circumstance here tonight where
[58:44] it feels like you're all alone. God has
[58:47] not forgotten about you. The Bible says
[58:50] Isaiah 49 and 16 that I have graven you
[58:54] in the palms of my hand and thy walls
[58:57] are continually before me. God has
[58:59] carved you in his hands. God sees
[59:02] everything that you're going through at
[59:03] this moment. Sometimes we feel like no
[59:06] one knows, that no one sees what we're
[59:08] going through. But the truth is, God
[59:10] sees. He
[59:13] understands. Brother Harry is still
[59:15] looking for a job. God sees the
[59:18] situation. God understands. And I
[59:21] believe God has the perfect job for
[59:23] Brother Harry. I'm so thankful for
[59:25] Brother Mike getting his job back. God
[59:28] sees and he heard the prayers. Amen.
[59:31] But God sees what no one else
[59:36] can and in our
[59:40] moment we go through weaknesses in our
[59:43] life. To others we may seem strong and
[59:47] able to handle everything. But God sees
[59:50] our weaknesses. Sister
[59:52] April, the Bible says his strength is
[59:55] made
[59:56] perfect in our weakness.
[59:59] Do you believe
[1:00:00] that? And the enemy, he would love to
[1:00:03] beat you down in the time of your trial,
[1:00:06] saying, "Where's your faith?" How many's
[1:00:08] ever experienced that? That where's your
[1:00:11] faith? That if you really had faith, God
[1:00:13] would have already answered your
[1:00:18] prayer. The enemy will hit you and
[1:00:20] combat your mind right here. Brother
[1:00:22] Brandham says, "The greatest battle ever
[1:00:24] fought right here." And we're in an age
[1:00:28] where it seems like our the weight of
[1:00:30] the mind is so
[1:00:32] heavy, so prevalent. We may not do
[1:00:35] anything during the day, but we're being
[1:00:37] fought here and we're so it feel like we
[1:00:39] just worked an eight hour day because
[1:00:40] we're so wore out from
[1:00:43] here. I hate doing paperwork. I hate I
[1:00:46] hate bidding jobs. Honestly, I would
[1:00:48] rather go out and work, brother Merl.
[1:00:49] eight hours because it seems like when
[1:00:52] you're doing mental work, it wears me
[1:00:55] out more than an eighth hour
[1:00:57] day. And that is where Satan is plaguing
[1:01:00] our mind where we're so tired of
[1:01:03] fighting. Sister Thelma, we're so tired
[1:01:07] that we just want to give in. Let me
[1:01:09] tell you something. That's where the
[1:01:10] enemy would love to slip in there and
[1:01:13] let you know that, oh, you're not you're
[1:01:15] this ain't for you. That's where a cry
[1:01:17] of desperation comes in. that God, I
[1:01:20] need this situation figured out. I know
[1:01:24] this is simple. I told you I was going
[1:01:26] to preach to the young people
[1:01:28] tonight. But years ago, a a very famous
[1:01:31] picture of a chess match was
[1:01:34] painted. It was called Checkmate.
[1:01:37] Brother Merl, you may have heard of that
[1:01:38] before. Checkmate.
[1:01:42] It had been placed in a gallery for
[1:01:45] viewing and a world champion chess
[1:01:48] master was looking at this
[1:01:50] picture. It says after a few minutes he
[1:01:53] declared that there is a move that can
[1:01:57] save them. He saw a move that had been
[1:02:00] overlooked. One where there would not be
[1:02:03] a
[1:02:05] checkmate. God sees the moves that we
[1:02:08] cannot see. Are you with me? Just a
[1:02:09] little bit longer.
[1:02:11] In Corinthians, he declares that he will
[1:02:14] make a way of escape. That he will not
[1:02:18] put more on us than what we could bear.
[1:02:20] Amen. But in all of that, that he would
[1:02:22] make a way of
[1:02:23] escape. Hallelujah. I'm so glad that God
[1:02:26] sees all. That God is not the God of
[1:02:29] inactivity, but he is active. He is
[1:02:31] ready to show you what he can do. He
[1:02:34] will open doors that no man can shut.
[1:02:37] God is a miracle worker. that he is he
[1:02:40] there is nothing impossible for God. The
[1:02:43] Bible says here, I will supply all your
[1:02:45] needs according to my riches and glory.
[1:02:50] Hello. But we can find God to the
[1:02:53] situation that we're in at the moment.
[1:02:56] But God is so much bigger than anything
[1:02:58] that we can ever imagine. He's bigger
[1:03:01] than any sickness. He's bigger than any
[1:03:03] temptation. He's bigger than any trial.
[1:03:06] And he's always available when we cry
[1:03:09] out to
[1:03:10] him. Do you really think blind Barnameus
[1:03:13] would have gotten his healing if he
[1:03:15] didn't cry out in
[1:03:19] desperation? God will
[1:03:22] answer a desperate
[1:03:25] cry. I believe
[1:03:31] that every time is correct. when we get
[1:03:35] tired. I know in my
[1:03:36] life a lot of times I felt tired,
[1:03:39] brother Merl and weary
[1:03:42] and always wondered where the answer
[1:03:44] would come in at. Always wondered if I
[1:03:46] would ever get out of the situation that
[1:03:48] I was
[1:03:49] in. And it took more, brother Ken, than
[1:03:53] just a bedtime prayer. It took more
[1:03:56] than, you know, now I lay me down to
[1:03:58] sleep and I pray the Lord my soul to
[1:04:01] keep. If I die, before I wake, I pray
[1:04:03] the Lord my soul to take. It took more
[1:04:06] than a bedtime prayer. It took a
[1:04:10] cry of desperation that Lord, I need
[1:04:13] something from you. We can get in the
[1:04:16] rut. We can get so tired of life that we
[1:04:18] we rush through our prayers. We rush
[1:04:20] through our devotions. We we we come to
[1:04:22] church, but we get there late. And it
[1:04:25] shows what our priorities are. Brother
[1:04:27] Merl and I knew what my priorities were
[1:04:28] at the time and I had to get to a place
[1:04:31] where I needed God to do something that
[1:04:35] was my priority or I was going to lose
[1:04:37] my family.
[1:04:42] God responds to a
[1:04:45] cry of
[1:04:48] desperation. What is your priority?
[1:04:52] You say, "Well, Brother Kobe, I I don't
[1:04:54] have time to pray, but you sure had time
[1:04:56] to watch a movie." You say, "Brother
[1:04:59] Kobe, I don't have time to to to to
[1:05:01] listen to a message, but you sure had
[1:05:03] time to go out and spend time with
[1:05:04] friends." What is your priority? And you
[1:05:08] say, "Brother Kobe, I haven't felt God
[1:05:09] in a long time." Look at the priorities
[1:05:12] that is in your life and then see why
[1:05:15] God hasn't answered your prayer yet.
[1:05:17] Hello, somebody. But if you take God off
[1:05:20] the back burner and you put him at the
[1:05:22] front and center of your life, I promise
[1:05:24] your marriage will be restored. Your
[1:05:26] children will be saved. Your answer to
[1:05:29] your prayers will come. But God has to
[1:05:31] be the focus of your life. Just like any
[1:05:35] church, you want a revival to come into
[1:05:37] this church, God has to be priority
[1:05:40] right here.
[1:05:43] Nothing else matters. You say, "Brother
[1:05:44] Kobe, I got to wave son or daughter."
[1:05:48] have a cry of desperation
[1:05:50] and say, "God, I need them." Quit trying
[1:05:53] in our own abilities. I know it's
[1:05:56] simple, but quit trying in our own
[1:05:58] abilities to make something happen. Let
[1:06:00] God perform the miraculous in the li in
[1:06:02] their
[1:06:04] lives. Let God perform the miraculous in
[1:06:08] this church. I would love to see a
[1:06:11] revival sweep over this church again. I
[1:06:15] would love to see God move into this
[1:06:16] place like he has never before to save
[1:06:19] our young people. I have four kids. I
[1:06:22] would love to see them
[1:06:23] saved. Hallelujah. Are you with me?
[1:06:26] Amen.
[1:06:28] Exodus 14 and 10 says, "And when Pharaoh
[1:06:31] drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted
[1:06:33] up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians
[1:06:36] marched after them, and they were so
[1:06:38] afraid, and the children of Israel cried
[1:06:42] unto the Lord." Psalms 34 and4 I sought
[1:06:45] the Lord and he heard me and he
[1:06:48] delivered me from all of my
[1:06:50] fears. They looked unto him and were
[1:06:53] lightened and their faces were not
[1:06:55] ashamed. This poor man cry. I love that.
[1:06:59] And the Lord heard him and saved him out
[1:07:03] of all of his
[1:07:04] troubles. Psalms 34:17.
[1:07:08] The righteous cry in the Lord heareth
[1:07:11] and deliverth them out of all of their
[1:07:14] troubles. Psalms 118
[1:07:18] and5. And I called unto the Lord in
[1:07:20] distress and the Lord answered me and
[1:07:24] set me in a large place. Psalms 120
[1:07:29] verse1. In my distress I cried unto the
[1:07:32] Lord and he heard me. I love that.
[1:07:37] Psalms 107 and verse 5 says, "Hungry and
[1:07:39] thirsty their soul faith in them, and
[1:07:42] they cried unto the Lord in their
[1:07:44] trouble, and he delivered them out of
[1:07:48] all of their distresses." Psalms 107 and
[1:07:51] verse 12 says, "Therefore he brought
[1:07:54] down their heart with labor, and they
[1:07:56] fell down, and there was none to help.
[1:07:59] Then they cried unto the Lord in their
[1:08:02] trouble, and he saved them out of their
[1:08:05] distresses." Psalms 107 and verse
[1:08:09] 18 says their their soul abhoreth all
[1:08:12] matter of meat and they draw near unto
[1:08:15] the gates of death. Then they cried unto
[1:08:18] the Lord in their trouble and he saved
[1:08:21] them out of all their distresses. Are
[1:08:24] you catching the drift? That when you
[1:08:25] cry out to God, God will be there to
[1:08:27] save you. Psalms 107 27. They reel to
[1:08:32] and fro and stagger like a drunk
[1:08:35] man. Are all their wits end. Then they
[1:08:38] cried unto the Lord in their trouble,
[1:08:41] and he bringeth them out of their
[1:08:44] distresses. Deuteronomy
[1:08:47] 4:29. But if from thence thou will seek
[1:08:50] the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him.
[1:08:54] If thou seek him with all thy heart and
[1:08:58] with all thy soul. I'm almost done.
[1:09:02] Psalms 18 and verse
[1:09:04] 5. Says, "The sorrows of hell compassed
[1:09:07] me about. The snares of death prevented
[1:09:10] me, and in my
[1:09:12] distress I called unto the Lord and
[1:09:15] cried unto my God. He heard my voice out
[1:09:18] of his temple, and my cry came before
[1:09:21] him, even into his ears."
[1:09:24] Psalms 145 and verse
[1:09:28] 18 says, "The Lord is nigh unto all of
[1:09:32] them that call upon him. To all that
[1:09:35] call upon him in truth. He will fulfill
[1:09:39] the desire of them that fear him. He
[1:09:42] also will hear their cry and save them."
[1:09:48] Psalms 30 and:e 2 says,"Oh Lord my God,
[1:09:52] I cried unto
[1:09:53] thee and thou hast healed me." Brother
[1:09:58] Brandham says here talking about blind
[1:10:01] Barnameus, he said desperation drove him
[1:10:04] to scream, "Oh Jesus, thou son of David,
[1:10:06] have mercy upon
[1:10:08] me. Pass me not, oh gentle Savior, but
[1:10:10] hear my humble cry.
[1:10:13] while on others, thou art calling, do
[1:10:16] not pass me by. Oh Jesus, he said. Some
[1:10:19] of them said, "Shut up. You make too
[1:10:21] much noise." But he was desperate. If he
[1:10:25] got by, he might never have another
[1:10:27] opportunity, and we might not either.
[1:10:30] This might be the last night.
[1:10:32] Desperation. He screamed out, "Oh,
[1:10:35] Jesus." No matter who told him to stop,
[1:10:39] he cried just the same. that much more
[1:10:42] louder. When they told him to shut up,
[1:10:44] it made him get louder. He was
[1:10:47] desperate. Nobody could stop him. Thou
[1:10:51] son of David, have mercy upon me. He
[1:10:54] screamed in
[1:10:56] desperation. And the son of God with
[1:10:58] sins of the world upon his shoulders
[1:11:01] going to Jerusalem to be offered up
[1:11:03] right then for a sacrifice for the world
[1:11:05] stopped in his tracks.
[1:11:08] desperation, a desparing cry stopped the
[1:11:11] son of God, saying, "What would you have
[1:11:14] me do for you, oh Lord, that I might
[1:11:18] receive my
[1:11:19] sight?" He said, "Go. Your faith has
[1:11:23] saved
[1:11:24] you." That was enough
[1:11:27] desperation. When desperation is to
[1:11:30] receive something, the faintest little
[1:11:32] touch, faith grabs it. See, he didn't
[1:11:35] say, "Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[1:11:37] Hold there just a minute. Let me see if
[1:11:39] I can see now. I never did see my hands
[1:11:43] for many years. He said, "Let's see if I
[1:11:45] can see. I don't see nothing yet." When
[1:11:48] Jesus said, "Thy faith has saved thee,"
[1:11:51] that was enough. That was all he wanted.
[1:11:55] Desperation calls for a subject.
[1:11:59] And when the subject, no matter how
[1:12:00] faint it is, is received is believed
[1:12:03] right thin because faith catches when
[1:12:07] desperation is pushing its seed. Love in
[1:12:10] there mixes with it and brings it to
[1:12:13] it. Desperation doesn't. How many can
[1:12:18] say, "Lord, I need something from
[1:12:20] you. Lord, I I have a cry. I know in my
[1:12:24] life, I would love to have more of God.
[1:12:27] I would love to see my family more on
[1:12:29] fire for God. I Amen. I I I would love
[1:12:33] to see it. As the musicians come now,
[1:12:36] can we just bow our heads? And Gracious
[1:12:39] Heavenly Father, how we love you here
[1:12:42] tonight. And Lord, I brought this the
[1:12:46] best way that I know how. Lord, I know
[1:12:48] it was simple, but Lord, I pray that
[1:12:51] your people caught the gist of what I
[1:12:53] was trying to say. that Lord in our
[1:12:56] cries of desperation, in our time of
[1:12:59] loneliness,
[1:13:00] Lord, in our time of struggle and
[1:13:03] temptation and
[1:13:05] trial, that we're never
[1:13:08] alone, that we're not forgotten, Lord,
[1:13:11] or
[1:13:12] forsaken, but it's in those times that
[1:13:14] you are just waiting for a cry of
[1:13:18] desperation. And Lord, here tonight, you
[1:13:20] see the hands that were raised. You see
[1:13:22] every heart, every need, every
[1:13:27] desire. Lord, I pray for every one of
[1:13:29] these members of New Life Outreach.
[1:13:33] Lord, that a revival would sleep across
[1:13:36] every heart, Lord, and every
[1:13:38] home. Touch every life, Lord. Put a
[1:13:43] ferveny in each one of their hearts,
[1:13:46] Lord. May we clean out the closets,
[1:13:49] Lord.
[1:13:51] May we bring take that candle, Father,
[1:13:53] and go through every
[1:13:55] home. Lord, take out any 11 that's among
[1:13:58] us,
[1:13:59] Lord. Search my heart,
[1:14:03] Father. Look at my life, my family's
[1:14:06] life, my children's life,
[1:14:09] Lord. I pray here tonight, Father, that
[1:14:12] you would touch every heart.
[1:14:15] Forgive us of any sin, Lord, or
[1:14:19] wrongdoing. Forgive us any of anything,
[1:14:21] Lord, that would hinder your presence
[1:14:23] within this church, within our homes,
[1:14:26] within our
[1:14:27] lives. Cleanse us, Lord. Purify our
[1:14:30] hearts. Help us to make the time, Lord,
[1:14:33] to entertain your
[1:14:37] presence. Move among us now, Father, is
[1:14:40] our
[1:14:41] prayer. We need you, Lord.
[1:14:44] I need you
[1:14:45] tonight. Amen. And amen. Can you stand
[1:14:48] and help us sing this now? You're my
[1:14:51] child. Your
[1:14:54] cry have
[1:14:57] awoken. The
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:02] master we
[1:15:04] know your
[1:15:07] voice. Lift your head. It is time to
[1:15:11] rejoice child who
[1:15:15] cries have
[1:15:17] awoken the
[1:15:19] master. Sing it again now. Cause we
[1:15:25] pray. Oh
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:27] night we held on with all of your might.
[1:15:32] Child you
[1:15:35] cry. Have
[1:15:37] awoken. the
[1:15:42] master. He
[1:15:45] knows your
[1:15:47] voice. Lift your head. It's time to
[1:15:52] rejoice, child. Your
[1:15:55] cry have
[1:15:58] awoken the
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:02] master. Can we go down to
[1:16:05] D? I sought the
[1:16:09] Lord and he answered
[1:16:14] me and delivered
[1:16:18] me from every
[1:16:22] fear. Those who looked on
[1:16:27] him
[1:16:29] [Music]
[1:16:31] already, they'll never be
