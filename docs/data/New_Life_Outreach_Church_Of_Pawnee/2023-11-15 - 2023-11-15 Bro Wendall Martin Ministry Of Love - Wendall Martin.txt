you hear about the love of God and a Father's Love but you really never never understood it brother Mitch until I had children of my own and begin to realize that no matter what that child does I can never not love them and then putting that in the Su the spiritual and realize and no matter what I've done God can never not love me there's nothing that we can ever do in this life that can ever shun the love of God Amen so thank you for that song that meant a lot to me and as we get ready to turn to our pastor can we sing this song Jesus Loves Me This I I know for the Bible tells me so I believe

everyone in the house of the Lord tonight and um uh we're sure praying for everyone that's not feeling well you know when you've got those weddings uh and funerals and you get around a whole bunch of people there's just no telling what you get amen but uh a man we're just uh we're glad to see everyone here tonight and and in the presence of the Lord if you have your Bibles we'll just go ahead and get right on into the scripture I sure enjoyed those specials tonight and um my I uh it's just so good to hear Loretta and Josh uh sing again and and they they sing so good together and uh so we uh appreciated that and and uh sister Tracy I've always loved your singing amen and uh just been it's just really been nice having sister Tracy um uh with us and and uh I I love love her voice amen love that singing here in 2 Corinthians 5 and 11 it says knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto God I trust also uh are made manif manest in your consciences for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer to them which glory in appearance not in heart for whether we be beside ourselves it is God whether we be sober it is for your cause for the love of Christ constrains us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead and that he died for all that they should live not hence for uh they uh they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore uh henceforth know we no man after the flesh yay though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore If any man be in Christ Christ let he uh he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new all things are of God who ha reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their transpasses unto them and ha committed unto us the ministry or the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ yet be reconciled to God for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him can you say Amen aren't you glad you heard the good news amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we're just thanking you today for your blessings thanking you Lord for all that you mean to us Lord and for what we mean to you and we're just asking Lord that you would earnestly hear our prayer as we have so many Lord that aren't feeling well and I'm asking God that you would touch them and heal them Lord make them every wi hole oh God let your angel come around Pony just now I'm asking Lord that you would be with uh uh the the Applegates and sister juel and sister Gail and all of them there in Henrietta Lord who who are planning a funeral father ask that you would be with them there Lord I pray father that you would just be with us here this evening and that you would anoint our hearts and our minds Lord that we could hear you and Lord to understand what you are saying to us father we love you father with all of our heart in in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated praise the Lord so it's uh it is good to see everyone here tonight and and um uh we uh are are sure in in prayer for uh sister titha and and I know that she must her and brother Mitch or must be just wore out with that uh wedding and and and uh glad to hear that everything went good for sister Angie uh yesterday and and so we're we're sure thankful for that believing the Lord to to help her to feel a lot better than what she has she's been struggling with that hand for a long time and uh but I want to just Minister tonight for uh for a a few moments on the ministry of love and um as we read tonight man uh the uh the Apostle Paul let us know he says the love of Christ constrains us amen that we should not live henceforth to ourselves amen but unto him that died for us and that rose again and I I think that you know uh the the prophet of God told us that none of us are were saved uh uh just to be a religious person amen but each of us have been given a Ministry and and um there's there's many uh there's the five-fold ministry there are the nine spiritual gifts there are the the helps and the governments in the church there's there's so many things that but every one of us there in 1 Peter 4:10 it says as every man hath received the gift even so Minister the same one one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God so amen as every man every believer has received the gift that is singular that's the gift of eternal life that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the new birth and so amen the first thing in in being a part of a body is that we uh are we must be uh baptized into that body by one spirit and we are a many membered body can you say am man now I've been preaching a little bit to the uh uh concerning the god called preacher and and the god called preacher is so incredibly important but every member of the church is important every Ministry in the church is important amen so the first thing to Ministry is receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost so amen that you can't be a good steart of the manifold grace of God the multiple gifts that God has given unless we have received the singular gift which is the holy spirit that's the gift of eternal life and then you're baptized or placed into Jesus Earthly body and so the gifts and callings PL would be distributed among the body amen matters of fact there in first uh Corinthians 12:1 says but all these worketh that one and selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will so that tells us that that there are several gifts that are given to each of us so we've got callings and we've got gifts that are placed in our life amen what are these gifts and callings for they are for the edification of the body of Jesus Christ amen in a human body you've got your ears and your eyes and your your your nose and your kidneys and your liver and and and and all of these other parts of the body and all of these are required these members are are required for this body to function properly amen so every everyone has their place has their purpose and and there's one thing in between that that brings Ministry to work and that is love love is what brings Ministry to the Forefront amen because Ministry is actually a servants position it is a it it is it is something uh within us to serve the rest of the body amen now uh there in Ephesians 4:15 it says uh but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him and all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies amen so so what it is saying is we've all connected together and and and we are all ministers every one of us are minister Hallelujah now remember when when brother brandham uh there in the church age book I read it to you here I I believe it was the last service that I preached where where brother Brenham says the spirit of the Antichrist is to take the ministry of the Saints away and place it on a few holy men amen and he says and when you do that then you have effectively moved and taken the spirit of Christ out of the church church because that's the only way that we can work uh uh effectively can you say Amen so it says the whole body uh uh fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love now I also want to look here in first uh Corinthians 12:4 amen I I know we could delve into these uh gifts a lot but I I'm just I just want to uh Center on our ministry for tonight it says there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit there are differences of administration but the same Lord there are diversities of operation but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with them can you say Amen now every one of us have been placed here in the body of Christ by predestination the scripture says gifts and callings of God are without repentance that means amen they were ordained to you but while you were still a sinner amen God had God placed you here on this Earth with a specific purpose amen that means every one of us have have come to Earth to fulfill a specific purpose that God had in his mind now any gift that is laying within you was predestinated I don't care who you are I don't care whether it's Amen uh uh the baby that Lord read is Holy amen or or uh uh or or whoever would be the eldest among us we've all got gifts we come to the Earth with a purpose we've got purpose every one of us have got purpose amen and brother Bram says and when our purpose is finished then God takes us home but Satan cannot take us home until the purpose of God has been completed amen hallelujah so so that gift that was in you those gifts and those callings were placed there amen before you were saved before you were filled with the Holy Ghost now now that doesn't mean that every one of us are going want to come to our our fullest potential amen just because we've got we we we've got talents and gifts and things that God's given us there's going to that doesn't mean that that that every man and woman's going to take advantage of it matters of fact there's going to be many many many many many many that will not that cannot ever come to the Fulfillment that God's ordained for them total fulfillment because they have not worked according to the laws of God so we our gifts and our our callings amen God's got a design he designed you for that but but unless you walk and work according to his laws amen then you will not reach its its fullness can you say amen amen so so most want to just walk behind the pulpit that's what people think a Ministry is is is uh you know I I I want to get up and preach or I I want to get up in front of everyone and sing amen and you know but but sometimes God's got a God's got uh uh uh something for you to do behind a stove or or or behind a lawnmower or amen or or assisting this or that can you say Amen but you see we've got to walk and work according to the gifts that God's placed in our lives some people want to be uh uh you know singers and Hallelujah and and bless their heart they're not called the saint now now they they might they might make a Joyful Noise to the Lord amen some people might want to uh uh you know be a prophesier but if they're not called to prophesy amen then for them to pray and seek and beg God uh uh for that gift it they will never come to the fullness of what God called them here to fulfill well praise the Lord so the holy spirit says he has placed Us in the body such as it pleased him now brother Bram talks about India a and and having great potential uh of of being a a very rich Nation amen he's you know and the possibilities being innumerable and he says he says you know there's 470 people uh in in uh 70 million people in India and honest I know I'm exaggerating but I'd guess 400 million Beggars they know nothing but beg they've got plenty of Natural Resources but the mentality to develop it all they know is beg and religion can you say Amen so we are not beggars in the kingdom of God we have a position as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we have a position every one of us every position matters you see now brother Wendell I I I want to uh uh where do I start with my Ministry amen I think I think the first thing you do is you start with the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it's the Holy Ghost again that initiates you and places you in your position amen there is where the seed burst forth and a and is and is and is energized amen so now there's many that can operate gifts without the Holy Ghost now amen there's unregenerated men that's got gifts in their lives uh H uh men that amen that you know uh you know have a call to preach and they're and they're good they're they're good car salesmen they're good uh uh you know they they they they're they're good in in management and things of that nature and if these men have the baptism of the Holy Ghost then God could use them many times amen I'm not saying in all cases but some of these times uh uh God God God might have a gift in their life for setting the captives free okay and and so uh so but what we need today is the substance of life that is what makes a minister now again you can be a Preacher Song leader you can be a deacon you can be a musician you can be a pastor you can be amen and you can have you can do all of that and not have the Holy Ghost amen but any gift that we have we must have the power of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's when we become effective until then amen we're just going through the rituals we're going through the the Motions of things without the life of God to make that to live do you understand what I'm saying now now I I want to say and remember that there are gifts you know I going back to what I've just said Moses had the gift of God in his life but until he met the burning bush he could not find the potential that God ordained him to be so the potential coming to full potential is coming into the life of God Amen and and and and then there is something that really begins to transpire can you say Amen now now there you know there there are many nobodies there there are there are many nobodies that maybe they're not preachers maybe they can't even uh play music or maybe they can't even sing a song and yet they're just oozing with the Holy Ghost oil amen why because they they have found their contentment in Christ and the gift that God has placed in their lives they're living in with such a a a a sweetness of spirit and they you know the these these kind of folks are nourishing uh wherever they are they're they're they're so happy and content in Christ Jesus you see that that gift that is within them they are nurturing amen the body of Christ and and and and maybe maybe their name is not even known much in the church but the gift of God is within them and it's living and it's min ministering well praise the Lord amen oh you don't have to you don't have to be behind a Pulpit you don't have to sing be a singer in the church all you have to be is Anointed of the Holy Ghost and let him anoint those gifts on the inside of you well praise the Lord amen now I I would rather have amen uh uh that kind of a gift whatever the gift would be I if if the Lord were to give me aen more than being able to preach or to sing or or or or to testify or or or whatever else I I would rather be what fulfill this this be fulfilled on the inside with with the power of the Holy Spirit working through me then I would try to be something that I'm not Hallelujah I I think of that I amen I I I I think of the of of those that a man that brother bradam relied on and how he would he would go out there to rest and he just loved going out with those people because amen they they had something within them and they were a minister unto brother branam amen that's right so so the minister is an expression of the heart of God Amen you Mamas are an expression you wives are an expression you husbands we amen uh uh you preachers we you musicians whatever we are as a as a true minister of Jesus Christ we are ministering the heart of God Amen there and which can only come again from the Holy Ghost there in there in in U Romans 5 and 5 amen it says uh hope maketh not asham because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us now I begin to think uh love I I you know I talk about love a lot but amen love is is is is something that amen a gift can only be effective when it is ministered by love amen it it is it's it's it there's the only way that you're going to be overwhelmed with results is through love love for him and his love for you and the presence of God why is it because it's number one it's a Divine gift amen it's his gift in your life number two the Holy Spirit germinates that gift with his love amen the the the God is love that's what that's what the uh uh the Apostle John said he says God is love so as a minister there's one thing the minist ministry it is it is giving of something it is acting on the behalf of it is amen it is it is it is standing as that Ambassador we are ministering his love to those around us amen you Minister the love of Christ through your gift unto me I minister to you through the gift that God has given me can you say amen amen now love just cannot be displayed without results you cannot display love and not get results you cannot have the genuine love of God in your heart without it manifesting something within us can you say Amen oh truly when we really begin to think of who we really are as the body of Jesus Christ that you are an ambassador of redemption you are the heartthrob of God you are an extension of God here on the earth the the the perfect Lamb slain for an imperfect world Amen and God can only express that through his living body here on the earth oh hallelujah amen AR you did you understand that a a perfect lamb for an imperfect world and God has chose you to express those Eternal attributes can you say amen amen what is his what is his love towards us the Bible says that amen he says while we were yet sinners God died Christ died for the ungodly can you say Amen so love is the very Foundation someone had asked me the other day they said brother wend I I I would like to I I could you give me any pointers in Ministry and it got me to thinking well studying is good uh uh praying is good and and all of those things are good but all of those things are pretty well mechanical if the call or the feeling of love for the people is not there because it's not the desire to preach it's not the desire to sing it's a burning love and compassion for people that's what makes a Ministry a Ministry man I I it we know a lot of people that can preach really good but can they Minister we know a lot of people that can sing really good but can they minister to people you see you it's it's it the the the results the results come from a genuine heart no matter what the gift is it comes from a from something burning on the inside for People Ministry love people amen as God has reconciled you now he's given you a Ministry and you in Christ instead say be reconciled unto God can you say Amen so love God so loved that he gave he gave of himself willingly the Apostle Paul said amen to one of the churches he says I have been spent and I'm willing to be spent again amen he he said amen to galatia and uh you know he's he's a he's getting on to them a little bit because they backslid but then he says my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you you see there's something there I instead of sculling him and said come on man I gave you I gave you what it took and he did he did he said oh foolish Galatians who has Bewitched you that you would be moved from this soon from the gospel of Christ to another what what what what has caused you to turn around amen that was in Galatians the the first chapter but when he gets to the fourth chapter he says oh Galatians you're my children I love you and I I'm going to travail and I'm going to you give me a headache but I love you and I'm going to give of myself to you and I want to see Christ formed in you and I want you see it was the heartbeat of God being expressed because that's the way God is with every one of us God has been patient Time and Time and Time and Time and Time and Time and now the Apostle Paul through this gift uh has the has the ability has the responsibility to express that same love and compassion to God's Bride Can you say Amen you see amen you say oh brother Wendell how can I change this Godless world what what kind of a Ministry could do that if we had a great big Deliverance Ministry if brother brandom was here then then he could he could really do something brother brandham had his part he played his part and he's gone now he's waiting on you to finish your ministry you see oh but we got to have another big Ministry no the big Ministries are all gone right hallelujah amen now the one man Ministries is over a it's it's over now now back in the day God would raise great men like like uh uh you know Wigglesworth and he would raise these Great Men amen because he would find men that that that that that would yield to him and but you see where the Bride of Jesus Christ we've we've been given the book we've been given given a Ministry and he has told us that we must prophesy again amen we've we've been given something like the book of Acts had where it's not just a a man here or a man there but the church has come back in her position and she's got a Ministry that is great hallelujah amen but you see amen you've got to have faith in God and you've got to have faith in people well praise the Lord amen now you can't help people if you ain't got faith in people you you can't you can't you can't you won't labor for people if you don't have faith in them you you won't give of yourself and pray for them if you know they're just going to be scumbags that ain't going to take anything you're saying amen but you see but if you've got a faith in God and a faith to know that God has placed you here on this Earth with a purpose then you're willing to step up to the plate and say God you have put me in the people business and I'm going to give of myself and let you anoint me Faith Rises you up amen and you can start seeing the impossibility while there or the possibility while there's still an impossibility you can start seeing amen what God is going to do while they're still in the muck and the Meer you can still see those things and it energizes you because you know you're here with Divine call and purpose amen now Faith Faith you got to have that Faith amen you've got to have faith that you have what the world needs you've got to have faith that God will answer your prayers for others you you've got to have faith in that brother brother or sister amen that you're helping or that sinner that you're dealing with amen you've got to have faith that whatever you do God is going to bless it because you're standing there Hallelujah I'm not here biting my time I'm here with a purpose boys y'all sitting on this front row second row there amen you girls on this front row you're here with Divine Purpose there's Divine Purpose you were not placed here just to set on these pews but the scripture says faith can only work by what by love in order to have faith in God you've got to love him in order to have faith in people you've got to love them and you can't just say I love them you got to love them you can't just say I love them there there is something in you that is oozing out you're called to be a minister now it don't matter it don't matter whether you're the eye whether you're the nose whether you're the whe whe whether you're you're you're the you know the mouth peace it don't matter there's one thing it is all comes together with love love works it all love puts it all together love initiates it through the power of the Holy Holy Ghost can you say Amen now brother Brandon would say love the Lord with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all your strength and faith will accompany that love he says now notice Abraham had to love God to believe him and you you love him and more you love him the more faith you will accumulate amen so so so so Saints let just let me just put it the world is looking for ministers while you're thinking the world is going to reject your ministry the world is looking for ministers they're looking for someone to love them in fact the prophet would tell us he would say the world is dying for love the church is dying for love Jesus said you're the salt of the earth but if you lose if the salt has lost its savor it is henceforth good for nothing but to be trod under the feet of men and if the church has lost its divine revelation of the love of God it becomes a mock a stalk a stumbling block to the world so the ministry of Jesus Christ can only come through his body it can only come through you and through me it can cannot come through anybody else it can only come through his Earthly body which is the Bride of Jesus Christ you are the bride coming of Christ can I hear an amen but we've got to but love is what initiates that gift that is within in our lives amen the world needs to know that they matter the world needs to know that amen that you care enough to show it hey people in the church need to know that they matter amen I need to know that I matter you need to know that you matter come on church we all we we all need to know that we matter now amen you take the blind Mexican man and and and the healing and how that healing transpired there in there in Mexico that healing transpired amen from the love of one mortal to another mortal being now now I want you to catch this The Compassion from one mortal to another mortal being produced healing brother brandham says I remember one night there was an old Mexican dad come across the platform and he didn't have any shoes his trousers were all torn off and he had an old hat in his hand and sold up with twine cord no coat no shirt on Gray beard over his face and he was blind and he and I thought when he come that perhaps somebody's daddy maybe maybe the enemy's been so cruel to him the people in Mexico don't don't get to live like we do here their economics are are very poorly balanced so I looked at him and he and he got close to me he was Catholic by faith he took out a crucifix or a a prayer a prayer beads and begin to say his prayer uh over uh prayer beads over and I spoke to him that it wasn't necessary just then and he kept wanting to find me he was blind and when when I got my arms around the old fella I thought my if my daddy would have lived he would have been about the age of that man he was somebody's Daddy and there he was almost naked maybe had worked many a hard day to raise some little children and then besides all of that he was blind I had a good suit good pair of shoes I put my foot up to the side of his I was going to give him my shoes but his foot was larger than mine my showers nothing like like would me out with him I couldn't give him my coat I thought poor old fella and you know you have to enter into the suffering of a person to have feelings for them if I if I if it ever gets to a place that I can't feel sorry for the sick then it's time for me to leave the platform praying for them when I when I get to a place that I can't feel the burden of sin on the people then it's time for me to get away from here because I can never do no good for God it's the feeling you have for the people somebody say it's the feeling feeling you have for the people that's what makes a Ministry not a sermon the feeling you say well how how can I have feeling for the People by playing music your desire is to bring his presence down hallelujah what can you say Amen your desire to see the presence of God come upon that brother or sister then it don't matter whether you're behind the pulpit or not then it don't matter whether you're in church or not then it don't matter anything then it's a body that is working oh can you say Amen oh my Hallelujah I say this right now amen the the gift that you have is just as powerful and important as the gift of Malachi 4 the purpose for Malachi for was to turn your hearts back around so that God could put his ministry and bring his ministry to a living reality through you don't don't don't ever don't don't ever get to the point brother Donald Amen to where you think that you're uh you're you're witnessing the way you do and you calling and and and talking to the down and out and encouraging them and and and that that that it is it is minist you no God gave you that burden God placed that upon your life God gave you that love for people God gave that love it is a Ministry and it's just as important as my ministry as a pastor pastor's Ministry is no more important than the congregation's ministry we've all called with gifts and call ings in our lives can you say amen he says it's the feeling you have for the people he says you know it's a love that you project to the people that they know that you love them and they love you and you can feel it there's something that happens then and when I was praying for the old fellow a vision came and he had his head laying over on shoulders patting me when I was praying he couldn't understand what I was saying because he couldn't speak English but I was looking this way praying for him and as I opened my eyes brother esosa was repeating the prayer over in Spanish out to one side and I looked and I seen the old man just jumping in a vision with a sight I knew he had it then so I just pull him up like this and I believe the the Mexican word is Gloria deos something like that Glory of Glory to God and and that's it he hollered that way he could see he could see and down from the platform he went just jumping as hard as he could jump he could see it was a compassion oh God you see the gifts it's not an education it's it's not an education you kids is not an education I I I was blessed to pray for people when I was 12 and 13 years old and God healed them I didn't know that I had any kind of a gift of God in my life I just loved people and when I saw somebody hurting I prayed for him I'd slip over next to them and pray afterwards they they didn't know who it was was afterwards in the testimony service I would there would be like someone stand up and says the other night you mind somebody I just felt a warm hand touch me and God totally healed my shoulder God totally done this I was the little kid that done it I wasn't a big anybody but I was somebody that was swatting the power of the Holy Ghost living in me I had a gift in me there was a cry within me to help the people there was something in me that I wanted to express for him I didn't know quotes I didn't know much Bible all I know is I loved him and I loved people and God honored that can you say man you see The Compassion or the love for your fellow man d drives you if you never been there you'll never know it when I when I had met my wife and fell in love there wasn't anybody that understood that I loved her and my buddies sure didn't understand that amen and my sister didn't understand that and no nobody understood that but me and it was something that I just loved her can you say amen and and when you love God in such a way and you that call upon your life that that has been initiated by love now again it don't matter it don't matter whether you're Healing The Sick whether you're preaching whether you're a deacon whe whether you're a song leader whether whe whe whether you're you know cooking for the church or your family or or or or cleaning here at the it don't matter it's driven by love there's no keeping the score am mey you're not taking care of your family keeping the score you love them you give Ministry it's something that you're proud to do it's your family your call it's your okay you say amen and in the Church of the Living God it's not it's nothing that I that I have to do there's a love for me from me to you I want to express I want to give of myself I want to show who I am who you are that's part of who I am I'm ordained to be an ambassador of Jesus Christ it ain't a Pulpit Ministry I was born with it and the Holy Ghost has ignited it within me can you say Amen now it's because of the gift to the pull pit amen that I study amen I'm I I study out of a faith for the people I've got a confidence that there is a br that's going to make a Rapture and God's allowed me to be able to feed them God's allowed me to encourage them God's allowed me to tell them no the devil's lying you're going to make it I've been ordained for that I've been called for that I've been I've been placed here on this Earth for that therefore the love that I have found through the power of the Holy Ghost as causing that pastor's gift to operate in my life can you say Amen but the pastor is not is not the only one in the church can I hear hallelujah hallelujah yes we've all got our gifts now when that love is driving you for your fellow man you find out real quickly that it's not a union job how many's ever worked on the Union on a union job Hallelujah now now now now brother Merl he's he's a professional Union fell so I have to be careful at what I say because I don't have good things to say about Union guys but he was a good

you and right because we know that if he succeeds I succeed poor belly button done his job at the beginning and that's it he's just along for the ride to catch all the fuzz but he had his part well praise the Lord it was the belly button amen it was that Naval court that gave life to that to that baby for nine months that's right is that right oh God oh God this ministry of divine love this ministry this ministry I want Dylan to succeed I want Dylan to succeed more than I want myself to succeed I want Dylan to rise Amen in the power of the Holy Spirit I want the power of God that told me one time he says listen I want you to excel me I want you to out preach me I want you to out sing me I want you to do that for every generation is to grow stronger and greater unto the coming of the lord well that's one that's a good teacher I'm not in competition I'm not in competition with any of our preachers Around Here My Dear Lord I want our preacher to succeed I want our preachers to go around the world preaching this Gospel of Jesus Christ can you say Amen but many times we look at the preachers and we feel amen that we don't we don't fit amen but doing your ministry out of love and taking care of your family and your children did you know the brother that's a quote that brother Brenham says amen some were predestinated to be a plumber some were for ordained to be a preacher some were for ordained to be a farmer some are for ordained to be Housewives to take care of their family he says and at the end of the day you'll get the same reward because it's Ministry can you say Amen you see amen we do we do whatever we need amen love drives you to do whatever is required love drives you to step up if it's to mle the lawn or uh you know mo mo an Elder's lawn or or or you know I I hear I hear some of you you ladies are are are are helping you know feeding sister Angie this week and and and uh you know uh we cleaning a house house or or doing something it's a Ministry from the earth there's something within us that are driving us for one another we love one another and it creates a Minister's heart praise the Lord now only the Holy Ghost can do that because we found out that there in 1 Corinthians the 14th chapter that you can give your body to be burned and not have love you can give all of your goods to the poor and not have love you can do all of that in other words it's a showman it's something to be seen amen and that's where us preachers have got to be careful make sure we ain't just amen servants because we're up here to be seen it's got to be right here I love servants heart for the people can you see man he says you can have all of that but you have not charity then it profits you nothing praise the Lord but when the Holy Ghost places that you become burdened and we don't just become burdened I'm I'm I'm I'm I've got a few more pages here and then I'm going to close you don't just become burdened for Saint it's not for just us for and no more but we become burdened for sa an Center we become burdened we're God's Minister somebody say I'm a minister of God to the people it don't matter whether they're sinner or they're Saint it don't matter whether they love me or they don't it don't matter whether they do good to me or they do bad to me it don't matter whether they can Minister back to me whether I'll get anything in return or not it that's that matter just so long as I am fulfilled and brother there is nothing that can fulfill a man with a Ministry there is nothing that can fulfill that man like like reaching out and helping the hurting and encouraging the weary it don't matter what he gets back that man is fulfilled don't matter whether he's living in a in a in a in a big sty it don't matter whether he's driving a nice car or or not car he's fulfilled when he is helping people While others are putting money in the bank buying land looking to grow their portfolio a minister has got his mind and heart on people you say well that excludes me I no you're a minister the holy spirit in you see SS everywhere whether it's a boy or girl maybe all they need is a little ride on their bike and they're struggling because of the ministering Spirit within you you want to help him whether it's an old man trying to get across the road the word or the Holy Spirit within you you're a minister it don't matter whether you're at church it don't matter whether you're out of your post you have a love for people it don't matter where you are Ministry is who you are you don't have to go to India you don't have to go to Russia you don't have to go to Africa you're a minister you're a minister you you're fulfilled because you're giving of yourself oh can you say man you see brother window how how can that be H how how can it be you see you have the end product in mind some Waters some Souls some reaps but it's God who gives that increase can you say Amen you man have notice Paul there in 1 Corinthians 9 and6 he's feeling the weight of his call upon his life and I watch how he handled that gift and this is something that I've tried to put into action within my own personal life over the years and that's there in uh uh there in 1 Corinthians 9:16 for though I preach the gospel I have nothing to Glory of for necessity is laid upon me y wo is unto me if I preach not the gospel for I do this willingly I have a reward but if against my will a disp ens ation of the Gospel is committed unto me in other words I I know my place I'm the Apostle to the Gentiles and if I don't fulfill this I'm going to have to answer he says what is my reward then verily that when I preach the gospel I may make the gospel of Christ without charge that I abuse not my power the gospel for though I be free from all men yet have I made myself servant unto all now watch watch is coming out of him watch him that I might gain and everything that I'm doing everything that I'm doing I've got souls in my mind everything that I'm doing I've got a purpose I've got a strategy I made myself a servant so that I can gain the more and then he tells us how he does it unto the Jews I become as a Jew that I might gain the Jews to them them are under the law as under the law that I might gain them that are under the law to them that are without the law as without being not without the law to God but under the law to Christ that I might gain them that are without the law to the weak became I as weak that I may gain the weak I have made all things to all men that I by all means might save some and this I do for the gospel's sake that I might be partakers thereof with you can you say Amen what would this mean to us that means sometimes we get on the kids' level and we let those kids get confidence in us and we we love them and we place value upon them what are we doing I love all of you kids and the reason the reason that I let you kids know that I love you it's because I want you kids to love me and I want you to trust me when I tell you about Jesus I want you to know that I'm very real that I'm very sincere we walked in to the store today and there's this Holiness woman and and then her daughter with her L looked to me like she was in her 30s you know not Holiness cut hair and and we've seen a lot of that I'm sure you have or we've seen a lot of it in the apostolic churches and also in the Holiness the the trinitarian Holiness circles and more so in the trinitarian Holiness circles they preach all the dos and the don'ts they get up and they don't and and and and and there's and and there there there is that something that they are talking about we we we've lost the younger generation and I thought somebody somewhere somebody somewhere Ministry escaped somewhere they're gone they're out the doors but it does my heart good to see people here in the church that still understand that you have a Ministry and those of us with wward children we know that we're applying the token and every one of them's coming back home that's right it's a Ministry sister Stephanie's not here but these babies is not just something that's pwned off on on on Stephanie it's a Ministry this is not something that's just pawned off just something to give somebody something to do to brother Harry it's a Ministry the youth Gatherings Kobe and Mary it's a Ministry we're investing in the lives we're putting ourselves and for you those of you that came to the wedding the other day to support these kids instead of out hunting or whatever you know golfing or whatever you could be doing but you were here to support it was a Ministry those who bake the pies and for the pie auction and those who gave amen you remember what it was like when you were a kid starting out and you gave out of your own need to help these kids because they meant something to you you ain't saying I love you from from from you know a distance be warm be cloth be fed you gave of yourself because everywhere you look is Ministry your heart isn't about you your heart is for people you love Ministry oh I'm sorry that I ended up this way here I was this is supposed to be an encouraging message I feel what I'm saying ministers there ain't too many ministers left in the world there's not too many there's not too many ministers that'll put their schedule on hold so that they can be a blessing to somebody else they're wrapped up in me and mine what will you do when you stand before God and give an account for your life Jesus looked at the disciples he says the day will come there in Matthew 25 and 35 he said I was hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came to me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee to drink when did we see you a stranger and took you you in naked and clothed thee when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and Jesus and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as you have done it unto one of the least of my brethren you have done it unto me the rewards it was so it was it was so part of them that they didn't even know that they got it it was so part of their inner being this is not something you can teach yourself it's not something that you can you can say a preacher can get up and and say you got to do this and you got to do this and you got to do this and you say yes sir now I'm going to be a minister no it's something that only the Holy Spirit can do right here and brother brandom says they done it so unconsciously they just done it because they seen a need they just done it because somebody asked for help they just done it because they wanted to be a blessing and Jesus says when you've done it to me or you done it to them you you've done it to me oh Jesus you see brother Brenham would put this and he talked about Israel going through horri on their journey and he says now that's name horb means a dry place or a desert he says that's when we get out of fellowship with one another in the church and out of the blessing or the fellowship with the holy spirit that brings us to a dry place a desert and nothing alive everything got stickers on it a little piece of cactus with a sticker on it did you know what it is that's a precious little Tender Leaf that hasn't got no water it's just wound itself up so tight that it's a sticker and when you see somebody like that maybe it's a precious soul that could be water Ed right would have been a tender little leaf or something but instead it's wound up till it's a sticker just punching at everything and you know Finding fault and only only thing it needs is just some water it just needs a Revival or a breaking up a refreshing from the Lord and it'll unfold its little self if you just put some water to it but that's where them who live in that place has to suffer with the conditions of that place those who desire to live in that kind of an an atmosphere of where everything's just punching and fussing and whirling and stewing and you'll just live under that atmosphere that's all but we don't have to live there it's not necessary for us to live there can you say Amen how many wants you say oh brother when if I was just gifted if God would just use me you don't just have a gift but he gave severally God has given gifts to each of us you matter the devil telling you well my praying don't matter you tell that devil to get back to hell where he came from devil telling you that you don't have a Ministry you tell that sorry thing to get back to hell where he came from Satan has tried to squeeze your love for people and tried to squeeze your love for this word and amen your ministry it's time to tell that devil you will not block this is the bride will have a Ministry it will be a powerful Ministry it's not a Onan Ministry it will be as the prophet would say a body bride body Ministry it requires every one of us but no matter the gift the common denominator is love shed abroad in our heart Hearts by the Holy Ghost that's the common denominator can you say Amen no I came to the conclusion a long time ago I would not be a big time Pastor although I had those dreams Allelujah I showed when I graduated we had from high school we had the tssa world out there they did and um so they were taking pictures and they wrote this deal about me and uh this young man sung soulfully when he prayed it was as if he has talked to God before and I'm Going H yes so they interviewed me and they asked they asked me what what what are your dreams well my instructor was a little bit disappointed because he wanted me to talk about his school and the electrical program I didn't I mean the first thing came to my mind was is Souls I told him I'm want to be an evangelist I'm going to win thousands I'm going to preach Hallelujah and I'm telling the I'm I'm I'm just a 16year old kid and uh so we found that newspaper article here sometime back I sh the boys Caleb looked at that and looked at me and looked at that and then looked back at me and says what happened Dad ain't quite I ain't quite made it there but that's all right God ain't called me for that and God ain't called me for that I'm in the people business God's called me to set captives free God's called me to heal the brokenhearted I don't know I've been preaching on preachers lately I've been thinking along these lines I've been thinking how we need people how people of PA need to hear this message of Jesus Christ you go around town and you see so many of these these kids and it's easy to say all like that Thug but do they know anything about Jesus you understand see the only thing that can truly help them and the only way I can have faith in humanity again is for me to have a love for me to love those people and want to help those people are you understanding if I'm missing the faith in them and the missing the faith in what God oh it's easy for us to say the door is closing we just ain't got no more just going to have to hear amen but brother there's still a soul somewhere [Applause] I know we got excited here a while back when a family came we thought oh yes but we got to keep right on we got to keep right on a sharing we got to keep right on it giv I'm preaching to me too but I'm saying we've all got that gift can you say amen God bless you here this evening are we going to do it it ain't going to be being spiritual to one another matters of fact you're going to deal with each other in the flesh and the spirit a lot more than you're going to deal with each other in the soulless real hallelujah sister Angie ain't needing her soul safe tonight amen sister Lona had or or or somebody cooked she you cooked her supper last night man someone had to fix her supper tonight but you're taking care of one of God's little ones right you said well Ministry is only good when you're preaching the word no no no no [Music] Ministry is a body fitly framed together and US carrying enough for somebody else to get out of our stinking comfort zone and love somebody else like you haven't done in a long time ministry is serving someone else I don't care whether you're getting up in the middle of the night to go hug a bubble a boy across the across town it's missing a daddy and crying and you have to hold him till he falls asleep I don't care if you happen to help prostitutes I don't care if you having whatever it is don't let me just be centered here are you hearing me I try my best I ask the Lord Lord help me Lord give me somebody give me somebody that'll trust me somebody that'll love me that I so I can lead him to Salvation can you say Amen we don't have to go do those kinds of things outside the doors I got a news flash for you as I'm closing some of you are saying if I could just do away with people they just make me nervous without people you have no Ministry go back and what read what Jesus said the spirit of the Lord God is upon me he hath anointed me not to sit on a mountain and have a holy Comm he already had Holy Communion between him and God he had to go come down to earth he had to come down to people he had to come down to those that didn't like him he ate with Sinners he was despised healing people and delivering them when he knew good and well doing it on the Sabbath day he was going to be kicked out of the synagogue but he loved people he looked out there one day and he said he starts crying he says I see all of these people as sheep with no Shepherd and then the scripture says and he was moved with compassion over the multitudes because they didn't have a Shepherd they were lost you are his body you are his body here on the earth can you say am man as I close musicians come the shemite woman she was always serving Elijah Elijah was her pastor and he she just loved she loved her pastor and brother Brenham said she had realized that Elijah was a servant of God and when they would come by that way she'd always try to do him a little favor try to be kind of him to him if there's anything that we ought to be it's kind to one another when you see a brother or sister in a fault don't don't never never breathe it to nobody keep it to yourself pray for that person be kind to them and if the spirit of God is in you then you will be kind to one another Jesus said I come to do the will thy will father where about the Master's business as he was about the father's business and the spame spirit that he had to begin the works of the father and to finish the atonement to make a way that we could carry the message it's that Spirit that's in you you'll have the same attitude towards people trying to do what you can to help them no matter who they are where they are you'll try to help people amen that's kind of strong but that's the truth that's right rather friends that the time has come that we're nearing the end and something's got to be done we've got to have rapturing faith right away now but he goes on and he he begins to talk about how that little lady had talked to her husband and said he comes and he's so tired so weary she said can we build a little room for him can we build a room that way we'll put a little bowl in there and a bed and a little Basin and chair that way he can come and rest and God seen that God seen she wasn't the one healing she wasn't the prophet she wasn't the one doing all of that she was simply the one helping she didn't have the vision she didn't have the word of God she wasn't the pastor all she was is just wanted to give courage and strength and [Music] support and she got the prophet's [Music] reward brother Brandon would stop and he would say it pays to be friends with a prophet I look at all of us here [Music] tonight as I'm sensing the time of the end is upon us you know you won't get in so much trouble in sin if you're [Music] busy you won't get in so much trouble this way and that way if you're about the father's business how many wants to make a commitment to him tonight say [Music] Lord the gift that you
