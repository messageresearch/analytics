and um we um are thankful for for these uh for these churches and and for the Revelation that God gave us and so we're going to read tonight there start off in in Revelations the first chapter and um um we will start there at the 19th verse and um we're sure glad to hear of uh s sister's uh Angie's testimony and uh we've been praying about that for a long time and so we're so thankful to the Lord for that and so we're rejoicing with you there there in Revelations 1 and 19 says write the things which thou Hast seen and the things which are the things which shall be Hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches and we're just going to read that and then go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you today for your many blessings that you have given us thank you for your anointing Lord enjoyed the songs of worship tonight enjoyed the special and father we we appreciate your presence with us Lord we we want to sing to you but Lord we also want to hear from you and I'm asking Lord that you would spend the send the spirit of Revelation to us and that your blessings would be upon your word and as we read the Church hbook Father we give ourselves to you and Lord you see sister Denise Lord that's that's struggling in the hospital you see the all the these different needs that's already been brought before you we're just asking Lord that you would be with every one of them and father we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here tonight and um so uh we are going to uh start this evening in uh on page 188 now last week we we talked about the um about the three gods and um how that it is Pagan worship and um and how that the Trinity did not start with the Bible and so uh the Bible is not the originator of worshiping three gods and um in fact the Bible says hero Israel the Lord our God is one Lord he is one one alone so but tonight we're going to be reading and um and so we're going to find where the first organized Church came from from so um uh we're going to start getting in a little bit of the the meat of the of of what the church ages is about and um and so we can understand that the first church age was there was an anointing uh the power of God it was God living in bodies and it was many bodies that made up one body so the Apostle Paul would say many me MERS but one body so just as your body uh I don't know how many how many parts do they say that we have how many bones I the human body has um we got a lot of parts but together we make up one body and so it has been uh in in each of the church church ages amen we have the group of us that is right here tonight we're a we're there's many bodies here here then there's bodies in Claremore there's bodies in brother Sams there's bodies you know uh amarel and and so these these bodies amen all make up they we're called members each one of us are all members of one body so then we've got the church ages and so um the church ages is is divided up into seven sections seven seven periods and so these periods of time are is is specific things that God is wanting us to look at to see these are prophecies that are coming to pass and so what we are seeing what we're going to start reading tonight is we're going to find that God fora predicted and told uh when that that the Catholic church was going to come and these other denominational systems were going to come and we're going to find that it was Satan behind it so this is you got to get your thinking caps on your Revelation caps because we we can understand that God is not interested in churches he's interested in people the churches are going to as we're going to read tonight going to fall away their doctrines are going to be off but God loves his elect and so um so we're going to be in the third period this is that we're in the uh panian Church age and so we we've we've talked about how it started in in the book of Acts uh they're on the day of Pentecost and it's just slowly been waning away and so um we want to start here and finish off last week's uh they're on page 188 we're going to start here at the at the second paragraph it says Not only was ancestor worship uh originated in Babylon but so also was worship of nature it was in Babylon the Gods uh were identified with the sun and moon Etc the chief object in nature was the sun which has liiving and Heat giving properties and appears to man as a ball of fire in the heavens thus the chief God would be the sun god whom they called Baal often the sun was depicted as a circle of flame and soon uh around that flame there appeared a serpent and it wasn't long until the serpent become the symbol of the Sun and consequently worship thus the desire of Satan's heart became full-fledged he was worshiped as God his throne was established his slaves bowed to him and there there in pergamus in the form of a living serpent he was worshiped the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil now symbolized in the form of a living serpent had not only seduced Eve but the majority of mankind how did pergamus become the seat of Satan if Babylon was the seat and now we went through Babylon last week remember it says the answer again is in history when Babylon fell to the mes and Persians the priest king adelus left the c or fled the city and went to pergamus with his priest and sacred Mysteries there he set up his kingdom outside the Roman Empire and thrived under the care of the devil this has uh been a very short resume of the history of the babylonish religion and its event to pergamus many questions are are no doubt left unanswered and much more no doubt could have been said to Enlighten us but this is not in uh is not intended to be a study of history rather it is intended to be a help to understand or to study the word the denunciation Revelations 2:14 through 15 but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught Balo to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate in this panian church age the Lord denounces two doctrines which he hates number one the doctrine of balum which was uh which brought idolatry and sinful excesses to Israel at B pror number two the doctrine of the nicians which had been but deeds in the Ephesian age combine this denouncement with the fact that he has been emphasizing per pergamus as the seed of Satan and it is very easy and proper to conclude that somehow the religion of Babylon has been intermingled with with Christianity now this is not merely an assumption but an a historical fact which we will prove by going back into history to about 36 ad and coming up to the nin Council of 325 when the Christians mainly Jews by birth were scattered abroad from Jerusalem they went everywhere preaching the gospel particularly in the synagogues thus within 3 years or about uh or about in 36 ad the gospel had been taken to Rome by Junius and Andrus uh andronicus or whatever who according to uh uh Romans 16 and 7 were Apostles they the work flourished there for several years until the constant altercations of the Jews amongst themselves caused the emperor Claudius to expel them from Rome with the Jews banished uh from that City the backbone of that little church was practically broken perhaps even the elders had been Jewish so would and and so would be gone the flock would be unattended and since the word had not been written as a guide it would be very easy for this little flock to drift and be unated by the or inundated by the philosophers and the pagans of the day with Grievious wolves on the prow the spirit of the Antichrist released we find from history that this little church in Rome became hopelessly backslidden and begin to introduce Pagan ceremonies under Christian titles as the period of banishment lasted for 13 years the founders Junius and and Andrus did not come back until 54 ad imagined their horror to find a church with a Christian title that was woefully Pagan there were altars in the church upon which they placed incense and celebrated Pagan rights the established leaders of that church could not be approached so with the few who had tried to remain faithful they started a new church or the second Church of Rome and God graciously worked among them by signs and wonders so that a third church was started and though the first church was reproached for being Pagan and not Christian in its worship it would not give up its title but remain Still Remains and Still Remains The First Church of Rome the Roman Catholic Church now the majority of us have the mistaken identity that any who called themselves Christians would be the target of the devil and consequently the brunt of governmental tyranny but that is not so the first church had begun to thrive and multiply so in numbers that the Emperors and various officials of the government actually favored that church for political reasons thus when the church when the leaders of the first church in Rome found themselves in favor they took the opportunity to turn the government against the True Believers and demand their persecution unless they come into their fold one such Bishop of the First Church of Rome was anaus who lived in the 2 century and was a contemporary with polycarp and when the venerable polycarp heard the First Christian Church of Rome was involved in Pagan ceremonies and had corrupted the truth of the Gospel he went there to implore them to change he saw them prostrate themselves before images and named after the apostles and Saints he saw them light candles and burn incense on altars on the altar he saw them celebrate the Passover under the name of Easter where they elevated the disc shaped bread that honored the son God and then they poured the wine out as a uh liation to the gods but this age Saint who had traveled 1500 miles could not arrest their downward plunge God spoke to him just as he was leaving Ephraim is married to his idols let him Al alone Hosea 4:15 and polycarp never more returned following anus an am I saying that right anicetus was the wick Wicked Bishop of Rome called Victor he introduced even more Pagan festivals and ceremonies into the first church and also went about about trying his utmost to persuade the true Christian Church to incorporate the same ideas they would not do so as he requested so he prevailed upon the government officials to persecute the Believers hailing them into court casting them into prison even meeting out death to many such an example of his vile Deeds is found in history where the emperor Septimus uh Severus was was prevailed upon by cestatus the vi the friend of Victor to kill 7,000 at thessalonica because these True Believers celebrated the Passover according to the Lord Jesus and not according to the worship of a started already the false Vine was turning loose its anger against the Living God by killing the elect even as did its forebear Cain killed Abel the true church kept trying to get the first church to repent it would not do so it increased in size and influence it embarked upon constant campaign to discredit the true seed they claimed that they and they alone were the true representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ and vaulted the fact that they were the original Church in Rome that they alone were the first church indeed they were the first church and indeed they are thus by the time that this third Church age of this third Church age we have two churches bearing the same name but with a bitter difference between them one has departed from the truth married idols and has no life in her she has hybridized herself and the signs of death and not life follow in her way she is powerful with many members she is favored by the world the other is a little persecuted group but she follows the word and the signs follow her the sick are healed the dead are raised she is alive with the life and word of God she loves not her life but holds to his name and his faith even unto death and so the terrible persecution of official Rome fell upon the True Believers until Constantine arose and granted freedom of religious worship there seemed to be two reasons why this Freedom was granted in the first place various good Emperors had uh had not allowed persecution but as they passed on they were followed by those who killed the Christians it was so senseless that it finally came to a public heed that the Christians ought to be left alone the second and best noted reason is that Constantine had a very or had a difficult very difficult battle ahead of him in taking over control the control of the Empire One Night in a dream he saw a white cross appear before him he felt that this was an omen unto him and that if the Christians prayed for a victory for him he would win that battle he promised freedom for them in in the event that he was Victorious he was Victorious and the freedom of worship was granted in the Edict of nantis in in 312 ad but this freedom from persecution and death was not as magnimous as it first appeared Constantine was now the patron as a patron his interest was somewhat more than of an zerber for he decided that the church needed his help in her aairs he had seen them disagreeing over various matters one of which involved Aras the bishop of Alexander who taught his adherence that Jesus was not truly God but a lesser being having been created by God the western church held the opposite view believing that Jesus was the very essence of God and as they said co-equal with the father with with such matters along with the intrusion of the Pagan ceremony and worship the emperor called for the n Council in 3:25 with the thought that he would bring all groups together where they could iron out their differences and come to a common understanding and all would be one isn't it peculiar that though this started with Constantine it didn't die but as very much alive today as the World Council of churches where he failed to truly achieve it it will be achieved in this day through the economical ecumenical move now this interference of the state with the church is a foolish thing for the world does not understand either the truth found in the word or the ways of the church why the very decision handed down by the Council of Aras was uh that Aras was wrong was reversed two years later by the emperor and for many years that false Doctrine was voed upon the people but that church and state would come together was truly forn of the Lord for the very name pergamus means thoroughly married isn't that something indeed State and church were married politics and religion were United The Offspring of the Union have been consistently uh with the most hor horrible hybrids the world has ever seen the truth is not in them but all the ways all the evil ways of Cain the first hybrid Is Not only was the State and church wedded in this age but the Babylonian religion was officially joined to the first church Satan now had access to the name of Christ and he was enthroned as God In Worship with the help of the federal aid the churches fell air to beautiful buildings which were lined with halters of white marble and images of The Departed Saints and and right in this age is when the Beast of Revelations 13:3 that was wounded to death the Pagan Roman Empire came back to life and the power of the Holy Roman as the power of the Holy Roman Empire Rome as a material Nation had suffered much depletion and soon would suffer it completely it but it mattered not now for her religious Empire would keep her on top of the world governing from inside where she would not appear to do so from the outside let me show you the the exact scriptural truth of this matter for I do not want anyone to think that I'm giving a revelation of my own one not found in scripture but Daniel 2 31-45 thou O King sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent and stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was a fine gold and his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands which smok the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to Pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broken into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floor and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smoke the image become a great mountain and filled the whole earth this is the dream and we will tell thee the interpretation thereof before the king thou Old King are a king of kings for the Lord God hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory and wheresoever the children of of men dwell the Beast of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold and after thee there shall rise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third Kingdom of brass which shall rule over all the earth and the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron ir and and as iron that breakthe shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou sawest the feet and Toes part of The Potter's clay and part of the iron a part of iron the the kingdom shall be divided and there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with the Mary clay and as the toes of the feet were part iron and part clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken whereas thou sawest iron mixed with myy Clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men and they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou sawest the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof is sure here in is revealed an an exact account of the future unpar unfulfilled history that was prophesied to come upon the Earth from the time of Daniel until Jesus would come and reign as the son of David it is known as the time of the Gentiles it had within it four historical divisions which were known by the den the the dominating Empire in each division Babylonian middle Persian Grecian and Roman the greatest and absolute uh monarchy was the babylonius which was typified as the head of G the next in the glory was the meadow Persian which is history bore out that was truly less glorious and was typified as breast and arms of silver then there followed the Grecian age whose uh King was the most brilliant of all military leaders the world had ever known and so it was fittingly typified as the belly and thighs of brass it was less glorious than the other two preceding it and finally the last kingdom was the Roman Empire typified in as the legs and feet wherein the former kingdoms were typified as pure Metals pure gold pure silver brass the last empire was pure iron only in the legs and when it came to the feet it was a mixture of iron and clay and mineral and soil just don't mix and produce consistency and strength but not only is this so but most amazingly the last empire which was the Roman would endure in its peculiar mixed state right up until Jesus returns the Roman Empire of iron iron signifies power great destructive force against opposition was made was to be made of two main divisions it was certainly and it certainly was for the Empire literally split in two the east and west both were very powerful crushing all before them but as the glory and power of all Empires fell so this Empire begin to fall also thus Rome fell Pagan Imperial Rome was no longer iron she crumbled she was wounded to death Rome could not now rule it was all over so thought the world but but wrong the world how wrong the world was for the head Rome though wounded was not wounded unto death the whis translation of Revelations 133 it reads one of these heads appeared to be mortally wounded the throat having been slashed and his death stroke was healed and the whole earth followed after the wild beast in amazement amen so how are we doing so far now are we are we catching now we so we're we're understanding that that through the the the Gentile history uh we we went from Babylon and then we we come down to uh uh the meal Persian then we come down to Greece then we come down to Rome now this was the world Empires that has come the last the last great world Empire was the Roman Empire and so so as we just read here that was that was uh when when Jesus was was uh born they were born under the Roman Empire and so uh that they they were the world leader now so it's it was showing that Rome was going to die just as these others that it would that it would die and that it would not have any effect anymore so the the Rome died years ago you know Greece Greece there's it's you know it's still there but it's not a world Empire Rome is not a world Empire anymore we've got you know now the United States would be considered the world leader um if you wanted to uh you know put it like that but we but Rome it when it looked like it was going to die the scripture predicted that it was going to rise back up again that it's its head was going to be healed and it was going to come back not as not not as the Roman Empire but now it would be the paple Rome not Pagan Rome but paple Rome it would come under the name of Christian and it would rule the world again Rome rules the world today through its religion Rome came up with the Trinity or uh introduced the Trinity put it in the in the Christian Church Rome is the first organized Church all all of these other denominations these these 30,000 however many denominations there are they have all came out of Mama which is the Roman Catholic church so so we can we can what we're reading here is that this is the beginning this is when Rome the First Church of Rome the Catholic church was born this is where it came from and so the first church now and I you got to understand we got all of these denominations and they all look so good and every one of them baptize in in in the Catholic baptism right every denomination most every denomination I'd say 99% of them all baptized in in uh in the titles of the Catholic church so so we can we can see how that it has all become pretty today it's all been so mingled up today and it all just sort of looks we're just accepting of everybody but this is the birth of that church and they put they put 68 million Christians to death the Roman Catholic Church throughout its history put 68 million Christians to death for not adhering to its doctrines it was trying to force what happened as he is talking about the marriage between the church and the state is the Roman Church they had they had made it so beautiful and the pagans so much that they started attracting all of these Kings and they all just came in and and and uh become very wealthy people and and so the these Kings would be given Promises of of of eternal life and be given Promises of all of these things and the protection of the Catholic church if they would allow the church uh to take over and become the this the state religion so this is how they ruled they ruled for almost a millennium they ruled for almost a thousand years over all of the Earth and they did not have a country of their own they simply used Kings as pwns so that their religion would would be the only religion allowed and they would kill you put you to death this is the Catholic church folks this is the Christian this is this is the Pagan Christian church and and so it ruled the world for a thousand almost a thousand years before uh uh before Martin Luther came in so so this is the beginning this is the empy this is where this is where the church is being that church is being established are y'all with me all right so um let's continue to read there in um in 195 if people look at Rome they look at the nation of Italy and as they look they do not realize that Rome with their strict confines where the where the pope has an actual area as his domain is is literally a nation within a nation she has ambassadors and receives ambassadors paple false Christian Rome she is even called The Eternal City how Blasphemous Now controls by religion even more ably than when Pagan Imperial Rome controlled by the rule of iron of force by the by the pure iron of force Rome took on a new lease of life when Constantine joined church and state and back the Union by force the spirit that motivated Pagan Rome is the same spirit that now motivates false Christian Rome you can see that it is so that that it is so because you know how that the fourth Empire never went out of existence it just changed in its outer texture once the NC Council had swung the power of political Rome to the church it seemed that there were no limits to uh to which the First Christian Church would go the name Christian which originally brought persecution now became the name of the persecutors it was in this age that ainstein of hoo 354 to 430 set forth the precept that the church ought and must use Force if necessary to bring her children back into the F now now this is the way they taught it now now listen to this that it was in harmony with the word of God God to kill the Heretics and the apostates in his controversy with uh dontine with with the donst he wrote it is indeed better that men should be led to worship God by teaching them than should be driven to it by fear of punishment or pain but it does not follow that because the former course produces the better man therefore who does therefore those who do not yield to it should be neglected for many have found Advantage as we have proved and are daily proven by actual experience in being first compelled by fear or pain so that they might afterwards be influenced by its teachings so that they might follow out in act what they had already learned in word whilst those are better who are guarded a right by love those are certainly more numerous who are corrected by fear for who can possibly love us more than Christ who laid down his life for the Sheep yet after calling Peter and the other Apostles by his words alone he came to summon Paul and he not only constrained him with his voice but he dashed him to the Earth with his power that he might forcibly bring one who is Raging amidst the darkness of infidelity to desire the light of heart he first struck him with a physical blindness of eyes why therefore should not the church use force in compelling her lost Sons to return the Lord himself says go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in wherefore if the power which the church is received by Divine appointment in its due season through the religious character and the faith of Kings be the instrument by by which those who are found in the highways and hedges that is in the heresies and schisms are compelled to come in then let them not be found fault with being compelled now that's that's that was their teachings I was now that's the way they believed either you accept it by free will or we will we will torture you we will rip babies out that's when the babies were all ripped out of the bellies that's when and and just just to get people to recant their pure faith in Jesus Christ the Catholic Church would burn him to the Stak they would they would do all of those things there to try to get the church the G the true Christian Church to bow to the heresies of the Roman Catholic Church to bow to the idols to bow to the Purgatory to bow to these Heathen things that they had brought in from the other Pagan uh uh all the way down to Babel as we read last week so so these guys were were were out and and it and it brought such fear upon all of the earth that that the true Christians went into hiding they went into the catacombs that's when you where you read the catacombs and and those places there were there were there were thousands of Christians that were hiding and and uh living living uh in in secret because they feared for their lives the majority of the world bowed to this Roman Catholic Church I just want to tell you the gospel is not a gospel of force God doesn't GE Force no person to serve him and any spirit that is going to force you whether it's sitting in the pews trying to force the preacher to I don't like whether you're doing this I don't like the way or the preacher up forcing the congregation you're going to see it this way and you're going to see it any if there is a spirit of force it's not the spirit of God true God does not use a whip he is not a cowboy to to round up the cattle he is a shepherd and my sheep will hear my voice and follow me amen so so there it is God Is Not the god of force he is a God that knows that you who you are and you should know who he is and you should follow his word amen amen all right praise the Lord now um so let's read another page how about it it says says the thirst for blood was growing a paste now we're still on 196 first paragraph the the false Vine in Spain now played upon the emperor Maximus to join in the attacks upon the true believers who had the word and the signs and wanders with them thus some Pilan were brought to Travis by Bishop ethicus there in 385 he accused them of Witchcraft immorality and many were executed Martin of Tours Ambrose of Malon protested this and pleaded in vain for the persecution to cease when the persecution was prolonged these two Bishops refused to fellowship with Bishop uh Hiatus and others like him strange to say uh the the Senate of Travis approved of the murders from this time on especially through the Dark Ages we will see the children of the flesh persecute and destroy the children of the spirit though both claim one father even as was in the case of ishma and Isaac the darkness of the spiritual corruption will deepen and the True Light Of God will fade until number-wise it glows ever so faintly yet the promise of God will hold true the light shineth in the darkness and the Darkness can do nothing about it now up to this time I have not brought out the point in history that I promis to cover that is the interner Mingle of religion of nimrod and the Christian religion you will recall that adelus fled from Babylon to pergamus and set up his kingdom outside the reaches of the Roman Empire it flourished over the years nurtured by the God of this world a succession of priest Kings followed adlas until the reign of adlas III uh when for reasons known only in the sovereignty of God he willed the kingdom to Rome Julius Caesar then took both the kingdom physical and spiritual for he became pontiff Maximus of the babylonish religion and was therefore priest king this title passed on to the following Emperors until the time of Maximus 3 who refused it according to Steven's history it was then that the pope took the headship the emperor rejected and today there is still a pontiff in the world and he is truly pontiff Maximus he wears a Triple Crown resides in Rome and in Revelation 17 God does not any longer refer to pergamus as Satan's seat nor does he say that is where Satan dwells no the throne room is no longer in pergamus but is M but is Mystery Babylon it is in it is not in Babylon but in mystery Babylon it is a it is in a city on Seven Hills its head is Antichrist for he is usurp the position of Christ who alone is mediator and who alone can forgive sins yes pontiff Maximus is with us today so so you can see how how that it has all come about and um and you can see how that how that this thing has has been so so incredible and and see that the scriptures are are so right on the money with history it predicted these things were going to happen and and that it does now I would um uh let let me just show you a scripture here where I um here in in the Book of Revelations the 17th chapter and um and show you how that all of these other denominations were going to come out of this and so um if you look there at Revelations the 17th chapter and um uh you can you can read uh this this is prophesying of this of of this church that would commit fornication be the false Church she would be called a here and she's committed fornication with all the kings of the world and says start at the first verse and there came one of the Seven Angels which had seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither and I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that Seth upon many Waters what is many Waters y'all remember way back when peoples multitudes Nations is that right with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me in the spirit Into the Wilderness what do Babylonian Babylon Babylon means Wilderness confusion I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns and the woman was array in purple and scarlet color decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of the Abomination and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the Earth I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints 68 million of them with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wandered with great admiration and the angel said unto me wherefore just thou Marvel I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman and of the Beast that carried her which had the seven heads and the 10 horns okay so now he's he's he's this is this is where he's going to tell us now he's going now he's going to tell us what the what the seven heads were and he going to tell us exactly what this is going to be we'll read this and then U then we'll finish up and it's and it's going to point to Rome did you know that that the Catholic church that Rome brags that it is the city on Seven Hills did y'all know that that's what that's what the Roman Church brags about let's look here in scripture the Beast that thou sawest was not and is not now that's the power that's the fourth world power that brother brandham uh that we just read shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was is not and yet is the Roman Empire is dead but it's been revived in papal Rome all right here is the mind which has wisdom the seven heads are the seven mountains on which the woman sits and there are seven Kings five are Fallen one is the other is not yet come and when he cometh he will continue for a short space and the Beast that was is not even he is the eighth and as the seventh and shall go into to uh predition and the T horns which thou sawest are the 10 Kings which shall have not received King uh received no King kdom as yet but shall receive power as kings one hour with the Beast these have one mind and shall give power and strength unto the Beast now now this is right where we are right now today this is this is all setting stage right now the Catholic church is going to come in going to work with these dictators and and and and they're going to rule with the Catholic church for one hour they're going to the the Catholic church is going to come in as a as the Superman and is going to try to bring peace and brother this is where we're at right now oh it's it's a glorious time now watch these have one mind and shall give their power and strength un the Beast and these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is the Lord of lords the king of kings and they that are with him are called Chosen and faithful someone say hallelujah and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the sth are peoples multitudes Nations and tongues the 10 horns which thou sayest upon the Beast they shall hate the and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire uh for God hath given in their hearts to fulfill his will to agree give their Kingdom unto the Beast until the words of God shall be fulfilled and the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reth over the kings of the earth now without getting through all of that there's a city that is sitting on the Seven Hills she claims to be the church she is the one all her baptisms her every so many of these dogmas that have that that's in all of the churches today has stemmed from her she is the mother of harlots and then the Bible says this woman is a great City isn't that just incredible how God for tells that Rome was coming now it is it is amazing how how accurate and someone says someone says well God you know uh God don't God don't know or or you know my my ways are HID from God let let me tell you your ways are not hid from God he knows every attitude he knows every thought he knows your prayer he hears everything about you and I say that he's got H he's got an end for you he's got a perfect end for you he's going to bring Glory the scripture says that that when the Rapture takes place and the man of sin which will be which will be the the pope and they're going to bring peace to the Earth he's going to he's going to come in and then then of course we understand that that uh uh the great city is going to be bombed and it'll he'll it'll be destroyed He he'll rule for one hour and and and then the uh Russia is going to going to bomb them and and uh it's it's going to be it's going to be quite a deal and Israel is going to be the focus of this whole situation and so what we're seeing here uh in in Israel and and we we we're seeing how the nations are you know we want a peace treaty we wanting we're wanting to get to hostages back home but we understand also that that there is no permanent peace there will be no Superman be able to bring peace not even Trump there's not going to be anyone that can bring peace to for Israel until the king comes back you and I come with Christ and we will fight we will win amen the great Millennium will set in well won't it be just a wonderful time amen and to think we are living in that time this is not this is not a future event what we're seeing here is is unfolding right before us guys oh if there's ever a time to lift up our heads and to Rejoice amen I want to tell you Rome is is cruel and evil and false Rome is the seat of the serpent are you understanding me that's why when you listen to brother brandham if you listen to brother brandham hitting those denominations I mean he was hard on those denominations why because they come from Rome they are the daughters that came out of that organized religion and that's why we're not standing for organized religion in the message you cannot organize this oh you got you got to shut down your churches and all listening to Jeffersonville we are not an organization it'll never be an organization we are a we are a a living organism it's not amen churches it's not Pony Jeffersonville uh Indiana you know uh uh uh Arizona no no no no it's it's boys and girls and men and women filled with a baptism of the Holy Ghost that the word of the hour has come and prepared you have made yourself ready you've got your garment on you're waiting you're waiting for the groom to come the marriage supper is is is right around the corner folks where we're going to sit with a real human King he'll be the god king he'll be the god of All Saints he'll be the right now he's the God of All Saints but he's going to be the God of all the Earth aren't you glad for that amen that's what we want that's what we're pushing for oh God help me to keep sin out of my life help me Lord don't let don't let me don't let the prostitutes and these religious uh uh uh settings that are out there that's just made the water down the Gospel of Jesus until it means nothing well you can't you can't see nothing in the Catholic Church you can't you you can't find praying to Peter or or or to Mary or or p uh uh uh you know Purgatory or anything in the Bible you'll never find that in the Bible it's not there but you look at the Pentecostal churches today and you can't find none of that stuff that they're preaching and teaching neither it's not there it's mama and daughters have all went back but there is a glorious King there is a groom and the power of a living God is living and abiding within her hallelujah oh God let me be ready for that soon return amen well glory to God well God bless you amen did you enjoy the reading tonight praise the Lord amen oh my I I I love the church age book and it's it's it's going to get good because it's it's it's unveiling all of this stuff amen and it's and and we can look through history and say oh my goodness there it is oh my goodness here it is and and when when you get in it's it's going to talk about Jezebel and and and and seducing and it's we're fixing to get into some really good stuff and we're going to think oh my word how wonderful God is to send us a prophet to show us these things so that we can be ready not to make us an organization that's not it not for us to look to Jeffersonville and and and and and all of us are a cult we're following Dear Lord it was was a prophet that come to unveil our eyes and be ready for the coming of the Lord I'm afraid there's going to be a lot of people that's looking to Jeffersonville and they're not looking Amen to the great groom Jesus Christ and I want this church oh yes we we hold brother brandom in high esteem and we so esteem him that we are going to listen to that message and we're going to pray God let your anointing come upon me I'm not going to worship brother brandham but I know brother brandham came for a reason I'm going to take his words to heart is that right I'm not going to pick what I want and leave what I want I'm taking the whole word of God and I I I I want to be ready when the Lord Jesus comes amen praise the lord well if the musicians would come Amen in any of you kids have anything did y'all understand tonight anything y'all Y y'all have you you don't have to ask tonight even you can write it down on your paper and and give it to me before next Wednesday night um but we would like to any any of these um Wednesday nights is sort of lowkey and um you're always free to present your questions ask your questions and if I don't know all of them and uh sometimes sometimes where I'm where I'm lacking someone else uh uh answers and it and it and it helps clarify things you know and so um but we're all I'm glad to belong to the body of Christ brother Joe that's right that's right yep and brother brother bradam says that you the Babylon was the seat we know that but then the then then in this church age it says the seat has been moved from Babylon to pergamus and that's where and that's where the first Rome Church came he says today you're not going to find it in pergamus pergamus is long gone but now that church amen has come to its Mater it's it's it is located there in Rome so it started in the pergamus church age and now here we are uh on that City there the city on Seven Hills that's right mystery Babylon praise the Lord amen for the [Music] yeah yeah yeah it's it's a pretty bold statement it knowing what you and I know we we we we we say now Trump now now now buddy you've done a good job but I just don't know if you're going to be 'll do this one I I can see I can see I can see both ways and and again this is just my opinion has nothing to do with the Bible has nothing to do okay if there's anyone that could cut a deal with the Catholic Church it would be Trump all right he could he could cut us cut us deal and say hey we're needing some help here and and um I mean you know saying that we'll we'll paint his steps or something so so there's that on the other hand you've got this what appears to be a ditsy woman that that but we know some her policies and we know some of the things she's a cruel woman of of the past this could be that rising in power of a wicked woman that will that would be more than happy to show the US and the world I'm not the Dixie woman you think I am she is very corrupt in her way of thinking she is wicked in in in the terms of life and and and and the transgender and all this she is she is you put her in power unreserved power there is no telling so I you know it it's going to be interesting because you can see it you could you could see both ways um leading you know but uh I do know there was a vision about a very Wicked Woman and um and that brother brandham thought the Catholic Church would be involved in that and so um you know we we're we're either way I believe we're here I I I believe we're here and uh so it's interesting it is interesting anyone else have anything they want to say praise the Lord Brother Merl yeah come mind in First Corinthians God chose the the weak things of the ofy [Music] yeah yeah yeah de yeah brother the ministry looks so small and so yeah amen yeah Wise Wise yeah yeah and and you're right and and he's doing it even now you know the the the the power of the Bride keeping her head above all of this craziness today and that and that that power is going to only grow amen the the Christ is with us but you're right the wisdom of this world [Music] I it's just it's it's this this is an interesting cycle election cycle it truly is and um we don't have too much longer and and we'll we'll find we're going to have us an election you know uh it's it's it is amazing it is it is truly amazing amen aren't you glad that you know the Lord Jesus tonight aren't you glad that you his bride I love him with all of my heart I love him now listen Jesus is fixing to come and those that are around with God those who have not accepted Jesus remedy will be left behind there will not be a Rapture if you're not ready to go make sure make sure that you've repented of your sins the way you can the only way you can repent is your of your sins is to admit that you're wrong is to look in the face of the Bible and say I'm wrong help me Lord that goes for boys and girls it goes for mamas and daddies grandpas and grandma is to be able to say I'm wrong and that I need the Lord to forgive me and we we repent of our sins now listen if the Bible has been so accurate to tell us where we would be today even to the point of Russia and this war Israel and the Nations turning against Israel this is this is the Bible's living right now but the Bible's also living saying that there's going to be a people that would be like a bride be the Bride of the Lord who has made got her garments clean and pure and spotless and has made herself ready and that Jesus is going to come and snatch us away the Rapture of the church will come there will come a day when the elected of God will be gone we'll go knock on someone's house and he won't be there we'll be looking for someone to help us and we won't be able to find them we'll be we then we'll be asking where where did where did Brother wend go I where where did where did this brother go where did that one go there's going to be a time where the bride is going to be gone you don't want to be left behind during that that time prepare yourself for this Rapture prepare your heart I want to be ready I'm not doing that to scare you I'm just doing it to say there's the blood of Jesus Jesus has laid down his life to forgive you of your sins to help you God wants to come in and cleanse you take all of the bad stuff out of you the holy spirit is here to lead you and to prepare you give you a heart what do I have to do what do I I just have to accept God's remedy Jesus Christ died on a [Music] cross for my [Music] sins today he's still the merciful god you can ask forgiveness and God will forgive you God will help you but after the Rapture folks he will become the judge and those who have rejected Jesus those who have rejected the word will have no remedy there will be nothing there for [Music] them so let's make sure we bring every attitude every every sin bring it to Jesus now that's all you have to do is accept Jesus life ask him to forgive you of your sins ask him to help you and give you a spirit to love him and to follow him this is very real Eternal life's very real a land where there is no sickness and no sorrow is very real this world is full of hate sin disease that land is full of peace and health and victory and it's very very real amen I want to be ready how how are we ready being honest just being honest saying to God I need you
