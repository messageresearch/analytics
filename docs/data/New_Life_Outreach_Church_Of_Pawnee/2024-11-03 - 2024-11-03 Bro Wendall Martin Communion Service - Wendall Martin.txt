missed amen we missed you too praise the Lord but um um we I hopefully we were able to or y'all were able to get get Mom and Dad where or Grandpa and Grandma halfway settled um we got we got us a leak over we our our our our our what do you gutters uh just been was full of of uh uh leaves and and so um they and it got down inside the the underground there and so the water that was coming down didn't have no place to go so it came back inside uh on this side and so um they they done a little rotor rter or something trying to get those leaves out so they got a little bit taken care of there we've still got some over here on this side and then we um uh we we're just totally wet up there on uh above sister Tracy and sister Carol so you know we might have when those strong winds came they you know it might might have done a little bit more than what we thought here a month or so ago you know but um but we were leaking water earlier there was water dripping around everywhere amen and so um but I'm I'm glad that uh I'm glad we're in the that we could still have church tonight amen and um so God is God is good to us and we uh we sure appreciate him you know hey I'm glad to have a church to have problems with how about you amen and but Ezekiel 22 and 28 it says her prophets have dobbed them with untempered mortar seeing vanity divining lies unto them and saying thus saith the Lord God when the Lord hath not spoken the people of the land have used oppress exercised robbery vexed the poor and needy they have oppressed The Stranger wrongfully I sought a man sought for a man among them that should make up the Hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it but I found none and then I'd also like to read um here in in Romans the 12th chapter I quoted it this morning and um but Romans 12:1 very familiar passage of scripture and um it says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will of God let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your amazing love to us thank you for eternal life and thank you for being our dad thank you for all that you have done for us Lord and as we come tonight and we Ponder the seriousness of our of our call and I just ask Lord that you would be here Among Us Lord walk the aisles ask your spirit Lord to just if there be any sick among us that you would heal Lord if there be any discourage encourage them Father just pray Lord that you would be with those who who are sick at home give them Lord their their heart's desire and Lord we just ask that you would you would help me tonight and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated so for this communion service here tonight I thought I'd i' like to uh speak on the intercessor and um um there in the Book of Matthew the the 25th chapter um brother or or Jesus is is talking about um the kingdom of heaven and and how that there will be um uh there Matthew 25 and 31 and he and he and he talks about how it says when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then he shall set upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep's sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand and the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty you gave me drink I was a stranger you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto to them verily I say unto you in as much as you have done it unto the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me then shall he say also unto them on his left hand depart from me you cursed into Everlasting fire and prepared for the devil and his angels for I was hunger and you gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not then they shall they also answer saying Lord when saw we thee hungered or a thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not Minister unto thee then shall he answer unto them verily I say unto you in as much as ye did it not to one of the least of these you did it not unto me and these shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous unto life eternal now that is quite a sober reading we know that in the Church ages of course brother brandham would um apply this scripture to uh uses this scripture to apply to to those who are good to the bride and um and so he he he shares um how that when you that the bride of Christ that carries the genetics of God within them they're so valuable to God that in when some someone loves his people and and and and takes care of his people it is the same thing as doing it as as to himself amen and and then those that do not value God's people the elect of God they then they um would would go into they they would go on to hell but brother Brandon would also he would also bring um this in to the bride and says that this is a natural quality for the elect of God because the New Birth the new birth gives you the heart of an intercessor okay and so as we as we think about the man that or the scripture that we read I sought for a man among them that would make up the Hedge and stand in the gap before me for the Lord for the land that I should not destroy it and and he says I didn't find any I I didn't find any now in in the Old Testament times of course amen there was no one with that new birth and so as we as we go into communion tonight I I want us to look at this because the awesome the the awesome call to be a priest we were the the there was there was no one allowed to be a priest unless you were part of the children of Aaron amen you couldn't be a priest of the Old Testament not anybody could just come in and and act as an intercessor before the Lord it was only it was only the the Aaron's sons that could go in the Levites that could take the blood offer the blood amen and and and and and go through the the Brazen altar the Brazen labor come before the the altar of incense and then finally into the presence of God it was it was it was only a chosen certain uh uh sack that was able to go there and only the high priest could go into the presence of the Lord amen behind that inner veil in that in that third Veil and so but when Jesus died amen he paid the way he paved the way as the great intercessor to go Beyond the Veil and when he went beyond the veil he also tore down that Veil he didn't just go Beyond the Veil and let it fall behind him but he tore the Veil Down and he has invited all of the sons of God to come into the presence of God hallelu now the the Old Testament was a type of the priests of the New Testament amen you you had to go amen through the through the offering of the blood and then you had to go through the sanctification of of the amen the the the the Brazen uh labor there where where you're washed with the cleansing of the word and then you then you were to go on in to that that most holy place and there is is right there at that most holy place is where you would alter where you would offer the the prayer of incense you would you would come as you're walking in to that most holy place that third part that place where God was at the place where the where where the Ark of the Covenant was at the place where the mercy seat was at amen where the where the pillar of fire dwelt among it a or Over The Mercy Seat there is where amen you would offer as a priest you would offer prayers unto the Lord and and they were required to burn incense and it was it was called they they God gave them the exact of of what they were to to burn and it was to be a a sweet odor unto the Lord and as they come into the presence of the Lord they he had to go in with prayer and and and walking through that Veil amen with this incense and amen it was a it was a type of of you and me being able to come through our Sanctified lives our lives that have that have that have been laid upon the altar amen our Humanity as you will amen has has has has been put aside the Apostle Paul says I I I amen he says I I I I I've died but yet live and and to walk in there and and now we are we there is something about you you've been through the blood you've been Sanctified by the word and now you're just now beginning to fulfill the purpose for doing it all and that's to come in the presence of God Amen to walk in there to intercede for the people you've went through the process you've done the whole thing because God wanted you to come into His presence now I I want you to really think about that because amen there there is a a a reason that God has has called you you know he says that you're going to be Kings and Priests they're they're in in in Revelations one amen that he has he has made us Kings and Priests and and and and and brother brandham would tell us he says now he says now there a lot of people want to make this for the future amen and and he says he hath made us there there are certain truths we got to emphasize this is one of them he he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings oh we are going to be Kings on the earth with him when he sets on throne but now are we spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom amen and how do we do this the uh the uh the Apostle Paul there in in Romans 5 and 17 for by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which have received the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life uh shall we reign in life by one Jesus Christ we've been translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his light we have we we have taken on we have taken on his name we have taken on his his characteristics so right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin over the world over the Flesh and over the devil now he says that he says just the way I just I just quoted it having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil now why would he give you authority over that because through the blood of Jesus Christ at the Brazen Altar and the and and and the the word that Bloody bleeding word at the labor amen it has prepared you it has brought you you have sin is under your control sin is under your feet you have taken in the blood of Jesus and you have put those things and and you have you have you have put yourself you have you have died to yourself and you're living aresh to the Lord Jesus Christ I want to say that's the only way that you're ever going Amen to be a a real intercessor because you can't really feel amen now God God's allowed us to be humans and and and in our Humanity we do feel amen and and and that's what Humanity do I I I think Humanity should feel for Humanity there there should be a love there should be a compassion for Humanity to humanity and as I said this morning brother Bram talked about how that the the the love of many shall wax long a cold uh uh because of the abounding of iniquity and and these things would take us totally away uh uh from our genuine purpose but you you see he's made us didn't just make us a king and he didn't just make us a priest he made us a king to bring this flesh under the control and he's also made us priests to be able to walk into the presence of God and intercede for his people I I want to say tonight there is nothing any greater there is nothing any greater than an intercessor right right you you you can you can you've got the accusers you you you've got to amen and someone had asked me here here here some time back and and uh uh they they said we we we want you to you know something was going on and and and we and we you know drunk ladies trying to run over her boyfriend and and uh you know and and um I I you know the the the the police was wanting me to sign something and I I I I I said listen I I don't want to be the accuser I'm I'm wanting to stand he goes Mr Martin amen and and I understand sometimes we got to do those things but but my but my point is this God has not called us to bring judgment God has called us to give Mercy God's not now I know God's a god of judgment but he's not made me the judge that's right he's made me a king over this flesh and he's made me a priest for his people he's the judge he's the only judge he's the one we're going to stand before you're not going to stand before me I'm not going to stand before you we will stand before him somay but right now we're reigning over a spiritual Kingdom he has anointed us Amen to bring in under again what was it to to to bring to bring dominion over sin and this flesh a a and the devil Amen to bring that in and that is what God has called us to do amen over sin the World the Flesh and the devil amen so tonight you'll never be a successful priest until you become a successful King you'll never be a good intercessor until you bring sin under your control the world in your life your flesh and the devil under control can you say amen amen how are we to do that through the opening of the word the judge has handed you the book that you must live by and as kings you don't have your own you don't have your own laws amen the great one Among Us has given us the laws and we've got to carry that out can you say Amen aren't you glad that you've been translated into his glorious Kingdom amen amen priest he hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father Amen brother brother bradam would say as we've read in the church age book he says made us priest yes priests unto him offering spiritual Praise of Sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning priests and Kings unto our God another place he says has made us priest did you ever know what a priest uh what a priest is what is his office a priest is to make sacrifice to make intercession amen amen so as we as we look tonight amen I I I I want us to really stop to think about what this Blood Covenant means to us brother bradam on that day at Calvary he says I hope this helps you get in a place that's what the Tabernacle that's what all people has got to do is to find out what you are and what's the purpose Church isn't going to church just to play music sing songs church is a place where correction judgment begins at the house of God we must reckon ourselves dead and alive to Christ then he made the way that we could sacrifice ourselves to his service yes to follow him and if we follow him we lead the life that he lived and then he says that's wonderful he said Jesus said spoke of it he said let let let me give you a few quotations on it he said listen close don't miss it Jesus said at that day he would separate the people like the sheep and the goats and he would say to the goats stand on the left side and to the Sheep stand on the right side he said to the goats depart from me because I was hungry and you didn't feed me and I was in prison and you did not uh uh visit me I was naked and you clothed me not I was thirsty you gave me no drink I was sick and you didn't visit me so depart from me but on the sheep he said I was hungry and you fed me and I was naked and you clothed me I was sick and you ministered to me now notice don't fail to get this church keep this in your heart forever it was so unconsciously done people don't do it for the line of duty a man that gives you something another he because he ought to do it a man that feeds you because he ought to do it well he's got a selfish idea it should be your very life your very action it was so surprising to these sheep that they said Lord when when were you hungry and we fed you when were you naked and you and and and we clothed you when were you thirsty and we gave you drink when were you sick and we ministered to you it was so automatic out of love just your life lived in them God let the people see what calary has did for us so automatically when were you Lord we never knew Look what Jesus turned and said in so much as youve done it unto these you did it unto me you see I I I believe God keeps record I believe God appreciates every priest that cares enough to leave their to leave their life and to walk into his presence and to do and to consecrate themselves and to go amen through that process to go into the to intercede for another man or woman you want the blessings of the Lord you want God to smile on you than love his people you want you want then humble yourself and abase yourself in such a way where all you want to see is the kingdom of God go forward and that kind of a life is the very thing that ushered the the the high priest into the presence of the Lord they had they had laid themselves was on that altar that lamb had took their place and they amen all of their sins were down they had taken that Brazen labor and they they had washed themselves with the washing of the water of the word and now they're coming in with this incense of prayer what a beautiful thing see God's not called us to just come and said in a church building God's call is to be priests God's call [Music] us to see that his people make it I think a lot of that is missing today are priests because a priest has got to walk humbly a priest isn't a a priest is is one that is had to walk the priest had to be dressed right the priest had to amen he had to go through the consecration he had to go through all of these things before he could even amen even come in and and and and begin to intercede and it's quite a challenge it's quite you you've got to it's it's a it's a Sanctified life that you have to live can you say Amen now brother Brenham would say the unselfish life not the second thought not think about it not but but you are so dead to the things of the world and so alive in Christ so walking on the highway that these things are just automatic thing you just do it not saying well now the Lord would uh uh uh now the the Lord would Lord want me to do that that's not it you're just part of him his spirit is in you and you act the way that he acts act it and then he goes ah do you get it there's a way that seeth right unto a man but the end thereof is death but not all that saith Lord Lord shall enter in but they that do the will of the father just from their hearts just freely now that day of Calvary paid that price so that we could be that way are y'all catching one are y'all are y'all catching that brother brandom is saying that this is a privilege this is a privilege it's the privilege that has been given his bride to intercede for Humanity oh my it's not a have to to go in prayer amen see it's the privilege and with this privilege with this awesome call with this great responsibility we know that consecration has got to come we know that there's certain actions that are not allowed we know that we cannot be amen h a busy bodies and we can't allow our spirit uh uh to to to to be in the gossip session and we can't allow our our our spirits to be wandering off on phones and looking at things you're not supposed to we can't allow our Spirits Amen to to to just be up in the air with this one and that one and the other amen there is there there in order to be a priest there is a special order that God has required for every one of us in order to come into His presence is it worth it I say it's worth it I I I I I'm telling you right here in py America we have a little Church of priests we have a a church here that God has has has got a special order for that's right amen now the priest wasn't noticed the priest wasn't seen by the people the priest and neither is a prayer Warrior a prayer Warrior is not one that's behind the pull pit a prayer Warrior is not one that amen that that that that is that that is that is seen amen but the prayer warriors the one that's in that sweet place with God interceding for your brother and for your sister I think mamas need someone praying for them daddies need someone to pray for

God cannot use a man that is arrogant God cannot use a man a busy body woman God will only use those who have come into this priesthood after the order that he has set forth in his word the blood and then Washed by the washing of the Water by the word amen and then you can come in amen hallelujah into that holies of holies where the anointing of God is and there's where things begin to take place yes Hallelujah Hallelujah I've been in that place with him I've I've been there where the anointing of God has been has been so strong a man where the glory of the holy spirit is so rich where I know that I know that I have come in contact with God come on church amen you've been there you see amen now brother Bram would say he he would say you you know he says now it's not works he says well not

bless God I'm a Christian he says oh my you selfish poor miserable person you hypocrite what come on because you want to be seen you want to have a part in it you want to be you you you want to you you want you you're looking at this as a Prestige thing come on it's not a Prestige thing it's a heart that is in love with the Lord God it's a heart that loves his people it's a heart that wants amen your brother and your sister to be healed and touched and encouraged it's it's nothing you're holding as a as as a scorecard my goodness you don't need no no scorecard no you're a servant you're a minister you're a priest and you've got the opportunity to take your brother your sister before the Lord in prayer amen you've got the privilege of saying no I don't think I want to play ball tonight I feel an urge in my heart for a brother and a sister I'm going to call them up I'm going to I I I I'm going to see how they're doing I I I'm going to pray I I'm going to amen I'm I'm I'm going to do what I can to make sure that one's encouraged or that one's shorted up look can you say man am it's the part of an intercessor an intercessor now I'm not going to hold you long but an intercessor means that there is somebody that is needy it means they're not going to match up to what you think they should be it means that they're not going to be they're needy that's why we need an intercessor amen that'll take that'll take the hand of God and and and the Hand of uh of of of of the the one that is in need and that can connect the hand of God to the hand of the needy one you become the intercessor you're the goet you're the one in the right State of Mind mind that can help your brother that's your sister amen I I think I think it's a wonderful thing I think it's it's something that is that is missing today it's something that I'd like to see more in our church uh that that that love for one another I'd like to see that in our children that agonizing before the Lord and calling out to God can you say amen amen I I'd like to see that in it's all amen saying I I I I've got to see the the blessings of the Lord upon my upon my brother my sister amen now now he says he says it's just don't let the right hand know what the left hand is doing and the left know what the right is doing just so automatically dead in Christ till you do it anyhow it's your nature it's your makeup you do it anyhow it's just the life that has lived in you you you're completely yielded to that spirit and it just lives its life in you or you feel the Blessed spirit that life not me that liveth but but said Paul but Christ lives in me it's just so automatic well I tell you brother brandom we we are Christians here we we help these people we help them people we he says oh my shame on you that's not Christianity Christianity just automatically got to it's to be done you just forgot about it all about it I I ain't I ain't got nothing just go do it Christ just completely surrendered himself his life to God he made he gave himself a public servant to the people he gave his life freely he didn't have to do it he didn't begrudging do it he didn't say now Brethren you all ought to think a whole lot of me because I come to die for you he never said a word about it and he died anyhow because it was God in him it's God in you it's god in me that makes us look at others sheep on one side can you say Amen one of them will say well Lord I did this and Lord I did that he said depart from me you workers of iniquity I never even knew you if the church can never come to these fundamental facts that it's not something you try to do you work yourself up to do it's something that's born in you well praise the Lord do you love him amen another place is but you have left the great things undone it's that self-sacrificed life that God lives in you automatically doing that which is right because it's right just going on don't even think nothing about about it just living it then once you see what's going on see you just you don't you're you're on the highway that's that's what Calvary meant to you you're on the highway opened up that day for you now remember you can't be half goat and half sheep they won't mix now there's a lot of people say yes you know what we we got an organization our group we got a we we we help the pure we do this we that's all right but you're tooting your own horn about it you you don't do that oh you you you do your arms in in secret Jesus said just automatically something no more than going getting a drink of water you're thirsty if the next man is thirsty you think about him too the next man's need you think about about him the same as you think about you for your own need don't pay no attention to it you just live on you can't be half sheep and half goat so if you say well our church is a has got an organization we give to the poor we do this and we do that and we do the other if you have that without the other The Life of Christ in you you're just going and doing you're just absolutely doing it in vain can you say Amen so what he's trying to say there's going to be somebody of another priesthood that would try to do things and their approach to God and and try their own way of of of working for the Lord but brother brandom is saying only the elect the elect and that's what that's what all of the churches that they want a big they they want the big name they want the big titles they want the big they they they they they want the big churches they want these things they want that but not the Bride of Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ wants to come to that Altar and have their nature changed have that blood offering applied to them and what their sins and take the word amen and bring that word over them and wash them and cleanse them so that they can come into the presence of God that's the only one coming into his presence it's not in great minds it's not how smart how rich not how good looking how many girlfriends you have it's not how many amen trophies dear trophies you have on your wall it's you coming and taking Calvary and letting Calvary make a difference in your life it's letting Calvary make a difference and making you like him I'm not going to be that judge on that day I'm not going to be the one that's going to be the goats and the Sheep that's not my job my job is to be a priest your job is to be a priest a priest unto him yes and I say there's a lot of needy that needs priest Josh is not in the it's not in it's not in how good you preach you're a priest you're an intercessor it's not how good you sing it's not how good you play It's not that amen whether you belong on the Deacon board or belong on the trustee board whether you you belong on the you know you're you're a you're a part of the five-fold ministry or the helps of the governments or whether you're a it don't matter one thing that matters is let me be an intercessor can you say Amen now as we come into this part of the service as we take the bread and and we look at it here in in the book of 1 Corinthians the 11th chapter and we we we we look at this and and and the Apostle Paul is not taking the sheep and the goats but he's but he's but he's taking the same lines that brother bradam said listen you're coming together and it's for the worst and not the good you're vying for positions you're vying for this and that and you have failed to realize that you're part of a body of Christ now let's look at this for I the uh uh 1 Corinthians 11 and 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is in my new testament is the is the New Testament in my blood this do as often often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this calls many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep but if you would judge our if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry for one another and if any man hunger let him meat at home that ye come not unto condemnation the rest I will set in order when I come as we look at this portion of the service the blood and I I'm thankful for that blood I'm thankful for the the Great great intercessor the great intercessor gave his life he shed his blood he laid down his bread Jesus said this this bread amen is my body it's a type of that word that has become flesh this wine is my blood that was spilled so he ultimately laid down his life so that you and I IM man could come before the Lord that's it it it it gets me every time I think about it he put his world on hold to come down live with me find me in my stench and he was the intercessor between me and God and brought me into this relationship with the Lord that's what his blood has done but it didn't just do that to where you're coming but now he's saying now I'm going to make you an intercessor I'm I'm going to make you you you you're you're you you are now going to live for a greater purpose than than the purpose of a man just uh uh uh going to work every day as I was saying this morning you you Brothers can feel so can feel unappreciated and and you sisters can can feel that way yourselves and and it just seems like it's a it's a miracle round but God's design is not for you to live this way forever it's God's design to bring the higher purpose out in you now I am not in the slightest bit hope this ain't a condeming message to y'all I'm here today to finish up my thought from this morning be strong and very courageous lots of humanity out there but very few Sons living in his position lots of lots of wonderful things out in the world but there's only a few that know how to come into His presence only a few know how and I say today he's made a way he's not looking at at any of our sins once they're confessed of once they're put under the blood that's the reason on communion man if if you've got a against a brother then you should take care of that odd you should make sure that anything that is that that is in between because you you you you understand amen that you are uh uh uh you you are a uh a a spirit being and and and the spirits of this uh the sins of this spirit amen it's the sins of the spirit man that bring on the sins of of of the body it's the desires of the spirit that the body enacts it's the desires if you've got malice and and and and and envying then then it comes out through your gossiping if you've got hatred in your spirit in your heart then then you're going to hate those that are outside so whatever is on the outside is a reflection of what's on the inside and what we are doing is saying we want to have our spir not just our flesh clean but we want our Spirits clean and pure before God we want the presence of God nothing to hinder us from his presence can you say Amen so if that be the case if there's if there's odds then we go take care of the odds if you've got OD against your mom and dad you just go take care of it if you've been wrong you repent of it the blood of Jesus takes care of of it all now now now there is nothing about this that is going to save you this is just a memorial but this causes self inspection to every one of us it brings us in line to say Lord where am I at where am I standing right here in October of 2024 where where where am I at with you amen how many loves him why don't we sing that song I love you yes I
