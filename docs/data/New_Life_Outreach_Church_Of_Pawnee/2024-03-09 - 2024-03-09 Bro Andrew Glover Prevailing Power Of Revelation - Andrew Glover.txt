something about being in love with the Lord Jesus loving him from your heart not from your mind but loving him from your heart there's just such an expression that comes with that amen and I I think I've seen some of that expression here this weekend amen and you young people the love you have for him amen you can be seated for for a few moments amen well have you enjoyed yourself in the presence of the Lord hasn't it been wonderful amen we uh we we have truly enjoyed these brothers and um uh brother Timothy that was that was just wonderful this morning amen the good thing about these men they're not trying to draw you to themselves they're pointing you to the God of this message and it's the God of this message that amen that you're experiencing here and I I thought it was I thought it was incredible when brother Andrew was ministering last night he says just preach the message because the anointing will follow the word and you've noticed that as these brothers have have just labored over that word and amen just settling our hearts that the word is right have you noticed how the Holy Spirit has come right back behind that to vindicate that to your heart there's been a lot of Amen people who ministers who have who have preached the gospel for amen some preached the gospel for 30 40 years and have walked away amen from this message and and you know why because they've never had the experience that you have you want to know a living God you are walking in with the Living God not with a god of yesterday a god of of William Branham who had died a long time ago brother branam introduced us to a Christ that still lives and I believe they read that quote the other night where they said amen he says my my Ministry is to just simply introduce him and I'm so thankful that we have been introduced to a living God so we enjoyed that word here this morning and uh uh we're just looking forward to what God has tonight how many's come expecting to receive from the Lord hallelujah amen and there's just no telling what God's got for his people right here this evening amen hallelujah it's just it just going to get good and good we've got two last two more services it's tonight and tomorrow morning now I know we can get a little bit tired and and and I noticed this morning amen as we were starting out I could tell some of you were just really tired but by the end of the service you were thinking I'm sure glad I pressed past the sand man amen so I I want the Holy Spirit to come down in such a supernatural way I've got needs tonight and I I I I want the Holy Spirit to work in those needs how about how about you here this evening now we're fixing to ask the man of God to come amen and and uh we want to say that we appreciate all of the pastors and we want you to

evening if you have your Bibles while you're standing we invite you to the Book of Romans the 10th chapter The Book of Romans the 10th chapter and while you're turning there tonight we want to just greet you in the name of the Lord once again and my wasn't that a wonderful service this morning anden I tell you the Lord just really spoke to us through our brother Timothy and we we sure love and appreciate brother Timothy and appreciate his stand for the word of God and amen I believe the Lord just used him in a supernatural way this morning and amen we sure appreciate that and once again we want to say thank you to brother Wendell and brother Colby brother Josh all the team here the uh workers of the camp and amen just for the opportunity to be here once again with you we sure counted a privilege and an honor and my hadn't that been some good food we've been eating over there in the cafeteria amen go ahead and give them a hand if you can amen if you amen they've they've been laboring hard and amen they've provided some wonderful meals for us and we we sure appreciate that and all the work and effort that's gone into it amen we pray God would reward New Life Outreach over and over and over and over and over amen for all that they've done to be a blessing to God's children and amen we want to look here tonight in the Book of Romans the 10th chapter and I want to read here in the 17th verse and then we're going to go to the Book of Luke 1 but in Romans 10 And1 17 the Bible said so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God now brother Bram picks that up and says hearing by the word of God he says or the word made manifest so we're not just reading something or just hearing about something that could happen might happen but it has happened so we're reading manifested word faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God made manifest now in the book of St Luke the first chapter in St Luke chapter 1 it's a very familiar story of how that the angel came to Mary and spoke to Mary and he actually didn't just tell her something I believe he delivered her a message and in Luke 1 and verse 26 the Bible says in in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a spoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee and blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and casting her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God see there's that fear not and beheld and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end now watch this then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seen I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be borne of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth sheath also conceived in her old age and this is the six month with her who is called Barren for with God nothing shall be impossible now watch after all the things the angel tells Mary here's what she says be it unto me according to Thy word so after all the things that he just delivered to her the only thing she could say was be it unto me Lord according to Thy word and the angel departed from her I want to look also in the book of Acts the 27th chapter the book of Acts the 27th chapter amen y'all forgive me my voice is a little weak on me tonight but we'll just give the devil a black eye with what we got Amen in the book of Acts the 27th chapter in the 25th verse the Bible here says wherefore s be of good cheer for I believe Goden how many can say that tonight I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me so here in other words what has been spoken to Paul by Vision shall be exactly as it was said it shall not deviate or change it will be exactly as it was told me amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon amen I want to by the help of the Lord if I could amen for just a few moments I want to speak to you here tonight and if I would title this I want to speak to you on the prevailing power of Revelation the prevailing power of Revelation you know this morning we heard that we should choose Faith over fear amen how many how many chose Faith this morning amen we heard that we should choose Faith over fear now brother B tells us in the message and have faith in God he said now acts chap 1:8 Jesus said that you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you he said now not before when you get your PhD but after the Holy Ghost has come upon you you he said then you'll have power of Faith to believe amen it takes the power of Faith to believe in Romans chapter 10 and verse 17 the Bible said that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God now when you read that from the Amplified Bible it says that faith comes from hearing what is told amen and what is heard will come by the preaching of the message concerning Christ in Acts 27:25 it says so keep up your courage men for I believe God how many can say I believe God and have complete confidence in him that it will turn out exactly as I have been told in the message brother B preaches a sermon called it shall be even amen as it was told me he said now oh don't you just love that it'll be as it was told me if the angel truly comes from God and is sent from God then it's bound to be it is a direct message from Glory it is a direct message from Glory now I believe tonight that we have received a direct message from gory how many can agree with me we have received a direct message amen from gory and the prophet of God said now there's angels of the Lord he says many of them they come to the Earth and they bring messages he said but when Gabriel comes there's something major going to happen see he was the one who announced the the first coming of Christ he will announce the second coming of Christ amen and he told Mary that thou H has found favor with God he said now what a message to bring her that thou H has found favor with God I believe tonight that we can say Amen that there was a supernatural being amen that met our prophet in a cave and delivered to him a message and it was not an opinion it was not an idea amen but it was a vision from God Amen concerning the Church of the Living God and the prophet of God said I truly believe amen that a supernatural being came to me and make these statements and I have not been disobedient to the heavenly vision I believe that if it is a supernatural being amen the supernatural being is going to make amen Supernatural statements they're not going to be natural statements but they're going to be Supernatural statements amen and those statements are going to be amen of an authority or of Faith are going to they're going to come into your life amen to build Faith now when you look at this word Supernatural it is of or relating to an order of existence beyond the visible amen observable universe it is something that is departing from what is usual or normal amen especially as to appear Amen to transcend the laws of nature it is attributed to an invisible agent amen such as it goes or a spirit amen so when something is Supernatural amen it is coming out of the natural realm amen and it's moving into the Unseen realm amen and things are happening but it's not happening by what you can see amen it's happening by what you can't see and I believe tonight that there's a bride in this building tonight who is not influenced or LED amen by the things that she can see amen but she's led by the things she cannot see amen she looks at the Unseen she believes in the Unseen amen she prays by the Unseen she confesses by the Unseen because she is a bride who is following the Unseen now brother says it very beautiful he says God is a supernatural being how many believes that amen God is a supernatural being then wherever a supernatural being is he will do Supernatural signs amen see you cannot get around the supernatural with without there being a supernatural manifestation he said when you get in the presence of God Amen the supernatural he said there's going to be Supernatural signs amen and Supernatural workings of a supernatural God he said everywhere God is amen the supernatural takes place amen because he is Supernatural listen I'm just going to preach a minute if that's okay we didn't come here for for a natural service we didn't come here for a natural meeting but we come here here for a supernatural meeting a supernatural Deliverance a supernatural healing a supernatural Miracle listen I believe tonight we're going to have a supernatural prayer line I believe we're going to see Supernatural victories we're going to see Supernatural power amen cuz we're not serving a natural God we're serving a supernatural God and that Supernatural God has a supernatural seed amen and that Supernatural seed is not coming that Supernatural seed is here tonight you are the supernatural seed of the supernatural God he said one day there come on the scene amen a supernatural seed which was born by Supernatural birth amen the same faith it was born not by a supernatural not by the natural birth rather but by the supernatural birth amen by the supernatural Faith which Abraham had that was not according to the sexual desire of Abraham but what God did to him that way amen but through a supernatural faith that he had now listen faith is Supernatural amen look at somebody next to you and say faith is Supernatural amen now watch what the prophet says and it does Supernatural things so you cannot have a supernatural faith without that Supernatural Faith doing Supernatural things and through Abraham's Faith as we were here hundreds of years later amen come the supernatural seed that he believed in and when this Supernatural seed come on the earth he done the supernatural sign of a supernatural prophet he was greater than a prophet he was a god Prophet to give a natural people amen a supernatural birth what did he do he went before us and he died but they couldn't hold him Abraham's grave is still there Isaac's grave is still there but there is an empty tomb Amen on the supernatural seed that done a supernatural work that had a super natural Resurrection listen every one of you was born amen by a natural seed through a natural desire amen and we were born in sin we were shap in iniquity we come in the world speaking lies amen and we was on our way to Hell amen but God who is rich in Mercy produced a supernatural Birth by the water and the blood and the spirit at the curse of our human nature could be removed and we could resurrect into Heavenly places we could step out of Fe here we could step out of the ideas of the world and step into the supernatural influence of God and believe the things listen what good does it do to tell you these things if you don't believe them what good does it do to preach these things if you don't believe them but I believe somebody's going to believe him I believe somebody's going to receive them I believe somebody's going to receive amen the word of the lord they're going to receive the word of the Lord amen not as the word of a man but as the word of God Amen I believe it I believe I believe thank you buddy I believe you are that Supernatural seed that is coming to this generation can you say amen amen amen we're going to we going to get through it brother said what did he do he conquered death hell in the grave and when he did that he possessed the gates and he rose on the third day in a supernatural Resurrection he said now that same God is raised from the dead as a supernatural sign and after 2,000 years is still living right here now and can work miracles like he did when he was here on the earth amen through a supernatural people that has been born of a supernatural spirit with a supernatural faith and that's the same faith that Abraham had now I believe tonight that we are the possessors amen of the same Supernatural faith that that Abraham had and you know what that Faith did Brother Sam that Faith called things that were not as though they were and things that were as though they were not see brother B said like this he said now what we got to do is we got to let the word be sown into our heart and receive that word and let that word manifest the promise that's behind it I thank God for sending us a prophet because he did not only tell us amen that we was a supernatural seed we were falling Supernatural God and had a supernatural Faith but he stood there and told us what faith is and he told us what faith power is and the Bible said that faith is the substance amen of things hoped for it's the evidence of Faith it's the evidence of Things Not Seen amen now watch for through faith we understand said what is faith is God by the spirit revealing to you something he's going to do amen or he's promised amen faith is God by the spirit revealing to you something he's going to do or something he's promised to do he said now Faith cometh by hearing hearing is not Faith a loaf of bread is purchased for 25 cents amen but the 25 cents is not the loaf of the bread amen see hearing only brings the word that produces the faith now watch a prophet then you see you hear the word god reveals it to you that it is the truth and by Spirit revealed truth he confirms your faith to to God Amen God reveals it to you and by spirit filled truth it confirms your faith to God let me say this that's the church amen that God built upon the rock amen that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against may I say this to you amen we are the generation that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against we are the Church of the firstborn who is following the sign of the resurrected Jesus Christ we are not here as a bunch of intellectuals we are not here as a bunch of educated people but we are here as spiritually revelated Sons and Daughters of God and the Gates of Hell will come against us they will come against you they will come against me but we have a more sure word of Prophecy that the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against this generation we got a revelation on the inside of us we will prevail over everything we will prevail over our failures we will prevail over bad habits we will prevail over mistakes we will prevail over besetting sins listen devil thr what you want to against us but when the dust settles and the Smoke Clears we will rise as the Invincible Army of the Living God who is Anointed by the faith of Abraham ah Hallelujah somebody shout we will prevail we will prevail we will prevail on the mountain and we will prevail in the valley we will prevail when we're sick and we will prevail when we're well we will prevail when we feel like we're saved and we will prevail when we feel like we're lost we will prevail when we got a voice and we will prevail when we don't because this Revelation is the Prevailing Faith of almighty God that has coming into this generation to lead you from Victory unto Victory Hey Brother Jude I believe it amen I believe the devil can throw everything he wants to against you but when it's all said and done you will rise up out of it and you will profess that God is God and His word is true and his power is here listen we're not a bunch of hybridized Christians we're Sons and Daughters of revelation we don't sing by the way we feel we sing by Revelation We Don't Preach by the way we feel we preach by Revelation now watch what the prophet said he said face power brings to pass God's revealed revelation somebody shout face power brings to pass God's revealed Revelation when God reveals something's going to happen when God reveals something is going to happen all hell can't stop it when God reveals something is going to happen the grave cannot hold it sin cannot defeat it Spirits cannot bind it hell cannot grab it come on chch when God reveals by the power of Revelation he's going to do something devil you better get out of our way cuz he's going to do it without asking anybody he's going to do it without asking or cheing with anybody you know how he's going to do it because he's God I said he's God and when that Revelation drops in your heart you will see then that your faith is not an emotion your faith is not a sensation your faith is a substance amen your faith is a revelation listen I believe there's a I believe there's a revelation this building tonight amen that can Pierce every dark cloud and can release the waters Amen to fall upon the seat of God and bring to pass to pass the potentials of the sea that's laying there can I say this said faith is something that's revealed to you now that it is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation that is revealed to you it is not yet but you believe it will be he said see faith is a revelation of the will of God works as Faith expressed he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you did not work yourself up into faith if you ever have faith it was give to you by the grace of God another place he says in an audience of people we're a prayer line comes through you will find some and they're all good people we'll say but there's some that's trying hard to believe it they're trying to work themselves into it amen some just can't do it at all and others it's just by Grace it's just given to them now there is the difference that's the real Revelation because faith is a revelation from God it must be revealed first now we got a prayer line coming tonight amen so let this Revelation amen take PR Eminence in your hearts amen that God keeps his word let that Revelation drop in the depths of your soul right now amen that God keeps his word he doesn't keep our ideas he doesn't keep the way we think it ought to be he doesn't keep our schedule but he keeps his word and if his word said it you got a right to believe it and the spirit is here to reveal it and the devil cannot stop it there is a prevailing power in the Revelation that God won keep his word heavens and earth will pass away amen but my word shall never pass away listen I'd rather be standing tonight amen on the word of God than in heaven itself because Heavens will pass away and the Earth will pass away but there is a revelation that there is nothing there is nothing there is nothing that can cause this Revelation to pass away yeah glory to God somebody Shout God keeps his word somebody shout God keeps his word now if God keeps his word his word must be revealed now watch the prophet of God said something revealed that is not yet but you believe it will be now can I say what the prophet said he said then the Rapture is a revelation that's why the bride must have rapturing faith but to the church Rapture tape 65 the Rapture is revealed to her it's a revelation now the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture can I say this there was a time we were waiting for the revelation of the Rapture but brother stepen tonight we're not waiting the wait is over the Revelation is here listen young people we're not trying to find the Revelation we're not trying to work up the Revelation we're not trying to dig through commentaries and find something to give you a future we have in our possession tonight the Revelation that will change our bodies in the moments in the twinkling of the night listen may I say this Rapture and faith is not coming it's here tonight it's in this building don't don't think I'm crazy but the Rapture is right here right now in this building there is an influence of a supernatural being from an invisible agent of God and he's influencing your body to believe it's going to be changed now somebody they say rapturing Grace rapturing Grace and rapturing Faith now will you remember this it's not rapturing works it's rapturing faith and rapturing Grace in other words by Grace you are saved through faith and that is not of yourselves it is the gift of God remember said God must get rapturing Faith in his bride now can I say this he said I truly believe 1953 before the can I lay some word in here before the church can have the Rapture it's got to have rapturing faith and what is Faith amen it is believing that God will bring to pass something that he has said will come to pass now can I say this what God requires amen God must provide brother Mark God cannot require something and not provide it God cannot say here you got to have Rapture in faith now go find it somewhere he amen and maybe I'll meet you in the Rapture but if God requires rapturing Faith sisters I that he's got to provide a way Amen to get rapture and faith into your heart and the prophet of God said we're able Amen to pull the pages back amen but we're not able to open the word somebody say open the word we're not able to open the word he said but Thou Art the only one who can take this word and th are the only one that's worthy of opening the word amen the lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world oh Lamb of God Amen come into our midst tonight in the power of thy resurrection and give us rapturing Faith amen there there the prophet is just identified that rapturing faith is going to come from the opening of the word if the word is not open there's not a release of rapturing Faith but if the Lamb of God who was in Revelation five was worthy to take the book and to open the seals and to loose the things there in then may I say to you tonight that same lamb has come in this meeting tonight to take the open book and to place it in your hearts amen not by sensation not by emotion but by the revelation of Jesus Christ that has been released from the opening of the word oh somebody shout the opening of the word can I say this amen the open of the word it's going to move the bride into the bride age proud of God said it amen somebody say well you better be careful what 1954 brother Brandon was already referring to the coming of the Bride age now we all are message Believers right amen go study when you get home and on your table or you can even do it when you get back to your door you will type in these words bright age brother B does not introduce that term till 1965 but in 1954 he says we're now moving right on into another great age it's coming coming for the Rapture of the church and in this we're living in the time of the restoration of the gifts but it stumbled me to Big fine churches it sent Nazarene backwards it made Fanatics out of a lot of Pentecost but just the same God's moving right on and bringing in the rapturing faith amen for his church so the prophet of God is showing you amen that rapturing faith is not coming under just testification it's not just coming under sanctification it's not even just coming under the restoration the gifts but when the seventh angel shall begin to sound and begin to tile the loose ends together it will be the bringing in or the ushering end of the faith of God to change your body we've got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in the moment in the twinking of an eye amen and go out or will not go but don't worry it'll be there if we don't have Rapture in faith he said we're not going to go amen but I say thank God for a positive Prophet who said don't you worry rapturing faith will be there then I'm not here tonight nervous on how I'm going to preach about the Rapture I'm here to introduce you tonight amen the rapturing faith of God is in the message of the hour it's the power of the church that'll bring on the general Resurrection listen the other Angels were Messengers they were men of the earth now can I say this to you the other Angels amen seven Church ages but said they were Angels they were men of the earth he said but this angel said amen to the angel the Church of Leota to the Church of Ephesus see men Messengers prophets and so forth to the church but this one didn't come from the earth amen this one that's bringing you come on Church he's already where you're trying to get to we're not trying to get to another age we're not trying to get to another planet we're not trying to get to another Universe we're trying to get back where we come from and we came from God and we got to go back to God and there's only one way to get there and that's by the way that God is providing it prophet of God said this one didn't come from the earth he come down from heaven because the mystery is all finished and when the mystery is finished amen the angel said that time shall be no more now watch this and seven Thunders am been throw their voices out he said what if it is something to let us know on how to enter into the rapturing faith so in other words it's here but you got to know how to get into it and in other words it's here but you got to move into the rapturing faith or let the rapturing faith move into you now this Angel didn't come from the earth he came down from heaven now let me say this accepting the Vindicated word is God's provided way to bring Believers rapturing Faith amen can you can you give me that first picture Amen in that first picture there if you'll look here and see amen there's a cloud okay if you you go to Revelation 10 and verse one I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven and he was clo with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now watch this and he had in his hand a little open book oh God I wish I had the voice of a Thousand Angels right now he had in his hand not a little closed book but a little open book and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had utter their voices I was about to ride but I Heard a Voice from Heaven say seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not now listen friends he said I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith so is this okay so the revelation of those seven Thunders amen will give rapturing faith and will gather the bride together amen for the Great Escape of the church because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it but there's something we've got to step farther amen can can you remember that can you hold that in your heart there's something that we got to step farther so there's a connection between the opening of the word and your walk as a Believer there is a connection between this Revelation and the way you walk oh come on church amen we don't stay in the same spots but we're walking with God just like Enoch walked we're walking with God on our bad days we're walking with God and on our good days we're walking with God when we feel like it we walk with God and when we don't feel like it we walk with God because we are under a Rapture anointing and it's an anointing to win it's an anointing to overcome it's an anointing to escape this age come on church we ain't staying in Leia we've been anointed to leave Leia by the revelation of the word of God that has been released you want to talk about anointing let's talk about anointing let's talk about anointing not just to shout and not just to speak in tongues and not just to Dancy aows but let's talk about an anointing amen that'll change gray hair back back again let's talk about an anointing that'll bring loved ones up out of the ground and they'll appear to you let's talk about an anointing that'll call loved ones that's been laying there for thousands of years to rise you want to talk about anointing let's talk about the open book amen when that book come open it released an anointing now it's okay I'm going preacher for a second we got to have enough Faith to take to be changed in a moment and be swept up off the earth now watch we'll find where it's written we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away I love a prophet's English and when it do that's language I can talk and when it do it'll give faith for the Rapture and Grace for that church to move out come on church it's moving time it's moving time when the Revelation that is contained in those seven Thunders are revealed to this generation it will give Faith to the bride to move out amen the Rapture is on the church oh God to move out we just move through everything we know of through all the dispensations we've seen the mysteries of God we've seen the appearing of the great gather together the bride in the last days but yet there's something in there that we cannot lighten oursel will there's something another now watch we read Revelation 10 3 to 4 1: 4 now watch in verse 7 but in the days of The Voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets can I say what the prophet said the messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 107 is going to do two things according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers but the second thing he will do I'm feeling like the preacher coming on now but the second thing he will do he will reveal the the mystress of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals listen amen I'm going to punch that devil square in the face that's pushing against me right now and saying this is too deep for our young people well if you want to leave him and lay out a see you go ahead but I've got the word of the lord it's the message of the hour and it's not coming from denomination it's not coming from programs it's not coming from Lea it's coming from the revelation of those seven Thunders that were thundered out and it was the Mysteries contained in those Seven Seals listen young people amen get your head back in the message get your head back in that seven seal book get your head back in that church H book get your head back in the word of God and line up what you believe with the supernatural Revelation that's been released in this generation get your head out of video games get your head out of sports get your head out lay out to see it we got a body change to take we got a Rapture to go into and the only way we're going to take it is by eating the open book that has been sent down in the age that we're living [Applause] in hallelujah hallelujah now don't get mad at me amen but that revelation will bring some stimulation I said that revelation will bring some stimulation brother Timothy I've been eating on this opening book and it is delicious I've been eating on this open book and it's stimulated my inner gastronomics I'm I'm having a gastronomical jubilee because there is body changing power there is body changing anointing come on you're not a natural young person you're not a natural generation you are the supernatural seed of the almighty God that has been sent into Satan's Eden to whip the God of this evil age but your feelings won't whip him and your emotions W with him but this revelation will whip the devil anywhere anytime any place under any [Applause] conditions I'm talking about a revelation that'll whip that devil on Monday it'll whip that devil on Tuesday it'll bring you to church on Wednesday it'll get you up on Thursday it'll get you through Friday it'll take you to church on Sunday I'm talking about a revelation that has come from the opening of the word now I'm getting ahead of myself here but brother said now watch I'm looking for a time of a great break for of the spirit of God in these last days we're now living in for another surge of the holy spirit in the church can I can I just stop here and say this you know why you're miserable it's CA you're when when somebody starts preaching on these things it's C you're eating things that they're just can I just say it they're just trash come on me if you if you're listening to radio preachers trying to figure out about the com of the Lord don't get mad at me but it's trash but what if I told you T not we can go get the real stuff what if I told you not there was a place we could throw the trash away and go get some good Revelation back back I hope it's okay to tell this Timothy back in September we brother Timothy and sister Ruth and sister Katie they met us down in in Texas Mar Malachi and just just we had a wonderful time with them just a couple days of get they just give us a wonderful time of rest and fellowship we went to an ice cream place there I think it was next last night and man they had all kinds of good reviews and everybody's talking about how good it was and you go in there and get the best ice cream in town so we all go in there you know and and we got a bowl of it we're all sitting around there and all of a sudden I took a couple bites but you know uh I'm not a pck eater right brother Timothy but but I wasn't going to say nothing cuz I I thought everybody else was enjoying it you know and all of a sudden God bless Timothy he said said this is trash I said Thank God somebody else believes it is amen amen he said fold this stuff away I said there's an andies down the road and I'll pay for it so we threw the trash away and went and got for real stuff and it was real good it had a good taste in it young people you ain't got to sit and eat a bunch of denominational trash there is a reality of the opening of the word you can feed on the truth of the seven Thunders you can feed on the truth of seven and seals you can feed on the truth of the third pull you can throw away the trash and go to the house of God and feed on the real stuff it's not a bunch of confusion it's spiritual food in new season it's got vitamins in it it's got Holy Ghost vitamins it's got body changing vitamins you can throw away the confusion and go eat on the Revelation until it releases a faith in your life to believe God for things beyond what your flesh will let you believe him for now you can throw away the trash and go get the real stuff and you'll have a lot better Services now I know what you're saying you're saying this Rapture in faith this way out there because brother Andrew you're saying it's Revelation well do you realize the denominations they don't even believe in Revelation y'all realize that they don't even believe in spiritual Revelation but can I say this the true church is built upon spiritual Revelation now Matthew 16 the Bible says that Jesus Come into the coast of cesaria Philippi and when he walked in there brother Caleb there was all the disciples and he just he just kind of kindly walked in there and he looks at him and he says now who do men say that I the son of man am now I want to say this you and just leave that picture there for just a second that one right there who do men say that I the son of man am well some say you're Elias and some say you're jeremias but no who do you say that I am now wait a second now he's making it personal so he got a collective answer but now brother Austin he wants an individual answer so now he's saying who do men say that I who do you say that that I am now this is what amazes me is out of all the people that was standing there out of all the disciples that could have spoke up and said something the one with the most mistakes the one with the most failures the one that was a cussing preacher he lost his temper and cut a man's hair off he denied God he had all kinds of issues but when it come time to declare who this man was he was the one that spoke up can I say this will you always remember this so if God used Peter to say that it must mean that Peter had more Revelation than mistakes it must mean that his Revelation was greater than all of his mistakes in other words he didn't get that by mistakes so mistakes couldn't take it away he got it by the spiritual revelation of the word of God that had been revealed to him not by the Flesh and Blood of man but by my Father which is in heaven well I want to put every devil on notice tonight there is a generation here we got a lot of mistakes we got a lot of failures we got a lot of insecurities we got a lot of things in our flesh but I want to leave you with this our Revelation is greater than our mistakes our mistakes didn't put us in so our mistakes can't take us out our mistakes didn't save us our mistakes didn't redeem us our mistakes didn't hallelujah our mistakes has no authority to take us out of the rapturing plan of almighty God now in other words what is that rock it's the spiritual revelation of the will of God can I say this when that picture there appeared nobody had any authority to understand what it was to some it was a smoke ship to some it was a rocket ship to some it was a space shuttle to some it was just a weird figure now listen as long as as long as that picture Samuel as long as that picture hung there that picture right there had no authority over you you say be careful that picture right there in that form had no authority over you because there was all kinds of guesses on what it was but in 1965 when a prophet walks to the pit and says now I'm going to tell you what he told me he said you turn it to the right he says now that is our Lord up there come on Church you're down here but you're trying to get up there come on Church he's not looking up because his body is not above him but he is looking down because he's looking for the ones who this Revelation is going to take preeminence in their lives and it's going to change their bodies well may I say today that you are the mystical body of Jesus Christ and the headship has come our Lord is not looking for a body he's got a body our Lord is not looking for somebody to believe this Revelation he's got somebody to believe this Revelation our Lord is not looking for somebody to say what a prophet said he's raised up a generation and has anointed them with an open book to say what a prophet has already said I don't know about you brother Nathaniel but that picture claimed me amen it claimed my life it claimed my future it claimed the way I talk it claimed the way I walk it claimed the way I sing it claimed the way I shout it claimed the way I worship listen y'all get mad at me if you want to but I've been claimed for Rapture I have been claimed for the Rapture of the church you say preacher this ain't much of a prayerline sermon well if I can get you to believe if that word has claimed you for a body change then you can easily believe that when you come through this prayer line tonight he's going to heal you he's going to deliver you he's going to restore you he's going to feel you he's going to renew you if I can get you married to believe a hard message then you can believe anything that God says [Applause] now young people let me say this that's not just a picture that's [Music] Revelation and I can say this day Revelation 101 is fulfilled in your ears in your ears that scripture has been fulfilled now let me ask you this what got you to this point what got you to where you're standing today cuz some of y'all had friends to walk off and leave come on now some of y'all had pastors to turn back on you and quit preaching the message and just walk away and leave you some of y'all has had situations that should have killed you years ago but you're still here can I tell you what did it revelation [Applause] what got you here was Revelation what got you through the Darkest Hours was Revelation what brought you to the most confusing moments was Revelation listen there was a time you couldn't clo a good quot and put a good scripture with it but there was something oh god there was something on the inside of you that caused you to say though the Lord slay me yet I will trust him amen can we just get real for a minute can we just get real really real for a minute and just confess that the only reason we're still standing is because the revelation of Jesus Christ was far superior to everything to every situation to every problem to every circumstance to every disappointment let me say this I rose up this morning because of Revelation but let me say this if that Revelation got you on your feet and the Devil Couldn't defeat it in he will not defeat that Revelation from changing your body devil it's too late I said it's too late the Revelation has already taken preeminence it's not just coming it's here it's in flesh form it's here in body form it's here in blood form might well come on somebody just get loose with me for a minute and say devil you should have got me when you could you should have got me when you had a chance you should have wh me when you had a chance you should have got me before this Revelation got me because this Revelation has claimed my body for a change in the moment in the twen of an eye hell can't stop it the Grave can't defeat it Devils can't defeat it Spirits can't discourage it it is the Invincible prevailing power of the Revelation Oh Glory Glory Glory that Revelation is in this building tonight and it's defeating Devils of it's defeating all kinds of devils and you're Rising now let me just say this to you there was a Baptist preacher called brother BR one day he said brother brandom he said I want to he said I want to straighten you out on your godhead amen I hate to ask this but it's getting cool up here so that can be turned up or something amen amen you want to straighten you out on your godhead teaching re said I got good time now he said straighten me up now he said brother Adam he said you teach there's one God he said that's wrong he said now listen he said there's one God in three persons brother said now listen you cannot be a person without being a personality and if you are a personality you are one personality yourself you're a separate individual being he said well the theologians can't even explain that so here's a Baptist preacher telling a Vindicated word Prophet that the theologians cannot even explain that here's what he said brother Caleb it's by Revelation so here it's not coming by what you can learn it's coming by how you can receive what's being revealed and I said now now now now now can I can I tell you what this Baptist preacher said he says these words I cannot accept Revelation wrap those words in your mind if you can I cannot accept Revelation now listen to The Prophet well I said then there's no way for God to ever get to you so the way that God accesses your life is by Revelation because it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent but is revealed to babes he says revealed Revelation revealed to babes such as will accept it learn I said there' be no way for God to get to you now now I'm turning a corner now he said you close yourself off from him the whole Bible is the revelation of God the whole church is built upon the revelation of God there's no other way to know God Only by Revelation to whom the son will reveal him he said Revelation everything somebody say this with me everything is revelation now Weist said to the prophet not to accept Revelation then you're just a cold theologian and there is no hope for you if you cannot accept Revelation you become a cold Theologian and there is no hope for you you shut yourself off from God now I'm going to goe and preach since I'm this close to it we get in our mind that the only place that theologians are is in the Pulpit we think the only place that a theologian is in church is in the Pulpit but don't get mad at me but I preached a lot of theologians in the pews I can tell right now I'm preaching to somebody your facial expressions because here's what's happened you've learned and you figured out how God can never touch you again he can never bless you again he can never minister to you again he can never show you anything because you did this and you said that and you looked at that and you fa him here and so what you've done is you let a bunch of intellectual theology from the pits of hell put a wall around you and the word can't get to you the anointing can't get to you well don't get mad at me but you're a cold theolog oian but I'm going to say it's it's in the wrong place tonight because this ain't an ice house this is a firehouse this ain't a bunch of icicles this is the Holy Ghost in Fire and the fire of God will burn that thing down and God will get to you my God will tear down the walls of Jericho to get to his children my God will dop the red see to deliver his children let me say this can I preach to you now hope is returning tonight hope is coming back hope is coming back I've gone too far I can't be blessed I can't be healed I can't ever Shout again I can't ever dance again I can't never believe again that's what theology said but Revelation says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Revelation says that he is the God above all he is the god with you all he is the god in you all Revelation says though a thousand fall at one side and 10,000 at the other it will not come now [Applause] thee can you help me preach tonight look at somebody next to you and say these words Revelation brings hope you told the wrong person tell somebody else Revelation brings hope brother Peter Revelation brings hope brother silus Revelation I know it's the devil don't like it but I don't care Revelation brings hope sister an Revelation brings hope my Revelation brings hope are y'all hearing me theology shuts God off from you theology puts God away from from you theology puts you a little old corner and you can't hear nothing and you can't believe nothing but when the revelation of the word of God begins to break in the atmosphere that Revelation come on Church you know what I'm talking about y'all know what I'm talking about Revelation brings hope sister Katie Revelation brings hope in the darkest nights it brings hope in the darkest days when it looks like everything's falling apart but Revelation Rises up and says there is hope well I want to say this tonight I'm not preaching to a bunch of hopers helpless individuals sister ran I'm preaching to the Bride of Jesus Christ who is Anointed to receive the Revelation devil get out of here it ain't over till God says it's over it ain't finished till God says it's finished I might have failed my first chance but he's the god of a second chance he's the god of a third chance he's the god of a fourth chance he's the god of 100 chances this message brings hope come on it brings hope to the poor it brings hope to the rich it brings hope to the whites it brings hope to the black it brings Hope come on church this is a message of hope it's a revelation now now now when the devil traps you you know what he says you can't get out of here you're trapped you're defeated it's over it's finished you might as well just lay down and lay out to see you and accept the fact you're not getting out of here but devil you're a liar I said devil you're a liar you told that to the wrong group of people that is our hope up there I'm not staying in Leonia cuz he ain't in Leonia I'm not staying in confusion cuz he ain't in confusion but I'm going to turn my head toward the heels from which cometh my help the Lord is the lifter of my head I'm I'm going to look away to Jesus and I'm going to see him as the hope to get out of way without to see you as the Hope to come over all the situations he is the revelation of Hope and if you can see him you can see a new day oh if you can see him you can see a new future if you can see him you can see that the past is the past and it's in the sea of forgetfulness and there's a Hope by the revelation of the open book that's in the church tonight Hallelujah I'm not a crazy man I just feel like dancing cuz I got hope I was hopeless but now I got hope I shouldn't be here but I'm here anyhow because of that hope he is my [Applause] hope if the devil gets you in the valley he'll convince you that is going to bury you but all I can say is he better hope he picks the right [Music] Valley brother Gideon he better hope he picks the right Valley if he's going to bury this bride he better do some research on What's happen in the valley he's got you in now y'all remember Joshua and Israel don't you the Bible says that Israel was the people of God brother Kobe I believe it's anointed to win right Israel was the people of God right God was on their side can I say this to you there was to never be a battle that Israel went into that they lost not supposed to happen there's never supposed to be one battle that Israel goes into and they lose it brother elah every battle they go into God is on their side in other words if they lose that means God can't win the battle to the devil if they lose that means that God is Not on their side and God is not able to win the battle but can I say this my God never loses even when it looks like he's lost he never loses even when it looks like that the devil has come in for the final kill and it looks like he got the W and we got the L he still is the loser I might as well preach there for a second brother Josh he is the loser the devil is the loser but I want to tell you tonight because of our hope because of our hope we are the winner we are the winners we are the generation who has been Anointed with the open book to win every battle [Applause] come on I don't know how else to say it other than when Mary heard the word all she could say was be it unto me according to the word now Israel was a promised people of Victory get somebody say the devil better pick the right Valley this feels good Josh the devil better pick the right Valley now let me say this Israel went and they fought the Battle of Jericho and they won the Battle of Jericho which was a really big battle but a few days later they go to another battle and it's called The Battle of AI or we can say it like this artificial intelligence no I'm just kidding they went from the Battle of Jericho which was a really big battle to a battle of AI and they lost so they won the big battle but they went to the little Battle of AI and they lost now when they lost Joshua didn't say well I guess God left the message when they lost Joshua didn't say well God was with brother badam so I don't guess he's with me well I guess he was with the ones before us but he's not with us now no Joshua knew if we lost there's something wrong and the Bible said that Joshua went and fell on his face and the Lord revealed to him that there was sin in the camp the Lord showed him amen that there was sin in the camp and the sin in the camp was aen and his family you know what aen done he took a gold wedge amen and took it into his tent amen and buried it underneath his tent and Israel went from Jericho to Ai and lost the battle now watch this amen because there was sin in the temp now you all know what happens amen as Joshua goes down there I love this and Israel and they burned Aon and his family they didn't play with Devils they burned him ain't politically correct I know but they didn't play with Devils they burned them they went down there to achen and they burned him and they burned his family and they burned his tent and they took his ashes and his family's ashes and they spread him out in the valley and covered them up with rocks now watch when Israel done that the next thing they did was they went to another battle and they was Victorious are you hearing me so ain's Valley his bones in ashes and his family is in a valley let me just say this to you if you go to the book of H of Hosea the 2 chapter and the 14th verse you will find that the book of Hosea is a beautiful story of redemption in other words Hosea is a prophet and Hosea knows all the mistakes he knows all the failures he knows all the shortcomings of Israel but he looks back at God and says God with all of their mistakes and with all their failures and with all the whoredoms and all the idolatry things how can you still love them how can you still go in a UK in an Oklahoma Youth Camp and bless them with the anointing and bless them with the refreshing listen we know what they've done Lord can I preach to you we know what they've done in other words Hosea was looking at God and saying God I don't understand how that you know all the oh my that devil don't like this you know all the mistakes of them and you still love them so Hosea begins to question Lord now let me just put it to you like this maybe the over look at Hosea and say Hosea let me show you something amen you go marry yourself a harlot and you have kids by her and then you'll understand why that I cannot forget Israel in other words they are a part of me and I am a redeemer and I cannot allow them to be destroyed they might have lost one battle but they're not going to lose every battle because I am their God I am on their side I am their comfort I am their F I am their General I am their [Applause] captain now if you go to Hosea 2 in the book of Hosea 2:14 look at this scripture therefore behold I will Allure her and will bring her into the Wilderness and will speak comfortably unto her so here God is telling Hosea through a story of redemption oh God go and Allure her amen now can I say this to you look at what this word Allure means this word this word Allure it means to attract her by opening something testing one two testing it's still working it means to attract her by open opening something so she's already defeated she's already got a bad reputation she's already in a bad way but God tells Hosea you go out there and you Allure her oh God you get her attention by opening something to her now you all know what that word aure means it means to attract and the pro of God said the word of God Amen attracts the bride of Christ now watch this and I will give her Vineyards from th verse 15 I will would give her Vineyards from fence now watch this and the valley of acor for a Door of Hope I will give her the valley of acor but watch what he says as a Door of Hope come on Church how was the valley of acor a Door of Hope when achen was burned and his family was burned and they were buried in the valley but God said I will lure her to the valley of acor you know what what that tells me that is a sign that Israel lost one battle but when they dealt with their sin and God forgive their iniquities they went back in the battle and they were stronger then than they were when they lost at the Battle of AI oh Church a living God that's why I said Satan if you're going to bury us in a valley you better pick the right Valley if you're going to bury us in a valley you better make sure there's not an anointing of victory and Power in the signs of that Valley I will Allure her in other words the mighty angel will come down she will be in leosa come on church she will be in leadsa she will be in the midst of confusion but some mighty angel will come down and he will have an open book and when he opens that book he will get your attention and when he gets your attention he will be begin to Allure you he will begin to Allure you by the opening of the word to the door of hope God I wish I was a preacher right now are y'all hearing me he will Allure you by the open of the word to the door of Hope in other words you got to get out of leosia you cannot stay here you were not born for Leia but there's only one way that you can get out of Leota is there has to come a direct message from God through an angel and it will be the opening of the word and it will get your attention and it will Allure you I'm closing now put your walking shoes on Church put your walking shoes on we're getting ready to walk tonight we're getting ready to walk we've been in The Valleys we've been in the situations but we're getting ready to walk through the door of hope we're getting ready to walk through a door of Hope and Jesus is the door and Jesus is the Revelation and Jesus is the Hope come on Church it ain't over till God says it's over there's a Door of Hope in py Oklahoma tonight I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to do what God told me to do in my camper and I'm going to quit he said you go down there and you preach the revelation of that word and tell them there's a Door of Hope and if they'll believe it they can walk through it you ain't got to stay in that condition anymore you might have lost once but you ain't losing again you might have been defeated once but you ain't

escape you ain't got to stay in confusion you ain't got to stay in family curses you ain't got to stay in generational curses you ain't got to live under the complexes of your family tree there is a door of hope that has been opened by the revelation of the Angel's message there's a Door of Hope the devil put us in the wrong Valley sister Sonica he put us in the wrong Valley brother Jason he

Door of Hope get out of the confusion get out of the sickness get out of the unbelief get out of the complexes get out of the Devils of Doubt there a door that's been open it's a door of hope it's a

Health you can step from weakness into strength you can step from depression into Joy you can step from confusion into Revelation you can step from cloudy days into the riseing the sunnd B it's already open it's already open man you mean there is a place where I can worship God freely you mean there is a place where I can enjoy the house of God you mean there is a place where the Tormentor can't torment God have mercy there's a door it's open it's called the opening of the word brother Lind you remember what it was like when you used to sit out there outside the pastor's door and pray and wait hope somebody got got a word for you but then there was a Door of Hope yeah there's a woman with a with a little baby and he's laying there dying because she's running out of meal and she's running out of oil things are drying up she has no hope she goes out there brother Caleb she says I want to take this last little bit of meal and I'm going to take this last little bit of oil and I'm going to bake a cake and I'm going to feed it to my son and we're going to sit down and we're going to die because we're hopeless we're hopeless things can't change we're out of meal we're out of oil we can't live like this but then all of a sudden oh God all of a sudden she was bending over that barrel trying to scoop out the that last little bit of that last little bit of meal and she heard these words good evening friends good evening friends good evening friends and she turned and [Applause] said a voice you know what it was it was a voice of Hope brother Bram the audio letter to Le Val he says these words he says in order to Proclaim this speaking of this Revelation that he's given he said God has to send a prophet in order to inject this to make this real again to show the people the hour we're living in because if they only see it in the hour past then there's no hope for the church the church must see it in the present tense so God sends his Prophet to manifest present tense of it what are you saying brother Ander I'm saying this and I'm closing tonight I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them and neither did I turn again till they were all consumed brother B says I wonder that tonight if we could climb above the heavens of heaven and look at this great drama as it's getting set together now fixing to come to pass are y'all hearing me right now I'm taking just a few minutes right now to build a platform for this prayer line there's a great drama getting together now fixing to come to pass of God and the devil coming to a showdown can I preach to you right now some of y'all are working so hard right now to figure out how you going to get through that door of Hope well if I can do this and if I can say that if I can do this and if I can than that and oh God lord if if I can just but no God what if I told you this is how you going to do it you ready brother Jude how hard was that and one step will turn into two steps and two steps will turn into three steps and four steps will turn into five steps and come on you know what footsteps are they're possession footsteps are possession so go ahead and step through that open door and start possessing every Redemptive blessing that Christ died for you to have he has allured you by the opening of the word to put your foot on every promise brother Matt last night we put our foot on the devil didn't we we put our foot on the devil and we defeated that devil but how about tonight we put our foot on our promises why don't we just put our foot on the promise of the Holy Ghost why don't we possess the land of of Joy why don't we Poss possess the land of anointing come on Joshua generation it's time to rise up and put your foot on your inheritance and possess it you're anointed to win brother Austin We're Not anointed to lose we are anointed to win Hallelujah brother back we're not anointed to just go to camp and go back home and go back to losing we're winners we're winers winners young man we're winners we're not just winners at Camp we're winners at home we're Salem we're not just winners at Camp buddy we're winners in school we're winners in brother CB we're winners brother Judah we're winners wherever we go we're [Applause] winners now do you see why the devil hates the book of Revelation hates the truth he knows the truth will prevail he knows what his end will be how he fights that but we are on the winning side and brother bradam says we I mean the Believers of his word only the Believers of his word only are on the amen side now now now we started here Thursday night and we're what five services in tonight can I say something to you and I promise I'm trying to quit when the angel come to Mary and he gives her the message he starts telling her this and tell telling her that and telling her this and telling her that he goes through all these things and when they're having this conversation brother Caleb there sometimes she stops him and she says how what me you're going to use me to but the angel kept on talking on yes sir and by the time the angel got done can I say this to you don't ever forget this okay the Angel's message had so defeated Mary's flesh that the only thing she could say when the angel delivered his message the only thing she could muster up enough strength to say was be it unto me according to my word the Angel's message robbed her of every excuse it stripped her of every idea it's so weakened her flesh that the only thing she could do was agree with the Angel's message the only thing she could say was it's the truth Lord but the Caleb in other words the Angel's message so brought her flesh into submission that her flesh couldn't even argue with a revelation well Church of the Living God that same thing for sister Shak has been happening right here this weekend from the first night until now the message has been robbing your flesh and whipping your flesh and defeating your flesh and now you're in position to say be it unto me Lord according to Thy word you're in position right now to say tonights my Nots I'm going to get the Holy Ghost I'm going to get [Applause] delivered the message of the hour has put you in a position to walk let our musicians come tonight y'all forgive me but he's here tonight I said he's here how many believes he's here I'm having to skip over a lot here how many believes this is an adoption messag amen how many believes you are the adopted generation that's right brother opens up adoption part one and says now listen I'm subject to anything that God wants to use me for if God when I was an alien from him so loved me did he stoop down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he wants to use me yeah he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you brother B said if he can reveal to me by the Holy Spirit the resurrected Christ to come here and give me a temporary Resurrection by my spirit that my spirit goes away now and his Spirit comes in then to let you know whether he's alive or not now I don't know you that's me me and my spirit we don't know you but he knows you but he wants to Bor my body to prove that he's the resurrected Christ how many preachers have I got in here tonight let me see your hands hi preachers God is fing to use your body your hands to prove to these young people he's alive yes I'm not playing I didn't fight all hell in the bad voice voice to get here and play that's right brother B said I'm so happy to loan it to him to give it to him anything he can get out of it what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying tonight his power of faith is here can I leave you at this and we are undefeatable by the revelation in a few moments we're going to have a prayer line now is it okay if I just say it was talking about a prayer line today and I was praying I said Lord whatever you want you show me we'll have one if it's your will and brother Nathan as clear as I'm speaking to you right now Spirit of the Lord just dropped up there in the room and said these words make this prayer line A Door of Hope somebody in here needs to step through it now I'm going to say this I know there's a lot of devils like to criticize prayer lines but if you needed a door hope you'd be thankful they had one on the night you needed it ain't that right buddy if you was wor some of these kids right now you ought to shout that they had one the night you needed it as a matter of fact open that door Miguel I rebuke that critical devil it can leave in the name of Jesus Christ it's got to go this prayer line is not an ego it's not a personality it's not building a bunch of preachers it's men loing their body to God as a door to stand here and give these young people a chance to walk through a door of Hope to step out of addictions to step out of suicidal thoughts to step out of depression to step out of anxiety to step out of nervousness to step out of depression
