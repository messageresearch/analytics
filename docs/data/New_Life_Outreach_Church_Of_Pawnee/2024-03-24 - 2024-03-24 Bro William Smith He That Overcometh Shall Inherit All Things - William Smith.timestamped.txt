[41:26] 21
[41:35] and you're welcome to uh turn these
[41:39] monitors down some you can focus on the
[41:42] big
[41:44] ones but praise the
[41:46] Lord this thing's going to make a lot of
[41:49] Racket ain't it man I don't like holding
[41:52] the mics
[41:56] but
[42:02] W does so good with his but he has I
[42:05] found out he started putting it on his
[42:07] little vest and uh I'm too fat for
[42:11] casual vest so I can't do like our
[42:14] pastor does but we just thank the Lord
[42:17] this
[42:18] morning keep him in our prayers this
[42:21] morning you know he's he's an example
[42:25] that we can look on when it comes to
[42:29] being sick I've seen him many times be
[42:33] here preaching and holding it the best
[42:36] he can and then run to the bathroom and
[42:39] vomit and walk out the door and go
[42:41] home and uh so if he's home this morning
[42:45] we know that he's he's not capable to be
[42:48] here and uh cuz he don't miss church
[42:51] very often and so if you love your
[42:55] pastor I believe I would enter in to
[42:58] that secret place and pray for him this
[43:02] morning Revelations 21 and7 it says he
[43:06] that overcometh shall inherit all things
[43:10] and I will be his God and I
[43:14] shall and he shall be my
[43:17] son she shall be my
[43:20] daughter in first John
[43:26] 5
[43:28] it says here from 1 John 5
[43:31] And1 whosoever believeth that Jesus is
[43:35] the Christ is born of God and everyone
[43:38] that loveth him that begotten loveth him
[43:42] also that is begotten of him by this we
[43:47] know that we love the children of God
[43:50] when we love God and keep his
[43:54] Commandments for this is the love of God
[43:57] that we keep his Commandments and his
[44:00] Commandments are not grieved for
[44:03] whosoever is born of God overcometh the
[44:05] world and this is the victory that
[44:08] overcometh the world even our faith who
[44:12] is he that overcometh the world but he
[44:15] that believeth that Jesus is the son of
[44:18] God go back to Revelations for one more
[44:21] verse or one more yeah one more verse
[44:24] Revelations 2 and 7
[44:30] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[44:33] the spirit sayi unto the churches to him

[48:47] love him this
[48:48] morning
[48:51] Hallelujah my
[48:54] thought and brother wend was
[48:59] preaching I uh had this written down in
[49:04] my my paper
[49:07] and
[49:09] Overcomer and uh and so when he was
[49:14] reading Wednesday night I thought oh my
[49:18] goodness this is on my paper and and
[49:21] here in the church age book at the very
[49:25] beginning that morning that that service
[49:27] he starts
[49:29] reading and I want to go over something
[49:31] here just for a moment for my my thought
[49:36] this morning and it was really really
[49:39] powerful and he says God intend his
[49:43] creation man to express his word in
[49:48] Genesis Adam was given the word to live
[49:52] by a life living by the word would be
[49:56] the word
[49:58] expressed that is true isn't it but did
[50:02] Adam live by the word no because he was
[50:06] a
[50:07] living he was to live by every word and
[50:12] he failed to take heed to every
[50:16] word to me brothers and sisters we can
[50:20] take that ourselves as a
[50:23] daily portion to make make
[50:27] sure that we are living the Living
[50:34] Word sometimes we put ourselves in the
[50:37] way and God can't bless you and I
[50:40] because we put ourselves
[50:42] there we let our emotions overwhelm us
[50:47] sometimes we let this mind of ours start
[50:52] clicking and before long you get a
[50:55] complex over somebody and it's just the
[50:59] devil I've had many people come to me
[51:01] and apologize because they had a problem
[51:04] with me but they didn't even know
[51:06] understand why it's because of the
[51:11] devil you know I'm the type of person
[51:13] that if it's really serious I'll go to
[51:15] that person and tell them hey you know
[51:18] you're irritating me or or whatever but
[51:21] if it's just something little stupid
[51:24] things I just say you know you Old Devil
[51:27] back off of my sister or my brother
[51:30] right I look at it differently than some
[51:33] people that get
[51:35] complexes yes because the complexes I do
[51:39] get once in a while they're not
[51:42] fun but there
[51:45] is a remedy that's true amen there is a
[51:50] way that we become
[51:54] Overcomers and this morning morning I
[51:56] would like to speak here this morning on
[52:00] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[52:06] things now remember only Believers only
[52:10] the elect comes to it to that that God
[52:15] has chosen
[52:16] you I believe that in Revelations 2 says
[52:20] he that
[52:21] overcometh so it's a promise to
[52:25] Overcomers right right amen so you have
[52:28] been promised to be an overcomer that's
[52:31] right
[52:32] amen saints of God I would be getting
[52:37] very happy to know that I could be an
[52:39] overcomer
[52:41] amen I would be asking God how can I be
[52:44] more of an overcomer of
[52:47] me sometimes we we put our emphasis on
[52:51] Satan so much that he sits there and
[52:54] takes takes it because he's got you
[52:57] already thinking the other direction
[53:00] that's true and sometimes it's
[53:03] you sometimes it's brother William gets
[53:05] in the way of the flow of God coming
[53:09] down and giving us our portion that we
[53:12] can have strength to be an overcomer
[53:16] okay and sometimes we just need to sit
[53:19] back and say mind mind your own business
[53:23] yeah that's right amen that's good and
[53:26] get that mind being
[53:30] fed by this Mana that's right from this
[53:34] Mana that God has stored up for this day
[53:38] in this
[53:39] Wilderness every morning there's fresh
[53:42] Mana to eat that's right
[53:46] Hallelujah and so we have to come to a
[53:49] place that we believe in these promises
[53:53] if we don't believe in those promises
[53:55] then we're not going to get into the
[53:57] word to find out who we really are
[54:01] that's right if we say that we are the
[54:03] bride of Christ then we are getting
[54:05] ourselves ready am we're not going
[54:09] backwards but we're getting ourselves
[54:11] ready for a Rapture we're getting
[54:14] ourselves ready for a wedding supper
[54:17] we're getting ourselves ready to come
[54:18] back with God and destroy everything
[54:21] that ever tempts
[54:23] you you're getting ready to go to
[54:26] Eternity with
[54:30] God but it's lies down into your own
[54:38] Hearts you say I
[54:42] overcome I come over excuse me I
[54:44] overcome smoking that ain't what he's
[54:47] talking
[54:49] about
[54:50] these a whole lot more going to
[54:54] Christianity besides
[54:57] not smoking cigarettes or drinking
[54:59] whiskey he that overcome shall inherit
[55:03] all things and he will be my son she
[55:08] will be my
[55:10] daughter I will be his God I will be her
[55:15] God I will give him of the Hidden
[55:21] Mana the hidden Mana what is that hidden
[55:25] Mana
[55:28] we got people out in other churches
[55:31] today reading the scriptures and they're
[55:34] doing their little
[55:36] preaching and they're eating
[55:39] Mana but are they really realizing the
[55:43] true Mana of God that's coming down for
[55:46] this day to feed you little
[55:50] bride it's something that o makes you be
[55:52] an
[55:53] overcomer it makes you have faith
[55:56] it makes you believe it makes you have
[55:59] muscles of Faith to be an overcomer this
[56:03] day you're not relying on a church
[56:06] you're not relying on your pastor you're
[56:08] relying on every word that proceedeth
[56:10] out of the mouth of God for your
[56:13] abortion for that
[56:17] day we get so worried about everybody
[56:20] else what about
[56:23] me brother William why aren't you
[56:25] worrying about yourself
[56:28] oh are you going to go in the
[56:30] Rapture sometimes we need to turn around
[56:32] and look in a mirror and say what about
[56:35] you
[56:37] sir what are you doing Mr
[56:45] hypocrite but we got to get to a
[56:49] place where we're feeding off of the
[56:52] Living Word of God
[56:55] only only that's right
[57:02] hallelujah amen he says I will hide him
[57:07] away I will give him the hidden things
[57:12] the world on the outside of this curtain
[57:16] don't know nothing about
[57:19] it it's a secret race it's a secret
[57:24] generation it's a love Affair between
[57:27] the king of
[57:28] kings and his little lady
[57:34] Esther he watches her in the
[57:37] Kingdom how she presents herself how
[57:40] she's
[57:43] asking what does a king
[57:48] like what does he what does he like me
[57:50] to
[57:52] wear if I go in to him what should I do
[57:56] how should I walk how should I
[58:04] talk just be
[58:07] yourself be Sons and Daughters of
[58:11] God that's what he wants yes he wants
[58:15] you to know this so much that this
[58:18] becomes
[58:22] you praise be to
[58:25] God
[58:28] you get what I mean entering into the
[58:32] adoption or the hidden place with
[58:37] God now listen to this this is this
[58:40] is
[58:43] awesome every one of you in here have
[58:47] been born by a
[58:49] woman
[58:53] right and when you were born you were a
[58:56] son or you as a daughter to that little
[58:59] lady that birthed
[59:00] you and that Daddy that's sitting over
[59:03] there white fixing to pass
[59:09] out but you are Sons but do you realize
[59:14] Church you were Sons and Daughters of
[59:17] God before you were even in her
[59:21] belly before you were even thought of as
[59:24] a mom and daddy coming into this Earth
[59:27] you were already Sons and Daughters of
[59:31] God one day when the word come by you
[59:34] said wait a
[59:36] minute something clicked in your mind
[59:39] something went down into your heart and
[59:41] you said wait a minute I want to serve
[59:43] that
[59:43] God and you go to the altar you go to
[59:46] your knees you go in your car and you
[59:48] start crying out to God and you ask him
[59:50] to come into your heart you then you
[59:53] just recognize that you were sons and
[59:55] daughters of God you are already a son
[1:00:00] you are already a daughter you already
[1:00:04] had everything in you then to go through
[1:00:07] a
[1:00:09] Rapture everything you need of was
[1:00:12] already in
[1:00:14] you you just needed the blueprints to
[1:00:18] find out how to get it in the reality of
[1:00:22] your
[1:00:24] life so everyone of you are Sons and
[1:00:27] Daughters of God he created you in the
[1:00:31] image of God in flesh form but now he
[1:00:35] wants that Spirit to come down into you
[1:00:37] to magnify you to show you that you
[1:00:41] are not of this
[1:00:45] Earth but you are in From Another
[1:00:49] Place Another Kingdom that you rule
[1:00:52] right beside your savior Hallelujah
[1:00:59] so this hidden
[1:01:02] place of
[1:01:03] God it's a secret thing to the world
[1:01:07] they don't know nothing about it they
[1:01:08] think we're
[1:01:09] crazy but you are resting upon every
[1:01:13] word that proceeded out of the mouth of
[1:01:15] God because you believe the word for
[1:01:18] this
[1:01:19] day
[1:01:21] amen and you're waiting for the body
[1:01:24] change the com complete
[1:01:27] adoption but this this this
[1:01:30] transformation from the time you gave
[1:01:32] your heart to God until then that is
[1:01:36] placing you higher and higher up to the
[1:01:39] place where one day he's going to
[1:01:43] completely adopt you and you're going to
[1:01:45] have the fullness of the power of God
[1:01:47] laying on
[1:01:51] you
[1:01:52] then you walk on this Earth for 30 to 40
[1:01:57] days in total
[1:02:00] power but until then you have the
[1:02:02] earnest of that great power to move
[1:02:06] every devil everything that comes in
[1:02:08] your way he has given you thus sayth the
[1:02:13] Lord
[1:02:15] hallelujah through that that's why you
[1:02:18] can say I shall and H all
[1:02:23] things because why your sons and
[1:02:27] daughters of the living most high
[1:02:30] God now I want you to put yourself here
[1:02:33] I'm going to say ministers but you put
[1:02:35] yourself there when I say it I want you
[1:02:37] to say your name out loud all right I'm
[1:02:41] not picking on ministers all right I'm
[1:02:44] not even picking on you guys but I'm
[1:02:46] using this quote for a purpose brother
[1:02:49] rown says this he says Ministers of the
[1:02:52] Gospel how many he of the Gospel I'll
[1:02:55] read raise my hand up as just as a
[1:02:57] Christian cuz let me tell you something
[1:02:59] Sisters You Preach a better sermon than
[1:03:01] we do when you walk out these doors your
[1:03:04] life proves who you are I can go down to
[1:03:08] the Baptist and look just like the rest
[1:03:10] of them but there's something on the
[1:03:12] inside's different when you start
[1:03:15] speaking God I tell the
[1:03:17] truth see but these sisters prove
[1:03:22] they're in the gospel many people have
[1:03:25] been saved because of our sisters living
[1:03:27] a gospel life in front of people and God
[1:03:31] bless each and every one of you for
[1:03:34] that don't care about your
[1:03:38] denominations and what the world thinks
[1:03:41] but seek in I mean seek to enter in to
[1:03:46] the hidden Mana where the full
[1:03:50] revelation of God is making love perfect
[1:03:53] in your heart
[1:03:58] sometimes we're looking out here more
[1:04:00] than we're in
[1:04:03] there listen those denominations are
[1:04:06] doing exactly what God said they were
[1:04:08] going to
[1:04:12] be there is many classes are going to
[1:04:14] heaven that we don't
[1:04:18] understand the blood of God is going to
[1:04:20] save so many people that you won't even
[1:04:24] understand God has the elect lady he's
[1:04:28] got a foolish bride a foolish virgin
[1:04:31] that he's going to to to give them uh
[1:04:34] the same
[1:04:36] overpowering faith when it's their time
[1:04:39] to get their heads cut
[1:04:42] off the 144,000 Jews every tribe is
[1:04:47] about 12,000 Jews of each tribe makes up
[1:04:51] this 144,000
[1:04:53] Jews all right there going to receive
[1:04:56] the same blood atonement that you
[1:04:59] did when they recognize Jesus Christ
[1:05:02] through those two
[1:05:04] prophets they're going to be more than
[1:05:06] Overcomers when they see that they're
[1:05:07] going to say oh Lord forgive me for
[1:05:10] killing my
[1:05:12] Lord just like you did on the
[1:05:15] altar but they'll have to give their
[1:05:17] life physically life you only have to
[1:05:20] give this life now surrender it all to
[1:05:24] him and let him m magnify his holy
[1:05:27] spirit through you the word of God
[1:05:29] through you to speak every truth every
[1:05:32] sign every Wonder every Power every
[1:05:35] healing everything that God has promised
[1:05:38] for this day comes out of your mouth Yes

[1:05:46] said so he said
[1:05:49] so all you young ladies just remember

[1:06:04] 100% man only has two things on their
[1:06:09] mind and it's not even
[1:06:13] good but when a man has the Holy Ghost
[1:06:16] Inside of him he's going to respect you
[1:06:19] as a daughter of
[1:06:22] God and he's going to love you as a
[1:06:26] daughter of God in respect who you
[1:06:29] are they won't want to do anything to
[1:06:31] shame

[1:08:19] question have you ever come to a place
[1:08:22] in your life where Christ mean meant
[1:08:26] more to you than all the arguments you
[1:08:29] could do about your
[1:08:33] church as Christ means more to you than
[1:08:36] all the
[1:08:37] world I don't mean from an emotional or
[1:08:41] a mental workup I mean from the depths
[1:08:45] of your heart that something settled in
[1:08:49] there that something takes place that
[1:08:53] you don't know how to to come but you're
[1:08:58] hid away and your whole motive is to
[1:09:01] serve Jesus
[1:09:03] Christ have you entered that
[1:09:07] place dear brother dear sister have you
[1:09:10] come into that place where you don't
[1:09:14] care what anyone says not to go out and
[1:09:19] act smart but till the love of God Is So
[1:09:24] Anchored In Your Heart heart that you
[1:09:26] can't see nothing else your whole motive
[1:09:29] is to do the will of God love everybody
[1:09:34] flowing free from
[1:09:36] everywhere what a place to live what a
[1:09:40] hidden place that's the place where we
[1:09:44] got to come to my brother my sister

[1:09:51] secret
[1:09:54] things

[1:10:21] that's going to give you that great love
[1:10:24] to be Overcomers
[1:10:28] there's only one place that God provided
[1:10:31] and that's through this Holy Bible
[1:10:33] through Malachi
[1:10:35] 4 oh we can read other books and get the
[1:10:39] get the get the idea of maybe the
[1:10:43] symbols why they had to do the certain
[1:10:45] ways of of each sacrifice and that's
[1:10:49] good knowledge go ahead it's great I'm

[1:17:10] down I just don't understand brother
[1:17:12] brandham lay it down and read it and
[1:17:15] follow the word of God and let the Bible
[1:17:18] prove Malachai
[1:17:21] for I had a third grade education but I
[1:17:25] tried to prove this man wrong and every
[1:17:28] time I did I saw him here before long I
[1:17:31] said okay I'm done I'm done I just
[1:17:35] believe I laid it
[1:17:37] down and today you're not going to get
[1:17:39] rid of me believ brother Brandon is not
[1:17:42] the prophet he is the
[1:17:46] prophet and anybody says that we only
[1:17:49] need this well he is about as dumb as a
[1:17:52] bunch of rocks because brother BRS in
[1:17:55] the Bible Malachi
[1:17:59] 4 you can prove it by Malachi 4 tell him
[1:18:04] go read it prove to me that he ain't in
[1:18:07] the
[1:18:10] Bible people get so in tune of what they
[1:18:15] think is right instead of letting that
[1:18:18] go and let God flow through them and
[1:18:21] show them thus sayith the Lord way
[1:18:25] yes
[1:18:27] amen maybe our pastors wouldn't get so
[1:18:30] gray-headed
[1:18:34] sometimes not trying to be funny but
[1:18:36] it's the
[1:18:38] truth see God could not push you through
[1:18:42] a little
[1:18:44] pipe pull us out on the other side and
[1:18:47] say blessed is he that
[1:18:51] overcometh you had nothing to overcome
[1:18:56] he just pushed you through but you've
[1:19:00] got to make a decision for
[1:19:03] yourself I have to make a dis decision
[1:19:06] for
[1:19:07] myself in doing that we show our faith
[1:19:11] and respect to
[1:19:15] God you're going through these trials
[1:19:18] brother Mitch is going through that
[1:19:19] trial because there's some gold there is
[1:19:22] a diamond that's coming out on the other
[1:19:28] side
[1:19:30] Hallelujah all the Mind battles brother
[1:19:33] Joe that you've been through all these
[1:19:34] times and now you've been serving God

[1:19:39] rough brother Williams a diamond in a
[1:19:42] rough but it's going to be a beautiful
[1:19:48] Diamond

[1:20:29] there times You' drop it but more you
[1:20:32] caught it the more you fear everybody
[1:20:35] feared you at a little age because you
[1:20:39] had confidence that you can catch that
[1:20:41] ball and you became a very good receiver
[1:20:45] for this little pawy America
[1:20:53] church but it's it's called
[1:20:57] repetitions you get back up and you do
[1:21:00] it again you get back up and you do it

[1:30:37] truth we need each other we need each
[1:30:43] other

[1:30:50] it is about Divine
[1:30:51] Healing God has got the power to heal
[1:30:54] you if you got the courage to accept it
[1:30:59] but you fight every inch of the way God
[1:31:02] has got Amazing Grace to give you and he
[1:31:05] will do it but you have to fight every
[1:31:08] inch of the way I've been be behind the
[1:31:12] pulpit going on 31 years and every inch
[1:31:17] of that was being a fight continually it
[1:31:22] certainly has but if but we must fight
[1:31:27] if we must Reign so we find out that the
[1:31:32] bride has to make herself ready be
[1:31:36] willing to lay aside every weight that
[1:31:39] do easily besit her us that we might run
[1:31:46] this patience and this race that's set
[1:31:49] before us we must lay them aside
[1:31:53] ourselves
[1:31:55] we can't say God you come lay them aside
[1:31:59] for us we've got to do that ourselves
[1:32:03] Revelations 3 and 21 it says to him that
[1:32:07] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:32:10] in my throne even as also overcome and I
[1:32:16] am set down with my father in his throne
[1:32:20] did you hear what he just
[1:32:22] said I grant to sit with me in my
[1:32:28] Throne did you
[1:32:30] know there's going to be a
[1:32:34] day that that Jesus that we love so
[1:32:38] dearly that's on the right hand of God
[1:32:41] is going to have his
[1:32:45] throne and he's going to sit there and
[1:32:48] guess who's going to sit right beside
[1:32:50] her right beside
[1:32:52] him you
[1:32:55] all power of that kingdom is in your
[1:33:01] hands everything that he was he put into
[1:33:05] Christ whatever things in Christ he puts
[1:33:07] into his
[1:33:09] church all
[1:33:12] power all
[1:33:14] inheritance all
[1:33:18] things and we can tap into that
[1:33:21] today by the Holy Ghost
[1:33:24] our Earnest he's placing
[1:33:27] us into that revelation of who you
[1:33:32] are you want to have faith like brother
[1:33:36] durren do what he
[1:33:39] did start
[1:33:41] studying reading crying out to him yes
[1:33:45] dying to
[1:33:49] yourself
[1:33:51] yeah you want
[1:33:54] to be like Christ brother dur for many
[1:33:58] years have been striving to be just like
[1:34:01] Christ and I believe he's there I
[1:34:05] believe he's
[1:34:10] there but Abraham he didn't notice the
[1:34:14] well of water
[1:34:15] land for he left up his eyes and
[1:34:19] saw the tomorrow for he would inherit
[1:34:24] all things the real Christian today
[1:34:28] lifts up his eyes and sees the promises
[1:34:30] of Christ blessed are the meek that they
[1:34:34] shall inherit all things they shall
[1:34:36] inherit the earth the the real Christian
[1:34:40] by faith looks up and sees that call him
[1:34:43] what you want to he lifts up his eyes
[1:34:47] and when he did that God said Abraham
[1:34:50] walk through the land sh all you yours
[1:34:54] she's all yours when we get to a place
[1:34:58] that this is our total
[1:35:01] absolute everything that we breathe
[1:35:04] everything that we talk everything that
[1:35:07] we do you're going to be able to walk
[1:35:11] through every
[1:35:13] Temptation and get Victory because God's
[1:35:17] going to
[1:35:19] say she's all
[1:35:22] yours amen
[1:35:27] let's have faith like
[1:35:29] Abraham Revelations 2 and 17 he that
[1:35:33] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:35:36] saith unto the churches to him that
[1:35:38] overcometh will I give to eat the hidden
[1:35:42] mana and will give him a white stone and
[1:35:46] in that stone a new name written which
[1:35:49] no man knoweth saveth he that receives
[1:35:52] it Hallelujah Hallelujah when I can see
[1:35:57] a preview of it it makes me Rejoice
[1:36:01] seeing that our anchor holds within the
[1:36:04] veil the Bible says he that overcometh
[1:36:07] will I give a white stone and the new
[1:36:11] name that no one knows but
[1:36:14] himself don't make any difference what
[1:36:17] people say you know yourself when you
[1:36:21] been bought and to brought into the
[1:36:26] inner Veil no one could tell you any
[1:36:30] different not because you joined church
[1:36:32] because you did this or that but
[1:36:36] something just tells you that you got a
[1:36:39] stone that's in your heart not a hard
[1:36:43] Stone a soft one the stone makes your
[1:36:47] heart soft instead of hard Ezekiel in
[1:36:50] that old time I'm hurrying church and
[1:36:53] when when the law work put into the
[1:36:56] Tabernacle in the ark of the law of God
[1:37:00] Ezekiel spoke the anchor time or another
[1:37:04] time now the
[1:37:07] people there are two classes of people
[1:37:10] today they seen class that tries to do
[1:37:13] something to save themselves each
[1:37:17] one I'll go to the church on Sunday
[1:37:21] that's very good I want to be religious
[1:37:25] that's very good I stay under the law
[1:37:30] and when that other by going to church
[1:37:33] and being good it's not something that
[1:37:36] you do yourself it's something in you
[1:37:40] doing it for you the Holy Spirit In Your
[1:37:44] Heart the reason why people come early
[1:37:47] is because it's in their heart to do it
[1:37:49] it's something that draws them to it
[1:37:53] listen in church there's something in
[1:37:55] you when you wake up in the morning and
[1:37:57] say w it's Wednesday morning but I'm
[1:38:00] going to church
[1:38:01] tonight because there's something
[1:38:03] calling you to come and hear from God in
[1:38:07] the fivefold
[1:38:09] ministry that's why we should be paring
[1:38:11] ourselves at work on Wednesdays for this
[1:38:14] opportunity if you have a 15minute nap
[1:38:17] get a 15 minute nap right before you
[1:38:19] come to church get ourselves ready to
[1:38:21] hear from God not worry about everybody
[1:38:24] else but worry about you and myself come
[1:38:29] in and get something from God so you can
[1:38:31] fight the devil the next day fight the
[1:38:34] devil until the Rapture comes something
[1:38:36] that will give you an experience to be
[1:38:39] an overcomer for this day so that you
[1:38:42] can inherit all things of Christ Jesus
[1:38:45] that give it to you and me Hallelujah
[1:38:48] why because there's something on the
[1:38:49] inside of you Hallelujah now notice in
[1:38:53] the inner Court the people that live in
[1:38:57] there inside there seems to have always
[1:39:02] Fed Up always feeling good Ezekiel said
[1:39:07] feeling fed up yeah feeling feeling good
[1:39:11] Ezekiel said I will write my laws a new
[1:39:16] and put in the
[1:39:17] heart where the law used to be a stone
[1:39:21] in the ark and the Ark present the heart
[1:39:25] then I will put my new law in their
[1:39:28] hearts in the ark so where is the ark
[1:39:33] today your
[1:39:37] heart it's your
[1:39:39] heart so where are you going to place it
[1:39:42] where are you going to
[1:39:43] place all this great
[1:39:47] stuff where are you going to place it
[1:39:52] here oh you're going to place it right
[1:39:55] here and it's going to manifest Sons and
[1:39:58] Daughters of
[1:39:59] God that's pretty
[1:40:01] easy brother har pretty simple why are
[1:40:06] we
[1:40:06] struggling is because we're not eating
[1:40:08] the
[1:40:10] book The reason why you struggle and I
[1:40:13] struggle is because we're not eating the
[1:40:15] book and believing it oh brother William
[1:40:18] I study every
[1:40:19] day
[1:40:22] good good good then what's the problem
[1:40:26] it's the believing part you can read all
[1:40:29] day
[1:40:30] long ain't goingon to get nothing out of
[1:40:32] it but you pray and you seek God and you
[1:40:34] start reading this because this is life
[1:40:36] or death to you it'll change your
[1:40:41] life it'll change your life it'll make
[1:40:44] us want to do things that we really
[1:40:46] wouldn't do unless it was
[1:40:49] him CU I'm going to tell you something
[1:40:51] it has to be the Holy Ghost for you to
[1:40:52] love me
[1:40:55] because if you really know me you
[1:40:57] wouldn't like
[1:41:01] me that's the truth that is the truth my
[1:41:05] heart is the bond of God and in the Old
[1:41:08] Testament God dwelt In His glory over
[1:41:12] the ark and the heart is the
[1:41:15] ark God dwells not in the head in the
[1:41:19] heart God is not known to theology God
[1:41:23] is not known by mental conception God is
[1:41:27] known by the oldfashioned Sanctified
[1:41:30] Born Again experience that's in the
[1:41:33] human heart yet man and women live a
[1:41:36] good life and love God by mineral
[1:41:39] conception but the real hidden place is
[1:41:43] in the heart hidden in Hidden with
[1:41:46] Christ Christ the Holy Ghost comes into
[1:41:50] that heart he is in you with your your
[1:41:54] Temperance and he is living his own life
[1:41:59] to his own will through you Hallelujah
[1:42:03] I'm almost done Isaiah
[1:42:06] 54 everyone knows these scriptures right
[1:42:08] here Isaiah 54 and14 in the
[1:42:11] righteousness shall thou be established
[1:42:15] thou shal be far from opp Opposite I
[1:42:18] can't say that word for thou shall not
[1:42:21] fear and from tar for it shall not come
[1:42:26] near thee behold they shall surely
[1:42:29] gather together but not by me whosoever
[1:42:34] Shall Gather together against thee shall
[1:42:36] fall for thy sake behold I have created
[1:42:41] the Smith that bows the coals in the
[1:42:44] fire and that brings forth an instrument
[1:42:48] for a for for his work and I have
[1:42:52] created the ways to destroy no weapon
[1:42:57] that is formed against me against thee
[1:43:01] shall prosper every tongue that shall
[1:43:05] rise against thee is judged thou shal
[1:43:10] condemn
[1:43:12] wow I guess we better watch how we say
[1:43:15] things about people
[1:43:17] huh cuz that same person you talking
[1:43:19] about is living a holy ghost life is
[1:43:22] going to condemn
[1:43:24] you
[1:43:27] wow wow wow
[1:43:32] wow I think we just need to sit there
[1:43:34] and think about that for a moment this
[1:43:36] is the inheritage of the servant of the
[1:43:39] Lord and their righteousness is of me
[1:43:42] sayeth the
[1:43:45] Lord now brother R says this he says you
[1:43:48] brother this is God's word which is
[1:43:51] sharper than two-edged sword
[1:43:53] it's the greatest power that was ever
[1:43:56] put in the hands of man and God's
[1:44:00] expecting Abraham's race to put sin
[1:44:03] sickness and all kinds of devils to the
[1:44:06] flight
[1:44:08] wall that's right we've got the most
[1:44:11] powerful weapon that there
[1:44:14] is what is
[1:44:17] it the
[1:44:20] word he says here Aon
[1:44:24] vanwinkle left them with sticks and
[1:44:26] stones but Christ left us with the word
[1:44:30] of the spirit it's fight let's fight
[1:44:34] let's stand for Christ let's stand for
[1:44:36] the word let's pull the sword out of its
[1:44:40] sheath and fight Mark 6 Mark Mark 11 32
[1:44:45] and 34 it says verily I say unto you
[1:44:48] that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:44:50] mountain be thou removed and and be thou
[1:44:53] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:44:56] its heart but shall believe that those
[1:44:59] things which he said shall come to pass
[1:45:03] he shall have whatsoever he said
[1:45:05] therefore I say unto you what things so
[1:45:09] soever ye desire when ye pray believe
[1:45:13] that he receive them and he shall have
[1:45:17] them couple more things and I'm almost
[1:45:19] done now only this journey he's promised
[1:45:23] to supply everything that we have need
[1:45:26] of whatever you ask the father in my
[1:45:31] name that will I do whatsoever things he
[1:45:34] repeats what I just read now he give us
[1:45:38] the strongest weapon that there
[1:45:41] is on the
[1:45:43] world and that's prayer Pray is what
[1:45:47] changes things and Christ does
[1:45:51] recognize what a force he has when he
[1:45:55] kneels and his knees before almighty God
[1:45:59] In The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't
[1:46:02] recognize power that is if wa excuse me
[1:46:07] he doesn't
[1:46:09] recognize what power that is talking to
[1:46:12] us we don't recognize it but if we can
[1:46:16] recognize oh people could only recognize
[1:46:20] that that's what is given right unto
[1:46:24] them anything that you ask Will for will
[1:46:29] be given sorry for being stuttering here
