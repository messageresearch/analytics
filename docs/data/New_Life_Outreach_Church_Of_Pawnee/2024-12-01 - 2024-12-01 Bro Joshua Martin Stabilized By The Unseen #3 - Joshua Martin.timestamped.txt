[47:19] 23 and
[47:21] 1 amen I trust you had a good week a
[47:24] good Thanksgiving I feel a fat and Sassy
[47:27] this morning I know I know I did I
[47:29] probably gained 10 lbs just on ham and
[47:33] and apple pies and stuff but uh I know
[47:35] it's a wonderful season to to be
[47:37] thankful for that God has not only do we
[47:40] have a a freedom of worship here but God
[47:42] has given us something to to worship
[47:44] with you I believe we've got the
[47:46] greatest message upon the Earth that has
[47:47] showed us how to worship not just in in
[47:49] Emotion not just in a sensation but in
[47:51] spirit and in truth amen amen job 23
[47:55] And1
[47:57] the Bible would say then job answered
[47:59] and said even today is my complaint
[48:02] bitter my stroke is heavier than my
[48:04] groaning oh that I knew where I might
[48:06] find him that I might come even to his
[48:09] seat I would order my calls before him
[48:11] and fill my mouth with arguments I would
[48:13] know the words which he would answer me
[48:15] and understand what he would say unto me
[48:18] will he plead against me with his great
[48:20] power no but he would put strength in me
[48:23] there the righteous might dispute with
[48:25] him so should I be delivered from from
[48:28] Forever from my judge behold I go
[48:30] forward but he is not there backward but
[48:33] I cannot perceive him on the left where
[48:35] he where he doth work but I cannot
[48:37] Behold Him He hideth himself on the
[48:39] right hand that I cannot see him but he
[48:42] knoweth the way that I take and when he
[48:44] tried me I shall come forth as gold my
[48:48] foot hath held his steps which he has
[48:51] which his way have I kept and and
[48:53] declined and not declined neither have I
[48:56] gone back from the Commandments of his
[48:58] lips I have esteemed the words of his
[49:00] mouth more than my necessary food but he
[49:03] is in one mind who can turn him and what
[49:06] his soul desireth even that he doeth for
[49:09] he performeth the thing that is
[49:11] appointed for me and many such things
[49:13] are with Him amen can we bow our heads
[49:16] this this morning dear gracious Heavenly
[49:18] Father Lord what an honor it is to come
[49:21] into your house one more time lord as we
[49:23] feel your presence Among Us God lord we
[49:25] ask as we come coming to this part of
[49:27] the service that you would just speak
[49:28] today Lord you know the hearts Lord the
[49:31] desires the needs that are in the
[49:32] building today Father Lord I ask as the
[49:35] word would come forth Lord may it may it
[49:37] strengthen Lord may it edify the the
[49:40] hearts of your your people that is here
[49:41] today Lord if there's some that is
[49:43] discouraged father we ask that you would
[49:45] uplift them today Lord we we lay their
[49:47] service into your hands father in your
[49:49] precious name amen you may be seated
[49:52] this morning and I just have a simple
[49:54] subject um last time I preached I I was
[49:57] preached on stabilized by the Unseen and
[49:59] I might just continue on that but I know
[50:01] this is a a familiar passage of
[50:03] scripture and it's been preached on a
[50:05] lot and I I just want to read this quote
[50:07] here and and I've read it before but
[50:09] brother Brandon would say that's what we
[50:11] do you must find the will of God before
[50:13] you can do the will of God you must know
[50:15] what the will is and the matter and then
[50:17] don't turn it loose as the lady said
[50:20] today when she was trying to get beyond
[50:21] the sound barrier the plane just picks
[50:23] up a speed and goes at an unlimited when
[50:26] it passes the sound barrier and when you
[50:28] can pray until you pass the doubt
[50:30] barrier then you're running free and you
[50:33] can go on and then you're nothing can
[50:35] bother you then because you're running
[50:37] free you're past the unbelief it's done
[50:39] been settled it's all over when you get
[50:42] the Assurance in your heart that is
[50:43] going to be that way you're just as
[50:46] happy as if it has already happened so I
[50:49] believe you must find the will of God
[50:50] before you can do the will of God then
[50:52] brother Brandon would tell us then you
[50:54] don't turn it loose and and we would see
[50:56] that Jesus would be a perfect example of
[50:58] this as he would say I would do nothing
[51:00] till my till I see my father do it I
[51:03] seek not my own will but but the will of
[51:05] my father and you can just imagine how
[51:07] much Faith Jesus would have to have in
[51:10] the will of the father as he would be in
[51:12] the Garden of Gethsemane and would say
[51:13] not my will but thy will be done he knew
[51:17] what he was going to have to go through
[51:19] to perform the will of God but yet there
[51:21] was so much faith that he would say not
[51:23] my even though I have to be beaten I
[51:25] have to be scored I have my beard has to
[51:27] be plucked out there's one thing on my
[51:30] mind that is the will of God and this
[51:32] ain't an easy life this ain't an easy
[51:34] Journey we go through hardships we go
[51:36] through trials Temptations mind battles
[51:38] but we got one thing on our mind that is
[51:41] the will of God and I and I will love I
[51:43] would love job's confession my foot have
[51:46] held his steps his way have I kept and
[51:49] not declined neither have I gone back
[51:51] from the Commandments of his lips I have
[51:54] esteemed the words of his mouth more
[51:56] than my necessary food job knew what he
[51:59] was doing was the will of the Lord he
[52:01] knew that no matter what the naysayers
[52:03] were saying what the what the the trials
[52:05] he was going through he knew that he was
[52:07] in the will of God and I believe that's
[52:09] something we all have to find in all of
[52:11] our life is what is the will of God for
[52:13] my life cuz once you find the will of
[52:16] God then it's something that stabilizes
[52:17] you you know cuz you know many time
[52:19] brother Brandon would tell us that that
[52:21] uh uh clouds that are over over your
[52:24] head is not a a sign of God's dis
[52:26] approval neither are sunny days signs of
[52:29] his approval but he says we we the sign
[52:31] of his approval is in his love that he
[52:33] shed for us you know and so when we go
[52:35] through hard times we got to know that
[52:37] we are in the will of God and brother
[52:40] Brandon would say so many times we get
[52:41] to a place where we can't stand still
[52:43] and nervous just as we sure to start to
[52:46] do something good then we see trouble
[52:48] coming but that is the devil trying to
[52:51] upset the program of God we find in our
[52:54] individual lives and we find in the
[52:56] church world we find in our national
[52:58] Affairs you find it everywhere then we
[53:00] can know that we are getting ready to do
[53:03] right wrong is always present but the
[53:05] way to overcome that is to think in your
[53:08] heart which which way would God would
[53:10] have you to go and which way is the best
[53:13] way then stay with that way so as soon
[53:16] as you start to do something good the
[53:18] Bible would say evil is always present
[53:21] and so what the devil is trying to do is
[53:23] when you find a direction for your life
[53:25] he tries to come with hardships and get
[53:28] you to second guess the will that God
[53:30] has revealed to you he tries to make you
[53:32] nervous and and you know here in job is
[53:34] saying I have not done nothing wrong my
[53:37] my foots my my my feet is is walking in
[53:40] your way my I have kept your words upon
[53:42] my lips more than my necessary food I
[53:45] know where I am at it's not judgment I
[53:48] don't know why I'm going through it but
[53:50] I am in the will of God and you see when
[53:52] emotions come and and try to lead you
[53:55] away from the will of God God for your
[53:57] life you got to make sure you're
[53:59] stabilized because if you don't know
[54:01] you're in the will of God when hardships
[54:03] comes well did I do something wrong or
[54:05] you know uh did I make the wrong
[54:07] decision and we would see brother
[54:09] Brandon would give us the secret to
[54:11] overcome this find in your heart the way
[54:14] God wants you to go and stay with it and
[54:17] I believe if we would find the way that
[54:20] God would want for us there would be
[54:22] more people stable you know you you
[54:24] wouldn't be mad of this one mad at that
[54:26] one we might not understand why we go
[54:28] through it but we know this is where God
[54:30] has put us and if God has put us here
[54:33] that is where the blessings of God are
[54:35] going to fall you remember brother
[54:37] Brandon would tell the story of the
[54:38] missionary that felt to go overseas and
[54:41] take his family with him and the council
[54:43] would tell him that there's diseases
[54:45] over there there's plagues over there
[54:46] you're crazy for taking your family
[54:48] there and he would say well I'm safer
[54:50] there in the will of God than here and
[54:53] out of the will of God so it might not
[54:55] make sense to the world but if you found
[54:58] the will of God press toward the mark no
[55:00] matter what comes against you no matter
[55:02] the oppositions if you found that the
[55:04] Rapture is the will of God for you press
[55:06] for it it don't matter if unbelief comes
[55:09] and doubt comes and Skeptics come stick
[55:11] with the will of God that God has show
[55:14] to you and job was constantly pointing
[55:16] to the will of God he knoweth the way
[55:19] that I take and when he has tried me I
[55:21] shall come forth as gold and I love that
[55:24] because he was still looking to the end
[55:27] product you know he he wasn't looking at
[55:29] at the as sheep he was on because he
[55:31] would say when he when he had tried me
[55:33] and brother Brandon would say the word
[55:35] tempt is to be is to be tried and so
[55:37] while job was being tempted God was
[55:40] trying him so that he could come forth
[55:42] as gold and here job was looking at that
[55:45] in product even though the the the the
[55:48] the things he was going through was
[55:50] hurting him he was still looking that
[55:52] I'm going to come forth as gold and oh
[55:55] my that's what we we got to keep in our
[55:57] sight is the finished product that
[55:59] everything that I go through is molding
[56:02] me and shaping me to come forth in the
[56:05] image that God had for before the
[56:07] foundation of the world job would saying
[56:10] in job 23 and14 he Perth the thing that
[56:13] is appointed for me and many such things
[56:16] are with him he performeth the things
[56:19] that is appointed unto me job knew he
[56:21] wasn't here by accident he knew that he
[56:24] wasn't on the ash Heap by acci acent he
[56:26] knew that his children wasn't taken away
[56:29] by accident but he was walking in an
[56:31] appointed time that God was leading him
[56:34] through and he would have an assurance
[56:36] that he
[56:38] performthe and and we look up the story
[56:40] of job and many times we think that it's
[56:43] the devil coming and causing chaos but
[56:46] God would allow it God would appoint it
[56:48] and and allow the devil would to come
[56:50] and bring him through these hard times
[56:53] and even though job didn't understand he
[56:55] knew that he has appointed me to go
[56:58] through this and if he has appointed me
[57:01] to go through this I know he's going to
[57:03] lead me through the other side of it and
[57:06] if God has appointed you to go through
[57:09] hardships don't give up in the trial God
[57:12] is going to be faithful to lead you
[57:14] through it he
[57:21] performthe knew that he was just even
[57:24] though that that his friend were calling
[57:26] him a sinner brother the brandom says he
[57:29] knew that he was just and he was just
[57:31] waiting for inspiration to strike so
[57:34] there he stood even though he could not
[57:36] fear or feel that God was near he knew
[57:39] by him doing the will of God by Burnt
[57:41] offerings that will made him perfect and
[57:45] so it didn't matter the accusations that
[57:47] were coming against him the will of God
[57:50] was greater than the accusations and let
[57:52] me say this the will of God that you
[57:54] find for your life is greater than every
[57:57] accusation that comes against you it's
[57:59] greater than every every doubt and
[58:01] skeptic that comes that comes against
[58:03] your mind you know this is the will of
[58:05] God and in this will is perfection and
[58:08] we will see that there there there's a
[58:10] blessing with staying with the will of
[58:12] God Hebrews 10 and 36 for ye have need
[58:15] of patience that after you have done the
[58:18] will of God you might receive the
[58:21] promise and so after you stick with the
[58:23] will of God there's a blessing with it
[58:26] and I believe we don't want to just you
[58:27] know pray and feel like God is leading
[58:30] us this way but then it gets hard we're
[58:31] going to turn around and go this way
[58:33] when that gets hard we're going to turn
[58:35] around and go that way what what is the
[58:37] will of God who's speaking to you then
[58:39] who's leading to you then but if you
[58:41] truly found the will of God there is a
[58:43] promise for you on the other side of it
[58:47] and I don't believe that we we sometimes
[58:49] we get stagnated sometimes we get we go
[58:51] through dark times but I don't believe
[58:53] that is the end of the will in your life
[58:56] even when you don't feel him God still
[58:58] has a promise for you and an inheritance
[59:01] for you if you can just stick with where
[59:03] God has placed you oh Hallelujah and we
[59:06] would see that the Bible would tell us
[59:07] in 1 Thessalonians 3 and 2 and S Timothy
[59:11] and our brother and minister of God and
[59:13] our fellow laborer in the gospel of
[59:16] Christ to establish you and to comfort
[59:19] you concerning your faith that no man
[59:22] should be moved by these afflictions for
[59:24] yourself know that we appointed there
[59:27] unto so here come a minister to to to
[59:30] strengthen and establish you that when
[59:33] you do go through afflictions you're not
[59:35] moved by him the Apostle Paul would say
[59:38] none of these things moved me he was
[59:40] established in the will of God but the
[59:42] Brandon would say that the Apostle Paul
[59:45] was harnessed to the will of God and so
[59:47] he would also the Apostle Paul would say
[59:49] I was not disobedient to the heavenly
[59:52] vision he could not be disobedient to it
[59:54] cuz he was tied to it so whenever you're
[59:57] tied to the will of God all you can do
[59:59] is follow what God has for your life Oh
[1:00:03] my he would say none of these things
[1:00:04] move me so when you're tied to something
[1:00:07] you can only go the direction what is
[1:00:09] leading you and you remember whenever
[1:00:11] the donkey was tied and had to be loose
[1:00:14] Jesus would tell the disciples go to a
[1:00:16] certain place and you're going to find a
[1:00:18] donkey right and he's going to be tied
[1:00:19] and he would say loose him and let him
[1:00:21] go so before he could fulfill the
[1:00:24] purpose of Jesus he had to be untied to
[1:00:28] where he was you see and if we're tied
[1:00:30] to the will of the Father the devil can
[1:00:32] come and try to get you to fulfill his
[1:00:35] purpose but if you're tied already and
[1:00:37] harnessed to the will of God there's
[1:00:40] nothing the devil can do he can come
[1:00:42] against your mind come against your
[1:00:43] spirit come against your body but if
[1:00:45] that Soul Is Anchored to the will of God
[1:00:49] you cannot be led any other direction
[1:00:51] but what you're tied to oh Hallelujah
[1:00:54] the Apostle Paul would say shall
[1:00:56] separate us from the love of God if
[1:00:58] we're tied to it nothing can separate us
[1:01:01] oh he would say you know sh tribulation
[1:01:04] distress persecution famine nakedness
[1:01:06] Pearl or sword for thy sake we are
[1:01:09] killed all the day long we are counted
[1:01:11] as sheep for the slaughter but nay in
[1:01:14] all of these things we are more than
[1:01:16] conquerors through him that loved us so
[1:01:19] he was pointing back the overcoming
[1:01:22] strength that he would have to go
[1:01:24] through these things was the very thing
[1:01:27] that he could not be separated from he
[1:01:29] would say none of these things shall
[1:01:31] separate us from the love of Christ then
[1:01:33] he would say we we are more than
[1:01:35] conquerors through him that loved us so
[1:01:38] he was anchored and harnessed to the
[1:01:40] very strength that was going to bring
[1:01:43] him through the famine the Pearl The
[1:01:45] Sword whatever he would go through he
[1:01:48] had something he could point to that was
[1:01:51] going to strengthen him to go through it
[1:01:53] and that's why we got to find the will
[1:01:55] of God
[1:01:56] because we're going to face Hard Times
[1:01:58] we're going to go through Temptations
[1:02:00] we're going to go through through tough
[1:02:01] circumstances but if you find the will
[1:02:04] of God nothing can separate me from the
[1:02:06] will of God and it's that will that that
[1:02:09] that is giving us the strength to go
[1:02:11] through the hard times oh Hallelujah you
[1:02:14] see who shall separate us from the love
[1:02:17] of God and you know brother the Brandon
[1:02:19] would say the great miracle of Noah's
[1:02:21] day was Noah being tucked away in the
[1:02:23] ark he says when the rainfall the great
[1:02:26] miracle was Noah resting in the ark and
[1:02:29] you see that is something that that is
[1:02:31] hard to do sometimes is rest you know
[1:02:33] you got to rest in the will of God and
[1:02:35] brother Brandon would tell us the
[1:02:37] Christian experience is based solemnly
[1:02:40] holy upon rest come unto me all ye that
[1:02:43] labor and heavy laden and I'll give you
[1:02:45] rest we're tossed about with everything
[1:02:48] until until you come to Christ then it
[1:02:51] is all finished resting in Christ
[1:02:53] perfectly no matter what comes or ghost
[1:02:56] nothing can touch us without without it
[1:02:59] coming over the shepherd He has to
[1:03:01] permit it ain't that powerful he says
[1:03:04] you're tossed to you're tossed round
[1:03:06] about until you come to Christ then you
[1:03:09] are resting and what is so incredible
[1:03:11] was when when brother Brandon would go
[1:03:14] beyond the curtain of time he would ask
[1:03:16] them you know is Paul going to be judged
[1:03:19] by the message that he preached and they
[1:03:21] say yeah he's going to be judged and
[1:03:22] brother brandom says good because I only
[1:03:25] preached what he preached and what would
[1:03:27] the multitude say we're resting upon
[1:03:30] that they found though that that this
[1:03:32] message was the will of God and they
[1:03:35] found a stability they found a rest even
[1:03:39] though they were on the other side they
[1:03:41] were still resting in the stability that
[1:03:44] God gave this generation and you might
[1:03:47] go through the valley of the shadow of
[1:03:49] death but there is a perseverance
[1:03:51] there's a rest inside of this message
[1:03:54] that you might not understand while
[1:03:56] you're going through it but you found
[1:03:58] the will of God and there's a
[1:04:00] perseverance to go through it oh
[1:04:03] hallelujah we're not tossed tossed about
[1:04:06] anymore we're stabilized in Jesus Christ
[1:04:09] oh Hallelujah and you know this ain't
[1:04:11] the time to tuck tail and run you know
[1:04:13] that the only reason the devil tries to
[1:04:15] disrupt something is because you've got
[1:04:17] something worth worth disrupting you
[1:04:20] know you've never seen we've used it
[1:04:22] before you've never seen a 45 counter
[1:04:24] counterfeit dollar be cuz there's not a
[1:04:26] genuine out there it only attacks the
[1:04:29] ones that is genuine and the only reason
[1:04:32] the Devil comes with doubt and against
[1:04:34] this message is because he knows it is
[1:04:37] the power under salvation the Apostle
[1:04:40] Paul would say I am not ashamed of this
[1:04:42] gospel for it is the power of God and I
[1:04:45] believe this message has made us not
[1:04:47] ashamed because this is the power of God
[1:04:50] under salvation and brother brownon
[1:04:52] going talk about Jehoshaphat and the
[1:04:54] nation of Jud
[1:04:56] he would say Jehoshaphat was a righteous
[1:04:58] man and he says he was trying to do the
[1:05:01] best that he knew to do to serve the
[1:05:03] Lord and he says he was doing his best
[1:05:06] then all of a sudden now the moabites
[1:05:08] were coming to attack and he says then
[1:05:10] all of the people would start to get
[1:05:12] frustrated he says they started to get
[1:05:14] worried they they started to get get to
[1:05:16] become afraid and brother brandham says
[1:05:18] the Lord would speak by inspiration and
[1:05:21] would say stand still and see the
[1:05:23] salvation of the Lord and I think it's
[1:05:25] so incredible cuz brother brandom says
[1:05:28] as long as they were praying it was
[1:05:30] God's battle as long as they were
[1:05:32] together and praying here was God's
[1:05:34] battle so whenever When Trials comes
[1:05:36] against the church that ain't time to
[1:05:38] get divided that ain't time that to
[1:05:40] choose signs choose favorites or this
[1:05:42] did this that one did that this one done
[1:05:44] that it's the time to come together and
[1:05:46] let God fight the battle you see it's
[1:05:49] easy to get frustrated when when this
[1:05:51] here happens and and troubles happens in
[1:05:53] the church then we just want to you know
[1:05:55] p to oursel but brother brandom says as
[1:05:57] long as they were together God fought
[1:06:00] the Battle the disciples got together in
[1:06:02] the upper room and won Accord then God
[1:06:04] fa so you want to see the blessings of
[1:06:06] God come together as a family come
[1:06:09] together as a church come together as a
[1:06:11] unity and strive for one goal that is
[1:06:14] the will of God but you see here when
[1:06:17] whenever the the the moabites was coming
[1:06:20] against Judah it was troubles trying to
[1:06:22] break up the will of God for that Nation
[1:06:25] and inspiration would tell Jehoshaphat
[1:06:28] stand still and we would see that
[1:06:30] whenever Peter would walk out upon the
[1:06:32] Water what would Peter say if it is you
[1:06:35] bid me to come and that really spoke to
[1:06:37] me because Peter knew if he was walking
[1:06:40] in his own ability he had to pull
[1:06:42] himself up if he fell down right but he
[1:06:45] knew if Jesus told him and bid him to
[1:06:48] walk on the water it was Jesus
[1:06:51] responsibility to pull him up if he
[1:06:53] started to sink and you see once find
[1:06:55] the will of God you're not walking in
[1:06:57] your own ability you're not walking by
[1:07:00] by your own emotions you're not walking
[1:07:02] by what you want to do and if you was
[1:07:04] you know that I'm walking by my own by
[1:07:06] my own shoes but if I'm walking on the
[1:07:08] will of God my footsteps are ordered by
[1:07:11] the Lord and here would come Peter and
[1:07:14] and I know we spoke on this last time
[1:07:16] but brother brandom says Peter was
[1:07:17] walking on substance and not water so he
[1:07:20] was walking on the will of God and
[1:07:23] brother Brandon would say that his
[1:07:25] substance would have led him straight to
[1:07:27] Jesus until he looked at the waves and
[1:07:30] got
[1:07:31] afraid you see ain't that incredible his
[1:07:34] substance would have kept him all the
[1:07:36] way to the feet of Jesus until he got
[1:07:39] afraid and that's exactly what the devil
[1:07:41] does is he wants you to get afraid with
[1:07:44] the first situation that comes against
[1:07:46] you in the will of God maybe I'm not in
[1:07:48] the will of God but brother brandom says
[1:07:50] as soon as he got afraid his substance
[1:07:53] was taken away from him and he says he
[1:07:56] still professed his faith but he had no
[1:07:58] substance you see the devil wants you to
[1:08:01] serve God out of fear you see there's a
[1:08:03] difference between Godly fear and
[1:08:06] Satan's fear you see the devil likes to
[1:08:08] come and whisper in your ear that you
[1:08:10] got to be afraid of God how many's ever
[1:08:12] ever heard the Devil tell you that
[1:08:13] before that you got to be afraid of
[1:08:15] you're you're you're afraid to make a
[1:08:16] mistakes you're you're afraid to do this
[1:08:18] wrong that God's not going to love you
[1:08:19] anymore if you if you make a mistake
[1:08:21] God's going to take his grace away from
[1:08:23] you or if you do this you you sin day of
[1:08:25] Grace away it is fear trying to take
[1:08:28] away the will of God that God has given
[1:08:31] you and brother Brandon would tell us he
[1:08:33] would say the fear of God is not being
[1:08:37] afraid of him but that means you respect
[1:08:39] him you reverence him and so there's a
[1:08:42] difference between fearing God out out
[1:08:44] out of being afraid and reverencing him
[1:08:47] you see whenever Peter was upon the
[1:08:49] Water he wasn't reverencing the water he
[1:08:52] was a he was afraid of the water and so
[1:08:54] that caused him to lose lose his
[1:08:56] substance and what happens when you lose
[1:08:58] your substance you've got no strength to
[1:09:01] battle the devil with right if you're
[1:09:03] afraid of somebody you've got no
[1:09:05] strength to to to whip on somebody you
[1:09:07] know if me and Caleb got into a fight
[1:09:09] and I was say and I was afraid of him
[1:09:11] and I didn't think I could whip him I'm
[1:09:13] going to Honker down to him right I'm
[1:09:15] going to let him run me over I'm going
[1:09:17] to let him dictate what I think what I
[1:09:19] say you know and if the devil can ever
[1:09:21] get you to serve God out of fear you
[1:09:24] lose your substance which is the very
[1:09:26] thing you overcome the devil with right
[1:09:29] so whenever you lose your substance
[1:09:31] you've got no strength whenever spirits
[1:09:33] come against your home when spirits come
[1:09:36] against your mind when spirits come
[1:09:37] against your family there's no strength
[1:09:40] to combat those spirits and so you just
[1:09:42] Honker down you back up you back up but
[1:09:45] there's got to come a time that we cast
[1:09:47] out fear and bring in the strength of
[1:09:50] the Lord and say there's no Spirits
[1:09:52] they're going to plag my home no Spirits
[1:09:54] you remember the Brandon would tell the
[1:09:56] story about the about the man that would
[1:09:58] have the dream and in this dream there
[1:10:00] was a was a devil that would come up and
[1:10:01] say Boo yall remember that he would back
[1:10:03] down and he would get smaller and the
[1:10:06] devil would get bigger he would say boo
[1:10:08] he would get and every time he honered
[1:10:10] down to that enemy he would get smaller
[1:10:14] and the devil would get bigger you see
[1:10:16] this ain't the time to play with Spirits
[1:10:18] this ain't the time to Honker down to
[1:10:21] every emotion Honker down to every heart
[1:10:23] feeling Honker down to every bitterness
[1:10:26] that comes against you what how would
[1:10:28] the story go but the brandom says he's
[1:10:30] seen a Bible I believe and would grab
[1:10:32] that Bible and would say boo and he
[1:10:34] would get bigger and the devil would get
[1:10:37] smaller this is the time to pick up the
[1:10:40] will of God for this generation and said
[1:10:42] don't matter what comes against my
[1:10:45] family I am not hunkering down to any
[1:10:47] Spirit I'm not hunkering down to
[1:10:50] anything that comes against me it's time
[1:10:53] to get some crit about us and say no
[1:10:55] devil you're not coming into my home
[1:10:57] you're not coming into my mind but
[1:10:59] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:11:03] is in the world we have found the will
[1:11:05] of God and in the will of God is the
[1:11:08] strength oh Hallelujah it is stabilized
[1:11:11] us oh Hallelujah and you see brother
[1:11:14] Brandon would say this the greatest
[1:11:15] thing that I find against the church
[1:11:17] tonight is fear he says everybody is
[1:11:20] scared to death about something what are
[1:11:22] you scared about if a man's born again
[1:11:24] he should be happy Carefree just like
[1:11:27] these fellas uh singing up here and the
[1:11:29] brother testifying that that he's just
[1:11:31] free there's nothing can harm you
[1:11:34] nothing present nothing future nothing
[1:11:36] can separate us from the love of God
[1:11:39] that is in Christ God has promised it oh
[1:11:43] so we're not worshiping God out of fear
[1:11:46] because fear is going to take away your
[1:11:48] substance brother Brandon you know he he
[1:11:50] would say this here and he would say in
[1:11:52] the church and the church and you
[1:11:54] sitting here tonight oh you're
[1:11:56] struggling and struggling and God's
[1:11:58] pulling to you and showing you things if
[1:12:00] you can ever get past the sin barrier of
[1:12:03] unbelief the unlimited Revival will
[1:12:05] break forth through the United States
[1:12:08] and everywhere if you can get beyond the
[1:12:10] sound barrier that sin barrier of
[1:12:12] unbelief oh is it true does it mean me
[1:12:16] could I be healed could I be saved could
[1:12:18] I be filled with the Holy Ghost he says
[1:12:21] get beyond that you see that's what fear
[1:12:23] does is it makes this message
[1:12:42] unpersonalized to dictate you and pull
[1:12:45] you away from the will of God but
[1:12:47] brother brandom says if you can get
[1:12:49] beyond that you've got an unlimited
[1:12:52] Revival oh Hallelujah we don't come to
[1:12:55] the the house of God out of fear that
[1:12:57] we're going to miss the Rapture that
[1:12:58] that I'm not going to be saved we come
[1:13:00] to we come to church because we know
[1:13:03] this is where the blessings of God are
[1:13:05] falling and where're two or three are
[1:13:08] gathered in my name I will be in the
[1:13:10] midst we don't come here out of fear we
[1:13:12] come here because there's an limited
[1:13:15] Revival that God has given us in this
[1:13:18] generation it's not going through
[1:13:19] America it's coming to the bride it's a
[1:13:22] bride's Revival a word Revival that has
[1:13:25] brought the bride out of a
[1:13:26] denominational Slumber and has given her
[1:13:29] a strength to persevere
[1:13:32] with oh Hallelujah and he continues on
[1:13:35] to say if you break through and the Holy
[1:13:38] Ghost comes upon you I'm telling you
[1:13:40] you're beyond to B then this 50 miles of
[1:13:43] Elbow Room oh I say come on up a little
[1:13:46] higher get past the fear get past the
[1:13:48] unbelief get past the emotions and
[1:13:51] complexes and worship God not out of
[1:13:54] fear but out of Faith oh Hallelujah cuz
[1:13:58] if you're listening to messages I hope
[1:14:00] I'm not just beating a dead horse this
[1:14:01] morning but if you're listening to
[1:14:03] messages because you have to you're
[1:14:04] never going to find the will of God but
[1:14:07] if you're listening to messages and
[1:14:08] praying out of Faith then God can reveal
[1:14:12] himself oh Hallelujah brother Brandon
[1:14:16] was say that's the trouble with men
[1:14:17] tonight that's the trouble with the
[1:14:19] people tonight he says that's the
[1:14:21] biggest curse there is on a Full Gospel
[1:14:23] people or any other people people is
[1:14:25] because they are afraid God has made the
[1:14:28] provision but you're afraid to take his
[1:14:31] word for it oh my the biggest curse and
[1:14:34] he says upon the four gospel people and
[1:14:37] any other people is there afraid to
[1:14:39] accept God's provision and I say that
[1:14:42] can come upon message people that God
[1:14:44] has provided his will in this generation
[1:14:47] but we're afraid to act upon it you see
[1:14:50] but I believe that we can walk in a
[1:14:52] Godly fear with rest the Bible would
[1:14:55] tell us in Acts 9:31 then have the
[1:14:57] churches rest throughout all Judea
[1:15:00] Galilee and Samaria and were edified
[1:15:03] walking in the fear of the Lord and so
[1:15:06] there is a rest whenever you're not
[1:15:08] walking out of the devil's fear but out
[1:15:10] of the fear of the Lord which is
[1:15:12] reverence then there's a rest in the
[1:15:14] will of God that you can know that no
[1:15:17] matter what I go through we are in the
[1:15:19] will of God because you see what the
[1:15:22] Brandon would tell us the perfect faith
[1:15:24] and order to have perfect Faith you have
[1:15:27] to know who you are and you you can't
[1:15:29] have condemnation you remember you
[1:15:31] remember the brand I'm telling that and
[1:15:32] perfect Faith he says Jesus knew who he
[1:15:34] was and he says he had no condemnation
[1:15:37] and you would see one of the first two
[1:15:39] things that the devil always throws at
[1:15:41] you when you go through hard times
[1:15:43] condemnation you done something wrong
[1:15:45] you made the wrong choice you made the
[1:15:47] wrong decision and then he comes to
[1:15:49] doubt who you are and what your purpose
[1:15:51] is and so in order to have the perfect
[1:15:54] faith you got to get Beyond those two
[1:15:57] things and we would see brother brandom
[1:15:59] would say this but as long as you're
[1:16:01] doing things that are wrong you can't
[1:16:03] have confidence towards God so you see
[1:16:05] you automatically know that you're wrong
[1:16:07] you automatically put yourself back
[1:16:09] there a sinner by knowing that you're
[1:16:11] wrong but when your heart don't condemn
[1:16:13] you and you know you're a Believer then
[1:16:16] there's nothing between you and God you
[1:16:19] ask what you will and it will be given
[1:16:21] because it is the word that's given to
[1:16:23] you just like those disciples so if you
[1:16:26] know there's nothing against you and you
[1:16:29] know who you are then you can ask what
[1:16:31] you will and God would give it to you
[1:16:34] ain't that an incredible thing that God
[1:16:36] has given us such an authority in this
[1:16:39] generation excuse me and brother Brandon
[1:16:41] would tell us that job was a man of
[1:16:44] inspiration and everybody would come to
[1:16:46] job and ask the ask what the Lord has
[1:16:49] for them and this is really really spoke
[1:16:51] to me here cuz here he was brother
[1:16:53] brandom says everybody respect to job
[1:16:55] everybody looked up to job anytime they
[1:16:57] needed to hear from God they came to job
[1:17:00] and here brother the brandom says when
[1:17:01] he got on his as sheep he had no
[1:17:04] inspiration ain't that incredible
[1:17:06] brother brandom says the Vindication
[1:17:08] that job was a servant of God was his
[1:17:11] inspiration could you imagine the Mind
[1:17:13] battles that job was having the very
[1:17:16] channel that God worked through him was
[1:17:19] dried up now and brother brandom says
[1:17:22] and he says all of those friends that
[1:17:24] would come come to him for inspiration
[1:17:26] now all left him and here brother
[1:17:28] Brandon would say this and man this
[1:17:30] really struck me he would say he wanted
[1:17:32] talking about job he wanted to see if
[1:17:35] there was somebody who could intercede
[1:17:37] for him he had interceded for so many
[1:17:40] people but now was there somebody that
[1:17:43] could speak for him could there be
[1:17:45] somebody put his hand on job a sinful
[1:17:48] man and a holy God and make a bridge the
[1:17:51] way could he go to his house and knock
[1:17:54] out the door when he opened the door and
[1:17:56] talked to him a while ain't that
[1:17:58] incredible he interceded for everybody
[1:18:01] else but now he needed somebody to talk
[1:18:04] to and man that really spoke to me as a
[1:18:06] father as a preacher as a pastor as a
[1:18:09] mother you fixed your mothers get up you
[1:18:12] fix breakfast for the children you make
[1:18:14] sure the house is clean you're serving
[1:18:16] everybody you're interceding everybody
[1:18:19] but what about you you know P daddies
[1:18:22] they go to work that they provide for
[1:18:24] their LED they provide they make sure
[1:18:26] there's food on the table they make sure
[1:18:28] that there's gas in the car but what
[1:18:30] about you who can intercede for you when
[1:18:33] you're interceding for everybody else
[1:18:36] preachers go through it when you get
[1:18:37] under the anointing you're preaching
[1:18:39] you're preaching making wa for liberty
[1:18:41] for other individuals but what about you
[1:18:44] and here stood Job saying what about me
[1:18:48] and not this hard time the Bible says
[1:18:50] he's asking questions if a man die shall
[1:18:53] he live again you know if I could only
[1:18:56] find him I would talk to him and you
[1:18:58] would know that this was bothering job
[1:19:01] because the very Channel God was working
[1:19:03] through he wasn't working through
[1:19:05] anymore but the brandom was said he had
[1:19:07] access to God's grace and here he was
[1:19:10] and when that channel closes you feel
[1:19:12] useless how many's ever been there when
[1:19:14] God is working through working through
[1:19:16] you as I feel that as a preacher and all
[1:19:18] of us H and the anointing dries up you
[1:19:20] go to study and you don't feel him no
[1:19:22] more you get up and preach you don't
[1:19:24] feel no anointing you feel like man what
[1:19:26] did I do wrong you am I out of the will
[1:19:28] of God man I'm telling you what me and
[1:19:31] my wife's been going through a late Li
[1:19:33] orot water heater went out or furnace
[1:19:35] went out but my truck broke down all of
[1:19:38] these things happened in two weeks and
[1:19:40] here my wife is hting what did we do
[1:19:42] wrong and so these things have really
[1:19:44] been speaking to me that it's not that
[1:19:47] we're out of the will of God it's the
[1:19:49] devil coming and trying to put fear that
[1:19:51] we chose the wrong direction but that is
[1:19:54] a Lie from the pits of hell if you found
[1:19:57] the will of God keep pressing if you
[1:20:00] found the will of God don't give up
[1:20:02] don't lay down don't turn around but
[1:20:04] keep on marching if you found the will
[1:20:07] of God for your family March hard if you
[1:20:10] found the will of God for your marriage
[1:20:11] march on if you found that the will of
[1:20:14] God is a Revival for your family march
[1:20:17] on to it keep pressing for it don't give
[1:20:21] up because of
[1:20:22] fear Hallelujah
[1:20:25] and what is so incredible is through all
[1:20:27] of this for job James would say look at
[1:20:30] the patience of Job through all of this
[1:20:33] and here job and I'm sure job could if
[1:20:36] he was alive then or could look from the
[1:20:38] banisters of heaven and would say
[1:20:40] patience what do you mean I was looking
[1:20:42] for God saying God why have you left me
[1:20:45] and you see the word patience in the
[1:20:47] Greek Lexicon is steadfast enduring
[1:20:51] perseverance so joob may may may may
[1:20:53] have may have felt like he God wasn't
[1:20:56] answering but he was still steadfast
[1:20:59] even though he could not feel God and
[1:21:01] you see that's something that we can
[1:21:03] grab a hold of even when we don't feel
[1:21:05] God we can still be steadfast we can
[1:21:08] still be enduring we can still have
[1:21:11] perseverance you see it's patience the
[1:21:14] Bible would tell us in Hebrews 6:12 that
[1:21:16] ye be not slothful but followers of them
[1:21:19] who through faith and patience inherit
[1:21:22] the promises so faith and ations work
[1:21:25] hand in hand to achieve the promises
[1:21:28] that God has for us brother Brandon
[1:21:30] would tell us that the only way for your
[1:21:33] souls to get life is for patience you
[1:21:36] know no it's endurance perseverance
[1:21:39] steadfastness not a double-minded man
[1:21:42] that is here one day there another day
[1:21:44] but patience in the will of God that
[1:21:47] possesses the life of God and you see
[1:21:50] one one brother Brandon would tell us
[1:21:52] that there's two phases to Christianity
[1:21:54] you remember him talking about that he
[1:21:56] says one and the first and he says the
[1:21:58] first pH is an intellectual faith and he
[1:22:01] says but the second one is an
[1:22:03] experimental Faith where you've tasted
[1:22:06] of it you've tried God and you
[1:22:08] experienced him to be true and what is
[1:22:10] so incredible is that brother brandom
[1:22:13] says that one of those has a mental
[1:22:15] conception of what God Said in his word
[1:22:18] and he says the other one has
[1:22:20] experienced it and he says the first one
[1:22:22] can't keep the victory he says says he
[1:22:24] feasts on the things of God but he says
[1:22:27] his Feast does not hang out does does
[1:22:29] not keep on going he says he's hungering
[1:22:31] all the time but he then he says that
[1:22:34] second one seems to have Victory all the
[1:22:36] time he says nothing seems to bother him
[1:22:39] he says he's feasting upon God and he
[1:22:41] says there's nothing bothers them they
[1:22:43] are just as solid and anchored as they
[1:22:46] can be no trials no storms bothers them
[1:22:49] at all and I like how brother Brandon
[1:22:51] puts it no trials no storms nothing
[1:22:55] bothers them it's not that they're not
[1:22:57] going through it but it's not bothering
[1:22:59] their soul you see remember the Brandon
[1:23:01] would tell us that we're Tri you and
[1:23:03] being right we're Body Soul and Spirit
[1:23:05] he says the body has has five senses
[1:23:08] sight taste smell hear and and and feel
[1:23:12] then he says your spirit man has five
[1:23:14] senses your imagination your conscience
[1:23:17] your reasoning your memory and your
[1:23:18] affection but then he says you've got
[1:23:20] the soul and he says there's only two in
[1:23:23] the soul which is faith and doubt and
[1:23:25] what I love about it is brother brandom
[1:23:28] says your faith rescues you from your
[1:23:30] five senses ain't that incredible so
[1:23:33] whenever your spirit man gets beat down
[1:23:36] that's why the Apostle Paul would say
[1:23:38] let us run this race with patience it's
[1:23:40] not when the spirit man gets beat down
[1:23:43] when the flesh gets beat down the soul
[1:23:45] is
[1:23:47] steadfast the soul is still steadfast
[1:23:50] and enduring even when the spirit man
[1:23:52] your imagination and your conscience and
[1:23:54] your reasoning your affection all of
[1:23:56] these things the devil's coming with
[1:23:58] fears whenever you can't see God feel
[1:24:01] God hear God tast him or whatever it is
[1:24:04] your soul is still persevering for the
[1:24:07] will of God that's why this message has
[1:24:10] got to go beyond your flesh beyond your
[1:24:13] spirit man to the soul cuz if it's on
[1:24:15] your flesh you may feel good but
[1:24:17] tomorrow your feelings going to go away
[1:24:19] if it's on your spirit man you may speak
[1:24:21] in tongues but that might be gone
[1:24:23] tomorrow but if it's in the soul when
[1:24:26] you're not speaking in song not speaking
[1:24:28] in tongues you're stabilized when you
[1:24:30] don't feel him you're still stabilized
[1:24:33] you see that's what with the Brandon
[1:24:34] would say you can have the Holy Ghost
[1:24:37] every day of your life and still go to
[1:24:39] hell you can have the Holy Ghost upon
[1:24:41] your flesh upon your spirit but if it's
[1:24:43] not in the soul it's not going to
[1:24:45] stabilize you but if this message ever
[1:24:48] goes to the soul you can go through the
[1:24:51] valley of the shadow of death you can go
[1:24:54] through the fiery furnace you can go
[1:24:56] through the Lion's Den and you know that
[1:24:58] you are in the will of God that's right
[1:25:02] he guideth my steps he's the one that
[1:25:09] performthe
[1:25:11] amen you see our soul has been
[1:25:14] stabilized but the brand would say you
[1:25:16] know now now that that's your birth he
[1:25:19] says when you're a natural man or
[1:25:21] natural woman but when you're reborned
[1:25:23] again there the
[1:25:25] that's not the outside conscience the
[1:25:27] outside is what you see taste them out
[1:25:29] here but the inside is what you really
[1:25:31] are now this out here Satan tempts you
[1:25:35] and knocks you around every way here but
[1:25:37] he can't get down here unless you let
[1:25:40] him for in here you've got faith faith
[1:25:43] don't come from the outer conscience it
[1:25:45] reasons but in faith there's no reason
[1:25:48] you've got it from God and you know that
[1:25:51] it's there I don't care how much it
[1:25:53] looks wrong you still know it's right
[1:25:56] it's thus saith the Lord ain't that
[1:25:59] powerful Faith don't reason it points to
[1:26:02] thus saith the Lord which is the will of
[1:26:04] God you know brother the brand I'm going
[1:26:06] talk about Elijah and would say Elijah
[1:26:08] would go to Mount Carmel and and I seen
[1:26:10] a meme the other day and I thought it
[1:26:12] was pretty funny it would say that
[1:26:14] Elijah was the first Trash talker you
[1:26:17] sports players you know and it's always
[1:26:18] it's aggravating when you know you're
[1:26:20] better than somebody but they get into
[1:26:22] your head right they and this guy's good
[1:26:25] at it he talks trash and as he as he
[1:26:27] gets into your head you start to mess up
[1:26:30] and could you imagine Elijah sitting
[1:26:33] there and then the priest of bail hey
[1:26:35] call a little louder maybe he's on a
[1:26:37] picnic maybe he's on a journey and you
[1:26:39] can and you can just imagine their
[1:26:41] frustration is getting up and up and
[1:26:43] they're starting to cut themselves oh
[1:26:45] cut yourself if that's what it takes go
[1:26:47] ahead and do it brother brandom says he
[1:26:49] was confident because he saw by Vision
[1:26:52] he had got the victory and so since he's
[1:26:55] seen by Vision he was persevering no
[1:26:58] matter the opposition that was against
[1:27:01] him and we've got a vision in this
[1:27:03] generation it don't matter the
[1:27:05] opposition that comes against your
[1:27:07] spirit man that comes against your flesh
[1:27:10] the soul is looking into the Unseen
[1:27:12] realm and says I'm stabilized it don't
[1:27:15] matter what I go through there's nothing
[1:27:18] that can keep me out of the will of God
[1:27:21] I'm stabilized in church this morning
[1:27:24] morning you can be so stabilized that
[1:27:26] whenever your child gets sick you can
[1:27:28] pray for him and God heals that prayer
[1:27:31] Hallelujah if you got a lost loved one
[1:27:34] that is out in drugs and alcohol you can
[1:27:37] still believe it's because you're
[1:27:39] believing from the soul not from the
[1:27:42] spirit man not from the flesh but from
[1:27:44] the
[1:27:45] soul hallelujah hallelujah that's where
[1:27:48] all things are possible in the
[1:27:52] soul there's no emotions to the soul oh
[1:27:56] hallelujah oh bless the Lord Glory no
[1:28:00] emotions to the soul you see because if
[1:28:02] we walk by emotions when we're happy you
[1:28:04] know I don't got it with me but I was
[1:28:07] looking at and there's emotions there
[1:28:09] there's multiple emotions and one that
[1:28:11] really stood out to me was happiness and
[1:28:14] it says when you're happy you're content
[1:28:18] and I thought wow that really donees
[1:28:20] something for me cuz I thought what
[1:28:22] about if you're not happy are you you're
[1:28:24] content still you know so if you're
[1:28:26] walking by your emotions your
[1:28:28] contentment is if you're happy and I
[1:28:30] think it was the Apostle Paul would say
[1:28:32] in whatever state I am in I have learned
[1:28:34] to be content so even when his emotions
[1:28:38] was up and was down when he was being
[1:28:40] scored being beaten being leted out of a
[1:28:43] w City out of a basket you know he was
[1:28:46] still content not from the emotions but
[1:28:48] from the soul you see and there's no
[1:28:51] reason in faith but the Brandon would
[1:28:53] say Jesus
[1:28:54] was walking in another world with
[1:28:56] perfect Faith ain't that incredible he
[1:28:59] was walking in another world and he says
[1:29:01] in this world he was walking where there
[1:29:04] was perfect faith and he says because he
[1:29:06] was walking in this realm virtue was
[1:29:09] coming out of his garments and he says
[1:29:11] that's the reason that the woman with
[1:29:13] the issue of blood would touch His
[1:29:15] Garment virtue would come come from him
[1:29:18] to that girl he would say it was because
[1:29:20] he was walking in another world and then
[1:29:23] he would not just stop
[1:29:24] he says now if you abide in me and
[1:29:27] through through him who brought us the
[1:29:29] word to you my words abide in you then
[1:29:32] walk in the same kind of way virtues
[1:29:35] flowing from you rivers of God's
[1:29:37] Fountains of blessings flowing out of
[1:29:39] the people see what I mean you're not
[1:29:41] bluffing you're not imagining it it's
[1:29:44] actually taking place you see it if
[1:29:46] you're just imagining it that don't do
[1:29:49] any good but if it's TR there it's
[1:29:51] really happening and then he would say
[1:29:54] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[1:29:56] by faith I mean substance Faith he is
[1:29:59] isolated from the entire world and so
[1:30:02] the very Dimension that Jesus would live
[1:30:05] in spiritually you've been invited to go
[1:30:08] to that place yeah oh even when your
[1:30:11] flesh is upon the Earth you can walk
[1:30:14] into another dimension where your soul
[1:30:16] is stabilized and brother the Brandon
[1:30:18] would tell us that then you got virtues
[1:30:21] coming out of you ain't that incredible
[1:30:23] that you can pray for the sick and they
[1:30:25] shall recover and but the Brandon would
[1:30:27] say not just the pastor but deacons or
[1:30:30] trustees but he says this means the Ley
[1:30:33] every individual walks in the world with
[1:30:36] God Alone every individual walks in the
[1:30:39] world with God alone you don't got to be
[1:30:42] a preacher you don't got to be a Sunday
[1:30:44] school teacher you don't got to be a
[1:30:45] deacon but if you've got perseverance
[1:30:48] him the soul and you're walking by faith
[1:30:51] you walk in another world alone with
[1:30:54] with God that's why nothing bothers the
[1:30:56] bride you see it's not that you're not
[1:30:58] going through things you see where the
[1:30:59] brandom talks about the wife that prayed
[1:31:02] for a dead husband y'all remember that
[1:31:03] brother Brandon would say that this
[1:31:05] husband had died he had a heart attack
[1:31:07] and he says he was a heavy man his eyes
[1:31:09] would go back into his head and he would
[1:31:11] lay down and would die and brother the
[1:31:13] brandom says this little woman would
[1:31:15] jump upon him and says I would not stand
[1:31:18] for it and he says life would come back
[1:31:20] to that husband I thought my goodness
[1:31:22] what about today
[1:31:24] when there's individuals that is
[1:31:25] ripening under the authority of the son
[1:31:29] where's your faith at come on where's
[1:31:31] your confidence and I won't stand for it
[1:31:34] when the enemy comes in like a flood I
[1:31:36] will not stand for it I don't care what
[1:31:38] comes against my mind I am not standing
[1:31:41] for it oh I love it brother brandom says
[1:31:44] well it wasn't his time then I would not
[1:31:47] stand for it and called us back called
[1:31:49] his his life back in the name of Jesus
[1:31:52] he got well see why the six sense woke
[1:31:55] up Rose up I would not stand for it but
[1:31:58] the Brandon would say perfect Faith
[1:32:00] Masters all circumstances and what's
[1:32:02] incredible is he would say no matter
[1:32:05] what it is it Masters it and you would
[1:32:07] almost think that he is talking about
[1:32:10] maybe controlling situations like you
[1:32:13] know uh I don't know what example you
[1:32:15] you could use like like changing
[1:32:16] situations but the brandom says that's
[1:32:18] not what it is but he says you see it's
[1:32:21] already got a masters faith believes
[1:32:24] that God will work it out I don't know
[1:32:27] how he's going to do it but he'll do it
[1:32:29] anyhow see and Masters all circumstances
[1:32:34] you see cuz too many times we look at
[1:32:36] that and think we need a miracle right
[1:32:38] now right if we don't get a miracle
[1:32:40] right now then God ain't heard my prayer
[1:32:42] but that's not what brother the
[1:32:43] brandom's talking about when he means by
[1:32:46] mastering is God we know God is going to
[1:32:48] work it out I don't know how God is
[1:32:51] going to do it but God is going to work
[1:32:53] it out that's what Masters every
[1:32:56] situation brother Brandon will tell us
[1:32:58] his greatest experience with God right
[1:33:00] is when he couldn't get underneath
[1:33:02] something couldn't get over something
[1:33:04] couldn't get around it but then God
[1:33:05] would show up and make a way through it
[1:33:08] right he he was perfect Faith mastering
[1:33:11] that situation when he could not see a
[1:33:13] way through it he believed that the
[1:33:16] Unseen could make a way through it and
[1:33:19] that's what has been given to the bride
[1:33:21] in this generation is perfect faith but
[1:33:23] the Brandon would say in that message
[1:33:25] perfect Faith he says now that's bride
[1:33:27] material he says perfect Faith that's
[1:33:30] bride material he says not wishy-washy
[1:33:33] but somebody that can Master it Master
[1:33:36] every situation Master the emotions
[1:33:39] Master the feelings of your senses
[1:33:41] whenever you can't you don't feel God
[1:33:43] you know God's there it's mastering it
[1:33:47] by A Perfect Faith you see it's patience
[1:33:50] but the brand must say he that ha in ear
[1:33:52] let him hear then he would say he that
[1:33:55] ha Faith leted him here and he says
[1:33:57] faith there's nothing that he says there
[1:34:00] faith says yes there's nothing can say
[1:34:02] no When God Says Yes and what's so
[1:34:04] incredible as is Revelations 3:10 would
[1:34:07] say because thou was kept the word of my
[1:34:10] patience I will also keep thee in the
[1:34:12] hour of Temptation so since you have
[1:34:15] kept my word in steadfastness I will
[1:34:18] keep you in the hour of Temptation you
[1:34:21] brother brownon would tell us the
[1:34:22] Temptation means to be tested tested so
[1:34:24] in the hour of being tested since you've
[1:34:27] kept my word with patience I will keep
[1:34:29] you and brother Brandon would say what
[1:34:31] does TH word mean by his patience he
[1:34:33] says he would talk about Abraham and
[1:34:35] would say he he obtained The Promise by
[1:34:38] patiently enduring he says see the
[1:34:41] spirit is speaking about the word of God
[1:34:43] which is given to us to wait for the
[1:34:46] Fulfillment of that word requires even
[1:34:48] more patience and he says in the case of
[1:34:51] Abraham he endured seeing him who is
[1:34:54] invisible he was patient and then the
[1:34:56] word was finally fulfilled that really
[1:34:59] spoke to my heart whenever I was
[1:35:00] studying on that brother brandom say or
[1:35:02] the Bible would say he endured with
[1:35:05] patience then brother brandom says he
[1:35:07] seen the invisible it was his patience
[1:35:10] enduring until he broke into that other
[1:35:13] dimension until he could see God face to
[1:35:16] face oh man so he could seek him maybe
[1:35:19] not with natural eyes but with
[1:35:21] Revelation he could see into that other
[1:35:24] dimension and you see but it took the
[1:35:26] patience it took it took took him
[1:35:28] enduring the press and you see but the
[1:35:30] Brandon would talk about the woman with
[1:35:32] the blood issue and but brother Brandon
[1:35:34] would say Jesus would stop and would say
[1:35:36] who touched me and he would say Jesus
[1:35:38] done that was because the lady felt like
[1:35:41] the like her blood dried up remember and
[1:35:44] brother brandom says in order to prove
[1:35:46] it to that lady he had to stop and said
[1:35:50] who touched me so him questioning her
[1:35:53] her faith brought her
[1:35:55] patience oh that no matter what the
[1:35:58] Skeptics would say her patience would
[1:36:01] endure and break through to the Unseen
[1:36:04] cuz why you know you know uh what if the
[1:36:06] Skeptics would have came up and said
[1:36:08] know you're just feeling good right now
[1:36:09] but tomorrow you're going to start
[1:36:11] bleeding again and what if the Skeptics
[1:36:13] would have just came and so beat her
[1:36:15] down and she lost her faith but brother
[1:36:17] brandom says he questioned her faith to
[1:36:20] prove it that no matter what she would
[1:36:22] go through it was already proven cuz God
[1:36:25] stopped and said who touched me then she
[1:36:28] would stop and out of Faith would say I
[1:36:30] touched you you see could you see the
[1:36:33] the faith mastering that situation I
[1:36:35] touched you fear would have been like
[1:36:37] don't raise your hand the disciples are
[1:36:39] going against you or you're you're
[1:36:40] you're an unclean woman the Master's
[1:36:42] going to will strike out against you you
[1:36:44] know what what if it was fear coming but
[1:36:47] Faith would rise up above the fear and
[1:36:49] would answer the call answer the
[1:36:51] challenge and would say I touched you oh
[1:36:54] Hallelujah he would say it was perfect
[1:36:57] faith that touched her and you see
[1:36:59] sometimes when when when God questions
[1:37:01] your faith you got to persevere through
[1:37:03] it and it's giv me a few more minutes
[1:37:05] here and you see sometimes we got to
[1:37:07] believe even when we don't see any
[1:37:09] results when we don't feel any better
[1:37:11] you see the Bible would tell us in Luke
[1:37:14] 24:49 and behold I send the promise of
[1:37:17] my father upon you but tar ye in the
[1:37:20] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:37:23] with power from on high you see the word
[1:37:26] Terry in the Hebrew means to stay abide
[1:37:29] to continue to stay in expectation so
[1:37:33] Jesus is saying behold I send the
[1:37:35] promise of my father but stay in
[1:37:38] expectation till it comes and I thought
[1:37:40] that's powerful cuz he promised it to
[1:37:43] come but you have to stay in expectation
[1:37:46] and many times we get promises but we fa
[1:37:48] to stay in expectation we expect it for
[1:37:51] today for tomorrow but then next week we
[1:37:54] start to lose our faith we start to lose
[1:37:56] our patience we start to lose our
[1:37:58] perseverance but you see somebody would
[1:38:00] ask brother brandom a question dear
[1:38:02] brother Brandon what is the difference
[1:38:04] when Jesus breathed on the disciples and
[1:38:07] said receive ye the Holy Ghost and when
[1:38:09] they had to go to the upper room the ter
[1:38:11] he answers the question it was a promise
[1:38:13] he gave them breathed upon them his
[1:38:16] promise and said receive ye the Holy
[1:38:18] Ghost it was a promise then they went to
[1:38:21] the upper room for the promise promise
[1:38:24] to be fulfilled same thing is when you
[1:38:26] laid your hands upon you to be healed
[1:38:29] then you got to go about your business
[1:38:31] waiting for the promise to be fulfilled
[1:38:35] so Jesus breathed on them and said
[1:38:37] receive ye the holy ghost that was a
[1:38:40] promise but then in order for them to
[1:38:42] receive that promise they had to go to
[1:38:44] the upper room and stay in
[1:38:46] expectation they had to T they had to
[1:38:49] have patience to persevere and oh my we
[1:38:53] need patience in this generation to
[1:38:55] persevere to stay in expectation the
[1:38:59] Rapture might not happen today but it's
[1:39:01] going to happen tomorrow if it don't
[1:39:03] happen tomorrow we're looking for it
[1:39:04] next week we're patiently enduring for
[1:39:08] the will of God to be
[1:39:10] fulfilled oh Hallelujah you see but it's
[1:39:13] hard to wait in faith sometimes you
[1:39:15] remember Daniel he he prayed for 21 days
[1:39:18] and could you imagine the Mind battles
[1:39:19] of Daniel he was a man of inspiration
[1:39:21] God would speak to him that was 21 days
[1:39:23] and we can't even pray through for 4
[1:39:25] hours 3 hours 2 hours here Daniel is
[1:39:27] praying through for 21 days and then
[1:39:30] there came an angel that was says God
[1:39:32] heard you the first day but I had to
[1:39:35] fight for the Prince of Persia ain't
[1:39:37] that incredible that he had to fight
[1:39:40] through the spirits of the day for in
[1:39:42] order for Daniel to hear or for him to
[1:39:44] get his answer and sometimes we don't
[1:39:47] get the answer right away but it's on
[1:39:49] the way it's fighting through
[1:39:50] lukewarmness it's fighting through Leia
[1:39:53] it's fighting through doubt through
[1:39:55] unbelief but your answer is on the way
[1:39:57] you got to endure with patience with
[1:40:01] steadfastness in the soul be stabilized
[1:40:04] that no matter if it comes today I'm
[1:40:05] expecting to hear it from God and what's
[1:40:08] so incredible as the Bible says in
[1:40:10] Daniel 10:18 then came again and touched
[1:40:13] me one like the appearance of man and he
[1:40:15] strengthened me and oh and said oh man
[1:40:18] greatly beloved fear not peace be unto
[1:40:21] you be strong yay be strong and when he
[1:40:23] spoke unto me I was strengthened ain't
[1:40:27] that incredible that he was weakened
[1:40:29] because he was persevering but when his
[1:40:31] answer came it strengthened him whenever
[1:40:34] he spoke it was strengthen him and I
[1:40:36] think my goodness we've got an
[1:40:38] inspiration in this generation that is
[1:40:40] strengthening our faith muscles that
[1:40:43] when we get tired we're pressing we're
[1:40:45] believing but then there comes a
[1:40:46] strength you see that's what was
[1:40:48] strengthen job was when the voice of God
[1:40:51] would speak the voice of God always
[1:40:53] bring strength you remember whenever the
[1:40:55] maid had died Jeri's daughter the Bible
[1:40:57] would say Jesus would go in and what
[1:40:59] would Jesus do he would have all the
[1:41:01] unbelief go out of the house I think M
[1:41:04] that's what what God has done in this
[1:41:06] generation he has brought a message to
[1:41:08] remove all the doubt and what would
[1:41:10] happened the Bible says that he would go
[1:41:12] up and go up to to to the jus' daughter
[1:41:15] and would say Maiden rise he would speak
[1:41:18] to her and bring her to life then what
[1:41:20] would he do what would he do then would
[1:41:23] say give her some meat to eat he would
[1:41:26] strength same voice that brought her
[1:41:28] back to life would strengthen her and I
[1:41:31] we've got a strength in this generation
[1:41:34] by the voice of God the same voice that
[1:41:37] brought us out of a denominational tomb
[1:41:39] has strengthen Us by the voice of God
[1:41:41] you see and here would stand job and job
[1:41:44] would he would talk about the trees and
[1:41:46] the Botley life if they die the sense of
[1:41:48] water brings them back he asked the
[1:41:50] question if a man dies shall he live
[1:41:52] again he he was live without inspiration
[1:41:55] he was living in a mystery and I think
[1:41:57] it's so so incredible that here would
[1:41:59] come the Thunders we all know the story
[1:42:01] the Thunders would start to blare and
[1:42:03] brother brandom says when the Thunder be
[1:42:05] to Roar inspiration struck job everybody
[1:42:09] else heard Thunders but he heard more
[1:42:12] than Thunders he heard a voice and what
[1:42:14] would that voice do that voice would
[1:42:17] answered every question that job would
[1:42:19] have remember job would say if a man die
[1:42:22] shall he live again if I can only find
[1:42:25] God I will talk to him that was before
[1:42:28] inspiration but once the voice spoke
[1:42:30] through the Thunders he would say I know
[1:42:33] my redeemer liveth the very one he was
[1:42:36] looking for inspiration broken into the
[1:42:39] invisible where he could see him then
[1:42:42] what else would he say in my flesh I
[1:42:45] will see God his question was if a man
[1:42:48] die shall he live again then the answer
[1:42:51] would say in your flesh you're going to
[1:42:54] see me even though skin worms take over
[1:42:56] your body I'm giving you an answer you
[1:42:59] can see and be stabilized here's the
[1:43:02] will for your life is not to go into the
[1:43:06] grave and die there but you will see me
[1:43:09] once again the will for your life is on
[1:43:12] the other side of the trial God ain't
[1:43:14] meant for you to die in your tribulation
[1:43:17] die in your trial but job could look on
[1:43:20] the other side of this Affliction I will
[1:43:23] will be seeing God hallelujah you will
[1:43:26] be seeing God on the other side of your
[1:43:30] Affliction how come brother Josh we're
[1:43:34] stabilized we're
[1:43:36] stabilized I have heard but now I see
[1:43:40] I've heard of thee by the hearing of the
[1:43:42] ear and brother brandom you know what
[1:43:43] brother brandom says he says he was a
[1:43:45] man of vision so God would come and
[1:43:47] speak to him that's what he meant by
[1:43:50] hearing God by the hearing of the Year
[1:43:52] by then he says then he seen God not
[1:43:56] just he heard of him but then he seen
[1:43:58] him he broke into the invisible and but
[1:44:01] the Brandon would say this now we wonder
[1:44:03] if we could see God Is there a way we
[1:44:05] could see him now it was the only way
[1:44:07] God had a trying job out he said I have
[1:44:10] heard of thee with the hearing of the
[1:44:12] ear but now now I see thee with my eyes
[1:44:16] the vision of the invisible had been
[1:44:19] made plain the vision of the invisible
[1:44:22] had been made plain but what brought
[1:44:25] this on was the Thunders right everybody
[1:44:28] else just heard
[1:44:29] thunder job didn't hear just Thunder he
[1:44:32] heard the mystery that was in the
[1:44:34] Thunders and oh man we still got people
[1:44:36] looking around for the Thunders right
[1:44:38] what's the mystery of the Thunders but
[1:44:39] the Brandon would tell us that the
[1:44:41] mystery of the Thunder is the voice of
[1:44:42] God so job heard a voice that would
[1:44:45] bring inspiration that would answer
[1:44:48] every question that he was in we've had
[1:44:50] a voice in this generation that would
[1:44:53] answer every question that we are going
[1:44:55] through for the brand say the seventh
[1:44:57] angel Begins the sound begins with his
[1:44:59] message not a healing service but the
[1:45:01] message that follows the healing service
[1:45:05] so we didn't just get a healing service
[1:45:07] and prayer lines we got a voice of God
[1:45:10] in this generation that says hey I'm
[1:45:12] here to answer your questions I know you
[1:45:14] may feel like you're all by yourself but
[1:45:17] here I know you're looking for me you're
[1:45:19] looking for that friend that sticketh
[1:45:20] closer than a brother but here I'm
[1:45:22] revealing myself in this generation
[1:45:25] where you can see me where you can feel
[1:45:27] me then brother Brandon would say this
[1:45:30] here he seen that Vision talking about
[1:45:32] job and he said I know my redeemer
[1:45:34] liveth and at the last day he'll stand
[1:45:36] on this Earth and he says I'm tying
[1:45:39] myself to that job was looking by Vision
[1:45:43] then he would tie himself to the will of
[1:45:46] God that God would reveal to him by the
[1:45:49] Thunders oh we got the mystery of the
[1:45:51] Thunders we got a message mess we got a
[1:45:53] voice it's time that we tie oursel to it
[1:45:57] that's why I believe this message is our
[1:45:59] absolute we can tie ourself to it and
[1:46:01] wherever this message goes I'm going
[1:46:04] with it whenever it goes back to God I'm
[1:46:06] tied to it if I if I go through hard
[1:46:08] times it's still with me you see we're
[1:46:11] tied to it and you see we're putting on
[1:46:14] we're putting on the strength brother
[1:46:16] brand say now then we can see that Jesus
[1:46:19] is the door he is the door of the sheep
[1:46:21] and notice that it speaks now of the
[1:46:23] opening of the door of the open door the
[1:46:25] door opening what what what is that but
[1:46:28] a revelation of him and that Revelation
[1:46:31] is opening up to to bring us strength to
[1:46:34] illuminate the word and glorify his name
[1:46:38] so the revelation of Christ is bringing
[1:46:40] a strength so here would stand job or or
[1:46:43] sit job on his Ash sheep and he was
[1:46:45] still on his Ash sheep but now he would
[1:46:47] have strength to keep persevering cuz I
[1:46:50] know I know myself I I often thought
[1:46:52] that as soon as he heard the Thunders he
[1:46:54] was right off the he was right off the
[1:46:56] as sheap but he was still there but he
[1:46:58] had strength now that no matter what is
[1:47:01] so incredible that God would then reward
[1:47:03] job right because you notice that all of
[1:47:06] his friends would turn against him and
[1:47:08] what is so incredible is the Bible says
[1:47:11] right after God would speak to job he
[1:47:14] then he then speaks to his friends him
[1:47:17] says now I'm coming against y'all he
[1:47:19] says because y'all did not speak good of
[1:47:21] me like job did and that really done my
[1:47:24] heart good that he God was an oblivious
[1:47:27] to everything that job was going through
[1:47:29] he was there he was there even when he
[1:47:32] when the friends turned against him wife
[1:47:33] turned against him God was still there
[1:47:36] and after God would come and Inspire job
[1:47:39] he would then look to all the critics
[1:47:41] and would say now what about you he
[1:47:43] endured and you spoke evil of me but he
[1:47:46] still spoke good of me even when he did
[1:47:48] not feel me see me hear me he still
[1:47:52] spoke good of me
[1:47:53] God sees you when you're in the hard
[1:47:55] time he sees you when when the Mind
[1:47:57] battle says you're a secret sinner when
[1:47:59] the Mind battle says you're out of the
[1:48:00] will of God when friend says you done
[1:48:02] this wrong God's watching you and say oh
[1:48:05] yeah that's somebody that is still being
[1:48:06] steadfast still being patient still
[1:48:09] enduring even when they don't see me you
[1:48:12] see it was the revelation of Christ in
[1:48:14] this generation that would bring us
[1:48:16] strength and it's so incredible the
[1:48:18] Bible would say in Isaiah 52 And1 awake
[1:48:21] awake put on that strength oh Zion Put
[1:48:24] On th beautiful garments oh Jerusalem
[1:48:27] the holy city for henceforth there shall
[1:48:29] no more come into Thee the uncircumcised
[1:48:32] and unclean the second verse Shake
[1:48:34] thyself from the dust I love that
[1:48:37] because it says arise and put on thy
[1:48:39] strength then the next verse says Shake
[1:48:41] thyself from the dust what is it
[1:48:44] humanity is your dust but God has given
[1:48:46] us a strength in this generation where
[1:48:49] you can put on the strength in our eyes
[1:48:52] the Bible would say in Isaiah 16:1 arise
[1:48:55] and shine for thy light has come and the
[1:48:57] glory of the Lord is risen upon thee so
[1:49:01] it's something that we are putting on
[1:49:03] this message ain't just something in our
[1:49:05] imagination something that we hear but
[1:49:06] it's a strength that we are putting on
[1:49:09] you remember brother brandom talks about
[1:49:10] about blind bmus that he was a beggar
[1:49:13] and he said that he had a Beggar's cloak
[1:49:14] on right and he says whenever Jesus
[1:49:16] would come by he was begging and the
[1:49:19] cloak identified him as a beggar but
[1:49:21] once Jesus opened open up his eyes he
[1:49:23] says he wasn't a beggar no more he would
[1:49:26] take off that garment he didn't need
[1:49:28] that garment anymore cuz no longer was
[1:49:30] he begging but now he's overcoming and
[1:49:33] here the Bible is saying arise Shake
[1:49:35] thyself from the dust and put on thy
[1:49:38] strength you don't need the the the the
[1:49:41] Garment of humanity bringing you down
[1:49:43] and bringing you down put on the
[1:49:44] strength of this word and Shake thyself
[1:49:47] from the dust Shake thyself from your
[1:49:49] imagination Shake thyself from your
[1:49:51] reasoning and your cons and your
[1:49:53] affection and your memory the
[1:49:55] condemnation that comes up against you
[1:49:57] shake yourself from it and arise and put
