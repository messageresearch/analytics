the honor and glory for it Lord we just commit the service into your hands the name Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen let's turn to Matthew chapter 7. Matthew chapter 7 and starting at verse 15. beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves you shall know them by their fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them you all can have your seats let's turn back to Genesis chapter 2 and excuse me for a few minutes while we go through a couple different scriptures just to kind of begin to set a foundation of where we're going to be going this morning but Genesis chapter 2 and starting at verse 8 and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the site and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so we're going to go on to Genesis chapter 3. we'll start with verse 7. and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons then we're going to drop down to verse 21. unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them and then going on to Genesis chapter 4. and verse 3. and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the first sling of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth in his countenance fell and then we're going to turn to Hebrews chapter 11. Hebrews chapter 11. and verse 4. by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh Cain and Abel didn't have a written bible to reference the scriptures hadn't been put out yet but they did have parents and I want you to just think for a little bit and kind of Imagine them sitting around and hearing the stories from from their father and from their mother as they're sitting there and here you have Adam and he's and Eve and they're they're talking about the beauty of the garden they're talking about where they were and what they experienced the Perfection how everything was just right and I can you can just picture here's both Cain and Abel sitting there you know their eyes may be just a little bit wide as they're getting the story of the thing that they didn't get to experience it was Adam and Eve that were there and here they are they're sharing and they're talking about it and I can see them as most parents are where as their kids are at certain age they're gonna shelter them up to a point be like okay I can't tell you every single detail yet you know it's the same thing with with my children what I can tell my daughter at eight years old is not the same as what I can share with my son that is 14 years old they have different levels of understanding they have different levels of what they can take and so as these boys are growing maybe they start out as they're they're telling the story and they talk about the how they failed in the garden but they don't really go into details about it it's you know we made a mistake we disobeyed and so God cast us out of the garden that's it maybe that's all they share because partly they're protecting their children and partly they're sitting there in their own embarrassment and shame over what they went through but then as the children get older they start maybe sharing just a little bit more being just a little more explicit and finally comes the day where you can see I can picture Adam taking his boys and walking and traveling with them to the point where they can see the garden in the distance they can see that gate of the garden where they can't get in because the angel is there defending it but they can he can point it out to him be like that was where we were that was where we came from that was where we were living and this is what happened your mother was deceived and then I went and I took part in it as well and we went and we knew that we were naked we knew that we were exposed and so we tried to put together leaves we tried to make fashion some sort of garment or some sort of covering but that didn't feel like it was enough when God Called to us we still didn't feel like we were truly covered we had to hide from him and then finally God had to go and he had to cast us out of the garden and when he was casting us out he slew a lamb and he gave us the skins and he fashioned the clothes and he sent us out of the garden and here Cain and Abel they've gotten a little bit older that's maybe it's not with so much wide-eyed wonder anymore they've heard the stories over and over but this time Adam is sharing even more details he's going even more into it to try to let them know what happened and I don't know how far he went I know that sometimes parents maybe we don't want to reveal to our kids exactly how far we went and sin maybe we don't want to reveal exactly how big our mistakes were we don't want to go into every single detail we're going to tell them enough to try to help them understand but we don't want to to do everything I don't know how much Adam told the boys I don't know how far he went into it but yet for every man Man was created to have fellowship with God we were created to worship God and so these boys had that desire within them that they wanted to be back in Fellowship they wanted to be back into that place to worship and so they come down with that desire that they want to make an offering and they want to to worship their creator and they want to go in to this place and so finally they come and they gather together everything to go okay we're going to make our offering and we're going to come into the place and we're going to do it and Adam has told this story countless times Adam and Eve have shared countless times over the years I'm sure they had plenty of other stories as they described the garden but this was the big event I'm sure they talked about what it was like to be in the presence of God and just converse with him and spend time with him in the cool of the evening but anytime you would share that this is what comes down at the end of then we messed up that's why you're not in that presence anymore that's why you're not in that place anymore and so they come down to this place of it's time we're we have this desire we want to worship God we want to have that kind of Fellowship that our parents had but we can't get that close and so we have to come in and we have to offer the sacrifice and try to enter into some measure of fellowship with our creator and so they come in and they both make their offerings Cain gathers everything from the field he's he's the farmer he grabbed gathers everything that he's been growing everything that he's been Gathering to try to put it together to have the most beautiful offering that he can give and Abel here he's the Sheep herder he's the one watching over the flocks and both of them have heard the stories time and time again but what you have is Adam talked about the fact that I tried to make my covering I tried to make it out of the leaves I tried to make it out of the plants but it wasn't enough but yet Cain looked at the beauty of the plants looked at the beauty of everything that was growing it was like this would be the best type of offering this is what I need to bring that's going to bring me back into Fellowship where Abel had focused on the other part of the story gone God had to make bloody skins God had to kill the animal to make the Garment so I need to come in with that same thing I need to come in with that same place brother Brandon says in the sermon spiritual adoption he says look in the Garden of Eden when when Cain brought an offering into worship the same as Abel did he worshiped he paid to the church he sacrificed he done every religious deed brighter better more fitted than what Abel did he built a better altar he made it prettier he put glamor to his worship you see that strain still working amongst the Suns he put glamor to it with the fruits of the field and the big Lillian not only that but he worshiped there is a way that seemeth right unto man but what he did he worshiped through knowledge he worshiped not by Revelation and it's possible get it now listen you can worship through knowledge you can go to church by knowledge but going to church that way is worshiping in vain but when there's something happens down in your heart that makes you love God in such a way you can't stay from church that's the revelation God revealing they had no Bible then they didn't even have paper or slate to work with they had no schools of Education so Abel by Revelation it was revealed to him by God it was not Beauty neither was it the fruits of the field or the apples that had drove them from the Garden of Eden but it was blood and it was revealed to him and he went and he got a lamb by revelation he foresaw the coming of the just lamb and it was revealed to him so he got a lamb and he offered it to God and it was accepted the whole church is built upon spiritual revelation how beautiful and in the sermon the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it costs to rid Sin from our lives and notice now this is a beautiful picture oh my I can see Cain and Abel tooling now or going out to make a sacrifice I believe they built their altar right at the gate at the throne where they could worship notice Here Comes Cain he he probably worked all year toiling doing everything he could to get the very biggest and best apples or pumpkins or whatever he brought it he built him an altar right there by the side of the gate put up all his fruits and the big calla lilies and everything and just laid them on the altar correctly then knelt down and worshiped God now I hope this just soaks way down as it never before till you get it see now notice if God only requires you to go to church Cain was just was as just as able Cain built an altar unto the Lord you say well brother Branham I don't only do that but I make a sacrifice I pay to foreign missions and I them things are all right them is all right but God requires more Cain did that himself see he brought a sacrifice he worshiped the Lord he knelt down and offered praise unto the Lord and said Lord here I am here I am and I've brought you an offering I've built an altar in so many words I'm a member of the church did it hit the bottom look a member of the church I believe in you it'll go to the Bottom now let it soak real deep I'm a Believer in God I've built an altar I've brought a sacrifice and here comes Cain he made his offering he worshiped he went to church he just as good as the next fellow Esau was the same Esau and his character was a better man than Jacob more of a gentleman he loved his father the things that he'd done but God chose Jacob notice now when Abel come to make his offering was quite different when Abel come he didn't work he didn't try to find the biggest church in town to go to he didn't try to find the nicest bunch of people to associate with he just took something that he had and come on he was a shepherd so he just reached over and got a lamb and he tied it with a grapevine or something like that wrapped it around his neck they led him to Calvary he was the lamb said why was he born in a barn well Lambs are not born in houses they are born in Barns and they was led led to the slaughter like a lamb and they led him away leading him up Calvary he was God's lamb from the foundation of the world and there come Abel's Little Lamb and then over here there come God's lamb when I think of it my heart just turns over and over when I think me a poor unworthy ungodly sinner dying without god without Christ in the world without hope and in due season Christ died in my stead the beautiful one and became despised and rejected that I might be accepted and his sighted my Stead oh I just can't get over it I just can't imagine how he would do that for me the Holy Spirit Come hunted me up one day and said he did it for you and I believed him yes sir I accepted him I found it to be so now I can see little Abel watch now I can see Abel go and get this little Grapevine Reach Out get a little male lamb wrapped inside around the neck here he comes dragging him not much Beauty to that is there pulled him up there he got him up a big rock laying there now notice candid probably toiled all year to make the best crop he could thought he could please God by that and many people say I'm going to quit lying I'm going to quit stealing I'll quit smoking I'll turn to a better class of people I'll get in some Society God don't care about your turning a new page he wants you to turn your heart to Christ and let him make out of you now what you can do it's not by Good Works we are saved but by his Mercy are we bought not by works lest any man should boast for we are Gods because it isn't what I am isn't what I do myself it's what Christ and God had did for me and for you notice beautiful type here he comes dragging the little lamb pulling him along I can imagine the little fellow falling probably knew what was near dragging his little feet here comes the little fellow bleeding along and we got him up to the great Rock laid him upon the rock take a piece of sharp Rock laid him like that took him by the back of the head and pulled him like this begin to chop at his little throat The Rock began to beat through his throat on the Rock died the lamb bleeding bladding blood splashing the blood flying all over his little white will became bathed red then with blood God looked down from heaven and said that's it now you got it that's the way the blood spurting from his little veins and one last place right now when the offering was on the altar God refused his intellectual conception of God but when he seen Abel by simple Faith to believe there was not apples or fruits of the field but it was by Blood by faith he believed it by Revelation from God God Vindicated Abel by accepting his sacrifice see these boys had heard everything from their parents they had heard the exact same Stories the exact same information everything had come out but one received the Revelation that it required blood one couldn't see that what was on the inside the seed was being manifest in the fruits that were coming forth Jesus told a lot of Parables about seeds he talked a lot about seeds and fruit and you can go through so many different places in the scriptures where this is the focus God did not manifested that everything that was pretty would be the direction that he would go it wasn't in Beauty when we look at these original sacrifices it wasn't in the beauty of the field the nice flowers nice plants any of these kinds of things it was in the bloody lamb that would be the sacrifice that was what he would accept that's what was the bridge that it would allow you to get back into fellowship with him in Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 19 it says for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and Scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoyed unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without the shedding of blood is no remission let's go to Leviticus chapter 4. and verse 27. and if any one of the Common People sin through ignorance while he doeth somewhat against any of The Commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not be done and be guilty or if his sin which he had sinned come to his knowledge then he shall bring his offering a kid of the goats a female without blemish for his sin which he hath sinned and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering God gave the instruction on this is how you approach me God gave the instruction that this is what you're supposed to do and the way that God instructed was not the nicest or the most enjoyable way it wasn't the way that you would think that you wanted to do sorry I'm trying to find what I was looking for here praise the Lord praise the Lord there it is from the church age book The smyrnan Church age in the Old Testament The Sinner brought a lamb he placed his hand on the lamb while the priest cut the Lamb's throat he felt the bleeding and he heard the bleating he felt the body stiffened in death he saw the smoke of the sprinkled blood Ascend to God he knew that the lamb had taken his place he knew that the Lamb's life had been forfeited for his but the life of that lamb was animal life it could not come back upon the sinner making him clean so he left with the same desire to sin he would go out with sin in his mind and come back and offer a sacrifice for the same thing a year later all too often in this world when people get gather to worship or gather for anything else they're attracted to what looks good they're attracted to what is well put together what is organized well what is decorated well what is this that the other take your description but we want to go to the church that looks the best we want to go to uh where we've got the preacher that can organize everything and and preach the best he can sound the the smoothest in his speech he doesn't stutter he doesn't keep going back over the exact same thing he was able to run through the points and it can be an enjoyable thing to listen to he's a good public speakers good in these types of situations we want to be at the church where everyone's going to dress a little bit nicer and I'm gonna feel like I fit in with the group or maybe they have the the best uh worship team up there that is able to do all these types of fancy presentations and fancy music and do all this that's going to allow me not only to oh feel like I'm worshiping but then also to enjoy it because it's just so attractive it's so so good looking it's the place that that I want to be at when we look at Jesus talking about these different Parables with with the seeds everything that he points to is the fact that by the fruits you shall know them it's What comes forth that's going to allow you to know what's actually on the inside just because someone gathers in this church or just because someone gathers in the church that looks fancy doesn't immediately tell you everything about them just going on that first step doesn't tell you what's going on because the seed that's on the inside still has to come forth it has to start putting forth its fruits for you to know what's going on in the inside you can have the fruits to go I'm willing to sacrifice anything and if that means it's messy if that means it's bloody if that means I'm going this route then that's okay and you have those with the seed that are more like I want to do what's comfortable I want to do what's enjoyable I want to do what I can go into this step and that's going to be what the seed manifests Matthew chapter 13. and verse 24 says another Parable he put forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also the Servants of the household came and said unto him sir dips thou so good seed in thy field from Once then hath it tears he said unto them an enemy hath done this the servant said unto him will thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tares you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn now I know we've heard it described before about how the fact that the wheat and the tares look so much like each other when they're first growing but I had to look it up because I'd never actually seen any pictures of it I've heard people say that over and over but I never looked it up it's just keys if you wouldn't mind showing so here you have wheat and tears before the wheat's fully ripe now they're labeled so you can tell which is which but if you were to take away the label I don't know anything about plants those are going to look like the exact same thing to me now I'm sure if you get somebody that is super experienced and they know everything there is they could probably Identify some characteristic about them let's go okay that's the wheat that's the tares but the general Layman that would go out and work in fields and say hey your job is to pull these up is not going to be able to tell the difference as they go through and go yes those are the tares and those are the wheat at this early stage they look the same they don't they're not exhibiting everything different they're both going with the desire that hey we want to worship we want to enter into the presence we want to uh do everything that we're supposed to we want to respond to the word we want to do this all the the desires everything you see from the outside it looks the same it's only as they go further in as they come to full maturity that you'll begin to see the wheat moving into that Golden State moving into the state of you're ready to harvest where the tares just continue to say these green weeds that keep going there begins to be a transformation over time but it's not an instant it takes time for this seed to manifest and for the fruits to show what the seed was let's go to Isaiah chapter one Isaiah chapter 1 and verse 11. to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifice unto me saith the Lord I am full of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts and I Delight not in the blood of Bullocks or of lambs or if he goats when you come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts bring no more vain oblations incense is an Abomination unto me the new moons in the sabbaths the callings of assemblies I cannot away with it it is Iniquity even the solemn meeting your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are trouble unto me I am weary to Bear them and when you spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you yea when you make many prayers I will not hear your hands are full of blood Israel had received the instruction that this is how you were supposed to worship this is how you're supposed to sacrifice but over time they moved into place of they did it because they had to they did it because this was the law show up once a year put in the sacrifice but they weren't actually doing it because they wanted to they weren't actually doing it because they wanted to worship once again if you looked at it from the outside the two seeds looked the same you had some from Israel that they were coming in in sincerity they came in because they wanted to be cleansed they wanted to offer the sacrifice they wanted to worship God and then you had those that simply came because it's tradition it's the law it's what I have to do if I don't do it I'm going to be looked down upon by those around me I've got to do this in order to be able to fit in with all those around me so from the outside the seeds looked the same from the outside the plants at this point manifested they looked the same this is obviously the point where God could look at the heart he could look at what the true fruit was and go no that's an Abomination to me I won't accept your sacrifice because you're not coming with the true desire to worship it may appear to all those around like hey I'm gathering I'm here I'm worshiping but God is the one who judges the heart God is the one who knows what the seed is he knows what fruit is being manifested it all comes down to what is the actual seed that was at the beginning what was the actual seed that was planted in you from the beginning is it the seed that's going to bring forth the wheat or is it the seed that's going to bring forth the tares you had that at the beginning with Cain and Abel what was the seed that was going to manifest was it the seed that was truly going to worship or was the seed that wanted to Worship in their way here in Israel you had the same manifestation happening did you have the seed that you truly were coming to worship truly coming to sacrifice truly coming to repent or was it simply the seed of I'm going to do what's necessary I'm going to do what's expected I don't want to be here I'd rather be at home but I'm going to do this and today we find the same thing when each of us come into service are we coming with that desire that I'm coming in willing to go through whatever willing to push through whatever Satan threw at me this Sunday morning in order to get here because I had the desire to worship I have the desire to be in his presence or is it simply to go well if I don't show up brother Harry might shoot me a text to see how I'm doing it where am I at or they'll think badly of me because I wasn't there or this that the other is it actually the desire to be there what's the seed that's manifesting what's the fruit that's coming forth and the sermon the world is falling apart see Israel first when God told them to take a sacrifice and go offer it why it was a great thing you can imagine a Jew going down the road with a lamb or Bullock or whatever it was he goes down lays his hand upon the sacrifice that's connecting himself identity identifying himself with the sacrifice when he puts his hand on it the priest killed the Beast the little lamb whatever it was and as the little fellow died kicking and bleeding the blood splashed upon his hands and the worshiper in sincerity knowed that that should be him but the lamb was taking his place that's what Jehovah acquired because it was a type of Christ but one time that kept on going on until it became a family tradition they offered the lamb just the same but there was no sincerity about it God said they stink in my nostrils and today years ago we used to find the people in deep sincerity and worship and today it's become a big glamor of Hollywood just some kind of trained music women up on the platform with their clothes tight enough the skin on the outside almost dancing around over the platform no sincerity and almost making it just an outright ridiculous shame in professing Christianity I wonder if our offering hasn't become a kind of stench in his nose again our differences and in the true and false Vines he said now in the coming out there was two boys after Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel they were both the children of the parent now remember both boys tried to find favor with God and they made an altar now here's the shocking part okay right down to the bottom Cain was not an unbeliever Cain was a believer Kane was not an unbeliever Cain was a Believer and if a Believer is all that God required God was unjust condemning Cain and accepting another believer Kane was not a communist Kane was not an Infidel Cain was a religious man and notice he came to worship God he was not only a Believer he was a worshiper not of a false cult he was a worshiper of Jehovah God I've heard people say all you have to do is confess Jesus to be the Son of God you're saved Devils have done the same thing and they're not saved takes more than that the devil said we know who you are who you are the Son of God the Holy One of Israel publicly confessing Cain was a Believer and acknowledged the Creator not only that but he was a worshiper now I suppose that the east side of the Garden of Eden where the garden lays East and Eden perhaps there that was where the Great Sword of the Angel was flipping back and forth and guarding that tree Cain and Abel out there work in the fields realize that they come from that lovely home they was trying to worship God and Cain built himself an altar or a church and Abel built in one Cain made a sacrifice Abel made one Cain nelton worship Abel did the same thing now if God only requires a confession or an altar or church membership a sacrifice a membership a loyalty to the church part of your money your time of worship your sincerity for what you believe then God being just would have to accept Cain Amos chapter 5 and verse 21 it says I hate I despise your feast days and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies though you offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings I will not accept them neither will I regard the peace offering of your fat Beast take thou away from me the noise of thy songs for I will not hear The Melody of the vials but let judgment run down as Waters and righteousness as a mighty stream first Samuel chapter 15. and verse 22. and Samuel said hath the Lord is great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry and in Revelations chapter 3 and verse 17. because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked the seed will manifest the fruit you're not going to get a different fruit than what the seed was you know we've just started our church Garden out here and so if I went out and planted tomatoes I can't expect cucumbers to grow on that vine I can't expect apples to show up I can't expect grapes to show up it was tomatoes unless somebody put the wrong seed in the package or mislabeled it if I planted tomatoes I'm gonna get tomatoes if I get something other than tomatoes then I know it wasn't a tomato seed that went into the ground because that's how it manifests the fruit at the end tells you what the seed was the fruit that is shown declares the seed at one point the plants may look so alike that you can't tell them apart but fruit at the end always tells you what it was at the beginning Matthew Chapter 5 and verse 45. that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and he sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust in Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 4. for it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh offon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receive the blessings from God but that which bear thorns and Briars is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak brother random tells a story about when he was first beginning to uh go into the the Pentecostal churches and he was he had beginning to see the gifts of the Spirit breaking out with the tongues and with the interpretation and in one of the meetings he went and he talked to two different individuals that wanted spoken in tongues another one had interpreted and he went and spoke to these two different ones and as he was talking with them he found that one of them was definitely a Christian man lived the life that that he said he did while the other one did not the other one was a hypocrite he lived however he wanted and brother Branham talks about the fact that he had a lot of confusion from that as he walked away going how can the spirit be falling on both of these men and manifesting this way when one has the life to back it up and one doesn't and he kept going back to uh to this scripture that I'm going to drop in as he tells the story and he said I read those words over again what we just read in Hebrews and when I did that same spirit of God came into the room and I beheld a vision I saw in the vision a man dressed in the purest white who went forth into a freshly plowed field and sowed grain it was a bright day and the sowing was done in the morning but late at night after the sower and white had gone a man in black cayman stealthily sowed some more seed amongst that which the man in White had sown the days went by the sun and the rain blessed the ground and one day there appeared the grain how fine it was but a day later appeared to tares the wheat and the tares grew together they partic of the same nourishment out of the same soil they drink in the same sun and rain and one day the skies turned to brass and the plants all began to droop and die I heard the wheat lift their heads and cry to God for rain the tares also lifted up their voices and pleaded for rain then the sky is darkened and the rain came and again the wheat now full of strength lifted up their voices and cried in adoration praise the Lord and to my wonderment I heard the revived Terrors also look up and say hallelujah then I knew the truth of the camp meeting the parable of the sower and the seed the sixth chapter of Hebrews and the evident manifestation of spiritual gifts in a mixed audience all become wonderfully clear the sower in white was the low or the so or in Black was the devil the world was the field the seeds were people elect and reprobates both partook of the same nourishment water and Sun both prayed both received help from God for he maketh his son and Reign to fall on both the Good and Evil and that they both had the same wonderful blessings and both had of the same wonderful manifestation there was still that one great difference they were of different seed we did everything that we could to prepare the the church Garden so that you wouldn't really have weeds coming up and yet you're still going to have weeds coming up that you have to deal with and the weeds and the plants that we've put in are getting the same nourishment out of the exact same soil we put down the exact same manure the exact same potting soil the exact same everything that you put into that garden plot both are getting the exact same nourishment they're both getting the exact same amount of sun both are getting the exact same amount of water they're feeding off the same things but that doesn't change what they manifest in the end it doesn't change the fruit that comes forth the seed is what manifests they're both fed from the same place they're both water from the same place they both receive the same sunlight but it goes back to what were they at the beginning where did they come from what was how did they originate what was the seed because that is going to be the fruit that comes forth that is going to be what's manifest now compare that with Matthew 5 24 again notice Jesus said the rain and the Sun comes upon the Earth and God sends it to prepare the food and the things for the people of the earth and the rain is sent for the food the herbs but the tares weeds being in the field receive the same thing the same rain that makes the wheat grow is the same rain that makes the weeds grow let's turn to Luke chapter 8. and starting at verse 4. and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parable A sower went out to sow a seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it and choked it other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit and hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he the half ears to hear Let Him hear and his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that seeing they might not see in hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of God those by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root for a while believing in time of Temptation Fall Away and they which fell among Thorns or they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life and bring no fruit to perfection but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience in Matthew chapter 12 and verse 33 it says either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit and we'll go to Galatians chapter 5. foreign this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit year not under the law but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanliness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variants emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revelings and such like of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another and being one another Paul writes and he tells us the fruit that we're going to be looking for he tells you this is the fruit that will show the seed that is on the inside are they going to be manifesting these fruits of the spirit are they going to be showing love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness temperance is this what's actually manifesting is this what's actually coming from the inside brother random talked about the fact that in every church you've got three kinds of Believers you've got the True Believers you've got the unbelievers you've got the make-believers and they all can look the same they can all blend in a little bit they can all show up to a point the same things but you begin to wait to see okay what's the fruit that's going to be manifesting what is going to be coming forth from their lives what's going to show the seed that's actually on the inside are they going to be able to keep walking forward with a god are they going to be able to keep going is their life going to be manifesting more and more of these fruits of the spirit as the seed is growing as the seed is manifesting in Ezekiel chapter 9 and verse 4 it says and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and the cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof this is always the verse that makes me question the most or makes me examine my life the most because all too often we begin to get to the point where we're used to everything going on you know we see the different articles talking about [Music] um sin in the nation sin around the world all these different things and will have conversations about it we'll sit around the table and we'll talk about how awful it is that this is going on or that's going on but when we go back to this can we say that we are spending time sighing and crying before the Lord over the Abominations that are taking place is this the fruit that we're manifesting are we entering that far into it where we're going no this is not my home I'm Desiring for a place on the other side or have we become so accustomed to it that as long as it hasn't entered my own little house or my own little church or my own little area it's okay when I look at my own life and I'm looking at the fruit I have to end up praying going Lord I need help to get this place is this the one I'm not trying to preach in any of you this is and me as much as anyone to go Lord I need to be at the plate where it's so desperate in my heart that when I see the new article come out about this law being passed or this going on or that going on that it's not just a well I knew it was going to keep getting worse but instead it's where you're driven to your knees going Lord this can't be going on this isn't right how can you stand to let things continue when this is going on around the Earth when this is going on around the nation when this is going around around my state when this is going on around my city when this is going on around my neighborhood when it's going on around you can keep taking it as tight or as big as you want but how much is it that we've become used to it and as long as it's not directly affecting us I can read the article newspaper set the newspaper decide and not think of it again I can keep walking away am I manifesting all the fruit that I'm supposed to I didn't grab the scripture but the the scripture that talks about that if a tree is not producing fruit they'll take it and beat the roots to see if that'll get the the fruit to come and if if that doesn't do it if beating the roots and then putting the fertilizer into anything if it doesn't bring forth fruit at that point then we'll chop it down if I'm not manifesting all the fruits if I'm not able to look at things and go yes I'm part of that group that I'm sighing and crying when I look at the evil around me maybe there's some beatings in my future to try to get that fruit to manifest to try to get us that place and maybe if I'm truly sincere about it maybe that's what I have to be asking for going Lord I if it means beating crate fertilizing feeding me trying to get me to grow to a new state yes Lord this is what I need because this is the fruit that you're asking for this is the fruit that you're holding up it goes back all the way from the beginning of what was the fruit that was manifesting when we go back to original sacrifice and now today what are the fruits that we're supposed to be manifesting what are we supposed to be showing up to those around are we becoming so used to our environment that our fruits are not showing the way they should if someone is looking at our lives can they tell the seed that was on the inside can they tell what the beginning is or have we not grown far enough for the fruits to truly manifest as the musicians come Luke chapter 6 and verse 43. for a good tree bringeth forth not corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit for every tree is known by his own fruit for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a Bramble Bush gather they grapes a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh God's place to seed in each one of us but that seed has to manifest the fruits have to begin to come forth the fruits are what lets you know what the seed is the fruits are what confirm what the seed is yes there are people that study botany that they can take a seed and they can look at just the seed and tell you this is the seed for this item there are a few things that maybe I could look at and go yeah that's an apple seed I know what that is that's this kind of seed most seeds you could put them in front of me and I have no idea but when they start to grow and they start to manifest it I can look hey that was a rose bush seed that one was a tomato plant seed that one was a this that one was a that because now there's fruits and I recognize the fruits God is calling us to manifest fruits he's calling us manifest the fruits of the spirit he's calling us to be seen of the world around to be living a life that people can recognize to be manifesting fruits that people can look at and go that's different that's not the Briars and brambles that we're used to seeing all around the world that's actually some wheat beginning to grow up that's actually some take your pick of what plants you want to identify with we'll stick with wheat because that's the type but that is the wheat well everything else I can see there brambles their tears their weeds of every type but look there's some weed that's there's actually some wheat that's growing up and it's maturing it's maturing Under The Sun It's maturing under the word and it just keeps getting more and more different where it went from the stage where they could be right beside each other and almost unrecognizable the difference the closer and closer it gets to harvest the more and more different they look the more and more they stand out the more and more the fruit stands out is this is not tares this is not just some random seed that was sown this is the crop that we're here to harvest this is what we're supposed to be manifesting so what we're supposed to manifest in our worship it's supposed to what we're supposed to manifest in our attitude when we're coming to the house of God and our attitude as we're out at the workplace and the way that we respond to each other way that we think of our brothers and sisters the way that we care for them and pray for them the way that we think about the evil that's going on around us all of those are the fruits that are supposed to be manifesting [Music] each one of you has to examine your own life for those fruits that's not my job to check up on you I have to do that for myself I'm the one that I have to keep taking my life back to that verse and going am I at the point where I'm sighing and crying am I at the point where I'm manifesting the love the joy the peace the long suffering am I at the point where I am living this and I can say yes those fruits are showing like they're supposed to Lord Jesus we come before you and Lord I know this has been chopped up and and all over the place Lord this is just what you've had me thinking about for the last little while Lord and Lord I pray that something that was said would would sink into each heart here Lord that they would be able to walk away with just that little the little nugget that was meant for them Lord Lord if there was anything that I that I said wrong Lord Jesus I pray that you would forgive me of it Lord Jesus if there was anything that that I missed Lord I pray that you would take control and that you would Minister to to the heart through your Holy Spirit Lord to give them what it was that I didn't say Lord Jesus Lord when we look at the the world around us we know that time can't be going much longer Lord and we have to be manifesting the fruits Lord we have to be showing the fruits that point back to the seed that was placed there at the beginning Lord if I'm not manifesting the right things Lord then Lord do the work that's needed prune what needs to be pruned away Lord [Music] fertilize beat the roots whatever is needed Lord that that fruit would begin to manifest Lord Jesus Lord we thank you we thank you
