Lancaster amen is is uh we're going to be dedicating this baby to the Lord and um uh this is this is a real I love dedicating babies back to the Lord you say um now I I remember when I was a kid and I was I I was I was 19 when I came to paon and I I was uh I I was baptizing I'm telling you what we I was we we had us a sister Carol you remember we we had a um we we had had a little um Bible studies there at the AA Center here in town and um and so we we started out um uh talking you know preaching to the drunks and drug addicts and and uh well we outgrew the place and so we needed a church so there was an old abandoned church building uh just right over here on Parks uh Street and and it was an Old Church of Christ building and uh I mean the walls were separating and and uh uh it it was in pretty rough shape and sister Carol she would come down there every day trying to clean that place up we were still having Church you know we started and so she'd be down there scrubbing floors and just just doing everything trying to make the place presentable but we had a we in that in that uh um uh in the platform there you could raise up the platform and there was a baptistry down low and um uh you you get and it was oh it was it was it was a piece of work and uh but we would fill that thing up and and uh we would I I'd baptize I mean we were baptizing people in the name of the Lord just uh you know um we were getting them off the streets and put and baptizing them in the water so one service I I was baptizing and uh uh bringing them in oh my it was just wonderful service and then sister Carol you'll remember this somebody somebody just immediately put this baby in my hands and said baptize it now I had all of these people looking at me they're all happy and I've got this little baby here in my hands and um and I'm 19 years old I don't have no one to talk to I don't have an elder to ask I don't know what to do and I said well listen well if I'm going to baptize this baby I'm dunking it all the way down and and they all looked at each other and said well whatever you've got to do and um I don't look at me like that it was wrong amen but I was 19 years old and um I I said all right I took this baby put my finger over its nose and just brought that under the water back out and it it came out of screaming and and well we don't do you that wasn't scriptural you're not supposed to baptize babies it's funny you look back in those those old back over your life and how you learn and that's right and I'm I'm thankful that God has Grace for for our mistakes but I will tell you I will tell you dedicating babies to the Lord is scriptural giving these babies to the Lord are very is very important part of our life and so as we I'm I'm just going to read and and we'll let the musicians continue to play there but I I want to read a a place out of the the the the Old Testament and then one in the New Testament but here in in 1 Samuel 1 and [Music] 24 and uh and when she had this is this is Hannah bringing Samuel uh to the Tabernacle the temple and when she had weaned him and took him up with her with three Bullocks and one eal of flour and a bottle of wine and brought him into the house of the Lord in Shiloh and the child was young and they slew a bullet and brought the child to Eli and she said oh my Lord as thy soul liveth my Lord I am the woman that stood by thee here praying unto the Lord for this child I prayed and the Lord ha given me my petition which I asked of him therefore also I have lent him to the Lord as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord and He worshiped the Lord there I'd also like to look here in the Book of Luke and um Luke the 18th chapter in the 13th verse so this was the child that Hannah had prayed for and and now she's giving this child back to the Lord and it was so that um let's see I am in the wrong I'm in the wrong place here oh my praise the Lord where they brought the children to [Music] Jesus let's see Matthew L Luke I'm in the oh I'm sorry that's that's my problem I'm in the wrong place sorry amen I did notice I was in there okay praise the Lord yeah and they brought unto him Luke 1815 they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them and when his disciples saw it they re rebuked him but Jesus called them unto him and said suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein and so we can see how that Jesus blessed these Bab babies and you can bring you can bring your child up the Lancaster family if y'all want to want to come up but giving our children to the Lord and dedicating them to the Lord is is um is such a precious thing and I want to tell you this this young and is a very precious baby oh isn't she's so beautiful look at that she is just beautiful we look at at our at at these Little Miracles I tell you they're they're just you look at their hands and and and you look at all of the features and what a miracle these these babies are and to have our mom and dad here to want to dedicate them to the Lord this baby to the Lord is such a is such a blessing I was thinking yesterday as we were out out here gathered here at the uh uh doing fundraisers and and we were also witnessing to the different ones as they come in and and um to see our children out playing and and and being a part of what's going on I thought you know the children don't know what's happening but they they are they're being taught something here and I I I I I'm so thankful for Mam and daddies that have given their lives for the kingdom of God I say God bless all of you m and daddies I want us to come and I I want or I want us to just stand if we would and let's let's pray for this child that little Juniper should the Lord Terry that the Lord would bless her and use her with such wonderful gifts father as I stand here with brother Harry and our our sister Stephanie Lord dedicating Juniper and Lancaster to you Lord visiting with them and watching them Lord as they are raising their children Lord even homeschooling their children Lord and teaching them the ways of the Lord their heart Lord they love their family and Lord we thank you for this blessing that you have given them through little Juniper I pray Lord that you would place your hands upon her I ask God that you would place a protection around her Lord and that you would keep her healthy Lord that you would as she grows Lord that she would always be strong and and healthy and Lord I'm asking spiritually that you would keep her from the evil of this world Lord and how that Satan would love to sift our children but God we're asking as we give her back to you as you've only loaned her to us Lord as we give her back to you Lord that you would keep her and that you would teach her with that inside teacher and that your blessings would be upon her Lord I pray that you would give her mom and dad wisdom and teaching her and may they always Lord look to you and in the tough times when they don't have the answers God I'm asking that you will give them the answers for her in the times Lord where she's going to need some prayer and encouragement I pray father that you would give them the words and that you would always hear Mom and Dad Lord when they call upon your name and that you will always be there for Juniper oh God I pray blessings upon the Lancaster family ask that your blessings would be upon all the children that you would bless them Lord as they labor in your kingdom father we thank you thank you for this blessing in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen I want to give her a kiss hallelujah oh she didn't like that Hallelujah Hallelujah God richly bless you all amen glory to God isn't that just wonderful amen amen praise the Lord and um we're we're so we're so blessed and I tell you what amen I don't care I don't care uh what Satan tries to do when we put that blood man around our children I believe that God Honors that amen do you believe that here today amen praise the Lord praise the Lord let's look here in the Book of Ecclesiastes the third chapter want to say that we really appreciate brother Joe and and and all of the team that had came out to work on that fundraiser and what a blessing um amen there just we had such a wonderful turnout from the community and it's just it was so good and and um uh uh we got to witness uh to to some people that we've known for a while and and even got to come in and show um our friends from Camp Crossway uh had had came in and we got to visit with them a long time and and uh got to uh share a little bit of of of uh um what what the cloud meant and and the pillar of fire and and able to express so um just just wonderful we're just looking for wonderful results and I want to tell you that those that meet was some of the what was the best that those guys have ever done amen that was just awesome and uh and so uh I know that everyone's labor I know the Lord will will bless you for that and um brother brandom says that when you when the Lord saves you he says find you a church find you a pastor and then he says and work with everything you have to make that church go forward and we're so thankful for that amen Ecclesiastes 3 and 1 it says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time To mour a time to dance a time to Cast Away Stones a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace a time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to lose a time to keep a time to Cast Away a time to Ren a time to seow a time to keep silence a time to speak a time to love a time to hate a time of War a time of peace what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he labor Earth I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in their hearts so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end for I thought here this morning I would like to take a Time for every purpose let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for the many blessings that you have given us Lord I I can't express enough what it is meant these last couple days getting to Fellowship around your with your bride here in this uh this last weekend Lord Lord and it's just been a blessing to just rub shoulders and to Lord to be in one another's company and to work together in unity Lord for a common goal and cause and we're thankful that we have been able to witness Lord and to show your love to this community father we thank you for allowing us to do that now Lord we come and we want to give glory to you on this Resurrection Sunday Lord and what it means to us Lord is Lord it means so much now father I'm asking that you would take these few words that I would say today and that you would Lord make them real to our hearts father may I only say what you would have us to say and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here today amen there's a time for every purpose I also uh was thinking there in the book of Ephesians the the first chapter and and um there in would start there at the fourth verse according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now that's his choosing that's what he's ordained having predestinated us that's amen that's before planned that's that's to said into motion unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of GL of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood and the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us sir in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will yes sir can you say Amen now as we begin to think about this time God's got a time for every purpose everything that he has he has predestinated and I do believe in predestination I do believe God's got a plan I believe that plan was spoke through the spoken word and there are seasons there are times that God Amen has already got appointed for that purpose amen and I think finding our place in the scripture is a must because if we don't find Our Place in scripture then then we we have no place to really rest our faith we we rest upon we we we now many are resting upon opinions many are resting on well I see it this way but it's not really a grounded scriptural amen foundation and the prophet has has has told us that that that uh uh angel that came from the bottomless pit he he explained that it was amen belief systems without a Biblical Foundation it was someone something that they were standing to and holding to but really had no biblical Foundation to it at all and so amen so the prophet would say the bride must make sure that whatever we are basing our belief upon it's got to be scriptural therefore we there's there's the the mountain that you want to choose to die on there's what you want to stand and put out there amen you've got to have a resting place for your faith and it must amen our belief should be the word of the Lord now many of us go from camp meeting to camp meeting and I amen we love camp meetings and but many people go from preacher to preacher camp meeting to camp meeting Good Feeling to Good Feeling and amen and uh many many are are going looking for a feeling or going and looking for a uh a a uh you know to to know that they've got the holy ghost or amen or or even to get prophesied over amen and while there's definitely nothing wrong with with prophecy and there's definitely nothing wrong with with with with meetings and things of that nature amen but yet the position of the believer can only be found in the word of God Amen and there's there's not a special preacher that can give you that Foundation there's not a pastor that can give you that Foundation there's not one of the nine spiritual gifts that can give you that Foundation your foundation must be built upon the word of God and the word of God Alone yes sir amen because preachers are going to come and go gifts they can fail we can have all of these things there's only one thing that will never pass away Heavens will pass away Earth will pass away but the word of God cannot pass away therefore we put our our absolute in the word of God oh glory to the Lamb of God I'm glad that I can point you this morning to an absolute that will never ever change amen though cultures change and amen and though everything else around us changed it does not matter God's word cannot change and we stand solidly upon those can you say amen amen the Holy Spirit baptizes you into the body of Believers amen places you where you can you you can thrive in in the kingdom of God Amen and and and the fivefold ministry there is to equip you and bring you into to your position in in those in in through the word of God Amen you know there in Ephesians 4:16 it says from whom the whole body fitly uh joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so so we find that God places Us in we are baptized into that body amen and there we can we can grow together we work together we manifest the presence of God Amen as human beings amen and that that doesn't mean we're going around speaking in tongues to each other all the time and we're amen laying hands on each other all the time that means that we are amen we are a unified body of Believers amen promoting the kingdom of God and we are we are putting our shoulders to the wheels we are standing in the Gap amen we are we are there for one another amen and we are all United with one common cause and that's the word of God can you say Amen now when I when I was a when I you know I was raised in Pentecost and so we we were we were uh uh you know chasing gifted men everywhere amen we were looking for someone to prophesy over us amen and and and we did and amen we we were constantly needing a word from the Lord we we would go to this Gifted Man or we would have that Gifted Man I remember we would have gifted men in in the church that could prophesy and amen and and and see visions and things and and we would oh my amen I'd sit on the front row and just praying and praying and praying that they would call me out amen and I I I I even remember I even remember just sitting outside our pastor's office amen I had my own key as a kid and amen would come into the church and I I just sat outside there amen and and and and just you know on the on the Pew and just asking God cause the preacher to to say something I I need to hear something from my pastor and amen and the Lord would bless that the Lord would bless that I'd come to church amen the next service and amen and and and and our pastor would call would would call my name and say listen amen and and would and would tell me what I was thinking and that was a wonderful thing amen God heard my prayer God callused that man to call me but you see that only lasted for a week and then I was calling to the Lord again I needed another word from the Lord but when I came into the message I found out I God's got a very specific word for me it was right here God's word God's Got A Time God's got a place God has ordained and when I found that I am not just somebody that's that's that's just you know uh randomly finding scriptures to read I found out that I am the scripture for this day then it took everything else away whether someone amen said good words over me or whether they didn't say good words over me I was established in present day truth and there was nothing that could ever take me away from that well that's the kind of believer that God is looking for well come on Church amen the trials are going to come devils are going to come the enemy's going to fight us but when you've got a revelation of who you are and what you are there is nothing that can ever separate you from that call that gift can you say amen amen now that this day is calling for men and women to step up to their position this day is calling amen this just want you turn to your neighbor and say this day is calling for you to step up into your position amen now now the three-fold purpose of Christ amen the threefold purpose of God remember God in Christ amen and and and then uh Christ having preeminence all that was in Christ is now in you Christ having preeminence is that right taking us back to Eden amen so it can all be summed up in these words here where the Apostle Paul Paul says in bringing many sons unto Glory so God's got a specific purpose not for me to set in a Pew not for this this is not Christianity Christianity is a body of Believers Amen in acting act amen as a unified group together here on Earth manifesting amen his glory to those all around us amen God's not called us to be separate God's called us as a body together well that makes me want to shout I'm I I'm part of something that is bigger than than me can you say amen amen now now I I want to say that the that the promises of God are on condition these promises amen now you say now I thought I thought the the promises of God were without condition no the promises of God are on condition they've got to be in the right season they have got to be to the right person there's got to be you can't just come out and say Amen well I believe it well Noah couldn't amen couldn't come in and preach the message of of Moses Moses can't come and preach the message of Amen of Abel you've got to be in your season you've got to know who you are where you are and why you are there now brother Bram would say there's three things that you must not do you must not misinterpret the scripture you must not misplace the word you must not dislocate the word amen is that right amen now we know that God has a master plan he's got a plan that he is that he is working in this day now it it's more than just a plan of Amen today I I want to tell you amen you're not the only one that that has that that has been or ordained you're not the only one that that God has been interested in God's been working this plan for 6,000 years this plan has been going on Amen for thousands and thousands and thousands of years amen we simply amen we're blessed to be in the finality of it we are here at the very end we're here Amen in the finality of Redemption where God is going to call you and me into a Rapture well glory to God Amen I'm thankful for what God done amen uh 2,000 years ago I'm thankful for what God done in the first age I'm glad God I'm thankful for what God done in the fifth age but I'm in the age and I'm expecting a specific promise to be be fulfilled in my generation so it requires me to make sure that I'm lined up with what God is doing in this day and then the promises well glory to God Amen now the cogs of God's prophetic will are very slow amen they they grind very slowly but they grind very surely you say well I've been praying and I've been praying and I've been praying and nothing's happening I've been waiting and I've been waiting and I've been waiting and nothing's happening those cogs are turning yeah those prophetic wheel of God is turning God is hearing every prayer God is hearing you see you see but but but but brother wend let let me Hallelujah if you are the predestinated people for this season even your desires are placed there by God you're Desiring a Rapture you are Desiring a higher walk you are desire because this is the season and the seeds are already placed in Your Heart by predestination you're Desiring amen you're Desiring a higher walk than what than what Luther had than what Wesley had than what 1906 had you are Desiring a walk that is even greater than those that were before you Hallelujah because it's your season yeah you see Luther they had went for thousand the Catholic church had had celebrated the Thousand-Year Millennial Reign claiming that Christ was reigning on Earth through the Catholic Church they went 1,000 nearly 1,000 years ruling the world through the Kings and the monarchs Hallelujah but there was something that was rising up in the predestinated seat of God amen amen hus stood up and says I want to tell you they were fixing to kill him amen and he stood up under prophetic word and says you might be able to you you might be able to burn this Goose I believe that's the the prophecy was there you might be able to burn this Goose but in 100 years there will rise a mind that you will not be able to kill oh oh they were mad they were mad they man they killed him exactly 100 years later here come Martin Luther and Martin Luther there was he couldn't be satisfied he was a priest in the Catholic church trying to be happy trying to amen there he was trying to be a good monk he was trying to be a good amen and and there he is uh uh uh you know trying to earn his salvation amen and so his high high up authorities would say you need to try this and you need to do this and finally they sent him to Rome and said you need to do this and when you get up to this step and you've got to kiss this cross so many times and you got to do this and and and he would beat his back until it was Bloody amen there his knees were bloody as he's crawling trying to earn a Salvation and when he got to a certain place he had stopped and fixing a kiss across and then all of a sudden the scripture came to him and says the just shall live by faith all of a sudden A New World opened up into him he jumped up and says I am saved by the grace of God and that man single-handedly started a revolution amen the Reformation took place why there was a seat on the inside that was called calling out for the word of God to be fulfilled in that day through him the pope didn't know nothing about it others didn't know nothing about it but there was something that was burning on the inside of him saying I've got to know it I've got to know it and when the word begin to make its me itself real in that season in the right time in the right hour the word sprung up in his heart and we understand what what took place the Reformation began worldwide what was it it was the word of God coming in its season at its designated time some of us are praying for our children maybe they're out in the world I just want to tell you there's a designated season there's a designated time you keep on praying You Keep On Believing but God knows the time clock and when that time clock strikes 12 amen it doesn't matter it's not going to happen a minute before 12 and it ain't going to happen a minute after 12 God's got a season do you believe that God's got a time that makes me feel that makes me want to shout that's right amen Abraham Abraham went for for years amen waiting on that child waiting on that child then a lot had already given up and this one had already given up but but there and and Abraham's family Hallelujah but here he waited amen and then at the decreed season at the decreed time the son of man came Prophet God came and discerned the the heart amen of uh right before the destruction of Sodom in fact when he come in here come the Three Angels to him amen they were they were clothed in flesh and and there he says my Lord and then God says how can I keep anything from Abraham seeing that he is my friend and seeing that he is going to be the ruler of the earth and he tells them he says Sodom is fixing to be to to to be destroyed amen and and and Abraham even tried Amen to change God's mind he says oh that can't happen Lots down there in Sodom we cannot do that you amen if if there's if there's 50 in the city amen will you spare them if there's 30 in the city will you spare them and finally he comes back and says they're not there they're not there you see the plan of God will come to pass but he came to Abraham because Abraham had some Abraham had some family down there that he was interceding for that's right did you know that brother brandham says Amen brother brother Bram says that that that you are going that the elect the adopted sons of God are are going to go to the end of the road after the after their family after those that are lost well praise the Lord he says just as Abraham went to the end of the road after lot so will the adopted sons of God go to the end of the road why because you are destined for this Hallelujah well can you say Amen so here then he turns his attention to Abraham he says Abraham you've been waiting for a long time but The Season's coming seasons are changing something's fixing to take place and he tells Abraham amen he says according to the time of life you Sarah is going to have that shot now now now now now now now get this because Sarah had in her unbelief had already got Abraham to marry her the her maid amen they had tried different ways because they just did she didn't think it was going to happen but yet God had already planned it God had already spoken it was already decreed it was already set into motion but it could not come to pass until the appointed predestinated time of God amen well I feel a I I feel a purpose I feel I know God's called me but then brother Wendell I've not heard anything else there will be a specific time well glory to God did you know that the Israelite would be cut off from the people if he did not Worship the Lord at the designated time amen okay you see if they did not bring that offering to to uh to Jerusalem at that offering to the Lord in his appointed season the scripture says that he would be cut off from the people and he would have to bear his sin now think about that it was his responsibility to identify that season and to Worship the Lord in that season okay amen now I I'm I I I I'm talking about us in our personal walk but I I I I my my main focus this morning that I'm wanting us to see is the church as a whole that we are living in a specific time a specific season this is a glorious season that we're living in amen am I doing all right here this morning many many have tried to help god with his plan many have tried not saying you know claiming this is the way that God's going to fulfill his plan you know Sarah and and and say well this is the way it's got to happen or this is the way it's got to happen we must believe it this way or or that way and we get so many going every which direction but God's got his word god decreed it and God will fulfill it in his exact [Applause] time you can prophesy it and you can pray it and you can fast it and you can do everything else nothing's going to hurry the time clock of God if God's got you in a valley right now and you're going to be in that Valley till God brings you out of that Valley come on come on we are reliant upon the ways of God and God's looking for men and women who are going to trust him that's right trust him though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me well glory to God Amen now brother Brandon would say the main thing is if we can find where God's word belongs in our life God sets times and time limits and then it works all to that same many of them before the coming of the Lord Jesus many they they were there was many uh false things rised up and said this is the Messiah and this is and many false things that taken place according to the scpt scripture just before the coming of the Lord Jesus you see people try to do it within themselves they try to make God's word fit in their program and but you but but that you got it vice versa you've got to fit in God's program we don't want God hallelujah we're we're we're we're amen today we've got this charismatic move everything is is God is answering your whim every whim that you've got God got to respond to your wh God ain't got to respond to nothing to you God is God God's got a purpose God's got a plan and you had better find that plan because he's working everything according to that plan not according to your whim not according to what you want he's got the plan can you say Amen so we must be careful to follow the scripture do you see where we fit in because I promise just as The Seven Ages were found in the word and just as the prophet of Malachi 4 was found in the word yeah and just as Jesus was found in the word so are you found in the word you are found in the written word come on Church you're not here by accident you are here because God built you designed you predestinated you and he's put you here to fit in his plan Hallelujah am I doing is this okay y'all think I should uh sorry guys having a problem with this thing today Hallelujah hallu glory to God Amen someone shout hallelujah hallelujah he's got a purpose I'm not here for my own I'm here for his purpose somebody say turn your neighbor and say you're not here for your own purpose he's got a purpose now brother Brandon would talk to us amen about the four stages of the wheat plant amen and he would say that it was a as a type of the church coming out of the Dark Ages and one of the Mysteries that was to be unveiled in this day was the mystery of the church there were all the Mysteries and it says amen that there that that the church was a mystery that had to be unveiled in this time in this time and when the mystery would be unveiled it would unveil certain times certain seasons amen certain timelines it would show us when the when the when the H the Mysteries were unscrambled when when when everything that was all in symbol form was uh uh made real and unveiled before us we would find that there are seven Church ages and that there were seven uh Messengers to those Church ages and there was a specific time for each one of those ages right amen that's that's what the scripture had told us that's what we found in this day but the scripture says that there in Revelations the 10th chapter in the first verse behold I I I I I that there was another angel that appeared amen and had a rainbow over him and amen came clothed with a cloud and he come with a book Hallelujah that was once sealed up that was once that was once closed and now the scripture says he comes with an open book amen and in that day with the open book would be a very specific time it would do a very specific thing for it says time shall be no longer it says that there would come a time when the Thunders would be uttered amen and the Seven Thunders would be in a amen would be unscrambled because down in the in in Revelations 10 and 7 it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God concerning the church would be finished it's a specific time it couldn't be done in the second age or the third age or the fifth age it couldn't be done at the beginning of the seventh age it had to come according to God's timeline you realize that before brother brandom came did you realize that our Prophet was not the first one to say Amen that he was Elijah okay Alexander dwe built an entire built an entire complex amen and he was the Elijah that's right go look up Alexander Dowry great man of God great gift of healing wonderful had many followers you see but it was not the season it was not the time and it was not the person therefore it ended up it ended up in defeat it didn't mean that the word wasn't going to happen it didn't mean that the season wasn't coming it simply meant there was somebody trying to make it happen and it was not time but in the days of the voice when that Mighty Angel comes down in a cloud when that Mighty Angel come and he declares himself to the whole world then you know this is the season oh do you love him here this morning so I'm not following something that I'm thinking no this is something that God has come down to vindicate in our generation to say hey it's your time it's your season worship here amen now the prophet would tell us he would take the scripture that Jesus says except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone but if if it die it shall come up and bring forth much fruit and we understand that there was the blade and there was the tassel amen and then there was the Shu and then there was the seed within the Shu amen now am am I doing okay here this morning amen there was those things that were there that was going to come in at seas and there's no way that you're going to put something in the ground and then come up with a shock you couldn't you couldn't do that you could not put it in the ground and come up with a steel you've got to come if you put it in the ground and it dies there's got to be a blade that begins to come up a leaf that comes up that's the predestinated season that doesn't mean that that season wasn't the right season that doesn't mean that that season was not the plant that does not that doesn't mean that the season that you're in right now in your growth with God Amen maybe maybe you don't look nothing like the seed maybe you don't look nothing like this up here maybe you're down here but it doesn't matter you're part of the plant in your walk with God now this here is talking about the def the the the ages but you and I in our personal Walks With God we're all at many different stages amen some of us are in justification some of us are in sanctification amen some of us some of us still need amen some sanctifying some of us still need some purging eating of that book amen purging out our own ways our own thinking our own come come on now it says eat that book it's going to be sweet here but it's going to be woo rough in the belly that means you got some stuff on the inside of you that needs to be coming out can you say Amen you've got to be but but thank God for it because God gave you the open book God gave you the Revelation in this season and God is glorifying himself in the bride in this season this season came have your opinions right this season can't have what Mama thinks this season can't have what Daddy thinks this season has come through the Vindicated word of Malachi 4 and you've got to purge your old thinking your own ways the old leav and come in to the revealed word can you say Amen you see the leaf identified the season and because the seed was in the ground it was going it was craving the seed couldn't stop amen with a with a with the blade the seed couldn't stop with a stock amen because it was predestinated for seeds it was predestinated to declare who it was Hallelujah and in your walk I just want to tell you right now maybe you're maybe you're thinking oh I don't look like nothing like the other wheat plant I don't look nothing like the seed I don't look oh but what do you have on the inside of you why is that that cry on the inside of you that is screaming out I want to be like my daddy I want to be what he ordained me to be amen why because you've got the seed on the inside of you and you've got to come out in your season and your time just keep on growing Hallelujah you don't want to remain in the blade if the life is in the tassel come on you say well what God done for me I'm ahhh if you want to keep walking with God you're going to have to keep on going yesterday's experience is okay but now God is calling you on up into the tassel Hallelujah you preachers know this when you look you can look back at some of your sermons that you preached 10 years ago you look at it and there's no life in it you know you just it was what God was dealing with you back then he would anoint that back then but God's not giving canned sermons to preachers today he's giving a real real a reality of himself the life of God is in this part of the plant can you say that it's God is dealing with us calling us a p you see maturity is so incredible because God's calling you to maturity that's good you can sit there in a church for a hundred years and not be mature that's God's calling us come up hallelujah amen he's calling us come up and I say the time the season he man is here oh glory to God brother Brandon would say he says God's got a time for all things he's he's got a time that he has we plant corn we got a time that we plant corn then at that time we and then uh then at at the time we harvest corn spring rains come the droughts come through the summer the fall rains and the the the Snows you just can't say I plant my wheat today and tomorrow and go out and harvest it God's got times someone say times for a season he has seasons for his word that's what God is doing oh I I I just want to just keep driving it home right now he me he's got seasons for his word he's got seasons for your life he's got Seasons you're saying does he hear me does he care does he understand I don't care what season you're in you're part of the plant amen now he would say the Sun comes across and ripens the grain it cannot ripen it all at once as it goes on maturing it's constantly ripening until it comes to a full ear and so it is today with the church it started in its infancy back in the Dark Ages where it was under the ground and it's grown now into maturity and now and we can see it perfectly how that God through nature always can you say amen hallelujah are y'all are y'all catching what I'm saying so the church if you look there in where you are today and if the season is calling for maturity you don't want to stay in the shock yeah because when the season of the word came the Shu enjoyed Pentecost enjoyed brother brandom amen they they they they they they ran him across the world seven times but when the word begin to come in a in a in a more personal way to them then all of a sudden they said no no I can't do that the life was going to continue and the shuck was going to have to pull back come on that was that that was that Pentecostal amen ideology that mama said and daddy said and grandma said and the preacher says and I think and you think and no it's the word manifesting itself living itself can you say am man it's the life yes you're a part of the plant you're living you're thriving you we there is a well uh organized group there you go that the Holy Spirit has put together he's put it together can you say amen amen yes now I hope this is okay here this morning now brother Brandon would say when he would ask he would say now when when that there there's got to be a changing of Seasons there's got to be a changing of times and he says according to scripture we can find those changing of times if we'll just be willing to follow Oh Glory to God he man brother Brandon would say an indictment he'd say now notice how appropriate was now showing that that Jerusalem was ceasing when it was in effect until that hour the blood of the Lamb was all right until that day but now at the crucifixion it changes the old the old system is done there was a new one the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they were condemning and doing the very thing there that they had to do that's right God be blessed for seeing this wonderful Heavenly light in this last day because the church is is doing the same thing today until the hour that organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing Christ word he says from then on comes the word and the word only oh now the denominations were all built around an opinion good opinions wonderful opinions but brother Bram says those things separated Brotherhood he says it's SE denominational ISM separates Brotherhood separates but he says but from then on comes the word it's a word bride in a bride time Bride season word coming we are now focusing on the main thing and that is Christ his word can you say amen amen it don't matter whether I'm waking up on a on a on a on a good day or bad day it doesn't matter whether I've got I've got prophecy coming to me saying this or that it don't matter whether amen this happens or that happens what matters is is the word has come in this day God has Vindicated that and I refuse to go any other way well according to my opinions I refuse to do anything contrary to the revealed word of the hour God let me let me be the life in this final day let this be the resurrection time in me he says it comes the word and the word only from the old Pascal lamb that's passed away and the Christ become our lamb at the day of crucifixion and the day that the denomination crucified the word of God attempted a Creed in the stad of the word that's the day the word will come into full effect that's just been recently so what's brother BR doing he is pointing us now he's he's putting us right there showing the season where it changed from the shu to the life to the seed can you say Amen this bright age is far more than saying uh or you know just a saying well we're in the bride age or we're in adoption age or we're in it's a living reality it's the time where the bride is coming to maturity it's the time where the bride is is is no she's she's no longer she's no longer moved by all of the No No the little the the the little the the little pesky uh place of the forest amen the little chipmunks just doesn't bother the eagle anymore amen the eagle sitting there amen with the wings fluttering those wings we're going to fly on to the sky and the little the the little the little policeman of the brother brand called the policeman of the of the forest he just going to sit there yapping and yapping and yapping we've got our goal we've got our promise we are looking we're looking to that it's causing consecration it's causing dedication it's causing brotherly love it's causing the presence of God we're not going from revival to Revival oh I was moved here and now here I'm back to discourage it must be brother W's fault must be that one's fault it must be this one's fault no good Lord no this is maturity time where we can look to that word and say I look to you I follow you I stand for that freedom can you say Amen you want to know what causes the bride life or the bright time or the bright age it's when the very life that was once here and that was once here and that was once here and that was once here it's now up here living in you the word of the book of Acts is living in you amen can you say Amen so today and I'm going too slow here I'm only on my sixth page amen the the grand scream of scheme of redemption today has been unveiled it's in full picture we in the 6,000th year of the earth yes sir we know the seventh is the day of rest that's the Millennium we know are fixing to change the book is unveiled the seventh angel has come we are standing here today at a very incredible position Lord there was a time for every purpose and this purpose is resurrection this is the the finality this is the rapture this is the season the age that we're living in is Brotherly Love Brotherly Love Is the at the very top of the pyramid he says only in Brotherly Love Can there be a honing of the pyramid it could not be honed any other way it had to come to that brotherly love to where it could be so honed that the Capstone charity can rest upon it us yes it's right there where it is coming God is honing a church bringing bringing us into that place of authority as the prophet would say you believe in dispensations the Bible said so in the dispensation of the fullness of time what is the fullness of time there's been a dispensation well there there was a dispensation of the Mosaic law there was a dis ation of John the Baptist there was a dispensation of Christ there was a dispensation of church organization there was a dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit now the dispensation of adoption what the world's waiting and groaning when the fullness of times comes when the dispensation of the fullness of time what is the fullness of time when the dead Rises when the sick ceases sickness ceases when all the Earth ceases to grown the fullness of the dispensation of time well glory to God Amen what is the dispensation of the fullness of time it's the adoption season when a son comes of age it's that point where full adoption comes how many knows what full adoption is anyone anyone know what full adoption is according to scripture amen the Apostle Paul says the whole earth is groaning longing for the Manifest St ations of the Son of God waiting for the adoption to with the changing of these bodies full adoption is coming God's done something in your soul but now the adop we are waiting for the time where there is no sickness there is no pain there is no mind battles there is no discouragement there is nothing that we are living in that day God is preparing this people for that hour hi I just want to say hallelujah someone says oh well there's a lot of work I got to work on myself I got to work on myself you don't have to work on nothing just follow the life it's all by Grace it's all divine grace the church will never do it and if you're not in the life of the plant you will never do it but if you're baptized into the body the body of Jesus Christ placed in there by the Holy Spirit the life is there just let it live just let it live it's just automatically going to push past the Shu it's going to automatically push past the doubt it's going to automatically push and our desire is God give me more word give me more word give me more work keep me coming keep me going let me come let me oh come on Church you're not you're not you're not striving and crying and begging and say I don't know if I'll ever be you'll never be if you're not in the plant but if you're in that plant you're going to come up you'll never be if you're not in that plant but if you're in that plant there Hallelujah this plant is not going to have to be baby this plan is not going to have to have pesticide sprayed on it this plan ain't going to oh I don't know if you're going to make it no God's already given it the orders we're going to be a church it's going to be a powerful church it's going to be a predestinated church and there there's nothing the devil can do we're in that appointed time to where the dead is fixing to rise all of the Dead that died in Christ for the last seven ages is fixing to rise and those which are alive and remain shall be caught up together won't you punch your neighbor and say this a lot better than your eyeballs are saying hallelujah amen they are rising can you say Amen yes sir the dispensation amen dispensation of the fullness of time it's not it's not work-related at all brother brenon would put it this way he says I don't condemn good works I don't condemn their Hospital hospitals and good things they do that's wonderful God's blessings to the poor and suffering Humanity I don't condemn all of those thing other things they're doing fine that's just that's just right there organizations and millions of dollars I'd rather let see that than the boot link joint on the corner anytime I certainly honor them as as ministers standing in the Pulpit but when it comes to the gathering together at the end of the dispensation so now he's now he's now he's he's he's trying to separate you now he's trying to show you what's what's taking place he says it'll be waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God in that dispensation that he might gather all together and all that has been brought into Christ what is Christ how do we get into him first Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we are baptized into one body which is the body of Christ are made partakers of every gift and every good thing that he's got that's right the whole earth is groaning crying waiting for the manifestation that when Christ and his church will unite together what what is it it's the Capstone the Capstone word has come down upon you charity has has capped Your Vessel what is charity charity is brother Rand would say now it's not the same as as as as what you would what you would say giving your body to be burned or giving food to the poor or anything like that because that there in there in 1 Corinthians the 13th chapter we found outen though I get my body to be burned and though I give my food do I do this and do that amen and have not charity it profits me nothing charity is the very person it's the life it is the lust in flesh it is amen it is the Capstone is who Christ is l o v e it is God tabernacling me and I can see as he sees not a child I'm not a little girl anymore I've come of age to where I have walking with the king oh do you love him many many quotes in here but brother BR would say you must be in his time it must be in his season you got that now must be in his time must be in a season time and season it must come according to his word that has been spoken it must I don't care how well you say it ought to be and that ought to be this ought to be it's got to be according to his word according to his time according to his season it must be be given according to the person he has chosen to do it by oh Hallelujah good I was telling someone the other day you see you are the answer to God's word so that little something it it all works together God works on this side and that side yeah [Music] well praise the Lord okay I'm closing amen that's for that's for S that's for sister Denise amen I'm closing amen now Hallelujah this is going to look funny but I'm tired of playing with that thing amen so so here Abram or or Isaac is looking for a bride so he goes Abraham goes and talks to eleazer his servant Hallelujah and it says go hunt my bride or wife y'all remember what God what God showed brother brandom God show brother brandom that his ministry was the elaser ministry you say no it was the Holy Ghost well hello what do you think the pillar of fire is come on what do you come on but the pillar of fire showed up that's right at the birth of William brandham the pillar of fire showed up at that at the Ohio river and said just as John the Baptist forrun my first coming so shall you forun my second coming and it just so happened that that wasn't just an individual deal that there had already been a prophecy on the west coast someone had rose up earlier on and said amen there will come a prophet messenger and just says John the Baptist forun the first coming of Christ H this Prophet will forerun the second coming of Christ brother Brenham had never even been on the west coast well anyways amen hallelujah so eleazer was to go get a bride now eleazer was telling was telling Abraham what if she won't listen she says go back to my people and get a bride she said what she won't come well what if she won't what am I going to do he says just go and if she and and if they won't listen then you're freed from your oath well praise the Lord but now watch here here he come and he's sitting by a well and he puts fleeces before the Lord and says the one that comes in and Waters not just me but Waters all of my camels Waters all them Waters all of those amen she'll be the one so here comes Minnie offering him to drink amen but they sure weren't going to take care of that whole Fleet of camels uhuh they weren't doing that amen and here come and about the evening time here come little Rebecca and she come out she says can I give you some water and he gives her some water he gives her some water and then he turns around and looks and she's watering the camel and this camel and that Camel but she's he's going oh the one the one who was doing the calling was the one that was also giving the desire the one who had sent him was also are you hearing me the one who gave the promise of Isaac is now give calling the bride for Isaac and now amen and so now when when he comes in and and tells her says listen you're the girl well she don't have to have a portfolio she don't have to see how many stocks and bonds the guy owns she does do have to see how much he how rich he is she says I'll go there was there was no questioning there was no criticalness there was no what if you're not well I you know it was amen she says well you got to go talk to my folks first they go up there and talk to the folks amen run in there they they amen and they said no she needs to stay behind amen and then and you know and Sav for so many days this that and the other they said well amen no I've got to leave now it's just we can't stay here and she says well just let the you know ask the girl ask and see what she thinks amen and when they come in and brought her in and asked her she says I will go now what what am I saying she it was the season for a bride it was the season for elaser it was a season he was looking for that bride she came out under the influence of that anointing For That season the season was calling for a bride therefore God sent a prophet with a message and there was a Rebecca saying be it unto me the season was calling for maturity and then there came a prophet to open that book and say you are the one the need is why the product was invented in the first place going back to brother Mitch amen the need was there amen therefore their could could be an invention amen are you understanding there was a need there was a need for a bride because it was Bride season bride time it's time to go home but there wasn't no bride identified so here comes El easier with the word of God that word the anointing that was upon and the Rebecca has said in this day I will go I will there's something in her it's the quality of Faith by predestination I will go can you say amen amen yes there was a need God came in gave us the prophet Amen in the fullness of time in the fullness of time when the need was there for a redeemer in the fullness of time God sent forth his son born of a woman in the fullness can you say Amen the need was before the design your name was already put here and so God knew the season God knew the bed that you'd be planted God knew the time that you would come forth and in that season there was an answer to that need to get you ready for the coming of the Lord amen if the musicians would come chosen Us in him amen God designed God built God has put you here right here in Le Osa right for a rapturing word oh what if I don't get it you're going to get it you're destined to it what if what but brother W what if what what if what if Hallelujah if you're in the plant if you're in the plant and you're predestinated to this season you're coming up God's calling for maturity God's calling for us to come up higher amen there's something on the inside now if you ain't if you ain't got something on the inside if you're just satisfied with your religious ways and you're just going to you're just going to walk anytime anytime something is said behind the pulpit that that you don't agree with or you know you just well that's up to you but there's going to be if you're in the plant if you're in the plant the life of the holy spirit is going to draw us up we have no other choice it's drawing us on up into the word not your opinion it's drawing us into the word and we're going to heed what the prophet says we're going to take the full scope of what he says now why why do we have why why do we have all of these denominations listen there are seven or or maybe nine major seven [Music] Thunder doctrines in the message and all of them are using brother brandom's message it's because they're taking one little quote and building their denomination around it maybe they've got three quotes here and this seven Thunder Doctrine can't agree with this one and this one can't agree with this one and I'm just talking about the seven Thunders cuz I looked it up when they were trying to get me in it amen thought okay well there's something about these seven Thunders amen then I found out there's eight or nine of them I'm going hm which one do I [Music] join I thought I'll just stick with the message they they start with a genuine nugget and in an apostasy right now there is a big Hallelujah I'm not going to mention yeah I am I am cuz it's all brother Rosco he was once with he he he he and he and brother Coleman were together and then they split off and and um went through so so brother Rosco is is a pretty influential guy overseas and uh so they have got this they they have got this s Thunder thing so going and it's went so high now that that I I I I uh they they call him Elohim Rosco now he has now become word made flesh he has now this is this is message this this are message folks taking stinking opinions taking genuine [Music] quotes and building their little web that don't match with anything else and he's got his quotes you know that that taking on Flor taking on flesh and this that anyway so now they were chanting for 15 minutes Elohim Rosco Elohim Rosco Elohim Rosco and he's up there just and there are hundreds I'd say there's probably a thousand people there Elohim rasco Elohim rasco Elohim and I'm thinking how can you how can you do that come on this is maturing but it sure ain't maturing that [Music] way right so I I want to make sure that my belief system can go from kber to kber for those that aren't acquainted with the message cover to cover amen I wanted to make sure that it goes I I want to make sure that I can stand and say yes this is the maturing season I'm coming on into the seed and the seed is thus saith the Lord here can you say Amen you're designed for it you're built for it you say well what if I what if I what if I what if I follow what what if I get LED astray you ain't going to get let astray as long as you throw your opinions aside everyone else's opinions aside and follow this if you follow this you're not going to go you're not going to be defeated you can't be defeated there's no defeat in the word none whatsoever in the word you can only walk with God as you walk in the light of the word you can only overcome as long as you're walking in the light of the word is that right amen so the messenger has come to shine light upon the season amen well glory to God I love him this
