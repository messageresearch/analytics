thankful uh for the the turnout and just the the diligence of so many to come and and uh Brave the weather and and actually it was it was a lot warmer last night than what it was at 11:00 yesterday and so the Lord just gave us such wonderful uh uh weather and and um um I thought that uh the fellowship hall was was fixed up so nicely and and all of the food and hot chocolate and coffee uh it it was it was just wonderful um sister gadman and brother gadman was out there and even my mama was out there last night and uh Braven the cold and uh but it was it was a lot of fun he I enjoyed the trailers and and the uh the trucks um I thought it was nice we we went on a on a totally different side of town um another another neighborhood and so uh lot of wonderful uh reception among them and so I you know I I think um uh letting our our light shine is so important however we can do it you know man everything about us should be Ministry everything when you walk into the grocery store it should be Ministry um I I've I've I've often said I've had more success with the oneon-one than I than I have uh being a pastor you know um I've been able to win people to the Lord um in grocery stores in parks and you know just talk to people about the Lord Jesus and um and listen to them pray for them and so any opportunity that we have you know we can uh give that amen uh put get give that Gospel Light to the people and so I just believe we done that last night amen and um so we're going to be in um in page uh 243 tonight we're starting the sardian church age now you will um if you'll remember now this was the this was the the dark uh season of the church and um um so we if if you follow in line with the with the SE s now amen um it was the Black Horse we we had the black horse this is this was that Dark Age almost a full thousand years I think it was 915 years of of uh Dark Ages and um and so and when we say Dark Ages I think brother brandom it's it's just this it you you've had your you you you had between uh the thyon and the pergamus um you have uh the the darkness the Dark Ages has come through so you'll see the you had your you had your white horse the Antichrist spirit and then here comes the red horse coming in samna and pergamus and just slaughtering anything that doesn't agree with them and then here is thyra amen and these ages all blend in together but thyra was that Dark Age now in in each of these ages we've always got to remember that um if you were to look in in the scripture when the seals were being opened up amen there was a beast or a power that was introducing the horse rider so it was the there there was a an Beast that says and if you want to just read look at that just real quickly here here in in uh Revelations the um um let let's just look at Revelations the 4th chapter and the 6th verse and and these are the beasts that that stand Before the Throne of God anointings and it says uh Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like an a crystal in the midst of the throne round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind the first Beast was like a lion the second beast like a calf the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and the four Beast had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come so now so the these these uh beasts these living creatures is what they're actually translated these uh living creatures represent God their whole desire is for the anointing of God to protect the anointing of God Amen they they they they guard that Living Word and so this is what they are doing here on Earth they are guarding uh the the the the Living Word here on the earth that's that's their purpose and so if you were to look when the seals were open and and um if if you would go over to the sixth chapter now we're finding that these beasts are coming and they're and they're showing the Church of this last day this is what happened in 1963 the opening of the seals it says I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the the four Beast saying come and see and then he shows the White Horse then if you go down to the third uh verse it says and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see so the first one was a lion the second one was an was an ox if you go one down and then it then it revealed the red horse and then you you go on down to the fifth verse and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast uh say come and see what was the third Beast it it was the living creature with a man's intelligence a man's face then you go on down to the seventh verse and when he had opened the for seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and so it was The Pale Horse Rider and of course we understand what what is that fourth Beast it was the Flying Eagle it was the prophet messenger and so so and then then we understand that the fifth and The Sixth Seal does not pertain to the bride at all it it it's this is all going to take place after we have been caught up uh so that's good that's that's the Jewish seal and the tribulation seal so amen so we find that the lion introduced not the White Horse introducing the lion but it was the spirit of the Lord it was the the the living creatures that was showing the Church hey this is what took place in Ephesus amen then there was one of the beasts comes and says hey this is what took place in the early church and and we just got through with a thyra and and um and there was a amen we we're going to find now that in this Dark Age there is the man age or there is the anointing of the man that is that is fixing to to come and break the paple Rome uh the the the the paple stronghold on the church now this this is what we're fixing to get into this is where Martin Luther is going to come in and uh uh and there's going to be many great men intelligent men that that that take the the word that was written in Latin so that no one else could hear and no one else could read and and uh amen and and Martin Luther was was so bold and he stood up against the the pope and and and um and all of the the money they were charging for indulgences and for purgatory and and all of these things from the poor people and Martin Luther amen uh uh he he started uh printing the Bible portions of the Bible I think he started with Romans and he and he put it in the German language for the common people to read and as they begin to see what was taking place and reading the scripture for themselves that the grace of God is without was without money the grace of God and the love of God Amen you don't earn it you don't buy it then it started a Reformation around the world so you can see that that coming out of this age it was an an anointing the intellect uh great teachers came up that began to uh uh uh uh expose the church for what it was so and of course we understand that it we wouldn't understand any of this today if it hadn't have been for the eagle anointing coming down in the seventh angel Messenger to show us where we are aren't you glad that we we have an understanding of what has taking place amen that's that's the reason and and and you remember okay you know before we get to to to reading tonight now remember brother brandom says that each messenger comes at the end of the age so if you were to to look there at at the messenger um uh e ephes the Ephesian Church age started at 53 and ended in 170 brother uh or the Apostle Paul uh he his lifespan was from 58 to 64 so brother brother Paul he came at the end of Pentecost Usher in in to the Ephesian or the Ephesus Church age irus he was born in 120 uh around the 120 there's a little bit of you know they they say it's somewhere around the 120 and then he died around 200 now now here samna started at 170 and went to 312 so Paul comes at the end of Pentecost ushering in this one and then Here Comes irus us ing in samna Martin St Martin he was his lifespan was from 316 to 397 and the church age there was and pergamus was 312 to 3 606 and then uh thara was 606 to 1520 and Columba was uh was he died in 597 so Columbus died right here but he ushered in this so I want you to catch this because this is incredible Paul comes in here ushering in this one comes in ushering in always comes at the end to usher in our uh Prophet came in at the end of this Philadelphian age in 1906 he was born in 1909 ushering in to this lotsy and age what is left for here but coming right on into the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ there is no other ages Beyond Beyond this and it was a prophet messenger that's introduced you and I to a living perfect word amen aren't you glad for that that living that perfect Living Word so now let's let's look here at U let's see here um here in the Sardis Church age and we're going to start there at page 143 it says unto the angel of the Church in S is right these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou h a name that thou livest and art dead be careful or Be watchful and strengthen those things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief Thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches Sardis Sardis was the capital of ancient Lydia it passed from the hands of lydian monarchs monarchs to the Persians and then to Alexander the Great it was sacked by Antiochus the great the kings of pergamus then succeeded to the Dominion until the Romans took over in the time of Tiberius it was so desolated by earthquakes and plagues today it is a heap of ruins and uninhabited this city was at one time very important commercially plenty said that the art of dying wool was invented here it was the center of wool dying and carpet weaving it had a goodly amount of silver and gold in the area and it is said that the gold coins were first meant to there it also had a slave market the religion of this city was the impure worship of the Goddess sabell the massive ruins of the temple may still be seen you will recall in the pergam Manan age I mention the babylonish concept of mother and son known as Seamus and nenus uh became Sabella and deos of Asia the attributes attaches attached to these to are most enlightening as we view them side by side he was the son God she was the moon goddess he was the Lord of Heaven she was she the Queen of Heaven he the revealer of goodness and Truth she of gentleness and mercy he the mediator she the mediatrix mediatrix he with the key that opens and shuts the gates of the invisible world and she with an identical key doing likewise he is the judge of the Dead she as standing at his side he being killed raised and ascended into heaven she carried there bodily by the son now in Rome this same God is given the title of our Lord he is called the Son of God while she is called the mother of God now that is what we found back there in the other two ages where the mother and son concept took on such tremendous proportions but now notice even as it was back in Babylon that the worship of the son began to lose out in favor of the worship of the mother so she literally began to take the place of the son and we see in this age that the Pagan worship of Sardis was the worship of the woman it is Sabella alone not Sabella andos the mother has literally taken the place of the son endowed with the merits of the godhead of all all one needs to do is go over her various titles and recall the lovely attributes accorded Mary by the Roman Church to understand where the religion of this age came from two things really struck me with Force as I looked into the worship of sabell one was the fact she wore a key like Janice which gave her the same Authority as Janice key to heaven and earth and the Mysteries and the fact that the worshippers whip themselves until blood spurts from their bodies which thing is done right today by the Catholics who feel they are suffering like our Lord the fact that this is the age of the first real break from the paple Rome that actually flourished no doubt calls Jezebel the The Jezebel prophetess to consolidate and emphasize her doctrine of marity in decided opposition to the uh Protestants who denied her any part whatsoever in the Plan of Salvation apart from her favor with God as the Virgin chosen to Bear the babe as Luther crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith they held to Works penance prayers and other unscriptural means and as the freed Christians glorified the Sun the Roman Catholics increased their deification of Mary until the 20th century uh Saul in the opposition to most high-ranking Roman theologians Pope Pas literally exalt Mary to glorification in a resurrected body that Doctrine is absolutely the babylonish one of the son carrying the mother bodily into heaven isn't that incredible how how how so accurate the scripture is no wonder this fifth age goes right along with the other ages and will do so until it ends in the Lake of Fire where the and her children are killed in the second death there it is Mary ol and the worship of Sabella by the way did you know that zabella was the aardi that Jezebel was pre Priestess to and caused Israel to stumble by the uh Lous rights that she conducted yes that is who she was in the Bible the age the sardian or fifth Church age lasted from 1520 to 1750 it is usually called the age of the Reformation the messenger the messenger to the age is the best known messenger of all the ages he was Martin Luther Martin Luther was a brilliant scholar of gentle dispens disposition he was studying to be a lawyer when the lingering illness and death of a near friend caused him to become serious concerning the spiritual condition of his life he entered the augustinian Convent in erford uh in 1 155 there he studied philosophy and also the word of God he lived the life of severest penance but all the outward acts could not vanish his sense of sin he said I'm tormented I've tormented myself to death to make peace with God but I was in darkness and found it not the viker general of his order stupit stopit helped him to gain the Insight that his salvation would have to be the experience of an inner work rather than a ritual with this encouragement he further sought God later he become a priest as of yet he was not saved he become an advent and deep student of the word and of the great theological Works extent he was sought out as a teacher and preacher for his depths of knowledge and great sincerity to fulfill a vow he had made to himself he went to Rome and there he saw the futility of the the church's imposed works that were or to bring Salvation and the word of God struck home to his heart the just shall live by faith I want is return home the Evangelistic truth Evangelical uh truth of this scripture flooded his mind and he set he was set free from sin and Born Into the kingdom of God soon after this he was elevated to the doctor of divinity and convened to devote his whole life to study and faith F expound and defend the Holy Scripture this he did with such effect that his heart and the hearts of those around him were deeply fixed upon the truth of the word the word soon came into open conflict with the abuses of the church Creeds and doctrines thus when Leo 10 became Pope and John tetel came to sell Indulgence for sin Luther had no choice but to rise up against this anti scriptural teaching first he thundered from the pulpit against it and then wrote his famous 95 thesis which on October 31 1517 he nailed to the door of the castle of Castle Church in a short time Germany was Ablaze and the Reformation was on now let it be remembered that Martin Luther was not the only one who had protested the Roman Catholic Church he was but one of many others had denied the popee their self- granted temporal and spiritual power and even amongst the popes there were minor temporary reforms yes there were many others who raised issues but in the case of Luther God's time was right for a definite move that would be uh beginning of the restoration of the church to an outpouring of the Holy Ghost at a much later date now Martin Luther himself was a sensitive Spirit-filled Christian he was defin Ely a man of the word for he not only had a profound passion to study to make it available to all in order that they might live by it he translated the New Testament and gave it to the people this laborious work he did himself correcting a passage as much as 20 times he gathered around him a group of Hebrew Scholars amongst them whom were Jews and translated the Old Testament this Monument work of Luther is still the work upon which all successive works of the scripture in Germany have rested he was a mighty preacher and teacher of the word and insisted especially in his first years of public Eminence that the word was the so Criterion thus he was against works as means of Salvation and baptism as means of regeneration he taught the mediation of Christ apart from man as was the original and Pentecostal concept he was a man given to much prayer and had learned that the more work he had to do the more solely he was pressed for time the more of this time he gave to God In Prayer in order to ensure satisfactory results he knew what it was to battle with the devil and it said it is said that Satan one day visibly appeared to him and he flung The inkw Well at him bidding him go another time two fanatics came to him to induce him to join them in banishing all priests and bibles he discerned the spirit within them and sent them off it is recorded of Dr Martin Luther in s history volume 3 page 406 that he was a Prophet evangelist speaker in tongues interpreter in one person endowed with all nine spiritual gifts of the Spirit what stirred his his heart by the Holy Ghost which was the little green Shute that signified that truth was coming back to the church as it was known at Pentecost aren't you glad for that was the doctrine of justification salvation by grace apart from works now I recognize that Dr Martin did not believe only and preach only justification but that was his major theme as indeed it had to be for that is the basic doctrine of truth of the word he will be forever known as the instrument in the hand of God who revived this truth he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith surely we admit that he knew and did teach that we are to go from Faith to Faith His Marvelous understanding of the sovereignty and election and predestination and other truth show him to be a great man in the word yet I say again as do historians God used him to bring the people bring to the people God's standard against works the just shall live by faith as I mentioned already this age has been called by the historians the period of reformation that is exactly right that is what it was it had to be that for Martin Luther was a reformer not a prophet now I know the history book calls him a prophet but it doesn't mean that the history book is right for there is no record of Martin Luther qualifying as a true prophet of God in the grand scriptural sense of that word he was a fine teacher with some of the manifestations of the spirit in his life and we praise God for that so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would a man like the Apostle Paul who was both Apostle and Prophet now y'all understand that see you can have you can have wonderful theologians and an anointed Theologian listen listen he was raised up supernaturally by God uh for this Reformation but he was not a prophet and and so Amen in and in it but a word Prophet cannot vary from the word one way or the other a word Prophet will stay there he is he is built to stay with the word regardless that the fivefold ministry can can fail preachers all all Humanity can fail and so can a prophet Amen in his own being but that Prophet has been has been sent by God and the scripture says that God did not allow one word of Samuels to ever fall to the ground not one word he was there destined for a purpose and When God says he's going to send an eagle Messenger to our day it was you can rest assured that God Vindicated that Ministry and you can you can you can take it right back to scripture knowing amen that God has restored to us in this day do y'all believe that he's re he's definitely restored to us that that word for this Rapture now I that that's just wonderful that that's just beautiful to me we don't have to fear amen whether we're going to make the Rapture I I say Lord just let me put the Garment on let your word be all around me I'm going to listen I'm going to heed to your word for this day and I I and I want to be prepared for what uh uh for this Rapture this body change that is coming on Amen thank God for a prophet amen now um the the the last paragraph of 247 it says um now as time went on we find a great change in the way he conducted the Affairs in which he was evolved at first he had been so gentle so Fearless so patient in constantly waiting on God to work out the problems then vast numbers uh began to come to his banner and and their purpose was not a not a truly uh spiritual one rather they had political motivations they begin to break the Yoke of the Pope or they wanted to break the Yoke of the Pope they disliked sending money to Rome Fanatics rose up and soon he was dragged into Political Affairs and decisions that actually lay outside the rim of the church except that the church through prayer preaching and conduct May set up a standard to be Heed These problems of political politics mounted until he was forced into an untenable uh position of mediating between Lords and peasants his decisions were so wrong that an uprising took place and thousands were killed he meant well but once he had let himself be entangled again in the church State gospel he had to reap the Whirlwind but for all that God used Martin Luther let it not be said that his intentions were wrong let it only be said that his judgments failed truly if the Lutheran could get back to his teaching and serve God as this precious brother served him then that people would surely be a credit and praise to the great God and Savior Jesus Christ the salutation Revelations 3 And1 these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars once again as in the previous four ages the spirit is revealing our gracious Lord To Us by setting forth his wonderful attributes this time as he is standing in the midst of the church we see him as the one with the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars we know who the Seven Stars are but we will have to find what the seven spirits refer to the same phrase is found four times in the Book of Revelation Revelations 1 and 4 from the seven spirits which are before his throne Revelations 3 And1 these things saith he that hath the seven spirits Revelations 4:5 out of the throne precedes lightning and thundering and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God Revelations 56 and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth to begin I know for a certainty that these scriptures are that these verses are not a teaching teaching a new and contrary Doctrine to John 4:28 or 24a God is a one Spirit but this is like 1 Corinthians 12 8-1 wherein we find one Spirit manifesting himself in nine ways thus we know that the seven spirits of God mean it is the one and Same Spirit coming forth in a Sevenfold way you know I I was one of the things that that that some of these um never never branom folks uh you know they have the never trumpers and so now we've got the never brandom and and they they they brother brandom always talks about the stars and how the Stars reflects the sun the sun has to shine so well one of their big issues today is okay so you know William brandom is supposed to be this prophet and he's and that we have found that that stars um give their own light stars are not reflecting the sun they give their own light and and so um and you know they go through all the science of it and they and and and and I I I have to I have to chuckle because brother brandom is simply going to scripture that it is the one God reflecting in the seven Earthly Stars they have no light of their own the seven spirits of God are seven manifestations of that one God here on the earth see see and they and but but they they they they do this to try to to try to confuse you and try to go around the and that's all brother brandham was saying that we become stars because that same holy spirit is reflecting through us so so him using that to show that we are I mean I you know uh no one's ever claimed brother brandham to be a scientist he was a prophet to reveal the word and God used the word stars and God used that it was a reflection from the throne amen and so you know it just shows that they're they're just little children amen well they're reprobates children aren't reprobates so amen I amen so um all right so here we go it says um uh The Same Spirit coming forth in a Sevenfold way now in Revelations 4 and 5 these same seven Spirits are called lamps of fire burning before the Lord since John always used nothing but Old Testament symbols in the revelation we go to the Old Testament and find from Proverbs 20:27 that the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord these seven spirits are found to be associated with men now I think this is beautiful right here John the Baptist in John 535 he was called a burning light which should actually be translated as burning lamp again Revelations 56 the seven spirits are identified as seven eyes in Zechariah 4:10 for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord it is very evident that the word they refers to men thus we see the eyes of the Lord in this instances are men in this in uh in this instance is are men of course they will be anointed Men full of the Holy Ghost for God's Ministries are not in the power of men but of the Holy Ghost putting our scriptural discoveries together it is evident that the seven spirits of God refer to the Contin Ministry of the same Holy Spirit in the lives of seven men with whom God identifies himself very closely they are his eyes and they are his lamps they and these uh who these seven men are can easily be seen because the next phrase calls them the Seven Stars which are already known to us as the seven Messengers to The Seven Ages how beautiful that is see the star was man to reflect light at night for the sun has gone so just the messenger typified as a star uh uh uh just so the messenger typifies a star to each age was to reflect the light of the sun they all did this by the Holy Spirit Paul was the first messenger and he said in Galatians 1:8 that if any Angel any messenger any viker no matter who he was if he preached any other gospel than what Paul preached let him be a cursed Paul knew that after he was gone Grievious wolves would come in he knew that Satan himself could appear as an angel of Light so how much more his ministers so he warns that this gospel would always be the same now Paul had baptized in Jesus name and re-baptized where people had not been immersed he set the church in order and taught the proper use of the gifts of the Spirit and confirmed that they were to remain in the church till Jesus came thus the next Messengers all the remaining six would uh by the same Holy Ghost burn with the same fire give the same light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the signs would follow them did irus qualify yes did Martin yes did Columba yes did Martin Luther most assuredly did Wesley yes sir he had a great ministry and even prayed for his horse to get well and it did there you are seven Church ages and seven Messengers who were alike and PR and Paul pronounced a curse on anyone who would who who said he was a messenger but had a different gospel and lived in a different light now does does the last statement of Mine Bear up with the rest of the word yes it says in the word that if any man adds to this book or takes from it he would be plagued and judged unto the condemnation by God God said I will add the plagues written in this book and or I will take his name or his part out of The Book of Life Revelations 22:18 so we see that the seven spirits actually refer to the one spirit of God working out the will and word of God in different Generations now are you kidss understanding that one Spirit but he's coming Amen in in and he's and he's revealing himself to different Generations one God manifested through seven Church ages all the way down amen so uh because now remember remember the the whole thing is is all restoration the whole thing is restoration Satan come in to destroy and to take uh uh uh to to take take out God's Earthly body amen just like he did Jesus Christ but he raised from the dead and is seated at the right hand of God so is today he has he vowed to destroy God's bride amen and he almost took this church out but God says I'm going to raise him up he wasn't Jesus wasn't raised up the first day he wasn't raised up the second day he was raised up in the third day and here we have went down through these dark ages and God begins to raise up here the church is dead it's over it's finished but then God raises up through Sardis and Philadelphia and and Leota and here we are at the last days where the where the Bride of Jesus Christ is taking her position amen is going to rule over Satan defeat all of her enemies because God is faithful faithful to his word not that he's faithful to me not that he's faithful to you he's faithful to his word that he has over you that's the why we make our mistakes we go up we go down reason sometimes we should all be greef spots but God's got a word spoke over you and me and he's going to keep that word over you aren't you glad for that amen now he says so we um we'll read that again so we can see the seven spirits actually refer to the one spirit of God working out the will and word of God in different Generations I would like to illustrate that from the word the spirit of God was mightily upon Elijah then that same Spirit came on Elisha in a two-fold effect centuries later The Same Spirit which we call the spirit of Elijah in order to describe its Ministry came back upon John the Baptist one day that same Spirit identified by the same manner of ministry will come upon a man for the end of the Gentile Church Age Again the scripture says that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and power and he went about doing good healing all that were oppressed of the devil as Jesus went away he told his disciples to T until Pentecost at which time the very same spirit that was upon him would come back and fall upon them and fill them then that called out body the church would be in his stand upon the Earth taking his place because the same spirit that was in him would be in them they would do the very same works and any people that is truly the body of Jesus Christ the true church WIll manifest the same works as did Jesus and the Pentecostal church and the Pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them any other church that does not have the spirit and the manifestation is going to have to account to God as also It also says here that these Seven Stars are messengers to The Seven Ages are in his hand he is holding them you know right away that if they are held in his hand they are associated with his power that is what their hand signifies it signifies the power of God and authority of God not one of them come in his own power and authority that is what Paul said no man would dare to it takes the authority of God and the power of the Holy Ghost the gospel is preached by the authority of God God in the power of the spirit these men were all empowered by the Holy Ghost they all stood up to the world they could do that they were full of God they were sent or authorized by God not by self or other men now they had what the world could not have Jesus said when he went away he would send his Spirit which the world could not receive that is right the world or world's systems could not receive him that is what organization is it is World System show me a world system church that is full of the Holy Ghost I want to see it if you can show me such a church you are finding a mistake in the word no sir not one of these Messengers was organized either they were put out or got out because they were convicted of the sin of the organization how can the Holy Spirit possibly be an organization when it is organization that takes the place of the spirit and denominations take the place of the word remember organization is death it just can't be any other way if the world takes over the spirit departs yes the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same and the Seven Messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost by experience it will be a Pentecostal Church there will be tongues interpretation and prophecy and healings there will God will be in the midst of her God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has Hallelujah she will be unorganized don't forget that can I hear an amen now we can see that Jesus Christ is revealing himself through the age by his Spirit In The Messengers they are as Moses was to the children of Israel he had the Revelation for his day so each messenger has God's revelation and Ministry for that day then uh thus we uh thus we see that the messengers are in his hand we see the Lord identifying himself with these men and granting them his power it is not enough that he has Associated himself with the whole church which we saw when he's seen standing amongst the good seven candlesticks nor is it enough that we see the five-fold ministry of of Ephesians four Apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors for in each age the church goes astray and is not just the Ley but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as well as the Sheep then God brings himself on the scene as the chief Shepherd in the ministries of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth truth and abundant power of that truth God is in his people all of his people for If any man has not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and he is the word that would be the word recognized in the people but he has placed a special leadership in these men of his own choosing and through the determined counsel of his own will they appear once in an age once in each age it is the same spirit in them what a far cry is this from the heresy of Rome they have a man of their own choosing one after the other none producing the power of God none abiding in the word of God each one differing from the one before him and Abiding and adding what he desires as though he were God God is not in it but he is in his messenger and he who would have the fullness of God would follow the messenger as the messenger is follower a follower of the Lord for his uh by his word he that hath the seven spirits and the Seven Stars Revelations 3:1 now the same Lord identifies himself with man in the Incarnation he has again identifying himself with Man by his Spirit within man Hallelujah these are mine sayeth the Lord the seven Spirit-filled Messengers are the Lords they may be repudiated they may be questions in indeed to human minds they might not even seem to qualify nevertheless they are The Messengers for their age God used an Abraham he lied he used a Moses he rebelled a Jonah he disobeyed a Samson he sinned David he murdered he also used a Joshua and a Joseph and those with severe blemishes far outnumber those with histories that seem to be perfect all were and all and are his none dare deny that he used them by and through the holy spirit that he put within them to their own Master they stood or fell in them all was accomplished The Sovereign will of God let exteral history attempt to refute this it still stands the Eternal God still walks among the golden lamp stands and sends his Messengers by his spirit with the word uh to the people of of each of every age amen the denunciation Revelations 31b I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead Revelations 32b for I have not found thy works perfect before God now here indeed is a very strange thing in every age to this point the spirit has first of all praised the True Believers and then denounced the false Vine but in this period there is evidently such wanting disregard for the Lord and his word that the entire message to the fifth age rings with condemnation I Know Thy Works what were these works that came up before the Lord and caused his displeasure well you know that each age lapped over into the next age so we have a continuation of the works of the fourth age into the fifth these works as you are well aware of were the the leadership of the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit were superseded by human hierarchy the pure word of God and its free benefit to all men was disposed for Creeds dogmas Church orders Etc the worship in the spirit and gifts of the Spirit and all which pertains to the true Community Fellowship of the Saints was cast aside for Liturgy and literal idol worship Feast Etc Mary olry was assuming a greater place in the Christian worship until she had actually assumed a place of godhead and the son was brought uh from his lofty position over all to be subservient to a man called the pope who termed himself the viker of Christ those who fought this terrible Antichrist Church were destroyed those who stayed with it found themselves the pawn of the church whether they were peasant or Kings their lives were not their own neither were their lives Christ they belonged Body Soul and Spirit to the Church of Rome they talked about the blood of Christ yet they purchased their salvation with money and bought forgiveness of sins either by gold or Penance the wealthier of them found it a happy situation when Pope Leo 10 allowed them to buy Indulgence for Sins Not Yet committed so that they with ease of conscience could plan their own their awful crimes and then proceed to carry them out knowing that the pope had already remitted their sins the word of God was kept from them so who was to know the truth since the truth comes only from the word and the people were shut up in a dungeon of the Roman Church awaiting death and after death the Judgment but the great horde drunk with the blood of Martyrs with no thought of the Judgment reeled savagely or to kill men with both spiritual and physical death now toward the end of the fourth age which would be the beginning of the 5th also the invasion of Constantine and the Turks sent learned Scholars of the East with their Greek manuscripts to the West the purity of the word and the teachings of the True Believers were were thus disseminated and and not only were these fine teachers of great importance but also the invention of of what become the bases of our modern print and presses were discovered facilitating the production of books thus we find the great hunger and the demand for the Bible could be answered God raised up mighty many Mighty Men of which Luther was but one Calvin and swingley were were two other illuminaries and besides these were many many more who are not so well known however ever though all this was not in vain the mighty works of God was actually hindered by these very men for one thing they did not oppose the church State marriage of the nin Council but actually fostered that Union the defense of the Gospel by the state was welcomed though there was no word for it and though we see the wrath of man pleasing God in such events as Henry VII taking up for the reformation and the rejection of pample authority it was a far cry from the truth of Pentecost and protection of an omnipotent God In Spite Luther's constant teachings against the outside interference in the local church matters he was not able to clear the men's minds of the bishop and Archbishop concept of church government thus the church took one step in the right direction but still remained Shackled so in short order she was again in prison in the same dungeon when she had had attempted to escape amen so we're going to stop reading right there um so we can see how that uh as as um as as we have read Martin Luther came came right there at the end of that fourth and and was and and and was uh proclaiming and now watch it's such an amazing thing brother Brandon brought out how that there were many many Who had who had withstood the pope um but but never could gain traction they could see that that he was wrong they could see that it was all but they never but they never could get traction and and and yet it was not the age it was not the time they they were still under that that basically under that that that Ox anointing but when God came down and anointed Martin Luther he was the messenger he didn't he didn't promote himself he simply had a burden and the Lord and the and the influence of the Holy Spirit was on him until that one man brought about a Reformation to the entire world I I I think about that and sometimes and it wasn't just him but but the anointing was upon the Earth and it was brother brandom talked about Calvin and he talked about swingley and he talked about all of these others and the people were anointed for this what about in our day when when the seals have been opened the spirit of the Lord because remember what God does through the messenger what he speaks through the messenger he's doing it for the people of that age and so when God spoke through our our our generation in our generation opening the seals and revealing the mystery behind the church ages opening these things up to us there is an anointing upon me and you and we shall Prevail against any power that would ever try to to to uh uh keep you out of that Rapture you're anointed for that now as as each one of those men each one of those people who who followed in those ages they had to Humble themselves before God because listen you there were many that were put to death even in it was it was a it was a rough time even in the days of of Luther he was running for his life but you see they couldn't kill him they couldn't destroy him and and and it was a people that was that were dedicated to God knowing that the truth was more important to them than anything else in the world and today here we stand in the in the most deceitful age of them all but we stand under a covenant we stand under the anointing of the holy spirit that same holy spirit that was that was with our messenger amen that brought that message that same angel of God is right here with you today to hear your prayers understands where you're at knows your heartaches knows your failures and he's there Amen to anoint you for this Rapture amen oh I I love him for it I I thank him for it and so um as we as we get in we this this church age here is going to be a wonderful a wonderful time and and I think we might get into it this next Wednesday night um but brother brandom is going to really um uh uh go into the uh the names that that are that are uh put on the Lamb's Book of Life that cannot be taken off but then there's names that have been put on the book of life that will be taken off um there and and he's and he's going to deal with it and to me it's just it's it's just really beautiful uh the way he goes through this so I'm I'm thinking I'm uh I and that's I I was was the reading uh getting you too sleepy tonight I didn't want to get you too sleepy but I wanted to get to a point to where hopefully um we can we can start getting into that on this next um in this next if not this next Wednesday night it'll be the Wednesday night after that so we'll see how it goes uh any questions here tonight before we uh dismiss amen praise the Lord amen um wasn't that a it was a good reading tonight amen I it it was it was a very very good reading I love the church age book I just you know there's there's there's there's just so many irrefutable things that are in there and you can't you just you just really can't um you can't get away from it anybody that that has any eyes at all can see that uh that it's that it's right on the money amen so politics don't belong in the church and uh and and here we stand today now we've we've got this great thing that's going on today in the charismatic move they're non- denomination but it's still very political and it's a money game it's it's something that that it's there is it's it's a it it has become a well-oiled machine at making money and that is not the Gospel of Jesus Christ and so uh you think you think any of those guys are going to be able to come and open up the word and preach the word you think any of them's going to do that of course they're not man because they've got a cash C coming in they they want they they're you know uh uh they're living in luxury and and and high rollers and and and and and and the and the the people are just uh uhh flocking and making these men rich and their organization's rich and and and and the word of God is not even found in any of them not not found in one of them so I I I say Let It Be the words of life that mean more to us than anything else in the world amen amen more than than than anything else in the world the very words of life is what is preg nating your heart here tonight and I'm glad that God brought it straight from the voice of a prophet Messenger to you and to me to believe that amen I hope we believe that I mean I I I I think that the basic Words of Life are true and if we put those basic principles in our lives amen listen here here it is if if if the Rapture is coming and the word of life amen is is to impregnate the right the Rapture is not going to come by Chance the Rapture is something that is taking the body change is what you are receiving in here and it's got to be undefiled not in your gut but in your heart it's got to be undefiled before God without any kind of man's interpretation it's got we got to believe it the way God wrote it and see the spirits that are out there that would try to defile that seed within me and you because that and that alone will produce and bring about the Rapture can you say amen amen so we we we look to that we believe that amen we amen that but oh God as we as we sing that song let your word be born in the manger of my heart this the Christmas season is coming and uh um we're we're you know it just seems like we go from season to season but let this season be more to us than just amen uh uh you know uh holiday shopping but oh God let your word be born right here in the manger of my heart let me Foster that word amen let me let me look to that word and believe that word because that word has eternal life for me amen if the musicians would come praise the name of the Lord yeah talk about the stars of God yeah you know the naysayers are trying to you know make fun of that yeah and what come to my heart was yeah they they weren't giving out their own life yeah that you know John one says the the about the word in the beginning the word in him was life and the life was the light of men that's good it was that one you talked about one Spirit yeah God's one spirit that one Spirit which was the the the life yeah that one life that one genuine Holy Ghost life was in these sever different men yeah and it's also of course in Us in him was life and the light was and the life was the light of men and the light shined in darkness you know I thought that was so striking talked about the Stars yeah that it it's the life of God the holy ghost that is that produces the light and it's shown through seven chosen vessels for every age and we as the children of God recognize that that light in our day like they did in that day in the sard day day so I don't know if anybody if I said that just right but I I see I just saw that so plainly yeah as you were that the Stars they were the stars of God Amen you know yeah they were just they weren't giving out their own life no no and that and that would that would defeat that that would defeat the purpose and that's you know and and you listen to that the light had to shine on that certain portion of the word for each age and God would raise that man not with his own intellect but God would raise that man up and shine his light and why do why do these guys um try to make make brother brandom look like a fool because it's clearly in the scripture and he's just expounding just like he talked about the you know the spirit of man is is is is a candle you know going through those things or how that God would raise up men but you know what the hardest part for man is to follow another man and and and God they they didn't want to follow Jesus Christ they didn't want to they didn't want to follow any of the prophets and when God would raise up he would raise up a man anoint that man for that [Music] age that man would simply be a reflection of of of God's Eternal purpose it would be such a reflection and the people would see the anointing upon that man because it was not that man and I I I and on Martin Luther how could any man even though he was a smart man but how could Any Man start a start a a great Revolution like like that you you can't it was God that was with him I say today in our day we've had a greater Vindication than any of the other days because the and and and and we've seen it time and time and time again through the through the prophet Ministry and the reason why we can say that even even more than that's recorded in the days of Jesus or more those recorded in the days of Paul is just we got tapes we I mean this went around this went around the world and and it was so Vindicated before the whole world that it was God I don't know I think I I I think that um I I I think that we're pretty blessed I think I think it's wonderful if God has ever Vindicated a message if God has ever been good to a people he's been good to us amen because there was still a lot of lot of nonsense we know that the Catholic or the lutherans went right back to Mama and all these others went right back to Mama there was just all all of that Revival and death Revival and death Revival and death but guys we can say beyond a shadow of a doubt I don't know about you know they're people's always sending me stuff about the about these guys they're they've got a cohered um effort right now they're sending stuff you know to these television stations and also putting stuff in newspapers uh calling the message of cult I don't I don't care what anyone else has done with that message the message is right from start to to the end and you can put your you can put your confidence in that and and since I have studied the message as I have I can I can go back you know it was like when the brother was trying to tell me about um you know he brought he brought something to me about brother brandom being a racist and so he took he took all of these articles from the internet brought it over to me and I I said but but that's not that's not all of it they're taking the quotes all of these quotes and I said I know every one of these quotes and I said here let me show you so I was able to go on my computer pushed in let him read the whole thing there that God was a segregationist well he was talking about segregating the the church the the church from the bride segregating the us from the world separate I said so I took I took all of these quotes brought it out that then I looked over at the man and I said now who's [Music] lying he said well that's not the way they put it I said they're lying I just showed you black white I took the quotes that they put in here and they're splicing I said here it is it ends it ends and then they've got and it looks like it's all the same so I said let's go find the other quote I it it's all lies they're doing this yes but that's that's I'm beyond that I've seen a Vindication I know that I can come back I've seen the word more clearly than I've ever seen it and you can't take me away from that and these guys that don't want you quoting brother brandom or they they they say we're putting too much you know even sometimes in the message ranks well you know we put in too much on yesterday well I want to tell you this ain't a yesterday message this message was for this Rapture not for those guys that went into the ground this he was prep now we're thankful for the guys that went in the ground that's waiting on us but listen he is preparing a church that is
