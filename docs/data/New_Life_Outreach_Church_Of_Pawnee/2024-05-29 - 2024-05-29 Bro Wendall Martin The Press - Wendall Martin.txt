verse it says and again he he entered into capernium um after some days and it was noise that he was in the house and straight way many were gathered together in so much that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto them and they came unto him bringing one sick of the py which was born a four and when they could not come nigh unto him for the Press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the pausy lay and when Jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of pausy son thy sins are forgiven thee can you say Amen I'd also like to read here in the book of Philippians the 3D chapter amen and this is a familiar passage of scripture but here in in Philippians 3 and 12 not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after amen now that word follow should be Chase I chase after if that I may apprehend or arrest that for which I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before I press somebody say I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we thank you today for your love we thank you for the

uh when we were away but uh the Press amen I I want to minister this evening on the Press you know we we I I think if we're going to receive anything from the lord it's going to require a press and um amen now as we read there in the scripture amen where they could not come nigh unto him because of the press now that word press is it's it's uh it it it has to do with large crowds or a multitude or throngs but amen uh uh they they couldn't get to him amen the woman with the issue of blood couldn't had a hard time getting to Jesus because of the press there in other words there was a a lot of people that were there amen uh a a great crowd that was there Amen to uh for for different reasons maybe they were there to criticize maybe there they were there to to see Miracles maybe they were there to amen uh uh to listen to his Doctrine maybe amen there were Pharisees in the in the midst there were Sadducees there there were a lot of reasons for people to be there but there was something about these men they had a specific need they had a specific Challenge and they had to come into to the presence of Jesus now amen I it was not good enough for them to just be in his presence it wasn't just good enough to say that I amen I've come and I've been in church or I amen I I I I've I've paid my duties on a Wednesday night and amen I I but I want to get the attention of the Lord Jesus Christ here tonight amen don't want to just be in his presence but I want him to see me how about the how about you here tonight you see they had a bunch of people in the audience they amen so much so that they could not even get in they couldn't get through the windows couldn't get through the doors so their desire was to get to Jesus and nothing was going to hold them back until they came into the presence of the Lord oh hallelujah amen I say tonight some of the best services that I've ever been in is on a Wednesday night amen and you know why is because it requires a press we get weary and we get tired and we amen there's lots of times where I I I I'd rather stay home and amen there's a lots of times you would rather stay home than to get all your kids together and come to church amen and and but but you come anyways and amen but when you come don't just come just to say that you've done it amen I want to get into the presence of the Lord but I I want to get his attention when I come into His presence amen I've been in those Wednesday nights where God has moved amen why has it is because it's required a press it's required a press Amen to put your clothes on it's been required a press to come into the church it it's a pressed to lift your hands sometimes it's a pressed to amen sing the songs it's a pressed to say Amen but you know when you press to get the attention of God I want to tell you once you get his attention he will give you the desires of your heart amen oh friends I don't want to be a lazy spectator I want to be a part of the game I want to be right there where the anointing is I don't want to just say I've been to church but I want the attention of the Lord Jesus Christ amen as we come into the building here tonight amen oh God we we we don't want to just come and and say we don't want to just come and and say that I've been but God I need something from you I need something from you can you say amen amen when I get here amen I want to know it reminds me that amen of the story that we've heard many times about the you know when the King was coming and amen going through England and they were having uh the little procession and and and all the schools had let out and amen and and and the and the teachers had given the the the children little flags and so when the when the uh the the king came by amen they could wave their flag at him and and it was quite a patriotic time but amen after the procession was over the teacher was counting her class and and and noticed that she had missed a little girl and and and when she couldn't find her she she retraced her steps and and went back to the to the street where the prade was at and and there she was leaning up against a pole and oh and she was crying her little lies out amen she was just a weeping and and and the teacher says honey what is wrong and amen did you not get to see the the the the king and she says yes I saw the king amen and she she says well did you did you did you raise your flag and she said yes I waved my flag she said then why are you crying she says I was too little the king did not get to see me amen I want to tell you tonight there is no one too little but what God can know who you are here tonight he knows every little boy he knows every little girl he knows every Grandpa and Grandma he knows every mama he sees a Hungry Heart friend I say tonight if there's something we need more than anything else as a desire not to just be in his presence but to amen get his attention can you say amen amen you may be little this morning but or this evening but God loves you and God sees you and God has the power within himself to meet your need amen I believe that friends amen I've got needs here tonight amen I've come to this place uh with a need I'm a needy man you're a needy people amen Mitch needs the Lord there's many of us here that needs the Lord if we can just get his attention we can have our request amen well praise the Lord now many people follow amen for many different reasons they amen mixed multitudes and some are critics and some are fault finders and some are curious and amen and the multitudes were innumerable but there were some who had to touch the thr of God there was somebody that had to touch the golden cup of the Lord Jesus Christ and every time God met their need oh praise the Lord amen are you hearing me here tonight there's a desire amen I'll give you the kingdom is what the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added to me so if I seek him then I know he will see me amen the Press is to move it means to move into a position of contact with something by exerting continuous physical force it means to exert amen to run swiftly in order to catch a person or thing to run after to press on figuratively of one who who is in a race and run swiftly to reach the goal to pursue in a hostile Manner and that's why the Apostle Paul says I'm thankful for what I've got but I'm forgetting those things which are behind and I'm pressing I pressing amen I I'm not there yet I I've not received everything that I that I want I'm not deceived my my my heart there's something inside me that is Desiring more of God there's something on the inside of me that is longing and I am going to press with everything I've got until I reach until I receive until God blesses me oh Church of the Living God who gives you the desire on the inside of you who put that desire for more of God who gives you that it is God who gives you desire and it is God who is going to fulfill every desire that you have need of can you say amen God created you to desire amen daddy told me when I was a kid amen there's going to be Spectators and participators amen that's what he told us kids amen now he says if if you're going to be a participator you're going to you're you're you're you're going to be upfront amen and and there's going to be a lot of people in the bleachers who are who are spectators who are going to find the fault amen they're going to tell you what you're doing wrong what you could be doing differently amen what you could that he says but listen I would rather be in the game than sitting in the bleachers and he says now wendle you're either going to be in life you're either going to be in the bleachers and you're going to be watching what's going on or you're going to be on the field amen and in the game I want to tell you tonight I don't want to be a spectator in this service I don't want to be a spectator I want to be a participator I I've just never got too much thrill amen going and buying amen paying $150 for a ticket uh uh to go watch amen oh you it just never has thrilled me Hallelujah amen I I why why go join amen 100,000 people and amen and they're watching a bunch of you know watching a a football I would rather hallelujah amen I've watched I I've watched Golf and golf is one of the most boring things you can watch on television amen and you're and you watch and you think wow man wow man really good but you see I want to be a part of the game I want to be in the game oh come on church you can set in a church oh yeah we go from revival to Revival to Revival oh my it was a good meeting and amen and this that and the other until we've just become a bunch of lazy folks amen and I'll tell you what you've become you've just become a laysia amen a church member that wants to be entertained I want to tell you God didn't save me Amen to just sit in the bleachers God saved me to be on the field and to be working for him and dedicated to him and find his presence in my life life can you say Amen Let The Spectators eat the popcorn amen let them amen find out what's going on here and going on there amen and and and being The Lazy Boy coach amen but there's going to be somebody who's going to say the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent is going to take it by force I must get to Jesus can you say Amen now there's a difference in being in his presence and coming in contact with him there's a difference well praise the Lord there's a difference in being in the presence well and then the guy is tearing the roof off to come in contact with him there's a difference in the multitudes hundreds and maybe thousands surrounding Jesus the prophet and the woman with the issue of blood a man who had went for 12 years and spent all of her money she had spent every last dime she had she had went to every doctor there was nothing amen else that they could do she grew steadily worse but when she heard amen that Jesus was in town amen just as the others were in town she knew that if she could get in touch with him she'd know that if she could amen if she could reach out amen but there were hundreds around him and the apostles and the disciples were keeping everyone from touching him it seemed impossible but she press somebody say press oh God if we need to press tonight's the night to press if you will press you can receive here tonight amen and she pressed and she pressed oh when the anxieties are there and the fear is there and the depression is there and the enemy is lying to you I say press uh press uh press don't quit but press uh until you reach contact with Jesus amen any manner boy amen woman or girl that's ever come in contact has been saved and healed and delivered can you see M I think we got too many complainers and not enough Overcomers we get too many complainers because we love sympathy sympathy more than we love overcoming we Glory we we we we love to have a than than to overcome the devil God don't want to sympathize with you he's not going to take part in sympathizing with you and your and and and and and the little devil that that he come to destroy the Devil he don't want to make you feel good and a man Pat you on the back and say you know Hallelujah I'll I'll suggest to the to the warden to to to to to paint your jail cell a different color and give you a Fresh coat of paint Jesus came to set the captives free Jesus does not come for you to remain sick or in your bondage he's come to set you free can I hear it amen but you've got to want

too busy to hear your heart's cry can you see man amen turn to your neighbor and tell them you got to want this more than you want anything else Hallelujah desperation causes you to pray Beyond a duty it causes you to reach out well glory to God how many's ever been in a service Heen and it's Just As Dead As Dead can be for everyone else but you come with a need and you come with a desperation and no one else was really touched but you're sitting there weeping and calling out to well come on now Hallelujah and maybe you've been the one that's the critic maybe you've been the one with just satisfied that you got to come to church on a Wednesday night and you're looking at amen someone else sitting beside you and tears running down their face you're wondering what in the world Amen is going on somebody has a desire to touch the Lord oh that's what's the problem with Leonia desire is not where it needs to be desire desire takes praise to another level desire takes prayer to another level desire causes roofs to be amen cut through with axes and saws and and everything out desire tears church services up desire causes prayers to go an hour at a time desire brings you in contact with God can you say Amen Jesus says you want to know how it's done you know how to you want to know how to receive something from the Lord he says there was a I'm going to give you a parable he says he man midnight here come a fell over he had brought his children and his family over from a long trip shows up at at this this man's their friend's house he didn't have no bread they're hungry amen they got to eat something before they go to bed and so he goes over there to the to his neighbor at midnight and he's knocking on the door and the man doesn't even get up he answers from his bed and he said listen my children are in bed I'm in bed I don't want to wake them up I will give you something tomorrow Hallelujah but the ne the Jesus says the neighbor knew he was in there and the Bible says that the man kept knocking kept asking and the scripture says amen there in in Luke 11 uh 11 and S it says he uh he from within shall answer and say treble be not the do is now shut my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give thee and I say unto thee though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs and I say unto you ask and it shall be given seek and it shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone turn to your neighbor and say he's talking to you everyone that asketh receiveth and he that find he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open if a son shall ask thee bread of any of you that as a father will you give him a stone if he ask for a fish will you give him a serpent if he ask for an egg will you give him a scorpion if you being evil know how to give good gifts un your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him press somebody say I'm going to press I'm tired but I'm going to press I'm sick but I'm going to press I'm weary but I'm going to press I'm depressed but I'm going to press I must get the attention of the Lord Jesus Christen it don't matter who's in the audience we seen it in the scripture no matter who was in the audience Hallelujah only those who were willing to press I think of Fanny crossby she says she writes the song pass me not oh gentle savior hear my humble cry while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by go be sung the song tonight savior savior I want you to hear my humble cry I need you I need you oh are you hearing me it's not important that you touch the preacher it's not important that you touch amen a bishop what is important that you touch the Lord It's the desperation of the soul that brings you into the presence of God it's the desperation of the soul that takes you out of the bleachers and puts you on the field it's the desperation of God that will take you from from being just a spectator in a church building Amen to coming and seeking and finding and receiving what you have need of can you say amen hallelujah it's not his presence it's you coming in contact with him while you're in his presence you say it's the atmosphere well that's right amen but a chicken a hen can set on the eggs all she wants but if there's not a fertile egg the atmosphere might be warm amen she may be turning the eggs every every few minutes she might be doing these kinds of things and sitting on until she dies but if she's not coming contact with the mate if she's not come in contact with the male those chicks or those eggs are not fertile well glory be to God oh glory be to God Amen we were given we were giv some jigs y y'all remember Sister Sister Denise amen asking uh about about amen if we all wanted some duck eggs and and so I said hey I'll take those duck eggs amen I used to eat them when we were kids and I I I I wanted I wanted to eat some she says they're fertile I said you can keep your eggs' I'm not going to eat a fertile egg it just they say oh it ain't going to hurt anything I'm not eating a fertile egg and um but I did say but we'll take those eggs amen these duck eggs and so man I went out and bought me bought me a a a a little uh incubator amen one of those fancy things got the motors on it and it turns the eggs and and I and and and spent a lot more than I should have so man it'll it it'll it'll man it'll do it so uh but you but you got to be careful with it you got you got you got to keep the temp just right you got to keep it at 90 minimum of 95 to 100 degrees you've got you've got to have your amen it's got to keep you've got to keep the uh uh humidity right at 50 to 60 it can't be too high can't be too low you got to you got all of these things here and so I was so happy amen so Tina Tina and I we this we were we were just thrilled we were constantly getting a flashlight and trying to look and see if if we can see anything moving and see if there's eggs bouncing around or anything yet and and uh amen and so the time come the time come well amen it was supposed to be 21 days 28 days 28 days of incubation and these these ducks were going to hatch and we were just going to see these little ducklings and the kids were going to have a lot of fun and amen day 17 or day yeah day 14 or something like that sister Sis Sis sister Tina says uh one of the eggs are cracking and and uh I I'm thinking whoa this is a week way too early a week and a half something like that and so amen and and sure enough that thing was just a pecking away and moving away it was a pecking and and and and and out it pokes its head it was a chicken it was a chicken we we did not know the difference between a duck egg and a chicken egg we now know the difference between a chicken egg and a duck egg so we uh so we we were amen so we got U we got one or two chickens the rest rest weren't fertile amen and and so we done all of that work we done all of that work and you know half of them they just they starting to rot and stink and there there was nothing that now we had we had everything set up just right we had we were watching the temp we were watching making adding water and taking water out and everything else just to keep that humidity just right we were making sure the eggs were turned just right that if there's nothing inside the egg there is nothing that is going listen if you ain't God desire if you don't have something in your heart the Holy Spirit can be here the prophet can be here Jesus Christ could walk in flesh here here and you would be just another spectator just as they had in that house amen but if you've got a desire and you come in contact with the holy spirit amen it'll do something in you it'll create something in you you will press because desire is pushing pushing pushing pushing you can you say Amen desire somebody say desire his presence is not enough I don't want to say I'm in his presence I want to say I have come in contact with him amen I want him to know me and I want to know him in the power oh can you say Amen sometimes you say preacher but I get tired I get weary and the Press I press and I press why do I have to press so hard I have to press in my prayer I have to press in my praise I have to press amen

of you that's right but you're pressing amen you're pressing against it's an uphill battle well praise the Lord you aen you say I'm going to you get out of a church service and you say I'm going to fast and pray I I I feel the presence of God I'm going to get closer to God this week than I've got I I amen well glory to God Amen and then when you wake up the next morning every Twinkie you come in

this that the other amen I I you know go to go to Six Flags or whatever anything to keep you and hinder you but I want to tell you there's got to be something that is greater than the basketball game there's got to be something greater than the ball game oh Church of the Living God there's got to be desire and the things of this world is keeping desire this thing hinders desire come on but if you're going to there's only one thing that's keeping you Dylan from that other world there's only one thing that's keeping you from that from Eternal but there's no death where you are face to face with God and the only thing that's keeping you is that Hall of the shell that you're living in right amen and you're finding out how wimpy that old body can be amen his knee amen the oh my goodness it was all swelled up still look swelled up amen but but the only thing that's keeping you from eternal life the only thing that is keeping you right now from seeing Angels the only thing that is keeping you amen amen from from from from I mean walking into the throne room of God right now is this thing right here the only thing that is keeping you in this service from reaching out amen and and and literally amen uh uh uh uh fellowshipping with God here tonight is your mind is your emotions is your feeling is your tiredness come on Church Hallelujah but this is simply a shell that is holding the seed on the inside you're a predestinated seed you're in the you were predestinated for the word image of God you were predestinated I you are predestinated not for this but for that well glory to God am man you're fighting fighting your flesh you're fighting your aches and your pain you're fighting your mind battle Satan has all the dark spirits of Hell against you come on why in this age brother wendle why in this age do we have these why in this age is because this is the time where brother brandham said the darkness amen we're saying and he's referring to science how he says that s that that Darkness gets darker right before the Morning Light it gets the darkness brother Brandon would he would he would he would do it in a drama and he would say all of the forces of Darkness are all gathered around to stop the light from coming forth to stop the birth of a new day to stop you I want to say here today all of the forces of Darkness amen of Le Odyssey has all come in this Cleo and church age it is here to stop amen the light it is here to stop the birth it is here to stop eternity but I want to tell you it is too late I've already been in contact with the mate I've already been in contact with Jesus Christ there is a seed Within Me desire is within me and I am looking to press out of this shell into that glorious Liberty of sons of God can you you say Amen pressing it's a press since I've received the Holy Ghost someone told me I've heard this many of times since I've received the Holy Ghost it's a harder press since since I've come into the message it's been a harder press I'm at I'm at ease I'm peaceful in my heart but it's a press it's a press when I was in Pentecost I didn't have to press this hard but here I am I'm having an depress what's the deal the birth is fixing to take place am now while we were so we got our we we asked sister Denise for some more eggs and there was two requirements they must be fertile and they must be Ducks it just it's just not good for the preacher to be hatching chickens amen and since I can't hatch Eagles we'll hatch Ducks amen so so so we've had those ducks and oh eggs and so amen sister Tina is working hard keeping the keeping keeping the the everything all just perfect and and so right before we're leaving on the trip she says there's a crack in an egg and and she and she looks and and sure enough s uh uh uh that that first put that first FL slide up there sister ke amen there's a there's a there's a little crack in the egg amen and and uh amen you can see that little that little that little hole there in the egg and and we're thinking oh wow amen what now now now there is something that is alive on the inside of that egg there has been somebody that has come in contact amen they're not just sitting on a church pew amen without anything fertile you come in contact with God you become fertile and brother there is hallelujah I don't care who you are what you are what gender you are how old or how when you get something on the inside of you it produces desire well can you say Amen if there's not desire it can be that you're just amen you ain't got nothing fertile you're just dying in the nest but if you whoever come in contact with Jesus Christ and you come in contact that seed will germinate can you see man now you say oh oh that's just so cute but there's a there's a struggle that's going on on the inside of that egg there's a struggle there's something going on there's a there is something that duck is wanting to live that duck has got to come out out of that environment that duck has got to press that duck has got amen it's got it has got to P it has got to do what it takes what is it doing it is opening it it is pressing into another world it is it is been held in this shell but its desire is to leave the shell and to enter into another world Oh Glory to God you want to know why you're pressing you want to know why is because hell is trying to keep you inside this shell but I want to tell you the Eternal Gene seed of God's on the inside of you and there is a cry it produces prayer it produces praise it produces desire brother Brenham would put it this way he would say it's easy to go the way of the world goes it's easy to flow down the stream amen go out there and sit down in the river with your boat go out there with your ores and start pulling against the current you don't you don't make much time it goes hard amen you let the but you will just once let the ores loose amen and watch how fast you pass the trees and going down and look where you're going amen when things are floating easy remember you're going towards a great cataract down there of some sort you're going down the Falls amen it won't be too long until you're over the falls just a floating with the world easy the way it goes amen you don't want that no sir you must accept your responsibility do you believe it amen you think it's the truth amen the responsibility that God has given us in this day to bring this message as I get older my days are are are shortening I feel the responsibility greater than I've ever felt pressing on somebody say pressing on we must do it this last day message has come for a reason to tell us it's the end of society it's the end of civilization it's the end of church it's the end of religion it's the opening of the new day it's an eternal day can you say amen sister Tina seen a picture me a little video I don't I'm not going to play the video but amen the duck pushing with everything it's gotten I mean it's it's working and finally it gets a wing out M Hallelujah and it's feeling the outside show that that next picture there he's got a wing on Hallelujah and he just sits there and he it's it's it's acts like it's dead and then all of a sudden the wing comes out and it's going around and trying then it quits and what is it doing it is trying to get in to the another world it's never been here before but there's a desire to get out of the show come on Church there's a desire to get out out of this shell there's a desire to be what you want to be you will never be what you are inside that shell you can only be in the manifestation of the sons of God Amen and stand under the authority of the word when you stand up and press against the powers of hell that is against you in this age this is the season for the manifestation of the sons of God this is the season for the glory of God in the church this is the season and it requires press can you sayen hallelujah what did the scripture say this is your hour amen amen he says for just leave that up there and I'm just going to read some scripture for I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that should be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same to a hope because the creature itself shall also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the sons of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together unto now and not only they but ourselves also which have received the first fruits of the spirit even we within ourselves are groaning within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the Redemption of our body this is the hour why the struggle because you're want to press through why the struggle I'm want to tell you you've got your wing you got you got your wing in another world sometimes when you come to church you don't see the Holy Ghost You Don't See Jesus you don't see the Angels but occasionally you just you just wave that Wing in that other world and you're saying I feel I know that I'm somewhere oh come on Church you get into prayer and you enter into that that rim with God before you you're thinking this is just this is just a taste of where I'm going I know

y'all understanding what I'm saying is it's worth the Press it's worth the fight it's worth it's worth the struggle it's worth everything you're going through right now it's worth the Mind battles it's worth you repenting when you're wrong it's worth making things right when you make a mess of things it's worth saying I'm sorry amen listen we are all we're all humans we're all in this thing we are all mixed up we're all trying to get out of this shell we're all and I want to tell you amen when the when the enemy comes and you and you and sometimes you do say things under pressure and you do act ways under pressure and you do handle things wrongly I want to tell you there's plenty of blood there's plenty of Mercy there's plenty of God and that Eternal Jean seed on the inside out of you is going to break you forth into a new land a new world where the angels and where Jesus is and there will be no more tomorrows can you say Amen the prophet said now when the church goes up Satan comes down won't you won you won't you do it with me when the church Church goes up the devil goes down Satan has been in those heavenly places the prince of the P of the air amen he's the one that's in those high places in the mind he's but I'm telling you what the hour has come the word has been given are you hearing me amen the mighty angel came down handed that open book Hallelujah gave the inheritance that is your season and I want you to understand that tonight as I close this is your season this is what they have been waiting for since Adam this is the time for the manifestation of the sons of God this is the time that God came down amen no other time in in in in church history or world history where God came down with an open book and handed it to a a a prophet messenger amen and that Prophet messenger delivered the words of life and then the people were to take that book and to take courage and to take strength amen it was their season today is your season brother Bon preach birth pains he says this is the hour he says we've had the first world war we've had the second world war he says you can't face Another World War he says if you do the world's going to fall apart he says when it happens and before it happens there's got to be a bride that's going to give birth to the word a brand new body a brand new land a brand new oh come on church this is your season it's the adoption season it's the son of man season it is the Christ in you ready to birth forth in a brand new body struggle yep is it worth the struggle yep there's something predestinated on the inside of you you can no more fail than God can fail can I remind you what God said about you it it or what your Beginnings remember what your Beginnings were before this o this o shell he says in the beginning when God made man he made him Superior to anything on the earth he gave him jurisdiction over everything on the earth to control everything he controlled the animal life he controlled the foul life the fishes the sea controlled the winds he controlled the plant life he controlled everything man was made as a secondary God on Earth Earth he was given the power to control all things all the elements of the earth that was Adam that was given these Powers these great Powers but he says the power to create himself is where he fell Adam could speak to the winds and to stop it he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife and they obeyed him he could speak to the waters what it was everything obeyed him that's the beginning of man that's what God gave him power over everything on the Earth and though he and through the fall he lost the power he become unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship and fellowship of the father he lost all that and his great channels come clogged up and he couldn't get through and what Adam was in God Christ has come to redeem us back now we're a redeemer to redeem anything is to take us back to the original again Adam never had to be sick Adam never had to die he never had a worry he never had a heartache he never had a fear he just climbed up in the arms of the father just like a child and everything was his and whatever he asked till he got it everything obeyed him because he was God's child the child is a of all things and when he fell he lost this now what what he lost in the fall Christ come as a redeemer did you stop to think what Christ redeemed us for to give us eternal life he brought us back to the Eternal Fellowship relationship to God to be sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall he says now the thing of it is since he has restored man back to this place man in the fall has lost his conscience of what God or the father put him here on this Earth to do in other words all the plumbing as it we in our brain and the outlets and the faith is all clogged up with business Affair and home life and domestic things it's all so clogged up clogged up that until God can't operate through those channels that he made man for when God made the body human body every part of it had its place to play the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose God does everything in there to make it perfect in operation to make man to live and if God so patterned the man the body of Christ how much more has he patterned and set the body of Christ the church can you say Amen do you understand what the prophet is saying he's saying remember your Beginnings remember what you are remember and you've got to push past the business life will fail will will clog up it becomes a shell you become lost trapped inside this shell that shell is not to Define you that shell is never to tell you who you are that shell is not what you are that shell is holding you the shell Satan has put around you through the fall but that shell isn't you that shell is holding you back from that other world and I say tonight through the blood of Jesus Christ we have that power Amen to rise past this amen rise out of this body through the holy goost and go into that other realm you might not see Christ you might not you might not hear an angel but you can reach out and touch Christ with your faith can you say amen amen is it worth the Press well that's who you are it's who you are that's creating the Press preacher can't give it to you mama can't give it to you Elana and I were talking today there's no person that can give give the desire God puts that when you come in contact with him amen so many times we want everyone else to satisfy us and we that's why we go from church to church and we go from place to place and we're mad at this one and we we think oh if I if I get out of this situation over here amen and then that turns sour and then this turns sour everything's all turn you know why the common ingredient is is you show up every place you go and if you are not happy here there's nothing out external that can ever help you but Christ has come when you when he comes and germinates the seed on the inside there's where the peace comes then you learn learn to be content no matter what situation I he says I Apostle Paul says I I I I've learned to be full I've learned to be empty I've learned I I I've been in prison I've been free I I but I have learned whatsoever state I'm in therewith to be content it don't matter where what the circumstance is in this shell that I'm at I've got the seed of God that's been germinated on the inside that's the only thing that can give me peace happiness comes from from here Christ touching here there's where the happiness is and then if you you're in a jail cell the Apostle Paul says I rejoice in my infirmities whether you're it don't matter where you are then you're no longer comparing with yourself with somebody else saying ah I wish I had that family I wish I lived with I wish I had those parents or I wish I had this or I wish I had that church or if I had this position it has no nothing to do with that you are you are here because God placed you here and you're content because you have found your contentment in him you're happy what can you say man desire doesn't come from mama daddy preacher Prophet it comes from somebody coming in contact with Jesus Christ then you are no longer a spectator you have become the participator something has happened in you oh if we could get people off the bleachers and into the game if we could get people from just coming to church and be willing to tear the roof off the place if need be be willing to spend a week two weeks three weeks amen before God Amen whatever it took whatever it took just as long as I got my need met just as long as I got filled with the Holy Ghost Jesus when he was talking about that when he was talking about being persistent and knocking on the door and getting the bread from the neighbor he says your father when when he ends the verse he says how much more will your father give the whole Holy Ghost to them who ask and the Holy Ghost is the thing that people have the hardest time but you've got to press die do what it takes I will do what it takes to together you might look like that dead duck halfway out of the egg amen but you've come in contact with him can you say Amen do you love him here tonight do you want him more than you want anything else but the trials brother wend the circumstances I just God's working on your desire and once that desire gets so right I I I want to tell you there is nothing impossible for God and there's nothing impossible for that individual that gets desperate before the Lord hallelujah been singing a lot of songs about heaven just thinking about those songs as the musician comes and Caleb sung his song tonight I'm kind of homesick for a country a't never been there but I'm homesick you little land I'm longing for you and someday I want to reach your strand there's there's something there there's something in me the rest of the world are talking about heaven but they ain't got no desire they they don't they don't want to leave this place they're satisfied they're trying to make their own life but me and you there's something deep

something you know it's yours you know it's yours healing is yours salvation is yours this salvation of your children is yours baptism of the Holy Ghost is yours your Miracle is yours why because it's
