[40:04] if you have your Bibles with you let's
[40:06] go ahead and we'll turn to Luke chap
[40:09] [Music]
[40:15] 14 Luke chapter 14 and we'll start at at
[40:19] verse 25
[40:40] and there went great multitudes with him
[40:43] and he turned and said unto them if any
[40:46] man come to me and hate not his father
[40:48] and mother and wife and children and
[40:50] Brethren and sisters yay in his own life
[40:53] also he cannot be my disciple and whoo
[40:57] whoever doth not bear his cross and come
[40:59] after me cannot be my
[41:01] disciple for which of you intending to
[41:04] build a tower sth not down first and cth
[41:07] the cost whether he have sufficient to
[41:09] finish it less happily after he ha laid
[41:12] the foundation and is not able to finish
[41:14] it all that behold it begin to mock him
[41:18] saying this man began to build and was
[41:20] not able to finish or what king going to
[41:23] make war against another king sth not
[41:26] down first and consult whether he was
[41:28] able with 10,000 to meet him that cometh
[41:30] against him with
[41:32] 20,000 or else while the other is yet a
[41:34] great way off he sendeth an amassage and
[41:37] desireth conditions of
[41:39] Peace So likewise whosoever he be of you
[41:44] that forsaketh not all that he hath he
[41:48] cannot be my
[41:50] disciple salt is good but if the salt
[41:53] have lost his Savor wherewith shall it
[41:55] be seasoned it it is neither fit for the
[41:58] land nor yet for the
[42:00] dungill but Men cast it out he that hath
[42:04] ears to hear Let Him
[42:07] hear let's go ahead and go before the
[42:10] Lord Lord Jesus we come into your
[42:13] presence this morning Lord and Lord we
[42:15] thank you for allowing us to gather
[42:17] together once more Lord we thank you for
[42:20] uh a beautiful day Lord Jesus we thank
[42:22] you for Lord we just thank you for your
[42:25] presence Lord we lord we come before you
[42:28] and Lord we've worshiped we've we've
[42:30] done our best to to set an atmosphere
[42:32] Lord Jesus and Lord we pray that you
[42:35] would just take control of the remainder
[42:37] of the service Lord Lord that you would
[42:39] just Lord take the the words
[42:43] that that I would speak Lord and may you
[42:45] be the one that would provide the
[42:47] inspiration behind behind everything
[42:49] Lord It's Lord we didn't gather here to
[42:52] to see whether I was able to pull
[42:54] together things and make a nice sounding
[42:56] sermon or make something that would uh
[42:59] tickle our ears or entertain us Lord but
[43:02] Lord We Gather because we want to hear
[43:04] from you and we want to be in your
[43:06] presence Lord Jesus Lord I pray that you
[43:08] would take control Lord and that
[43:10] everything that is said would just be
[43:12] glorifying to you Lord and a blessing to
[43:15] the people we just commit the M
[43:17] remainder of the service into your hands
[43:19] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[43:20] pray amen amen you may all have your
[43:23] seats
[43:33] you know in in
[43:35] life we have to continually be looking
[43:40] at cost versus reward in all of our
[43:44] decisions um is you know something's
[43:47] very simple is the amount of work that
[43:49] I'll be putting in worth the reward that
[43:51] I'll get out of it um is is the
[43:54] enjoyment and the memories that I'll get
[43:56] from my vacation worth the amount of
[43:58] money that I'm going to have to pay for
[44:00] it um is the the new boat or the new gun
[44:05] or the new car or the new computer or
[44:08] the new clothes worth the time that I
[44:11] have to spend to earn the money
[44:13] necessary to purchase them um you know
[44:16] you can look
[44:18] at you can look at the news and see
[44:20] places where people have had to to make
[44:23] those decisions and sometimes they were
[44:24] right sometimes they were wrong um you
[44:27] you know just recently just actually
[44:29] over the weekend we had the news that
[44:32] Israel went in and was able to rescue
[44:34] four of their hostages from Hamas and
[44:38] they had a cost of less than a 100
[44:41] Palestinian lives to get their four
[44:45] people back well Israel decided the cost
[44:48] of 100 lives of the enemy was worth the
[44:51] reward of getting four of their people
[44:53] back all right you know you can look at
[44:55] the news and see that you have the news
[44:57] of California putting up the minimum
[45:00] wage to $20 an hour and now you see the
[45:04] news going on of yeah all the results of
[45:07] that and maybe they didn't do the best
[45:10] analysis on the cost versus reward of
[45:12] what would be the cost of doing this
[45:14] what would be the rewards we would get
[45:16] what would be the problems that we would
[45:17] get from it but throughout life we
[45:19] continually go into situations where
[45:21] you're making these kinds of decisions
[45:23] of is the cost worth the reward is is
[45:27] what we're going to receive at the end
[45:29] worth what we have to go through to get
[45:31] there what we have to to go through to
[45:34] receive the
[45:36] result let's turn to Matthew chapter
[45:44] 10 Matthew chapter 10 and we're going to
[45:47] start at verse 32
[45:57] whosoever therefore shall confess me
[45:59] before men him will I confess also
[46:02] before my Father which is in heaven but
[46:04] whosoever shall deny me before men him
[46:07] will I also deny before my Father which
[46:09] is in heaven think not that I come to
[46:12] send peace on Earth I come not to send
[46:14] peace but a sword for I am come to set a
[46:17] man at variance against his father and
[46:20] the daughter against her mother and the
[46:22] daughter-in-law against her
[46:23] mother-in-law and a man's fo shall be be
[46:27] thy shall be they of his own household
[46:30] but he that loveth father or mother more
[46:32] than me is not worthy of me and he that
[46:35] loveth son or daughter more than me is
[46:37] not worthy of me and he that taketh not
[46:40] his cross and followeth after me is not
[46:42] worthy of me he that findeth his life
[46:45] shall lose it and he that loseth his
[46:48] life for my shake shall find
[46:50] it let's go back to uh the Old Testament
[46:54] we're going to turn to Numbers Chapter
[46:55] 13
[47:11] Numbers Chapter 13 and we'll start at
[47:15] verse
[47:17] 25 and they returned from searching of
[47:20] the land after 40 days and they went and
[47:23] came to Moses and to Aaron and to all
[47:25] the congregation of the children of
[47:26] Israel
[47:27] unto the Wilderness of parin to Kadesh
[47:30] and brought back word unto them and unto
[47:32] all the congregation and showed them the
[47:34] fruit of the land and they told him and
[47:37] said we came unto the land wither thou
[47:39] sentest us and surely it floweth with
[47:42] milk and honey and this is the fruit of
[47:44] it nevertheless the people be strong
[47:47] that dwell in the land and the cities
[47:48] are walled and very great and moreover
[47:51] we saw the children of anak there the
[47:54] amalekites dwell in the land of the
[47:55] South and the h ites and the jebusites
[47:58] and the amorites dwell on the mountains
[47:59] and the CA and the Canaanites dwell by
[48:02] the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and
[48:05] Caleb stilled the people before Moses
[48:06] and he said let us go up at once and
[48:08] possess it for we are well able to
[48:10] overcome it but the men that went up
[48:13] with him said we be not able to go up
[48:15] against the people for they are stronger
[48:17] than we and they brought up an evil
[48:19] report of the land which they had
[48:20] searched unto the children of Israel
[48:22] saying the land through which we have
[48:24] gone to search it is a land that eateth
[48:26] up the inhabitants thereof and all the
[48:29] people that we saw in it are men of
[48:31] great stature and there we saw the
[48:33] Giants and the sons of anac which come
[48:35] of the Giants and we are in our own
[48:37] sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in
[48:41] their sight okay now Israel had come out
[48:46] of Egypt they had come
[48:49] through defeating at that time the
[48:52] greatest army on Earth defeating the
[48:54] greatest people on earth
[48:57] Not By Their Own Strength but by God's
[48:59] Miracles by God's power they had come
[49:02] out and now they come into this land and
[49:05] the spies go in yeah and the majority of
[49:08] them come back and give a report saying
[49:12] oh yeah the land's great but we don't
[49:15] have the strength to overcome it we
[49:18] don't have the strength to take it on
[49:21] and they were able to convince the
[49:22] people
[49:24] that the reward is not worth the risk
[49:28] okay okay yes there was a promise but
[49:31] that promise is actually not strong
[49:33] enough that the reward is not enough for
[49:37] us to be willing to go through this
[49:39] because we think that we will be
[49:40] destroyed when we go in we don't think
[49:42] that we can take this on what we're
[49:44] going to get in the end is not worth
[49:46] what we have to give out what we have to
[49:50] uh what we have to risk what we have to
[49:53] chance we're chancing our own
[49:55] destruction and that's not enough of a
[49:57] reward for us to be willing to to risk
[49:59] our lives for this okay let's go to John
[50:03] chapter
[50:14] 6 John chapter
[50:16] 6 and we're going to start at verse
[50:23] 60 many therefore of his disciples when
[50:26] they had heard this said this is an hard
[50:28] saying who can hear it when Jesus knew
[50:31] in himself that his disciples murmured
[50:33] at it he said unto them does this offend
[50:35] you what and if you shall see the son of
[50:38] man Ascend up where he was
[50:40] before it is the spirit that quickeneth
[50:43] the flesh profiteth nothing the words
[50:46] that I speak unto you they are spirit
[50:47] and they are life but there are some of
[50:49] you that believe not for Jesus knew from
[50:52] the beginning who they were that
[50:54] believed not and who should betray him
[50:56] and he said said therefore said I unto
[50:58] you that no man can come unto me except
[51:00] it were given unto him of my father from
[51:04] that time many of his disciples went
[51:06] back and walked no more with him then
[51:09] said Jesus unto the twel will ye also go
[51:12] away then Simon Peter answered to him
[51:14] Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the
[51:17] words of eternal life and we believe and
[51:20] are sure that thou art that Christ the
[51:22] son of the Living God bless the Lord
[51:26] we see the same kind of situation in as
[51:29] we're watching Jesus speaking to his
[51:31] disciples he had obviously more than the
[51:33] 12 that were following him he had a
[51:35] larger group and the majority of
[51:38] them could not go past a certain point
[51:42] they could no longer make this risk
[51:45] verse reward analysis work they hit the
[51:48] point of going what Jesus has to offer
[51:51] is not worth what we have to do it is
[51:55] not worth continuing to press in and it
[51:57] is not worth accepting what he's saying
[52:00] it's not worth following these words
[52:03] anymore it was great while we were just
[52:06] he's giving us power we're having
[52:07] Authority we're able to do Miracles
[52:08] we're able to do these different things
[52:10] we're seeing Jesus do the healing but
[52:12] now Jesus is saying things we can't
[52:14] understand now Jesus is saying things
[52:15] that we can't comprehend we can't accept
[52:20] and I can no longer go past this point
[52:23] we've now hit the point where I have to
[52:26] turn back I have to walk because the
[52:28] reward that's out there is not worth
[52:32] what I'm going through just like the
[52:34] children of Israel then they looked at
[52:36] it and it was a land flowing with milk
[52:38] and honey just like it had been promised
[52:40] it was the land that they bring back
[52:42] these grapes that it takes two men to
[52:44] carry these huge bunches and all these
[52:46] different things and it's like it is a
[52:48] wonderful land but it's not worth it
[52:52] okay it's not worth what we have to go
[52:54] through it's not worth the trials it's
[52:57] not worth the struggles it's not worth
[52:59] the
[53:00] pain
[53:02] okay you know you go
[53:04] back and in Genesis we
[53:07] have the history of Cain and
[53:11] Abel and we know brother brandom talked
[53:13] about that Cain was religious Cain came
[53:16] and he offered the sacrifice he he he
[53:20] came to worship he came to do these
[53:22] different
[53:23] things and then God came to correct
[53:27] him God came and said I can't accept
[53:30] your sacrifice if you would just do the
[53:32] same as your brother I'll accept
[53:36] it that's all you have to do but yet
[53:39] Cain looked at it and went being
[53:41] accepted by God is not worth me putting
[53:44] down my pride it's not worth me going to
[53:46] the same place as my
[53:48] brother the acceptance of God is Not
[53:51] Enough the promise of acceptance by God
[53:54] is not enough to make make me change to
[53:58] make me take this next
[54:00] step the reward that was there was not
[54:03] valuable enough to him it wasn't enough
[54:05] to make him take those
[54:08] steps you know you can continue on and
[54:10] go to Esau with his Birthright yeah you
[54:14] know Esau comes out of the fields and
[54:16] he's hungry and here Jacob has this
[54:18] pottage that he's fixed yeah
[54:22] and we know the scriptures say that Esau
[54:25] despised the birthright Birthright was
[54:27] not even valuable enough for him to be
[54:29] willing to have the patience to wait an
[54:31] hour while he asked his mom or asked a
[54:34] servant to fix him some food yeah he
[54:37] didn't even have to fix the food himself
[54:39] he could have asked one of these other
[54:42] individuals and waited an hour
[54:46] yeah but his Birthright was not even
[54:48] worth the patience of one hour
[54:52] God the reward that he could receive
[54:55] from this Birthright was was not worth
[54:57] the patience of a single hour to wait
[55:01] for someone else to fix the
[55:03] food it wasn't
[55:05] worth the effort that he would have to
[55:08] put into it all
[55:14] right as we continue in to the Book of
[55:17] Joshua here you
[55:19] have the story of
[55:22] aen and they've come and they've
[55:24] defeated Jericho
[55:27] and you know achen looks and he sees the
[55:30] gold and the silver and and the garments
[55:33] and
[55:35] everything yeah and as is
[55:38] with most of us men his probably was
[55:42] thinking the along the lines of my
[55:44] family could be so much better
[55:47] off you know if you look at
[55:49] it it was 200 shekels of silver weight
[55:53] which is a weight of about 5 PBS
[55:56] 50 shekels of gold would weigh about
[55:58] 1.25 pounds and the value of the silver
[56:02] and gold is more than the average
[56:04] laborer can earn in a
[56:07] lifetime we're not talking about he
[56:09] found a Year's wages we're not talking
[56:11] about he found five years wages we're
[56:14] talking about he found a
[56:17] lifetime the rest of my
[56:20] life I couldn't work to earn this much
[56:23] money okay and it I mean when you think
[56:26] about it then from the mindset it's like
[56:28] it's not that much gold and silver
[56:30] actually it's it's 5
[56:32] lb and 1.25
[56:35] lbs this isn't like he took this huge
[56:38] Heap that's a pretty small pile you 5
[56:42] pounds of gold because gold isn't light
[56:44] so to only have 5 pounds of gold is not
[56:48] you know it's not like he had to cover
[56:49] this huge area with
[56:51] gold to have only or that was the Silver
[56:54] to have only you know a little over
[56:56] pound of gold we're not talking about
[56:58] huge masses of
[57:00] gold but yet this was so much that he
[57:02] could look at it and go my family will
[57:05] be changed for the rest of its life if I
[57:09] take this
[57:10] okay and so the reward that was being
[57:13] promised what God had promised what God
[57:16] had put out there was not worth the risk
[57:19] of giving
[57:20] up what he could solidly go this could
[57:23] change my
[57:24] family there was more value in
[57:27] disobedience in his eyes than there was
[57:30] value in
[57:32] obedience he made the decision
[57:35] on and ultimately it doesn't talk
[57:38] exactly about what his mindset is but I
[57:40] think particularly as men we can go this
[57:42] is probably where he was thinking I
[57:44] don't think that he was going man I can
[57:45] go out and buy the nicest tent in the
[57:47] world and I can you know we can set this
[57:49] up and we can get you know nice big flat
[57:51] screen TV on the side and all this kind
[57:53] of stuff it was he was probably looking
[57:55] at this will take care of me and my
[57:57] family for probably
[58:00] Generations my kids will be taken care
[58:02] of we'll be taken care of maybe we'll be
[58:04] able to be in a little bit better
[58:06] station of
[58:08] society all right but my family will be
[58:11] in a better place all right and I'm not
[58:14] taking much I'm taking a small amount
[58:17] but it'll change things so much and the
[58:21] risk versus reward he saw more reward in
[58:25] dis obedience he thought than the reward
[58:29] that he could see in obedience okay all
[58:34] right you know you go into the New
[58:36] Testament in the Book of
[58:38] Luke the Rich Young Ruler comes to Jesus
[58:41] to ask how he can gain eternal
[58:43] life
[58:45] okay he's searching he wants he desires
[58:50] he knows there's more yeah otherwise why
[58:54] would have even come to ask he knows
[58:56] that there's something he can go beyond
[58:58] and so he comes to Jesus and he asks
[59:02] what must I do yes yes and Jesus tells
[59:06] him okay make sure that you obey the
[59:08] prophets do this do this do this he said
[59:10] I've done all those things for a youth
[59:13] I've I've made sure to to live the way
[59:15] that I'm supposed to I've made sure to
[59:17] obey all the laws I've made sure to even
[59:20] you know obey the oral tradition all
[59:21] these kind of things I'm living the best
[59:23] life I can yeah yeah and Jesus says okay
[59:27] one thing you lack one thing sell all
[59:30] that you have and follow me
[59:32] yeah and it was at that
[59:35] moment yeah that he re-evaluated and
[59:38] said you know what eternal life is not
[59:40] worth my
[59:42] riches the promise of eternal life the
[59:46] the hope that that's what I would
[59:47] achieve is not worth yeah me giving up
[59:51] all of this yeah okay I can now look at
[59:55] it I go you know what I
[59:57] can I don't think it's I don't think
[59:59] that's I don't think that's the truth I
[1:00:01] think I can I can get eternal life a
[1:00:03] different route I can do whatever he
[1:00:05] justified it in his mind but ultimately
[1:00:07] he was making the decision yeah that my
[1:00:10] wealth is worth more than the promise of
[1:00:13] eternal life okay all
[1:00:16] right you know
[1:00:19] Satan still wants to make that same kind
[1:00:21] of argument oh yes he does he'll tell
[1:00:24] you and this is one where he'll tell all
[1:00:28] of us but let's hit the young people for
[1:00:29] a little bit he'll tell each of you that
[1:00:31] you are missing out on things yeah that
[1:00:34] you are missing out on what you could be
[1:00:37] enjoying in life yeah there's so much
[1:00:40] out there that you could go do there's
[1:00:42] so much out there that you could go
[1:00:45] experience you're missing out on life
[1:00:48] you're you're too
[1:00:49] legalistic you're following a man yeah
[1:00:54] and Satan doesn't even
[1:00:56] have to take you fully into the world
[1:00:59] he's not necessarily looking at you and
[1:01:01] going man I want to make you a drug
[1:01:02] addict or I want to make you a drunk or
[1:01:04] I make you whatever he's going look
[1:01:07] there are people out there that are
[1:01:10] Christians that are enjoying life more
[1:01:13] than you yeah all you have to do
[1:01:16] is go out and you can still be a
[1:01:19] Christian you can still worship God you
[1:01:22] can
[1:01:23] still go to church you can can still go
[1:01:27] through all the motions and do
[1:01:28] everything and then look you get to go
[1:01:31] out there and you guys you can go out
[1:01:33] and you can you can wear shorts you
[1:01:35] don't have to wear pants all the time
[1:01:37] you can go out and you know you can
[1:01:39] enjoy some of the entertainments you can
[1:01:41] watch the latest movies or the latest TV
[1:01:44] and not have to listen to a minister up
[1:01:47] here blasting you for daring to do that
[1:01:50] you can go out and listen to the latest
[1:01:53] music or whatever whatever entertainment
[1:01:55] it might be and yet you can still
[1:01:58] worship God you can still go to church
[1:02:00] you can still do these different things
[1:02:04] okay the women they can go out and you
[1:02:06] know what you can trim your hair you can
[1:02:08] try to have the latest style you can use
[1:02:11] a little bit of makeup to make yourself
[1:02:13] look a little prettier look a little bit
[1:02:15] better you can get earrings you can have
[1:02:18] the the latest style that maybe isn't
[1:02:21] quite
[1:02:22] as covering as it should be but it's not
[1:02:26] blatant you don't have to get all the
[1:02:27] way out there you know you don't have to
[1:02:30] wear the super long super flowy skirts
[1:02:34] that are so hard to find that when you
[1:02:36] find a place you're paying 60 bucks for
[1:02:38] a single skirt cuz no one makes them or
[1:02:41] not many do you can go buy the cheaper
[1:02:43] stuff you'll still be covered it'll be
[1:02:46] okay or you know what you can even you
[1:02:48] can just wear pants then you'll be
[1:02:51] covered it's fine and you can still go
[1:02:54] to church you can still worship you can
[1:02:57] still be a
[1:03:01] Christian is the risk really worth the
[1:03:03] reward look at them out there they go to
[1:03:07] church you can even go to a fancy church
[1:03:09] where you get some of these bigname
[1:03:11] people coming through all the time to
[1:03:13] either lead worship or have concerts or
[1:03:16] do the you can get to you can go to a
[1:03:18] nice church you can do all these kinds
[1:03:21] of things yeah and you can still be a
[1:03:24] Christian you don't need to go into the
[1:03:26] world and drink or do drugs or anything
[1:03:30] you still are a
[1:03:33] Christian and Satan puts it out there
[1:03:35] and he wants you to look at it and go is
[1:03:39] the
[1:03:40] cost is the reward worth the
[1:03:44] cost there's an easier way yeah you can
[1:03:48] still be a Christian you can still
[1:03:51] worship God you can still do all these
[1:03:55] things
[1:03:58] yeah you know you can still you can go
[1:04:01] out and do you really need to be going
[1:04:03] to church three times a
[1:04:05] week hey you know Wednesday nights you
[1:04:08] could work a little longer make a little
[1:04:10] more money for the
[1:04:11] family you could go to a church that
[1:04:14] they just do the morning service so you
[1:04:15] could have Sunday evening to spend with
[1:04:18] the
[1:04:19] family that's a good thing spending time
[1:04:22] with your spouse and kids this is
[1:04:24] positive yeah you know you could go
[1:04:26] watch football games too if you want you
[1:04:28] could go do this but you could spend
[1:04:30] time with the family you can do positive
[1:04:32] things yeah instead of investing all
[1:04:35] that time at
[1:04:36] church and you can still be a Christian
[1:04:40] yeah you can still worship God you can
[1:04:44] still do all those
[1:04:47] things is the RO really worth the price
[1:04:51] is the reward really worth what you're
[1:04:54] going through
[1:04:55] and these are the questions that Satan
[1:04:57] will continually bombard you with he'll
[1:05:01] let you look around and see what
[1:05:03] everybody else is doing and see what
[1:05:05] everybody else is
[1:05:07] enjoying okay and there are going to be
[1:05:10] days where your flesh Rises up a little
[1:05:13] bit and you go man I would like to have
[1:05:15] a Sunday evening hour and then to go do
[1:05:18] whatever instead of spent I think
[1:05:21] everyone can probably be willing to
[1:05:23] admit all day Sunday is not
[1:05:29] restful all day church is not restful I
[1:05:33] don't end Sunday going man I am outside
[1:05:36] of my spiritual from the physical I'm
[1:05:38] not going man I am rested I am ready to
[1:05:40] go it's not how you feel at the end of
[1:05:43] Sunday
[1:05:45] yeah if you do I want to know your
[1:05:47] secret because obviously I'm missing
[1:05:51] something and so there are times in the
[1:05:53] flesh where you go man I would like to
[1:05:55] have that Sunday
[1:05:57] evening to rest to relax to do
[1:06:02] whatever and Satan plays on the Flesh
[1:06:04] and he plays on that desire to go well
[1:06:06] this is what I'd like to do man I don't
[1:06:09] the sisters would probably like it if
[1:06:11] they didn't have to struggle so much to
[1:06:12] try to find clothing that worked if they
[1:06:16] could take a little bit easier
[1:06:18] route cuz it's not the easiest I watch
[1:06:22] my wife struggle to try to find she
[1:06:24] finds a place she thinks she can buy
[1:06:26] some and then they come out with a new
[1:06:28] style that doesn't work anymore and she
[1:06:31] has to start looking all over again to
[1:06:33] find somebody else that sells something
[1:06:36] decent I've got it easy I can go to
[1:06:39] Walmart I can go to
[1:06:41] Target I can go to coals I can go to you
[1:06:44] name the store I can find something
[1:06:45] there to
[1:06:48] wear guys got it
[1:06:52] easy but Satan wants to continually tell
[1:06:54] us and put it up there that it's just
[1:06:58] not worth it okay it's just not worth it
[1:07:02] it's not worth standing out like an
[1:07:05] oddball it's not worth struggling to
[1:07:07] find the good
[1:07:09] clothes it's not worth going to church
[1:07:12] three times a week when you could get so
[1:07:14] many benefits by only going
[1:07:18] once I mean those extra hours at work
[1:07:21] that could pay these bills or help you
[1:07:24] get out of debt faster help help you do
[1:07:26] this or help you do that yeah you know
[1:07:28] that time Sunday evening with the family
[1:07:31] it could really it could help me connect
[1:07:32] to my kids better we could have a better
[1:07:35] relationship all these kinds of
[1:07:39] things it's not worth it you can still
[1:07:42] be a Christian and not have to struggle
[1:07:44] so hard
[1:07:48] okay that's what Satan will whisper in
[1:07:50] your head over and over That's what
[1:07:52] Satan will put out there as this is what
[1:07:55] what you can
[1:07:58] do we just read in numbers about how the
[1:08:02] children of Israel decided that it
[1:08:04] wasn't worth it to go into the promised
[1:08:08] land but yet here you have Joshua and
[1:08:11] Caleb that both stand up and they say no
[1:08:15] we are more than strong enough we are
[1:08:17] more than powerful enough we have the
[1:08:20] promise that Land Is Ours we want
[1:08:23] it they looked at it and they placed
[1:08:26] value come on on what promis had been
[1:08:28] given to them they placed a value that
[1:08:31] decried everything else they didn't care
[1:08:35] what they might have to risk they didn't
[1:08:37] care what troubles they might face they
[1:08:39] didn't care how big the enemy was yeah
[1:08:42] the promise was worth more to them than
[1:08:45] anything else that came along right the
[1:08:47] promise was worth every bit of struggle
[1:08:50] that they would face it was worth every
[1:08:52] battle it was worth every trial the
[1:08:54] promise was value valed as more
[1:08:57] yes you know you go to the Book of
[1:09:01] Daniel and you see the three Hebrew
[1:09:04] children and here they are they they're
[1:09:06] brought up before
[1:09:09] Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuchadnezzar
[1:09:12] says worship worship the worship the
[1:09:16] image or you're going to be thrown into
[1:09:18] the
[1:09:19] fire no ifs hands or butts this is
[1:09:22] what's going to happen yeah yeah and in
[1:09:25] Daniel 3:1 16 it says Shadrach mhach and
[1:09:29] Abednego answered and said to the king
[1:09:31] oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[1:09:34] answer thee in this matter if it be so
[1:09:37] our God whom we serve is able to Deliver
[1:09:39] Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he
[1:09:41] will deliver us out of thine hand O King
[1:09:44] but if not be it known unto thee Oh King
[1:09:48] that we will not serve thy Gods nor
[1:09:50] worship the golden image which thou Hast
[1:09:52] set up yeah yeah they looked at the
[1:09:56] situation and they were like we know God
[1:09:58] is able but you know what even if he
[1:10:01] chooses not
[1:10:04] to The Obedience and the reward that
[1:10:07] comes from it is worth the
[1:10:10] price we are willing to sell out our
[1:10:13] lives we are willing to die if that's
[1:10:15] what necessary because we place a higher
[1:10:18] value on that than on
[1:10:23] ourselves they didn't know they weren't
[1:10:25] sitting there with a vision they weren't
[1:10:27] sitting there with you know the Prophet
[1:10:29] Daniel beside them saying you're going
[1:10:31] to be saved yeah they didn't know they
[1:10:34] knew God was
[1:10:36] able but they sat there and they looked
[1:10:38] at it went the
[1:10:41] cost is worth
[1:10:43] it we are willing to pay the price we
[1:10:46] are willing to give it all up if that's
[1:10:48] what's required
[1:10:51] amen we know God can save us but if he
[1:10:54] requires us to die
[1:10:57] fine and we're not talking about this
[1:11:00] being what you might classify as a more
[1:11:04] simple or an easier
[1:11:07] death yeah anyone that has ever just
[1:11:09] gotten any type of burn on their hand or
[1:11:12] arm knows this is not going to be a
[1:11:14] pleasant way of
[1:11:17] going this is not you know it's like you
[1:11:21] hear about those in history and the Dark
[1:11:24] Age of things that were killed by
[1:11:27] beheading that was actually one of the
[1:11:29] better ways to go
[1:11:32] normally if you had a guy that was
[1:11:34] experienced one slice it was done you
[1:11:37] probably didn't even really feel the
[1:11:38] pain it was just
[1:11:40] over death in fire was not a pleasant
[1:11:44] way to go this was not in any way and
[1:11:48] they knew this yeah I guarantee they had
[1:11:52] had to stoke fire sometime as a child
[1:11:54] they had received
[1:11:56] Burns but yet they still looked at it
[1:11:58] and went the cost is worth it okay we
[1:12:02] are willing to pay the price because of
[1:12:05] the reward that is on the other
[1:12:10] side in Acts chapter 7 you have
[1:12:15] Steven and Steven is brought
[1:12:19] before the San hedrin and he's got his
[1:12:23] own trial going as he's talking to them
[1:12:25] and he has this great sermon that he
[1:12:28] lays out to them all all
[1:12:32] right and coming in at acts 7:
[1:12:37] 51 says ye stiff necked and
[1:12:39] uncircumcised and Harden ears you do
[1:12:42] always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[1:12:44] fathers did so do ye which of the
[1:12:47] prophets have not your fathers
[1:12:48] persecuted and they have slain them
[1:12:51] which showed before of the coming of the
[1:12:52] just one of whom ye have been now the
[1:12:55] betrayers and murderers who have
[1:12:58] received the law by the disposition of
[1:13:00] angels and have not kept it when they
[1:13:03] heard these things they were cut to the
[1:13:04] heart and they nashed on him with their
[1:13:06] teeth but he being full of the Holy
[1:13:09] Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven
[1:13:12] and saw the glory of God and Jesus
[1:13:14] standing on the right hand of God and he
[1:13:16] said behold I see the heavens opened and
[1:13:18] the son of man standing on the right
[1:13:20] hand of God then they cried out with a
[1:13:22] loud voice and stopped their ears and
[1:13:24] ran upon him with one Accord and cast
[1:13:27] him out of the city and stoned him and
[1:13:29] the witnesses laid down their clothes at
[1:13:31] a young man's feet whose name was Saul
[1:13:34] and they stoned Steven calling upon God
[1:13:37] saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit yeah
[1:13:40] and he kneeled down and cried with a Lou
[1:13:42] loud voice Lord lay not this sin to
[1:13:45] their charge and when he had said this
[1:13:47] he fell
[1:13:50] asleep Stephen could have stopped
[1:13:52] talking at any point
[1:13:55] M he delivered this sermon they're upset
[1:13:59] they're nashing him with their teeth
[1:14:00] they're doing all these things he didn't
[1:14:03] have to say what he saw when he looked
[1:14:05] up at
[1:14:06] Heaven if he hadn't said
[1:14:10] that he might have just gotten a beating
[1:14:12] and been released he might have had
[1:14:18] whatever but everything that he had was
[1:14:22] the reward at the
[1:14:24] end is worth everything that's right
[1:14:28] okay making sure to declare as clearly
[1:14:31] as I can that Christ is King is worth
[1:14:34] everything whatever the price may be
[1:14:37] whatever the cost whatever I may have to
[1:14:39] face all right when he was being dragged
[1:14:42] out to be
[1:14:44] stoned he could have tried to oh I'm so
[1:14:47] sorry I didn't mean it I didn't do
[1:14:49] whatever he could have done something to
[1:14:51] try to prevent
[1:14:52] it okay but he doesn't he goes on and he
[1:14:57] simply goes Lord may you receive me and
[1:15:00] Lord forgive them don't don't hold this
[1:15:03] against
[1:15:04] them everything that he was doing he was
[1:15:07] going the reward at the end is worth the
[1:15:10] cost whatever it may be that I have to
[1:15:12] face whatever I may have to go through
[1:15:14] whatever yeah pain whatever suffering
[1:15:18] okay and once again just like we talked
[1:15:20] about with the fire Dying by stoning is
[1:15:23] not a pleasant experience
[1:15:25] this is not a quick and it's over this
[1:15:29] drags on and this is pain over and over
[1:15:33] and over right
[1:15:35] okay and yet throughout the process
[1:15:38] there's no recanting there's no going oh
[1:15:40] I was wrong it's fully Lord receive me
[1:15:44] and Lord forgive
[1:15:47] them everything he was facing he was
[1:15:49] going it's worth it okay the price is
[1:15:54] worth it amen for every
[1:15:57] single blow every single stone that
[1:16:02] struck it's worth
[1:16:04] it
[1:16:07] okay you know when when my family and I
[1:16:12] lived in Florida and Alabama one of the
[1:16:15] things that we enjoyed to do a few
[1:16:17] different times for vacations was go up
[1:16:19] to Tennessee into the the Smoky
[1:16:21] Mountains and we would enjoy hiking
[1:16:26] uh we didn't do the hardest Trails by
[1:16:28] any means but we would enjoy going out
[1:16:30] in in the Smoky Mountains and doing the
[1:16:33] different trails and I always liked I
[1:16:34] would get the list of all the different
[1:16:36] trails and the ones that I always tried
[1:16:38] to go towards were the ones that would
[1:16:41] get you to a waterfall if you could hike
[1:16:44] out to be able to see the waterfall that
[1:16:46] was the best trail to go on yeah you
[1:16:48] know there were other trails that were
[1:16:49] pretty cool uh you know we got to go on
[1:16:52] uh I think it's if I remember correctly
[1:16:54] it's klingman Dome is one of the highest
[1:16:56] points in the Smoky Mountains around
[1:16:58] Tennessee we did that hike we did some
[1:17:01] of the others but we went the waterfall
[1:17:02] was always a really cool one and there
[1:17:04] were a couple of these waterfall trails
[1:17:07] that were less than a mile to get to you
[1:17:11] know not not a bad hike and there were a
[1:17:13] couple that were longer that were you
[1:17:15] know 1.3 miles or 1.7 miles or whatever
[1:17:19] it might
[1:17:20] be and you know you would always start
[1:17:22] out on these these trails and there were
[1:17:25] always other people that were out there
[1:17:26] hiking as
[1:17:30] well that
[1:17:32] maybe they would be passing you going
[1:17:35] out cuz they were better trained and you
[1:17:38] know more fit and so they could hike a
[1:17:41] little faster or maybe you would be
[1:17:43] passing people because somehow we were
[1:17:45] more
[1:17:46] fit and then you'd also have the people
[1:17:48] that were passing the other direction
[1:17:51] yeah and I know I remember there were at
[1:17:55] least a few of these trails that you had
[1:17:57] hit a
[1:17:58] point that you started to
[1:18:01] wonder is this really worth
[1:18:04] it okay is is let's be honest is this
[1:18:07] waterfall really going to be that
[1:18:09] cool yeah we've walked this far I'm
[1:18:12] starting to get tired is this really
[1:18:15] worth the effort that I'm putting into
[1:18:18] this is this really worth the struggle
[1:18:21] and the sweat and
[1:18:23] the blister and the whatever else is
[1:18:28] what I'm actually going to get to worth
[1:18:31] what I'm experiencing okay all right and
[1:18:34] occasionally as you were going along you
[1:18:37] would talk to one of the people that
[1:18:39] were
[1:18:41] returning and you would ask the question
[1:18:43] hey is it worth
[1:18:46] it is this really worth what I'm going
[1:18:50] through yeah because you wanted to know
[1:18:52] from somebody that had actually seen it
[1:18:55] somebody that had been there somebody
[1:18:56] that had gone through it and you're
[1:18:58] going is this worth it tell me I need
[1:19:02] somebody to tell me that it's worth it I
[1:19:04] need somebody to tell me that what I'm
[1:19:08] experiencing is valuable enough because
[1:19:11] of what I'm going to reach that's right
[1:19:14] and what I'm going to achieve and what
[1:19:16] I'm going to see yes
[1:19:20] and they would say and they' go oh yeah
[1:19:23] it's worth it yeah
[1:19:25] or occasionally You' get something to be
[1:19:26] like it's all
[1:19:28] right and then you're going well all
[1:19:31] right do I really want to keep going do
[1:19:33] I yeah you know You' get sometimes get
[1:19:35] the people that they were oh yeah it's
[1:19:37] amazing you've got keep going you can
[1:19:40] make it keep going you're going to be
[1:19:42] able to get
[1:19:44] there you know I started thinking about
[1:19:47] along the the lines of this sermon
[1:19:49] because last week when we were in
[1:19:52] Claremore there was a hike to get to the
[1:19:55] bathroom for anybody that was at the
[1:19:56] picnic on
[1:19:57] Saturday it you had to walkways to get
[1:20:01] there and we had walked over to our car
[1:20:05] which is about halfway point between
[1:20:07] where we were eating where the bathroom
[1:20:09] was and Brother Sam Parker was coming
[1:20:12] back and I think it was Luke was getting
[1:20:15] ready to to walk over there and brother
[1:20:18] Sam's like you can make it you're almost
[1:20:20] there you've almost made it yeah
[1:20:24] and it you know it was funny we all
[1:20:26] laughed because it wasn't that far a
[1:20:28] hike you
[1:20:29] know but it made me start thinking about
[1:20:31] was like how often in life are we at
[1:20:34] that point where you just need someone
[1:20:37] to tell you hey it's worth it hey you
[1:20:40] can you can make it you can go a little
[1:20:42] bit
[1:20:43] further and it made me think about these
[1:20:45] hiking trails and when you would be
[1:20:46] going along and we never went to some of
[1:20:50] the waterfalls that were the furthest I
[1:20:52] remember there were some hikes listed on
[1:20:54] there that it was multiple miles to get
[1:20:57] to the
[1:20:58] waterfall and we had kids I wasn't going
[1:21:01] to try
[1:21:02] it I immediately I didn't need to see it
[1:21:06] to me I knew the value was not there
[1:21:09] okay cuz my kids were also small at the
[1:21:11] time it was not I'm dealing with
[1:21:13] teenagers that can hike on their own I'm
[1:21:15] dealing with kids I'm probably going to
[1:21:16] have to
[1:21:16] carry yeah a lot of the
[1:21:20] way going multiple miles to see a
[1:21:22] waterfall was not valuable enough to me
[1:21:26] okay what I could get to was not worth
[1:21:28] the effort that I was going to have to
[1:21:30] put into it all right now if it had been
[1:21:33] just me and my wife maybe I would have
[1:21:34] rethought it maybe it would have been
[1:21:36] like hey you know we're two adults we
[1:21:37] can walk or hike that far yeah but I
[1:21:40] looked at the
[1:21:42] situation and some of those hikes were
[1:21:45] not valuable
[1:21:46] enough other of the hikes like I said
[1:21:49] those were less than a mile or that
[1:21:51] maybe 1.3 miles or something okay we can
[1:21:54] do this we can put in the effort and
[1:21:57] there was enough value at the
[1:21:59] end that I could justify the effort that
[1:22:02] I was putting into it what I was going
[1:22:04] to see or what I was going to
[1:22:06] experience was worth the cost was worth
[1:22:10] everything that I was going to go
[1:22:17] through Satan wants to continually be
[1:22:19] telling you
[1:22:21] that it's not worth it that what what
[1:22:24] you're going to get to and what you're
[1:22:27] going to achieve the reward that you're
[1:22:30] going to get at the end is not worth the
[1:22:33] effort that you're putting in okay he's
[1:22:35] the one who wants to tell you that
[1:22:37] there's an easier way or he's the one
[1:22:39] that wants to tell you there's a
[1:22:40] different route or there's a different
[1:22:42] thing that you can
[1:22:44] do I don't know how many of you have
[1:22:46] read Pilgrims
[1:22:48] Progress but there's this one character
[1:22:52] in Pilgrim's Progress
[1:22:55] that I cannot remember the name right
[1:22:56] off the top of my head but there's this
[1:22:57] one character that jumps onto the road
[1:23:00] by climbing over the wall didn't go to
[1:23:04] the gate that you're supposed to enter
[1:23:07] by and he what did you say the name was
[1:23:11] ignorance so ignorance comes in
[1:23:13] ignorance is willing to just jump over
[1:23:15] the fence or jump over the wall to get
[1:23:17] onto the path he doesn't go by the way
[1:23:20] that he's supposed to he doesn't go by
[1:23:22] the the cross so that he can have his
[1:23:24] burdens lifted or anything he just hops
[1:23:26] the wall and starts going along when it
[1:23:29] comes time to pass the the river of
[1:23:33] death instead of going through the river
[1:23:35] of death which helps wash away
[1:23:38] everything that you've gone through he
[1:23:40] finds a Fairman that can barge him
[1:23:43] across instead of waiting for an
[1:23:46] invitation to come to the celestial City
[1:23:48] he goes up to the city just on his own
[1:23:51] like oh yeah they're just going to let
[1:23:52] me in
[1:23:55] because everything to
[1:23:57] him what he wanted to receive was only
[1:24:00] worth this much of a cost it wasn't
[1:24:03] worth going all the way it wasn't worth
[1:24:06] surrendering completely it wasn't worth
[1:24:09] going all the way back to the correct
[1:24:12] gate it wasn't worth going all the way
[1:24:16] back to the Cross going all the way back
[1:24:19] to where he could have burdens lifted
[1:24:22] and sins covered and sins washed it
[1:24:24] wasn't it wasn't worth all that it was
[1:24:25] worth this
[1:24:27] much but the price to receive what he
[1:24:30] wanted was more than he was willing to
[1:24:33] pay and so he ends up turned away from
[1:24:37] the city because he hasn't come by the
[1:24:39] right Road he hasn't done he hasn't paid
[1:24:42] the price that is supposed to be paid he
[1:24:45] hasn't gone through all the steps of the
[1:24:47] journey that he supposed to go
[1:24:50] through and all too often that's the
[1:24:53] point that Satan is trying to pull us
[1:24:55] into he's trying to get you to go
[1:24:57] through the route of ignorance he's
[1:24:58] trying to get you to accept that hey
[1:25:01] there's a shortcut this Direction you
[1:25:04] don't have to go through a full
[1:25:07] confession to Christ you don't have to
[1:25:08] be filled with the Holy Ghost just
[1:25:11] accept Christ and that's enough that's
[1:25:14] all you have to do go you know go to one
[1:25:17] of these churches and all you have to do
[1:25:18] is I accept Christ boom you're done
[1:25:20] moving on enjoy life
[1:25:22] now you don't have have to do any more
[1:25:25] than that all right you can live just
[1:25:27] this and you're still paying a
[1:25:30] price I mean you're not you're not out
[1:25:32] in the world just doing whatever you're
[1:25:33] still paying a price so that's good
[1:25:35] enough right but you don't have to pay
[1:25:37] as high a price you can go the cheaper
[1:25:40] route you can go the easier route you
[1:25:42] can go the more simple
[1:25:47] way all
[1:25:49] right John 16 and: 33 it says these
[1:25:53] things I have spoken to you
[1:25:56] that you might have peace in the world
[1:25:59] you shall have tribulation but be of
[1:26:00] good cheer I have overcome the
[1:26:03] world Matthew chapter 6 and verse
[1:26:06] 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:26:10] and his righteousness and all these
[1:26:12] things shall be added unto you
[1:26:26] 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:26:28] 9 and verse
[1:26:33] 24 know you not that they which run in a
[1:26:36] race run all but one receiveth the prize
[1:26:40] so run that you may obtain and every man
[1:26:43] that striveth for the Mastery is
[1:26:45] tempered in all
[1:26:46] things now they do it to obtain a
[1:26:48] corruptible Crown but we an
[1:26:51] Incorruptible I therefore so run not as
[1:26:53] un certainty so fight I not as one that
[1:26:57] beateth the air but I keep under my body
[1:26:59] and bring it un into subjection lest
[1:27:02] that by any means when I have preached
[1:27:03] to others I myself should be a cast away
[1:27:07] yeah you know Paul writes and he talks
[1:27:10] about the Christian Life like it's a
[1:27:13] race and I know we've heard so many
[1:27:15] servants talking about what it's like to
[1:27:17] race and you know
[1:27:19] there's it was interesting I think it
[1:27:21] was a few years ago I found
[1:27:25] that there is such a thing as what's
[1:27:27] called Extreme
[1:27:29] racing and there's this one that I found
[1:27:31] that I thought was super interesting
[1:27:32] that it was called the Eco challenge
[1:27:35] it's no longer running now but it was a
[1:27:37] race that ran for multiple years and you
[1:27:40] would have teams that came from
[1:27:42] different countries they would be
[1:27:43] four-person teams they had to be mixed
[1:27:47] you had to have both male and female on
[1:27:49] the
[1:27:50] team could be three in one could be two
[1:27:52] and two could be whatever but had to
[1:27:54] have at least one of both
[1:27:58] sexes and they would do these races in
[1:28:03] super rugged country and there would be
[1:28:05] sections where you would have to do uh
[1:28:08] there was one that I saw where you had
[1:28:10] to first off start off in a boat and you
[1:28:13] had to paddle and sail from one Island
[1:28:17] to another Island no Motors you were the
[1:28:20] motor then you got to this island and
[1:28:22] you had to hike
[1:28:24] however many miles this was and I mean
[1:28:29] it was Miles we're not even talking like
[1:28:31] this is four or five it's like 20 30
[1:28:33] this is or maybe it was even more than
[1:28:36] that it was a big it was a whole lot
[1:28:38] then you get back in your boat you
[1:28:40] paddle to a different
[1:28:42] Island and there you get out your
[1:28:44] mountain bikes and you do a mountain
[1:28:46] bike
[1:28:49] trail that I would never imagine
[1:28:52] touching much less
[1:28:55] biking I mean they're doing when I
[1:28:58] picture mountain biking before I had
[1:29:00] ever looked into this it was like
[1:29:02] mountain biking you kind of had a
[1:29:05] trail they didn't really have
[1:29:08] Trails some places they did other places
[1:29:11] you're biking and you're going where are
[1:29:13] they
[1:29:15] going they didn't get to have any type
[1:29:17] of Technology with them they had a map
[1:29:19] and a compass that was how they
[1:29:21] navigated you would be out in the middle
[1:29:23] of this
[1:29:24] jungle with a map and a compass no GPS
[1:29:28] no going yes I know exactly where I am
[1:29:30] it's no you have to navigate from point
[1:29:32] A to point B then after you finish your
[1:29:35] bike race you get back on a boat you
[1:29:38] paddle another
[1:29:40] section until finally you do one more
[1:29:44] Road Race
[1:29:48] running and they had these different was
[1:29:52] stations that you had to get to and
[1:29:55] there were cut offs if you didn't reach
[1:29:57] a was station by this amount of time
[1:29:59] then you were
[1:30:02] out and I mean they're going through and
[1:30:04] they're
[1:30:06] getting major blisters they're getting
[1:30:08] major body aches they're doing all this
[1:30:10] kind of stuff as they're pushing through
[1:30:12] it comes in there's rainstorms there's
[1:30:15] all these kind of things going on it's
[1:30:17] absolutely miserable forget like the
[1:30:20] idea of doing a 5k or even a marathon
[1:30:23] this is just
[1:30:25] torture and yet people go through and
[1:30:28] they train and they prepare themselves
[1:30:31] and they do
[1:30:33] everything to be able to go okay I have
[1:30:35] to be able to carry this much equipment
[1:30:37] because I have to have food and Waters
[1:30:38] I'm going through I have to be able to
[1:30:41] uh do these different things and I have
[1:30:42] to prepare myself to be able to handle
[1:30:45] this much and I need to be a know that
[1:30:47] my
[1:30:48] team can handle this many miles in this
[1:30:52] much time at this pace and yada yada
[1:30:54] yada yada yada they're doing all these
[1:30:57] different things to prepare
[1:31:01] themselves and I watched this and it
[1:31:04] gave me a completely different thought
[1:31:06] about when Paul talked about it being a
[1:31:08] race I know when Paul talked about being
[1:31:11] raced he was talking about the kind of
[1:31:12] races that the Greeks ran the marathons
[1:31:15] this kind of stuff but I'm watching this
[1:31:17] extreme racing and I'm going I think
[1:31:20] this is more like what the Christian
[1:31:21] Life is we don't get just this a flat
[1:31:24] Road you keep running
[1:31:25] on we're going through every bit of
[1:31:29] struggle that there can be you've got
[1:31:33] the storms coming you've got different
[1:31:36] types of things where you have to do not
[1:31:37] just running but you have to bike you
[1:31:40] have to paddle you have to do this you
[1:31:41] have to do that you're going to deal
[1:31:44] with mountains you're going to deal with
[1:31:46] valleys you're going to deal
[1:31:48] with calm Rivers where you have to
[1:31:50] paddle cuz there's no current you have
[1:31:52] to deal with the Raging
[1:31:54] Rapids you have to deal with this you
[1:31:56] have to deal with that yeah and you look
[1:32:00] at it and I look at these people that
[1:32:02] are competing to do this and I'm going
[1:32:04] who in their right mind thinks that the
[1:32:08] reward is worth
[1:32:11] this I'm sorry I enjoy my food I enjoy
[1:32:15] my recliner I enjoy my air
[1:32:18] conditioning I do not look at this and
[1:32:20] go oh yeah I want to train for that this
[1:32:25] is I had to push myself to train to do a
[1:32:29] 5k with my wife because that was one of
[1:32:31] her big goals in life is she wanted to
[1:32:33] do a 5k so we trained and we did
[1:32:37] one we did
[1:32:39] one I'm not going to say we'll never do
[1:32:42] another one but we did one and that was
[1:32:43] it we haven't done another one since but
[1:32:47] we did it we accomplished one but I look
[1:32:49] at these these types of racism and go
[1:32:52] how do you even think
[1:32:54] this is worth it it's not like they're
[1:32:56] winning millions of dollars at the end
[1:32:58] of this race yes there was there was a
[1:33:00] there was a prize purse but 40,000
[1:33:03] 50,000 I forget what it was but you
[1:33:05] weren't getting rich off this race this
[1:33:07] was not I'm changing my life kind of
[1:33:10] money okay but yet they have put in
[1:33:15] months and years of
[1:33:18] training to be able to go through these
[1:33:21] types of conditions and go through this
[1:33:23] type environment and push
[1:33:26] themselves to the point of
[1:33:32] failing I saw a uh part of my years back
[1:33:38] one of the leadership training things
[1:33:40] that I did with Chick-fil-A it showed a
[1:33:42] a video series that they had produced
[1:33:45] that was based around a uh Georgia
[1:33:49] College and their uh rowing team
[1:33:54] they had a national champion rowing team
[1:33:58] this women's rowing team that they had
[1:34:00] won all the titles they had done all
[1:34:02] these different
[1:34:03] things and they talked about what it was
[1:34:06] to
[1:34:08] row I've you know I'd seen Clips I've
[1:34:10] seen videos I knew what rowing
[1:34:14] was but then you actually start to hear
[1:34:17] about it and look
[1:34:18] into what these athletes put themselves
[1:34:22] through to row a boat
[1:34:26] and I mean these races are generally
[1:34:28] over in a couple minutes these are not
[1:34:31] the kind of rowing they were doing this
[1:34:33] was not a cross the ocean this was okay
[1:34:35] we're doing however many hundreds of
[1:34:38] meters or whatever it was and they're
[1:34:40] done in like I said a couple minutes um
[1:34:43] you know maybe you're doing maybe you
[1:34:45] have one of the longer races that's a
[1:34:46] mile or two once again they still Pro
[1:34:48] they power through these things in
[1:34:50] minutes these are not super long races
[1:34:54] but they talked about how they have to
[1:34:56] train to get to the point where their
[1:34:58] bodies can actually use oxygen at a
[1:35:02] higher percentage rate than how most of
[1:35:05] us can they drill themselves and they
[1:35:07] talk about the fact that when they're
[1:35:11] rowing the muscles start to scream at
[1:35:14] you within the first 30 seconds to 60
[1:35:17] seconds the muscles start to break down
[1:35:21] because they're being torn apart and so
[1:35:22] they start releasing
[1:35:24] whatever the chemical is into your
[1:35:25] system so it is burning it is
[1:35:29] pain the almost the entire
[1:35:32] race you are suffering through this
[1:35:36] entire
[1:35:39] thing and so the goal is that hey
[1:35:43] whatever size the rowing team and I
[1:35:45] think that that particular crew that I
[1:35:47] looked I can't remember if it was a a
[1:35:49] six-man or eight man but whatever it's
[1:35:51] like so you have a team and and we are
[1:35:55] making the goal all eight of us are
[1:35:58] going to suffer together for this many
[1:36:01] minutes to achieve this
[1:36:06] goal that's what we're promising to each
[1:36:09] other is I can bear the pain if you can
[1:36:12] right I can bear the cramps and the
[1:36:16] blisters
[1:36:19] and the sheer Agony of this to
[1:36:24] support those that are on the team with
[1:36:29] me and the prize at the end once again
[1:36:33] these were College athletes they weren't
[1:36:36] getting money at the
[1:36:38] end they didn't get a nice paycheck this
[1:36:41] was before they started paying C College
[1:36:43] athletes this was just great here you
[1:36:46] get a medal or whatever you get a
[1:36:49] plaer that's what you
[1:36:52] get and and yet even then they looked at
[1:36:54] it and they went you know what the
[1:36:57] reward is worth the pain all right the
[1:37:00] reward is worth what we're going to
[1:37:03] suffer the reward is worth everything
[1:37:05] that we're going to go
[1:37:10] through Philippians chter 3 and verse
[1:37:14] 12 not as though I had already attained
[1:37:16] either were already perfect but I follow
[1:37:19] after that if I may apprehend that for
[1:37:22] which also I am apprehended of of Christ
[1:37:24] Jesus Brethren I count not myself to
[1:37:26] have apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:37:29] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:37:31] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:37:33] which are before I press toward the mark
[1:37:36] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:37:38] in Christ
[1:37:40] Jesus amen I ignore all the pain around
[1:37:44] me I ignore all the tests and trials
[1:37:48] because I am focused on this is the goal
[1:37:52] this is the reward at the end and that's
[1:37:54] where all of my focus and all of my
[1:37:56] value is being placed I willing to go
[1:37:59] through anything to get
[1:38:03] there amen
[1:38:10] amen Philippians chapter
[1:38:14] 3 at verse 7 but what things were gained
[1:38:17] to me those I counted loss for Christ
[1:38:20] yay doubtless and I count all things but
[1:38:22] loss for the Excellency of the knowledge
[1:38:24] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[1:38:27] suffered the loss of all things and do
[1:38:29] count them but dung that I may win
[1:38:33] Christ am Revelations
[1:38:37] 12 starting at verse 10 it says and I
[1:38:39] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[1:38:42] has come salvation and strength and the
[1:38:44] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[1:38:46] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[1:38:48] is cast down which accused them before
[1:38:50] our God day and night and they overcame
[1:38:53] him by the the blood of the lamb and by
[1:38:54] the word of their testimony and they
[1:38:56] loved not their lives unto the
[1:39:00] death in the NIV version that last bit
[1:39:03] it says they did not love their lives so
[1:39:06] much as to shrink from
[1:39:09] Death they looked at it and they went
[1:39:11] you know what we can what the promise is
[1:39:14] at the end what the reward is at the end
[1:39:16] is worth it all it's worth my very death
[1:39:19] if that's what the price is if the price
[1:39:21] is me losing this physical life I am
[1:39:24] willing to pay it because there is more
[1:39:27] value there than there is here there is
[1:39:30] more value in the end result than the
[1:39:34] price that I'm paying right now
[1:39:47] okay like I mentioned earlier sometimes
[1:39:49] we go through points in our life where
[1:39:54] we need to hear it from somebody
[1:39:56] else we need to get that little bit of
[1:39:59] encouragement and go is it really worth
[1:40:03] it is it worth the cost is it worth the
[1:40:06] struggle that I'm going through is it
[1:40:07] worth the pain that I'm experiencing is
[1:40:09] it worth the problems that I'm
[1:40:14] facing in the sermon the
[1:40:17] comforter brother brandom says I was
[1:40:19] thinking as Billy there I I held his
[1:40:22] mother's hand my wife wife when she was
[1:40:23] passing away just a few doors below
[1:40:26] where mother is now when she looked over
[1:40:28] and she'd had an experience there before
[1:40:30] she died just a girl 22 years old mother
[1:40:33] of two children and she said Billy you
[1:40:36] have talked about it you have preached
[1:40:38] about it said honey you don't know what
[1:40:40] it is how glorious it is we had just
[1:40:43] found this good old gospel way then she
[1:40:44] said stay with it Billy stay with it
[1:40:47] don't never leave it it pays off in this
[1:40:50] hour hallu brother Brandon was still
[1:40:53] still very young in his ministry he was
[1:40:56] not at the point where he was drawing
[1:40:59] huge crowds he was just starting this
[1:41:01] was the point where he had just turned
[1:41:04] his back on going to preach in the
[1:41:05] Pentecostal
[1:41:08] world and he was going through the
[1:41:11] punishment as he was losing his wife and
[1:41:13] then would lose his
[1:41:14] daughter and his wife as she was dying
[1:41:17] she
[1:41:18] had died and then came back for a few
[1:41:21] minutes or a few moments and it was at
[1:41:24] that moment she's telling her
[1:41:27] husband she's telling
[1:41:29] him it's worth
[1:41:32] it stay with it don't ever leave it it
[1:41:36] pays off in this
[1:41:39] hour it pays off at the
[1:41:43] end in the sermon the impersonation of
[1:41:47] Christianity talking about the same
[1:41:49] situation he says then when I stood by
[1:41:51] the side of my wife hope the mother of
[1:41:53] my my boy billian my little girl Sharon
[1:41:56] and seen her take a hold of my hand
[1:41:57] while her dark eyes looked to me and
[1:42:00] spoke of that place she had just
[1:42:01] returned from and desired to go back and
[1:42:03] told me never fail to preach this gospel
[1:42:06] Billy you don't understand what a joy it
[1:42:10] is to go like
[1:42:13] this and a few hours after that laying
[1:42:15] my hands on the head of my little dying
[1:42:18] baby Yonder placed it in the arms of the
[1:42:20] mother when I said oh God I know that
[1:42:22] you raised the sap in the trees in the
[1:42:24] spring and bring forth the bud and the
[1:42:26] fruit and hide it in the ground while
[1:42:28] the winter is going on you've got to be
[1:42:30] God and I believe with all my
[1:42:34] heart that this phenomena boy that was
[1:42:37] born in Galilee 20 20 200 years ago that
[1:42:42] as he walked around according to the
[1:42:43] scripture to me he was the promised
[1:42:45] Messiah no matter what they say I
[1:42:47] believe it and I know that there is
[1:42:49] something within me that shows me things
[1:42:51] to come that a supernatural being
[1:42:53] appears and I see things before it comes
[1:42:56] and he warns me of
[1:42:58] such but here I am without warning up
[1:43:01] against this thing here there lays the
[1:43:03] mother dead there there is Papa laying
[1:43:07] out yonder and now you're going to take
[1:43:08] my little baby from my arms God are you
[1:43:10] going to do that take my darling and the
[1:43:13] black sheet began to fold before me I
[1:43:16] knew he had done it if the main spring
[1:43:18] hadn't been there Satan said to me now
[1:43:21] what do you think of it even your
[1:43:23] darling little baby he's going to take
[1:43:24] it from your arms how
[1:43:27] cruel that was the new spirit that was
[1:43:29] all the
[1:43:30] intellectuals
[1:43:32] yeah there I stood my bones beating
[1:43:35] together I thought where would I
[1:43:37] go I would go out and get on a drunk and
[1:43:41] you never drank in your life but I'd do
[1:43:43] it anyhow he told you not to but I would
[1:43:44] do it anyhow I'd show him who his boss
[1:43:50] yeah Satan wants to come and go
[1:43:54] it's not worth the
[1:43:55] cost it's not worth the
[1:43:59] price the building of this Tower is not
[1:44:02] not worth what you're going to have to
[1:44:04] pay to get it done the reward at the end
[1:44:07] is not worth what you're going through
[1:44:08] it's not worth what you're experiencing
[1:44:11] it's not worth the trials that you're
[1:44:13] facing it's not worth the tests you're
[1:44:15] going through
[1:44:21] yeah and I said s I
[1:44:24] can't he is the boss it was all down to
[1:44:28] the mainst string I'm so glad there is a
[1:44:30] main spring when I walked up the road
[1:44:31] and Mr Eiser my family gone I was going
[1:44:35] to walk up I I couldn't go to the Grave
[1:44:36] I just walked up the road flood had just
[1:44:39] descending not long and Mr Eiser come up
[1:44:41] the road he jumped out of the car and he
[1:44:43] said Billy I want to ask you something
[1:44:45] I've seen you crying out here in that
[1:44:47] tent I've heard you preaching and how
[1:44:49] you was so enthused on the message that
[1:44:51] you were bringing and you were bringing
[1:44:53] to the people now what does it mean to
[1:44:55] you now do you still love him would you
[1:44:58] still say you would serve him yeah I
[1:45:01] said Mr Eiser if he sent me to hell I'd
[1:45:04] still love him for there's been
[1:45:06] something placed in here see that is not
[1:45:08] no longer I but it's him
[1:45:23] brother brandom received that
[1:45:25] encouragement early on in his ministry
[1:45:27] from his wife saying don't turn back
[1:45:32] don't go away because it pays off in the
[1:45:36] end in the sermon convinced and then
[1:45:39] concerned brother brandom says I had the
[1:45:41] little vision or I don't want to call it
[1:45:43] a translation I never had a vision like
[1:45:46] that I was I was standing up there
[1:45:47] looking at it looking back at myself
[1:45:49] here recently many of you read it in the
[1:45:51] magazines and things friends you can't
[1:45:54] afford to miss that just don't do it now
[1:45:57] there is something there I was there
[1:45:59] just as I am here looking back in myself
[1:46:01] I've had Visions I know what Visions are
[1:46:03] if that was a vision it was the
[1:46:05] strangest one I ever had and I seen the
[1:46:08] people ones that's gone on I seen them
[1:46:10] there the old was young and they were
[1:46:12] standing there human beings just like I
[1:46:14] am only without sin it was beyond
[1:46:17] Perfection Sublime you just couldn't
[1:46:20] mention what it was and when I knew that
[1:46:23] I had to return back there was only one
[1:46:26] thing that I would return to try to
[1:46:28] persuade the people whatever you do
[1:46:31] don't miss it don't miss it don't miss
[1:46:35] it you can't afford to miss it
[1:46:37] everything else let everything else go
[1:46:39] but make ready for that see whatever you
[1:46:44] do brother brandom as he got that
[1:46:47] opportunity to go across the curtain of
[1:46:48] time he comes back and he tells all of
[1:46:51] us
[1:46:53] it's worth it the price is worth it the
[1:46:57] reward at the end is worth any price
[1:47:00] it's worth anything that you go through
[1:47:01] it's worth any bit of pain it's worth
[1:47:03] any bit of discomfort it's worth any
[1:47:06] trial any test any sorrow yes yes the
[1:47:11] reward at the end is worth it Satan
[1:47:13] wants to keep going going asking the
[1:47:15] question over and over is it worth
[1:47:18] it is it worth it is what you're G to
[1:47:21] get at the end actually worth you going
[1:47:23] through this is it worth you making
[1:47:25] these decisions and living a life like
[1:47:27] this you could go you could go the other
[1:47:30] way and you could live like any other
[1:47:31] denomination out there you could go and
[1:47:33] live just like anyone
[1:47:35] else you don't have to go wild into the
[1:47:38] world doing drugs and those kind of
[1:47:39] things like I said you can live a
[1:47:42] Christian quote
[1:47:47] life you could go out and still live
[1:47:50] what pretty much anyone in the world
[1:47:52] would classify is a good
[1:47:57] life and you could take the easier
[1:48:00] road is the cost of what you're doing
[1:48:04] now is the cost of what you're
[1:48:05] experiencing now is the cost of what you
[1:48:07] face dayt day worth it
[1:48:24] brother brandom speaking in said Paul
[1:48:28] Raider how many ever heard of Paul
[1:48:30] Raider though I used to hear him preach
[1:48:32] when I was a little
[1:48:33] boy little did I know that I'd take his
[1:48:36] song only believe around the world when
[1:48:38] Paul was dying out there they had a
[1:48:40] little quartet come down from Moody
[1:48:42] Bible school you know what Paul said to
[1:48:44] a friend of mine when he know he was
[1:48:45] dying he had cancer he
[1:48:47] said if I would have took my message of
[1:48:49] Grace and swed it to the red hot
[1:48:51] Pentecostals instead of come here
[1:48:53] I'd have been better
[1:48:55] off so moody you know Paul had a sense
[1:48:58] of
[1:48:59] humor he and brother Bosworth and all of
[1:49:02] them were just bosom friends Billy
[1:49:04] Sunday brother Bosworth had a meeting up
[1:49:06] there one time in Chicago Raider
[1:49:08] Tabernacle and so Billy Sund been there
[1:49:10] three weeks and he' preached out all his
[1:49:12] sermons and he Paul had been there about
[1:49:14] two years and he was preaching on so
[1:49:15] Billy said to Paul he said Paul when do
[1:49:17] you ever run out of sermons he said when
[1:49:20] I get a kink in the hose and if anybody
[1:49:23] ever heard Paul preach he would start in
[1:49:24] Genesis and wind up in Revelation he'
[1:49:26] he'd preach the whole Bible through
[1:49:28] every time he preach I used to watch him
[1:49:30] he'd take something in his mind he'd get
[1:49:32] way back great big man he he'd pull up
[1:49:34] his trousers you know and here he come
[1:49:35] running as hard as he could and almost
[1:49:36] go over the top of the pulpit like a big
[1:49:38] bear with his hands out but when he was
[1:49:41] dying out there Moody Bible School sent
[1:49:42] down a quart head and they were standing
[1:49:44] there with the shades all down in the
[1:49:46] hospital singing Nearer My God to thee
[1:49:49] Paul raised up and he said hey who's
[1:49:51] dying me or you he said raise them shade
[1:49:53] sing me some some good gospel Snappy
[1:49:55] gospel songs so they began to sing down
[1:49:58] at the cross where my savior
[1:50:00] died and he said where is Luke that's
[1:50:04] his brother many of you know Luke he
[1:50:05] just recently went Luke and Paul were
[1:50:07] two brothers that stayed together
[1:50:08] something like Billy and my son and I
[1:50:10] said where is Luke Luke was in the Next
[1:50:13] Room he didn't want to see his brother
[1:50:14] die said just tell Luke to come over
[1:50:16] here they brought Luke in Luke trying to
[1:50:19] choke it back Paul raised up took hold
[1:50:21] of his hand said Luke we've been through
[1:50:22] many a Battle together haven't we
[1:50:24] brother he said yes Paul he said think
[1:50:27] of it in 5 minutes from now I'll be
[1:50:30] standing in the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:50:32] clothed in his righteousness GL let me
[1:50:35] go like that let me go with that
[1:50:37] testimony like Moody had let me go with
[1:50:39] a testimony like Paul had I have fought
[1:50:41] a good fight I have finished the course
[1:50:43] death where is your stain grave where is
[1:50:45] your Victory but thanks be to God who
[1:50:48] gives us the victory
[1:50:53] in adoption number
[1:50:56] three brother brandom's telling a story
[1:50:59] he said I'd like to be like when old
[1:51:01] Peter was set in the prison there was a
[1:51:04] little boy in there and he was all
[1:51:05] nervous he said oh what's the matter he
[1:51:07] said you know you're going to be
[1:51:08] executed Peter said yep he said well
[1:51:11] you're fixing to die today he said yep
[1:51:14] he said well well aren't you afraid he
[1:51:16] said
[1:51:17] nope he said you must be one of them
[1:51:20] called the Christians he said yep
[1:51:23] said what happened and he told him he
[1:51:25] sit down and told him the story and as
[1:51:28] it went on came down he said and I could
[1:51:29] have been free this morning I could have
[1:51:31] went and joined some of their
[1:51:33] denominations just lived on see I could
[1:51:35] have been free but I started out the
[1:51:36] gate of the city and I seen one coming

[1:52:01] too and now I'm Not Afraid let mine be
[1:52:03] the next one that's right Hallelujah all
[1:52:08] right Isaiah 53 and verse one it says
[1:52:12] who hath believed our report and to whom
[1:52:15] is the arm of the Lord
[1:52:18] revealed every day of our
[1:52:21] life you'll have to answer the question
[1:52:24] is the prize worth the
[1:52:26] price is the reward worth the
[1:52:29] cost no one can answer it for you you
[1:52:33] have to be able to answer the question
[1:52:35] on your
[1:52:37] own sometimes you need to ask those that
[1:52:39] have gone on before to get that little
[1:52:41] bit of
[1:52:42] encouragement was it worth
[1:52:45] it with all the struggles and trials
[1:52:48] that you
[1:52:49] faced was it worth it all right has it
[1:52:52] been worth the pain that you've gone
[1:52:54] through has it been
[1:52:56] worth every step of the
[1:53:04] journey brother
[1:53:05] durren you've gone through a few
[1:53:08] things and you're still going through
[1:53:12] things is it worth
[1:53:19] it with all the he issues that you deal
[1:53:23] with with all the struggles you've gone
[1:53:26] through over the years and I don't know
[1:53:29] most of them I've only heard a few of
[1:53:30] the
[1:53:31] stories is it actually worth
[1:53:37] it we can go through so many of the
[1:53:40] different Elders that are
[1:53:42] here brother
[1:53:44] Ken you've been through a few
[1:53:47] things you've had a few experiences
[1:53:53] and here you

[1:54:07] it you know I
[1:54:12] can I can come up here
[1:54:15] and give you the quotes give you the
[1:54:18] scriptures and I can tell you from my
[1:54:20] standpoint that it's worth it
[1:54:23] I'm still on the younger side yes I
[1:54:26] turned
[1:54:28] 40 and every Elder here's going oh
[1:54:30] that's a young
[1:54:33] guy you know I can stand here and I can
[1:54:35] say with what I've experienced I don't
[1:54:38] know how much more I have to
[1:54:40] go I don't know if the Lord Carri us to
[1:54:42] the point where I'm here at the age
[1:54:44] these Elders
[1:54:46] are but they've been through more of
[1:54:48] life's
[1:54:50] journey and so if you can go to
[1:54:53] them and they can look at you and they
[1:54:56] can say yes it's worth
[1:54:59] it yes every step of the way it's worth
[1:55:03] it every struggle every pain every
[1:55:09] sorrow it's worth
[1:55:12] it it's just like when you're taking
[1:55:14] that hike and you're asking those that
[1:55:16] have gone before and going okay is this
[1:55:18] actually worth it and your elders are
[1:55:21] sitting there and they're they're going
[1:55:23] yes yes it's worth
[1:55:28] it as the musicians
[1:55:33] come Hebrews 12 and verse 1 it says
[1:55:37] wherefore seeing we are also compassed
[1:55:39] about with so great of cloud of
[1:55:41] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:55:44] and the sin which doth so easily beset
[1:55:46] us and let us run with patience the race
[1:55:50] that is set before us
[1:55:55] wherefore seeing we are compassed about
[1:55:58] with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:56:05] amen this isn't a small cloud of
[1:56:09] witnesses this is a great cloud of
[1:56:11] witnesses those that have that have
[1:56:13] already gone on those that are there
[1:56:14] from the other side that
[1:56:16] are screaming at you and telling you
[1:56:19] it's worth it every step of the way
[1:56:23] the elders that have gone through their
[1:56:25] years of Trials and years of struggles
[1:56:27] and are still dealing with their own
[1:56:29] trials and struggles that are now
[1:56:31] sitting there and looking at us and
[1:56:34] looking at me yes as one of the younger
[1:56:36] group looking at the teenagers and
[1:56:39] children and going it is worth
[1:56:42] it yes the devil wants to look at you
[1:56:46] and go there's an easier route the devil
[1:56:48] wants you to accept that I could go out
[1:56:51] and do this little differently I don't
[1:56:53] want to be a manf follower I don't want
[1:56:55] to be wrapped up in what people would
[1:56:57] call a cult I don't want to do this I
[1:56:59] don't want to live a life like that I
[1:57:01] can take the easier route and get what I
[1:57:06] want but yet the elders look around and
[1:57:08] they go it is worth it it is worth every
[1:57:12] step of the way it's worth every step of
[1:57:14] the journey it's worth every pain every
[1:57:17] sorrow every struggle
[1:57:22] [Music]
[1:57:23] yes I can stand here at 40 and
[1:57:26] go up to age 40 I will fully say it's
[1:57:29] worth it I can't tell you beyond cuz I
[1:57:30] haven't experienced it yet I believe at
[1:57:33] this point it's worth
[1:57:34] it but I can look at my elders that are
[1:57:37] going and they're saying yes it's worth
[1:57:39] it yes it's worth the journey yes it's
[1:57:41] worth the struggles yes it's worth the
[1:57:44] [Music]
[1:57:46] pain but I can't answer the question for
[1:57:50] my son I can't answer the
[1:57:53] question for anyone else in this
[1:57:55] congregation you have to answer that on
[1:57:57] your
[1:57:58] own you have to get up every day and
[1:58:02] when Satan throws that question at you
[1:58:04] you have to be the one that's able to
[1:58:05] say yes it's worth
[1:58:08] it he's going to try to get you to
[1:58:12] reason it out he's going to try to give
[1:58:13] you all the reasons why you shouldn't
[1:58:17] he's going to give you the offer of the
[1:58:18] easier route he's going to give you the
[1:58:20] offer of the easier way
[1:58:25] and it comes down to
[1:58:29] you making that decision and being
[1:58:31] willing to fully accept and fully hold
[1:58:33] on to the fact that it is worth
[1:58:36] it it comes down to that seed on the
[1:58:40] inside that will hold you when you can't
[1:58:42] hold on
[1:58:45] yourself it comes down to the fact that
[1:58:48] you were with God from the very
[1:58:49] beginning which means you're going back
[1:58:51] to God the beginning so there's no way
[1:58:53] that you could ever say it's not worth
[1:58:55] it cuz you're simply going back to where
[1:58:57] you came
[1:59:00] from but it's still the same question
[1:59:03] that gets thrown at you every
[1:59:06] day every day is it worth
[1:59:11] it you know what you don't even have to
[1:59:13] go out into denomination you could be in
[1:59:15] this
[1:59:18] church and look like I'm holding on to
[1:59:23] everything but yet outside those doors I
[1:59:26] do whatever I want I listen to whatever
[1:59:29] music or I watch whatever shows or I do
[1:59:32] this or do
[1:59:35] that just because we walk through those
[1:59:38] doors and come into this building
[1:59:39] doesn't mean that we're everything that
[1:59:42] we should
[1:59:43] be Satan can tell you there's an easier
[1:59:46] route of just pretend three days a week
[1:59:49] three times a week it's not even a full
[1:59:50] day on Wednesday you can do three times
[1:59:52] a week you have to
[1:59:55] pretend take the easy
[1:59:58] route you can still be a Christian just
[2:00:02] take the easy
[2:00:05] [Music]
[2:00:07] way God calls us to go the hard way God
[2:00:10] calls us to run the race and God calls
[2:00:14] us to surrender
[2:00:19] everything and Satan keeps asking the
[2:00:21] question is it worth it have you counted
[2:00:24] the cost is it really
[2:00:27] worth
[2:00:29] [Music]
[2:00:31] everything are we going to
[2:00:34] be like Joshua and Caleb that stand
[2:00:36] there and go the land is mine and I'm
[2:00:39] taking it no matter the struggle no
[2:00:43] matter the battle no matter the fight no
[2:00:45] matter what I have to go through it's
[2:00:49] mine or do you take the route of the
[2:00:52] rest of the children of Israel go you
[2:00:54] know what it's not worth
[2:00:56] it the land is good yeah but it's not
[2:00:59] worth that price there's not enough
[2:01:02] value there there's not enough for
[2:01:09] me you have to count the cost you're the
[2:01:14] one as Jesus talked about that's
[2:01:16] building the
[2:01:18] tower is the do is the result result
[2:01:22] worth the price you have to
[2:01:24] pay are you willing to give everything
[2:01:27] are you willing to give it
[2:01:30] all or are you wanting to still hold on
[2:01:33] to no I want to have a little bit of
[2:01:34] control I still want to be a little bit
[2:01:36] of my own
[2:01:38] [Music]
[2:01:40] life you can be like aen and go hey I
[2:01:42] can take my own way cuz this will better
[2:01:44] my
[2:01:45] family I can do this type of Deal or I
[2:01:49] can work extra hours and miss church
[2:01:51] because I'm going to better my family
[2:01:53] with the gold and silver that I can
[2:01:56] get or do we hold on to the promise and
[2:02:00] the Commandments we've been given
[2:02:02] and we go you know
[2:02:05] what the prophet said every time the
[2:02:07] doors are
[2:02:10] open the scriptures say forsake not the
[2:02:13] assembling of yourselves together even
[2:02:16] so much as you see the end
[2:02:20] approaching do I believe
[2:02:24] that or do I think that these extra jobs
[2:02:28] or extra work or whatever is actually
[2:02:30] more
[2:02:34] valuable do I accept the instruction
[2:02:38] I've been given do I accept the present
[2:02:40] word the revealed word of this present
[2:02:43] day am I holding on to that is it worth
[2:02:47] it
[2:02:48] [Music]
[2:02:53] each one of us have to answer
[2:02:56] that brother Wendell doesn't get to come
[2:02:58] up and answer for
[2:03:01] us I don't get to answer for my son or
[2:03:04] for my
[2:03:07] wife I have to make that decision for
[2:03:13] myself and they have to make the
[2:03:14] decision for themselves and each of you
[2:03:17] have to make the decision for yourself
[2:03:19] on do you truly believe
[2:03:23] that the reward is worth the
[2:03:26] cost do you really believe that the
[2:03:29] prize is worth the
[2:03:31] price do you truly believe that it's
[2:03:34] worth your all that it's worth
[2:03:36] everything that you can give that you
[2:03:39] can
[2:03:42] surrender that it's worth skipping the
[2:03:45] easy path
[2:03:49] [Music]
[2:03:56] Lord Jesus we come before you this
[2:03:58] morning Lord

[2:04:56] give
[2:04:57] us Lord you challenge us to to count the
[2:05:00] cost Lord and to make the
[2:05:03] decision is it worth
[2:05:05] it it's the question that Satan asks us
[2:05:08] over and
[2:05:09] over is it worth it and Lord we've seen
[2:05:13] over the years plenty of people that
[2:05:16] have made the decision that it's not
[2:05:19] worth it that have chosen to to turn
[2:05:21] away
[2:05:22] from the message of the hour Lord that
[2:05:25] have chosen to to turn away from
[2:05:27] Christianity have chosen to turn away
[2:05:29] from whatever it might
[2:05:34] be Lord I pray that you would help each
[2:05:36] one of us to examine ourselves Lord if
[2:05:39] there's someplace in our lives that we
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:44] are that we're deciding hey you know
[2:05:46] what it's not fully worth it because I

[2:05:50] I want to
[2:05:52] enjoy this
[2:05:53] part of the worldly
[2:05:57] life Lord may you be the one to provide
[2:05:59] the conviction Lord may you be the one
[2:06:01] to provide the correction Lord

[2:06:15] Lord Jesus to to be able to truly
[2:06:20] declare that it's worth it that every
[2:06:23] price that is paid that every worldly
[2:06:26] pleasure that we may have to surrender

[2:11:59] uh to the to the headship of the word
[2:12:03] and um but it does require a a it it
[2:12:08] requires a decision you've got to make
[2:12:11] that decision you've got to make that
[2:12:13] clear-cut decision I remember the day
[2:12:15] that I I made the clearcut decision amen
[2:12:18] I'm going to kick that TV out of the
[2:12:20] house hey I was you know uh 21 years old
[2:12:24] and and of course we had we had never
[2:12:27] had a TV uh and then you know
[2:12:31] um our leadership uh you know and our
[2:12:34] our church uh um you
[2:12:38] know uh those those hell Visions would
[2:12:40] take you to hell and then and then the
[2:12:43] uh decision was made that we could all
[2:12:45] have TVs and and uh so now it was okay
[2:12:49] to have TVs and so um Mom and Dad wasn't
[2:12:53] going to have it and so uh uh but I
[2:12:56] thought you
[2:12:57] know I I came up here you know we
[2:13:01] started the church and pastoring and and
[2:13:04] I thought you know hey I can so I man I
[2:13:08] moved to television in my house and and
[2:13:11] uh and then I after a while I I began to
[2:13:14] think I understand now why we don't have
[2:13:17] televisions amen the spirits the as a
[2:13:21] Young Man and the things that were going
[2:13:24] on and um and two I couldn't get my wife
[2:13:27] it was it was A House Divided I couldn't
[2:13:29] get her to come over and sit down and
[2:13:31] watch television with me and Kobe was a
[2:13:34] Kobe was a a little baby and and and she
[2:13:37] said my son is not going to grow up
[2:13:39] watching
[2:13:41] television and uh she she said I grew up
[2:13:44] watching television and I don't want
[2:13:46] television in this house and and uh so
[2:13:49] there was a little bit of fre in the
[2:13:51] family and and U amen my wife
[2:13:56] won
[2:13:58] amen and uh but but it was but it it was
[2:14:03] the right thing to do amen I had to make
[2:14:07] that
[2:14:08] decision and um amen and I I I I I know
[2:14:13] and I we've got to make those kinds of
[2:14:14] decisions Even in our homes today you
[2:14:17] know televisions are way I mean that's
[2:14:19] that's te tele television is amen that
[2:14:24] that's a saint compared to what we what
[2:14:26] we have in our homes today uh we we have
[2:14:29] this all this gaming and we have
[2:14:31] somebody needs to make a conscientious
[2:14:33] decision that I'm not going to let that
[2:14:34] gaming in my house I'm not going to let
[2:14:37] that kind of stuff in my house it you
[2:14:39] you you it's it's it's it's Millions
[2:14:42] times worse than a television sitting
[2:14:45] there and and and and being in that and
[2:14:47] allowing our kids in that and we we we
[2:14:50] we're in that all the time uh we're
[2:14:53] we're training those kids for these
[2:14:56] devices I just I think we need to make
[2:14:58] some decisions if we want a closer walk
[2:15:02] with God and we want to have this
[2:15:05] bride's Ministry we're going to have to
[2:15:07] make some decisions here amen Satan's

[2:15:14] attention out of the word it's no wonder
[2:15:16] we we don't know what dedication is
