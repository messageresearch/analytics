name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen let's go ahead and turn to the Book of Psalms we're going to go to Psalms 1 [Music] Psalms chapter 1 and we're going to read the the first two verses to start blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of The Godly ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night you all may have your seats in the church age book in The patmas Vision brother brandham says have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games their sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it they they don't sit there like wild flowers old dried up sticks they enter right into the feet of things and become a part of things but oh how they hate the Christians for getting into the spirit of God's word they call us Fanatics and holy rollers there is nothing they they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it is coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is a so it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasure Pleasures both Christians in the world are human both have emotions the difference is the Christian's heart and emotions are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh so I want to minister a little bit this morning on the Delight of the Lord now in Psalms that we read here but in verse two when it says but his Delight is in the law of the Lord that word delight um comes from uh the word haets which is spelled he PES which means Delight or pleasure let's turn to Malachi CH 1 Malachi chapter 1 and we'll start at verse 6 a son honth his father and a servant his master if then I be a father where is mine honor and if I be a master where is my fear sayith the lord of hosts unto you oh priests that despise my name and you say wherein have we despised thy name ye offer polluted bread upon my Altar and you say wherein have we polluted thee in that you say the table of the Lord is contemptible and you offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if you offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy Governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person sayeth the Lord of hosts and now I pray you beseech God that he will be gracious unto us this hath been your means will he regard your person sayith the Lord of hosts who is there even among you that would shut the doors for not neither do you Kindle Fire on mine altar for not I have no pleasure in you sayith the Lord of hosts neither will I accept an offering at your hand and in 1st Samuel chapter 15 1st Samuel chapter 15 and verse 22 very familiar passage and Samuel said hath the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of the Rams now as I said the the word that was used in Psalms chapter 1 and verse 2 is this word heets and the same word is used in both the verses that we read in Malachi and in Samuel as it's now talking about what pleasure what Delight does the Lord have often when we talk about the Delight of the Lord or we might talk about it as Delight in the Lord we'll be talking about how it's what we should be delighting in and what we as Christians should Delight in the word of God and as it said in Psalms we should be meditating on it but I think sometimes that we don't necessarily take the time to think about what is it that Delights our Lord what is it that that he Delights in as we're serving him I mean when you look at the fact that it's the same as when uh what it should be with your spouses you're going to you want to do what's going to please your spouse you want to do what's going to Delight them yes we may want to do the things that will Delight us as well we're going to want to do things that we enjoy but at the same time if we love that person that's with us we're going to want to do the things that would please them we're going to want to do the things that would bring them joy that would bring them uh enjoyment um and so it's the same thing if we love the Lord if we're really wanting to serve him then we should be thinking about what is it that gives him pleasure what are the things that when he looks down he goes that's good that's something that that that he cares about so the first thing we kind of pull out as we're looking at 1st Samuel chapter 15 Samuel as he talking said hath the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice so what would be one of the things that would please our lord well obedience would be one of the first things that we'd pull out as we go through the scriptures is are we obeying are we doing what he tells us are we doing are we following his instructions are we following his commands or are we going out and doing just whatever we feel like doing well this is what I want to do it doesn't matter what he wants what matters is what I want what's going to make me happy are we thinking about ourselves and our own enjoyment are we thinking about our Lord are we thinking about what's going to give him pleasure and that obedience that we give to him let's go to Micah chapter 6 Mah chapter 6 and we'll start at verse 6 Micah chapter 6 and verse 6 it starts off wherewith shall I come before the Lord and bow myself before the high God shall I come before him with burnt offerings with calves of a year old will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with 10 thousands of rivers of oil shall I give my firstborn for a transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul he hath showed thee oh man what is good and what does the Lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God in verse 7 that when when Micah is asking the question will the Lord be pleased that's the word rasa which is to be pleased with be be favorable to accept and then as he goes on he says what does the Lord require of thee but to do justly to love Mercy to walk humbly so if we're making a a list as we're going through we have what's going to please our Lord the Lord's going to be pleased if we're obedient if we're doing what he says the Lord's going to be pleased when we're showing Justice when we're doing justly when we're showing Mercy when we're loving Mercy for those around us when we're walking in humil humility walking humbly these are the things that are going to please our Lord that are going to make him happy with us that are going to make him proud of us that are going to make him look down and go those are my children that's I'm happy with the way they're acting you the same way that as parents we want to be able to look at our children and go we're proud of them for doing this we're proud of them for acting this way we're proud for the way that they carry themselves we're proud for the character that we see in them and God's pointing out and going through the scripture going hey these are the pieces of the character that I'm looking for in you this is what I'm looking for you to be practicing this is what I'm looking for you to be doing and and and saying and how I want you to be living that's same word rasa is used over in Isaiah in Isaiah chapter 42 starting at verse one Isaiah 42 and verse one it says behold my servant whom I uphold my elect in whom my soul delighteth I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised Reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the Isles shall wait for his law thus saith God the Lord he that createth the heavens and stretch them out he that spread forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that wal therein I I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prisons and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house my elect in whom my soul delight and Isaiah is prophesying about Christ's coming and God is saying this is one that I delighteth in this is going to be the model if you're wanting to live a life that would Delight me that would please me that would make me happy here's the model for you to be living after here's the one for you to be copying here's the one for you to be following this is the one that I delighteth in and we go to Matthew chapter 12 Matthew chap 12 and starting at verse 14 it says then the Pharisees went out and held a counsel against him how they might destroy him but when Jesus knew it he withdrew himself from then and great multitudes followed him and he healed them all and charged them that they should not make him known that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet saying behold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased I will put my spirit upon him and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles this is the same scripture but what you find interesting is when it says my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased they actually in this time as they write it in the New Testament they use a different word in place and so when they use pleased here they use uh the word OKO EU d o k EO which means it seems good to one it is one's good pleasure or to be well pleased with to take pleasure in to be favorably inclined towards one that word continues to be used multiple times as we continue to go through the New Testament if we go to uh Matthew chapter 3 Matthew chapter 3 and verse 16 and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased or as brother brandham explained to us in whom I am pleased to dwell Matthew chapter 17 and verse one and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with them then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him the same word is used again over in Luke Luke chap 12 Luke 12 and starting at verse 32 fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom sell that ye have and give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that fath not where no Thief approacheth neither moth corrup for where your treasure is there will your heart be also let your loins be girded about and your lights burning and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately blessed are those servants whom when the Lord when he cometh shall find watching verily I say unto you that he shall guard himself and make them to sit down to meet and will come forth and serve them and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the Third Watch and find them so blessed are those servants and this know that if the good men of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through be therefore ready also for the son of man cometh and an hour when you think not so it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and then as he goes on Jesus talks about the faithful servant that is there watching that is what there ready that is there prepared that is willing to be working even in the late hours even if the master Waits until the second or the third hour of the day as it gets later and later the servant still awake still watchful still ready to S serve still ready to do the work that he's been called to and in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 38 it says now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him you know as God is telling us the things that he looks for that will give him pleasure he also points out multiple times the things that won't Disobedience and in this he goes someone that will turn away or turn back from what they were supposed to do you know those servants that decided to be lazy and go to sleep instead of watching for their Master to come back or those that saw the truth and then decided no my own desires are more important let me go this way instead of sticking with what I've been told instead of following the path that I've been shown God's telling us that these are the things to do that would not please him and then here's the things to do that will please him and he lays it out in front of us and basically he's asking the question do you love me do you actually truly love me or are you simply claiming it are you going hey I'm I've got the name badge Christian I go to church I have a Bible in my house I do this I do that I've got I've got the Bible downloaded on my phone even I've got it at all times it's right there with me I've got the message books in my house I've got the tapes in my house I've got these take your pick of what it is that would give you the name badge of Christian but are we actually going through in focusing on what actually Delights our Lord are we focusing on what is actually going to give him pleasure what is actually going to make him happy Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 5 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him the Greek word that's used here is the word your esto which means to be well pleasing or to be well pleased with a thing brother Brandon in the sermon only believe he says and you notice when Jesus was crossing the sea the devil knowed that he was on the road to a great win a great victory for God and he tried to drown him that night because a sto caused a storm to come up but Jesus know that God had sent him because he did only what God led him to do wouldn't it be nice if we had a testimony like that Brethren I do only that which pleases God wouldn't that be wonderful like like Enoch walked with God 500 years and had a testimony that he pleased God he didn't have to die just went up so then a little afternoon stroll he just started walking out and just thought well I've been on the earth long enough I'll just walk on up and just started by faith he thought well I've been here long enough so I'm kind of tired of being around here I think I'll just stroll on up till I hit the Milky Way and just walk on up knock on the door so that's what he did see by faith he did it the Bible said so so we just got tired staring he said well I'm just going to walk up home God just went on up through the air walking he did that by faith the Bible said he did and so oh I when I feel death come knocking around my door I want to have that kind of Faith don't you just say well so long old world I'm going to walk away from you now and just start walking on just walk right on up and past the moon and stars and strike the Milky Way and go on up into the Spheres and spheres and out of the Spheres and just go on into Glory that's right what pleases God obedience Justice Mercy humility faith for without faith it is impossible to please him John chapter 8 verse 28 then Jesus said unto them when you have lifted up the son of man then shall you know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me I speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for I do always those things that please him in the sermon hear ye hymn brother brandom says and now we find that our Lord never did anything just at random every move he made was ordained of the father we just go at random but he said I always do those things which pleases the father so every move that he made had a meaning and it was to please God oh I would say here would it not be wonderful if we could have a testimony like that that we always do that which pleases God I was I was talking with my Sunday school class this morning and we've been going through through the Book of Ezekiel for a little bit and we know the scriptures but Ezekiel chapter 9 and verse four it says and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof God calls us and set up the example with Christ that Christ only did that which pleased his father he only did that he didn't do anything of his own will he didn't do anything of his own desires but he focused just on what would please the Lord and when we go back into Ezekiel we find that and brother Brandon preached on this and mentioned it multiple times throughout the message where the Mark was given to those that sighed and cried you know we live in a day in this age of leoda that's lukewarm and it's very easy for us to get comfortable it's very easy for us to be in an environment where this is just kind of the normal as we look around at us and you see the sin all around and you see these different things in the news reports or these different things going on in this city or these different things going on in this country or these things going on around the world and we read the report and we'll say oh isn't that a shame or isn't that terrible and then we'll put down the newspaper or close out the web article and go on about our lives and not think about it again and it's only when something happens that makes it hit close whether it's a family member that suddenly gets embroiled into something that they shouldn't or they chose to leave the message or leave Christianity and go into the world or whether it's a friend or whether it's a coworker or something like this until it hits close we don't find ourselves being driven to our knees we don't find ourselves being driven to a point that we're sighing and crying over it brother random said that that Mark was the holy spirit being placed on them but yet all too often it's so easy for us to get used to what's going on around us you know I remember oh this has probably been I would guess two or three years ago it could be longer now the way time goes but it was two or three years ago they started having uh trans story hours in the libraries you would have this crossdressing person that would come in and they would be the ones to read story time to the children and this was big news like I said in my head I think two to three years ago but it could have been longer by now I don't time passes so quickly anymore and it was such a big thing and there was so much push back all over the world about it but then slowly Things become more and more normal to where I was listening to news article where they were talking about that we just went through June which they call pride month and they were like this was one of the quietest Pride months that we've ever seen does that mean maybe we're starting to make some traction does that mean we're maybe starting to Twin things back a little bit and the commentator that was talking I thought had a really good observation he's like we think it's one of the quietest we've ever seen because it's gotten so loud all the time not necessarily that this particular month was quieter than the month before but we've gotten so loud every month that this one month no longer stands out and it's become so normal it's become part of the everyday take your pick about which type of immorality we're talking about and it's basically the standard I could go out and buy the newspaper from today the newspaper from a week ago and probably find almost every single thing in one of the Articles somewhere because it's just a daily occurrence now it's just standard it's just normal and we get so used to it that we begin to lose sight of the fact that we're supposed to be affected by it we begin to become numb to it because it's around us all the time to the point where you know brother brandham as he described Enoch walking off in the quote he said Enoch got tired of being there it was like you know what I just want to walk on to the Lord and when we're here at church we will say aren't we all ready to go home aren't we ready to leave but if I just show up at your door at your house am I going to find and this is as much to me as anyone if anyone shows up at my house are they going to find me in prayer they're going to find me in desperation going lord it's time to go home it's time to get out of here or are they going to find me comfortable are they going to find me content because I have a job I have a job that I enjoy I have a family I have a wife and children that I love I have a roof over my head I have comfortable Furniture maybe it's not the newest in the world but it's comfortable we're not sitting on the floor we're not sitting on things that are just rough wood we have cushions we have maybe we don't have the most comfortable mattress in the world but I have a mattress I'm not laying on the floor I'm not laying on straw not laying on whatever we have all these Comforts around us even in our day-to-day lives and are we feeling that push that it's time to go home that it's time to leave or are we comfortable where we're sitting are we comfortable with what we're doing brother random talked about how the world would try to creep into the church and the devil would try to creep in to bring little things here and there because it's so normal you know where it used to be that as soon as you walked out into the world if I saw a woman in a dress or a skirt you immediately knew they had to have some sort of standard but if you look in just the last year or two fashion have started to swing around to where some of these long flowy dresses are actually coming back in my wife can find more stores online that aren't being targeted to that they're just this is the standard fashion now it's starting to swing back and you start to get comfortable like oh we can find this easier it's not quite as hard doesn't mean it's easy but it's not quite as hard hard as it used to be to go find these clothes it's not quite as hard as it used to be to do this or do that and we become comfortable we become content when the Lord is telling us you're supposed to be driven towards this you're supposed to have this desire Jesus wasn't going out for his own Comfort brother brandom talked about the fact that Jesus had the right to have a family he had the right to have a home he had the right to do this and do that because he was a man but yet he was willing to give up all that he was willing to give up his own desires he was willing to give up his own wants and he would only do that which delighted his father we begin to lose sight of that because it's comfortable because it's normal the things I was and another one of the news things I happen to be following does anyone remember it was approximately 15 years ago now when the cake maker in Colorado was brought up on charges because he wouldn't make a cake for a homosexual wedding does everyone remember that okay it's 15 16 years ago it was big news the guy's name is Jack something I forget what his last name is but his name is Jack and then they went all the way to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court finally ruled that no he could not be forced to use his creative abilities to make something for someone that went against his beliefs and that ruling was five six years ago something like that now he's still in court there are still court cases against him from more people that have brought charges against him because he wouldn't make a cake for a trans thing and he wouldn't make a cake for this or for that but yet those aren't big news anymore because we've kind of gotten used to it when that first came out it was huge how dare they persecute how dare they go against him but now it's become so normal that it's not big news anymore it's lost in the memory we live in a lukewarm world we live in a world where everything is just becoming normal I found it interesting my on July 4th as my we had watched the fireworks and my wife started talking to me about it and she said for the first time in a long time as she was watching the fireworks she thought about what the Cannons must have sounded like back during the Revolutionary War and how people would have been reacting and it made her think about the people over in Israel that have rocket attacks on a continual basis and where we look at fireworks and we celebrate the color and we kind of even enjoy the noise and all these kind of things like she asked the question like what do you think a child there how are they reacting when they hear this kind of sound off in the distance what are they thinking about and I'll be the first one to say that thought didn't even pop in my head until my wife said something about it and I'm one that tries to follow what news is going on with Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah and all this kind of stuff but yet at the same time it's so easy to look at as well that's happening on the other side of the world that's over there it's not really affecting me it's not affecting my little world of Stillwater Oklahoma and pony Oklahoma those are basically the two places I'm at it doesn't affect me here so I don't have to think about it the news of the baker in Colorado that just makes you go man that Colorado it's such a this kind of state or that kind of state I'm glad I'm in Oklahoma and then you move on about your day and don't think about it or when you hear about this person or that person or this going on in the Sports World or this going on in fashion or this going on in entertainment or this going on politically in this state or that state or in the nation we'll look at it and we'll think about it for a few minutes and then we'll go on about our day but is that what God's calling us to do if God's calling us to be at a point where we're supposed to be we're supposed to have this strong desire to get out of here we're supposed to have this desire to be out of this world then shouldn't it all be affecting us a little bit more shouldn't we be looking at these things and it making us sigh and cry it making us look at it and go Lord how long Lord how much longer we know we're not going to be sitting here praying and going Lord send the Revival that came and went we can be asking the Lord to send the Revival to us Lord let the Revival be in me but I know he's not going to come in and save the nation that's done that's gone but are we passionate am I passionate about going Lord I need more of you I need to get closer to you I need to be living in a way that pleases you I need to have that testimony the same one that Enoch had that God goes He looked down at Harry and was pleased he lived a life that pleased God I'm supposed to be living a life like Christ where I go I do nothing unless it pleases my father I do nothing unless it pleases my savior I do nothing unless it pleases my Lord but we get so w wed up in our normal day-to-day lives we get so wrapped up in our own wants and our own desires we get so wrapped up in going man my car is getting older they've got some really nice cars out there now I don't even get a brand new one get one two three years old look at all the bells and whistles that it has it's got this feature and that feature I remember the first time I got a vehicle I wasn't looking for it the first time I got a vehicle that had heated seats seats and in the winter flipping that on was pretty nice and now they've got seats in some of these cars that not only heat but they will cool I don't have that kind of car I'm not that fancy not yet but they have all these different bells and whistles all these things to make you comfortable you know you can go out and get the fancy beds that you can get them to move so they can have you propped up a little bit or have your feet propped up or do this do that and there's nothing wrong with having that kind of bed I don't know if someone here has that kind of bed there's nothing wrong with having that there's nothing wrong with having the seats that heat and cool but yet every single one of these things is something that is designed to make us comfortable every one of these things is something that is designed to make us satisfied that is designed to put us in a place where we're no longer looking to the other realm we're no longer looking to where we want to go but instead we're going I've got a pretty good life here you know I've got my kids that I'm raising my older ones are starting to turn out pretty good Lord willing they'll stay that way but you start to see some successes coming through you start to go okay Lord you're helping me get through to this point I know I'm in the early stage of it there are a lot here that you guys have had more success than I have you've gone further along that that path but you see these things and you kind of get that feeling of satisfaction we've we've done it we've gone this far we've been able to accomplish this we've been able to do this you know I've got that job where I can bring provide I'm able to take care of my family I've got that home I've got these different things and we become so content and we become So Satisfied and we begin to get L to sleep a little bit and so maybe that's all that this service is about this morning is wake us up just a little bit and remind us are we focusing on what pleases our Lord are we focusing on what he wants are we busy being wrapped up in our own desires and our own wants am I giving the Lord the time that I should am I giving him the attention that I should or am I too busy thinking about what I'm going to enjoy or what I want am I too busy thinking about the book I want to read or the show I want to watch or the new restaurant I want to try or the new vehicle I want or the new this or the new that am I too busy thinking about those things am I allowing myself to be affected by the world around me or if I become numb to it in John chapter 8 the vers we read when it says I do always those things that please him this one is using the word arrestos which means pleasing or agreeable 1 John chapter 3 1 John chapter 3 and verse 19 and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our hearts condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight and and this is his Commandment that we should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave his commandment and he that keepeth his Commandments dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in Us by the spirit which he hath given us John as he's writing here says we keep his Commandments and we do those things that are pleasing in his sight obedience we keep his Commandments Justice do justly Mercy love Mercy humility walk humbly Faith because without faith it is impossible to please him and the patriarch Abraham brother brandom says we realize that in this in doing this it pleased God so well to see that Abraham loved him above everything on Earth even his only son he loved him above what anybody could say what anybody could do he still loved God enough to believe his word all Abraham's seed believes God like that they are believing God and we know that it pleased God so well that here is what he said thy seed shall possess the gates of its enemy thy seed shall possess the gates of its enemy in the sermon hear ye him brother brandom's getting ready to pray and he said says the center aisle to the left would you raise your hands now that you believe that you'd like to take Christ tonight and he be so real to you so real that God would say this is my son this is my daughter oh I'm so pleased in him the way they act and the way they do I'm pleased with it would you want that kind of an experience that the world would say there's really a Christian woman there's really a Christian man as the musicians come when we listen to brother Brandon preach those questions we can still take to heart ourselves do we want it to be so real that God would say this is my son this is my daughter oh I'm so pleased in them the way they act the way they do I'm pleased with it in the identified Masterpiece of God brother brandom says so ought every Christian today to have the same testimony if in this promised word of God if our lives don't qualify and meet exactly what the word said then we have no right to call ourselves Christians if we're not born again Jesus said in Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe say not they may they ought they probably will they shall do it that's the sculpture that made us that's the church that's HED out that's the body of Christ Christ now we find it reflected in him perfectly the sculptor now have the word reflected in the Masterpiece again called his son God Emanuel just think that a person so yielded unto God identified himself in there in that body and he became him and God became one I and my father are one my father dwelleth in me I do that always which pleaseth the father but what if the Christian today could have a testimony like that you would be a masterpiece right here in Yuma on the street let's change that for a minute you would be a p Masterpiece right here in paon right here in Still Water right here in Oklahoma right here in Missouri if you're a washwoman out there behind the wash tub you still be a masterpiece to God when you can say I do that always which pleases God and the whole world can see it the work of Jesus Christ reflecting in you in the Jehovah of Miracles brother random says give us more Marys around here that can take God at his word and praise him whether you feel anything or not take him at his word God's trying to find somebody who will take his word I don't care how you feel someone say well I don't feel any better I went to the meetings I was prayed for that don't have nothing to do with it God said so and that settles it amen somebody who will take his word that's what pleases him believe his word that's what pleases God that's the only way you will ever find fav favor with him is believe his word sister titha if you would just start playing only [Music] believe just believe if you truly believe then you'll obey his word if you truly believe then you'll walk justly if you truly believe you'll love Mercy if you truly believe you'll walk humbly if you truly believe then you have that faith in your life in the unchangeable god brother random says we've got to receive it in the way that God said it God has pleased with it that's his way he's all wisdom he's all powerful he's omnipotent omnipresent oh he's God the I am not the I was or will be but I am forever the same he's God and he does things in mysterious ways ah but he does it for his own Glory he does it because that it's the best to do it that way we must receive it the way he sends [Music] it if we believe God if we truly love him then our goal is to Delight him our goal is to Delight him the same way that it should be our goal is to Delight our spouse and take care of them and meet their needs as Jesus said that he only did that that would please the father so we're called to do only that which would please our Lord that would you can go through the scriptures and you can make a much longer list than what I went through in what would please the Lord are we living the way that we should or are we being rocked to sleep by the world are we actually affected by what we see around us are we affected by the sin around us are we affected as we see the world falling apart does it make us go into prayer does it make us go into desperation with our [Music] Lord or are we lull to where we go well that's out there I've got our little bubble we've got my home we' got the church in Pon I've got you know our church family we're good we're fine but the same thing that creeps into the world out there will will start to creep in here if we're not in desperation if we're not asking for that renewing if we're not asking for that refilling day after day the same thing that's out there will start to creep in here the things that are in fashion or things that are in entertainment or things that are whatever will start to creep in things that maybe we wouldn't have allowed 5 years ago 10 years ago 20 years ago we now go oh that's okay oh that's not too bad oh that's [Music] fine and please don't any of you be sitting there thinking that I'm standing up here going I'm holier than thou I'll be the first one to go I need to do another checkup I need to go through and go is there anything that I've let in that needs to be pushed back out is there anything that's come into my life is there anything that come in that's made me more laxed that's made me more accepted of everything going [Music] around brother brandom talked about and preached about how we have to be in desperation but all too often we let that desperation slip to the side because we are content we are comfortable and that desperation only comes when God sends the trials to us when God sends the problem when God sends the sickness when God sends the Affliction when God sends whatever then suddenly we're driven to that desperation but God's calling us to be there without it he'll send that if that's what it takes cuz he's going to get the bride where she needs to be and if that takes sending trial after trial and affliction after Affliction to get us down on our knees and get us in desperation that's what he's going to [Music] do but yet he put it in the scriptures that we could be doing that all on our own we could have that desire we could have that goal Lord I just want more of you Lord I just want you working in my life Lord I just want to be pleasing to you I just want to be doing the things that will please you I just want to be doing the things that will bring you Joy that will make you proud that will make you happy pick your word of how you want to describe it I just want to be doing the things that will please you I want to be living the life that will be pleasing to you I want to [Music] be in the scriptures I want to be in the message I want to be in my prayer class closet I want to be doing all these things that will please you I don't want it to be where I'm always [Music] comfortable and there's a difference between being comfortable and content God calls us to be content in all things God calls us to be content in the trial and content with what he's provided for [Music] us but he didn't call us to be comfortable in this world he didn't call us to be happy with where we're at we're ambassadors we're supposed to be looking to go back to our country back to our [Music] home Lord Jesus we come into your presence this morning once more Lord and Lord this was just a simple thought that's been on My Heart Lord [Music] Jesus Lord as we've heard our pastor preaching about the gifts Lord Jesus talking about the going through the church age book and going through these different Spirits Lord [Music] that and Lord it's so easy as we're in this leoan age this this age of lukewarmness it's so easy Lord for us to slip into being comfortable it's so easy for us to slip into to focusing on our own desires focusing on our own wants focusing on our own [Music] Pleasures but Lord you you set the example in Christ Lord you said in your scriptures Lord that Lord we're supposed to be dying to our own wants we're supposed to be dying to our own desires and you call us Lord to live a life that would please you [Music] lord lord I pray that you would help each one of us to examine ourselves Lord help each one of us to examine Our Lives Lord Jesus Lord if there's anything that that shouldn't be there Lord that we've let slip in help us to to push it back out Lord Lord if there's anything where we've allowed ourselves just to be laxed we've allowed ourselves to be focused on other things Lord then Lord may we enter into a new dedication to you Lord [Music] Jesus Lord Brother Wendell talked about that those nine spiritual gifts are supposed to be evident in every Church body Lord and that it's Fallen away because we don't really desire it we don't really have that desperation for [Music] it Lord we don't have that desperation to be sighing and crying for the sins that are all around us the sins in the city the sins in the nation and Lord we know that the nation's gone we know that it won't get Revival but that shouldn't make it to where we where we're able to just ignore what's going on around us Lord we should still be in desperation for you Lord we should still be in desperation and we may not be in the desperation for you to send the Revival to the nation but now we're in the desperation for you to take us home now we're in the desperation for us to get everything right so that you can catch us away Lord now we're in the desperation for you to be able to use us like we've never allowed you to use us before Lord [Music] Lord may you examine every heart here Lord may you help us each to examine our lives and our hearts Lord Jesus Lord forgive me where I failed forgive me where I've been too lacked forgive me where I've been too focused on my own desires and my own wants Lord Lord but Lord help help us all help me Lord to surrender more to you Lord and Lord to be able to have that testimony that we only do what pleases [Music] you Lord may you just continue to minister to the hearts here Lord Jesus Lord may you go beyond any words that I could speak anything that I could say because Lord ultimately you're the one who provides conviction Lord you're the one who provides encouragement you're the one who provides peace you're the one who provides everything that we would have need of and so Lord we lay it all at your feet Lord Jesus we just love you [Music] Lord [Laughter] only [Music] believe oh believe all things are possible only believe onlyy believe only believe all things are [Music] Possible only believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I me [Music] Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe let's all stand Lord I receive [Music] Lord I receive all things are possible Lord I receive Lord I receive Lord I receive all things are possible Lord I receive and Jus is here Jesus is here all things are far possible Jesus is [Music] here Jesus is here Jesus is here all things are Poss Jesus is here [Music] you know when we have so many new songs that we've learned and so many new worship songs and they're good we enjoy them but sometimes going back to the old ones I [Music] mean I don't think there's anything that quite Compares with only believe when you sing it and you start to think about all the times that you heard brother brandom singing as you listen to the messages and all the times that you would hear that sung before the prayer line or before he was getting ready to minister [Music] and just [Music] to be able to sing it and brother Brandon would have the congregation singing it and as they're singing he's waiting for their faith to get up to the point where it should be and they're just singing over and over only believe only believe and sometimes they would go for a while it wasn't it wasn't always just one time through or two times through he would let it go for a while and just continuing to sing it continuing to say it over and over lord I believe Lord I believe Lord only believe Lord I believe until finally brother brandom could tell the faith had reached the point where it needed to be and then he would enter in to the prayer line or into the discernment or into whatever it was and we love the new worship songs there are definitely those with a gift of worship that are in this day that are that there are some great songs but sometimes just the simple ones can help increase our faith and help lift us up to where we should be well I hope that that was a blessing it wasn't anything deep or wasn't a shouting or anything like that or exciting but hopefully it was something to give you a little bit further along down the [Applause] road so I know brother Merl mentioned it earlier that sister Kathy's going to be leaving us and going up to Alaska sister Kathy it's been great having you as part of the the body here and we're definitely going to be sorry to see you go I know that you had to with work and everything you were only able to be here every other service or so but we loved having you we'll definitely be sad not to have you here [Music] um Lord willing you'll get to come back and visit at least a few times as we definitely are appreciative of you and your spirit and what you bring and we're very glad to have you a part of us and you will be missed all right so um we've got lunch over at the fellowship hall um we will be having service this evening so be in prayer I don't know exactly what it's going to be I do not have it laid out so we'll see what the Lord does um so if y'all will be praying for me I would appreciate it um brother Merl what should we be singing as we [Music] dismiss I just will in every way to be lost in his presence found in his likeness to hear him say Well done [Music] someday I just want to please the [Music] Lord be in his willing every way to me long lost in his presence found in his likeness to him say Well done so
