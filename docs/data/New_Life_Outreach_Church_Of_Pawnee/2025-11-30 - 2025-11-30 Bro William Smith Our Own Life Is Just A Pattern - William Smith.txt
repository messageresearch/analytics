Praise the Lord. It's good to be home. &gt;&gt; We sure missed you. We uh don't call very much and don't text very much anymore. But when I'm at work, you're asleep. When you're at work, I'm I'm asleep. But, uh, we're just so thankful to be here and and it's good to come and see my girl and my boy and I appreciate Brother Mitch sharing his son with me. But, you know, it's just so glad to come home to people that truly love you. And I know you do. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I've been a lot of places, but me and Sharon call this home. We went to our house. It hasn't sold yet. And did a little bit of things to it for about an hour on Friday. And I said, "Well, dear, this is our little home." She says, "Yeah, but it don't feel like home no more. We don't have anything in it. It's It's empty bare. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when we went by some of you guys' house, we said that's our family right there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we mean it. &gt;&gt; Brother William had to leave the nest to go take care of God's flock. And God has blessed us there. people that didn't have church for a year or 11 years, &gt;&gt; seeing God just work mightily in every one of their hearts. &gt;&gt; The preaching of the gospel does things to Christians. It judges those that aren't Christians, but it makes those that love God grow. And God blesses them. And I've seen God really do a lot in my little flock that God has given me to take care of. Leading them to green pastors and &gt;&gt; and things like that. having brother Josh come preach here not long ago and they're still talking about him and they talk about brother man uh brother Michael that he came and ministered and and just can't wait till they come back again but we're going to have to steal your pastor here pretty soon because they keep asking about brother Windle and they keep saying well you got to bring brother Dur and his lovely little wife cuz we love them and so one in today's days, we're going to get them up there to to minister for us. And but before I start crying, we better get into this message. Before I start crying, if we can open our Bibles to Ephesians 2, we're going to Ephesians 2, 1 Corinthians 12, and Luke 4. Praise the Lord. Just want you to know we love you very much. and those that couldn't be here tonight and out of town, please tell them that we sure do love them and miss them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But here in Ephesians 2, and we're going to start here at the 19th verse, and before we read, let's just pray and ask the Lord to help me. Heavenly Father, we just love you, Lord. And Lord, we tired, Lord, and been up since around 5 or 4:00 this morning, Lord. And we just ask you, Father God, to help me to get out of the way and you strengthen this body just enough to be able to speak through it, Father God. Lord, I pray that you bless each and every heart that's in this building this this evening, Lord. those that are on the internet, Lord. We just pray that you bless them, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, just take these words of life, Lord, and multiply it into your children, Lord, and move me out of the way, Lord, and just use me, Father, for your glory. Let me say what you want me to say, Lord. And Lord, we just ask you, Lord. Brother Sam's, Lord, this morning, Lord, you came down in a mighty way. And Lord, there was five or six people that came up and one young man that got on his face, Lord, and cried out to the Lord Jesus. And Lord, I believe you gave him victory over some things that was going into his life, Lord. And Lord, those that Father God, that came up with problems and situations, Lord, and we prayed for them. We just ask you to be with them, Father God, this evening. We know how the devil goes after a service, Lord, and goes out and starts attacking their their bodies and their minds. And we just ask you to comfort them tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Give them rest, Lord. Give us all rest in the name of the Lord. We thank you for everything you do for us Lord and help me Lord to say the right words the right way. Father God we love you in Jesus name. Amen. Here in Ephesians 2 and 19, it says, "Now therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God, and are built up the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself, being chief corner stone, and whom all all The building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are built together for a inhabitant of God through the spirit. Let's go to 1 Corinthians 12 and we're going to start at the 11th verse there. But all these workketh that one in the same self-same spirit, dividing to every man several as he will. For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body. So also is Christ. For by one spear are we all baptized unto one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we'd be bound or free, and having been all made to drink into one spirit. For the body is not one member, but many. Let's go to Luke 4 and4. And Jesus answered him, saying, "It is written, that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." You may be seated. I would like to minister for just a little while on your own life is just a pattern. I looked up pattern and I looked up and it talks about pattern and it talks about the blueprint. And so it means a and and it's just to me as as a builder at one time and getting the blueprints and you see this building from ground level to the time it finishes to the roof and and then all the appliances and and the bathroom stuff and everything when it's completed for somebody that can move into it. It's amazing to see it's on the blueprint. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Even the faucets are in the blueprint. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The grout is in the blueprint. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we go by the blueprint, it will be exactly the house will be exactly what the house is going to look like of the blueprint. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes. &gt;&gt; And it's the same way. If we read the book and we eat the book and we become the book, we're going to look just like Jesus. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters. That's what has to be in our hearts this evening is to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; We want him to run our lives. We want him to give us the grace to love one another and do things together. And not only that, to show the fruits to those that need a Jesus. You are going to be a Jesus to them. If you can realize it and don't let the world put put something on you, but you put it on the PEOPLE THAT JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, and forever. And he's taken me out OF THE BALLROOM. HE'S TAKEN THE DRUGS FROM ME. HE'S DONE THESE things because what did I do? I STAYED WITH THE PATTERN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. If you go off the pattern, YOUR HOUSE IS GOING TO FALL. &gt;&gt; If the foundation is isn't right, it's going to fall. &gt;&gt; But oh, if we can stay on that pattern, &gt;&gt; oh, something is good going to fixing to happen. &gt;&gt; So, in the dictionary, I looked and it says design used as a guide or establishes the way of doing things, a blueprint, plans or design for creating something. blueprint is a detailed plan. This Bible is a this thing right here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Has a plan for you. &gt;&gt; You're in the plan. &gt;&gt; You just got to find yourself where you're at. &gt;&gt; Are you an antichrist or are you the bride of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; You got to go in there and find out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you taking the creeds or you taking thus sayith the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God had a thought of life. So, he spoke the word of things to existence. He had a great plan and he was making himself a place and a family to love and to have. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; He wasn't up in in space somewhere thinking of himself. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He never looked at himself. He knew who he was, but he wanted you to be a part of a family. &gt;&gt; He wanted to choose you to be a part OF A BODY THAT GOD CAN COME DOWN AND USE SUPERNATURALLY. Somebody that is a sinful and sinful flesh that he can change in a moment, in a twinkle OF AN EYE, NOT WAITING FOR A BODY CHANGE, BUT CHANGING THAT MAN AND WOMAN AS THEY'RE LIVING AND BEING an absence. abstract I can't even say the word an abstract I can't say it never mind &gt;&gt; but here we are we're standing in the presence of the almighty God &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; we don't have to worry about anything else he comes and lives INSIDE OF YOU HE'S NOT IN HEAVEN HE'S SP HE'S EVERYWHERE BUT HE WANTS TO PUT A PART OF HIM IN you &gt;&gt; he wants YOU TO BE MINIATURE GODS HE WANTS WANTS YOU TO TELL THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE WORD OF GOD. AND LISTEN, CHURCH, I don't want to get people up for uproar. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you something. Brother Brandham, it's over for him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. &gt;&gt; We have people saying, "Brother Brandon, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "WHAT ABOUT YOU?" &gt;&gt; DID YOU EAT THE SAME BOOK? &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO SAY, "I SAY THE BIBLE SAYS Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, AND FOREVER." &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE PERSONAL. IT WAS PERSONAL TO BROTHER WENDELL. IT'S PERSONAL TO BROTHER BRANDHAM. BUT SEE, IT HAS TO BE IMPERSONAL TO YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT BEFORE YOU CAN GET UP OUT of that seat, you'll be healed. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO STAY WITH THE PATTERN. YOU GOT TO STAY WITH THE BLESSINGS. ANYTHING CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD IS NOT GOING TO BE A BLESSING. It's going to make you cause yourself harm. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. If you live into sin, it's going to take you farther away and you're not going to like it. But if we stay in the pattern, not under some because I am somebody. But the grace of God called you to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't condemn no one. HE GAVE EVERYBODY THE opportunity to come to the word. &gt;&gt; He loved them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He loved them same ONES THAT HE WALKED BY AND didn't heal them. They had to pick up their own cross. &gt;&gt; But he went to THE ONE THE FATHER TOLD HIM TO GO TO. AND TODAY, GOD HAD COME TO A PEOPLE OUT OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT'S ON THE EARTH. HE'S PASSED THEM TO COME TO YOU TO GIVE YOU ETERNAL LIFE AND BE A PART OF A BRIDE THAT YOU CAN LIVE FOREVER AND EVER AND GO TO HEAVEN AND BE A PART OF SOMETHING GREAT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You're in the plan of God this morning, this evening. I mean, &gt;&gt; and in this place that we're living TODAY IS THE GREATEST PLACE TO START TO PROVE TO THE DEVIL THAT WE CAN LIVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Like Christians. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God planned a planned a pattern a way for us. &gt;&gt; But God created heaven and earth and the sea and all the seas. Divided the light and the darkness. He made morning day and evening night. Made all the beasts of the earth. Created man and female. Great plan of God. Did you understand? And he said all these others, but then right there at the moment, he's a great plan of God by what? Creating man and female. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SPECIAL, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; HE WENT DOWN INTO A RIB AND HE CALLED YOUR NAME. HE CALLED YOU TO COME FORTH. HE CALLED YOU TO COME THROUGH A PATTERN THAT GOD CAN MAKE SOMETHING good in your life. &gt;&gt; Okay? We need to quit thinking. We need to start believing from here. &gt;&gt; Because when we believe from here, things move, things change, &gt;&gt; victory's coming, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; THROUGH ALL THE TRIALS THAT YOU GO THROUGH, LISTEN CHURCH, IF YOU'RE LISTENING THROUGH THE CHURCH AGES, IT SHOWS A PATTERN. &gt;&gt; EVERY CHURCH AGE MESSENGER STARTED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WITH PAUL. THEY TOOK SOMETHING OUT OF PAUL'S MESSAGE AND BROUGHT A PEOPLE OUT FOR THEIR DAY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T THEY DIDN'T CHANGE NOTHING. THEY DIDN'T ADD NOTHING. THEY STAYED WITH THE PATTERN OF GOD BECAUSE THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS Paul was the man. HE WAS THE ONE. THE PATTERN COME FROM HIM. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; FOR THE CHURCH AGES, WE HAD TO HAVE A WORD THAT WAS IN PENTECOST. AND THAT PENTECOST WAS GOD'S WAY OF SHOWING us &gt;&gt; the true word, the true baptism of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; how to be baptized, right? How to see God do things. &gt;&gt; Because he was creating a family. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; As I was telling the church this morning, there's three kinds of believers in every church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which one are you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Are you an unbeliever? &gt;&gt; Are you a makebeliever? Or are you the real believer? &gt;&gt; Because remember, God has anointed all three. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Every teacher &gt;&gt; is anointed by God. False or good. Brother Anne says they asked brother says if is that anointing that comes does it fall on the unjust? He said absolutely. Bible talks about it. The rain falls on the unjust and the just. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He goes the Holy Spirit anoints everyone. What? Everyone. &gt;&gt; Right. It's a pattern. &gt;&gt; SATAN HAD A PATTERN HE HAS TO FOLLOW. &gt;&gt; HE CAN'T JUST COME AND TORMENT YOU EVERY moment in the twinkle of an eye if God didn't let him. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; He's there TO TRIM YOUR WOOD. HE'S THERE TO TRIM YOU UP TO GET YOU A PLACE TO SAY YES LORD OR NO GOD. BUT SEE, THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN INSIDE OF YOUR SOUL THAT IT GOES TO GOD. AND HE LET IT SIT THERE FOR MANY YEARS UNTIL IT COME FORTH. AND THEN THE WORD come and what did it do? It watered it and it came to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if God brings it to life, no man can TAKE IT OUT. &gt;&gt; NO MAN CAN TAKE YOU AWAY FROM GOD. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS WORLD THAT CAN TAKE YOU AWAY FROM GOD. YOU ARE SEED FORMED IN the presence of God at one time. But that seed starts growing and it will produce exactly to the father, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And who's your father? Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But this pattern has to be dealt with in your heart, &gt;&gt; you've got to make a decision. Am I going to stay with the word or I'm going to stay with what I think? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; When you think, that's when you get in trouble. That's when brother William gets in trouble when I think. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You just ask my wife. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When I think too hard, &gt;&gt; she tells me about it. Why? Cuz she's my partner. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; She doesn't want me to say things that's not right. &gt;&gt; Cuz she loves me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So, how much more is a pastor to us &gt;&gt; if when he sees something going on? Some people say, "Well, just come to my house and tell me." Do you know there's other people having the same problems? The house of God is a correction, a a place of healing. It's a it's IT'S IT'S A HOSPITAL. IT'S A PLACE OF REHAB. It's for people that HAVE WENT THROUGH BATTLES AFTER BATTLES AND THEY'RE SCARRED. THEY'RE HURT FROM THE MIND. THEY'RE HURT IN THE BODY. THEY'RE HURT IN THE HEART AND YOU COME TO CHURCH FOR WHAT REASON? IT'S TO GET STRENGTH FROM ON HIGH BECAUSE YOU GOT TO GET BACK INTO THE PATTERN. WHEN YOUR MIND'S ALL PLUGGED UP, YOU CAN'T STAY ON THE PRO ON THE PROGRAM. YOU CAN'T STAY IN THE IN THE WAY OF GOD BECAUSE YOUR MIND MAKES YOU GO WONDERING THIS WAY. IT MAKES YOU WONDERING THIS WAY. IT MAKES YOU GO THIS WAY. YOU KNOW, WE'RE I'M SO SICK AND TIRED OF HAVING THE SHEETROCK PUT UP TO MAKE up fix my mess. ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHY CAN'T I STOP JUST A LITTLE LONGER AND MAKE THAT TUBE OF FIRE FIT &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; PERFECTLY? SO WHEN THE SHECKROCK PUTS IT UP, THEY DON'T HAVE TO work so hard. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And the painters don't have to work SO HARD. IF WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER, IT WILL BUILD THE HOUSE OF GOD. YOU ARE THE PART OF GOD THIS EVENING. GOD'S LIVING INSIDE OF YOU. YOU ARE THE HOUSE OF GOD THIS EVENING, CHURCH. YOU ARE THE BODY OF LIVING JESUS CHRIST. HE HAS TO HAVE ANOTHER BODY. HE CREATED A BODY TO COME WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BABY BOY. BUT NOW HE'S NOT IN THAT BODY. HE'S IN THE BODY, BUT HE WANTS TO BE IN YOUR BODY, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; He wants TO MARRY A BRIDE. HE WANTS A MANY MANY MEMBER BRIDE WHERE HE CAN COME AND LIVE INSIDE OF THEM AND TAKE A HOLD OF THIS WORLD AND SAY, "I TOLD YOU, SATAN, YOU CAN'T TAKE MY CHILDREN from me." &gt;&gt; AND I HAVE ANOINTED YOUR DEVILS. I'VE ANOINTED YOUR PEOPLE, BUT THEY'RE JUST IN THE HANDS OF MY HANDS, and I can tell them what to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T DECEIVE MY CHILDREN CUZ MY CHILDREN IS A PART OF ME. &gt;&gt; YEAH. NOBODY CAN TELL YOU YOUR CHILDREN DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU BECAUSE THEY look like you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Of &gt;&gt; course, this one here looks like grandpa and grandma more than he does mom and daddy. But you know what? You got a good mom and grandpa. But see, YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING. WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY AND WE'VE got to work with this. &gt;&gt; All right. Okay. &gt;&gt; And when we work with this, then God can do something. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Throw the pitchfork out and get a rake and say, "Lord, I need this." Every time the preacher preaches, "I need that. &gt;&gt; Oh, I need more of that. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I need Oh, nope. That's for me, Brother Wendle." YOU GUYS SHOULD BE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS of getting every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God up here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. YOU SHOULD HAVE HIM RINGING WET EVERY SERVICE. YOU SHOULD BE PULLING ON HIM SO HARD BECAUSE WHY? YOU GOT A JOB TO DO, &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS TO BE THE GREATEST MAN AND DAUGHTER OF GOD ON FACE OF THIS EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And that is to be able to walk and say, "Satan, get behind me." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sickness comes. Get behind me, Satan. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU'RE SICK, BROTHER. I AIN'T SICK. I'M healed in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; AND SWALLOW IT DOWN AND KEEP SWALLOWING IT AND KEEP GOING AND MARCHING ON AND STEPPING ON THOSE DEVILS. EVERY TIME THEY TALK, YOU KEEP ON STEPPING ON THEM BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE PLAN OF GOD. YOU ARE CREATING A SPACE THAT YOU CAN LIVE ON. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU CONQUER THIS THIS MOUNTAIN, IF YOU CAN CONQUER THIS WORLD, the devil can't do nothing to you. &gt;&gt; All right? BUT WHEN THIS WORLD IS OVERWHELMED TO YOU, then you got to learn this is just a body that's going to burn one day &gt;&gt; or it's going to go in rot. BUT THAT SOUL HAS TO TAKE CONTROL. &gt;&gt; BLESS THE LORD. &gt;&gt; JESUS CONQUERED THE WORLD ALREADY. &gt;&gt; Now he wants you to conquer yourself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And when you conquer yourself, people are going to see something special. THEY MIGHT NOT understand it, but they're going to see something different. I've been working at a place called Safeway, a grocery store. Yeah, me a per I'm a clerk. That's my title, Brother Merl. I go into the back, I unload the truck, I drag, everybody uses the machines. I use the cart and I just grab it by by hand. And I pull that stuff into my cooler and I go back another almost 100 yards and grab another one and I come back and they said, "Why are you not using that?" "Because I'm faster than you guys with that thing on." They said, "No, you're not." I said, "You want to a bit?" They said, "Yeah, I blew them away, church. 55y old man tore them up." And look at me. Woo! who I'm losing weight doing it, too. It's a challenge, but you know what? It works. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But the people, one lady in that place is Sister Sarah. SHE'S TOLD THE WHOLE PLACE I'm her pastor and she's proud of it. And they're all watching me like hawks. And I'm telling you something, my side of the produce, they love me. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; I'll walk around, they'll be cussing. I walk around and they all turn around. We're sorry. We're sorry, brother William. We're sorry. We're sorry. We, you know, we love you. We love you. We're sorry. We're sorry. The management wrote a letter. I'm the only one out of that store ever had a letter wrote to their to their uh big man saying William Smith does a fantastic job on the wet bar. He works we watched him for four and a half hours yesterday and he never stopped one time. He worked and he worked and he worked. Okay. &gt;&gt; The whole place is like &gt;&gt; so the management's thinking about putting me in charge of the whole place spiritually. My side totally change atmosphere because when I come in I'm shaking their hands and you'll get fired doing this church. I've prayed for him out there in the middle of the store. &gt;&gt; All right. S I said, "What's wrong with you, sis?" She goes, "Oh, just having a bad day." So, you want me to pray for you? Yeah. I take my hat off and I pray right there. &gt;&gt; THE BOSSES ARE WATCHING ME GOING, "HE'S PRETTY BRAVE." &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; I could get fired for it. I don't care. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I know who I am. He gave me the job. He gave me another job. But I am going to shed THE LIGHT TO THOSE THAT ARE NEEDY. AND I WANT THEM SAVED. I WANT THAT WHOLE STORE SAVED AS LONG AS I'm going to be working there. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; MY BOSSES DON'T GIVE two raises a year. Never. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I got a raise my first 90 days and then they gave me the max this last week before I left &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I KEPT MY NOSE IN THE BOOK. I get THERE IN THE MORNINGS. I WORK. I PUSH PLAY. I LISTEN TO THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. I WORSHIP GOD. WHEN I'M LISTENING TO THE MUSIC, I'M SINGING IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY THAT'S IN THAT PLACE. AS PEOPLE THAT COME AND ASK FOR SOMETHING, I TELL THEM WHERE IT'S AT. I GO GET IT. I work and work and work. All right. I'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE COME UP TO me telling ME THEIR PROBLEMS AND I LOOK AT THEM. I SAYS, "I'VE GOT THE THE cure for it." How? Let me pray for you. I'VE PRAYED for people that's in there that COME INTO THE STORE AND PRAYED FOR THEM AND THEY left crying. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Thanking God. Me and the boys were talking one day and they were asking me questions and I was answering their questions. This woman comes up and goes, "I wish YOU'D QUIT TALKING ABOUT THAT GOD OF YOURS AND HELP ME FIND THE TOMATOES." She was standing right in front of the tomatoes. THE VERY NEXT WEEK, SHE COMES IN AND SHE'S COMING UP AND I SAID, "HOW ARE YOU DOING, MA'AM?" She goes, "I'm doing okay." I said, "I'm so glad you made my whole day." She goes, "I did?" I said, "Absolutely. I love the Lord Jesus just because of you." AND SHE, THE SAME WOMAN SAYS, "OH MY GOODNESS, you're a Christian. I love God, too. I COULD HAVE HATED HER GUTS. I COULD HAVE NEVER DONE NOTHING TO HER. BUT I CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE AND BRING HER INTO GOD BY BEING KIND TO HER. &gt;&gt; NOW SHE COMES IN. She doesn't call me by my name. She calls me by my last name. Hello Mr. Smith, pastor. Haircut shorter than yours. Mean looking thing. She comes in. First thing she comes is Mr. Smith here today. I've got to tell him what my whole day I'm blown away. But I told I told my wife, I says, "We're here. We're going to change lives." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; We have the ministry. We need to change lives. &gt;&gt; We've got to tear this place apart by love. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got a man that come to church, tattoos all the way up to his neck, all the way up to here like this. He wants to be baptized. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Was in the in the Catholic church for years. He wants to be baptized the right way. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus &gt;&gt; in Bible form human. Some people don't read this. Too many people, false doctrine says that this is not real. &gt;&gt; Quit arguing with them. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT REAL UNLESS IT'S IN A HUMAN BEING. &gt;&gt; It's just a BUNCH OF WORDS. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU EAT THE BOOK. YOU BECOME THE BIBLE. THEY SEE THE BIBLE LIVING INSIDE OF YOU. THEY'LL ASK QUESTIONS. The whole store looks up to me. It's a lot of pressure. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But I love it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Doesn't matter what side of the store I'm at, they're cussing. Instantly they stop and the religious part comes out. Well, praise the Lord. We're so glad that you're here. One time I told him, I says, "Yeah, to keep you in check." And he goes, "Amen." &gt;&gt; But see, we got to get into a pattern. I didn't know why I put this in there, but give you a little example what's happening to Brother William and Sister Sharon. &gt;&gt; And we're enjoying it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's get back on the message. Oh, mercy sakes. I got other people that like me, too. Like you guys, I got 14 people that comes to church every service and they just love me to death. They laugh just with Sharon all the time, shaking their heads. But see, part of a pattern, God forms man from the dust of the earth because a living soul made woman from man. Because what see what happens here? God when he created man in his own image, he was male and female. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; He was a perfect man. &gt;&gt; But when he laid him down and pulled out that rib, that woman part is a helpmate. When Jesus was on that cross, your cross, and that spear went into that side and the blood came out, what was he doing? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was letting his life pour out on the ground to every seed that proceedth out of the mouth of God, predestinated seed would be covered of his blood. &gt;&gt; Okay? And when the word would come po forth, that woman wakes up, the other part of that man, and Adam called it woman. He loved her. They did things together. So what does God do? He creates a body so he can come and live in it. The God of heaven left his throne and get into A BODY. THE SPIRIT OF THAT BODY WAS JESUS CHRIST, the Godhead bodily. THE FLESH WAS A SACRIFICE FOR YOU AND ME SO THAT YOU AND I can join him as a bride. &gt;&gt; So now he has a many brothers and sisters, but a body that he's marrying, a church. &gt;&gt; Wow. YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND SO NOW he is making this house his wife the word and he's endoring her and he's making her exactly the mind way back yonder. &gt;&gt; He wanted a wife to be this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. AND IT TOOK SEVEN CHURCH AGE people to make this body. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So that he can marry the church. Same thing with this man. He was lonely. GOD IN HEAVEN WAS LONELY. CHURCH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. He wanted somebody to fellowship. He didn't want just angels just bowing down to &gt;&gt; But he wanted a people that would come to him and say, "Father, I need you this morning." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I thank you for the breath that I take every morning. Thank you for going to work WITH ME, LORD. BECAUSE AS YOU'RE WORSHIPING GOD, YOU'RE IN THE PATTERN. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; When we building houses, we stand there and we build a foundation first, but before any mud or any steel or any wood, WE'VE GOT TO TEST THE GROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT GROUND IS GOING TO HOLD THE FOUNDATION. &gt;&gt; SURE. OKAY. &gt;&gt; YES. And if it can't, they dig deep until THEY GET ON A SOLID ROCK AND THEY DRILL INTO IT AND THEY PUT A FOUNDATION DOWN SO THAT FOUNDATION WILL NOT MISS OR SLIP OR BREAK. AND WHEN THAT FOUNDATION IS BUILT, you start building a house. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; YES. GOD COME DOWN ONE day in A LITTLE BODY NAMED JESUS AND HE WANTED THAT BODY TO BE THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH. AND HE MADE SURE THAT THAT BODY WAS GOING TO HOLD EVERY MAN AND EVERY WOMAN OF GOD IN A PLACE WHERE THEY can be secure &gt;&gt; forever more. &gt;&gt; Okay. AMEN. THROUGH ANY TRIAL, THROUGH ANY PAIN, THROUGH ANYTHING THAT EVER HAPPENS, YOU HAVE AN ANCHOR. YOU HAVE A FOUNDATION. AND GOD, HE IS BUILDING THE HOUSE. HE'S TAKING YOU LUMBER. HE'S TAKING YOU SHINGLES. HE'S TAKING YOU WINDOWS. HE'S TAKING YOU THIS AND THAT. AND HE IS MAKING A BODY. AND HE'S STAYING WITH THE PATTERN. HE'S GOT A PATTERN. AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE A BRIDE SPOTLESS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN I GRAB A 2X4, IT DOESN'T SAY, "DON'T CUT ME. DON'T CUT ME." IT DOESN'T HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. I CUT IT EXACTLY THE LENGTH I NEED AND I PLACE IT IN THE WALL. &gt;&gt; AND THAT PIECE MEANS SOMETHING IN THAT WALL. YEAH, &gt;&gt; THOSE STUDS THERE WASN'T THERE. THAT WALL WOULD FALL. &gt;&gt; YES, &gt;&gt; THOSE TILES WOULD FALL IF SOMETHING WASN'T TIED RIGHT UP THERE. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; SO GOD LETS THE DEVIL COME AND HE BEATS ON YOU. WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S making a house. &gt;&gt; The great pattern of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. a salvation pattern, &gt;&gt; a redemption pattern. IT'S GOT HEALING IN IT. IT'S GOT SALVATION IN IT. IT'S GOT JOY IN IT. IT'S GOT LOVE IN IT. IT'S GOT FAITH IN IT. IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's why it's so important when them doors open in your home, go to church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God had a pattern in the Bible to fulfill. &gt;&gt; Noah, it was little old Noah. He didn't know that HE WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH TRIALS FOR 125 YEARS. AS SOON AS HE SAID GOD TOLD HIM TO BUILD A BOAT AND HE STARTED WITH A BLUEPRINTS AND PEOPLE SAW THAT BLUEPRINTS, THEY WERE LAUGHING AT HIM. THEY WERE MAKING FUN OF HIM, BUT HE STAYED TRUE TO THE BLUEPRINT AND BUILT A BOAT. &gt;&gt; And that boat took eight people across and two pair of animals all the way across until 40 days and 40 nights of rain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when it landed on a rock, wherever it's at, and wherever it is it today, I don't know. But I'm going to TELL YOU SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; MY BIBLE shows it's the truth. Yeah. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He built a boat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he kept telling him, "You better get on the boat." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; YOUR JOB IS TO TELL THE PEOPLE TO GET IN WHILE THEY HAVE TIME TODAY. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; GET IN WHAT? JESUS CHRIST, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham had a plan. He was GOING TO BE A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS. HE WAS GOING TO HAVE CHILDREN OF CHILDRENS OF CHILDRENS OF CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; HE WENT THROUGH THE HARD TIMES. HE WENT THROUGH THOSE THINGS. HE HE DISOBEYED GOD AND TOOK HIS NEPHEW AND THE FATHER WITH HIM. AND WHAT HAPPENED? GOD DIDN'T TALK TO HIM UNTIL HE GOT RID OF IT AND GOT BACK ON THE PLAN. AND WHEN HE GOT ON THE PLAN, AS SOON AS THEY WERE GONE, HE SHOWED THEM EXACTLY WHERE TO GO. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING TONIGHT, CHURCH, IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE JUST HITTING A WALL, COME BACK TO THE ORIGINAL WORD. COME BACK AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST. QUIT BEING SO SCARED TO COME DOWN TO THE ALTAR BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS making you not come because he's telling you you're not worthy enough. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WASN'T WORTHY ENOUGH, HE WOULDN'T HAVE DIED ON CALVARY FOR YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; And brother Rand says, HE SAYS, "YES, THAT WAS A JEWISH rel uh uh way, BUT HE SAYS IT WORKS FOR AMERICA, SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT GOING." I thank God for this morning. I saw this BIG OLD DARK CLOUD COME INTO THE building and all of a sudden I seen these arms going down and hitting the people. And those people this morning with those five people when it hit them, they would go, I've never called that out before. When I called it out this morning, they was coming running with tears down their face. THEY GOT VICTORY THIS MORNING BECAUSE it it came to the right atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; THEY GOT DELIVERED THIS MORNING. WHY? BECAUSE SOMEBODY CARED ENOUGH TO TELL THE PEOPLE. AND IF YOU REJECT THE WORD OF GOD THROUGH THE PASTOR SAYING THERE'S A SPIRIT, YOU NEED TO COME TO THE ALTAR. EVEN YOU DON'T THINK IT'S YOU, COME TO THE ALTAR ANYWAY AND CRY OUT TO GOD AND SAY, "FATHER, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ME, BUT IF IT'S ME, THEN HELP ME, GOD. BUT IF IT'S MY BROTHER, IT'S MY SISTER. LORD, LET ME PLEASE LET ME BLEED FOR THEM. FILL THE ALTAR UP WITH PRAISE AND WATCH GOD TAKE OVER." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YOU WANT A REAL BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST? AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SPEAKING IN TONGUES. I'M TALKING ABOUT A VICTORY. &gt;&gt; OH, saints of God, I think we all need a victory march once in a while. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; BUT WE GET OFF THE PATTERN BECAUSE WE ARE SOMEBODY. WE'RE NOTHING EXCEPT CHRIST IN US. CHRIST WENT TO THE HE WENT THERE AND PRAYED AND ASKED GOD TO LET THAT CUP PASS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. HE GOT ON HIS KNEES AND CRIED OUT AND SAY, "OH LORD, IF THIS COULD PASS, LET IT PASS." BUT WHAT WAS HE THINKING? HE WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU, YOU HOPELESS PEOPLE. HE WAS LOOKING AT YOU AND ME, HOPELESS, without somebody coming and taking your sins. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "FATHER, NEVER ALAS, I'll go." FROM THAT POINT, HE DIED RIGHT THERE FOR YOU. But now he had to fulfill it. Are we ready to fulfill our journey? Are we going to get off our little tush and start acting like real Christians and staying with the word of God? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I don't want to see him with more gray hairs next time I come. He's younger than me by three days. But I'm being honest. We get we think we know the message of the hour and that's all we need. We don't need nothing else that's going to judge us one day. Stay with the pattern. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Moses in the pattern. &gt;&gt; What was he? He was a deliverer when he was born. &gt;&gt; HE HAD A JOB to do, BUT HE STARTED ONE DAY too soon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He ran like a little scared little boy. Ran out in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh didn't take him out at the end of the thing and hand him a stick and hand him some water and hand him some food and say, "There's your kingdom." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, he ran because he didn't have a kingdom no more because he'd killed AN EGYPTIAN. &gt;&gt; HE HAD IT ALREADY IN his hands. &gt;&gt; But he RAN BECAUSE HE WAS SCARED THAT BECAUSE PHARAOH WAS GOING TO KILL HIM. &gt;&gt; So he gets out there and God GIVES HIM A WIFE THAT FIGHTS WITH HIM. THANK God I didn't get one of them. Guess who is his first people that he had to be a shepherd, too. It wasn't even people. It was a four-legged bath. Stinky, messy, they eat everything. They b all the time. God was building character, &gt;&gt; all right, &gt;&gt; in his pattern, &gt;&gt; all right, &gt;&gt; for a deliverer. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; he had to learn how to take care of his father-in-law's sheep, he had to have the ability to have something that he knows that he could be a shepherd. And when he saw that burning fire up there in the mountain that that tree was not being burned up, it made him want to know what in the world is on God's mountain. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; And there was a pool. &gt;&gt; Do you feel a pool? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He goes up there and God speaks to him and says, "Take your shoes off. You're on holy ground." &gt;&gt; And God speaks to him. But see, Moses had to see a sign. because he was scared. I can't DO IT. I CAN'T TALK. I CAN'T DO I CAN'T CAN CAN'T CAN. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO IT. BUT YOU CAN WITH CHRIST. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; He said, "Moses, put your hand in your side." And he puts it in. He rings it out in his leprosy. &gt;&gt; He said, HE SAID, "MOSES, put it back in your came back and it was just fine." I love him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is it? God's showing him &gt;&gt; that he was God. &gt;&gt; And if I can change your hand to be leper and I can make your hand well, I can get you to be a deliverer. &gt;&gt; IF GOD CAN HEAL YOUR BODY, THEN HE can make you be sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He just needs a willing vessel to let him have control. &gt;&gt; And so what did he do? Moses, pick up your stick. Throw it on the floor. Goes into a stank. God didn't pick it up. He wanted Moses to pick it up. HE WANTED TO SHOW MOSES THAT HE HAD THE POWER TO CHANGE THINGS. HE REACHED DOWN THERE AND HE GRABS THAT SNAKE AND IT CAME BACK WITH WHAT? Not a snake. The stick that was in his hand. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Has a shepherd man. Moses was changed that day forward. Now he was in the commission that he needs to be in. And the Bible says he went down there and he conquered the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; By a stick in his hand. &gt;&gt; He was in the pattern. See, he got himself in the word and he went forward. Little Moses's get into the word &gt;&gt; and go forward and conquer your enemy. &gt;&gt; Many men and many women has plans today, but you have to figure out where your plan is. Brother Brandham realized who he was and he manifested it. He was Malachi 4. But are you a part of Malachi 4? You're in there. &gt;&gt; The children got their hearts turned towards what? The word. &gt;&gt; You become the word when you eat the book. &gt;&gt; You putting it into here, it drops down to here. And now you're manifesting what you eat. Brother Brandham never brought us to himself. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; How many people know that? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Why do you know it? Because you read the book. You're reading the books. You're listening to the tapes. &gt;&gt; So, Brother William, I if I am I going to hell if I sin? No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; You're going to hell if you don't believe. But if you sin, you have an alien. You have the father that'll shed his blood upon you when you ask him forgiveness. &gt;&gt; That settles it. &gt;&gt; But if you love God, you'll try not to do those things. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Because now you're staying in the pattern. You're building the house. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; You're building your character to match Christ. You're dying out every day because why? You want to stay in the pattern. You're wanting to stay in that blueprint. &gt;&gt; I want to be holy. I want to be blameless. I want the joy. I want the salvation. &gt;&gt; I want to be healed. I want the faith. I want the virtue. I want the knowledge. I want the temperance. I want the brotherly love, the brotherly kindness. I want the love capstone come upon me to CHANGE THIS BODY IN A MOMENT, in a twinkle of an eye. I NEED THIS HOUSE TO LOOK LIKE JESUS. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Come on. &gt;&gt; And the only way we're going to do it, CHURCH, IS TO GET INTO THE WORD OF GOD YOURSELF, NOT YOUR PASTOR. YOUR PASTOR WILL GUIDE YOU THROUGH WHAT YOU READ AND HELP YOU UNDERSTAND. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO READ THE BOOK, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; And then you'll be in the plan. The great foundation of Christ Jesus part is in the plans of God. Pentecost is the plans of God. The seven church haes come out. Great message of the hour is a part of the great pattern OF GOD. THE LIFE OF GOD IS IN THE message and he wants you to have that same life. So he's taking a part of him and putting it into you. What is it? It's him. The fullness of God. Brother says it's a teaspoon of of the sea. You've got the sea in your in a teaspoon. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But that's just that's just a example. But if you got the Holy Ghost, you got him in you, the fullness &gt;&gt; of the Godhead bodily in you. And if you got it, you got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. Then you are the bride &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Then what is he doing? He's making you be a part of the bride. He's making you that sleepy one over there in the bride. He's making these others in in the bride. He's making these over here in the bride. What is he doing? And he's going over here and he's making this in the bride. He's making this part of the bride. What is he doing? He's changing you. &gt;&gt; Changing you. Because why? He wants to marry you. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD THAT YOU AND I ARE GOING TO GET MARRIED TO GOD IN A union &gt;&gt; of redemption. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE GLORY OF GOD COMING INTO US. WHAT IS IT? &gt;&gt; It's the plan. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Of your salvation, &gt;&gt; okay? &gt;&gt; The hope of glory, the life of Jesus Christ in you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What a God we serve, church. &gt;&gt; You are so much a part of the pattern of God. Remember the things I just wrote down off of off of messages that I just took my thoughts and wrote them down. I don't care what people called me. That don't mean a thing to me. The only thing that I want to do is know this that I have been dead and my life is hidden in Christ &gt;&gt; through God and sealed by the Holy Ghost that when he calls from among the dead, I will answer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. on that day &gt;&gt; buried bury me in Christ for this that our in Christ will God bring with him at that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; This is the pattern. So what do we need to do, brother William? Get into Christ. &gt;&gt; How do you get into Christ? Right here. &gt;&gt; That's how you get into Christ. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You mean I don't have to go to college, brother Merl? I mean, I don't have to go to your house and you teach me how to how to be in Christ? &gt;&gt; Do I have to act like you, brother Mitch, to be in Christ? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; No. He wants you to be yourself. &gt;&gt; Eat the book. &gt;&gt; Eat the book. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And become &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do we get in Christ? By one spirit, we are all baptized in one body and become fellow citizens of the kingdom of God. We profess to be pilgrims and strangers on this earth anymore. Not seeking those worldly things, but looking for the coming of the blessed king to take over and dominion from sea to boundless sea when he comes in his glory. Certainly he looks for his coming and then no doubt in my mind but that's what Jesus had in his mind when he was here on earth was that infidelity of God's eternal word. &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You become the word. &gt;&gt; It's good. Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; You become a miniature creator. What do you mean, brother William? The Bible says, "Lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. And if they have any sins, they are what? forgiven. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your hand &gt;&gt; because he's in you. &gt;&gt; The healer's in you. It goes from here through your hand and it heals that person and it plus it forgives it. That's that miniature God. You walk down the street and there's somebody laying there and God puts it on you. You can lay hands on that person and raise them from the dead, &gt;&gt; but you got to know who you are. &gt;&gt; And the only way you norally going to know where you are is being in the blueprint &gt;&gt; and follow the plan. &gt;&gt; All right? And the plan of salvation is under a lot of tribulations, lot of suffering, lot of pain, &gt;&gt; but it's going to be worth it all. We've got to get a place in our lives that Brother William is nothing without Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. My life is nothing but a vapor. &gt;&gt; But in Christ, I'm a son. &gt;&gt; If you're in Christ, your sons and daughters are what? God. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then no doubt in my mind, no doubt. He said that prophet knew where he was standing. Do you know where you're standing this morning &gt;&gt; or this evening? Are you struggling hard to just be a Christian? &gt;&gt; If you are, there's something wrong now through your trials. I understand. But you should have no doubt in the world who you are &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You should know that you're sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Okay? It doesn't matter what comes. Brother Brandham was a man of God, but he was sick. And what blows me away, it it was a Baptist preacher that prayed for him. He believed in healing. And he laid his hands on HIM AND HE PRAYED A SIMPLE PRAYER. And brother Brham had to come in the pattern of that prayer. And when he came IN THE PATTERN OF THAT PRAYER, the results come that he was healed. &gt;&gt; All right. So, how much more about you, &gt;&gt; gay, &gt;&gt; brother Michael? Brother Kobe, you've got to know who you are as a minister. You're just as much a part of the ministry THAT ANYBODY ELSE IS. DON'T LET THEM TELL YOU ANY DIFFERENT. Because if not, HE WOULDN'T HAVE YOU PREACH IT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; You stand IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND SAY, "LORD, WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO DO, I'LL DO. I'LL PREACH WHEREVER YOU WANT ME TO PREACH." AND YOU GO UP THERE WITH CONFIDENCE IN THE WORD OF GOD. AND YOU PREACH IT UNADULTERATED. AND YOU PREACH EVERY DEVIL OUT OF HELL. YOU PREACH THEM BACK INTO HELL. YOU PULL THEM BACK OUT. YOU SMACK THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND YOU THROW THEM BACK IN THERE. SHOW THEM WHO HAS THE MUSCLES. YOU'VE GOT TO RING HIS NECK AROUND A LITTLE BIT. &gt;&gt; There you go. All right. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; GET HIM UNCOMFORTABLE AND HE'LL STAY AWAY from your ministry and he will leave you alone. &gt;&gt; WHEN BROTHER BRANDON WAS STANDING THERE, THERE WAS DEVILS HAULING AT ONE ANOTHER. I NEED YOUR HELP. I NEED YOUR HELP. HE'S GOING TO CAST ME OUT. WHO IS GOING TO CAST HIM OUT? BROTHER BRANDHAM was &gt;&gt; and you got the same gift. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because he's in you. Okay. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You have the right to tell the devil to get back. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You can grab that thing. HE'S JUST THIS RIGHT HERE. You fold this up. This is him. YOU SHAKE HIM UP. SAID, "GET OUT OF HERE." FOLD HIS SHOULDERS TOGETHER, BEND HIM OVER, AND THROW HIM BACK INTO HELL BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT to &gt;&gt; if you're in the pattern. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Colossians 2 9-11 it says for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him IF YOU'RE COMPLETE IN HIM SPEAK THE WORD &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; and it has to come to pass &gt;&gt; which is the head of all principalities and powers and whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands and putting off the body of the sin of the flesh, but circumcised of Christ. Oh, hallelujah, church. I don't know about you, BUT I FEEL RELIGIOUS NOW. I DON'T CARE ABOUT SATAN NO MORE. I DON'T CARE WHAT HE CAN DO. I CARE WHAT GOD CAN DO. AND IF I PUT MY TRUST IN HIM AND I SERVE HIM AND I CALL UPON HIM, HE'S GOING TO FIGHT FOR ME. HE'LL FIGHT FOR YOU. HE'LL FIGHT FOR YOUR CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid, church. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT ANOINTING FALLS ON THE UNJUST AND THE JUST. &gt;&gt; YOU MAMAS ARE TEACHERS. BE NOT A FALSE TEACHER. BE A MAMA OF THE WORD OF GOD AND TEACH YOUR CHILDREN HOW TO BE children of the living God when they're young and they'll serve God when they're older. &gt;&gt; All right. YOU DADDIES, BE A PREACHER IN YOUR HOME. SHOW THE LOVE OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE WITH YOUR CHILDREN. When you come home, GET OFF YOUR STINKING PHONE AND PLAY WITH YOUR CHILDREN. DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR CHILDREN CUZ somebody's going to get your children if you don't. &gt;&gt; STAY IN THE PATTERN. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO STAY IN THE PATTERN OF GOD OR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BUNCH OF BASTARD CHILDREN OUT THERE SOMEDAY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THERE'S MANY CHILDREN IN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR ARE LEAVING BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. BECAUSE IT'S PUSHING BROTHER BRANDHAM DOWN THEIR STINKING THROATS. I love Brother Brown with all my heart. I believe this message WITH ALL MY HEART. HE'S MY PROPHET, BUT WHAT ABOUT ME? Did I eat the book? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WHO CARES? HE'S DEAD. HE WANTS YOU TO SAY JESUS CHRIST. MOST OF THE THINGS HE'S EVER SAID WAS RIGHT out of the scripture, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's time to be the preacher of yourself &gt;&gt; and produce the word out of your own lips and your own life. Mrs. Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; fulfill this time in you &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I'm not taking brother Brandham out of it. Trust me. &gt;&gt; But I am bringing myself under the word that he preached. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And because I believe it, I'm lifting him up as the prophet because he had his job to do. Now it's my turn. &gt;&gt; I've got to take the same word and produce &gt;&gt; signs and wonders, &gt;&gt; life behind me. &gt;&gt; We get so caught up in him. Sure, &gt;&gt; but you're in Malachi 4:2. Let's get caught up into that. TURN OUR HEARTS TO GOD THROUGH THE WORD OF GOD, THROUGH THE PROPHET OF GOD. TURN YOUR HEARTS TO THAT PATTERN AND WATCH JESUS COME INTO YOU AND FULFILL EVERY NEED that you ever needed. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And every desire that's in your heart. Watch your children grow into statue of a perfect man. Your ch girls a lady of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; For we know that in him dwelle the fullness of the godhead bodily. The entire Godhead was in him. &gt;&gt; He was both father, son, and the holy ghost and dwelt in a human form. the theophony of God, the great image of God that he made man in then placed him in the earth. He had a body. God isn't without a body. God got a body and it looked like a man. Moses saw it. Others saw it AND IT LOOKS LIKE A MAN. AND IT'S JUST an impression that is of what that is and everything on earth and the beauty and the sweetness and the beauty of the earth is nothing else in the world but a answer to a fear far better not fear but be far better than that that wasn't us when we leave the world forever. Everything in earth is just a pattern of that which is in heaven. Everything that's good. Everything that's righteous, everything that's beautiful, trees, birds, everything is just a pattern of what's in heaven. Our own life, and this is my thought, our own life is just a pattern. It's just a shadow, not the real thing. It's the negative side. It takes the death to develop the picture to put us back in the theophony where come from where we come from. Then in that resurrection, we come in his likeness and his resurrection body. What a beautiful not only beautiful but it is the real solemn truth of God's eternal word that we be like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As the musicians come. I got too much here. As the musicians come. Hallelujah. You love him. Is there anything I said tonight that you don't believe? Rapture is going to happen. Why? Cuz God is bringing his people in a pattern. Bringing everybody's mind into the word of God and he's getting it ready. Every church in America, every church in every other country has to come to one message and that's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh church, he's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning or this afternoon, don't wait until next week. Let me and Brother Windle lay hands on you and pray with you. Sometimes you just need Jesus in in in flesh form. &gt;&gt; Maybe that little touch will get you across what you're going through. Don't be afraid to come up to get prayed for. &gt;&gt; Anybody laughs at you, shame on them. &gt;&gt; That just shows that they need an experience with God. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But I would rather make sure I'm ready cuz he's coming soon. The morning's breaking very soon. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; If it's by the grace of God, we'll all go in a rapture. But it might be God's will for one of us to die tomorrow. And where that tree lays, that's where it's going to lay. Let's tenderize our heart every time we come to church, every time we read the Bible, every time we pray, every time we listen to a message. Oh, just let that word soften our hearts. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't let this world and the things of this world pull you guys apart as a family. This is beautiful. Keep it that way. Let our pride just get completely out of our lives and just love one another. Don't say something that's going to hurt one another, but just stay in the pattern of God and and just soak in the presence of the Lord in your life &gt;&gt; and watch him come and mold you and shape you. Stay in that pattern, church. I love you guys. What are we going to sing? &gt;&gt; Jesus to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; All I am is to be like. Oh yes Lord. Is &gt;&gt; there another from birth to glory &gt;&gt; glory. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. All I ask is to be like him. To be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; To be like like Jesus. All I ask, oh, all I am &gt;&gt; is to be like him. &gt;&gt; All through life's journey from birth to glory. Glory. All I have is to be like you. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live for me. Let it start. &gt;&gt; Live inside this house and mold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Verse one. It was a tiny simple stay all beaten. Oh, hardly the place for a king to be born. He didn't choose some place special to reveal his majesty. So I know if I can feel control, you'll be born in me. Let your word be born in the major of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start. him inside this house and play and hold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Hourly of nothing. Oh, I am nothing. So true. Not much to behold. So unlikely the place for your word to unfold. But if I shield his vessel and let him have his way, then from glory unto glory and change me day by day. Let over in the manger of my heart. Let it live for me. Let it start. Live inside this house and play and load it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let your word Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Grant it Lord. Let it live in me. better storm. Live inside the house of plain and loed every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Outwardly I'm nothing. Outwardly I'm nothing. Not much to behold, so unlikely the place for your word to unfold. But it found the shield vessel and let him have his way. Oh my, then from glory unto glory. You change me day by day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let him live for me. Let him start. Live inside this house of clay and mold me every day. that you were working before in the manger. My heart. I want to live the way he wants me to. I want to give until there's just no more to give. And we love him. There's just no more love. I could never never round out the Lord. Oh, I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. Heavy love loves me. There's just no more. Oh, I could never ever love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now I'm giving my life away. I'm laying it down at the altar. Now I'm giving my life away. The very least I can offer is my all. Here I stand today. Giving my life away now. I'm giving my life away. I'm laying it down at the altar. Now I'm giving my life away. The very least I can offer is my own. Here I stand today. Give me my life away. Sing about that again now. Now I'm keeping my life away. I'm laying it down at the offer. Now I'm giving my life away. The very least I can offer is my all. Here I stand today giving my life away. Without him, &gt;&gt; I can do nothing. &gt;&gt; Without him, I surely fail. Without him, I would be drifting. &gt;&gt; Oh, like a shield. &gt;&gt; Without him, I could do nothing. Oh, without him. Oh my, I can do nothing without you. I surely fail. Without you, I would be drifting. Oh, like a shield without herself. Oh Jesus, my Jesus. Do you know him today? Please don't hurt him. Oh Jesus, my Jesus. Without him, how lost I would be. Here we do the verse. Oh, without him, oh my. Oh, I would be dying. Without him, I be enslaved. Without him, life would be hopeless. Oh my. But with Jesus, thank God I'm saved. Thank you, Lord. Oh, Jesus. My Jesus, do you know he today? Please don't turn him away. Oh Jesus, my Jesus. Without him, how I would be. Oh Jesus, my Jesus. Do you know him? Please don't hurt away. Oh Jesus, my Jesus. Without him, how lost I would be. He is my everything. He is my all. God. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. He is my everything. both great and small. He gave his life for me, made everything new. He is my everything. none other will do. He is my everything. &gt;&gt; He is my all. He is my everything. Both great and small. He gave his life for me. Made everything new. He is my everything. None other than you. He is my everything. He is my He is my everything, both great and small. &gt;&gt; He gave his life for me. Make everything new. He is my everything. Hallelujah. None other will do. Oh, let's sing it again. He is my everything. He is my all. &gt;&gt; He's so wonderful. He is. &gt;&gt; You are my everything. Everything. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me stay the pattern. &gt;&gt; Oh, the greatest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You gave your life for me, made everything new. He is my everything none other will do. Praise the Lord. There's a joy that comes when you stay to the pattern. The lines are blurred in so many ways today. There's no there's not a clearcut. When you start questioning the pattern, you're you're bound to get disillusioned somewhere. And if you keep the pattern and the boundaries straight and clear, then not get us see how far how close you can get to the boundary, but just as brother Brandon would tell us, stay way on the inside. Y'all remember what brother Brandham talked about the I I can't remember the full story now about the &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yeah. the the the carriage rider that was he was needing to get across the mountain pass. And he and one man said, "Listen, I can get you there. I can get all the way close to that edge." And I said, "I I can gu you around that." And the other said, "Man, I've come close this way." And another man stood up and said, "I I you know, I &gt;&gt; I just try to stay as close to the &gt;&gt; to the mountain and hug that mountain as good as I can hug it." &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to be my I want you to be my driver." &gt;&gt; I I just want to just say as close as I can. And you say, "But brother Wendle, that I don't know. I don't see any." Listen, God's given us a pattern. Let's stay as close as we can to that pattern as we can get. And don't let the world in. Don't let anything Well, but but it but let's just keep all the butts and the questions and the ifs and the whats and the Let's just Let's just keep it as close to the Bible as as we know to keep it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there's one thing for certain. We are on the final leg. We're on the final leg. Let's Let's just make sure that the next generation knows what we are and who we are. What men are and what women are and what cats are and dogs are. And let's just let's just keep let's just keep the pattern. I'm thankful for this pattern. It's worked for It's worked for all these years. And I'm still glad. I I I tell you, I I'm I'm glad I'm glad that the word is still it's very clear-cut for us all here today. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; It'll keep you in his presence. I'm not talking about legalism now. Because if we get in the well, I've read the Bible so many chapters today and I've done this. Well, that that's okay. But we're talking about I want to I I want to hear from the Lord. I want to I want to read what he's got for me. I You understand what I'm saying? It's a love. It's it's Lord, keep me in that space where it's me and you. Keep me according to your pattern. Keep me in that secret place that the world knows nothing about. That's what I want to be. Well, praise the Lord. Did you enjoy that message here tonight? Amen. Amen. You know, and as we was talking about the place that was only that was reserved for just the high priest and then as Christ was hanging on Calvary, the veil was renting too. Now he's inviting every one of us into that secret place, not a building. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I heard a preacher recently saying, "Oh, this church is the place that I've placed my name. This church." So when you come to hear and pray, this is the place he's put his name. When you go into our one of the prayer rooms in this church, remember this is the place that he's placed his name. And I thought, "Oh my, he's placed his name in his word." &gt;&gt; And when you're in his word, when you're there, there's where his blessings are. Just stay with that. Well, praise the Lord. Aren't you glad for that? Amen. Hallelujah. By one spirit are we baptized into one covenant, one body, one Jesus Christ. Well, praise the Lord. I'm glad for that pattern. Let me let me do that. I I that that last quote brother William read I I had to look it up while he was reading it and that was that's pretty powerful. Amen. That what we're doing. Amen. This here is just a pattern. This here's just a pattern right here. Our little worship our that we come. It's a pattern of that great day when we're coming over there and it's going to be what a what? So you are actually patterning. Amen. God's using you to pattern that that relationship that the bride will have with him in eternity. Well, isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; You're patterning him, but he's also patterning. Well, glory to God. In that day, I will worship with them and in them. Praise the Lord. What a wonderful, wonderful pattern. Glory to God. both great and small. You gave your life for me, made everything new. You are my everything. none other. We want to give you an opportunity to to give an offering. And um brother William is pastoring a very small church in a very expensive town. That mountain country up there is very expensive. and and um and so uh and work, you know, it just work is not just something that you can go and and find just real easy. And so, uh, I I want I want us here tonight if if you've got an offering to give, I know it'll it'll definitely be a blessing to um to help them with their trip, but also maybe help put on some an expense or something back home. And um uh to me it was a uh brother William and Sister Sharon answering the the the conviction of their heart to go up there. It was like I mean that was a great sacrifice uh to to go there. I'm talking about I mean the cheapest rent $2,500 a month or somewhere like that. and and um I mean it's it's crazy expensive up there and uh but they they fell in love with the people and had a burden for the people and so if you have we just want to give you that opportunity. Uh, Brother William sure didn't ask me to say that, but um uh just checking on him occasionally and and um I know I know it would be a great blessing. Praise the Lord. You are my all. You are my everything, both great and small. You gave your life for me. You made everything new. You are my everything. None other will do. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I just want to please the Lord. I just want to please the Lord in his will in every way to be lost in his presence. Found in his likeness to hear him say, "Well done." someday. Yes. I just want to please the Lord, be in his will in every way. To be lost in his presence, found in his likeness. You hear him say, "Well done." &gt;&gt; Well, Sister Tina is uh she's passed due for her baby. And so, she's going to be having that baby just any time. And I wonder if Tina, if you'd come up and let us pray with you. Have we already prayed with you for your baby yet? Well, why won't you come up? Maybe the baby's just waiting on a blessing. Amen. And uh so we don't have holy water, but we have earnest prayer and God's an earnest prayer answer. And so those that would like to come around and help us pray. I know. I know sister I just love sister teeth and she's a wonderful daughter-in-law and wonderful blessing to the church and and u and we just want God's to be with her and give her a an easy delivery and and u I tell you what, God has been good to Caleb and Tina and and blessed them with wonderful children And so we just can't we just can't wait to get this one here, man. And so let's let's just pray. Father, we just want to thank you. Thank you tonight, Lord, for your great love to us, the many blessings that you have blessed us with through Caleb and Tina, their children. Lord, you've blessed them, Lord, with another child.

And and Lord, I just ask that you would give her energy and give her strength. Father, I pray Lord that you would bless her as she goes into Lord this delivery. And I'm asking, Lord, that you would make her labor easy, Father. And that Lord, that it would be quick and that your angels would be with her, Lord, in the in the room, Lord. that you would be with the Lord the the doctors, midwives, whoever's working with her, Lord, the nurses, that you would anoint them all with wisdom and skill, Lord, that your blessings would be all around her home, Lord, at the hospital where she's delivering.

To be lost in his presence, found in his likeness to hear him say, "Well done." Oh, let's sing it again. Yes. I just want to please the Lord. be in his will in it. To be lost in his presence, found in his lights. To hear him say, "Well done someday." Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Well, we um uh Brother Patrick uh said that he and Stacia are really sick and and so we want to pray for for them and and um uh dad's not feeling well. Sister Tracy's not feeling well and so u just several that's that's that's a little under the under the weather. And um so we're just uh we're just believing the Lord for all of them.

And uh uh it's just been man I have to tell you the the doctors and the appointments uh her scheduling and all that they those guys are slower than the seven year edge and that I mean these she's been suffering and and I don't think even none of mom and dad's uh stuff I don't think they've had to wait near as long on things that they've had to go through or any of us really. But uh so we just we but she is she she uh text the other day and just says she hopes she knows or that we all know that she's part of the church and she she really loves you all and appreciates the calls and texts and things.

And, uh, uh, we'll just we we'll just really keep on pressing the battle and, uh, make sure you give give those guys a call that we I don't I don't see Brother Steve, Sister Karen tonight. So, let's let's pray for them. Just just all there's there's there's those that are missing around us. Make sure we reach out to them this week and let them know that we um that we are praying for them. Before we dismiss, let's go ahead and go to the Lord in prayer for all of these needs that we have mentioned. Father, we we take all of these needs, Lord. I'm not going to remention them. Lord, I I believe that you heard these names and the needs that have been mentioned. And Father, you said that you would even answer before we ask. And Father, I'm asking that your Holy Spirit, we don't know how you how you can move on different needs and different parts of the country all at the same time, but you're God. And Lord, we're asking that you would just reach down your hand, Lord, in Stillwater, here in Pawne, there in Missouri. Your presence, Lord, would be so rich, Lord, that you would minister, Lord, to all of those needs there in Henrietta. Father, touch the sick and the afflicted. We're just mortal beings. Lord, that fighting so many things in our bodies, Father, I pray that the great physician would reach down every one of these individuals and you would touch them. Lord, Sister Angie, Lord, Aunt Angie, Lord, all of those who are in need right now. Father, we we come and and intercede on the behalf of all of our fellow bride members. Lord, be with them. Oh, great God, great high priest of our confession. I ask Lord that you would bring healing to each of these individuals, Lord. Oh, we need you, Father. We thank you for it. Now Lord, I pray that you would help us as we dismiss here tonight. Let us stay in your pattern and according to your pattern. Help us Lord to always see the spirit behind everything, Lord. And let us discern according to the message of the hour. Father, we thank you for it. Be with Brother William and Sister Sharon as they're getting up early to head home. Lord, as brother William has to go back to work on Tuesday, I pray, Lord, that your angel would give them good rest tonight, Lord, and a safe travel tomorrow. Bless the church. Bless all the saints there, Lord, in Pinetop. Let your presence be with them, Father. Bless brother William and Sister Sharon. Give them wisdom as they walk among your people and lead them close to you. Father, we thank you. We give ourselves to you now tonight. We feel your presence, Lord, and we say we thank you for that.
