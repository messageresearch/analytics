amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen so good to be in the house of the Lord here this morning I want to uh speak just on a on a on a simple thought here this morning beyond the Shadows of Doubt Amen to give light to them that set in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet unto peace I believe that Beyond every shadow you will find Christ beyond the Shadows of doubt and fear and frustrations stands Jesus amen we uh you look at the evening time the evening Shadows can be a little bit spooky actually when the sun is going down and and you think you know what is out there you're at a familiar place but as the sun begins to go down the place that you think is that you pretty well know amen the Shadows begin to come in and begins to magnify everything around you and every every little uh noise you hear you amen it looks like a dark object that is that is there in front of you you don't know know what it is and your uh panoramic view becomes skewed because everything is looking different now amen and I I think that sometimes life can be full of Shadows amen I don't think I know that life can be full of Shadows it can cause you to question amen these shadows will cause you to question your health it'll cause you to question your financial Securities it'll cause you to question your marriage Shadows can come amen and when those Shadows come amen it makes you wonder because everything becomes so uncertain to you amen as you are there in in walking through this life now you you aren't the only ones who've ever been affected by the shadows of life man uh clouds try to hide the validity of taking God's word and and and taking God and and and believing his word amen these clouds of circumstances try to uh circumvent the realities of God's promises now we are a people who walk by faith we we are ordained to walk by faith our soul has been predestinated to walk by faith but these clouds will come in amen and they will create question marks in our lives these clouds will come in sometimes they'll make us amen a a a question whether God still loves us they'll make us question whether or not uh uh amen we have the Holy Ghost it'll make us question whether we have sended away our day of Grace or amen there's that and and and what happens is is is these clouds come in and and create a a a a a mirage if you will or create something that causes you to question the validity of your walk with God Amen but I I I want to tell you that's where you've got to keep faith in the promises of God's word stand upon God's word without shaking can you say amen amen you look there at Israel Israel was delivered supernaturally by the hand of God they had they had put the blood over the door and and upon the post and the death angel supernaturally had had had uh uh uh you know went over passed over their homes and God saved them and and God delivered Israel to million strong but when they got to the Red Sea the clouds of Doubt was trying to hinder them from going into the promise that God had already predestinated for them amen and before you know it though they came out supernaturally now they're sitting there wondering is God uh going to forsake us has God forgotten about us has God Amen uh or has he brought us out of here to die and begin to question amen but you see the same God that gives you the promise the same God who delivered you in the first place is the same one that is going to take you to the promised land and it doesn't matter if the Red Sea's in the way it doesn't matter if the army's coming it doesn't matter if you're hemmed in what matters is you are standing upon the Revelation which is the sunlight of God's word and the sunlight of God's word will lead you guide you oh Hallelujah he says I will send my angel to keep you in the way will be an enemy to your enemies I will be an adversary to your adversaries I've started this and I will bring it to pass well praise the Lord you see Moses god looked to Moses and said why you crying to me I've done giv you the promise you're alling you're allowing clouds you're allowing doubt you are allowing the facts of unbelief to bring the Shadows over your soul can you say amen hallelujah God says stretch forth that Rod amen stretch forth the rod and go across on dry land stretch forth the cross what was it it was God keeping his word unto Moses amen because it was already given unto Abraham 400 years earlier saying you this is your land you're going to go into bondage but I'm going to bring you back out well glory to God Amen if that don't make you want to shout amen when you're in your troubles you're in your trials you're in the situations of your life and the clouds are coming over you just remember the sunshine is still shining amen Elijah was had been faithful to the to the word of God and amen he was he was faithful a prophet to stand against Jezebel and said that it's not going to rain but by my word amen and and and and we understand if you remember the story and how they tried to kill him and they they done everything they could to try to bring elij and and to get him out of the way but you see he had an eternal purpose and the Eternal purpose had to be fulfilled and God was not going to allow his servant to die ahead of time can you say Amen finally God tells him amen it's time for rain he's seen the vision he gets he he he begins to pray and he sends his his servant amen now the servant's the it's a type of our of our carnal nature amen his servant the servant of of Elijah is a type of you and me our sinful nature our caral nature the nature that we were born with and he sends his servant and he says amen go out and look and see what you see amen and and the and the servant comes back and says I don't see any kind of rain I don't see God keeping his word at all Elijah says go back and look again amen he goes back out to look again and comes back in and says I don't see any kind of rain amen he done this time after time after time but Elijah had to stand upon the word of God because God had already given him the same the Lord and sometimes when you're looking there and your old nature amen your human reasoning your natural mind it's saying I don't see how it's possible I don't see God moving I don't see the supernatural God you have forgotten about I've been praying for healing I've been praying for deliverance I've been praying for my children but you've got to stand upon the word of God knowing that he's going to keep every word that he has spoken amen well praise the Lord now Elijah man he kept sending that servant that servant's go back and look and look and look and finally the servant came back and says man all I see is a little spot in the sky amen it's a cloud all right if you want to call it a raincloud but it's only the size of a man's hand and elij you jumped up outran the Chariots of Ahab he took why because he was leaving the promises of God and sometimes you've got to stand there against all the odds Hallelujah can you say amen amen when the when when Elisha's servant am man when he got up and came out of the tent that morning and he's seen all of the Syrian Army around him and he goes into Elisha and he says m Master they're coming to destroy us again that servant is a type of your carnal nature man and his eyes were coming back and telling Elisha we're in trouble Hallelujah but Elijah had to come back bring it under the authority of God's word and say Lord open this Poor Boy's eyes so that he can see the angels that are already there now the the Angels did not just appear the Angels were always there and I want to tell you this morning the angels are all already there but you see the clouds of doubt and unbelief will keep us from seeing what God is doing but praise the Lord amen but I'm so glad that beyond the clouds beyond the doubt beyond the Shadows Beyond amen all of these things we know that God behind the scene is working now I I I want to say here today amen maybe some of us are needing healing maybe some of us are needing the Holy Ghost maybe some of us are needing a renewing and it just looks like it's totally impossible and maybe amen that uh that servant your flesh your your carnal nature is saying I don't see any way out I don't see how God can do it I don't see amen it's to take a miracle and I just don't know if God wants to perform a miracle right now but I want to say here this morning that on the other side of the Shadows on the other side of the clouds on the other side amen of what you are looking at with your natural eyes oh come on church amen sometimes when you're painting amen when you're sometimes you're hurting bad amen you've got to reach out in faith and say my anchor holds I know the doctors have said this I know that so and so has said this but I believe God oh Church of the Living God it is your faith that brings God on the scene it is your cry that brings him in your time of impossibility it's your desires that brings him near you can you sayen now man open their naming with coming to the prophet and there he was am man a prestigious man of the Syrian Army and he comes to see Elisha and Elisha didn't come to see him he didn't come to greet him he just simply sent a servant out and he told him he says now I want you to go and and dip in the muddy Jordan seven times and and and all of a sudden clouds of doubt now remember he went with a faith expecting to be healed okay but when he got there and the Elijah did not come out himself then the clouds of Doubt began to come over him and he says he's not even going to come out and meet me he's not even going to come out and and before you know it am man now he's he's already a little skeptical and then when the enemy or or or or or when the the Elisha's servant Gesa begin to tell him I want you to go and dip in the River Jordan all of a sudden he turn around and he says I'm going to go back home amen we've got better water spots over there we've got better Creeks over there I am not going to the muddiest river there is in all of the world Amen I I don't care what you say but then there come a little servant girl amen there come a little girl that begin to talk to him and say listen if he would have asked you to do something great you would have done it amen why don't you just take God at his word go down to that muddy river and dip seven times and receive your miracle I I I say tonight or this morning God give me the grace give me the courage give me what it takes to stand upon your word and say I'm going to do what God says I'm going to believe what God says well can you say amen amen you can stay backslid if you want to amen you can you can miss the Rapture if you want to but you don't have to you can bring that nature of yours under the control of the Holy Spirit hallelujah hallelujah what can you say amen amen so so when I when I'm talking about this this amen uh beyond the Shadows I am saying Satan can bring these situations around us to get us off of the promise of God now man when the words of religious men clouded the minds of Israel they in the wilderness and causing them man to Rebel in their hearts and they believe they Mis disbelieve the servant of God and and serpents were coming out to bite them and Destroy them and to kill them amen Moses was told by God make a Brazen Serpent and I I want you to put it up on a pole and if you will put it up there on that pole and if they will look at my remedy they can live now now now they had a choice because remember the reason the serpents are biting them is because they had a disrespect for the prophet of God and now the prophet's voice is saying God's provided a remedy if you can look and live now it took somebody going past the clouds of Doubt all right and turning their eyes toward God and His remedy to bring it to pass well praise the Lord amen I I and and and we all know what took place amen God healed anyone that would look could live anyone that could look to the promise of God Amen and accept the promise of God could live I say tonight amen or this morning the promises of God are just as real today as they've ever been but you see we are living in an age where there are rivers of unbelief amen there there there is so much skepticism there's so much unbelief there's so many things that we that that that we that we are demanding God to prove prove prove prove prove when he's already proved his word in this generation all he's looking for is a humble people amen that'll look past this nature look P well praise the Lord I I just want to say you can look and live here today amen you say now now brother W I've got too many flaws I I I think sometimes the clouds can be the flaws in our lives amen you can look there at your flaws you can look there at your scars you can look there at your mistakes and as you look at these flaws amen they can Cloud up your soul they can Cloud up and you can say I don't see how God can use me I don't see how God can anoint me I don't see how God can move for me or or how I can be predestinated by God but I want you to also know that the flaw sometimes makes the Masterpiece Oh Glory to God sometimes it's the flaw sometimes sometimes it's the thing that you're struggling with right now that is going to make you who you are sometimes what you're going through right now God has allowed you to fall God has allowed you to Amen to you know to flounder out there he's allowed these things to take place many of times because he's going to bring amen a a testimony out of you now you're going to pay for your amen your your sins you're going to pay for your your nonsense when you walk away from God and you amen but if God allows those things sometimes amen you you you you you you can sit there in condemnation and that's a trick of the devil to condemn you and to make you feel that you're unworthy and to make you feel that you can't rise above it and to make you feel that it's all over for you amen or you can take the promises of God apply the blood of God to your mind and your heart and rise above it and become a testimony of God's divine grace well glory to God Amen I I I I say sometimes too many too many times amen we we we are too legalistic and God is looking to show himself free in you amen now many of times we can look at our scars many of times we we sin we we tend to man uh think God can't redeem Meen many times we think that God cannot you know do his work in me amen but God has at the beginning shown what he was doing through a uh uh through through Adam and Eve we found that that that no matter how great the sin was God is in the redeeming business I'm not advocating sin the Bible says Amen to to sin not but if any man does sin he has an advocate with Christ Jesus amen can you say man we we we we we have those things but many at times God is trying to show himself in a stronger light and the reason we fall too many times is we are careless we're walking in our own paths we're doing things in our own way and we fail to miss what God is doing well praise the Lord now brother brandom taught us that God inflicted the scar upon Adam in order to bring a testimony in order to bring out the bride God inflicted a scar Adam in a perfect Edom had a scar did you know that Jesus when we get to heaven Jesus will have his scars the scars will be trophies that's what the prophet said the prophet said when we get there he will have scars the those will be scars of redemption Adam was scarred but out of the scar well bless the name of the Lord out of the scar came the most beautiful woman that was ever on earth amen out of the scar came amen a masterpiece God created himself well praise the lord well praise the Lord I say there's something about Redemption when God wants to do something beautiful I just want to let the devil know you can cloud my mind all you want to you can cloud my heart all you want to but I am living with a promise I'm living under a predestination I am going to rise above it all God's word cannot fail can you say amen amen there's a song Amen that was sung when I was a kid the the CHT says when all have Forsaken and everything is taken the whole world's been shaken and you've got to make it without but where there's a flicker of sunlight on the far side of midnight stands Jesus beyond the shadow of a doubt can you say Amen brother Brandon would talk about superstitious mountain and brother brandham heard of this great Mountain called superstitious mountain he had heard it for so long he had read about it anden the hell the the the mountain held so much of a mystery many did not want to go into the mountain it was because of so many legends that were told about it that the the Native Americans the Indians would wouldn't even go near it amen because of of of of what the uh the Spanish had done to them and treated them and they claimed there were evil spirits that that lived in that suspicious Mountain many had come into that mountain and died and never could find their way out and and and brother brandham says he was hunting one time and he man and he got up close to superstitious mountain as he was over there and he had his flashlight and he was looking at suspicious mountain with that with that flashlight and with all the memories and all of the stories that he had heard and he goes oh that is spooky that's a spooky Mountain that's amen I and and he was amen uh uh uh you know he he says it as he got up so close he says amen the great ghostly Shadow hung uh at the east of him and and he and as he had looked with his own flashlight amen he says oh this is awfully spooky he says I couldn't wait to see superstitious mountain I had to go up there but my flashlight was nothing and I couldn't see nothing the great spooky shadows and the men that's been killed on that mountain and they searching for gold and and held many superstitions and and and truly as I tried with my flashlight I looked around and I couldn't see nothing everything was scary you you you know what I did he said I just sat still I sat still until the sun come up and when the sun which is the king of all light when it raised up my little flashlight didn't play anything all the Spooks had left he said I seen the supicious mountain it wasn't spooky I was ready to walk into it to discover it for myself because the great light the sun which is which is spoken word of God God said let there be light and that's the words of God made manifest and when it shed it all the Spooks left well glory to God he says after a while the Majesty of the son began to move upon the darkness and when it did it separated the darkness from the light and pressed the darkness back finally she raised to her highness up over the top of the mountain and it showed Superstition just what it was it lit up it showed what it was all the Spooks and all the fears that I had of the Superstition when the Sun was shining in its power upon it it all well praise the Lord it all fled away if I could talk to you here this morning amen you let the sunlight of divine revelation come upon you brother amen all of the Superstition all of the fear all of the Spooks everything will walk away from your life amen and you'll begin to see God in his Divine Purpose over your life amen the reason why you can't fulfill your purpose today is because you are looking at something spooky you're looking at your carnal nature you're looking at things and says I just don't know many have died many have failed many have fa amen but I want to tell you let the sunlight of God's Divine Purpose come upon your life and you'll see that that old nature ain't nothing to you you can conquer that nature you can conquer that sick well Hallelujah let the sunlight reflect upon who you are Hallelujah he says the son is the king of all light on this Earth in the natural light and no matter how much artificial light we can have how many great electric Rays we can produce when the Sun rises all the rest of them dim out and that's the same thing it is with the word of God when the word of God Rises all the superstitions all the denominational fanaticism all the things spread away and it shows just exactly what it is God in the beginning said let there be light and light only comes the True Light the king light comes by the word of God when God separated the light from the darkness in the beginning and God and the the word of God was made manifest it always separates the light from the darkness people can rise up with this that or the other isms can rise communism and fascism and all these other isms can rise superstitious and Cults and whatever it might be they might rise up but when the king light of the Bible raises up all superstitions all are y'all hearing me tonight amen it says but you see we know it's there but until it's Vindicated proves its light there is no right to argue against it because it shuts all other light out can I hear an amen hallelujah amen now it brings light light brings faith brother Brandon would say it this way he says faith is what you do not see it's what you believe that you do not see but there's some something inside of you that sees it and God that's inside sees his own word being made manifest but you couldn't reason it there's no way to do it you never can be God can never be reasoned because he's Beyond reasoning he's God and we just have to take what he says about it and call it the truth can you say Amen because it's the light now Superstition many times we look am man and we look at this gloom and the things that maybe in your trial or as I say I I and again I'm not a I I I am not condoning saying that you know God causes you to go out in sin or God causes you to walk away or God you know you you do that because amen you're not following the way that you should follow but God allows these things so that he can bring a purpose about in our lives well praise the Lord can you say Amen it was Moses and his and his apparent Rebellion amen when when when when he went out there and tried to do it in his own self and and there he killed the Egyptian takes off from the backside of the desert for 40 years but when God Appears to him again now Moses he's got an experience with God he's able to look back at his failures and says I'm going to trust God regardless amen hallelujah oh do we have anybody that's going to trust God do we have anybody that says I am willing to look past the clouds of Doubt to believe God hallelujah amen hallelujah brother brenman says if you could just break that crust of the Shadow of Doubt he said that's the only thing that's keeping you from receiving if you could break past the Shadows amen now as we go along the Gloom that held over the Earth at the beginning is this okay here this morning the Gloom the shadows of death and fear and uncertainty the clouds of doubt and Gloom hung over the Earth amen now this was when at this is the time that God says let there be light now the prophet taught us that when God said let there be light he said there were already seeds under the water there were already seeds from another civilization so when God said let there be light all he had to do was to remove the darkness let the light shine and the seeds that were already in the ground Hallelujah I I can tell I I I I I I must be going a little bit too slow for y'all here this morning I'm saying the seeds were already under the that water on now God just had to bring light on the subject remove it and the seeds that were already there begin to grow Hallelujah you know you you were that way too you were in sin you were in the mck and the M well praise the Lord many of times we we we look at ourselves and we amen uh uh we were scarred we we were hurt maybe we were abused when we were a child maybe maybe we were molested or maybe we amen had had things that that were brought against us and and it scarred us emotionally scarred us physically it it scarice but you see you look at the scars and there's too many times when we just look at the scars and don't allow the sunlight come and let the Holy Spirit come in and bring the seeds of life to up can you say Amen but you see that's what God designed in the earth when he said let there be and then let the seeds bring forth after its kind amen it was to bring it was to bring the bring life it was to bring the fruit it was to bring what God intended it to be regardless of what the circumstances around it were at the light was giving it the permission to rise above it now man I as I think of this Amen in spite of the shadowy clouds there were the seeds brother brandham would put it this way he says the first light that was ever given in the Earth was God's spoken word the first light that was ever that ever struck the Earth was God's word he said let there be light and there was light it turned Darkness into light and in order to bring forth the creation of joy and life upon the Earth then the spirit of God is moving with love and compassion and that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose and swept across its rays and dried up the waters with the Earth from the Earth and made it an atmosphere above for uh for its first time it was going to bring joy and life to the Earth by a seed that was a great hour he took Brokenness now the prophet would say that he' done this with compassion and love he could take Brokenness and because he knew there was the seed on the inside he could bring that to life and bring the beauty you Easter that's what that's what Easter was at God come in when the Earth was gloomy when the Earth was full of sin when man was so far away from the sunlight of God it looked like it was so so far away and yet God allowed the sunrise to come on that Easter morning that Easter morning it brought a hope into human heart like no other time it would be the hope now they would still live in a scarred body they would still live and die in the natural but the soul had something to live for the soul there was a communication open back between he and God oh can you say amen amen I look there at I look there at Jesus and there he was he was beat and and and and he was amen bruised and anden he was mashed and he was cut and handfuls of beard were pulled from his face he was spat upon he was made fun of he was he was scarred beyond recognition but God took the scars God took the the pain and God brought about a resurrection for you and me and it was a declaration it was a declaration to all of us human beings it was a declaration God gave a declaration that day it gave a hope that as God raised this human being when God raised this human being from the grave when he raised him from all of the scars and the pain when God raised him despite those that hated him when God raised him despite amen all of those who had rejected him and God raised him out of that grave Hallelujah it was a blessed hope to you and to me saying no matter what the clouds say no matter what Humanity says no matter the scars or the pain amen I have a hope God raised him up so that he could Raise Me Up Hallelujah because we know that those scars that came were not for himself he took your scars he took your pain he took your questions he took your fears he took your doubts he took everything concerning you was placed upon him and when God raised him from the dead that was a declaration that you shall raise too he was wounded for my transgressions can you say amen he was bruis for [Applause] me what takes the clouds of Gloom away that takes that old condemnation spirit that wants to come in and condemn and condemn and condemn and condemn it moves it out of the way because he took the penalty and the pain for me I've still got the scars yes I've got the scars of of my transgressions memory amen I I I wish memory could leave me all those bad things that I've done and and and the sins that I've committed but I want to tell you when I come and I ask for the blood of Jesus Christ he's not looking at my failure he's not looking at my shame he's not looking at my questions he is bringing about the Masterpiece who had the scar Adam took the scar so that I could come free Adam took the scar so that I could come into existence Jesus Took H glory to God hallelujah do you love him here tonight yes sir you see amen the the fall covered the Brilliance of God's sun rise the fall took it all away until it was all cloudy but when God comes back in through the power of the Holy Spirit and because of that Resurrection Hallelujah I was sure glad brother amen I was sure glad that brother uh uh uh Merl says it was it was well it was a good meal Wednesday night amen praise the Lord cuz it's going south this morning but I but I want to tell you the the the scars and the pains and the rejections all of those things amen are now upon us because the sunlight s so n if you will the god light the supernatural light is hi now now there is a cover man the atmospheres are now covered by by the the sense of man of humanity now the Bible says Satan is the prince of the powers of the air now they're blocking you human human being from his maker now it's gloomy the sunlight is is no longer shining the seeds can't live inside us hallelujah hallelujah but I'm so glad and I I I I I'm so glad that he when when Jesus he didn't just die and he wasn't just rejected he wasn't just God but when he rose again again amen what did he do he told he told Thomas I want you to feel my scars I want you to feel my side I want you to know that I've still got those scars and I'm going to fight I've got to go I I've got I've got to go I've got to go amen into other real but I promise you this one thing here I'm going to take my sword I'm going to fight amen I'm going to penetrate the powers of the air I'm going to penetrate those clouds I'm going to penetrate that gloominess I'm going to penetrate that amen adultery I'm going to penetrate all that condemnation I will penetrate it and I'm going to make a way for you to enter into those heavenlies I'm going to make a well praise the Lord I'm going to make a way for you well praise the Lord amen mama kitten do it Daddy couldn't do it because we were all amen we were all Sinners we were all under we were all under the penalty of death amen but what did he do he fought every demon power that would separate you and God he fought sickness he fought depression he fought discouragement he fought dis uh you condemnation he fought every Power of hell that would keep you from entering into the presence of God hallelujah hallelujah you know I I I I as I'm as I'm thinking about this here this morning I want you to look look at the way that he's provided and quit looking at your scars of your past this morning you got to quit looking at your scars and you got to look at the way that he has made because it's a blessed Old Highway only the righteous are going to make it only the holy is going to make it well praise the name of the Lord amen oh he's made a way for you to enter in that place with God isn't it ironic that in this last age amen that God gives brother brandham a vision he gives a vision of the other side brother brandham is laying in the bed amen he's laying there with his hands back behind him Hallelujah but he is translated up he is there in that first heaven and he's able to look back and see his body there ain't no clouds between that old body and Heaven There is nothing there anymore oh come on now amen Satan can try it he can try it he can try it but when he looked he saw you he saw [Music] me Hallelujah so what does that mean well my purpose brother Wendell is man my my purpose I I want to know my purpose and I I but I got too many scars I can't fulfill my purpose I believe it was blind uh Fanny Crosby or she was blind and had her scars and amen and she's wrote over 8,000 songs and when someone asked her about her blindness of eyes and man she says if my eyes my sight were offered to me I wouldn't accept it they said why wouldn't you accept it she said I might not have sung hymns to praise the the name of God if it weren't for the Affliction that I have maybe maybe I wouldn't have come back to God or I wouldn't or I would have left my God Amen she says if I had been distracted by the beautiful things that interesting things about me amen but then she turns around and they said well what if you get on the other side and you're still blind what if you what what if you get on the other side and all of this you're still blind that's when she stood up or she she got her pen and she began to write the song I shall know him I shall know him and redeem by his side I shall stand I shall know him I shall know him by the nail prins in his hand she will know him by his scars there's another song that is uh his scars for mine y'all remember that his his scars for mine His Life For Mine he laid it down down for me so that I could rise above it oh friends I want to say Gloom is gone beyond beyond the Shadows beyond the Shadows can you say amen hallelujah amen oh you say but I I've got too many scars I've got too many scars I've got too many scars God seen those scars and God took those scars upon himself praise the Lord sometimes we say if I didn't have if I didn't have my flaws if I didn't have my then then I could and before you know it a cloud comes back over amen the Apostle Paul comes to Christ he says he says he prayed over and over he says I'm asking that this that this Thorn In the Flesh pass from me take it from me Jesus appeared to him and said my grace is sufficient for thee' for in thy weakness my strength is made perfect how can you say Amen you see what you see what he's saying amen there there the Apostle Paul amen there there in 2 Corinthians 11 and 24 it says of the Jews five times received I 40 Stripes save one Thrice I was beaten with rods and once I was stoned Thrice I was I suffered shipwreck a night and a day I have been in the deep in journeyings of in Pearls of of water and Pearls of robbers and Pearls by my known countrymen and Pearls by the the the Heathen and Pearls by the city and Pearls by the Wilderness in pearls in the sea in Pearls by uh among false brethren in weariness and painfulness and watchings often and hunger and thirst and fastings often I in cold and nakedness besides these uh those things that are without that which cometh upon me uh daily the cares of the churches but who is weak and I am not weak is offended and I burn not if I must needs Glory I will glory of the things which concerns mine infirmities do you not think the pressure of failure clouded the Apostle Paul's mind do you not feel that the rejection and despised by his friends of all Asia as he said has forsaken him Deus feels like he's more spiritual than me can you say Amen but the Apostle Paul turns in Philippians 1 and 12 he says I would ye should not you should understand Brethren that the things which have happen unto me have fallen out rather under the furtherance of the Gospel so that my Bonds in Christ are manifest in all of the palace and all of the other places and many of the brethren in the Lord wax strong Confident by my bond ones are much more bold to speak the word can you say am man amen so what am I what what what what am I saying this morning beyond beyond beyond any Cloud that you that is over your eyes here today over your heart here today there is still an Eternal Sunshine of Eternal purpose and and are y'all that's that's that's pretty big that's pretty big Eternal purpose clouds can't move the purpose of God as long as there's an earth as long that the sun is going to shine you can go down in your basement and you can say The Sun Ain't shining but I just want to let you know Sunshine the sun is shining you can say oh you can come up with all of your excuses the sun is still shining and God's purpose will never somebody punch your neighbor and Say

ready to descend here today amen sometimes again those Shadows can come because of self-inflicted wounds now I I keep coming right back to that but these Shadows sometimes that condemnation comes because window mark M Hallelujah is that right amen but David had such incredible prophecies wrote about him and spoke over him and amen Christ shall sit upon the throne of David and Jesus himself said he's the root and The Offspring of David and David loved God with all of his heart he was a man after God's Own Heart and Oh my he wrote so many wonderful songs to God most of the Psalms are written WR by David but David had a flaw amen he killed Uriah the hittite kill him Hallelujah it was a self-inflicted wound it would be a scar and David would look there and as the prophet would come to David and say thou art the man thus saith the Lord of God of Israel I anointed thee King over Israel I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul I gave thee thy Master's house and thy Master's wives into thy bosom and gave Thee the house of Israel and and Judah and if that had been too little I would have I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things wherefore hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight thou has killed Uriah the hitte with the sword and taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with a sword of the children of Ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou Hast despised me and has taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this son for thou what for thou did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the son and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also I love this verse and David put put it up there sister Keys that's that's in that's in 2 Samuel 12 and 13 and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan the prophet said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin he's just pronouncing judgment and God's word he's going to suffer but when he says I'm wrong immediately God comes right back and says and the Lord hath put also hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die how be it because of this deed thou has given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to Bas blaspheme and the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die can you say Amen it was a scar and boys I'd like to tell you you three that you guys are just going to be awesome Christians and never make mistakes I want to tell you anyone ever walks away from God you're you're you're you're you're under a curse the devil's got his hand on you and I know I've been preaching it quite a bit lately lately but God is faithful he'll chastise you he'll do it that he'll never he he's going to love you with an eternal love was David finished for good was all the Prophecies of David all gone and done and under absolutely not David paid for his sins amen well praise the Lord and I'll tell you what which wife did David come out of or which wife did Jesus come out of Hallelujah what see where plant did the seed what seed what lineage Jesus was born of BBA the Hittites wife scars Jesus came out of scars so you know what we've got to tell the devil Jesus could have sit there and and and and and and and and questioned who he was and what he was and the illegitimacy that the Pharisees were putting on him trying to put a cloud over him saying that he don't listen to him because he's a he's a fornicator don't he was born of adultery and he was done all of these things here but Jesus would refuse to allow the clouds of Doubt to come he had a relationship between he and God and brother I'm here to tell you it's time for some Sons and Daughters to rise up and say I will not allow the [Applause] clouds can you say Amen brother brenon was embarrassed and he was ashamed of his upbringing he was ashamed that his daddy was a was was a an alcoholic and am man and and the kind of life that the family lived people wouldn't even want to we didn't even want to that brother Brandon would walk down the street and the guys that were coming to there go the opposite way way around brother brandom amen but God wasn't ashamed God took that man in that condition born in that family to bring a message to an entire world oh hallelujah amen Kobe I know you're born a Martin but you don't have to be ashamed of being in my Martin amen you're a Son of God you go past all of the Martin and walk in the presence with God we oh can you say man we it's not it's not where I'm born and how good I am and where I stand in the community what it is is the scars that he took for me to make my scars beautiful Hallelujah glory to God glory to God Amen don't you just love him amen I look at myself and I say oh God oh God oh God where am I at what what you know why H how could you use me and God says H it's not been nothing about you in the first place amen won't you come walk with me get out of those get get get out of that Wasteland come on over here and walk with me Hallelujah but God I've got all of these scars I I know I know so do I come on let's walk together can you say amen hallelujah God took that scarred human being and God was so satisfied with him that he paid the price for me so that wend Martin amen could stand before you today and say he lives he lives Christ Jesus lives today he walks with me he talks with me all along life's narrow way if the musicians would come praise the Lord now the religious men they they would cast Shadows on Jesus man taking sides with Jesus brother Brandon would say but Jesus they tried to find every little Shadow they could find to try to belittle him in the sight of the people and that's what the devil wants he wants to hurt your influence that's the way you want you you that's that's they want to hurt your influence before the people and that's the way you want to watch careful what you do walk like real men of God talk like men of God act like men of God live like men of God because the devil your adversary is going around like a roaring lion trying to devour what he can why did they do this they were jealous of him that's the reason they tried to belittle him they was jealous of his ministry the reason and they were trying to belittle he had the ministry of God they knew that but it was contrary to their Creeds so they were trying to belittle him and make make everything he every little flaw that they could find and give him out of the way they wanted him to quit they wanted the people to denounce him they wanted to say now this guy's nothing look at here now there he is he did this and you know that's not right you've been taught all your all of our life that we should believe the elders and here he is stood right there and bald the Elder out he disagreed with the traditions of the fathers that we've been taught to believe the tradition of the fathers and we've been taught that by each Rabbi all these years through and here this man's coming around and disagreeing with him W the man like that ain't fit to be a preacher see they were trying to belittle him but in all that the ones that believed him loved him and seen all his scriptural Miracle signs would not be hindered by them no sir them who believed him believed him those who loved him stood by him and they would not see what others pointed out to them can you say Amen Jesus that long waited Messiah there he comes there he comes he's Healing The Sick he's ra in the dead Spirit of the Lord God is upon Him scriptures coming to pass it looks so beautiful [Music] oh but then when he died the 12 disciples or the 11 disciples were thinking we thought that he was the one clouds try to come over their eyes we thought we had hoped we were with him for three and a half years man there were a couple disciples walking on the road to EMAs Jesus caught up with him why you guys so sad HH have you not heard Jesus we thought he was the Messiah and they killed him we had thought Jesus said well you don't say he says oh you slow of heart you act like fools they looked over to him saying what are you talking about we were with him we ate with him we know this guy's a good guy he was our Messiah we thought Jesus says I agree with you I do I do but what you're missing here is he had to go go into the ground and then he started all the way back with Moses and started giving the light of the scripture and before you know it all the clouds of Doubt were being pushed away and they begin to start thinking something there's there there's something going on and when he went into that house and he broke that bread clouds left they said you're the one oh if we could just see that we're the ones we're the ones the Masterpiece is here this [Music] morning amen the suspicious Mountain has lost its power Sunshine is on it I'm not scared of this old body anymore I'm going to bring it under the under the conviction of the holy spirit this old flesh ain't going to control me anymore and those old doubts and fears I've got the blood for that Sunshine of Revelation it says I shall Prevail well glory to God I'm sorry that it wasn't any better amen than what I preached here this morning but I'm here to tell you amen I I if if if if if we can just go beyond the Shadows of doubt if we can just go beyond all the Shadows I don't know I don't know I don't know what's bringing your shadows on amen you might have a rebellious Spirit that'll Shadow over the light you might have a you you you might have a grudge against somebody that'll that'll that'll that's that that becomes a cloud won't you let Divine Revelation Eternal purpose of God just come in and once and for all someone says well when you preach like this brother wend when you preach like this someone told me uh uh one time they said what you're doing is you're giving people a laxness you're giving people a LAX saying it's okay to stay in their mistakes I said how can that be that would be just as stupid as Jesus to remain inside the tomb when the Resurrection comes Jesus ain't going to stay inside inside the tomb and say I think I'm just going to stay in this H and make this my house dear God he's coming out and when the revelation of who you are truly strikes you you find out there ain't no scars going to keep me down there ain't no mistakes going to keep me in the grave there ain't nothing when I'm here to tell you amen Resurrection morning is fixing to come again and there ain't nothing going to keep Grandma in the ground there ain't nothing going to keep you on the [Music] ground amen I like preaching these kind of messages cuz I just like rubbing it in the devil's face you don't have enough devil and I say that for you young people the devil ain't got enough he ain't got enough he ain't got enough that's right you say that's pretty bold statement you ain't got enough devil there ain't a cloud in the sky you know why because God's given us a message that tells us who we are now some people take them as I said Wednesday night some people take the message and and make the message uh you know uh uh uh you know full of defeat and and and condemning and and and and amen but I'm here to tell you the prophet's message had a two-fold purpose condemn Egypt and to bring you and I out we're no longer slaves and I just want to tell you God ain't one of those kind of of husbands that are just belittling the wife and making the wife feel like she's a scumback amen I believe God loves his wife with all of his heart and I'll tell you something else this bride loves her Lord with all of her heart it's a love relation relationship God's not looking for a way to throw you to Hell God's looking for a way to get rid of the cloud so that you'll know who you [Music] are I get so mad at that condemning devil holding past over the people's heads it's not God God don't hold your past over your heads God relieves you of it sets you free of it he don't take away the scars the scars are there it's good [Music] memory Jesus has got scars and every time he looks at the scars he thinks of you Mary every time he looks at his scars he sees you brother Steve the scars are reminders of the trophies Hallelujah we might have scars here on this Earth and I'm here to tell you we've got a lot of them but I'm

such theeman expressions of Love is because when you should be in the scrap peeps in the dumb you're not [Music] there [Music] and when you look at yourself [Music] now there's always going to be a cloud if you're just constantly looking at you it's the reason why we should never look at another man's Doctrine we should never look at another man's it's it's a cloud we look at one Doctrine and that's the doctrine of redemption that's the love of Christ so shed and that's what the prophet brought us was a living reality of Jesus and that's why we want the power of the Holy Spirit does so come upon us I believe old things are changed are passed away all things have become new why because he's able to remove all clouds all offense all wrongs all sins and just as quickly just as quickly as you say I'm wrong God says and I also [Music] say that your sin is no [Music] more it's no wonder the prophet of God says it it doesn't necessarily take it it doesn't necessarily come and beating an altar no no it don't it don't take that when your heart's true before God and you're repen of of it it's that quick hitting yourself there takes dying out to where Sin is Sin and you're no longer trying to justify it you're you're right there before him saying I you wrestle wrestle that thing out and sometimes you have to stay at that altar until you have wrestled the thing [Music] out but he's faithful that right praise the lord well praise the Lord amen Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed get out of the corner get out from underneath the bed he invites his chosen
