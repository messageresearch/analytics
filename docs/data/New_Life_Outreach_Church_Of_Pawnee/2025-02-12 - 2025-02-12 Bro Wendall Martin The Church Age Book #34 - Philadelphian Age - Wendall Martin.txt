are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly and hold the hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches now this is going to be a really interesting um uh Church age

one um huh okay um well we'll actually here's here's one here now I don't know whose this is so you have to make sure you give it back um at this one here is easier is there any other ones that's needing Church age books tonight you need one the only thing is is is I don't I don't know uh what the page number is going to be um does anyone does anyone know what the red the numbers for the red book is oh yes yeah yeah Philadelphia yeah awesome glad we got some smart people in here amen um all right okay uh now there's now we do have we do have a few more books um I've got I've got some in the the office too so if we're needing uh books here this evening all right it says Philadelphia was 75 miles Southeast of Sardis it was the second largest city in Lydia it was built upon several Hills in a famous wine growing District its coins bore the head of buckas and the figure of a bante priestess of bakas the uh population of the city included Jews Christians of Jewish origin and converts from heathenism the city suffered frequently or or frequent earthquakes and yet its duration was the longest of the Seven Cities of Revelation in fact the city still exist under Turkish name of uh aleshire or the city of God the mage of the coins suggests the deity of the city to be bakas now bakas is the same as ninis or Nimrod he is the lamented one though most of us think of him in terms of rry and drunkenness what illumination this brings to our minds here is a coin with the God on one side and the Priestess or propheus on the other Now flip a coin does it matter which way it comes down no sir it is still the same coin that is the romanish religion of Jesus and Mary but we are not thinking of Rome only no there is not only the great Harlot certainly not for she by her fornication has become a mother her daughters now are coins of the same Mage they're on one side of the coin they have drawn up a worship of Jesus and on the other they have the Priestess or Prophet us also she writes her Creeds and dogmas and tenants and sells them to people for salvation insisting that she and she alone has the True Light how remarkable is the fact that this age is characterized by the coin for mother and daughters are all buying their way to heaven money and not blood is the purchase price money and not spirit is the power that moves them the God of this world World Mammon hath blinded their eyes but their dealings in death will ens soon for this is the age that the spirit cries behold I come quickly even so come quickly Lord Jesus the age Philadelphia Philadelphian age lasted from 1750 to 1906 this age due to the meaning of the name of the city has been called the age of Brotherly Love as Philadelphia means love of brother the messenger the messenger to this age was without doubt John Wesley John Wesley was born of Epworth June 17 1703 and was one of the 19 one of 19 children born to Samuel and Susanna Wesley his father was a chaplain in the Church of England but it it is more than likely uh it is more than likely that the religious turn of John's mind was based more upon his mother's ex exemplary life than upon his father's theology John was a brilliant scholar it was while he was at Oxford that he and Charles become part of a group who were spiritually exercised to worship on the basis of experimentally living the truth rather than making Doctrine their their standard they drew up a spiritual guide of works such as giving to the poor visiting the sick and the imprisoned for this they were called methodists and other duress of NE titles now John was sufficiently uh imbued by his vision of the need of religion for the peoples of the world that he went to America Georgia as a missionary among the Indians on his way there he found that many of the ship's passengers were moravians he was deep deeply impressed by their meekness peace courage in all circumstances his labors in Georgia in spite of self-denials and hard work was a failure he returned to England crying I went to America to convert the Indians but oh who shall convert me but in London he again met with the moravians it was Peter bowler who showed him the way of Salvation he was truly Born Again much to the dismay and event anger of his brother Charles who could not understand how such a spiritual man as John should say he was not formerly right with God it was however not long after that Charles too was saved by grace Wesley now began to preach the gospel in those pull pits in London to which he formly had access but soon they turned him out it was at this time that his old friend George Whitfield told him in a in good stead uh for he in uh stood him in good stead for he invited John to come and help him preach in the fields where thousands were listening to the word Wesley at first was incredulous that he should preach in an open field instead of a building but when he saw the throngs and saw the working of the gospel and the power of the spirit he turned wholeheartedly to such preaching the work soon took on such proportions that he begin sending out numerous laymen to preach the word this seemed like a parallel to Pentecost where the spirit raised up men with power to preach and teach the word almost overnight there was violent opposition to his work but God was with him the workings of the spirit were mightily manifested and often such Spirit of conviction took hold of the people as to take away their strength and they would fall to the ground crying in great distress over their sins Wesley was a remarkably strong man he says of himself that he could not remember to have felt loness of spirits for even a quarter hour since he was born he slept no more than six hours a day arose in time to start preaching at 5: practically every morning of every day of his ministry preached up to four times on a single day so that in a year he would average over 800 sermons that is incredible he traveled multiple thousands of miles as he did as did his circuit Riders who carried the gospel near and far in fact Wesley traveled 4500 miles per year by horse he was a believer in the power of God and he prayed for the sick with great faith and wonderful results many of his meetings saw the manifestation of spiritual gifts Wesley was not in favor of organization his associates did have a society who were a company of men having the form and seeking the power of godliness United in order to pray together to receive the word of exhortation and to watch over one another in love that they may help each other to work out their salvation the only condition of those entering was that they should be one of those who had desire to flee from the Wrath to come and to be saved from their sins as time went on they worked out a strict set of rules to be used in self-discipline for the good of their souls Wesley recognized that after his death the movement would be organized and the spirit of God would leave them to dead form he once remarked that he did not fear that the name of Methodist would leave the Earth but that the spirit might take his flight during his lifetime he could have acquired vast wealth but he did not his favorite saying on the subject of money was get all you can save all you can and give all you can how strange it would be for Wesley to come back and see the denomination that bears the name of Methodist today they're rich vastly rich but the life and power of John Wesley is missing it should also be mentioned that Wesley never did desire to build a work upon denomination ational or sectarian basis though he was an Armenian in his beliefs he did not want to separate himself from Brethren on the grounds of Doctrine he was a good candidate for James he based his eternal life on faith and works or the or the living of the life rather than simply accepting a Creed or a doctrinal statement John died John Wesley died at the age of 88 having served God as few men would dare to even think they might re the S the salutation Revelations 3:7 unto the angel of the Church of Philadelphia write these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth oh how beautiful are these words How Majestic even the sound of them how thrilling to think that all those attributes can be app to one person who would dare to say such things about himself but Jesus Christ the lord of Glory I believe the key to interpreting exactly what each of these wonderful descriptive phrases means is found in verse 9 behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say that they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved Thee I say this verse is the key because it deals with the Jews who have always called themselves the children of God to the exclusion of everyone else they crucified and killed the Lord Jesus Christ their terrible Deeds brought their own blood upon their own heads for centuries all because they refused Jesus as their Messiah which indeed he was to them he was not the coming one nor the son of David to them he was be elub or some unrighteous one fit only for Destruction but not so he was indeed Emmanuel God manifest In the Flesh he is indeed Messiah surely he was exactly as he now sets himself forth to be there he is the same Jesus Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that Holy One in the midst of the lamp stands is the very same Jesus who walked the shores of Galilee who healed the sick who raised the Dead who in spite of irrefutable proof was crucified and killed but he arose again and is seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high the Jews did not call him holy then they do not call him holy now but he is the Holy One psalm 16:10 for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption they sought their righteousness after the law and and failed miserably for by the law can no flesh be justified by the law can no man be made holy Holiness is of the Lord 1 Corinthians 1:30 but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom righteousness sanctification and Redemption 2 Corinthians 521b that we might be made the righteousness of God in him it was Christ or perish and they perished for they refused him and the men of that age even as today were making the same mistake as the Jews took refuge in the synagogue form of worship so in the Philadelphian age they were taking refuge in the church it is not joining a church that counts the life isn't is not in a church the life is in Christ this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the son hath not life man is made Holy by the spirit it is the spirit of Holiness that raised up uh that raised Jesus from the dead that indwells us and makes us holy with his Holiness there he stands stands the Holy One and we will stand with him clothed in his righteousness holy with his Holiness now this age is the sixth age in the eyes of God time is drawing to a close he will soon be coming back and the soon the cry will come forth as he comes and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is Holy let him be holy still Revelations 2211 me oh I'm so glad that my Holiness is not of myself I am glad that I'm in Christ with all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed yay imparted unto me blessed be God forever these things saith he that is true now this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true in the sense that it is opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its per uh partial realization for example we recall that Jesus said in John 6:32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven John 15 And1 I am the True Vine Hebrews 9:24 for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hand which are the figure of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for US 1 John 2 and8 because the darkness is passed and the True Light now shines since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before anti-type contrasted with type and substance with Shadow take example now of the Mana from Heaven God sent down Angel bread from heaven for Israel but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day if it was left around it become contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from heaven where of Mana was just a type and if any man eats of that bread that came from Heaven uh he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no need any longer for a shadow no need for a partial salvation here is the whole of it Gees just like Jesus isn't a part of God he is God no one can deny that Israel had light they were the only people who had light as a nation as it was it was uh when Egypt was so dark that one could feel it but in the homes of the Israelites there was light but now True light has come the light of the world is Jesus Moses and the prophets brought the light by means of the scripture relative to the Messiah thus Israel had light but now the Fulfillment of the light has come what was but glowing word has now broken forth into the brightness of God manifested among his people and as the pillar of fire gave light at night that was wonderful now light and life were manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodily that just makes me want to shout hallelujah Jesus used to take the red or the Israel used to take the red heer and and sacrifice her upon the Altar for the remission of sins for a year the sins of the guilty one was covered but that covering couldn't take away this desire for sin it was not a perfect offering it was a shadow until the real come along so each year the man would sacrifice and each year come back because he still had the same desire to sin the life of the animal atoned for his sin but being animal blood that was shed and animal life that was given it could not come back upon the man if it had come back it still would not have availed but when Christ the perfect substitute was given and his blood was shed then the life that was in Christ came back upon the repentant Sinner and the life being the perfect life of Christ sinless and righteous then the guilty one could go free for he had no desire to sin the life of Jesus had come back upon him that is what is meant in Romans 8 and2 the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death but the Jews back there in the time of Jesus did not want to accept that sacrifice the blood of bulls and goats made nothing perfect it was once God's ordained method but now Christ had appeared in the flesh and by the shedding of his own blood has put away sin and by that offering of himself has made us perfect the Jews did not take that but what about the Philadelphian age and yes the other ages too did they really accept this reality in Christ no sir even though Luther brought the truth of justification the Roman the Roman Church and its eastern counterpart the Orthodox Church still clung to works now works are fine but they don't save you you don't they don't make you perfect it is Christ or perish it is not even Christ and works it is Christ Alone this age began the years of Armen arminianism that does not believe in Christ as the reality it does not sing of nothing but the blood for it sings of nothing but the blood and my own conduct now I believe in Good Conduct if you are saved you will do righteously you are all we've already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus it is Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord from the start to finish it is all God let his life be in me let his blood cleanse me let his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and mouth let it be his stripes that heals me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness which I have done no sir Christ is my life and can we all say amen amen Christ is my life now now I want to I I want to uh stop here for a minute because now it's easy for us to look it's it is it's easy for us to look at the Catholic Church as as work oriented and that you have to do you know uh count so many beads you have to go through uh you have to pay so much to get out of purgatory you have to do a lot of these things that that are there but but brother bradam would say amen he he he would and he would he would talk about you says but what about this Philadelphian age and the and the other ages and this at the first of the uh 294 he says did they really accept the reality in Christ and he says no sir even though Luther brought justification the Roman Church and his counterpart the Orthodox Church still clung to works now and and and I I want to clarify because there is there is nothing that that any of us can do again to ever inherit eternal life Jesus and Jesus alone has eternal life there's no good works that any of us can do to inherit it now but on the other hand now brother brandham has talked on throughout the the church age book that everyone is that that the that the denomination ational churches are are are are uh work related they're they're they're um uh they are they are basing their salvation upon their works now it's easy for us to look and say well they cut their hair they they they they the ladies wear pants uh these days guys are getting more feminist and we're saying Works see works works related is anything and a trusting putting our trust in anything outside of Christ and his word so so to some um Works some is well you give them the scripture and you say but now the scripture says and they'll say listen I I witness I'm a preacher I'm a singer I I work for the Lord so to them that's eternal life to them they're going to be accepted by God I I give to the poor I do this these these are all to them works now and we can be the same way in in our in in in in this church right here tonight and say I wear long hair I I I have I have uh uh long flowing dresses as men can say I'm not cheating on my wife I'm not doing these kinds of things and so I am right with God there's only one way that you're right with God and that you possess eternal life and that is the spirit of life that made Jesus perfect made that body perfect lives in you so the spirit of God that lived in that body that made Jesus the perfect sacrifice amen so that he would forgive your sins but having your sins forgiven does not mean that the Holy Spirit or the spirit of life has come back upon you amen we can be justified but we don't want to just be justified we want the Holy Spirit to come back upon us and live within us and and um you know and I I've I've I was thinking here in um there in in the book of Ephesians and we'll we'll get back to reading but um and especially for you kids I would like I'd like for you to turn there if if y'all don't mind um Ephesians 1 now the the the the the the scripture that I love and and brother Bram quoted that thing if he quoted it once he quoted it hundreds of times uh how how many knows uh especially those of you that listen to tapes a lot you've heard brother brandom use that John 5:24 he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me ha PA hath eternal life and has passed from Death un unto life um matters of fact I've got it here 6 C 5 John 5:24 um and and I would just read it together that way I don't mess it up I say unto you that he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me have everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life now Christ is the only means for receiving eternal life now the the the God of all eternal life lived in Jesus Jesus Paid that price so that that God of all eternal life can now come back upon us as the believer and and what and and this right here in in Ephesians 1 and um 13 I believe it is uh it says now I want you to see this order in whom ye also trusted after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation so you heard the words of Christ in whom after that ye believed then ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory Glory so God is not wanting to make us people of Good Works he doesn't want us to be good people his intention is to live in US eternal life living in us so so we we so we're not we can't measure ourself by the works and say okay I'm a Christian I've got eternal life because well I go to New Life uh brother Wendell's my pastor uh brother random is our prophet and uh and so we're all we're all going to no you you can't you can't do it that way it's the life of Jesus Christ Living in you can you say Amen so we want the life of God to always flow through through through us and while you're there we we'll turn on over to there's another one there in Ephesians uh 3 and um let's see uh uh I thought I had it here oh no 4:30 I'm sorry Ephesians 4:30 and then we'll go continue on it says um and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption let not bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice but being kind affection uh uh to one another tender heart and forgiving but grieve not the holy spirit so it's it that Holy Spirit is what SEALs that Holy Spirit is what gives us eternal life can you say Amen so that's what brother brandham is saying it's not it's not Jesus plus Works amen that now y'all you kids understand okay so if you read the book of uh uh if you read there in in the Book of Romans and you read uh Romans uh 2 and the the second chapter and the third chapter brother brand or the Apostle Paul is is dealing with the works of the law because many were trying to say I'm a good person I can but the but the Apostle Paul was saying no this is not what God is after he says God uh uh he says you have those that are of the circumcision that are following the law and yet and and and and yet they possess not eternal life and then you have the Gentiles who does not have a law and saying you've got to live by this code of conduct but he says but it shows the law of God written in their heart because their conscience is accusing or excusing them so when brother brandom is dealing with works that is anything anything we can use works as anything well I go to church all the time well or I'm the pastor or I'm I'm a song leader or I'm a I'm a musician or I'm this or that and we can use that as a crutch as if that is what makes us who we are it is Jesus Christ and his life in us period can you say amen and because of that life in me then he lives his life freely he lives is life freely in me so so I I don't I don't even well praise the Lord can I can I show you one more scripture here real quick uh uh there there in in the book of um uh first corini I believe it is where's where's that where's that scripture found out that says uh when you the unprofitable servant uh when you've done it all let's see um oh oh boy um no that that's that's that that's uh Jesus said that Jesus is using that let me look here real quickly amen okay so um praise the Lord okay so Luke 17 and 7 it says but which of you and you can turn Y and then we'll get back to reading so so what what we do to the Lord the Apostle Paul says present your body as a Living Sacrifice which is your reasonable service it's something that hey he saved you by his grace he come and redeemed you you you were Sinners you were filthy you were you were wretched you you you without Jesus you would have no hope in this life none whatsoever and so he so so at the end of the job at the end when when you've when you've prayed and you fasted and you're and you're going to church and you never miss a service and you do all the you still can't come up to God and say I'm a pretty good old fell I need a I need a pat on the back amen let's read what let's what Jesus says about it here and this is a good one to remember too all right Luke 177 but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he comes when he has come from the field go and sit down to eat me and will not rather say unto him make R make ready wherewith I may Su and G myself and serve me till I have eaten and drunken afterwards Thou shalt eat and drink does he thank this thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded to him I think not so likewise when you have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do amen so even after even after I mean even after it's all said and done I'm still an unprofitable servant there is nothing I can do you see what I'm saying not my goodness not my singing not my preaching not not anything else I do I cannot come before the Lord and say ha no that's my reasonable service that that that that is something that that I ought to do amen because of God's grace upon me it earns me no points no brownie points when it's all said and done that's why when that's why brother Bram says when he comes and though he has won those Millions to the Lord and and and if they ever come to give him a crown he says I'll take the crown and put it at the feet of Jesus Jesus cuz I'm not worthy of it that's an in unprofitable servant can you say amen amen so so when you've done it all Hallelujah I I thought i' I'd wrote it down here in the Amplified I um uh yeah yeah here in Luke 17 And1 so you two when you have done everything was assigned and commanded to you say we are unworthy servants undeserving of Praise or a reward for we have not gone beyond our obligation we have merily done what we ought to do I thought that was pretty good amen all right so let's go let's go back here to uh let's so it's not it's not salvation Plus or it's not Jesus plus works it is Jesus and Jesus alone oh I hope that's so real to you it's life it's the life of God oh let us strive it's not in your prayer what what would it be in a in a one hour prayer and not getting a hold of God than a and compared to a heart that that is so wanting to come in God and maybe you only spend 15 minutes but you're weeping before God and you're and you're you're in fellowship with God God would rather have the 15 minutes of real genuine life than to have all of this other flowery stuff Stu he wants life he wants his spirit in us he wants us to be a part of him amen he says uh the first paragraph he says I feel I could just go on and on about these truths but I will give you one more thought it is about the wonderful hymn that AB Simpson wrote once it was the blessing now it is the Lord once it was the feeling now it is his word once his gift I wanted now The Giver once I sought for healing now himself alone all in all forever Jesus will I sing Everything Is Jesus and Jesus everything can I hear an amen there isn't anything in this life satisfying as it may be as good and as fine as it may be but you will find the sum total of all perfection in Christ everything fails Fades into insignificant besides him he that hath the Key of David this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding phrase he that is true Christ the perfect realization contrasted with the partial realization here it is Moses was a prophet of God but Jesus like unto Moses was the prophet of God David a man after God's Own Heart was the king of Israel but Jesus is the greater David King of Kings Lord of lords God very God now David was born of the tribe of Judah out of whom no priest came yet he ate of the shoe bread reserved for priest he was a great warrior overcoming the enemy established the people as king he sat on the throne he was a prophet he was a wonderful type of Christ now it says in Isaiah 22:22 and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and None Shall shall shut he shall shut and None Shall open the spirit uses this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church what the Key of David signifies at that time is mar Shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstand now go catch this church he's saying that it was just a shadow then but it is now in its completion it right now in you he says was a mar Shadow but now fulfilled in in Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection not his Earthly pilgrimage but what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it's not in His Hands it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has the right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it's on his shoulder but what does that shoulder what does shoulder have to do with it read Isaiah 9 and6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the East I just love this when the bride has been committed to the groom to take off her veil and places it on the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under his Dominion she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility that beloved is the Key of David God being Sovereign he forew by Divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and him alone she is wholly committed to him and accepts the obligation he he or see she is ho wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of the church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her Delight but have men in heeded this truth have they esteemed his person who alone has the full Sovereign authority over the church I say no for in every age the church has been governed by a hierarchy a priesthood an Apostolic succession closing the door of mercy and Grace To whom it will and instead of assuming the love and responsibility of the church it has been the uh mercenary lust prayed upon her and destroyed her the clergy lived in luxury while the poor fed on the husk of abuse not one age did any different each bound itself to organization and put government upon men and committed the church to that government dare let any let the people rise up they were be brutally suppressed and cast out every denomination has the same Spirit every denomination swears it has the key to the government of the church every denomination claims that it opens the doors but that is not true it is Jesus and Jesus alone he sets the members in his body he endows them with their Ministries he puts the gifts at her disposal he cares for and guides her he is she is his sole property and he has no other one but her someone shout hallelujah what a far cry from reality is this church age in which we live we one and one day soon these men that even now purport to speak for the church will be rising up in the acumenical move to place the living Antichrist at the head of the organization which deposes the Lord and we will call him Christ out outside the church saying behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will suck with him and he with me Revelations 3:20 but let me say this our Lord is not defeated men claim to open the door to God and shut the door they are liars all that the father hath given him will come to him and he that cometh to him uh in no wise will be cast out he will lose none of them St John 637 to-39 when the last elected member to the body of Christ comes in then will our Lord appear the Key of David was not David the king of Israel all Israel is not Jesus the son of David according to the fact that he will sit upon the throne of David and the Millennium and Reign and rule over his Heritage surely so the Key of David signifies that it is Jesus he will bring in the Millennium he who has the keys to death and hell will raise up his own that they may share in his reign of righteousness upon the Earth how beautiful that our Lord has all the answers truly in him are all the promises of God fulfilled truly by being in him we are HS to what he purchased for us yes there he stands the Lord Of Glory once as the father he was surrounded by the Angels and Archangels the cherubims and the seraphim and the whole host of Heaven crying holy holy holy is the Lord God of host such was his Holiness that no man could approach unto him but now we see him in the church sharing his own Holiness with us until in him we have become the very righteousness of God hallelujah yes and there he stands Jesus perfect everything lily of the valley bright and Morning Star the fairest of 10,000 Alpha and Omega rude and offspring of David Father Son and Holy Ghost all in all Isaiah 9 and6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace in him is perfect fulfillment the once we established him not or esteemed him not now we love him with joy unspeakable and full of Glory in the midst of the church he stands and we will sing his praise for he is mighty the mighty conqueror for he the mighty conqueror is head over the church which is his bride he bought that bride he owns her she is his and his alone and he cares for her he is our King we are his kingdom Eternal POS his eternal possession now you will recall that at the beginning of verse 7 I said that verse 9 would help us to understand it I hope you saw what I meant Jesus set himself forth as he did as as he that is Holy true the only reality the one with the Key of David the one who opened and shut that is exactly true those phrases describe him perfectly but the Jews in his day refused him and all he was they rejected their Savior and all he meant to them and the ninal Christian has now done the same they have done what the Jews did exact exactly the Jews crucified him and then turned on the True Believer the nominal Christian has crucified a fresh the True Believer the nominal Christian has crucified him aresh and turned on the true church to destroy it but God is true and he who is above all will yet return and when he does he will show who the only potentate is as he proves himself to be to the world and all the world bows at his feet and at that time all the world will bow at the feet of the Saints proving that they were right in their stand with him blessed be God forever what a powerful reading tonight guys Oh Glory to God he's chosen us he made us we're insufficient of ourselves do you see why we don't want to even halfway try to earn anything it's his glory he so loved us he brought us into that himself how blessed we are how blessed we are as his sons and daughters or as his bride aren't you glad for his Divine love his divine grace I I I you know just just read beaten this and uh you know you prepare and think of things if the Lord would you know look up look up scriptures as I'm as as I'm reading and I and and um every time I would I'd come back to that uh uh the perfect and the partial realization and how that uh uh if we if we as the church really understands as his life is with in us and that key we are his shoulders or his his authority is upon the church The Living Church of God no wonder he says in my name you'll cast out devils in my name you you'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I don't want to ever do anything in my own I want his life in me 100% I want his life I want his anointing upon me amen whatever I have to surrender myself to let me surrender myself to his word and his word alone let it be Jesus Christ in me and him alone is that your desire here tonight so we will we we will start reading on this uh 298 did you enjoy that reading tonight my my my my amen hallelujah amen so we we are we are very thankful to him this evening how thankful we should be his life amen his life uh upon us and through us and we just we ought to be so of all people we ought to be so thankful for that here tonight are there any are there any questions or um that do you kids do do you kids understand what I was talking about on Works related y'all y'all understand uh is are there any qu even if some of you adults want to you know uh if there's something that I need to clarify a little bit more Let Let me just let me just ask this okay so if it's not work related okay so if works if we are saved outside of works then why do we do works is that a is that a good question why why is it that we if we're not saved by if you girls aren't saved by long hair then um and you're not saved by by anything else it is it is nothing but your belief in Christ and Christ alone then then why do we do them yes yeah works works is is is Faith expressed it's the life of God in you living its nature through you see you can have you can have u i I'll pick on these two girls right here so they can they can be the best of friends both of them's good singers both of them's pretty one short and uh I mean one's tall um so but and and both of you go to church both of you raised in church but one has the Holy Ghost and one doesn't okay all right which one's again so so um since I pick on Haven so much I want to put you as the Holy Ghost all right you got the Holy Ghost and uh so I'm G to I'm want to get it when I get home or get out of here now Haven loves the Lord Aubrey loves the Lord and and um but there's there's a difference between them both of them have long hair both of them sing pretty both of them cry both of them uh but one still has the nature of sin in them now this is not true I'm just using you as an as an example and that nature of sin it makes it all work related so she has to make her she knows it's right because the Bible she hears it all the time but there comes a time where that nature is going to come out there's going to come a time where you're going to just get tired of the of of the rules and the regulations because it's all works and and you'll and and you'll get discouraged and you'll and and you'll want a bucket because you're you're you're you you've still got that sin nature in you on the other hand this one that has the baptism of the Holy Ghost May struggle growing up just like you would struggle growing up but you've got something on the inside of you it's the life of God that is correcting you that is that that is as I as I um as I quoted a while ago there in the book of Romans uh Romans and you can put that up to Romans 2 and4 when the Gentiles which have not the law do by Nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show The Works of the law written in their hearts and their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or excusing one another so so you so you can it's it's what is considered a law and and and you're having to and it's and it's a law you just you know you it's you're having to make yourself or your mama's making you or the preacher's making you or something's making you and then but over here you're learning you're still learning you you still have to repent you still have to that's that's not that's that's not it there the nature of the Holy Spirit on the inside of you is is bringing your body bringing your mind everything about you into The Obedience of the holy God that holy God lives in you living his life you see what I'm saying so that's the reason why some kids can they they they come up they're growing in church they come right up they come right up and then all of a sudden once they get that once they get that rebellious Years or or get gets to that point boom they're out and you think what happened I I thought they were good Christians and now they're all G now they're out what are they what see they didn't have the Holy Ghost there was there was there was a desire but they did not have the life it was work oriented see the life of God is not work oriented the life of God is life oriented it's who you are you see what I'm saying so as as so what that's what brother brandham is saying here he says everyone is going to the work side trying to trying to say to to make themselves look good around everyone I'm a Christian and they're missing out on Jesus and Jesus alone if the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies you see what I'm saying so so that's what it is now I am not saying you don't have the Holy Ghost amen so but but what I am but but y y I'm I'm showing y'all the contrast all of my buddies when I was growing up amen we we were all I had I had I had buddies uh we we had you know four or five good buddies and uh and did you know that that when when it was all said and done I was the only one I was the only one left standing and it wasn't that I was good it wasn't any of that is I was diligent to get the Holy Ghost and to make sure that I was secured in Jesus Christ have I had a lot of mistakes have and failures great day yes but there's one thing about me his Spirit has kept me all the days of my life Hallelujah good days bad days UPS Downs ins outs all of that that doesn't matter what matters is the life the life of God within every one of us how many wants the life of God in you amen amen so so I I I I I did so that's that's what I was trying to to make sure uh that I get a a the point across to y'all tonight now if there's anyone else that has anything else to say um uh any other questions anything like that y'all feel free we got done a little little early like 15 amen yes yeah coming to Pony and stuff and just kind of re-evaluate my life looking back kind of getting myself refocused and making sure I was on the right path yeah and stuff that was one of the things that that came up was like well I've done all this and I've done all this and and I I've been a Christian all these years and and I know God gave me the Holy Ghost when I got saved and stuff but that's just something that was just kind of bugging me like how I lived all those years and I did all those things God gave me I feel or showed me was like when um you get to the other side and there's that that scripture that talks about like separating the Lambs or the sheep and the like that and there there's the ones that come to God that did the works yeah that well didn't I do this and didn't I do that and didn't and he actually tells and they grew right up they loved God yeah they were Christians yeah Didn't I do this didn't I all this in your name didn't I cast out devils and didn't I sure and he said depart from me yeah and he actually told you know and there were the ones he had said you know when I was hungry you fed me and when I was naked you clothed me and when I when did I do that yeah they actually didn't recognize that they were doing works yeah they didn't realize that they were because it was a life that was in them that they didn't even they wanted to please God so bad they wanted to live that life so bad that they didn't realize they were already doing those works and it was pleasing to him said when when you when you fed the poor and when you you know all these things that they they realiz that they were doing it yeah and just something that God yeah showed me like yeah both profess to be Christians yeah and he told one yeah one realized that they were doing the works but I did this and I did you know the other didn't realize it at all it was just a life that was being Liv yeah and something amen amen that's good that's that is good and uh and and that's and that's what we want we want to we want to be so in love you know that song Falling In Love With Jesus was the best thing I ever done his his life just so living through us it's just you don't calculate it you don't it's just it's just who you are and what you are it it it flows out you know it just and and works it works its part of it Jesus says if a if if a if a brother asks you to go a mile he says tell him heck no I've worked all day today he says go two miles your brother asked for your coat give him your cloak also it's it's it but now you say oh my it's the life it's what's in you it's who you are here it exhibits Christ was the life of God that laid down his love life for every one of us so it's it's just who we are it's a sacrificial life that's the life of God in us so and you don't I don't I just don't I don't see Christ I don't see Christ keeping keeping count keeping score I just believe Christ was just he just oozed the life of God out of him God in Christ reconciling the world I can see brother Merle thinking nothing but yeah that and and that is true and and um um what is that Colossians Colossians 2:7 sister kala using uh that's not it um let's see Colossians um amen oh boy I've gotten so used to using a computer anymore I used to be able to I used to be able to find these things so easily It's Made Me Dumber um where where's where's that at Christ in you the hope this mystery oh it's it is it it's it's 2 Corinthians 2 2 Corinthians 2:7 amen Colossians 127 okay now now look at the beauty of this to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery what's the mystery of the church ages what's the mystery of it all and again I'm just a baby tonight as I've as I've been looking over this it's just just so rich to me the M the glory of the my is Christ in you it's God wanting to live in you what uh why would we ever turn that down why would we want why would we want to substitute that for anything else amen amen praise the Lord sister Carol mhm that's true that that is true and and in the Pentecostal and in the Pentecostal real chances are they did speak in tongues you know they they they might have and and and and they relied on those Works they relied instead of having the life of God I spoken tongues just like the the scripture that sister titha have we not cast out Devils that's works that's work related I I've I've cast out Devils so and Jesus will say no I don't even know yet so so it's not anything anything I cannot use anything that I do for the Lord as as as evidence that I have eternal life the only way that I'll know that I have etal etal life and that is if the spirit of Christ lives in me and agrees with his word amen hey I appreciate the conversation tonight and uh and and and adding to it because I think it does it does help our our young ones because I I want I I I want our kids to really understand this that we have um it's how how precious just what that we do have you know we're very we're very blessed anybody else and the musicians can can come praise the Lord amen amen you know I I'm believing I'm I'm believing for I'm believing for uh all of our all of our backsliders to come home leaving for those for those kids to come home and you've been an example before them and they just they they just they just need the life of God if they ever see it if they ever experience it it's really not even a choice when you experience the life of God you don't want anything else but him really the the rigid works and the the the rigid things of that is not is not what we're striving for we're striving for Life the Holy Spirit to live his life in us and that's what that's what all of these backsliders need they need to they need to experience Christ for himself the Apostle Paul did Peter did all of the old or all of those in the the book of Acts they experienced the the living Christ and it made them you couldn't turn them around you know and they weren't offered anything really spectacular they weren't offered homes businesses jobs they they weren't offered those things they were going to lose it all but what they experienced when they met Jesus Christ they were willing to die in defeat they were willing oh that life of Jesus is right here with us today so take us so take me Lord that's my cry tonight is that your cry father oh how we thank you Lord as I as I read tonight Lord just made me so broken not in a bad way but just so humbled that that you love your people that you have so this great mystery is now in us we're so thankful to be
