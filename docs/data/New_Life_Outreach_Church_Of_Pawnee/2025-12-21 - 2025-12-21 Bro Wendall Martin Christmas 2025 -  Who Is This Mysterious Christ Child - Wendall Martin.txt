And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. And his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much to please much displeased and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for as such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands on them, and blessed them. How many wants to be blessed this morning? How many wants to touch Jesus? How many believes he can be touched? &gt;&gt; I know he can be touched by the feelings of infirmities. Amen.

Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Aren't you thankful for the great plan of redemption that has been unveiled to us in this day that you and I would have a have a part, amen, in God and that God would redeem us back to himself. We thank God for that. Amen. And this is a um a wonderful season and um a season of reflection, a season of of of uh coming back to a man going back to the roots if you would God has done for us through Jesus Christ. And we say good morning to every one of you and and um we're just so glad to see everyone here this morning. Brother Josh, God bless you and sister Loretta, good to have you all back home. And um we've just been uh so blessed to have uh our names put in that lamb's book of life. And and what a family reunion that'll be when we all get to the other side. Hallelujah. You know, each of you have a have your own book of life. Well, God's got and we do. We have all we have our chromosomes. We have our DNA. We have all of those things that make up who we are. Well, God's got Amen. Uh he he he's got a book of life. And um all of you all of you were in his were in him before the foundation of the world. And that's the beautiful thing. Amen. To understand that we're all family. Hallelujah. Now, there might be a lot of human names here and and a lot of surnames, but what we are are children, sons, and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; And we're sure thankful for that. If you have your Bibles, why don't we turn here to Matthew the the 1st chapter? And um today is going to be a just a wonderful day. And um uh we uh want to um you know thank uh Sister Rose uh working with the with the young people and um uh and that that little lady's pretty creative and uh um and so we appreciate her and and I think Sister Khalila uh wrote the play and then uh Sister Uh Katrina has has been here with getting everything. She's she's the general. Amen. Uh you you walk in here when Sister Katrina walks in I mean all the kids all start shaking. Amen. Sit down, be good, and learn your part. And and so uh it's it's going to be uh now I and I was only here for the other day. So there if all of you who have been working in this, I know um I have been working with those three sisters. And so um everyone else who has had a part into this, we we say God bless you. I think brother brother Dylan and and brother Austin built some props and and uh uh so we say God bless them. But it's going to be a wonderful a wonderful day today and um I I trust that everyone can stay for uh for the entire day. Let's let's look here in Matthew 1 and8. It says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of God the father. Amen. Let's let's maybe I've got something in my glasses here. She was found with child of the Holy Ghost. And when Joseph, her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make a public example, was minded to put her away privately. And but while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife. For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. And now all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord of the Lord by the prophet saying, "Behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us." Then Joseph, being raised from the from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, took unto him his wife, and he knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus. Amen. So, why don't we just go to the Lord in prayer? Father, we want to thank you today for your goodness and and for your love. Lord, as we think of the song that we have just got through singing, Down from your glory, redemption story, you becoming a God, a a a savior to us. Lord, we thank you for it. Now Lord, we ask that you would be with us as we honor your precious name as we begin to think and and maybe Lord ponder in our hearts, Lord, your great plan. And I I pray, Father, that your blessings would be upon us this morning. Be with those who can't be here, Lord. Encourage them and heal them, Lord Jesus. We ask father that you would just minister to every heart as we as we sit now and waiting upon you in the name of the Lord Jesus. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated this morning. Amen. So we we are thankful for God's word and and for the clarity that God's word brings to us all. It's going to be a little I don't know. Um, you know, I I was telling the brothers, you know, I um uh just I've I've sort of had a a hard time this week just uh getting my mind on a on a on a certain uh Christmas message. And um and you say uh why would that be a problem? Um because Christmas is is big. &gt;&gt; Yeah. redemption is big &gt;&gt; and and while the world is is thinking about a baby in a manger and um um they've got their Christmas trees and and um while kids are trying to figure out how Santa Claus gets comes down the chimney and and um and and ultimately trying to figure out where Santa Claus is at. you know what's uh chapter and verse he's in in the Bible and &gt;&gt; and um and and on the first Christmas how many gifts were given out to everyone and &gt;&gt; um you know there's just a lot of those things that the world's trying to think of on this Christmas and amen whereas the truth is there was no Christmas tree on Christmas there was no Santa Claus on Christmas &gt;&gt; there was no gifts given on Christmas. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was um there there was no fireplaces and chimneys and and reindeer and Santa suits. So when we think about this Christmas season, I think it's it's imperative for us to I I thought maybe we would maybe go back in God's mind and and and his desires and and and maybe even ask the question, Amen, who is this mysterious Christ child? Um because uh he was definitely a mystery and I think the whole story of redemption, Amen, is is God becoming a human. And and I want us to just I just want us to deal with that here for a few moments this morning. And however it goes, I've got basically just a whole bunch of of scriptures here and and we'll just see how h how it goes. And if I flopped this this morning, just remember we're going to have a wonderful play this evening. &gt;&gt; That' be good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God becoming a human. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God becoming one of us. Uh uh and and and the ultimate the ultimate plan that God had in his mind was paying the ransom price. &gt;&gt; To pay the price of redemption. Amen. and and and and and to live h among and to live in his people. &gt;&gt; This is not about religion. This is not about uh uh uh creating some kind of a religious affair. This is about a king who had lost Amen. his prince. He had created a prince and his wife to rule the earth. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And that prince Amen. and his wife uh uh sold the human race out to sin. &gt;&gt; And now Satan is is is having a rampage. He's he's he's taken control. Uh uh he found a way to get into humanity. And and so now his demons and and the powers of hell are now ruling and reigning. death is is is wreaking havoc. Families are being destroyed. Bodies are dying because of that first uh that the his son and daughter at the beginning. &gt;&gt; AND SO GOD'S GOT THIS IN HIS MIND. God's God's looked there and and there's only one way that God can can can fix it. There's only one way that God CAN FIX IT. HUMAN humans was given the key to the earth. God said in the beginning, God said, "Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, the fowl of the air. Let them subdue the earth. LET THEM HAVE AUTHORITY over it." MAN HAS THAT AUTHORITY. BUT NOW HE'S UNDER, AMEN. he is under the demon influence. So the only way that God can come and fix IT ACCORDING TO HIS OWN WORD &gt;&gt; IS TO BECOME ONE OF US. &gt;&gt; He couldn't depend on he couldn't depend on on Adam's sons to be any better. &gt;&gt; He couldn't depend on anyone else to do anything any any more uh than what ADAM DID. THEY WERE ALL SINNERS. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Uh Cain Cain SLEW HIS HIS TWIN BROTHER. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. and and and and we find that amen it's just gone A THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of years of nothing but chaos, families, brokenness and and emptiness and Amen. But God HAD A PLAN. And I just want to say, Amen. God God seen the chaos. God seen the confusion. God seen the sin before the world was even created. And God already had a plan. &gt;&gt; GOD'S DESIRE, AMEN, was to redeem us back. And the only way that God could redeem us back is to become one of us. &gt;&gt; And and what I what I'm going to deal with a little bit this morning, amen, is is God did not send the second person of the Godhead uh to to to become a human being. God himself &gt;&gt; came to earth &gt;&gt; in a body &gt;&gt; to redeem you. &gt;&gt; GOD, SOMEBODY SAY GOD HIMSELF &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF &gt;&gt; came to earth &gt;&gt; came to earth &gt;&gt; in a body &gt;&gt; in a body &gt;&gt; to redeem you &gt;&gt; to redeem you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's big. &gt;&gt; That's bigger than Santa Claus. That's bigger than the elves. That's bigger than the North Pole. That's big. God becoming a human being to become one of us to feel our pain to understand our our our CONFUSED THOUGHTS TO YOU SAY GOD DIDN'T experience any of that. The Bible says he was in all points tempted. TEMPTED. SOMEBODY SAY TEMPTED. HE WAS HE WAS AT THAT STRUGGLE. AMEN. OF GOOD AND EVIL. HE HE KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because he become one of us. This is not about religion. This is about restoring the fallen sons and daughters back to their rightful position. And I want to tell you, let's just look at the end of the story. The Bible says that we will rule and reign on earth again. What Adam lo what Adam and Eve lost in the beginning, the meek shall inherit the earth. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, the end of redemption is bringing me and you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We will not always BE IN CONFUSION. WE WILL NOT ALWAYS BE IN BODIES OF DECAY. WE WILL NOT ALWAYS UH UH uh uh be born and die. Amen. We are we ARE IN THE RIGHT NOW. WE ARE IN THE FINALITY OF GOD'S GREAT PLAN. It's just about time for us to go home, PUT ON OUR NEW BODIES. WELL, BLESS THE NAME OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; But it could never have been done unless there had been &gt;&gt; God born a baby. &gt;&gt; God born a baby. Look. Look, look at that. You know, you think about this little baby that that that my wife's holding that grandbaby right there. Hallelujah. Get me a good-look fell. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine? Could you imagine Mary that virgin girl holding Jehovah? &gt;&gt; Holding Je. You say, "I I I have a hard time believing that, brother. Jehovah. Jehovah being a baby." It was Jehovah laying in the crib. &gt;&gt; IT WAS Jehovah playing on THE HILLSIDE. &gt;&gt; IT WAS JEHOVAH WHO WAS THERE IN JOSEPH'S CARPENTER SHOP LEARNING HOW TO BE A CARPENTER. GOD BECAME ONE OF US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I think s Satan hides in the shadows of ignorance. &gt;&gt; You see, when there's when there's ignorance, he'll hold you in darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. When when he has one over on you, then Satan prevails. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He his favorite line is ignorance is bliss. This This is Satan's favorite lines. Ignorance is bliss. Amen. Because if you don't know, then you don't have to worry about it. You can just ignore it. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, GOD DON'T WANT YOU BEING IGNORANT TO THIS GREAT PLAN OF REDEMPTION. GOD WANTS YOU TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND, WHAT he was doing AT THE BEGINNING SO THAT YOU CAN STAND AND IT WILL EMPOWER YOU IN THE DAY OF YOUR TEMPTATION. IT'LL EMPOWER YOU IN THE DAY OF WHEN EVERYTHING IS WREAKING HAVOC ON YOUR MIND AND IT FEELS LIKE IT'S ABOUT TO YOU'RE ABOUT TO EXPLODE. AMEN. GOD DON'T WANT YOU SITTING THERE IN IGNORANCE AND WONDERING IF YOU'RE A SON DAUGHTER OF GOD. DON'T WANT GOD DON'T WANT YOU SITTING THERE IN IGNORANCE AND AND WISHING YOU COULD BE MORE THAN YOU ARE. GOD WANTS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE THAT THE THAT THE THOUGHTS THAT HE HAD ABOUT YOU IN THE BEGINNING, AMEN, WERE DIVINE THOUGHTS. THEY WERE HOLY THOUGHTS. THEY WERE POWERFUL THOUGHTS OF you being an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so Satan will hide in the shadows of ignorance. But this isn't Amen. what God is has been wanting. It's and and and I and I and I I I look down through the seven ages. Amen. And we we have we've seen that it it was it was in Amen. Uh in the 300s. It was way back there. just 300 years after after Christ was born and he and he and he died and ascended. Amen. and and and and then religion came together and and and and formed the Catholic Church and and and uh and and and they put up uh statues of of Peter and Paul and Mary and and put these kinds of things up there and and and now MADE UH UH UH GOD, THIS GREAT REDEEMER, THE THE THIS GREAT PLAN OF REDEMPTION. AND THEY THEY PUT it in in in in statues and AND AND BURNING OF CANDLES AND AND JUST GOING TO CHURCH AND SITTING there and amen letting the preacher preach at you. But and it's went through ages after ages all down through these seven periods of time in church history. We we we can see how how it came out. you know, the uh here come Luther and he resisted the Catholic Church and a and so he he was of that first Protestant movement and and BUT BUT YOU FIND THAT HE BROUGHT IN HE brought in so much of their junk with him and and then here it come in and Wesley and here it come until here we are in this last stage until God is just a myth &gt;&gt; until it's the church is nothing but but light shows and music and and everyone all you know you can just Just just just just surf the internet. Amen. All I don't care. Even the Baptists, even they're are bouncing these days. Amen. They they got these lights and they've got the shows and they've got the music and everyone's Amen. But but but what about this MYSTERIOUS ONE? WHAT ABOUT THIS MYSTERIOUS? AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING. AMEN. THERE THE THE THIS CHRIST CHILD THAT CAME, HE DID NOT COME TO START ANOTHER MOVEMENT. HE CAME FOR REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; He came for a purpose. He had the thoughts OF GOD. I SAY HE WAS GOD. And that's what I want to deal with for a little bit here this morning. Can't you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you tired of living in ignorance? &gt;&gt; Amen. Haven't we lived in ignorance long enough? &gt;&gt; Amen. In the evening shadows, there shall be light. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that he's going to send a prophet in the evening time. And what was he GOING TO DO? TURN YOUR HEART RIGHT BACK TO THE scriptures &gt;&gt; so that you could see it the way God had it in the very beginning. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's in this day that God has has given us. Amen. The promise that the seals would be ripped off the book. &gt;&gt; Now we understand that. Amen. This the book has has been probed at. It's been it's it's it's been talked about. It's been preached about. But Amen. But believe me, all all of these thousand uh uh denominations that we have today, they they all base their stuff off this book right here. &gt;&gt; They they base it all right here off this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is because they haven't had a true understanding of God's plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; But did you know even in the book of Revelation, Amen, it was all written in symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. written in symbols that was supposed to be released, revealed in this generation at the at the sounding of the seven church age messenger, the mysteries of the mystery singular of God shall be finished. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So when we sit HERE THIS MORNING, I WANT US TO JUST ASK GOD, LORD, OPEN MY EYES. LET ME UNDERSTAND THIS CHRISTMAS LIKE I've never understood it. &gt;&gt; LET ME SEE IT THE way you want me to see it. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. So you can understand that the end time sign Amen. is the revealing of the son OF MAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE REASON. AMEN. And Jesus Christ, even in THE BOOK OF REVELATION, AS he was revealing himself, he was he WAS SOLIDIFYING WHO HE WAS. AMEN. You you can YOU CAN READ THAT ALL THROUGH REVELATION, IT IS JESUS SAYING, "I AM THE FIRST AND THE LAST. I AM THE ALMIGHTY GOD. I AM HE THAT WAS AND IS and shall come." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why are you spending these first few minutes on this?" is because denominationalism would separate us the holy God from his sons. Denominationalism, Amen. They they they they want to put everything that Christ was separate from God or that he was a Amen. And and and and and that God, you know, he sent his son. Well, I could you imagine any Could you imagine uh uh Kobe uh sending Simeon to go die? Amen. For somebody. Now, would that that that's pretty cruel. Amen. If if Kobe loves somebody and he wants to die for somebody, well, let Kobe die for somebody. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But don't make his son go die for somebody. &gt;&gt; You say now, "Oh, you're throwing thin ice right now." I am saying &gt;&gt; that God in order to un to make you and I to understand the great concepts, we're fathers, we're sons, we're humans. In order for us to understand the concept of what God is doing, God is going to say, "Amen. I'm going to create a body and call him my son, but I'm going to live inside that flesh. I'm going to redeem MY PEOPLE MYSELF. I AM NOT SENDING THE SECOND PERSON OF THE GODHEAD to do this. &gt;&gt; I'm not send you. Hallelujah. See, religion has it as God wants to kill you and Jesus wants to save you. &gt;&gt; RELIGION HAS IT THAT GOD WANTS TO AMEN. is it's just oh man, he's just ready to to make a grease spot out of you and he's created hell just for you. Amen. And then Jesus IS RIGHT THERE INTERCEDING. NO, NO, NO. THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE. HALLELUJAH. God wants you to understand that he was Jesus and that he is Jesus and Jesus is God. &gt;&gt; God could not save you as a spirit. God could not redeem you as a spirit. GOD COULD NOT HEAL YOU AS A SPIRIT. BUT GOD CREATED A BODY AND THAT BODY WAS SINLESS. AND THAT BODY BECOME A SACRIFICE. AND THAT BODY HAS REDEEMED ME AND YOU. THAT IS THE PLAN. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes. So, denominationalism has made this into it's a religious thing. Just come to church. And by George, if you'd please come to church at least three times out of the month, man, that'd be nice. I wish you would too. I w Hallelujah. When you fall in love with Jesus and you find who Jesus is, you you just don't have no other choice but to serve him. It's not religion to you. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet would tell us is that revelation is opening up to bring us strength &gt;&gt; to illuminate the word and to glorify his name. &gt;&gt; It was in the midst of the last two ages. the the two last ages that the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ blossomed before us. Yes, he knew we knew he was God. How else could he be our savior? But to know that he was only God or God alone, that he was the alpha and the omega, that this Jesus was both Lord and Christ, making him Lord Jesus Christ, Father, Son, AND HOLY GHOST, ALL ONE PERSON. YEAH, &gt;&gt; THAT had been lost in the since the first ages. And now we are seeing it again. The revelation of who he was has come back. &gt;&gt; INDEED, THE GODHEAD IS NOT A THREEPERSON GOD WITH one personality. It takes personality to make a person. IF THERE IS ONE PERSONALITY, there is but one person. Amen. But they who believe in a three persons have a three god godhead and are guilty of breaking THE FIRST COMMANDMENT. THE REVELATION OF THE GODHEAD IS BACK. THE TRUE church can build in strength again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now you say, do you do you believe? Do do you do do you have scripture for this? Do you have scripture for anything at different? &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You see, if people can't see the truth of the Godhead and and they fight it, they they can't ever see the rest of the truth of the scriptures &gt;&gt; because the revelation of Jesus Christ in his church and his works in the midst of the church for these last seven ages. YOU NEVER UNDERSTAND YOURSELF till you understand him. &gt;&gt; Now, have I am I making my platform &gt;&gt; pretty strong here this morning? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want I want you to understand that there's a difference. God's not wanting us to just come and celebrate a baby in a manger. That's not Hallelujah. Amen. Matters of fact, all through the scripture, if you want to just get down to it, Amen. There is not one speck of scripture in there where where they uh observed the the birth of Jesus. Amen. They observed his resurrection. &gt;&gt; They they observed Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But they never did observe his his birth until, as I say, and it wasn't even in the first church until until later on. And the reason they'd done it is they were trying to introduce back in the 300s trying to introduce pagan Rome in with Christianity. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THIS NONSENSE THAT THEY BROUGHT UP AND THAT'S WHEN THEY CAME UP with the trinity by the way was back there in in in uh uh in the 300s. That's when the nian council that's when they came together. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, LET'S LOOK AT SCRIPTURE AND LET'S GO BEYOND ALL OF THIS, ALL OF THIS UH UH uh uh Christmas bliss &gt;&gt; and LET'S GET A REVELATION OF WHAT HAPPENED 2,000 YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Hope this is all right. &gt;&gt; Now, so I want to start out this morning that this great mystery. The Bible says that there in in um uh first Timothy uh uh uh 3:16, I believe it is, Sister Keys. Amen. Great is the mystery uh without controversy. Great is the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh, &gt;&gt; justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received into glory. So God was manifest. Amen. One omnipotent spirit &gt;&gt; manifested in three offices. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; Son, and Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I want you to keep that in mind. SOMEBODY SAY, "ONE GOD." &gt;&gt; One God. &gt;&gt; Amen. MANIFESTED OR REVEALED in his fatherhood, revealed as a human, AND IS NOW REVEALED AS THE HOLY Ghost in you. Okay. the invisible God, the redeemer IN FLESH. NOW HE IS THE SPIRIT IN the redeemed. &gt;&gt; All right. You say now, now let's look at it again. Invisible God. &gt;&gt; Redeemer redeemed. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOD THE SPIRIT. GOD THE REDEEMER. GOD the redeemed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You say God can't be redeemed. Well, you just got through saying that God couldn't be in a body neither. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. GOD SPIRIT, GOD REDEEMER, GOD REDEEMED. It's the plan of redemption. GOD LIVING IN CHRIST. CHRIST BECOME THE FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now. All right. So, let's let's start. You got your Bibles? Let's let's start looking at some scriptures this morning. Praise the Lord. Amen. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Let's look here at AT AT COLOSSIANS 2 AND 9. AMEN. We're going to do a lot lot of skipping. So, I want you to uh also be writing your your scriptures. And I and I want you to put it I I I because I just said God the redeemer and God the redeemed. And I want you to understand what what God is doing here. Colossians 2:9, for in him CHRIST DWELLETH ALL THE fullness of the Godhead bodily. In other words, everything that God was in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; God revealed himself as Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope I hope this all comes together. Amen. cuz I sure don't want to let you guys stoning me and and uh uh but but but here but here here's the deal. God is Amen. God was revealed as Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the Bible says that later on he was revealed as Jehovah. Uh uh let let me let let me let me find it here just real quickly. How many loves him? &gt;&gt; Amen. He was revealed uh I' I've got this down here. Praise the Lord. Amen. I hope I've got it down here. Bless the name of the Lord. Amen. That the seven compound redemptive names of God. Y'all remember those? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um um praise the Lord. Well, Fooy. Amen. Thought I had those down here. Glory to God. Yes. Amen. Now, now here here's the seven compound redemptive names of God. Write these down and then look at them in your scriptures. Amen. God was revealed as Jehovah Gyra. They're in Genesis 22 and 14. The Lord my provider. He was revealed as Jehovah Rafa. Amen. Genesis 15:26. The Lord who heals. He was revealed as Jehovah Nissi. Amen. and Exodus 17 and 15. The Lord is my banner. &gt;&gt; He was revealed AS JEHOVAH SHALOM. The Lord is my peace. Judges 6 and 24. Jehovah Raha. Amen. In as the Lord is my shepherd. Psalms 23. He was revealed as Jehovah Titskanu. Jeremiah 23 and6. The Lord our righteousness. HE IS REVEALED AS JEHOVAH SHAMA. AMEN. which simply means the Lord is there there in in Ezekiel 48 and35. So here God has revealed himself. And then the Bible says that he come on over into UH WHEN WHEN GOD REVEALED HIMSELF UNTO uh uh uh to Moses. Amen. After Abraham WAS ALREADY GONE, THEN GOD SAYS, "I WILL REVEAL MYSELF IN A NAME THAT NOT EVEN ABRAHAM KNEW." &gt;&gt; YEAH. SO GOD WAS REVEALING HIMSELF. IT WAS A CONTINUAL REVELATION OF HIMSELF THROUGHOUT THE OLD TESTAMENT. AND IT WAS GOD JUST revealing his characteristics. I'm your shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. To the other. A little bit later on, I'm I'm your banner. And then a little bit later on, I I I'm I'm your provider. ARE Y'ALL UNDERSTANDING? THIS WAS GOD'S PROGRESSIVE REVELATION THROUGHOUT THE OLD TESTAMENT. GOD WANTING TO LET HUMANS KNOW THAT I I want fellowship. &gt;&gt; I want you to know that I'm your shepherd in your dark times. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M YOUR HEALER when you're when you're sick. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M YOUR PROVIDER WHEN YOU NEED PROVISION. IT WAS GOD REVEALING HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. But when it came to Jesus, Jesus, God emptied the whole Godhead, &gt;&gt; all of his names. When you look at When you look at at Jesus, he is the Lord, my provider. When you look at Jesus, he is the Lord, my healer. When you look at Jesus, he is the Lord, MY SHEPHERD. WHEN YOU LOOK AT JESUS, HE IS THE THE LORD, MY BANNER. IF I BE HIGH AND LIFTED UP, THEN I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO ME. WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS GOD PROGRESSIVELY. PROGRESSIVELY. AMEN. It was revelation AFTER REVELATION AFTER REVELATION. GOD LETTING YOU KNOW, I'M COMING. I'M GOING TO COME. I'M GOING TO REVEAL. AND WHEN JESUS CAME, he was the fullness. &gt;&gt; Yes. Good. &gt;&gt; Jesus was God. It was God crying in a manger. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; No, I that was Jehovah. &gt;&gt; You shall call his name Jesus being interpreted or Emmanuel being interpreted God with us &gt;&gt; that Christmas morning. Hallelujah. What does stockings have to do with this? &gt;&gt; What does Christmas trees have to do with this? What what does Santa Claus have to DO WITH IT? WHAT IS ALL OF THIS STUPID NONSENSE? AMEN. THAT THIS WORLD, ALL IT'S DONE, IT IS IT is a tool OF THE ENEMY TO TAKE OUR ATTENTION OFF THE REAL THING THAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; GOD BECOMING A HUMAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS OUR GIFT. GOD COMING DOWN TO GIVE YOU SALVATION. COMING DOWN TO LET YOU KNOW YOU WERE IN THE PRISON HOUSE OF SIN. SATAN HAD YOU BEAT DOWN BY ALCOHOL AND DRUGS AND PORNOGRAPHY. HE HAD YOU BEAT DOWN BY RELIGION. BUT JESUS CAME. IT WAS GOD IN THAT BODY TO REDEEM YOU AND tell you who you were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Why is there no power in religion? Good question. Because God ain't there. &gt;&gt; Oh, my preacher preaches A GOOD SERMON EVERY SUNDAY MORNING. IF HE DON'T have an understanding of what REDEMPTION IS ALL ABOUT, IF HE'S MAKING if he's making a church just a little 15minute sermonette, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THAT GOING TO DO FOR GOD'S PEOPLE? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. You come from God. &gt;&gt; You're a son of God. &gt;&gt; You're a daughter of God. But you were lost in sin. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that you were in his mind before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; The B. Praise the Lord. Now, I got to stay on my I got to stay on my scriptures here because I don't want to leave you hanging. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now, now I I want us to really understand that. Now, let's look here in 1 John 5 and 7. Hallelujah. So, it's the creator, the redeemer, and then the Holy Spirit in the redeemed. Let's look here at John 5 and 7 while while we're on this topic here. For there are three that bear record in heaven. the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are three. &gt;&gt; These three are &gt;&gt; one. Then the next verse, and there are three that bear witness in the earth, the spirit, the water, and the blood. And these three are one. No, these three agree in one. We have the father, the word, the holy spirit in the heavens. And these three are one. We have the we we have the spirit, the water, and the blood on the earth. And these three agree in one. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And what what what's he talking about? Well, God just in three offices. That's just one God. That's that's one God and three off. That was the fatherhood above us, the invisible God. Amen. Then it was then it WAS GOD IN THE body of Jesus Christ. Now it's the Holy Ghost in you and me. Not three gods. It is one God in three distinct offices. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Do you love him? Good. &gt;&gt; I am a father. &gt;&gt; I am a son. My My dad's right here. And he will attest that I'm his. Amen. And I'm a human being. Amen. So I'm a father. I'm a son. and I'm a human being &gt;&gt; now. If you're going to do it the way this nonsense goes in the church world today, we're looking for three different windowles. We're looking for the father. Have you seen Wendle the son? We wendle the human being. No, I'm all right here. Hello. I'm right here. I'm right here. I have three offices. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not your son. I'm not your son. Can't be your son. Amen. I I'm a father. You ain't mine. My dad ain't mine. Amen. But Caleb's mine. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I'M A HUMAN BEING. SO GOD, THE GREAT SPIRIT GOD, THE GREAT CREATOR, GOD. HALLELUJAH. DON'T OH, GOD'S PRETTY BIG, AIN'T IT? GOD'S IT'LL MAKE YOUR it'll it'll IT'LL WHEN YOU STOP TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE GOODNESS OF THE LORD AND WHAT THIS GREAT ETERNAL GOD HAS DONE TO BECOME ONE of us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Without reluctance, flesh and blood, his substance, &gt;&gt; he took the form of man. &gt;&gt; Revealed the hidden plan. Oh, glorious mystery. &gt;&gt; What can you say? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE BECOMING THE SACRIFICE OF CALVARY. NOW I know thou art the great I am. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I love him. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Bible says there in Colossians 2:9 again, for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily. Then in 1 Corinthians 6 and19 to the redeemed, amen to you who have experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost, he said, "What know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God? You are not your own." Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, the church of Pentecost knew that Satan wants to keep us away from that great understanding. &gt;&gt; But there in Isaiah 52 and6 and then turn there. That's that's okay. Amen. We'll we'll just take a little bit of time and quit whenever we need to. Amen. But but Isaiah 52 and 6. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Therefore, this is the prophecy. My people shall know my name. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, THEY SHALL KNOW IT in that day that I am he that does speak. &gt;&gt; Behold, it is I. Now, now this is God. This is God. This is the invisible God speaking through his prophet. This is the great I am. This is Jehovah. Put it back up there, sister Keys. Therefore, my people shall know my name. I'm the invisible God. But in that day, therefore they shall know in that day. Underline that in your Bible. That day &gt;&gt; that I am he that does speak. Behold it is I. Oh my. For the for the sake of time, let's go on down to the 14th verse. As many were astoned at thee, his vicious was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men. What wh what what what is God talking? He is he is saying in that day they're going to know that it is me. But when they look upon me, I'm going to be in a body. And my my body, my visage, my my my demeanor, my my looks are going to be worse than any mortal man. For I'm going to die and pay a price. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because when I come, they will not know who I am. &gt;&gt; They won't know who I am. Can you say amen? Now, I want you to understand that God needed a body in order to redeem. Let's just let's just look at some more scriptures here real quickly. Amen. Zechariah 12 and 10. Are we doing all right this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's just look at a FEW PROPHECIES. I WILL POUR THIS IS NOW LET'S I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU TIME to turn. Amen. Zechariah Zechariah uh 4 or 12 and 10. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. Zechariah 12 and 10. I will pour out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications, and they shall look upon me. Now, who's who's talking? SPIRIT GOD WHOM THEY HAVE PIERCED. THIS IS GOD TALKING. AND THEY SHALL MOURN FOR HIM AS ONE mourneth for his only son. Shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. This is we understand is when God comes back to reveal himself to Israel after the church is raptured up. Let's look here at Isaiah 45 and 22. Isaiah 45. And then we'll put these we'll put these together. Amen. 45 and 22. Praise the Lord. Look unto me. Somebody say unto me &gt;&gt; and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth. For I am God and there is none else. I have sworn by myself. THE WORD IS GONE OUT OF MY MOUTH in righteousness and SHALL NOT RETURN. THAT UNTO me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear. &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS HAD THIS DESIRE BUT GOD needed a body. Amen. to to express himself. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we just quoted there in 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy. Great is the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason why we look there in Colossians 2:9. Amen. For in him dwelleth, and you can put it up there as I even though I'm repeating myself. For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily. Can you SAY AMEN? NOW LET'S look here in John 12 and 44. &gt;&gt; Amen. Write these down because I want you to look at them in your scripture time. Never take a preacher's word for it. Always go back and study scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. First uh uh uh St. John 12 and 44. Amen. JESUS CRIED AND SAID, "HE THAT BELIEVETH ON ME, BELIEVETH NOT ON ME, BUT ON HIM THAT SENT ME." &gt;&gt; He that seeth me SEETH HIM THAT sent me. &gt;&gt; Okay. M &gt;&gt; Colossians 1 and 12 or 1 and 15. Amen. Let's now now Jesus is saying he that believes on me believes on him. &gt;&gt; For when you've seen me, you've seen him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let's let's look here in cloth. You say, "Boy, this is the weirdest Christmas message I've ever had." Well, &gt;&gt; you know, uh, Colossians 1:15. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is the image? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Of the invisible God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Christ is the image. &gt;&gt; Somebody say Jesus. Jesus &gt;&gt; is the image &gt;&gt; of the invisible God. &gt;&gt; Oh, that should make you want to shout. Let's let's go on up there to the 12th verse 1 and 12. Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son, in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins, who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. &gt;&gt; WELL, ARE YOU HEARING ME? SO, HERE THIS CHRIST IS. AND THIS IS WHERE THE MYSTERY IS. This where it blows the mind. People can't put it together. &gt;&gt; They'd come up and talk to Jesus. And he says, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The body was the flesh was the son, &gt;&gt; but the great eternal God lived inside him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Listen, when you get when you get to heaven, when you get to heaven, what are we going to see? &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; you're going to see one, &gt;&gt; JESUS. FOR GOD DWELLS BODILY in that body. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, this is something else that'll blow your mind. After the rapture is all taken care of, everything's all done. Did you know that the Son will deliver everything back up to the Father? &gt;&gt; It's what the Apostle Paul says. In other words, there will no longer be a reason for the blood. There will no longer be a reason. Redemption will have been complete. There is no are it's it's big. You can't rap. It takes divine revelation to UNDERSTAND IT WAS GOD in three offices. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. I I I my wife is I'm a husband to her. Amen. In another office, I am A I I'M A FATHER TO MY CHILDREN. AND AND ANOTHER OFFICE, I'M STANDING UP HERE THIS MORNING AS A PASTOR PREACHING TO YOU. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD. HALLELUJAH. GOD SO BIG, SO GREAT, SO VAST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if you were to go on down, let's just let's just keep on let's it's let's just keep on going. The 16th verse, for by him were all things created that are in earth that are in heaven, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers. All things were created by him and for him. He is before all things, and by him all things consist. He is the head of the church. Amen. who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence, for it pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness dwell. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I I think it's I I I want us to I want us to catch this. There was a time before the world before there was creation. It was just it was just God and you couldn't even call him God then. There was you couldn't even call him God. He was because God is an object of worship. &gt;&gt; It was the great eternal being. But then when God created the angels and then then then he become that he become a god an an object of worship. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. God had all of these thoughts in his mind. Amen. And and these thoughts were eternally in his mind. They were they were there eternally. There was no He never had a new thought. God will never have he'll never have a new thought. &gt;&gt; Nothing's new to God. God God knows the beginning from the ending. God is God. But when God wanted to express himself, when the thoughts were to come from the backside of his mind, &gt;&gt; Yes. And when he spoke out of this invisible form come the logos. This logos is the great pillar of fire. Now I understand that this is a theological terms but the great logos of God. So this there's this great pillar of fire and then all of God's thoughts all that God was was moved in moved in dumped into this logos. This logos would is called the word. That's the reason why in the Bible says there in in in John 1 and1 in the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. &gt;&gt; So this God when he spoke out of out of this invisible form come this pillar of fire. That pillar of fire would be seen all throughout the Old Testament. That pillar of fire has has has appeared has come back to earth even today in our generation. That pillar of fire, that logos, that held all of the DNA of God, that held all of the thoughts of God. Amen. And and and and when when when he would speak, Amen. the worlds were created by that word. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But that word that and that was wonderful. That was a visible form. He would appear to to some. Amen. Uh uh the the uh Moses seen him burning in there in the bush as the bush was on fire. Uh uh Abraham seen him when he appeared. You're wishing I would have had things wrote down. Hallelujah. A Abraham and it appeared to Abraham. Amen. In the great pillar of fire. He he appeared to to many throughout. &gt;&gt; But he was still in that great pillar of fire. But God God couldn't God couldn't know what a headache was like. God couldn't know what a the great pillar of fire. Even though he was ALL KNOWING, ALL WISE, ALL JUST, ALL IN HIM WAS REDEEMER, but again, he couldn't do it without it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, IT WAS IT WAS THAT IT WAS THAT GREAT. IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS GOD WANTING TO COME DOWN SO HE WOULD BE SEEN as the as the GREAT PILLAR OF FIRE ABOVE US. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He would lead the children of Israel. He would appear to the prophets. He would come. He would make himself known. Oh, hallelujah. Now, catch this. Now, catch this. But then he man all of that pillar of fire held all of the DNA of God. Now, when Jesus was born, all the fullness was in that body. &gt;&gt; You say, "Do you know that to be the truth, Brother Wendle?" Well, when Jesus was was after Jesus was resurrected and ascended, Amen. way after the day of Pentecost, 30 years down the road, the Bible says that great pillar of fire appeared unto Paul, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It was so bright that it knocked him off his horse. &gt;&gt; And he looked up.

She runs and tells her husband or her she was she was uh uh engaged. Amen. They weren't they weren't married yet, but they had they had been engaged a spoused. She tells she tells Joseph, we read the story at the beginning. Joseph wanted to believe her. Joseph wanted to I mean she has been a good girl. She's she's godly. She's she's known among but here she is with child and Joseph's thinking as we read Joseph's thinking she's wanting me to protect her of her evil deed. And the Bible says that Joseph so loved her he couldn't marry her if she was Amen if she had if if she had been with another man. It was against the custom. So he was just going to privately put her away and not cause a big scene because he loved her. But he couldn't marry her. I mean, could you imagine? Could you imagine here? You're fixing to get married and the girl that you're getting married to shows up. and she was honest in her heart and she's looking at him saying, "An angel appeared to me and told me this was going to happen." And then the Bible says that while he was asleep, he was a just man and he studied these things. He was going back and looking through scriptures. He had been looking going back in his mind. Amen. At the scripture that that that that no doubt that Jehovah had had told the girl and and here and and here Mary was. Amen. And here Joseph was and he's not understanding. And here it was a it was such a complexing deal. Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then God appeared to him in a dream and said, "Mary, oh, Joseph, that thing that is within Mary is a holy thing. This is this is the fulfillment of my promise." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She's going to give birth to the son of God. &gt;&gt; And it didn't say he didn't name him Emanuel. He said, "But he will be called Emanuel, and thou shalt name him Jesus." Can you can you imagine? Are are you hearing me? What is God's divine what is God's divine plan for the day? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God's got a divine plan for for him coming and that is to be born. That is to be revealed. &gt;&gt; There is going to be a people that's going to give birth to the word again. It's going to be a birth of perfection. We're fixing to go in to a new world, a new Are Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters, God gives us Listen, I I'm I'm not going to hold you uh uh uh too much longer. That great plan of redemption was when that invisible God come down and he walked with us, lived with us. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, are are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 45 and and 18. For thus sayaith the Lord that created the heavens, God himself that formed the earth and made it. He hath established it. He created it not in vain. He formed it to be inhabited. I am the Lord and there is none else. Ephesians 4 and 6. There's one God and father above all who is uh h of all who is above all through all and in you all. Well, praise the Lord. I mean, we could go on and on and on. Exodus 20 and1. And God spake these words saying, I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage, and thou shalt have no other gods before me. Exodus 34:14. For thou shalt worship no other god, for the Lord whose name is jealous is a jealous God. Can you say amen? I mean, we can go all the way down THROUGH THE SCRIPTURE. WELL, GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD'S GREAT GOD'S great redemption story. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Through us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let me Did you have something you just want to say? 1 and 20. Amen. Ephesians &gt;&gt; 1 and 22. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; 1 and Amen. There they're in Ephesians 1 and 20. for which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead, set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come. and hath put all things under him, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that fillth all and all. Well, somebody shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God coming. GOD CREATING THE BODY. GOD creating God. Amen. There he come through. the the world didn't understand him. But here they man they she he he was born under a a scandalous name that his mom was a was an adulteress that his mom it had been rumored that he he that that she had laid with a soldier a and that that that he was an illegitimate child. Amen. Jesus lived under that name. But yet God, can you imagine God coming un why would God why why why would God allow his son to just come under this scandalous name? Hallelujah. It didn't matter because he was coming to those people who were also Amen under scandalous names. Coming under people who were also Amen were that that were the outcast of the earth. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. But Jesus came and Jesus DIED AND GOD HE DIED AS GOD'S PERFECT LAMB. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, IF YOU DON'T YOU YOU JUST PLEASE PLEASE DROP ALL EVERYTHING ELSE ASIDE AND QUIT LOOKING AT A FATHER AND A SON AS IN TWO. &gt;&gt; I mean there IS THERE IS A FATHER AND THERE IS A SON. &gt;&gt; THERE IS GREAT JEHOVAH, GOD, and Jesus that was born and Jesus that came through a human life. But what we've got TO UNDERSTAND IS THE FATHER DWELT IN THE BODY OF JESUS. &gt;&gt; And you'll never find you'll never find him too again. God lived in him. Well, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, just thinking of what if as is as as Amen. God did you know here's what Jesus the Bible says that that Jesus offered himself as the lamb. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? Jes Jesus G praise the Lord. He was Jesus was so strange. Amen. He says, "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up again. Amen. &gt;&gt; They thought he was talking about Solomon's temple. They said, "Man, it took 40 years to build this thing." What are you talking about? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. He went down to the grave and the spirit that lived on the inside of him raised him back. Well, I just I'm just trying to tell you I'm just trying to tell you. Quit quit trying to mix this up as if there's two gods. God created that body to come and live within you and me. Amen. Now, as as as dad quoted that quote and as we and the musicians can get ready to come. Amen. That Christ that God so was was so pleased with the sacrifice of that sacrificial lamb. He was so pleased with that body. He was so pleased. Amen. That he raised him from the dead. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And has seated him. Amen. in the heavens so far above the heavens, above the angels, above sin, above a preacher, above the pope, he has raised him and given him a name above all names that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Raised him at his own right hand. Raised him. Go back and look in the Bible and see what God says about his right hand that's always representing of power. &gt;&gt; But how can you get on the right hand of a spirit? &gt;&gt; How can you get on the right hand of a spirit? Psalm says, "If I should rise up on the wings of the morning, thou art there. If I should make my bed in hell, thou art there. Where can I go to get away from your presence?" Praise the Lord. But what he did tell him, this one here, I'm so pleased with. I've given him a name. &gt;&gt; Given him my name. &gt;&gt; Well, I I I I hope this is all right here this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, the great redeemer. &gt;&gt; Yes. See, if you don't if you don't have that revelation, if you don't have that revelation, you're going to have God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, let me let me just say this. How can there be an eternal son? Eternal means you never had an ending and never had a beginning. &gt;&gt; Jesus had a beginning and Jesus had an ending, right? He was crucified. So eternal son is is is just nonsense. It's the eternal God living in that body. But then we got another we got another problem here too. And that is that is um um Jesus father &gt;&gt; as we read the opening scripture. Amen. And he that Jesus Jesus father was the Holy Ghost. Did we did did we not read that? &gt;&gt; He meant Jesus father was is the Holy Ghost. And he says that Amen. in in a couple of places here. Praise the Lord. Do you love him? Um, I have I have u I have the three. Praise the Lord. There was three places here and I Well, thou art the great I am. Oh, how I love him. How I adore him, &gt;&gt; my breath, my son, my all in all the great became &gt;&gt; my savior and all &gt;&gt; God's fullness dwelling. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Now I hit three different places where it was said but there in Matthew 1:18 it says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise as his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph before they come together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Mark comes back and says that she conceived of the Holy Ghost. We've got problems now because now Jesus has two daddies, the Father and the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You see how religion has made this thing so crazy? &gt;&gt; It's one God &gt;&gt; living himself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God above us. &gt;&gt; God with us. &gt;&gt; God in us. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "God above us." &gt;&gt; God with us. &gt;&gt; God in us. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we have to have the new birth. That's why that's why he says there in in 1 Peter 1:23, Sister Keith, that we have to be born again, right? &gt;&gt; And being born again not of corruptible or sexual seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. We're born again. Jesus told him, and said, "Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." Nicodemus says, "I'm an old man. How can I go back into my mother's womb?" Jesus said, "How is it that you're a wise teacher of the law, and you don't understand this? That is born of the flesh is fleshly. That that is born of the spirit. You've got to be born of blood and of spirit." Jesus was saying, "I am coming to give you life." This new birth that takes place is God's eternal gene seed that's already been laying in your heart from before the foundation of the world. God already predestinated you. You've already been put in his lamb lamb's book of life. But now it's God just as God touched the womb of Mary. Now, she she was just for your information since I'm just giving it out this morning. Mary gave birth to Jesus. But did you know that Mary had to go back to the upper room and have a new birth? Mary had to receive the Holy Ghost, too. Mary gave birth. Her physical womb gave birth, but then she had to be born again. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Good. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you can have a new birth? &gt;&gt; I always say, "Hey, man." I I always say, "Well, those that are struggling with this and struggling with that, well, it's going to be okay. Just just get born again. &gt;&gt; Get born again. Let God come and live on the inside of you." I know Christianity has it. Well, I've accepted Jesus into my heart. I come to an altar and I've accept Jesus into my heart. You don't accept Jesus into your heart. You don't accept him into your heart until that new birth. Now, you can you can you can accept his forgiveness. Father, forgive me. &gt;&gt; But but but but Jesus doesn't come into the heart until you've been born again &gt;&gt; till the new birth, &gt;&gt; you repent, you be baptized, and you shall RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. So receiving Jesus into my heart is not that that that that that it's it's it's it's not just you know this fictitious thing that God's going to come and now I've accepted him and wink wink now God is living in me. No, I'm talking about just as genuine as as Mary had that something ignited in her womb. &gt;&gt; So is it going to happen in the hearts of God's children? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Amen. &gt;&gt; You couldn't receive the Holy Ghost until the sin was paid for. &gt;&gt; Amen. All God's fullness. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I love. How I My breath, my son, &gt;&gt; my all in all, the great And now 1 Timothy 1:17. Now unto the king, eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor, glory forever and ever. John 1:18, no man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the father, he has declared him. So my my my my point is this. What is God doing today? First 1 first Timothy 2 and5 there's there is one God and one mediator between God and men the man &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ 2 Corinthians 5:19 to w that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself. Well that should make you want to shout &gt;&gt; now. Now that sin is over. Now that sin has been dealt with. Now the Holy Spirit can come down upon me. And he's living again today. Living in boys and girls, living in men and women. God is having preeminence over his people once again. Oh, how I love him. How I adore him. My breath, my son. He's living in me, my all in all. The great creator, the great creator became my savior. and all God's fullness. Well, in him down from his glory, &gt;&gt; oh God, ever living story, My God and Savior came and Jesus was &gt;&gt; born in a manger. &gt;&gt; To his own a stranger. &gt;&gt; To his own a stranger. Oh God. Oh God. A man. &gt;&gt; A man of sorrows, &gt;&gt; tears, and agony. Do you love him? Do you love him? Do you love him? Oh, how? Oh, Jesus, I love you. How my breath shine my own. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The great creator became and all God's fullness I feel like I've just been so scattered this morning. &gt;&gt; But if you can understand, see the Old Testament was the law and that the law of God that was God's that was revealing a lot of God's nature. He was holy. He was pure. But it was also revealing the fallen nature of me and you. &gt;&gt; And under the bulls of under under the blood of bulls and goats, there just wasn't really much hope for us. I mean, we were we were just scandals. Even Israel, the ones that God called, they were just they were just and &gt;&gt; Yes. And the law was there just it it doomed them. But then but then God gave them the lamb and the lamb rolled the head roll ahead the sins because the innocent lamb could not that the lamb never knew sin. But the n the lamb never knew what it was to be a man. Never knew what it was to have problems. But in between it all, God would always show grace. He would he would give grace to Abraham. He would call David by grace he would he would show elements of grace coming down through so that we could come to this day to understand to truly understand that the only one that can make the sacrifice for us brother Kevin is God himself to do it for us and that's what he done. So, there's not a God that is that is looking that that's just trying to find fault in you to to take you to hell. It's God that was doing everything he could to bring you back to himself. &gt;&gt; And I think it's so important. It's important for you kids to understand that in as you're growing up, this is this is this is truly God. This is crazy. God was a teenager. Do do you see what I'm saying? How how much he loves us? He loves us. And then he's coming this day as the great God Almighty to make sure that you know. So this morning, I don't know, you know, I don't know what what you guys have planned. If you know, uh uh you know, some people don't believe in giving gifts. Some people do. Some become full-blown pagans and others, you know, uh, you know, hey, but I just I I I I just want us to know I I want us to leave here. It would be so incredibly great if we could leave here with no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be Wouldn't it be wonderful on this morning that we have this is our this is our Christmas day, okay? And and wouldn't it wouldn't it be wonderful if if this morning we could leave here with no condemnation? Nothing in in you at all, Aaron, that says you're not good enough, that you'll never be. that it'd be so wonderful for you to leave this place this morning and know him Jesus Christ, God come to earth in a body to die for me. And that's what Christmas means to me. And that there's nothing that's ever going to pull me away from God. That if I fail, I've got plenty of blood. And it's not a lamb blood. And it's not a and it's not just human blood. It's the blood of God. &gt;&gt; And that's going to keep me right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; How about you to say, "No matter what my problems are, no matter where I'm at, Christmas done it for me. God who wrote all of his laws, God who had all those Old Testament God when no one else could pay the price for me, God come in a body for me." And he done it for you. No matter how what you're struggling with, no matter what you're going through, he done it for you. He loves you. If we could do that, if we could have that rich revelation in our heart that I'm going to make it because he done what it took for me to make it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to make it because he Praise the Lord. You love him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Without reluctance, &gt;&gt; flesh and blood, &gt;&gt; substance, &gt;&gt; the form of man. reveal the hidden. &gt;&gt; Oh, glorious mystery. &gt;&gt; Oh, glorious mystery. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Sacrifice of Calary. And now I know thou art the great. Oh, sing it with conviction here this morning. LET'S SING IT. OH, HOW I love him. How I &gt;&gt; adore him. My breath, my sunshine, my all in all. The great creator, the great LAWGIVER became my savior. Bless the name of Jesus and all God's fullness dwell in him. this morning. Why don't you prepare a place in your heart? Prepare a place of worship for him. He's no longer a a baby. He is the word that is being made flesh for you through you Lord be formed in me. Father we ask that your Holy Spirit would come upon us now as we dismiss and to go eat lunch together. I pray Lord that the simplicity of who you are would be made real to us and scriptures just cannot contradict one another. But when we see the full scope of what you are, that the whole plan is nothing but you becoming flesh in us. Oh God, we open up our hearts now and say, "Let your word impregnate our hearts. Let us live your life. Forgive us, Lord, of all of our strivings and all of our trying to make things happen. Let us let it just fall. Let it just rest in you. You're the one that has come to us. And we have simply said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." And Lord, just bless all of the children today. Bless all of the mamas and daddies.

Let your word be born in the manger of let it live. Let it start. Live inside this house &gt;&gt; and mold me every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Maybe that first verse. It was a tiny simple staple all beaten and worn. Hardly a place for a king to be born. He didn't choose some place special to reveal his majesty. So I know if I'll give him control, he'll be born in me. Let your word, &gt;&gt; Jesus of my heart, &gt;&gt; let it be. Let it start. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
