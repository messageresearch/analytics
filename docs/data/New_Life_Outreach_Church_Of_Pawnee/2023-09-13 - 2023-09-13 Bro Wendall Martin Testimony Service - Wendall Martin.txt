amen or as of yet anyways uh but we can we We Worship the Lord and and we thank him for his grace and I want us to um just let's go to the Lord in prayer and ask His blessings upon the service tonight father we want to thank you for your love and the blessings that you have given us that you have bestowed upon us father we're asking Lord did that your anointing would be here Lord and the Lord that you would be that you would be blessed by our praise and our Thanksgiving because Lord we were truly blessed by your presence the past weekend and I'm asking Lord that you would be here in a real special way and that you would be pleased Lord thank you for such wonderful meetings thank you for the healings and miracles and the encouragements that have occurred we love you Lord with all of our heart in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and a man praise the Lord let's look here at Saint John 16 and 22 real quickly before we have our seats amen we would like to have a man we'd like to hear you sing and and testify here today tonight and this is a passage of scripture that we that we all know praise the Lord but Saint John 16 and um let's start at the 16th verse a little while and ye shall seeming ye shall not see me and again a little while ye shall see me because they go to my father now let's go down to the 22nd verse and ye now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you and in that day you shall ask me nothing barely I say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name I will give it you hither two you have asked nothing have you asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full can you say amen amen God bless you you can be seated tonight and as I wanted to start it off here with a quote on Victory Day and and we're we we seen such wonderful things happen I felt like there was just a wonderful presence of the Lord during the whole meeting you know you we you have meetings where there's a lot of um rejoicing and and and dancing the aisles and we appreciate those days and and those times and we have plenty of that but you know at the end during the service and at the end of the service amen each one there was a a real a real just real specialness a real where you amen I uh from the very first night uh just weeping before the Lord and I felt like there was a lot of wonderful victories that were taking place brother Branham talked about the victory days he said you know he said we call the victory the v-day he said there's where I draw my text from that v-day Victory Day that was the day that they took the victory now where the armies took the victory over the other armies that's the v-day there there is a D-Day and then there was a Victory Day the D-Day is when they went into fight the v-day is when the peace was signed when Germany and the rest of them rallied uh or their Allied Nations and all surrendered to the other nations what did we do at the v-day we sang songs we screamed we throwed our hats in the air we shot the guns in the air we cried we blowed whistles we beat drums we played music we beat one another on the back what was it it was a victory oh we had the Victory and we felt why we felt we have won we have won the flags went up the trumpets sounded and what a time we had victory victory victory we won and it was a great thing it brought peace to the Christian nations that so-called and we had little time of of breathing we or we had a little time of breathing some of the boys that was living come back home and so forth and and them days have been many of them many great Wars but you know as long as there has been that kind of a battle fought there has also been God's believing people has had many great V days too oh yes there's been on both sides where the glass is focused on and went to the Natural side with v days but also where it focuses into the word in the scripture and it brings another v-day sometimes and we've had many of them great battles against our enemy and God has had great men out there standing at the front who've been able to capture by the spirit of God the thoughts of the people and throw it into the kingdom of God down there and come out Victorious we fight we fight it every day every Christian fights a great battle every day and we're in a Warfare right now constantly going on constantly within us between right and wrong shall we receive it what shall we do what shall we bound to the world shall we give up this that we got if we could just see it and focus it and take it from Genesis to Revelations she's thus saith the Lord each time write down through there you can't give it up we can't compromise with the rest of them we just can't do it we've got to stay here that's all no matter how great the enemy is and how much the Machinery he's got against us how many organizations how many this that or the other we have pulled this focus of God's word until we find that there's one thing and that's the blood of Jesus Christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever therefore it don't make any difference what anyone else says they say the days of Miracles has passed there's no such thing as Divine Healing there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism in Jesus name that was for the disciples only all these things they try to focus off of it but still focuses right back to the word and nobody can can say it's not there that's right God's hero has always had a Warfare and a v-day amen and so I believe that there is there's going to be many more there's going to be many more uh d-days there's going to be many more times we're going to have to go out and fight the enemy amen but I just think we need to rejoice when we do have our v-days need to rejoice when God does help us to overcome and the power of the Holy Spirit does come down upon us amen and see us through the way that he's wanting us to be and so amen so tonight we're going to have uh songs and and and testimonies and specials and and I'd like to hear specials and testimonies and we just amen enjoy the presence of the Lord the Ark of the Covenant always went before the people amen wherever they went they had that Ark and they went right there and it brought about a victory and I say we've got some Heroes sitting right here in this church amen you have fight your battles amen the enemy's always there and brother Branham says in it's a Warfare constantly sometimes we get a break amen but we uh uh we we like we like those breaks but we want to rejoice when we

testimonies tonight brother Joe he's like I'm not going to sing I'll testify God bless brother Joe myself out of it I really enjoyed the meetings and the Lord held me before the meeting so this meeting's uh the only complaint is they went by too fast it's like a Flash and it was over with but during the song series you could just feel the pulsating yeah the expectations is really good and I was blessed [Music] [Applause] sister Angie McDougall has a testimony and a song right amen no song Sorry you don't want to hear me sing um okay so a few months ago I was awakened like at 3am there was a very stealing calm in my room and there was no doubt present something spoke to me and said start speaking to your mountains so I did and then inside my head I went around the church and pictured all of the people in your seats you know started speaking things for each of you that I knew were in need and after I was done something spoke again and said there are miracles for many I placed that in my heart and I'm expecting so on Wednesday night whether Daryl spoke of giving it your all and the person who could only give 83 cents but it was still they're all well I ironically only had anyone since so I humbly put it in the basket the next day I couldn't stay in my filthy car any longer so I told the Lord I'd really like to wash it and I don't like to use the hose because it leaves water spots I wanted to go to the car wash but I didn't have the money to do it um he spoke to me and said go to the car wash anyway so I did when I got there the pressure washer was on that never happens he said take what you need so I washed my car like usual and on the last spot free rinse spray it shut off thank you [Applause] each night I specifically asked alert to speak directly to me and he did when brother Manuel preached she came right over here to my seat and he looked at me and he said you are the evidence and then again uh I got to stand as a Victor over cancer and he looked directly at me and said you are the evidence when brother Andrew preached he looked directly at me and said when you're down to nothing ain't that right sis that's when God works miracles so I fully believe God healed me of my ears my infection lots of things and there are many miracles coming for me I went through the prayer line and there were things I was praying for that were discerned and spoken um I'm working for the Red Sea to open wide and all of my enemies will be swallowed up so be prepared for me to flood the prayer page because no matter how great or small I will always tell her the goodness of God I appreciate brother Wendell for having the burden for these meetings and for all of the hard work that anyone put into them God bless Thee I love you all [Applause] right amen and Angie I like to say that the meetings it was so wonderful for me um at the beginning before it even started I told the Lord I said Lord anything you have for me give it to sister Angie because I knew she needed a miracle and she needed one bad but he didn't just give it to her he gave it to me too and I was so blessed why there it wasn't just one time but it was two times that the Lord blessed me so strong and when I was walking up to the prayer meeting or to the prayer line as Lord I asked for sister Angie but I'll take a little bit and he come on me and I couldn't hardly walk up to the prayer line I mean it the Lord reaches he was his presence was there so strong and there were some things that I've been reading in the Bible that that you know I had questions about that I didn't understand and the Lord revealed that too through the meeting through the brothers so I just thank him for all he's done [Applause] [Music] these meetings were phenomenal from the start to the finish and well it's still the Lord is still pouring out his blessings um every service everyone's been saying it's been um just Supernatural and that's really what I was praying for before the meetings just that the Lord would do something Supernatural for my family and for my husband and we just needed that from the Lord and um every service was the preaching was so powerful and the Lord just gave us so much Revelation and so much of that um that I I don't even know how to explain it just uh on Saturday we had to leave early to go unlock the building and start the food and and we got in the van and I was I told John I said my stomach feels heavy but like in a good way it's just like the it's so deep in there just the word that was being preached and it was like that each service and um and Thursday was extra special for me because at the end of the service brother Manuel was saying things that I've never spoken to anyone and I had been praying to the Lord about and it was so directly to me that I knew the Lord was right there saying I've got this and everything's gonna be okay and I know that and I hold on to that promise but when God just reminds you like he just speaks directly to you it's um it's super special and um I'm very glad to be a part of these meetings and part of this family here and I thank God so much for everything that he is doing wonderful praise the Lord Brother William [Music] Lord bless each every one of you this morning or this evening uh I I figured brother window was going to to open this up for a a testimony service and and uh I didn't know how I was going to say all this and I talked to a couple of the ministers over the weekend and asked him if they ever ministered and as a minister God was speaking to write directly to you on things in your own life that you were struggling and they said oh yeah so it kind of made me feel good because I was kind of shocked the Lord started blessing me on Sunday morning when I went and ministered for Brother by Ice I have been battling for a couple of years on depression and had some complexes that was driving me away from Pawnee I was very close of leaving you people that I loved dearly not one of you did anything to me I just got this complex on me and it was driving me insane I would fight and I was fighting it I'd come to church crying out to God asking him I know I was I was supposed to be here I knew that God sent me here Spirit very supernaturally uh if anybody knows me New Mexico is I'm New Mexico dirt and uh I never thought I'd ever sell my mom and dad's property and because it was my grandfather's and so I knew there was something on the inside of me I couldn't I didn't know what it was my family is the only one that was going through this struggle and a lot of the complexes was against brother Wendell and uh so Sunday morning when I ministered preach God is the savior from your fiery trials I read a few quotes about fiery trials and then what Hit me hard afterwards was when Sharon and I was coming home Sunday and she goes do you know God just answered some of your questions and I kind of looked at her and she went over some things that I said that I didn't remember that I said and one Proverbs 3 says trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not unto your own understanding in all these ways acknowledge Him and he shall Direct by paths I tried with all my heart for the last couple years to go that direction and it was tough I was fighting so the next day or that evening I was pretty Disturbed because I didn't think I had these complexes I actually went to our deacon and I went over to his house and I poured my gut out to him and uh I think you guys gotta we gotta find very fine Deacon back there in the back there stay neutral spoke to my heart gave me a little bit of things I can chew on and certain things that he said it was what I was preaching on that morning that's along the way home that night me and my wife and my two kids we we got home and me and Sharon stayed up and we talked and then the next day the Lord was just dealing with my heart on certain things and uh I got just looking through some of my notes when me and Sharon was talking and and one of the quotes that really hit me hard on Tuesday says god let's discipline disappointment happen to show victory many has been the trials of heartaches hardship but today we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus Saturday Tuesday night I just told God I said Lord I don't care what it takes kill me speak to my heart brother Wendell seen all of us say texts and told us we should listen to uh what is the Holy Ghost for and I listened to it like two weeks three weeks ago before then but I was just listening I wasn't paying attention and I started listening to that message and I started realizing that I am a son of God and I don't need these complexes while I was sitting there by myself working I totally died out to God I said Lord I don't want nothing to hinder me in these meetings I want to be able to look at my pastor I want to be able to look at each and everyone in this church and know for a shadow of a doubt I wouldn't have these complexes anymore and uh and so Wednesday night I was going to go talk to brother window first but we just never had the time to get to him and he had he was with his ministers and things like that and so when the brother was preaching I was fixing to walk out when he asked everybody to come and when I stood right there there was a voice that came out of that picture right there says you need to go tell him the complexes that you have and you'll have victory I walked over there and poor brother Wendell he was praying and he was probably asking whatever for himself and I put my hands upon him when he looked at me I startled him and I just told him that I was sorry and it's forgiveness that I had these complexes for the last two years and I felt like somebody was going to drive me away from this place it wasn't a human I realized it was the devil and when I realized that that night totally truly when I walked away from Brother window I don't know how I got from there to there because I was shaking so bad but since then all through the services God was just vindicating you vindicating and vindicating communicating and I can just feel like that old truck with a gas tank that was just getting filled here and filled and filled and filled until the back end was getting full the front end was getting full the front tires were getting full day I could tell each and every one of you that I'm sorry for even letting the devil give me that complex but today I can tell you that I love each and every one of you with all my heart God bless you amen are you enjoying these testimonies so

again amen I've enjoyed the testimonies so far the specials that were brought like to open the floor again is there anyone else that has a special or a testimony amen God bless you Sister Sharon Well everybody's known what I've went through over the last year with this um what they finally called loan covered and um when Robert and Brianna was living across the street just to walk from their house to our house I would be so out of breath and so right before we were supposed to go on our trip a month ago I had already been on another round of medication and she gave me some more stuff to take with me just in case I needed it while we were gone and when we had planned this trip in January we planned it to do a lot of hiking and so when I went to the doctor that was supposed to be a well check two weeks before we were supposed to go um I didn't even know I was sick again and she told me I had bronchitis again so then I told kind of just popped off and told her told William well I guess we may have to change what we're going to do well then right before we left I told him I said well I'm not going to take this last little bit of medication before we go because it's going to make me feel bad and I said we're just going to keep the plans as they are I said I know the Lord's going to heal me so while we was on that trip every day we did hiking I never felt short of breath one day we even hiked for seven miles I never felt short of breath and even though I knew that the Lord healed me just to see that manifested I was just like wow and so they had scheduled me out you know an appointment like two months one or two months out and it was going to be for when we actually got back that they wanted me to do a lung function test and in my heart I said it doesn't matter if it's clear or if it shows something I said if it's clear I said already know the Lord's healed me so that's just going to be proof I said but if it shows something there I said I still don't know the Lord healed me but it's also going to be proof for when I do go back and get another test that that test is going to show clear and that will show that the Lord's healed me so I went and had that lung function test and of course the doctor's report says that I have mild obstruction like lung disease or something and that my lungs do not fully release all of the air it's like it holds the air pocket in there but no matter what the doctor's report says I know the Lord healed me and before our trip something told me well you just need to wait till the meetings and the Lord will heal you I said no I don't need to wait till the meetings I know the Lord Can Heal Me Now and I believe he did that and through the meetings I just believe it which is confirmation of what the Lord's already done [Applause] amen that's wonderful amen anybody else sister Brianna um so I actually got two testimonies um well I guess three um when we were moving from our house across the street from my mom and dad the main reason we moved was because of the mold in the house was going to be very expensive to fix and we just didn't have that money on top of being able to buy it so we decided to go ahead and rent from Michael and Amy so there was going to be like a month Gap where we would stay with Mom and Dad between moving from one house to the other and it seemed like the moment we made that decision the devil was mad he did not like it um are your landlords at the time completely morphed into beings we didn't even know they could be they were threatening to sue us for damages that weren't even there they were calling my dad they were harassing Robert myself um they were even going as far as to go to the bank and ask questions that were confidential questions um and it got to the point where we decided we had to go to a lawyer and we turned out we couldn't even use that lawyer because he was a lawyer of theirs as well and so we were just kind of I was at first I was freaking out but then it was like a piece came over me I was just like I got this ear anchor holds I got it and I'm like this is not like me I like to freak out I am a warrior I overthink everything that's always my problem and we were receiving letters from the landlords that just kept piling up piling up piling up and I'm like what in the world did I do to upset the devil and out of nowhere I received a text from the landlord's apologizing saying they were wrong that they didn't know why they were even saying what they were saying that and we haven't heard from them since we've seen them in public they've smiled at us they have asked how we were doing they've asked about the church we have never had a problem again yeah and it just blew my mind how one minute they could it seemed like it was going completely South I'm like I am 22 years old I'm going to be facing a lawsuit what in the world to God completely just wiping it away as if it never happened and then um last Sunday before the meetings I had been dealing with nightmares I have always kind of dealt with them at certain times in my life when certain things bothered me as a kid um but the dreams that I had been having it was the same dream over and over again it just had different people in it and it was just really bothering me I had talked to Robert about it I talked to a few other people and I just I'm like I have I don't know what's going on you know I would try to pray before I went to bed and read my Bible and just really just you know make sure that I wasn't doing it like watching anything or accepting myself to anything that I shouldn't well um so Sunday I went uh whenever where the window was preaching and we all went up to [Music] um you know rededicate our lives the Lord before the meetings I heard this little it's like an antagonizing the most annoying voice I've ever heard in my head tell me throughout all the meetings I am going to torture you with you're never going to get sleep you're just going to be worn out after the meetings you're not going to enjoy it you're just gonna and I'm just like what no and I said Lord that's it I'm gonna enjoy these meetings I'm gonna get sleep I'm not gonna have these nightmares and I haven't had another one since and then um every night every service was a blessing and Friday I was not feeling good um at all so I came to church kind of just um like you know Lord I'm really gonna have to press through this service and it's like during the service the devil was just fighting me with sleep and I'm just like I'm not gonna I'm just gonna keep pressing through and so I just focusing extra hard and then about after about 30 minutes into the message it was like I felt like brother Daryl not by Daryl brother Jonathan was reading my mind some of the past situations that I've dealt with with a critical spirit with bitterness with complexes that I didn't even realize were bothering me as much as they had and it was almost a before he even called the musicians it was like something and he just wanted to run to the altar and when he called the musicians up and we all stood I didn't hesitate I went straight up there and I felt the Lord just touched me so strong and I felt like there was this like it was just like it just I didn't feel no one around me it was like it was just me alone with God in a room by ourselves and it was like wave after wave you know and then I finally felt like I'm like Lord thank you for this touch and I was just about to go I was came back to and I was fixing to go sit back down and I felt brother Jonathan grab a hold of me and he just started praying for me and it was like he was in my mind and we were just praying together and I just felt that dagger that was in my heart just causing me to have bitterness and strife and thoughts about people that I love and I care about gone and it's just the most wonderful peace and it's just I love everybody without having to look at that person and feel fake and it's just the most wonderful feeling I've ever felt in my life [Applause] amen that's good yes brother William yes sir amen amen I've enjoyed these These are good amen anyone what else we got time so brother brother Caleb Fairweather amen Lord bless him [Applause] so for a little while now I've been dealing with quite a lot just feeling completely dead nothing of the past Services before the meetings spoke to me I just felt like I didn't have any more emotions at all or just anything and the meetings were a blessing but Monday night I went to my grandma's house after work and they were listening to a brother Kenny Capps message and he was just telling these stories and I was listening but near the end he talked about how he accepted God into his heart he said he went to cornfield and just asked him Lord if you come into my heart that I will live for you and the message had ended and then I left for home but I was about two feet away from my truck and just I just kind of stood there for a minute looked around and I was saying God I don't feel like I've rightfully asked you in my heart I don't feel like I've been who you wanted me to be and I asked him Lord if you come into my heart I will sing you a song just more powerful than anything that I've ever sang in my life and I got in the truck and the song before brother Kenny Capps had dismissed with was Amazing Grace it was just going in my mind and I found a song of that and as soon as it just played I just sat there for at least 10 minutes I was just staring out the window I knew of God's presence had come down I was just saying oh God please be my friend just on the way home I kept saying oh God oh God just ever since then I've been so much different I know he's coming to my heart can we get the words to Amazing Grace please [Applause] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that same [Music] like me I want once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see since it was Grace that taught my heart

presence of the Lord here amen it's great tonight and greatly to be praised amen God bless you once again you may have receipts brother Mitch amen God bless you now okay never good at these things I have a couple try and be quick um wasn't sure I was going to be able to give a testimony until Caleb gave his uh he told me a few days ago a couple days ago and uh but really mine started uh whether John Torrance was preaching here a while back and uh I was at home at my kitchen table watching the service and going through my troubles and stuff and I've just had quite a few everything hit all at once and it's been pretty devastating and uh you're praying through then brother John's preaching and so we need to have that confidence in everybody else's prayers as well as our own and as well as to God and it really sunk into me and I really started believing for everything improving everybody's doing and you know we went to Seattle and when we got back um I called my brother the next day and they was taking my mom to the hospital I said what's going on nobody called me he said well she was having dizzy spell they they pretty much thought she had a stroke and so I had to put the post on the prayer request and it was right at that time they were just pulling in when I called them and and uh um so I don't know how many people got to pray or um look at it or or what but I believe that you know I told my brother I said I'm going to put that I'm putting this on the prayer page at our church so you know and they took her to the hospital and about an hour later I got the call back they couldn't find nothing there was nothing and it's not like them to just run to a hospital and you know get all excited about this if they there was something wrong and God had healed it and then the meetings tremendous in all my life I never liked riding the bench I I always I got to be doing something I want to you know whether it's playing sports or working or doing something and then when I gave my heart to Lauren uh turn my life over for him to do missionary work with I just this has been a really hard time you know I I haven't been myself I haven't been able to do certain things I thought well what can I do I you know tried to find something nothing was really working I called brother Wendell up and I said can I take you out to dinner before the meetings start take you to a real nice steak dinner just do something nice I could do that and so we went out to dinner and then he had mentioned it he was given his car to somebody to drive and that he was going to be driving his truck and I went really I've been a detailer my whole life under my dad's thumb I've washed all his trucks work trucks cars everything else and so I'm pretty good at it and then nowadays it got easier chemicals and stuff to use so I said look you need to put your keys in your truck and I'm going to take your truck tomorrow and and so they did I was very blessed for it and um it went went very well we were able to get the truck cleaned up presentable for sister Fresca so she could be comfortable during the meetings and you know it's it blessed me I I really wanted to do something and I'm glad it blessed them and uh you know there's so much God does for each one and me and Caleb been kind of going through it no not really hard but I mean I could tell he there was something bothering him too and he he wouldn't quite open up too much and then one night he did open up and and he said he just didn't know anymore and we had a really long talk and and I told him just just trust the Lord you know he'll bring you through it you know and just remember if God is God serve him and doing everything I could to encourage him you know and um see him come through the prayer line uh Saturday night I went through first am I seeing him back there and he's I knew he wanted to go through and uh when he went through it was just tremendous just each and everyone that prayed for him and laid hands on him went through there you could feel the anointing the healing coming off and uh you know and I I know All the Troubles I'm going through and I know God's going to heal me I had to go to the doctor the other day and and uh he wanted to know the story and I told him and I said well I was on disability for two years and I was to collect my back pay and then God healed my lower back from bone spurs and and that was a tremendous healing and I told the doctor this and said so what I'm doing now is just anything I need to do to to kind of calm those things so I can get back Rolling On My Feet Again but I said I'm really I'm just waiting for the Lord to heal my back again and he was like wow you know I said well the healing of my lower back was tremendous there's you know nothing shy of a major miracle and to see what he's done for my family and stuff just coming here I like to say brother William a Christian Life is living for others it was nothing short of you coming to Washington and helping me move to get our stuff here what I would have to go through if you hadn't listened and gave your life don't ever tell yourself Satan has the same tactics but you know what you're a Christian you live a Christian Life you live for others I see it throughout the church everybody's life and all sometimes sit and feel ashamed because I'm not doing enough and you know just love where we're at I love being here I love to have my family here to see my daughter and soon to be husband up singing a song during the meetings tremendous a couple days ago my son walked through the door of our house crying speechless without words what do you do as a dad you're like okay what's going on you okay did something happen and he told me God came in his heart I remember when my daughter came home from Stillwater camp what's good Stillwater camp told me she got the Holy Ghost God came in our heart revealed to him that he knew exactly who she was he's an owner his whole life her whole life so now I see my youngest boy words we don't have words here but same with you Brianna your testimony and you live a Christian life you live for others everybody in here that sets these things up does the food does the cleaning dusting whatever we're all we're all all in I can tell everybody in here is all in that's all I got to say that's that's a lot of testimonies for one weekend amen did you enjoy that amen like to say love our um our young people and have had a burden for them and seeing them getting touched or at least meetings really done my heart good amen also um getting to see my children touched as well how to compliment on on simeon's standing over here I don't even know if he knew what he was a Manning but they were people were saying he just looks like a little man standing up here just standing and praising the Lord so as a father it does my heart good too to see my kids even though they don't know really what's going on but to see that they're really soft and sensitive and to the Lord it really it's a blessing amen God bless sister Tabitha my testimony kind of goes along with what you're just saying and it's not even really my testimony so much although I saw and felt awesome things this this last week it was amazing like everybody says start to finish but um one thing that I guess impressed me the most out of all of it um my boss opened up her house as many of you all know Suzanne opened up her house to the young ladies to stay there during the meetings and she's pretty sociable she likes to talk to him and and get to know him and stuff it's just her personality and and I dropped off a couple of them the holderness girls I dropped him off after work on Thursday when they got in and got to introduce him to her and let him know that I knew him from Alaska you know prior to coming to Pawnee and stuff like that anyway um I just thought it was just such a blessing and I know she's done it before even before me coming here you know Amy's clean for her for years and years and years and and has no wonder and stuff and she's she's done it for years I know but um just talking to just talking to her um on let's see Sunday morning she sent me a text and um she said is there any way to get into the the rump Chief Building I have a girl here who left a dress at the Hall and is there any way for you to get in there and and get the dress and I said well yeah I said there's some sisters there now preparing the food for lunch um and what she didn't know was I wasn't ready yet a little delay at my house and she goes oh well I'll just go do it I'll go do it I'm like well you don't have to do that no no I want to I'll go do it and so she she ran the the girl over there whoever it was to get the dress and um I just felt to text her and I said I just want to tell you thank you on behalf of the church on behalf of the young ladies on behalf of all of us for opening up your house it's really a big sacrifice just it's a lot of girls they're coming in late they're giggly I mean they're you know teenage girls and so that's just a really big sacrifice and I just want you to know how much we really appreciate that God bless you and she said no she said it's it's awesome for me she said just seeing them from the beginning of the week and this is on Sunday she said just watching the change in all those girls from Wednesday to Sunday she said it's amazing and I thought wow that she could see the change just within the walls of her house of of what was happening to our youth I just thought that was amazing that it it showed what God was doing even out of these walls it showed there so I mean God's good I thank him for what he's doing I I tell everybody I feel like he's I feel like the favorite Child I feel like he's better to me than everybody else you know but I'm sure I'd get some arguments out of y'all but I'm so I feel sorry God bless y'all amen you enjoyed yourself tonight amen God bless you as we can stand here tonight I've really enjoyed all the testimonies and and the songs it's hard to believe it's already been two hours it's time flies and you're having fun amen can we sing this as we turn it to our pastor now when I come to your presence I humble myself I lift above my hands and I begin [Music] worship here when I come into your presence I humble myself I lift above my heads and I begin to worship here [Music] you are worship here for all he's done for me redeemed and set me free and because just because he is gone verse two when I come into His presence then I come [Music] how crazy [Music] his presence I humble myself remembering what he's done all the victories he's won so I'll praise him oh I praises [Music] oh he's done for me oh yeah every day that set be free because [Music] just because [Music] the Lord been good to us what wonderful savior we have and I sure enjoyed all of the all of the testimonies tonight just just tremendous Amen to see what God's doing in in each of our lives and how that we are Overcoming By the blood of the Lamb by the word of Our Testimony amen and um these Services were just so refreshing to me and and I tell you all of the ministers they just all every one of them were just said they were so blessed to be here and so many were thankful for the uh for all the labors to put it on and we were just so thankful and I appreciate Olive all of the hard work that that went into the uh to the meeting and what a blessing what a blessing amen it's just just tremendous and with them with the ministers being over there in in Still Water It Takes Me Away a lot from the from the daily activities it seemed like we were leaving here at 10 30 or 11 and not getting back until sometimes four o'clock and and um and so I didn't get to have uh you know just seemed like I I didn't get to do too much out over there at the fellowship hall but everything just kept running smoothly and and we just appreciate all of you all of you amen praise the Lord and you know life is full of life is full of uh heartaches and the devil is fighting and I just want to say you know um going to what brother William was saying you know those those are real battles those complexes and and Satan will try to build bitterness between any of us and all of us but and a lot of times you'll try to build that between especially a leader uh you know when the devil can because I can have a heart that is that is pure that that genuinely loves but and if the devil's beating on you you need we need to talk to one another and don't let that thing faster that goes for you that goes for you children to your parents that goes for wives to husbands that goes between others should be a communication we should feel free to communicate between one another because I promise you the devil is is is trying to cause friction between that's why we get divorces that's why we have church splits that's why we have all of these things here and so no one should be above even with me and brother William you know there's nothing for president there's nothing wrong with brother William coming talking to me and um and if I'm if if if if if I'm what I need to be I'll sit and listen amen and that's that's what we're here for we are all for one another we all love one another and so there is no big means and little U's or big U's and little me's we're all here together and so amen it's real it's real what the devil does and tries to put in between us is very real and and we can't allow that and so and if someone ever does come to you don't take that personal you know because in there and there and if there's something you need to repent of you need to repent of it if they come up and tell you you've done something to hurt then and and that's the way I want to be I want to be I want to be that kind of a person to to be willing to repent when I'm wrong and um and so um but I'm I'm thankful that we can we can talk and we can uh forgive and that we can't encourage and we can't do those things because I I tell you what we are in The Last Mile friends amen and Satan fights and brother will you make the only one that gets fought I get fought too and lots of times you can you can you can get it put under the blood and you can you can resist it and and put it under the blood and it's all it's all taken care of you don't have to go to that person amen but sometimes it's just good to just go and say all right I've been trying to get rid of this and I just can't do it so here we are amen I think you're a nut amen and whatever and uh and and get it and and get it over can you say man so I I I love you brother William with all of my heart and appreciate brother William amen man we are very blessed and appreciating all the years of
