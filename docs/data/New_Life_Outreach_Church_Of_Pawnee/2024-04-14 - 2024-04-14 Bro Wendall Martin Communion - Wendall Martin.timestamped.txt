[24:21] hand
[24:24] amen that's my prayer my desire I I
[24:29] remember thank you growing up I think it
[24:32] was Sister Thelma that showed us a video
[24:34] of a a
[24:37] Potter um making a pottery and I believe
[24:41] he was telling a story about it
[24:45] and as he begin to go the video shows
[24:48] him making this Potter how it starts out
[24:50] and think about 45 minutes into the
[24:53] video this Pottery was he was done
[24:56] wasn't in the fire or nothing yet it was
[24:58] just
[24:59] he got it done and it looked looked
[25:01] beautiful and all of a sudden this
[25:04] Potter that took him an hour to make in
[25:06] front of this audience he crushes it
[25:08] just smashes it down you hear the whole
[25:12] audience and he begin to show that the
[25:15] Lord would take our lives and put us
[25:19] through the wheel and take out all the
[25:21] edges and the roughness and sometimes
[25:24] even if it takes destroying us to get us
[25:27] where he needs to get us and at the end
[25:30] of the video he showed us a a pottery
[25:33] that was through the fire and it turned
[25:35] out to be this beautiful piece of
[25:37] pottery the most prettiest vase or vase
[25:40] however you say it was because it went
[25:43] through the fire and sometimes we don't
[25:45] like being put on The Potter's Wheel we
[25:47] don't like to to have the the Brokenness
[25:50] and the heartache but at the end of all
[25:52] of it he's making something beautiful
[25:55] and I believe on this being a communion
[25:57] night this could be a time where God
[26:00] takes off all the rough edges takes out
[26:02] all of the pride and things in our lives
[26:05] and at the end of it all makes us
[26:07] something beautiful amen I had you stand

[26:13] old song but I'm going to try it it's

[26:21] it's called it's my desire to live for

[36:22] be many that have a desire the foolish
[36:25] virgins have the desire
[36:29] but there's something
[36:31] about the bride of Christ
[36:34] it's it's life or death it's it's the
[36:37] holy ghost or nothing it's being right
[36:40] with
[36:41] God and wanting his life in in us and
[36:46] every every moment that we live and if
[36:49] his presence isn't with us we get
[36:52] scared I think that's the kind of
[36:55] relationship we have we're not
[36:58] one of those foul women of Le
[37:01] osia
[37:05] that tell her husband what what she
[37:08] thinks and where to get off
[37:11] and we respect him and love him with
[37:13] everything that we've got we love him
[37:17] it's our heart's desire to serve
[37:20] him we were created for
[37:23] it and so as we come here to leay Osa or
[37:27] come here to the service tonight and
[37:30] knowing that we have been brought out of
[37:32] Le osia and called into that
[37:35] relationship with the
[37:38] Lord I I I just think communion service

[41:11] father we come to you tonight we're
[41:14] asking that your Holy Spirit
[41:16] would just settle Among Us and as we do
[41:20] some self-inspection of our hearts we
[41:24] take
[41:25] hisp apply your blood
[41:28] we want Lord to come into this communion
[41:31] service Lord with our hearts pure before
[41:34] you and we're asking father that you
[41:38] would just take us all as we think of
[41:41] what you have done for us
[41:43] and oh God we don't want to ever take it
[41:46] for
[41:48] granted we ask Lord that you would be
[41:50] pleased in everything that is done and
[41:52] said in Jesus name we pray can the
[41:55] church say amen amen and amen God bless
[41:58] you you may be
[42:01] seated and what I thought we would do
[42:03] tonight I just got I I have got buus of
[42:08] of U uh
[42:12] love uh quotes that that I have um
[42:17] accumulated over the years and and I
[42:20] have sort of um been classified as the
[42:24] love preacher I preached a lot on love
[42:26] and and uh uh and so I don't want to
[42:31] take a very too very long a time tonight
[42:34] but I thought uh more than just
[42:36] preaching but just simply maybe read a
[42:40] few scriptures and and quotes and then
[42:42] comment on them because I think
[42:46] understanding as the Apostle Paul would
[42:48] say we are not ignorant the Satan's
[42:52] devices amen uh because we have a
[42:56] reality that we have found in the Lord
[42:59] Jesus
[43:00] Christ and by the way we um we want to
[43:03] keep uh brother Harry and and and sister
[43:06] Stephanie I guess sister Stephanie she's
[43:08] On's having the baby and uh uh they they
[43:12] they went in to get uh sister Stephanie
[43:14] checked out and so uh we want to be in
[43:16] prayer for for them we're sure excited
[43:18] for that baby amen but
[43:22] um you know a lots of lots of times when
[43:26] the Lord saves
[43:28] us um well not a lots of times we all
[43:31] came
[43:32] broken we all came we all
[43:37] came shattered pieces and
[43:42] and and the Lord would and and the Lord
[43:45] came and he he knows how to heal the
[43:48] broken pieces of our
[43:50] lives uh Isaiah 61 I love Isaiah 61 and
[43:53] Jesus quoted the spirit of the Lord God
[43:55] is upon me he hath anointed me to preach
[43:58] uh unto the Good Tidings unto the meek
[44:00] he sent me to bind up the the
[44:03] Brokenhearted he has uh to Proclaim
[44:06] Liberty unto the captives and the
[44:08] opening of the prison cells to them that
[44:12] are bound and and and we we are thankful
[44:16] for that there's there's a lots of times
[44:20] and not necessarily saying that's here
[44:22] but there's too many times that uh too
[44:26] many try to serve the
[44:29] Lord with
[44:31] scars and I believe the Lord Jesus can
[44:36] bring such a healing to where amen that
[44:40] that broken that broken uh spirit that
[44:44] that that the love the golden oil of
[44:46] divine love has fallen out of I believe
[44:48] that God can can fix the little hole and
[44:52] God can can make that so
[44:55] pure because we are New Creation
[44:58] creation we're not we're not the old
[45:01] things have passed away and the old and
[45:03] the and everything has become new we are
[45:05] not that old woman doing our own thing
[45:09] we have come unto Christ and he has made
[45:12] us
[45:14] new we we remember you you remember they
[45:17] ate Cal bride amen and how that uh and
[45:21] this was this is a true story over there

[49:35] woman now that that
[49:38] woman

[49:47] and said listen there has nobody in in
[49:51] in our community has ever been given
[49:53] there is nobody in this tribe that has

[49:58] know of wealthy men ever giving eight
[50:01] cows for a
[50:03] bride he says I'm given eight cows for
[50:06] that Bride for my my bride she started

[50:13] so well the uh the one who was writing
[50:16] the story uh that that knew the story he
[50:20] wanted to he wanted to check check this

[50:52] the same ones oh yes and here she comes
[50:56] now now and as she is coming as she is
[51:00] coming she's got those that are helping
[51:02] her and she's holding her head up so
[51:05] high and her and her her hair is
[51:08] beautiful this man that wrote the story
[51:10] says she was absolutely
[51:14] gorgeous this woman was beautiful she
[51:18] says hey this can't be the woman this is
[51:22] the woman that no one wanted he said oh
[51:25] it's the woman
[51:27] he says 'well what happened he said the
[51:29] story was this when the woman found
[51:33] out that her man was
[51:37] willing to
[51:39] pay eight cows something that has never
[51:42] been known in all of the tribes around
[51:45] willing to pay that money for her it
[51:49] gave her
[51:51] confidence and her man letting her know
[51:54] how much she was loved and how special
[51:58] she was has built her confidence up in
[52:02] such a way that she holds
[52:05] herself in the public like a
[52:09] princess I I I I think that's a
[52:12] wonderful
[52:13] thing you
[52:15] see we don't want to experience God on
[52:20] the basis of just fire Insurance missing
[52:24] hell this is a relation relationship
[52:26] it's a bride relationship between this
[52:28] is when God become a man so that he
[52:32] could come and redeem
[52:34] us he didn't just redeem us with a
[52:37] little bit of money he redeemed us with
[52:39] his entire life that's right he gave his
[52:42] life for us amen and so we we are we we
[52:48] are it sets us apart because of his love
[52:51] for us we're not going through life
[52:54] bitter we don't want to go through life
[52:57] with hurts and
[52:58] unforgiveness we don't want to go
[53:00] through life in in those kinds of deals
[53:03] we are a prince we're princes we're we
[53:08] are we're the bride you there's many
[53:10] types sons of God we are the bride of
[53:13] Christ we have been lifted up into a
[53:18] position of great power and
[53:21] authority and as we think about this we
[53:24] want to amen the remember the power of
[53:28] divine love and and you you look there
[53:31] at what the Isaiah 30 and 26 it says
[53:35] moreover the light of the moon shall be
[53:37] as the light of the sun now this is this
[53:40] is when God's coming in to heal and
[53:42] touch his people the light of the moon
[53:44] shall be as the light of the Sun the
[53:46] light of the sun shall be
[53:47] Sevenfold as of the light of seven days
[53:51] and in the day in the day that the Lord
[53:53] bindeth up the
[53:55] breach of his his people and health The
[53:58] Stroke of their womb he he come and he
[54:02] has so healed us he has so touched
[54:06] us he has so moved himself within us
[54:11] amen and living his life through us that
[54:15] that we are no longer
[54:17] downtrodden but now we hold our head
[54:20] high as the very Queen of Heaven Can you
[54:24] say Amen Isaiah 61 one would say I will
[54:27] greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul
[54:30] shall be joyful in my God for he hath
[54:35] clothed me that's Isaiah 61
[54:39] And1 uh and for he hath clothed me with
[54:43] the garments of Salvation he hath
[54:46] covered me with the Robes of
[54:48] righteousness as a bridegroom deth
[54:51] himself with ornaments and a bride
[54:53] adorne herself with jewels can you say
[54:57] amen Isaiah 45 and 24 surely shall one
[55:01] say in the Lord have I
[55:04] righteousness and strength so when we
[55:07] when we look at this amen it we we have
[55:11] a there the there there should never be
[55:15] a a a bitter heart no matter how bad
[55:20] we've had it in life no matter how bad
[55:24] our circumstances are right now now
[55:27] there should never be bitterness in our
[55:30] heart because of the one who has found
[55:34] us who has looked upon us and has
[55:37] esteemed us worthy and valuable unto
[55:42] him he is the one who has put the
[55:45] qualifications on us I didn't put my own
[55:49] qualification you didn't put your own
[55:52] qualification he qualified you me to be
[55:57] his very own that's right he's our
[56:00] beloved can you say Amen so walking
[56:03] around with bitterness walking around
[56:06] with a hurtful Spirit walking around
[56:08] broken is not becoming of a child of God
[56:12] because he has come to set us free he
[56:15] has come to menend the Brokenhearted he
[56:18] has come to to do that and when we come
[56:21] and we heal the way God wants us to heal
[56:24] then it's easy for us in our queenly
[56:28] position in our queenly H affections we
[56:32] step into that role as intercessor as
[56:35] Queen asra and we go before the king and
[56:39] we say listen my people are going to die
[56:44] there is an in we become we become the
[56:48] epitome of divine
[56:51] grace we become the reflection of the
[56:55] throne room because we ourselves have
[56:58] been called into that we ourselves
[57:01] Hallelujah the scripture says that
[57:03] Esther amen put on her royal of garments
[57:07] as she walked into the throne room to
[57:10] talk to the
[57:12] king why now she didn't quite see
[57:15] herself that way remember that Malachi
[57:17] or Mori had to tell her said listen
[57:19] you've got to go and she says I can't go
[57:21] in I'll die he
[57:23] says he says you're the queen yeah you
[57:27] were an orphan you were a Jewish girl
[57:31] you were a
[57:32] slave but you're no longer a slave
[57:34] you're now a
[57:36] queen now go in there she says I'll die
[57:41] no one's ever went in there
[57:43] Uninvited but when she put the go royal
[57:45] garments on she had to take off she had
[57:48] to take off her her her Bond's garments
[57:51] she had to take off her orphan garments
[57:54] she had to take off everything else and
[57:56] had to walk in before the king and the
[57:59] King says I'll give you up to half the
[58:02] kingdom why because the king loved her
[58:05] and she could do this praise the Lord
[58:09] now I think we is as we look here amen
[58:14] there that don't forget your position
[58:16] the prophet says the problem with us
[58:18] today is many times we forget our
[58:21] position and brother brandham would
[58:23] would would would talk about uh in 62
[58:26] putting on the whole armor of God and
[58:27] he's talking about your fellow man your
[58:29] your brother he says he says you don't
[58:31] know what's beating beneath that that
[58:32] little old skin there the Holy Spirit
[58:35] may be tabernacled there see you must
[58:38] never do that we must be brothers and
[58:40] treat a man no matter if he's in the
[58:42] wrong still treat him nice be nice to
[58:44] him if you haven't got that Spirit then
[58:46] there's something wrong Jesus was nice
[58:48] to those who were ugly to him see you
[58:51] must be Christians full of love ready to
[58:53] help any race color creed anywhere
[58:55] anytime
[58:56] we must be that way that's Christians
[58:59] that's the way Christ would have us to
[59:01] be a Christian is to be Christlike what
[59:05] can you say Amen spiritual adoption he
[59:08] said he said here's a point I want to
[59:10] drive home and may the Holy Spirit take
[59:12] it to every heart of you Believers just
[59:15] because you're a Believer certainly you
[59:17] have eternal life or everlasting life
[59:19] God said so but but would you want to
[59:22] just get in as job said by the skin of
[59:24] your teeth would you want to come before
[59:27] the father and and the talent that he's
[59:29] give every one of you and as being NE
[59:31] negligent you just didn't use it you you
[59:35] let something else stand in your way you
[59:36] let Petty things that meant nothing to
[59:38] you after all after all the fusses and
[59:41] stews and arguments and church
[59:43] differences and and difference take the
[59:45] meekness and gentleness from your life
[59:48] would you want to stand before the
[59:49] father like that I don't believe you
[59:52] would I don't believe that you would do
[59:54] it neither would I die can you say amen
[59:58] amen so so what he's saying is is
[1:00:01] remember who we are and what God has
[1:00:04] called us to be now Divine love is what
[1:00:07] separates us from everything else around
[1:00:10] us now where is Satan going to where is

[1:00:27] to seow Discord or try to sow you know
[1:00:30] whatever he wants to do and the thing is
[1:00:32] it's always the devil most the times
[1:00:35] when when you know a a fuss you by the
[1:00:39] time the fuss is all over with you
[1:00:40] forgot what you started arguing about at
[1:00:42] the beginning anyways it wasn't really
[1:00:44] important but it was a devil that was
[1:00:47] anointing the situation and and and
[1:00:49] trying to and just just coming in and
[1:00:52] rattling uh trying to Rattle us and the
[1:00:54] thing is is God's called us to be sons
[1:00:58] and daughters and to cast out Devils
[1:01:01] when they come around can you say amen
[1:01:04] he does that now are we are we guilty
[1:01:07] yeah many times we are guilty many of
[1:01:10] times but that's why we've got blood
[1:01:12] that's why we come right back and say
[1:01:14] God give us the grace I want love to
[1:01:19] reain in my life regardless I want I I
[1:01:24] want to the the the eight cows has

[1:01:30] special I am to you I and I want you to
[1:01:33] know how special you are to me I've
[1:01:37] called you or you've called me and now I
[1:01:41] it is my privilege to live for you and
[1:01:43] to represent you as a prince you're my
[1:01:48] husband and I am going to represent your
[1:01:52] values amen you hold your head up and
[1:01:55] I'm going to hold my head up I now
[1:01:57] belong to
[1:01:59] royalty well glory to God well that that
[1:02:02] deserves that that deserves the hand
[1:02:04] clap
[1:02:09] amen amen now now my wife my wife she's
[1:02:14] not one of those uh she deserves she
[1:02:17] deserves a 100 cows but uh uh you know
[1:02:22] she what I I I said I promised her the
[1:02:25] moon and gave her a house amen and so
[1:02:28] amen but but royalty when it comes to
[1:02:32] royalty this this the little ring that
[1:02:35] she's got and and and her dress that she
[1:02:37] has that's nothing compared to what the
[1:02:40] GL God's love for you and for me is it
[1:02:45] it it it's incredible can you say Amen
[1:02:48] but we it's so easy for us to get out of
[1:02:51] that now I this is
[1:02:52] communion and I'm not I'm I I am not
[1:02:55] going to hold you long
[1:02:57] whatsoever it's so easy for us to get
[1:03:00] dry if we're not in that relationship
[1:03:03] with the Lorden I think I think this
[1:03:06] this this relationship has got to keep
[1:03:08] plenty of blood amen has got to keep as
[1:03:11] got we got to remember what what the
[1:03:13] bread means and what the wine means and
[1:03:16] what that blood stood for that was the
[1:03:18] price that was paid for
[1:03:21] you and it's so important that you
[1:03:23] understand that you're not the only one
[1:03:25] Josh is is just as much a part of that
[1:03:28] body as brother John and and sister
[1:03:31] April is just as much a part of that
[1:03:33] body as as as as Kaye and and and we are
[1:03:37] we are all we we we are all a part of
[1:03:41] that and we have been baptized into that
[1:03:44] body and there is none of us that are
[1:03:46] going to see uh things eye to eye we're
[1:03:48] not we we we're just we're we we we just
[1:03:52] not amen we we ain't going to see things
[1:03:55] out to eye but that's okay we don't have
[1:03:58] to see things eye to eye it's not
[1:04:01] important that we see things eye to eye
[1:04:03] what is important is that that love that
[1:04:07] the father has shown towards us or our
[1:04:10] our lover has shown towards us that we
[1:04:13] have that same love one to
[1:04:17] another because we are all members of
[1:04:20] that one body and we love we love you
[1:04:25] you know I might think you're I might
[1:04:28] think you're just as goofy with your
[1:04:29] opinion as as can be and you can think
[1:04:32] the same thing towards me but the thing
[1:04:35] is the blood that was shed for me is the
[1:04:38] same blood that is shed for you and we
[1:04:41] walk together in harmony only with that
[1:04:46] word if there was not the harmony of the
[1:04:48] word where would we be today amen
[1:04:52] amen now brother brandham would say he
[1:04:56] would say now we find out along this
[1:04:57] road that after they had got this uh
[1:05:00] like this they came to Horeb he's
[1:05:01] talking about Israel ho re EB horb he
[1:05:06] says and let's break that name down
[1:05:08] that's where the name horb means a dry
[1:05:11] place or a
[1:05:12] desert when we get out of fellowship
[1:05:15] with one another in the church and out
[1:05:17] of fellowship with the Holy Spirit it
[1:05:18] brings us to a dry place a desert
[1:05:22] nothing alive everything's got stickers
[1:05:25] on it a desert a piece a little piece of
[1:05:28] cactus with with that that with that
[1:05:30] sticker on it do did you know that uh
[1:05:34] what that is that's a precious Tender
[1:05:36] Leaf little that's a little tend
[1:05:39] precious little Tender Leaf that hasn't
[1:05:42] had no water it's just wound itself up
[1:05:45] so tight till it's a sticker and when
[1:05:47] you see somebody like that maybe it's a
[1:05:50] precious so that that could be watered
[1:05:53] right would have would have been a
[1:05:54] tender little Lea or something but
[1:05:57] instead of that it's wound itself up
[1:05:59] till it's a sticker just a punching at
[1:06:02] everyone you know and finding fault and
[1:06:05] the only thing it needs is just water
[1:06:09] that's all it just needs a Revival or a
[1:06:13] breaking up a refreshing from the Lord
[1:06:17] it'll unfold its little self it'll if
[1:06:21] you'll just put it to the water but
[1:06:24] that's where the them who live in that
[1:06:27] place has to suffer with that condition
[1:06:29] of that place and those who desire to
[1:06:32] live in that kind of an atmosphere of
[1:06:34] where everything's just punching and
[1:06:36] fussing and quiring and stewing like
[1:06:38] that well you just live under that
[1:06:40] atmosphere that's all but we don't have
[1:06:42] to we don't have to live there it's not
[1:06:45] necessary for us to stay there amen
[1:06:49] why because we're an eight Cal
[1:06:52] bride better than the eight Cal Bride
[1:06:55] come on
[1:06:56] amen hallelujah now I'm not calling
[1:06:58] y'all cows I'm saying
[1:07:00] amen so so praise the Lord remember the
[1:07:04] blood and forgiveness amen so the we've
[1:07:08] got we we do
[1:07:10] these and because the Holy Spirit the
[1:07:14] Holy Spirit can only work through those
[1:07:17] vessels as I was preaching this morning
[1:07:19] that tender heart before God and that as
[1:07:25] as we read and there's there's there's
[1:07:26] several quotes in there where brother
[1:07:27] bradam says there'll be no love except
[1:07:31] for among the
[1:07:32] elect no love
[1:07:35] whatsoever so so why would we allow the
[1:07:39] enemy to come and to and us to feed on
[1:07:43] that when God's got an oasis when God's
[1:07:47] got the River of Life so that you can be
[1:07:50] a tree not a shrub not a cactus but a
[1:07:55] tree that brings forth your fruit in its
[1:07:58] season and your Leaf never
[1:08:01] Withers why why would we want to be a
[1:08:04] cactus and prickly and and argument of
[1:08:07] and and when when we can be a well of
[1:08:10] Living
[1:08:12] Water why would we want to be anything
[1:08:15] else but the Life of Christ flowing
[1:08:19] through us hallelujah can you say Amen
[1:08:23] you see you don't have to live there
[1:08:26] it's not necessary for us to live there
[1:08:29] amen we can live in the mansion in the
[1:08:34] palace with the king in his presence can
[1:08:38] you say
[1:08:39] Amen brother Brandon would say May I
[1:08:41] drop this in he said if you little this
[1:08:46] little thing to you Brethren as I know
[1:08:49] you're different
[1:08:50] denominations I think I've never talked
[1:08:52] like this to a group uh but in this
[1:08:55] little locality here and throughout the
[1:08:57] nation it's becoming now that if the
[1:08:59] devil can keep us separated and he's got
[1:09:01] us shooting at one another he's got a an
[1:09:04] open Target anywhere he wants to shoot
[1:09:07] what's the use of shooting we're
[1:09:09] shooting one another see see so he can
[1:09:12] just get back and relax now let me just
[1:09:16] give this to you if I have found Grace
[1:09:17] in your sight through God you take my
[1:09:20] word for this Brethren if you want to be
[1:09:22] a blessing and to get a blessing when a
[1:09:25] man has done you wrong and he's
[1:09:27] absolutely justly I mean he has done you
[1:09:30] wrong and you know he's done you wrong
[1:09:34] he's done you evil don't mention that
[1:09:38] you take him to prayer before God that's
[1:09:41] right you and don't take it in a way of
[1:09:43] just a selfish way and say I'm supposed
[1:09:45] to do this but stand with your shoulder
[1:09:47] to his shoulder stand in the presence of
[1:09:50] God our Father the way of prayer should
[1:09:53] be made in the presence of God and say
[1:09:55] father here's my brother he he's he is
[1:09:59] justly he deserves punishment because
[1:10:01] he's done me evil and I don't see why he
[1:10:04] done it and then go then let God go to
[1:10:08] talking to you and you'll see that maybe
[1:10:12] what that man's been through the devil
[1:10:16] has Twisted him up somewhere and caused
[1:10:18] him to do that though he's absolutely
[1:10:20] wrong before you leave the Throne of God
[1:10:23] you'll be feeling sorry for that that
[1:10:25] man you'll be sympathizing with that
[1:10:28] brother and when you get back down to
[1:10:30] Earth again you'll go over to that
[1:10:32] brother shake his hand cuz you know what
[1:10:34] he has been through you can't stand with
[1:10:37] a mortal in the presence of God and
[1:10:40] condemn anybody I don't believe no sir
[1:10:44] even if he is a rank Sinner and what
[1:10:48] about a brother that has made a mistake
[1:10:50] though I say he's wrong sometimes he's
[1:10:52] accused when he's not wrong but if he is
[1:10:54] wrong well if we will take him to the
[1:10:57] throne of God stand there shoulder to-
[1:10:59] shoulder with our brother knowing he's
[1:11:01] Immortal maybe his destination rest upon
[1:11:04] our attitudes towards him and when we
[1:11:07] come back from the Throne of God we will
[1:11:09] realize that we're everyone guilty and
[1:11:11] we all need help one from another that
[1:11:14] is the best way or the best way to do is
[1:11:18] to
[1:11:21] pray that
[1:11:23] that that
[1:11:26] Porter seen something different in that
[1:11:29] woman her hair was fixed she was wearing
[1:11:32] Royal
[1:11:34] garments those women that were around
[1:11:36] her honored her respected
[1:11:40] her she was very he says that she there
[1:11:44] out of her was coming such love for the
[1:11:46] people that she would stop and and would
[1:11:50] help the the needy here and this one and
[1:11:53] she was she had she had so much
[1:11:56] qualities that were weigh down inside of
[1:11:59] her that was that was bottled up by
[1:12:03] complexes totally bottled up by her
[1:12:06] complexes but when the king came the
[1:12:09] prince came and paid the price for her
[1:12:13] it un it it it it un it took it took the
[1:12:17] the uh the cap off of the heart it took
[1:12:21] the lid off to where she could express
[1:12:24] she always always had it there but
[1:12:27] because of his love now she can express
[1:12:31] her
[1:12:32] love oh Hallelujah is that not the Bride
[1:12:36] of Jesus
[1:12:38] Christ is that not the bride because she
[1:12:42] knows what it is to have those complexes
[1:12:44] she knows what it is to be to be under
[1:12:46] Satan's Ro she knows what it is to
[1:12:48] suffer and to hurt she knows what broken
[1:12:51] heart is all about she knows she knows
[1:12:54] she knows and she ain't going to look
[1:12:56] over to that other guy and say what is
[1:12:57] your
[1:12:59] problem she's got a
[1:13:02] heart that says oh let me help let me be
[1:13:07] of service let me encourage let me pray
[1:13:13] let me come on not putting the dagger in
[1:13:16] someone's uh back but but giving that
[1:13:19] love can you say
[1:13:22] man now
[1:13:26] we would as as um my time is up as we
[1:13:31] come into this into this presence
[1:13:36] here and we begin to look and I uh uh we
[1:13:39] will read
[1:13:41] there in in the the uh 1 Corinthians the
[1:13:45] 11th
[1:13:46] chapter and
[1:13:48] um and we will as we prepare you know
[1:13:52] what um uh I forgot that bread in there
[1:13:56] uh brother Josh and um we as we as as we
[1:14:00] look here and understanding that we
[1:14:05] are
[1:14:07] um we are humans we're as Mortals how we
[1:14:11] need the presence of God how we need the
[1:14:15] Holy Spirit within our lives how we need
[1:14:19] the presence his presence on us with us
[1:14:21] on a daily basis
[1:14:29] I I I can never
[1:14:33] express how that none of us can ever get
[1:14:35] by without the blood of
[1:14:38] Jesus just can't do it we just can't go
[1:14:44] without that
[1:14:47] atonement we just can't go without the
[1:14:50] presence of the of
[1:14:53] the king him himself and that blood that
[1:14:57] was
[1:14:59] shed I want us to look here at First
[1:15:02] Corinthians uh let's we'll break in here
[1:15:05] at 11 and
[1:15:09] um
[1:15:11] uh let's see
[1:15:15] um oh let's let's start the 17th verse
[1:15:19] 16th he start he stops with the with the
[1:15:22] um men and women's hair 17 18 verse says
[1:15:25] now in this that I declare unto you I
[1:15:29] praise you not that ye come together not
[1:15:31] for the better but for the
[1:15:34] worst for first of all when you come
[1:15:37] together in church I hear there be
[1:15:39] divisions among you and I partly believe
[1:15:41] it there must be also heresies among you
[1:15:45] that they which are approved may be made
[1:15:47] manifest among you when you come
[1:15:50] together therefore into one place this
[1:15:52] is not to eat the Lord's Supper uh
[1:15:56] um the uh into one place this is not to
[1:16:00] eat the Lord's Supper for in eating
[1:16:01] everyone taketh before his own uh supper
[1:16:05] and and one is hungry and another is
[1:16:06] drunken and what have you not houses to
[1:16:09] eat and drink or despise ye the Church
[1:16:12] of God and shame them that have not what
[1:16:15] what shall I say to you shall I Praise
[1:16:18] You In This I praise you not for I have
[1:16:22] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:16:24] delivered unto you to you that the Lord
[1:16:26] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:16:28] betrayed took
[1:16:30] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:16:32] break it and said take eat this is my
[1:16:36] body which is broken for you do this in
[1:16:40] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:16:43] also he took the cup when he had s
[1:16:46] saying the cup is the New Testament in
[1:16:49] my
[1:16:50] blood this do ye as often as ye drink it
[1:16:54] in remembrance of
[1:16:55] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:16:58] and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[1:17:00] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:17:03] shall eat this cup and drink this or eat
[1:17:05] this bread and drink this cup unworthily
[1:17:08] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:17:11] the Lord but let a man examine himself
[1:17:14] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:17:17] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:17:19] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:17:22] Damnation to himself not earning the
[1:17:25] Lord's body for this calls many are weak
[1:17:28] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[1:17:31] if we would judge ourselves we should
[1:17:33] not be judged but when we are judged we
[1:17:36] are chastened of the Lord that we should
[1:17:38] not be condemned with the world
[1:17:40] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:17:42] together to eat carry one for another If
[1:17:45] any man hunger let him eat at home that
[1:17:48] ye come not together unto condemnation
[1:17:51] and the rest will I set in order when I
[1:17:54] come
[1:17:58] now the
[1:18:02] um Corinthian Church you know he they
[1:18:05] they were brother Brenham says they were
[1:18:07] a carnal Church they it was a uh they
[1:18:13] you know they were they were preferring
[1:18:15] one another and they were they were
[1:18:16] going you know it was just it was just a
[1:18:19] lot of
[1:18:20] chaos and
[1:18:23] and you know
[1:18:25] and and speaking of of preferences you
[1:18:28] know I heard someone say here uh a month
[1:18:31] or so ago that um well you know our
[1:18:34] church is sort of like there's the
[1:18:36] Martin side and then and then here's
[1:18:39] here's uh another group and here's
[1:18:41] another group well uh you
[1:18:44] know I don't know who would be saying
[1:18:47] that or who would think that um I am
[1:18:51] proud of my family but I'm I'm here tell
[1:18:55] you we are not we we are not there is no
[1:18:58] Martin's Applegates or Martin's uh
[1:19:01] curses or Martin's Smiths there's no we
[1:19:04] we are all Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:19:07] we're all baptized into one body amen
[1:19:11] there is there is no there there is none
[1:19:13] of this this this stuff here and there
[1:19:15] is no feeling better this way and that
[1:19:17] way and I you know and I I I told the
[1:19:20] individual that was talking to me about
[1:19:22] it am man I said well that you know
[1:19:25] that's the first I've heard about it uh
[1:19:28] uh you know we're we're we're not uh you
[1:19:34] know we there is there's there's no uh
[1:19:39] we we don't want anyone ever feeling
[1:19:41] that way like that because what what
[1:19:43] dear Lord we've got we we've got we've
[1:19:46] got a World to Change we got a Rapture
[1:19:48] to make we got to and and we sure don't
[1:19:50] want this thing where well it's us
[1:19:52] against you or you against us we are and
[1:19:55] sons of God we all belong to that one
[1:19:57] self-same family that's Jesus
[1:20:01] Christ amen so so we don't ever want to
[1:20:04] have that kind of an attitude because
[1:20:06] that kind of an attitude will will it'll
[1:20:08] it'll never get us anywhere with God
[1:20:11] it'll it'll never get us anywhere with
[1:20:13] God so the deal is is we're thankful for
[1:20:17] the individualities we're thankful for
[1:20:19] we we're thankful for every family amen
[1:20:22] but I tell you what there is there's
[1:20:24] only one family we belong to and that is
[1:20:28] the family of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:31] that's the family it's not the brandom
[1:20:33] family it's not the Martin family and
[1:20:34] it's not it's it's it's it's it's not
[1:20:37] the Prett family it's it's not uh it
[1:20:40] it's no other family than the family of
[1:20:42] the Lord Jesus Christ that is who we
[1:20:46] belong
[1:20:48] to come on now amen and so so we we
[1:20:53] don't want uh
[1:20:55] uh those things to ever uh you know you
[1:20:58] you just you just you just blow that
[1:21:00] kind of a thing off because that that's
[1:21:03] just you know we we've got one goal and
[1:21:07] that is the common goal of a Rapture
[1:21:11] that is the status that we are pushing
[1:21:13] for is a Rapture that is what we're
[1:21:16] longing for is a Rapture the coming of
[1:21:20] the Lord Jesus Christ amen can I hear a
[1:21:23] great big amen
[1:21:26] that's who we are that's what we are
[1:21:29] that's what we stand for that's that's
[1:21:32] what I stand for amen that's what we
[1:21:34] believe amen so as we as we come to this
[1:21:39] communion and and we begin to look at at
[1:21:44] at at everything around us we want to
[1:21:46] say Lord we we ask Lord that you look
[1:21:51] inward look look in me I I I don't want
[1:21:54] want a a spirit that is anything but but
[1:21:59] the your spirit of Grace within me I
[1:22:03] want the Holy Spirit to so live and move
[1:22:06] and thrive in the presence of the my
[1:22:11] spirit to move and and live and thrive
[1:22:13] in the in the presence of that great
[1:22:15] almighty God I want that kind of a
[1:22:18] relationship with the
[1:22:20] Lord the only way that we can do that is
[1:22:22] to be honest with ourselves
[1:22:24] is to really look in our hearts and I
[1:22:27] think that's what these communion
[1:22:28] services are good for is for us to look
[1:22:31] within us and say Lord here I am if if
[1:22:36] if if if I've got an odd against a
[1:22:38] brother what go make it right just make
[1:22:42] it right I if if if if you feel and you
[1:22:46] you you know if someone's done something
[1:22:49] wrong to you and and you can't get over
[1:22:51] it now I'm not saying every time someone
[1:22:53] does something to you that you've got to
[1:22:54] go well you're going to give everyone a
[1:22:55] complex around you know uh brother
[1:22:58] brandham says don't say a thing about it
[1:23:00] brother bradam says just forgive them
[1:23:01] just go on and in prayer but if it's
[1:23:04] festering in your heart then go to that
[1:23:06] brother and and uh uh but I I guarantee
[1:23:10] you most of the time 90% of the time the
[1:23:12] brother meant nothing by it the sister
[1:23:13] meant nothing by it it's just the devil
[1:23:16] trying to get a get a wedge there but if
[1:23:18] there is a wedge that is there go get it
[1:23:21] out I I I you know I I've I i' I found
[1:23:25] it I've been battling this week in my
[1:23:26] own self amen and and and the devil will
[1:23:29] just put little things in my in in my
[1:23:31] little heart and and try to keep try to
[1:23:34] keep uh just just keep the spirit torn
[1:23:37] up what God don't want that Satan's the
[1:23:39] author of that that's right Satan's the
[1:23:41] one that does that what we've got to do
[1:23:44] is handle it according to what the
[1:23:46] scripture says and and and and if you've
[1:23:49] got an all against your brother then you
[1:23:51] need to make it right and if you've got
[1:23:53] something that your brother is done to
[1:23:54] you then you still need to go to them
[1:23:56] and say Hey you hurt my feelings I want
[1:23:58] you to know I'm I'm I'm forgiving you
[1:24:00] for it I I just got to get this up and
[1:24:02] over with you know but but don't carry
[1:24:06] this thing on because you can't allow
[1:24:10] the spirit of of of the enemy to torment
[1:24:13] you and to keep you from your your your
[1:24:16] power God's not called us to be church
[1:24:19] members he's called us to be
[1:24:21] powerful he's not called us for that and
[1:24:24] so if there are things there if there
[1:24:27] are sins in your life and you are you
[1:24:31] you you need
[1:24:32] to get rid of those
[1:24:35] sins get rid of them
[1:24:37] tonight get rid get rid of all of those
[1:24:40] sins that are that that are uh that that
[1:24:44] you that you know the Bible says is
[1:24:46] wrong then then don't don't prolong
[1:24:50] it cut those sins off
[1:24:54] amen and and I think if we would do that
[1:24:58] amen the spirit of the Lord would flow
[1:25:00] more freely in our prayer life in our
[1:25:03] dedication and our consecration well can
[1:25:05] you say Amen it's because we get we get
[1:25:08] away from the flow of life and then
[1:25:10] before you know it we've got we've got
[1:25:11] the river damned up and and it's usually
[1:25:14] because it's something that we're just
[1:25:16] petting something that we just that the
[1:25:18] spirit of the Lord's dealing with us on
[1:25:20] something that you know is wrong and you
[1:25:23] just ain't going to go get get it
[1:25:24] repented of and you're just going to
[1:25:25] keep on hiding I want to tell you that
[1:25:27] Devil's going to keep growing in your

[2:15:08] evening and um they're in John the 13th
[2:15:12] chapter
[2:15:17] [Music]
[2:15:24] the first verse
[2:15:30] says let's see um now before the Feast
[2:15:34] of the Passover when Jesus knew that his
[2:15:37] hour was come that he should depart out
[2:15:41] of this
[2:15:45] world having loved his
[2:15:48] own which were in the world he loved
[2:15:50] them
[2:15:51] them unto the
[2:15:56] end oh that's
[2:15:58] glorious all the way up to the very
[2:16:02] end he loved his home that were in the
[2:16:05] world he loved them until the very
[2:16:09] end the supper being
[2:16:13] ended and the devil now put into the
[2:16:16] heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to
[2:16:18] betray him
[2:16:21] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[2:16:23] all things into his hands and that he
[2:16:25] was come from
[2:16:27] God and went to
[2:16:30] God he riseth from supper laid aside his
[2:16:35] garments and took a
[2:16:37] towel and GED
[2:16:42] himself after that he poureth water into
[2:16:44] a basin and begin to wash the disciples
[2:16:47] feet and to wipe them with a towel
[2:16:50] wherewith he was
[2:16:52] girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and
[2:16:56] Peter said unto him
[2:16:58] Lord does thou wash my
[2:17:02] feet and Jesus answered and said what I
[2:17:05] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[2:17:08] know
[2:17:10] Hereafter and Peter said unto him Thou
[2:17:12] shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered
[2:17:17] if I wash thee not thou Hast no part
[2:17:19] with me
[2:17:22] Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my
[2:17:26] feet only but also my hands and my
[2:17:29] head and Jesus answered to
[2:17:32] him or sath to him he that has washed
[2:17:35] needeth not to wash his feet but is
[2:17:38] every but is clean every
[2:17:40] wit and ye are clean but not
[2:17:44] all for he knew who should betray him
[2:17:47] and therefore said he ye are not all
[2:17:52] clean so after he had washed their feet
[2:17:55] and had taken his garments and was set
[2:17:57] down again he said unto them know ye
[2:18:01] what I have done to
[2:18:03] [Music]
[2:18:06] you you've called me master and
[2:18:09] Lord and you say well for so I
[2:18:14] am if I then your Lord and Master have
[2:18:18] washed your feet ye also
[2:18:21] ought to wash one another's
[2:18:24] feet for I have given you an
[2:18:27] example that ye should do this even as I
[2:18:30] have done to
[2:18:31] you verily verily I say unto you the
[2:18:34] servant is not greater than his
[2:18:37] Lord neither he that has sent greater

[2:19:08] God Jesus was
[2:19:12] God he was God living in a
[2:19:18] body the great eternal
[2:19:21] God wrapping a towel around his
[2:19:30] waist and kneeling

[2:19:36] wash Fisherman's
[2:19:41] feet scoundrel's

[2:19:52] hadn't who were
[2:19:55] nobody's Peter couldn't even sign his
[2:19:57] own
[2:19:59] name but when he
[2:20:02] said he loved them that were in this
[2:20:04] world and he loved them all the way to
[2:20:05] the very end and the Very love of God
[2:20:10] you don't know what I'm doing Peter says
[2:20:11] listen you're never going to touch my

[2:20:31] something it was ooing out of
[2:20:34] him love was such an
[2:20:37] expression in
[2:20:41] [Music]
[2:20:43] him and as he knelt down to these
[2:20:47] Scallywags and he washed their feet
[2:20:55] now they weren't just any scalawag they
[2:20:57] were predestinated
[2:21:00] Scallywags they were ones that he loved
[2:21:02] before the foundation of the
[2:21:04] world were ones
[2:21:07] that his blood would be shed
[2:21:13] for and then he
[2:21:15] says if I your
[2:21:18] lord you call me master and you do right
[2:21:22] for so I
[2:21:24] am and if I be your
[2:21:27] lord and I have done this to
[2:21:31] you then you should do
[2:21:38] this wash one another's
[2:21:41] feet for I've given you an example and
[2:21:45] the servant is not any greater than his
[2:21:48] Lord many times there's too many Chiefs
[2:21:50] and none of
[2:21:55] Indians many of times there's too many
[2:21:57] spiritual ones
[2:21:59] and not enough
[2:22:04] [Music]
[2:22:11] [Music]
[2:22:14] servants I want a servant's heart
[2:22:18] [Music]
[2:22:23] one thing that I
[2:22:26] appreciated I always appreciate any of
[2:22:28] the testimonies that that I hear about
[2:22:31] brother
[2:22:34] brandham but all Roberts would
[2:22:38] say then I believe it was Jack
[2:22:42] Cole but these men were talking when
[2:22:46] they would get
[2:22:48] together and brother Bren would be with
[2:22:51] them as
[2:22:52] they're they're sort of letting each
[2:22:55] other know where they're going to be and
[2:22:57] this that and the other so that they're
[2:22:58] not having meetings in the same cities
[2:23:02] and but when they would meet and they
[2:23:07] [Music]
[2:23:10] would oral says we knew that all that
[2:23:14] that William brandham had the gift that
[2:23:15] was greater than us all
[2:23:18] oral he said that
[2:23:21] [Music]
[2:23:25] he said but when he
[2:23:28] left when William renham left he made us
[2:23:32] all feel like we were the big
[2:23:36] [Music]
[2:23:41] ones he was the guy with a
[2:23:44] gift and he made us
[2:23:46] [Music]
[2:23:47] feel that we were the big guys
[2:23:53] and I don't think that he was
[2:23:55] just doing it I believe brother Brenham
[2:23:59] truly loved those men and
[2:24:04] appreciated their
[2:24:11] gift today it seems like it all needs to
[2:24:13] be around me and I and us and
[2:24:20] [Music]
[2:24:24] God's looking for
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:28] servants and a master can be a servant
[2:24:31] and if the master can be a servant then
[2:24:33] how about the rest of
[2:24:35] us servants to one another loving one
