I heard Haven become a professional skier and but uh so we're so we're so glad to to see everyone here this evening and um uh you know the Lord is just always so faithful to his people let's let's go let's look here in the Book of Revelations the the the third chapter and the 14th verse and um we are uh tremendously uh blessed to be Christians amen praise the Lord and um uh you know we just we just know that God's got great great things for uh everyone that is that was in him before the foundation of the world and no weapon formed against you shall ever prosper and uh so we're thankful for that you know we're going to we're starting this this whole uh this this new church age and U so those that's going to be reading in the books um in the old books it is 3819 and those that are reading in the in in the red books um sister Denise you have the you have the number to that one um it's it's it's the beginning of the leodys and church age what is it 363 okay and that way uh because we have sent the red books out U uh to to people who are who are watching and and so U that way we're all on the same page here so let's let's read the entire church age here uh Revelations 3:14 unto the angel of the Church of the leot aans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me uh gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white Ramen that thou uh mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with iigh isav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and Jason be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him I will sck with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne and he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sath unto the churches let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your blessings and all of the goodness that you have you have shown to us Lord we're so thankful that you have given us ISAC to see Lord that you've given us clothes that we can wear now Lord we look to you tonight and we ask that you would be with Us in in all of our in in all that we do tonight as we read this uh the church age book just ask that The Interpreter would be with us Lord this is a such an important portion that we're going to be reading from and we're asking Lord that the teacher and the the Holy Spirit would come and guide us and speak to our hearts and open our eyes father you see those that that aren't feeling well and just ask that you would be with them tonight we give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here this evening so um sister Bella it's good to see you back here amen and uh yall going to have to excuse me here this is just a Sunday night or something might this this Podium here is rocking back and forth and I don't know what the deal is but I'm going to inspect it hallelujah amen let's see if that helps us see I would have been fighting with that all night long if I didn't do that and U so we are we are in the um the layo ofan age and if you if you notice um all of all of these other ages that we have read over the last um uh few well over this last year um these ages when they would start out the the Holy Spirit um Jesus Jesus Christ himself in every one of those ages he would point to the good he would point he would he would point out um the the um the incredible faith and their patience and he would point out a lot of good things um to to those Church ages each one of those but when if we if you notice that when we read here in in this leoan age there's not one good thing that he said there's nothing there he's saying that you're totally blind you are you you you are wretched and the and the only hope that that the the elect even has in in in this is is uh he that overcometh that there will be an elect with a germ seed of God even when the Christendom goes totally dark amen when it will become so religious and when religion will become so perfected that Christ will be on the outside of the church amen and and and and until the the false Vine has so uh taken root and taken over until there there will be a slight minority and that Minority will be the ones that'll truly overcome and the Rapture Jesus remember what Jesus said now amen Jesus says As it was in the days of Noah wherein eight Souls were saved so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so when Jesus returns um uh there there's going to be very few make it and so let us make sure as we start here tonight amen as we as we read there there at the at the End Amen we're all involved in this I mean we we this this thing this the these religious Spirits have have even got on have have even got on the elect amen until God is saying you're you're needing to counsel you're needing to buy some gold you're needing to put on some white reignment and and and the 19th verse as many as I love and you can put that back up there sister Keys 3:19 as many as I love I chase I rebuke and chasen be zous thee therefore and repent so brother Brandon would say the Zeal of the age is the ability to say I'm wrong amen and and the elect is the only ones that can truly say that I'm wrong help me Lord to be right help me Lord to never let my pride override your Holy Spirit in my life and so as we as as we look into this amen I think it's very important because the the the sin has become so deceptive until the angel of Satan has has transformed himself into an angel of Light and he's trans transformed himself in in such a way that that people uh uh uh uh feel that they are right they are convincing themselves that they're okay and the spirit of the Lord has departed from them amen as it's done in this church Age and and it shows that they are justifying themselves not with the righteousness which is the garments of of righteousness which is the you the righteousness of the Saints amen they they are justifying themselves with with other means instead of the Holy Spirit convicting them by the word now with this being such a deceitful age amen God was not just going to leave it to a preacher he was not just going to leave it to a to a um uh uh a pastor or evangelist uh uh or a um uh you know a missionary or a teacher amen or or even a a five-fold Ministry Prophet this age was going to be so crazy deceptive that God was going to send a prophet a word Prophet now this Prophet this this word Prophet that's different from the uh the the five-fold ministry Prophet amen there is there there as we say there is the five-fold ministry amen that has the the the pastor uh uh uh teacher Apostle the the uh evangelist and the prophet but there but the the uh word Prophet is one that is that is called uh from his birth and ordained he specially built to be a a prophet to that age to a generation Isaiah was raised up as a prophet to that generation there were going to be many other prophets come and go there would be Minor Prophets amen but they wouldn't be word prophets and these these these word prophets are are are are are able to get into God's mind and to to interpret God's word like nobody else amen they're built to withstand anything and everything and what whatever that the scripture says there concerning Samuel that that God never let any of his words fall to the ground Jeremiah 1 and5 it says I have raised thee up even as a child I've raised thee up Amen to pluck down Nations to build up Nations I these these word prophets amen are not just in in a in a local vicinity but they they are are are to to um uh they are to the world so so when God s when we talk about God sending a Propet in in our generation I I I want you to really understand and those that of you that are on that are watching us by line Amen brother bradam and and as we go through this here tonight as we get started in it this is not just another opinion amen now this this message in Le osia is just is not just a another book in on your shelf amen alongside everyone else's books this is not it amen God sends a prophet to an age and we must take heed to what that Prophet says or we will be deceived with everyone else when they're deceived amen now now this is very important so when God come in in this age and he's preparing for a Rapture then God is is Duty bound he is Duty bound to make sure his elect gets it straight I figured I would hear an amen and that elect is Duty bound to make sure they line everything up about them and their Christian walk and everything about them with this message now as we get started here um and we're going to be talking about the messenger and um it's going to go but it we might we might end up taking uh two or three services on the messenger because I I believe that we have we have so much scripture and and we're going to go through a lot of scripture here tonight tonight so how many's ready amen did you bring your books all right amen so let's let's look here now we have already read uh again in your blue books we're at 3:18 and um uh here it's it's chapter nine and we've already read all of that first uh the bi the scripture verses so let's go to the city of Leota the name leosia which means people's rights were very common um uh was very common and was given to several cities in honor of Royal ladies so named this city was one of the most peculiar or politically important and financially flourishing cities in Asia Minor enormous amounts of property were bequeathed to the city from Pro prominent citizens it was the seat of a great Medical School its people were distinguished in the Arts and Sciences it was often called the uh Metropolis as it was uh the county seat for uh 25 other cities the Pagan God worshiped there was Zeus in fact this city was once uh called diis city of Zeus in honor of their great God in the fourth Century an important Church Council was held there uh frequent earthquakes finally caused its complete abandonment how fitting were the characteristics of this last age to represent the age in which uh we now live for example they worshiped one God Zeus who was the chief and father of the Gods this forecast the 20th century one God father of us all religious pre uh premise that sets forth the Brotherhood of Man and is even now bringing together the Protestants Catholics Jews Hindus Etc with the intent that a mutual form of worship will increase our love and understanding and care of each other the Catholics and Protestants are even now striving for and actually gaining ground in this Union with vowed intent that all others will follow this very attitude was seen in the United Nations organization when the world leaders refuse to recognize any one individual cont cep of spiritual worship but recommended putting aside all those separate concepts with the hopes that all religions become leveled into one for uh for all desire the same goals all have the same purposes all are basically right notice the name Le oosa the people's rights or Justice of the people people's was there an age uh like the 20th century age that has seen all nations rising up and demand Landing equality socially and financially this is the age of the Communist where all men are supposedly equal though it is only so in theory this is the age of political parties who call themselves Christian democrats Christian socialist Christian Commonwealth Federation Etc according to our liberal theologians Jesus was a socialist and the early church under the guidance of the spirit practice socialism thus we ought to do so today when the Ancients called Le osia the Metro uh uh Metropolis it was looking forward to the One World Government that we are now uh setting up as we think of that City being the location of a great church Council we see foreshadow the economical e e ecumenical move uh taking place today wherein very soon we will see all the so-called Christians come together indeed the church and state religion and politics are coming together the tears are being bound the wheat will soon be ready for the Garner it was the city of earthquakes such earthquakes as finally destroyed it this age will end in God shaking the whole world that has gone off to make love with the old Harlot not only will the world's systems crumble but the very Earth will be shaken and then renovated for the millennial reign of Christ the city was rich endowed with with by by the wealthy it was full of culture science abounded how like today the churches are rich the worship is beautiful and formal but cold and dead culture and education have taken the place of the spirit-given word and faith has been superseded by science so that man is a victim of materialism in every attribute ancient Leota is found reborn in the 20th century leoan age in the mercy of God those who have an ear to hear come out of her that they be not partakers of her sins and the subsequent judgment the leoan age the leoan age began around the turn of the century perhaps 1906 how long will it last as a servant of God who has multitudes of visions of which none has ever failed let me predict I did not say prophesy but predict that this age will end around 1977 if you will pardon a personal note here I base this prediction on seven major continuous visions that came to me one Sunday morning in June 1933 the Lord Jesus spoke to me and said that the coming of the Lord was drawing nigh but that before he came seven major events would transpire I wrote them down that morning and gave forth the revelation of the Lord the first Vision was melini would invade Ethiopia and that Nation would fall at its steps that Vision surely did cause some repercussions and some were very angry when I said it and would not believe it but it happened that way he just walked in there with his modern arms and took over the natives didn't have a chance but the vision also said that melini would come to an horrible end with with his own people turning on him and that came to pass just exactly as it was said the next Vision foretold was of an Australian by the name of Adolf Hitler would rise up as a dictator over Germany and that he would draw the world into war and it showed the sigfred line how our troops would have a terrible time to overcome it and then showed Hitler would come to a mysterious end the third Vision was in the rims of the world politics for it showed me that there would be three great isms facism Nazism and communism but that the first two would be swallowed up into the third The Voice admonished watch Russia watch Russia keep your eye on the King of the North the fourth Vision showed the great advances in science that would come after to the world war it was headed up in the vision of a plastic bubble topped car that was running down the beautiful highways under remote control so that people people appeared seated in this car without a steering wheel and they were playing some sort of a game to amuse themselves the fifth Vision had to do with a moral problem of our age centering mostly around women God showed me that women would be out of their place with the granting of the vote that they uh cut off their hair uh then they cut off their hair which signified they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases more than equal rights she adopted man's clothing and went into the state of undress until the last picture I saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron with with this Vision I saw the terrible perversion and the moral plight of the whole world then in the sixth Vision there arose up in America a most beautiful but cruel woman she helped the people in her complete power I believed that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to a popular vote by the women the last and seventh Vision was where in I heard a most terrible explosion as I turned to look I saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over the land of America based on these seven Visions along with the rapid changes which have swept the world in the last 50 years I predict I do not prophesy that these Visions will will have all come to pass by 1977 and though many may feel this is irresponsible statement in view of the fact that Jesus said no man knoweth the day or the hour I still maintained this prediction after 30 years because Jesus did not say no man knows the year month or week in which he's coming uh was to be completed so I repeat I sincerely believe and maintain as a private student student of the word along with the divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and Usher in the Millennium now let me say this can anyone prove any of those Visions wrong were they not all fulfilled yes each one has been fulfilled or is in the process right now melini invaded Ethiopia successfully and then fell and lost it all Hitler started a war he could not finish and died mysteriously communism took over both the other two isms the plastic bubble car has been built and is awaiting only a better network of Roads women are all but naked and are even now wearing topless bathing suits just the other day I saw in a magazine the very dress that I saw in my vision if you can call it a dress it was a plastic transparent type cloth with with three darken spots that covered both the breast in in a small area and then a dark spot uh a place for a small apron below the Catholic church is on the rise we have had one Catholic President will no doubt have another other what is left nothing except Hebrews 12:26 whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also the heaven once more God will shake the Earth and with it shake everything loose that can be shaken then he will renovate it just last March 1964 that good uh day Friday that or that Good Friday earthquake of Alaska shook the whole world though it did not unbalance it but God was warning by a world Tremor what he will soon do on a greater scale he's going to blast and rock this sin cursed world my brother and my sister and there is only one place that can stand that shock that is in the fold of the Lord Jesus I would beseech you while God's Mercy is still available to you that you give your whole life unreservedly to Jesus Christ who is the faithful Shepherd uh who as the faithful Shepherd will save you and care for you and present you FL Flawless in glory with exceeding great joy now before we go to the messenger now this this little particular uh uh spot that we have just read that brother renham predicted that that 1977 would um uh would would be the end of the world that there would it would Usher in the Millennium of the Rapture of the church and of course we are in we're in uh 2025 and so uh there is there there there's so much all over the Internet that that says see he's a false prophet he predicted and his predictions were wrong and and and they say he prophesied and so he was you know he he was wrong but but did did you guys read exactly the way brother brandham said it he said I don't prophesy this is something that I'm predicting as a private student of the scripture compared with his visions that he had seen and he had seen all of these Visions already lined up and coming to pass there was only one or two left and so he was looking at it and is saying listen I don't see I don't see how it can go beyond 1977 he did not say the Lord told him that that was that was a prophet who had seen all of these others who had seen the interpretation of the scripture and was saying listen we are close to the coming of the Lord amen so so now you know you you you you you say well a prophet predicts that's what that's what a prophet prophecy is is prediction no brother brandom told us the difference right there this is not a prophecy this is a prediction as a private student of the scripture amen so so now now now that we've got that over with h I'm just so amazed at at these driverless cars that that are that have been perfected and and that are are driving who some somebody uh somebody in the church here took a picture of a car who was that uh took a took a picture uh of a of a car brother Bryce brother Bryce uh sent a video and and uh he's driving beside a driverless car and and it's just going along the highway there and there ain't a steering wheel in it at all and uh and so he got a he got a video of it he says you know I've seen you know he's seen the bubble and and and the the Little D with this here just looked like a normal car with nothing uh you know it was just a regular car and uh anyways uh listen we we we we have we should be so thankful that God would come and send us uh eyesight in this day so that we can see listen if we're blind we've got to be willfully blind because God truly did send a prophet messenger not to start another group not to get his own Doctrine but to take us back to scripture so that we can relate to Jesus Christ and this Rapture can you say amen amen all right let's go let's go on down uh we're going to start there at the messenger I doubt very much if any age truly knew the messenger that God had sent unto it except in the first age where Paul was the messenger and even in that age many did not recognize him for what he was now the age in which we are living is going to be a very short one events are going to transpire very quickly rapidly so the messenger to the lotsy and age has to be here now though perhaps we don't know him as yet uh but there will surely have to be a time that he becomes known now I can prove that because we have scripture that describes his ministry now I I want to to just really really really think about that no other age has been given more scripture concerning its messenger amen now all of my friends that are watching online amen I want you to think about it no other age no other people in church history from 190 uh uh uh uh from from from Pentecost all the way to now had more more had more scripture pointing to a man than in this generation amen hallelujah now we're fixing to get into a lot of scripture here and so um and I think it's going to be a wonderful wonderful lesson it says now I can prove that because we have scripture that describes his ministry first of all the messenger is going to be a prophet he will have the office of a prophet he will have the prophetic Ministry it will be based solidly on the word because when he prophesies or has a vision it will always be word oriented and it will always come to pass he will be Vindicated as a prophet because of this accuracy the proof that he is a prophet is found in Revelations 10 and 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now this person who in this verse is called an angel in the King James version was not a Heavenly being the sixth trumpling Angel who is a who is a Heavenly being is in Revelations 9 and13 and the seventh like in of like order is in Revelations 11 and 15 now I want you to I want you to catch it because if you if you go back if you turn in your Bibles real quickly um there there will be there will be those that says well you've you you're you're missing you're mixing scripture up but we're not mixing scripture up if you look there in in in uh Revelations 8 and 7 this these are the trumpeting angels and the first the first Angel sounded and and it and it goes on Amen then you go on down to the eth verse 88 and the second Angel sounded and it and it talks about that trumpet down to the 10th verse and the third Angel sounded and it talks about that trumpet and then the 12th verse the fourth Angel sounded and it talks about that trumpet and then you go on down to the ninth chapter first verse and the fifth angel sounded and it goes and talks about that trumpet the 13th verse the sixth Angel sounded and it goes talking about that trumpet but then then there is a partical uh a parentheses if you will amen a partical uh uh uh passage it simply means it's a remark or a passage that departs from the theme so so right in the middle right as it's talking here of the trumpets and then it comes in and says and I saw a mighty Angel and so it's coming down and it and it begins to to talk about that so then you go to the 11 th chapter and the 15th verse and and then it goes back to the trumpeting Angel and the seventh angel sounded and then goes on delivers what the trumpet said so so we've got from from the sixth angel now there in 9 and 13 and then we go uh to 11 and 15 to the seventh angel that sounded the trumpet so so are yall understanding that so so it is it is important because God breaks in at this at this last time and there is a reason that these things are are there is because right at the time of the tribulation right at the time of the man of sin right about the time that these things are going to be going on there is a Rapture that has got to take place before these things can take can can take place so so God is God's stopping the whole thing and says but I seen a mighty Angel that's going to deliver you from all of this mess are y'all are y'all understanding and the mighty Angel hands down the book to to the seventh angel messenger which is an Earthly messenger and which is a prophet all right so we'll get into that a little bit more but I just wanted to show you in scripture the uh uh uh where where it starts and stops so you've got the six uh uh uh you know trumpet blowing Angel and then you've got the seventh trumpet blowing Angel amen these are angels Angelic beings amen but this messenger that's come in Revelations 107 is an Earthly Messenger to Proclaim to the bride and uh the word of God and get us ready amen did I confuse you or did I help you some of you are looking amen all right goad and tell me that's all right what what what have I confused you about okay all right well if uh uh if you want uh feel feel free to on these on these Wednesday night night because it'll it'll help other people too all right let's let's keep going all right so um okay so he says up there at the top of the 3:24 the six trumpeting Angel who is in a Heavenly being is in N9 Revelations 9:13 and the seventh of like order is in Revelations 11:15 this one here in Revelations 107 is the seventh angel messenger and and it is a man he is to bring a message from God and his message and Ministry is going to finish the mystery of God as declared to his servants the prophets God is going to treat this last Messenger as a prophet because he is a prophet that is what Paul was in the first age and the last age has one too Amos 36 to 7 the uh shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be an evil in the city and the Lord ha not done it surely the Lord will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets it was in the end time period that the seven thunders of Jesus came forth Revelations 103 and four and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I heard of voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not what was in those voices or or those Thunders no one knows but we need to know it will take a prophet to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural Revelations except by a prophet the word always came by a prophet and always will now that this is a law is is the law of God is evident because even a casual search of scripture the unchanging God with unchanging ways invariably sent his Propet in every age where the people had strayed from divine order with both the theologians and the people having departed from the word God always sent his servants to these people but apart from the theologians in order to correct false teaching and lead people back to God so we see a seventh age messenger coming and he is a prophet not only do we see this messenger coming here in Revelations 10:7 but we find that the word speaks of Elijah coming before Jesus returns in Matthew 17:10 his disciples asked him saying why then shall uh say the scribes that Elias must first come Jesus said Elias truly shall first come and restore all things before the coming of Our Lord Elijah must come back for a work of restoration in the church this is what Malachi 4 5 and six says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse there is absolutely no doubt that Elijah must return can I hear an amen before the coming of Jesus he has a specific work to accomplish that work is the part of Malachi 4 and6 that says he will turn the hearts of the children to their fathers the reason that we know this is his specific work to do uh is to do at the at that time let me start over the reason that we know that this is his specific work to do at that time is because he has already accomplished the part that says he turns the children or the hearts of the fathers to the children when the Elijah Ministry was here in John the Baptist Luke 1: 17 he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord in the ministry of John the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children we know that because Jesus said so but it does not say the hearts of the children were turned to the fathers this is yet to take place the hearts of the last day children will be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers John got the fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the children into the fold now this Prophet upon whom the spirit of Elijah Falls will prepare the children to welcome back Jesus so so are y'all understanding that now now we're fixing to uh go in a little bit more and he's going to show you how uh another scripture uh Jesus talking about his first coming and his second coming and yet it was all in the same it's all in the same verse so so John the Baptist he fulfilled the first coming he fulfilled the the Turning of the children to the fathers or or the the fathers to the children and now after we've come throughout of all of these ages and there's so many denominations and there's so much nonsense that's going on there's got to come a prophet that's going to take your heart and turn you back to the father's to the Bible and it's important because it's in this age again that we are totally blind it's it's it's the leysia is there is there is no good matter of fact when when brother random uh seen the vision of the candlesticks did you know that the the leoan age was totally dark totally black and the angel of the lord gave him permission to put a little bit of light in there and you know what that light represents we were blinded but we were elect and so God God God gave that little light amen so it's important for us to know God let us see the real Jesus Christ amen all right now we will um let's let's let's continue on uh Jesus Jesus called John the Baptist Elijah Matthew 17 and12 but I say unto you Elijah is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed the reason that he called John Elijah was because the same spirit that was upon Elijah had come back upon John even as that Spirit had come back upon Elisha after the reign of King Ahab now once again the spirit will come upon another man just before Jesus comes he will be a prophet he will be Vindicated as such by God since Jesus himself in the flesh won't be here to vindicate him as he did John it will be done by the holy spirit so that this prophet's ministry will be attended by great and wonderful manifestation as a prophet every revelation will be Vindicated for every revelation will come to pass wonderful acts of power will be performed at his commands in faith that will be brought forth then will be brought forth the message message that God has given him in the word to turn forth the message that God has given him in the word uh to to turn the people back to the truth of the true power and the true power of God some will listen but the majority will run true to form and reject him since this Prophet messenger of Revelations 10:7 will be the same as Malachi 45 and 6 he will naturally be like Elijah and John both were set apart both men were set apart from accepted religious schools of their day both were men of the Wilderness both acted only when they had thus sayeth the Lord straight from God by Revelation both lashed out against religious orders and leaders of their day but not only was that so they lashed out against all who were corrupt and would corrupt others notice that both prophesied much against immoral women and their and their ways Elijah cried out against Jezebel John rebuked herodias Philip's wife though he was not popular or will not be popular he will be Vindicated by God as Jesus authenticated John and the Holy Ghost authenticated Jesus we can well expect this man will be the first uh uh will be first of all authenticated by the spirit working in his life and acts of power that are undisputable and found nowhere else and Jes Jesus himself in returning will authenticate him even as his as he authenticated John John witnessed that Jesus was coming so will this man like John witness that Jesus is coming their very return of Christ will prove that this man indeed was the Forerunner of his second coming this is the final evidence uh this is the final evidence that this indeed is the prophet of Malachi 4 for the end of the Gentile period will be Jesus himself appearing then it will be too late for those who have rejected him in order to further clarify our presentation of this last day Prophet let us particularly note that uh that the prophet of Matthew 1112 was John the Baptist who was the one foretold in Malachi 3:1 behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom he seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom ye Delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts Matthew 111-12 and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his 12 disciples he departed then to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for for another Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised up the poor have the gospel preached to them blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John what went ye out into the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in sth rment behold they that wear sth clothing are in King's houses but what went ye out for to see a prophet yay I say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee verily I say unto you among them that are born of a woman there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he this has already taken place this has happened it is over but note now in Malachi 41-6 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves in the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in that day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Orab for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I send uh you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse see immediately after the coming of this Elijah the Earth will be cleansed by fire and the wicked burned to ashes of course this did not happen in the time of John Elijah for his day the spirit of God that prophesied the coming of the messenger in Malachi 3:1 which was John what was but reiterating his previous prophetic statement in re in Isaiah 40 and3 made at least three centuries previously the voice of him that crith in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God now John by the Holy Ghost voiced both Isaiah and Malachi in in Matthew 3:3 for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his path straight so we can so we we can well see that from these scriptures that the prophet in Malachi 3 who was John was not the prophet of Malachi 4 though indeed both John and this last day prophet um have upon them the same Spirit which was upon Elijah now I want us to just stop there for a minute and take a breae because we have just read a whole bunch are are y'all are y'all seeing the picture uh catching the picture of what uh of what the spirit of the Lord is putting forth in in in putting these comparisons together so there there have been there there's five elijas that have been prophesied to come amen There Was Elijah who had the spirit of Elijah he was a prophet and I want you to I want you to look just just for a minute as as brother brandom already uh very well placed it out there he was against Jezebel and and uh and and Jezebel was one of those painted faed uh ladies who ruled the who ruled the kingdom he he he prophesied against Ahab amen the the political system he was he was the one that rebuilt the altar of God it was in the evening time that he came by vision and he went to the Mount of God he didn't take new stones the scripture emphatically why the scripture is so empat I think I I I think we need to look at those scriptures when when God is emphatic about certain things he didn't tell him that he built an altar no he rebuilt the altar he took the old Stones put them back together Amen in the evening time and then it was a showdown between the Living God and all of the the the the ones that were claiming they were Israelites true Jews they were but they were not worshiping the true God they claimed they were but they weren't came to a showdown and then the pillar of fire came and and he stood there amen and he and and and of course we understand that he he gave them up till noon telling him worship and he says come on get your god get him to talk maybe he's on a vacation get him to answer and let your God answer by fire and vindicate what you believe if if if your God will answer by fire then I'll follow your God Amen and after he gave him all the way up till noon or or or gave him all the way up till uh all day they they were they were uh screaming and they got cutting themselves and and and and they they they had worked themselves into a frenzy which Hallelujah which is a lot like our Pentecostal world today Works themselves up into a frenzy with the drums and the and the music and and and getting everything all and and they call that a working of the Holy Ghost and but the prophet stood there with all of that dancing and all of that stuff and he would stand there and say that's not the god that's not the god of the Bible if yours is brother Brandon would would would tell him amen come and stand beside me come stand beside me amen show me in the scripture one thing that I that that that I preach whether it's the serpent seed or the Oneness of God or anything listen amen especially in the one that I'm that I'm telling you about right now uh the brother brother brandham was given a I'll get back to that in a minute but brother Brandon was was was the angel of the Lord came and appear to him one one night and told him and says now they got a trap set for you there in Chicago and uh man and brother Brandon says oh my well I don't want to go and he goes no go go on I'll be with you he told him to go stand by the window and as he's looking out the window a vision unfolded and said you're not going to get the you're not going to get the building that you that that that they're saying that you're going to be in tomorrow it it's it's going to be sold out from underneath you given to somebody else and you're going to you're going to give him the color of the room and everything and then he then he takes him to the room and he shows them where all everyone is sitting around the room shows them exactly where all of these preachers and all of these priests and everyone is going to be sitting amen and and brother brandham and and and it was gave as a sign to to brother brandham that that God was with him he said now they're going to challenge you on on on what you believe in your doctrines so brother brandham he goes and tells brother Carson and he tells him he says Hey won't you have someone else to preach and you know and just uh uh you know go going back and forth with some preachers there and and he says you you're not going to get you're not going to get that room they said brother brother random we we've already rented this a year ago that building is already reserved we we're going to be in that tomorrow brother brandom says you won't be in that room tomorrow and he says well what makes you think that he says because that room is has got this certain certain color he goes yeah yeah we were there yeah that's the color he says but you're not going to have that you're going to go in this room over here the the the the where we're going to be meeting is going to be this color of a room and he says and not and and and then then he began to tell him he said so and so is gonna said here and here and here and here and here and here and and begins to tell them and uh uh so when he when when they go that next day yes the the the the building was given away to somebody else it was double booked they were able to go and the one that introduced brother brandham to the to the meeting this that that that next day he says he says y'all can say what y'all want to say about brother brandom and what you think about his teachings and things but he said if that man didn't tell me that we weren't going to be in that other room just yesterday told me that we're not going to be at that other building and that we're going to be in this building and if that man did not tell me where every one of you were going to stay where you was going to be sitting he say I give the floor to William Brown now they had already set a trap they were going to come in and just work him over they already had it all put together but when brother Ram stood up there and he stood up there just just really very humbly and and he stands up and he says now there's questions here if there's anything I want any of you guys if you're questioning anything that I've that I preach bring your Bible up here why don't you show it to that was the quietest place you could ever imagine those preaches weren't going to make a move it was a mount carel Showdown it was the Living spirit of God with all of these other guys claiming that they're spiritual and that's the reason why I say make sure when you claim you're spiritual make sure you're spiritual make sure you do it make sure you've got clothes that the Holy Spirit has given you every one of us we got to make sure because only the bride is going to be make making herself ready for that coming can you say Amen now now watch Elijah put them to The Showdown over and over now so that was the Elijah and we can see in that apostate Church what had taken place number two Elisha was given double portion of the spirit of Elijah so that was that was Elijah with the spirit of God on him then the second one came up Elijah has been has been translated amen and now the second a man comes up with the spirit of Elijah and he done the works of God and then the third one how many can tell me who the third one was John the Baptist that's one we've just read about that was the third one that had the spirit of Elijah upon him and he come to forun the first coming of Christ then there's a fourth coming of Elijah that has been prophesied to come that is our Elijah that will come and turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers turn us back to the Bible That's the fourth coming of Elijah but then there is also a fifth coming of Elijah that has been prophesied to come and it's going to come uh it's going to be to the Jews to restore them back to the Christ and just as brother brandom in the church age book says and that man must that that fourth Elijah must be alive and upon the Earth right now I want to say the fifth Elijah is on the Earth right now I believe that with all of my heart amen the fifth Elijah is over there somewhere in among them that God is already raising up Amen to turn the hearts of that 144,000 back to God a it's a big it's it's it's it's it's big man so so we we we can see the prophecies so you the fourth Elijah which was the Gentile Elijah in the last day Malachi 4 is not the same Elijah that is to be over there in the Jews different men five different men but the same anointing with the same characteristics are yall are y'all understanding that now I also uh and I'm I'm fixing to open it up for for for any questions and and and now listen if there's anything that we have read um any I want yall to catch this so please ask questions if if uh if if you're confused about any of this I want you to understand in the scripture why we take put such preeminence on the word for this last day we don't worship William brandham we don't I don't baptize in his name he was a sinner saved by grace just like I'm a sinner saved by grace there is nothing about that man that can save me but God raised up a natural Elijah that the the first Elijah that the world hated they tried to kill him but he was God's man Elisha the same John the Baptist was killed and destroyed uh h w w was killed beheaded because he was he was preaching against that it's that it's illegal it's not right according to scripture for Philip to be married uh to his brother's wife our Elijah come and the world hated his message and the fifth Elijah the Bible says that they're going to kill him and they're going to leave him in the streets that's the way the world thinks about the spirit of Christ and every one of these guys thinking they're Christians every one of them that's how evil things of God can you say Amen so I want us to make sure we know now brother uh Harry if you wouldn't mind I've got I don't know I uh do we have enough I don't I didn't Nathaniel do do we have enough to give huh there's 40 so anyone that knows how to read let's just um now I don't uh huh okay okay so so anyone that knows how to read I want you to take it and I want you to study it in your devotional time all right these books are uh are just little booklets and the reason I wanted to get it get it in the kids you kids' hands is because it's only got a few pages amen and um but it talks about the five comings of Elijah and so uh and and brother what what it is is is brother Tim PR um put this together and he took he took the some of the he took it out of what we just read here in the church age book and he put it he he put it in there where where a person that doesn't know much about the message can can just really see it easily so we want we we want every one of you all to to read that and hey I I enjoy reading it myself so uh so I'm a big kid amen sister Carol that was Elisha remember when Elisha was fixing was was um fixing to be caught up yes yeah he says if you keep he says uh what what what you know what can I give you he said I want a double portion of thy spirit and so um when the mantle fell upon him then he was um uh that that was the Elijah and actually he fulfilled the promises that Elijah was supposed that that was commanded Elijah to fulfill and he did actually uh I think there was eight things and Elijah done four and um uh but he but uh the spirit of the Lord was upon Elisha to fulfill that word after he was gone so yeah so y'all understanding the the the the five comings anyone has anything they want to they want to add tonight too uh go go right go right ahead I would like I want to matter of fact we're probably going to hit this for the next two or three times we're just going to get little angles of that Prophet messenger because I I I don't want y'all to just read this tonight and then be gone with it I want this burnt into our Spirits this is scripture and I want you to know that you know there's going to be opinions that rise and opinions are like belly buttons every everyone's got one and you cannot you cannot place your salvation upon that but when God sends a messenger to this age and vindicates that messenger then then I think it it it it behooves every one of us to take heed to what the spirit is saying to the church man we've got to do that I've got to line my there is no special privileges I is Pastor I must line everything with my attitudes with my belief system with everything I am I've got to line it up with that thus sayeth the Lord amen I I don't care who you are we must line our thoughts up with his word and I I I'm just I I I'm not questioning anymore I've done a lot of studying over these the these last 30s something years and I want to say Amen I've I've I've went forward and backward and i' I've I've studied and I Hey listen I was a Pentecostal boy I was one of those sign Seekers I was one of those with miracles in my life I was one amen that I hey I was a talented uh I was a talented preacher kid and and uh but but that that wasn't God's desire for me amen a talented preacher kid was not what God wanted God wanted me to have that Revelation in my heart concerning him can you say amen amen and that's the way we all want to we want to make sure amen that our faith is built upon that all right any any questions any other questions here brother brother murl yeah hey can can y'all turn turn turn the house speakers up so so or the internet speakers so that uh others can hear these yeah yeah that yeah and thousand though all the propes were perfect and th Lord was 100% correct yeah I heard that many thousands burnt their books turned their backs on the message at the end of 1977 believing that was going to be the end yeah and that the Rapture would take place by the end of 1977 yeah but God never corrected him no there's many times God did correct the prophet oh I I would have said that wrong I said that wrong the holy spirit is correcting me on that we've heard it on tape yeah you know sure but God let that go and I believe he let it go for a reason that's right it's to shake it's to shake off the the uh the make believer amen unbelievable it's God let lets these things be done for a reason is what I'm what I'm saying yeah and he he didn't correct it because he didn't feel the need to correct it uh that that prediction and uh well as you were saying at the begin at at the beginning of your statement that Jesus Jus himself said unless you drink my blood and eat my flesh you will have no part in me he didn't explain it he didn't do any it and his multitude the scripture says who can hear this saying so when we when we look back and and there were many things that's went went off from that you know many many things were were said and and and fractions went different directions in jesus' day when brother brandham said I predict not prophesy but yet in 1977 there was there there was a uh a a lot of people well-meaning preachers but they weren't rightly dividing they they they had sort of shifted everything on brother brandham put everything making brother brandham as if as deifying him when brother brandham very tically said that this is not what God's told me I'm basing it on on the visions that I have seen and them coming to pass I'm basing it on all of this around me and he was given that 77 to make sure or or to let us know what he thought that we are really that close but then others put it and started uh putting it as no it's got to happen and there were people that that that uh didn't go to work they sewed their cars they I mean they they left everything and we're waiting and see that's the Bible says to work till he comes that's that's that's part of it bought all this stuff because they thought I'm not that's true I've heard of that where they went and got got in major major debt because they're not going to need it anymore anyways and uh uh and and and and they were and and so then the scoffers then many laughed and said well we can follow no more but brother brandom in the opening of The Seven Seals he said says don't make a big deal of this he says if I knew that the Lord was coming tomorrow if I knew the Lord was coming tomorrow I would be up tonight preparing my service for tomorrow morning I would if if if I knew he was coming on the work I would go to work I would do everything I'm supposed to do until he comes but yet we're preparing for his coming y'all see that now there's a lot of people that are out but but we but but you can't you you you can't be harsh on people that that tell you that well brother Brandon missed his prophecies because all they're getting their stuff from is the internet all they're getting their stuff from and they're Liars they are liars and the Bible says there even in in the Apostle Paul call them yellow bellies he he call them liars and and and because they were lying they were lying on on the ministry of that day and so they're doing the same thing today with greater deceit because of the internet this the reason why it's called the the dark web yeah so I I I that that is very true glad you brought that up there there were there there was uh many many many many that that that thought that it's it was over and um shows their hearts weren't right they weren't working and they were they were putting they were putting things you know going into major debt and and it just it just wasn't by divine revelation amen anyone else and and I cut you off there brother Merl if you okay there was also a lot of people that left when the prophet left the scene yeah that just crushed them maybe you know yeah it was it was gone at that point and you know it's he said it would be a short age and a lot of people you know when I came into the message I came in even later than brother murl and you know I was told that you would need to get married you would need to to do anything you know you wouldn't have need to have kids and and that kind of thing and and um because it you know all this stuff had happened and was pretty much over but um you know and the shortest age was in I was talking to brother wend the other day about it was the Ephesian age was 123 years long and so I I that something just didn't sit right after a long time of hearing that this was going to be the shortest age and because you wouldn't know the time and so in 1906 if you had 123 years to that it's n or 2029 would be the last would it would be over before then and so here we are 2025 you know all this stuff is happening my confusion is the fourth to the fifth uh Prophet the one dies in the street and get killed in the street is all all the stuff's happening in Israel right now and Middle East and you know just so much to it that that the prophet talked about that's coming to pass right now and and you know have you really thought about it that there's that this that this has been that's been going on there could be a Revival that's that that that's that's beginning to break out or has even already broke out there among that those 144,000 Israel's Israel's got a lot of perversions people fly into Israel from all over the world for their sin and uh me their homosexualality is is is uh is celebrated pretty heavy there's a lot of stuff over there so God so you you you don't know what God is doing to bring the elect to desperation over there too so that they will hear their profit you see what I'm saying that that's going to be so we don't we we don't understand a whole lot of things but the Revival God's promised that r bival to the to to the Jews and listen we we fight hey satan fights hard fighting the elect the way the the the way that he fights us it's because the the spirit of the Lord is is lifted is lifting from from from the Western world and it's going back to the Jews and um there is a cry in their hearts so I I I believe I I I believe that that fifth Elijah is going to have a very uh short work you know and there will be a a a a revealing of Christ to to the Jews but when that happens we got to be in the palace amen we we've got to be there so when things when things take place when we're when we're raptured out of here and and and the tribulation sets in man it's it's it's going to be an incredible it's going to be an incredible thing amen anyone a Kobe Maria no no you you help us all put me on the spot and I look I'm the one looks the the dummy I might have dismissed it but um back to the trumpets I I was saying like the seven trumpet was like the seven messers message so I must be wrong about that when you were talking about so I don't know well the and and no that that that is that is good the the trumpets are to the Jews the seals are to the bride so so you remember when brother brandham was going to go preach the the seven trumpets and he already had he already had the building rented he already had the um people had vacations and things but he just kept feeling it just wasn't right something was something was wrong and um so when he and and and then he just he he canceled it and then when he went in to ask the Lord why uh you know why was this happening and then the Lord revealed to him said no the trumpets were under that six seal see it was UN it was it it was it was the messenger to uh it's a tribulation it it was under the tribulation and the Jews uh seal there so now there is a lot of Correspondence when you if you listening to the to to the um the Feast of the trumpets uh you will hear Brother brandham talking about how how it correlates how that they had their seals basically they had their seals like we had our seals and he'll correlate he'll correlate that Sixth and the seventh together so that may be where you're where you're hearing that as well but it's it's the um but it's and this this brother brandham didn't say this um but just just catching the bits and pieces and and and please don't take this as Doctrine but when brother when when when you read when you see the different places in the New Testament or or in in the Book of Revelations about the seven angels because you're going to hear that on on different occasions um first AG second third fourth these these Heavenly beings I believe they're just seven heavenly beings period but they were but they were ministering to to to the bride those will be ministering to to the uh to to the Jews you see what I'm saying now you know brother brandham didn't say that but I I I I I just I sort of believe that that's you know that's the way it is they're ministering to the Earthly Messengers here on Earth did that did that make any sense amen now I and and anyone else have any comments that's that's even a better answer than mine uh make sure you make sure you do that but but the the trumpets belong to the Jews so brother Donald let me get this yeah well we just we we just want those those that are ask asking questions or those that are listening in well that's all right out there and yeah mercy of God I thank him for not only saving me but bringing me into the message amen it's a gradual thing you know Pentecost Etc and back came from Baptist Baptist yeah Pentecost the Baptist didn't satisfy me I was hungrier for more than neighbor were given me you know yeah so the hunger and there was a prophecy one time and I know all prophecy is not of God but my uh uh someone had told my dad when he was alive you know because it was because of my dad I came in yeah he died and woke me up and so uh they told him and said you went so far are they I got that wrong no they told me that my dad went so far he was like a Pentecostal Baptist he loved the spirit uhhuh and he he was a dedicated man 12 years he served the Lord so they said you uh the Lord took your dad so far but he's going to bring you further that's what I believe happened yeah I still believe in Prophecy it's still sure God can use somebody yeah not every prophecy yeah y but I'm glad that it's weaned us down to more where we don't take everything we hear you know what I'm saying yes back in Pentecost it like man if you didn't hear nothing from God man you're you're lost I got to find somebody got that's true you got a GI you know what I mean yeah you know brother durran knows anyway I just I just wanted to bring that that I'm glad because I graduated in 77 so I'm just thankful yeah you know it was a prediction yeah it wasn't a prophecy i' I wouldn't made it God bless you amen amen yes praise the Lord anyone else amen amen and you youngans well any anything we I'd like to I I you know I I read this whole thing tonight and there's a lot there's a lot to it and but I wanted to read get get get the full picture but we may go back

if the musicians would come I apologize for keeping the service so lengthy but I I enjoyed it tonight did y'all enjoy it and I also um I I I appreciate uh you know those like brother Merl sister Leah and um uh brother Mitch MD Donald you know the the ones that even way back there that was that was there in the 77 and and around that area and and that's the reason why I have always tried my best to make sure that yall know that we're not following a personality we're not following William brandham the man we're following his man message brother brandham can't save you there's just no way jesz and if you listen to brother brandham you'll have a very clearcut view of Calvary if you just take the words of what brother brandom saying don't worship him but I am telling you God didn't say in the days of the voice of many Messengers was going to one Prophet messenger one not many one and it's important it's important to listen to take heed because if you do listen with a real Earnest heart you'll see Calvary really beautifully I still believe in tongues and interpretation that I'm not I'm not looking at them like I used to in Pentecost I still believe in dreams as brother Donald was saying and I do I do believe the spirit of the Lord I I I I believe that that there was a Pentecostal I Just sh just share you a story that just happened to me while I was in that when when we took a break I I I felt the re release in my spirit and I I I I Presa was so good to just while we were away to just give me time and so I came to her one afternoon and I said would you you want to you want to go out go we can go walking down the landing over there and braning and she said sure So it was it was toward the evening time they were about to close over there as around 4:00 and we're walking you know you go going down through all those shops there in at at in Branson there on the landing and it was a pretty day and uh I had looked at some skirts and you know uh in fact she got her a skirt while and we broke our diet stopped and got us some fuds then some ice cream [Music] so we were we were coming going back and we there was this there was this Western jewelry shop and and I said you know go look in there see see what they have in bolos you know so we went in and they had some beautiful bolos and we're looking and this little woman comes up you know she's got cut hair she's an older lady and uh she's just really interested in us she's just and uh she said you know looking at the Bolos she said you know my my dad used to wear a bolo whereever Wednesday night to church I said you know I wear bolos to church and usually it's on Wednesday night and she goes I knew it I knew said oh really she says pastors really get weary don't they yes ma'am little you know we're talking he said but my dad my dad labored hard she La he labored I remember so she started telling me about her dad telling us and I I thought well that's really nice so I was ready to get away you know I was ready to get away and uh other people were around she she went to go help we were trying to sneak out the door and that b tie that I wore last Wednesday he had it in a box she met us at the door and stuck it in Fresa's hands she said the Lord told me to give this to your husband and that he is very mindful of him and I turned around and I looked at her and I the Bowa was expensive and I [Music] said I can't do that she said oh yes you can I was impressed of the Lord to do that for you we left I waited until everyone the store had emptied and I came back in and I said you know I I pray that God blesses you she said the blessing was upon me he said but the Lord dealt with my heart and told me to tell you that and to give that to you Pentecostal right Spirit of the Lord still works and moves he can use who he wants but that little something over there way out nowhere and here I'm I've been calling out to the God for two weeks [Music] just talking to him very raw very raw just pouring my gut pouring everything I've got out to and telling him and God was so good to me all I could do was just weep God was mindful of wend God's mindful of us all and I believe the spirit of the Lord is very mindful and so I do believe I do believe that people hear I do believe that God speaks well that lady was very accurate in in in in dealing with some of the things that was in my heart but in all of the goodness there's only one prophet [Music] and I've got to line myself myself up and that's what we all want to do see I was with you brother Donald I remember sitting right I I'd go to church I'd go to church day after day in the daytime I ride my bike over there I'd sat right outside the pastor's study and I'd ask God give me a word and it was incredible brother Bur would come service he' called me out tell me things that only God knew he had a [Music] gift but he wasn't the prophet you understand what I'm saying so we line everything up with a Vindicated voice to this generation has there been many other things that have been brought yeah I've had many of other things many other prophecies and they I've just had to put them on a shelf but it's never hurt my faith not since I understand since I've come to this understanding I don't put my faith in Prophecy I put my faith in this and this alone can you say amen God bless you thank you for your patience tonight
