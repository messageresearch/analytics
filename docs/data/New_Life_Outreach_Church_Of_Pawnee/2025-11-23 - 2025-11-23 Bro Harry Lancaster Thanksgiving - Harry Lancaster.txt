And Lord, we just thank you for allowing us to to gather here once more, Lord. Lord, you've given us a a wonderful day together, Lord. And [music] you've allowed us to come into your presence once more, Lord. And Lord, we just want to come with that spirit of thanksgiving, Lord, and thankfulness, Lord, just [music] to worship you and praise you for all that you've done for us, Lord. And Lord, I pray that you would be in our time together this evening, Lord, as Lord, I would speak a few words and we would [music] spend some time worshiping and and offering testimonies, Lord. Just Lord, be in everything that it's said and done, Lord. May it just be pleasing to you, Lord. Lord, I pray that you would give me the right words to speak, Lord. That you would just [music] take control, Lord. You, Lord, may you use this vessel, Lord, that Lord, maybe I'm not feeling the best this evening, Lord, but Lord, you can take control. You can be the one to to guide every word, Lord, to make sure that what needs to be said is said, Lord. And Lord, I pray that you would just bless your people this evening, Lord. Lord, we just commit the service into your hands. The name of Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's all take out our Bibles and we'll turn to Acts chapter 17. I was telling brother Wendell earlier that I don't know what I did if I just slept wrong or whatever but my back decided to act up today and I have already decided if necessary I will just sit down in that chair and keep on preaching and we'll go from there. Um and we will just see how how the Lord does it this evening. But Acts chapter 17, we'll start at verse 22. Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said, "Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious. For as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, to the unknown God, whom therefore you ignorantly worship. Him declare I unto you. God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heavens and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands, neither is worshiped with men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things, and hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation, that they should seek the Lord, if he happily they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us. For in him we live and move and have our beings, as certain also of our own poets have said, for we are also his offspring. And we'll go ahead and turn to Romans chapter 8. Very familiar portion of scripture. Romans chapter 8 starting at verse 28. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified. You may all have your seats. As Paul was talking to the Roman or the the Greeks at Mars Hill, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; there was one &gt;&gt; section that he mentioned there. And he said, "And hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation." So Paul is saying that every nation, every country, every kingdom is set by God. &gt;&gt; He's the one who says, "This is where you're going to go. These are going to be your borders. This is where you're going to be at." Um, and as we look at Thanksgiving and we're going into the the season of Thanksgiving and thinking about what God did to bring the pilgrims to this land and begin America, we can see that God is going through and he is ordering each step along the way. Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; You know, we're going to take a few moments and for a few minutes, we're going to be doing a little bit of a a history lesson here as we we talk about it. But, &gt;&gt; you know, when we go back, it was in the early 1600s that really the story begins. In the early 1600s in England, everyone was legally required to belong to the Church of England. &gt;&gt; In order if you refuse to attend the Anglican church service, if you refuse to if you refuse to go to church, you could have fines that would increase each time you refuse to attend. &gt;&gt; Wow. Brother Wendle, that might get people coming to church a little more often, you know, but you would get fines increasing every time you refuse to attend. You could suffer surveillance and harassment from authorities. You could face imprisonment and you could be labeled a religious dissenter which harmed your ability to work, to own property, and to travel. All right? Now the pilgrims were part of a small group that were known as separatists. So you had these different groups. Now you had the Puritans in England that they thought that there was a way to purify the church of England. There was a way to improve the organization that we from within we can somehow fix the problem. &gt;&gt; Okay. But the pilgrims were part of a small group known as separatists where they believed it was too corrupt to fix. There was no way that they could fix it. And so they needed to leave. They needed to be apart. They needed to be different. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And so they wanted to separate entirely and form an independent congregation based solely on the scriptures. Now obviously because the Church of England was the required belief of the time &gt;&gt; their decision was extremely illegal. &gt;&gt; It was against every law that there was, every guideline that they could follow. They were criminals the moment they decided &gt;&gt; we need to be separate from the Church of England. In fact, King James I saw the separatists as both religious rebels and political threats. He famously declared, "I will make them conform or I will harry them out of the land." &gt;&gt; Under his rule, the separatists meetings were often raided. The leaders were arrested and jailed. Homes were searched. People were fined into poverty. Some separatists were watched by spies or forced into hiding. and life in England was becoming increasingly dangerous for them. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Around6007 to6008 somewhere in that timeline many separatists fled secretly to the Netherlands &gt;&gt; to Holland &gt;&gt; where religious freedom was allowed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You know, they settled in Leiden, a Dutch city that was known for its tolerance. And for the first time, they could worship freely without fear of arrest. &gt;&gt; But as they spent more time there, new problems began to arise &gt;&gt; because here they were in this country that was known for how it could be so tolerant. But the thing was it wasn't just tolerant to religion. &gt;&gt; It was tolerant to everything. That mindset of tolerance begins to spread. And what the pilgrims found was the nation tolerated all kinds of different sin. &gt;&gt; And that sin began to be attractive to the children that they were raising. where they had been in a country that they may have a struggle to be able to worship the way that they believed, they also weren't having to fight off a lot of sinful behavior &gt;&gt; because the entire country believed some form of Christianity. &gt;&gt; But now that they had the freedom to worship the the way they wanted, there was now because of tolerance, there was a lot of other things that could attract. They also began to find that the pilgrims were proud Englishmen. Even though they were living in Holland, they were still English to their roots. &gt;&gt; And they found that their children were beginning to adopt some of the tendencies of the nation that they were living in. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; So there was spiritual temptation going on. they their children were beginning to lose their identity as Englishmen because they were adopting into the country that they were within. &gt;&gt; They also found most pilgrims were farmers or or crafts people. But the problem was living in Leaden where they were, this was a bustling urban industrial city. &gt;&gt; There wasn't really good opportunities for farmers or basic crafts people. All right. &gt;&gt; And so they ended up taking the lowest paying base level jobs that they could. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; In fact, in order to support their families and make ends meet, they even found that the children would end up going and working in ribbon factories. And these children and teenagers were beginning to age before their time, being bent over from the kind of work that they were doing &gt;&gt; to where physically they were beginning to act like they were much older. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; They lived in poverty, often struggling to feed their families. By 16 somewhere between 1617 to 1619, the pilgrims decided that they really only had three choices. They could either continue as they were staying in Holland, remaining poor, risking their children, continuing to drift away spiritually and culturally. &gt;&gt; They could go back to England and face severe persecution again. Or they could try traveling to a new land, &gt;&gt; looking for the opportunities that this would give. The opportunity to be able to worship God freely, to be able to raise their children in the English heritage, to be able to live according to the scriptures without government interference, to build a community based on Christian principles. And yes, they even talked about if you look at their writings, the opportunity to be able to minister to the people in the new land. &gt;&gt; Yes, they were going for the opportunity to be able to have their own society and worship freely, but they were also looking for that missionary opportunity to be able to spread the gospel, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They weren't going and looking, hey, we're going to build a commune. We're not going to talk to anybody that's in this other land. But they were looking at as wherever we go, &gt;&gt; we can still be a witness. &gt;&gt; We can still be spreading the gospel. &gt;&gt; And so the pilgrims ended up working and making a deal with merchants to fund their journey because like I mentioned, the pilgrims were basically dirt poor. &gt;&gt; They were not working in in highpaying jobs. And so they needed some way to be able to to fund their journey. And so they came to a deal with these different merchants that the merchants would pay for their travel, send them over with supplies and everything and then they would pay them back. They would basically be indentured in some way for a while. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Depending on when they were first negotiating, it was going to be like we will work four days out of the week basically to repay the merchants and then two days out of the week we'll be working to provide for ourselves and our family. &gt;&gt; All right. This was not going to be a way to get rich, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; In fact, when you go through and you read some of their uh the works that were published from journals and things, they don't list that is the reason that they're going. They're not going they're not going to get land. They're not going for the purpose of getting wealthy and earning a lot of money. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This wasn't the reason that they were going to a new land. They were going to a new land to be able to worship, to be able to still serve their king. They were going under the opices of England, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They were, like I said earlier, they were Englishmen. &gt;&gt; They wanted to be Englishmen. They were proud to be Englishmen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they were going to this other land to proudly represent England. because it also allowed them to worship the way that they wanted. &gt;&gt; They would be able to worship according to the scriptures and they would be able to raise their children within that environment. &gt;&gt; They weren't going to suddenly become rich and wealthy and live in the lap of luxury. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, they were able to get two ships to be able to travel to the Americas. &gt;&gt; Yeah. or what would become the Americas to to the new land. &gt;&gt; They got what's called the Mayflower, which all of us know very well. And they also got the Speed Well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which fewer know about. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And they took the two ships and they left on their journey, but they kept having to stop in different ports because the speed well was leaking. They stopped in the first port and they got it fixed and then they set back on sail and the speed well was leaking again and they had to stop in a second port and get more repairs. And they left again and they had to stop in a third port because the speed well was once again leaking. Now, both ships had obviously been loaded with supplies and with people. And so those that had been traveling on the speed well, most of them ended up having to go back &gt;&gt; because they couldn't all get onto the Mayflower and it wasn't safe for the speed well to continue forward. But the Mayflower took on a few more people. &gt;&gt; It had a little bit of room that could work with. And then they set voyage. Now, the journey should have taken about 33 days, but because they encountered storms more than half of the time they were on the trip, it took them 66 days. So, the 33-day trip, they ended up having 33 days of storms, which meant they now had to travel 66 days because they were traveling so much slower. Ships at that time were not really used for transporting people, especially not in quantities. &gt;&gt; You might have one guest cabin to &gt;&gt; take a a couple across the &gt;&gt; the water to whatever nation they're going to, but they didn't travel in mass and ship. &gt;&gt; And so the pilgrims ended up staying in a space that was between the upper deck and the bottom hold. Those are approximately five feet tall. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; There was no standing. Even though most of them weren't the six feet tall we may consider more average now, they were all over five feet except for children. &gt;&gt; And so they spent the whole time either sitting, laying down, or hunched over. They wasn't a lot of light coming in. This was designed for storing supplies, for storing goods. This wasn't set up to be a guest quarters. And so, there weren't a lot of windows to let some light in. It was a very dark, dank area. There wasn't a lot of moving air. They weren't really allowed to go up on deck very often because they would get in the way of the sailors that were working. In fact, the sailors didn't like them. &gt;&gt; The sailors weren't happy to have all these people on board. &gt;&gt; It made their lives a lot more difficult. &gt;&gt; Transporting cargo was one thing. &gt;&gt; Transporting people that now had other needs &gt;&gt; made it far more difficult. In fact, one of the things that was the sailor's responsibility was it was their job to make sure that the community chamber pot was emptied twice a day &gt;&gt; withund and something people on the decks. This did not make this an enjoyable task &gt;&gt; and it just gave them more reasons to dislike the pilgrims &gt;&gt; and dislike those that were traveling. &gt;&gt; It was dark. It was dank. It was smelly. They had animal animals that were down below them which just made the smell even better. And so they went through storm after storm after storm. I mean, I can't imagine being on a boat for over 30 days of storms. &gt;&gt; I mean, most of us think it's bad enough when there's a storm here on land and we're cooped up in our house for a couple days. &gt;&gt; It's like, it's bad enough, man. I've been stuck in my house for the last two, three days because of rain, [sighs] &gt;&gt; you know, and here I'm sitting in air conditioned comfort. There's food in my fridge. There's a stove to cook. There's a bed to lay on. There's a toilet with running water, you know, &gt;&gt; and it's so rough for us that we've been rained in or snowed in or whatever storm has kept us cooped up in the house for a few days, &gt;&gt; but yet here they are stuck on this ship, stuck in this five foot tall space. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; With a hundred other people. Yeah. &gt;&gt; For over two months. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; With half of that being in stormy weather. &gt;&gt; When they finally arrived in the new world and they saw the land, they realized that they had been driven far north of where they were supposed to be going. When they had set out on this journey, they had papers that said they were being given land in what, according to the papers, they called Virginia, but would have been in modern day New York was where they were supposed to be. They were supposed to go where this one river was. I forgot to write down which river it is, but this was where they were supposed to set up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they realized that they were far too north. They were they were nowhere near where they were supposed to be. So, they tried to sail south. Oh, I'm sorry. I did have a written down. They were supposed to be where the mouth of the Hudson do float into the sea. And so they tried to sail south to get down to the land that they were supposed to be in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But they ended up in dangerous waters off the coast of Massachusetts. In modern day times, it's called the Pollock Rip, where there are more shipwrecks than any place else on the eastern seabboard. By God's providence, a wind came off the land that blew them back out to safety. And they came to realize, "We are never making it to where we're supposed to be at. &gt;&gt; We're not going to make it to the land that according to the paper is where we're supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Not happening. &gt;&gt; So, we have to go back to this other land." &gt;&gt; They sailed back up to Province Town. Now, as we look at God's providence in all this, we find that the Lord had pulled them up to a place in New England that had been deserted. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; They could have landed multiple other places along the coast and immediately encountered Indian tribes right off the bat. But instead they land in this place on the coast where the Indian tribe that had been there had been decimated by sickness. &gt;&gt; It was cleared already for them where it' be a place where they could build homes and plant crops and do all these things. &gt;&gt; And there was no one there. There was fresh running water and there was no one that had already claimed it. &gt;&gt; They had been guided to &gt;&gt; all right &gt;&gt; the spot that would provide what they had need of. This didn't mean that they were going to have a time without struggle. &gt;&gt; But yet God had led them to just the right spot. &gt;&gt; Okay. with dependable fresh water and land already being cleared and all these things that made it at least a little bit easier &gt;&gt; for them to start in the new land &gt;&gt; now written in one of the journals they I'm trying to remember because I didn't write down I believe it's uh oh maybe I did write it No, I didn't. That's okay. But one of them wrote and talked about the hardships going, "Here we are landing in a land in this strange land. There are no houses for us to shelter in. There is no inn for us to refresh ourselves at. There is no and he goes listing the multiple things that if you just traveled to an already settled land that would be there to make it a little bit easier &gt;&gt; as you're coming in to travel. &gt;&gt; There were no hotels. There were no motel. There were no &gt;&gt; there was nothing. &gt;&gt; And they had to learn all over again how in the world to plant crops because they were deal dealing with soil that was more sandy than what they had come from in England. The things that had grown well over there were not necessarily what would grow well here. The things that had grown well there were not necessarily the things that you would grow the exact same way here. &gt;&gt; Now when they arrived there had been a mixture. There were some that were the separatist pilgrims and there were some that had been sent by the merchants as other workers and things. And now as they were coming into this land, some of these others said, "Hey, there's no paperwork on this. There's no guiding principles that we have to follow. We can do whatever we want. We can live however we want. We can treat people however we want. We can do whatever we want because we are not under the king's law here." Now, the pilgrims had come with the goal to live in a Christian society. &gt;&gt; And so, before anyone ever got off the ship, there's no detail saying exactly how long they sat on there, and there's no detail saying exactly what the conversation was like. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But somehow they were able to take these two groups and come to an accord, come to an agreement of how they would govern &gt;&gt; to give some sort of guidelines that they would follow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's now known as the Mayflower Compact. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And it's actually a very very short document. This is not, you know, it's like if somebody wants to go read the Constitution, this is really long. The Mayflower Compact, &gt;&gt; is 12 to 15 lines, maybe. &gt;&gt; This is not a long document, &gt;&gt; but yet it lays out that basically we all agree to work under an elected leader. We will vote together to set up what the government is and we will work together to live in this land. Now, I mentioned earlier that the sailors did not like the pilgrims. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And after they had arrived, there were a lot of people that were sick and there were a lot of people that kept getting sick. And the sailor's mindset was get off the ship as fast as you can. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They didn't want to help at all. They wanted the pilgrims out of their hair. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But yet what you find is interesting. The sailors ended up getting sick. &gt;&gt; And then they begged the pilgrims that were healthy to come help take care of the sick sailors. &gt;&gt; And the pilgrims did. Yeah, &gt;&gt; because they were trying to live like Christians. &gt;&gt; They were trying to live according to the scriptures. They were trying to be witnesses. &gt;&gt; All right? Even if it was to the sailors that had ignored them, mistreated them, and despised them throughout the entire travel, &gt;&gt; they were going to still minister in the way that they could. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, as we go from that, we then begin to get into the part of the story that most know about from history and school. We now get to the part where they begin to try to to build homes. They begin to try to plant crops. They begin to try to set up some sort of society. And yet person after person is getting sick. Person after person is dying. &gt;&gt; In fact, at one point there were either six or seven people in the entire camp that were healthy enough to work. what had been a group of a hundred now laid out and you have six to seven people that are trying to feed, get enough water, make sure the fires are going for everybody else, &gt;&gt; trying to nurse the sick, take care of crops, hunt for food if possible, all these different things, &gt;&gt; right? And they're going through trial after trial. They're suffering after suffering as they go through. And then they begin to meet some of the Native Americans. The one that we know most from our history books is the one that was called Squanto. But there were several others as well that came in at different points. And what's interesting is that both Squanto and one of the others that I forget the name of became Christians because of the witness that they saw in the pilgrims. Now, Squanto died only a year or two after meeting the pilgrims, but he had converted. He had become a Christian. The other Native American that had accepted Christ lived just outside the pilgrim settlement so that he could be part of the community. And they but when they came they began to help teach the pilgrims how to plant. How could you make things grow in this sandy soil? What were the best ways to catch the fish that were in the river? What was the best ways to to do some of these different things? And this is one of the few times as brother Wendell was talking about that when we identify with the flag of America, we identify with the good and with the bad. Well, this is one of the history times when this is one of the few times that our treaty with the Native Americans was good and honest and forthright and respected for either over 50 or 60 years without any problems. &gt;&gt; They had come in, they weren't because the pilgrims had this mindset, like I said, they weren't trying to get rich. They weren't out to make themselves wealthy. They weren't out to try to make everything great for themselves. They wanted to be able to live in safety and worship the way that they believed was right. &gt;&gt; They weren't looking to take everything from anyone else. They just wanted peace &gt;&gt; and they wanted to be able to raise their families and they wanted to be able to worship their God. &gt;&gt; It wasn't uncommon both in Europe and possibly even in the Native American community to have a celebration at the harvest time. This wasn't something that that stood out that had never been done before. This wasn't something that they had never experienced as they were farmers growing crops over in England. To celebrate the harvest coming in was very natural. &gt;&gt; All the work, all the hours, all the labor. And here you were receiving the fruits of your labors. &gt;&gt; And so you would celebrate that it had been a good harvest or you would celebrate that Maybe it wasn't a good harvest, but it was enough. &gt;&gt; But you would celebrate at those times. And so to have a celebration at the harvest &gt;&gt; was not abnormal. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And so having this this harvest when they finally saw enough food coming in, when they finally saw that they maybe wouldn't have to struggle quite so hard the following year. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They they gathered in their harvest and they began to celebrate and to give thanks to God for the bounty. And Masso Masso and some 90 men came and they celebrated together. The Native Americans brought five deer and all of the men exercised their arms. So they shot bows and arrows. They shot their guns. They competed in friendly games of wrestling or whatever type of maybe running or whatever type of sports they they would do at that time. &gt;&gt; It was a three-day feast that also included fish and fowl as well of some of the harvest. &gt;&gt; That celebration that of the pilgrims and the Native Americans is the tradition that was handed down to us and became [crying] &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving. You know, I've been talking to my Sunday school students the past few weeks about being thankful and about thankfulness and about thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; And when you go through the scriptures and you look at the word thanksgiving, &gt;&gt; there are two things that really stand out. &gt;&gt; The first is that thanksgiving is always paired with praise and worship. It is a part of our communication and our relationship with God &gt;&gt; to give thanks. You don't just come in and praise God because he's so powerful and praise God because he's so amazing and praise God. Yes, you do that. &gt;&gt; But you also go in and you thank God for his many blessings. You thank God for all that he's done for us. You thank God for how he's taken care of &gt;&gt; thing after thing after thing. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And we thank God that &gt;&gt; he chose us. He called us. He shed his blood for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But it's a part of that conversation with God. It's a part of our normal, it should be a part of our normal daytoday &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; prayer life. The other thing that you find is as you go through the scriptures, it will talk about the sacrifice of thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; And when it's talking about the sacrifice of thanksgiving, it's not for the most part talking about a literal literal sacrifice on an altar. &gt;&gt; Okay? There is a sacrifice of thanksgiving but most of the times when you go through the scriptures it is not referencing build an altar and then you're going to sacrifice this particular animal on it and this is the sacrifice of thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And so it's something that you know you have to actually think about just a little bit. Okay. What what about thanksgiving is a sacrifice? What about being thankful &gt;&gt; is a sacrifice? I'm not going to ask my class because they were in there talking with me. Well, or at least listening to me talk about it. Yeah. I'm going to pick on the adults for a minute. Sister Mary, what would be a sacrifice about being thankful? What would be a sacrifice about offering thanksgiving when you don't feel like it? Okay, Dylan, what do you think? What would be why would it be a sacrifice to offer thanksgiving? Okay. So I don't know that there is one set right answer. But as I thought about it, particularly as I looked at it within our society. We live in a society where most people think they are owed everything. &gt;&gt; People think they deserve everything. &gt;&gt; To me, like I said, this is not gospel. This is brother Harry's opinion after thinking and praying about it a little bit. &gt;&gt; So if you disagree, I'm okay with that. Brother Wendle can correct me if he disagrees. I am I'm fine taking correction. But to me, if I am truly expressing my thankfulness, I am having to sacrifice my pride. I'm having to sacrifice my own inflated ego, my own thinking that I'm so great. I deserve all of this. &gt;&gt; And I have to then approach in the humility to go &gt;&gt; I appreciate that because &gt;&gt; sure &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve that. And this applies even more when you're looking at it as the sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Lord because I deserved nothing. &gt;&gt; There was nothing that he has done for me that I can stand here and gay say I deserved that. &gt;&gt; You owed me that, God. &gt;&gt; It's a good way to get struck by lightning. We are supposed to be coming in and we're offering our thanksgiving as part of our worship, as part of our praise. And we're offering it in the humility to know, God, I did not deserve anything you've given me. I did not deserve you to choose me. I did not deserve you to die for me. I did not deserve for you to provide. &gt;&gt; I did not deserve for you to give me a job. I did not deserve for you to heal my body. I did not deserve for you to give me a family. &gt;&gt; Take your pick of what it is. Everything that's there, I did not deserve it. &gt;&gt; It is not because of my greatness and my overinflated ego that I get anything. I have to sacrifice that thought that I am so great, so wonderful, &gt;&gt; and approach with the humility of thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for what you've done for me. Thank you for how you provide for me. Thank you for all the blessings that are in my life. And so many of them maybe I don't even notice. &gt;&gt; Come on. You know, most people when they think about Thanksgiving in the modern era, it's all about the great food, the the big feast they're going to eat. It's all about football on TV. It's all about the parade on TV. It's all about time with friends and family that maybe you really don't want to be with, but you're going to be with because it's a holiday and that's what you do. In fact, it's even become normal that a well-known part of Thanksgiving, if you look it up online, and if it's on the internet, it must be true. But if you look it up, there is what's called a cousin walk. I hadn't heard about this until someone at work mentioned it and I had to look this up. And this is very much because of the crowd that I run with. This is not how life works. But the cousin walk is when you are around family that stress you out so much that you need to walk away and go outside and have a joint in order to relax to be able to get back with the family. And as shocking as that is to hear in a sermon, that is a normal standard part of Thanksgiving for a lot of people apparently. Like I said, obviously that's not the circle I run in because I had never heard of it until someone at work mentioned it. And I had to go look this up to go, is this a real thing? Cuz this does not sound like what Thanksgiving is supposed to be. But in for most people, they're not thinking about let me thank God for everything that he's done. &gt;&gt; Let me thank God for his blessings. Let me thank God for his provision. Let me thank God for what we have. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, as what I mentioned before, some of the challenges that the pilgrims faced are now becoming the same challenges we face here. &gt;&gt; The challenges that they faced in the other country. My mind's blanking for a moment. Holland. There we go. The challenges that they faced in Holland because of the tolerance that allowed everything to go. &gt;&gt; We see the same thing here. &gt;&gt; We have now become a nation of tolerance. &gt;&gt; Great. You can act however you want. You can do whatever you want. Whatever you think is truth, if it's your truth, that's good enough. It used to be you would say as long as you're not bothering anybody else, you believe whatever you want to believe. &gt;&gt; Now it's become as long as you're only bothering Christians, you're good. &gt;&gt; As long as you don't bother the Muslims, as long as you don't bother the Islam, as long as you don't bother the atheists, as long as you don't bother &gt;&gt; dot dot dot dot &gt;&gt; Oh, Christian. Yeah, you can bother Christians all you want. just don't bother the others and you're fine. &gt;&gt; We've become a nation of tolerance and the same challenges that the pilgrims saw in that nation. &gt;&gt; The temptation of sin that would attract their young people. The loss of identity for who they truly were. Their loss of cultural and spiritual integrity is the same thing that we now see today in America. The same struggles that we face. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; As a parent, you're trying to raise your child to resist those spiritual temptations. We're trying to raise our children to hold on to their identity as Christians. And yes, as brother Wendell talked about, we're proud to be Americans. We're patriotic. We stand up for the flag. We respect the flag, but we're still trying to hold on to our identity because this is not our land. Okay. &gt;&gt; You know, as we talk about Thanksgiving and this is the season everybody thinks about it. As I mentioned earlier, for us as Christians, thanksgiving and thankfulness should be part of our everyday &gt;&gt; walk, our everyday talk, our everyday communication. Because thanksgiving, as I mentioned, it it's a part of worship. When you read through the Psalms, you will see thanksgiving paired with praise, paired with worship, time after time after time after time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 18 says, "In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you." [crying] In everything give thanks. That doesn't just mean in the good times. It doesn't it doesn't just mean when your back doesn't hurt. It doesn't just mean when you've got every bill paid and you have more than enough money in the bank. &gt;&gt; It doesn't just mean when you've got more than enough work, when you've got more than enough this or that. &gt;&gt; It doesn't just mean when everybody's healthy and happy and doing well. &gt;&gt; But it's give thanks in in everything. Yes. &gt;&gt; As Christians, we're not just offering thanks at Thanksgiving. It's a good reminder, but we shouldn't have to be reminded. This should be part of our everyday life. This should be part of our everyday relationship with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalms 107 and verse one. Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good. For his mercy endureth forever. &gt;&gt; We can go through psalm after psalm, scripture after scripture &gt;&gt; that is reminding us and telling us, give thanks to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Worship him. Praise him. Give thanks for his many blessings. Give thanks for the way that he's working in your life. Give thanks for how he's helped you overcome. Give thanks in the midst of the trial. &gt;&gt; Give thanks in the midst of the storm. &gt;&gt; The pilgrims as they came into this time of thanksgiving, there had been a lot of death. They had had a lot of loss. &gt;&gt; They had gone through a lot of struggles. &gt;&gt; But yet, they could still come through it. And they could still express their thankfulness to the God that had brought them to the new land. Express their thankfulness to the God that had given them the crops, &gt;&gt; that had given them the Native American friends that would help them to be able to grow the crop crops better. &gt;&gt; The God that had helped them to survive diseases when so many had not. This wasn't an easy time. &gt;&gt; Even though it was the harvest, this wasn't a time that you would be looking at and thinking, "Oh, let's celebrate. Look at all the graves. Look at all that we've lost. Look at all that we've suffered." But yet, they could still go into with the thankfulness that God had provided. As I mentioned when Paul was talking, he said that God sets the borders, &gt;&gt; that God sets the kingdoms, that God sets the nations. &gt;&gt; And now we can look back and go, so God sent the pilgrims here to begin the start of a nation that would become the home to a Kentucky hillbilly. that would be the messenger to the last age. &gt;&gt; That would break the seals and open up the word &gt;&gt; that will allow us to just like the pilgrims had desired be able to worship according to the word. &gt;&gt; The pilgrims came because they wanted to worship the way the Bible said. &gt;&gt; They didn't want to just follow what some orthodox religion told them to do. They didn't want to follow what some king or some man had set up. They wanted to be able to look at the scripture and according to their convictions and the convictions of their heart go this is what I'm supposed to do. And God said in that land where that's the desire I'm going to place the prophet that will open the word so that people can worship according to the word and actually understand what's there &gt;&gt; and they can worship and they can have that freedom. And yes, there are plenty of things about America that we wish we could change. There are plenty of things about America that we can look at and go, "I'm not proud of that." Whether it's present or history, &gt;&gt; yes, the flag is marred. &gt;&gt; Yes, there have been things that happened that we can look back and go, "That wasn't right. &gt;&gt; That wasn't what was supposed to happen. That wasn't how the nation should have gone. &gt;&gt; But yet we can also stand here and go, I have the freedom to worship. I have the freedom to praise my God. I have the freedom to live according to the convictions that he's given me. &gt;&gt; Amen. We come into this season of Thanksgiving and we could go through all the presidents that made proclamations about it. We could go through the history of how it became actually a holiday and all these different things. But Thanksgiving for a Christian is part of us. &gt;&gt; For a Christian, thanksgiving should be at our heart. We don't have to have a specific day for it. &gt;&gt; We appreciate the day. We enjoy the food. We enjoy spending time with our family. We enjoy the fellowship. But whether it's at the end of November, &gt;&gt; whether it's the middle of January or February, whether it's the heat of the summer, whether it's the cold of the winter, whether it's take your pick of what season, time, whenever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every day is thanksgiving for us. &gt;&gt; Every day is the day that we are coming to God, that we are praising him, that we are thanking him, that we are expressing our gratitude for all that he's done for us because it's a part of us. It's part of who we are as Christians. It's part of how we worship. That's what Thanksgiving is for us, &gt;&gt; brother. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well said, brother Harry. Appreciate you, &gt;&gt; your family, man. what you mean to the church and to the bride. We're thankful for your ministry. That's a hard thing. Amen. Like you said, you didn't want to do this. Amen. Amen. I I never volunteered either. So, my pastor said, "You're getting up there." 17, 18 years old, &gt;&gt; you know. So I obeyed. Thank God. Amen. That's all he asks us to do is obey. Amen. And be thankful. Amen. Give thanks with a grateful heart. &gt;&gt; Give thanks [singing] with the grateful heart. Give [singing and music] thanks &gt;&gt; to the holy one. &gt;&gt; Give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ [music] his son. Give thanks [singing] with a grateful [music] heart. &gt;&gt; Give thanks, Jesus &gt;&gt; to the Holy One. Give thanks because he's given Jesus [singing] Christ [music] his son.

[singing] Oh, give thanks [music] with a grateful [singing] heart. Give thanks to the [singing and music] holy one.

Say, "I am rich [singing] [music] because of what the Lord has done [music] for [singing] all of us." Oh, and now let the [music] weak say I am strong. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; And let the poor say I am rich because [music] of [singing] what the Lord has done for us. [music] Give thanks. [singing] [music] Somebody give him thanks. [applause] All that he has done. Amen. [singing] Amen. No wonder they called [music] it Providence Rhode Island and other places. Amen. Providence Town.

And he's had a very big part to play in our family, the church here, the camps, and all the things you guys put on. And, uh, I've told this before, I'll tell it again. Years ago, he said we [music] should teach our children to praise. And that was the fruit of that seed that was planted. And I just thank the Lord for three children [applause and music] that love the Lord. They love to praise the Lord. And my wife's already feeling the fourth doing little somersaults in there when the music starts and [music] things like that. She's like, "It's going to moving again. It's going to moving again." So, we just we've got a lot to be thankful for, saints. &gt;&gt; We have the word of this hour that has made all these mysteries clear. &gt;&gt; And we know who we serve. We know how to serve, how to please God. And and oh my, what a blessing it is. God bless you. We love you everyone. Appreciate you. [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

A hopeless case, [music] an empty place if not for grace, a hopeless case, an empty [music and singing] place if not for grace. Bless the Lord. How blessed we [music] are in this Thanksgiving season. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I see I see what this message [music] has produced and I think the proof is in the pudding. And it's God's divine grace that has been extended to us [music] in this generation by the word. And I I can truly say that um what an incredible cream of the crop that I get to preach to on a weekly basis. The cream of the crop, young people, mamas and daddies, the desires, everyone desiring [music] to love God. I thank God for that. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the glorious message of Jesus Christ that's come to give us a settledness. And again, that's not to say [music] that there's not a struggle or there's not a battle. It's just simply [music] to say that there's an anchor. And many [music] times many people feel and especially [music] young but but it's all of us we you know uh Satan fights us in our minds that we're not children of God, [music] that we're not bride, we're not saved. But just to look around and [music] your desires and your love, your enjoyment with the word of the Lord, [music] being able to come and sing as we have sung tonight. What gives you that? What what gives you those desires? What causes that that overwhelming love? It's God. Don't ever second guessess God's love for you [music] and God's grace upon your life. This [music] message has come to you. You've not accepted it. It's accepted you. It's brought you in [music] and said, "You're mine." &gt;&gt; When [music] I say you didn't accept it, it accepted you. What part do you have [music] as the song says, "Something keeps holding me." &gt;&gt; When you've said you're [music] going to quit, you've couldn't &gt;&gt; because the message has pulled you. And if there's someone here tonight in this Thanksgiving [music] season that you're struggling in your soul and but God sees every tear. God sees [music] the tears at night when no one else does. God knows the heart. And I want you to know that he's bottling up every tear. There's been a lot of wonderful songs of grace [music] and courage. Wonderful songs of Amen. when we don't understand where we're at and why we're there. And that's these are these were songs tonight that [music] comes from a real understanding that God is in control of all things. Amen. So, let's take this to heart in this Thanksgiving [music] season and and love him and and [music] um if you're not walking closely with the Lord tonight, why don't you do it? If you're a little weward in your spirit, your soul, why don't you just talk to the Lord? Sometimes the hardest thing for me to [music] do was to talk to dad. Amen. Dad was the disciplinarian. But once I become a father and knew the heart of my father, I knew that my dad was for me the entire time. He didn't want to put me in a corner. He didn't want to give me a whooping. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though he's given me a few of them, but his heart, &gt;&gt; his heart [music] was for me. &gt;&gt; And God's grace for you. [music] You might think, "Well, God don't love me. Well, God don't." That's a bunch of baloney. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You cannot You cannot exhaust the love of God. A son of God cannot exhaust his love. He loves his children. Can you say amen? Praise the Lord. Well, I enjoyed this tonight. [applause] I did. [applause] So, we're thankful. Thankful for all everything. Thankful brother Merl. Brother Merl, you've done a fine job tonight. Amen.
