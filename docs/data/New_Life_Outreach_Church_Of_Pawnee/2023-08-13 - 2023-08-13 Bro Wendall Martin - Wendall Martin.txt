orange on his on his brain and he's also got some on his lungs and so I um we we're just believing the Lord to do something special for Robin and and though he's not here amen we can still pray for him and ask the Lord to touch him and to make him whole and I'm telling you brother uh Ron Spencer is is quite an example of God's grace and what God has done for brother Ron and and we're just believing the same thing for Robin and um man praying for his soul and for his his healing amen let's look here in in Hebrews 6 and 11. amen we'll we'll start here Hallelujah and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them and end of all strife wherein God more a willing more abundantly to show Into The Heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope will you have as an anchor of the Soul both sure instead fast which in Earth into that within the Veil whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made in high priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your love thank you for your grace Upon Our Lives Lord thank you for this service and Lord the songs of Zion that have been sung the prayers that have been prayed Lord we have lifted our voices and our hearts unto you but Lord we're asking that you would speak to us this morning that your presence would be here with us in a real special way and I'm asking Lord that the Holy Spirit would just meet every need Lord you see Robin the father wanted to come and be prayed for Lord and father you see how he's had to leave and I'm asking the Lord that you would go with him Lord that you would touch him Lord and Body Spirit and soul Lord that you would curse those things that are trying to destroy him Lord and that you would bring healing to Him Father let him know you today in a in a greater way than ever before we give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen and a man praise the Lord hallelujah so we're we're thankful tonight for this morning for his love and if you give me a little more monitors up here on the on the um on these monitors platform I want to speak this morning the anchor holds amen I want to say there's going to be a rapture in spite of laodicea there's going to be God's word will be fulfilled amen regardless of what takes place we have an anchor amen we have an anchor so there's there's two immutable things that God was going to give us as an anchor amen the first immutable thing is every word of God is true won't you turn to your neighbor and say every word of God is true amen that's the first immutable thing God gave the promise amen and it was just as good as fulfilled right then and there because God simply cannot change his mind he he and he is sure cannot lie can you say Amen the second immutable thing is God confirmed it with an oath now amen so he his words are true so when he gives a promise it cannot change and then God confirmed it with an oath now the Bible says that he could not swear by anyone or anything greater because he was God there is no greater so he swore by himself now today amen isn't it you know we we would consider it a contract amen we signed contracts that have the weight of the law behind them amen if you renege on your on your contract you will face legal action because the amen it is it is a it is a signed contract it has been notarized it has been amen uh it has been declared as official and so the contract you you will amen uh you you keep the contract you're into the contract or you'll man go before a judge amen now today you know words aren't aren't as important as as what they were uh in the Bible days now but in the Bible days amen men swore they would swear in the name of God they're Gods they would swear in the name of of a a Caesar or the a great man they would amen and so they would they would swear in the name of someone greater that would require it of him if he were to break that promise amen so the Oaths take it in the name of the greater person they were not broken amen because of the fear of the retribution that would come amen from that one uh who did not uh fulfill the promise is that right you understand what I'm saying so they would so when the Apostle Paul was saying amen he could swear by no greater so he swore by himself amen now I I I liked it when God says I swore by myself what an allegiance I I will swear by my Majestic name I will I will swear I am the author of all truth I am the author of all honesty I am the Fountain of all integrity and I give of my own character my word hallelujah I give you my promise and I swear by my own righteousness I'm now now God's not doing this to hold himself responsible now now men do it amen they write the contract to hold each other responsible but God's not drawing this up to hold himself responsible he's not afraid that he might renege on the promise he is drawing it up so that you know that he will keep his word Hallelujah this morning oh we don't we don't have to say I I I I hope God keeps his end of the deal God says I'm going to keep my end of the deal and I am going to give you my word and I'm going to give I have proved it by Jesus Christ amen and I he's not listening he's not tempted to break his word this morning amen God's not tempted to break his word God God doesn't have temptations amen God's not tempted to amen Almighty I didn't see this happening God I it's not saying I just don't understand or I don't know or I didn't understand her I didn't know amen but God's got his word and his word is still anchored and his word is still true his word is still alive his word amen is is just as good today as it ever was can I hear a great big amen God cannot lie amen there's one there's two things that will never change amen he can't lie and he is always there to prove his word this morning amen all in your darkest of hours in your in your in your nighttime season his work is still prevalent Hallelujah when I walk through the valley of the shadow of death Thy word thy rod and thy stealth they do comfort me amen the rod is is there to lead the Sheep but it's also there Amen to defend the Sheep it's it's there to a man to direct them and to steer him it's got the little the little cane the little hook on it amen to draw Amen to throw ones out of the out of the snare and and this that and the other but it is also amen the rod that'll beat down amen the the wicked one that comes against you and when God gives you his word brother it's not just a promise but it is a weapon amen it is something that God has given to you so that you can rise or can you say amen that's the reason why the psalmist said amen though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me amen thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepare us a table for me in the midst of mine enemies you know why because you little more day in my life you are watching over my life and you will keep my life amen and we're all in different stages of Life maybe you're going through it amen mind battles maybe you're someone's going through something in the marriage or maybe it may be a child amen having math problems amen but let me tell you something God is aware and God cares for his people amen why would God come down amen why would the word come down in flesh and hang on Calvary why would the word come down amen and give his life amen why would the word w-o-r-d come in flesh for you if he didn't care for you many of times we look at the word as the Commandment we look at Commandments as if a man is you know God's looking for some way to destroy us or to kill us God's given us his word amen to to assure us to secure us to give us that stability in this life where there is no stability amen now what we read here is his word amen his word his promise becomes an anchor to the soul an anchor to the soul Hallelujah in other words you can hang your hat on that word you can you can trust in the word of God because that word will never oh Hallelujah you say oh but I'm sick this morning just hang on to that anchor brother Wendell I'm discouraged this morning oh your Anchor Holds this morning amen can you say Amen now that word is the only thing that's unchanging his promise God gives his word and he cannot lie somebody say he gives his word and he cannot lie oh oh amen what we need this morning is an anchor what we need in this land a man of uncertainty and up and down in the upheavals we need an anchor and I'm so glad we've got an anchor in Jesus Christ can you say amen amen hallelujah he proved it oh Church of the Living God Amen we may be few in number here this morning amen maybe you may feel like you're few in in your situation amen but I want you to take strong consolation he's given us his word as an anchor and if you will keep that anchor there is nothing that can do I'm not one that believes that amen you're saved today and you're lost tomorrow I'm just not one that believes that God loves you today and he hates you tomorrow but he's given you his word hallelujah amen the word is the anchor can you say man if you're being tossed this morning by the storms of life amen and you don't know if you know if you're up or you're down if you're being carried by The Tempest just let down that anchor this morning amen they say those old ships they'll drop those sea anchors and it'll go it it'll it'll go for amen hundreds of feet down into the amen until it hits the bottom of the uh the the bed of the sea hallelujah amen and it'll it'll it'll it'll hit a rock or it'll hey man it'll it'll just uh uh uh take take anchor into the the the the bed there and it will hold them who praise the Lord it'll hold them it don't matter what's going on it no matter whether up or down it don't matter whether we're being tossed to or through brother Branham says he was he was flying over and he saw that one ship a man and it was a bad storm windy and that ship was just going up and down and brother Brad a water was coming over it and I mean it was just going every which direction but the ship was just staying still and he asked the guy the next to him he said what's causing that to happen he says oh he's anchored down he's anchored down all that old ship was just going every which direction but he was anchored down friends I'm glad we've got an anchor y'all didn't promise that you were going to have a smooth sailing God didn't promise you weren't going to have mind battles God didn't promise you weren't going to be tempted but he did promise I will never change and you can anchor your soul upon me Hallelujah we'll praise the Lord amen your ankle is is is is is is Lodge in the Rock within that Veil Hallelujah Jesus is already went into the veil and I love what the what what what what the Apostle Paul was saying here amen he said now he says that we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul as an anchor of the Soul amen of both sure and steadfast which enter into that within the veil whether the Forerunner is in entered for us can you say Amen so what is Christ doing Christ is on the other end and he's interceding for you brother John he's on the other end and he's got the Rope he's holding on to the Rope Oh Glory are you are y'all hearing we've already got one who has come through life who has went through the storms of life who has been crucified beat battered and put in the grave and he has risen and he is already there to Anchor you Hallelujah so when you when you're when you're meeting an intercessor amen you've got one on the other side saying oh amen I'm praying for your faith I'm believing for you amen I'm strengthening oh come on church he sends his holy spirit down to make sure that you know that your anchor holds Hallelujah I said your Anchor Holds this morning oh come on church we got to get rid of this fear and scare we got to get rid of this and we got to get rid of looking at things in our natural eyes as if amen well amen I'm in a prison house here I can't go out there and have fun I can't go out there and run around I can't go out there and paint the town around amen because the Bible listen below is not against you the law is there to secure you in this age of sin and you say Amen Hallelujah in this age of sin you've got an anchor you've got an anchor

window he's behind the veil you saw him in flesh he died in flesh he paid the price and flesh but now he has risen and he's behind the veil though I can't see him though I come on church amen but occasionally I begin to feel a little tug on the road occasionally I begin to feel a little something saying I've still got you and that I can start singing that song something keeps holding me through every trial I see or can you say man oh Satan he's a hit in my heart but I'm an anchor all Satan's hitting my mind hard but I'm hanging on to the Anchor Sago ah Hallelujah this is all I'm

there but she is there call her temptation all right now you all are going now pull on me Hallelujah are you guys going marriage but in Temptation and sickness and everything is but I have an anchor [Music] they might pull this way and they might pull out but my anchor holds to that within the Veil thank you Hallelujah that was in the veil Hallelujah all the enemies he's he's a tough one the enemy will come against you just as hard as he can come against you but I'm here to tell you if your anchor is in Christ Jesus you cannot fail oh praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord now I looked to see what would how do you get rid of that and how do you get that anchor unlaunched praise the Lord to get the anchor enlarged after it's gone down hundreds of feet and hooked into a rock or the they say what you've got to do is you've got to do a sweeping turn and go the opposite direction Hallelujah so if you're turning and you're going the opposite direction your anchor can't hold you you've got praise the Lord many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers them out of them all well come on but for those guys that'll turn around and walk away from this message and say they don't need it anymore it's no wonder amen there is a big percentage of them I I I have heard that there is like a 20 30 percentage a percentile of of of of of of message believers who have left the message who have become homosexuality uh homosexuals and lesbians because the anchor no longer holds they've walked away they have loosened well praise the Lord why is it that the preacher is preaching constantly every service stick with the word it don't matter what you think it don't matter amen you're at what your attitudes are it don't matter uh you know how you see things it's what the Bible says because the Bible cannot change you might have your own views you might have your own attitudes you might say and the whole world may see it that way but brother I want to tell you what they don't see is you've got an anchor that is securing you oh when you should be a statistic here you sit here this morning and you're blast when you should be in misery you're sitting here this morning in your blast oh come on church amen lastly Odyssey or they're out there amen and they let you do whatever you want to do and amen they've got their you know their suppers and they've got all their games and their programs and they've got all of that but brother where's their anchor where's their anchor but I have an anchor of my soul it's Jesus Christ the word can you say Amen yes sir now amen therein when you look Hallelujah name man when you look there at Abraham the Bible said but in due time Abraham obtained the promise Abraham obtained the promise now I I want you to I want you to look at that the oath was given the anchor held until the promise came that was 25 long years and I want to tell you amen hallelujah there there's there's no changing there's no many times there's there's intervals amen there's intervals between the promise and the performance many times there's a delay between the promise and the Fulfillment amen so so just because God gives a promise and it doesn't happen immediately does not mean a man that that that God's word is not true that is why you've got the anchor because your faith is going to be tested Hallelujah the Bible says it's not him that starts in the race it's not him that runs the fastest but it's him that endures to the end and if you don't want your ship falling apart you don't want to be wrecked you don't want to be destroyed you've got to have an anchor praise the Lord amen God gave the promise to Abraham he gave that promise he gave his word Abraham had to stand by faith upon that word no one could see a physical rope tied to him no one could see a physical anchor but he anchored his soul upon that word it didn't matter what it looked like it didn't matter that Sarah was Barren it didn't always bear it it didn't matter that he was dead it did not matter What mattered God gave the promise and he was hooked to it well praise the Lord you know why God does that because in the delay is where you find where you're anger is in the delay is where you find where your faith is hallelujah amen yes there's always an interval there's always a time between the promise and the performance sometimes the interval can be quite lengthy because God's time is not exactly the way you see time amen but if you have an anchor there is nothing that can move your faith God simply says walk by faith hallelujah amen God I said God says to walk by faith amen if you uh there in inhabic amen I I brought Advocate just in case I need it amen habitict two and two and it says in the Lord answered me and said write the vision make it plain upon tables that that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it somebody says I'm in the I'm in the delay but I'm waiting for it can you say amen he says though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come and not Terry now what did he say to do in the time of the delay he says behold his soul which is lifted up in him is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith in what faith in that anchor right division make it clear put it off here because you're going to have to use you're going to have to stand upon that he's going to wait a while it might be a little bit Hallelujah Abraham you you you're going to have to wait for you're going to have to wait for 25 years I'll praise the Lord God told the disciples he says I don't want you to do anything until you go to Jerusalem you stay there in Jerusalem until you beaten dude from power on high they got there amen they stayed the night all night long expect it to come amen the next day nothing happened the next day nothing happened the next day nothing happened but they were anchored to the words that Jesus said Jesus said go to Jerusalem and wait there until you be endued with power from on high can you say man Hallelujah God tells Noah building Ark it's going to rain man no one's out there building an ark 120 years later the first drop came Hallelujah well praise the Lord so when God gives the promise there is a delay in its fulfillment many times Hallelujah but that doesn't stop it all you've got to do is feel the anchor can you say amen amen amen so that in the the interval or the delay is is there to try your faith it's there to see if you're going to Anchor yourself to God's word it's there to see if you believe God the way God believes his word it's there to see if you're going to stand there in the midst of it all and say I can't do nothing else but believe you say brother whatever Judas don't understand I'm falling apart I'm dying you just don't understand it's almost taking me it's it's it's sweeping me away I want you right now amen to just reach up and feel that that that spiritual rope that is held to you amen why don't you why don't you grab your bible right now and say God I'm anchoring myself to you amen why why are you still here why haven't you fallen apart before amen because God he's the anchor I I I heard a preacher say one time amen but God but God but God put God but God is your anchor what is the name of that anchor he says call it but God Amen you were there in in Ephesians 2 and 2 he says you were once one of them you were once filthy you were once by Nature the children of Wrath even as others are amen but but then he says but God who is rich in Mercy you were once a rebellious uh uh you know son of a buck but you're about God you were once amen a filthy loser but God you were once amen going to die but God you were once one of those that that couldn't even sit in this church but God but God oh come on church let me there's been so many but gods in your life there's been so many times but God stood in there's been so many situations but God stepped up there's been so many of those times where God stepped in Hallelujah can you say man amen when when when when Abraham Hallelujah when he had sort of when he was was throwing his wife at the king he meant for his own skin amen he says now listen you're pretty that guy's gonna that guy's going that guy's gonna kill me and take you home Hallelujah so he says he says you just tell him you're my sister hallelujah amen I don't care he can have you but I want to live praise the Lord and so and he and he takes it and he's going to marry her hey man is going to make her one of well you know want one of his Harem there and and and and but what did God what what did scripture say but God God's step God gave the dream and God says that man's wife uh you've got another man's wife you know why because God gave the promise and God was anchored to that promise you're anchored to that promise God had already said that Abraham and Sarah was going to have a baby oh come on Church the circumstances were trying to pull her away and listen it looked like it was all but done and God stepped in and said no I've done given my word as the anchor or if we could rely on predestination I think we could go through we could go through life a little bit easier if we could realize that the purpose of God in our lives is going to be fulfilled amen if you could rely upon God and say I've been placed here upon Earth for a purpose and there is nothing that is going to take that purpose from me I can't die until that purpose is done I can't be defeated until that purpose is done I cannot lie because there is a predestinated word concerning me I might not have life like others I might not see things like colors but I the whole Church of the Living God you've got a purpose amen if you're still sitting in this church here this morning you got a purpose if you're still alive you have a purpose praise the Lord now man the delay the delay sometimes can an interval is a pause or break in activity man interval is is an intermission separating parts of a theatrical or musical performance man interval is a delay or a lingering it's a an interval or a gap between one vent to another it's the space between two things can you say man in the interval it doesn't seem to be too much happening in fact it just seems like amen it just seems like maybe God's forgot about his word and the devil's just having a Heyday is that right amen Hallelujah Malachi he was the last of the of the prophets of the Old Testament and Malachi had stood up and said behold I send my messenger before my face Malachi 3 amen and he shall prepare the way before me and then the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly appear in his Temple or is that word suddenly again amen even the messenger of the Covenant who shall abide and then he asks who shall abide in the day of his coming who shall stand when he appears he shall be like a Refiner's Fire in a fuller soap oh my everyone's all saying all the Messiah is fixing to come we're here and then it was 400 years 400 years of nothing you're not hearing God speak there's no prophets in the Land There is nothing Malachi has just said he's coming he's coming he's coming he's coming and everyone's looking 400 years later well praise the Lord 400 year Delay from Malachi to Jesus there was silence are y'all understand Hallelujah sometimes you think that God forgot about you and that God's forgot about his promise and you're praying and you're not getting your answer and you're studying and you ain't feeling no tingles up and down your spine that's when you've got to know that you're anchored well praise the Lord oh in Pentecost we was just always looking for somebody to lay hands on us and prophesy I'd come to church amen I remember as a teenager come to church just want brother Burris to say something over me amen hallelujah I just wanted I I I didn't care if it's good or bad I just wanted to know that God would knew about me and then hallelujah but now that I've grown up a little bit my Anchor's not in Prophecy prophecies will fail my anchor is not in gifts gifts will fail but there's one thing I and I'm thankful for the gifts and I'm thankful for prophecy and I'm thankful I'm thankful for joy and I'm thankful for but I want to tell you there's only one thing that's going to keep me there's only one thing that's going to secure me that's the word of God can you say amen and when everything was up and down in every which direction and and and and so it had been there wasn't a peep from God there wasn't there wasn't a hint there wasn't a sound there wasn't anything and then suddenly suddenly appears Zach an angel appears unto Zechariah and then on then and then boom Here Comes an angel appearing to Mary Zechariah was told you're going to have a son he's going to be a prophet he's going to amen Mary if fear not Mary you uh you know you're highly esteemed of God among women amen here it comes Angelic visitation to Joseph an angel visits Joseph and tells Joseph amen this this this this this a child that that is within Mary fear not amen it's from the Holy Ghost she didn't she wasn't lying around with somebody else amen and then there was visitations to Simeon and there was a visitation to Anna and God was telling them you're not going to die until you see the Lord's Messiah you're not going to die Hallelujah and then all of a sudden now the inner War went for 400 years and now there's Angels showing up everywhere there's Angels showing up here there's Angels showing up there amen what was it it was time for the word to be fulfilled well y'all ain't listening to me here this morning Angels appeared unto the shepherds in the field the pillar of fire appears unto the magias as they are out there looking can you say Amen oh and this baby's born everyone's excited I mean the Shepherds have already declared it Mary is excited everyone's excited angels have been appearing everywhere and then they disappear and there is silence for 12 years you don't read nothing more of Jesus there ain't no Angels appearing to him anymore praise the Lord and about that time they're looking back think was this real was this was was did that really happen maybe the Shepherds were saying were those really angels that appeared or was that in our imagination maybe Simeon would say was I sure come on you say huh no they didn't think that the the Bible said John John the prophet when he was in jail John the prayer Prophet sent his sent his followers and said hey go ask him are you the Messiah or are we still looking for this was the one who saw the pillar of Fire coming down on Jesus and John in his trial is now asking well praise the Lord can you say Amen so it went for 12 years 12 years amen and now nothing and then all of a sudden Boop Here Comes Christ he pops up in the temple amenities and he's and he's confounding the the rulers and and he's and he's there discussing scripture with them and they're all thinking wow where did this guy get his wisdom and his knowledge and his understanding of scriptures wow this kid this kid's amazing and then all of a sudden nothing else in Scripture 18 years later 18 that was 12 years old and then when she shows up to the River Jordan amen at the age of 30. 18 years later are y'all catching my drift he was the living promise the promise was there but there was a delay there was an interval there was there was a could this be something else God does things in a way to where you have to trust him you have to trust him and so now amen here he is we don't hear nothing nothing nothing nothing eight eight in years and then John the Baptist comes out of the wilderness John the Baptist his mom and dad dies when he's about eight or nine years old and he goes out in the wilderness amen he didn't he didn't have no parents take him in or nothing he just went out in the wilderness no one knew anything about John he's just a poor kid that that died somewhere out he just reported he did he he had a heart heartbreak with his mom and dad when they died and then and then all of a sudden Here Comes this guy hair hanging down hat and shaved or taking a bath every six months amen he he was he was he was eating wild locusts and honey he was hairy all over he was draped in sheepskin and he comes walking out Hallelujah and he and he goes out there and begins to to say I am The Voice crying in the wilderness out of the Wilderness I'm the voice prepare ye the way of the Lord and everyone's looking at John the Baptist thinking are you nuts if this is the Messiah man this is really messed up man this this this this this whole thing has been cooped up from the very beginning this is insane hey man he's out there baptizing hey man he's out there and and now I mean John John's preaching a message to him Hallelujah and and he's and he's going he says repent ye for the king of Heaven is at hand the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand John the Baptist we have to hollering Orient generations of vipers who have warned you to flee the Wrath to come bring forth meat fruit for repentance amen and then all of a sudden Here Comes Jesus as he's now he's baptizing and then all of a sudden when he looked there at Jesus his heart began to throb amen and then the light comes down upon him he says behind the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world God fulfilling his word God the promise of all of the Old Testament was right there for a 30-year period you would think it would be 30 years of great celebration but it wasn't only the elect who was tied to the promise was going to stay with it come on now now only that elect that was tied to the promise the rest of the world didn't sit only a sixteenth of a sixteenth percent that even knew Jesus was on the Earth let alone believe him but that elect that had a predestinated anchor in their heart that was predestined it didn't matter what the world said it didn't matter what they said they knew the word had gave the promise and God was going to fulfill that promise well glory to God you see what I mean you anchor you anchor yourself to that promise oh praise the Lord amen anchor don't you don't you turn to the left or the right don't you look around amen and expect something else but you stand there upon the promises of God Amen are you hearing me stand upon the promises of God and then all of a sudden 30 years at three years of his ministry amen three years of his ministry he's Healing The Sick and he's casting out devils and and he's and he's doing these things let me let me let me just say this right here Amen in your situation sometimes God gets more Glory taking you through the trial than taking you out of the trial sometimes God receives more honor amen by being your anchor in the storm then he does when he speaks to the storm hallelujah amen hallelujah now the Volvo Pentecost now if if those three Hebrew boys were Pentecostals hallelujah amen that have been right there and they'd say Amen we we speak to that with that fire in the name of Jesus fire be put out and we curse the king in the name of Jesus and we'd be doing all of our prophesying and all of those kinds of things but you see Hallelujah there was an anchor that was going to hold them Hallelujah he gets more Glory can you say man hallelujah oh yes look at Joseph given the promise Joseph having that little something on the other on the other side Joseph was so predestinated he had no other choice but to go through Joseph had a soul that was so ordained of God his Destiny was so wrapped up in the word of God can you say Amen the footsteps of a good man are ordered of the Lord God foreseen God declared and God equipped Joseph for his birth before his birth can you say Amen amen he foreseen his jealous Brothers amen he foreseen the LIE from Potiphar's wife he he foreseen named man I went from the live part of his wife to being thrown in prison to being Forgot by the man who he had helped while in the prison hallelujah amen but God had already given the promise Joseph you're going to rain I want to tell you right now Satan may be beating you pulling you you know bringing you trying to bring you into lukewarm layout of see you this that and the other God has already got your name Amen in in Destiny it's already an infamy it's already declared it's already there Christ is there your name is in him you are engraved on the palm of his hand there's no way that you're going to move there's no way you're going to lose you are as predestinated as Joseph was predestinated then you say man yes that's right you're going to rain Joseph but there's going to be an interval there's going to be a delay and then that delay is going to be the testing of your faith but I want you to know no weapon formed against you is going to prosper because I have ordained it I have brought you out you are tied to me not because you tied yourself to me the ship is not a man the safe place the anchor is doing the job without the anchor the ship has no ability God gave you an anchor for your ship isn't cresting the waves the anchors causing you to stand solid today amen Moses life was ordained to be a deliverer now now now again going back to Joseph went for years and years and years and years and here comes Moses Moses life it was ordained to be a deliverer he was born a deliverer yet he lived as Pharaoh's son in the palace he was not a Slave at all Joseph was or Moses was not a Slave Hallelujah in fact he was in next in line to the throne now if you it just don't make much sense it don't make but yet the call to be the deliverer was in him and it drove him from the palace most of us are trying to get to the riches we're trying to get to the good job we're trying to get to the the easy way of life Joseph or Mars that's because of the call within him born with a silver spoon in his mouth had everything going for him next in line Moses forsook his riches to be a Slave Moses forsook his riches they're in they're in Hebrews 11 and 24 by faith Moses when you come to years when he come when he come to years somewhere around you know uh 12 13 years old I would I would say refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt Moses forsook it offers such because he found the anchor greater riches what good is it to have riches and no anchor what good is if God has predestinated you to be here on this Earth well praise the Lord not gonna hold you too much longer if God's predestinated you to be here on this Earth if these ordained you for a certain purpose and God's got that purpose for you then how are you going to be fulfilled except you fulfill the purpose blind Fanny Crosby when they were sort of making fun of her and saying you've you've written 8 000 songs all of these hymns and you act like you love God and he's been so bad to you you've got a gift and yet you you've got a gift there's no doubt about it you have got a gift if any Crosby we still sing some of her songs Fanny's Fanny Crosby will will forever be known as as as one of the top songwriters for him you've said you've wrote you and she didn't just listen she was a little blind lady who would be out there uh helping the poor the needy she would go to the orphanages this this little lady worked for for she was like a little evangelist this little lady just worked for God and she says and and these people would poke and see and yet God the one that you say is so great good good just like that and heal your eyes out of everything you've done for him he was just little Pinky and he could heal your eyes you you still will love him she says oh I will love him he's been good they said well what are you going to do how are you going to how are you going to know him when you get to heaven how are you going to know whether it's whether it's him what if you're still blind when you get on the other side he's had every opportunity to heal you here and he's not done it so how do you know you're even gonna have eyesight when you get to the other side Hallelujah and that's when she started singing the song I shall know him I shall know him I shall know him by the by Redeemed by his side I shall stand I shall know him I shall know him I will know him by the nail Prince in his hand she had a purpose she said she said if the Lord if you and and you kids that that have any of you kids read her biography read on Fanny Crosby I'd encourage y'all to read her read the book about her because it's really incredible but she said or in Providence that if he were to heal my eyes I would wander off from his will but the Lord has kept me blind so that I can fulfill his will she was in love with her purpose she was satisfied in her own skin she had a purpose that no one else could fulfill but her not my brother not my sister not my mama not my daddy I'm the only one that can fulfill that purpose it's Eternal representation and Glory it's predestination it's what God has called me to therefore I will glory in mine infirmities is what the Apostle Paul says I will glory why he had a purpose why why would the Apostle Paul they could come up to the Apostle Paul and say why would you still serve him two-thirds of your your your your Christian life has been in jail Paul says talk to them I I I I I don't know but maybe he would say something like this if I didn't have the time in jail I wouldn't have the time to write the letters which Wendell Martin down in 2023 will end up needing New Life Outreach down there in 220 2023 is going to if I am out they're not going to write down what I'm saying they didn't write down what he was saying but I guarantee you we still have what he wrote you know why because while all of the other apostles were out running all over the place preaching the gospel the Apostle Paul was chained in shackles the prophet of the first church age hahaha did not get to live free like everybody else would have been to his choice sure sure I mean yeah yeah he could have yeah I'm sure he could have done something differently I'm sure others could do things differently I but if God's called me for SF Moses be thankful for the purpose that God has given you and those intervals sometimes can get lonely and dark those intervals sometimes those delays sometimes can get can get can you say man now when I talk about the when I talk about darkness and and and and and and and gloomy I'm not talking about your heart being gloomy I'm not talking about that at all I believe I I believe that you can have your hands up in the air shouting and rejoicing and dancing right there in the middle of the fiery furnace I believe you can lay down amen and rest right there while the lions are all roaring all around you I I believe that if you're in your the will of God if you are there with a purpose why not be content why not be content instead of fighting against the anchor remember if you want that anchor enlarged you can go around just go the opposite direction of the purpose and before you know it your anchors loose I'm gonna I'm gonna just allow that anchor to hang on to me buddy I want that anchor at all oh praise the Lord can you say amen amen he see but but the Bible says but the Bible says they're in Hebrews 11 and 25 choosing rather to suffer reflection with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season estimating the reproach of Christ greater riches then all the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward Hallelujah he knew he was here for a purpose by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible there was a delay he he forsook it all and then the next thing we find on Moses he forsook Egypt he forsook the king I mean he he stood up and then it didn't work he come to deliver the people and it didn't work the next thing we know was Moses he's 40 years out in the desert all by himself as a fugitive Don't You Know The Enemy was just right there hey dim wit Palace and now you're out here with a woman that's mad at you all the time Hallelujah you're out here in this hot burning desert oh my goodness right 40 Years of delay and then all of a sudden a promise comes well praise the Lord are you following me so we're thankful for the delay be thankful when you're not feeling is pregnant you're not feeling like you're on top if you're called you have a purpose turn to your neighbor and say you have a purpose now if you're not resting in that anchor laughs I wish you would I don't want God don't want Christians so I just are flailing all over the place and there's ship going every which direction and being tossed way over there no no no no I'm sure you're gonna be going up and you're going to but but when you're anchored you're anchored can you say mine I'm anchored I'm here with purpose I've got his purpose so Joshua and Caleb the great generals of the faith of the Old Testament now they left Egypt thinking there's going to be three days journey from Egypt to the promised land what a glorious thing they were thinking we're going to be eating milk and honey in three days God's brought us out delivered us he's sold his mighty hand over here it's going to be wonderful three days journey we're going to be there we can fast that long and we'll get there we won't matter of fact we're going to hold our appetite we're not even going to eat nothing until we get on the others we believe God we believe it 100 there's milk there's honey there's a land of promise I'm looking forward to it 40 years later in the wilderness see God doesn't talk about the delays God doesn't talk about the intervals it's not going to be rational in fact most will not see it the way that God sees it and the believer sees it most will say serious most will say you're still believing God most will say huh and all of the to me on them because in the test and the delays where the test is but there were two that were still standing I'm sure they weren't fasting for 40 years they've probably gave in and decided to start eating a little bit but when they got to the other side they found the milk and the honey and they found the grapes and they found the pomegranates and they can you say man amen God was so honored that he said Joshua I'm going to put the spirit that I have on Moses I want to put it on you Caleb because you have a spirit that is different from everybody else I'm going to give my I'm going to give that land to you they're they're in in numbers 14 and 24 but my servant Kayla because he had another spirit with him and and have followed me fully him will I bring unto the land where unto he went and his seed shall possess it someone shot Hallelujah [Applause] praise the Lord the Bible says that the seals and and and and if uh well I was going to say if the musicians want to come but I am the musician unless brother Merle wants to play the guitar amen you can't play the piano amen or may or may or or sister Sharon or Karen says Karen might might have a uh since this Karen's a piano player too amen Rhodes brother Bo told me all about it amen but in this in this last day the the scripture says now get now catch this the scripture says that they're back in in the prophet John when he gave the Thunders and John was a the revelation of the Thunders and John was about to write it down John seen the Revelation John heard the Revelation John was fixing her write down what the Thunders uttered and then the Bible says the angel says seal it up seal it up you gotta wait till the time of the end but then the scripture says amen they're in in Revelations 10 and 5 an angel which I saw stand upon the scene upon the Earth lifted up his hand in heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the Earth the things therein are and the Sea and things there are in that there should be time no longer I looked up 15 different translations on this and and it and it and the the time is is not in any of them this is what they everyone say there will be no more delay so he is saying a man seal up the book but then there Comes A Time in these last days that the delay the opening of the book will will no longer be delayed but it will be known and then the very next verse in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets so there Comes A Time there's been a delay seal up the book it's not time for the first stage second age third age fourth age fifth age six age seventh age it's not it's not time it's not time but then the Bible says but when that seventh angel comes when that seventh messenger comes that church age Prophet comes then the time of delay will be no longer then the book is open the book is unsealed then the Bible says the next verse you put yourself in it and he says go take the book that is open in the hand of the Angel and eat that book the time of delay is no more now you're saying well what do you mean of delay it seems like he's been delaying his coming he's delaying his promise the whole church don't listen to me listen to me look at that look at the Grand scope of things we've went through 2 000 years of delay of showing those Thunders but here we have in this generation the promises of God Made Real to you why why is this important because it's in the evening time when Jew when when Israel was to leave Egypt that they were to take that lamb in the evening time and they were to eat that lamb and they were to have their shoes on they had the staff in their hand they had to take that blood apply it eat the lamb in order to go on that to go on the journey folks God has given us this open word apply that blood in this evening time eat that word in this evening time your faith is fixing to become sight something keeps pulling me what is it it's the anchor it's the one myth in the veil that is Pauling me we're that close to this rapture he's already there he's already there he sent this book the book is no longer delayed there's a delay you say ah huh but Brother winner I've been I've been waiting now for a long time keep hanging on that word is pulling you up higher I know he does all things three things as he descends but I want to say Christ never puts his foot on the earth so it's not him descending it's us ascending it's not it's not you're not going to see Christ you're not going to see Jesus here on the earth in the Rapture but you're going to ascend okay so if we're going to ascend and there's three phases in the rapture okay what's the shout the message you guys are scaring me that's the anchor that grabbed your heart brother Brandon says it's rapture it's the three stages of the rapture you become that word that you are eating take the book and eat it something keeps pulling me is that the right song oh holding me that ain't good I feel the pull something's pulling me something's pulling me it's pulling me it's taking me closer what's it doing it's rapturing the delay is over friends now I know we're waiting we're waiting for the finality we're waiting for the dead in Christ to rise we're waiting for the for the Trump of God when the dead in Christ rise and and and and and and we shall rise to meet him but I want to tell you it's happening right now the delay is no longer we're living in the time of Revelation where God is pulling us higher and higher and higher oh come on Church we're closer to don't let go of that anchor don't let that anchor loose amen The Anchor Holds though it tarries wait for it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound is that right amen oh my amen when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished praise the Lord as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again saying go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel with standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and Brethren now he told us what it was he told us he says now amen that little book that was that was open amen and he's telling us he goes now John is a type of the Bride John is a type of the Bride so now the there comes the time of delay is no longer Revelation is to be given now here we stand the word has come through the prophet now he's saying John you're the bride you go take the little book and you eat it up and because it's transforming something in you in the time of delay there's things behind the scene that is happening in the delay faith God's working on your faith in the delay when it seems like nothing's happened there was things taking place in the body of Jesus Christ from birth into 12 years old and from 12 years old to 30 years old there was like oh yeah there was a lot of things taking place he was he was still the word of God he was
