[33:19] nothing is better than you.
[33:27] You turn mourning to dancing.
[33:32] You give beauty for ashes.
[33:37] You turn shame into glory.
[33:40] You're the only one who can.
[33:47] You turn graves into gardens.
[33:52] You turn bones into armies.
[33:56] You turn seas into highways.
[34:00] You're the only one who can. You're the
[34:06] only one who can.
[34:09] [Music]
[34:10] There's nothing
[34:14] better than you. Oh, there's nothing
[34:18] better than you. Oh, there's nothing
[34:24] nothing is better than you.
[34:29] Lord, there's nothing
[34:34] better than you, Lord. There's nothing
[34:39] better than you. Oh, there's nothing
[34:44] nothing is better than you.
[34:53] [Applause]
[35:01] You
[35:03] made a way.
[35:06] [Music]
[35:08] When our backs were against the wall
[35:13] and it looked as if it was over,
[35:17] you
[35:19] made a way.
[35:22] [Music]
[35:25] And we're standing here
[35:28] only because you made. Singing now.
[35:32] Promise the man of God comes. You move
[35:34] mountains. Wo. You move mountains.
[35:40] You cause walls to fall with your power.
[35:47] You perform miracles
[35:51] and there's nothing
[35:55] that's impossible.
[35:59] And we're standing here
[36:03] only because you made
[36:06] a way.
[36:08] Can you just lift a hand and sing it
[36:10] now? Oh, you.
[36:12] Thank you, Lord.
[36:15] Yes, he did.
[36:18] When my back was against the wall
[36:22] and it looked as if it was over.
[36:28] [Music]
[36:34] And we're
[36:36] here.
[36:37] [Music]
[36:40] You made
[36:42] the way.
[36:46] You
[36:48] made a way.
[36:51] [Music]
[36:53] When our backs were against the wall
[36:57] and it looked as if it was all,
[37:02] you
[37:04] made a way
[37:07] [Music]
[37:09] and was standing here
[37:13] only because you made
[37:17] a way.
[37:22] Praise the Lord.
[37:28] [Applause]
[37:31] Let's go ahead and have you all open
[37:33] your Bibles and we'll turn to Jonah
[37:36] chapter 1.
[37:58] Jonah chapter 1 and we're going to be
[38:00] starting at verse 7.
[38:09] And they said everyone to his fellow,
[38:10] "Come and let us cast lots that we know
[38:13] may know for whose cause this evil is
[38:15] upon us." So they cast lots and the lot
[38:17] fell upon Jonah. And they said unto him,
[38:20] Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause
[38:22] this evil is upon us? What is thine
[38:25] occupation? And whence comest thou, and
[38:27] what is thy country, and of what people
[38:30] art thou? And he said unto them, I am in
[38:33] Hebrew, and I fear the Lord the God of
[38:36] heaven, which hath made the sea, and the
[38:38] dry land. Then were the men exceedingly
[38:41] afraid. And they said unto him, Why hast
[38:43] thou done this? For the men knew that he
[38:46] fled from the presence of the Lord
[38:48] because he had told them. And he said
[38:50] unto them, And they said unto him, "What
[38:52] shall we do unto thee, that the sea may
[38:54] be calm unto us? For the sea rot and was
[38:57] temptuous." And he said unto them, "Take
[38:59] me up and cast me forth into the sea. So
[39:02] shall the sea be calm unto you, for I
[39:05] know that for my sake this great tempest
[39:07] is upon you."
[39:09] Let's go ahead and pray.
[39:13] Lord Jesus, we come into your presence
[39:14] this evening, Lord. And Lord, I know
[39:18] that this probably seems like a little
[39:20] bit of an odd section to to read from
[39:25] from what we know of the story of Jonah,
[39:28] Lord. And Lord, I pray that you would
[39:30] just help to bring together the the
[39:33] thoughts and and what I've been
[39:36] contemplating and and studying and
[39:38] thinking on. Lord, may may you be the
[39:40] one that that brings everything
[39:41] together. Lord, may you be the one to to
[39:44] speak to the hearts of the people. Lord,
[39:45] I pray that you would just take control
[39:47] of of the vessel. Lord, help me to
[39:49] surrender myself, Lord. If there's
[39:50] anything that that I shouldn't say, I
[39:52] pray that you would block it away, Lord.
[39:54] And Lord, bring to my remembrance
[39:55] anything that maybe I didn't put in my
[39:56] notes, but that needs to be said this
[39:58] evening, Lord. May it just come forth
[40:01] and may it be a blessing to your people.
[40:03] Lord, we just commit the remainder of
[40:04] the service into your hands. In the name
[40:06] of Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. You
[40:08] may all have your seats.
[40:13] Now, I didn't read on from there, but we
[40:15] all know that Jonah was cast into the
[40:18] sea and
[40:20] the great fish that was specially
[40:22] prepared swallowed him up. And the next
[40:25] thing we have is Jonah sitting in the
[40:28] belly of the fish down at the bottom of
[40:31] the sea.
[40:34] And I can just see Jonah sitting there
[40:38] asking himself, "How did I end up here?"
[40:44] How often in our lives do we ask
[40:46] oursselfves that same kind of question?
[40:49] How often do we find ourselves in a
[40:50] moment where we're sitting there and
[40:51] we're going, "How did I end up here?
[40:56] How did I end up in this position? How
[40:59] did I end up in this situation? And how
[41:02] did I end up facing or dealing with
[41:05] whatever it is that I'm dealing with?
[41:09] Was it random chance? Was it because of
[41:13] someone else's action that I can be
[41:15] blaming? Was it because of my own
[41:18] decisions or my own poor choices?
[41:22] We have those moments that come
[41:24] throughout life. And as I was thinking
[41:26] about this, it
[41:28] made me think of Pilgrim's Progress. I
[41:31] don't I'm sure all of us have seen or
[41:34] read some version of it. Um I don't know
[41:37] how many have actually read the original
[41:40] Pilgrim's Progress. Probably most of us
[41:42] have seen the newer, a little more
[41:44] modern type versions. But there's one
[41:47] thing when you go back to to Pilgrim
[41:49] Progress and early on in the story,
[41:54] you have Christian as he's going along
[41:57] his way
[41:59] and he's been told to go to the small
[42:02] wicker gate that will put him on the
[42:06] straight path that'll take him to where
[42:07] he can be set free of his burden. And
[42:11] he's going along after he's talked to
[42:13] Mr. evangelist and he's he's going along
[42:15] and he meets a well-dressed man that
[42:18] tells him, "But that gate is so far
[42:20] away. There's this little town that you
[42:23] can go to that's a little bit that's
[42:25] much closer. It's less dangerous, safer
[42:28] road to travel. And there are skilled
[42:31] people there that can probably
[42:34] help you be free of your burden."
[42:37] And so Christian decides, hey, I'm gonna
[42:40] take the easier way and I'm going to go
[42:42] to this other place in order to find out
[42:45] if I can be free of my burden. And so he
[42:47] leaves the path that he's been set on
[42:50] and begins to take this other road
[42:52] that's supposed to take him to the city.
[42:55] And I want to just read a a small
[42:57] section from it.
[43:02] And so says, "So Christian turned out of
[43:05] his way to go to Mr. Legality's house
[43:08] for help. But behold, when
[43:12] he was got now hard by the hill, it
[43:14] seemed so high, and also the side of it
[43:17] that was next to the wayside did hang
[43:19] over so much that Christian was afraid
[43:22] to venture farther, lest the hill should
[43:24] fall on his head. Wherefore there he
[43:27] stood still, and knew not what to do.
[43:31] Also his burden now seemed heavier to
[43:33] him than while he was on his way. There
[43:36] came also flashes of fire out of the
[43:39] hill that made Christian afraid that he
[43:41] should be burned.
[43:43] Here therefore he sweat and did quake
[43:46] for fear. And now he began to be sorry
[43:48] that he had taken Mr. Worldly Wise Man's
[43:51] counsel.
[43:53] And with that he saw evangelists coming
[43:55] to meet him at the sight also of whom he
[43:58] began to blush for shame. So evangelists
[44:01] drew nearer and nearer, and coming up to
[44:03] him, he looked upon him with a severe
[44:05] and dreadful countenance, and thus began
[44:07] to reason with Christian.
[44:10] "What doest thou here, Christian?"
[44:12] Evangelist said, at which words
[44:15] Christian knew not what to answer.
[44:18] Wherefore at present he stood speechless
[44:20] before him.
[44:22] Then said evangelist further, "Art thou
[44:24] not the man that I found crying outside
[44:26] the walls of the city of destruction?"
[44:28] Yes, dear sir, I am the man. Did I not
[44:32] direct thee the way to the little wicked
[44:34] gate? Yes, sir, said Christian.
[44:37] How is it then that thou art so quickly
[44:39] turned aside? For thou art now out of
[44:42] the way.
[44:44] I met with a gentleman so soon that I
[44:46] got over the sloth of despond who
[44:48] persuaded me that I might in the village
[44:50] before me find a man that would take off
[44:53] my burden.
[44:55] Evangelist says, 'What was he? Christian
[44:58] said, 'He looked like a gentleman and
[45:00] talked much to me and got me at last to
[45:03] yield. So I came hither. But when I
[45:05] beheld this hill and how it hangs over
[45:07] the way, I suddenly made a stand lest it
[45:10] should fall on my head.
[45:15] Skipping down a little bit further,
[45:18] evangelist goes through and begins to
[45:22] correct him and begins to
[45:25] point out where Christian had gone
[45:28] wrong.
[45:32] And it was up at the top there when
[45:36] evangelist
[45:38] said, "What doest thou here Christian?
[45:44] what are you doing here? And even you
[45:46] can if you're imagining the scene and
[45:49] think about it, you can even see
[45:50] Christian as he's standing there and
[45:52] he's asking himself the same question.
[45:54] How did I end up here?
[45:56] How did I end up in a place where I'm
[45:58] now afraid to move? I'm afraid to to
[46:01] step forward. I'm afraid to step back.
[46:03] I'm afraid I'm going to be burned alive
[46:05] if I stay right here.
[46:08] And like we mentioned, Jonah in the
[46:10] belly of the fish going, "How did I end
[46:12] up here?"
[46:15] Now, there are times that we end up in
[46:18] these types of situations
[46:21] because of our own decisions,
[46:24] because of the choices that we made. We
[46:26] end up putting ourselves in places that
[46:29] we come back and then are sitting there
[46:31] going, "How in the world did I end up
[46:33] here?"
[46:37] And when we're honest, we have to go and
[46:39] say it's not because of
[46:42] what someone else did or not because of
[46:44] what someone else said or whatever it
[46:47] might be, but it's because I made this
[46:49] choice and I ended up here.
[46:53] And we sit there and
[46:56] all of us in our Christian walk have had
[46:58] those times when we have to admit that
[47:00] we're there because of our own choices.
[47:06] But there are other times when we can
[47:08] end up in rough situations. There are
[47:10] other times when we can end up in
[47:12] places.
[47:14] And it's not always going to be because
[47:17] we made a bad decision or because we
[47:21] fell into sin or because we made the
[47:23] poor choices. Yes, we have plenty of
[47:25] those in our lives. And I think every
[47:27] one of us would raise our hands and go,
[47:28] "Yeah, that's happened lots. There have
[47:31] been lots of moments where we sit there
[47:34] and we ask that question, how did I end
[47:36] up here? And we have to admit, it's
[47:38] because of our own fault. It's because
[47:42] of our own
[47:44] stinking flesh
[47:46] leading us down the wrong path, leading
[47:49] us to the wrong place, leading us to the
[47:53] wrong thing.
[47:57] Proverbs chapter 19 and verse 21 says,
[48:02] "There are many devices."
[48:04] Now, devices also translate into the
[48:08] word plans. There are many plans in a
[48:10] man's heart. Nevertheless, the council
[48:13] of the Lord that shall stand. We go
[48:17] through life all the time coming up with
[48:18] our own plans, our own thoughts on how
[48:22] we're going to get somewhere, where
[48:24] we're going to end up, what we're going
[48:26] to end up doing.
[48:28] Particularly when
[48:30] we're younger, we're looking at so much
[48:33] of life ahead of us. You're planning out
[48:35] this is going to be my career. This is
[48:37] the kind of person that I want to marry.
[48:40] This is the kind of house we're going to
[48:41] have. This is the kind of
[48:44] Go through the list.
[48:46] of what it was that you were dreaming
[48:48] about going, "This is what I'm going to
[48:51] be able to do." And then you get further
[48:53] along in life and you go, "How did I end
[48:56] up here?" Because that wasn't what that
[48:59] wasn't what I planned back there. That
[49:03] wasn't what I was thinking when I was
[49:05] 18. That wasn't what I was thinking when
[49:08] I was 21. That wasn't what I was
[49:09] thinking when I was 16. That wasn't what
[49:11] I was thinking whatever. But this is
[49:13] where I am. But that's not
[49:17] what I was dreaming. That's not what I
[49:18] was imagining. That's not the plans that
[49:22] I had set forth in my life.
[49:28] Genesis chapter 16,
[49:30] we're going to be pulling in a lot of
[49:33] familiar scriptures we go through. So,
[49:34] Genesis chapter 16, starting at verse 6.
[49:40] But Abram said unto Sarah, "Behold, thy
[49:42] maid is in thy hand. do to her as it
[49:45] pleasth thee. And when Sarah dealt
[49:47] hardily with her, she fled from her
[49:49] face. And the angel of the Lord found
[49:52] her by a fountain of water in the
[49:53] wilderness, by the fountain in the way
[49:55] to shore. And he said, Hagar, Sarah's
[49:58] maid, whence camest thou? And wither
[50:02] wilt thou go?
[50:05] In modern parlance, that's what are you
[50:07] doing here?
[50:10] Why are you here?
[50:14] What do thou hear?
[50:18] This isn't where you're supposed to be.
[50:20] So why are you here?
[50:24] And she said, "I flee from the face of
[50:27] my mistress, Sarah." And the angel of
[50:29] the Lord said unto her, "Return to thy
[50:31] mistress, and submit thyself under her
[50:33] hands." And the angel of the Lord said
[50:35] unto her, "I will multiply thy seed
[50:36] exceedingly, that it shall not be
[50:38] numbered for multitude." And the angel
[50:41] of the Lord said unto her,
[50:43] Behold, thou art with child, and shall
[50:45] bear a son, and shall call his name
[50:47] Ishmael,
[50:49] because the Lord hath heard thy
[50:50] affliction, and he will be a wild man.
[50:53] His hand will be against every man, and
[50:55] every man's hand against him, and he
[50:57] shall dwell in the presence of all his
[50:59] brethren. And she called the name of the
[51:01] Lord that spake unto her, Thou God
[51:04] seeest me. For as she said, have I also
[51:07] here looked after him that seeth me?
[51:14] We can end up in situations where we're
[51:16] asking the question, how did I end up
[51:18] here? And sometimes we can start to feel
[51:21] like
[51:24] God's forgotten us. God doesn't know
[51:26] where we're at. God doesn't know what's
[51:28] going on in our lives. God doesn't know
[51:31] what we're experiencing. God doesn't
[51:34] know the trials that I'm facing.
[51:38] And yet the scriptures remind us that
[51:41] he's the God that sees us. Whatever the
[51:44] situation, whatever we may be going
[51:48] through, whatever problems or challenges
[51:50] may be in our lives.
[51:54] Going to Job chapter 1 and verse 8
[52:00] says, "And the Lord said unto Satan,
[52:01] hast thou considered my servant Job,
[52:04] that there is none like him in the
[52:05] earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
[52:09] that fearth God and is a shoeth evil?"
[52:12] Then Satan answered the Lord, and said,
[52:14] Doth Job fear God for not? Hast not thou
[52:17] made an hedge about him, and about his
[52:18] house, and about all that he hath on
[52:20] every side? Thou hast blessed the work
[52:23] of his hands, and his substance is
[52:25] increased in the land. But put forth
[52:28] hand now, and touch all that he hath,
[52:32] and he will curse thee to thy face. And
[52:35] the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all
[52:37] that he hath is in thy power, only upon
[52:40] himself. Put not forth thine hand. So
[52:43] Satan went forth from the presence of
[52:45] the Lord.
[52:49] Job's another one that we can easily
[52:51] imagine. As he's
[52:54] sitting there in the ash heap, he's
[52:57] scraping the boils.
[53:00] I'd be willing to bet through his mind
[53:03] was going the question, "How did I end
[53:05] up here?"
[53:09] How did I end up in this position?
[53:14] Joe was there and
[53:18] in a lot of ways you can look at the
[53:19] situation with Hagar the same way. She
[53:21] hadn't done anything.
[53:25] She had done what she was commanded to
[53:27] do.
[53:30] She was the servant. She did what the
[53:32] mistress told her.
[53:36] And she's then out there going, "Why am
[53:38] I being treated badly? Why is this
[53:40] happening? What's going on?
[53:43] Job's sitting there scraping the boils
[53:45] and he's going, "How did I end up in
[53:46] this situation?"
[53:49] And yet in neither one of these
[53:50] situations are you looking at it and
[53:53] going, "Well, they have sinned and
[53:56] they're being punished for it."
[54:00] Now,
[54:02] we have, as I mentioned, plenty of those
[54:05] situations in our lives where we have to
[54:08] admit it's our fault.
[54:11] And yes, we're being punished because we
[54:14] made the decisions and we made the
[54:17] choices.
[54:19] But just because
[54:22] you're in a difficult place doesn't
[54:26] immediately mean
[54:28] that you're being punished for it. It
[54:31] doesn't immediately mean that you have
[54:32] made the wrong choices or done the wrong
[54:35] things. It can sure
[54:39] but it also could be God putting you
[54:42] through something.
[54:45] We've heard it so many times as
[54:47] different ministers will preach on Job
[54:49] and the fact that
[54:51] God could trust him enough to brag on
[54:55] him to Satan
[54:58] to go, "Have you considered my servant
[55:00] Job?
[55:04] Have you
[55:06] looked at him? Have you looked at the
[55:08] way he lives his life? Have you looked
[55:10] at how he carries himself?
[55:13] How he handles the different tests and
[55:16] how he handles the different situations
[55:17] that come along.
[55:20] And there are times in our lives where
[55:23] when you go into, okay, I'm going
[55:25] through a rough time. I'm going through
[55:27] the troubles.
[55:29] I need to do some self-examination.
[55:31] That is always the first place to start.
[55:35] When you're going through the trials,
[55:37] when you're going through the troubles,
[55:38] the first thing you do is look, okay,
[55:40] Lord, did I did I mess up?
[55:44] Is there something that I know in my
[55:45] heart I'm doing wrong that I need to
[55:48] confess that I now need to put before
[55:49] you
[55:53] step one.
[55:58] But if you go through and you're like,
[56:01] "No, Lord, I can have a clear
[56:02] conscience. I'm making the normal
[56:05] mistakes that happen, but there's not
[56:07] any pervasive sin in my life. There's
[56:10] not something that is continuing and
[56:11] over. It's just, well, Lord, that day I
[56:14] I lost my temper and I confessed I'm
[56:18] or this day I I did this thing, but it's
[56:20] not
[56:22] I'm still human, Lord.
[56:25] But overall, I can look at it and go,
[56:26] "Lord, there's nothing
[56:29] that's hanging around in my life that
[56:31] I'm going, I know this shouldn't be
[56:33] here.
[56:37] I don't have that pervasive sin, that
[56:40] possessing sin that's just staying in my
[56:43] life day after day, week after week,
[56:45] month after month."
[56:47] And then you do that examination. And
[56:49] then you're coming before the Lord
[56:50] going, "Okay, Lord,
[56:54] either what are you trying to teach me
[56:57] or where are you trying to direct me?
[57:02] Where are you taking me that I haven't
[57:04] thought about or I haven't imagined?
[57:08] It wasn't in my plan. Sure.
[57:14] But you have plans and you have a
[57:17] direction for my life.
[57:21] And you sit there and you're asking in
[57:23] the moment, how did I end up here?
[57:29] But now you're coming at it from a
[57:31] different angle.
[57:33] We've already cleared the fact, okay,
[57:34] I'm not here because of my own mess ups
[57:37] and screw-ups and my own stupid choices.
[57:40] So Lord, you have a reason for this. You
[57:42] have a purpose for this.
[57:44] You're allowing this to happen
[57:48] because you want to bring about
[57:51] something. You want to bring out a
[57:53] certain result from it.
[57:57] Isaiah 55
[58:00] verse 8.
[58:02] For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
[58:03] neither are your ways my ways, sayeth
[58:05] the Lord.
[58:13] The Lord will use
[58:17] these testing times to shape us.
[58:20] He'll be using these testing times to
[58:23] mold us. He'll be using these hard times
[58:25] that we're looking at going, "Lord, I
[58:28] don't see
[58:29] how I brought this on myself.
[58:32] I don't see how I made the mistake." And
[58:35] then it's all too easy for us in that
[58:37] moment to go into the self-righteous or
[58:39] woe is me or but Lord, why?
[58:45] This shouldn't be happening. I'm living
[58:47] right. I'm doing what I should.
[58:52] Instead of falling into, all right,
[58:54] Lord,
[58:55] your ways are not my ways.
[58:58] And you have a purpose for this. You
[59:00] have a reason for this. I may not
[59:02] understand it.
[59:04] I may not
[59:07] be able to see
[59:10] why,
[59:12] but yet you still have a purpose. You're
[59:15] still leading me somewhere.
[59:18] And Lord, I just need to trust you. I
[59:21] just need to
[59:23] fall on you for it.
[59:29] Exodus chapter 14
[59:33] and starting at verse one.
[59:38] And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[59:40] speak unto the children of Israel that
[59:42] they turn in a camp before
[59:45] by Heroth between Mdul and the sea over
[59:49] against Bale Zafon.
[59:53] Before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
[59:56] For Pharaoh will say of the children of
[59:57] Israel, "They are entangled in the land,
[1:00:00] the wilderness hath shut them in." And I
[1:00:03] will harden Pharaoh's heart that he
[1:00:05] shall follow after them. And I will be
[1:00:07] honored upon Pharaoh and upon all his
[1:00:10] host, that the Egyptians may know that I
[1:00:12] am the Lord." And they did so.
[1:00:19] Now, something I find interesting about
[1:00:20] this, and only recently has it stood out
[1:00:22] to me,
[1:00:25] is God tells Moses exactly what's about
[1:00:27] to happen.
[1:00:29] I had never really caught this in the
[1:00:31] story.
[1:00:33] But Moses wasn't surprised when Pharaoh
[1:00:36] showed up.
[1:00:39] God had already told him. Now,
[1:00:42] apparently, Moses didn't tell the
[1:00:43] people.
[1:00:46] Based on their reaction, they didn't
[1:00:48] know this was coming.
[1:00:51] But God had told Moses,
[1:00:54] he told his prophet, "I want you to camp
[1:00:56] here. I'm going to harden for Pharaoh's
[1:00:59] heart again."
[1:01:02] So, he's coming back.
[1:01:05] Pharaoh's coming after you again.
[1:01:09] Let's jump back in at verse 8. Exodus
[1:01:12] 14:8.
[1:01:15] And the Lord hardened the heart of
[1:01:16] Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he pursued
[1:01:19] after the children of Israel. And the
[1:01:21] children of Israel went out with an high
[1:01:24] hand. But the Egyptians pursued after
[1:01:26] them all the horses and chariots of
[1:01:28] Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army
[1:01:30] and overtook them in camping by the sea.
[1:01:34] We're not going to read those words
[1:01:35] again. Beside that place. And when
[1:01:37] Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of
[1:01:39] Israel lifted up their eyes. And behold,
[1:01:41] the Egyptians marched after them, and
[1:01:43] they were sore afraid. And the children
[1:01:45] of Israel cried out unto the Lord, and
[1:01:48] they said unto Moses, "Because there
[1:01:49] were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken
[1:01:51] us away to die in the wilderness?
[1:01:53] Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us
[1:01:56] to carry forth out of Egypt? Is not this
[1:01:58] the world the word that we did tell thee
[1:02:01] in Egypt, saying, Let us alone that we
[1:02:02] may serve the Egyptians. For it had been
[1:02:05] better for us to serve the Egyptians
[1:02:07] than that we should die in the
[1:02:09] wilderness.
[1:02:14] How did I end up here?
[1:02:17] You can see all the children of Israel
[1:02:18] asking that same question again.
[1:02:24] But in that moment as they're asking,
[1:02:27] "How did I end up here?" They're already
[1:02:30] willing to go back to where they were.
[1:02:34] their freedom now doesn't hold the value
[1:02:38] because now they're looking at it as
[1:02:40] well overcoming that or being set free
[1:02:42] from that was not worth the price that
[1:02:45] I'm paying now or the price that it
[1:02:48] looks like I'm about to pay.
[1:02:53] Sometimes we can run into that kind of
[1:02:55] mindset where God has given us a
[1:02:58] victory. God has set us free somewhere.
[1:03:03] But that brings about other challenges.
[1:03:06] That brings about other tests and other
[1:03:08] trials.
[1:03:10] And we can start to look back
[1:03:13] and go, maybe that wasn't so bad.
[1:03:18] And we're sitting there still asking the
[1:03:20] question, how did I end up here? Because
[1:03:22] back there looks better.
[1:03:28] There's so many ways that that question
[1:03:30] will crop up in our lives. How did I end
[1:03:32] up here?
[1:03:36] And the mindset that we take when we go
[1:03:39] into that question, the purpose behind
[1:03:41] the question very much affects how we
[1:03:44] move forward from there.
[1:03:46] Like I said, if we're going to ask that
[1:03:48] question,
[1:03:50] great way to start is the
[1:03:51] self-examination of, okay, did I do
[1:03:53] something wrong?
[1:03:55] Did I mess up somewhere and now I'm
[1:03:58] getting a spanking that I deserve?
[1:04:03] If that's not true,
[1:04:06] then there's a purpose. There's a reason
[1:04:09] for this.
[1:04:13] The Israelites were willing to look back
[1:04:15] and go,
[1:04:17] you know, I was better off a slave
[1:04:20] than possibly dying here.
[1:04:27] As they asked the question, how did I
[1:04:29] end up here? They were willing to go
[1:04:32] back to where they were
[1:04:35] because here was not valuable in any
[1:04:37] way.
[1:04:41] Dropping in at verse 13.
[1:04:44] And Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye
[1:04:46] not. Stand still and see the salvation
[1:04:48] of the Lord, which he will show to you
[1:04:51] today. for the Egyptians whom you have
[1:04:53] seen today, you shall see them again no
[1:04:55] more forever. The Lord shall fight for
[1:04:58] you, and you shall hold your peace." And
[1:05:01] the Lord said unto Moses, "Wherefore
[1:05:02] cryst thou unto me, Speak unto the
[1:05:05] children of Israel that they go forward?
[1:05:07] But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch
[1:05:09] out thine hand over the sea, and divide
[1:05:11] it. And the children of Israel shall go
[1:05:13] on dry ground through the midst of the
[1:05:15] sea. And I behold, I will harden the
[1:05:17] hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall
[1:05:19] follow them, and I will get me honor
[1:05:21] upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host,
[1:05:23] upon his chariots, and upon his
[1:05:25] horsemen. And the Egyptian shall know
[1:05:27] that I am the Lord, when I have gotten
[1:05:29] me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his
[1:05:31] chariots, and upon his horsemen.
[1:05:37] Israel thought they had the victory.
[1:05:40] They had left Egypt with all the spoils.
[1:05:43] They had come out feeling like they
[1:05:48] were on top that they had everything.
[1:05:53] But then all it took was the enemy
[1:05:54] poking its head back up for them to
[1:05:57] willing to wave the white flag. We'll go
[1:06:01] back into servitude. Forget the fact
[1:06:03] that we were victors. We're willing to
[1:06:05] go back that way.
[1:06:08] You know, brother Brandham talked about
[1:06:09] this
[1:06:10] when he would talk to us about
[1:06:16] how we would get our victory over
[1:06:17] healing.
[1:06:20] And he said the same thing that Satan
[1:06:22] likes to double down on his attack after
[1:06:24] we've received our victory.
[1:06:28] In the sermon of test me on the scene,
[1:06:29] brother Brandham's speaking. And it says
[1:06:35] after the prayer has been made over this
[1:06:37] demon disease that you've got and all
[1:06:40] sickness is of the devil and then when
[1:06:42] that prayer has been made it's
[1:06:43] impossible for it not to happen as long
[1:06:45] as you believe that it does happen. Now
[1:06:47] you go to doubting it when the unclean
[1:06:49] spirit gone out of a man. He walks in
[1:06:51] dry places. Then he returns back with
[1:06:52] seven other devils worse than he was at
[1:06:55] the beginning. Now people watch that.
[1:06:57] They said, "Oh well now I got worse.
[1:07:00] Now, wait a minute. If you haven't
[1:07:01] doubted,
[1:07:02] just hold on because it's like a tumor
[1:07:04] or something. It's a group of cells and
[1:07:06] them cells has got to die. The life in
[1:07:08] those cells, the cells rot, and the
[1:07:10] heartbeat has to pack that infection
[1:07:11] through the bloodstream. See, you get 10
[1:07:13] times worse than you were. But faith
[1:07:15] holds right there, no matter what takes
[1:07:18] place.
[1:07:23] Brother Random talks about that when it
[1:07:24] comes to physical healing. But I think
[1:07:25] that we can see that in other places of
[1:07:27] our lives, too, where we'll receive the
[1:07:29] victory
[1:07:30] and then things will flare up and seem
[1:07:34] like it's worse
[1:07:36] as we're being tested to see, are you
[1:07:39] going to hold on to it?
[1:07:43] You're going to sit there as it flares
[1:07:44] up and you're going to ask the question,
[1:07:45] "How did I end up here? It seems like it
[1:07:48] got worse."
[1:07:51] And you're going to have to answer and
[1:07:52] go
[1:07:55] either making the same choice that
[1:07:57] Israel did to go, I'm willing to go back
[1:08:01] because apparently I didn't get my
[1:08:02] victory. Apparently I didn't
[1:08:06] truly overcome. Apparently I didn't
[1:08:08] whatever.
[1:08:11] Or you're going to hold on to it in
[1:08:13] faith and go, "No,
[1:08:16] I won.
[1:08:19] God's given me the victory. You can't
[1:08:22] take it back. This is where I'm
[1:08:25] standing. This is what I'm keeping.
[1:08:28] Anyone looking at it from the outside,
[1:08:31] any great generals, anyone that looked
[1:08:33] at it from strategy would be looking at
[1:08:35] this going,
[1:08:37] "Well, whoever's leading Israel is
[1:08:40] stupid. They box them into a place where
[1:08:42] they can't escape. And now the Egyptians
[1:08:45] are going to sweep in and slaughter them
[1:08:47] and massacre them. It's all over.
[1:08:52] But God's thoughts are not our thoughts
[1:08:54] and his ways are not our ways. He
[1:08:57] doesn't work in the way that we look at.
[1:08:59] He doesn't work in the way that we call
[1:09:01] logical. He doesn't work in the way that
[1:09:03] always makes sense.
[1:09:05] Now, we know that God is a God that uses
[1:09:09] logic. 2 plus 2 equals 4. It always
[1:09:12] equals four. No matter what they may try
[1:09:15] to teach in new math or whatever, it
[1:09:17] always equals four. Period.
[1:09:21] And the fact that it's that way shows
[1:09:23] that God is a God of logic. He uses
[1:09:26] logic. He builds in rules. He builds in
[1:09:29] ways things work.
[1:09:31] But God can also work outside those. And
[1:09:34] God can work outside what we in our
[1:09:37] human minds think is logical
[1:09:40] because he's
[1:09:43] making us learn something or he's
[1:09:45] helping us learn something. He's helping
[1:09:47] us accomplish something that we wouldn't
[1:09:49] have thought of outside of that.
[1:09:55] First Kings chapter 19
[1:10:01] starting at verse one.
[1:10:08] And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah
[1:10:10] had done, and with all how he had slain
[1:10:13] all the prophets with the sword. Then
[1:10:15] Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah,
[1:10:18] saying, "So let the gods do to me, and
[1:10:21] more also, if I make not thy life as the
[1:10:24] life of one of them by tomorrow about
[1:10:26] this time." And when he saw that, he
[1:10:29] arose and went for his life, and came to
[1:10:31] Beersa, which belongth to Judah, and
[1:10:34] left his servant there. But he went, he
[1:10:37] himself went a day's journey into the
[1:10:39] wilderness, and came and sat down under
[1:10:41] a juniper tree. And he requested for
[1:10:44] himself
[1:10:49] that he might die. And said, "It is
[1:10:51] enough now, O Lord, take away my life,
[1:10:54] for I am not better than my father's."
[1:10:56] And as he lay and slept under a juniper
[1:10:59] tree, behold, then an angel touched him
[1:11:00] and said unto him, "Arise and eat." And
[1:11:03] he looked, and behold, there was a cape,
[1:11:05] bacon on the coals, and a cruise of
[1:11:07] water his head. And he did eat and
[1:11:09] drink, and laid him down again. And the
[1:11:11] angel of the Lord came again the second
[1:11:13] time, and touched him, and said, "Arise,
[1:11:15] and because the journey is too great for
[1:11:18] thee." And he arose and did eat and
[1:11:21] drink, and went in the strength of that
[1:11:23] meat 40 days and 40 nights unto Horeb,
[1:11:25] the mount of God. And he came thither
[1:11:28] unto a cave, and lodged there. And
[1:11:30] behold, the word of the Lord came to
[1:11:32] him, and he said unto him, "What doest
[1:11:35] thou here, Elijah?"
[1:11:44] Elijah had gone through and had his
[1:11:47] great victory. He had
[1:11:50] destroyed the prophets. He had proven
[1:11:52] that God was real. God was alive.
[1:11:57] God was the one that all should worship.
[1:12:02] And then he had had his Monday as
[1:12:04] brother Brandham talked about. And he
[1:12:07] fled into the wilderness and
[1:12:11] he's under the juniper tree. He's
[1:12:14] struggling.
[1:12:16] He's fed. God gives him food, gives him
[1:12:18] water, lets him sleep, and then he
[1:12:20] travels and he ends up in a cave
[1:12:25] and God comes to him
[1:12:29] and God's the one who asks him, "What
[1:12:32] doest thou here?"
[1:12:35] I'm sure Elijah was probably asking
[1:12:37] himself the same question. He was
[1:12:40] probably having that moment of going,
[1:12:42] "How did I end up here?"
[1:12:45] But now God comes to him and God's the
[1:12:49] one asking the question,
[1:12:51] "What are you doing here?"
[1:12:55] Same way that we saw back
[1:13:01] with Sarah's maidervant going,
[1:13:05] "So why are you here?"
[1:13:08] Now God comes to his prophet and he's
[1:13:10] asking the same question going, "Why are
[1:13:13] you here? Why are you in a cave in the
[1:13:15] middle of nowhere?
[1:13:19] Why are you here?
[1:13:24] Verse 10. And he said, I have been very
[1:13:27] jealous for the Lord God of hosts.
[1:13:30] For the children of Israel have forsaken
[1:13:32] thy covenant, thrown down thine altars,
[1:13:34] and slain thy prophets with the sword.
[1:13:37] And I, even I, only am left. And they
[1:13:40] seek my life to take it away.
[1:13:43] And he said, "Go forth and stand upon
[1:13:45] the mount before the Lord."
[1:13:48] And behold, the Lord passed by, and a
[1:13:50] great strong wind rent the mountains,
[1:13:52] and break in pieces the rocks before the
[1:13:54] Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind.
[1:13:57] And after the wind, an earthquake, but
[1:14:00] the Lord was not in the earthquake.
[1:14:02] And after the earthquake, a fire,
[1:14:05] but the Lord was not in the fire. And
[1:14:08] after the fire, a still small voice. And
[1:14:11] it was so when Elijah heard it that he
[1:14:13] wrapped his face in his mantle and went
[1:14:16] out and stood in the entering of the
[1:14:17] cave. And behold, there came a voice
[1:14:20] unto him and said, "What doest thou
[1:14:23] here, Elijah?"
[1:14:27] So the Lord's coming and he's asking him
[1:14:30] again,
[1:14:32] saying, Elijah,
[1:14:34] why are you here?
[1:14:39] Now, we don't look at this and think
[1:14:42] that God's asking this question because
[1:14:45] he hasn't been watching.
[1:14:49] He's not asking this question because
[1:14:52] he isn't already aware.
[1:14:56] This isn't like me walking into a room
[1:15:01] and finding someone unexpected there and
[1:15:03] going, "Huh? What are you doing here?"
[1:15:07] I'm asking because I don't know.
[1:15:11] That's why I would ask the question.
[1:15:15] God's not asking the question because he
[1:15:17] doesn't know.
[1:15:21] When God's asking this kind of question,
[1:15:25] he's inviting us into conversation.
[1:15:29] I don't especially after you read
[1:15:31] through how Brother Brandham talks about
[1:15:34] Elijah in this moment. I don't picture
[1:15:36] that God is coming in there and asking
[1:15:38] this in some accusing tone like, "Why in
[1:15:41] the world are you here? You're supposed
[1:15:42] to be over there working." You know,
[1:15:44] like some of the business owners might
[1:15:46] do with their employees. Why are you
[1:15:48] here when you're supposed to be over
[1:15:49] there?
[1:15:51] That's probably not how God approached
[1:15:54] it. when brother Brandham goes through
[1:15:57] and describes everything going with this
[1:16:01] and it's after the still small voice. So
[1:16:03] I can picture God coming in gently and
[1:16:05] just going
[1:16:07] Elijah why are you here?
[1:16:11] He's inviting him into conversation.
[1:16:13] He's inviting him into fellowship in
[1:16:15] that moment to go hey talk to me.
[1:16:20] Go ahead and vent a little. I'm giving
[1:16:23] you this opportunity
[1:16:25] to speak to me
[1:16:29] because he already knows what's
[1:16:31] happened. He knows the thoughts of our
[1:16:34] heart. He knows why Elijah's there. He
[1:16:36] knows what he's feeling. He knows what
[1:16:38] he's experiencing.
[1:16:40] He could have just come in and been
[1:16:42] like, "All right, Elijah, stand up. Let
[1:16:44] me tell you what you're going to do."
[1:16:47] But instead, he comes in. He goes,
[1:16:50] "Elijah, why are you here?
[1:16:56] Talk to me. Let's Let's converse for a
[1:16:59] little bit.
[1:17:01] I want you to share what's going on.
[1:17:04] Even though I already know it, I still
[1:17:06] want you
[1:17:08] to say it. I still want you to speak to
[1:17:10] me."
[1:17:13] Verse 14. And he said, "I have been very
[1:17:15] jealous for the Lord God of hosts,
[1:17:18] because the children of Israel have
[1:17:19] forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine
[1:17:22] altars, and slain thy prophets with the
[1:17:24] sword, and I, even I only am left, and
[1:17:27] seek thy life." And they seek my life to
[1:17:30] take it away. And the Lord said unto
[1:17:32] him, "Go, return on thy way to the
[1:17:35] wilderness of Damascus, and when thou
[1:17:37] comest, anoint Hazel to be king over
[1:17:39] Syria. And Jahu the son of Nimshi shalt
[1:17:43] thou anoint to be king over Israel. And
[1:17:45] Elisha the son of Chafhat of Abelam,
[1:17:49] yeah, shalt thou anoint to be prophet in
[1:17:52] thy room. And it shall come to pass that
[1:17:55] him that escapeth the sword of Haziel
[1:17:58] shall Jahu slay. and him that escapeth
[1:18:00] from the sword of Jahu shall Elisha
[1:18:02] slay. Yet I have left me 7,000 in
[1:18:06] Israel,
[1:18:07] all the knees which have not bowed unto
[1:18:09] Baal, and every mouth which hath not
[1:18:12] kissed him.
[1:18:25] What doest thou here, Elijah?
[1:18:28] Elijah's sitting here and in a lot of
[1:18:29] ways he's feeling like he's a failure.
[1:18:33] Yes, he had this great victory, but now
[1:18:35] they're out to kill him. He feels alone.
[1:18:39] He feels like everything that he's done
[1:18:42] up till now isn't actually worth
[1:18:44] anything. He hasn't accomplished
[1:18:46] anything. Even though he had this great
[1:18:49] victory, it didn't matter.
[1:18:53] And he's sitting here feeling alone and
[1:18:56] feeling rejected.
[1:19:00] And God comes down and invites him into
[1:19:02] conversation.
[1:19:04] Starts off with the question asking,
[1:19:08] "What doest thou here?
[1:19:10] What are you doing here? Talk to me.
[1:19:13] Tell me what you're facing."
[1:19:16] And then his response
[1:19:19] to talk to the prophet that feels alone
[1:19:22] and feels like he has no purpose.
[1:19:27] He says, "Here's your job. Here's what
[1:19:30] you're going to do next. You're going to
[1:19:32] go do this, this, and this.
[1:19:37] I'm going to give you purpose again."
[1:19:40] And you feel alone. So, let me just go
[1:19:42] ahead and tell you that you've got 7,000
[1:19:47] brothers and sisters that haven't bent
[1:19:49] the knee.
[1:19:51] You may not know all their names. You
[1:19:53] may not know
[1:19:56] all of their faces,
[1:19:58] but I do because I can tell you the
[1:20:01] precise number of how many there are.
[1:20:07] and you're going to at least know one
[1:20:09] name because I'm telling you, you're
[1:20:10] going to go anoint Elisha. He's going to
[1:20:13] be the prophet after you. And so, he's
[1:20:16] going to walk alongside you. He's going
[1:20:18] to be there with you for the next little
[1:20:21] while so that you're not walking alone.
[1:20:29] Elijah's
[1:20:31] in this moment when he's just sitting
[1:20:33] there and he's asking himself the
[1:20:35] question, "How did I end up here?
[1:20:39] You know, it's something that
[1:20:42] I have looked at through
[1:20:45] the Bible at different times and maybe
[1:20:47] at some point I'll preach on more of
[1:20:49] them. But
[1:20:51] when God asks questions,
[1:20:55] first off, let's start with the with
[1:20:58] admitting God doesn't have to ask
[1:20:59] questions. He already knows.
[1:21:03] So he never asks a question because he's
[1:21:06] trying to find out something or trying
[1:21:08] to gain knowledge.
[1:21:10] As humans, when we ask questions, most
[1:21:14] of the time it's because we don't know.
[1:21:18] However, how many times, particularly
[1:21:20] for all of us that are parents, how many
[1:21:22] times have we asked our kids a question
[1:21:24] already knowing the answer?
[1:21:30] You know, I'll go up to my son Paul and
[1:21:34] be like, "Paul, did you feed the dog
[1:21:36] breakfast this morning?
[1:21:38] I already know he didn't.
[1:21:42] I know he hasn't been anywhere near the
[1:21:45] dog's bowl.
[1:21:48] So, I'm not asking
[1:21:50] because I want
[1:21:52] information because I don't know.
[1:21:55] I'm asking to try to get him to go feed
[1:21:57] the dog.
[1:22:00] That's probably not actually the best
[1:22:01] way to approach it, but I'd be willing
[1:22:03] to bet most parents have done this where
[1:22:05] we go ask the question,
[1:22:08] "Have you done this? Have you seen this?
[1:22:11] Have you whatever?" And we already know
[1:22:14] the answer.
[1:22:17] Well, every time God asks, he already
[1:22:19] knows the answer.
[1:22:21] There are plenty of times I ask my kids
[1:22:23] questions because I don't know.
[1:22:25] and I'm trying to find out. There are
[1:22:27] plenty of times I ask people at work or
[1:22:31] around the church or ask friends or
[1:22:33] whatever. You ask them a question
[1:22:34] because you don't know something.
[1:22:37] But when God asks a question,
[1:22:40] it's always with a different purpose.
[1:22:44] He's not asking because he doesn't know,
[1:22:50] but he's asking
[1:22:52] to point out something or to pull us in.
[1:22:55] Or in this situation, like I said, I
[1:22:57] truly believe this was him inviting
[1:22:59] Elijah into conversation and into
[1:23:02] fellowship.
[1:23:05] He was going to his hurting prophet. He
[1:23:08] was going to the prophet that was
[1:23:09] struggling
[1:23:11] after he had just had his great
[1:23:13] victories
[1:23:16] and he was saying, "Hey, talk to me
[1:23:18] about it.
[1:23:21] Tell me what you're feeling.
[1:23:24] Tell me what you're facing. Tell me what
[1:23:25] you're dealing with."
[1:23:30] In the sermon Brother Brandon preached,
[1:23:32] "What doest thou here?" He says, "And
[1:23:35] Elijah was trying with a heart in him of
[1:23:38] God, trying to show the people that God
[1:23:39] was still God, and it had backfired on
[1:23:42] him, and he run out into the wilderness
[1:23:45] when he heard it. And there he laid
[1:23:46] under the juniper tree, trying to find
[1:23:48] consolation. He had sent his servant
[1:23:51] away and left him." Now, our story goes
[1:23:53] in three different places, one Mount
[1:23:55] Carmel, the next under the juniper tree,
[1:23:58] and the third place God meets him, he's
[1:24:00] in a cave. And it's very strange. pastor
[1:24:03] here knows and other ministers, watch
[1:24:05] after your Mount Carmels,
[1:24:07] you're going to have a juniper tree.
[1:24:10] Whenever a man has a blessing and the
[1:24:11] power of God pours down and does
[1:24:13] something for you, look out. Satan is on
[1:24:15] the track. Just remember the next day,
[1:24:18] that Monday, after a good day on Sunday,
[1:24:20] it's going to be a hard thing because
[1:24:22] he's going to do everything he can to
[1:24:25] knock that confidence out of you that
[1:24:27] the Holy Spirit instilled in you the day
[1:24:29] before.
[1:24:34] What is thou here?
[1:24:36] There are times in our lives where we're
[1:24:39] sitting back and we're having the
[1:24:41] self-reflection and we're going, "How
[1:24:43] did I end up here?"
[1:24:46] But there are times in our lives
[1:24:49] when God comes and he's talking to us
[1:24:55] and he'll be asking the question, "What
[1:24:57] doest thou hear?"
[1:25:00] He'll come up to you and go, "How did
[1:25:01] you end up here?"
[1:25:04] And you know, God can ask it in a lot of
[1:25:07] different ways.
[1:25:10] Sometimes he's asking and he's going up
[1:25:12] and going,
[1:25:15] "Brother Merl,
[1:25:17] how did a Baptist boy end up here?
[1:25:22] How did you end up
[1:25:25] getting out of that
[1:25:28] to go into the message
[1:25:31] and end up here in Ponyie?
[1:25:35] Sometimes God's coming into you asking
[1:25:38] that question to get you to start
[1:25:39] reflecting on the things that God's done
[1:25:41] in your life and how he's brought you
[1:25:43] through and what he's brought you to.
[1:25:48] Other times, God comes and is asking the
[1:25:50] question the same way he asked Elijah
[1:25:52] because he knows you're going through
[1:25:54] some struggles.
[1:25:56] He knows you're facing some challenges.
[1:25:58] And as you're sitting there down in the
[1:26:01] dumps, as you're sitting there like Job
[1:26:04] in the ash heap scraping your boils and
[1:26:07] God comes up and goes, "How did you end
[1:26:09] up here?
[1:26:12] Talk to me.
[1:26:15] How did you end up?" and you're
[1:26:17] struggling
[1:26:19] with the thoughts of mental oppression
[1:26:22] or depression or these different things
[1:26:25] going on.
[1:26:29] And brother Brandham said often that
[1:26:32] those with the greatest gifts are the
[1:26:35] ones that end up in that low place the
[1:26:37] most often.
[1:26:39] Those that have a gift in worship or
[1:26:43] have a gift
[1:26:45] singing or have a gift in ministry or
[1:26:47] have
[1:26:50] a gift in prayer, have a gift in this or
[1:26:54] that. When you have this gift that God
[1:26:57] is able to use
[1:27:00] and then
[1:27:01] you step away from his presence,
[1:27:06] you crash down lower,
[1:27:10] but yet God will still come back to you
[1:27:12] and go,
[1:27:13] "What are you doing here?
[1:27:19] How are you sitting here? What's going
[1:27:22] on?
[1:27:25] What is it that you're feeling right
[1:27:28] now?
[1:27:29] What are the thoughts that are running
[1:27:31] through your mind as you know, maybe
[1:27:33] like Elijah, you're sitting there going,
[1:27:36] I've failed.
[1:27:38] I thought that I had
[1:27:40] I thought that what I was doing
[1:27:42] mattered. I thought it was important.
[1:27:45] And now it seems like nothing I've done
[1:27:48] accounted for every anything.
[1:27:51] Now, it seems like
[1:27:53] nobody cares about me. I'm all alone.
[1:27:57] Nobody understands what I'm going
[1:27:59] through. Nobody understands what I'm
[1:28:00] facing.
[1:28:04] Lord, you may as well just kill me is
[1:28:07] what Elijah says.
[1:28:12] And yet, God will come to us in those
[1:28:14] moments and he'll invite us into
[1:28:17] conversation. He'll invite us in to
[1:28:18] fellowship. And maybe he doesn't use
[1:28:20] those exact words. Maybe he's not going
[1:28:21] in your heart. What are you doing here?
[1:28:26] But he'll come and he'll talk to you and
[1:28:30] he'll invite you back into the
[1:28:31] fellowship
[1:28:34] because we know that's what God is
[1:28:35] craving from his bride. That's why God
[1:28:38] created man in the first place.
[1:28:41] He created us for fellowship. He created
[1:28:44] us for relationship.
[1:28:46] Satan's the one who wants to separate
[1:28:48] it. Satan's the one who wants to cut us
[1:28:49] off. Satan's the one who wants us to
[1:28:52] feel like we're all alone and like
[1:28:53] nothing matters.
[1:28:57] But even in these struggles,
[1:28:59] even in the times when we're facing
[1:29:03] and we don't know how we're going to get
[1:29:06] out of the dark place.
[1:29:11] Elijah was in a cave
[1:29:15] and God comes to him and goes,
[1:29:19] "What doest thou here?"
[1:29:23] He'll invite us in our struggles. He'll
[1:29:25] invite us in those hard places to say,
[1:29:28] "Hey, let's sit down and talk."
[1:29:35] It's like when you go over to a family
[1:29:37] member's house and they're like, "Pull
[1:29:39] up a chair. Let's sit in the dining
[1:29:40] room. Let's Let's hash things out a
[1:29:43] little bit.
[1:29:46] I guarantee
[1:29:51] because I've seen it at least a few
[1:29:52] times.
[1:29:54] Brianna has gone over to her mom and
[1:29:58] dad's house and pulled out a chair and
[1:30:00] sat down and just started pouring out
[1:30:04] everything that she's been dealing with,
[1:30:06] everything she's been whatever struggles
[1:30:08] it might have been.
[1:30:13] I'd be willing to bet that there are
[1:30:14] times that Sister Mary has gone to her
[1:30:16] mom's house and pulled out a chair and
[1:30:18] sat down and started pouring out
[1:30:22] what she was dealing with or what she
[1:30:24] was facing.
[1:30:27] We have different ones that we'll go to
[1:30:31] and God is there inviting us into that
[1:30:33] same
[1:30:35] relationship to go, "Hey,
[1:30:39] I want you to talk to me."
[1:30:43] We go through these different situations
[1:30:44] in our lives where we sit there and we
[1:30:46] ask the question, "How did I end up
[1:30:49] here?"
[1:30:52] Like I said at the beginning, I start
[1:30:54] starting off with the most obvious of I
[1:30:56] messed up. That's how I ended up here.
[1:31:00] But there
[1:31:03] there are other times in our lives where
[1:31:05] we ended up in a place
[1:31:10] because God has a reason.
[1:31:13] God has a purpose. God has a plan.
[1:31:18] And maybe the purpose of the struggle is
[1:31:21] simply
[1:31:23] because God wants you to sit down and
[1:31:25] talk to him a little more.
[1:31:30] Maybe we just need to be slowed down a
[1:31:32] little bit
[1:31:34] so that we're willing to sit down in
[1:31:36] that chair and have a chat
[1:31:39] instead of being so busy with life,
[1:31:42] instead of being so busy with everything
[1:31:44] that's going on around us.
[1:31:49] What doest thou here?
[1:31:54] Romans chapter 8 verse 28. And we know
[1:31:57] that all things work together for good
[1:31:58] to them that love God, to them who are
[1:32:01] called according to his purpose.
[1:32:09] Everything that we're going through
[1:32:11] life, every struggle, every problem,
[1:32:17] there's a reason and there's a purpose.
[1:32:21] And it may be the purpose is simply for
[1:32:24] our perfecting because God's putting us
[1:32:26] through things in order to shape us, in
[1:32:29] order to bring us to that state of
[1:32:31] perfection that he wants from his bride
[1:32:34] and from his people.
[1:32:38] But there are other times when he's
[1:32:40] bringing it bring us through something
[1:32:42] because he's trying to direct us
[1:32:44] somewhere.
[1:32:48] Maybe he's trying to teach us something
[1:32:50] that then we'll be able to share with
[1:32:51] someone else down the road
[1:32:54] that we'll be able to connect with them
[1:32:56] because hey, I've been there. I've sat
[1:33:00] in that same spot. I've sat on that same
[1:33:03] ash heap. I've been in that same cave
[1:33:06] when God came and spoke to me and said,
[1:33:09] "What doest thou here?"
[1:33:17] It doesn't always have to. It's not
[1:33:20] always because we messed up. Even though
[1:33:22] that may be a lot of the time in our
[1:33:25] lives,
[1:33:27] but there are the other times
[1:33:30] and I think this one stands out just so
[1:33:32] beautiful that God would come to his
[1:33:34] prophet
[1:33:38] and like I said there's nowhere there's
[1:33:40] no quote I can say for this. There's no
[1:33:43] corresponding scripture where I go this
[1:33:45] absolutely says that I am completely
[1:33:46] right in my belief. But as I read
[1:33:49] through the story and I'm imagining, I'm
[1:33:50] looking at I'm going, "This is God
[1:33:53] inviting him into fellowship, into
[1:33:56] relationship."
[1:33:57] Because he knew the answer. He knows why
[1:34:00] he's there.
[1:34:02] And he's speaking to him out of a still
[1:34:05] small voice. He's not speaking to him
[1:34:08] out of the thunder. So he's not yelling
[1:34:11] at him. He's not roaring at him. He's
[1:34:12] not He's speaking to them out of the
[1:34:15] still small voice
[1:34:17] to his wounded, hurting prophet.
[1:34:24] So often we go through those moments
[1:34:26] where we're the wounded in the hurting.
[1:34:30] We feel like
[1:34:32] we're alone. We feel like
[1:34:35] we don't have a purpose. We feel like
[1:34:39] we've messed everything up.
[1:34:42] Why did God even make me? Why am I even
[1:34:45] here?
[1:34:47] Why did God allow me to be born?
[1:34:54] And God comes and he's wanting to talk
[1:34:57] to us. He's wanting to remind us
[1:35:00] that our ultimate purpose
[1:35:03] is the relationship with him.
[1:35:07] You know, we may not have the purpose
[1:35:09] that we're going to end up being the
[1:35:11] president of the United States or we're
[1:35:13] going to end up being the CEO of some
[1:35:15] big corporation or we're going to end up
[1:35:18] being, you know, have our our name up in
[1:35:20] lights and everybody knows us or, you
[1:35:23] know, we'll even go smaller, being the
[1:35:24] mayor of a city or whatever
[1:35:28] that, you know,
[1:35:30] we could end up being your career is
[1:35:34] you're a janitor for your entire life or
[1:35:37] you're the garbage man for your entire
[1:35:38] life or you're working in the post
[1:35:41] office your entire life.
[1:35:46] You could end up being one of those that
[1:35:47] a lot of people would probably look down
[1:35:49] on
[1:35:51] as one of those ah that's that's one of
[1:35:54] those menial type positions.
[1:35:58] Or you could have spent most of your
[1:35:59] life working in fast food.
[1:36:07] But yet God's main purpose for us, for
[1:36:10] every one of us,
[1:36:12] and all you kids on the front row
[1:36:14] especially,
[1:36:16] listen to this because this is something
[1:36:17] that you're going to need to hold on to
[1:36:20] as you're going through life
[1:36:23] is your main purpose.
[1:36:27] Your main reason for being born, your
[1:36:29] main purpose, your main reason for being
[1:36:32] here
[1:36:34] is because God wants a relationship with
[1:36:37] you.
[1:36:40] God wants to talk to you.
[1:36:48] It's not anything the world looks at and
[1:36:50] we go, "Wow, it's so amazing."
[1:36:53] It's not anything the world will look at
[1:36:55] and go, "They're so talented. They're so
[1:37:01] wealthy. They're so this, that, or the
[1:37:04] other."
[1:37:06] And God could still give some of you
[1:37:09] some type of position that puts you
[1:37:12] in lights in some way. That's up to him.
[1:37:16] But even if he does, that's not your
[1:37:19] main purpose.
[1:37:21] That's not your main reason for being
[1:37:23] here.
[1:37:25] Your main reason for being here isn't
[1:37:27] because of your spouse. Your main reason
[1:37:29] for being here isn't because of your
[1:37:31] kids.
[1:37:35] Your main reason for being here
[1:37:38] is to have the relationship with God
[1:37:42] and to have that fellowship and that
[1:37:45] relationship back and forth.
[1:37:48] And in the times when we're struggling,
[1:37:50] in the times when we're hurting,
[1:37:52] God will come in and he will invite us
[1:37:55] back into it. When we're feeling like
[1:37:58] we're alone,
[1:38:00] when we're feeling like we can't take
[1:38:04] the struggles,
[1:38:10] Sister F, when you feel like you're
[1:38:12] going crazy,
[1:38:16] he'll still come in.
[1:38:18] and he'll be inviting you back going,
[1:38:21] "Talk to me.
[1:38:25] Tell me about your struggles."
[1:38:33] Brother Colby, in your darkest times,
[1:38:37] he comes in.
[1:38:39] He says, "Hey, talk to me."
[1:38:42] He says, "What are you doing here?
[1:38:47] And he knows why you're there.
[1:38:51] He knows what brought you to that place.
[1:38:54] Whether it was his leading,
[1:38:57] whether it was your own stupidity,
[1:39:00] he knows why you're there.
[1:39:03] But he still invites you
[1:39:06] into relationship. He invites you into
[1:39:09] that conversation
[1:39:11] because he's not leaving you behind.
[1:39:16] He's not leaving you alone.
[1:39:20] He's calling you back in.
[1:39:28] Brother Brandham says that sermon,
[1:39:32] "What doest thou here?"
[1:39:34] after he goes through and brother
[1:39:36] Brandham's expressing the whole story
[1:39:39] and he's talking through all the
[1:39:40] different steps and what Elijah was
[1:39:44] dealing with and what it's like for a
[1:39:47] minister for different ones and then he
[1:39:49] comes through
[1:39:56] paragraph 112 and what doest thou hear?
[1:40:01] Brother Brandham says, "And when Elijah
[1:40:03] heard that still small voice,
[1:40:08] nothing bothered him."
[1:40:14] God comes and he speaks to you out of
[1:40:16] the still small voice. He invites you
[1:40:19] back in to conversation, back into
[1:40:22] fellowship.
[1:40:26] And that's the moment
[1:40:30] when you can let all the cares slip
[1:40:32] away.
[1:40:34] When he speaks to you from the still
[1:40:37] small voice,
[1:40:39] nothing bothers you anymore
[1:40:43] because he's now shutting you away. He's
[1:40:45] now bringing you in and drawing you
[1:40:47] close and speaking to you
[1:40:52] and all the rest doesn't matter.
[1:40:55] as the musicians come.
[1:41:00] What doest thou hear?
[1:41:03] Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 says, "For
[1:41:07] I know the thoughts that I think toward
[1:41:08] you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace
[1:41:11] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:41:14] end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye
[1:41:17] shall go and pray unto me, and I will
[1:41:20] hearken unto you, and ye shall seek me
[1:41:22] and find me when you shall search for me
[1:41:25] with all your heart.
[1:41:29] Matthew chapter 25 and verse 21.
[1:41:34] The parable of the talents,
[1:41:37] his lord said unto him, well done, thou
[1:41:40] good and faithful servant.
[1:41:42] Thou has been faithful over a few
[1:41:44] things.
[1:41:46] I will make thee ruler over many things.
[1:41:49] Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.
[1:41:56] We have those moments in our life where
[1:41:59] we're sitting down and
[1:42:02] we're asking that question,
[1:42:05] how did I end up here?
[1:42:07] How did I end up in this spot? How did I
[1:42:09] end up in the middle of this struggle or
[1:42:13] this situation?
[1:42:14] How did I end up so far away from what I
[1:42:17] had imagined or what I had planned or
[1:42:20] what I had dreamed?
[1:42:25] And after we go through
[1:42:28] confessing and dealing with anything
[1:42:30] where we have to admit that it was our
[1:42:33] poor choices, our poor decisions, our
[1:42:37] sin that led us to a spot. Once we've
[1:42:40] dealt with all that, once that's all
[1:42:42] under the blood, we've confessed, we've
[1:42:44] laid aside all of those,
[1:42:47] and now we're laying here,
[1:42:51] and God's there to speak to us
[1:42:54] in the midst of our trial, in the midst
[1:42:57] of our struggle, in the midst of the
[1:42:59] dark places,
[1:43:02] God comes in and
[1:43:05] invites us back
[1:43:07] into fellowship, invites us into
[1:43:10] conversation.
[1:43:12] He doesn't come and ask the questions
[1:43:13] because he's been on a journey and
[1:43:15] doesn't know what we've been doing or
[1:43:18] because he's been sleeping and doesn't
[1:43:20] know what's happening using the things
[1:43:22] that Elijah taunted the other priests
[1:43:25] with.
[1:43:26] But he's fully aware. He knows what
[1:43:29] we're struggling with. He knows what
[1:43:31] we're facing. And he comes and he speaks
[1:43:33] to us because he wants to talk.
[1:43:38] because he wants us to pour out our
[1:43:40] heart to him. He wants us to pour out
[1:43:44] our struggles to him. He wants us to
[1:43:47] pour out our hopes and our dreams. And
[1:43:52] yes, he wants to pour out our plans.
[1:43:56] Even though it's not going to happen
[1:43:57] that way, he wants us to share with him
[1:44:01] and he wants to speak back to our heart.
[1:44:05] And whether that's he's speaking back
[1:44:08] directly to our heart. Whether it's he's
[1:44:10] speaking to us through the scriptures,
[1:44:12] whether it's he's speaking to us through
[1:44:15] a prophet's message, or whether he's
[1:44:16] speaking to us
[1:44:18] through a text that a brother or sister
[1:44:20] sent you,
[1:44:24] he's inviting us into communion.
[1:44:28] He's inviting us into relationship.
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:34] God doesn't ask questions lightly.
[1:44:38] He doesn't go through in the scriptures
[1:44:40] and ask questions for no reason.
[1:44:44] It's the same thing when people talk
[1:44:45] about if God says something multiple
[1:44:48] times and we should pay attention.
[1:44:51] Well, if God's asking a question when
[1:44:52] he's already the all- knowing, allseeing
[1:44:56] God,
[1:44:59] then we should probably pay attention to
[1:45:00] the question and probably pay attention
[1:45:03] to why he's asking it.
[1:45:06] What doest thou here?
[1:45:10] Let's all bow our heads.
[1:45:13] [Music]
[1:45:17] Lord Jesus, you brought each of us
[1:45:20] to this place along the journey for a
[1:45:23] reason.
[1:45:25] Lord, you've brought us each to this
[1:45:28] moment of time
[1:45:30] for a purpose.
[1:45:33] And Lord, maybe we don't understand
[1:45:36] where we're going. Maybe we don't
[1:45:38] understand
[1:45:40] exactly where you want us to end up at.
[1:45:46] But Lord, we can trust you that you're
[1:45:47] directing us, Lord. That you're in
[1:45:50] control, that you're that you have the
[1:45:53] plans for our lives, Lord. And that your
[1:45:56] ways are so much better than our ways,
[1:45:58] and your thoughts are so much better
[1:46:00] than our thoughts.
[1:46:03] Lord, I pray that you would help us just
[1:46:05] to take a moment right now, Lord, to
[1:46:09] have that conversation with you, Lord.
[1:46:15] Lord, maybe we've fallen into the trap
[1:46:17] of
[1:46:20] just the generic prayers of Lord, I lay
[1:46:23] me down to se sleep and bless this food.
[1:46:26] Amen.
[1:46:28] Maybe we've fallen into the trap of
[1:46:31] being so busy that we're not
[1:46:37] truly entering into fellowship with you.
[1:46:42] And Lord, on this Sunday night, Lord,
[1:46:44] when
[1:46:46] we're away from the world for a little
[1:46:47] bit, Lord, and we're in the quiet and
[1:46:52] we don't need to be caught up in
[1:46:54] concerns for
[1:46:58] Oh, I've got to get to this store,
[1:47:01] finish this errand or do this or do
[1:47:03] that,
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:06] but Lord, right now just to come into
[1:47:07] your presence and
[1:47:12] and just speak with you, Lord, and just
[1:47:15] share what's going on in our hearts.
[1:47:19] Just share what we're feeling,
[1:47:24] Lord. those that weren't able to to be
[1:47:26] here tonight, that weren't feeling well,
[1:47:29] that are at home streaming, Lord Jesus.
[1:47:34] Lord, I pray right now that you would
[1:47:35] give
[1:47:38] them the a few moments of quiet, Lord,
[1:47:42] that you would allow them to enter into
[1:47:43] that same place where they can hear your
[1:47:46] voice, Lord, and they can speak back to
[1:47:49] you, Lord, as you invite them into
[1:47:51] conversation, invite them into
[1:47:54] relationship, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:01] Lord, we thank you for directing our
[1:48:03] lives. Lord, we thank you for for not
[1:48:06] letting our plans run the course that we
[1:48:09] might have wanted.
[1:48:12] Lord, we thank you for correcting us
[1:48:13] when we need correction. And
[1:48:16] Lord, we thank you that there are times
[1:48:17] in our lives where you just trusted us
[1:48:19] enough to send the trial our way.
[1:48:25] Lord, thank you for
[1:48:28] everything that you do for us, Lord.
[1:48:32] Lord, I don't want to pass by this
[1:48:34] opportunity, Lord, to to remember our
[1:48:37] pastor that's out traveling, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:41] Lord, I pray that you would just bless
[1:48:44] him while he's
[1:48:46] up north, Lord Jesus. That you would
[1:48:49] give him traveling mercies on the way
[1:48:50] home, Lord.
[1:48:52] that Lord, you would strengthen him and
[1:48:54] that you would
[1:48:58] lift him back up, Lord, as he's been
[1:49:01] feeling tired and weary himself, Lord.
[1:49:05] Lord, may you meet him. May you
[1:49:10] take a few moments, Lord, to to speak to
[1:49:13] your tired servant for a little bit,
[1:49:16] Lord. May you just bless him in a
[1:49:18] special way.
[1:49:24] Lord, we commit the week ahead in your
[1:49:27] hands, Lord, and pray that you would
[1:49:29] help us not to to lose sight of
[1:49:33] of our relationship with you, Lord. Help
[1:49:35] us not to get so caught up in the
[1:49:38] busyiness of life and the deadlines and
[1:49:42] the the things that have to be done that
[1:49:44] we have to take care of.
[1:49:48] Well, Lord, help us always be willing to
[1:49:50] slow down, Lord, to to take that moment
[1:49:53] just to to speak to you, Lord.
[1:50:00] Thank you for loving us, Lord. Thank you
[1:50:02] for wanting to
[1:50:05] to be in conversation with us. Thank you
[1:50:08] for wanting to
[1:50:10] to have the relationship with us, Lord.
[1:50:17] Lord, we just thank you for all that you
[1:50:19] do for us. Lord,
[1:50:22] we just worship you right now, Lord
[1:50:24] Jesus.
[1:50:28] [Music]
[1:50:38] Come by here.
[1:50:46] Come by here
[1:51:03] by
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:13] you, Lord.
[1:51:18] Come by here.
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:25] I really need
[1:51:28] you, Lord.
[1:51:33] Come by here.
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:41] I really need
[1:51:44] you, Lord.
[1:51:47] [Music]
[1:51:49] Come by here.
[1:51:53] [Music]
[1:51:56] Oh
[1:51:58] Lord,
[1:52:04] come by.
[1:52:11] Oh, come by him
[1:52:15] alone.
[1:52:19] Come by him.
[1:52:27] Come by him,
[1:52:30] my Lord.
[1:52:35] Come by here.
[1:52:39] [Music]
[1:52:42] Come by him, my Lord.
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:50] Come by him,
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:52:58] oh
[1:53:00] Lord.
[1:53:05] Come by here.
[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:24] [Music]
[1:53:33] Lord,
[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:37] come
[1:53:39] here.
[1:53:41] [Music]
[1:53:44] Oh, come by here.
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:52] Come by here.
[1:54:00] Oh
[1:54:01] [Music]
[1:54:08] mighty.
[1:54:15] Sometimes God just
[1:54:20] calls us into the quiet to
[1:54:23] just talk to him for a little bit.
[1:54:29] Sometimes he just wants you to,
[1:54:32] you know, sometimes he wants us just not
[1:54:33] to
[1:54:35] rush out of service quite so fast. Just
[1:54:39] enjoy being
[1:54:41] in his presence. Enjoy
[1:54:45] worshiping him. Enjoy
[1:54:48] talking to him. Enjoy listening to what
[1:54:52] he's saying to your spirit, to your your
[1:54:55] heart.
[1:54:58] A lot of times we're
[1:55:01] especially after morning service, we're
[1:55:03] rushing off to get to lunch. We're
[1:55:04] rushing off to, you know, Wednesday
[1:55:06] night, we're rushing to get home because
[1:55:08] we got work the next day and it's late.
[1:55:14] You know,
[1:55:17] years that I've been here, I've
[1:55:19] to me I've seen it seems like Sunday
[1:55:21] night always seems to be a little bit
[1:55:23] special.
[1:55:25] I know there are a lot of churches that
[1:55:27] have gone to only one service and I'll
[1:55:29] be the first one to admit. There are
[1:55:31] plenty of days where it would be nice to
[1:55:33] only have one service and get to just
[1:55:34] rest at home. But with those Sunday
[1:55:37] evenings when we're not rushing off so
[1:55:40] much because it's not so late that we
[1:55:43] have to get to bed for work the next
[1:55:45] day. It's not rushing off for the meal
[1:55:47] and we're not doing this that the other.
[1:55:49] We're just letting
[1:55:51] the spirit hover a little bit. We're
[1:55:53] just willing to sit in his presence and
[1:55:56] just let him speak to us.
[1:56:00] Those are the moments that the Lord can
[1:56:03] do something. And it doesn't mean that
[1:56:04] we need to be up at the altar weeping.
[1:56:06] It doesn't mean that we need to be
[1:56:09] going up and getting prayed for, but in
[1:56:12] the pew, just being willing to be in his
[1:56:15] presence
[1:56:17] and just being willing to stay in his
[1:56:19] presence and let him speak.
[1:56:25] So, tonight I'm going to do something a
[1:56:26] little bit different, but Colby is just
[1:56:29] going to keep playing.
[1:56:32] Y'all are able to dismiss yourselves
[1:56:34] when you're ready.
[1:56:38] Take a few moments. Just talk to the
[1:56:40] Lord.
[1:56:43] Go when you feel you need to go. Stay if
[1:56:48] you need to stay.
[1:56:51] [Music]
[1:56:53] Lord bless you all.
[1:56:59] [Music]
[1:57:08] Lord
[1:57:12] [Music]
[1:57:22] Jesus, I love
[1:57:27] you.
[1:57:31] I couldn't imagine.
[1:57:39] [Music]
[1:57:46] [Music]
[1:57:52] [Music]
[1:57:59] Because I've been so faithful.
[1:58:04] Because I've been so good. Oh my
[1:58:09] [Music]
[1:58:13] to provide my
[1:58:17] youon.
[1:58:22] You were there through all my pain.
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:27] God in my footsteps
[1:58:31] through the shelter from the rain.
[1:58:34] [Music]
[1:58:37] It was you
[1:58:39] [Music]
[1:58:40] made my life.
[1:58:44] You are
[1:58:46] my
[1:58:55] Jesus. I love you.
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:59:03] I couldn't imagine
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:15] [Music]
[1:59:25] if you weren't There
[1:59:29] you are. The joy of my salvation.
[1:59:34] You're the peace in my store.
[1:59:40] Love arms protect. Yes, it does. You sh
[1:59:44] me from harm.
[1:59:47] You're the
[1:59:50] omega,
[1:59:52] the beginning and the end.
[1:59:55] [Music]
[1:59:57] my strong tower.
[2:00:00] You're my dearest and best friend.
[2:00:06] It was you
[2:00:09] who made my life.
[2:00:13] You are
[2:00:15] my
[2:00:24] Jesus. I love you. Can you say that now?
[2:00:28] Because you cared. Yes.
[2:00:32] I couldn't imagine
[2:00:36] if you weren't there.
[2:00:40] Oh Jesus, I love you
[2:00:45] because you care.
[2:00:49] I couldn't imagine
[2:00:54] you were there. Jesus, I love you. Oh
[2:00:58] Jesus, I love you. I love you.
[2:01:02] Jesus, I love you. I love you.
[2:01:06] Jesus, I love you. I love you.
[2:01:11] [Music]
[2:01:15] Oh Jesus, I love you. I love you. Jesus,
[2:01:20] I love I love
[2:01:24] [Music]
[2:01:29] you.
[2:01:32] Oh Jesus, I love you.
[2:01:41] I could imagine
[2:01:45] you weren't there.
[2:01:49] Oh Jesus, I love you.
[2:01:58] I could imagine
[2:02:02] you were there. Can we do that verse one
[2:02:06] again? Not because
[2:02:10] this is me.
[2:02:17] [Music]
[2:02:21] provide my need.
[2:02:25] You were there when I was lonely.
[2:02:29] You were there through all my pain.
[2:02:35] God in my footsteps
[2:02:38] through the shelter from the rain.
[2:02:44] It was you
