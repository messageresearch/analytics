[29:40] [music] spirit lives within me. So I
[29:45] will walk in [singing and music] your
[29:46] peace. Your spirit lives within me. My
[29:51] victory. [music and singing] My victory.
[29:58] Hallelujah. [singing]
[30:00] I [music]
[30:02] &gt;&gt; am not alone. [singing]
[30:05] Sing him with all your heart. As the man
[30:07] of God comes.
[30:09] Oh,
[30:11] and he's [music and singing] my comfort.
[30:15] Oh,
[30:16] he holds. Oh, let's sing that first
[30:19] [music] verse again.
[30:23] The Lord is my shepher. [music]
[30:31] He goes before [singing]
[30:34] me,
[30:38] defender [music] behind. [singing]
[30:45] He casts [singing] out [music] all fear.
[30:52] I'm [music] filled with anointing.
[30:54] [singing]
[30:59] My cup's overflowing. [singing]
[31:04] [music]
[31:06] No weapon [singing] can harm me. [music]
[31:13] Oh why God before us who can be against
[31:17] [music and singing] us.
[31:19] Hallelujah.
[31:21] Oh,
[31:23] hallelujah.
[31:26] I am
[31:29] [music]
[31:34] [music]
[31:37] I
[31:39] [music]
[31:40] always
[31:44] [music]
[31:50] [music]
[31:51] Halleluah.
[31:54] I am God.
[31:57] [music]
[32:03] For he's [singing] my [music] comfort.
[32:07] Oh hold me close. Your [music] spirit
[32:12] lives within me.
[32:18] Your spirit lives within me, so I will
[32:23] walk in your peace. Your spirit [music]
[32:26] lives within me. My victory, [singing]
[32:30] my victory. Your [music] spirit lives
[32:33] [singing] within me. So I will walk in
[32:37] your [music] peace. Your spirit lives
[32:40] within me. My victory. [singing]
[32:44] by victory.
[32:46] [music]
[32:47] Oh hallelujah. [singing]
[32:52] I am not alone. [singing]
[32:57] [music]
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord
[33:01] &gt;&gt; for he's [music and singing]
[33:04] my comfort.
[33:07] always hold me close.
[33:11] [singing]
[33:14] Hallelujah. Can you give the Lord a hand
[33:16] clap of praise here tonight? [applause]
[33:20] Amen.
[33:23] So glad
[33:25] that he's our shepherd here tonight.
[33:27] Amen.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that we're never alone.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; My goodness. It may the devil may throw
[33:33] it on us like we are, but we're never
[33:35] alone. That's right.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that here tonight. I'd
[33:38] like to say I thoroughly enjoyed the
[33:40] message this morning. [applause]
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It spoke to my heart and
[33:47] [applause]
[33:48] something I've been dealing with and so
[33:50] I really appreciate his [music]
[33:53] um his willingness to let the Lord use
[33:54] him here this morning. Amen. I tried my
[33:57] best to get him to take part two
[33:58] tonight, but here we are. Amen. Um, if
[34:02] you have your Bibles, I'd like to turn
[34:04] to Genesis 1 and one and like, did you
[34:07] write this?
[34:09] Amen. I tell you what, I appreciate my
[34:11] my daughter. Every It seems like
[34:13] everywhere I go, there's a sticky note
[34:15] somewhere
[34:17] saying she loves me or appreciates me.
[34:19] And I've been nervous about, you know,
[34:20] this thought and she wrote this here.
[34:23] So, I I appreciate that. It means a
[34:25] means a lot to me. Amen.
[34:28] Genesis 1 and1 when you're there say
[34:32] [clears throat] amen.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; We're going to read this passage of
[34:36] scripture and I'll let you have your
[34:37] seats and then we'll continue on. But
[34:39] Genesis 1 and one says in the beginning
[34:41] God created the heaven and the earth and
[34:44] the earth was without form and void and
[34:47] the darkness was upon the face of the
[34:49] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[34:52] the face of the waters.
[34:54] And God said let there be light. and
[34:57] there was light. Heavenly Father, how we
[35:00] love you here tonight, Lord. And it's
[35:02] such a privilege to be able to come into
[35:05] your house on this Sunday night, Lord,
[35:07] and feel your presence, Father, and and
[35:10] to know matter what we deal with or what
[35:12] we go through that we are never alone.
[35:15] Thank you, Lord, for that. And I pray
[35:17] here tonight that you'll just calm the
[35:19] nerves. Lord, may every heart be
[35:22] receptive to what you have for us here
[35:24] tonight. Lord, bless the reading of your
[35:27] word. In your name we pray. Amen. And
[35:29] amen. God bless you. You may be seated
[35:31] here tonight. If we can turn to John 1
[35:34] and 1-5.
[35:39] Amen. John 1 and 1-5.
[35:45] These are all very familiar passages of
[35:47] scripture. And I wish we all had a a
[35:51] brain like brother Merl where he can
[35:52] remember things. I bet he can quote
[35:55] this. I don't have that kind of memory.
[35:56] So, Amen. How many appreciates Brother
[35:59] Merl?
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate his song leading.
[36:02] [applause]
[36:04] Not song leading. We got song leaders.
[36:06] Then we got worship leaders. I
[36:07] appreciate brother Merl's worship
[36:08] leading. Amen.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. John 1:1 says, "In the beginning
[36:12] was the word, and the word was with God,
[36:14] and the word was God. And the same in
[36:17] the beginning with God. And all things
[36:19] were made by him, and without him was
[36:22] not anything made that was made. And in
[36:25] him was life, and the light life was the
[36:27] light of men. And the light shineth in
[36:30] darkness, and the darkness comprehended
[36:32] it not. John 1:5 in the ESV version
[36:35] says, "The light shines in the darkness,
[36:38] and the darkness has not overcome it."
[36:40] Thank God for that. Amen. 2 Corinthians
[36:43] 4 and6. I'm almost almost to my thought
[36:46] here tonight. 2 Corinthians 4 and verse
[36:48] 6
[36:50] says, "For God who commanded the light
[36:52] to shine out of the darkness has shined
[36:55] in our hearts to give the light of the
[36:58] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[37:00] face of Jesus Christ." And if I had a
[37:03] very simple title, it seems like this is
[37:06] something we've been dealing with our
[37:08] with the young people for the last month
[37:11] or so, but it'd be guarding the heart.
[37:14] Guarding the heart. And I and I love how
[37:17] the ESV version puts that comprehendeth
[37:21] not that it translates that it did not
[37:24] overcome it. Thank God that he could not
[37:26] overcome. He overcame the darkness.
[37:29] Amen. 2 Corinthians 4:6 talks about our
[37:32] hearts being in darkness and the light
[37:35] of the truth shineth out of that
[37:37] darkness and the darkness could not
[37:40] overcome it. Amen. The darkness will
[37:42] never be able to overcome that light.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; No matter how hard it pushes and no
[37:47] matter how dark the evening may be in
[37:50] this age that we live in, how dark and
[37:52] chaotic and evil it is, it will never be
[37:55] able to snuff out the light.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We see here in Genesis in
[38:03] creation, it's the same pattern that God
[38:06] saved us with. Amen. And the first words
[38:09] that God spoke actually expressed every
[38:13] word that God would ever truly speak.
[38:15] Amen. It was as though his first words
[38:18] would describe every other word that
[38:20] came from his mouth when he said, "Let
[38:23] there be light." John said Jesus was the
[38:26] word and that word is life. And that
[38:29] life is the light of all men. How many
[38:31] can say amen to that? And after we read
[38:34] the speaking forth of light in Genesis,
[38:37] we read where God winds up planting a
[38:40] garden eastward in Eden
[38:43] &gt;&gt; and putting man in that garden. Genesis
[38:45] 2 and 7 says, "And the Lord God formed
[38:48] man out of the dust of the ground and
[38:51] breathed into his nostril nostrils the
[38:53] breath of life and man became a living
[38:56] soul. And the Lord planted a garden
[38:59] eastward in Eden. And there he put the
[39:02] man whom he had formed. So bear with me
[39:05] as I build a foundation here tonight.
[39:06] Notice the garden is eastward in in
[39:09] Eden. And a single river flowed from
[39:12] Eden into that garden. Genesis 2:10
[39:15] says, "And a river came out of Eden and
[39:18] watered the garden. From then it was
[39:20] parted and became into four heads." So
[39:24] we see here that it flowed into four
[39:26] different directions from there. And
[39:28] Adam was instructed carefully above
[39:32] everything else to dress
[39:34] &gt;&gt; and to keep this garden. Amen. Genesis
[39:37] 2:15 says, "And the Lord took man and
[39:40] put him in the garden of Eden to dress
[39:42] and to keep it." And the meaning of this
[39:44] dress and keep it means to protect it.
[39:47] And the Lord God commanded the man,
[39:49] saying, "Of every tree of the garden,
[39:52] thou mayest freely eat, BUT OF THE TREE
[39:54] OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD and evil, thou
[39:56] shalt not eat of it. For in the day thou
[39:59] eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die."
[40:01] So we see here the first thing that we
[40:04] READ RECORDED WAS GOD'S WORD TO ADAM. DO
[40:07] NOT EAT OF THAT TREE.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN EAT OF THAT TREE ALIVE. YOU CAN
[40:11] EAT OF EVERY TREE IN THE GARDEN, BUT
[40:13] THAT TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL,
[40:16] THOU SHALT NOT PARTAKE OF THAT TREE. GOD
[40:19] ALWAYS HAS A PURPOSE FOR EVERYTHING HE
[40:21] DOES.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THE FIRST PURPOSE GOD HAS FOR
[40:25] ADAM IS TO dress and to KEEP THE GARDEN.
[40:28] AND WE MUST NOTICE ABOVE EVERYTHING
[40:30] ELSE, ADAM WAS TO DRESS AND PROTECT THAT
[40:34] GARDEN. NO MATTER WHAT WOULD COME IN, NO
[40:36] MATTER WHAT WOULD TRY TO HINDER, HE WAS
[40:38] TO PROTECT THAT GARDEN. YEAH,
[40:40] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS WHY HE WAS PUT THERE AND HE WAS
[40:43] TOLD NOT TO EAT OF THAT FALSE TREE.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; And then WE READ ADAM'S DISOBEDIENCE and
[40:49] and sin and took place AND HE WAS BEING
[40:52] CAST OUT OF THE GARDEN. BROTHER BRHAM
[40:55] SAID THAT ADAM WILLINGLY DISOBEYED
[40:57] BECAUSE OF HIS LOVE FOR EVE
[41:00] &gt;&gt; WHICH DEPICTS CHRIST'S LOVE FOR US.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; CHRIST WILLINGLY LEFT HIS THE SPLENDOR
[41:06] OF HEAVEN. HE WILLINGLY CAME DOWN AS A
[41:09] MAN TO LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR LOVE.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Genesis 3 and22 says, "And the Lord God
[41:17] said, behold, the man is become as one
[41:20] of us to know good and evil. And now,
[41:24] lest he put forth his hand and take also
[41:26] of the tree of life, and eat and live
[41:29] forever." Therefore, THE LORD GOD SENT
[41:32] him f forth from the garden of Eden to
[41:34] teal the ground from whence he was
[41:36] taken. So he drove out the man and
[41:39] placed at the east of the garden of Eden
[41:41] cherubams and a flaming sword which
[41:45] turned every way to keep the way of the
[41:48] tree of life. SO THE VERY THING GOD'S
[41:50] WORD FOCUSED around was the tree of
[41:53] life. AND WE SEE BECAUSE MAN WAS
[41:56] DISOBEDIENT
[41:57] &gt;&gt; AND THEY FELL INTO SIN, THEY COULDN'T
[42:00] PARTAKE OF THAT TREE OF LIFE ANY LONGER.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; FOR GOD SAID THE VERY FIRST THING HE
[42:04] SAID WAS NOT TO EAT OF THAT FALSE TREE.
[42:08] AND WE SEE THE LAST THING THAT TOOK
[42:10] PLACE WAS ADAM DID EAT OF THAT FALSE
[42:12] TREE AND WAS KICKED OUT OF THE GARDEN
[42:15] BECAUSE OF HIS DISOBEDIENCE. REMEMBER
[42:19] THE WOMAN WAS THE FIRST ONE TO SIN BUT
[42:21] BECAUSE OF LOVE.
[42:24] ADAM COULD HAVE KICKED HER ASIDE.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; ADAM COULD HAVE STAYED IN THE GARDEN AND
[42:28] WATCHED HIS LOVE LEAVE, BUT BECAUSE
[42:31] THERE WAS A LOVE IN HIS HEART, SHE WAS A
[42:33] PART OF HIM.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; And he knew HE COULDN'T LIVE LIFE
[42:37] WITHOUT HER. SO HE DECIDED TO WILLINGLY
[42:41] PARTAKE OF THAT TREE for love.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:47] AND WE SEE BECAUSE OF THIS THE WAY OF
[42:50] THE TREE OF LIFE WAS BLOCKED and man WAS
[42:53] NOT ALLOWED TO EAT IT freely like they
[42:56] used to because of sin.
[42:58] Amen. And we see a scripture here that
[43:02] connects all this together in Proverbs
[43:04] 4:23 says, "Keep thy heart WITH ALL
[43:08] DILIGENCE, FOR OUT OF IT ARE THE issues
[43:12] of life." KEEP THY HEART WITH ALL
[43:14] DILIGENCE. NOW I'M GETTING TO MY THOUGHT
[43:17] ON GUARDING THE HEART. FOR OUT OF THAT
[43:19] ARE THE ISSUES OF LIFE WITH ALL
[43:21] DILIGENCE. THE TRANSLATION HERE SAYS
[43:24] ABOVE ALL KEEPING ABOVE ALL KEEPING.
[43:28] KEEP ALL THY HEART ABOVE EVERYTHING
[43:30] ELSE.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. PROTECT THAT HEART. GUARD
[43:34] THAT HEART. WATCH WHAT YOU PUT IN THAT
[43:36] HEART. WATCH WHAT YOU ALLOW TO GO INTO
[43:38] THAT HEART. BECAUSE OUT OF THE ISSUES OF
[43:41] THAT HEART ARE THE ISSUES OF LIFE. YEAH.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; The heart.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, REGARDING ALL OTHER
[43:49] THINGS, YOU MUST PROTECT AND keep that
[43:52] heart. I hope you're understanding where
[43:54] I'm going so far.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE GREATEST ELEMENT WE WERE EVER
[43:58] TOLD WAS TO KEEP AND TO PROTECT THAT
[44:01] HEART.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE SEE THAT ADAM'S FIRST PURPOSE
[44:06] was keep in the garden. HIS FIRST
[44:09] COMMANDMENT WAS WAS NOT TO EAT OF THAT
[44:11] FORBIDDEN TREE. And we SEE THE
[44:14] SERIOUSNESS OF ADAM'S PROTECTION OF THAT
[44:16] GARDEN LATER WHEN THE SERPENT SLIPPED IN
[44:19] AND DECEIVED EVE. AND WE SEE HOW IT IT
[44:23] CAUSED A DOMINO EFFECT ON MAN.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[44:26] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T GOD'S PURPOSE.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[44:29] &gt;&gt; WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SPOKEN IN BY THE
[44:31] WORD.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; BUT THEN SIN CAME ABOUT. WE UNDERSTAND
[44:35] THAT GOD HAS A PLAN FOR EVERYTHING.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT? GOD ALLOWED SIN TO
[44:41] HAPPEN. GOD ALLOWED THAT SERPENT TO SLIP
[44:43] IN THERE. GOD ALLOWED THE FALL OF
[44:45] MANKIND. GOD ALLOWED ADAM TO TO GO AFTER
[44:49] THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE HAD A
[44:51] PLAN.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; SO, WE SEE NOW THAT SIN HAS SLIPPED INTO
[45:01] THE HUMAN RACE. NO LONGER ARE WE LIVING
[45:03] IN A STATE OF PERFECTION. I LOVE THAT
[45:05] HOW HOW EVE FELL IN A state of
[45:07] perfection. BUT THIS BRIDE,
[45:10] &gt;&gt; IN A STATE OF IMPERFECTION, IN A STATE
[45:12] OF CHAOS, IT'S GOING TO BE STRONG AND
[45:14] MIGHTY.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN ENDURE WHAT
[45:19] SATAN HAS FOR US IS TO GUARD THE HEART.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; PROTECT THE MIND. PROTECT THE HEART.
[45:26] REMEMBER, OUT OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THE
[45:28] HEART,
[45:30] &gt;&gt; THE MOUTH SPEAKETH. WHAT YOU HAVE HERE
[45:33] WILL ULTIMATELY COME OUT HERE.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; YES,
[45:37] &gt;&gt; IT'S IT MATTERS YOUNG PEOPLE. IT MATTERS
[45:40] ELDERS WHAT WE PUT HERE.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; IT MATTERS WHO WE HAVE AS OUR STABILITY
[45:47] IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS. IT IT MATTERS
[45:49] WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; I'M GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF, BUT IT
[45:53] MATTERS.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; IT MATTERS
[45:57] &gt;&gt; WHO WE HAVE AT THE HELM OF THE SHIP.
[45:59] YEAH.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; So we SEE ADAM WAS CALLED TO DRESS AND
[46:03] TO KEEP THE GARDEN. HE WAS CALLED TO
[46:05] PROTECT IT. LIKEWISE, YOUR HEART IS THE
[46:10] MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR ENTIRE BODY.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND ABOVE ALL ABOVE all
[46:19] your you're you're try to get skinny,
[46:22] try to eat right. Yeah. Amen. I've been
[46:24] trying that for 34 years now.
[46:27] Above all, my my boy Uriah is he's
[46:31] determined to get a six-pack.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Seven years old. And I'm proud of him.
[46:35] He doesund and something sit-ups a day.
[46:38] When he eats sugar, he makes sure to he
[46:40] does extra exercises. He's diligent. BUT
[46:43] ABOVE ALL THAT, YOUR HEART IS THE MOST
[46:46] IMPORTANT THING. NOT A SIX-PACK,
[46:48] [laughter]
[46:49] NOT YOUR LOOKS.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; NOT HOW YOU LOOK OUT HERE AS WE HEARD
[46:52] THIS MORNING,
[46:53] &gt;&gt; BUT INWARDLY THE HEART
[46:55] &gt;&gt; IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. AND THE
[46:58] REASON IS IS FROM FROM THE HEART OR THE
[47:00] ISSUES OF LIFE, ISSUES OF LIFE THAT THAT
[47:03] COME OUT OF HERE IN THE NATURAL. THE THE
[47:05] ACTIVITIES YOU DO AND THE WORKS YOU
[47:07] COMMIT, THE THE WORDS YOU SAY, THINGS
[47:09] YOU DO IN THE NATURAL.
[47:12] Think about it.
[47:15] Brother Merl, maybe you could help me
[47:16] with this. What is the number one cause
[47:18] of heart attacks?
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Nervousness.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Nervousness. Any anyone else?
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Stress.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Sugar.
[47:28] Yeah.
[47:29] Being unhealthy, fat like me. If you
[47:33] want to live a longer life, you must
[47:36] first protect your natural heart.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Okay? In order to to prevent yourself
[47:41] from having a heart attack and and
[47:43] having things that take place in your
[47:45] life, YOU MUST TAKE THE PROPER measures
[47:48] to prevent yourself from having that
[47:50] heart attack. Ain't that right?
[47:52] &gt;&gt; And we SEE IN THE SUPERNATURAL, in order
[47:55] for you to prevent yourself FROM HAVING
[47:57] A SPIRITUAL HEART ATTACK, YOU MUST WHAT?
[48:00] PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE DANGERS OF THE
[48:03] ENEMY.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO PROTECT.
[48:07] I KNOW I'M I'm repeating MYSELF HERE,
[48:09] BUT IT'S SO important
[48:12] what you allow to enter here.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Your heart is a very important part of
[48:23] yourself. And and so much the term has
[48:27] been said and speaking of of of the
[48:30] heart of the matter. Amen.
[48:33] It says HERE, "YOUR HEART PUMPS blood to
[48:35] the limbs and which you utilize to act
[48:39] and to do." They say the BLOOD IS CALLED
[48:42] THE LIFE of the flesh.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Leviticus 17:11 17 and 11 says,
[48:49] "For the life of the flesh is in the
[48:51] blood."
[48:53] &gt;&gt; "And I have given it to you UPON THE
[48:54] ALTAR TO MAKE AN ATONEMENT for your
[48:56] souls, for it is in the blood that
[48:58] maketh an atonement for your souls." So
[49:01] we see here the life is within THE
[49:03] BLOOD.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; YOUR LIMBS REQUIRE LIFE in order for you
[49:07] to act and to do. Amen.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; If you DON'T HAVE ANY BLOOD FLOW TO THAT
[49:11] LIMB, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU HAVE NO
[49:15] BLOOD FLOW TO YOUR RIGHT ARM?
[49:18] &gt;&gt; You're going to lose it.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; So we see here in Proverbs 4:23 says,
[49:23] "Keep thy heart with all diligence." I'm
[49:26] getting somewhere here tonight.
[49:28] For out of it are the issues of life.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; BLOOD IS PHYSICALLY the issue OF LIFE.
[49:34] WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LOSE TOO MUCH
[49:36] BLOOD?
[49:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I need someone that's smarter than
[49:40] me. What happens when you lose too much
[49:42] blood?
[49:43] &gt;&gt; You die.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; And what happens when YOU MAKE IT TO THE
[49:47] hospital on time, but you've lost a
[49:48] large amount of blood? What do they do
[49:50] to you?
[49:52] &gt;&gt; What's so important about the blood?
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Blood. Yeah. Yeah.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; What's so important about the heart
[49:58] working properly? [laughter] It gives
[50:01] life. Without your heart, you're dead.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So from THE ISSUE, THE HEART OF
[50:08] BLOOD ISSUES OF LIFE, IT'S IT'S POPPED
[50:10] INTO YOUR ARMS, INTO YOUR HANDS, into
[50:12] your legs, and to your feet. SO WE
[50:14] UNDERSTAND THAT THE HEART is very
[50:16] important. And people are very concerned
[50:19] over their hearts above other health
[50:22] problems. Amen. Everyone protects their
[50:24] heart. ABOVE ALL THINGS, PROTECT YOUR
[50:27] HEART.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BIBLE SPEAKS OF THE HEART AS the
[50:31] part of you that believes and loves.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Romans 10:9 SAYS THAT IF THOU SHALT
[50:36] CONFESS WITH THY MOUTH THE LORD JESUS,
[50:39] AND SHALL BELIEVE IN THY HEART THAT GOD
[50:42] has raised HIM FROM THE DEAD, THOU shalt
[50:44] be saved. 1 PETER 1:22 SAYS, "SEE, ye
[50:48] have purified your souls, obeying the
[50:51] truth through the spirit unto UNFEIGNED
[50:53] LOVE OF THE BRETHREN. See that you love
[50:56] one another with a pure heart,
[50:59] &gt;&gt; fervently." [snorts]
[51:01] &gt;&gt; YES.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; SO, THE IDEA OF YOUR HEART, IT COMES
[51:05] WITH A A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE.
[51:07] I HOPE THIS OKAY TONIGHT.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; PROTECT YOUR HEART. WATCH WHAT YOU LOVE.
[51:15] PROTECT YOUR HEART. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU
[51:18] LET IN. GUARD YOUR HEART.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; For out of the abundance of their heart.
[51:24] Amen. We see here THE SERPENT GAVE A
[51:27] WORD to Eve that she believed
[51:31] even when he was a lie.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah, BROTHER.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; AND LOOK WHAT IT DID TO THE HUMAN RACE.
[51:37] IT DOES MATTER WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; I SAID IT EARLIER. IT MATTERS WHAT YOU
[51:43] PUT YOUR FEET UPON.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; IS IT ON SANDY GROUND? DOES IT LOOK GOOD
[51:48] BUT DOESN'T HAVE A FOUNDATION? OR IS IT
[51:51] SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THE STORMS?
[51:54] BECAUSE REMEMBER, WHEN YOU BELIEVE THIS
[51:56] MESSAGE AND YOU HAVE CHRIST AS YOUR IN
[51:59] THE HOLY GHOST IN YOUR HEART, SATAN IS
[52:01] GOING TO ATTACK THAT BELIEF.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'RE NOT STABILIZED IN WHAT YOU
[52:05] BELIEVE, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? YEAH,
[52:08] &gt;&gt; IT MATTERS WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; IT MATTERS WHAT YOU HAVE ANCHORED YOUR
[52:14] HEART.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; YES.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; IT IT IT DOESN'T MATTER. AMEN.
[52:20] IF IT'S OFF WHAT THE PASTOR SAYS OR WHAT
[52:23] THIS PERSON THINKS OR YOU'RE GOING TO
[52:25] END UP LIKE EVE, BELIEVING IN A LIE
[52:27] THINKING IT'S A TRUTH.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. You must know that you
[52:32] know that YOU KNOW BEYOND A SHADOW OF A
[52:34] DOUBT. NO MATTER WHO MAY COME AND TRY
[52:36] AND TALK YOU OUT OF IT.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW [screaming] THAT I BELIEVE
[52:40] WHAT I BELIEVE. REGARDLESS OF THE
[52:42] CIRCUMSTANCE, [applause]
[52:44] &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF THE WINDS. COME ON NOW.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T GOING TO TALK ME OUT OF WHAT I
[52:50] BELIEVE.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But be careful.
[52:54] Satan can lead you astray if you're not
[52:57] anchored.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:59] Watch what you love. First John 2:15
[53:02] SAYS, "LOVE NOT THE WORLD,
[53:05] neither the things that are in the
[53:07] world."
[53:08] If any man love the world and the love
[53:10] of the father, if any man love the
[53:13] world, the love of the father
[53:16] is not in him.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Good.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as much as if you get heart
[53:28] [snorts] disease or if your blood gets
[53:30] diseased, it affects your arms. Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; It affects your legs, it it affects
[53:36] other parts of your body. It can
[53:38] you.
[53:41] AND IF YOU'RE NOT WHERE YOU NEED TO BE
[53:42] with the Lord, your spiritual heart can
[53:45] cause problems as well.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah, BROTHER. AMEN.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; YOUR HEART CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS AND IT CAN
[53:53] CAUSE YOUR SPIRITUAL BODY NOT TO
[53:55] FUNCTION PROPERLY.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; IT CAN CAUSE YOUR ARM TO BE CRIPPLED. IT
[53:59] CAN CAUSE YOUR YOUR LEG TO GO NUMB. IT
[54:01] CAN CAUSE YOUR MIND TO BE SEARED. IF
[54:03] YOU'RE NOT WHERE YOU OUGHT TO BE WITH
[54:05] THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, I SAY HERE
[54:08] TONIGHT, YOU CAN HAVE IT. [cheering]
[54:10] [applause]
[54:11] &gt;&gt; HE CAN TAKE A STONY HEART.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; HE CAN TAKE A HEART THAT'S BEEN
[54:15] CORRUPTED BY THE WORLD AND GIVE YOU A
[54:17] FRESH HEART AGAIN. AMEN.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You say, "Brother Kobe, I haven't
[54:22] GUARDED MY HEART LIKE I needed to."
[54:24] Well, I KNOW A GOD THAT CAN REPAIR THE
[54:26] HEART.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; HE CAN GIVE ME A FRESH START LIKE WE
[54:29] HEARD THIS MORNING. SOMETIMES WE OUGHT
[54:31] TO JUST GO BACK TO THE BLOOD AGAIN. YOU
[54:33] SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, I FAILED AND I FEEL
[54:35] LIKE THERE'S NO HOPE FOR ME." AS LONG AS
[54:37] THERE'S BREATH IN YOUR BODY, THERE'S
[54:39] HOPE FOR YOU. [applause]
[54:41] &gt;&gt; IT IS SATAN THAT WILL TRY TO PREVENT YOU
[54:44] FROM GOING ALL THE WAY. BUT HERE
[54:45] TONIGHT, HERE TONIGHT, JUST PUSH
[54:48] THROUGH.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; HE WILL TAKE THE STONY heart and give
[54:55] you a fresh heart again. I pray this is
[54:57] okay tonight.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; But they say the heart is on the left
[55:02] side of your chest.
[55:06] I seen this here today and I thought
[55:07] this was good. says, "If we were like
[55:09] maps,
[55:11] then with north at our head and south at
[55:14] our feet, our hearts would be precisely
[55:17] in the same location the garden was in
[55:20] Eden."
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Okay. Are you with me here tonight? Let
[55:24] me
[55:25] &gt;&gt; let me get this out here.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; AND LIKE THE FOUR RIVERS THAT are
[55:29] leaving the garden, OUR OUR OUR HEARTS
[55:32] PUMP BLOOD TO THE FOUR LIMBS THAT CARRY
[55:34] OUT OUR ACTIONS AND OUR DEEDS.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; OKAY? IT CONTROLS OUR ARMS
[55:39] &gt;&gt; and our legs. WE KNOW THE FOUR RIVERS
[55:41] LEAVING THE GARDEN ARE LIKE BLOOD
[55:43] LEAVING THE HEART TO THE FOUR LIMBS.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT RIVER OF
[55:49] EDEN THAT'S GOING INTO THE GARDEN WHERE
[55:52] IT SPLITS INTO FOUR? IF I CAN SAY THIS
[55:55] HERE, THAT IS OUR OXYGEN.
[55:58] AND GOD HAS BREATHED INTO ADAM THE
[56:01] BREATH OF LIFE.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; YES.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; That's good. AIR IS THEN PUT INTO OUR
[56:07] LUNGS AND INTO OUR BLOODSTREAM WHERE THE
[56:10] HEART PUMPS INTO THE BODY. BREATH OF
[56:12] LIFE, RIVER OF LIFE. GOD IS OUR BREATH
[56:16] OF LIFE HERE TONIGHT. [applause]
[56:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I HOPE THAT'S OKAY. REVELATIONS 22
[56:22] says and 22 and1 and he showed me a pure
[56:26] river of water of life clear as crystal
[56:29] proceeding out of the throne of God and
[56:31] of the lamb and in the midst of the
[56:34] street of it on either side of the river
[56:36] there was a tree of life which beare 12
[56:38] manners of fruits and yielded her fruit
[56:43] every month and the leaves of the tree
[56:46] were there for the healing of the
[56:48] nations. S how many can say Jesus is the
[56:52] life here tonight.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; He is that life.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; John 6:53 says and Jesus said unto them
[57:00] verily verily I say unto you except you
[57:02] eat the flesh of the son of man and
[57:05] drink his blood ye shall have no life in
[57:08] him in you. John 6 and63 says, "It is
[57:12] the spirit that quickenth, THE FLESH
[57:15] PROFITTH NOTHING, BUT THE WORDS THAT I
[57:18] SPEAK UNTO YOU, they are spirit and they
[57:21] are life." His words are life.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; And we SEE THAT THE GARDEN RECEIVED a
[57:28] river of LIFE
[57:29] &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS NOT TO RECEIVE ANYTHING ELSE.
[57:33] AND IF I CAN SAY THIS, THE WORDS THAT
[57:35] YOU ARE LISTENING TO, IF IT'S NOT
[57:37] BENEFITING YOU,
[57:39] &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD
[57:39] &gt;&gt; AND BRINGING YOU CLOSER TO THE LORD,
[57:42] THEN I WOULD PUSH THOSE WORDS ASIDE
[57:44] BECAUSE THE WORDS OF GOD ARE WORDS OF
[57:47] LIFE.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; IT SHOULDN'T CAUSE YOU TO STUMBLE.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; IT SHOULDN'T PUSH YOU DOWN, BUT IT
[57:54] SHOULD LIFT YOU UP.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD BE YOUR LIGHT IN DARKNESS. IN
[57:58] THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE SICK, IT'S YOUR
[58:00] HEALING.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Oh my.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; SO THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING ELSE COMING
[58:06] INTO THAT HEART BESIDES WORDS OF LIFE.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY ADAM WAS THE PROTECTOR OF THE
[58:12] GARDEN. ONLY ALLOWED RIVERS OF LIFE TO
[58:15] COME IN. AND THAT IS SPEAKING OF JESUS
[58:18] HERE TONIGHT. I'M ALMOST DONE.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Keep it keep it short here tonight.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; But Jesus is that life.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT JESUS, WE HAVE NO LIFE. COME
[58:31] ON.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; We're not ABLE TO LIVE.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT ABLE TO FUNCTION.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT
[58:39] OUR HEART LIKE WE NEED TO WITHOUT JESUS
[58:42] THE PROTECTOR IN OUR LIFE.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOUR
[58:47] MIND WITHOUT CHRIST BEING THERE WITH
[58:49] YOU?
[58:50] &gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO HAVE FAITH TO
[58:52] BELIEVE FOR A RAPTURE IF CHRIST IS NOT
[58:55] THERE WITH YOU?
[58:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Come on.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Let him live through you here tonight.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. YOUR STRENGTH
[59:08] COMES FROM WHAT YOU EAT AND FROM WHAT
[59:10] YOU DRINK AND FROM WHAT YOU BREATHE.
[59:12] IT'S JESUS living through us.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S JESUS ABIDING WITH I WISH I CAN GET
[59:18] THIS HOW I SEE IT HERE TONIGHT.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; IT'S JESUS BREATHING THROUGH US.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. COME ON.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; THE SERPENT HAS NO WAY TO COME IN IF
[59:28] JESUS IS YOUR LIFE.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; THE LIAR HAS NO WAY TO COME IN AND
[59:33] DECEIVE YOUR MIND AND TAKE YOUR HEART IF
[59:35] JESUS IS YOUR LIFE.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY THAT WILL SUBSTITUTE
[59:42] OTHER THINGS. IF JESUS IS YOUR LIFE,
[59:46] &gt;&gt; oh man,
[59:47] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to myself here tonight.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; WE CAN ALLOW THINGS IN OUR HEARTS. AND
[59:52] WE CAN ALLOW THINGS IN OUR MIND AND WE
[59:54] CAN ALLOW OUR ACTIONS TO TO NOT BE OF
[59:56] CHRIST BECAUSE WE'VE LET DOWN OUR GUARD.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN OUR GUARD IS LET DOWN, WHAT
[1:00:02] HAPPENS WHEN THE GUARD TO THE CASTLE HAS
[1:00:05] BEEN TAKEN OUT?
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; THAT CASTLE IS VULNERABLE TO ATTACK
[1:00:09] BECAUSE THERE'S NO WATCHMEN. THERE'S NO
[1:00:11] GUARD PROTECTING THE CITY. AND IF YOU
[1:00:14] DON'T HAVE YOUR WATCHMEN AT THE HELM OF
[1:00:16] YOUR HEART, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE
[1:00:19] SILENT ATTACK. COME ON.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; AND WE CAN FALL INTO THE into the sin
[1:00:24] and into THE THINGS OF THE WORLD BECAUSE
[1:00:26] WE'VE GROWN LAX ON THE WATCH.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU TONIGHT, BRING
[1:00:31] JESUS BACK IN. LET HIM BE THE PROTECTOR
[1:00:34] OF THE HEART. [applause]
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Is that good tonight?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; I pray it's a help. But but what are you
[1:00:48] letting into your heart? As I'm about to
[1:00:50] wrap THIS UP NOW,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; YOUR heart is the source of your words
[1:00:57] and your actions.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Matthew 12:35 says, "A good man out of
[1:01:03] the good TREASURE OF THE HEART BRINGETH
[1:01:04] FORTH GOOD THINGS, and an evil man out
[1:01:08] of the evil treasure
[1:01:10] bringeth forth evil things."
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Matthew 15:18.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; It says, "But these but those things
[1:01:18] which proceedth out of the mouth cometh
[1:01:21] from the heart, and they defile the man.
[1:01:24] FOR OUT OF THE HEART proceeds evil
[1:01:27] thoughts and murders,
[1:01:30] adulterers,
[1:01:32] fornications, thefts, false witness,
[1:01:35] blasphemies.
[1:01:36] These are the things which defileth a
[1:01:39] man. But to eat with unwashed hands
[1:01:42] defileth not a man." Now I want you to
[1:01:45] notice the words of Proverbs 4:1
[1:01:50] says, "Hear ye children the instruction
[1:01:52] of the father and attend
[1:01:56] to no understanding,
[1:01:58] no understanding,
[1:02:01] no truth." Is that all right?
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Like Genesis says, "Let there be light."
[1:02:07] And in Proverbs 4:4, he it says here, if
[1:02:11] we can turn to Proverbs 4 and4,
[1:02:14] AND HE TAUGHT ME ALSO AND SAID UNTO ME,
[1:02:16] LET THINE HEART retain my words. Keep my
[1:02:20] commandments
[1:02:22] and live. Proverbs 4:11 says, "I HAVE
[1:02:26] TAUGHT THEE IN THE WAYS OF WISDOM, and I
[1:02:28] have led thee in the right paths."
[1:02:31] GENESIS 3:24 SAYS, "SO HE DROVE OUT THE
[1:02:34] MAN,
[1:02:36] and he placed at the east of the garden
[1:02:40] of Eden cherubams,
[1:02:43] and a flaming sword, which turned every
[1:02:45] way to keep to the way of the tree of
[1:02:49] life,
[1:02:51] the way of wisdom, the way of the tree
[1:02:54] of life, the right paths.
[1:02:58] I've spoken on this before, but it's so
[1:03:00] important what we watch, what we read,
[1:03:04] what we listen to,
[1:03:07] what we allow to take up our time.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; I've learned more of the bad things that
[1:03:14] you put into your heart.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; It hardens the heart.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Sure does.
[1:03:21] If all you have on your mind is is
[1:03:23] movies
[1:03:25] and and and songs that ain't of the Lord
[1:03:28] and things that THAT JUST FILLING YOUR
[1:03:30] MIND WITH JOCK ALL THE TIME, IT HARDENS
[1:03:33] YOUR HEART TO THE sensitivity of the
[1:03:35] Lord.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NO LONGER SENSITIVE TO THE
[1:03:38] PRESENCE OF THE LORD. AND YOU SAY, "HOW
[1:03:40] DO YOU KNOW, BROTHER KOBE, I'VE DONE IT.
[1:03:43] I'VE BEEN THERE.
[1:03:46] I'VE ALLOWED THINGS SO HARD IN MY HEART
[1:03:49] AND BECAUSE OF IT YOU'LL ACT WAYS THAT
[1:03:51] YOU WOULD NEVER ACT BEFORE.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL LASH SHOUT AND RAGE WHERE ONCE
[1:03:56] BEFORE YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU JUST LET THE LORD come in and
[1:04:00] TAKE HIS JACKHAMMER UPON YOUR HARD AND
[1:04:03] HEART
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; AND YOU WATCH HOW TEARS THAT YOU HAVEN'T
[1:04:07] SHED IN YEARS BEGIN TO FLOW DOWN YOUR
[1:04:11] FACE.
[1:04:13] YOU WANT YOUR HEART THAT'S BEEN CRUSTED
[1:04:15] OVER BY THE WORLD AND LET GOD GET A HOLD
[1:04:17] OF IT. I WAS TALKING I PREACHED THE
[1:04:19] OTHER DAY AT BROTHER BENUIT'S CHURCH AND
[1:04:22] THERE'S A LADY THAT CAME UP AND SHE
[1:04:23] SAID, "BROTHER KOBE, I HAVEN'T CRIED IN
[1:04:26] YEARS."
[1:04:28] BUT SHE SAID, "WITH THE MESSAGE THAT YOU
[1:04:30] PREACHED," SHE SAID, "I COULDN'T HELP
[1:04:32] BUT NOT CRY." SHE'S LIKE, "THE LORD DONE
[1:04:34] SOMETHING TO MY HEART." AND THIS WAS AN
[1:04:37] ELDER OF THE CHURCH. AND WHAT I'M SAYING
[1:04:39] IS GOD CAN DO THE SAME FOR YOU HERE
[1:04:41] TONIGHT. YOU SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, I I
[1:04:43] HAVEN'T FELT HIS PRESENCE IN A LONG
[1:04:45] TIME." [screaming] GOD CAN FIX THAT HERE
[1:04:47] TONIGHT. YOU SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, I MY
[1:04:49] HEART HAS BEEN HARDENED."
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; GOD CAN FIX IT HERE TONIGHT.
[1:04:56] [applause]
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; You're looking at a I'm going to say I'M
[1:04:59] A YOUNG MAN. I'M still young. I'm 34.
[1:05:01] YOU'RE LOOKING AT A YOUNG MAN THAT
[1:05:03] SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO stand here tonight.
[1:05:07] THE PAST THAT I'VE HAD AND THE THINGS
[1:05:09] THAT I'VE DONE AND WAYS I'VE ACTED.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, BROTHER.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; ALLOW MY HEART TO BE HARD.
[1:05:20] [snorts]
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; But it's God. And I'm TELLING YOU HERE
[1:05:25] TONIGHT, if he can do it for me,
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; he can do it for YOU HERE TONIGHT.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WE'RE ALL SAVED AND maybe we're
[1:05:31] ALL PERFECT. MAYBE I'M JUST SPEAKING TO
[1:05:34] MYSELF. BUT IF THERE'S SOMEBODY HERE
[1:05:36] TONIGHT THAT CAN SAY, "BROTHER KOBE, I'M
[1:05:38] PUSHING PAST THE PRIDE AND I'M SAYING, I
[1:05:41] NEED HELP." HE'S HERE TONIGHT.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE TO TO FIX THAT BROKEN HEART.
[1:05:47] HE CAN DO IT. ONLY GOD CAN DO IT.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Only God can do it.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:01] Proverbs
[1:06:03] 4:18. How many will give me just a few
[1:06:04] more minutes?
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 4:18, it says, "But the path of
[1:06:08] the just is as the shining light that
[1:06:11] shineth more and more until the perfect
[1:06:13] day, and the way of the wicked is as
[1:06:16] darkness, they know not
[1:06:20] what they stumble." John 20 and 21 says,
[1:06:23] "Then said Jesus to them again, peace be
[1:06:26] unto you.
[1:06:28] As my father has sent me, even so send I
[1:06:30] you."
[1:06:32] And when he had said this, he breathed
[1:06:35] on them
[1:06:37] and said unto them, "Receive ye the Holy
[1:06:40] Ghost." Jesus breathed and said it was
[1:06:44] the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:46] And here tonight, I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED
[1:06:48] JESUS TO BREATHE on us a little bit here
[1:06:49] tonight.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; SAY, GOD, I'VE GROWN STALE.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; I'VE GROWN TIRED AND WEARY.
[1:06:57] [sighs]
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; I need you to breathe ON ME AGAIN. RENEW
[1:07:00] MY MIND. RENEW MY HEART.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; GOD, I HAVEN'T FELT YOUR PRESENCE IN
[1:07:06] SUCH A LONG TIME.
[1:07:08] God can breathe life here tonight.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU FIRST GOT TO PUSH PAST AND GET
[1:07:14] TO A POINT WHERE YOU HAVE TO SAY, "I
[1:07:17] NEED HELP." GOD CAN'T HELP YOU UNLESS
[1:07:19] YOU REALIZE YOU NEED HELP. YEAH.
[1:07:24] [sighs and gasps]
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; YEAH. That is
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; But get the Holy Ghost in your heart,
[1:07:30] young people.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 55 and1
[1:07:40] says, "Oh, everyone that thirsteth, come
[1:07:42] ye to the waters.
[1:07:45] And he that hath no money, come ye BUY
[1:07:48] AND EAT.
[1:07:50] YAY COME AND BUY WINE AND MILK WITHOUT
[1:07:52] money without price.
[1:07:54] Wherefore do you spend MONEY FOR THAT
[1:07:56] WHICH IS NOT BREAD, and you labor for
[1:07:59] that which satisfaith not?
[1:08:02] Hearken hearkenth diligently unto me,
[1:08:06] and eat ye that which is good, and let
[1:08:08] your soul delight itself in fatness.
[1:08:12] Incline your ear, and come unto me. here
[1:08:15] and your soul shall live and I will make
[1:08:18] an everlasting covenant with you even
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; the sure mercies of David. Thank God.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Isaiah
[1:08:26] 35 and verse one
[1:08:29] as the musicians get ready to come now
[1:08:32] says in the wilderness and the solitary
[1:08:34] place shall be glad for them and the
[1:08:37] desert shall rejoice and blossom as the
[1:08:40] rose.
[1:08:42] IT SHALL BLOSSOM ABUNDANTLY AND REJOICE
[1:08:44] even with joy in singing. The glory of
[1:08:47] Lebanon shall be given unto it and the
[1:08:50] excellency of Carmel and Sharon. They
[1:08:53] shall see the glory of the Lord and the
[1:08:56] excellency of our God. Oh my. Strengthen
[1:09:00] ye the weak hands.
[1:09:02] Confirm the feeble knees. Say to them
[1:09:06] that are of a fearful heart, be strong
[1:09:08] and fear not. Behold, your God will come
[1:09:11] with vengeance, even God with
[1:09:13] recompense. He will come and save you.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; THEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND SHALL BE
[1:09:18] OPEN, OH MY.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; And the ears of the deaf shall be
[1:09:22] unstopped.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Then the lame MAN SHALL LEAP AS A HEART,
[1:09:26] AND THE TONGUE OF THE DUMB SING. For in
[1:09:28] the wilderness, oh my, IN YOUR DRY PLACE
[1:09:32] SHALL WATERS BREAK OUT,
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; and streams in the desert,
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; and the parched ground shall become a
[1:09:38] pool. In the thirsty land, springs of
[1:09:40] water.
[1:09:41] In the habitation of dragons, where each
[1:09:44] lay shall be grass with reeds and
[1:09:47] rushes,
[1:09:48] and a highway shall there be, and a way,
[1:09:51] which shall be called the way of
[1:09:53] holiness.
[1:09:55] The unclean shall not pass over it, but
[1:09:57] it shall be for those.
[1:10:00] The warfare in men, though full shall
[1:10:03] not heir therein.
[1:10:05] No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous
[1:10:08] beast shall go there up thereon. It
[1:10:11] shall not be found there, but the
[1:10:13] redeemed. How many is redeemed tonight?
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; But the redeemed shall walk there,
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; and the ransomed of the Lord shall
[1:10:22] return. Oh my. And come to Zion with
[1:10:26] songs and everlasting joy upon their
[1:10:28] heads.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; They shall obtain joy and gladness and
[1:10:32] sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; God promised that in your wilderness.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; As we preached the other day, he'll turn
[1:10:43] your sadness into singing. Yes.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; THAT IN YOUR HARD TROUBLED TIMES, THOUGH
[1:10:48] IT MAY SEEM like you've been there for a
[1:10:50] season,
[1:10:52] God promised that in that moment,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; he'll give you joy.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; In that moment, that moment WHERE IT
[1:11:00] FEELS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN ALONE AND YOU'VE
[1:11:02] BEEN HURTING, GOD PROMISED to restore.
[1:11:06] In that moment where you've been sick
[1:11:07] and and tired,
[1:11:10] God promised he'll heal and renew.
[1:11:13] What's in your heart today?
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Where are you at with the Lord?
[1:11:19] I know myself. I've allowed things to
[1:11:21] come in, but here tonight, Lord,
[1:11:25] open my heart.
[1:11:31] Open my mind. Lord
[1:11:38] God, we're a needy people tonight.
[1:11:43] And Lord, we can get tired.
[1:11:48] We can get weary, Lord.
[1:11:52] And in this journey called life, we can
[1:11:55] be broken.
[1:11:57] We can be battered, Lord. We can get
[1:12:00] hard in heart,
[1:12:03] Lord. We can get to places where
[1:12:06] we're dry and thirsty, Lord. I know
[1:12:11] myself. I've been there,
[1:12:14] God.
[1:12:17] Oh, how I wish again to feel the
[1:12:19] presence of the Lord.
[1:12:23] Take the hardened heart, Lord. Take the
[1:12:26] broken here tonight. the weary in mind.
[1:12:30] These elders that have stood for your
[1:12:33] your gospel, Lord, your message year
[1:12:35] after year after year. Lord, lift up the
[1:12:38] feeble hands.
[1:12:42] Bring joy again, Lord.
[1:12:48] Bring singing within our sadness.
[1:12:50] Father,
[1:12:52] restore the joy
[1:12:55] of thy salvation as we heard this
[1:12:57] morning, Lord.
[1:12:59] create in me a clean heart.
[1:13:03] Take out the malice, Lord.
[1:13:06] Any grudges, anything
[1:13:09] that we've allowed to stay in the heart
[1:13:12] and that we've entertained,
[1:13:14] take it out, Lord. Perform surgery,
[1:13:17] Father, right now.
[1:13:19] Purify this heart.
[1:13:22] Make it new again, Lord. Make it fresh.
[1:13:25] Make it to where we're sensitive to your
[1:13:28] spirit again, Lord.
[1:13:32] Not hardened by the things of the world,
[1:13:34] but Lord, sensitive
[1:13:37] to when you drop in our room, our car,
[1:13:39] Lord, where when we're at work,
[1:13:42] the ladies are at home, Lord, taking
[1:13:45] care of the children, Lord, or the young
[1:13:46] people are needing an answer from you.
[1:13:50] In those times, Lord,
[1:13:53] may our hearts be receptive to your
[1:13:55] presence.
[1:13:58] And here tonight, Father, maybe it's
[1:14:00] just me, but I I feel you here tonight,
[1:14:02] Lord.
[1:14:04] And while you're here among us, I pray
[1:14:07] that we open up our hearts,
[1:14:10] be receptive to your presence, Lord.
[1:14:15] We thank you for your love and your
[1:14:17] mercy.
[1:14:20] for caring for us
[1:14:23] when we didn't feel
[1:14:26] worthy of it. Lord, being loved when we
[1:14:28] weren't lovable
[1:14:30] in the season of thanksgiving.
[1:14:33] May we always be thankful, Lord, for
[1:14:35] what you've done.
[1:14:37] For what you've done, Lord, the places
[1:14:39] that you've taken us from.
[1:14:43] Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:46] Amen. And amen. Can we sing that? Create
[1:14:50] in me
[1:14:52] a clean [singing]
[1:14:55] heart.
[1:14:59] Oh
[1:15:01] God,
[1:15:03] and renew
[1:15:06] and renew a right spirit
[1:15:11] within
[1:15:13] me. [singing]
[1:15:17] Create in me. Oh, [singing] create in
[1:15:22] me. Is that your prayer tonight?
[1:15:27] Yes, Lord,
[1:15:30] oh [singing]
[1:15:32] God.
[1:15:34] And renew
[1:15:37] and renew [singing]
[1:15:39] a right [music] spirit
[1:15:42] within
[1:15:44] me. [singing]
[1:15:47] Cast me not away.
[1:15:51] Oh, [singing and music] cast me not
[1:15:55] away
[1:15:57] from thy presence.
[1:16:02] Oh [singing]
[1:16:03] Lord,
[1:16:06] take not
[1:16:08] [music]
[1:16:10] [singing]
[1:16:13] [music]
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; from me.
[1:16:17] [singing]
[1:16:20] Glor restore [singing]
[1:16:24] unto me
[1:16:28] all the joy
[1:16:30] of thy [music and singing] salvation
[1:16:37] [music] and renew arise spirit
[1:16:42] within [singing and music]
[1:16:44] me.
[1:16:46] Here's my heart, oh God. [singing]

[1:16:54] [music]
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; make it [singing] ever
[1:16:57] true.
[1:17:02] Here's my heart, [singing] oh God.
[1:17:09] May [singing] I be like [music] you.
[1:17:14] Take my heart.
[1:17:16] Oh, take my heart, oh God.
[1:17:21] Yes, Lord. Make it ever true.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; It ever [singing]
[1:17:26] true. Yes, Lord.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Take my heart, oh God. [singing]
[1:17:37] [music]
[1:17:38] May I be [singing]
[1:17:41] like you.
[1:17:43] You are the potter.
[1:17:46] You are [music] the water.
[1:17:52] [singing]
[1:17:53] I am the clay. [singing]
[1:18:02] More me [singing and music] and make
[1:18:05] me.
[1:18:08] This is what I pray. [singing]
[1:18:15] Take my heart, oh God.
[1:18:20] Sing it now as we turn up to brother
[1:18:21] Michael.
[1:18:23] Make [singing] it ever true.
[1:18:28] Yes, Lord.
[1:18:30] Take my heart, oh God. [singing]
[1:18:37] May I be [singing]
[1:18:40] like you. You are the potter.
[1:18:45] You are the potter. [singing and music]
[1:19:02] and [music]
[1:19:07] this is my
[1:19:09] [music]
[1:19:15] heart. Oh God,
[1:19:21] make everything
[1:19:24] true.
[1:19:29] Hear my [music and singing] heart, oh
[1:19:32] God.
[1:19:36] [music]
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And just give the Lord a hand clap
[1:19:46] of praise here this evening. [applause]
[1:19:49] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:52] Amen. Did you enjoy the word of the
[1:19:54] Lord? Amen. Brother Kovi just coming up
[1:19:56] and speaking his heart.
[1:19:59] You know,
[1:20:02] I ain't the smartest guy,
[1:20:05] but I can tell when the Lord's calling
[1:20:07] somebody.
[1:20:09] I can tell when he comes and he [music]
[1:20:11] takes two people that haven't talked.
[1:20:15] He takes a song leader that didn't even
[1:20:17] know he was leading songs here this
[1:20:18] evening and all of a sudden he begins to
[1:20:21] orchestrate things together. That's not
[1:20:23] for the individuals doing it. That's for
[1:20:25] the people that God's come to speak to.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; And I feel like the Lord's wanting to
[1:20:30] speak to some hearts here this evening.
[1:20:33] And we should be a privileged people to
[1:20:35] be sitting in front in his presence
[1:20:36] [music]
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; and in that place to receive from him.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; I certainly enjoyed [music] that from
[1:20:42] brother Kobe.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Guarding your heart. Amen. [applause]
[1:20:47] Amen. Just wonderful. It's wonderful.
[1:20:52] Amen. [music] Let's continue to sing
[1:20:54] that little song as we get ready to
[1:20:56] dismiss.
[1:20:59] [music]
[1:21:06] ever
[1:21:08] true.
[1:21:10] [music]
[1:21:13] Here's my heart. Oh God,
[1:21:20] may I be
[1:21:23] like you.
[1:21:25] Here's
[1:21:28] my heart,
[1:21:30] oh God. [singing]
[1:21:35] Make it ever
[1:21:38] true.
[1:21:42] And here's my heart,
[1:21:45] oh God.
[1:21:50] made
[1:21:53] like you.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our hearts as [music] we
[1:21:58] get ready to dismiss. We'll have the
[1:22:00] brothers dismiss us. Anybody that would
[1:22:03] like to stay, you're sure welcome to
[1:22:05] worship the [music] Lord. Heavenly
[1:22:07] Father, we just appreciate you.
[1:22:11] And God, we just want to tell [music]
[1:22:12] you that we love you, Lord. We thank you
[1:22:15] for speaking to our hearts, [music]
[1:22:18] Lord. Being able to come just take away
[1:22:20] the crustiness, Lord,
[1:22:23] for taking away and washing, Lord, our
[1:22:25] hearts pure with [music] your word. And
[1:22:28] Lord, and when we do so, Father, I would
[1:22:30] just ask, God, that we would just guard
[1:22:32] our hearts from malice or envy or guard
[1:22:36] our hearts from just anything that might
[1:22:39] be against your word or against your
[1:22:41] church. Lord Jesus, I would just pray,
[1:22:44] Lord, that these messages [music] that
[1:22:46] were spoke today would just come and it
[1:22:48] would just be with your people, Lord.
[1:22:50] And may we meditate upon these things
[1:22:52] while we drive, Lord. Or [music]
[1:22:54] Lord, as we walk or we just do our daily
[1:22:56] duties, Father, God, we know that you
[1:22:59] would like to speak to us. [music] And
[1:23:01] Lord, may we have the heart to respond
[1:23:03] to your presence.
[1:23:05] Father, as we get ready to leave this
[1:23:07] place, [music] Lord, may we ever, Lord,
[1:23:09] not be able to leave your presence,
[1:23:11] Lord. And we just thank you, God. We
[1:23:14] just give you the glory and the honor
[1:23:15] for everything that's said and done here
[1:23:17] this evening in Jesus [music] name.
[1:23:20] Amen. And amen.
[1:23:23] I pray. [singing]
[1:23:24] [music]
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Here's my Here's
[1:23:36] my heart, Lord.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Here it is.
[1:23:42] Lord, I'm giving it to you here this
[1:23:43] evening,
[1:23:46] cuz he's right here for you to give him,
[1:23:48] too.
[1:23:50] May I be like you.
[1:23:55] [music]
[1:23:57] Here's my heart,
[1:24:00] oh God.
[1:24:02] [singing]
[1:24:05] Make it ever [music]
[1:24:07] true.
[1:24:12] Here's my heart,
[1:24:14] oh God,

[1:24:19] and may it be
[1:24:22] like you.
[1:24:35] get ever
[1:24:37] true. [music]
[1:24:42] Here's my heart.
[1:24:44] Oh God,
[1:24:46] [singing]
[1:24:49] may be
[1:24:52] like you.
