[52:34] to be baptized of thee thou Come Thou
[52:37] comest thou to me and Jesus answered him

[52:42] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[52:46] then he suffered him and Jesus when he's
[52:48] baptized went straightway out of the
[52:50] water and lo the heavens were opened up
[52:52] to him and he saw the spirit of God
[52:54] descend like a dove and lighting upon
[52:57] him and ler voice from Heaven saying
[53:00] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[53:03] pleased I just look real quick at a few
[53:06] words becometh means it's fitting or
[53:09] it's proper or it's right and to fulfill
[53:12] is to bring to completion or reality to
[53:16] achieve or realize something that's
[53:18] desired or promised amen Hebrews chapter
[53:21] 6 and verse 4 says for it is impossible
[53:24] for those those who are once enlightened
[53:26] to have taste of the Heavenly gift and

[53:31] and have tasted the good word of God and
[53:33] the powers of the world to come if they
[53:36] shall fall away to renew them again to
[53:38] repentant sin They Crucified themselves
[53:40] the Son of God AR fresh and put him to

[53:57] cursing whose end is to be burned but
[54:00] beloved we are persuaded better things
[54:03] of you things that accompany salvation
[54:06] thus we though we thus speak for God is

[54:16] Saints and do Minister and we desire
[54:18] that every one of you do show the same

[54:37] swear by himself saying surely bless him
[54:41] I will bless thee and multitud multiply

[55:13] devil that you can overcome in this
[55:16] world Amen that amen that you can apply
[55:19] yourself amen as a young person to the
[55:21] word of God and and God bless you and
[55:24] we're we're so thankful for that you
[55:26] know I I was thinking on my way up here
[55:28] as I begin to think about these services
[55:30] and and the Lord began to deal with me
[55:32] uh kind of uh as maybe say on on a kind
[55:36] of a new horse I hadn't preached this
[55:37] sermon before so a lot of times a
[55:40] preacher likes to be comfortable in that
[55:42] and maybe preach something he's already
[55:44] went over before but the Lord laid these
[55:46] things upon my heart and I found this
[55:48] quote that begin to really dwell with me
[55:50] and in my inner man as I begin to think
[55:53] about it said I think it would pay us
[55:55] all to sit down and wonder why we are
[55:59] here in the first place amen and who was
[56:03] kind enough to bring us
[56:06] here amen who was kind enough to bring
[56:09] us here we ought to consider and ask him
[56:13] what he would have us to do amen the
[56:17] purpose of Us coming and to fulfill what
[56:20] he has purposed for us to fulfill every
[56:24] one of us has has a part to play every
[56:26] one of us it doesn't matter who you are
[56:28] it doesn't matter where you come from it
[56:30] doesn't matter amen your your stature or
[56:33] your or your uh uh how how rich or how
[56:36] poor you are that matters nothing Amen
[56:39] in the eyes of God but every one of you
[56:41] is important every one of you has a part
[56:44] to play and every one of you need to
[56:46] take a moment and say why am I here why
[56:50] why why I you know I don't believe you
[56:52] just came to just sit on a white chair
[56:54] in a in a building or or to be around
[56:56] some friends play some volleyball but I
[56:58] I believe there ought to be something
[57:00] deeper on the inside of us that are
[57:01] wondering why am I here why did somebody
[57:05] think of me so much in the first place
[57:07] and was kind enough to allow me to be
[57:10] born in this time that I'm living in
[57:13] amen and were you were one in a million
[57:15] amen when you were born it was worn out
[57:17] out of millions that could have made it
[57:19] amen to that egg to be gerti but God
[57:22] chose you and he brought you to this
[57:25] place not to just sit on a Pew or not to
[57:28] just be a a young person in Leo deia age
[57:30] but amen To Be A God Called child of God
[57:34] Amen that God could put something in
[57:36] your life or desire Amen to fulfill and
[57:39] you know as we're coming why are we
[57:41] coming why are we coming to youth camps

[57:46] living where we're living at why is God
[57:49] placed Us in the place that we are at
[57:51] you know I believe that we've come to
[57:53] this meeting amen not to just meet
[57:55] somebody and if you meet somebody that's
[57:57] fine or not to just Fellowship but if
[58:00] you fellowship with somebody that's fine
[58:02] but it's for a purpose and that purpose
[58:04] is to find a New Hope Amen to find what
[58:07] God has a has planned for us in our
[58:10] lives we are on this Earth here and we
[58:13] know we're living in darkness we we
[58:15] don't have to imagine that we don't have

[1:05:05] purpose God has put you here for has
[1:05:08] been made manifest no matter how much
[1:05:10] trouble we have no matter how much
[1:05:12] heartaches or Sorrows you go through all
[1:05:14] these are for reason there's a reason
[1:05:16] for it we take for instance no in the
[1:05:18] Bible the flood come the Earth was
[1:05:20] destroyed the vegetation everything but
[1:05:23] Noah and the SE
[1:05:24] was taken into the ark why because the
[1:05:27] purpose of God will never be
[1:05:30] defeated come on somebody I'm trying to
[1:05:33] drive it into your heart you're God's
[1:05:35] purpose so if you're God's purpose you
[1:05:38] cannot be
[1:05:43] defeated this is why the devil don't
[1:05:45] want you to see who you really are he
[1:05:47] wants to make you think you're some
[1:05:49] little trotten down forgot about person
[1:05:52] but God came this morning to tell you
[1:05:54] know that's not who you are you're my
[1:05:56] son you're my daughter you're my child
[1:05:59] and I have placed you here and nothing
[1:06:02] shall defeat
[1:06:05] you hallelujah it's a rest you can take
[1:06:09] the revelation of God's word living
[1:06:12] inside of
[1:06:15] me then you can say no sickness no
[1:06:18] sorrow no death no Peril nothing to
[1:06:21] separate me from the will of God cuz
[1:06:23] I've been put here for a purpose there's
[1:06:26] no power there's nothing can separate me
[1:06:28] from God's Immortal plan so then we'll
[1:06:30] find that in the days of all the worlds
[1:06:32] being destroyed God made a
[1:06:35] preparation he made a preparation for
[1:06:37] what cause to preserve his
[1:06:42] purpose he had an ark why to preserve
[1:06:44] his
[1:06:46] purpose he's got a Rapture why to
[1:06:48] preserve his
[1:06:50] purpose come on somebody amen he did it
[1:06:53] in the days of and he's doing it today
[1:06:55] he's making a preparation to conserve
[1:06:58] his
[1:07:00] purpose he will conserve a church he
[1:07:03] will conserve a people he will conserve
[1:07:06] subject for his great domain and death
[1:07:08] will not destroy them we realize that by
[1:07:11] faith we believe this by res the
[1:07:14] resurrection produce a solid foundation
[1:07:16] on which our faith rests nothing can
[1:07:18] destroy as a poet once wrote Oh What A
[1:07:21] foraste of Glory Divine air of salvation
[1:07:24] purchased of God born of his Spirit
[1:07:26] washed in his blood Blessed
[1:07:29] Assurance upon this Solid Rock the
[1:07:32] resurrection of our Lord Jesus nothing
[1:07:35] can destroy it it has been planted it is
[1:07:38] a seed of God it is a purpose that will
[1:07:41] be
[1:07:44] fulfilled you are the planning of the
[1:07:50] Lord and you're going to bring forth
[1:07:53] fruit in it's duee season he's going to
[1:07:56] send the rains he's going to send the
[1:07:58] sunshine he's going to send whatever you

[1:08:03] his purpose is
[1:08:09] fulfilled he said we we have God's
[1:08:11] Eternal promise he said there may be
[1:08:13] teachers there may be isms there may be
[1:08:15] programs rise there may be some things
[1:08:18] sometimes it looks like it's going to be
[1:08:19] destroyed but it can never be
[1:08:22] destroyed
[1:08:25] look at your neighbor and say I can't be
[1:08:28] destroyed now look at that devil and say
[1:08:31] you ain't going to destroy me cuz I'm
[1:08:33] God's purpose God will never let his
[1:08:36] Heritage be
[1:08:38] destroyed oh my it's his purpose to give
[1:08:41] it to us we think today upon
[1:08:43] destructions trying to destroy we have
[1:08:45] Christ's own promise we think of the
[1:08:47] Hebrew children amen they were
[1:08:49] determined Satan was determined to
[1:08:51] destroy the purpose of God because he
[1:08:54] knew those children was going to go into
[1:08:56] the furnace and so they heated it seven
[1:08:58] times
[1:09:00] hotter is that not a type of us today
[1:09:03] seven times hotter the worst age has
[1:09:06] ever been to live in he's heated it up
[1:09:09] he's brought all the problems he brought
[1:09:10] all the situation he's Unleashed all the
[1:09:14] sicknesses Millions times millions of
[1:09:16] demons have been released into this age
[1:09:19] that we living
[1:09:20] in he's brought it all here he's he it
[1:09:25] up but he failed to put one thing in his
[1:09:28] equation the fourth
[1:09:34] man he put the wood he put the fire he
[1:09:37] added it and added it and added it seven
[1:09:40] times harder but he failed to realize
[1:09:42] that when you step into the
[1:09:44] [Applause]
[1:09:46] fair Hallelujah and something was given
[1:09:49] on the inside of these Hebrew children I
[1:09:52] have a purpose do what you want to okay
[1:09:55] but as for me I'm not going to
[1:10:00] Bow amen if I can just ignite that in
[1:10:02] your heart this morning do what you want
[1:10:04] to devil but I'm not bowing I'm not
[1:10:07] bending my knee to your pressure I'm not
[1:10:09] bending my need of what you have I'm not
[1:10:12] bending to your dress I'm not bending to
[1:10:15] your pornography I'm not giving myself
[1:10:17] to that I have a greater
[1:10:22] purpose
[1:10:24] [Applause]
[1:10:29] it may look impossible but our God is
[1:10:35] greater amen Daniel purposed in his
[1:10:38] heart he wouldn't defile himself with
[1:10:41] the king's
[1:10:42] meat do we have any Daniels in the
[1:10:47] building
[1:10:48] amen so we have a
[1:10:51] purpose Daniel knowing how God was going
[1:10:54] to do it or not knowing how he was going
[1:10:56] to do it rather but knowing god was able
[1:10:58] to knowing something down and told him
[1:11:00] God has a purpose in this and it's going
[1:11:03] to be fulfilled a lion could not eat the
[1:11:08] prophet because God had a purpose
[1:11:13] there Satan is going around as a roaring
[1:11:16] lion but he can't eat
[1:11:19] you cuz you have a purpose there amen he
[1:11:23] can't get to you brother R said like
[1:11:25] this he said I was sitting in a barber
[1:11:26] chair one time and get a haircut young
[1:11:28] Fell's cutting my hair down at brother
[1:11:31] eggin shop and I was just sitting there
[1:11:33] my head down I was so tired meetings
[1:11:36] have been so long and I trying to get
[1:11:37] away in the morning for a little rest
[1:11:39] before the next ones would start and I
[1:11:40] was so tired it seemed like my heart
[1:11:43] would just quit beating after a while
[1:11:45] sitting there all of a sudden I could
[1:11:46] hear everyone talking but it seemed like
[1:11:48] I was out in space somewhere I thought
[1:11:50] have a had a heart attack am I just
[1:11:52] going to die leave right here in this
[1:11:54] Barber chair I thought wonder if that's
[1:11:56] what's taking place I felt my hands they
[1:11:58] were numb my heart seemed like it quit
[1:12:00] beating I thought oh but there is a
[1:12:03] gospel that's got to be
[1:12:06] preached there's no power that can take
[1:12:09] me until God's purpose is
[1:12:13] fulfilled there's nothing that can hurt
[1:12:15] me not one thing until God's purpose
[1:12:18] fulfilled and when that isn't fulfilled
[1:12:21] I want to go on with his purpose when
[1:12:23] he's finished I'm
[1:12:25] finished when he's finished with me I'm
[1:12:27] finished with
[1:12:30] life when you're when he's finished with
[1:12:33] you you're finished also so what
[1:12:35] difference does it make god holds it all
[1:12:37] in his hand whether you're young or
[1:12:39] whether you're old you brother Timothy
[1:12:42] I'm a young person I got a long life no
[1:12:44] there's been a lot of young people's
[1:12:45] life snuffed out just like
[1:12:47] that cuz God's purpose for them was
[1:12:52] finished hello
[1:12:54] somebody this world is not our
[1:12:58] purpose I'm just going to say it getting
[1:13:01] Ed real education is not your true
[1:13:05] purpose sure it might be needed for what
[1:13:08] you need but don't get the wrong idea
[1:13:10] that that's my purpose because when it
[1:13:12] becomes your purpose it becomes your
[1:13:16] God and you put it over the things of
[1:13:19] God and the next thing you know you put
[1:13:21] your job over God and you put your life
[1:13:23] livelihood over God and you put
[1:13:25] everything above the purpose of
[1:13:32] God Amen
[1:13:37] anyhow God has a
[1:13:40] purpose Jesus said it becometh me to
[1:13:44] fulfill all
[1:13:45] righteousness in other words it's right
[1:13:47] is what I should do to fulfill brother
[1:13:50] BR said what is righteousness he said it
[1:13:52] is the word of of God I've come to
[1:13:55] fulfill the word of God this is what he
[1:13:57] said search the scriptures you think you
[1:13:59] have eternal life search them you

[1:26:29] take take just a little bit off the path
[1:26:31] just for a moment
[1:26:33] maybe but he said I always thought the
[1:26:36] church wasn't a halfhazard
[1:26:41] what the what do he mean lacking order
[1:26:45] or purpose not
[1:26:48] planned Jesus never came to the Earth in
[1:26:52] a halfhazard
[1:26:54] way he never died in a halfhazard way he
[1:26:58] came for a purpose and that purpose was
[1:27:02] to fulfill the word of God that he might
[1:27:05] purchase himself a church without spot
[1:27:08] or without
[1:27:09] wrinkle so if he is the perfect antitype
[1:27:13] amen a model of something to come then
[1:27:15] we shouldn't be halfhazard
[1:27:18] either we shouldn't be halfhazard about

[1:34:50] people it ain't too silly
[1:34:54] it's real I mean I'm not not trying to
[1:34:56] make light of it there fears are real
[1:34:58] demons are
[1:35:01] real we're not trying to say they're not
[1:35:03] real they are real but what we're trying
[1:35:06] to tell you is you're greater than any
[1:35:09] fear you're greater than any Spirit of
[1:35:12] hell that wants to rise
[1:35:15] up and say you can't do it or say you
[1:35:17] ain't able or say you're unworthy or say

[1:35:27] you
[1:35:30] Mercy time is
[1:35:32] moving it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:35:37] righteousness in other words it must be
[1:35:40] fulfilled all the word of God that has
[1:35:43] been spoken must be
[1:35:45] fulfilled Jesus fulfilled his
[1:35:49] part Elijah fulfilled fulfilled his part
[1:35:52] John the Baptist fulfilled his
[1:35:54] part Paul fulfilled his part William
[1:35:57] Brandon fulfilled his
[1:36:01] part but it's not just up to them to
[1:36:04] fulfill and we look back and we say look
[1:36:05] how they fulfilled it they've done such
[1:36:07] a good job fulfilling it it's such a
[1:36:09] wonderful thing it's fulfilled but no
[1:36:11] God still has word in this day to be
[1:36:17] fulfilled and I want you to understand
[1:36:19] it's not just about scripture about a
[1:36:21] preacher to fulfill
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:26] it amen because there's other antitypes
[1:36:30] in the Bible that were models of
[1:36:32] something future to come there was a
[1:36:34] Mary that was about 16 years old that
[1:36:37] got visited by an Angel and she looked
[1:36:39] at that and heard the word and said how
[1:36:41] can these things
[1:36:42] be and he began to expound to her how it
[1:36:45] was going to take place how that she was
[1:36:48] highly favored love that last night
[1:36:50] brother Andrew I she was F highly
[1:36:54] favored and he she said this is going to
[1:36:58] be well be it unto
[1:37:02] me where's a young 16y old girl today
[1:37:05] that hears the word of God and just says
[1:37:08] be it unto
[1:37:09] me where's a young boy amen that will
[1:37:13] stand in the face of the fire and say be
[1:37:15] it unto me build up the fire how you
[1:37:18] want to oh King but I'm not going to bow
[1:37:22] where's a young man that that that found
[1:37:24] out there's a Goliath that's making a
[1:37:26] challenge and and he's and he's made all
[1:37:28] listen David didn't go down into that
[1:37:31] into that Valley because he he fought
[1:37:33] well he wasn't a good fighter sure he
[1:37:35] killed a bear he killed a lion he he he
[1:37:38] he could use a sling amen but he wasn't
[1:37:40] a train
[1:37:42] fighter he didn't go down there cuz he
[1:37:44] fought well he went there because he
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:37:49] believed there was others that f well
[1:37:51] but they didn't
[1:37:52] believe give me a young man that
[1:37:55] believes that believes he's the same
[1:37:58] yesterday today forever that believes
[1:38:00] he's the same God that he was then he is
[1:38:04] now give me a young girl that
[1:38:07] [Applause]
[1:38:15] believes let's hear about our antitype
[1:38:17] he said I came down from heaven not to
[1:38:19] do my own will
[1:38:22] but the will of him that sent
[1:38:25] me W that's a hard word right there as a
[1:38:28] teenager is
[1:38:32] will we got our own
[1:38:34] wheels I ain't talking about w e e l I'm
[1:38:38] talking about w i l
[1:38:43] l but some of you are so more concerned
[1:38:46] about your w e LS keeping them shiny and
[1:38:50] clean
[1:38:54] man look at them
[1:38:57] Wheels meanwhile the person that gets
[1:38:59] inside them shiny Wheels is so smudy and
[1:39:07] dirty why don't we worry about cleaning
[1:39:10] this up as much as we worry about
[1:39:12] cleaning that
[1:39:16] up come on somebody but we got our will
[1:39:19] w l
[1:39:22] but Jesus our antitop said not my will
[1:39:25] but thy will be done not what I desire
[1:39:28] but what you
[1:39:33] desire let me let me just drop this in
[1:39:35] here to young people because a lot of
[1:39:37] times you get all we get we get you know
[1:39:39] we get into our our teenage years and I
[1:39:41] know I I I was one at one time too many
[1:39:45] years
[1:39:46] ago and I became a rebellious teenager
[1:39:52] done a lot of things I wish I wouldn't
[1:39:53] have done slam doors in my mama's face
[1:39:57] that I wished I'd never
[1:39:58] slammed today I wish I could take back
[1:40:00] every
[1:40:02] door come on
[1:40:04] somebody oh we got real real right
[1:40:11] then said things I wish I could take
[1:40:14] back she forgave me we talked about them
[1:40:17] and all that but I still wish I'd have
[1:40:18] never set
[1:40:19] them
[1:40:22] but it was because I wanted my own will
[1:40:25] and I started looking at her and looking
[1:40:27] at my dad at somebody that was stopping
[1:40:29] me from what I
[1:40:31] wanted when I didn't realize they was
[1:40:33] protecting me from what I couldn't
[1:40:43] see they had already been down those
[1:40:46] roads they had already been through that
[1:40:49] listen your parents are not there to try
[1:40:52] to haunt you and hurt you they are put
[1:40:54] there by God for your
[1:41:03] protection so we have to lay our own
[1:41:05] will listen if you want anything from
[1:41:07] God you got to lay your whe
[1:41:11] down well I want I want the Holy Ghost
[1:41:13] but I want this and I want that I want
[1:41:15] that now forget about all
[1:41:19] that well brother Timothy I got a career
[1:41:22] forget your career it's
[1:41:29] temporary amen you make sure you find
[1:41:31] God
[1:41:34] first that is the most important thing
[1:41:37] not not a
[1:41:39] career people get it backwards they want
[1:41:41] a career well I want to be a nurse I
[1:41:42] want to be a doctor I want to be this I
[1:41:43] want to be that I got and it's so
[1:41:45] focused on a career and yes we need we

[1:44:30] faith to fulfill all
[1:44:32] righteousness amen we are to fulfill all
[1:44:35] the word of God he said when the high
[1:44:37] priest was washed then he could be
[1:44:41] anointed he was anointed with the Holy
[1:44:44] Ghost for John bear record saying seeing
[1:44:46] the spirit of God descending like a dove
[1:44:48] and going upon him a voice saying this
[1:44:51] is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to
[1:44:54] dwell in how do you think the holy
[1:44:56] spirit is going to want to dwell with
[1:45:02] pornography dwell with sins and
[1:45:05] unbelief I understand you have thoughts
[1:45:08] that's not what I'm talking about amen
[1:45:09] thoughts go through your mind and it's
[1:45:11] not Amen brother said you want to know
[1:45:12] if you're thinking the devil's thoughts
[1:45:14] or God's thoughts he said if it's
[1:45:15] contrary to the word it's the devil's
[1:45:18] thoughts he don't never put it back on
[1:45:20] on you he puts it back on the devil amen
[1:45:23] but when you allow those thoughts to
[1:45:24] stay there and you start building and
[1:45:26] building and building upon before you
[1:45:28] know you done committed it in your own
[1:45:35] mind you have to be
[1:45:38] washed before he was anointed he had to
[1:45:41] be washed so he could fulfill our what
[1:45:42] righteousness he had to be washed with
[1:45:44] water before the anointing he said what
[1:45:46] a beautiful type of today as priests
[1:45:48] unto God we must be first bapt baptized
[1:45:51] confessing our sins and be baptized in
[1:45:53] the name of Jesus Christ washing away
[1:45:56] our sins and then you shall receive the
[1:45:58] gift of the Holy Ghost the
[1:46:00] anointing amen wash first and then the
[1:46:03] anointed for service no Minister should
[1:46:05] enter the pool pit without being first
[1:46:07] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:46:10] because remission of sins is only in
[1:46:12] Jesus Christ's name not in another name
[1:46:14] under Heaven REM repentance and
[1:46:17] remission of sin must be taught in his
[1:46:19] name
[1:46:22] that's where the Holy Ghost fell at the
[1:46:24] beginning of Jerusalem that's where the
[1:46:26] Holy Ghost fell and anointed first so
[1:46:28] minister or any
[1:46:30] believer or any believer must be first
[1:46:33] washed from his sin in the name of Jesus
[1:46:36] Christ and then the anointing of the
[1:46:37] Holy Ghost will bring forth a testimony
[1:46:40] unto
[1:46:44] God Jesus said suffer John said me me
[1:46:48] baptize you you need to be baptized me
[1:46:50] he said no suffer it to be so cuz we
[1:46:53] must fulfill all righteousness we must
[1:46:56] fulfill this part of the word I have to
[1:46:58] be
[1:47:01] washed in other words John you're a
[1:47:03] mighty man you're Great Mighty prophet

[1:47:10] truth you know who I am you know because

[2:06:40] [Music]
[2:06:42] now and I know it's a morning
[2:06:46] service but there was a lot of things
[2:06:49] that were said here
[2:06:51] today that are so incredibly
[2:06:59] important because that purpose and
[2:07:03] understanding that purpose that God has
[2:07:06] for every one of
[2:07:09] us that we're not we're not wannabes
[2:07:12] we're not we're not hoping to
[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:17] be you're here because God put you
[2:07:22] here your
[2:07:25] design your
[2:07:27] nature your
[2:07:29] likes everything about
[2:07:33] you is so strategically and
[2:07:38] so incredibly down to the minute detail
[2:07:43] of Who You
[2:07:44] Are God built
[2:07:47] you
[2:07:50] but Satan comes in and he perverts
[2:07:53] that and he gets you confused
[2:07:57] and you have these these things
[2:08:01] of you're apologizing on the inside all
[2:08:04] the time and you're wishing you were
[2:08:07] somebody else all the
[2:08:09] time and you're wanting to
[2:08:14] somehow feel like you have purpose
[2:08:22] and that's why Christ had to
[2:08:25] come because I promise Adam and Eve
[2:08:28] didn't have those kinds of situations in
[2:08:30] their minds they didn't battle that of
[2:08:32] their
[2:08:33] hearts we battle it because you've got
[2:08:37] an eternal Soul you've got you you've
[2:08:41] got eternal life you've got a
[2:08:42] predestinated seed on the
[2:08:45] inside of a fallen body
[2:08:50] [Music]
[2:08:53] and sometimes it's easier just to run
[2:08:54] from our
[2:08:56] purpose that's where we've got to
[2:08:59] stop say
[2:09:02] Lord I want you to direct me I want your
[2:09:06] Holy Spirit to take
[2:09:09] control so that your life can live and
[2:09:13] manifest and be reflected through
[2:09:17] me
[2:09:20] I want to tell
[2:09:23] you the power of the holy spirit is here
[2:09:26] this
[2:09:28] morning and if you'll open up that heart
[2:09:30] right now and
[2:09:32] just raise that hand and say
[2:09:38] Lord I don't need a prayer line this
[2:09:40] morning I'm just wanting to surrender
[2:09:43] everything that I am to
[2:09:45] you I'm just a boy or a girl or I'm a
[2:09:48] teenager and I brother Timothy has
[2:09:51] struck my heart this morning the words
[2:09:53] that he's
[2:09:54] saying Lord some of you adults might
[2:09:57] need it too
[2:09:59] just Here I Am Lord I'm opening
[2:10:02] everything I am up to
[2:10:06] you if that predestinated seed I'm just
[2:10:09] asking for the
[2:10:11] logos that Living Word to just come down
[2:10:14] and ignite that word in
[2:10:17] me I Want To Be Your
[2:10:19] [Music]
[2:10:21] Vessel help me
[2:10:24] Lord God sees your
[2:10:27] tears God seen your tears God has seen
[2:10:30] your tears even before this service he
[2:10:33] seen your tears when you're at home and

[2:10:48] been and fought in those same areas I
[2:10:51] was fought when I was a kid I'm fought
[2:10:53] as an
[2:10:54] adult Satan trying to keep God's purpose
[2:10:58] from my life but you heard the man of
