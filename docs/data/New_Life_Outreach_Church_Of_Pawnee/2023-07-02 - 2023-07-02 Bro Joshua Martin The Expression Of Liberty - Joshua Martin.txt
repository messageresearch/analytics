we come to you Lord and the name above every other name father the Lord the house of Hell shakes and trembles At The Mention Of This name father Lord has been coming to this part of the service Lord you see this thought you've placed upon my heart God I ask that you are anoint to God lord you see the hands that are uplifted all throughout this building Lord you know the need behind every one of them Lord you know that the situations father you know the the chaos that they might be in father I ask that your spirit will move among the aisles tonight father move among the hearts father we ask that you would bring Liberty father May there be chains broke tonight father healings take place deliverances take place Lord Lord we ask these things in your precious name amen you you may be seated if I had a simple subject tonight it would be the expression of Liberty you see the meaning of Liberty is the quality or state of being free freedom from physical restraint celebrity ain't something in our imagination or something that we work up or or a sensation or a feeling but Liberty is something that is a reality you see Liberty ain't something that uh in our imagination but it's an expression if you've ever been set free every time that you walk down the road you're expressing your freedom you're expressing your Liberty The Way You Walk is expressing something the way you talk the way you act is expressing something it's something that is real something genuine you see the stars are expressing a light that is greater than them they're not expressing it in their own ability in their their their their own power but there was an unseen force that they are expressing you see the radio is expressing an Unseen World electricity is expressing an unseen force you you might not be able to see it but they're expressing an Unseen World bringing into reality where you can see it with your natural eyes you see brother Branham says we wouldn't know God was God if there wasn't a son he says when he said let there be light we will know he was God unless there was a light and he says it may have taken a lot of years but once that come to pass that was a Vindication that he was who he said he was because his word started to express itself you see whenever you take a yeah whenever the the word took on form it started to declare to the world that there was a God speaking with power speaking with the Lord with authority speaking with Dominion you see brother Branham says this now Peter speaking here we can find out that in the beginning when God said let there be light and there was light that's the interpretation to it when God says anything and it was manifested then that's God's interpretation that his word is right see when he said let there be light the and that was in his thinking before that uh before there was such a thing as light but when he said let there be a light the light sprung into the skies that's the interpretation nobody has to interpret that for God said so and there it was when God speaks and it manifests itself that's the interpretation of his word why can't men see that he says why don't people say that so whenever his word took on form and started to express itself that was a manifestation of what God was saying and I thought my you know brother Bradham says that anybody can argue scripture anybody can say scripture is false but until that word goes from letter form to manifestation he says they can no longer argue that it's real or not because there's an expression there's a life that has been changed there's somebody that was abound by alcohol Bound by addictions Bound by drugs and now their expressions is changed by another Power you know you think of the the man that was born blind he couldn't see all of his life the third come a time where he started to express another Authority he started to express a supreme power that went beyond a man's ability that went beyond a man's word to uh to a supreme word you know I love the story the Bible says that the scribes went up to his parents and says is that your boy that was sitting by the that was sitting by the gate that was blind and now he is healed how did this happen and they said he is of age go ask him in other words he is old enough to express what he feels and I thought that's the way it is with the bride of Christ the brightest come of age and she's expressing not her own ability she's not expressing her own power but she's come of age she's maturing inside of this world and she's expressing another power she's a player expressing another Authority from another world and they come up to this boy and says you know how did you get this how did you get your sight how do you see and the Bible says he looked at him and says Jesus healed me and they said don't you know that he's a liar he's a fortune teller he's this and he looks at him and says whether he be a sinner or not I don't know all I know is I was blind but now I see that expression ended all arguments that expression ended every debate that they had because there was a life that was changed by the power of the gospel and I say this when there's somebody that is living in overcoming life and expressing the true power of the Holy Ghost that is lighting up the world saying there's a God in the middle of Pawnee Oklahoma not because of a word but because of an expression the word has come inside out of a body and is expressing that other the same yesterday today and forever once said Jesus apart was the word inside of him expressing itself and that's what the brightest to be is an expression When God says anything it's got to express itself because whenever he said let there be light obviously it wasn't the devil coming and creating light because he's going to do the exact opposite so what was it it was the word coming with power taking on a form and expressing the power you see look at Psalms 97 and 6 the heavens declare his righteousness and all the people see his glory so how is the righteousness being declared to the Earth because there's the heaven that was created by the word of God how did the heavens get there in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth so his word went forth and took on form and materialized and that material and that form is now declared to the Earth that there is righteousness oh my so if the Earth if the heavens is doing that and the Earth is doing that and the nature is doing that what about the bride of Christ that has been redeemed by the blood of Christ that's been redeemed and broke from addictions you see the skies have never been set free the trees has never been set free the Earth has never been set free but there's a body there's a group that has been set free you are glorifying the power of almighty God because you're expressing that there's another Authority on Earth this ain't something from a man but this is an authority that is breaking Every Chain breaking every addiction breaking every stronghold and I say this evening wherever you're at if you need healing in your body if you need a feeling of the Holy Ghost the same God that filled the Pastor fill the deacons fill the preacher is the same God that is wanting to express his power through a young person through a mama through a daddy Hallelujah he needs somebody to express his life through Hallelujah he needs somebody to himself through you look at first chronicles 16 and 23 singing to the Lord all the Earth show forth from day to day his salvation he is speaking to the Earth here saying it to the Lord you Earth and so forth from day to day his salvation declare his glory among the Heathen His Marvelous Works among all nations so we're speaking of the Earth but he wasn't satisfied with just the Earth declaring his glory he wanted the body to declare to to declare his glory see without him saying Expressions you will never know anything existed without a thought taking on a form there would never be reality you see Thomas Edison created the light bulb but without a light bulb it was just a good thought Alexander Graham Bell created the telephone but without the telephone it was just a good thought so there needed to be something that took on form that was in his mind so once it comes from his mind that took on form and started to express what was on the inside of his mind you see the definition of expression something that manifests or embodies something something that manifests and so you can't see electricity until there's an expression electricity has been here forever long before Benjamin Franklin discovered it you see Benjamin Franklin then a Creator create electricity he just discovered something that was here all alone but before he could Discover it he had to tap into something and bring it down to reality he needed something needed a desire to tap it and bring it down to where he was and that's the way that's how we got electricity you got panels you got light switches you got power plants it's somebody that is bringing electricity to reality so you can experience it that's the way it is with the things of God if you've got a desire there's no way to channel the thanks of God where it's not just at the church not just the prayer meetings not just the Bible studies not just on Sundays and Wednesdays we thank God for that but there's an expression that can live in our homes that can live on the job site we don't got to be a hypocrite when we're at the job site we're at the workplace there can be an expression the ghost the further than just the church setting farther than just the fellowship hall there can be an expression of God living every day of our life through this Fallen body through this Fallen body what made that man's testimony so great he was in a fallen condition that was changed the man that was born blind he was in a condition where he could not help himself so when somebody that could change his circumstances that was a great testimony come on somebody you know hurt somebody say I heard about as Tim Schultz said you know many people many young people want to go out and get addictions be addicted to drugs and alcohol so they could have a testimony he says that's a great testimony but it's a greater testimony when you're in the midst of perversion in the midst of drugs in the midst of alcohol and you're still not being defiled in the midst of a perverted day you're expressing the power of Jehovah come on somebody there's an expression on Earth letting the world know that there's a God you're lighting up pH by your expressions but there has to be an expression you see it takes an expression for people to see what is here and what they lack your silica Galatians 5 and 25 if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit in other words if you're proclaiming to live a certain way and your walk is different you've got the wrong spirit come on somebody if you claim to be a Christian and you're living a different life that means you're walking in a different Spirit but if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us talk in the spirit you know brother Branham says we claim to have Christ with us but he says the places you go will Christ feel welcome he says the things you look at the the books you read will Christ feel welcome they'll read those books with you come on somebody the music you listen to Will Christ feel welcome listening to that music if we're living in the spirit let us walk in the spirit let us talk in the spirit let our actions be walking in the spirit you see with the random types just like the moon he says we're to be like the Sun and the Moon he says whenever the sun goes down or goes away the mood comes up and reflects the same power that the sun has but it's in a lesser form it ain't that it's a different son or a Different Light it's the same Sun but in a lower form brother Branham says this oh I think of that I think of it in Genesis when God made the sun made the moon and now the Moon is the wife of the sun now when the Sun goes that goes away the Moon reflects the light of the sun is that right on the earth now when Jesus was taken away we are his bride which is the Moon to reflect the light of the Gospel we can't reflect it until he Shines on us and when we get the gospel shining on us then we shine it out to so send the light to the world it's my prayer Lord that we can reflect the light of the Son of God in his power and his resurrection in the fullness how marvelous but before the before the moon can reflect the power it's got to have its shining upon it and too many people want to reflect the power of God but it does not have the power of God on the inside you see it's impossible to live an overcoming life without the power of God it's impossible to live an undefiled life without Liberty First coming on the inside but once Liberty comes on the inside then it's impossible not to live an overcoming life what's the Bible say not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord so this goes beyond a mental power this goes beyond psychology this goes beyond an emotional work up to a reality where we're expressing the realities of Jesus Christ oh my look at Genesis 1 and 16. God made two great lights the greater the the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also and so it's something that either the God is putting into place though whenever it's daytime the Sun is up but at night time when it's dark the moon has a responsibility as well the Bible says we're living in the most darkest age that there is but he has a light on earth that is the moon that is reflecting the same power you may feel helpless you may feel hopeless you may feel like a nobody but God has equipped you to reflect the light in the middle of the darkness it's not your own light but it's the power of Jesus Christ expressing its Health through a body um I hope this is okay to save them it's the power of the Resurrection it's still on Earth calling the dead back to life you know I've given the example before I think a couple of times I this just stood out to me whenever I was studying again but whenever Christ went to Lazarus it says Lazarus come forth he brought him to life but he was still bound so in order for Lazarus to get Liberty he didn't of Jesus himself and didn't go up and take away the grave clothes here he commissioned somebody to go up and take the grave clothes off Wade looks to some preachers and he says loose him and let him go so it was the same power Jesus had these men now had to go and loosen Lazarus come on now it wasn't that they possessed the same the greatness of it but they had a portion of it and the same power that Jesus had to say Lazarus come forth they now had to go and lose him loose Lazarus and let him go come on now you know the example of the the the the the the the the cup you can go to the ocean get a cup full of water you don't possess all of the ocean but all that is in the ocean is now in China back up and watch brother Branham say all thy was in God he poured into Christ although it's in Christ he pours into the church it's a lesser form but the moon has a Ministry the Moon is proclaiming to the Earth no matter how dark it is there's still an expression come on somebody no matter how dark it is the sun is still shining and it don't matter where you're at this evening God has a light that is expressing itself in the darkest of the days in the middle of the Valley of the shadow of death God has a light that is expressing itself and you're expressing their life you look at Matthew Proverbs 14 hear the light of the world a city let us set on a hill and cannot be hit neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light shine before me that they may see your good works and glorify the Father which is in heaven and so now he has went from the from the sky is glorifying God the Earth is glorifying God now there's a body on Earth that has the same light that the sun has and now was glorifying God come on now how is that happening by expressing the same power that oh my what's the Bible say well the candle is not lit by an accident but it's lit for a purpose that is to light up the area that it is in and then he turns around and he says let your light shine before men don't hide that you're a Christian don't hide the true message believer but Express the light that you now see if it's ever a time not to be ashamed of this message this is the time if there's a time not to be ashamed of Malachi 4 this is the time you're the only expression of light that is on the earth let your light shine Show the power of this a message show how God can keep marriages together show how God can keep young people from pornography from drugs from alcohol Express the light you're the expression of Jesus Christ upon the Earth let your light man let your life shine before the man that they may see your good works it's not that your good works is what is saving you but your good works can save somebody else if you ever think about that if your good works can save somebody else what will your bad Works do think about it now if your good works that's the people know that there's a God what does our bad Works do it's a sobering plot but if we can live a life above reproach what is that doing for the gospel you see our life ain't to express theology it's not to express some intellectual conception but our life is to express Jesus Christ you see we're on Earth for more than just have a family to have children have a job uh that all comes with it but we are to be on earth to be an expression brother Branham says the word God's billboard our lives are to make the people thirsty for a living God he says her life ain't to express theology but it's to point to a living reality of Jesus Christ he says your God's eye you're you're God's advertising agent he says he was driving down the road one day and he sees the billboard he says on that billboard it had one word it said hungry and he says right below that it had to have words that says three miles ahead he says that wasn't to attract the ones that was looking for a car he says that wasn't to attract the ones that was looking for a hotel that was to attract the ones that was hungry and he says yeah you might not even been hungry but once you've seen that it put the thought in your mind come on somebody you know what I'm talking about you're to attract the ones that is hungry for the things of God you're to attract the ones that is thirsty and looking for a savior looking for a redeemer you know every time a man takes drugs he's looking for a satisfaction every time a prostitute goes with the man she's looking for something and you've got Hallelujah you've got what the world is looking for the Thirsty they're hungry be God's billboard you're the expression to let them know that God can deliver from drugs you're the express to let them know God can deliver from alcohol you're the expression to let them know God can deliver from pornography you're the expression of God on Earth Hallelujah you're God's billboard let that sink in your God's billboard there's many Billboards out there brother Branham says that he says surprisingly that was a good billboard he says most of the time there are Billboards of naked women uh cigarettes of drinking he says but this was a billboard that had a good purpose to it and there's many Billboards out there there's many Billboards that are pointing to Hell saying that I try drugs try alcohol try pornography but in the midst of the perversion there's a billboard that is letting the world know that there's a God on Earth brother Branham says this give us Faith Lord as a little rude expression a while ago that that I made about the power of God being in us and all the fibers to be the light of God in the darkness and sin had choked up in the little pores in a in in US of our soul let the Holy Ghost this morning spread forth in our being pressing Faith out into our outermost being that our whole bodies lives of so saturated with the power of God so people will see that Jesus Christ lives in his church her whole bodies the lives be saturated with the power of God so that the world will see that Christ lives in his church you see we don't need to force Christianity down people's throats we just need to be billboards we need somebody that's not ashamed of it you know remember the story brother Branham tells suburbs and the end upon he says there was a man he was good friends with he said he was one of the best hunters he says he would never get lost in the woods because he knew his directions but he was a cruel-hearted man he would just shoot funds for the fun of it he would shoot fonts to make brother Branham uh to get under her skin he says brother Branham says it's okay if you want to shoot a farm that's fine but don't shoot a bunch of him you know but either he goes on to tell the story that he was hunting one day and he and they were looking they couldn't find no deer and he looked behind him and burnt how this little call there was a phone call and he would blow that little whistle and it will make the sound of a fawn and he says he blew that whistle and there was that Doe that stepped out of the woods he says there was nothing there because they were hiding because they knew he was there but once he made that sound of the of the baby it stepped out into the open for all the world to see and brother Branham says Bert lifted up his gun he was like he pulled back the lever and was about to shoot and brother Branham says oh my how are you why are you so cruel he's thinking in his heart why is he so cruel why is he going to do that now he would say that brother Branham says that Bertman looked at him and say you're just a chicken-hearted preacher that's all you guys are as chicken-hearted preachers and brother Brandon says I can't look he turns around and he was waiting for the shot waiting for the shot waiting for the shot he looked back and the gun barrel was shaken he started to cry he threw down his gun and he says Billy tell me about this Jesus brother Branham says he didn't have to explain it to him there was an expression in that Mama the mama was willing to forsake all for her baby and that right there started to express to that man that was a cruel-hearted man the God loves him if animal now the nature can do that if a dog can do that what about the pride of Christ that has been set free from addictions um I hope this is okay tonight brother Branham says this each one of you from tonight on remember you are God's Billboards you're God's advertising agent now the world will look at you to see what Christ is so we don't want to smear a big lot of stuff on there that that testify of things that we really are not let's be that and then when we are that the world was seen the Christ is in you and me you know brother Branham says that there wasn't thousands that got saved at one time because of Stephen but thousands got saved because of Stephen you may see how does that work it was the Apostle Paul who was saw that was holding the coats of the ones that were stoning Stephen but in the midst of the persecution Stephen was still preaching he was still testifying and thou right there forever stood in the heart of Saul and it was because of Stephen that there was a many there's thousands people are still getting saved today because of the Apostle Paul come on now this wasn't a preacher he wasn't a Sunday school teacher he probably couldn't even sing but it was somebody that was expressing the power of God that there was a murderer there was a murdering Christians that gave us life to Christ because of that you see but before you can be an expression you gotta have that expression inside of us you see uh well we're an expression of what he has done for us but too many times we get laxed about it you see we're going to be celebrating Fourth of July you know that way I think it's Tuesday we're going to be celebrating Fourth of July and this day we reflect on what our forefathers did for us but you notice we didn't get a freedom of worship by accident we didn't get a freedom of speech by accident we didn't get all the freedoms that we have by accident we're not living under the brother the role of Britain by accident but it was some men that had a vision it was the man that says you know what I'm going to risk my life and stand up against the Tyranny you notice they wasn't giving their life for themselves because if they died they wasn't going to live in Liberty anyways but they was giving their life for the future Generations they was giving their life for the the for their families for for their wives for their children for their grandchildren they were they had the future of America in here in their mind and so right now we're expressing what they had in their mind but what is so sad about it is America is going down so fast and what happened is that today the Americans today have lost the Zeal that they had back then they've lost the fight that they had back then so all of the all of the men that lost their lives is now going down the tubes because some men today have lost this deal for it what happens if you forget where you come from you're going to go right back to it come on somebody watch the Bible tell why tell the children of Israel and beware lest you forget have I brought you out of the land of bondage beware if you forget you're going to go right back to it you look at America today it's going right back to where we come from and you see the same thing it's happening today we had a man called Christ Jesus give us a life for the cry for for the bride for the church but we have lost the Zeal that the that the early Apostles had and now what is happening we're going right back to the bondages that we was brought from whether the addictions that we was brought from if we're not careful we're going to lose the fights lose the Zeal just like America has lost the Zeal oh my you see that's why the devil's number one focus is taking your Liberty away because how can you claim the promises of God if you're bound how can you rejoice him the victory Of God if you're defeated how can you rejoice in Deliverance if you're still bound you look at Revelations 3 and 21 to him that overcometh will I grant the sins with me and my throne even as I also have overcome and sat down with my father in his throne that's why we have to have Liberty because without Liberty there's no overcoming power you see so the devil is coming after us to make us look warm to make us hormone to make us powerless because in that condition there is no Liberty you see the when a country loses the Liberty they lose their Spirit whenever they lose their Spirit they lose their Zelda facts when they'll lose their Zeal to fight they just become pushovers you notice whenever a country is defeated by another country they lose their language the the country that took them over they now become their language they're now their Enforcer they're now telling them what to do it's not that they want to but they're under a thumb of another oh come on now and that's what happens you can come to church every day of your life and listen to a tape read your Bible but without Liberty you're always going to be under the rule of another you're you're talking like you don't want to talk you're looking the things you don't want to look at you're under other you're under the thumb of another but the same Liberty that fell in your early experience can fall again and bring you out and give you Liberty once again you see that's exactly what the devil is trying to keep you from if he can keep you from your Liberty you can't express the Liberty that God has on Earth remember you're the only expression that there's a God on Earth so if he keeps you away from Liberty you can express the power of God oh my you see you you start to go back you start to drift to things you would never go to your CED he uses innocent things to take Liberty Away by the Branham says then every little jot and everything must be faithful always a little Vine the little fox the spools the vine sometimes you leave it's not the big things you do it's the little things you leave undone remember a chain is only a strongest at its weakest link so he says it's not the big things that you've done it's the little things that you haven't done it's the little complexes you haven't destroyed it's the little bitterness you kept alive it's the critical spirit you refuse to deal with it's those little things that that the devil is throwing upon you that is taking your Liberty away and you don't realize it at the time but the roots are getting deeper they're getting deeper they're getting deeper and overnight you just wake up and you realize that you're bounds you're addicted and it's because the little things are starting to put root in your garden you see you know our Gardens out there right now you're not going to get the rocks out of there by accident you're not going to get the weights out of there by accident but if you keep the weeds in there it's going to take over the garden it's going to take over the plants it's going to take over the fruits it's not that you put in there but they got their unaware and you did not do you do not you wasn't responsible and pulling them out and the devil's going to try to throw anything he can to mess up the garden and so your fruit ain't the fruits of the spirit but your fruits is of something else you see if our fruits it's not of the spirit then we're under the wrong spirit I know that the Dad read the scripture this morning but Psalms 112 and 14 unto the upright there will rise of light in the darkness he is gracious full of compassion and righteous and so this just struck me he is gracious full of compassion and righteous so the influence that the light brings is putting a different action than what the darkness brings if you're following me now they the influence that is now arising upon the church is another influence than what the world has and now the righteous the gracious and they're compassionate they didn't get that way by accident but there was an influence that they come under and our actions are not to express the flesh but we're to come under another influence and express the power of Jesus Christ you see we have to conquer our emotions conquer our feelings conquer our flesh because our flesh will give us a complex well I'm not pretty enough I'm fine I'm too fat I'm too skinny it ain't right there he's taking away the Liberty that God has put on you you know my complex whenever I was younger was I was so dark everybody thought I was a Mexican and that was the complex that I fought with and that was keeping me down whenever I would get up the scene how to fight that complex when I get up the preach out of five complex and if I let my flesh control me it would take my Liberty away because I thought I look like a Mexican it was something that the devil seen a weakness he seen something that I was tenderized towards and he was using that to pull my Liberty away and the devil would do that anyway you can he can he will come and say you're too smart you're too dumb you're too pretty you're too ugly you're too skinny you're too fat if we don't control our emotions he's taking away our Liberty and if he takes away the Liberty you're not expressing the light of God come on somebody we're not to express our emotions or feelings we're not to express our flesh but words of Express the Living God inside of the flesh that is proving that he's the same yesterday today and forever you see what happens in a complex jealousy will come and then since you can't look like that one you're not going to tear that one down because you can't be like that one something innocent that starts out to be your best friend a complex is your best friend that one don't like it so don't go talk to them you're going to get hurt so don't talk to that one oh that one don't like you better stay away from that one the complex is your best friend then what happens that complex ain't just happy with hurting you now you've got to Heart the other person that you've got a complex with and now you're going to look at that one and say you know what I'm not pretty like her so I'm going to tear her down I can't play basketball like that one can so I'm gonna tear him down it's a complex hope you're following me tonight it's a complex that is being brought on by the flesh but we've got the power by the spirit that's tear down every complex every insecurity every anxiety where we can express then not the power of the flesh but the power of Jesus Christ you see a complex I think I given this multiple times but a complex puts you in a Walt City you know I think I've given this here multiple times so just bear with me a complex you know that in the Bible talks about when Samaria was sieged and inside of this city was a bunch of people inside of the walls because there was somebody they thought was on the outside that was trying to kill them and inside of this city the famers started to take place and a drought started to take place because they cut off the water supply they cut off the food resources because they thought somebody was out there and you notice that the Bible puts this scene the Bible says that it got so bad inside of the city that the mothers were eating their own children you see that's what happens in a complex you're trying to protect yourself but you're hurting the ones around you you're hurting the family you're hurting your children you're hurting your life you're gonna come on somebody that's what a complex is you draw up within yourself trying to protect yourself this city was trying to protect themselves but at the same time their family was suffering they're the loved ones were suffering because they thought something was trying to hurt them I'm preaching now that's exactly what a complex does but you notice what happens there were some lepers that were setting on by the gates they wasn't allowed to be and be inside be inside the city with the rest of them there was some Castaways there were some nobodies but they had enough guts about them to say shall we sit here till we die if we go in the city we're going to be killed if we go outside of the gates we're going to be killed let us make a choice let's turn away from the city from death and go outside of the walls I think it's time that we make a decision I'm not turning back to my complex I'm not turning back to the flesh am I going to sit here till I die or am I going to find Liberty and the Bible says they walked outside of the city and there was nobody there there was inside of a city in a famine inside out of a city with the uh with a drought inside of a city eating their babies and there was nothing on the outside and let me say this the pastor loves you your sister loves you your Daddy loves you it's a complex that is built up a wall City keeping you from your Liberty but are you going to sit there till you die walk out of the city tonight walk out of the gates and accept your Liberty you don't gotta stay in that anxiety you don't got to stay in the complexes that the devil is throwing upon you you have to walk out you're going to make a decision you see those lepers do we're going to sit here and die why do I sit here whenever I can make an advance to my freedom human they might not have got there right away but they was making good answers their money got scared halfway there and stop it says I don't know should we do this but there was father alone than what they was 10 minutes ago oh and they kept on walking oh I don't know there might be somebody out there but there were father alone than what they just were and every time they took a step there was getting closer to their Liberty that was getting closer to food that was getting closer to water you might have to press your way through that complex but every step you take you're getting closer to your Liberty you might have to press your way past that anxiety but every step that you take your stepfather away from that and closer to your Liberty and the Bible says you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and why is this a message it's the truth that has come to the bride to let you know there's no Spirit there's no chain there's no addiction there's no complexes that can keep you away from your Liberty but you've got to make a choice and see I'm not going to sit here Penny longer I'm making a step closer to my Liberty so that I can express I can express the power of God brother Josh that brother did me wrong that sister Demi wrote that one did me wrong who cares come on somebody who cares if they did you wrong the Bible says forgive them the Bible says not just seven times but 70 times seven you know what that means that's a lot of forgiven that we got to do in order to get out of the city I'm preaching now so in order to get out of your city you're gonna have to forgive somebody in order to get out of that City the step you might have to take is to come up to a brother and say I'm sorry I've had an art against you but somebody else they might in order to get out of a city couldn't walk down and say you said something to hurt my feelings I need to make this right so I can get out of my city no matter where you're at the same now you've got to make advances to get out of that City because inside of the city is death inside of the walls is death but outside of the walls is a liberty outside of the walls is fellowship outside of the walls is a freedom of worship you want to worship God like you'd never have before come out of the walls you want to rejoice and shout and dance like never before come out of the walls you want to see God inside of your life inside of your family come out of the walls come out of the walls and express a higher power you may feel surrounded remember the story of Elijah he and her servant come out of the house and they were surrounded by the syrians and the servants that my master were about to die were surrounded there's there's a lot of them and he stops and Elijah says there's more with us than there are within he said what have you seen the armies out there and there's only two of us and he says Lord open this boy's eyes his eyes come open and there was Chariots of Fire all along the mountaintops thus surpassed the armies of the syrians and if we can just realize that there's Chariots of fires all around us brother Branham says this what the love of God I have God is doing right now moving around in this building what an atmosphere this is an atmosphere that I wish I could live in forever for this sweet humble feeling what is it angels are walking up and down the aisles all around these posts around this tent on the outside angels of God are moving their great wings are spread you may say well that's just for brother Branham brother Branham says the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always now maybe so not hope so but whenever this message is being preached there is a liberty that is wanting to be expressed through your life through your heart the Bible says in second Corinthians 3 and 17 now the Lord is the spirit and we're the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there was Freedom there's healing the captives are set free anxiety is broken second Timothy 1 and 7 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power of love and of a sound mind so the fear that is trying to trap Your Mind Trap your body the spirit of the Lord has full control over so that you now can express the love whether Branham says this you don't want you see the the trumpet sounded and he can go free it's God's grace it's the Year of Jubilee the completion the day of sin is over brother I tell every one of you servants seeing tape invisible audience everyone that are serving sin the day of sin is over Jesus died you don't have to serve sin no more he says you don't have to be bowed down the Creeds and denominations he who the son has set free is free indeed if you want to be free in the sun Cut Loose from all those things and serve him come on Amen if you want to be free you've got to cut it you've got to make a choice you may say brother Josh how I now go Thee I thought the Lord delivers us he does but you got to allow him to true come on now you've got to allow him to be your portion you've got to allow him to be your God you've got to allow him to be the Lord Mighty Empire of the Bible says in Psalms 24 and 8 who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle he's open-minded eyes he's open death ears he's seen that he he's caused the cripples to walk he's brought back the Dead but should God allow him to work in your life it's an incredible thing that the maker of heavens and earth the one that said let there be light let there be a son that cause Lazarus from the dead and we can contain him in our own lives think about it you contain him are you you keep him from working the miraculous in your life because you refuse hope this is okay we keep him in a little room and say you can work in this but don't touch my bitterness you you you you could work on this part but don't touch my hard feelings don't touch that heart don't do this right there you're keeping him from bringing forth a liberty but the Bible says that wherefore God also has exalted him and given him a name which is above every name fill up the name of Jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven things and Earth and things under the Earth Romans 8 and 37 ain't all these things we are more than conquerors through him that love this I know these are scriptures we all know but there's a true power to it if we can just catch it if we can let the maker of heavens and earth inside of my ship let him control Peter you've got to stop trying to control the ship it was Peter that says I'm a fisherman I can do this and he quickly realized he did not have the means to bring forth the Liberty but there was one in the boats that have the ability to bring forth Liberty you remember the story when the waves and the the the winds and the storms are blowing rain was falling Peter was trying to control the ship and the maker of the Winds was in the boat oh Peter had to do was let him control it you see that's the thing though we don't like giving up is control peanut butter Branham says you you uh me and whenever somebody's in a car and you're in the passenger seat and you ever you feel like they're going too fast you're stomping on the floor he says you're trying to steer he says you like to be in control of things but many times in order to get our Liberty we got to lose control and say God deal with this I can't do it because remember before you can be an expression you've got to have Liberty for yourself remember the the quote by the Bible talks about in Mark Mark 11 and 2. and he saith unto them go your way into the village over against you and as soon as you be entered into it you shall find a cold side whenever I and we're on every man sets loose him and bring him and if any man say unto you why do you why do you this say that the Lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him hither and they went their way found the coats hide by the door without in a place where two ways met and they loose him but you notice that code had a purpose long before he was ever on the earth you looked at Luke 4 and 18 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind the set of Liberty them that are bruised it was this coach's responsibility to bring forth Liberty you look at Zechariah 99 Rejoice greatly o Daughter of Zion shout oh daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just having salvation lowly riding upon an ass upon a coat of the fold of an ass but before he could bring Liberty to the captive he had to be set free come on now he was predestinated he was called he was chosen among all of the donkeys to bring forth Liberty but he was bound still but he needed the preacher Christ didn't go up and loose him but he commissioned somebody else to to go up and loose them loose their coat so the Liberty can be brought this is the preacher tonight I might not be the physical body of Jesus Christ but we're under a commission to lose you and let you go so that you can fulfill the purpose you're not that that coats way wasn't on Earth to be bound his whole life he was on Earth to bring forth Liberty you're on Earth to bring forth Liberty But first you got to be liberated Moses couldn't Express Liberty until he was loosed what happened the burning bush had what Moses needed the Liberty that Moses needed was in the burning bush but the Liberty didn't just stay in the burning bush but delivered it I was inside of the burning bush come on side of Moses and now the Liberty started to express itself he would go up and say Pharaoh let my people go it was the Liberty that he experienced he was now expressing whenever he come to the Red Sea he says you know what I am liberated and I have caught I'm called to liberate the people he will he would stretches his staff over the Red Sea because he was liberated whenever they needed water and he would smack the rock because he was liberated whenever he would they they needed Manna From Heaven he did a favor because he was liberated the armies of Gideon they was outnumbered but they was just expressing the Liberty the Gideon had found behind the red the The Wine Press you notice the message that the angel brought liberated Gideon from complexes from insecurities you're like a judges Sixth and fifth six and fifteen and he said unto me oh my Lord where will shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in Manasseh I am the least in my father's house and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee Thou shalt Smite the midianites as one man he called him a mighty man of Valor that message liberated him from his complexes that was the Liberty that David found that liberated the armies of Israel you notice the Bible says that after that after David cut off Goliath's head the Bible says that the men of Israel seen that and chased the Philistines they chased the Philistines out of the land because of because David found a liberty he couldn't have done that unless he was anointed by by the prophet but once he found the Liberty the children of Israel found their Liberty you look at first Samuel 17 and 51 therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine took a sword drew it out of the sheath therefore it slew him cut off his head there with when the Philistines saw their Champion was dead and they fled and when the men of Israel and of Judah Rose and shouted and pursued the Philistines and so they came to the valley what was then they seen somebody with Liberty being expressed that they said you know what if David did it I can do it too I'm going to express Liberty like David and you see the Bible says we're bought with the price there was a man that paid the price for our Liberty and since he a liberty we now can have Liberty and the Bible says glorify God in your body in your body in your Fallen flesh glorify God in your Fallen Humanity glorify God in your Fallen States glorify Gods because there was one that brought Liberty but you got to fight for it this ain't something that's going to come while you're sitting at a picnic you've got to fight for your Liberty remember the remember Switzerland was being attacked there wasn't a fighting people they didn't have an army they didn't have weapons or they had with stones and and rakes and shovels but there was willing to fight for their Liberty and there stood a man that says today I give my life for my country and you know how the story goes he ran down the hill and he went to the deepest of the Spears and said make way for Liberty from the brainum sets he threw Spears into his chest and says Make Way for Liberty and right there brother Branham says that made a hole in the front lines and then the rest of the army was behind them with their clubs with their with their with their pitchforks and they swung the battle and they'd never had another war in Switzerland since well was it a man found Liberty and once he found Liberty the rest of the armies found Liberty Christ has given a slippery you still gotta fight the armies of Switzerland they still had a fight but now there was a hole that they could fight through and my brother praying that makes a drama he dramatizes it and he says that was a minor thing he says the children of Adam the race of Adam was up against the walls they couldn't get past the sin barrier but there stood up a man that says today I give my life for Liberty and he says Christ ran to the deepest of the Spears and says Make Way for Liberty and he says he put a hole and they are I put a hole in that military and he says fights with what you've got we're not going to get Liberty by accident Christ gave us Liberty but we gotta fight for it we've got to be willing to press and press press through the Mind battles press through the complexes press through the anxiety press through the bitterness so that we can experience and express Liberty as the musicians come we got to express it before we can express it we got experience it Galatians 5 and 1 Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage he didn't say lay there in the Liberty set there in the Liberty he says you're going to have to stand Stand Fast it's not going to be easy there's going to be times you feel like running but you got to make a stand how did Stonewall Jackson get his name Stonewall history says though whenever everybody was running the enemy was approaching his men was running and they turned around and Stonewall Jackson was still standing there and one man says mine he's standing like a stone wall it was in the midst of the heat of the battle that he refused to turn around and run I left out brother Harry brought forth the the armor he had the breastplate the shoes the shield the soil the helmet but there's nothing on your back you got everything that you have need of to stand and fight but once you turn around and run you're on your own but if you stand fast in the Liberty we're not giving any inch to the devil not the complexes not to insecurities not to bitterness but we're standing fast in the Liberty now God has given us amen can we stand this evening [Music] free delivered peace and favor and right now is the [Music] day I've been changed I've been changed and I've

going to take root and be harder to deal with but this is the time this is the hour to get rid of every every stumbling block every hindens hindrance every spirit that is not like Christ every friend relationship whatever it is that there's something that's keeping you from your Liberty let's throw it out throw it out let's make a stand amen can we sing this again as we turn up to our pastor
