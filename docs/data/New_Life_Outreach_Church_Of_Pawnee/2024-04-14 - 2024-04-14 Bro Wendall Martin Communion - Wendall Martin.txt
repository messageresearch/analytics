beside me I give my life to the pot hand Call Me Guide Me lead me walk beside me I give my life to the Potter [Music] hand amen that's my prayer my desire I I remember thank you growing up I think it was Sister Thelma that showed us a video of a a Potter um making a pottery and I believe he was telling a story about it and as he begin to go the video shows him making this Potter how it starts out and think about 45 minutes into the video this Pottery was he was done wasn't in the fire or nothing yet it was just he got it done and it looked looked beautiful and all of a sudden this Potter that took him an hour to make in front of this audience he crushes it just smashes it down you hear the whole audience and he begin to show that the Lord would take our lives and put us through the wheel and take out all the edges and the roughness and sometimes even if it takes destroying us to get us where he needs to get us and at the end of the video he showed us a a pottery that was through the fire and it turned out to be this beautiful piece of pottery the most prettiest vase or vase however you say it was because it went through the fire and sometimes we don't like being put on The Potter's Wheel we don't like to to have the the Brokenness and the heartache but at the end of all of it he's making something beautiful and I believe on this being a communion night this could be a time where God takes off all the rough edges takes out all of the pride and things in our lives and at the end of it all makes us something beautiful amen I had you stand you may be seated once again this is an old song but I'm going to try it it's been on my heart for some time and I think sister Tracy used to sing it but it's called it's my desire to live for Jesus and I've had it on my heart for for the last few weeks now I think a it's my desire to live for Jesus it's my [Music] desire to be like him oh yes oh my though of I fa him and brought him shame it's my [Music] desire to live for him I love this if you could see where Jesus brought me from to where I am today you would know the reason why I love him so oh now you can take this world is wealth and riches I don't need or sa it's my desire oh to live for him is that your desire it's my desire to help someone today someone who might have [Music] fail to see the way how many can relate to this I too was lost so long but I found my way to God it's my desire it's my desire to live can you you stand to help me sing it now if you could see where Jesus brought me from if you could see where Jesus brought me from to where I am today you would know the reason why I love him Soul oh you can take this whole world is wealth and riches I don't need or F it's my desire to live for [Music] he as they continue to play that softly now like to go to prayer brother Michael would you mind coming and and leading us in prayer as one from Sister Carol says please pray for my reservation is that right reservation young boys are running around the reservation shooting people they don't like ages 10 through 16 my so let's just remember this the Lord sees all he knows everything amen if you have a need upon your heart just make it known I I know tonight my prayer is Lord I I want a closer walk I want a this communion to be a fresh start amen God bless you now brother Michael amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we just thank you for your presence here with us this evening God and come to mend the hearts Lord speak to our spirits and just bring us in your presence and Lord we come to the portion of service where we just lift up the needs and the things that we're praying for and we're Earnest about father Lord you see the different requests brother Steve and Laura Martin father still grieving over the loss of their son and I would pray Lord that you would continue to be there we know that you've been with them and Lord you've kept them through trials and Lord we just pray for their family and father for brother brother the Applegates Lord sister Betty and we would just ask that you would be with them and Lord our sister Carol has brought up her people there on the reservation Lord just a lot of things going on Lord you see where human nature is taking complete control ey for ey Lord and I would pray that your presence would come Lord as many times there's been a cry Lord that you've sent somebody their way or your spirits come by and just talk to the people and you would just bring them to truth and a purpose in life that you are alive and you're well and that what they're searching for in life is you that only you can feel that Gap and father as we have taken this time and get ready for the coming of your word Lord I would just pray that you would be with us in our communion that your presence just be here to take all the things out of our way that we could draw closer to you we ask these things in Jesus name amen as the man of God comes can we sing that verse one again it's my desire to live yes it's my desire it's my desire to be like him though off I fail him yes I have and brought him [Music] shame it's my desire to live for him if you could see you could see where Jesus brought me from to where I am today I love this part then you would know the reason why I love him so for you [Music] oh yeah to live for him if you could see where Jesus brought to where I am today then you would know the real reason why I love him [Music] so oh you can take this world it's wealth and riches I don't need Earth F it's my desire oh yeah to live for him amen that's truly my [Music] [Applause] desire only the elect have that desire I I should say there's there will be many that have a desire the foolish virgins have the desire but there's something about the bride of Christ it's it's life or death it's it's the holy ghost or nothing it's being right with God and wanting his life in in us and every every moment that we live and if his presence isn't with us we get scared I think that's the kind of relationship we have we're not one of those foul women of Le osia that tell her husband what what she thinks and where to get off and we respect him and love him with everything that we've got we love him it's our heart's desire to serve him we were created for it and so as we come here to leay Osa or come here to the service tonight and knowing that we have been brought out of Le osia and called into that relationship with the Lord I I I just think communion service is going to be awesome tonight because he loves his girl too he loves you more than he loves anything else aren't you glad for that tonight why don't we look here I'm not going to preach too long to you tonight I I know these can be lengthy services and and I I I just didn't think uh this morning to to bring that up to the to to 4:00 uh for uh for the Cochrans we usually try to do that and um um because these Services can go a little lengthy but um but I'll try to keep it as short as possible amen good to see brother William and sister Sharon and uh so how's your back you feeling better a little yeah well that service go well this morning wonderful wonderful glad to hear that amen well we prayed for you this morning and I I felt for you preaching with a hurt back amen um here in in Colossians the 3D chapter the first verse put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved vowels of Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be ye thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom and teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns spiritual songs singing with Grace in your heart with uh to the Lord and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I put Christ in there giving thanks to God and the father by him wives submit yourselves into your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged servants in obey in all things your Masters according to the flesh not with thy Service as men Pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing God whatsoever ye do do it heartedly as to the Lord and not unto men knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inherit itance for ye serve the Lord Christ but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he ha done and there is no respect of persons let's go to the Lord in prayer father we come to you tonight we're asking that your Holy Spirit would just settle Among Us and as we do some self-inspection of our hearts we take hisp apply your blood we want Lord to come into this communion service Lord with our hearts pure before you and we're asking father that you would just take us all as we think of what you have done for us and oh God we don't want to ever take it for granted we ask Lord that you would be pleased in everything that is done and said in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated and what I thought we would do tonight I just got I I have got buus of of U uh love uh quotes that that I have um accumulated over the years and and I have sort of um been classified as the love preacher I preached a lot on love and and uh uh and so I don't want to take a very too very long a time tonight but I thought uh more than just preaching but just simply maybe read a few scriptures and and quotes and then comment on them because I think understanding as the Apostle Paul would say we are not ignorant the Satan's devices amen uh because we have a reality that we have found in the Lord Jesus Christ and by the way we um we want to keep uh brother Harry and and and sister Stephanie I guess sister Stephanie she's On's having the baby and uh uh they they they went in to get uh sister Stephanie checked out and so uh we want to be in prayer for for them we're sure excited for that baby amen but um you know a lots of lots of times when the Lord saves us um well not a lots of times we all came broken we all came we all came shattered pieces and and and the Lord would and and the Lord came and he he knows how to heal the broken pieces of our lives uh Isaiah 61 I love Isaiah 61 and Jesus quoted the spirit of the Lord God is upon me he hath anointed me to preach uh unto the Good Tidings unto the meek he sent me to bind up the the Brokenhearted he has uh to Proclaim Liberty unto the captives and the opening of the prison cells to them that are bound and and and we we are thankful for that there's there's a lots of times and not necessarily saying that's here but there's too many times that uh too many try to serve the Lord with scars and I believe the Lord Jesus can bring such a healing to where amen that that broken that broken uh spirit that that that the love the golden oil of divine love has fallen out of I believe that God can can fix the little hole and God can can make that so pure because we are New Creation creation we're not we're not the old things have passed away and the old and the and everything has become new we are not that old woman doing our own thing we have come unto Christ and he has made us new we we remember you you remember they ate Cal bride amen and how that uh and this was this is a true story over there in Africa and how that um you know um the king of the tribe or the prince of the tribe was getting married and and um you know he had been it had been known that he had been looking for a wife and and um um but one day he had and there was a lot of people entertaining him a lot of girls a lot of men you know the uh really really trying to promote their daughters and things and and so um you know he and there was a lot of lot lot of pretty girls out there but there was this one girl he was on a business meeting at one time and and as he traveled he he saw this girl that that that came through the marketplace and had her head uh hung bowed low and she she looked like she looked like she wasn't all there she hair was all messed up head low and Raggedy and and just just scooting around looking through the corners of her eyes and and wherever she went and and and then she laughed but there was something that about that girl that caught the attention of this young prince and this Prince began to look around and ask around and see where this girl is and everyone knew her and said well she's really a strange girl so um told him where she lived and he went and talked to the father and asked that he could talk to her and as he talked to the girl and um uh begin to uh you know Express his his feelings toward her and how she would he would like to get to know her better and she was just you know and embarrassed and trying to fix her hair and after he talked to her the the the dad says what are you doing talking to her he says I've got other girls and um and he says you've you've got enough money for the diary to for one of these other girls this girl's not going to have much of a diary uh you know I mean I I understand I'm not you know you you you you give diary over there in the in in in African I I hear they still do it today but uh this story here they had cows you would give so many cows you know if you found a girl that that you like you'd give you know you'd give two cows and and so he was expecting just a a little just just a small cow for this girl and uh and and so um you know the dad says I don't know what you see in here I've got other daughters and I know you're you you appear to be a wealthy man that you can you could pay the price the diary and he says sir I'm not interested in in Diaries I'm not interested I'm I'm interested in the girl and and they they they talked a little bit and and before you know it he says he gave her the promise he says I'm want to marry you after after a course of time I want to marry you and and she says I I you want to marry me my sisters are pretty they're all running around here and here I am and she says something's wrong with me I've been overlooked by all the men I have nothing to offer I I'm I I wish I wish um um you wouldn't humiliate me like this if he says I I I love you so well he marries the girl and um um and when it came time for the diary and and and he he went and and was making the deal with the father no one else was was supposed to be allowed to to take it they sat down and um and they are negotiating and and the father is is very clear that that um he want the girl is worth at least two cows and and and the man looked at the woman or looked at the man and said listen I'm going to give you eight cows for that woman now that that woman was ease dropping in on the conversation the father looked at her and said listen there has nobody in in in our community has ever been given there is nobody in this tribe that has ever been given eight cows I don't even know of wealthy men ever giving eight cows for a bride he says I'm given eight cows for that Bride for my my bride she started crying and and so well the uh the one who was writing the story uh that that knew the story he wanted to he wanted to check check this story out to see that it was true and so he he flies in he he goes back in in the in the jungle and and he finds this tribe he asked around where this girl is where this Prince is and they said oh yeah you're talking about Miss so and so and they said oh yeah she is a she is quite she's quite the lady and and they say uh what do you mean we're talking about the same ones oh yes and here she comes now now and as she is coming as she is coming she's got those that are helping her and she's holding her head up so high and her and her her hair is beautiful this man that wrote the story says she was absolutely gorgeous this woman was beautiful she says hey this can't be the woman this is the woman that no one wanted he said oh it's the woman he says 'well what happened he said the story was this when the woman found out that her man was willing to pay eight cows something that has never been known in all of the tribes around willing to pay that money for her it gave her confidence and her man letting her know how much she was loved and how special she was has built her confidence up in such a way that she holds herself in the public like a princess I I I I think that's a wonderful thing you see we don't want to experience God on the basis of just fire Insurance missing hell this is a relation relationship it's a bride relationship between this is when God become a man so that he could come and redeem us he didn't just redeem us with a little bit of money he redeemed us with his entire life that's right he gave his life for us amen and so we we are we we are it sets us apart because of his love for us we're not going through life bitter we don't want to go through life with hurts and unforgiveness we don't want to go through life in in those kinds of deals we are a prince we're princes we're we are we're the bride you there's many types sons of God we are the bride of Christ we have been lifted up into a position of great power and authority and as we think about this we want to amen the remember the power of divine love and and you you look there at what the Isaiah 30 and 26 it says moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun now this is this is when God's coming in to heal and touch his people the light of the moon shall be as the light of the Sun the light of the sun shall be Sevenfold as of the light of seven days and in the day in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his his people and health The Stroke of their womb he he come and he has so healed us he has so touched us he has so moved himself within us amen and living his life through us that that we are no longer downtrodden but now we hold our head high as the very Queen of Heaven Can you say Amen Isaiah 61 one would say I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my God for he hath clothed me that's Isaiah 61 And1 uh and for he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation he hath covered me with the Robes of righteousness as a bridegroom deth himself with ornaments and a bride adorne herself with jewels can you say amen Isaiah 45 and 24 surely shall one say in the Lord have I righteousness and strength so when we when we look at this amen it we we have a there the there there should never be a a a bitter heart no matter how bad we've had it in life no matter how bad our circumstances are right now now there should never be bitterness in our heart because of the one who has found us who has looked upon us and has esteemed us worthy and valuable unto him he is the one who has put the qualifications on us I didn't put my own qualification you didn't put your own qualification he qualified you me to be his very own that's right he's our beloved can you say Amen so walking around with bitterness walking around with a hurtful Spirit walking around broken is not becoming of a child of God because he has come to set us free he has come to menend the Brokenhearted he has come to to do that and when we come and we heal the way God wants us to heal then it's easy for us in our queenly position in our queenly H affections we step into that role as intercessor as Queen asra and we go before the king and we say listen my people are going to die there is an in we become we become the epitome of divine grace we become the reflection of the throne room because we ourselves have been called into that we ourselves Hallelujah the scripture says that Esther amen put on her royal of garments as she walked into the throne room to talk to the king why now she didn't quite see herself that way remember that Malachi or Mori had to tell her said listen you've got to go and she says I can't go in I'll die he says he says you're the queen yeah you were an orphan you were a Jewish girl you were a slave but you're no longer a slave you're now a queen now go in there she says I'll die no one's ever went in there Uninvited but when she put the go royal garments on she had to take off she had to take off her her her Bond's garments she had to take off her orphan garments she had to take off everything else and had to walk in before the king and the King says I'll give you up to half the kingdom why because the king loved her and she could do this praise the Lord now I think we is as we look here amen there that don't forget your position the prophet says the problem with us today is many times we forget our position and brother brandham would would would would talk about uh in 62 putting on the whole armor of God and he's talking about your fellow man your your brother he says he says you don't know what's beating beneath that that little old skin there the Holy Spirit may be tabernacled there see you must never do that we must be brothers and treat a man no matter if he's in the wrong still treat him nice be nice to him if you haven't got that Spirit then there's something wrong Jesus was nice to those who were ugly to him see you must be Christians full of love ready to help any race color creed anywhere anytime we must be that way that's Christians that's the way Christ would have us to be a Christian is to be Christlike what can you say Amen spiritual adoption he said he said here's a point I want to drive home and may the Holy Spirit take it to every heart of you Believers just because you're a Believer certainly you have eternal life or everlasting life God said so but but would you want to just get in as job said by the skin of your teeth would you want to come before the father and and the talent that he's give every one of you and as being NE negligent you just didn't use it you you let something else stand in your way you let Petty things that meant nothing to you after all after all the fusses and stews and arguments and church differences and and difference take the meekness and gentleness from your life would you want to stand before the father like that I don't believe you would I don't believe that you would do it neither would I die can you say amen amen so so what he's saying is is remember who we are and what God has called us to be now Divine love is what separates us from everything else around us now where is Satan going to where is Satan always going to fight Us in in a marriage or in a in the in the church or uh uh in the family amen it's always going to be on love Satan will always come in and try to sow bitterness or try to seow Discord or try to sow you know whatever he wants to do and the thing is it's always the devil most the times when when you know a a fuss you by the time the fuss is all over with you forgot what you started arguing about at the beginning anyways it wasn't really important but it was a devil that was anointing the situation and and and trying to and just just coming in and rattling uh trying to Rattle us and the thing is is God's called us to be sons and daughters and to cast out Devils when they come around can you say amen he does that now are we are we guilty yeah many times we are guilty many of times but that's why we've got blood that's why we come right back and say God give us the grace I want love to reain in my life regardless I want I I want to the the the eight cows has already been given for me I I know how special I am to you I and I want you to know how special you are to me I've called you or you've called me and now I it is my privilege to live for you and to represent you as a prince you're my husband and I am going to represent your values amen you hold your head up and I'm going to hold my head up I now belong to royalty well glory to God well that that deserves that that deserves the hand clap amen amen now now my wife my wife she's not one of those uh she deserves she deserves a 100 cows but uh uh you know she what I I I said I promised her the moon and gave her a house amen and so amen but but royalty when it comes to royalty this this the little ring that she's got and and and her dress that she has that's nothing compared to what the GL God's love for you and for me is it it it it's incredible can you say Amen but we it's so easy for us to get out of that now I this is communion and I'm not I'm I I am not going to hold you long whatsoever it's so easy for us to get dry if we're not in that relationship with the Lorden I think I think this this this relationship has got to keep plenty of blood amen has got to keep as got we got to remember what what the bread means and what the wine means and what that blood stood for that was the price that was paid for you and it's so important that you understand that you're not the only one Josh is is just as much a part of that body as brother John and and sister April is just as much a part of that body as as as as Kaye and and and we are we are all we we we are all a part of that and we have been baptized into that body and there is none of us that are going to see uh things eye to eye we're not we we we're just we're we we we just not amen we we ain't going to see things out to eye but that's okay we don't have to see things eye to eye it's not important that we see things eye to eye what is important is that that love that the father has shown towards us or our our lover has shown towards us that we have that same love one to another because we are all members of that one body and we love we love you you know I might think you're I might think you're just as goofy with your opinion as as can be and you can think the same thing towards me but the thing is the blood that was shed for me is the same blood that is shed for you and we walk together in harmony only with that word if there was not the harmony of the word where would we be today amen amen now brother brandham would say he would say now we find out along this road that after they had got this uh like this they came to Horeb he's talking about Israel ho re EB horb he says and let's break that name down that's where the name horb means a dry place or a desert when we get out of fellowship with one another in the church and out of fellowship with the Holy Spirit it brings us to a dry place a desert nothing alive everything's got stickers on it a desert a piece a little piece of cactus with with that that with that sticker on it do did you know that uh what that is that's a precious Tender Leaf little that's a little tend precious little Tender Leaf that hasn't had no water it's just wound itself up so tight till it's a sticker and when you see somebody like that maybe it's a precious so that that could be watered right would have would have been a tender little Lea or something but instead of that it's wound itself up till it's a sticker just a punching at everyone you know and finding fault and the only thing it needs is just water that's all it just needs a Revival or a breaking up a refreshing from the Lord it'll unfold its little self it'll if you'll just put it to the water but that's where the them who live in that place has to suffer with that condition of that place and those who desire to live in that kind of an atmosphere of where everything's just punching and fussing and quiring and stewing like that well you just live under that atmosphere that's all but we don't have to we don't have to live there it's not necessary for us to stay there amen why because we're an eight Cal bride better than the eight Cal Bride come on amen hallelujah now I'm not calling y'all cows I'm saying amen so so praise the Lord remember the blood and forgiveness amen so the we've got we we do these and because the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit can only work through those vessels as I was preaching this morning that tender heart before God and that as as we read and there's there's there's several quotes in there where brother bradam says there'll be no love except for among the elect no love whatsoever so so why would we allow the enemy to come and to and us to feed on that when God's got an oasis when God's got the River of Life so that you can be a tree not a shrub not a cactus but a tree that brings forth your fruit in its season and your Leaf never Withers why why would we want to be a cactus and prickly and and argument of and and when when we can be a well of Living Water why would we want to be anything else but the Life of Christ flowing through us hallelujah can you say Amen you see you don't have to live there it's not necessary for us to live there amen we can live in the mansion in the palace with the king in his presence can you say Amen brother Brandon would say May I drop this in he said if you little this little thing to you Brethren as I know you're different denominations I think I've never talked like this to a group uh but in this little locality here and throughout the nation it's becoming now that if the devil can keep us separated and he's got us shooting at one another he's got a an open Target anywhere he wants to shoot what's the use of shooting we're shooting one another see see so he can just get back and relax now let me just give this to you if I have found Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this Brethren if you want to be a blessing and to get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he's absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong and you know he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before God that's right you and don't take it in a way of just a selfish way and say I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder stand in the presence of God our Father the way of prayer should be made in the presence of God and say father here's my brother he he's he is justly he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I don't see why he done it and then go then let God go to talking to you and you'll see that maybe what that man's been through the devil has Twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back down to Earth again you'll go over to that brother shake his hand cuz you know what he has been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even if he is a rank Sinner and what about a brother that has made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accused when he's not wrong but if he is wrong well if we will take him to the throne of God stand there shoulder to- shoulder with our brother knowing he's Immortal maybe his destination rest upon our attitudes towards him and when we come back from the Throne of God we will realize that we're everyone guilty and we all need help one from another that is the best way or the best way to do is to pray that that that Porter seen something different in that woman her hair was fixed she was wearing Royal garments those women that were around her honored her respected her she was very he says that she there out of her was coming such love for the people that she would stop and and would help the the needy here and this one and she was she had she had so much qualities that were weigh down inside of her that was that was bottled up by complexes totally bottled up by her complexes but when the king came the prince came and paid the price for her it un it it it it un it took it took the the uh the cap off of the heart it took the lid off to where she could express she always always had it there but because of his love now she can express her love oh Hallelujah is that not the Bride of Jesus Christ is that not the bride because she knows what it is to have those complexes she knows what it is to be to be under Satan's Ro she knows what it is to suffer and to hurt she knows what broken heart is all about she knows she knows she knows and she ain't going to look over to that other guy and say what is your problem she's got a heart that says oh let me help let me be of service let me encourage let me pray let me come on not putting the dagger in someone's uh back but but giving that love can you say man now we would as as um my time is up as we come into this into this presence here and we begin to look and I uh uh we will read there in in the the uh 1 Corinthians the 11th chapter and um and we will as we prepare you know what um uh I forgot that bread in there uh brother Josh and um we as we as as we look here and understanding that we are um we are humans we're as Mortals how we need the presence of God how we need the Holy Spirit within our lives how we need the presence his presence on us with us on a daily basis I I I can never express how that none of us can ever get by without the blood of Jesus just can't do it we just can't go without that atonement we just can't go without the presence of the of the king him himself and that blood that was shed I want us to look here at First Corinthians uh let's we'll break in here at 11 and um uh let's see um oh let's let's start the 17th verse 16th he start he stops with the with the um men and women's hair 17 18 verse says now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worst for first of all when you come together in church I hear there be divisions among you and I partly believe it there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you when you come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the Lord's Supper uh um the uh into one place this is not to eat the Lord's Supper for in eating everyone taketh before his own uh supper and and one is hungry and another is drunken and what have you not houses to eat and drink or despise ye the Church of God and shame them that have not what what shall I say to you shall I Praise You In This I praise you not for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you to you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying the cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this cup and drink this or eat this bread and drink this cup unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not earning the Lord's body for this calls many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come now the um Corinthian Church you know he they they were brother Brenham says they were a carnal Church they it was a uh they you know they were they were preferring one another and they were they were going you know it was just it was just a lot of chaos and and you know and and speaking of of preferences you know I heard someone say here uh a month or so ago that um well you know our church is sort of like there's the Martin side and then and then here's here's uh another group and here's another group well uh you know I don't know who would be saying that or who would think that um I am proud of my family but I'm I'm here tell you we are not we we are not there is no Martin's Applegates or Martin's uh curses or Martin's Smiths there's no we we are all Sons and Daughters of God and we're all baptized into one body amen there is there is no there there is none of this this this stuff here and there is no feeling better this way and that way and I you know and I I I told the individual that was talking to me about it am man I said well that you know that's the first I've heard about it uh uh you know we're we're we're not uh you know we there is there's there's no uh we we don't want anyone ever feeling that way like that because what what dear Lord we've got we we've got we've got a World to Change we got a Rapture to make we got to and and we sure don't want this thing where well it's us against you or you against us we are and sons of God we all belong to that one self-same family that's Jesus Christ amen so so we don't ever want to have that kind of an attitude because that kind of an attitude will will it'll it'll never get us anywhere with God it'll it'll never get us anywhere with God so the deal is is we're thankful for the individualities we're thankful for we we're thankful for every family amen but I tell you what there is there's only one family we belong to and that is the family of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the family it's not the brandom family it's not the Martin family and it's not it's it's it's it's it's not the Prett family it's it's not uh it it's no other family than the family of the Lord Jesus Christ that is who we belong to come on now amen and so so we we don't want uh uh those things to ever uh you know you you just you just you just blow that kind of a thing off because that that's just you know we we've got one goal and that is the common goal of a Rapture that is the status that we are pushing for is a Rapture that is what we're longing for is a Rapture the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen can I hear a great big amen that's who we are that's what we are that's what we stand for that's that's what I stand for amen that's what we believe amen so as we as we come to this communion and and we begin to look at at at at everything around us we want to say Lord we we ask Lord that you look inward look look in me I I I don't want want a a spirit that is anything but but the your spirit of Grace within me I want the Holy Spirit to so live and move and thrive in the presence of the my spirit to move and and live and thrive in the in the presence of that great almighty God I want that kind of a relationship with the Lord the only way that we can do that is to be honest with ourselves is to really look in our hearts and I think that's what these communion services are good for is for us to look within us and say Lord here I am if if if if if I've got an odd against a brother what go make it right just make it right I if if if if you feel and you you you know if someone's done something wrong to you and and you can't get over it now I'm not saying every time someone does something to you that you've got to go well you're going to give everyone a complex around you know uh brother brandham says don't say a thing about it brother bradam says just forgive them just go on and in prayer but if it's festering in your heart then go to that brother and and uh uh but I I guarantee you most of the time 90% of the time the brother meant nothing by it the sister meant nothing by it it's just the devil trying to get a get a wedge there but if there is a wedge that is there go get it out I I I you know I I've I i' I found it I've been battling this week in my own self amen and and and the devil will just put little things in my in in my little heart and and try to keep try to keep uh just just keep the spirit torn up what God don't want that Satan's the author of that that's right Satan's the one that does that what we've got to do is handle it according to what the scripture says and and and and if you've got an all against your brother then you need to make it right and if you've got something that your brother is done to you then you still need to go to them and say Hey you hurt my feelings I want you to know I'm I'm I'm forgiving you for it I I just got to get this up and over with you know but but don't carry this thing on because you can't allow the spirit of of of the enemy to torment you and to keep you from your your your power God's not called us to be church members he's called us to be powerful he's not called us for that and so if there are things there if there are sins in your life and you are you you you need to get rid of those sins get rid of them tonight get rid get rid of all of those sins that are that that are uh that that you that you know the Bible says is wrong then then don't don't prolong it cut those sins off amen and and I think if we would do that amen the spirit of the Lord would flow more freely in our prayer life in our dedication and our consecration well can you say Amen it's because we get we get away from the flow of life and then before you know it we've got we've got the river damned up and and it's usually because it's something that we're just petting something that we just that the spirit of the Lord's dealing with us on something that you know is wrong and you just ain't going to go get get it repented of and you're just going to keep on hiding I want to tell you that Devil's going to keep growing in your life too don't let the devil grow in your life you can't allow it's not worth it and as a as a as as a body here in Pon we are we are a unit we are we are a we are a a a uh a a a living organism if you will we we love one another we push for one another we believe in one another can you say amen amen if the musicians would come or the uh however you want to do that and then we will prepare for uh for this and um we um with brother Harry being gone uh we I appreciate all the brothers scrambling around this evening to get to get this ready here and uh appreciate those young men and uh brother and thanel and and those that were involved praise the Lord and uh brother brother Josh filled up the

first verse says let's see um now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world having loved his own which were in the world he loved them them unto the end oh that's glorious all the way up to the very end he loved his home that were in the world he loved them until the very end the supper being ended and the devil now put into the heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poureth water into a basin and begin to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord does thou wash my feet and Jesus answered and said what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter and Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head and Jesus answered to him or sath to him he that has washed needeth not to wash his feet but is every but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him and therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to [Music] you you've called me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should do this even as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that has sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them what a an incredible reading here the great Eternal God Jesus was God he was God living in a body the great eternal God wrapping a towel around his waist and kneeling [Music] down to wash Fisherman's feet scoundrel's [Music] feet people who hadn't who were nobody's Peter couldn't even sign his own name but when he said he loved them that were in this world and he loved them all the way to the very end and the Very love of God you don't know what I'm doing Peter says listen you're never going to touch my feet you're my master you're my Lord [Music] the great God Eternal it showed it showed the heart of God it expressed something it was ooing out of him love was such an expression in [Music] him and as he knelt down to these Scallywags and he washed their feet now they weren't just any scalawag they were predestinated Scallywags they were ones that he loved before the foundation of the world were ones that his blood would be shed for and then he says if I your lord you call me master and you do right for so I am and if I be your lord and I have done this to you then you should do this wash one another's feet for I've given you an example and the servant is not any greater than his Lord many times there's too many Chiefs and none of Indians many of times there's too many spiritual ones and not enough [Music] [Music] servants I want a servant's heart [Music] one thing that I appreciated I always appreciate any of the testimonies that that I hear about brother brandham but all Roberts would say then I believe it was Jack Cole but these men were talking when they would get together and brother Bren would be with them as they're they're sort of letting each other know where they're going to be and this that and the other so that they're not having meetings in the same cities and but when they would meet and they [Music] would oral says we knew that all that that William brandham had the gift that was greater than us all oral he said that [Music] he said but when he left when William renham left he made us all feel like we were the big [Music] ones he was the guy with a gift and he made us [Music] feel that we were the big guys and I don't think that he was just doing it I believe brother Brenham truly loved those men and appreciated their gift today it seems like it all needs to be around me and I and us and [Music] God's looking for [Music] servants and a master can be a servant and if the master can be a servant then how about the rest of us servants to one another loving one [Music] another I love you tonight I want a heart that is so willing to serve my brother my sister [Music] the feet were the foot
