you say man and I when you think of him when you sing about him when you reading his word you're meditating upon him it brings him nearer and I'm so thankful to hear this morning that I feel his presence here I'm so thankful for his love to every one of us he's been so faithful to us and amen I'm glad to be able to feel his presence come to a church that believes in the presence of the Lord fills the presence of the Lord amen and um glad to have a song leader that cries occasionally because he loves the Lord he's got a promise a man of a resurrection a man this is real folks Christianity is real amen it's very real and I this is a real gospel that we're preaching and it's a real heaven we're going to and there is a real man coming of the Lord and I'm so thankful here this morning to have that reality in my heart amen sure enjoyed the specials this morning from The Young youngans and uh and then also the sister Susie's youngins amen and I'm so glad to have have them with us it's been really really nice and we say a great big happy birthday to Sister Karen and we sure love sister Karen and appreciate her friendship over the years and their faithfulness to the things of the Lord and and um and I know I know it's been it's been a rough year Billy passing and just been a lot of situations that have that have come and but you're still standing here the sister Karen and it's been by the grace of God you're standing here this morning and so we we love sister Karen and brother Steve love them very much amen let's look here in in the Bible you man here in Ephesians 1 and 20. also would like to read in Colossians 1 and 18. and um praise the Lord amen so we're thankful we're thankful to God Amen for for all that he that he has done for the believer amen want to look here at Ephesians 1 and 20. in it and it says for uh which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead um let's see yeah we're just we'll just continue there and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places far above principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in the world to come and have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all amen so he hath put he hath made him to be the head over all things somebody say the head over all things to the church amen let's also look here in Colossians 1 and 18. it's it's basically saying the same thing he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence amen so in all things he might have preeminence and let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your your love to us and your blessings thank you for the presence that we feel here this morning Lord and father we are thankful Lord that there is a hope that is laying on the inside of every one of us Lord and we ask father that that hope would burn brighter and brighter and take preeminence in our lives Lord I pray Lord that you would just minister to every need you see those who aren't here ask Lord that you would heal them and help them Lord you see Joel there in Oklahoma City Lord oh God we believe that you're doing something Lord he's had a rough life Lord a hard life and because of it Lord he's he's paying the consequences Lord but oh God you can so touch that soul and touch that body Lord as he's only in his 30s father and I pray that you would Lord just speak the words of life and bring him out Lord and make him a testimony for your grace I pray Lord that you would be with everyone that is that that is again struggling with sickness and just be with them this morning we love you Lord as we stand here this morning Lord I take this this time very seriously and I pray Lord that you would you would just speak only I would speak only as you would speak Lord I pray that you would help us to hear what you have to say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning praise the Lord amen we are thankful for God's love to us and for a thought here this morning I want to speak on amen a subject of uh preparing for Rapture while living in laodicea and um as we look here in the world systems the kingdoms of this world we we see the maturity of the two spirits amen here on this earth right in the face of this rapture amen there's the spirit of lawlessness and then there is the spirit of preeminence of Christ lawlessness is the state of disorder due to disrespect for the law and we can see uh exactly that that this is where we are at of course brother Branham gave us the at predicted 65 years ago uh they're in uh it's if I can if I can find it I thought that I'd brought it in here just in case I I wanted to share it with you amen and uh but he but he talks of the um but he talks now that we are the the world is heading for a state of total lawlessness amen and how that there would come a time to where the spirit would be so prevailing that the spirit of iniquity Iman the scripture says that it is the mystery of iniquity and that this Myst this mysterious Spirit of iniquity in this day would unfold and we would we would truly see the Expressions that was behind that spirit and that is lawlessness preeminances is the superiority or the supremacy the predominancy of Christ amen it it is the authority of God's word and so when you are when the word is having a preeminence in you then that word is in fact uh having Authority and you are coming under the authority of God's word so we're living in a time to where amen again lawlessness the spirit that is a man that has brought us into a state of disorder disarray amen uh due to the respect of the word and we have at the same time the preeminances of Christ to bring us into a Rapture now this is quite a paradox because both Spirits are here at the same time both Spirits are here right here we are we are seeing it here in in the world now you say how can there be a Rapture in this environment brother Wendell amen I as we as we all know the scripture but I just want to go through some of these uh scriptures for just a moment as we look here in the at the Prophecies of scripture concerning this day they're in second Thessalonians 2 and 3 it says let no man deceive you by any means things for that day the Rapture shall not come except there come a falling away and the man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sets in the temple of God showing himself that he is God remember you not that when I was with you I told you these things now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity does already work now he is saying that the mystery of iniquities already there in the first age but he is saying that it's going to become so bold it's going to become so out in your face that you're going to see the effects of that spirit that is mysteriously been working down through the Church of all the ages man it's that that is already there and he says only he who now lets will let until he be taken out of the way then shall the wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and he shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish deceivableness of unrighteousness because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send him strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness so here is the deceivableness of unrighteousness amen and the be and and because they received not the love of the truth because the the word did come and they rejected that word amen for this calls God himself shall send strong delusions and they shall believe a lie and be damned can you say Amen now this is supposed to be right before the coming of the Lord let no man deceive you again the first verse that I I read to you for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first amen and so then we look here in in second Peter 2 and 1. it says but there were false prophets among the also among the people even as there shall be false prophet or teachers among you who privately or privilege shall bring indemnable heresies and denying the Lord that bought them and bring upon themselves with destruction and many shall follow their pernicious Ways by the reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of Amen going on down to the 12th verse for the sake of time but these As Natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of things that they understand not and shall utterly depperish in their own corruption and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they can it pleasure to Riot in the daytime have we not seen some rioting going on in the daytime of Our Generation spots they are blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while feasting with you so so now we find that this spirit is not necessarily going to be on the outside of the church but now we're finding that it's on the inside of the church the church is condoning such Behavior well praise the Lord amen the church has been condoning such behavior of lawlessness when it rejected the word back in 325 at DC can you say amen amen it it's it's been the spirit of iniquity that has been working through the church to disallow the headship of the word down through the Seven Ages it's only coming into its fullness or its manifestation in this hour that we're living in this is the Harvest Time what was done in seed form is now coming in reality right here in our land can you say Amen so what we are seeing here it says now sporting themselves in other words they're coming in and and and they're proud to be associated with the Christian church yet they believe not the word he says having eyes full of adultery cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable Souls a heart they have exercised with Covetous practices curse children so this is going to become the norm of the church it is a lawless Church it is a people without any authority of the word therefore they cannot cease from sin amen second Timothy the third chapter the first verse know this also that in the last days perilous times shall come men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous monsters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors headache high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and here it goes he's linking it right back to the church having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof where is the power he says the gospel is the power of God unto salvation so when you lose the preeminence of the word then you are Lawless and God is choosing to Rapture you in a lawless generation ah Hallelujah can you say Amen having a form but denying the power from such turn away six verse four of this short are they which creep into houses and Lead silly captive silly women leading with sin slid away with diverse lusts ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as Janice and Chambers withstood Prophet or Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith they shall proceed no further for their Folly shall be made manifest unto what oh man so it's now coming to light manifesting in this Harvest Time amen now Revelations 18 describes total lawlessness it describes a world that would come to a climax of sin and and perversion that the spirit of lawlessness and moral decay under the scientific religion amen and it would lead to a cage of every hateful and unclean bird as we look there at Rome Revelations 18 and 1 after these things I saw another Angel come from Heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen now who is this Babylon the great Revelation 17 and 5 says it was mystery Babylon the great the mother the great and the mother of harlots it's the church amen now it's not the bride the church church is going into total apostasy but the bride is going to be coming under the preeminence of Christ and his word and he will take her home well glory to God Amen he says Babylon the greatest Fallen has fallen and has become the habitation of devils the whole of every foul Spirit a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her the merchants of the Earth are wax Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people be not partakers of her sins that ye receive not her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her the iniquities can you say Amen so this church has has taken on that Spirit The Mystery of iniquity has worked in mystery Babylon for 2 000 years it has it has come but now amen there is a revealing of what is taking place and God is saying I want you to come out of that system I want you Hallelujah I'm fixing to burn the I'm fixing to burn the harlots I'm fixing to burn the Earth and I'm going to take you home with me hallelujah what praise the Lord now now this is exactly what is here we are this revelation of Revelation 18 correlates exactly with Revelations 3 in the last age of laodicea thou sayest Thou Art Rich thou sayest that thou have need of nothing but I say you're naked blind miserable and deceived can you say Amen now this is not Daniel's day this is not Moses day this is not Abraham's day this is not Luther's day this is not Wesley's day this is the seventh Church age the rapturing age hallelujah what can you say man in this age the church would be declaring that they are just fine the church it would be thou sayest they are saying well praise the name of the Lord thou says see they were speaking they were saying amen they were talking as the mouthpiece of God but though they say it does not make it right though they say it amen that we are rich and that we're increased though the Catholic Church says it though the Protestant Church says it amen and she says that she speaks for God Amen that she is the assured voice of the Lord she says I'm rich I'm increased I have need of nothing amen that is her self-estimate why because she is Lawless she is not taking the words of the husband supposed husband she is taking her own estimation of what she is well praise the Lord amen he says you need my word she says I'm fine with helpful work he says you can only be clothed by my word she says amen that I am clothed I have everything I have need of nothing are you following my drift now the sentence has been passed the verdict is given she is no longer the mouthpiece of God though she maintains that she is God says I wish you were either hot or code I wish you were either for my word or against my word but to say that you have my name and do nothing with it I will spew you you make me sick we'll praise the Lord amen now I want you to think about that because she says it amen now yet in this layout of see a lukewarm age self-efficient age is when God's going to take give us a Rapture amen where mediocrity is the norm we're reading and quoting is a common occurrence and with no life behind it where amen where where there's where there's nothing there no life no no no Vigor no desire no no push for the word of God it's an age where the people are more interested in houses and land it's an age where the people are so caught up into debt that there's no time for prayer there's no time for reading there's no time for training our children in the ways that the prophet gave us and the word of God gave us there's no time for these things because it's a lukewarm age it's an age where everyone really thinks that they've got it all put together and they don't really need the preeminence of the word amen are you hearing me let me just put it very plainly to you this morning amen overcoming quiet power requires a disciplined life overcoming power requires a discipline in life you see you structure your life around what you deem is important the Lord man if if sports are important then you structure your whole family around Sports amen you you did your discipline amen your structure it's a discipline of thought it's a it's a discipline of action you are you are focused in on that one well praise the Lord many people have many different uh desires they have many different things that they're looking to amen but you you look there at a champion boxer a champion boxer is it has got a disciplined routine he's got a structure about him because he knows in order to be a champion he's got to do what it takes to win man now why are we coming to church and why do we read and why do we pray and why do we do these things is because we've got one desire and we're structuring our life around that desire we are disciplined to this rapture Hallelujah man now champion boxer he he he's a strict diet he trains with strict training amen he denies himself anything contrary to the root that is required to take him to the championship well praise the Lord I wonder what's really important in this day that we're living in I wonder what's any more important is it really the building up of business is it really the things that we put together as as important or is there one thing that's really important and that is winning the prize winning this Rapture what can you say amen amen the Apostle Paul there in Philippians 3 and 8. I'm going to read it from the Amplified version he says but more than that I count everything as loss compared to the Priceless privilege and the Supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord and of growing more deeply and thoroughly acquainted with him a joy unequal for his sake I have lost everything and I consider it all but garbage so that I may gain Christ going down to the 12th verse said he says not that I had already attained it this goal of being christ-like or have already been made perfect but I actively press on so that I may take hold of that Perfection for which Christ has took hold of me and made me his own are are y'all catching me here today amen I actively press to lay hold on that Perfection it's his brothers and sisters I do not consider that I have made it my own yet but one thing I do forgetting what lies behind and Reaching Forward to what lies ahead I press on toward the goal now now now there's a reason why it's a press there's a reason for the structure there is a reason for the training is because you're living in a world where there's not champions and there's only going to be one of us there's only going to be the bride that is going to come out the champion in this life what can you say amen amen the Rapture is not for everyone the prize is not for everyone you are living in an age of lawlessness it's the spirit that you are having to resist well praise the Lord amen now I think if we're going to win this prize amen then we've got to remember what the prize is what is the price the price is us getting back to where Adam was before he fell it was lawlessness that brought Adam into the state that we're in right now it was a lawless act it was standing coming against the word of God the preeminence will praise the Lord and it was because a man of lawlessness that we are here that we are fighting what we're fighting for but Christ has come to take us back I tell you what until you make it your now he's made it his price the scripture says who for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the shame what was he doing he was paying the price for you to come back okay well praise the Lord amen are y'all catching my draft now now now now Christ endured the cross because he saw the joy that was ahead of him in other words he saw you brother John he saw me amen he saw every one of you he saw you back in your position of authority in a world where law is the order Hallelujah now you say law amen is it too childlike is it too childlike to think that all things can come under the authority of the law is it too childlike to think that the Sons and Daughters of God will become so at one with God again till their words will become law is it too childlike to think that the authority of God can come back in human vessels again and we live in a perfect world without sin demons and devils is it true childlike to think that we are going back to Perfection [Applause] he's gonna have to take you out of this lawlessness and take you back to that place of authority I'll praise the name of the Lord amen yes sir now look here Hebrews 2 and 6 but one in a certain place testified saying what is man the thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou has visited him now that was made him a little lower than the Angels thou crownest him with glory and honor and did set him over the works of thine hands and thou has put all things somebody say all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all somebody say ow in subjection under him he left nothing that is not under him somebody say he left nothing but now we see not yet all things under him now he's saying he was created for that purpose but now now we see not things everything not yet under him but he said but we see Jesus well praise the Lord now now here you are created you were created for Authority you were created for a Dominion you were created to not have sickness you were created not to have well praise the Lord you were created to rule the devil you were created to rule the Earth created to stand as God stands you would be his body here on the Earth but now we find ourselves even lower than the angels now we find ourselves with no Authority under us amen there's not not everything's under a shed but we see Jesus why do we see Jesus we're not looking at our inabilities anymore we're not looking at the lawlessness anymore we're not looking at the failures anymore we are looking at the one who is taking us back to our position but we somebody say but we see Jesus now as long as he has the preeminence he's going to lead you right back but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels He was made of man for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him this is when you need to say hallelujah for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto Glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings so Christ the lamb paid the price so that Christ the word could have the preeminence back in the church all of this is done in the age of lawlessness this is all done to when no one can say you're wrong no one can say you're right no one can say anything because you're right in your own sight lawlessness work doesn't have preeminence God doesn't have preeminence now the law of the land no longer has preeminence it's the state the mystery of iniquity is no longer mysterious mystery babbling the great is no longer mysterious it is now the realities that we're living in if the preeminence of Christ was once mysterious the preeminence of Christ is becoming realities in you today can you say Amen now how will there be a Rapture in this environment the Rapture is in the three stages it's hearing the shout which was Luke 17 30 in the days of the revealing of the son of man as it was in the days of Sodom when God came down Prophet God came down as Sodom is fixing to burn he did not go to Sodom to reveal himself he came to his prophet Abraham who had the promise of a body change he came and said listen can I hide anything from Abraham seeing that he will command his family he will structure them he will build them in that environment of the promise now he comes to Abraham and says Abram Sodom is fixing to burn then he says and you're fixing to have a body change Sarah's fixing to have a baby now Sarah's laughing and saying how can this be can you say Amen she had woke up in a bad mood that morning am I going too slow here tonight or this morning she woke up a little bit in a bad mood and now I hear Abraham he's he's over here visiting a stranger again always talking about the supernatural always talking about an angel always talking about God appearing and now here's this man sitting here Abraham has asked her to go feed or to get get the get the calf ready get the milk ready get everything ready Sarah is in a bad mood but in order for the preeminence of the word to take place in her womb it must take place in her heart lot is fixing to burn Sodom is fixing about the scripture says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the revealing what is the shout message it is the revealing of the son of man it is the revelations being made unclear it is to Revelations 10 1-7 it is the anointing the mighty Angel the great Angel of the Covenant coming down with an open book and giving it to the seventh angel who's declaring the mystery of God that is the shout well praise the Lord somebody's glad you heard the shout how many glad God came to you and said hey you now listen I'm going to give you I'm going to I'm going to reveal the whole mystery to you sodom's fixing to burn lot didn't hear it lot didn't hear it Abraham heard it and he says that promise that you've been waiting on well I didn't hear that Abraham heard that and I just want to tell you Abraham woke up one morning with a brand new body and so did his wife Hallelujah you say now now now oh yeah amen what did the king say I love that girl she's I want her can you say Amen so you see but now that's the first stage that is as he is descending that's the reason is it is a mystery of the rapture it's Christ doing all three but it is a it is a revelation of his word but what's the second what's the second stage of this rapture hallelujah it's that voice it is the preeminence of the word in his body here on the Earth you see Pentecost where the world thinks that it's going to be a Rapture amen and and and the the little the the the the little pixie thing is going to come and raise uh wave the magic wand and and we're all going to fly away and we're going to we're going to uh no no no no you see the ones that's going in Eden the one going back to Eden are those who have heard the voice of the Lord and have come under the preeminence of that word it's those that have taken the word of God believe the word of God instill that word within their heart can you say man that's the purpose when you see yourself in that Revelation that you are that purpose now the prophet would say there it is he is sending a Vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost 2 000 years he's sending someone who is so far from organization and education and the world of religion that has John the Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear only from God he will have thus saith the Lord and speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece And he as it is declared in Malachi 4 and 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day they will hear a Vindicated Prophet that was given the truth as as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those he left with him in that day will be the ones who manifest the Lord be his body be his voice and perform his Works Hallelujah do you see it and you say man the preeminence that word taking that place within our hearts preparing can you say Amen placing the value upon that word placing the value upon that revelation because it is the revealing of Christ it was the revealing of his word it's the revealing of who you are you're the reason the word came when Christ came when God came and appeared unto Adam he called his name Adam Where Art Thou he knew who Adam was he came with his name what praise the Lord there are some names that are written on that open book and it's the mysterious one that is calling your name he is not saying Wendell Martin or amen because there's Hallelujah believe it or not there's two Wendell Martins in the world I know for sure hallelujah amen I went to go get a gun and they wouldn't let me have it and matter of fact I had I had the ATF and these guys all calling me Hallelujah so I thought I'd get on the internet and see what was going on there's a Wendell Martin and he's in prison in uh in Florida hallelujah amen thank God for for Social Security numbers amen but you see God has calling his people by his what you are his word you were predestinated to be here on this Earth at this time and when that word that is preached to you in this generation you'll understand it you'll see it you'll grab it with everything that you've got because you are the rapturing generation Moses didn't question God he was predestinated of God to do it when God appeared to him Abraham did not question God he was predestinated of God to be that prophet no I did not question God in the midst of all the science there was something in the heart that says I believe it when everyone else says you are absolutely crazy and When God says this is a rapturing church it's because you are predestinated to it [Applause] What God Says [Applause] can you say Amen Luther knew who he was Wesley knew who he was your Prophet knew who he was but now the revelations got to fall into the body you've got to know who you are and let that same revelation become preeminent in you preeminent in you what what what what what does that mean brother Wendell that means when the angel of the Lord appears to marry and says you're the girl and Mary says how can I be the girl I've never known a man and then the angel says ha but you are highly favored of the Lord you are the one that is to bring forth this Christ child and the Holy Spirit is going to overshadow you and she quit questioning and she looked around and she says I'll take that Revelation and let it have preeminence in me I will believe that I will accept that brother how else is God going to do that in you except you accept the Revelation when it is given unto you oh come on church it's been like that in every age it had they had to accept it in the first and the second and the third and the fourth they had to say what God was doing a man the prophet would say Paul said that the word come in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flame-cutting sword it went to the consciences of men like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases and said captives free everyone everywhere those early Believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and God confirmed that word with signs and wonders the sick were healed the Devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action and that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last day somebody say and in this last day it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bright why is it here stronger than ever is because this is the day of the revealing this is the day of Revelations 10 where the Thunders are unveiled and we see the mystery of what God has been doing and then we take that mystery into our heart we accept it we believe it and it becomes part of our lives our words our actions everything about us is every action about us every thought about us everything everything that we it don't matter we're in the Lion's Den we're coming out it don't matter we're in the whale's belly we're coming out it don't matter where we are because there is a revelation in the church it's not something in the future it's not something in the past I am that revelation I am that body of Christ going into a rapture can you say man amen says in the last days it's your stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold to that word fill your mouth and heart with it someday God will give you the kingdom can you say Amen so The Voice of preeminence of the word is in his body you under your message become the final voice to the final eight you taking the Revelation and eating that book that Revelation you become what you eat [Music] can you say Amen now the way you live your life is your voice where you put your emphasis shows whether the voice has the preeminence go ahead praise the Lord if you're living in Malice and bitterness and hatefulness all the time you've not you've not become the voice you've not heard the shout you hear the shout you'll become that word praise the Lord oh man God's wanting preeminence what did what is the threefold purpose amen God revealing himself in a man Jesus Christ revealing himself making himself known in a body of dust then having the preeminence in his church and through that preeminence will then Rapture you take you back to the eating condition in the beginning I want to tell you a lawless church will not be a part of the Rapture it's going to be a Rapture the Rapture church is going to be where the word has taken the preeminence in it's not my opinion it's not your opinion it's the words opinion the word has the preeminence the Brenham would say for he said when the Holy Ghost has come he will bring these things that have taught you to your memory and we'll show you things to come that's the kind of tutor we've got the Holy Spirit to reveal and to bring the disciplined book of the father and reveal to you what God's plan is Hallelujah the discipline book of the father to reveal what God's plan is in other words that book is is is is part of the key it's the key to the rapture amen he says then when we step across them boundaries and turn away from it with a stiff neck and what does the Holy Spirit thing when he stands before the father to bring a character to him can you see brother sister while we're not progressing like we ought to it's our character that is tearing us down now we're children when we're born again we're a child of God we're children disobedient children but I wish I had the voice and could stand here and and the time we would lay on it for hours of the Disobedience of the church to God and how the holy spirit is bringing that word back and forth well praise the Lord don't forget there's two resurrections those that have allowed the word to have the preeminence there will be in that first resurrection according to scripture there will be more in that land and the second Resurrection but they're not going to rule and reign well glory to God amen what is discipline discipline is to regulate it's to bring into order discipline to give direction to train with a firm hand discipline a disciplined life is one of self-control self-government self-discipline obedience controlled Behavior bringing you into line a firm hand a Desi a disciplined life to discipline is to discipline yourself for a Cause what can you say man that means to train the oneself to do something in a controlled or a habitual way successful people follow a plan Hallelujah amen and you must discipline yourself amen into adopting regular working methods now now I I want you to think about this because what we see what we find lacking in too much of the church is the word is not our Center focus every day of our life we've got the basics laid down but what God is wanting is you to take his word for every aspect of your life praise the Lord that's the reason why he only gets three services and out of us uh a month some of us he gets you know one service or once every two months or whatever because the priority is not rapture the priority is to fit him into the mix Hallelujah as we've been teaching now for the last two and a half months on that mysterious one and who that mysterious one is of Revelations the first child the second chapter first chapter second whichever one that is amen we find that that that Revelation is Christ in you well praise the Lord now so the working methods it's following a certain program to discipline is a certain schedule it is a certain method and if it's not well let me just pick on something easy I if if it's not if work w-o-r-k labor is not important to you and if it's not your priority well praise the Lord it will not fit into your schedule as priority and call me here this morning am I doing all right in Hallelujah amen yes you know you should go to work yes you know others do it yes you know the Bible says you should but because it is not your priority you are not disciplined to get up and go to work it's not an absolute to you we know it's what men do we know that that's how you get your money we know but when it's not the priority believe me there will be plenty of things to come up to distract you from going to work well glory to God now what makes you do this it's become part of your schedule it's part of Who You Are it's be why you have got strong convictions about it I will live under a bridge if I don't work my family will be upset if they can't have McDonald's occasionally if I don't go to work then you become structured then you become well praise the Lord I'm still talking about this you discipline yourself that means when you when the alarm clock hits and you're trying to and you're trying to find that alarm for the tenth time and you finally get up why Hallelujah because you've got some absolutes in your life and you've got to go to work in order to get a paycheck now for those now you say well that that's that that there's a lot of people that has never had that kind of discipline and it's because they don't think that work is really all that important and believe me it'll go from a toe wake to an to a migraine to a this to that to what got no gas in the car well my tires halfway flat I can't make it to where I mean hello I've heard it all I've been pastoring a long time now I've heard it all elujah but now someone that does have those ethics and how does have that absolute in their life then they become they they become structured around that vision they become structured and disciplined are y'all understanding me so then it doesn't matter amen I'm going to get up and go to work whether I had a migraine or not and I learned to just push through it I had to get up and go do these things just push through it why amen this is because I had a responsibility and my number one response to my my number one thing that kept me going even with all my backaches and when the when the doctor was would love to have given me a disability and all of that I said I've got three boys and they're going to see me working every day and praise the Lord amen it's important it's important to me therefore I put that thing I put it I disciplined myself whether I had headaches whether I had backaches whether I oh come on Church amen I I was I was praised the Lord I was back home you know I was back home from the hospital I when I broke my back I broke it and you know all of those places and in the in in surgery for ten and a half hours I get out amen I'm in the hospital for two weeks I'm in the hospital for two weeks they can't Hallelujah I can't use the restroom or anything man and it is embarrassing they're not and and I and you know and I'm wanting to go home and they said I can go home but all I was doing is just putting out gas amen and and they weren't gonna let me go until and I'm sitting oh my oh my oh my Hallelujah why because I had something that I did not want to stay in that hospital when I got home I was in my back bracelet and I had my my rod sticking out of my hand like this and my wife was driving me around to the jobs amen uh why because there was a priority in my life I wasn't going to sit in that bed I wasn't going to be there I had [Applause] I'm just using something that all of us guys can understand what about your spiritual walk what about this rapture what about walking in perfect love before God and man what about that word having preeminence in you if the rapture's not our priority the shout means nothing more than just a wonderful little message and the voice we're waiting for that to come and you don't realize that that word you are you become that letter read and known of all men and it ain't just what you're saying here it's what you believe here can you say Amen am I doing all right this morning Hallelujah amen some know it's what we need to do some know it's what we should do some know that it's the key to our victory for our family it's the key of victory for our for for for ourselves we know what the key of Victory is but we're so distracted because it's not become a priority math then we'll come and set an amen to church and we'll go through the religious worship do you really think that this is all this is you do you really think the gospel has it just been has it just been diluted down to some good church services are we not preparing to leave this place is not this the place for the authority of the sons of God and we're setting here just just just wishy-washy and we're not taking this message to Heart and you say man well now you see you see in the spiritual application that I'm that I'm talking about here are you hearing me here today come on Church amen Hallelujah if Church isn't priority and and and that's not that's not your priority what dear Lord family comes to town hey see y'all later Church ain't priority to me what about living a life in front of your church or your family so that they can see what you believe sickness comes well it's not a priority Church ain't a priority what are we telling the world and yet we're saying we're increased with goods and have need of nothing we have placed our value on something other than this rapture there is not a scripture in the Bible more clear than Church attendance for this last day forsake not the assembling of yourselves together even so much the more as you see that day approaching I don't care if you're sick I don't care if you're discouraged I don't care if the mailman comes over to give you a Christmas tree it don't matter there should be priorities you guys have been a little bit quiet on me this morning I'm fixing this I'm fixing to get my rototiller out and dig on some rocks priority can you say Amen relationships if we want a if we want a I'm getting off this here in a minute if we want successful relationship between me and my wife I've got to do what is required and it's not going and seeing a marriage counselor and it's not telling the world how bad my wife is no I've got to make her love my priority come on buddy my priority and if it's my priority I will discipline myself to love for her regardless of how much of an obnoxious little devil I think she might be I've got to discipline my heart not to respond back if she's in her trial or if she's in our deal I've got to discipline my heart to love I've got to discipline to love my wife as Christ did the church in giving himself for that church amen you gotta stand gotta do something to get some Smiles in this place now I'm coming around to you girls oh oh oh Hallelujah well you just think you're my Lord yes we do amen you just think girls who made you boss I know you are no no no no no dedicate yourself to the love that God's ordained for you to be and the Bible says that the man the husband is to be the rule I know you young people might not like it but that's Bible anyways and it's the Lawless spirit that will not will not come under the headship of the word well praise the Lord praise the Lord but how many also knows that if you make that Pride your priority you're going to know that you're going to fix whatever you've got to fix you're going to do whatever you got to do you know lots of times it's looking right here and saying Lord I'm going to pull away in prayer I want to be the leader of my home I want to do what is required I'm going to do bless the Lord you see because the Rapture you see now you're saying what you got off the Rapture no no no no we're still in the second phase of the Rapture to where the word is now living having preeminence in you it's those that are taking that word this this is happening there'll be a shout there'll be the voice then there's the Trump there's the dead raised amen Christ is God revealed threefold purpose is that right revealing himself in the man Christ having preeminence in his church his body taking us back we'll praise the Lord so disciplined Saints a disciplined Christian gives complete adherence to the word and that that discipline again what does that discipline mean it means he or she has learned to discipline his or her emotions all right I'm not talking about mind over matter I'm talking about the word having preeminence I'm talking about getting in prayer dedicating ourselves this ain't mind over matter okay I'm gonna be good I'm going to be good I'm going no no no no no no no I'm going to be good I'm going to be good I'm going to be good I'm going to be good no you're not you're not your priorities where you're putting them out there if you want a successful marriage you will put your priorities in prayer if you want a successful walk with God you'll put your priorities with prayer watering that word to be made you see you see the Paradox here you're living in the age of lawlessness and these doors here does not exempt you from that spirit that used to be mystery iniquity it's no longer mysterious the veil's been taken off the book we see what the devil has done throughout the church ages distracting us in many many many forms away from the word yeah and yet in the midst of lawlessness God's got a bride in the midst of lawlessness God's got a bride that is subjecting him herself to his word Hallelujah come on discipline is required for shutting down your attitudes discipline is required for shutting your mouth discipline is required for shutting the computer off discipline is required for saying yes ma'am to Mom discipline is required for for Walking with God in a pure heart requires boy must be doing pretty good because you're listening pretty hard discipline is required to forgive it's seven times seventy in one day and wake up the next morning with mercies renewed and have to forgive another Seventy Times Seven and for that day and then wake up and the nurse mercies are renewed again 70 times 7. it takes disciplined heart to come before God and say I want to be that I want to live that I want to be everything that you want me to be well praise the Lord amen brother Branham says now how can the church be adopted when they can't come to discipline we've got to be disciplined first God could not trust this power with the church it's hard to tell what you do with it How could a father trust his business to a boy that might simply pollute his own inheritance he couldn't do it the church has got to come to a place to where it's discipline God's on that work right now discipline can you say man all right amen someone say hallelujah good job brother Wendell thanks the third pool operates it can only operate amen by a structured life as I'm as I'm beginning to descend here I find that a lot of times if we don't have structure in our personal walks if we don't have structure in our personal lives and and and I mean Beyond just eating drinking and going to work and to church that we miss out on some of the most valuable things and overcoming because the words got to have that effect in here amen you've got to have that effect right here and that comes by a real genuine prayer really putting it down there you know the Bible says that this almost the psalmist said I fasted and prayer returned to my bosom give me that desire back you understand because the key the key is putting that emphasis we get you you say brother Wendell you're putting it pretty rough on us all I'm trying to tell you you're living in a god-forsaken world and if we're not disciplined we'll just be another religious group Baptist Pentecostal Methodist message and we'll miss the importance of why God brought this word to us he didn't bring it to us so that we're different he brought it to us to [Music] us to place that word in US to have the preeminence in us well we're not questioning it and when it's not working in us you know when it's not working you know when you're losing your temper you know when you're not walking with God and if that prayer is not where it needs to be then sometimes good fasting just fasting and getting a hold of God and say Lord here I am I need you I need you help me Lord can you say man brother Brandon says no he's talking about that that third pull he says here's the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with that word she performs the command of God of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while while in his Earthly Ministry so now he he works in and through the pride she knows that somebody say I know that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will fulfill through now somebody say he will fulfill through the bride me that work which he has left for this specific time can you say Amen God is Not mocked what a man sows very true if you sow to the spirit you so do the supernatural you suck you sow to this word you're going to reap that Supernatural Harvest [Laughter] well glory to God can you say Amen amen God's not mocked the scripture the scripture there in Colossians 1 and 29 and wherefore also I I also labor striving according to his workings which worketh in me what um I want that word to have that effect in me Hallelujah now this is not law because it can only be through him but if I'm ever going to control this Earth if I'm ever going to be put back to a position of authority I'm going to have to let that word have that Authority in me well praise the Lord and God loves to test his people amen if you believe in healing then act like he like it like you believe it don't be going around in the Molly grubs what relationship does faith have with fear what relationship does doubt have within uh with with faith can you say man how can Prevailing Faith in a prevailing word be sorrowful and sad and despondent faith in a prevailing word says God's got my answer his word is going to have preeminence in me brother Joe's going for his test tomorrow the second test to amen look at his lungs and I say we are we have a Prevailing Faith in a prevailing word from a prevailing God no matter what we feel it don't matter what we see it's what God Said God loves to test his people he wants to see if you're going to put the word first if you're going to believe him well praise the Lord stand up there amen some of us haven't felt good in a while but we're going to keep on confessing that word and we're gonna believe that word it's a Prevailing Faith and a prevailing word in a body of Flesh but that Prevailing Faith and that prevailing word and this Earthly flesh is going to be manifested through me can you say man amen premature Graves the prophet says there's premature Graves because the word didn't have preeminence in lives well glory to God amen that's right amen Mass fact brother Brandon used that premature grade 37 times he used it 37 times and he talks about how it's a fight of Faith defying every demon of doubt and storming that storming of the mind and you've got to resist him he says maybe it's just one nurse amen time of Nursing and you you don't get enough strength just stay there draw from him until you are walking until cancer is gone refuse to see me the cancer refused to see anything that's contrary to the word it's not so everything like Jonah the lying vanities oh I you know I won't even see them I won't recognize them no sir I see what God Said don't see the amorites don't see the graveyard don't see the things see the promises of God God promised us it's up to us to it's up to God to take care of it yes sir now I know that death's got to strikes everyone death comes to us all but sometimes it's just because of unbelief we give up and go to a premature grave God don't want us to do that he wants us to trust him and believe him and say it so and stay with it instead of saying I'm dying I'm dying I ain't going to make it stand up there like to see Abraham and say give him a mountain give me my Mountain I'm living under that anointing Revelations 10 has come to me God let your word have preeminence in everything of my faith let your word have preeminence over my mind let your word have preeminence over my body let your word have preeminence in me it's the anointing of the day can you see man amen he wants us now he said Lazarus died that's true he rose again and lived a normal life for many many years because of the Resurrection Jesus gave him and then of course he died again because he will come forth in the resurrection Jesus said he would come forth in that Resurrection but he has to go go to his rest like all human beings but until that time comes somebody say until that time comes let's not be cheated out of life for the service of God because it's Satan's business to cheat you out of it that means I've got a set time that I got to go amen but until then I'm going to enjoy life until I don't care how much this back tells me of this I don't care what my what what what what what this one and that one tells me I don't care what what this whatever symptoms my body is telling me I'm going to stand right there and I'm going to say I'm overcoming I am believing you ain't cheating me out of it you ain't cheating me out of my joy you ain't cheat me out of my faith you ain't cheating me out you ain't cheating me out of the time with my boys and my girls and my and my grandchildren you ain't going to cheat me out of that time the word is having preeminence in me I'm going to enjoy everything that I've got amen well can you say Amen you see what I'm saying what I'm doing is I'm bringing out some just some little things in our lives that we attend to discount and not let the word have the preeminence we want preeminence if musicians would come praise the Lord Hallelujah brother Bradham says there are many that are sick and needy in the land and that's the future home of the Bride by the way he says they haven't completed their journey and our great enemy not only our enemy but your enemy has come to beset them and to stop their their lives and to send them to a premature grave we're asking for them today that you and your mercy and Grace Lord will extend their days to the allotted time can you say man Lord I'm going to believe you I'm gonna I'm gonna throw my everything behind it enough of my attitudes enough of these attitudes amen pastors aren't supposed to be Doty grandpas God's not supposed to be dirty grandpas it's the word and if you expect to make a rapture get your attitude in line get your act again amen because we want that word to have the preeminence you want that word to have that preemness [Applause] brother Branham says now on this last stage the spirit he has cried after this last age you have the word and we have how many beliefs we got the revelation you have more Bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about that word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want leave out what you don't want you're not interested in living it but debating it he said I would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold and rejected I could stand that if you would get white hot to know its truth and live it I would praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it I in turn must refuse you I will spew you out for you nauseate me on down he says then what is the wrong with the these people of the last day they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it but the apostle Paul to Timothy 4 and 15 says meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that thy profiting may appear to all take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee Lord I want I want that word in every part of my life Lord pull back the scales now the scale's already been pulled back if you listen to the message at all you know what the prophet says you don't have to you don't have to guess that but it's that religious spirit of laodicea that wants to come on us saying I don't have need of anything I'm fine and Christ is standing there knocking you've got to fight that you said I've got to fight that yes both The Virgins were asleep [Music] it's the spirit but here's the paradox the Rapture the preeminence of the word is taking place right in the midst of lawlessness to me it's a beautiful Paradox it's a how God can pull it off the only way God can pull it off is there's an eternal seat on the inside of you and you're willing to humble yourself to that word and say take your word and scrub me clean me with your word Lord clean me with your word is that right is that right I I just I just believe it I believe this this message here is just as important as as telling us our place believing the word we put that oh I don't drink I don't smoke but yeah but you won't believe him for nothing but yeah you subtract his word for this but yeah but you said nothing whether you don't know no no no time for lawlessness he says it don't excuse it this is his work I didn't say it the prophet said it God's word said it and we stand here saying Amen to it is that right I say Amen to it by living it [Music] renew me in thy spirit [Music] that I might live that's an old song [Music] re-baptize repurify Crush my will show me the ugliness of the South [Music] centered light free new Me Lord that I am [Music] Hallelujah [Music] that I might live or re baptized eyes repurify thank you oh show me show me the ugliness of my own self-centered life
