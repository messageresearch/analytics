[32:37] preaching this
[32:38] morning and so we're
[32:41] just thankful for having a pastor that's
[32:45] that can go sometimes and get
[32:48] away most of the time when he gets goes
[32:50] out and does try to have some rest he
[32:53] has to

[33:28] wrong might not be this weekend but this
[33:30] weekend I think he's preaching for
[33:32] brother Bryce and I believe that's the

[33:39] morning and his family and uh but here
[33:43] in acts like to read about eight verses
[33:46] here and um then we're going to go to
[33:50] Romans 10 and read a verse there but
[33:54] here in Acts 3 and 1 it says then Peter
[33:56] and John went up together into the
[33:59] temple at The Hour of Prayer being the
[34:04] ninth hour and a certain man lame from
[34:08] his mother's womb was carried whom they
[34:12] laid daily at the Gate of the temple
[34:16] which is called the beautiful to ask
[34:20] arms of them that enter into the
[34:24] temple who seeing Peter and John about
[34:27] to go in into the temple ask of arms and
[34:31] Peter fastened his eyes upon him with
[34:35] John and said look on us and he gave
[34:40] heed unto them expecting to receive
[34:43] something from them and Peter said
[34:47] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[34:51] I have give unto thee in the name of
[34:56] Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[34:59] walk and he took him by the right hand
[35:03] and lifted him up and he immediately his
[35:06] feet and ankles and Bones received
[35:11] strength and he leaped up and stood and
[35:15] walked and entered with them into the
[35:18] temple walking and leaping and praising
[35:22] God let's go to Romans
[35:25] 10 Romans 10 and 17 it says so the so
[35:30] then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[35:34] by the word of God if I can Minister a
[35:38] little thought this morning brother
[35:41] brandom has already preached this sermon
[35:43] before and I
[35:45] just brother wendle was ministering the
[35:48] other day and he talked about
[35:50] experience he just kind of went over
[35:53] just a minute of it and then he just
[35:55] kept on preaching his thought but a
[35:57] personal experience with God a personal
[36:03] experience with god let's just bow our
[36:06] heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[36:10] just love you father God Lord I'm
[36:13] shaking in my shoes this morning Lord
[36:16] Lord these are your people Lord Lord we
[36:19] have our guest here here this morning
[36:22] Lord and Lord we just ask you lord to
[36:25] bless them Father God bless each and
[36:28] every heart that's in this room father
[36:30] God lord those that couldn't make it to
[36:33] church this morning for being sick or
[36:36] they're out of town Lord we just ask you
[36:39] father God to be with them Lord we just
[36:42] ask you Lord to take complete control of
[36:45] the service this morning move me aside
[36:48] Lord and you speak through this vessel
[36:50] as you've done many many times to the
[36:52] vessels that's up in this Pulpit father
[36:54] God lord just be with us Lord be with
[36:57] brother Wendell father God as he
[36:59] ministers this morning be with Brother
[37:01] John this morning as he ministers this
[37:03] morning there in Clare Moore father God
[37:06] lord be with brother Josh as he's out
[37:08] ministering the gospel father God lord
[37:12] we just ask you Lord Jesus to come once
[37:15] again speak to our hearts Lord let us
[37:19] have that great experience with you Lord
[37:21] Jesus every day have a new experience of
[37:25] the word of God in our lives Lord weay
[37:27] pray in Jesus name we pray amen you may
[37:30] be
[37:32] seated experience with God a personal
[37:37] experience a lot of times that people
[37:40] say that they they believe in God they
[37:44] given their heart to God I believe in
[37:45] that I believe that they've been been
[37:49] saved but we can't live off of just that
[37:53] experience there's a foundation that you
[37:55] and I have to to to uh get up and that
[37:58] is Christ
[38:00] Jesus and then we're on that Foundation
[38:03] we have to build our life upon it and it
[38:07] takes the Holy Spirit to help you and I
[38:10] to have these experiences with God but
[38:14] we have to be willing to use our ears
[38:17] instead of our
[38:19] mouths okay because when we use our ears
[38:22] then we're following something that's
[38:25] being spoke of
[38:27] a lot of times we let our minds wander
[38:31] and then we speak and then we
[38:33] move our minds are
[38:36] corrupted we were born shape of iniquity
[38:39] speaking
[38:40] Lies We have to have a new mind a new
[38:43] spirit so that we can even have
[38:45] fellowship with God right without those
[38:48] two we will never get close to God that
[38:51] old man will not ever get close to God
[38:54] because he's always thinking that he
[38:56] knows more than God
[38:58] when we do things that we know that's
[39:00] against the word of God you are placing
[39:03] yourself over God speak when he says not
[39:06] to do
[39:07] something and you say and I say that we
[39:10] have an experience with God when we are
[39:12] being rebellious absolutely to the word
[39:14] of God there is an experience that you
[39:18] might have had one day but you have to
[39:20] have a new experience with God every
[39:22] single day if this great man Paul had to
[39:26] Die daily how much more than today that
[39:29] we need to die that we got a whole lot
[39:32] more junk in our lives today than Paul
[39:34] did he only had knives and swords and
[39:37] chop
[39:39] blockes you serve God get your head cut
[39:42] off you're in glory before the last drop
[39:45] of blood drips off of your body but
[39:49] today it's a mind battle that we have
[39:52] and this mind has to be cleaned it has
[39:55] to be Washed by the Water of the word it
[39:57] has to be so clean and squeaky clean so
[40:00] that Mighty God can come and speak to
[40:02] you softly to lead you and guide you to
[40:06] the promised land you need experiences
[40:09] with God every single day of Our
[40:13] Lives there's people out there do not
[40:16] read the Bible but they're looking at
[40:19] you because you confess of being a
[40:22] Christian you say that you sisters live
[40:25] of Godly character because the Bible
[40:27] says you should have long hair it's the
[40:30] glory for a woman to have long
[40:33] hair they can see long hair on a lot of
[40:36] women in
[40:38] Hollywood but their character is of this
[40:42] world okay but you have a responsibility
[40:47] brother William has a responsibility to
[40:49] be an open book to the people and the
[40:52] only open book that we need to give the
[40:55] people is this word right here
[40:58] and if we're not living this
[41:00] word then we're Hypocrites
[41:04] okay and so it's important to have that
[41:09] a personal
[41:10] relationship with God this great
[41:13] experience with
[41:16] God it's very
[41:19] important we can see here in the
[41:21] scriptures where John and Peter they had
[41:26] an experience
[41:28] but before they got this experience
[41:30] Peter cut a soldier's ear
[41:33] off he would he would fight for God boy
[41:37] let me I'll fight for you no he wanted
[41:39] you just to believe we don't need to
[41:43] fight the only person you need to fight
[41:46] is to go into the mirror and look at
[41:47] that man or that woman and fight that
[41:51] person by the word of God let Thy word
[41:55] flow into our minds and down into our
[41:57] heart to change you and I thinking that
[42:00] is the most important thing of a
[42:02] Believer has to do is to get your mind
[42:06] clean so the presence of God can come in
[42:09] there and have a personal relationship
[42:11] with you and
[42:12] me when we can overcome our own mind
[42:16] there's not a devil in hell there's not
[42:19] a demon in Hell that'll ever tempt you
[42:22] he can sit there and Bluff you and tell
[42:25] you this but you'll have the power to
[42:27] say get behind me
[42:28] Satan you can walk by somebody that's
[42:32] asking for arms asking for prayer you
[42:34] can stand there and
[42:36] say in the name of Jesus get up and walk
[42:41] and every devil has to flee and God's
[42:45] obligated to his word he says you lay
[42:47] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[42:51] if your mind is set on the word of God
[42:54] and the word of God has giving you an
[42:56] experience and you know that experience
[42:58] come from God and you know who you are
[43:01] in Christ Jesus you can speak to that
[43:04] mountain and that mountain has to
[43:08] go a true story about a a lady that had
[43:12] to go around the mountain to go to her
[43:15] doctor's
[43:17] appointment one day she spoke to God and
[43:20] said God I want a road right through the
[43:23] mountain so I can go right straight
[43:25] through it I believe you're going to do
[43:30] it month later comes up and here comes
[43:33] big tractors big dump
[43:36] trucks after five years there was a road
[43:39] that was made through the through the
[43:41] through that Canyon through that
[43:45] mountain God answered her prayer by one
[43:48] rock at a time one truck clo at a
[43:52] time it might take a while but it's you
[43:56] being steadfast in the word and you wait
[43:59] upon the Lord and God said he will renew
[44:01] your strength as
[44:06] Eagles but this personal relationship
[44:09] this personal experience with God will
[44:12] change your thinking it will change the
[44:16] absolute life in your life to
[44:21] good aren't we tired of struggling
[44:25] aren't we tired of being sick
[44:28] aren't you tired of just having mind
[44:30] battles aren't you tired of being
[44:39] old but if you have the joy of God in
[44:42] your life you won't worry about how old
[44:44] you are you're just getting closer to
[44:46] your
[44:47] destination you'd have joy unspeakable
[44:49] and full of Glory you'll be able to
[44:51] stand in the presence of God and say
[44:54] I've walked that walk I've talked that
[44:56] walk and God led me through
[44:58] it you elderly people have something for
[45:02] as younger people it is called a
[45:06] testimony the experiences that you got
[45:09] from God will help our young people out
[45:12] don't be afraid to talk to them love
[45:16] them and watch the salvation of God come
[45:19] through your lips down into somebody's
[45:22] ear and change their heart
[45:27] I've seen love take bitterness out of
[45:31] people
[45:35] complexes there's one young lady that
[45:37] years ago I ministered at a church that
[45:40] had devil just beating on her and
[45:42] beating on her she couldn't even look
[45:45] up but after a little while she already
[45:48] recognizing that the spirit of God was
[45:50] going to deliver her and she accepted
[45:54] it and the fear you can see come off of
[45:57] her face and gladness and today she's
[46:00] married and she's praising God and she
[46:03] has a husband and she loves him and
[46:06] she's
[46:09] happy why
[46:11] because a preacher
[46:13] cared the preacher's wife cared and a
[46:17] preacher's daughter cared and went up
[46:19] there and laid hands on her and prayed
[46:21] for her and she say she got
[46:25] Victory we got children up here
[46:28] sometimes at the altar crying out to God
[46:30] and you Mas and daddies just sit there
[46:32] in your seat Well I'm waiting on God to
[46:34] tell me to go up there that's your child
[46:38] why God when he sees you hurting he's
[46:40] there for you you should be laying hands
[46:42] on him and tell them I'm right here with
[46:44] you in your p in your trials I'm going
[46:46] to go with
[46:48] you you
[46:49] must get this thing cleaned up cuz your
[46:53] way of thinking is
[46:55] wrong you should be blessed to see your
[46:58] children come to the
[47:01] altar I remember the time when I came to
[47:04] the altar when I was a young man and my
[47:07] brother Dale come and
[47:09] crying saying oh God this
[47:13] day he's going to have trials that he
[47:16] he's going to need need you to help him
[47:19] with
[47:22] Lord because why they need a personal
[47:26] EXP experience with God the same God
[47:28] that you have an experience
[47:36] with cuz Peter and John knew who they
[47:39] were yeah that's why that lame guy
[47:42] wasn't no lame no
[47:43] more he was shouting and shouting the
[47:47] victory from
[47:50] birth how much more he'll do for you if
[47:53] you just
[47:54] believe Hallelujah
[47:58] but it comes by faith comes by hearing
[48:01] and hearing by the word of
[48:05] God here's this great Man Called Moses
[48:08] in the
[48:10] Bible he was taught at a little age that
[48:13] he was going to be the deliverer of
[48:15] Israel Israel was in 400 years of
[48:19] bondage and in this bondage these people
[48:22] believe that there was a a deliver
[48:24] that's coming after that first 100 years
[48:27] I guarantee you they had a lot of Egypt
[48:30] theology in their
[48:32] life they had a lot of dogmas in their
[48:35] life their thinking was a lot different
[48:38] than it was when when their grandpappy
[48:41] brought them their daddies across there
[48:44] in those tribes that came they saw the
[48:46] mighty hands of God and they saw things
[48:49] they saw what God did for them there in
[48:51] E day of Egypt when Joseph was standing
[48:53] there that he was right under the throne
[48:56] of pharaoh was able to speak in Pharaoh
[48:59] when that when he was not on the throne
[49:01] he had thus said Pharaoh in his
[49:05] life gave them the best part of the land
[49:09] he gave them everything they needed to
[49:11] be right there
[49:13] beside
[49:16] Joseph but because of the Harden of God
[49:19] putting down on the Egyptians started
[49:21] making test Masters starting to beat on
[49:25] them and get them to a place where they
[49:27] were scared of the
[49:29] Egyptians getting their minds off of God
[49:32] getting their minds into theology
[49:34] getting them their their minds on what
[49:36] they had to go do and build
[49:38] bricks they put a bondage into their
[49:40] minds and the only thing they knew in
[49:42] their mind was to get up in the morning
[49:44] and go put their feet in the mud and
[49:46] stomp mud all day
[49:50] long the values of that race was falling
[49:55] apart because now their their belief
[49:58] system was shot because of
[50:01] pharaoh because when they was trying to
[50:03] pray to God Pharaoh would kill them
[50:06] because they should have been worshiping
[50:09] him but here was a man that was raised
[50:11] up by his Hebrew Mama telling him you
[50:14] are the man that God has sent to this
[50:17] country to take Israel
[50:20] out but see he had too much of pharaoh
[50:24] knowledge in his mind he had had the
[50:27] Theology of of being a the man of the
[50:31] hour one day so he says well I'm going
[50:33] to use my
[50:35] power to deliver my people I'll be
[50:39] Pharaoh one day and I will deliver them
[50:43] but see he jumped the jumped it because
[50:46] now he's starting to see these task
[50:48] Masters beat his family and he kept
[50:51] seeing it and before long the the the
[50:54] thrive in their mom in his heart wanted
[50:57] to kill that Egyptian the one that he
[51:01] had power over to say
[51:03] stop go find something else to beat on
[51:06] that tree over
[51:07] there but instant he killed that
[51:10] Egyptian and when that Egyptian blood
[51:12] fell of the ground now fear come on his
[51:15] arm when fear comes upon a Believer or
[51:18] or a man or a woman it will take you
[51:21] from the presence of God
[51:24] immediately because now you're going
[51:26] into to reasoning now you're going into
[51:28] a place where now you're in the darkness
[51:30] of it and now you're listening to
[51:32] something else instead of God and that
[51:35] is what happens to a Believer when the
[51:37] Satan comes in and tries to make you
[51:39] think that you're so sick you can't go
[51:42] to
[51:45] church I would rather come to church and
[51:48] fall asleep in church but be
[51:51] here and say Pastor I'm taking these
[51:54] drugs it makes me sleepy I don't know
[51:56] what's going to happen but if you see me
[51:57] asleep just walk up there and pray for
[51:59] me cuz I need it that's why I'm here
[52:01] this is a house of a h it could be a
[52:05] hotel it could be a House of Prayer it
[52:07] could pay all kinds of things but this
[52:08] is a house of a hospital house for the
[52:13] sick we could be sick physically we can
[52:16] be sick in the mind we could be sick in
[52:18] the heart but we come to
[52:20] church to have an experience with who
[52:24] God
[52:26] I understand you have fevers and you
[52:28] have these
[52:30] things but when we start listening to
[52:33] Satan and you start thinking of your
[52:35] symptoms he's already got
[52:38] you child of God I'm not saying that
[52:41] you're not a child of God I'm not saying
[52:43] that you don't have the Holy Ghost I'm
[52:45] saying now your mind is blocked off and
[52:48] you don't have the opportunity to have
[52:50] it flowing with God now it's has
[52:53] thoughts in your mind saying yeah
[52:55] they're going to be t talking about you
[52:57] cuz you miss
[53:00] church because you have a
[53:02] headache and we know brother wle comes
[53:05] to church with a massive
[53:07] headache yeah and it's nobody in the
[53:10] church that's saying it it's Satan
[53:13] putting it in you and now you believe
[53:15] somebody in the church is against
[53:18] you and now you're getting to a place
[53:21] now complexes start happening and now
[53:23] you don't want to be around nobody and
[53:25] now you search yourself away in a corner
[53:27] somewhere and say it's just me and God
[53:29] now no it's not you and God it's you and
[53:32] the devil in that corner because God
[53:34] standing at the pulpit waiting for you
[53:35] to come in and deliver you from those
[53:43] things we got to get to a place that
[53:46] this is not controlling you but your
[53:49] heart is being controlled by
[53:53] Jesus
[53:55] right but so so here he was he was
[53:57] standing
[53:58] there he runs off in the
[54:02] wilderness and Moses for 40 years
[54:05] learned everything to be a pharaoh now
[54:09] he's in 40 years in the desert and in
[54:13] that desert now he's a sheep hurder in
[54:16] the desert he lives on
[54:18] rocks his shoes wear out he doesn't have
[54:22] good perfume anymore and take showers he
[54:24] has to just go out in in a tub somewh
[54:26] and wash
[54:29] off and then he falls in love with this
[54:33] woman that argues with him
[54:39] constantly he's a man of the house but
[54:41] he's
[54:42] not because when he says something she
[54:45] does the opposite because she's got too
[54:48] much man theology in
[54:54] her so he had has to deal with that he
[54:58] has to deal with a
[55:00] B but after about 40 years now he's just
[55:03] can't even talk Egyptian he can't even
[55:05] do it he doesn't even have a burden for
[55:08] his people
[55:10] anymore he forgot his calling he forgot
[55:14] everything except only thing he knows
[55:17] now is to say yes ma'am to his wife and
[55:20] put the clothes that he tells him to put
[55:21] on and he goes out there and he leads
[55:24] sheep all right
[55:31] but one day he's looking up and he sees
[55:33] this bush burning and he's wondering why
[55:36] is this bush still burning and not
[55:38] burning up something on the inside is
[55:41] saying this is this is weird I got to
[55:43] see this thing but you can't go up on
[55:45] that
[55:49] mountain but it enticed him so much that
[55:52] he had to go see what this thing was all
[55:54] about
[55:58] there's a burning bush here in the
[55:59] church it's here every day it just wants
[56:03] to speak to you we're just got to be
[56:07] here so there he is he walks up to this
[56:10] mountain day and he sees this Burning
[56:13] Bush and when he gets up to
[56:16] it it's the weirdest burn that he's ever
[56:19] seen in his life and all of a sudden it
[56:22] speaks to him says take off thy shoes
[56:24] you're on Holy Ground
[56:31] immediately he takes his shoes off cuz
[56:35] he's
[56:39] scared and he looks at him and says I
[56:42] have a work for you to do
[56:45] Moses a work for me to do who are
[56:51] you he I got to work for you Moses
[56:56] you see that Shepherd stick in your hand
[56:59] you're going to go down to Egypt and
[57:02] you're going to be a
[57:04] deliverer you're going to be a
[57:06] oneman
[57:09] Invasion a oneman army with that Crooked
[57:13] Stick and you're going to go down there
[57:15] in front of pharaoh and you're going to
[57:17] look at him in the eye and you're not
[57:19] going to be afraid of him you're going
[57:21] to tell him to let my people go and if
[57:24] he doesn't do it after so many times I'm
[57:27] going to throw plagues upon him one
[57:29] after the other and I'm going to harden
[57:31] his heart and I'm going to soften his
[57:33] heart but one day I'm going to soften
[57:36] his heart up so much that he's going to
[57:38] hurt for his his
[57:42] Disobedience oh I can't do that I can't
[57:44] even speak their language I stutter I
[57:47] stutter I can't do this Peter I mean
[57:51] Moses puts your hand under your cloak he
[57:55] sticks it in there pull it back out and
[57:58] it's leprosy and he
[58:03] goes Moses put it back in and he sticks
[58:08] it back in he says Moses bring it back
[58:13] out and it was just like it was before
[58:16] the
[58:18] leopard what was God doing to
[58:22] him he was building character in his
[58:25] faith
[58:26] so that he could believe in that burning
[58:29] bush so that he would be what he was he
[58:33] had to be reminded who he
[58:35] was he let all the complexes all the
[58:39] experien that he had when he was a
[58:40] little boy go right out the window he
[58:42] could say oh I had that experience with
[58:45] my mama she told me I was a
[58:48] deliverer what happened I ran like crazy
[58:51] out of Egypt cuz I killed
[58:56] an
[58:59] Egyptian he was a
[59:02] coward but he was a deliver
[59:07] her so he he shows him some signs and he
[59:11] said now you're going to go and your
[59:14] brother Aaron's going to meet you
[59:16] halfway and you guys are going to go and
[59:19] you're going to be a god of those people
[59:21] and Aaron's going to be your
[59:23] prophet and you're going to go down
[59:25] there there and you're going to speak
[59:28] and Aaron's going to
[59:30] do what you tell him to do and you are
[59:34] going to March out with
[59:40] 2,000 of my people out of
[59:48] Egypt but he had to
[59:51] be a
[59:53] personal experience with God God
[59:56] Almighty before he could stand there
[59:58] with that stick and say I'm Moses and
[1:00:01] I'm going to down there and tell
[1:00:04] FK Egyptians how to eat and how to do
[1:00:08] this and when he was going down there he
[1:00:11] went down there he had the charge and he
[1:00:14] went down there and he was the only one
[1:00:17] that can walk up to pharaoh and say
[1:00:19] Pharaoh let my people go and if you've
[1:00:21] done I'm going to give you a whole bunch
[1:00:22] of frogs
[1:00:26] now it's changed from pharaoh to God now
[1:00:30] God is going to put the task Mas upon
[1:00:34] Him devil is your Taskmaster today and
[1:00:38] if you're letting your mind take over
[1:00:41] your heart then he's going to beat you
[1:00:44] and he's going to beat you and he's
[1:00:46] going to beat you but if you can stand
[1:00:48] there on the Promises of God and
[1:00:50] recognize who you are this
[1:00:54] morning and the only way you're going to
[1:00:57] acknowledge who you are is get in the
[1:00:59] Bible and see what God has done for you
[1:01:02] why did he redeem you because he wanted
[1:01:05] you to be a son and daughter of God he
[1:01:08] wanted the power of himself living in
[1:01:11] you to do the Greater
[1:01:15] Works God needs
[1:01:19] man to speak his word through we need a
[1:01:23] God to live through us
[1:01:27] yeah so you want these task Masters to
[1:01:30] leave you
[1:01:32] alone go find that that backside of the
[1:01:36] desert experience and find
[1:01:39] God and that experience needs to grow
[1:01:42] every day stronger and stronger and
[1:01:45] stronger while you're doing more of God
[1:01:48] than you're doing anything else and you
[1:01:49] watch God fight your battles
[1:01:56] we need a check up on our lives well I'm
[1:01:59] doing just fine Brother
[1:02:01] William what about you you're struggling
[1:02:04] you don't have no
[1:02:07] work yeah you're right I don't have no
[1:02:09] work so I'm taking all my time my spare
[1:02:12] time and I'm listening to tapes I'm
[1:02:15] praying I'm seeking God for you I'm
[1:02:18] seeking God for my salvation I'm seeking
[1:02:20] everything a
[1:02:23] possibility because he's in in
[1:02:29] control and because he's in control of
[1:02:31] my life I don't
[1:02:37] worry check's been flowing
[1:02:40] in getting a little bit of work from a
[1:02:42] brother another one just offered to have
[1:02:44] me help him for a few days what is it
[1:02:48] the body taking care of the
[1:02:52] toe and it's an ugly toe but praise God
[1:02:55] I'm a part of the toe
[1:02:58] but
[1:02:59] see I had an experience with him long
[1:03:02] time ago and I built on that Foundation
[1:03:05] of Christ Jesus and I'm building a house
[1:03:09] because one of these days this this soul
[1:03:11] is going to go out of this house into a
[1:03:14] glorified body house it's not going to
[1:03:17] be sinful no more it's not going to ache
[1:03:20] and pains anymore it's going to be just
[1:03:22] like
[1:03:24] him that's same Jesus that rose from the
[1:03:27] dead that same body that he was standing
[1:03:29] there walking down the the road to
[1:03:32] Damascus and talking to the two two
[1:03:34] Hebrew men talking about himself telling
[1:03:37] them about it and then when he goes
[1:03:38] inside they they they asked him please
[1:03:40] come in come in come and eat supper with
[1:03:43] us he goes in and when he breaks the
[1:03:44] bread he opens her eyes and he there he
[1:03:47] is he's Rising again what would that do
[1:03:51] to us if he walk into this room this
[1:03:54] morning physically
[1:04:00] nothing because he doesn't come in that
[1:04:02] for me no more he will come back but
[1:04:04] we're going to meet him in the air now
[1:04:07] he comes in the spirit realm called the
[1:04:09] Holy Ghost and if we can just die out to
[1:04:12] our own selves let this mind be washed
[1:04:15] by the word of God and hear what the
[1:04:17] word of God says and do the holy spirit
[1:04:21] will fall upon you and it will change
[1:04:24] your life life it will be your
[1:04:28] earnest of your adoption and when you
[1:04:32] get that full adoption in God your
[1:04:35] body's changed in a moment in a twinkle
[1:04:37] of an eye but this
[1:04:41] experience has to be something from
[1:04:45] God as a relationship back and forth we
[1:04:49] can sit there and read this Bible and
[1:04:51] know exactly what it
[1:04:53] says but you haven't have to have an
[1:04:55] experience erence with
[1:04:58] that in your life something has to
[1:05:02] happen in your life so that you can have
[1:05:05] faith to
[1:05:08] believe but if you're just going to sit
[1:05:10] there and look at me like a mule at a
[1:05:12] gate it's not going to help you until
[1:05:15] you clean this
[1:05:18] out because when you clean this out it
[1:05:21] doesn't matter who's standing here
[1:05:23] you're going to say that's nothing but
[1:05:24] the truth because I've been reading in
[1:05:25] the Bible I've been reading the message
[1:05:28] I've been listening to the tapes I've
[1:05:29] been listening to my pastor and
[1:05:32] everything you're saying lines up
[1:05:33] exactly what the scriptures father help
[1:05:36] me to get closer to you oh God and
[1:05:39] things will change in your life you
[1:05:41] won't be bitter to pour towards of
[1:05:44] anybody a lot of times we get complexes
[1:05:47] against ourselves and we don't even know
[1:05:49] it so we keep apologizing to everybody
[1:05:52] we think has has offended and you
[1:05:55] haven't offended nobody it's Satan just
[1:05:57] has you
[1:06:01] bound now
[1:06:03] notice when they came out of
[1:06:07] Egypt God gave them gold
[1:06:11] silver everything all is their cattles
[1:06:14] they had their bread they had everything
[1:06:16] they had and much
[1:06:18] more but when they came across the Red
[1:06:22] Sea something changed
[1:06:27] when they got across on the other side
[1:06:30] the bread gave out God always provides
[1:06:34] way that night when they went to bed I
[1:06:38] can see the prophet go out and pray the
[1:06:42] next morning when they woke up they
[1:06:45] looked all around over the ground and
[1:06:49] they were Mana laying all over the
[1:06:52] ground like frost
[1:06:55] it tasted like honey and wafer they went
[1:07:00] out and began to pick it up and eat it
[1:07:03] oh it was wonderful Mana very beautiful
[1:07:07] type of our Mana today the whole
[1:07:12] Wilderness Journey was we can type our
[1:07:16] life just like them we needed to
[1:07:19] deliver we needed somebody to show up
[1:07:22] and tell us how to get back to the
[1:07:25] original Pentecost not a church
[1:07:29] Pentecost but the original Pentecost
[1:07:32] this right
[1:07:36] here we needed to know
[1:07:40] who was going to deliver
[1:07:43] us we need to know that experience in
[1:07:46] that God that died on Calvary to save
[1:07:49] yours and my soul that same God's Not
[1:07:52] only saving your soul he's coming and
[1:07:54] wants to live in inside of you so if you
[1:07:57] give him the premium of your life he
[1:07:59] will clean you up from the bottom of
[1:08:01] your feet to the top of your head you
[1:08:03] won't stink you won't have no doubt
[1:08:06] you'll have complete faith in your life
[1:08:09] if you let God control your life your
[1:08:12] money finances if you let God control
[1:08:15] your finances he'll make every Bill
[1:08:19] stretch out I mean every bit of your
[1:08:21] money stretch out and pay bills
[1:08:26] well he doesn't do it for me well maybe
[1:08:30] you need to look in the mirror and see
[1:08:31] where you're
[1:08:34] at well I had I had the Holy Ghost 40
[1:08:37] years
[1:08:39] ago yeah brother BR says every
[1:08:42] experience will die if you don't add
[1:08:45] more to
[1:08:48] it don't matter how many times you tell
[1:08:50] me of the scriptures doesn't tell me how
[1:08:52] much you read your Bible I want to want
[1:08:55] to see a life and you guys have the
[1:08:57] opportunity to look back back to me and
[1:08:59] say brother William I want to see your
[1:09:01] life you're going to sit up there and
[1:09:03] preach let me see your life let me see
[1:09:07] you dedicated to your God that you're
[1:09:09] preaching on this
[1:09:11] morning come over to my house go down
[1:09:14] the road with
[1:09:16] me let's see what I got in my
[1:09:20] house I got a big couch and two big old
[1:09:23] chairs and three dogs and a beautiful
[1:09:27] wife that's what I got my entertainment
[1:09:30] is watching them dogs fight with each
[1:09:32] other over a
[1:09:34] bone unless my son-in-law comes over and
[1:09:36] then he entertains
[1:09:42] me the things he laughs about I laugh
[1:09:45] because of
[1:09:46] him but you know what I need
[1:09:49] him there's a lot of times that I've
[1:09:51] been down in the dumps and he shows up
[1:09:53] says you got to listen to this
[1:09:56] and it's the stupidest thing but I'm
[1:09:57] watching him and I laugh my guts out and
[1:10:00] before he leaves I feel better I'm not
[1:10:02] thinking about my nonsense I'm not
[1:10:04] thinking about work I'm not thinking
[1:10:05] about
[1:10:07] anything but then brother Michael will
[1:10:09] show up you go oh no what he
[1:10:14] want and we'll sit there at the
[1:10:16] lunchtime in my my house and sit there
[1:10:19] and eat he'll eat his sandwich and his
[1:10:21] wife fix him and I'll eat whatever I fix
[1:10:24] or Sharon fix fixes with fixes and I'm
[1:10:27] sitting there we're talking about the
[1:10:29] Lord what is
[1:10:32] it communion around what we
[1:10:38] believe I'm
[1:10:39] getting strength from
[1:10:43] him that guy that was laying there for
[1:10:45] arms he needed strength he needed
[1:10:48] somebody to come that would change his
[1:10:54] life that man was a burden to those
[1:10:57] people they they had to pick him up and
[1:10:59] carry him and put him right there and
[1:11:02] every man and woman that come through
[1:11:04] there to go pray had to see that guy
[1:11:07] begging and they couldn't do nothing for
[1:11:10] him so I throw a little bit of change in
[1:11:15] there but that change didn't make him
[1:11:17] strength in his legs all the food that
[1:11:20] he ate didn't strengthen his legs but
[1:11:23] what strengthened his legs
[1:11:25] was a man two men that had God living
[1:11:28] inside of them that they knew who they
[1:11:31] was said get up and walk in the name of
[1:11:34] Jesus from Nazareth and reached down
[1:11:36] there with his right hand and picked him
[1:11:38] up and strength immediately came into
[1:11:41] that Man's
[1:11:45] legs and today we have seen God in this
[1:11:49] church take cancer out of sister

[1:15:42] starting to see a man come in every
[1:15:43] service and every service and you see
[1:15:45] him not having a vehicle but all of a
[1:15:47] sudden he shows up and then before long
[1:15:49] he had the money and he got him a
[1:15:50] vehicle and he started coming and God
[1:15:52] just blessed him and blessed him and
[1:15:54] blessed him and blessed him and today
[1:15:56] he's a set man totally delivered from
[1:15:59] those
[1:16:01] demons no desire whatsoever to go back
[1:16:04] into the world and smoke dough and do
[1:16:08] drugs and today a testimony to his
[1:16:12] children the one that's in jail wants to
[1:16:14] move here as soon as she gets out in
[1:16:15] about nine
[1:16:17] months because she sees him talking to
[1:16:20] her talking about God not talking about
[1:16:22] his problems talking about this but he's
[1:16:25] had an
[1:16:26] experience with
[1:16:31] God why are we struggling
[1:16:34] Church why are we struggling in our own
[1:16:38] minds what are you putting in to your
[1:16:42] minds this
[1:16:46] morning we see here
[1:16:50] David David was a young little Rudy boy
[1:16:55] taking care of his daddy's sheep one day
[1:16:58] his dad said son I want you to go to the
[1:17:00] the line of the fighting line and take
[1:17:02] this bread and this cheese and and go
[1:17:04] check on your brothers and see how
[1:17:05] they're doing tell them that I love them
[1:17:07] tell them that we're praying for them
[1:17:09] we're telling them we're with you on
[1:17:11] this and he goes and why this little
[1:17:14] fella about 16 years
[1:17:18] old he had an experience with god with
[1:17:21] those
[1:17:22] sheep one day a lion come and took a
[1:17:26] sheep and he took his his little
[1:17:29] slingshot that he had on the side of his
[1:17:31] thing and he reached to there and
[1:17:33] grabbed a smooth Rock and he flipped
[1:17:34] that thing and he killed a
[1:17:40] lion another day a bear come and stole
[1:17:43] another one and he killed the bear he
[1:17:46] knew that God Almighty was on his
[1:17:50] side you throw you go out there right
[1:17:52] now with a slingshot and go hit a bear
[1:17:54] right now between the eyeballs and watch
[1:17:56] him eat you
[1:18:02] up we have a testimony a man shoot a
[1:18:05] Grizzly 400 yards away and that thing
[1:18:07] came all the way up to about 20 feet of
[1:18:09] him before he
[1:18:11] dropped and that's a
[1:18:15] bullet it has to be God watching over
[1:18:18] his children when you're in the totally
[1:18:21] complete word of God and you are totally
[1:18:24] there God's obligated to take care of
[1:18:29] you he's obligated to take care of
[1:18:33] you but when we let this mind tell us
[1:18:36] we're too sick we're too this and we're
[1:18:39] too this and nobody loves me and this
[1:18:41] and that and all my children is going
[1:18:43] crazy and all this no sir it's time to
[1:18:48] create your own world and say Satan
[1:18:51] you're a liar and my children are just
[1:18:54] fine my husband is just fine because I'm
[1:18:57] applying the blood to their
[1:19:00] life and God is obligated to move upon
[1:19:03] that
[1:19:06] situation but we got to get this cleaned
[1:19:11] out so here was David going to go see
[1:19:14] his
[1:19:16] brothers going to see my big brothers I
[1:19:19] was always happy to go see my big
[1:19:21] brothers unless they picked on me
[1:19:25] and I always wondered way how I was
[1:19:27] going to beat him up one day when I got
[1:19:28] bigger well the size shows
[1:19:31] how but he gets there and all of a
[1:19:35] sudden he hears this boasting bully
[1:19:38] called
[1:19:42] Goliath
[1:19:45] cursing defiling the armies of God that
[1:19:49] has been promised by a
[1:19:52] prophet that every battle is yours if
[1:19:56] you
[1:20:00] believe
[1:20:02] every situation trial that you go
[1:20:05] through if you will trust him he's
[1:20:09] obligated to take care of you through
[1:20:11] that
[1:20:15] trial and he's standing there watching
[1:20:18] all these people he's looking at the
[1:20:19] king over there sitting in his boots
[1:20:21] shaking and his brothers are sitting
[1:20:23] there saying hey hey sh hush man that
[1:20:25] guy's huge he's a big old man he's seven
[1:20:28] foot tall eight foot tall hands about
[1:20:30] foot
[1:20:31] long his Spears his knife is probably
[1:20:35] about six foot
[1:20:36] long fingers are about this long he's a
[1:20:40] big man keep your mouth shut we don't
[1:20:42] want him to know where we're
[1:20:45] at but see there was something on the
[1:20:47] inside that he had an experience with
[1:20:52] God he was with God he played the
[1:20:56] instruments he sung songs he he
[1:20:58] worshiped God he seen the evidence of
[1:21:00] the God that he served there when he
[1:21:04] needed
[1:21:07] him and he looked around and says I'll
[1:21:11] go fight this
[1:21:14] Philistine this
[1:21:16] uncircumcised
[1:21:18] devil he wasn't afraid because he knew
[1:21:21] who he was in that little teeny body
[1:21:23] that he was in
[1:21:25] oh you need to hush your
[1:21:27] face all right he ain't going to shut
[1:21:29] let's take him to the
[1:21:30] king king you need put some sense into
[1:21:33] my little brother's head he thinks he
[1:21:34] can go out like that and go out there
[1:21:36] and kill that
[1:21:39] Philistine that King admired that young
[1:21:42] man's
[1:21:44] Faith but after a while that boy started
[1:21:47] looking in his eyes and says let me go
[1:21:49] out there I'll kill
[1:21:51] him finally he said okay fine you know
[1:21:54] what
[1:21:55] nobody else is going to do it I'm the
[1:21:57] biggest guy here but I ain't going to go
[1:21:58] do it cuz I'm a I'm a
[1:22:00] because he lost his first
[1:22:04] love he let his Theology of being a king
[1:22:09] do a sacrifice that he shouldn't have
[1:22:10] been
[1:22:11] doing sometimes we do sacrifices for God
[1:22:14] that we shouldn't be
[1:22:16] doing and and using it is the name of
[1:22:19] the
[1:22:20] Lord well Pastor said this but you know
[1:22:23] he's that's his opinion
[1:22:29] you know our our pastor has the
[1:22:33] authority under the Holy Ghost to run
[1:22:36] this church the way he wants to run it I
[1:22:38] just found a quote the other
[1:22:40] day so we better watch what we say about
[1:22:42] our our pastor I had to
[1:22:49] repent and so here we
[1:22:52] are he goes well then you're going to
[1:22:54] have to have this the sword you're going
[1:22:55] to have to have this and he's putting
[1:22:57] this stuff on and it's now it's a burden
[1:22:59] to him cuz he's never proved this
[1:23:01] stuff this theology is not for
[1:23:05] him he threw that theology off and says
[1:23:08] listen I don't know about that stuff but
[1:23:10] I do know this that I killed a bear one
[1:23:13] day with a power of God on me and I

[1:24:16] of his
[1:24:17] battle he didn't say the whole armies of
[1:24:20] of Israel he said Israel have faith
[1:24:25] you do what I tell you and you'll win
[1:24:27] your

[1:25:04] enemy sword and cuts his head off with
[1:25:07] it yeah all the stuff he does to you
[1:25:10] need to turn around and grab that sword
[1:25:12] and cut the devil's head off this see
[1:25:14] this morning it's your Victory get an
[1:25:17] experience with God this morning and God
[1:25:19] will fight your battles for you You' got
[1:25:22] cancer he'll take it away from you
[1:25:24] because he's looking for Faith this
[1:25:26] morning he's looking for faith in the
[1:25:28] hearts of his
[1:25:31] people hallelujah why because he's the
[1:25:34] same yesterday today and forever he's an
[1:25:36] unchanging God he's not going to say
[1:25:40] what this church over here says and this
[1:25:42] church over here says and this church
[1:25:44] over here says he's going to say I said
[1:25:46] the word says and that's where he's
[1:25:49] going to judge us he's not going to
[1:25:50] judge us by the Baptist Church he's not
[1:25:52] going to judge us by the Presbyterian
[1:25:54] he's not going to judge us by
[1:25:57] Catholics and he's not going to judge us
[1:26:00] off the White House
[1:26:03] either he's going to judge us by this
[1:26:05] word right here that proth out of the
[1:26:07] mouth of God eternal
[1:26:12] life and so now he's
[1:26:15] there and when he cuts that devil's head
[1:26:19] off the faith rose up into those men
[1:26:24] and now they have a new king his name
[1:26:27] was David because now they saw somebody
[1:26:30] that had the power of God living inside
[1:26:32] of him and they followed and they killed
[1:26:35] those
[1:26:36] Philistines now he wasn't the king at
[1:26:38] that moment but he was already promised
[1:26:42] by God that he was going to be the king
[1:26:45] but he had to go through trials he had
[1:26:47] to be proven just like you and I have to
[1:26:50] be proven to be Sons and Daughters of
[1:26:52] God and sometimes you got to prove to me
[1:26:55] and I've got to prove to you that we're
[1:26:57] Sons and Daughters of
[1:27:02] God oh praise be to God that was little
[1:27:05] David First Corinthians 2 and 4 and my
[1:27:10] speech and my preaching was not with
[1:27:13] enticing words of man's Wisdom but the
[1:27:16] demonstration of the spirit of the power
[1:27:20] your faith should not stand in the
[1:27:22] wisdom of man
[1:27:24] but in the power of
[1:27:27] God that's where your experience lies in
[1:27:30] the power of
[1:27:32] God
[1:27:36] hallelujah we see here I like to read
[1:27:39] this can I have a few more
[1:27:43] minutes oh I haven't preached very long
[1:27:45] at all hallelujah usually about this
[1:27:47] time it's already been an hour now here
[1:27:50] it says he goes just remember me brother
[1:27:54] I got a whole lot
[1:27:57] of script in the bag David had Honey in
[1:28:02] the
[1:28:03] Rock and when David would be out there
[1:28:06] with his
[1:28:07] sheep and they were
[1:28:10] sick he would go and find Limestone and
[1:28:13] he would get a little bit of that honey
[1:28:14] for himself and he' get a little bit of
[1:28:16] that honey and he put it on that Lim
[1:28:18] Stone and he'd get it up there to that
[1:28:20] little sheep and that little sheep would
[1:28:21] start licking it and what it's doing
[1:28:23] he's trying to to get that that sweet
[1:28:25] honey off but what's happening is some
[1:28:27] of that limestone's going down into that
[1:28:30] that little belly of his and it heals
[1:28:35] them I believe this
[1:28:39] morning as our prophet of God says I'm
[1:28:41] going to put the honey Upon Jesus this
[1:28:43] morning the solid rock yeah and you guys
[1:28:46] just start licking on that word of God
[1:28:49] and if you got something in your body
[1:28:51] that needs to be touched you keep on
[1:28:53] licking and God will touch
[1:28:56] you that's what the prophet of God say
[1:28:58] he said I got that little strip bag and
[1:29:01] I've got a little bit of honey for
[1:29:04] you start licking this start reading
[1:29:08] this it'll change your life
[1:29:13] yeah it ain't big flowery words it's not
[1:29:16] theology that's going to save you it's
[1:29:18] the simple things that's going to save
[1:29:19] you that's the word it's not difficult
[1:29:24] he says if you believe in my
[1:29:27] name every devil will
[1:29:31] flee he says if you
[1:29:33] repent I'll be
[1:29:36] there you ask him for forgiveness he
[1:29:40] said he'll forgive you he says if you
[1:29:42] need a need you come to me you heavy
[1:29:46] laden and I will give you rest
[1:29:54] sometimes we have to go through the
[1:29:55] things we got to go through but about a
[1:29:57] month or two maybe a year down the road
[1:30:00] all of a sudden that faith will arise up
[1:30:02] in
[1:30:03] you it's just like that little black man
[1:30:05] one
[1:30:07] day he was he was blind he couldn't see
[1:30:10] but he came up to the prayer line and
[1:30:13] that preacher prayed for
[1:30:16] him and he says you're healed in the
[1:30:19] name of the Lord
[1:30:21] Jesus he went home he told everybody was
[1:30:24] healed people says you're still blind he
[1:30:26] goes I'm Healed in the name of the Lord
[1:30:28] Jesus one day he goes go get a haircut
[1:30:31] and that old Barber was starting to make
[1:30:32] fun of him he
[1:30:35] goes I thought you said that you're
[1:30:39] healed I'm Healed in the name of Jesus
[1:30:42] and about that time his eyes
[1:30:44] opened he jumps up and he takes off
[1:30:46] running down the street he says I can
[1:30:48] see I can see I can see what is it
[1:30:52] confession
[1:30:54] speaking the word back to Satan and
[1:30:58] everyone else confession bringing it to
[1:31:00] the people showing that you believe you
[1:31:04] had a personal experience with
[1:31:11] God those that come to the Altar and
[1:31:13] leave their burdens and get up and pick
[1:31:15] their burdens back up and leave they
[1:31:17] didn't have an experience with God
[1:31:19] that's why men and women having so much
[1:31:21] TR time and stuff in these mess message
[1:31:24] today is because they see people get up
[1:31:26] and walk out get up and walk out because
[1:31:28] the preaching and the pulpit is telling
[1:31:31] they don't have to have signs and
[1:31:32] wonders no more they just need to
[1:31:35] believe well if you
[1:31:37] believe then the works that you do is
[1:31:40] going to prove that you
[1:31:42] believe you're going to be healed
[1:31:44] because you believe he's still a Healer

[1:33:54] you're going through the things you are
[1:33:56] but he's making a diamond out of
[1:33:59] you praise him for
[1:34:02] it I know some of you been battling
[1:34:05] sicknesses and battling heart problems
[1:34:08] battling these things and and and it's
[1:34:10] just wearing you down but as a little
[1:34:12] young man I want to tell you today press
[1:34:15] on sister press on my brother press on
[1:34:18] Young People Press
[1:34:21] on this race is just about out
[1:34:24] over anybody that has read the Bible can
[1:34:27] see this world is lining straight up
[1:34:30] with the what the Revelation
[1:34:34] says you don't even have to have a
[1:34:36] prophet to just read the Bible and just
[1:34:38] see the corruption that's going on but
[1:34:41] the Prophet come to bring us to a place
[1:34:43] to understand what Satan is doing at
[1:34:46] this
[1:34:47] hour he's trying to choke you to death
[1:34:51] and when you realize who you are then
[1:34:54] you can put your hand out like this and
[1:34:55] say back off
[1:34:57] devil because this fist turns into
[1:35:00] mighty God's hands and he'll knock you
[1:35:06] out
[1:35:08] why because you had this
[1:35:11] relationship this personal
[1:35:15] experience with God through the word of
[1:35:19] God it changes you in a moment and a
[1:35:22] twink of an eye
[1:35:25] I used to sit there wonder why I do go
[1:35:28] through this and why I go through that
[1:35:31] but one day I got behind a backside of
[1:35:34] the desert experience and I've never
[1:35:37] been a different change I was a changed
[1:35:39] man from that point
[1:35:41] on when I go down in the dumps the first
[1:35:44] thing I do is I push
[1:35:46] play and if I don't have a message I
[1:35:48] push some good gospel
[1:35:51] singers and I let them sing this sign on
[1:35:54] songs and I sit there and I enter in
[1:35:55] into worship and all of a sudden all the
[1:35:57] things that I go through is passed off
[1:36:00] and now I'm thinking of God I'm thinking
[1:36:02] about his promises I'm starting now I've
[1:36:04] got my mind cleared up and now he can
[1:36:06] come down and speak to me and say just
[1:36:08] speak my
[1:36:09] son speak my
[1:36:12] daughter and what you speak I'll give it
[1:36:15] to
[1:36:17] you I want these mind battles to stop
[1:36:21] lord walk away from it's
[1:36:25] done how will my children be make it
[1:36:28] Lord walk away and believe and watch him
[1:36:32] come
[1:36:35] in what is
[1:36:37] it a
[1:36:38] relationship with God Almighty himself
[1:36:41] knowing who God is is the greatest
[1:36:44] mystery of this world do you know
[1:36:48] that because they're looking at three
[1:36:50] Gods up
[1:36:51] there father
[1:36:54] Son and the Holy Ghost those three the
[1:36:57] Bible says are
[1:36:59] one you see brother
[1:37:04] William you know I'm a son I wouldn't be
[1:37:07] here and I'm a
[1:37:10] daddy that's not my
[1:37:12] name to Brianna she can call me
[1:37:16] daddy my daddy can call me
[1:37:22] son but one of these days I'll be a
[1:37:26] grandpa and my grandbaby will call me
[1:37:28] Grandpa well he call me something
[1:37:31] else but my name is
[1:37:35] William so that Holy
[1:37:37] Ghost that
[1:37:39] son and that
[1:37:41] father is
[1:37:43] God he had come down in a body to save
[1:37:48] his
[1:37:49] mankind he's the one that let sin come
[1:37:51] in the world so that he could be the
[1:37:53] Healer he's the one that let these
[1:37:55] things happen so that he
[1:37:58] can love
[1:38:00] you through your
[1:38:03] trials he's the
[1:38:05] master he's the
[1:38:07] one that chose you guys every one of you
[1:38:12] before the foundations of the world to
[1:38:14] be a Sons and Daughters of
[1:38:18] God some of us are sitting here and says
[1:38:21] man I wish my dad would brag about me
[1:38:23] like God brags about me see they're not
[1:38:27] God but God
[1:38:31] brags I got a quote where he brother
[1:38:33] Braham says
[1:38:35] that he likes testimonies so he'll let
[1:38:39] you go through a trial so that he can
[1:38:43] have a testimony through
[1:38:47] you so if you re recognize that then
[1:38:52] glorifying God through your trials
[1:38:54] because now you're going to be a
[1:38:56] testimony for God through your trial
[1:39:00] through your
[1:39:01] pain we got people in this world today
[1:39:04] and I'm almost getting ready to close
[1:39:05] I'm not going to finish didn't go the
[1:39:07] way I thought it
[1:39:08] was good there's people out there that
[1:39:11] has cancer right now that don't believe
[1:39:13] in God whatsoever and they have a peace
[1:39:14] in their
[1:39:16] heart where are they getting that peace
[1:39:20] from that peace comes from God
[1:39:24] but Satan has tapped into this
[1:39:27] world he can't create but he
[1:39:31] perverts and those people that's out
[1:39:33] there without Jesus Christ and they're
[1:39:35] getting ready to die and they don't give
[1:39:37] their heart to God they're going to die
[1:39:39] and go to
[1:39:43] hail but how can they have that
[1:39:46] peace and walking into their destruction
[1:39:50] is because the devil has pulled the wool
[1:39:54] over their
[1:39:57] eyes the world says today everyone's
[1:40:01] going to heaven because Jesus loves
[1:40:04] everybody that's a
[1:40:06] lie that man is a liar that woman is a
[1:40:11] liar my Bible says before es uh before
[1:40:15] Jacob and and uh Esau was
[1:40:19] born he loved Jacob he hated Esau
[1:40:24] saw because he knew he was going to sell
[1:40:28] his
[1:40:29] Birthright are we going to sell our
[1:40:31] Birthright to this world are we going to
[1:40:34] claim our Birthright and go to
[1:40:37] heaven okay are we going to be so
[1:40:40] stubborn and walk away from today and
[1:40:43] not get your inheritance that God has
[1:40:44] given you eternal life forever
[1:40:47] more or walk away
[1:40:51] today and
[1:40:54] accept life as it
[1:40:58] is and think you're just just fine and
[1:41:02] go out these
[1:41:04] doors and die one day and miss the
[1:41:11] Rapture uh-uh I've been in the world I
[1:41:14] dranked I smoked dope I
[1:41:17] partied I was 13 years old in bars
[1:41:19] playing pool with the big boys
[1:41:24] I did it
[1:41:26] all I'll never change what I got today
[1:41:28] for that
[1:41:30] trash that world out there will tear you
[1:41:36] up God has provided for 34 years for
[1:41:40] this
[1:41:45] boy the first
[1:41:47] 20 was tormented about this
[1:41:51] world but today
[1:41:54] I have this experience in my my heart
[1:41:57] that's burning yes burning for the
[1:42:00] kingdom of heaven and I want to know him
[1:42:03] more today than I did
[1:42:06] yesterday I want a greater experience
[1:42:08] this afternoon than I did this
[1:42:12] morning I want to know who I am more now
[1:42:16] than I did
[1:42:19] yesterday church this morning
[1:42:24] Mark
[1:42:25] 11 and 20 says and in the
[1:42:29] morning as they pass by they saw the Fig
[1:42:33] Tree
[1:42:34] die dry up from the roots Peter calling
[1:42:39] to remembrance said to him Master behold
[1:42:42] the Fig Tree which thou cursed is
[1:42:46] withered away and Jesus answered and
[1:42:49] said unto them have faith in God
[1:42:53] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:42:56] shall say in this mountain be removed
[1:42:59] and be thou cast into the sea and shall
[1:43:03] not doubt in his heart but shall believe
[1:43:07] that those things which he ha said shall
[1:43:10] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:43:14] saith therefore I say unto you what
[1:43:17] things soever you desire When you pray
[1:43:21] believe and he receive them and he shall
[1:43:24] have
[1:43:26] them praise be to God one of the
[1:43:30] greatest books in the Bible my opinion
[1:43:33] is Hebrews Hebrews 11 and 6 says but
[1:43:37] without faith is impossible to please
[1:43:40] him for he that cometh to God must
[1:43:43] believe that he
[1:43:44] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:43:48] that
[1:43:49] diligently
[1:43:51] seek him
[1:43:54] go look what diligent
[1:43:57] means to give you a little bit of an
[1:44:00] that's your guys's homework this morning
[1:44:02] go find out what it
[1:44:06] means it'll wake you
[1:44:10] up by faith Abel by faith
[1:44:15] Enoch but without faith it's
[1:44:20] impossible but by faith no
[1:44:23] by
[1:44:25] Abraham these men had faith in
[1:44:30] God but it's just a
[1:44:33] book then let it come alive just believe
[1:44:36] watch out watch God show you he's
[1:44:40] real I know he's
[1:44:44] real I had a cousin at the hospital back
[1:44:48] in New Mexico there was dying
[1:44:51] coma he was out
[1:44:55] his mama wanted me to come up and pray
[1:44:57] for
[1:44:58] him I got up there and nervous as a
