Amen to bring you back to him you were in a fallen condition lost in a in in sin and Decay but because of his great love for you amen he paid that price for you aren't you just thankful for that here today I'm so thankful amen good to see everyone here tonight in the house of the Lord and I trust everyone is doing well and and uh man just just uh always good to see uh good to see God's people out here on a Wednesday night praise the Lord and uh good to see brother Simeon brother Simeon turned 9 years old [Music] [Applause] yesterday we sure do love brother Simeon and we're so thankful uh for him and and um amen we hope he had a good birthday yesterday praise the Lord and He is accepting birthday presents so if anyone wants to send him to his address what's your add addess amen so uh yeah he'll take cash tonight meet you at the door amen but uh we we definitely appreciate brother Simon and U it's good to be in the house of the Lord let's look here in in the book of uh Revelations the 2 chapter and and we have we have read the same verse um for the last three or four Wednesdays he that hath an ear let him hear and that that verse means so much because if you don't have an ear amen you can't hear and so um but we're going to read that to you again here in or read it together and uh maybe you can just read it with me here in Revelations 2 and 11 and let's just all repeat it together he that hath ear let him hear what the spirit sayth unto the churches and I say amen amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you for your love and your your many blessings that you have given us thank you Lord for always hearing us and allowing us to Lord have this this privilege of of of your word and having an ear to to hear what you're saying and Lord we ask tonight that you would just speak to our hearts I ask Lord that you would Lord just be uh with with everyone that is that is uh that is here and those that may not be feeling well at home I just pray that your Holy Spirit would be with them Lord we need you tonight you're the teacher just ask Lord that you would open our eyes and our ears to hear and see in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here tonight and um so we've we've been on um brother uh brandom has been dealing with the with the uh Holy Ghost the the last um uh two or three uh Wednesday nights and um so we dealt one night where where we had the fanaticism uh the there was there were those that were claiming they they had the manifestations and so then they begin to judge one another their spirituality by by the gifts and the performances and the things of that nature and we found that Christ was not even in that at all that the devil can can imitate any of the nine spiritual gifts he can um he he can he can do a pretty good job at it and then this last uh then we dealt this last Wednesday night with um the another another ditch and that is formalism and that is amen well I believe it's it's easy believism and that's that's where the world is today uh I I've come and shook the preacher's hand or I I belong to a certain church or I amen I you know and and so uh we found out that uh that is not eternal life neither you've believed unto eternal life but we're but we you receive eternal life amen when you receive the Holy Ghost and so it's important don't ever let the devil tell you you've arrived amen if the power of the holy spirit is not there amen and if there's not a burning deep down in desire for the for the word of God to have its effect in your life more than anything else more than your pet feelings your pet emotions or amen your pet doctrines or anything of that nature if there's if there's nothing within you amen if there's not that solid foundation for that then you need a new birth you've got to have a new birth it's it's it's it's a total different way of thinking it's a total different way of of of seeing the word it's a to total different way of believing you are a new creature when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and so we we went with last last uh uh week we we we looked at um you know at the one that um that there in 147 we'll just go back and read that to you at at at the um second paragraph down there 147 you know he says what what has caused this misunderstanding the answer is experience we have gone by experience and not the word away with experience as your measuring line there is only one Plum line only one rod and that is the word now watch carefully and get this Peter said repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed this is the whole of our problem right here people repent of their sins they get baptized in water but they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost you believe unto receiving the spirit Believing on Jesus is the step in the right direction which is toward the Holy Ghost but the people stop there they go as far as water then stop they believe and then stop the Bible does not not say you receive when you believe it says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe the exact literal translation is did you having previously believed received the Holy Ghost and the people believe and then stop you don't receive the Holy Ghost when you believe unto him having repented you go on and receive the Holy Ghost so so we could see that how that the that that the the how that this is really become a um this is this and I I you know you being my church I I just feel like I need to say it but but we got too many message Believers that are just amen that have thrown aside the power of the Holy Ghost and if you believe then then you've got it and and so they have fought so hard against emotionalism and fought so hard against G the gifts and and and brother brandham had brother brandham he was he had visions and dreams and prophecy and he spoke in tongues I mean that was our church age messenger and yet in a lot of these U places it's it's become so much like a morg until the the life of God's not even in it and so amen uh and and it's wrong folks the prophet came to take us back to that early church and that's what we should be be striving for don't don't sit in a in in in this church and just be satisfied if if the life of God is not permeating in you and bubbling out of you if it's not if if your ever being is is is not to please God with all of your heart and and and it doesn't cause you to to bring uh uh you know uh self-inspection on a daily Bas saying God I want to be more like you let me live this life help me to over come amen if that's not there then then we've got to get to that point where it is there amen we want the power of God's eternal life within us can you say amen that's that's that that's what we must have wi within the church and so am man and friends do not fool yourself if you do not have the Holy Ghost you are not going to make the Rapture there's only one group that'll make the Rapture and that'll be those that are sealed away into the kingdom of God Amen now that tonight we're going to be dealing with election a little bit and and um and and and I I I I I I I hope that you're catching this especially these last three services is the uh uh what brother Brandon was trying to say because he's he's he's not trying to scare you into the Holy Ghost cuz you can't be scared into it there's no way you can be scared into to it you can't you can't go on to go to heaven because well you don't going to get right with God because Grandma's there or you're you're afraid of going to hell or anything like that listen the seed of God the elect of God has something in their soul that nobody else has they want to be right with God and they will do whatever it takes because there's something on the inside of them driving them for that can you amen aren't you glad for that something on the inside of you don't ever ignore that seed of life on the inside amen and the and the convicting power of the Holy Ghost and so I I want us to go ahead and uh let's let's go ahead and and uh here at 148 and we'll start down at the very last paragraph here he says uh all right we have come this far now I want to go further and when I do I'm going to cause some emotions to rise but that is something I'm not responsible for to God and his word and the people God has sent me to or I am responsible to God and his word and the people that God has sent me to I have to be faithful in all he gives me to say in John 637 and and also verse 44 it says all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I shall in no wise cast out no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day John 1 and12 and 13 it says but as many as received him somebody say received him to them gave he power to become sons of God even to them that believe uh on his name now that sounds like this scripture here is saying okay all right so you had to do something and then God see as many as received him you had to receive him first and then those that believed on his name but then he but then he goes on it says which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but of God amen all the father hath given me will come to me and when they come they're going to listen to me amen they're going to receive me they're going to believe me because there is something special about that individual that individual God has prepared that heart before the foundation of the world to love him well that should make you want to shout amen amen now Ephesians 1:4 and 5 it says according as he somebody say he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now without getting too involved in the subject of the sovereignty of God for that would take a book in itself let me point out here that according to these vers this uh these verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride amen just uh the same as men choose their Brides today the bride today does not simply decide she is going to take a certain man for a husband no sir it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride John 15-6 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself Ephesians 1:9 and in uh Romans 9 and11 it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world now I I want you to just really really stop and and really see this now you see my pretty picture over there hallelujah amen now now out of all of humanity out of all of the thousands of the humanity God as an individual that was in or individuals that was in his mind before the foundation of the world and has that predestinated seed right there in the heart hallelujah amen right there in the in the heart now now they he looks the same she looks the same we all look like we're all human beings we all like ice cream and and and playing and and and and we all do this thing all these things together but yet there are the elect of God and you boys and girls I want you to know that God's got put something special in your heart before the world ever began he loved you with an undying love and that's why you've got a tender heart toward him that's the reason why you come and sat here at the church amen and look forward to these Wednesday nights and and and you look forward to to to doing some of those things even as a kid amen you you have something on the inside of you that really loves the Lord amen how could that be it's because God chose you and place something on the inside of your heart before you were ever even a a human being hallelujah amen even when you were out in the world when you were out there act and crazy and painting the town red and all that you had something within you right there can you say amen amen God placed that there now amen so we we'll just uh we'll continue on here now it says watch carefully now um we're at the second paragraph watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a star um a a speck of star dust before God was God God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about the those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not the thoughts of God Amen Let me let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see many things and I can say Amen to that God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as God must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is uh then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he's not omnip omniscient the best we can say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient someone shout hallelujah he has never had a new thought about anything now think about that he has God don't have new thoughts now we have we wake up in a new world every few minutes our thoughts are are we're just constantly new thoughts God has never had a new thought what God seen in his mind millions of years ago he's still thinking about the same thing no new thoughts this this will blow your mind no new thoughts but the thing is if you were in his thoughts and there was a little there was a little heart around around you when he's thinking about you and he saw you and he saw you all messed up seen you just totally sold you out in sin seen you out in drugs seen you in alcohol seen you seen your life tore apart seen maybe maybe your Mom and Daddy was just all maybe maybe maybe you maybe he's seen that you you were just a broken individual or or maybe he's seen that that you weren't going to receive the love that you deserve may I don't know whatever he saw and God looked down through that time and he says those are mine those are mine and I'm going to reach them in their conditions and I'm going to show my love and my mercy and my power to and through them well that should make you want to just love him with all of your heart I want to love him with all of my heart amen so so that so I'm so thankful now he says he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up which one one day will be translated into substance and form they are already real and eternal and part of God hallelujah so how see see how this works God always had his thoughts for Adam somebody say always Adam as his thoughts was not yet expressed Psalms 139 15 and 16 will give you a little bit of an idea of this my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrot in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did not see my I did see my substance yet being imperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none that as I said was not written about Adam but it gives you the idea and knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and it had to be expressed if you were part of God's thoughts you have to be expressed for those of you that think well I I just don't know if I'll ever receive the Holy Ghost God's already predestined it I think we just need to get a little more serious about amen about God's will in our lives and say Lord amen I I I want everything now you're going to notice as we've been going through this church AE these Church ages that it is not dependent this is not dependent upon your abilities at all it's all dependent upon what God thought at the very beginning God seen the false church God seen the real church and God placed his seed on the real believer so that they could not be deceived amen and someday you would come to life well that just that that's just wonderful is it amen all right so so it uh it says uh uh it says that as I said was not written about Adam but it gives you the idea and the knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed so when Adam was formed of the Dust of the earth and a spiritual being created by God then Adam became God's thoughts expressed and those e those Eternal thoughts were now manifested go down through the the centuries we down through the centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah John the Baptist and each one of these were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in its season then we come to Jesus the logos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he become known as the word that is what he is and will forever be now it says that he ha chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that now let me let let me inject a thought in here even our natural birth is based on Election the female ovaries produce many many eggs that is uh uh but why is it that a certain time a certain egg comes down and not another one and then amongst the the male sperm for no known reason a certain germ attaches itself to the egg While others that could have just as easily attached themselves or had a better opportunity to do so did not do so and perished there is an intell intelligence behind all this otherwise what determines whether the baby is a boy or a girl blonde or brunette light or dark type of eyes Etc with these thoughts in mind think of Joshua and Caleb did not Jesus say in John 6:49 your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead those parents that died were NE uh were necessary as the fourfathers of people of the people to whom Jesus was speaking they perished yet they were in the election of God naturally as Joshua and Caleb were spiritually but to go on these elect were not only the Eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season but these same elect are called by another name now are we doing okay so far amen so so is are we making it pretty clear amen that that out of all the all brother bram's uh appoint us back to the Israel and uh uh you know and and there were there were millions millions millions millions we just put all these millions all over amen they were just everywhere and yet there were two elected individuals that were loved by God predestinated by God to go into that Promised Land amen now we're fixing to show that in just a minute now listen we ought to be thankful and those of us that have been elected to God elected and and been given that that's something on the inside don't ever let the tree of knowledge ever ever take the the the love for this word away from you Amen brother brandom taught us that science culture religion all comes off they are fruit off the tree of life amen Satan can produce science what is science amen well science is is is your uh your inventions you get you know your smarts your uh you know everything your your iPad your your uh computer all of these things all come off that tree of knowledge amen culture uh the the the way the society is has is is is uh is set up and and the way that everything is going in our in in our society today that all comes off that tree of knowledge religion all of these churches all of these religions all of this that all comes from the devil amen and Pentecostals see they that's where that's where they messed up because now they they're out speaking in tongues jumping and shouting and doing all of these things and yet they won't line up to the word of God they'll blaspheme the word of God they'll say it's okay for me to be a homosexual it's okay for me to wear wear tight uh uh skirts and blouses it's okay it don't matter it don't matter what I when the when the prophet came in and Blasting those kinds of things the Bible blasted those things but at individual that is satisfied with their experience and not the word of God they're going to be deceived that's right you can sit right in here in this church and and and be satisfied IED with your experience oh the Lord's touched me oh and and yet you will just willfully walk against the word of God it shows that there might be something they're missing can you say Amen so we if there is something in our heart is something in our heart that says I I love the Lord am man I I I I I I want to please the Lord that seed on the inside of you though it's a little bitty seed amen when the spirit of God Christ the logos that is the tree of life now now when we talk about the two trees the they there uh for for you kids I I don't want to go off in too many uh Trails here tonight but but the tree there is not a literal tree called the Tree of Life there is not a literal tree called the knowledge of Good and Evil these are amen These Are Spiritual trees these are figuratively one Speaking of Christ the anointing the logos the word amen the pillar of fire that's the tree of life amen the tree of knowledge that's the devil that's that evil one that says I want to I want to sit in the congregation of God above the congregation and I want them to bow to me and I want them well so how did he do it the Bible says that he would end up in this last day sitting in the congregation of God God claiming to be Christian amen and while they're all lifting their hands up their hearts because they're they they say I love you Lord but the word has been totally dismissed amen and we've got this fake Christ that is set up here amen we've got the fake Christ and everyone say I love you Jesus I love you Jesus and the word of God they ignore they don't want no they won't surrender they won't obey they won't give any think is because they are worshiping the devil and they think they're worshiping Christ man so when the Holy what's going to tell the difference the Holy Ghost ignites this seed on the inside of you and all of a sudden you thinking like Christ you're acting like Christ you're wanting Christ right yes now these individuals they're all amen one in a million one in a million all of these others amen may may may may end up looking like this Hallelujah hands up in the air and worshiping God and all of this and and and ain't got nothing in here inside their heart it's dark amen all right y'all catching me so why do we need the Holy Ghost in our church only light only light striking the seed can make the seed to live and so we need the anointing in the church Hallelujah we need the power of God in the church and we need seeds to come in so when we have church services we should say Lord take the rocks out of over away from my seed take the Rocks away from my heart amen when we come into church say Lord I want this seed in me to grow and when once you start amen uh doing that getting rid of all the junk in your seat over above your seat and get rid of the video games and get rid of all that carnality stuff and quit eating off that tree of life you're going to find that the Holy Spirit Will ignite that seed it will not be legalism whatsoever that's right you won't have to make yourself pray you won't have to make yourself read you won't have to make yourself go to church you won't have it's already there am amen already there amen praise the Lord all right we all right okay I got to keep reading and quit talking amen now um so where were we at are we down through the centuries no we've already went through that uh oh we're are I'm we're on we're on 151 aren't we okay so in the first paragraph but to go on the elect were not only the Eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh and their due season but the same elect are called by another name Romans 4:16 therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to some of the seed to all somebody underline that you need a underline that all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all Romans 9:7 through1 13 neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are of the children of the flesh are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time I will come Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca had also conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Galatians 3:16 now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not to seeds as of many but as of one to thy seed which is Christ Galatians 3:29 if ye be Christ then are you Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise according to Romans 4:16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and all believers under the designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Christ and the counted the seed children uh the seed children as children of promise and the promise as having to do with election a or the choosing of God that is exactly what we have been saying these are of the royal seed of seed uh see these who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated for known of God were in the mind of God and His Thoughts well Hallelujah in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body because this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him oh I just want to Rejoice right now and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas God once was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ now then we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal L go God was manifest In the Flesh and Jesus dwelt and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn become the many membered spoken word seed manifest In the Flesh those Eternal thoughts now manifest In the Flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed somebody say we did not become seed when we got when we got filled with the Holy Ghost we were seed only seed can have a new birth now he'll say that he says we are seed or we were seed and therefore we're reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we wor seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken hold this carefully in mind and take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death shed the shed Blood Bought back his own he brought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice word and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind and there's no change in species as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing the voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of God we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodical son save me oh my father I'm returning unto thee oh my don't you just love that so so here we are amen God placed something sister Keys how easy would it be to put that the three the three rings with the Holy Spirit in it uh Body Soul and Spirit inside here I'm putting I I'm I'm putting Red Heart amen for the Holy Ghost all right so all of these guys have got black hearts they're all got they've all got black hearts because there's no election there's nothing to them now again as we tried to say last week and I sort of felt like I might have uh um uh messed things up a little bit in in the Minds last week and this we are all born off the tree of knowledge including this fellow here all of us were born off that tree of of of knowledge amen the only the only difference is is there's an elect seat God place that elect God PL he predestinated you you came in a body of Decay but within you was always the seed of God now this is not in the church age book but I wanted to to to read this he says in the in the spoken word is the Original Seed he says all of God's Sons must be the same yes sir to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again what is that spoken that's the logos that's Christ that's that's the word the living word amen so he says brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 to be born of water and spirit what does it do then it brings you right back unto the place where you should have been at the beginning Adam was not born off this tree of life a knowledge Adam was created Body Soul and Spirit off of the tree of life he was spoken word seed you should have came amen spoken word if if if if Eve hadn't to listen to Satan then then then you would come in our discreet now now nothing's changed nothing's changed I am here according to God's Eternal predestination ated plan that seed Hallelujah now this body this this body there's a lot of ups and downs and I'm in the I I am in the the the uh imperfect will of God the permissive will of God in these in this body here but the soul is right here God eternally saw me right here in 2024 but I come in a fallen body now if we would have come the way we should have came amen there there this this this hunk right here would not would would would never die this hunk right here man would never uh he he would never he he would never sin he would never fall he would never why amen because he come in that and under the power of the Holy Spirit but now we understand that God had a a had a greater plan and we can't we can't take away from that God had a greater plan he's wanting to uh bring about Redemption and show his grace and show his mercy and show his love through us can you say Amen now now he said now watch he says that's the reason for Christ's death is to bring us right back to where sons of God if Eve would have brought forth that child she would have finally done it did not God tell her to multiply and replenish the Earth but she had to walk over and play the part of a now instead of Amen instead of doing it God's way she listened to this knowledge here she listened to Satan she listened how many's understanding any questions on that amen and now any of these questions that you do have make sure you make make sure you let us uh I I I don't want to leave anyone confused amen so uhhuh yeah Fallen yeah yeah okay so all right so that's that's a good question now remember God seen that was all part of his plan God eternally he he saw the end from the beginning he saw the fall he saw and the Bible says that even before the world was ever ever began he he uh uh uh uh Christ Jesus the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world Amen so Christ said or so so this is a beautiful Plan of Redemption Adam Adam could not be deceived Adam was not deceived it was Eve and brother brandham taught us how Eve could be deceived because Adam in his in in his condition right here there's no way that he would walk away there's no way he could be deceived the only reason that Eve was uh the fell is because she was deceived all right brother bradam says she was not part of that original creation she came out of Adam Adam came straight from God she was that byproduct so she could fall because again Redemption was all a part of that Eternal plan of God uh to begin with so what happened to Adam Adam chose to follow his wife Adam chose to give to to to walk away out of that Garden to redeem his wife amen I see I see heads I see heads are turning and I'm just going to and I'm just going to put this we we've got we've got different we we we we this is a this is a uh a mixed audience and so let but but Adam put his seed in her amen sealed that womb Hallelujah Satan God could not take her because part of Adam was in her amen and that's what Christ has done with us in our fallen condition he seen us he put his seed within us so the devil could not have us and could not destroy us can you say Amen Even in our fallen condition God placed his seed there and say you can't have him am amen all right I seen some faces that were sort of a little bit skeptical of my U of of of my explanation so any questions Come on talk to me where where was that at in this B 11 116 110 to 116 yeah does it does it deal with it pretty good let's let's go let's just go right now praise the Lord amen and the beauty the the beautiful part of God now now God could not God could not cause Adam to sin God could not cause Eve to sin God knew that Adam couldn't be deceived so when he took the byproduct out of Adam amen there is where the fall came there's where the sin came but at that point is where Adam is reflecting the heartbeat of God in going after his wife in other words Adam could have stayed in that Garden alone and his wife outside the garden deceived and and and in death Adam would have lived but you know what Adam could not see himself living eternally without the girl that came from his side come on SO Adam willingly willingly walked outside the garden and died with Eve just as Christ could not stay in heaven in a in a paradise all alone when he had his Bri his his Fallen wife here are you understanding Fallen wife there and God God came down built himself a body and came in and lived his life and paid the price for his bride for his wife isn't that beautiful and that's the kind of heartbeat us guys should have every one of us husbands should should be to our wives too we we talked about our wives being that weaker vessel it should be our honor to love our wives and to express our love to our wives amen amen to to hide their weakness and to say I love you despite amen and and and and and and because us guys are in a fallen body our wives have to H has to look at that Eternal seat on the inside and say I love you too can you say Amen all right let's go back to 104 is that what you said it was 104 all right praise the Lord uh let's see here amen where do we want to break in at okay so so um let let let's go go down to um let's go down it's 103 and um just uh I mean about halfway in the middle of your book um we we've got Revelations 138 do you see that all that dwell uh upon the Earth shall worship him Satan whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world but that life could not and would not be shared in any other way than through the way of God manifest In the Flesh that was a part of his eternal and predestinated purpose this plan was to be to the praise of the glory of his grace it was the Plan of Redemption it was the Plan of Salvation now listen closely God being a savior it was necessary that he predestinate a man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of being that is 100% correct multitudes of scriptures bear bears it out a as does the very pointed verse of of Romans 11:36 for for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen man could not directly come and partake of the tree of life or see a man could not directly come partake of the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden that eternal life of the the tree had to become flesh first but before God could raise and save a sinner he had to have a sinner to raise and save man had to fall The Fall which which would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make fall Satan had to come through flesh also but Satan would not come through human uh uh uh could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would Christ come in human flesh to restore the Fallen but there was an animal the serpent so close to man that Satan would get uh that beast and through uh and through that Beast he could get to the human flesh and cause the fall and inject himself thereby into the human race even as Jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race into human bodies even to the extent of a resurrection wherein we would have bodies like unto his glorious one thus what God worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan when when Satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God then man could not get to the Tree of Life In The Garden certainly not it wasn't time but an animal animal had caused the fall had it not let animal life be shed was taken and his blood shed then God had communion with man again then there was to come a day when God would appear in flesh and by means of his humiliation he would restore the Fallen man and make him partaker of that eternal life once you see this you can understand the serpent seed and know that it was no apple Eve ate no it was degradation of humanity by intermingling the seed now I know in answering one question another one is apt to come up and people ask if Eve fell that way what did Adam do God lays the blame on Adam that is simple the word of God forever is is forever settled in heaven before one Speck of Stardust was made that word God's law was exactly as it is written in our Bible now that word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she's an adulteress and is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back that word was true in Eden as it was true when Moses wrote it in the law the word can't change Adam took her back he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway she was part of him he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself he would not let her go so Eve conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race he sold the human race into sin that he might have Eve for he loved her amen now do you see that Adam could not fall but God worked it in his plan God could not create sin God's not the author of sin but God knew in his mind he knew the beginning from the end and God knew exactly what was going to bring about glory to himself and so uh uh so so how many understands that see you see that it's the beautiful part of redemption Adam had to go after his wife and so did Christ come after you and me bringing us back what is called now it's not a literal seed but it's a predestinated seed that he put in every one of our hearts to come to himall amen amen praise the Lord all right so so we so we we can we we can see that um here tonight in in our in our reading that that that election election that that beautiful purpose of God living in us now so here we are what what makes what brings about complexes so much in us as the elect because this guy has has that that seed of life within him he has that seed of life life within him but he's born he's born sexually and so even you can have the Holy Ghost and and and yet the the the uh uh have that Waring on the inside as we as we talked with last week and and I think that's all we're going to read on the church age book for tonight we'll just we we we'll we'll start on the uh other one the next time um but let me just read a a quote to you brother Bram says now the gene and he's talking about a boy that's been born in a into a complex because he's got mother uh which I believe was German and and and had the father was Irish I believe um it is and and he says the the boy in his natural was was born with a complex coming from his genetics and and and and brother brandom is telling the son or you know he's telling the father father or the father's telling him well he's he's come he's given his heart to the Lord he's been baptized we've raised him right and and because he done a girl wrong and he won't apologize about it and so when brother bradam goes and talks talks to the to the man about it he says well I don't I don't understand my my boy's being so arrogant just he says but yet he's he's he's he's come he's he's he's repented accepted Christ he's been baptized and brother brandham says sh but he's got to receive the Holy Ghost he says now the genes and this this is there in in Paradox in in 63 he says now the genes in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted Still Remains the flesh that's been intered into this boy so so so uh uh uh uh uh father and mother can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that doesn't mean that My Three Sons are not going to battle the genetics between Mom and Dad just just because you girls just because uh Michael and Amy uh uh receive the Holy Ghost doesn't mean that you're not going to battle the things that goes down back back down your daddy's uh uh tree uh bloodline and your mama's bloodline and that's the same way also it's the same way between you and your dad and mom you you the only only one there's only one way to to to uh get out of this Mass that's the new birth that's right and so so so we get we get into a complex many times setting in the church good church people good young people and yet sometimes we get to that point we just we just wonder amen what you know what I just and and and it's your genetics you're you're just a you're you're you're just an inbred body of Decay and Christ has come the only way out folks is election but just being being elected is not good enough it's got to be energized you've got to have the Holy Ghost and when that when that when that seed is energized not by not not not pregnated by a sexual uh interaction but pregnated by the Holy Spirit coming down upon that seed Just Like Water and Light upon upon an apple seed to make it to live that's our way out that's our way out now he says uh Still Remains he said uh now the jeans and and mother and father of this boy no matter how much they are converted Still Remains the flesh that's been in her in her breed into this boy therefore the boy's got a complex in him just like his mother's family they're not forgiving they they will not apologize that's where the boy stands and I said to the father no matter how much you've raised him I said now look at you out of your family all of them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth now look at your family and I said now look at your family to the mother there there are a bunch of people they just sat there and won't speak very independent so forth IR irrevelant to religion I I but I said it's not you you're the only one of your sisters and brothers and you are sweet and kind and forgiving what does that your tree part of that family tree yet you have received the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's Christ lives in you this body came from here but when the Holy Ghost it's the logos it's the Life of Christ coming down you are now eating from that tree of life it's eternal life within you you see that it's not this mind over matter will not work against against the tree of knowledge it just ain't going to work but all the life of God can you say Amen you love him so when you get the Holy Ghost now you're sweet and you're tender and you're thinking H my now now there's no more problems no you're still living in that body that came from the Tree of knowledge but that's where you have to bring every thought under the control of that Holy Spirit that's where you have to bring every imagination line it all up come bring it right back and say nope the Holy Spirit lives in here and the same God that took amen the the the junk of the old uh at the beginning and and when the world was without form and void and chaos and amen and when the Holy Spirit moved upon the face of the deep and started bringing about a beautiful creation that's what the holy spirit is doing in you bringing about a creation as the musicians can come but I'm still going to open this up for some more another question if if if there's anyone else that would that would want to um that would have a question amen praise the Lord no questions comments anything from you youngans see man you're 9 years old you have any questions amen amen says I'm I'm I'm I'm nine and I've learned to just sit down and Nod amen praise the Lord see when I was a child I used to think that God is just looking for a way to send me to [Music] hell and I will say that kind of mentality did produce [Music] prayer it did produce agony iing we would agonize in [Music] Pentecost we pray to be ready and be right we but the prayer wasn't a prayer of a son it was a prayer don't let me don't don't don't don't let me go to hell don't let me I don't want to I [Music] don't but what I have found is that I am a [Music] son and the desires that I have in me to serving and to loving can only come from God in Me In This complex being that I am when I can't understand myself why can't you understand yourself is because you're a [Music] mut you're a mut you got all of this from all of these you're just your your your family tree is messed up your mind is muddled you you're a mixture of everything inside of you is an eternal purpose only inside of you when he saw you in your Fallen state he said I'm not going to let you leave you were in my mind you're part of me I want to place before the foundation of the world he placed his seed and says I see him in his Fallen state but he's mine I see her in her Fallen state but she's [Music] mine election is very real but now Satan wants to get us into this he wants to get us into this Frame of Mind [Music] where where we're lukewarm to where numus we're we're we're we're we're in a we're in an age of of of drugs anything to numb your conscience anything to numb what's real we you drink you you you smoke the marijuana to sort of relax you a little bit you you take a certain drug to help you to sort of escape the present and make you to feel different and some people that's the reason why drugs are that's the reason why drugs are so addicting because it makes you feel bigger than you makes you feel like you want to makes you feel bigger than you are makes you anything to [Music] ease and though we don't take drugs and we shouldn't we shouldn't rely on drugs and whe whether they're scripture or whatever I I think every every son and daughter of God needs to do their best to stay away from that nonsense even if the doctor's trying to put you on for I mean I you know if I let the doctor if I let the doctor put me on everything for my my chronic pain listen I'd rather limp a little bit at the end of the day I'd rather and and I want a good mind to be able to to enjoy my family and enjoy one another but I want to tell you Satan's Got Drugs
