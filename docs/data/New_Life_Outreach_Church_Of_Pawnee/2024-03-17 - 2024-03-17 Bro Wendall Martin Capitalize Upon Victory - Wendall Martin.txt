for all the victories that have been won here in 1 Corinthians 15 and 57 but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore amen or for that reason or now because of this my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast everyone say steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as you know your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen I want to minister this morning on capitalizing on Victory amen father we just want to thank you for your love thank you Lord for the songs of victory that have been sung and you coming in our presence Lord to vindicate those songs to our hearts thank you for what you've done for all of us in in last week's camp meeting Lord and we just thank you for the victories that are won Lord we we see the enemy Lord uh fighting with sickness and different things trying to disrupt Lord the faith of your people Lord we know that our heart is centered upon you and you alone we're asking Lord that you would you would just bless us now Lord that you would anoint your word anoint your servant anoint your people father is our prayer in Jesus name we pray in the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated this morning amen so to capitalize Amen to capitalize on it means to gain further advantage of it means to build upon the victory that has been gained and so when we talk about capitalizing amen we're thankful for what God has done amen but we want to keep the victory after the meeting and we want to add to and so I thought we would just uh just speak on this simple thought here this morning amen as as we uh are thinking uh the Lord thanking the lord for what he has done for us in these meetings and I'm sure as we had the testim the other night amen the Lord has been truly truly been good to us we didn't even get to everyone that wanted to testify or that could have testified but the Lord has been good to us amen and and uh so we're but we're not wanting to just uh have uh uh thank God for a meeting ped we're not wanting to just have victories of Amen thank God for the victories but we want to build upon what God has given us in other words we we don't want to just receive something from the Lord only for the devil to take it away from us in 3 months amen we don't want to receive something but we every Victory we got every Victory we get we want to keep that Victory and keep marching on and building upon what God has given us now building isn't going to be easy amen building isn't fast but when the when you're steady with what you doing than God Amen uh then then you will gain ground now Satan has capitalized on our mistakes for uh for for many years he capitalizes on your mistakes he he trips you up and then he when he gets the advantage of you then amen he finds your weaknesses and he just goes to work and he and it's steady steady steady steady and he's gnawing and he's getting and he's knowing and he's and he's not he's not necessarily amen looking for great ground but he knows that if he can just get a little ground at a time amen eventually the little inch of a ground will become amen a a great big acres of land can you say amen and so the Believers got to have that same mentality I am gaining ground every day it might be inch by inch it might be little here little there amen but we must not St still we must not be Idol when we get Victory we have got to capitalize on that Victory I'm not going back and defeat but I'm going to continue on Amen and build upon what God has given us can you say amen amen you got to build upon it amen now I I I know Satan's um uh uh you know Satan's kingdom was greatly Disturbed this last week amen and when you get into when you get into prayer and and God does things for you you disturb the kingdom of Satan amen but when you when you know that Satan is is is uh is Disturbed and he's upset that's not the time to give back or to to to step a foot back but we've got to press onward amen until the the the the total victory has come and we don't we know that the total vict iory will be our body change we know that total Victory is just within our grasp when this Rapture takes place and we are we are winning we are taking advantage we are building until he comes can you say amen amen I I I I I'm thankful for that here this morning now I I as we as we begin to think about these things and I I I've thought about uh a lot of uh going back to the meeting this this this past weekend and how that amen uh I feel like there was a lot of Victories there was victories for you young people amen uh the the Lord helped you in in areas that you've been seeking for the presence of the Lord was there amen and and and we but we're not satisfied with that we got to build our walls and we got to set our gates and we've got to amen change your routines if we have to and amen but we refuse to go back to the rut of defeat and we're going to March onward amen how many's ever heard that he has met his waterl amen you know met is waterl what waterl that was amen if if if you had I believe sat Satan met his waterl this last week amen and you know waterl was actually a village that was U near uh uh where where the British and the the Persians uh defeated Napoleon and and so Napoleon was a greatly uh feared you know General and and he had went through there conquering many many many people matters of fact uh there are uh strategist War strategist that still uh look at and and and and uh really look into his his strategy and and use a lot of his uh you know tactics even today they they say that amen that Napoleon was quite a a warrior and and he just he was just conquering and conquering but finally there took some uh uh some of these Kings and some of these men these countries these armies started standing against him and eventually they started he he begin to lose a war here and he begin to lose here and he begin to lose here until finally I believe it was the the the British amen that got the Persians and they both got together and they finally put an end unto Napoleon amen now the fearful the great Napoleon they they say that there was amen Millions five to eight million that was slaughtered during uh these wars that Napoleon was bringing against he was just a brutal man amen but and and and there was great fear against about Napoleon but you see it it took a country to begin to defeat and say he can be he can be destroyed he can be stop he can be until there in Waterloo there's where Napoleon met as waterl he was he was never to rise again amen he he was never able to to get his army back together well can you say Amen so I say today when Satan comes in and he fights and he fights and he fights and it just seems like amen there's you know there's no winning there's no way that we can defeat I want to tell you Satan is defeatable Satan is defeatable amen and we get victories here and we get victories there and we get victories here and what is it doing it builds our courage that if we stand against this enemy we can defeat him we can defeating well praise the Lord amen we're not we're not just we're we're thankful for these camp meetings we're thankful for prayer meetings but there's coming a time brother where we are going to defeat the uh uh the the final enemy which is death amen where Satan will no longer Reign Satan will have no Authority amen the powers and the kingdoms of this Earth will give way to the son of righteousness well can you say Amen and it's dependent upon you standing your ground and take advantage of every little victory that you win take advantage of everything that God gives you don't take it for granted well praise the Lord amen I tell you what amen we've got to rebuild we can stand there we can we can fight the enemy Amen brother as as we read this quote last uh uh Wednesday night Amen brother bradam says and we know that this is the day and this is right before he passed away 12565 he says this is the day of salvation where God is calling men from the world from a life of sin to a life so it's not just calling us from sin he's not just bringing Victory but he's calling you and me to a life of service in other words we can't just sit back and let God uh uh and and depend on God to defeat the Devil for us amen we've got to realize that he's got to use bodies he's got to use vessels he's got to use boys and girls men and women there is there is a service that we must do the devil will not be defeated except by human beings amen you you see Satan come against the the human being he come against Adam and Eve Adam was given the authority over the Earth Satan came directly to deal with Adam and Eve because he was trying to take the possession of the earth well we know that he wanton we know they defeated him but you see through the new birth and through the power of the blood God's called you and me not just to stand back and ask him for victory but we have been given Victory so that we can defeat the enemy any place any time under any condition he's calling you and me can you say amen Amen brother brand would go on and say I'm thankful for the doors that are open I'm thankful that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord you see Satan hates the spirit of God and so he comes to try to stop the vessels in which the spirit of God dwells in amen now I I I want you to understand that amen brother Timothy you know he he how many enjoyed brother Timothy's preaching this last week amen but the devil fought him and amen he got he just got so sick couldn't even make it to their Wednesday night service amen why Satan trying to stop the vessel in which the victory comes amen you you don't you don't think that brother uh uh brother Andrew Clover isn't fought when he stands up there Wheeling that sword against the enemy so that you can be free amen Satan hates the vessels amen that the that the spirit of God is flowing through and he's going to fight he's going to fight but these men have to stand up and say no you're not taking ground from me I'm anointed to bring Victory and I want to say today amen that God's raising up you men and women that are standing up today and say no you're not taking Victory from me I am possessing everything that God says for me to possess can you say amen amen there in 2 Timothy 2 and3 it says Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ somebody say endure hardness amen that means the enemy is going to fight you that means the enemy is going to keep on nagging at you but if God's giving you the victory then stand your ground and don't you let the devil come back and take one inch from you amen he says no man that in that Warth entangleth themselves with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who had chosen him to be a soldier can you say Amen you're going to be withstood in every direction that you turn just because God's given you the land amen reminds me of Israel when they're in nehemiah's day when they returned from captivity now they had been in captivity for many many years I believe amen 70 years and so they were given favor by God Amen and and and and was actually amen given the authority to go back to Jerusalem but what happened was when Nehemiah come down and looked at the people he found that the people were living amen and the people of Judah were living in a city without walls without Gates they were poor they had nothing they were living like ppers when God had restored them back oh come on church amen yes they were Jews but you see the city of God was in vain was in Ruins amen there they were popers living in dilapidated homes living without victory yes they were back at home but they were in amen a chaos amen no walls for protection the enemy was living among the rubble the Bible says and you see Satan was sitting there enjoying every bit of it now the sad thing is is Israel begin to accept that as the way of life Israel says at least we're not under the dictates of Babylon anymore amen now they're living in the rubble their homes were in shambles amen are y'all hearing me you see they received Victory but they were not capitalizing on that Victory they just become complacent why because I'm going to tell you to go back and start rebuilding to stand up and rebuilding what God's G Hallelujah I'm thankful for what God done for me in that prayer line I'm thankful for what God done Amen in those services but brother I am going to capitalize on the victory and I'm going to build what God has called me to be well God delivered me from pornography you say well God's delivered me from Habits God's delivered that's wonderful amen now you can fulfill your purpose your purpose on Earth was not to be delivered from pornography your purpose on Earth was not to be delivered from Habits or not to be amen your purpose on Earth was to rule and reign in Christ Christ Jesus amen come on Church you pray and your prayers are answered to have a faith amen and bring about the supernatural presence of God that is what you're called for amen so many times we think amen we're just amen we're satisfied with just deliverance and we're satisfied amen for God coming down and touching us in a service amen oh my goodness that's not your purpose amen God sends a preacher your way and God sends the War of the Holy Spirit to break the yolks and the chains off of you so that you can fulfill your purpose we've got to capitalize on the victories that God gives us can you say Amen now Israel just accepted God given me Victory and now they're living in Jerusalem amen they're poor the city of God is in Ruins amen amen now amen they just accept it as the way of life and resign themselves to just deal with what they had and the sad thing is they become satisfied that's right all right satisfied I'm going to tell you something you can't you you can't become satisfied because Satan ain't satisfied until he's got you killed that's right Satan's not satisfied until he's got you totally destroyed come on church you've got to build those walls now now here the people of God were they were living in the ashes of God's City yes they were delivered from bondage but Judah I I I I'm going to stress it to you Judah was satisfied living in the rubble amen if only those broken walls could talk I thought many of times if those Broken Walls that had been broken down if they could only talk of the victories that had been that had taken place and amen the enemies that those walls had held out in the past and amen if those broken down walls could talk oh my just victory after Victory after victory that God had brought in the past come on church amen but in this last day God sent us a amen a prophet in the day to raise up those Hallelujah this is not a god of yesterday we're not serving a god of yesterday we don't belong in the ashes and the rebel of Christianity we are to rise under the power and the anointing of the Holy Ghost and we are to cast out devils and we are to heal the sick and we are to raise the Dead the power of God is to be in this church and I will not be satisfied until every one of us arising in the power and the anointing of the Holy Ghost that's why God Set Me Free that's why God came in the camp meeting that's why God deals is to anoint you to defeat that enemy that's right amen now with Broken Walls comes intimidation with Broken Walls you are intimidated by the enemy all around you've got your Victory but you have no protection so now man it's just a matter of time you're having a hide because you know that the enemy can come in and take you right back captive that's right amen can you say Amen the Bible says that they were mocked by the moabs the moabites they were mocked by the ammonites they were mocked by the Arabians these guys were mocking them and when Nehemiah came in man Nehemiah was upset Nehemiah says God's given you Victory and you're living here in the rubble is this what God's called you to do are you satisfied with this what can you say man and the people answered them back him back we're poor we have nothing to build with we have nothing we have we have nothing no Scholars we have no tools we have nothing and the Bible says that Nehemiah rallied the people around the cause and he be to express to the people people do you realize who you are do you realize who's God who who God called you to be yeah come on do you realize that you're the favored ones over the all of the earth that God's hand has called Abraham and separated you to himself do you realize that even in the impossible abilities the anointing is upon you to build those walls oh come on church amen and as he begin to express to them amen and they begin to reply we are as prey and amen and and and and they're going back and forth but but but but you see it was Nehemiah that stood there and pointed to his commission from the King he he brought out the letter amen and he says I've been given a commission from the the king that you are to build those walls I've got a letter from the King giving you authority to set those Gates I've been given you amen I've been given a commission to declare unto you that you have a right not to just survive but you have a right to build that City and to protect yours well praise the Lord I just want to say it was our Nehemiah in this day that is still screaming out today you've got a right to build that's right can you say Amen now the king willingly granted the request and amen we know the story and I'm not going to stay on it long amen but when the people found that the King was behind the Endeavor that it was just not an idea that Nehemiah had concocted youen but the king had authorized him to build the city the Bible says they begin to strengthen their hands and I want us to look here today and in as as we see man the enemy you say well a lot of people sick somebody brought sickness to the campgrounds this last week and I I just want to tell you this has nothing to do with somebody bringing sickness to the campgrounds this is a a devil that is fighting you amen and trying to keep you from progressing on in the victory Of God come on church this is an enemy and and and and the scripture says that there was a a man by the name of sand balot and there was another man by the name of tayah that despised Israel and when Israel begin to build the ground or begin to build the walls they they as they begin to take courage and they begin to build and and and to rebuild the Bible says that sand ballot and toah were right there on them amen and just constantly amen there in Nehemiah the 2 chapter in the 19th verse it says but when sand balot The Hornet and the and tayah the the servant the ammonite and gam the Arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn despised us and said what is this thing that you do will you rebel against the king then answered I unto them and said unto them the god of Heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants what will rise and build you see oh glory to God I hate that devil that says oh you well what you got at Camp was just fine what you got that that was good but but but you see amen but you're still not worthy you're still not amen I want that sand ballot to be killed once and for all today I want you to pick up your trial and get to building the walls I'm worthy of everything God says I'm worthy of I'm anointed for everything that God promised to this church has been promise and God will fulfill it in me I don't have the ability I don't have the wherewith but the anointing of the king is upon me he's given me an open book and he said you can possess every promise of God right can you say amen amen oh yes you see when Israel begin to align themselves with the words of Nehemiah amen the enemy started coming in and they laughed and they despised and they said this is silly what are you going to accomplish how are you going but you know what begin to take place after a while amen the rubble begin to turn into a a little wall all around the city and before you know it and did you know what what the way they done it was amen every every uh family amen that was around that wall amen they were they were to take the portion of the wall in front of them and they were to build that portion of the wall so this family if the Martin family was right here amen the Martin family would start taking the stones amen and and replacing the stones rebuilding the wall amen let's just say Amen the torran family over here and the torrent family amen they took their section of the wall and they begin to build up and and then maybe the Applegate family and all around until the wall of the city begin to come up it was a slow process and the enemy it wasn't just wasn't too concerned at the beginning but as the wall begin to come up as the wall begin to rise and they seen the victory in the eyes of the Israelites well glory to God when their eyes begin to say I can win I can have a wall I can have my own City that's when the enemy says whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa are you hearing me stone upon Stone brother Wendell I'm just not Stone upon Stone just pick up the stone amen put it on the wall but brother Wendell I I I I I I've got a long ways to go pick up that stone and put it on the wall amen it's because we're wanting some big Supernatural thing and because we're wanting to be grown up immediately right that we let the little things keep us out that's right you got to build the wall somebody say I'm going to build the wall build the wall Stone by stone stone by Stone that means you're going to find out how the enemy took you out in the beginning and how the enemy has been amen and what tore down the wall in the first place you're going to find out come on preached on phones and and and the internet and that kind of stuff here a while back if that took you out at the beginning then tear that thing out put a wall in its place Stone by Stone I'm going to get rid of things that is keeping the enemy amen that has allowed the enemy to have an influx of my life God can Del listen you can be delivered from pornography today amen and two months later be back addicted harder harder than you've ever been before why because you didn't build a wall that's right you you didn't stand up against the enemy yes it was a true Victory but your victory was shortlived we're not wanting shortlived victories we're wanting the victory that I got today to be a part of me forever and well praise the Lord I'm going to build my wall amen that's true praise the Lord those kinds of things that'll that'll take you out amen they're laying the scripture says that the enemy was hiding in the rubble of the wall the enemy they were in their own land but the enemy was hiding in well praise the Lord amen I I I don't want Victory today and then the next amen and going man I ain't missing a I ain't missing a service for for for three weeks and I'm so proud of myself and so is everybody else all proud of me and then hallelujah amen then I he I well I well I just can't make

what what what what what have you been yes God did touch you but is it a short live touch true or are you going to abide in the place that God has purposed in his heart for you to live in it wasn't the will of God for them to be in Babylon in the first place sin took him there so coming back and just being satisfied oh at least I'm not under the Babylonian rule you weren't supposed to be there in the first place you're supposed to be prospering in the land that God gave you you're supposed to be prospering in Victory you're supposed to be killing Devils you're supposed to be victorious you're not supposed to be just say woo I'm out of his grassp you are to be ruling and reigning that's true hope I'm making sense this morning yeah amen s bot amen they had literally terrorized the people of God they could come in and Destroy they did they had come in and they reigned over the People by fear man Even though sand ballot and his crew did not even have a rightful possession to the land but when a man come with the commission of the king their Hearts were vexed and angry why because things were fixing to change all right well glory to God I said glory to God things were fixing to change I'm not going to be the man I I you I'm not going I'm not I'm not doing this little I I am not a hamster on the Little Wheel I that that's just running with everything I'm doing and thinking I'm getting something a I am not a hamster I am the head of this house I am the ruler I am the head and not the tail I may be a 16-year-old kid but I'm going to rule and rain I'm going to defeat I'm going to take my Mountain I'm going to possess come on church I'm going I I might be you know a 100 year old man but I am a possessor oh how many possessors do we have in the building come on church amen thank God for victory now I'm going to capitalize on that Victory amen yes now who can stop the king's decree now the enemy said will you will you rebel against the king and they said we have been commissioned by the king I I like this Deuteronomy 7 and6 that already said Thou Art an holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God had chosen the to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers half f Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondsman from the hand of the king of the Pharaoh the king of Egypt what can you say Amen you never were saved because you you had it all put together you were saved because God loves you now you've got to get that in your bosom you've got to get that in your heart saying I refuse to go back to being a bonder servant to the enemy again amen amen Nehemiah 411 and our adversary said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst of among them and slay them and cause the work to cease and it came to pass when the Jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us 10 times from all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you you therefore set I places behind the wall and on the higher places I even set the people after their families with their swords their Spears and their bows amen hallelujah what's that 14th verse amen and I looked and Rose up and and said unto the Nobles to the rulers to the rest of the people be ye not afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons your daughters your wives and your houses and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and God had brought forth uh had brought uh uh brought their counsel to not that we returned all of us to the wall every one of us and to his work and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of the my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the Spears the Shields and the bowls and the harbans and the rulers were behind all of the house of Judah and they which build it on the wall they that bear burdens with those that that laided everyone with uh everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other held a weapon in other words he had a trial in one hand put in the mud on the brick amen and he had a sword in the other hand ready to fight what I'm trying to tell you buddy is if you're in the Lord's work you're going to have to fight the enemy can you say Amen calling young men from a life of sin and selfishness unto a life of service unto the king can you say amen amen the 18th verse for the builders everyone had a sword gted by his side and so build it he that sounded the trumpet was by me I was uh uh I said unto the Nobles to the rulers to the rest of the people work the work is great and large we are separated upon the one one far from another in what place therefore ye hear the sound of a trumpet Resort ye thither unto us our God shall fight for us someone say hallelujah so we labored in the work and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the star appeared likewise at the same time I said unto the people let everyone with his servant Lodge within within uh Jerusalem that in the night they may uh be a guard to us and labor in the day can I hear a great big amen Amen brother brandham says I I think we ought to stop here and deal with the thought amen that God's people have always been and always will be persecuted you know the Genesis in the is the book of beginnings what you what you find started there will carry right on through the Revelation and and never change amen there we see Cain persecuted and killed Abel because the latter pleased God then we see a perfect picture in Abraham son of the flesh ish who teased and fought the son of Promise Isaac there was uh Esau who hated Jacob and would have killed him if God had not intervene in the New Testament we find Judas betraying Jesus while the religious hoarders of the first century attempted to to destroy the early Believers the children of this world controlled by the devil hate the children of God who are controlled by the spirit no matter how just and upright a Christian is before the public how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues prophecy healing Miracles and he will be condemned the the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God and because it cannot somebody say it cannot overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth veils amen persecutions and trials are a natural normal part of Christian Life there is only one thing you can do about them commit them to God judge not leave their outworkings and final judgment to him can I hear an amen as we stand against this enemy we've got to know man he's lurking and I I I if you don't hear anything else of my talk here today get the walls built don't go back to yesterday what God's done in your ground on how many feels like you went further in your walk with God yes sir amen don't you let him take you back that's go back don't don't be going back to where amen it's just all the Hun you know the easy

brother what I mean to tell you if you don't believe in getting angry then let your righteous indignation rise up somebody say I'm going to get angry at the Devil Hallelujah I'm going to get angry at the Devil I am saying you're not having a part of my mind you're not having a part of my spirit you're not having a part of my family you're not having a part of anything I am of the Jean seed of God hallelujah amen the Martin seed amen it all it is brought amen from generation from me all the way to to my boys is a is just a bunch of Amen uh uh uh complexes and a bunch of Amen uh sins and a bunch of things that's all the Martin lineage can give any of you that might be proud of your lineage amen it's time for you to quit Defending Your lineage because your lineage is rotten amen your lineage will go to hell amen except the Eternal Gene seed of God is living on the inside of you giving you a brand new birth you are a son of God Amen millions and millions and millions of years before there

you say Amen it don't matter what my genetics are of the past it don't matter what my genetics are for my daddy or great granddaddy I have have nothing that I can brag about in this Martin Gene I've only got one gene I can brag on and that's that God gene on the inside of my soul amen commission today to stand against that enemy come on now amen I'm not here to defend a church or denomination or I'm not here to defend the message of the Prophet I'm not here to defend the Martin or I'm not here to defend amen anything I'm here to defend the word of God Amen that word is what that word will vindicate itself in you can you say amen amen hallelujah you think Satan wants you you think Satan you think Satan's going to let it go easy remember the reason why you throw down your trial is because you're wanting something big Hallelujah I I I used to love am man good thing about being an electrician is I'm not stuck on the same job amen I I I'm not going to the same Factory every day amen I'm not going to the amen now some people love that that me I I got I got just enough of that whatever that those dhdd or whatever that is in me that I just I my mind just Hallelujah I don't know what whatever you call that amen and uh and and and I I love going to a project and having it done in a week or two weeks or a Max a month I want to get in and get out I want to be able to turn around and say ha I done that amen I I I I but you see amen when you're dealing with the devil you can't have that kind of a mentality it's brick upon brick it's prayer upon prayer and lots of times you're not seeing a whole lot of Amen a a difference lots of times your prayer maybe maybe you're feeling like you're not getting much accomplished or your Bible study and reading that Bible every day and that dedication at night before you go to prayer or before you go to bed and getting the family together and doing those things you might feel like it's not getting much but you're adding blocks you're adding to the wall I promise you you're adding you're adding you're taking dedication you're taking this thing seriously oh come on church amen we don't need Amen to preach on messages of Deliverance if we would just build our stinking wall amen so that the powers of hell would stay out of our homes stay out of our Lives stay out of our marriages can you say Amen Build That Wall somebody say Build That Wall get that wall built man then you can stand there and sayi commissioned by God Satan you're a liar Amen brother Brandon want recognizing your day and its message he said you know why Satan didn't want me to preach he's he's talking about how he just tried all week and couldn't get a message even even the day before he says you know I I see why Satan didn't want me to do this yesterday I felt so bad I couldn't get no word from the Lord I did everything I know how to do this morning when I got up I'd eat some corn yesterday and seemed like laying right there on my stomach I was so sick I just couldn't hardly get up and I thought what's the world's the matter I'm going down there and don't know what I'm going to say Lord I can't even get a scripture in my mind to write down I can't find a thing you think that you think that you're the only one that gets fought the prophet was getting fought right before he goes up to preach Hallelujah he said I just didn't know what to do then after the message began to come to me Satan kept saying you feel too bad your head's hurting you're sick you can't go down there you you can't stand there it's going to be this it's going to be that and I remember one time a story of a little Cockney in in England he was just an ordinary man and they said that the king one of the kings in the early days was was going to his Palace was going into his Palace and and he had no one he had a message that had to get forth an Urgent Message because of the enemy and so he said to this little fell standing there he said here take this message take this message hurry to a certain certain place and command this to be done and he said take my scepter in your hand that'll vindicate you amen that you're sent from me and he stuck it under his robe and away he went and the guards everywhere stopping and everybody else yelling amen but he says give way I have a message of the king I'm the king's messenger a Vindicated word and I thought Satan get out of my way I have the king's message I must go one time they killed the Prince of Peace and put him in the grave and sealed up the tomb and death held him for three days and nights but on Easter morning he had the scepter in his hand and he hollered get away death get away grave open up I am the king's message I must come forth to prove this Resurrection I'm the resurrection and life Hallelujah I feel good I feel real good now it's the king's message let's recognize it friend we've got we're called to gather together for the sounding of the trumpet for the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more I say today let's fight if we've got to fight let's run if we got to run do what you got to do but we've got to win we've got to win build that war oh let oh come on Church you're anointed for this you're anointed to set the captives free you're anointed for the P You're anointed for the Rapture hallelujah amen amen bless the Lord you love him amen it's God now as I close there's the story brother brandom is is talking about doing our part and that we want God to do everything this is in this is in making the valley full of ditches and he's and he's talking about how that God says you remember how that he man God had told him to dig those ditches amen for you're not going to have to fight in this battle God's going to supernaturally fight but you've got to dig the ditches all right and tomorrow morning there's going to be there's going to be water in those ditches and brother brandham was saying now he said you're going to have to dig deep you're going to have to dig deep there's going to be things in your way as you're digging that you're going to have to get out of that ground he says if there comes a rock get the rock out of that ground amen if it's music get the music out of the ground whatever you've got dig those ditches if it's your phone if it's your internet if it's your friends if it's whatever it is that is in the way of you digging those ditches and preparing for God to do what he's promised to do in this day he says whatever is in your way dig your ditches come on Amen it's a good message to go back and listen to dig those ditches you see we want things but we but but when Satan throw throws these things up he throws these things up before you know it he gets your he gets your spirit on on on aured other directions and before you know it it shows your your your your your shovels laying on the ground and you're out you're out following other Whimsical things and ideas you've got to come right back and say no I'm going to fulfill God's purpose in my life I've got to fulfill come on now I've got to fulfill I know this is so simple here this morning but I've got to fulfill I'm saying let's capitalize on what God done last week last month whatever God has been doing in your life capitalize on that don't go back man now keep digging you've got something that you've got to do I'm going to start praying I'm going to start that dedication don't wait for the next week do it now don't do it like you do your amen your exercise routine start it for a week and then go back amen you can do whatever you want to with your dieting and everything else but don't you go back when it comes to thus sayith the Lord stick with it can you say Amen brother brandom says well or he says brother brandom I don't do nothing well maybe that's what's the matter that's the trouble of it it's more sin not to do than it is to do when you know better I know I should be praying I know I should be dedicating I know I should be reading my Bible every day because all Christians read the read and pray every day it's more sin not to do than it is to do when you know better that's right he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him at is sin you got to make ready doing nothing is worst thing you can do do nothing about it you Southerners remember your history went up here when Grant was sitting just across the river and he had a boy out there on guard Duty and the rebels across the river and this boy walking along there kind of Dazed around with the dreams of his sweetheart he had left his post of Duty and went down to pick some violets to send to his sweetheart he didn't mean to do wrong he went then at that time there was a spy that was ready from the southern Army and they slipped in and they looked around they found out that the southern Army was two or three times the size of General GRS well what happened they the the boy come back on the post of Duty was not knowing what had happened but the Spy had already been there and what happened they stormed across the river drove them Plumb back up into the state and the boy was shot an hour later not because they didn't have no objection to him picking the violets they didn't it wasn't what he done it was the things he did not do he didn't stand to his post of Duty he didn't guard the post like he was supposed to and he spoiled the whole thing the responsibility lays at the Life Tabernacle and the other Tabernacles and churches in shreport Louisiana here God is here taking with a storm it ain't what you're doing than it is what you're failing to do let's do something about it let's dig with all of our hearts that when the day of judgment comes we can say God I did the very best I could and you know I did amen when we know what we can do then that's all that's expected it's not what I'm doing necessarily that's wrong maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe there's maybe there's that internet maybe there's no sin going on but it's the thing that I'm failing to do it's the convictions of my heart or it's the things of God's word that I am not making it my priority and conviction his post of standing guard was important but he did not take make it important the general specifically put him there to watch and to guard he did not take the General's conviction seriously come on Church the Holy Spirit can con
