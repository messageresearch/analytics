after the uh service there and so we say God bless you to to all of you who who labored there Amen on that praise the lord well let's look here in the book of uh Ephesians and um amen or actually the the first scripture here let's let's read uh Psalms 105 and the first verse praise the Lord amen God is so good to me amen well this is the this is the uh Sunday before Thanksgiving and um so um we usually uh take this day for um for Thanksgiving and so I I would just uh we're just going to title our service here this morning Thanksgiving 2023 amen and uh um that'll be an easy service to remember amen and so um uh we uh always look forward to these special occasions and and so uh Psalms 105 and 1 oh give thanks unto the Lord matter of fact won't you read it with me oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people let's sing the other one sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk ye of all his wonderous Works let's do the third verse Glory ye in His holy name let the heart of them Rejoice that seek the Lord the other one seek the Lord and his strength seek his face forever more one more remember His Marvelous works that he he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth well isn't God wonderful Hallelujah I'd also like to read on down to the 42nd verse and but he remembered his holy promise and Abraham his servant and he brought forth his people with joy his chosen with gladness and gave them the lands of the Heathen and they inherited the LA of the people that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws and everyone say it together praise ye the Lord let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you today for your blessings thank you Lord for all that you have done for us and I'm asking Lord that you would just be honored as we begin to think of of of your goodness and and what you have done for us Lord Lord I pray Lord that you would be in everything that we say that we would speak only as you would have us to speak Lord I pray Lord that you would be with all of your faithful folks here Lord who have been faithful to to come out and to give you glory and honor we love you Lord but we want your blessings upon this service lord it's nothing without you now Lord we just ask that you would have preeminence in Jesus name we pray pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here amen this morning um we um this may be just a little bit of a different service that as as far as um I think sometimes it's good to to to just look back on on how blessed we are as a people as a nation and um uh I I am I I think we should uh um that God raised this nation up uh for a specific purpose amen and so um uh we are as we look here amen uh our our nation I as we can look back at the founding of our nation God was behind this nation and and blessed this nation and our forefathers as as the um as as they fought and as we came for the principles of freedom and and and it is a lot like uh as we just read here amen um it's it's a lot like Israel Israel was brought out of out of Egypt they wanted a place of their own amen and and the supernatural was ever present as as God brought them out even all the way back to Abraham giving him a promise that he his out of his Lo would come uh amen the deliverer and there would be a uh a great nation that would be uh birthed and that there would be the nations of the earth that would be blessed because of Israel and and so amen and there was nothing that there was nothing that um uh Satan could do or or anyone else could do that would ever be able to destroy that Nation except amen the people themselves so Israel would be the only one that would that that could ever allow themselves to be taken in uh captivity and it would be when they started denying the word of God and and walking away from God then amen the blessings of God was no longer on them but the purpose of God was with Israel and the purpose of God Israel still has a Divine Purpose even today and so they as we just remember or or as we just read this scripture here and in Psalms 105 and 42 for he remembered his holy promise and Abraham his servant and he gave them the lands of the Heathen and they inherited the labor of the people that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws and then he said praise ye the Lord amen so so it is remember amen and he and he told him there in Exodus there in Exodus 13 and3 and if you want to put it up amen it just comes to my mind and Moses said unto the people remember this day in which you come out from Egypt out of the house of bondage for by the strength of hand the Lord brought you out from the place this place and there shall be no living bread uh be eaten so so it was a time that was to be told to their sons and and for Generation after generation because it was the blessing of the Lord that was upon the people amen now it would be it would be something that would be expressed for all of their Generations Thanksgiving to God for what God done to them God chose them and and established them a holy nation unto himself amen so when you would look there at Psalms 50 and4 it would say offer unto God Thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high why are we giving thanks why are we paying our vows why should we pay our vows because it was God who chose us ordained us established us and our heart is to be a Heart of Thanksgiving and say God I owe you everything that I am I owe you everything I am can you say amen amen but he didn't stop there when he said Pay thou vows unto the most high and it says and call upon me in the day of trouble and I will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me amen Psalms 98 And1 oh sing unto the Lord a new song for he hath done marvelous things now remember remember he's chose you you are a peculiar people is that right amen before we go there let's just uh let's just run to uh 1 Peter 2 and 29 amen or 2 and N I'm sorry amen 1 Peter 2 and N I want you to understand where I'm going to here this morning you are a CH chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a pecular people that you should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light amen God has established you God has called you I have ordained you and therefore Praises belong unto me oh how there should be a Heart of Thanksgiving in the house here this morning how's there should be a love and a joy and a praise in our hearts because God has been good unto us amen now back to uh uh back to Psalms 98 and 1 oh sing unto the Lord a new song for he hath done marvelous things his right hand and His holy arm hath gotten him the victory the Lord hath made known his salvation his righteousness hath he o openly showed in the sight of the Heathen he remembered his Mercy his truth toward the house of Israel all the ends of the Earth shall see the salvation of our God or hath seen the salvation of our God make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all the Earth make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise amen oh I think Thanksgiving is a wonderful thing now brother bradam would would give us a little uh he would talk there in um from the beginning it was not so he says now tomorrow is Thanksgiving it's a day that is set aside where our Pilgrim forefathers set that day aside to give thanks to the Lord for what he had done for for what we had and what he had done for us for blessing them giving them crops and so forth forth it was one real American day amen he says all the other days like St Patricks and so forth that comes from across the seas but this is an American holiday Thanksgiving tonight I want to say that there's so many things I'm thankful for I don't know how to thank God for the so many blessings another place he would say if you don't have church service then then at home get the family together set down take God's word and read it tell your children about it tell them that this nation was built upon such as that our forefathers who fought to bring this freedom to us left the other country so that we could have freedom of worship freedom of speech freedom of press and so forth we're thankful yet for it we don't know how long that it'll be that way but I say long may our lands be bright with Freedom's whole Holy Light protect us by thy great thy might great God our King can you say Amen so I I think I I I we know we we know that the world is doomed we know that we're headed for the tri or the world is headed for the tribulation we we can see it all around us a America amen is under the Judgment of God but brother we ought to be thankful that we can still come here this morning and have church we ought to be thankful that we can still get up and preach our convictions amen without having to hide somewhere we ought to be thankful that we can still meet in a building like this and a beautiful building that God has blessed us with amen instead of a a dingy dungeon somewhere amen where we're having to hide from the government brother I I want to say it's the blessings of God that is upon this bride it is the blessings of God that is upon you children that you all are able to come here learn to play and sing and preach and amen learn to learn to do these kinds of things it's not always been the case matters of fact our forefathers when they come to America they came because they were under persecution they were under amen persecution they didn't have the freedom of religion amen they they were they were they were uh the the land the government was putting their thumb upon the people and they had to believe a certain way they had to they had to take orders and could only preach certain way but God always gives a light God always gives a help why because God's got a people that'll never be defeated amen and God brought them over to this land and God supernaturally blessed them here in America amen that's exactly right the Puritans and the separatist they they wanted to express themselves to God Amen their Liberties had been taken away and they had become so taxed John Wesley's Revival fires had amen was was dying out and and sin was creeping in the church and the National Church of England had had silenced all others amen they had rejected the move of God and now they had come to a place to where amen they were they they they they they were trying to silence everything amen and the National Church had taken over amen and so uh uh uh they they had originally left to Holland went to Holland and amen this is our forefathers now this is how this is how we coming about here in America amen but they found so much uh immorality and in the schools and the government and even the churches there was there was just so much sin and perversions and the pilgrims wanted a place that they could raise their children in Freedom right now kids you might not understand the freedoms that we have you you might not understand how blessed you are amen did you realize that that that uh being homeschooled is a blessing do you realize that there are people that want to take the freedom of being homeschooled away to make you go to a to a government educated Place Hallelujah you know why because they don't have their hands on youen they're teaching all kinds of perversions out there in those schools today they're they're listen they're teaching little boys that they can be little girls they're teaching little girls that you can have a choice and you can be a little boy if you want to I mean they're messed up and and they know it's not true they know it's not true but they want to try to twist your mind right amen amen do you realize that in China that you can't preach like this in China you've got to preach what the government tells you to preach amen and their Bible is not our Bible oh they'll let you have a Bible amen but where it says to worship God it is it is saying to something to the effect worshiping Chi or what whatever his name is amen the government it it is it is and that's the truth that's the truth go search it out amen they they the government is almighty God to them amen we have message folks who have been arrested amen how many of you kids know who Donnie Reagan is hallelujah Tim PR those are some of the big names right amen there's been others over there too but did you know that those guys had to flee the country amen that actually uh uh the part of their company got got uh arrested got arrested for over there preaching Hallelujah and one of the brothers that was arrested over there for preaching the gospel now now they weren't preaching out the public they they were they had to go somewhere secret to go over there and hide and and and and and when they go to church it'll take 12 to 13 hours for everyone to show up because and they say there's a little room about the size of the of the nursery back there and and and and people will amen one neighbor will come in at maybe at 5:00 in the morning and then two others will come in at 6 and and before you know what are they doing they're trying to slowly sneak in to where no one sees a big Gathering coming amen and finally about midnight that night they can all get together and they have a church they can't sit down hallelujah amen they they say that there's no room to sit down these people are are are are are are person to person Hallelujah they are stacked up now I've been told this I've never been there here let let me have you guys for a minute amen I mean we are we we are we are like this we are like this we are like this we are like this hallelujah amen we we and and and everyone's all crumped in there together and there are people amen and so somebody had find out amen somehow or another they got suspicious went in there and and and arrested a bunch of the people amen and and whatever preachers were in there well I went in and so uh uh uh Donnie Reagan was on his way but they called and said listen amen you need to you need to turn around and and and and get out this and and so uh uh but one of our American Brothers I believe it's either American or Canadian Brothers amen he had the list of the Saints and the places that they were supposed to be going he's got the paper right here he's got it on him he's been arrested so when they go and put him in a man in in a room you know what he does he eats it he tears it up amen because he don't want to poop it and and it come out Hallelujah so he rips it up and he's eating these things and they cannot go and find you see what it is amen it is a blessing to be an American it's a blessing to be able to have freedoms now the world wants to take that freedom away from us and I promise you this one thing here if they could get to the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ they will do what they can to get to you they will do what they can you know why because they can't educate you they can't get you to turn around they why because the blessings of God is upon you Hallelujah you're a chosen generation can you say amen amen so the pilgrims landed on on the Plymouth Rock Massachusetts there in there in 1620 amen and fleeing England's persecution and amen and many had left Holland and and and and so they're pursuing this dream of freedom and and and on that on that Pilgrim uh on that uh those that had that had came across the the the the great sea there amen the waters they they started out with many passengers and a and and and but there was a many tribulation and trials and one of the two chips had sprung leak several times and and and they ended up turning back and taking all amen the the supplies and the passengers on the Mayflower amen and there was only 102 pilgrims left to come over amen now they say there was hardly room and there were many hardships and many sick people and and there were just there there was so much of har but they had a desire to come over to this free land so that they

Kohl's Hill amen and I I I I I I thought this was appropriate and so I thought I would read it brother brandom man he says sometimes it means a lot sometimes it cost you something sometimes that anything that doesn't cost you something isn't worth having all great things has to be paid for now are y'all hearing me you kids hearing for us to have this Freedom today is because there's been people who have been willing to fight for us all things great things has to be paid for the reason we're worshiping today the freedom of religion and this Thanksgiving Day this cost the blood of many American millions of them it's worth something and if it's worth something it's worth dying for and this religion that we have this Pentecostal Holy Spirit that's fell on us to bring us bring bring back to us a resurrected Lord Jesus Christ alive after 1900 years it's worth all of our time all of our efforts and everything that we do it's worth All To Us thou the stream of all thy Comforts said Fanny Crosby more than life to me whom have I on Earth beside thee and whom in heaven but thee pass me not oh gentle savior certainly we need back and hold to him amen so the the Indians amen they

end time and there was going to be a message and the messenger in this end time and there had to be a free country that would spread the gospel around the world aren't you glad for America sir man now I think it's wonderful now that was our first Thanksgiving and next am man if you were to go on down now you think of this how the supernatural was with our fora such as Washington amen when when half of the army that he had you know they they didn't have they they didn't have a lot of Weaponry am man when England was coming back after them amen they were coming in they wanted to come back they wanted to take these people back home take them back to England amen and so they uh uh it was they were wanting to uh declare their independence and and when they when they had done it amen they were ill equipped they didn't have the right kind of armor didn't have the right kind of clothes they didn't they didn't they didn't have hardly any kind of Weaponry at all amen and history tells us that at one point amen half the Army uh Washington's Army was barefooted and just wrapping them up in in in in in uh a racks amen as they're marching across the Delaware amen the supplies were gone the enemy was coming in and and and and shooting and did you know that that history tells us that that Washington was a praying man and that Washington would pray and that that one night he prayed all night long and just asking God for his great Powers amen that he that he stood for a worthy cause and and amen they say that that that the enemy had come in and there were several hoes and and there were were soldiers that had witnessed amen bullets hitting him and and and even holes in his coat but yet it didn't penetrate his body that God was fighting God was preserving Washington Hallelujah now come on folks this ain't this ain't this ain't fictional stuff amen I know people want to say the pillar of fire is a fictional thing it's not a fictional thing and neither was the founding of our nation a fictional thing it was God preserving this for this great time Hallelujah because there had to a lamb amen there had to rise that Beast up with the with the civil and ecclesiastical horns there had to be America now we know that that lamb will rise up and start speaking like the Beast and we know like the dragon and we know we are here but I'm here to tell you we rose up on the power of that of that Beast that came up amen out of the ground God done that for you can you sayen now the composers or The Architects of of our constitutions the designers of our constitution amen had a picture in mind and and so this picture amen that they had in mind was a land of Freedom it was it was a land that would be free from tax oppression it would be a land that would be free from religious oppression amen they envisioned the empowerment of the family and under the directive of God and to live to the fullest of god-given dreams and to be able to express all of the potentials that each uh member of the family amen came with amen that's that was that was their design now now I I I want you to really think about this here this morning because a lot of people try to take away uh uh a lot lot lot of people try to tr try to separate us uh you know religion from uh uh uh you know the government and try to say you know but but I want to tell you the the the the Constitution was written by Christian people for us it wasn't it wasn't written it wasn't written for the for the Sinners out there it was written now you can serve God however you wanted to but they were not there amen they were not giving you freedom to kill babies they were not giving you freedom to be transgender they were not giving you freedoms for those kinds of things those are sin they were not giving you freed fre to sin they were given you freedoms to worship God according to the own your own dictates of your own heart in other words you don't have to believe like I believe and I don't have to believe like you believe we've got we had a freedom of religion purist and the separatist were a little were different uh the Quakers you know they they they they were all but the thing is they all come with one agreement praise the Lord so we just let let all the denominations say serve God however you want to serve him we Hallelujah but let me serve God how I want to serve him is that right amen once again sin wants to come in and these that want to pursue sin and make you agree with their position with transgenders make you agree with their position of abortion I Hallelujah all of you belong in jail amen the Constitution was not set up for you to hide behind so that you can butcher children before they come in to an age of puberty the Constitution was not set up for that it was set up for Religious Freedom well glory to God Amen now so amen we got to understand that now you know what were they thinking why why were why was this done what were they opposing what were they fighting for amen I think an American needs to identify with the dream that was in those guys' hearts and Minds at the beginning amen so I started thinking you know I I I just I just want to give you a few proclamations how many believe that'll be all right I told you it's going to be a weird service amen but the first national Thanksgiving Proclamation uh uh the N the first national proclamation of Thanksgiving was in 197 or in 1777 uh given by the Continental uh Congress and it was h a temporary location of York of Pennsylvania amen because the British occupied the national capital in Philadelphia and so Samuel Adams created the first draft of the Proclamation and this is the way it read for as much as it is the in indispensable duty of all men to adore these super intending Providence of almighty God to acknowledge gratitude their obligation to him for benefits received and to implore such further blessings as they stand in need of and it having pleased him in his abundant Mercy not only to continue to us the innumerable bounties of his common Providence Providence but also to smile upon us in the p in the prosecution of a just and necessary War for the defense and establishment of our inalienable rights and Liberties particularly in that that he ha been pleased in so great a measure to prosper the means used for the support of our troops and to Crown our arms with the most signal success it is therefore recommended by to the legislative or executive powers of these United States to set apart Thursday the 18th day of December next for the solemn Thanksgiving and praise that at one time with one voice the good people May Express The Grateful feelings of their hearts and consecrate themselves to the service of their Divine benefactor and that together with their sincere acknowledgements and off and offerings they may join the pen confession of their manifold sins whereby they had fortified uh uh whereby they had fortified every favor and their humble and Earnest supplication that it may please God through through the merits of Jesus Christ mercifully to forgive and blot them out of remembrance that it may please them graciously to afford His blessings on the governments of these United of these states respectively and prosper the public Council of the whole to inspire our commanders both by land and sea and all under them with that wisdom and fortitude that uh uh which may render them fit instruments under the guidance of almighty God to secure for these United States the greatest of all human blessings Independence and peace that it may please him to prosper the trade and manufacturers of the people and the labor of the husbandmen that our land May yield its fre its increase to take schools and seminaries of education so necessary for cultivating the principles of true Liberty virtue and piety under his nurturing hand and to prosper the means of religion for the the promotion of the enlargement of that Kingdom which consists in righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost it is further recommended that survi labor and such Recreation as though at at other times innocent may be Unbecoming the purpose of this appointment be omitted on so solemn an occasion now that was the first national proclamation of Thanksgiving amen hallelujah now our our government our our government was in charge of that Hallelujah now maybe maybe you younger kids might not know much about the government right now but some you older ones do and that's that's quite a that's quite a that's that's that's what God that's why God fought for us can you say Amen now now this is an appreciation for a natural land are you got it now I'm not I I am we are not we're I am not saying God Bless America we're going to see a repentance we're going no that's over we're doomed it's done but I'm sure thankful for the hand of God right now brother John that you can still raise your children in this America according to the freedom oh yeah you get laughed at and you look funny because you ain't got T you're the only ones that ain't got tattoos and green hair and sometimes you guys think that you guys are the look like I mean it's got to the point where you're the Oddball listen you were born pretty they're making themselves ugly all those tattoos green hair purple hair and and and all of this stuff all over the place Hallelujah you're not the freak okay amen you're not the freak just going to put it like that now but God gave us this country God gave us this this this land so that we can worship him so the United States will never receive a Rapture as a nation amen now Israel God did deal with as a nation and and Christ would come through the Jewish lineage and God protected that seed and today we understand that it's whosoever will but still yet God raised this National Nation this this n this nation for us so that that there could be a end time bride that could carry this word message around the world and could live free but our days are numbered the United States is numbered brother brandham even said way back in the 60s I can no longer say God Bless America oh wow that was way back in the 60s why because she had rejected the gospel she rejected the prophet there was nothing left for America but judgment but here we are amen all these years later and we're seeing it prayer's been taken out of school uh I mean listen there there listen what what they call Christianity out there in the main world today is hallelujah it it it don't it don't even resemble this and and we're called The Cult and and we can take we can go back and find everything we believe right here in the Bible we can we can find everything well come on Church the Bible says for you not to cut your hair the Bible says for a woman not to wear that which pertains to a man the Bible says what praise the lord we are Bible followers but we're living in a land where they're they've taken the Constitution to endorse their sins they've taken something that God so graciously influenced amen tell you can do you can do any drug R you want to right there on your doorstep these days you can do any kind of you you can you can do any kind of sin you want to and it's and it's and it's about legal even if it's illegal it's legal I mean just go look at the main cities here to Chicago go go look over there amen you know in Washington go and see Seattle go go look at all these other I mean listen until until lawlessness has become the norm and we can see that way they're doing these Jewish people in America in America who would have ever thought that there would be so much open in your face on TV PR ticism H against the Jews it's in your face they're doing rallies thousands and thousands and tens of thousands and they're doing it under Free Speech man I just Hallelujah but yet God is blessing you he's bless bling us we ought to be thankful that we can still do this brother what if once they ever turn on you you say will they they sure will oh yeah oh yeah Satan yeah he's wanting to get to the Jews he hates the Jews because they brought the natural lineage they were that natural lineage that brought Jesus Christ there's always been a hatred for the Jews there always will be a hatred for the Jews right but what was the purpose for Jesus Christ coming so Satan's trying to get you too Satan wants to conquer you too we're blessed yes they are taking our Constitution and and and and perverting it until they can do whatever they want to but I'm thankful that we still have a constitution today I'm thankful I'm thankful am I making any sense here today thankful the USA was raised with a purpose man now I want to read you a few more before we uh before we go on but I the the legislative body that governed the United States 30 years after nationhood man um there were there were from from n from from 1774 until 7 1789 there were several national days of prayer and humiliation and and Thanksgiving and president's Washington and Adams practiced uh under that under the Constitution and the first one was observed there in 1782 and and I believe this here was by I believe it was by um uh amen I don't I I'll I'll I'll get to it in a minute I don't think this is from the president this is from the legislative body but it says by the United States in Congress yeah assembled uh Proclamation it it being the indispensable duty of all Nations not only to offer up their supplications to almighty God The Giver of all good for his gracious assistance in a time of distress but also in a solemn and public manner to give him praise for his goodness in general and especially for great and Signal uh interpositions of his Providence in our behalf therefore the United States in

to the success of public calls uh uh perfect union and and good understanding which has hitherto subsisted between them and their allies not withstanding The Artful and unwearied attempts of common enemy to divide them the success of the arms of the United States and those of their allies and the acknowledgement of their independence by another power or another European power whose friendship and commerce must be of great and Lasting advantage to these states do hereby recommend it to the inhabitants of these states in general to observe and request the several states to interpose their

that we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks for his kind care and protection of the people of this country previous to their becoming a nation for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable interpositions of his providance which we experienced in the course and conclusion of the late War for the great degree of Tranquility Union and plenty which we have since enjoyed for the peaceful rational manner in which we have been enable to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness and particularly the national one now lately in instituted for the civil and religious liberty in which we are blessed and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge and in general for all the great and Fa various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us also that we may then unite in the most humble offering our prayers and supplica and supplications to the great Lord and ruler of Nations and beseech him to Pardon

sovereigns and Nations to promot the knowledge and practice of True Religion and virtue and the increase of science among them and US generally to Grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporary proos temporal Prosperity as he alone knows to be best amen president Lee gives a great one too but I know I'm doing a whole lot of reading here this morning I say I say we're blessed Freedom now what about us as the bride we were under the dictates of religious freedom we were under the powers of amen with the opening of the seals you found out how the enemy had taken all the authority and their power away from the church we were under the slavery of sin even as Christians under this come on we had the slave belts of of religion on us but you see am man God has come in this last day when the opening of the book came what did it do it it it it it released the Holy Spirit back in our lives where there was freedom for you and I to be able to love God to worship God hallelujah oh can you say amen amen now in this in this time of darkness and this is a time of Darkness this is a time of Darkness but we can still give thanks unto God why because there is nothing the enemy has been able to do to destroy this church I'm not talking about Pony church I'm talking about the church nothing has ever been able to destroy Satan has tried it through the Dark Ages he's tried to conquer us through so many things through through denominationalism men coming up and trying to separate God's people trying to bring divisions but we are still a people of one king one love Hallelujah we love the Lord Jesus Christ you might not see and and and again I I I I I amen I have no I love my brothers and sisters from all denominations I love listen there are many people from amen that go to churches that that might not even believe like I believe but they love God they're serving God they're giving themselves for the glory of God come on church amen am amen what are we here for we are thankful for the goodness of God upon this people to love him I think we should all worship God aren't you glad that no one has to that that you that you don't have to amen come up and answer to wendle Martin to to to

are saying man if it was up to my mama I wouldn't make it amen when she's coming at me with a belt amen I have no Grace but amen but you see God God has has has given us especially Aliana amen God has given us the uh uh a freedom to worship Him and the scripture even says that sir amen for us to worship God man according to the dictates of our heart what God leads us for not everyone's going to see the gospel like you see the gospel I got to tell you there's going to be a lot there there's going to be a lot more people there than you think's going to be there come on Amen now I I I I just happened to believe that I'm preaching to the cream of the crop amen I'm a little biased I'm sure amen but but why would I be up here preaching if I didn't believe it come on I believe we've got the cream of the crop I believe this church right here in py is [Applause] awesome Hallelujah I know you believe that your pastor is awesome amen so that was a backhanded way to come in for a compliment amen but but you see it's not it's not that I see it your way or You See It My Way it's the holy spirit that is taking us back to the Bible that's what makes this so real are you hearing me I didn't birth you into this church and I can't take you out of it you didn't birth me in and you can't take me out but the power of the holy spirit that has here has made you a peculiar people a royal Nation God has made you his chosen people and we are under the influence and you say hallelujah brother W now now that's just shattering no no no the scripture says the the the ministry the fivefold ministry will be for the perfecting of the Saints for the working of your ministry for the Ed ifying of the body of Christ until we do come into the unity of the faith but I'm not pointing you to me and neither is any of these preachers pointing you to we're pointing you to Christ he's the unifier he's the one when you get man all involved then amen then we got we got everything that we've got today but God's got Believers God's got Believers all over this world they ain't the one that's made the rules and made the all these uh dogmas and Creeds well come on all they want to do is just love God right praise the Lord and I'm thankful for this I'm thankful for this freedom to worship God here this morning I I'm thankful I I'm thankful Hallelujah I'll fight I I I'll fight for anyone's freedom to worship God I don't care whether you're a Baptist I don't care whether you're a Pentecostal I don't care whether you're Methodist amen I I I I I'm thankful for Freedom that we can all worship God are are y'all understanding but here's the here's the kicker when you've heard the shepherd's voice when you've heard the seventh Angel's message when you've heard saying come out of her my people and be ye separate then that is something that is calling you even out of the religious system to himself and saying I've called some for the first resurrection and some for the second Resurrection I I I I want to take the blood of Jesus Christ I want to take God's word because I want to tell you amen he he he's given you these freedoms today he has sent you a messenger in this day not for us to take what we want and discard what we want it's for us to follow the pillar of fire according to the dictates of our hearts and sometimes it's going to take me a totally different direction than what it might be taking that denomination next door but that's okay follow God according to the dictate of your heart but God's placed a predestinated seat on me that is saying I must follow well praise the Lord I'm thankful for that freedom I'm thankful I'm thankful that we can come and love God god brother Brenham would say before right before he passed away he said he said the scriptures that I would like to follow up closely behind if the Lord willing to the Thanksgiving message to the invisible Union of the bride of Christ the invisible Union of the bride of Christ doesn't sound like a Thanksgiving message though any Scripture we're thankful for all of it I'm thankful to God to be living in this time of the closing scenes of the world's history I don't know if I would have had to say so before the foundation of the world and God would have laid out the whole program to me and said I want you to pre preach what age do you desire to go to the Earth to preach he says I would have chose this age for I think this is the Golden Age I certainly would have loved to have been here during the time of his visit to Earth but still I think this right now is a greater time stay with me here I'm fixing the close this is a greater time because it's a time that he's coming to take the people that he's redeemed nearing the resurrection when all the redeem will come forth what a glorious opportunity we have to speak to a dying people what a great time we are enthused about it we know that history is closing out the world's history will soon be over and then we're going to step into a new day to the great Millennium I believe as a Believer I believe in a millennium a millennial reign with Christ A Thousand Years upon the Earth the physical Return of the Lord Jesus to take a physical people glorified by his cleansing blood living in a nation of freedom we're still free we're still free for example to carry guns but people are taking those freedoms and are destroying people and killing them We're a nation now there's many of those nations in European countries they you can't you you can't own a gun you can't own a gun we can own guns but people are taking those things and using them wrongfully we're a people of Liberty but if you're not careful you'll take the Liberties of this nation and become enslaved in your spirit amen in those communistic countries see they don't have the internet like it's a limited source of the internet they don't see the stuff that you see they can they're in a communistic country they're governed by a dictator they're not free to use that internet so maybe they don't see a lot of things that you see and the perversions that you see on that internet but you have freedoms and with this Freedom you can take that freedom and bind your soul by looking at things and filling your heart with things and it'll it'll it'll it'll bind you back up and you're under the dictator of Satan again We're a nation within a nation are you hearing me we live in this nation of freedoms and we're thankful for that nation of freedoms it's because of the internet that you and I or that this message has been able to go free but it's also binding a lot of people let's keep our freedom our freedom I'm talking about me talking about you Austin talking about you Dylan talking about you Jonah the nation is going down I must remain
