it kind of twisted my ankle up pretty good and uh so I had like three different people like messed around on it and then they didn't think anything was broken but then we went to the doctor nothing was broken but he said that there was like some muscle there's going to be like some muscle soreness and it looked like um I can't remember what all he said uh but everything was it was just hurting like the whole back of the leg I couldn't walk on it at all and so I was going through the prayer line and so uh it was like the whole time I was having to like hobble through and I get through the prayer line on Saturday night and it still wasn't healed and so I like go all the way through the back and I was standing back there me and Jonah were back there and um they were just singing and I was standing there and we were leaning up against the wall and I was like I look down and I'm like it don't hurt no more and I was standing there and I'm looking at Jonah I'm standing there and I'm like start twisting my foot around and then start stomping my foot and Jonah's looking at me like as if I had three eyes it was but the Lord uh the Lord came down touched my foot um so I just want to thank the Lord for that glory amen AR aren't you glad that we we know a a serve a risen God a risen Jesus Christ amen somebody else got a testimony real quick praise the Lord amen now be ready come on and we want to hear from y'all so so hurry up Hallelujah don't want to spend all that money to go to camp and then not have a testimony amen um well uh every testimony service I just never want to

my brother my mom always like your brother's going to come in I'm like whatever you know but uh uh I don't know when he said it this time I just I couldn't I didn't know I just broke down and then uh I went through and I kind of just I like I don't know I got like a confirmation my brother's going to come in and then uh I just want to thank the Lord for that to God all right so uh wasn't really wanting much going to Camp I was just wanting a greater feeling fing of the Holy Ghost than I've ever had so first night came hadn't got yet second night came had got it yet so third night brother Andrew Glover preached on gaining uh at the end he was talking about gaining right spirit for the prayer line and organized prayer lines never really did anything for me but that night brother Andrew preached about getting into the right Spirit about thanking God for what you were asking for before you even got up there so I was going up there thanking the lord believing for filling of the Holy Ghost I went through and got my [Music] [Applause] filling Oho I'm nervous well you know in Oklahoma Camp as you guys as brother window said I was touched but the devil told me a lot of things in my mind saying that you wasn't touched and so when I went to Ohio I had my mind I said I have to get touched and I have to get this hly I have to get the Holy Ghost and everything so I went through the prayer line came back crying Kobe showed out of nowhere and he's poed me to the par line again again the second time you know I actually built something went up to the Altar and started praying and I think I I I know I got touched this [Applause] [Music] time all right on on on Devon's deal it wasn't like like okay he needs this twice um me and me and Mary were were standing in the back in our back row and I noticed where the Devon was crying as he walked he was walking our Direction and this prayer line was so big I think there's probably a thousand plus people so they had everyone coming from different directions I mean every roow had a had a you know coming into the prayer line so I just assumed Brother Devon was on his way to the prayer line so I'm like I'm go jump in in line with him I'm going to take him through the prayer line you know and to find out from my wife that that was his second time through so the footsteps of a good man are ordered of the Lord and brother Devin

say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here this evening and um so tonight uh um we're going to be dealing with the um um the origins of the of the Trinity uh Doctrine and so um so we're going to we're going to be dealing a little bit in that and um um brother Brenham goes through some um through some church history and so and again um if there is anything that if we have questions or you know you know cuz some of this can be a a little um you know when you get into some of this history and there's going to be a lot of names and this and that uh you know raise your hand if you if if you if you have have a question um but before we we get into the church age book um you know brother brother brandham had made the statement and and it's a it's a a pretty pretty strong pretty strong statement and so um there in in Revelation chapter 4 he's um he deals with this he says now my precious brother I know this is a tape also now don't get excited let me say this with Godly love the hour has approached where I can't hold still on these things no more too close to the coming see trinitarian trinitarianism is of the devil I say that thus saith the Lord now um you know he would go on and it says look where it came from it it come from the Nan Council when the Catholic Church be in rulership the the word Trinity is not even mentioned in the entire book of the Bible and as far as three Gods that's from Hell there's one God that's exactly right now do you say then do you believe that all these people that are trinitarians are of hell no I believe they are Christians but the hour is approaching brother where they are sincerely wrong any man anywhere anytime that wants to talk on the subject come to me any Minister Bishop Archbishop uh whatever you may be this is tap we'll go around the world and I ask in brotherly love for any person that hears me on this tape around the world that will come to me and show me one text of scripture or one paragraph of any history that's authentic history where any person was ever B AP ized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost until they origined or organized in the Catholic church now so we we want to um uh so this is how strong that brother brandham felt about it now before we um let's I told you 181 or 180 but let's go let's let's look here at page 308 just real quickly and this is a dealing with a a dream that brother brandham had and um let's see let's do it let's start at 307 and the uh the last paragraph there it says now then we can see that Jesus is the door he is the door of the sheep and notice that it speaks now of the door opening and what is that but a revelation of him and that re Revelation is opening up to bring us strength to illuminate the word and glorify his name it was in the midst of the last two ages that the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ blossomed out before us yes we knew he was God how how else could he be our savior but to know that he ought that he was only God or God Alone that he was the Alpha and Omega that this Jesus was both Lord and Christ making him Lord Jesus Christ the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost all one person that had been lost since the first church ages but now we are seeing it again the revelation of who he was had come back indeed the godhead is not threers a three-person god with one personality for it takes a personality to make a person person if there is one personality there is but one person but they who believe in three persons uh have a three good godhead and are guilty of breaking the first commandment but the revelation of the godhead is back now the true church can build in strength again now there's a reason he says that the true church can build in strength again and and he's fixing give us a dream he says after all this time she finally knows who her Lord is once again we are baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus just as they did at Pentecost let me tell you of a god-given dream I had about the Triune baptism this was not a vision but a dream and you know I am I am sure that one of the blessings of the church Ages was to receive Dreams by the Holy Ghost just the same as one can receive visions it was about 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning I had gotten up to get Joseph a drink of water and when I lay down I fell asleep instantly and dreamed this dream I saw a man that I that I supposed was my father he was a great big Burly man I also saw a woman who was supposed to be my mother but she didn't look like her even as the man didn't look at like my father this man was very mean to his wife he had a large club with three corners on it you know when you take a a log and set it on in and and hit it with an axe and it makes three cornered wedge likee piece of firewood uh it was like that and he would take this club and hit her with it and knock her down and he would lie there or she would lie there crying and he would walk around with his chest stuck out and on his facei was such a a proud boastful look that he appeared to take pride and satisfaction in beating up a poor little woman every time she tried to get up he would hit her he did not like uh I did not like what he was doing but I considered stop as I considered stopping him I thought I can't tackle that man he's too big and then he's supposed to be my father but down inside I knew he wasn't my father I knew that no man have the right to be to treat a woman like that I went over and grabbed him by the collar and turned him around and said you have no right to strike her and when I said that my muscles grew and I looked like a giant and the man saw them and then he was scared of me and I said you strike her again and you'll deal with me he hesitated to strike her again and then the dream left me I awoke immediately after the dream and I thought how strange this was and I wondered why I had dreamed about that woman when suddenly there he came the presence of God came uh became known to me and the interpretation of the Dream came from him now you people know that not only have I interpreted your dreams exactly but I have many many times told you what you dream so that you never had to tell me the woman represents the Church of the world today I was born right into this mess the mess that she is in she was supposed to be a kind of mother and she is the mother of harlots and her husband is the denominations that rule her and she Corner uh the three cornered block is a tri false Triune baptism unto a trinity every time she started to rise up that means the congregation begin to accept truth he would drive her right back again with a false Doctrine and he was so big that I was afraid of him at first but when I came against him found that I had great powerful muscles they were Faith muscles the outcome of the dream was that since God is with me and can give me such strength then let me stand up for her against the denominational power of the world and make him uh quit striking her now I am not trying to build a Doctrine Upon A Dream nor am I trying to vindicate any Doctrine I stand for by a dream Oneness of the godhead is all the way from Genesis 1:1 1 to Revelations 22:21 but the people have been blinded by an unscriptural dogma of a trinity and that Dogma is universally accepted that to try to see a one God person is all but impossible if people can't see the truth and this is where I want you to understand as I as I had had uh told you all ago when we were reading and um um that that where I said the true church can build in strength again now and we'd read that there at the top of the 308 now this is this is where you're going to get your strength if people can't see the truth of the godhead but fight but fight it they can't ever see the rest of the truth because the revelation of Jesus Christ in his church and his works in the midst of the church for The Seven Ages did you get that now I'm sure you understand so if you can't catch the mystery of the godhead and you're you're trying to make God three then you'll never truly catch the revelation of what God has intended all along God above us God in Jesus and now God in us if you try to make them three you're missing the point it's good God condenscending God coming down and living in human beings amen and that's that's that's the whole plan of God not to not to mystify God in any way but to and and and you're going to find out as we read tonight that that what Satan has done through the Trinity is to divert the godhead from living in you and me it's it's to it's to it's to get our attention on that Holy away from that holy God living in people Satan wants to make it a religion and and that's that's not the way God's intention is now let's go to let's go to page 181 and um and and we'll start to read there praise the Lord when you're there you can say Amen all right am man so we're going to read uh 181 and we're going to start at the second verse or the second paragraph uh pergamus Satan's throne and dwelling place to many these phrases have have been merily uh pictorial rather than truly historical but they are surely real and history bears that out pergamus was indeed the throne and Dwelling Place of Satan and it happened on this wise pergamus was not originally the place where Satan as concerning human Affairs dwelt Babylon has always been literally and figuratively his headquarters it was in the city of Babylon that the satanic worship uh had its origin he Genesis 108 through1 and Kush begat Nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the Earth he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel Eric and aad and uh canb or Kaa and in the land of Shar and then in Genesis 11 1-9 it says the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East that they found a plane in the land of Shar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go too let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for Mortar and they said go too let us build a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make a name and lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the Lord said behold the people is one uh and they had have one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be retained from them which they have imagined to do go to and let us go down and their confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of the Earth and they left off building uh left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called Babel so there's where there's where Babylon came from and because the Lord did there confound the language of all the Earth and from then did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of the earth now Babel is the original name for Babylon it means confusion it was literally started by Kush the son of ham and but was brought to a kingdom of power and Grandeur through his son nimrod the mighty Hunter Nimrod according to the Genesis 11 account and also according to the profane history set out to accomplish three things he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did and he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished his accomplishments were so Monumental that the kingdom of Babylon was called the head of gold among all the world government that is uh that his religion gained prominence is proven by the fact that the scripture identified it uh uh identifies it with Satan completely in Isaiah chapter 14 and in Revelations uh chapters 17 and 18 and by history we can prove that it invaded the whole world and is the basis for every system of idolatry and theme of Mythology though the names of the Gods differ in various sections of the land according to the language of the people that he made a name for himself and his followers goes without saying for as long as this present age goes on until Jesus reveals himself to his Brethren he will be worshiped and honored though under the different name from Nimrod and in a temple slightly different from the one in which he was originally adored now so now brother brother brandom is saying that that that in churches all over the world Satan the the the worship that Nimrod set up is is going uh is is going to be used throughout all the world even in the Christian world so so you you kids if if y all understood that he's uh the system that was set up way back in Babylon uh in the early times has been brought all the way through all the way down and and that system that that Babylonian way of worship is going to be found even in the Christian church today amen so we don't worship Nimrod and we don't say I I I I I'm I worship Nimrod and I worship uh but we are using his system of worship and and that is and we're going to find that it's a diversion away from Christ so um let's see so we'll we'll continue to go on down it says since the Bible does not deal in the histories of other nations in detail it will be necessary to search the ancient profane records to find our answer as to how pergamus become the seat of the satanic religion of Babylon the major source sources of information will be in the records of of Egyptian and crean culture the reason for this is that Egypt received her Science and Mathematics from the Chaldeans and in turn Greece received them from Egypt now since the priests were in charge of teaching these sciences and since the Sciences were part used as part of religion we already know the key as to how the babylonish the babylonish religion gained its strength in these two countries it is also true that whenever a nation was able to over come another nation in due time the religion of the sedu became the religion of the subdued it is well known that the Greeks had the very same signs of the zodiac as did the Babylonians and it has been found in the ancient Egyptian records that the Egyptians gave the Greeks their knowledge of polytheism thus the mysteries of Babylon spread from Nation to Nation until it appeared in Rome in China in India and even in both North and South America we find the same basic worship now so the polytheism is is multiple gods so um so when we when we hear Brother Bram talking about polytheism it's it's not one God hero Israel the Lord thy God is one it's it's multiple gods and so so we're going to find out and the whole deal is today we we we we hear the Trinity all the time everyone's talking about the Holy Trinity so what brother brandom is going to show us tonight uh is that the Trinity has been around for a long time so we have God the Father God the son which is Jesus Christ and then God the Holy Ghost well that's only that's only been around since the Catholics brought it to to the church but there were other gods long time and The Trinity has been around a long time are we doing okay so far amen all right so um let's see okay so it says the ancient histories agree with the Bible that this babylonish religion was most certainly not the original religion of the Earth's early people it was the first to drift away from the original Faith but it was not itself the original ones historians such as Wilkinson and mallet has proven conclusively from the ancient documents that at one time all the peoples of the earth believed in one God Supreme Eternal invisible who by the word of his mouth spoke all things into existence that in his character he was loving and good and just but as Satan will always corrupt whatever he can we find him corrupting the minds and hearts of men so that they reject the truth as he was has always attempted to receive worship as though he were God and not the servant in creation of God he drew worship away from God to the end that he might draw it unto himself and so be exalted he certainly did accomplish his desire to spread his religion throughout the whole world world this is authenticated by God in the Book of Romans when they knew God they glorified him not as God until they become vain in their imaginations and through the darkness of heart accepted a corrupt corrupted religion to the extent that they worship creatures and not the Creator remember Satan was a creature of God the son of the morning thus thus we find that where once truth was disseminated um amongst the people it and and all held to that one truth there later come a day when a vast group turned from God and spread a diabolical form of worship around the world history Bears it out that those of the tribe of Shem that stood with the unchanging truth were in solid opposition to those of ham who turned away from the truth to the devil's lie there is no time in uh to engage in in a discussion of this it is merily introduced that you may see that there were two religions and two only and the evil one became worldwide monotheism monotheism turned to polytheism in Babylon the devil's lie and the devil's Mysteries rose up against the truth of God and and the mysteries of God in that City so brother brandham says the belief in one God turn into the belief of many gods all right so Satan truly become the god of this world and an exact worship uh from those that he had duped causing them to believe that he was truly the Lord the polytheistic religion of the enemy began with a trinitarian Doctrine it was it was way back there in Antiquity that the one God in three persons idea came into existence how strange that our modern theologians have not spotted this but evidently just as duped by Satan as their uh forebearers were they still believe in three persons in the godhead now did y'all understand that sister keys if you would if if you would go to to uh number two on your slides there so so this was not the first Babylon had came up with the three gods and uh the Nimrod tuse and uh some that other name there and then Egypt they had their three gods Greece had their three Gods India and this is just a few of them I I just I I just wrote down some of these uh Rome uh at at the time at the time that the trinitarians were introduced in in 3:25 uh Jupiter Mars and Venus was the Trinity and so when Christianity came down they took the Roman Church the early uh the Nan Council took down Jupiter Mars and Venus and put up God the Father God the son God the Holy Ghost and and so so this this this theory of the trinitarians did not come from Bible now there they say that the trinitarians uh trinitarianism comes from Bible but it does not come from the Bible it it comes from Pagan worship that goes all the way back to uh Babylon amen are we all clear so far praise the Lord all right now it it says now let us be shown just one place in the scripture where there is any Authority for that Doctrine is it not strange that while the descendants of ham went on their way in satanic worship worship which involved a basic concept of three gods that there is not one trace of The Descendant descendants of Shem believing such a thing or having any ceremonial worship that involved even a type of it is it not strange that the Hebrews believed here o Israel the Lord thy God is one God if there were three persons in the in the godhead Abraham the descendant of Shem in Genesis 18 saw only one God with two angels now how was this Trinity expressed it was expressed by uh equilateral triangle even as it is expressed in Rome today the uh strange the the Hebrews did not have such a concept now who is right is it the Hebrews or the Babylonians in Asia the polytheistic idea of three Gods uh three gods in one came out in the image with three heads on one body now now Sister Keys did I did I give you that uh there was pictures and I don't know if I gave it to you or not one body with the three heads there should be several of them all in one in one picture um I didn't send that to you did I okay well we'll just go on uh because I I I would I had those and I I just didn't uh get to send them in India they found it in their hearts to express him as one God in three forms now that really is is good modern day theology um in Japan there is a great Buddha with three heads like the one we previously described so the the way they worshiped in the old in in back then it was one body three heads so saying one person three personalities that's what they're trying to say so which which we know is absolutely insane you cannot be a person without a personality so if you've got Father Son and Holy Ghost and claim that they are one you're you're you need to go back to math amen so uh it says the most revealing of all that which set forth the trinitarian concept of God in a Triune form of number one the head of an old man symbolizing God the Father a circle in the Mysteries signifying seed which in turn means the son three the wings and Tails of a bird or Dove here was the doctrine of Father Son and Holy Ghost three persons in the godhead a veritable Trinity and you can see the same thing in Rome now let me ask one once again is it not strange that the devil and his worshippers actually had more truth revealed than the father of Faith Abraham and his descendants is it not strange that the worshippers of Satan knew more about God than the children of God now that is what modern theologians try to tell us when they talk of a trinity just remember this one thing from now on these records are facts and this is a fact Satan is a liar and the father of lies and when he comes with any light it is still a lie he is a murderer his doctrine of the Trinity has destroyed the multitudes and will destroy until Jesus comes according to history it did not take long for a change to be made and this concept of a father and a Son and the Holy Ghost Satan took them a step at at a time away from the truth the evolved concept of deity was now the Eternal Father the spirit of God incarnate in a human mother that does uh does that make you think and a Divine son the fruit of that Incarnation the woman's seed now he's he's going on into uh Mary AR in uh ality there in in the Catholic concept he says but the devil is not content he hasn't achieved worshiped of himself yet except in an indirect way so he takes the people away from the truth still further and through his Mysteries he reveals to the people that since the great invisible father God does not concern himself in the Affairs of men but remain silent relative to them then it follows that he may well be worshiped in silence actually it means to ignore him as much as possible if not alltogether this doctrine spread around the world also and right today in India you can see that temples to the great Creator the silent God are strikingly few in number and since it's not necessary to worship Creator father it was now it was only uh natural that worship swung to mother and child as the objects of adoration in Egypt uh was the same combination of mother and son called isus and oseris in India it was YY and awara note the similarity of the names even in Asia it was uh Cil cila and dois I'm sorry that I don't know those how to pronounce those names in Rome and in Greece it followed suit and in China well imagine the surprise of some Roman Catholic missionaries as they entered China and found there a Madonna and child with rays of light emanating from the head of the Babe the image could well have been in exchange for one at the Vatican except for the difference of certain facial features it now behooves us to discover the original mother and child are we all following so far I know I know this reading is uh it there's a lot in it is the original goddess mother of Babylon was Seamus who was called Ria in the Eastern countries in her arms she held a babe who though a babe was described as tall and strong and handsome especially captivating to the women in Ezekiel 8:14 he was called tamuz tamuz among the classical writers he was called bakas to the Babylonians he was nenus what what accounts for the fact that he is represented as a babe in arms yet described as a great Mighty Man is that he is known as the husband's son one of the titles was the husband of the mother and in India where the two are known as wara and YY he the husband is represented as the baby at the breast of his own wife this was nenus uh that that this nenus is Nimrod of the Bible we can affirm by comparing history with the Genesis account pompea said nenus the king of Assyria changed the ancient moderate way uh moderate ways of life by the desire for Conquest he was the first who carried war against his neighbors he conquered all nations from Assyria to Libya as these men knew not the Arts of War dor says nenus was the most uh ancient of Assyrian Kings mentioned in history being of warlike disposition he trained young men rigorously in the Arts of War he brought Babylonia under him while uh yet there was no city of Babylon thus we can we see this nenina started to become great in Babylon built Babel and took over Assyria becoming its king then proceeded to devour other vast territories where the people were unskilled in war and did in moderate way in a moderate way as pompus now in Genesis 10 speaking of the kingdom of nimrod it says the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and heric and hacket and Conor in the land of Shar and out of that went forth Asher and build n and Etc but the translators made a mistake in translating Asher as a noun for it's for it is a verb and in the child in means to make strong thus it is Nimrod who having been made the strong he established the kingdom by building the world's first Army which he trained by Drilling and through the rigorous the rigorous of hunting and went beyond shinard uh with his strong Army and subdued Nations and built such cities as Nineveh which was named after him for even today a chief part of the ruins of that city is called Nimrod since we have discovered that nenus who who nenus was it is now necessary to discover who his father was according to history it was Bell the founder of Babylon now it is it is to be noted here that Bell founded it in the sense that he started the whole move but it was the son nenus that established it the first king Etc but according to the scripture the father of nimrod was kush Kush begat Nimrod not only is this so but we find that ham begat Kush now in the Egyptian culture Bell was called hermis and hermis means the son of ham according to history hamus was the great prophet of idolatry and he was The Interpreter of the Gods another name by which he was uh called Mercury uh henus says this about uh that God who was known uh variously as Bell Hermes Mercury etc for many ages men lived under the the government of zov not the Roman jov but the Jehovah of the Hebrews who PR predates Roman history without cities and without laws and all speaking one language but after the Mercury uh Bale and Kush interpreted the speeches of men whence an interpreter is called herent uh whatever his name is the same individual distributed the Nations this uh then Discord begin now uh and and and and we we go on on down uh a little bit further but I want to stop here so so brother brother brandham is what he's doing he's is bringing in when he when he talks about profane history he's not talking about Bible History he's saying that you can go back in the records of of when the record started back there in Babylon and and you will find that they was that they was there so um now uh sister khila that that uh the statue I think it's I've got number four there um so this is this here you can see um the the the the son that's the son God that's over the the woman's that's a woman and then that's her son so when when Nimrod had died um uh they had deified Nimrod and then his then his wife had gotten pregnant and she claimed that she was impregnated by the Sun and and so now we have got mother and son that are ruling the Earth and so um so this is is basically where uh what we see today we have got uh God the Father you can't you can't see him so he's he's he's the sphere and then you've got Mary and then her son that is ruling and so through the Catholic Church you you go through Mary and uh to get to the sun you've got you've got all of these the these forms of worship and you can see the reason I wanted to bring some of this in tonight um not that it matters but I you know to to to to a lot of us but that it is to to show you that the the trinitarian doctrine and the way that it has come through in the Catholic church is not original from the Bible at all so when people says well it talks about the father Son and Holy H ghost yeah it does talk about the father Son and Holy Ghost but not in the way that the that the Roman Church has has done it there's not three Gods it is one God in three offices so um and and then you go to the mother lifting up to the son sister keys so this is this this is the old this is the way that they presented it is is you know you had the Eternal one uh the son God and then you had mother and child and and so this is the concept even with Christianity Today you can see that that they both come from the same Playbook can y'all understand that amen you you can see where they come from the same uh Playbook But but so when you when you talk about Trinity we're going back to the origins and it's and it's going to be in important because as we as we go further this is where this here in 3:25 uh ad is where the separation took place this is before then it's just been it's been the Deeds of the nianis it's been the Deeds it's been or the you know just just actions and and whisperings and and a few Deeds but now Satan is fixing to make this a Doctrine and he's fixing to drive it down and the way they done it was introducing the Trinity to the church they would forever damned themselves and would end up damning the entire uh uh Christian culture uh uh you know denominational culture because this will separate here o Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord there's not three there is one and what Satan has done he he he brought this in and started bringing it all over to him and and it was it was through it was through this that he was able to start changing things around and and and through one lie goes another lie and then goes another lie until today you can read the Bible that a woman shoulds not to cut her hair and it and and and they say well God don't mean that am they they go on it just they it's but the original lie started with that Trinity until today people are going to church and totally worshiping Satan they're not worship the the word means nothing anymore in the beginning was the word the word is with God the Word was God and it's no longer the word it's it's it's just a religious form and focus all right so any questions here uh uh tonight any any anything that anyone wants to add uh uh so far now this because this is a whole lot of reading and and and you can't you can't you know you can't uh get to it all and when we we're going to start the next time in9 and then he's going to start dealing with that counsil and so I'm not going to read just a whole bunch more here here this evening I might read another paragraph here in a minute but but y'all uh y'all understanding where we're at you understand why the that that that God uh says there in in in in the Old Testament that in that day when it's when it's uh it it's it's not going to be daylight and it's not going to be dark but it's going to be the Twilight he says it'll it'll be a day amen just of of of of of you know just dismal light but there shall be light and in that day his name shall be one again and and that's this great revelation of the godhead has been restored to us again it's important to know get it get it straight get it straight because this is not just religion this is God coming down being a human Among Us and if you don't see that if you're if you're doing some kind of a Babylonian uh tradition you're missing out what God is what God is doing it's God becoming a human being living in you and there is not a religion on the earth that that can ever produce that nothing nothing can produce that God living in our bodies and I I I think that's the most glorious thing any any questions or any [Music] comments praise the Lord amen so um so if you you know we we we're we're thankful we're thankful for the godhead did you have something someone have something over here amen I seen a smile praise the Lord amen yeah yeah yeah yeah it did it did yeah it it took a it took a profit to bring to to to bring that uh uh out to us and to really it to to Really um show why Satan would do what he was trying to do because we're going back to Eden and again you know as as I've as I've said several times God did not start a religion in the book of Genesis it was it was the king the Eternal God who created a body called him his son and and it was it was a king and his Prince and it was a ruler it was to it was to rule and Reign here on Earth that's what the beginning was and and it's and it's not God's desire for us to build churches and all of us become a part of a 10 do the 10 commandments and that it's church church is not the reason for Christianity it's all part of it and we're learning and we're and but but it the the the the vision of God is to live in man on Earth where the king and his children Rule and Reign amen that's why God don't want you being religious don't ever be satisfied with just being religious God wants every one of us Amen to rule and reign with him Sons and Daughters of God living and reality amen and it's the great Eternal God that that that came inside a body amen he created that body in the womb of Mary but Mary was Mary is is is is no more eternal Mary had to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like you and I have to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost there was nothing any special about Mary amen other than God chose her to be the incubator God chose her Amen to place the seed and to care for that seed but but she is no more the mother of God than I'm the mother or the father of God Amen Mary is not the mother of God she was simply The Vessel the incubator as brother Brandon would put it so that we can understand it and for those of us that that that watch the the the chickens or the the Ducks hatch the incubator just that's just the ones that that that that kept the seed alive or or kept it warm so it can do its thing and God created a seed put it in the womb of Mary amen and Mary carried that baby but Jesus was not that Jesus was not the son of of of Mary and Joseph amen there wasn't a bit of there wasn't a bit of human blood in Jes in in in that in that seed God created that blood cell so he's not Jew he's not Gentile the Bible says in the book of Acts we are saved by the blood of God Amen so so we've got to understand that which totally blows away the theory of of what the Catholic church has tried to do with Mary amen so so y'all Y y'all y'all understand that I know it's it's it's it's just as simple as that and as we get into it then then then you're going to understand how the Divide begins to really take place but it started there in 325 and and it and it's grown on until all of the whole world is going to be following after that system sister titha yeah yeah yeah yeah yes yes know word amen and and and I and and that is true because uh brother brandham it showed and and and he and um and you know you could read the uh hiss Two Babylons which is uh which brother brandham uh said that he studied a lot but it's a hard book to read I mean woo uh if you think this is a lot of information that the information in hiss I mean it it it it'll take you uh two hours just to read a page you know because it's it's got so much in it but but that's and I thought brother brandham done a good job here at saying no matter what it was in which society or which part of culture it different names and he will go on saying that uh if you were to read another page or two he would say what we get out of this is no matter what time in history no matter where you are there is a trinity and all cultures are worshiping that the Trinity comes in different names and so here today Satan is being worshiped in the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost and so looking into those that's that's very very true uh sister tibitha and um uh we we ought to be thankful for that there's one God and he's living in Meen praise the Lord somebody else that was that was really that was a good addition sister Tabitha amen anyone else brother Merl yeah yes yeah yeah yeah yeah deception yeah that's right yes tion yes y yep only amen amen they they entire thing the entire and and and and we're not you know and it's going to be he's going to next Wednesday night you'll see that it was so beautifully prophesied because it was once in Babylon and now it is moved to pergamus where Satan's seat is it is moved from Pagan uh the Babylonian system now it's moved into the church and and and and and that's so be and that happened in in uh 325 and so yeah it it's it's quite it's quite amazing and I'm so thankful I'm so thankful that the Lord has opens our eyes to see these kinds of things and to be able to look at this and think oh God not not that we have to understand everything that is that is read tonight that's not that's that's not that's not important what we wanted to understand whether you memorize this stuff or not what we're trying to show is is is brother brandom is letting us see that Trinity has been here all the way uh since Adam or or since Noah's Three Sons you know uh uh there was ham sham and and jasf and so we find that ham it was his seed that that that started this all the way back in that in in that day and that it has been going all the way through so trinitarianism is not anything new not at all it's just it's it's uh it's just an old Pagan system that Satan found his way to get into amen yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right it's a distraction it it it as brother Merl said deception brings distraction because today truly is it TR it's it's just like it's it's just like Pentecostalism the the Satan wants you to get in the jump and the shout and this and that and you miss you miss the whole purpose it's God in a being it's the word in flesh see and and and and Satan wants to do this deception thing an emotional thing and and and and and it truly is that's that's a good word it's a distraction from what the real true purpose of what God has done in this day that's beautiful and I this is a Rapture where God's where God is going to be so in his people that we shall uh have a have a body change amen and shall forever more be with the Lord sister Carol well you know I I I have not um I've not just studied a whole lot as far as as um uh on the Native American side I I I do know that that there is a lot um traditionally ISM that you know they've got the you know the Earth is the mother the it's it's the same type it's the same type there is you know the great spirit and um and and they you know Mother Earth and and then um uh the great spirit God it's basically the same type of worship H it you know because most most all your religions today even today uh whether it be Buddha um uh Hindus it's it's they use the Sun and the Moon and so the sun is is is is the is the male and then the Moon is is the woman and uh the fertility and things of that nature but um you know it in in every one of these religions it is never whether it be the Native American religion or whether it be Hinduism or there is never a religion where that God comes and lives in a human being and lives out his purpose in them it's it just doesn't it just doesn't happen so so it it is beautiful and and I I thought it was interesting you know on on Alba's U uh the the Wake there and and and just going back over the rituals and things that that they do that the rituals are fine you know they all have their meanings but that was all accomplished in Christ Jesus Jesus Paid the price so that we can be totally free we don't have to go through any kind of ritualism we don't have to it it all of these things are done blood has taken care of us so that his Spirit can come and live in us now there's now all of the all the Traditions are dead and past because God lives in me and that makes it beautiful amen wonderful comments here tonight by the way yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah amen amen you know and and and when he when when Jesus says when or yeah he talking to the Pharisees say now when he speaks an error he speaks of his own but but the elect of God we come from the genetics of God that one and true Living God through that predestin seed and that's the reason why we accept truth We Believe truth and we can't be deceived because we come from that this is not religion this is a living God and a living son living daughters that's right predestinated and to be into His Image it's who we are it's what we are just as much as as uh amen the the genetics of mom and dad is within us so is it with the genetics of God within within us as well amen praise the lord well have y'all enjoyed it tonight I'm I'm really um I'm I'm really excited about about this portion that we're getting into because now we're getting into some we're going to be getting into some history and and I think it's going to be really good and and I think you kids are going to enjoy it too now now tonight it it was uh uh I it it was a must that we read this here tonight because I this this is the Crux this is where Satan to come in to to make the wedge and I just want you to understand that I I want I I want you to understand those that are watching online I know I know I know it's it's it's fun watching the the Bill Gaither singers it's fun uh seeing all of the TG Jakes and wonderful preachers it's it's wonderful to see all you can on the internet you can see all of these guys and the tears streaming down their face and and there's just oh and we all and and I know y'all love that every one of your singers that that that you that you love and every one of those preachers that you see out there anointed every one of them I would say 90 9% of them are all baptized in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost they ever they're all trinitarians deception runs deep folks now I'm not saying they're not going to heaven I'm not saying they're not I I I I I am saying that they're missing out on and and that that's up to God but I want to tell you trinitarianism is of the devil and and I don't care how pretty they look and how wonderful are y'all understanding and so and the dividing point this was that was uh this is where it happened and we're fixing to get into it here in these next couple uh Services we'll start seeing how important it is
