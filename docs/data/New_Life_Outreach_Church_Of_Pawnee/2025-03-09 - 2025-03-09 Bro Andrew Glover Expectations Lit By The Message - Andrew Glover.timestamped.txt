[35:44] said you're a very gracious man haven't
[35:46] heard that sermon this morning twice so
[35:48] amen but amen I have to say he backed
[35:51] like he had never heard it so amen I got
[35:54] back here and I got to thanking man the
[35:55] Lord give me some of those things uh
[35:58] last year over in those meetings at
[35:59] brother Ben and brother Miguel and his
[36:00] family was there with us in the meeting
[36:02] and so we we sure appreciate you God
[36:04] bless you brother and your family amen
[36:06] Psalms chapter 62 and verse number five
[36:10] uh this is a very very familiar reading
[36:12] that David gives us here in Psalms 62
[36:15] and5 he says my soul wait thou only upon
[36:19] God for my expectation is from him he
[36:24] only is my rock and my salvation
[36:29] I love this he is my defense I shall not
[36:33] be moved in God is my salvation and my
[36:37] glory now listen what David says he says
[36:40] he is the rock of my strength and my
[36:44] refuge is in God how many knows that
[36:47] David actually was writing from not just
[36:50] a high point but many times in his life
[36:53] he was writing from a low point that
[36:55] actually God is my rock now you know the
[36:59] word Rock in the Bible brother BR picks
[37:00] it up and says Rock actually means
[37:02] Revelation so we could very easily say
[37:05] here that David is saying the revelation
[37:07] of my strength and my refuge is in God
[37:11] now in the Book of Proverbs just a book
[37:14] over I believe in Proverbs chapter 24
[37:17] and verse number 13 Proverbs 24 and
[37:20] verse number 13 uh Solomon here writing
[37:23] he says this in Proverbs
[37:26] 24 and verse vers 13 He says my son eat
[37:30] thou honey because it is good and the
[37:34] honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste so
[37:38] shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto
[37:41] thy Soul when thou Hast found it then
[37:44] there shall be a reward now watch this
[37:47] and thy expectation shall not be cut off
[37:52] amen there there's going to come a
[37:54] reward to the expectation notice this
[37:58] unto thy soul and thy expectation shall
[38:01] not be cut off so in other words God
[38:03] does not have you expecting things but
[38:06] what he has the ability to bring an
[38:08] answer to the expectation one other
[38:11] place in Jeremiah chapter 20 uh it's a
[38:13] very very familiar reading I know we've
[38:16] probably been hearing this verse in
[38:17] Sunday school kids in Jeremiah chapter
[38:19] 20 and verse number
[38:22] n the Bible here says in Jeremiah 20
[38:25] and9 then I said I will not make mention
[38:28] of him nor speak anymore in his name but
[38:32] listen what Jeremiah says but his word
[38:36] was in my heart as a burning fire and it
[38:39] was shut up in my bones and I was weary
[38:42] with forbearing and I could not stay
[38:46] amen notice this his word was in my
[38:49] heart as a burning fire and it was shut
[38:52] up in my bones amen from those verses

[38:57] to want to talk to you on this

[40:21] you have your ceas tonight amen
[40:23] expectations lit by the message I I want
[40:27] tonight maybe to open by just making a
[40:29] couple comments to you here of some
[40:31] things that are very um special to my
[40:33] heart I want to say this about the
[40:35] message of the hour I believe the
[40:37] message of the hour amen has come by the
[40:39] Elijah amen that was promised and
[40:42] prophesied of Malachi 4 now I believe
[40:44] that this message has come amen for the
[40:47] purpose of putting you and I as
[40:49] Believers into an atmosphere of
[40:51] expectation I believe this message has
[40:54] come to grip us to move us to elect us
[40:57] amen to capture us to apprehend us Amen
[41:00] to select us to be a participant in the
[41:02] Rapture amen and in the resurrection now
[41:06] I'll say this the message of the hour
[41:08] has already come amen and it is here to
[41:11] set us in expectation for what God has
[41:15] promised us in his word now just to to
[41:18] lay a foundation here in 1953 brother
[41:21] Ram says I'll tell you what the church
[41:22] needs today amen is an oldtime Holy
[41:25] Ghost fire kindled under her
[41:27] amen fire will move the church and
[41:30] nothing else again he said seeing the
[41:32] Revival fires begin to dim Amen Let Us
[41:35] throw on the wood of the word that it
[41:38] might Kindle a new fire amen that our
[41:40] hearts would be full of zeal 1962
[41:44] convinced and concerned he says what we
[41:46] need is lives amen lit what we need is
[41:50] lives lit a flame with the power and the
[41:53] resurrection of Christ amen shining
[41:56] forth the the same kind of light that he
[41:58] gave another place and just once more
[42:01] Lord he said send down a rain of God's
[42:03] holy fire amen Enlighten our souls Lord
[42:07] with the presence amen of Jesus Christ
[42:09] so here a prophet of God is saying Lord
[42:12] send down the holy fire from heaven amen
[42:15] that our souls might be lightened amen
[42:17] with the presence of Jesus Christ now
[42:20] you all know the Bible said that John
[42:22] actually he told them I indeed baptize
[42:24] you with water un repentance amen but he
[42:27] that cometh after me is mightier than I
[42:30] amen whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear
[42:33] now he shall baptize you with Holy Ghost
[42:36] and with fire so John was baptizing with
[42:39] water unto repentance amen but Jesus
[42:42] said when I come amen you will receive a
[42:45] baptism of Holy Ghost and Fire Paul
[42:48] comes along in Hebrews 12 and he says
[42:50] our God is a consuming fire somebody say
[42:54] well I want Jesus but I don't want his
[42:56] word am you can't have Jesus without
[42:58] having his word amen because they are
[43:01] the same and neither can you have the
[43:03] Holy Ghost without having fire amen
[43:06] because the Holy Ghost is the fire of
[43:08] God brother said see what God does is he
[43:11] cleanses His prophets by fire amen not
[43:14] by theology or some book of some kind
[43:17] amen but he cleans his people by fire
[43:20] that is Holy Ghost and Fire amen not by
[43:23] a declaration of Creeds or a book or
[43:25] something you've got to learn a bunch of
[43:26] Prayer
[43:27] amen but he cleans them by fire off of
[43:30] the altar amen that's how he sets him in
[43:33] order I find it very amazing that God
[43:35] cleans his people amen the same way he
[43:38] cleans His prophets amen he cleans His
[43:41] prophets by fire amen and he cleans his
[43:43] followers or his children the same way
[43:46] he cleans them by fire he said God does
[43:49] not cleanse by knowledge amen he cleans
[43:52] by fire he said getting a holy fire from
[43:55] heaven that takes the light off of your
[43:57] lips it takes the carnality out of you
[44:00] and it burns that stuff that draws to
[44:02] the world Amen and puts his presence in
[44:05] there amen and lives through that person
[44:08] amen so the Holy Fire of God Amen burns
[44:12] out everything in the temple of God
[44:14] that's unlike God that it could move in
[44:16] there and that you would actually become
[44:19] amen a direct reflection of the fire
[44:22] that's why Jesus said amen that you are
[44:24] the light of the world see you are a
[44:26] city that is set on a hill and it cannot
[44:29] be hid neither do men light a candle put
[44:31] it under a bushel amen but on a
[44:34] Candlestick that it giveth light unto
[44:36] all that are in the house he said now
[44:38] let your light so shine before men that
[44:41] they may see your good works and glorify
[44:45] amen your father which is in heaven how
[44:48] can good works amen come out of human
[44:50] beings that have been born in sin amen
[44:53] shaping in iniquity and come in the
[44:55] world speaking lies there's only one way
[44:57] that can happen church is there has to
[45:00] come a baptism of Holy Ghost and Fire
[45:03] Amen to remove the line from our lips
[45:05] amen the carnality from our nature amen
[45:08] the draws from our life that God Amen
[45:11] could inhabit himself in the temple and
[45:13] therefore we could be a direct
[45:15] reflection of him I love what the
[45:17] prophet of God says he said dear brother
[45:19] brandom do you believe that signs amen
[45:21] should follow all who have the Holy
[45:23] Spirit he said well Jesus said so in
[45:26] Mark chap 16 he said then if so amen
[45:30] what about the people who believe the
[45:32] message amen with all that's in them yet
[45:34] they have not these signs amen are they
[45:37] unbelievers or do they need the Holy
[45:39] Spirit he said if so please instruct us
[45:42] today on how to receive the Holy Ghost
[45:45] amen for we believe that you are God's
[45:49] mouthpiece for our day now he answers it
[45:52] and says you cannot receive amen the
[45:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost with without
[45:57] having an experience when it happens you
[46:00] cannot receive the baptism of the Holy
[46:02] Ghost without having an experience when
[46:05] it happens you say well I believe every
[46:07] Speck of it he said the word is laying
[46:10] in there amen but it's waiting for the
[46:12] holy spirit amen to put it to work see
[46:15] but it takes the lighting of the candle
[46:18] amen so you are the candle that God is
[46:21] Desiring Amen to set on fire here's the
[46:24] candle with a wick in it with all the
[46:26] Tallow and everything it has to have in
[46:28] that candle but until the fire comes on
[46:31] it it will not shine any light he said
[46:34] no matter how perfect the candle is how
[46:37] perfect it'll burn and everything amen
[46:39] it's got to be Len and then it burns he
[46:42] said until the holy spirit with a fiery
[46:45] experience comes down amen and lights
[46:48] that candle then you haven't received
[46:51] the Holy Ghost listen folks we are not
[46:53] grandchildren unto God Amen we are
[46:56] children of God
[46:57] amen by a fiery experience of the Holy
[47:01] Ghost and Fire John said behold what
[47:03] manner of love amen the father hath
[47:05] bestowed upon us that we should be
[47:07] called amen not the grandsons of God
[47:11] Amen but we should be called the sons of
[47:13] God Amen therefore the world knoweth us
[47:15] not amen because it knew him not brother
[47:19] comes along and thans it are to be and
[47:21] he says the only way you can be a son
[47:23] and a daughter of God is you have to
[47:26] have etal etal life see the gene of your
[47:29] life spiritual life tonight was in God
[47:32] the Father before there was even a
[47:34] molecule he said and you are nothing
[47:37] amen but the manifestation of the gene
[47:40] of life that was in God as a Son of God
[47:43] but now you are expressed after his word
[47:46] has come in you Amen to light up this
[47:49] age you are the expressing God's life in
[47:52] you because you are a son or a daughter
[47:55] of God see see what I mean you are now
[47:58] made you are sitting in this church
[47:59] tonight because your duty is to express
[48:02] God Amen to this nation and this people
[48:06] and this neighborhood where you
[48:07] associate another place he said we have
[48:10] become from Mortal beings amen from time
[48:12] beans to Eternal beans when did this
[48:15] happen when the word of God lit our
[48:18] souls when the word of God lit our souls
[48:22] we become the Sons and Daughters of God
[48:24] with the attribute or the gene of God in
[48:27] us to be the Sons and Daughters of the
[48:30] father amen God in heaven crying amen AB
[48:34] by father listen folks we have not been
[48:36] set on fire by the music we have not
[48:38] been set on fire by a preacher we have
[48:41] not been set on fire by a gift amen
[48:43] listen we've not been set on fire by
[48:45] just the first pool or just the second
[48:48] pool but there was a third pool there
[48:50] was the opening of the word and that is
[48:53] what has led our souls amen and we are
[48:55] now on fire amen with a revelation of
[48:59] who we were Amen in God before there was
[49:01] one atom or one molecule and we are here
[49:05] on the earth tonight expressing him I
[49:08] love this word lit it means to provide
[49:11] with light or lighting it means to be
[49:13] illuminated to be ignited amen it means
[49:16] to be set on fire it means to be burning
[49:20] when something has been lit it has been
[49:22] ignited it has been set on fire and it
[49:25] is burning I love what Jesus says in
[49:28] John 11 he says I am the resurrection
[49:30] and the life see he that believeth in me
[49:34] amen though he were dead amen yet shall
[49:36] he live and whosoever liveth and
[49:39] believeth in me amen shall never die
[49:42] amen believest thou this he said see you
[49:45] are in him amen and you are believing he
[49:48] said I chose this text tonight to show
[49:50] you where we stand amen we are believing
[49:54] in
[49:55] him now there's a big difference folks
[49:58] in believing in something and believing
[50:00] in something you say well that's the
[50:03] same thing actually it's not amen
[50:05] because there's many people that can
[50:06] drive by this church and they can look
[50:09] over here at this building and they can
[50:10] say I can believe in that church I
[50:13] believe in what they're doing amen but
[50:15] if you really believe in it amen you're
[50:17] not just driving by saying I believe in
[50:19] it the difference is you're actually in
[50:22] here believing in it see you're
[50:24] believing on him until you reach receive
[50:27] eternal life then the eternal life is
[50:30] God's life in you and you are believing
[50:33] in him see it's God in Christ and it's
[50:36] Christ in the church amen see it isn't
[50:39] you no more amen it's the word that's in
[50:42] you and the word is God see he that
[50:46] believeth in me not believeth on me amen
[50:49] but believeth in me the works that I do
[50:52] shall he do also he said why it's his
[50:55] life see it's his Dynamics and his
[50:58] mechanics that's in you that fires it
[51:00] off and makes it Go and Do The Works
[51:03] that it promised to do or my life in him
[51:06] hath quickened Me by his Spirit to make
[51:09] his word which is the mechanics amen
[51:12] work by the Dynamics I love what Paul
[51:14] says in Ephesians 1:18 he says that the
[51:17] eyes of your understanding would be
[51:19] enlightened that you may know what is
[51:21] the hope of his calling what is the
[51:23] riches of the glory of the inheritance
[51:26] in the Saints look at this word
[51:27] enlightened it means to bring to light
[51:30] it means to cause something to exist
[51:33] amen and thus come to light and become
[51:35] clear to all who look upon it in
[51:37] Ephesians 3:8 Paul says unto me who am
[51:41] less than the least of All Saints is
[51:43] this Grace given that I should preach
[51:45] among the Gentiles amen The unsearchable
[51:48] Riches of Christ and to make all men see
[51:52] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[51:55] which from the beginning of the the
[51:56] world hath been hid in God who created
[52:00] things by Jesus Christ who created All
[52:03] Things by Jesus Christ let me show you
[52:06] something here amen at one time no one
[52:09] could look upon this mystery at one time
[52:11] no one could see it but look what he
[52:13] says here he says in 2 Timothy 1:8 be
[52:16] thou not ashamed of the testimony of Our
[52:18] Lord nor me of his prisoner but be thou
[52:21] a partaker of the afflictions of the
[52:24] Gospel amen according to the power of
[52:26] God
[52:27] who has saved us and called us with a
[52:29] holy calling which is not according to
[52:32] our works amen but according to his own
[52:35] purpose and Grace which was given us in
[52:38] Christ Jesus when before the world began
[52:42] amen this was given to us in Christ
[52:45] Jesus before the world ever began but is
[52:48] now made manifest by the appearing of
[52:51] Our Savior Jesus Christ who hath
[52:53] abolished death and hath brought life
[52:57] immortality Amen to lie through the
[52:59] gospel in other words folks the mystery
[53:02] that was hidden in the mind of God is
[53:05] now revealed in the flesh of the Bride
[53:08] of Jesus Christ at one time it could not
[53:11] be seen at one time it could not be
[53:13] understood amen but tonight amen what
[53:16] was in God's mind amen is now in God's
[53:19] church and you are the expression of the
[53:21] attribute of the gene of God listen
[53:24] folks this message is more than just a
[53:26] book

[53:29] make an announcement to you it's the
[53:31] appearing of the Lord in our generation
[53:34] you say well the Lord is coming and sure
[53:36] he is but the prophet of God said there
[53:38] is an appearing of Jesus he said and
[53:41] there's a coming of Jesus he said now
[53:43] the appearing of the Lord is now when he
[53:45] is appearing among his people his spirit
[53:49] is working in them and proving that it's
[53:51] him with them amen getting them ready
[53:54] for the Rapture listen I know people say
[53:57] well amen you don't have to believe the
[53:58] message to go to heaven and I agree but
[54:00] if you're going in a Rapture amen you've
[54:03] got to have something that's going to
[54:05] put you in a condition Amen to take a
[54:07] Rapture amen and the Baptist Doctrine
[54:09] can't do it church amen the Pentecostal
[54:12] gifts can't do it it took the opening of
[54:14] the word it took the revealing of the
[54:17] son of man it took the Thundering of
[54:19] seven Thunders Amen to release an
[54:22] anointing from the word listen this
[54:24] message gripped you this re ation
[54:26] captured you this Revelation selected

[54:40] deepest darkest desert but God will find
[54:42] you there David said if I make my bed in
[54:45] the belly of Hell amen he will find me
[54:48] because I am a part of the Covenant of
[54:51] God yes sir amen this is the appearing
[54:55] of the Lord
[54:56] what is his appearing doing it is
[54:59] getting them ready for the Rapture which
[55:01] is the coming of the Lord amen to catch
[55:04] away his bride amen I'll say this God
[55:08] sent us amen the message of the hour
[55:11] Amen to Enlighten the eyes of our
[55:15] understanding now I'll just say this the
[55:17] message of the hour amen it must be
[55:19] received as a Divine
[55:21] message Paul says in 1 Thessalonians
[55:24] 2:13 he says for this cause also we
[55:26] thank god without ceasing because when
[55:29] you receive the word of God which he
[55:31] heard of us you received it not as the
[55:34] word of man but as it is in truth the
[55:37] word of God now watch this which
[55:39] effectually worketh also in you that
[55:42] believe see the Bible says he that hath
[55:44] an ear Amen Let Him hear what the spirit
[55:47] is saying unto the churches he said it
[55:50] may be that Millions will hear these
[55:51] words or will read them but how many
[55:54] will pay heed to them that we do not
[55:56] know but he who will lend his ear and
[55:59] want to know the words of truth amen
[56:02] will find the spirit of God enlightening
[56:05] him if your ear is open to the word then
[56:08] the spirit of God will make the word
[56:10] real to you amen and that is a work of
[56:13] the spirit he said I can teach you the
[56:15] truth but if you don't open your ear to
[56:17] hear it and your heart to receive it
[56:20] then you won't get the Revelation listen
[56:22] folks it's more than just Abracadabra
[56:25] abrao how make a Son of God out of you
[56:28] no it's the opening or the surrendering
[56:30] or the yielding of your ear and your
[56:33] heart to receive what is being spoken
[56:35] listen and somewhere amen between your
[56:38] head and your heart the Holy Ghost will
[56:40] get a hold of it and it'll become more
[56:42] than a good sermon it'll become more
[56:44] than a quo it'll become more than a
[56:46] cliche but the transforming power of God
[56:49] will take a Sunday night sermon and'll
[56:52] seek it into your heart and it'll become
[56:54] a revelation listen you are a part of
[56:56] the Church of the firstborn hell can
[56:59] come against it but there is nothing
[57:01] that can Prevail against this
[57:04] Revelation Hallelujah you say well I
[57:07] received the message well I'll just tell
[57:08] you this amen there's different degrees
[57:11] of
[57:13] reception I've been preaching since I
[57:15] was 13 been traveling around the world
[57:17] preaching since I was 16 amen I'll just
[57:19] say this I have preached in all kinds of
[57:21] churches and whether you believe it or
[57:23] not one of the hardest things I realized
[57:26] when I started preaching amen was not
[57:28] everybody believed what brother Bram
[57:29] said brother Austin that was the biggest
[57:32] shock to me you know amen cuz I've yet
[57:34] to find the Baptist that argue with what
[57:35] the Baptist Church believes about it
[57:38] I've yet to find a Methodist arguing or
[57:40] a Pentecostal about what their Church
[57:42] believes but I've been in message
[57:44] churches and they say we believe the
[57:46] message and and then I go in there and
[57:47] just start preaching and then all of a
[57:49] sudden we don't believe that and that
[57:50] was brother br's opinion you can't take
[57:52] this and leave that out and I found out
[57:54] amen there's different degrees of
[57:56] reception there are good Brothers amen
[57:59] the only reception they've given to this
[58:01] message is the fact that God sent a
[58:03] prophet amen there's other brothers who
[58:05] who have given the reception to the fact
[58:07] amen that there is a message and and we
[58:09] ought to study it amen there's brothers
[58:11] who Reed this message amen it's just a
[58:14] good idea but then there are those amen
[58:17] who have received this message as what
[58:19] it is listen it is the absolute Amen to
[58:22] this generation what level are you
[58:25] receiving this message at Amen to
[58:27] receive the full benefit of this message
[58:30] you've got to receive it at the same
[58:32] level that it's been sent to you at can
[58:35] I tell you what kind of message this is
[58:37] it's not an icicle message folks amen
[58:40] it's not an intellectual amen cold
[58:42] message amen this is a fiery message
[58:45] amen it has been birthed amen from the
[58:47] pillar of fire listen somebody say well
[58:49] our church is called I say just start
[58:52] preaching the message and if there's any
[58:54] fire in there to be lit this message
[58:56] begins to be preached it'll set a fire
[58:59] in that church listen folks I believe
[59:01] it's time Amen to let the fire of God
[59:04] Amen return to the church unhindered and
[59:07] unrestricted I say let it burn in the
[59:09] pull pits I say let it burn on the pews
[59:12] I say let it burn in our musicians I say
[59:15] let it burn in our singers let it burn
[59:17] in our young people let it burn in our
[59:19] deacons let it burn in our officers this
[59:22] is a fiery message it don't need nobody
[59:24] to correct it it just needs somebody
[59:27] that'll give it some room to burn like a
[59:30] house on fire in a windy day it's a
[59:34] fiery message and you cannot control
[59:36] fire it is a
[59:40] fiery it's a fiery message now I'll just
[59:43] say this in 1963 they told Brother
[59:45] random they said this he said now the
[59:47] people might say our church or our
[59:49] Brethren they say well the cooling off
[59:51] of the message the cooling off of the
[59:54] message and so forth but I love his
[59:56] politically correct answer he says it
[59:58] ain't cooled
[1:00:00] off a't that good sister Angie it ain't
[1:00:04] cooled off they say well the message is
[1:00:06] cooling down this message is not cooling
[1:00:09] down Saints as a matter of fact this
[1:00:11] message is getting hotter and burning
[1:00:14] brighter and stronger now than it's ever
[1:00:16] burned before the churches are cooling
[1:00:18] off amen but you got to get in Christ
[1:00:22] amen and not the church that's why you
[1:00:24] can't depend on the church's Revival if
[1:00:27] the church goes to a cool spot you
[1:00:29] cannot let your fire die amen because
[1:00:32] the church as a whole it's going through
[1:00:34] a cold spell you got to say Lord I'm
[1:00:36] going to feed this fire Amen on Monday
[1:00:39] morning I'm going to feed it on Tuesday
[1:00:42] I'm going to feed it on Thursday I'm
[1:00:44] going to feed it on Friday amen I'm not
[1:00:46] just feeding this fire on Wednesday and
[1:00:49] Sunday amen I'm going to throw some wood
[1:00:51] of the
[1:00:53] word on this fire see because this
[1:00:56] message amen is the fire of God I love
[1:00:59] what the prophet says God in every
[1:01:00] dispensation has sent forth someone
[1:01:03] Anointed with the holy spirit amen to
[1:01:06] bring forth his message for that age
[1:01:08] every time see and when man stepped
[1:01:10] across the message of the hour it
[1:01:13] brought death and Chaos Amen to the H to
[1:01:16] the whole human race he said now that's
[1:01:19] how much amen the message means and
[1:01:22] remember that it wasn't just a blank
[1:01:24] complete denial of what God said that he
[1:01:28] believed it was taking what God Said and
[1:01:30] whitewashing it over or just
[1:01:32] misconstruing it a little bit just
[1:01:34] adding a little bit to it or taking a
[1:01:36] little bit away from it now I'll say
[1:01:38] this amen we believe that the first
[1:01:41] church amen was established on the day
[1:01:43] of Pentecost how many agrees the first
[1:01:46] church was established on the day of
[1:01:49] Pentecost brother said Peter preached
[1:01:51] the inauguration sermon at the bakaro
[1:01:53] service when the church was born the the
[1:01:56] Christian church amen was born on the
[1:01:58] day of Pentecost and God desires that
[1:02:01] his church remain the same amen as he
[1:02:04] started it out amen he says now look but
[1:02:07] man amen has tinkered with it and put
[1:02:10] their own interpretations in it don't
[1:02:12] you never try to interpret the word of
[1:02:14] God you just say what it says and don't
[1:02:18] care how it is amen so just line up with
[1:02:20] it that's all don't you change the word
[1:02:23] the Bible said the scripture is not any
[1:02:26] private interpretation can I just say
[1:02:29] what a prophet said he said we have no
[1:02:31] right to say these things we just got to
[1:02:33] read it and say it exactly like it says
[1:02:37] and believe it the same way I don't care
[1:02:40] how ridiculous it seems you believe it
[1:02:44] anyhow do not Tinker with it just
[1:02:47] believe it anyhow I love this definition
[1:02:50] of the word tinker it means to attempt
[1:02:53] to repair or improve something in a
[1:02:56] casual or a lukewarm way so when you
[1:02:59] begin to Tinker with something you're
[1:03:01] trying to repair it you're trying to
[1:03:03] modify it amen but you're trying to do
[1:03:05] it in a casual way it's an attempt to
[1:03:08] mend something by tinkering can I say
[1:03:10] this you cannot you cannot improve a
[1:03:13] fiery message with a lukewarm YouTube
[1:03:17] channel oh God he you cannot fix a fiery
[1:03:21] message with a lukewarm YouTube approach
[1:03:23] well I'm just going to be a teacher here
[1:03:25] I'm going to tell you where brother BR
[1:03:26] missed it amen listen you're playing
[1:03:28] with fire amen but there's some people
[1:03:31] that knows this message is not cooling
[1:03:34] off it's the word of God to this
[1:03:36] generation when God sends his message to
[1:03:39] an age that message amen captures the
[1:03:42] elect it apprehends the elect and that
[1:03:45] message becomes amen the leadership of
[1:03:48] the lives of the elect of God Amen the
[1:03:51] elect of the age follows amen the
[1:03:54] leadership of the age
[1:03:56] he said now notice here that Jesus by
[1:03:58] the spirit in every age addresses
[1:04:00] himself to only one person amen relative
[1:04:04] to the word for that age only one
[1:04:06] messenger for each age receives what the
[1:04:09] spirit has to say Amen to that age
[1:04:12] listen and that one messenger is the
[1:04:15] messenger to the true church he speaks
[1:04:18] for God Amen by Revelation to the
[1:04:22] churches both the true and the false he
[1:04:25] said the message is then broadcast to
[1:04:27] all but though it is broadcast for all
[1:04:30] who come within range of the message
[1:04:33] that message is received individually by
[1:04:37] only a certain qualified group in a
[1:04:39] certain way see each individual of that
[1:04:42] group is one who has the ability to hear
[1:04:46] what the spirit is saying by the way of
[1:04:49] the messenger and those who hear are you
[1:04:51] hearing me now those who hear are not
[1:04:54] getting their own PR private Revelation
[1:04:57] nor is a group getting their Collective
[1:04:59] Revelation but each person is hearing
[1:05:02] and receiving what the messenger has
[1:05:05] already received from God listen as
[1:05:08] followers of the message of the hour I
[1:05:11] believe the time has come Amen to
[1:05:13] remember what we're following you say
[1:05:15] well I don't think that's very important
[1:05:17] it is because if you know what you're
[1:05:19] following then you know what you're not
[1:05:23] following if you know what you're foll
[1:05:25] following then you can identify what
[1:05:27] you're not following and here's what
[1:05:29] Peter said he said we have not followed
[1:05:32] amen cunningly devis fables wherein we
[1:05:35] made known unto you the power and the
[1:05:37] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:05:40] we're eyewitnesses of his majesty look
[1:05:43] at this word follow it means to follow
[1:05:45] out it means to follow one's Authority
[1:05:49] it means to comply with and yield to I
[1:05:52] love what brother Bram says he says I am
[1:05:54] thoroughly convinced
[1:05:56] that my message comes from God I am
[1:05:58] thoroughly convinced it's not my own
[1:06:01] fleshly mind puffed up it's the word of
[1:06:03] God I am thoroughly convinced absolutely
[1:06:06] convinced that it's Jesus Christ the
[1:06:09] same yesterday today and forever I am
[1:06:12] thoroughly convinced that he's here
[1:06:14] right now I am thoroughly convinced that
[1:06:16] he is camped in here I am thoroughly
[1:06:19] convinced he will answer our prayer if
[1:06:21] we'll be concerned convinced and open
[1:06:25] our l to it see watch another place
[1:06:28] since the opening of those Seven Seals
[1:06:30] of them Angels just behind the mountain
[1:06:32] Yonder this book has become a new book
[1:06:36] it's the things that's been hid is being
[1:06:39] revealed as God promised in Revelation
[1:06:41] 10 he would do and we are amen the
[1:06:45] privileged people that God has chosen of
[1:06:48] the earth that we might see and
[1:06:51] understand these things which is not
[1:06:53] some mythical amen Earthly fleshly Mind
[1:06:56] of a person trying to make it up it's
[1:06:59] the word of God made manifest it's been
[1:07:02] proven that it's right amen not by
[1:07:04] science amen but proven by God how many
[1:07:07] can say we are now enjoying the message
[1:07:11] of the hour we are now walking in the
[1:07:14] evening light we are now believing the
[1:07:17] original identity of who we were from
[1:07:20] before the foundation of the world
[1:07:22] Listen the devil interpreted who you
[1:07:24] were amen for years and you believed it
[1:07:26] he said you was a drunk and you believed
[1:07:28] it he said you was a drug addict and you
[1:07:30] believed it he said you was a nobody and
[1:07:32] you believed it he said you was the scum
[1:07:34] of the earth and you believed it but oh
[1:07:37] it's high time Amen to change what
[1:07:40] you're believing about who you are the
[1:07:42] word says you're Overcomers the word
[1:07:45] says you're Victorious the word said
[1:07:47] that you would have a stable and a sound
[1:07:49] mind the word said amen that you would
[1:07:52] have joy unspeakable it would be full of
[1:07:55] Glory the word said you would not be
[1:07:57] drunk on wine but you would be filled
[1:08:00] with the Holy
[1:08:03] Ghost my goodness now enjoying our true
[1:08:10] identity the message of the hour has lit
[1:08:13] an expectation in us that what we read
[1:08:16] in the word can be fulfilled in our
[1:08:20] lives when I say expectation that is a
[1:08:24] strong belief somebody say strong
[1:08:26] belief that something will happen or
[1:08:30] will be the case in the future see it's
[1:08:34] a belief that someone will or should
[1:08:38] achieve
[1:08:39] something now I just got to say it folks
[1:08:42] our beliefs are
[1:08:46] strong what we believe is strong we
[1:08:49] don't believe weakness listen here the
[1:08:52] Bible said Romans 4:20 it says Abraham
[1:08:54] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:08:58] through unbelief but he was strong in
[1:09:01] faith giving glory to God do you realize
[1:09:04] our beliefs are strong amen just like
[1:09:08] Father Abraham's in other words the
[1:09:10] prophet of God said this he said I would
[1:09:12] to God that you could come under the
[1:09:14] influence that I live under and my
[1:09:17] church lives under for we believe that
[1:09:19] God Is A Healer we believe that God is a
[1:09:22] savior and we believe that God gives the
[1:09:25] Holy Spirit and those three powerful
[1:09:27] beliefs in the Church of the Living God
[1:09:30] we believe he's a savior we believe he's
[1:09:32] a Healer and we believe he gives the
[1:09:35] Holy Ghost see that's our expectation
[1:09:39] that's what we get amen we get what we
[1:09:41] expect let me say this sometimes amen
[1:09:44] the only time that we come into the
[1:09:46] element of expectation is around the
[1:09:49] time of the Fall meetings or around the
[1:09:51] time of a special preacher or around the
[1:09:53] time of Youth Camp but according to the
[1:09:55] word that has lit our souls amen we are
[1:09:58] to live in the atmosphere and under the
[1:10:01] anticipation and expectation of what God
[1:10:04] can do anywhere any time in any service
[1:10:08] now I love it because when brother Bram
[1:10:09] preaches expectation he takes it from a
[1:10:12] man named Simeon and he says behold
[1:10:14] there was a man in Jerusalem Luke 2:25
[1:10:18] whose name was siman and the same man
[1:10:20] was just and devout he was waiting for
[1:10:23] the consolation of Israel
[1:10:25] now look here and the Holy Ghost was
[1:10:28] upon Him skip down to verse amen the
[1:10:31] Holy Ghost was upon Him brother Bram
[1:10:33] said in that great evil day of formality
[1:10:37] and indifference the Holy Spirit could
[1:10:39] still amen rest on a man it was revealed
[1:10:43] verse 26 and it was revealed unto him
[1:10:47] amen by the holy ghost that he would not
[1:10:50] see death before he had seen the Lord's
[1:10:53] Christ the Holy Ghost settled on Simeon
[1:10:57] and begin to release unto him a
[1:10:59] revelation amen that built an
[1:11:02] expectation I'm not going to die until I
[1:11:04] see the Lord's Christ now look here that
[1:11:07] expectation brother Merl did not leave
[1:11:09] him hanging but that same Revelation
[1:11:12] from the Holy Ghost Amen in verse 27 it
[1:11:16] brought him to the temple oh Church
[1:11:19] there shall be a reward to my
[1:11:22] expectation and it shall not be cut off
[1:11:25] listen if you are expecting God he is
[1:11:28] not a God that says I'll give you this
[1:11:30] expectation but I have no ability to
[1:11:33] perform it but my Bible said that the
[1:11:36] Zeal of the Lord shall perform this in
[1:11:39] the camp of Israel listen folks if God
[1:11:42] promised you it's going to happen come
[1:11:44] hell or high water God will fulfill his
[1:11:47] word in the face of every
[1:11:50] devil there ain't a devil big enough
[1:11:53] there ain't a devil strong enough there
[1:11:55] ain't a devil bad enough Amen to defeat
[1:11:58] my God in fulfilling the promises of his
[1:12:01] word in the lives of his believing
[1:12:05] children an 80y old
[1:12:08] sage yeah that's what brother Bram
[1:12:10] called him with a white beard said I'm
[1:12:13] not going to die until I see the Lord's
[1:12:17] Christ brother B said Simeon did not
[1:12:19] reason it he believed it he said that's
[1:12:22] what you do you believe it see the Holy
[1:12:26] Spirit found a man to believe the
[1:12:29] message of that hour brother B said this
[1:12:33] he said it's the Holy Spirit today
[1:12:35] that's hunting out honest hearts that
[1:12:37] will believe that
[1:12:40] message you say what's the message can I
[1:12:42] say what a prophet said everything in
[1:12:45] the
[1:12:46] Bible everything in the Bible that was
[1:12:49] promised is to that believer listen and
[1:12:52] when you accept it in its fullness and
[1:12:55] God knows you'll do it oh God God knows
[1:13:00] you'll do it then he gives you the
[1:13:03] abstract to it I was a poet and didn't
[1:13:05] know it no just kid amen when God gives
[1:13:08] you the promise amen he gives you that
[1:13:10] and you accept it in its fullness listen
[1:13:13] then He gives you an abstract to that
[1:13:16] promise and then every promise that's
[1:13:18] made is your possession and the Holy
[1:13:21] Spirit is here Amen to Quicken that to
[1:13:24] you you say how's it going to happen
[1:13:26] brother Andrew wherever you go whatever
[1:13:28] you do what you expect amen brings your
[1:13:32] faith if you come here tonight saying I
[1:13:34] come for one sole purpose that is to
[1:13:36] contact Christ for my body or my soul
[1:13:39] you will go home just as happy as you
[1:13:42] can be for you will contact him now no
[1:13:45] matter what the opposition looks like
[1:13:48] here we go Church no matter what the
[1:13:50] opposition looks like amen Christ is the
[1:13:54] answer woo glory to God faith it brings
[1:13:57] Christ then Faith are you hearing me
[1:14:00] Faith knows no defeat somebody say faith
[1:14:03] is
[1:14:04] perfect can I say this one Faith brings
[1:14:07] things when there's no things to be
[1:14:09] brought Faith creates Faith takes doubt
[1:14:13] away it takes the negative and makes it
[1:14:15] positive he said so that old man had a
[1:14:19] basis for faith faith is not mythical
[1:14:22] it's something not mentally worked up
[1:14:24] it's an absolutely fundamental result
[1:14:27] amen that happens in a person's heart
[1:14:31] see so the foundation of our faith it
[1:14:33] must be a spiritual Revelation then we
[1:14:37] can expect the impossible amen I told
[1:14:41] you this morning take the limits off of
[1:14:42] God can I tell you something tonight
[1:14:45] it's time Amen to expect the impossible
[1:14:49] I said it's time to expect the
[1:14:51] impossible because faith is the
[1:14:54] foundation
[1:14:55] of our expectation which is a revelation
[1:14:58] and my Bible said the Gates of Hell will
[1:15:01] not Prevail against the spiritual church
[1:15:05] that Jesus Built his own self what are
[1:15:07] you saying brother Andrew I'm saying
[1:15:08] it's time Amen to quit coming to church
[1:15:11] with little old mediocre expectations
[1:15:13] and well maybe we'll just have a good
[1:15:15] service and maybe somebody will shout
[1:15:18] maybe somebody get a blessing I say it's
[1:15:20] time Amen to expect big things I say
[1:15:23] it's time oh glory to God God I say it's
[1:15:26] time Amen to expect the impossible you
[1:15:29] want to change the atmosphere in this
[1:15:31] church release your expectations unto
[1:15:34] the leadership of the Holy Ghost and let
[1:15:37] him lead you beyond your own sound
[1:15:39] barrier let him lead you beyond your own
[1:15:41] imagination let him lead you out into
[1:15:43] the Realms of spiritual Revelation where

[1:16:14] am too I'm expecting big things in two
[1:16:16] weeks oh when Camp rolls around I'm
[1:16:19] sorry I've got the same expectations
[1:16:21] here tonight that I've got for the Youth
[1:16:24] Camp you know you know why because my
[1:16:26] expectations are not built on the
[1:16:29] shifting Sands of man's ideas my
[1:16:32] expectations are built on the revelation
[1:16:36] of thus saith the
[1:16:38] Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen I say
[1:16:42] this we have a right brother Merl we
[1:16:45] have a right to expect the impossible
[1:16:48] you say why I told you this morning our
[1:16:50] God is the unlimited God can I tell you
[1:16:53] something tonight our God is the god of
[1:16:57] the
[1:16:58] impossible woo somebody shout hallelujah
[1:17:01] our god is the god of the impossible
[1:17:05] look here in St Luke chap 1:37 he says
[1:17:08] for with God Amen something or a few
[1:17:12] things shall be impossible no my Bible
[1:17:15] says with God Amen nothing shall be
[1:17:20] impossible look at St Mark chapter 9 and
[1:17:23] verse 23 Jesus said unto him if thou
[1:17:26] can't believe then all things are
[1:17:31] possible to him that believeth can I
[1:17:34] tell you what a prophet said he said you
[1:17:36] don't have to feel nothing he said you
[1:17:38] don't have to see nothing but you do
[1:17:40] have to believe something amen you don't
[1:17:42] have to feel nothing see nothing smell
[1:17:45] nothing sense nothing but you do have to
[1:17:47] believe something you know why because
[1:17:50] all things are possible to them that
[1:17:53] believe and Matthew 17 the father there
[1:17:56] with the epileptic child he took the
[1:17:58] child unto the disciples and they could
[1:18:01] do nothing for him so he brought him to
[1:18:03] Jesus and brother said this he said now
[1:18:05] you say all things are possible with God
[1:18:08] he said all things are possible to
[1:18:12] you Hallelujah did I read that right
[1:18:16] brother
[1:18:17] Colby all things are possible to you see
[1:18:23] to them that believe
[1:18:25] I love the next question he asked you
[1:18:27] believe
[1:18:30] that all things are possible to them
[1:18:35] that believe do you believe that can I
[1:18:38] tell you New Life Outreach God's power
[1:18:41] to perform the impossible is not coming
[1:18:44] in two
[1:18:45] weeks God's power to perform the
[1:18:48] impossible is not coming next week or on
[1:18:51] Wednesday night God's power to perform
[1:18:55] impossible is here brother R said you
[1:18:58] just take the right mental attitude
[1:19:00] towards any Divine promise now listen
[1:19:02] watch it materialize no matter how it
[1:19:06] looks if it looks impossible if God said
[1:19:09] so he makes it possible another place
[1:19:13] second-handed robe 1956 in order to do
[1:19:16] the impossible you've got to call on God
[1:19:18] for power of God to perform the
[1:19:22] impossible I love this one if we be the
[1:19:26] messiah's servant then we have to have
[1:19:30] the messiah's
[1:19:31] power oh church if we be the messiah's
[1:19:36] servant then we have to have the
[1:19:39] messiah's power I love this when I have
[1:19:41] heard but now I see paragraph 55 you see
[1:19:44] when a man or a person has once really
[1:19:47] come in contact with god with that
[1:19:49] genuine revealed Faith now come on can I
[1:19:53] tell you what genuine revealed faith is
[1:19:56] amen genuine revealed faith is God
[1:20:00] is somebody say that with me God is God
[1:20:04] is say it again God is not God
[1:20:09] was brother can not God will
[1:20:12] be God is genuine revealed faith is this
[1:20:18] God is oh I got to thinking about that
[1:20:20] the other day then you know what I can
[1:20:22] say I can say God is here I can say God
[1:20:25] is my healer I can say God is my savior
[1:20:28] I can say God is my way maker I can say
[1:20:31] God is my Miracle Worker I can say God
[1:20:33] is my Rapture I can say God is my
[1:20:36] provider I can say God is my protector
[1:20:38] brother Kobe if God is I can say God Is
[1:20:41] My
[1:20:43] Everything Hallelujah you know what I
[1:20:45] say I say it's time to change your
[1:20:47] confession from God will be or God was
[1:20:51] to God is he is here right now he is
[1:20:54] here in power God is here to save God is
[1:20:57] here to deliver God is here to restore
[1:20:59] my mind God is here to calm my nerves
[1:21:02] God is here to break the chains of that
[1:21:04] addiction that's trying to drive me to a
[1:21:06] premature grave God is here and that
[1:21:10] becomes a genuine revealed Faith then
[1:21:13] there's no devil in hell or in this
[1:21:16] Dimension that can conquer a child of
[1:21:19] God that says God
[1:21:22] is hallelujah God is
[1:21:25] God is there's nothing no time
[1:21:30] nowhere can ever separate that man from
[1:21:36] his God now folks either we believe it
[1:21:38] or not and the Bible says that God can
[1:21:41] only lead a man as he will let him lead
[1:21:45] God can only work with anyone that will
[1:21:48] let him work with him listen in the
[1:21:50] church age book he gives us a very
[1:21:51] beautiful study on leadership he says I
[1:21:54] want to say that I believe in leadership
[1:21:57] but it's not the leadership of men I
[1:21:59] believe in I believe in the leadership
[1:22:03] of the Holy Ghost coming through the
[1:22:06] word I believe also that God has set men
[1:22:10] in the church who are gifted by the
[1:22:12] spirit and they will keep the church in
[1:22:16] order he said now here it is they were
[1:22:18] under the leadership speaking of Israel
[1:22:20] of the spirit of God manifested in gifts
[1:22:23] he said see God was the leader of the
[1:22:25] people he actually was their King he
[1:22:28] said he was a father King he just busied
[1:22:31] himself over them he said now God was
[1:22:34] going to humanize they were remember
[1:22:36] they were wanting human leadership so
[1:22:38] brother Kobe said God was going to
[1:22:41] humanize amen the leadership of himself
[1:22:44] listen to this Amen in the person of the
[1:22:47] Lord Jesus Christ but what they did was
[1:22:50] they got ahead of him now Satan knew the
[1:22:53] plan of God so he put it in the heart of
[1:22:56] the people to get ahead of God the word
[1:23:00] another place he said you put the
[1:23:02] leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and
[1:23:06] the church is nothing but the world with
[1:23:09] God's name attached to it if you put the
[1:23:13] influence of the god of the impossible
[1:23:16] out of the church it is nothing but the
[1:23:19] world with God's name attached to it can
[1:23:22] I say it very plain the spirit of God
[1:23:25] makes the difference folks come on let's
[1:23:28] just preach the spirit of God makes the
[1:23:31] difference you say well I don't think it
[1:23:33] makes much difference I pray to God we
[1:23:35] never have one service where the spirit
[1:23:37] of God is not in attendance I pray he's
[1:23:40] here when we get out of our cars I
[1:23:42] praise here in the song service I praise
[1:23:44] here in the prayer request I praise here
[1:23:46] in the preaching I praise here in the
[1:23:48] specials I praise here in the young
[1:23:50] people I say oh God we want a
[1:23:52] Spirit-filled church a Spirit L spirit
[1:23:55] filled and word fed Church of the Living
[1:23:59] God hallelujah what are you saying I'm
[1:24:01] saying it very plain nobody wants to
[1:24:02] talk about it no more everybody just
[1:24:04] wants to re against it but let's just
[1:24:06] let the rubber hit the road preach a
[1:24:07] minute I'm feeling too good brother
[1:24:09] Donald they forgot there's a sin against
[1:24:12] the spirit yeah you know what Isaiah
[1:24:15] 63:10 says he said but they rebelled and
[1:24:19] they vexed his holy spirit therefore he
[1:24:22] was turned to be their enemy
[1:24:24] and watch this he fought against them
[1:24:27] look here in the New Testament in
[1:24:29] Matthew 12:31 wherefore I say unto you
[1:24:32] that all manner of sin and blasphemy
[1:24:35] shall be forgiven unto man now are we
[1:24:38] reading the same
[1:24:40] thing but the blasphemy against the Holy
[1:24:45] Ghost shall not be forgiven unto man I
[1:24:51] know that I I picked that up that line
[1:24:53] devil he loves to tell God's children
[1:24:56] you
[1:24:57] blasphemed you blasphemed and you've
[1:25:00] crossed the line and you're
[1:25:04] finished well guess what I want to tell
[1:25:06] him he's
[1:25:11] finished he's finished come on church
[1:25:14] that devil tells you listen if you
[1:25:16] really blaspheme God why are you
[1:25:19] here come on come on if you're really
[1:25:22] black come on Church if you really
[1:25:25] blasphemed God why are you here brother
[1:25:27] Ram said if remember he called that
[1:25:29] woman up he said now the devil's telling
[1:25:31] you that God don't love you he said do
[1:25:33] you love God she said with all my heart
[1:25:35] he said see there had to be a God Amen
[1:25:38] create that desire in your heart to love
[1:25:41] him can I just say it to you and get it
[1:25:43] out there God ain't done with
[1:25:45] you god ain't finished with you I don't
[1:25:48] care what road you've been down I don't
[1:25:50] care what mistakes you made I don't care
[1:25:52] what sins and what habits and what
[1:25:54] addictions and what problems are binding
[1:25:57] your Liberty I come by to tell you God
[1:26:00] ain't done with you he's still a god of
[1:26:03] Salvation he's still a god of mercy and
[1:26:05] the devil is finished tonight because he
[1:26:08] is a
[1:26:12] liar you say blasphemy against the holy
[1:26:14] ghost look at this look at this look at
[1:26:16] this definition of blasphemy you know
[1:26:18] what it means brother it means
[1:26:22] slander it means empower ious and
[1:26:25] reproachful
[1:26:27] speech and it is injurious to Divine
[1:26:31] Majesty can I just say something we
[1:26:34] better ask the Holy Ghost to Bridle our
[1:26:39] tongues that's why Paul said in
[1:26:42] Ephesians 4:29 he said let no corrupt
[1:26:45] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:26:48] but that which is good to the use of
[1:26:50] edifying listen that it may Minister
[1:26:53] Grace unto the hearers and grieve not
[1:26:56] the holy spirit of God whereby ye are
[1:27:01] sealed unto the day of redemption in 1
[1:27:04] Thessalonians 5:19 Paul says again four
[1:27:07] four four powerful words he says this
[1:27:10] quench not the
[1:27:14] spirit are you reading what I'm reading
[1:27:17] quench not the spirit look at this word
[1:27:20] quench it means of fire or things on
[1:27:23] fire
[1:27:26] come on to be quenched to go out to
[1:27:29] suppress to stifle Divine influence so
[1:27:34] fire is actually a Divine influence in
[1:27:38] other words he's saying quench not the
[1:27:40] fire or quench not the Divine influence
[1:27:44] because whatever is influencing you is
[1:27:47] leading you remember he comes there at
[1:27:49] the end of his ministry and leadership
[1:27:51] in cenia California 1965 and he says
[1:27:54] this but now who leads you he said
[1:27:57] that's the question now now we're all
[1:28:00] led by something tonight we have to be
[1:28:03] he says we're L you know what a prophet
[1:28:05] said he said we today are God's
[1:28:08] spiritual church with a spiritual law
[1:28:10] that is written on the tables of our
[1:28:12] hearts and we are LED in a spiritual
[1:28:15] form he said now back there they looked
[1:28:18] up to see where the pillar of fire was
[1:28:21] the angel of the Lord he said but we
[1:28:23] don't look today
[1:28:24] because there's something that's
[1:28:26] happened and we know that he's here so
[1:28:29] the pillar of fire is put the whole move
[1:28:32] of God into action I'll say this we are
[1:28:36] following the scripturally identified
[1:28:38] Pillar of Fire of Exodus 13 He said
[1:28:41] Luther knew it was coming Wesley knew it
[1:28:43] was coming finny Knox and Calvin they
[1:28:46] knew it was coming he said they knew
[1:28:48] there would come a time that the pillar
[1:28:50] of fire would return back to the church
[1:28:52] they know there would come a time that
[1:28:54] these things would happen but they did
[1:28:56] not live to see it he said but they look
[1:28:59] forward to it now come on do you realize
[1:29:02] the expectations of one generation can
[1:29:05] be fulfilled in
[1:29:08] another hello the expectations of one
[1:29:12] generation can be fulfilled do you
[1:29:15] realize that Paul wrote to the
[1:29:16] Corinthians and the thalin and he said
[1:29:19] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[1:29:21] be changed he said we not all go by the
[1:29:23] way of the Great
[1:29:24] amen but we'll be alive and remain can I
[1:29:27] show you something there's not one
[1:29:29] thalin Alive Tonight folks there's not
[1:29:32] one Corinthian alive tonight so does
[1:29:34] that mean that expectation has been cut
[1:29:37] off I say no that means that expectation
[1:29:41] is going to be fulfilled in the Gentile
[1:29:44] bride that has been called out of leoa
[1:29:47] by the message of Malachi chter 4 oh
[1:29:50] church if you could only see that God
[1:29:52] can give a promise in one generation and
[1:29:55] he can fulfill it in the next the pillar
[1:29:58] of fire see he said that's some of the
[1:30:00] Mysteries this Angel is supposed to wind
[1:30:02] up amen all the mysteries of God he said
[1:30:05] see the pillar of fire returning back
[1:30:08] amen that's the thing that's supposed to
[1:30:11] take place now watch a prophet he said
[1:30:13] they look forward to it he said but we
[1:30:16] see
[1:30:17] it glory to God they were looking
[1:30:21] forward to
[1:30:22] it brother and we see it we see what
[1:30:27] they were expecting what do we see we
[1:30:30] see the pillar of fire revealing the
[1:30:32] word word by word stay with the Bible
[1:30:36] what are you saying I'm saying the
[1:30:37] pillar of fire moves
[1:30:39] forward brother bam said God's either
[1:30:41] going to lead the church the Holy Ghost
[1:30:43] is going to lead it or man's going to
[1:30:45] lead it now listen to what he says if
[1:30:48] you choose man go ahead God pulls his
[1:30:52] church right out and the pillar of fire
[1:30:54] moves on and the church moves with it he
[1:30:58] said see what Pentecost done was they
[1:31:01] stake down till they cannot move let me
[1:31:03] just say this the Pentecostal was the
[1:31:06] last great move but a prophet said
[1:31:10] that's not the latter reign of today he
[1:31:13] said the great Pentecostal Revival is
[1:31:15] now ceasing we see it everywhere the
[1:31:17] last great move the message has went
[1:31:19] forth everything's ready now waiting he
[1:31:21] said the church is Seal away the wicked
[1:31:23] are doing more wicked the churches are
[1:31:25] becoming more churchy here it is but the
[1:31:28] Saints are coming closer to God see so
[1:31:31] the Pentecostal move got so staked down
[1:31:34] in organization and denomination until
[1:31:37] it died and in 1965 you can hear it on
[1:31:40] the tape of invisible union he screams
[1:31:43] out these words he says God let it die
[1:31:47] God could have kept it alive but God let
[1:31:50] it die he said see what happened amen
[1:31:52] the shuck had to dry up to give forth a
[1:31:56] seed amen listen because there must come
[1:31:59] something that cannot be organized and
[1:32:02] die because organization spells death oh
[1:32:06] I wish I had the voice of a Thousand
[1:32:08] Angels tonight to say what a prophet was
[1:32:12] prophesying is fulfilled in this church
[1:32:17] tonight God I wish I was a preacher
[1:32:19] right now what a prophet was prophesying
[1:32:21] is right here in the flesh of every
[1:32:24] believer of this end time word he said
[1:32:27] what happened Pentecost represented Mary
[1:32:29] Mary the last stage of it now but Mary
[1:32:32] was not the
[1:32:33] seed Mary was not the seed yet the life
[1:32:39] of the seed was in her but it hadn't
[1:32:42] matured yet he said so it is with our
[1:32:44] great Pentecostal age we're living in
[1:32:46] there has got to come forth a word of
[1:32:49] God that's inner undenominational listen
[1:32:53] it's outside side of the Realms of
[1:32:58] denomination now I don't know I pray
[1:33:01] it's okay amen amen I it's just on my
[1:33:04] heart people say all the time they say
[1:33:07] y'all's a bunch of crazy
[1:33:09] people y'all believe crazy things and
[1:33:12] and what y'all believe is you know they
[1:33:14] say brother Dyan it's not even really in
[1:33:15] the Bible you know they say y'all
[1:33:17] believe all this stuff and all these
[1:33:19] promises and right Coe you're a preacher
[1:33:20] you've heard it amen all these things
[1:33:22] and all these situ and amen and you
[1:33:25] don't have no no scripture for it well I
[1:33:27] got to I got to sitting down one day and
[1:33:29] I just took time I didn't even get my
[1:33:31] computer or my my Bible out I just
[1:33:33] started writing down from memory amen
[1:33:36] scriptures that identify what we believe
[1:33:38] and who we are brother Merl can I give
[1:33:41] you just a few of
[1:33:42] them Joshua chapter 1 Psalm chapter 1
[1:33:46] Psalm 27 Daniel 11 and 12 Hosea 6 Joel 2
[1:33:51] Amos 3 habca 2 Zechariah 4 Zechariah 14
[1:33:55] Malachi 4 Matthew 17 Mark 11 Mark 16
[1:34:00] Luke 17 John chapter 12 14 15 16 Acts
[1:34:04] chapter 3 2 Corinthians chapter 3
[1:34:06] chapter 15 Colossians chapter 1 1
[1:34:09] Thessalonians chapter 4 Hebrews chapter
[1:34:11] 13 Revelations chapter 1 3 5 8 10 13 17
[1:34:16] 18 19 20 21 and 22 somebody tell me that
[1:34:21] what we believe is not in the scripture
[1:34:24] I say it's all in the scripture because
[1:34:27] you are the Virgin born bride who will
[1:34:30] not be tainted with a hands of
[1:34:33] denomination there will be no man
[1:34:35] handling in the Virgin birth of the word
[1:34:38] born bride of Jesus
[1:34:40] Christ the scripture today has
[1:34:43] thoroughly identified this great move of
[1:34:45] God let me say this very plainly and
[1:34:47] very boldly the same scriptural Ministry
[1:34:50] that was identified in Christ amen you
[1:34:52] say in Christ yes sir amen is now
[1:34:55] identified in the bride we see them
[1:34:58] happening like all the promises he says
[1:35:00] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 oh how many more
[1:35:04] scriptures are you ready for this he
[1:35:07] says it would be endless if we begin to
[1:35:10] list all the scriptures amen that are
[1:35:13] pertaining to the pillar of fire that is
[1:35:16] that is returned to this bride to put
[1:35:18] the move of God into action those
[1:35:21] scriptures would be endless I got to
[1:35:24] thinking about that Josh amen where did
[1:35:26] I hear that word endless oh that's right
[1:35:29] it was in Hebrews chapter 7 when he was
[1:35:31] speaking about MDC and he said he would
[1:35:33] have the power of an endless life and
[1:35:36] then later the prophet of God said that
[1:35:38] MDC became Jesus Christ and he returns

[1:40:14] Ghost listen folks he said this he said
[1:40:17] leave that up there for me he says and I
[1:40:20] believe as I am led to believe he said
[1:40:23] that is if the picture of the Angel of
[1:40:26] the Lord who comes and does it
[1:40:28] Discerning brother Merl struck my heart
[1:40:30] one day we have been led to believe what
[1:40:34] we
[1:40:36] believe church we have been
[1:40:39] LED Benji we have been led to believe
[1:40:43] what we have believed you say led to
[1:40:45] believe that's a phrase yes it is you
[1:40:47] know what it means it means to be
[1:40:49] influenced to a certain belief because
[1:40:52] of something seen
[1:40:53] something heard or something read you
[1:40:56] say preacher all you do is look at them
[1:40:59] pictures all you do is read them books
[1:41:01] all you do is hear them tapes you are
[1:41:03] exactly right because as a minister of
[1:41:06] God I'm leading the people to believe
[1:41:08] something I'm not leading you to believe
[1:41:10] me I'm not leading you to believe Josh
[1:41:12] Martin or any other preacher I have been
[1:41:14] called and ordained of God to lead you
[1:41:17] to believe that the god of the
[1:41:20] impossible has returned to the church by
[1:41:23] the message of the
[1:41:27] hour I'm sorry I'm getting long here but
[1:41:29] you give me some Grace I got to digging
[1:41:31] brother Merl I got to digging around in
[1:41:33] that led to believe phrase you know what
[1:41:34] I found I found out that when somebody
[1:41:37] says they're led to believe it's usually
[1:41:40] because of a
[1:41:42] conversation you know when I found the
[1:41:44] prophet said in 1953 in expectancy he
[1:41:47] said don't try to push yourself just
[1:41:49] simply believe are y'all ready for this
[1:41:52] and what he tells me I'll tell
[1:41:55] you woo Glory what he tells me I'll tell
[1:42:00] you 1959 speak to this mountain when he
[1:42:03] stands before me in that light that you
[1:42:05] see on that picture and reveals it every
[1:42:08] time is perfect with the scripture
[1:42:10] through and through that's the reason I
[1:42:12] know it's the angel of the Lord because
[1:42:15] he Bears record of his word and if that
[1:42:18] angel told me one thing that wasn't
[1:42:20] scriptural I would not believe him it
[1:42:22] has to be with the word first because
[1:42:25] God's word is eternal an angel could
[1:42:28] come and preach something else Paul said
[1:42:30] that and it wasn't right but if it's the
[1:42:32] word of God then the angel of God will
[1:42:34] verify that word every time to be the
[1:42:37] truth if it's a true angel from the Lord
[1:42:40] if it's something off color then don't
[1:42:42] you listen to it if it's something off
[1:42:45] color then don't you listen to it but if
[1:42:48] an angel comes and speaks and says
[1:42:51] exactly what the word says then that
[1:42:53] angel is from
[1:42:56] God can y'all give me that second
[1:42:59] picture oh there it is may say y'all
[1:43:03] believe some funny things no we don't I
[1:43:06] told you it's in the scripture do you
[1:43:08] see what I
[1:43:09] see I was out in Arizona the day and I I
[1:43:12] I was in a hurry and I was preaching
[1:43:13] along these lines and I didn't have this
[1:43:15] file of pictures with me so I just went
[1:43:17] on the internet real quick and I grabbed
[1:43:19] one and I mailed it over to brother Doug
[1:43:21] emailed it to him I said here here it is
[1:43:23] and brother Kobe I got to looking at it
[1:43:24] after I sent it to him and I said
[1:43:26] something's missing in that picture I
[1:43:28] said something's missing in that picture
[1:43:30] and I got to look him and then I looked
[1:43:32] at the website God forgive me I looked
[1:43:34] at the website that I actually pulled it
[1:43:36] from and I just Googled the picture real
[1:43:38] quick and the website I pulled it from
[1:43:40] it was it was oh God God forbid it was
[1:43:43] believe the sign I said well them bunch
[1:43:46] of devils and a bunch of reprobates I
[1:43:49] said there's something missing that
[1:43:51] picture so I went over there amen voice
[1:43:53] of God website and I found the original
[1:43:55] picture you know what I found missing I
[1:43:57] found the fact that there was a bunch of
[1:43:59] fishermen in a boat behind the prophet
[1:44:02] on the Ohio River them bunch of
[1:44:03] reprobates want to say what we believe
[1:44:06] has been hashed out of some corner
[1:44:07] somewhere and we're a bunch of Kool-Aid
[1:44:09] Drinkers and a bunch of Fanatics listen
[1:44:11] God even made a bunch of fishermen on
[1:44:13] the boat amen witness his dissension in
[1:44:16] the form of the pillar of fire to

[1:46:45] this message always listen I had

[1:47:02] atmosphere and somebody will see God

[1:47:31] platform
[1:47:33] hallelu folks we're not
[1:47:36] crazy a prophet had a
[1:47:39] conversation can you give me that last
[1:47:44] picture man sitting right present now

[1:47:49] seven angels come down from God visibly
[1:47:52] standing right there
[1:47:53] and told me about the end time and these
[1:47:55] Revelations and the things of the Book
[1:47:57] of Revelation the Seven Seals and said
[1:48:00] return home and one by one will bring
[1:48:03] the message 1963 absolute there stood
[1:48:06] Seven Angels standing right there
[1:48:08] commission me to go back and bring these
[1:48:10] messages and said one by one they would
[1:48:12] meet and tell what

[1:48:21] Brothers you know you preached before
[1:48:22] you you know what I'm talking about you
[1:48:24] tell people I got to go study yeah I got
[1:48:27] to go get my
[1:48:29] study can you imagine a prophet going to
[1:48:31] a study for seven
[1:48:33] days and there was a calendar
[1:48:37] appointment with the angel of the
[1:48:42] Lord you say you're crazy am I really
[1:48:46] and it did exactly that way and when
[1:48:47] they ascended up on high like that went
[1:48:49] 30 miles high and on the same day they
[1:48:51] took the picture of it science did and
[1:48:52] went around the world it's a paradox but
[1:48:56] it's an
[1:48:57] absolute listen to this it's tied me
[1:49:00] tighter into Jesus Christ come on
[1:49:04] winding my life into
[1:49:07] him folks this is not the cunningly
[1:49:11] devised
[1:49:13] fables this message is a supernatural
[1:49:16] Vindicated
[1:49:18] conversation between a prophet and the
[1:49:21] angel
[1:49:22] he said I almost come out and made the
[1:49:24] greatest mistake today he said I almost
[1:49:26] made the Antichrist Christ again brother
[1:49:30] merley said but he come in the
[1:49:32] room and he told me that that white
[1:49:34] horse rider was the Antichrist he stands
[1:49:37] there on the first Hill and he says I
[1:49:39] don't know what the second till is so he
[1:49:41] went back in the room and he had another
[1:49:43] conversation with the angel and he come
[1:49:45] out and he said here's what that second
[1:49:46] horse rider is he went back in the room
[1:49:48] come out here's that third here's that
[1:49:50] fourth went back in the room said here's
[1:49:52] that fth seal it's them Souls Of Martyrs
[1:49:54] under the altar went back in his room
[1:49:56] come back out from a conversation with
[1:49:58] the angel and said there's that sick
[1:49:59] seal it's the tribulation seal somebody
[1:50:02] say well you ever studied it you study
[1:50:03] the six seal I'll tell you what's
[1:50:05] powerful about it okay what's powerful
[1:50:07] about it is not what you find in it it's
[1:50:09] what you don't
[1:50:10] find you know what you don't find in it
[1:50:15] yourself it's a tribulation seal folks
[1:50:18] you're going in the
[1:50:21] rapture huj
[1:50:25] w we have had a Vindicated
[1:50:29] conversation
[1:50:30] recorded and I have been led to
[1:50:33] believe that what I say heaven backs
[1:50:37] up somebody said man brother Andrew
[1:50:39] that's some pretty big boldness it is
[1:50:41] because I say what a prophet said on
[1:50:43] tape I've been led to believe
[1:50:45] church that missing limbs will be
[1:50:48] restored I have been led to preach and
[1:50:51] believe that prodical will come
[1:50:53] home I have been led to believe I have
[1:50:57] been led to believe that our loved ones
[1:50:59] will appear someday behind
[1:51:01] us listen it's more than a
[1:51:05] conversation it's more than somebody
[1:51:07] just walking in and
[1:51:08] saying brother Austin you imagine if if
[1:51:11] if if I was if I was really trying to
[1:51:13] persuade you in your life and to do
[1:51:15] something and I was telling you do this
[1:51:16] do this do this do this and you weren't
[1:51:18] listening to me so I I mean I got to
[1:51:21] step it up because I mean you're not
[1:51:22] listening to me so I come over and I
[1:51:24] said I said an angel met me and told me
[1:51:28] to tell
[1:51:30] you oh dear God I've got to believe it
[1:51:33] now he's been talking to Angels you
[1:51:35] ain't got to believe nothing till you
[1:51:36] vindicate it by the
[1:51:39] word but when a prophet tells you
[1:51:41] something he talked to the angel of the
[1:51:42] Lord and it's already Vindicated and you
[1:51:45] can put everything you got on it and you
[1:51:46] won't lose
[1:51:48] nothing what are he saying I'm saying

[1:52:05] starts telling Charlie I was out in the
[1:52:07] woods talking to God about St Mark the
[1:52:09] 11th chapter and he said he was talking
[1:52:11] to me and he said we were we were
[1:52:14] fellowshipping on Mark 11 how these
[1:52:15] things could be and he said while we
[1:52:17] were fellowshipping he said he spoke to
[1:52:19] me and said who is it that does the
[1:52:21] speaking he said it's me he said you
[1:52:23] need squirrels speak he said I spoke and
[1:52:26] seven squirrels come into
