to come and and we know that it is not the men but it's the god that they yield themselves to it's the god that they have surrendered to it's the message that they have chose to come underneath the headship of the word for this generation and that's what sets Great Men apart is men who are willing throw their opinions aside and say God sent a message for this day and I want to feed God's bride with the evening time message can you say Amen As we sing that song again I we just want to continue to sing that song we want brother Ben to come and to minister it's it's so good to have he and his

in Jesus name amen amen would you love the Lord this morning my it's hard to even stop singing This is just such a Wonder wonderful atmosphere amen let's turn on our Bibles to Genesis Chapter 18 Genesis 18 and verse [Music] one says and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mammory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou Hast said I pray the Lord would that is blessing to the word you may be seated this morning to bring you greetings from our church and I thank those that come with us thank you for coming and I want to thank brother Wendell for the hospitality M it's been wonderful I they even give us a little uh little snacks to eat in the room and uh wherever that beef jerky came from I want some more of that so whoever's responsible for that we'll just drop that in there isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen we love all of you and our ministering brothers that are here I there's about 12 preachers here maybe more than that that would be better suited for this morning but just trust the Lord will help us today amen I want to speak to you this morning on a visit from Elohim before the change amen amen Abraham was sitting in the door of his tent in the afternoon heat thinking on the goodness of God all right that's what brother Brandon said he was doing he was thinking on the goodness of God and I think we ought to do that sometimes we ought to take the time to stop and thank God for his goodness to say Lord you've been good to me you've helped me through life you've given me a good family Lord I Thank you for my family it wouldn't necessarily have to be this way but but you helped me with my family and I'm thankful that you gave me a good wife and I'm thankful that you gave me good children I'm thankful that you helped me in this way thankful for my family maybe he sat there and he thought Lord I'm thankful for Sarah we haven't always agreed and sometimes we did things that were wrong but I'm thankful she stuck with me all of these years and all these years we believe for the promise and maybe she hadn't had my revelation but but she stuck with me through the time and I'm thankful for that he sat there and he said I'm thankful maybe you thank God for the tree that he was sitting there under that had grown up and he said Lord I didn't plant this tree but you planted this tree and maybe like the church that we go to you know it's easy to get negative about the church and it's easy to begin to look at it and see some leaves falling and say well maybe it's done maybe it's dying but Abraham said there's the Lord I Thank you for providing providing me a place of shelter I thank you for providing me a place where I can go and worship I I don't know about you but I'm thankful for this tree here today I'm thankful for a church in Pony Oklahoma where we can go and and hear the word of the Lord and where we can have meetings like this and we don't have to worry about some wet blanket putting out the fire but we can we can trust that God can meet us here in Pony Oklahoma I'm thankful to have a tree that we can sit under how about you what about your local church are you thankful to have a place you can go you don't have to look and say well that tree over there is bigger or that one's got more of this or that but you can say Lord I Thank you for my tree oh I thank you that that I go to the best Church in the country and I got the best pastor that there is and I'm just so thankful Lord and then God begins to appear to you when you begin to think about his goodness it's easy to be critical but when we begin to think about his goodness things begin to change change Hallelujah Abraham taught us that sheep huddled together In the Heat of the day Abraham was sitting there in the heat of the day and sheep don't separate In the Heat of the day he said they huddle together Oh my he said well when I huddle together I get hot that's cuz you got too many of your rights left on you if you get your right shaved off of you maybe you you'd be a little more cool and you could huddle with the other sheep standing each other's shade oh my help me Lord we should be grateful for one another don't take it for granted that you got people to fellowship with not everybody does don't take it for granted you got a church to go to not everybody does don't take it for granted that you got the strength and the health to get up on Sunday morning and go to the house of God he said well the pews beside me are empty well maybe maybe if you just begin to appreciate they'd begin to fill up and people would begin to come because of your thankfulness and your grateful heart oh my does the Lord meet you there that's what's important I believe he meets us here I believe he's met us here this morning amen listen his mistakes Abraham had made many mistakes and maybe he was sitting there thinking and Lord I've made many mistakes brother brandom says he was fall of mistakes and yet he said you didn't count one of them to me and I'm sitting here realizing that yeah I made mistakes and I lied and and I did things but every time you brought me out Lord you gave me an unconditional Covenant and every one of us could be grateful for that this morning you gave me an unconditional Covenant you didn't leave me in my misery you didn't leave me just out here in the world somewhere but you gave me a covenant that did not depend on My Success it did not depend on how much money I had in the bank it did not depend on how loud I shouted it did not on how good I was but you said I chose you before the foundation of the world you belong to me oh we ought to be thankful for that today we ought to be thankful for that kind of a covenant it's unconditional hallelujah amen how he said I'm thankful Lord I Thank I'm thankful when God wrote Abraham's obituary in Romans 4 he said he staggered not at the promises of God but was strong in faith other words he did not wave in the midst of a mind battle but he was strong in other words grew stronger in faith and the more the older he got the farther the promised Got Away scientifically the closer Abraham got to God and the more he believed amen hallelujah he said I'm he I don't care what the rest of them do I'm going to serve you Lord I'll be sitting under this tree somehow we're going to have a child we we don't know how somehow it's going to happen I'm sitting under my tree and I'm just going to enjoy your presence or no matter what the rest of them does me and my house will serve God and brother Bram says it this way he said if the rest of them says there's nothing to the experience it's a bunch of excitement for me in my house we'll serve God you said well if we didn't have those wet blankets sitting beside us we could worship better ask for me in my house I'm to worship God no matter where I'm at come on Church they said there's nothing to it he said oh they be tattlers coming the church though they be Twisters oh I just love them Twisters that come in the church and everything the pastor says they got to take it out of context you know Twisters come tornadoes you know come in the church and start to tear things up he said oh there'd be all kinds of false prophets you know that someone said I've Been Everywhere man I seen everything man some of y'all been around for a while you've seen everything you you you've seen some you've seen some false prophets but you're here this morning as brother Sean said you're here today why because you know that there's a God in this message there's something real hallelujah amen we don't care if there how many false prophets come and everything come to the church amongst the people in the neighborhood and everything but for me and my house will serve the Lord he said though all of them quit coming y right though the church gets cold indifferent for me in my house oh we'd have different kind of services if people would make that make that determination in their soul as for me in my house what about a young people as for me I'm going to serve the Lord as for me I'm going to worship God I don't care what the rest of them does if we're having a tight service I'll be the one that breaks it open if we're having a hard day maybe the pastors had a rough time that week I'll be the one that PS the hardest why as for me in my house will'll serve the Lord glory to God as for me in my house amen we'll serve God I'll serve you anyway Lord Abraham sitting under his tree in the cool of the shade that God had provided for him he said I'm going to serve you with all of my heart Hallelujah God had revealed himself to Abraham in Genesis 17 as the almighty God when he was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to him and said I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and brother Abraham believed God then because he had an approach brother R said he had an approach through a name you and I have an approach through a name he said so have we an approach through a name Jesus that's your approach to God what does Jesus mean to us savior El Shi to Abraham satisfier strong one salvation Giver strength Giver he said the same thing that elai was to Abraham Jesus is to the believer and so else should I become Abraham's approach to God Amen and brother BR said when Christians begin to get that Satan begins to get ready to leave when you realize that your approach is there you can call on the name of Jesus when things are tough you can call on the name of Jesus when when the church isn't going right when the world's not going right when politics aren't going right when your job is is ending or or the finances are drying up you can call on Jesus during that time that's your access to all the riches of God hallelujah amen he said when Christians begin to get that Satan begins to get ready to leave he's finished when people can say I don't care no certain healer has to come by come on church all these people say they don't believe in prayer lines if brother brandham come back they believe in prayer lines that right they just don't believe in the preachers that's the problem but it's not about the preacher it's about Elohim coming down in his body finding himself a body and laying hands on the sick and the Bible says it's about God keeping his word hallelujah hallelujah amen he said no certain thing has to happen only thing I want on Earth is to hear that God said so oh it's that you today there's only one thing I want to hear on Earth and that's that God said so amen he said I he said that settles it with me then I'll take it and go from right there he said then you got it then you got it hallelujah hallelujah Abraham had to have this Revelation so he would recognize the messenger that God sent he taught us that he appeared to Abraham in this name and and while he recognized while he appeared to him in this name Abraham recognized who he was and he changed Abraham's name and brother Brandon said now he's come to the fullness of believing now he's come to the fullness of believing now see where the church has come he said I hope you can read between the lines come up to the place where he's revealed to him who he was and then he changed Abraham's name so that the promise could be fulfilled Church we're not living before these things happen we're not looking oh my for God to appear to us we know he has appeared to us and we're sitting on the other side of that Hallelujah we already have the revelation of who Jesus is amen hallelujah Abraham was pondering those those things and he's sitting there in his tent door in the middle of the day suddenly he looks up there's three men walking in front of him brother brandham gives us a a very interesting detail yeah about those men whenever he tells the story he says they had dust on their clothes you ever notice that so those three men had dust on their clothes he said he kept looking down to them he said now these are strange fellas they're Dusty they traveled far again he said but when the hour of the message came he looked out in the heat of the day and he seen three men coming up dust all over their clothes and Abraham looked again he knew there was just something about it a real Born Again child of God knows the spirit of God when it strikes can you say Amen to that today said my sheep know my voice you see God when he needed a body as but the Sean said but Sean was getting real close to where I was going today God needed a body and he created himself a body out of dust but he didn't just create a body out of dust and then clothe him in Royal robes or or some kind of a Angelic garment or some kind of light where the people would know what it was where the denominations could see what it was and where everybody would recognize it but he came in such a way that only a man of Abraham's caliber of faith would be able to recognize who he was when he came so he come Elohim elai the the alls sufficient God the strength giver come down to visit Abraham and he had dust on his clothes God hiding himself in dust now look brother so when he set him down there though they didn't look any different from any other men because they were dressed dust on their clothes come from some other country probably their feet Dusty and their clothes ragged you realize God created those clothes Dusty on purpose right he could have come any way he wanted to he could have spoke to Abraham in a dream he could have spoke to him in a voice as he had before he could have spoke to him in a pillar of light he could have spoke to him any way he wanted to but he chose to come down in a man with dust on his clothes that looked like he was from another country and he was he was from heaven but he looked like he was from another Earthly country right now he said brother BR said Abraham knew inside there there was something real the spirit declared it why he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere all the time that he could recognize right from wrong all the time listen young people you want to know the difference between right and wrong you say brother Ben I keep making mistakes and I mess up and I don't always do what I should don't you realize you need to get to a place where you begin to recognize right from wrong you you can't just have your dad tell you forever your mom tell you forever your pastor tell you forever you need to recognize right from wrome so the message doesn't just a list of things you do and don't do but it's something that's in your heart how do you recognize right from wrong there's only one way to recognize it and that's to be in his presence to fellowship with him if you fellowship with him you begin to realize right from wrong to recognize the difference because you kept yourself in a spiritual atmosphere you hang out at the pool hall long enough you won't be able to recognize right from wrong on you hang out on Facebook long enough and you won't be able to recognize right from wrong you hang around looking at other people and what they do long enough but don't do that get in a spiritual atmosphere and find out what God said about [Applause] it brother brandom just doesn't make up the idea they've got dust on their clothes we know they had dust on their feet right because what does Abraham say let me wash your feet let me wash your feet why they had dust on their feet they looked like they'd been on a journey and we find that when when God made himself a body as brother Sean said so eloquently in in the womb of Mary when he made himself that body what did he do he come on the earth and he walked as a man and when he did he got dust on his feet and there come a time where one of Abraham's seed had been caught up in prostitution and doing things she shouldn't have been doing and she was she was so far gone it seemed like there was no help for her but when she saw God walking with dust on his feet when she saw that God had made himself a body the Pharisee couldn't recognize it the other people couldn't recognize it but she recognized that God had made himself a body and was right there in front of her so what did she do she didn't stop she didn't let the PE other people quaten her down she said I don't care care what they do I'm going to worship God and she took what God give her brother BR said she didn't have the ability to go and wash his feet but God just used her hair in her tears God used her hair in her tears oh that he would use my tears today to wash his feet that he would use my praise today to wash his feet he still sits here with the desire to be worshiped brother BR said you invited him you called him then worship him when he comes Elohim with dust on his feet sitting in the corner waiting to be worshiped and the only one who recognized it was a prostitute I'm sure some of them looked at her they did and said look at her if he knew who she was but he did know who she was in the moment she took a step towards him Lord Jesus oh God I don't know where you come from this morning I don't know what you've been through I don't know what your past is or what your history is but the moment you take a step towards Jesus he's ready to receive your worship he's ready for you to get down in front of him and wash his feet all that we wouldn't forget how to do that church he came to Abraham not as a Celestial being but as a Dusty traveler he had on clothes like a man he said dust all over him come from a far country but Abraham saw God face to face this wasn't an angel but said it was Elohim dust was on his clothes the the flesh wasn't Elohim he just made himself a body but Elohim lived in that flesh see dust was on his clothes it wasn't extraordinary that dust would be there it was a desert country right if you walk very far you're going to get Dusty what was extraordinary about it is how ordinary it was see God has always come that way see and we find today we're faced with people and I just have to preach like like I can I I wish I could preach like these brothers but but God comes to us in a certain way and and we see people today said prove it or God didn't do it give us evidence so it didn't happen well the evidence in Abraham's case said that they were from a far Earthly country because of the Dust the dust seemed to be proof that they could not have come from Heaven if you looked at it with a critical mind if they had even come and told Abraham and said we come from Heaven which they didn't do he recognized who they were but if they had come and said we come from heaven and had this dust all over him and he was sitting there with a with a critical mind thinking like you you do after you visit some of these websites and you get to look into what people say about it and you begin to criticize everything a prophet said and and you begin to criticize every every miracle and everything say where's the proof of it where was the proof that that was God Abraham didn't wait for proof but he got down and said let me wash your feet let me make you welcome you got dust on your feet but I still believe despite the evidence I still believe hallah I'm going to wash that dust off I'm going to I'm going to clean it up I still believe in a message of the are you today I still believe that it's real I still believe he comes down and dwells Among Us I still believe he is Elohim in flesh [Music] Hallelujah give me evidence where it didn't happen tell that to Abraham sad when that Spirit gets on preachers they did the same thing to Jesus said if you are who you say you are proven God proves his word by bringing it to pass but he don't have to bring it to pass the way you think he's going to bring it to pass all the evidence showed these Dusty Travelers didn't come from Heaven they traveled from somewhere on Earth because dust is evidence of Earth hurt oh my was God hiding himself in the dust in Abraham because of who he was because he was elected by God and God put a faith in him that would believe he calls out and he says my Lord he doesn't say my lord it's like lot did he said my Lord Brother Brandon said watch the effect of the revelation of who God was had upon Abraham what it did to him after his name was changed from Abram to Abraham he seen three men coming and he called the three one my Lord he called the three one my Lord Abraham's vision and Revelation showed him that he was the alls sufficient Elohim and brother Bron said his seed is to receive the same thing he said we're made out of 16 elements petroleum Cosmic light potash and calcium and so forth Just 16 elements he said he just caught it together and and breathed into it walk down in the earth he said I'm so glad he's that sort of Father though the skin worms destroy this body yet he'll call you he promised he'll do it he is Elohim he said in Abraham after the Revelation he seen it he knew there was one God and he seen it he said my Lord come aside sit down let me wash your feet our bodies are literally made from dirt brother Pam taught us that our bodies were on the earth before there was any life here we're made of 16 different elements of the earth and he said that great Jehovah God he said you know what he said he just reached over and got a handful of Adams got a little light amen poured it in like this went a body and just stepped right into it said come here Gabriel that great Archangel went a body and just stepped right into it that's all said come here Gabriel and come here Michael the angel at his side he said you step in that God and two angels walk down in human flesh drink the milk from a cow eat the butter out of the milk eat some cornbread and eat the Flesh of the calf brother BR said when he was done with those bodies he turned them back into dust and they Ste back into that other dimension he said that same one do you believe that same one is here this morning that same one could just reach and grab have a handful of costume and plot and go and there you are again and my name is on his book do you believe that this morning despite the evidence despite the the dust despite everything that's going on do you believe can you believe that Elohim is walking right beside you Elohim is right inside of you can you believe despite the evidence there's dust on his clothes but he's the one so what do I care how stooped my shoulders are getting how old I get certainly not not a bit of worry he'll say children I'm not a runner but I could run all over the place children that's it he said well he has to do this he has to do that and he has to do this look at all the things were fulfilled in the last few hours before Calvary God does what he wants to it's he said children there will be made in his likeness Young Forever old ages passed away aren't you glad for that brother Kenny brother Kenny's a young man I think he's younger than me but old age has passed away sickness troubles Sorrows has vanished oh aren't you glad about that brother B old age has passed away glory be to the Living God see we don't need to get too discouraged by the dust we're looking at the wrong things little dust shakes loose and we get nervous these bodies are just dust we make mistakes we worry when we shouldn't we do all kinds of stuff we shouldn't do not willfully but it's just something about the Dust but but God veiled himself in dust oh my listen when God did in this age when he came down and showed himself in a prophet wave that before us what did he do he he he he come in such a way that the people didn't recognize him yet Jesus said about John he said what went you out for to see a prophet John came with dust on his clothes come out of the Wilderness with camel hair and eating eating wild locust and honey but what did he say what went you out to see what did you go to see a prophet I say to you more than a Prophet this is the Forerunner he went out there and said there's something about that man I've heard that voice before Abraham again he said I know he's got dust all over his clothes he's sitting there rubbing his face brother Bron's face would get numb when he was in under the anointing and he would rub his face and he was saying he here was this Elohim here was God wrapped in flesh sitting there rubbing his face looking around like that but I'm telling you I know that voice cuz it ain't an uncertain sound cuz I heard it 25 years ago and honey we've been trusted all this time to believe you didn't just hear a voice on the tape But You Heard a Voice from Heaven A predestination that spoke to you and it tells me this message is right they can find all the dust they want to find they can sweep it all together and do whatever they want to with it and try to prove all they want to prove I see God moving in my generation glory to [Applause] God I'm slow cuz I have to stop to breathe ain't nothing spiritual about that not pausing for effect I just have to stop to breathe come out here without a jacket cuz I could it didn't fit no more y'all feet a fellow good he said but I'm telling you I know that voice it's not an uncertain sound I heard it 25 years ago he's speaking to Sarah said honey we've been trusted all this time to believe and there's something about that man I don't know why but there's something about him I believe I believe I got to look past the dust on his clothes see him oh my I wonder if we can do that with one another look see I went I was at brother Brand's grave the other day we were in Jeffersonville for a funeral and I walked by his grave and that's what I began to think about the dust and kind of what inspired that and I preached that at home about the Dust on his clothes and I I was walking by there and there was it was it was very dusty it was dry it was dust on the dust on the tomb and drove by the Tabernacle was dust all over the Tabernacle the outside and I thought oh God it just feels so empty it feels like there's just not the excitement that there was when I was a child but when I got to thinking about it I thought God you're still here you're still the same yesterday today and forever that dust may have been put back in the ground but you didn't die in a grave in Jeffersonville but you're the same in Pony Oklahoma at the meetings it doesn't matter what's going on around you he's still the same your favorite preacher may not be here but Elohim is here it may not whole church you may not your friend that wanted to come may not have been able to come but Elohim is here we ought to worship him while he here we ought to give him what he deserves we ought to worship him like we never have before I don't need a thousand people to worship God all I need is Elohim all I need is a revelation to know what he's done for me to thank him for his goodness in my life glory to God hallelujah he's he's still here that same one who use that body to open up the Seven Seals the same one to do signs and wonders that same God who used that body to reveal the secrets of the heart is right here in py Oklahoma this [Applause] morning the brown said friends don't look to me I'm your brother don't pay no attention to me because I'm just a mortal I have to die like everybody else don't you listen to me but listen to what I've said what I said is the message don't pay any attention to the messenger watch the message keep your eyes not on the messenger but on the message what it said that's the thing to look to he said it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on then if we're still feeding on him he's still here you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man you say I've heard that before but have you ever heard it and been able to look past the dust and see what you're doing when you're sitting in the house of God we think way too small I don't believe I believe every service ought to be a Revival we may not be turning over pews and shouting and running but every service ought to be a Revival cuz the Revival is in me the Revival's in you Abraham he said I want you to feel welcome he said so he said I want you to cook you a meal he had a desire to make them welcome he said let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet rest yourselves under the tree and I'll fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you your hearts after that you shall pass on for for therefore are you come to your servant now look at his attitude towards worship it's Lord you came to me for me to bless you that's different is't it you came to me for me to bless you you came to me and God did come to bless Abraham but Abraham's attitude was let me bless you let me wash the dust from your feet and Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal need it cakes upon the Earth fine meal on the earth fine meal was reserved for Kings the best of the best and Abraham ran to the herd he didn't kind of Mosey his way right Abraham become a Pentecostal preacher that morning and ran to the herd and when he got out there he didn't find the old Walmart cow y'all from Oklahoma you know what I'm talking about he didn't find the old one that was barely broken down I remember we had a cow one time that we had to give her a bottle of sugar water before she'd get in the trailer she was down before she got in that trailer and that sugar water kept her up till she went through the ring and she sold and she collapsed on the other side I didn't do that my family did but that's not the kind of cow not the kind of calf that Abraham went looking for he didn't come looking for some old some old halfway religion he didn't come looking for some old meal that had been warmed up and he got off the internet somewhere he didn't go looking down the street for what the other preachers were preaching what was he looking for he was looking for a calf tender and good something that Elohim would be welcome would would want to eat from amen oh that's what I want to give him this morning I want to give him my best give him my all Hallelujah he took butter and milk in the calf what you addressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat he stood there brother brand said with a fly bush kept the Flies off you know church we don't realize what we do when we're in the house of God you matter when you show up come on Church they well it's Wednesday night they won't miss me you matter when you show up cuz somebody's got to stand there chew the flies away somebody's got to do it now as far as we know this was the first time that Elohim ever tasted human food but it wouldn't be his last he come down to the body and said let let's have a meal I like a god like that we've been having potlucks ever since the Baptist didn't invent the potluck Elohim came down for the first potluck wonder what Abraham will have bet it'll be good because Abraham always gives his best Abraham's got a revelation Hallelujah he was hungry for Fellowship why did it why did God come down why couldn't he just say it why couldn't he just send a letter put on audio recording send it to him he didn't do that what did he do he came down he invited himself to Abraham's house for a meal see my brother B I don't my house is humble I live in a little old Oklahoma Shack or Missouri Shack or Arkansas Shack and I it's so humble I I don't think Elohim would want to eat there you think he'd want he's already invited himself what did he say he said behold I stand at the door and knock he did that to the age and the age left him outside what a pitiful sight to see Jesus standing outside of a Le to see an age they were singing they were dancing they were carrying on they forming denominations they were saying God is still with us but he was outside knocking on the door but there's been a people in this age that accepted his invitation he not only wants to come to you he has come in in this age he said I stand and knock if you hear my voice and open the door I will come in and will'll Su with him and he with me that word Su is the evening meal what Abraham should have been preparing due to the time of day was the afternoon Meal which was a light snack but he didn't give that to Elohim praise God he didn't just give him a few nuts and some some beef jerky that was that's good he didn't just give him that but what did he give him come on church he gave him the evening meal in the middle of the day because the evening meal is the time they would all sit down and they'd have a conversation and that's what Elohim came to do he didn't come just for a drive-thru snack he didn't come to go to McDonald's he didn't come to go to denomination he didn't come to go and hear a little 10cent preacher or somebody can't can't study and doesn't know nothing about God he come to get a meal and I think every time we we go to church we ought to offer it up to God he said if you'll open the door I'll come in and have a full me meal a seven course meal you you guys are wearing me out standing up I like it though before his crucifixion he sat down with his disciples he told him he said I want to have a meal am I taking too long I I'm just brother brother you can get the rest of it later Abraham Lincoln can preach the rest later forgot his name he sat down before his crucifixion he said with desire I have desired I have a brother named Jonathan too that's terrible with desire have I desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer for I say unto you I will not any more eat thereof until I love that that's in there until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God he was so hungry for their Fellowship we don't know if that meal was good or bad we don't know what it tasted like when he sat down with them for that supper but he said I want to eat with you did he want to eat with him it wasn't about the food it was about the fellowship he wanted to talk to him the same day he rose he made himself another body ate dinner with two of them again they didn't recognize him how he came to them however that was Luke 24:28 they Dro DW nigh into the village whether they went he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him remember they had walked with him down 6-hour Journey journey and he'd preached a six hour sermon said and started it like this can you imagine if your pastor walked out he said oh fools it's his first words brother Miguel could see him doing that old fools and slow of heart to believe all that the sometimes we need to be talked to like that don't we all fools and so heart it's like he's trying to wake them up you know shock him a little bit give him a six-hour sermon he gets down to the end of it and they want him to preach longer we're not going to do that today he made as though he would pass on like a just a Dusty traveler but they they constrained him said abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent oh come on Hallelujah he went in to Terry with them for the evening meal but BR said they was talking to him didn't know it so no doubt he said he looked at them sadly wonder how he looks at us today when we're in such a hurry to just get through it oh it's just another meeting I've done my duty I've done I've worked in the kitchen I I've taken care of my children I've watched the young people I I'm I'm half wore out anyway uh maybe if he just go on it'd be best but no he looks at you sadly and he wants to come in he wants to do something for you he wants to show you who he is he wants to give you something that'll that'll be worth all the effort that you put into it well I maybe he just pass on but they constrained him to stay he started to walk on by but he was waiting for them to invite him he said that's what he's waiting tonight for you to invite him notice when those disciples invited him into their Fellowship around the table it was then he done something like he did before his crucifixion their eyes come open he said they knowed his manner his style hallelujah how did they know that they'd fellowship with him before he said they knew what he done he did it then just like he did before and they said that's him and quickly they raised up to scream it out and he vanished they recognized him because they had fellowship with him before the reason we don't recognize him in church many times is because we don't Fellowship much outside of church the reason you sit there like a like a bump on a pickle has been said huh you sit there like that because you you you you've been almost always so listen to me church it's almost always because not because the church is dead you said well if the preacher would preach like he used to if the church was like it used to be no the real problem is because we haven't been fellowshipping like we used to we've not been getting down on our knees and calling out to God like we used to Hallelujah you know what I want to eat with him again you know I know people spiritualize things but I want to sit down across a table and eat with him just let me hold on to that promise you spiritualize something else let me sit down there brother Matthew and eat a meal with Jesus the disciples did like Abraham did I fellowship with him in the word I fellowship with him here in the meeting I fellowship with him at the church I fellowship with him in my closet but one day there's a heart's desire to fellowship with him again after I meet my loved ones after I see them after we have a grand reunion let me fellowship with him face to face said brother Ben how does that work logistically I don't care just want to sit down with him [Applause] brother Brandon said when the bride is called out and elected and set in The Book of Life there will come a sound from Heaven it'll take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride you know the quote it'll take her from the earth in a rapturing Grace he said there is a heaven and there is a literal Jesus Christ that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth God said so how many Believers we got in here today he said that's what Believers believe after Abraham invited him in made him welcome wash the dirt off of him after that meal he's done cheing all the flies away they sit down and begin to talk and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife called her by her princess name brother brand said he said behold in the tent he said' I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now look he had his back literally to the audience he was talking for Sarah's benefit knowing she was there and she could hear him with his back turned to her called her by name this is important because this happened in our day God showed us that oh my this wasn't just a story but he did it in our day in fact the Bible tells us that as brother Sean has already even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed there would be a revealing of the son of man there would be a sign a messiah sign something that would be done that would show us that he was still alive he was still the same yesterday today and forever and in hundreds of places and hundreds of cases at hundreds of times he called out people with prayer cards without prayer cards at the front of the house at the back of the house wherever else they were sitting and he did it over and over and over again what was it not a man we're not elevating a man it was God in flesh Hallelujah and brother R said each night I've been turning my back to the audience that you might know and God to vindicate how he said how many knows that Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man listen to me young people this isn't just stories it really happened you can hear on tape you can watch it on deep call to the Deep you can ask brother Kenny he said just that you might know I'm going to turn my back to the audience he said now remember when I do this don't let me get letters saying brother brandom you called yourself that angel said that's wrong I'm a sinner saved by the grace of Christ no matter what I did no matter how much God anointed me if you wasn't anointed also it wouldn't work it's your faith that does it this is just a gift just to pull a lever back far enough that's the problem isn't it some of us just have a little bit harder time pulling that lever that old lever gets Rusty you got to put some oil of the Holy Ghost on it and pull that lever back he said to let William br him step off the scene so Jesus Christ can work he said now you pull your lever back far enough so you can get off the scene oh how many say I want to do that today let me pull my lever back so that whatever God has placed in my life I can be that I can do that Jesus Christ can work brother brandom in Jehovah Gyra number two and I'm hurrying to close brandom keeps ATT tempting to turn his back to the audience he just he just keeps turning around and in that c if you go listen to it they interrupted him 10 times with with gifts of tongues and things we believe in tongues we believe in interpretation we we believe in Prophecy but it was out of order and they and the way they did it you tell they didn't recognize what God was doing they just didn't see it yeah here God was was trying to show them I'm with you I'm here and they could have all been healed they could have all been delivered but they were sitting there over and over and over again they interrupted yeah he said I'm going to turn my back and here they go finally gets his chance the last one finishes up he turns his back he said there's someone standing before me which sits behind me oh my it's a Woman She's suffering with a heart trouble she has allergies that's bothering her she's just behind me you think that God still knows that about you today he may not have a prophet here that could reveal the secrets of the heart but he still knows that about you and he wants you to believe his word you are healed he said she's also concerned about a loved one her husband sitting from her he's he's paralyzed has a cane the woman's name is Mrs Brumley he's got his back to the audience you know that makes me nervous you ever tried to preach with your back to the audience it's hard enough to preach with your face to the audience but it makes me nervous when I turn around because you can't see how people are reacting but brother Brandon wasn't nervous he knew what God was doing yet is back to the audience Oh my he said now he said believe with all your heart stand up and accept what you prayed for you'll get what you asked for he said now that ain't the same God that was down there just before Sodom I don't know what is that's Elijah right there I hope it strengthens your faith today but that was even that in in the greatness that that was but BR talks about that about the second poll of his ministry you remember the third poll was the opening of the word right and brother brandom taught us that the opening of the word was far greater than the rest of them combined what he thought his new ministry would be would be far greater than the rest of them combined he said he talks about Visions he said now that's God speaking in this day through vision he said but this this if that Vision was contrary to this that would be wrong this is more than the vision that's right if you got your Bible with you hold it up if you got your Bible hold it up you've got something [Music] more than a vision are you with me now more than a vision if I come to you and I told you what your name was and I was exactly right and I saw a vision about you but you got something greater than that what does it tell you you're a child of God you're a Seed of Abraham you belong in the house of God it tells you to assemble yourselves together it tells you you've been healed by his stripes I've been healed oh church do you realize that all that we have come cuz God there was an open Vision on the earth there was an open Vision but if God could do that through an open Vision how much more could he do through an open book Glory if the book was greater than the vision look what he did with an open Vision through a prophet how much more can you do through an open book in your life and you can stand and accept it today I'm Healed I've been [Applause] delivered glory to God he showed us he was here to do it we just got to believe it this message isn't buried in Jeffersonville I don't know may be my last time ever preached to you I don't know none of us know look at this the Bible tells if any man shall say to you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not other words here's an anointing there's the anointed word it's not here or there it's in you believe it not he say well looking over and see well I'm just preaching to you this morning it's my heart say well that other tree looks really good but you don't know if it's rotten on the inside you've been around your tree long enough you know on the inside it might have all kinds of little WPS and things on it but it's alive are you with me now the anointed word is not here or there it come through a prophet and it came to you behold I send to you Elijah the prophet he said and in the last days it shall come to pass behold I sent to you Elijah the prophet he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and in there there would come a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through come on Church through his church he didn't say just through a prophet through his church have the preeminence is in this church this church this morning our church my church your church the bride Church the anointed man now the an anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom where is the anointed word it's right here in Pony Oklahoma not the anointed not the anointed building not the anointed preacher but the anointed bride and bridegroom that's why you can worship that's why you can raise your hand that's why you can shout that's why you can receive your healing that's why you can believe the anointed word is here the anointed bride is here [Music] hallelujah the anointed people [Applause] he goes on to say they were anointed by accepting what 've turned down glory to God what do we need to do brother B to be anointed we need to preach the word believe the word live the word the Sean I think quoted this from memory last night he said the bridegroom call will come right through this the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man he goes on to say we're married here we go to the wedding supper he said when the word here unites with the person and they two become one then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church become one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing God could only reveal himself in a prophet in a prophetic form now he reveals himself in a bride in a Min membered bride I don't need God to come back and ever do that again well random tells us one time was enough they should have believed when they saw it once and yet God was gracious to his merciful he sent angels of Mercy aren't you glad he did angels of Mercy to Abraham and he come down over and over and over again but I want him to reveal himself in my life reveal him that's why I don't want to be more than what I am I may never be a great preacher but Lord if you can reveal yourself to me through me to my church Lord would you do that let let me not be benr it anymore let it be the son of man this message revealed in me oh would you say Amen to that today let it be the son of man revealed in Factory workers and and teachers and Housewives brother Brandon said Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight is still God manifest himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known he said God come down here in his church making himself again the word the son of man being revealed in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom I'm closing with this he said I challenge you to believe we're going to accept the challenge some of you boys if somebody challenged you to a wrestling match you'd accept it I wouldn't because I'd get my leg broke although size is an advantage somebody challenge you to a hot dog eating contest you'd take it somebody challenged you to whatever it is they want to challenge you you'd be up for the the challenge but what did the prophet of God said I challenge you to believe that's the challenge this morning do you believe whether you believe or not will reflect in your life it'll reflect in your everyday life it'll reflect in your church life it'll reflect when you go to the house of God it'll reflect on your face when you listen to the preaching it'll reflect to the to your pastor and how you quit criticizing and how you you start encouraging the work it'll reflect in what you do it'll be that let me be the son of man to my church to my area I realize the most important thing that I am is to be to be the person God called me to be not even just to be a pastor but to be Ben prit that God had his name my name on his book before the foundation of the earth that he would manifest himself my life and Colby Martin's life and his other brothers life these other sisters lives you don't need a new church Church a new pastor come on Church a new tape you need to believe what you got you need to believe that Jesus Christ who is Elohim himself is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh through your body Hallelujah musicians would you come would you make him welcome with your music I believe he's here this he's been here since the start of the service I just want you to make him welcome in your own way can we just do that I the altar is open if you need to pray I still believe in an altar if I was a young person I was struggling with something I believe I'd be at the altar crying out to God God God I want to be clean I want to be right if I was an older person got cold and crusty and indifferent believe I'd be at the altar ready to receive something from God but but you know this place doesn't mean anything only surrender sometimes we have to surrender ourselves and come here because that's what God wants us to do but God can speak to you right there in your seat and I just want you to make him welcome would you do that would you close your eyes and just talk to him I want you to do that
