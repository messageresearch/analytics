And I turned to see the voice that spake with me, and being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks. And I'm just going to take that scripture today, and and I'm going to title it the right perspective. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we thank you for what we have felt here in our midst here today. We're so thankful for what you're doing in Shorty's life, Lord. And how that you have you have brought him back from his deathbed, Lord, and he's waiting on his family. And we just say, Lord, thank you. Thank you for hearing our prayer. And Lord, we're just believing that you are going to complete that prayer by drawing him close to you and giving him a a personal experience with you, Father. Oh God, we believe that you still save our souls that you can redeem us, Lord, Lord, from from death and Lord, you can redeem us from hell. you can redeem us, Lord, for may he be a great testimony to this community and all those that know him. Father, we thank you for it. Now, Lord, we just ask that you would be with us as we minister your word this morning and ask for your anointing to be upon us all in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated. would like to also uh say that it's just been such a a blessing to see u our our sister April and her family make it back home. And uh Amen. Good to good to see uh them here this morning. And and we always miss we miss everyone when you're gone. You know, a small church uh you you notice when when people are gone. And so we are we're just excited uh to be a part of the family knowing that here before long we're going home and we'll never we'll never part. We'll we'll always uh be together. Uh and I I am looking forward to that day. I I want to minister here this morning as I read the scripture to you and I turned to see the Apostle John was looking in one direction but he heard a voice from behind him. Amen. And the Bible says he turned around to see the voice that was speaking to him. &gt;&gt; And I believe the right perspective in anything that we Amen. uh in our walk with God especially. Amen. Having the right perspective of God's word. I think the right perspective in in relationships, having the right perspective in Amen. being able to see things as they truly are. And I I I believe that God wants us in this day. He wants us to see things. Amen. The way that he sees things. Amen. And the only way that we're going to seem anything like Christ, amen, is to walk by faith. You can't walk with God according to sight or according to the way the mama taught us or daddy taught us or amen uh um or tradition. But but God wants to wants us to see him according to the supernatural uh element. Amen. Sunday school lessons are wonderful. Amen. Um, tradition is wonderful, but God wants a personal revelation, a personal walk with every one of us. &gt;&gt; And the prophet would say Jesus Christ is by faith. Not what you can scientifically prove. Not what you believe, but what you believe. I can't scientifically prove to you tonight in this building that there is a God, but yet I know he's here. But by my faith, my faith vindicates it. Abraham could not scientifically prove to you that he was going to have a baby to that woman. And her nearly a hundred years old, but his faith confirmed it. &gt;&gt; Didn't need any scientific proof why the doctor would would say the the old man is crazy out here. He's going to have a baby by that woman. Him a hundred years old and her 90. But you see, God said so. So it don't take science. It takes faith to believe God's word, not science. Amen. He says, "God said so." That settles it. God said so. No matter how ridiculous it sounds, if God said so, it's all right. Amen. God makes it ridiculous. All faith is ridiculous to the unbeliever. But faith is only real to God and to the one who has it. Unbelief does not stop God. Someone shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says it don't bother God's plans. It doesn't bother God's word. It doesn't hurt it. It don't ruin them. It only ruins the one in unbelief. It'll ruin the unbeliever but not God. So, I want today I want to have the right perspective. I want to be able to look at God's word and I and I want to say, God, I want your word to be real in my life today. If God wrote something in his Bible, he he wrote it for a reason. He got He has got some sons and daughters here on the earth that is going to look at his word, accept his word, and walk in the realities of that word. And remember, God is not a a a a human. He's not finite like you are, like I am. He has no tomorrows. He has no yesterdays. God lives in eternity. God knows what he wants done in your life. And his plan never changes. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the devil brings. It doesn't matter what circumstances say. What matters is is God knows what he wants in you and he's looking for someone to believe him in faith. Amen. Perception of of the thing that you're looking at. I I I think of Jesus that Amen. asked the man who had been healed if he could see and and Jesus had touched his eyes and he and he said, you know, Amen. I see men as trees. A and and and Jesus didn't look at him and say, "Well, amen. That's that that's better than what you had. You were blind before. Amen. No. Jesus touched him again. And the Bible says that he could see every man clearly. Amen. So, you know what that tells me is God's not wanting you to have a little bit of eyesight. God wants you to have divine revelation. He wants the the expectation of your heart to be everything like God has given in the promise. Amen. For our eternal destination is not altogether determined on what we see or what we hear, but it is determined upon what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear. Amen. The Apostle Paul to the to the Corinthian church, he Amen. He when he was talking to them about communion and getting on to them and and and and you know that Amen. there in in in the scripture there in uh 1 Corinthians 11. Uh he was he he was really getting on to the church and and and and and what they were doing around the communion table. And you see he was not disputing communion. Amen. But he was their act was right. Amen. But their perspective, their discernment was wrong. He says you're not discerning the Lord's body. Amen. coming together and having communion is right, but the way that you are doing it is wrong. Can you say amen? So, they were coming in, but they were doing it half-heartedly. They were eating and drinking irreverently and Amen. but they were not discerning the Lord's body. So, God wants the right perspective coming from every one of us. Amen. So, today in our walk with God, I want you to look at your perspective here this morning. God, give me the perspective, the right perspective, the perspective of faith that'll believe your word over every other word. It'll believe your word over my opinion. It'll believe your word over anything else that would come my way. Well, can you say amen? Amen. Look there at a at Philip. Amen. As he asked the unic, you know, as as he came walking up to the unic and said, "Do do you know what you read?" and and and the unic looked at him and said, "H, how can Amen. I I I I know except someone shows me." Amen. As he was looking there at as he was led to a, you know, talking about Jesus being led as a sheep to the to the slaughter and as a lamb dumb before the shears and his humiliation. And he says, is he's talking about a a prophet or is he talking about himself? Is he talking about someone else? But then here comes this this great uh huh uh Philillip the amen who was actually a deacon and he and and and he be to expound on him. Amen. The law of Christ and and and the plan of redemption through Jesus Christ and and the Bible says his eyes become open his clear his understanding become clear and he was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So there is a perspective that God is looking for here this morning. If you're going to be an overcomer, it's going to require the right perspective. Amen. If you're going to be healed of your sickness, it's going to require the right perspective. If if we're going to be anything that God has called us to be, then there's going to require somebody that is going to reach out in faith and believe the word of God. Amen. How many believes God's word is has made it very clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. God's word. You never want to mix God's word with other things. You've got to be God's word and God's word alone. For by faith are we saved. Amen. What is faith? It is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you. And we accept by God's grace that divine revelation. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. I say this morning, it matters what you look at. I I I look there at I I think about the uh the Israelites as they had Amen. They had sinned against God. And Amen. Their faith hasn't wasn't wasn't anchored the way it should be. And Amen. they were they were faced with a great epidemic of doubt. And amen, literally thousands had been affected by it. And amen, they were being bitten by snakes. Amen. serpents had come in and amen because they were saying to God, amen to Moses, you just brought us out of Egypt here to die. And God is not able to keep us and to take us into the promised land. And the Bible says there were serpents, amen, fiery serpents coming in. And thousands and thousands and thousands were dying. And God told Moses, he says, "Quickly, Amen, make a a a brazen serpent." And and I want you to set it up there for for the people to look at. And as they look at that, they will live. And they had to take their eyes off of the fiery serpents. They had to take their eyes off of that which was causing them displeasure and death. And they had to get their eyes upon the atonement that God had given them. And if they looked at that serpent, the Bible says, amen, that they lived and the plague was stayed. Well, can you say amen? Amen. What was that brazen serpent? Well, it's Amen. It was it was it was a brass represents judgment. Amen. It represented Christ who was going to be lifted up as the death penalty for all mankind. And as Christ was lifted up and all of the sin of the world was put on Jesus and you can look at Jesus and you can live here this morning, you can look at Jesus and you can be healed this morning. You can look at Jesus and he will be the satisfactor of your life. Well, praise the name of the Lord. I I say it matters what you look at here this morning. Amen. If you're coming to church just just to come to church, Amen. I'm afraid you're looking at the wrong thing. Amen. If you're coming for the music, you're looking at the wrong thing. If you're coming for your favorite preacher, you're looking at the wrong thing. But if you ever get a view of Jesus Christ, it'll change your life. It'll change your world. It'll be to you, Amen. what God desires to be to you. You've got to look at the right thing. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen to the believer. It is God's word alone. Amen. Somebody say, "It's God's word &gt;&gt; or nothing." &gt;&gt; His word is very clear as to who he is. His word is very clear as to what Christ has come to provide. His word is very clear as to what he expects from you. And you can't mix dogma and creed with it. Amen. You can't serve Jesus and mammon. You can't serve Jesus and the world. You can't walk. Amen. If the Bible says, "How can two walk together except they agree?" Amen. You have got to turn your eyes to Jesus Christ and away from the things of the world. Amen. Now, I know today there's a lot of mixing. Amen. There's a lot of mixing together. Amen. Well, I'm a Christian, but I'm also Amen. going to h I've got my own way of living. I want to tell you, there's only one way, friend, and that's the Bible way. Amen. That's the only way is the Bible way. Well, you say, "But I believe in Jesus. Jesus came the Bible way." Amen. Well, I I I don't know about this, and I Well, I love Jesus with all of my heart. Amen. But you know, I've got my own opinions, too. I just want to tell you this morning, there's only one way, and that is God's way, and he has provided it in the Bible. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't mix your church traditions with Jesus. Well, hallelujah. Amen. Well, Amen. I believe if I go to church and I I just believe if I pay my tithes and Amen. Oh, that's all wonderful. Amen. But that will never get you to heaven. Coming to church will never get you to heaven. Paying your tithes will never get you to heaven. It'll never bring you victory. But if you ever come in contact with Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ will save your soul. &gt;&gt; And then, brother, you we can't keep you out of church then. And then we can't keep you from the Bible then because once you meet Jesus Christ, he changes your perspective. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. You got You can't You can't You can't mix them. You can't mix them. Hallelujah. Well, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to smoke my cigarettes and Amen. I'm going to smoke my marijuana and still serve Jesus. Amen. That's not what the Bible says. Amen. So that's the wrong perspective and that won't get you to heaven. Well, I I I I believe that I can handle it this way and God knows my heart. Yes, he knows your heart is an evil heart of unbelief that is keeping you from seeing the promises of God. But if you can say, God, here I am, and I'm going to bow myself, amen, down before the the throne of Jesus Christ, and I'm going to call you, Lord. Your word will be my command and I will follow you and you will find that there is victory. How many wants victory here this morning? Amen. I'm talking about joy unspeakable and full of glory. I'm talking about the presence of God and the angels of God and the glory of God living with you and abiding in you because you have set your heart upon him and him alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now Jesus said you make there Mark 7:13 you make the word of God of none effect through your traditions which you have delivered and many such things you do. You you you've made traditions and you've made the word of God of none effect because your perspective isn't well well well but but but but but remember God has no wells and buds. God has his word and we believe his word. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Victory comes from his word. Amen. They're there in Mark 7 and one. Let's let's look at one of the traditions here. And they come together unto him, the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, and which come from Jerusalem. And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defi, uh, defiled with defiled, that is to say, with unwashing hands, they found fault. For the Pharisees and all the Jews, except they wash and they eat not. Many other things there be which they have received to hold. Amen. washing of cups and pots and brazen vessels and of tables. And then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders? But eat bread with unwashed hands?" And he answered and said unto them, Whale hath Isaiah prophesied, you hypocrites, as as it is written, the people honorth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. So tradition can keep you from the realities of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now come on church. The church is not a tradition. Amen. that rel Christianity is not a tradition. Christianity is a lifechanging experience with Jesus Christ. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. He says, "How be it?" He says in vain they do worship teaching uh uh for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandment of God. You hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things like ye do. Amen. But he said unto them for well you reject the commandment of God that ye may keep your own tradition. Now I want to say here today, amen. There should be a perspective. Amen. The right perspective of Christ. What is why did Christ come? Christ come to redeem us. Amen. What is to redeem? That means to come. Amen. When you're we when you've when you've taken something to the pawn shop. Hallelujah. Amen. And there there's been a I I remember Amen. There was there was a time where my Amen. I had some tools stolen and Amen. my my ladders were stolen and Amen. And so I go back I I one day I I I you know I thought well I'll find them somewhere in a pawn shop somewhere, you know. Amen. And and I and I go to a pawn shop and Amen. And I and I had a special place that I kept I kept my name and Amen. where I could find. And so Amen. I I turned the ladder around to where Amen. And there it was. Martin Electric. Hallelujah. Amen. Now you see Amen. that that was mine at the beginning. Somebody stole that thing from me. Amen. And it ended up in the pawn shop. But you see, in order to redeem it, I had to be willing to go back. Hallelujah. Pay the price to get my ladder. Well, glory to God. You know what that means? It was twice mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And you were a son of God. You were a daughter of God. God did not come to save you in your sin. He came to save you from your sin. There's a difference. He is not leaving you in your sin. He's not leaving you in the pawn shop. He's not leaving you in shackles. Amen. But God come to satisfy his soul. and his soul desired you to be by his side. Free from sin, free from addiction, free from the elements of this world. He wants you back. Well, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To redeem back, &gt;&gt; redemption, &gt;&gt; the right perspective &gt;&gt; to redeem back. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. Some of you serving the Lord, the devil's trying to tell you, "Amen. Oh, you've sinned too far. Amen. Oh, God's going to leave you now. You've you've fallen for the last count. I want to tell you, God's grace is right there saying, "I've called you and I'll not lose you." Oh, Satan's tried to destroy you. Satan's tried his hardest, amen, to destroy your life. He's done it all his, amen, all the days of your life, he's tried to keep you from salvation. But I'm here to tell you, his works are not big enough. Satan is not strong enough. The devil is not big enough to stop God's plan in your life. That's the perspective we should have. &gt;&gt; Perspective. &gt;&gt; Perspective was well, Amen. The perspective that says God wants to send you to hell and he's just waiting for you to fall. Amen. That way he can make a grief spot out of you. &gt;&gt; That's not God's perspective. &gt;&gt; God's perspective is to take you back home with him. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God's not halfway. Praise the Lord. Man, you see, we run every stop sign and we run every barrier and we run, but it's not God's intention to send anyone to hell. Matters of fact, God sends no one to hell. &gt;&gt; But a person with a wrong perspective will run every stop sign. It'll run over God's word over and over and over. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God's word is here for you and me. It's a love letter. Somebody say, "It's a love letter &gt;&gt; to me and you." Now the Apostle Paul, he was talking to the the churches there in Galatia and he had a burden on his mind because they had started out in mind in the gospel and and throughout throughout the book of Galatians you you will hear the Apostle Paul and and you know was he he he would say uh that they're in they're in uh Galatians 1 and6. I marvel that you were so soon removed from him him Christ that called you into the grace of God and to another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than what we have uh preached unto you, let him be accursed. And as we said before, now so say I again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you, than ye have received, let him be accursed. For do I now persuade men or God? Do I seek to please men? For if I if I yet please men, I should not be the servant of Christ. He goes to the third verse, third chapter and he says, "Oh foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ have been evidently set forth crucified among you?" He He's saying he says, "W did how did you learn of any of this? Receive ye the spirit uh by the works of the law or the hearing of faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun in the spirit? Are you now made perfect in the flesh? Have you suffered so many things in vain and yet it be in vain? Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And then Paul would begin to illustrate. He says, "At one time the religion of my nation, my people, my that the traditions of of my people were so strong in my life. &gt;&gt; I'd followed these traditions." Amen. And he says, "I was I was head and shoulders above them all." Amen. The traditions of the elders, and I I was a spiritual man among them. Amen. There in the book of Philippians, he begins to he begins to talk where he stood. Amen. Wii with those and and and and then Amen. I he he would just bring there in the third uh Philippians 3:7 it says but what things were gained to me those things I count loss for Christ yay doubtless I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and what he was saying was all of the position that I had in my among my people. When I got the perspective of Christ and when I seen what he was trying to lead me to, &gt;&gt; when that light appeared to me on that road to Damascus, I found something greater than all of the traditions and the religious element of my people. Hallelujah. Amen. all of the all of the uh uh ceremonies and all of the deals of the Jewish people. He said, "I was there. I was at the top. I was at the very top. I was there. &gt;&gt; But when I met Christ, my perspective changed. I seen that God was not trying to make me a a religious person. He was trying to redeem me. And I am willing to go to death. I am I am in prison while writing this letter to you, oh Philippians. He says, I'm in prison for this cause, but I count it all joy. I count it all joy for the man or the Christ that I met has changed my life. And I want to say today, I count it all joy for the Christ that I have met is not religion. It's not another name on a book. But I have found a reality. I don't need the things of the world. I don't need the religion anymore. Amen. I am willing to set aside all the tradition. And I want to walk with the living God. Well, can you say amen? Amen. He satisfies my heart. Amen. With singing. He satisfies my heart with joy. He Oh, can you say amen? What is it? It is the realities of Jesus Christ in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is for Sister Joy. It is joy unspeakable &gt;&gt; and full of glory. Hallelujah. Amen. Sister Joy gets to get preached about every time she comes to church or goes to church. Joy unspeakable, full of glory. And the half has never yet been told. Well, can you say amen? I want to say amen. Our name should be joy. Our name should be peace. Our name should be full of happiness. Why? Because we have found a reality in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's word has told us that God would bring a covenant through the blood. It was always a covenant around that blood. Atonement means to cover over to make reconciliation. To atone for one, amen, is to pacify or to satisfy the verdict of the judge of a judge. &gt;&gt; It is to atone for by legal rights. So when we say that Christ his blood atoned for our sins, it is saying that this one was accepted by the judge that the penalty would be forever more &gt;&gt; paid &gt;&gt; and there would be reconciling. No longer in the prison house, no longer under condemnation, but Christ has atoned. He has redeemed. He has brought us back into right standing with God. Brother, that should be your perspective here this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This kind of thought, well, I don't know. I'm just not worthy. That's the wrong perspective. Christ came that I could be righteous. &gt;&gt; I refuse to accept religion. I refuse to accept tradition. I refuse to accept anything that I cannot verify and validate in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. And neither should you. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, Amen. In this especially in this last days, the call for this last day was come out from among them and be ye separate. Who are they talk? Who's he talking about? He was talking about that apostate church who was following after the traditions of of of the Old Testament. They were follow and continuing to do the old traditional ways. The Catholic church. Amen. That and and and and these other churches around that are bringing in Amen. man-made dogma, man-made creeds that you can't even find in the Bible. Amen. You can't find praying to Mary in the Bible. You can't pray. You can't find Amen. Uh uh all of these things. Amen. That you know when you when you swallow the little the the little kosher bread that you Amen. that you have partaking of the literal body of Christ. Amen. That that ain't in there. Well, come on, church. Amen. That ain't in there. Amen. that you can come and and and just that you can live any life you want to live. Amen. What does Lord mean anyways? What does Lord mean? Lord means that you are surrendering your rights, surrendering your will, surrendering, Amen. everything you are to the headship of another. And if Jesus Christ is Lord, if he is the King, then those that are under him are to do his wishes. And his wishes are found in here. &gt;&gt; It's not found in the Almanac. It's not found on YouTube. It's not It's not found on Google. It's found in his word. Hallelujah. Now, the Bible says there's going to be many on that day that had the wrong perspective. They're going to come up to Jesus and they're going to knock and they he's they're going to say, "Let us in." Lord, somebody say, "Lord." &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord. Lord. We're going to say it twice here. Have we not cast out devils? Have we not worked miracles? Have we not done these things in your name? And Jesus is going to say, you workers of iniquity because you have done not the will of my father. A part &gt;&gt; perspective is everything. &gt;&gt; If he is my Lord, then what do we do? We take his word. And brother, there's only going to be one group that makes the rapture. And those that are of those that have made him Lord. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm glad for? I'm glad he's given us his word. Now, we can prepare for the rapture. We can prepare to meet him right now. Oh, God's good God. God is a loving God. God sent you to this church service this morning to hear this uh Amen. this fat preacher preach. Amen. So that we can know who we are and who he is. Can you say amen? Amen. God, take away my tradition. Take away my religion. Take away the things of this world. Let me see Jesus for who he is. Let me make him the Lord of my life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Only the blood can satisfy the courts of heaven. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God was the first one to slay a lamb. &gt;&gt; Did you know that God was the first one to slay a lamb when Adam and Eve had fallen? &gt;&gt; God slew a lamb. And then with the that same lamb, he took the coat. He took the skins of that lamb and put it around their naked bodies &gt;&gt; and they walked out of the garden. What was it that there was going to be the lamb of God to come and he was going to take away our sins and his righteousness? his righteousness would cover all of our unrighteousness. What am I trying to tell you? When you take on the blood of Jesus Christ and you come under the headship of his word, his covering, Amen. You're as righteous as God is. &gt;&gt; I believe what God says. God, well, praise the name of the Lord. Amen. You know what I should say? What what I what what I want to Amen. stress to you this morning? Set your eyes upon that goal of redemption. Set your eyes on that goal of redemption. Redemption is not to leave me here. Redemption is to take me back where I fell from. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Redemption is not to leave me in sorrow and misery. Redemption is to pour me out and to give me a peace. Amen. That is full of heavenly life and his blessing. Well, can you say amen? Amen. there in Luke 9 and62 Jesus said unto them no man having put his hand into the plow looking back is fit for the kingdom of God. Hebrews 10 and38 now the judge shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto predition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. And God, if you started me, I'm going to keep on oppressing. God, if you gave me the Holy Ghost, I'm going to keep on. Well, can you say amen? He that has started you is going to finish you. Amen. He's going to take you to that. Hallelujah. There's a brand new body waiting on you. There's a brand new city waiting on you. There's a God of heaven bringing you back to himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. In order to keep pressing, the Apostle Paul told us in Hebrews 12:2, Amen. We got to keep our eyes upon the one who's called us. &gt;&gt; He says, "Looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher." Somebody say, "The author &gt;&gt; and the finisher &gt;&gt; of our faith." &gt;&gt; The right perspective. Now, I'm going to keep looking at him. Praise the Lord. You're saying, "Brother Wendle, I've given my life to God and God knows it. My heart is to please him. Brother Wendle, I'm in an area in my life where Satan where I I I it just seems like he's got a stronghold." You just got to keep your eyes upon the one who started you and the one who's going to finish you &gt;&gt; because the Bible done told us in Ephesians 6, amen, that we are in a warfare. And he says, "You've got to put on, amen, the the the breastplate of righteousness, and you've got to put on the helmet of salvation, and you've got to have your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel. And you've got to take the sword of the spirit." What is he doing all of this for? Is because the devil don't want you going to your inheritance. The de But God's God didn't just save you. He has equipped you to fight. &gt;&gt; Now, come on, church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's one thing for you for him to come and and and and and and remove the padlock from your jail cell, &gt;&gt; but it's another thing for him to give you a bazooka and whatever else. Amen. Give you the rifles and Amen. the machinery to any devil that says that you can't come out, just Hallelujah. Any devil that's trying to keep you in that jail cell, just put him down. Well, come on, church. Amen. God did not just say, "Okay, I I I've saved you." Amen. Now, I'm just going to leave you in your condition. No, sir. He sent the baptism of the Holy Ghost back to us. He given us his word. He's given us what it takes to fight. And he's saying, "Fight, fight. Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight. Don't turn aside. Don't turn around. Fight with all that you've got. I've called you for a heavenly purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Looking unto Jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; Now watch. Who for and and I'm back in Hebrews 12 and two. who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me here this morning? &gt;&gt; Now, the right perspective. God's not leaving me. Amen. As a reject, God's God's God's called me and he has anointed me to prevail over the enemy. He says, "I want you to look to Jesus, who is the author and the finisher of your faith, and I want you to see what caused him to keep going &gt;&gt; and never turn back. &gt;&gt; Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of God." Can you say amen? Now, what was this joy that was set before him? How would he know what the joy was? He was ever bit a man. You say, "Well, he knew everything." When they were asking Jesus, "When will you come back?" He said, "Even the son doesn't know when he's coming back." We don't I don't know. Jesus Jesus said that, "I don't know." Hallelujah. How did Jesus know these things? He searched the scripture. When the disciple when the Pharisees were coming against him, amen, he says there in John 5:39, he says, "Search search the scripture from them. You think you have eternal life and they they which testify of me." Is that right? The Bible says that Jesus went up to the to to to the to the temple and and as all eyes were fastened upon him, he come and he took the scroll and he opened the scroll up and and He read. Amen. He says unto him, he says that there in Luke 4 and1 17 there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he opened the book, he found the place where it is written. Then he starts reading the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel and he's pre and he's talking about himself. Then down to the 20th verse he says he closed the book. He gave it again to the minister and sat down. And all the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." What was this joy? How did Jesus How did Jesus what kept him in line with the father's will? He found where it was written in him in the Bible. &gt;&gt; He found the places in the Bible He knew who he was. I'm getting someplace here in a minute. God wants you to know who you are. &gt;&gt; He wants you to know because if you know who you are, then you know who you're not. &gt;&gt; If you know that you're a son and daughter of God and that God's anointed you to defeat the devil, then you're not a slave. You're not a victim. &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? when they were asking Jesus, "Hey, give us a sign. Give us a sign." He says, "There's only one sign I'm going to give you." Just as Jonas was buried in in the belly of the well for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man. &gt;&gt; He had a lot of He was he he he he was borderline arrogant. According to those guys, he wasn't arrogant. He was confident. The scripture has declared who he was. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Jesus found himself in the scripture. That that that scripture there before we move on there, Psalms 40 and six. And I and this is powerful because the apostle Paul brings it up as well. But that there in Psalms 40 and 6, sacrifice and offering thou did not desire. Mine ears hast thou opened. burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Then said I, lo, I come in the volume of the book, it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, oh God, yay, thy law is within my heart. Now there in Hebrews 10 and5, it says, therefore, when Christ entered into the world, he says, sacrifi, and and this is this I'm reading out of the amplified version. Keep just follow me along, but this is the amplified version. Sacrifice and offering you have not desired, but instead you have prepared a body for me to offer. In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin, you have taken no delight. Then said I, behold, I have come to do your will, oh God, to fulfill that what is written of me in the scroll of the book. after saying in the citation above, ye have neither desired nor have you taken delight in sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin which are offered according to the law. Then he said, "Behold, I have come to do your will. &gt;&gt; I have come." Are you catching what he's saying here? I have found my perspective. is being molded by what I have found in scripture. What I want to bring to you as I begin to wind down my thoughts here today, you find your place in the scripture. You say, "H, what do you mean find my place in the scripture?" Did you realize that here in this last church age, Ephesians 3 and9 has something very specifically toward you to make all men, it means the world to see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hidden God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be made known by the church, the wisdom of God according to the purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord. Now I I I want to read this in the NIV there in the 10th verse. His intent was that now through the church the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and and authorities the devils demons sickness addictions in the heavenly realms according to his eternal purpose. Romans 8:19. Romans 8:19. For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God. The creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope. Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty, glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now. It's all pointing to this day when the coming of the Lord is so close. When the coming of the Lord is so close, there's going to be a revelation in the hearts of God's elect. &gt;&gt; Our perception is going to change in the evening time. &gt;&gt; Our perception of Jesus Christ. Now, we have gone through ages. Amen. Y'all still with me? We have gone through the church ages where it's been traditions, men's opinions. We've had all of these going down. It's been a lot of tradition. But the scripture says there in first uh 1 Corinthians 13:10, but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is done in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child, but when I become a man, I put away childish things. &gt;&gt; For now, we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know even as I am known. What's he talking about? The day right before the coming of the Lord, there's going to be the revelation of the son of man. There's going to be the Messiah sign again. That Messiah sign is to come. Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man." In other words, God is going to reveal himself. &gt;&gt; Greater in this day. You say, "Now, Brother Wendle, I no, no, no, no. I'm talking about the promise is the God is going to come in a supernatural way to those who are willing to take on his perspective. &gt;&gt; And we're going to know God in a way greater. How else do you think this rapture is going to take place? There's going to be a generation that is going to come and rise up and say I know what this is about. &gt;&gt; In other words, God is that the Bible also says that that there was going to be that time of adoption. &gt;&gt; Adoption. The Bible days of adoption wasn't wasn't necessarily taking someone from another family and putting them into this one. adoption was when the son when when when the the the son as he was raised, you know, as a baby, he was got up to a certain age where he was given over to a tutor. The tutor would tutor him, teach him the father's kingdom, would would would would show him and and and that tutor would would would bring him up from a child. The Bible says, "As long as he is a child, he differs nothing from a servant, though he be the heir of all. Amen. So the scripture says that they is there is an adoption and then the Jewish family what they would do when the son come to appoint the father would come to to to the tutor throughout the years say how's my son coming along oh you'd be proud of him you'd be proud of him he's he's learning good and he's hey yeah he's still got a lot he's still a kid he's still a kid but I'm telling you there comes a day when father comes and asks the tutor how's he coming along he say you You know what? This man is taking on your thoughts. &gt;&gt; He is looking at all of your wealth as you would look at it. Don't fear him. He's not going to he's he's not going to squander the inheritance. He's not going to he's he's not going to go spend his money on righteous living. This son of yours is ready. He's ready to be adopted. And what he would do, Amen. He would set him out there before all of the people and he would he would go through a ceremony. He says, "This day I adopt my son. I set him over the inheritance." He would put a robe upon him and give him a ring and whatever he said. Doesn't that not sound like Jesus Christ? Does that not sound like what happened to Jesus? Well, that's what God is doing to us in this day in the rapture season. What are we going to do? God is calling a group of men and women, sons and daughters of God, that have came and subjected themselves to the tutor, the Holy Spirit, who has taught us the word, given us the inheritance. What are we fixing to do? We're fixing to walk out on the ashes of the wicked. The Bible says that you are going to inherit the earth. &gt;&gt; You are going to rule and reign on the Come on, church. There is a people that the Holy Spirit is going to give a perspective like no other age. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's just all smoke and mirrors." That's what the Bible says. I don't know what you've been taught, but that's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet would say according to this scripture there in question and answers he 1 Corinthians 13 says that uh when that which is perfect has come that which is in part should be done away with. So all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid and trying to talk in tongues and all these other things than that which is perfect. And we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication. Then that which is in part is done away with. When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child. But when I become a man, I put away childish things. God always uses man. God has put man over this earth. &gt;&gt; And God's wanting some men and women. You ain't going to be nothing for the kingdom as long as you're still in the pawn shop. &gt;&gt; You can't live and reign as long as you're still behind the jail cell. God's not called you to stay in sin. God's not called you to stay in unbelief. God's not called you to stay in tradition. &gt;&gt; God has come to break you free. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And he whom the Son has set free is free indeed. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you see why the devil wants to keep you in unbelief? You know why the devil wants to keep you there? because he knows that if you take God's word, Amen, in my name, they shall cast out devils. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Amen. In my Well, come on, church. Amen. That's what you have been anointed and called to. I say, God, give me the right perspective. &gt;&gt; Give me the right perspective. Give me the right Give me Let me see your word as you want it seen. Let me see you. Let me see me &gt;&gt; for who you've called me to be. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God's always used man. Now, when God looked at Adam and he gave man, he said unto Adam into that spirit being, Amen. He told him to to to multiply and to rule and have dominion over the fish of the sea and the fowl of the air and every beast. He told him, he gave him dominion. The prophet would say if he was in the beginning, he lauded his word so much for each generation, each time that he had this age coming on. He's omnipresent, omniscent, omnipotent, he's infinite. If he isn't, he isn't God. Being fine, infinite, he's eternal. Then in that being omnipresent, being omnisient, knowing all things makes him omnipresent. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Therefore, he could tell the end from the beginning. And in each age, he allotted so much of the word in each age. And then usually man gets it all twisted up and gets the world gets in a such a shape until he has to send an anointed man. And all the ages have been the same. And he identifies himself up on the earth and that man and in man and God does nothing without man. The Bible said so. You know that he always takes a man because it was man that he has to use. Oh, somebody say, "Lord, use me." Lord, use me. Can you say amen? Oh, God's grace is abounding for this age, and it's more than enough. The Romans 5 and 20, moreover, the law entered that offense might abound, but when where sin abounded, grace did much more. abound. Ephesians 1:7 and in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches, somebody say riches of his grace, wherein he hath abounded, in other words, in abundance, overflow, came running. He has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence. &gt;&gt; How much am I forgiven, brother Wendle? How much? Well, the Apostle Paul was a murderer. &gt;&gt; He was a blasphemer. &gt;&gt; And in 1 Timothy 1:12, he says, "I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry, who was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurous. But I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant. Well, someone shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the grace of our Lord, I'm telling you a different perspective, church. I'm giving you a different perspective. Don't look at this thing as just another religious ceremony. Why don't you come to the reality that you are a son of God? &gt;&gt; You always were a son of God. Satan tries to keep you bound. Come to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Says, "The grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus." This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Jesus that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief. Can you say amen? Oh, glory to God. Mary, you you say, "Well, I'm I'm just I'm just a little mom. That's it." Amen. God doesn't hear me. Hallelujah. But you're a daughter, Wally. You might say, "Well, I'm just I'm just an older man beginning to see my letter days. I I I don't know if God can do anything for me. You're a son of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can look around even even to the children. Hallelujah. I don't know who we'd pick on this morning, Sister Charity. You might say, "I don't know, brother Wendle." God says, "Ah, you're my daughter." If you're called, God provides what it takes. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Moses looking around and saying, "I I I can't go deliver those people because God came down and says, I've called you to go deliver those people." And and and he said, "I can't do it. I I I just they they won't hurt you." there in Exodus 4:1 and Moses answered and says, "But behold, they will not believe me, nor will they hearken unto me, for they will say, the Lord hath not appeared unto thee, unto thee." And the Lord said, "What is in thine hand?" &gt;&gt; And he says, "A rod." The 17th verse, it says, "Thou shalt take this rod in thy hand wherewith thou shalt do signs." And Moses delivered the entire nation of Israel. What do you have in your hand here this morning? Well, according to the perspective that I've just put out there, you're not a loser. &gt;&gt; You're not a wannabe. &gt;&gt; You are here in this service this morning because God's got a purpose for you here on this earth. &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor and say, "God's got a purpose &gt;&gt; for you being here on this earth." Hallelujah. He's got a purpose &gt;&gt; and you're never going to be satisfied until that purpose is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Well, what do you have in your hand? Well, all I've got, I'm just a little housewife. That sounds good. Just go with it and start whooping on devils. &gt;&gt; Well, what can I do? Your prayer is powerful. &gt;&gt; Your words are powerful. Speak the name of Jesus over your children. Amen. when they're when when it's going when it's when when when they're when your children are going wall, you know, and this that and the other and attitudes are, Amen. You just stand firm on who you are. Don't you lose your perspective. Don't you let your mind get caught up in a whirlwind. Don't you let Amen. I don't know. I I I No. Stand up like a daughter of God and say, "Those children are mine." And you just start speaking the word of God over those children. &gt;&gt; I still speak the word of God over my children. I speak the word of God over my ch all of my grandchildren. Amen. I speak the word of God over Actually, I speak the word of God over all of you young people. I I I'm constantly speaking the word of God over you. I speak the word of God. Amen. I I've I've done it. I've done it for years and years and years, and I ain't stopping now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd go I when I pray, I pray, Amen. I call out Kobe's name, Caleb's name, Joshua's name, Michael's name, I Patrick's name. Amen. I would claim those I would claim those those boys and I just claim and and and I and I want to say I never even gave up on I I I kept on naming your name, Patrick. I did. I did. And what we're doing here today, mamas, don't you ever tire of naming those boys before God, keeping that I don't care if you're if you've got if you've got sons and daughters that are out of of fellowship with God. Maybe they're grown and they're out and away. There is an authority in the name of Jesus. And there is an authority in sons and daughters of God who know who they are. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look at Samson. What is in your hand? Samson, all he he had was the jawbone of a donkey. Amen. Samson was anointed. He was raised up, ordained of God, given a gift of power, was ordained to destroy the nations of the Philistines. He was born on the earth, anointed of God to destroy the Philistines. One day they caught him out in the field without a sword, without a spear, and a thousand of those armored Philistines run upon him. Did Did he get down and say, "Oh Lord, I'm waiting for a vision. Oh Lord, what must I do? Direct me what to do?" He knowed he had a need. He found nothing but an old jawbone of a mule and he beat down a thousand Philistines. Amen. He never cried to God. He used his anointed gift. He knowed that he was sent for the job. He knew he was born for that. He know he was anointed with a gift and he beat down a thousand Philistines. Didn't cry to God. God ordained him and vindicated that he was the one by by the others that he had done. No matter what the circumstance was, he did it. Well, someone shout hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't ask questions. Don't ask questions. Just believe that God has called you. That's the perspective. As the musicians prepare to come, notice God making himself known. Not that we're supposed to make converts to Christianity by a government, but by the revelation, the Christ in you. As God was in Christ, as God was in Christ, it is Christ in you. Someone shout yes. &gt;&gt; When God, what God done in Christ, Christ does in you. What signs God done in Christ, Christ does in you. I mean, this is this we're going we're going to drive this home. Isn't that wonderful? Oh my. I like that Jesus said, "At that day, that's this day. At that day, when this revelation is made known, you will know that I'm in the Father, the Father in me, I in you, you in me." And when the revelation is made manifest at that day, you will know Faith doesn't try. Faith knows. When you pray, don't don't try to convince God. Say, "Lord, give me a revelation. Give me a perspective like I've never had. I want to see you in a different light. I want you to be my Lord. And I want you to shine your light upon me because I belong to a different kingdom now. Not the kingdom of sin and death, but the kingdom of righteousness, the kingdom of faith, the kingdom of authority. Tradition will keep me bound. There is no power in tradition. You can go through all the formalities of church tradition all you want and you'll be just as powerless. [Music] But if you'll understand that you're a son and daughter of God, [Music] that he's anointed you in this house, that your prayers do matter, that you can pray over your children, and those prayers are an absolute The Bible says, The Bible says that David that the jailer when when when Paul and Silas was in jail and they prayed and prison shook because the power of God and and all the shackles were were loosed and the jailer was fixing to take his life. And he says, "Oh, sir, don't do that." He says, "We're all still here." He says, "But this is the power of Jesus in us." And the jailer says, "I want this Christ." And what did he say? He said, "Believe upon Jesus Christ and you and your household shall be saved. Now we know that his household has to accept Christ there. God has no grandchildren. You have to come to God has no grandchildren. He just has sons and daughters. Your children have to accept Jesus Christ too. But the faith, the faith and the words of that jailer when he accepted Jesus Christ, the prophet would put it this way. He said, "The faith that you used for your own salvation, use that same faith for your children &gt;&gt; and it will bring them to." There is a power that is within you through that new birth, man. We ain't wannab bees. We're children of God. Faith has placed us there. God will bring those things. Do you love him? I said, "Well, I don't want to ask too big of a thing. I I I don't want to, brother. I I don't know, man. This is just too big." There is nothing too big. There is nothing too great. There is nothing too powerful. You can't ask him enough. You can't ask him too many times. You can't I'm saying the perspective. Are you all me perspective? Lord, give me a vision of heaven. Give me a vision of Christ. Amen. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we want to thank you. Thank you for your amazing love, for the goodness of the Lord that has led us to repentance. And not just led us to repentance, but has also shown us who we are. That the wonderful name of Jesus is greater than any of our adversaries. [Music] Now Lord, what the devil would pull put on any of us, what he's tried to do to Shorty, we have found Lord that your power is greater. We've got though the devil has tried to take take dad, but Lord, there he was this morning playing the guitar. These are just the these are these are showing perspectives that are that are saying I'm a believer. I know where I am. I know who I am. And one of these days because of us coming into a relationship with you and just our faith believing you, making you our Lord. Lord, if any of us should go the way of the grave, we'll have that blessed assurance that we will rise and the blessings of God will be upon us and will rule and reign. Lord Jesus, never let us never let us make this about a tradition or about a religion. We want a relationship with you now. Help our eyes to focus on you. We thank you for it. We bless your name. We exalt you for you are high and lifted up. But we want you high and lifted exalted in our hearts and our minds. We thank you for it, Father, in the name of Jesus.
