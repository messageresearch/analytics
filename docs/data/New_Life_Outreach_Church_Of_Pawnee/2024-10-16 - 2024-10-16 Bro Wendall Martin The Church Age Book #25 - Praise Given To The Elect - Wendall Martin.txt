and the the beautiful decor and and um just heartfelt words I just I know it meant a lot to brother William and sister Sharon and and um sister Brian and brother Robert and just all of us you know and um we're just going to read read um uh that 19th verse this is to the thar and church age it says I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you today for for your many blessings that you have have given us thank you Lord for salvation and Lord to give us an understanding Lord in your scripture through prophecy Lord where we are today and and how that the Royal Seed of Abraham has Lord come down through all of the ages and Lord though Satan has tried to bring up his bride yet you've got a bride and we're so thankful Lord to to have this unveiling in our day Lord these other churches didn't understand what was going on Lord and yet they they gave their life Lord for the cuse that they believed in and here today Lord the cover's been taken off and and we can see exactly what every other age has has fought Lord it I I I pray that you not let us let it lead us to lukewarmness but to lead us to a a greater faith and fervency and enthusiasm Lord for your word oh God we're just asking that you would be with us tonight that you would reveal yourself to us as we read through the church ages Lord we uh ask that you would be with those that are sick tonight Lord that you would bring healing uh into their homes and we'll just give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated uh here today tonight and um uh we're here in the th tyan Church age and um um did you enjoy last Wednesday night brother Harry's reading and and um um the things that he brought out uh the other night was was just really wonderful and um and so um we we understand that amen that we're we're living in an incredible age because uh God sent a prophet to us to to reveal and the things that that he had done in s symbols and these the these these symbols um were put there uh to it it had to be written in in in Holy Scripture and it had to be done uh through prophecy he wanted you and me to know about it and if it wasn't written in the scripture then then uh uh we wouldn't know about it and um but at the same time it wasn't given for the for the other ages the 1 2 third fourth fifth 6th age it was given for us so he gives it he writes these things in a symbol form so when the other churches throughout the ages are looking at it it's it's they're reading the book but the Revelation is sealed up and so they they don't know what it means and today the nominal church still doesn't know what it means but yet here here we stand tonight and the the Holy Spirit but he but he promised now on these on these Mysteries and on these symbols and these things that had to come out he says I I'll send a prophet I'll do nothing except I send a prophet God will not reveal God will not show anything through a theologian he will not show anything amen any Divine mystery open any through a pastor through an evangelist or or even through a five-fold Ministry prophet he will only do it through that seventh or these one of these seven uh uh uh Angels one of these seven Messengers to the age it it didn't say that I I'm going to I'm going to send the Revelation down to all the pastors or I'm going to send all the Revelation down to all the evangelists but he says I will send it to each one of these ages as we looked at a couple weeks ago unto the angel of epis unto the angel every to singular Angel and then that Prophet would come amen and reveal the portion for each age amen he gave him that portion for each one of those but in our day it wasn't just a portion when the seventh angel comes and begins to sound the entire mystery of the church ages would be complete amen the book would be open and then you and I can come freely o through an open book and see where we are what we are who we are amen and how close we are to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ I I I think it's so beautiful and so uh you know and and when we we we can't we can't forget um uh as as brother brandham would tell us amen the book uh the you know the the Book of Revelation shows the two spirits that would be at work and so um it's easy we we've been doing doing this now for months and months and so we don't want to lose track because we we stopped we've we've we've covered a lot of Doctrine and and um and it's been a wonderful time but we want to catch what what what the spirit is doing down through these ages there are two Spirits there is the Spirit of the Antichrist and then there is the spirit of God there are two trees amen there there's the there's the false Vine and then there is the the the the real Vine uh brother brandom Ed again he used the uh uh uh the tree that God planted and then Satan comes in and and and he begins to put in a a graphs his own stuff his own religious tree and and living off the life of of Christianity living off the life of God but yet uh uh producing their own Works their own fruit so they can come to church amen under the name of Jesus Christ and and claim to be Christians using the same Bible and and do all of these things and still yet say that it's okay to be a transgender amen and deny the work say it's okay homosexual life is okay to to say it's okay to hate your brother it's okay uh uh you know to to to do all all of these things here and and what and what it is it is it is uh Satan who has grafted his own uh uh Branch onto the tree of Christ living off of the life of the holy spirit because we are all Spirit beings you're a spirit being I'm a spirit being the pope is a spirit being uh uh Hitler was a spirit being and so Satan has found a way way to be able to to take those spirits and cause people to enter into that Supernatural that spiritual real can live in a supernatural world and yet their souls be totally lost and and and and and they can can live vile and and and and live adulterous lives and and be fornicators and be this and liars and and all of these things here but God it doesn't take away from the TR there is that false woman that brother uh Harry uh beautifully brought out the other night amen she's a foul woman she's a she she's got daughters that are harlots she she's not living true to the words of God and the ways of God but brother but if you remember as brother brandham kept making the distinction but there is a holy one who represents everything pure represents everything perfect represents and that and and and so I'm glad tonight to to know that I I I am that elected lady that you are the elected the elected lady can you say Amen a and so amen the that Antichrist spirit is is has been there throughout all of these ages and and so I as we get ready to read now I want us to turn we're going to back up a little bit uh um to the uh page 22 one and um we're going to start there at 1 2 3 4 the fourth paragraph um and we're not going to read uh the um the that 19th verse because we just read it to start out so we're just going to go on where it starts here again we we find the same introductory remarks I Know Thy works the Son of God himself said believe me for uh the very work sake he put an emphasis on his own Works while on earth now I I I want us to just really enjoy this here because it's it's he's fixing to show that The Works that Christ done gave him confidence in who he was the works and then he's going to turn around and show the very works of this bride is going should give you confidence to know who you are because it's the life of the vine coming through predestinated branches and whatever the root produced is what the branches producing now now he's going to he's going to separate you know works for salvation and the works of Christ within us I think this is beautiful so I want youall to really pay attention what you're reading amen he says the Son of God himself said believe me he's talking to everybody and says hey believe me because my works for my very work sake he put emphasis on his own Works while on Earth The Works he did were ordained God to inspire faith in him they were ordained to inspire faith in himself now watch what he says about you it was a great part of his ministry and his holy spirit in the Apostle Paul said for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has for ordained that we should walk in them Ephesians 2:10 these Works were to inspire faith in him as they would show forth the relationship to him that Paul described as created in him now works will never take the place of faith faith in God for our salvation but works will show forth our faith already placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit unto the Lord I believe in good works if even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can what is horrible in the sight of God is for men to do evil works and then say they are doing the will of God and that is what the Bishops and popes and hierarchy and the hierarchy of Rome were doing they were killing maming doing all manner of evil in the name of the Lord they lived out lives exactly opposite to what the word teaches in that day those True Believers Shone like a light in a dark place now I I I I I think now there's there's really a lot of similarities here to to this age the th tyan age and the and the leosan age the th tyan age the lighted went to out s CA could you put that um uh the candlesticks up and I I want you to look the light was almost totally gone out of out of uh that that th tyan Age and and so uh now we're in the fourth Church age so you can see that light that thyon the darkness had had totally take over and then look at Le oosa now now that is shown there the way that the angel of the lord gave it to brother brandham totally blacked out and brother brandham you remember he asked the angel can I put a sliver of light in there for for the elect and uh uh and and and so the angel of the Lord said yes so he put a little sliver of light in that lots and agent which doesn't reflect there um um and I think it is in your regular Church age book let me look at it and just just see yes you you if you're if you look back there to to the front of your book you will have a little bit of light in in Leona but that's the way that it was first given where it was totally dark so the elect the elect is praise the Lord God's light to this age now I want us to to to really think of this as we look thyra now thyra they were dying this was the longest age of them all this they they went almost 1500 Years brother murl asked me one time why why I had put the Dark Ages on thyra and brother bradam actually says that and I think we we we'll probably hit that tonight uh where where he says the the uh uh the thyra was the Dark Ages plural in other words it it just you know when the when they when they're making the reference uh theologians are making the reference they they talk about the Dark Ages and so brother Brandon was just saying that is that's the 1500 years of of of of Darkness now I believe that this church age here was how many years was that I I think it was n yeah 9914 years almost a thousand years was the age of thyra now they they killed and maimed and and and tried to destroy but but here in this age amen God or Satan has taken over another way he's not trying to kill and maim and Destroy naturally but he is coming spiritually and it is worked in such a way that when God showed brother brandom it was darker in this age than it was in the th tyan age now I want you to understand that but the elect of God will pre Prevail aren't you glad for that amen all right so let's go back to reading all right he says in in that day that evil day those True Believers Shone like a light in a dark place as they continually did good for they returned cursing with blessing and did the truth to honor God even though many died for it in this verse he is commending his children because they were living changed lives their works testified to a new spirit within men saw their works and glorified God yes sir if you are a Christian you are going to do what is right your Works will show that your heart is right it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will even when no one but God sees you and you will do his will even if it cost you your life now that's that's incredible he says I know your love service faith and patience you will note that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without our love without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service God speaking to Corinthians said without love I am nothing and whatever I do is without profit unless it is done in love now you can see here that these Believers weren't in that nicadan class that did works as a mean of Salvation to be admired by men they did their works out of the love of God that was shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost and that love in their hearts was God's love for his own Jesus said by this shall shall all men know that you're my disciples that you have love for one another the pagans saw the lives of the early Christians and uh uh said behold how they love each other John said everyone that loveth is born of God 1 John 4:7 I want to give you a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of the abounding of iniquity the love of many would wax cold in the layot of sinan or last age self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God and we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days and that's the reason I have felt so compelled lately to just really go back to some of the basics and really strike those things home where is our love where is our fervency where are we putting things are is every everything in the proper order they've got to be in the proper order it must be God and God Alone can I hear an amen so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day now think about that because the hardness the hardness of heart where you can't you can't enjoy your salvation you can't enjoy the Revelation if you can't enjoy the re Revelation the most beautiful of all ages with the greatest of Revelations of all ages and we come to church and it just seems like it seems like there's no energy or no no fervency to come back I wonder if we're truly catching what God is doing you hold the greatest revelation of any age Hallelujah right oh don't let the hardness of sin see the hardness we get hard and and the thing is is we and and we we have we it's just we go go go go we have to take care of our family we have to take care of our uh uh you know you you the children your husband and and and you husbands you're getting out early you're coming home you're wore out and and and all of this Amen in in in all of this normal natural activity we are fighting spirit of unbelief like no other age amen but there such such incredible Spirits brother bradam says when knowledge increased unbelief has just increased and started flooding in and we're and we're fighting these things in our minds we're fighting so hard and if we're not careful amen and if we don't keep that heart protected and we don't amen I really truly appreciate the old open book amen this coming to life if we don't appreciate that the gift that God gave you as a standard against the enemy will be putting on a shelf somewhere that's right amen and and and all of these rivers of unbelief are coming in against you and and and we' seen what happened uh uh with with uh what was it Halen amen were they swep they say there's still dozens of people swept away they don't they they're still looking for dozens they're missing amen swipe away and brother brandham use rivers of unbelief they're they're just they're coming in and they're just sweeping everybody away but brother but but when but brother Bram says when the when it said the spirit of the Lord shall raise up a standard he has come and lifted the revelation of his word in our hearts not our minds in our hearts so that we know where to stand and how to fight well can I hear an amen amen so so we we want to guard that amen he he says we must guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day Spirit it is time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of this last day church and reject the truth which alone is able to save us in those dark and Dreadful years the True Vine held its love for God and love for the Brethren love of the Brethren and God commended them for it I know your service Jesus said he that is greatest of all is servant to all a wise man commented on that saying here is what he said only history will prove the truth of that victim that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head have gone down in shame even the very rich are condemned by God when they have not used their wealth right but look into history and you will find that the truly great were those who served others history can never Acclaim those for whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others let us apply that to ourselves even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we are to follow that example we see him as he bows himself over the feet of the Apostles and washes their tired and dirty feet he said you don't know what I'm doing now what I'm doing but you will know Hereafter but what you see me doing you ought to do also he became a servant in order that God could Elevate him to the highest Heights oh what a lesson today if you want to be if you want to if you want to be great with God be a servant amen I I I'm always talking about being a servant amen having servants Hearts I I would rather have a servant's heart I I I would rather be the low man on the totem Poe every time if I'm the low man on the totem Poe that means I am pushing others up I can't do too much when I'm when I'm down or when I'm on top trying to to get you on top of me but what if I can be on the bottom of the of the ladder and push it up when I when I I I I have had I've had I I I've had I remember Aaron being up there uh he up on on a uh on a roof helping me and uh you remember that Aaron and and uh I I would be down there below him and and making sure he wasn't going to fall and helping him pushing him all the way on up you know and he was scared spitless and uh but after he' done it for a while uh he he he enjoyed it and he felt like a man amen you he was a he was a little Tau but uh uh but I I you see when when that's the way that we should all be with one another amen it's not that I get ahead my desire is that you get ahead it's not that my My Rewards will be on the on the other side and so will yours be on the other side as long as we do that and you know what I think there's still plenty of room to shine good Christian Light and little churches can do that little communities like this can do that because we're really aen we we're like we're all a big family and if we have that kind of a thought toward one another and have that kind of a thought towards the community you have the ability to shine an incredible light in this 2500 people because well it's La fishing in a lake and and a big old huge uh lake with 350 acres and fishing in a pond amen you're fishing in a pond well you ain't got too those fish ain't got too many places they can go to hide whereas if you've got a 350 acre Lake amen you you know they don't know if your boat's there or not there so here in little communities like this amen we have a privilege to really Express Jesus amen thinking last night uh um you know some of the some of the stuff come from Anita Franks and then others come from Susan Spears and and these and one of them um uh um Anita is is a Mormon I believe she comes she's the Mormon faith and I think Suzanne Spears is she's Episcopalian or or or something like that and uh and and they have the highest of praise for for all of you here and I and I was thinking about that and I thought oh God let us live live such a life and be such an expression not of the human nature but of God's nature and that's what brother brandom is saying we don't want to express ourselves but it's the Living spirit on the inside of us that has produced a a a servant's heart and a servant's heart goes above and beyond and loving and giving and so that his Spirit can be reflected through US amen all right now let's see [Music] here um he says but now let us apply to ourselves even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we are to follow that example we uh see him as he bows himself over the feet of the Apostles washing their feet uh tired and dirty feet and said you do not know what I'm doing but you will know Hereafter but what you see me doing you ought also to do he become a servant in order that God could Elevate him to the highest Heights and one day in judgment of the Saints we are going to hear him say Well done good and faithful servant a capital servant even enter thou into the joy of the Lord it is hard to always be a servant but those who Spin and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne it will be worth it all then let us labor for the master from the Dawn Till Setting Sun let us talk of all his wondrous love and care when all of life is over and our work on Earth is done and the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there he says I know your faith he does not say here as he did to the church in pergamus you hold my faith he's not talking about his faith now he's commending them for their faithfulness as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for he says in James 1 and3 the trying of your faith Works patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your faith Romans 5 and3 tribulation Works patience how highly God re regards the outworking of our patience as SE in James 1 and 4 now I I want to read it again how highly God regs this outworking coming from the inside working out our patience as seen in James 1 and4 let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire lacking nothing God's will is for uh for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God waiting before God this is the process of character development how highly God has commended these Saints of the Dark Ages patient as Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly Faithfully they served God that is that is all they wanted out of life just service to their lord how great was to be their reward isn't that isn't that your desire too just all you want out of life is just service to the Lord amen I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor role of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more their faith increased how tragic it was for the Ephesian age uh in that the F fision age waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age in the darkest of all ages oh think about your AG Le osia they served him even more now I want to read it to you again how tragic it was that in the Ephesian age love waned truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age the darkest of Ages they served him even more what a lesson this is there is no ceasing of that gracious service of Love unto the Lord but rather an increasing of it that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increased service when the faint are crying in fear this is the time to shout the victory can you say Amen now now you you want to know man this goes right along with what I've been saying you've been sick Satan's trying to keep you out of church that is your time to say no amen uh uh page 15 in in the church age book over here in the 15th brother uh uh um it says um he says let me let me just give you a word here for my own Ministry if you don't mind you all know that this gift in my life is Supernatural it is a gift whereby the holy spirit is able to discern Jesus and the thoughts of men's hearts and other hidden things that only God could know and then reveal to me I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of the people when Satan knows he is going to be exposed now it isn't the people that I'm talking about it is Satan has a hold in their lives through sin indifference and disease but you should see their faces Satan knows he's going to be exposed and the most peculiar changes come over the people's countenances Satan is afraid he knows the spirit of God is about to let the people know of his works I should have waited for y'all to read with me this is why he hates meetings like this when names are called and diseases revealed Satan hates it now what is this it is not mind reading it is not telepathy or witchcraft it is Revelation by the holy ghost that is the only way I can know it of course the carnal mind will call it anything but the Holy Ghost now now now he's talking about he's talking about the Book of Revelations and he's saying if you notice in the me ings this Spirit of Revelation that is upon me when when Satan knows that he is exposed and the Revelation comes to those people those people are free from that devil they they they can they can see it clearly as as as the spirit of the Lord is Discerning and then the next paragraph if y'all want to read it uh catch up with me over here in in page 15 he says now uh uh 15 there in um uh the the last paragraph he says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless but it exposes Satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he has cast in the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits in the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and Wiis stand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be what powerless before her he will be as thwarted that today as when Jesus with stod his effort every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with the true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them that's what God has given us I know he hits us with his sickness I know he's doing it everywhere I I I I don't like seeing Christians with their tail between their legs and and and just walking out and letting Satan get the best of you fight that devil amen I'm not trying to say be goody two shoes and well well this one's that made it to church and that one didn't and so man we are that no I'm not this ain't legalism at all I'm teaching you how to fight that's right I'm saying I'm saying when the devil is putting it on you then you need to resist him 1 million times and fight him that much the harder and if he's trying to keep you out of church baby you ain't keeping me out of church anymore I'm going to stand my grounds against you and you're going to you're going to find out that that revelation will have power over that stupid thing that is trying to keep you under its Thum the devil keeps on doing the same thing with with with with with Lust For You boys fight it and how do you do it you you you you get to yourself grab the word of God take the revelation of this day get into prayer and you watch what the devil is doing now or or you you you'll see what the devil is doing and be able to defeat now that the brother bradam says those Believers had that Revelation without the opening of the book that's right they had that Revelation there was no one there was there was no one there to encourage them and say keep on you've got the open book they just simply had something deep down in their heart that they were going to resist that old devil that was trying to take the love of God out of their out of their bosom leoty has lost a lot of resistance they resisting the word of God instead of resisting the powers of Satan and that's what we're needing to do the resist anything that'll well praise the Lord any devil that that tries to put that that's trying to put a a cold blanket on my hot love for the Lord anything that is trying to take away my joy take away my peace take away my love take away my health take away my family take away my husband take away my children I am going to resist amen can you say Amen now now again let let's go back to uh page 224 and and let's start there at the second verse uh uh second uh paragraph again it says I Know Thy works and the last more than the first this is remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor role of Martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more their faith increased how tragic it was for the Vision sh uh age love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age in the darkest of all they served him with even more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of this gracious service of Love unto the Lord but rather an increasing of it that is the secret let the enemy attempt to for our service to the Lord our reply is increased service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout Victory he says I Know Thy works and the last is more than the first now as we have already said this age is the Dark Ages because it was indeed the darkest period of all history it was the age of Pope Innocent 3 who claimed that he was the viker of Christ Supreme Sovereign over the church and the world who instituted the Inquisition which under his Direction shed more blood than at any other time time except in the Reformation it was the age of uh pornocracy the rule of harlots sagis three had a mistress and filled the paple choir with uh paramor and bastard sons and turned the paple palace into a Dean a den of robbers anastasius 3 was smothered to death by Moriah who was mistress to Saras John 11 was uh moraz illegitimate son John 12 was the grandson of uh marazia and he violated widows and virgins and was killed while in the act of adultery by the woman's enraged uh husband in the age of papism for two lines of popes one ruling uh from abidan and the other from Rome cursed and fought each other these popes were not only guilty of immoral sex acts fing scores of illegitimate children committing sodomy and Etc but were guilty of selling Priestly offices to the highest bitters it was the age when the light glowed ever so faintly yet the few Believers labored more fervently as the darkness increased until the until toward the end of the age many arose attempting reforms their labors were so fervent that they paved the way for the oncoming Reformation therefore as the word says concerning this age your last the End of the Age works are more than the first the word thra and again and again the the darker it goes amen the more fervently they were and look at our age we have we have an opportunity to shine like no other Age come on now and the only way you're going to do it is now anybody can go to church anyone can sing anyone can do do those things but the spirit of the Lord within you him performing himself through you is what he is after amen now he says the word thara has various meanings amongst which continual uh which is continual Sacrifice by many this is believed to be a prophecy concerning the use of the mass which is continual presentation of the sacrifice of Christ that is an excellent thought but it might also mean the continual sacrifice in lives and labors of the True Believers of the Lord surely these tharan saints were the cream of the crop full of the Holy Ghost in faith created under good works showing forth his praise holding not their lives dear unto themselves but gladly giving their all as a Sweet Sacrifice unto the Lord the rebuke Revelations 20 and 20 uh 2 and 20 not with understanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest tolerate that woman Jezebel which calls herself a prophet us to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to Idols now with this verse I want to drop down to the 23rd and see the proof of the great truth of a great truth I have been bringing to your attention all along I will kill her children with Death and All all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the Reigns and hearts I have been saying right along that there are actually two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they were but one here it is plainly stated that there are churches it it and it states just as plainly that some of those churches most EV evidently do not know that he is the one who searches Reigns in the hearts he is going to prove to them that it is so now now then when the what churches will be those uh that do not know this truth of course it is the false Vine group because the True Believers certainly know the judgment begins at the house of God and they being God-fearing judging themselves uh that they be not judged now why does God call these churches his churches even though they are the false Vine the truth of the matter is they are Christians but they are not Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain Mark 7:7 how be it in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of G of of men but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be a muhammadan is a muhammadan that is his religion no matter how he lives because it subscribes in in theory to what the Quran teaches in the same way a Christian is a Christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the son of God born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is the savior of mankind Etc in fact in the Le Osan age there will be those who call themselves Christians because they subscribe to the Fine qualities of Jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity Christian Scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel he is a nominal Christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true spiritual believer that kind of a Believer is one who has been baptized into the body of Christ and is a member of him but nonetheless it is it is in God's order that the tears grow up with the wheat and there are uh and they are not to be U rooted that is the command of God their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet so the spirit is speaking to the mixed group on one hand he is praising on the other hand he is rebuking he has told what is right with the True Believer and now he wants the false Vine uh he uh he warns what the false Vine must do if it is to stand Justified before the Lord can you say Amen now now the the it's a it's it's we we never want to um never never never again going back to harden never let your heart get so hardened that that the word coming across the pull pit the word you're reading in your devotions and the spirit of the Lord that deals with your heart when you're outside these doors when he's speaking to you never let your heart get so hardened that you can ignore what the spirit of the Lord is if he's dealing with you and telling you you've got to stop something stop now don't don't prolong something and keep something going on that that's the spirit of the Antichrist it was it it it's the spirit it's that Antichrist spirit that is fixed to take over now now now listen we're living in the day as as as as we've said the the the man of sin is fixing to make a a covenant with the Jews I mean the Jews are fixing the the the the the stage is getting set to where the man of sin will will be the one that is that that is going to make this and and remember brother brother bradam says now there was the um he says there was the Antichrist Spirit then there was the false prophet and he says and then he's going to Incarnate himself in a man and he will become a beast so so that spirit is here that spirit is a prophet and it's teaching you to go against this just as God's holy spirit has sent us a prophet to to teach us to come back to the word are y'all understanding so so when the Holy Spirit that's that's the reason why I I I say it's it's those little foxes that spoil the vine if the spirit of the Lord says something in his word don't push it another day don't push it another minute obey the spirit of the Lord stay behind that fortification and you can't fail that's right but I promise promise p r o m i s e I promise if you go about things your own way you will fail 100% you're going to fail well I just don't I don't think it matters brother Wendell he knows my heart come on we're not legalistic if the scripture gives you something and the Holy Spirit is correcting you and it's coming across the pull pit either by tape or behind the pull pit here and it's given to you by scripture don't question it obey it am now Authority remember uh uh I I read it two Wednesday nights ago where where where brother bradam says we would it would be the spirit of lawlessness that would rule in this last day remember the spirit and that's the time that's the place where he's calling his bride out of this lawlessness there's a bride who is submissive to him that that's that's the Paradox that's that's what is so crazy is while the world is filled with this Antichrist spirit yet the bride has got a softness toward him that is saying thy will be done in my life I want you to Lead Me Guide Me protect me I want your covering over me can you say Amen yes so that's what the spirit of the Lord is doing and there's where you young people are so stinking blessed amen you you're blessed to have to to to have the words of Life given to you and to show you how to overcome and I appreciate I appreciate the mamas and daddies amen living their life showing their children how to overcome amen man my you you you boys and girls ain't overcoming just to overcome you you you have to be taught how to overcome that's why we come to church and then and and and and you hear it across the pull pit but but don't don't live a double standard life Mom and Daddy when you're going outside the doors there and you ain't living you ain't living an overcoming life let show those kids how to put the word of God into action through your lives not your opinions well well I I don't believe I and so listen I don't want my kids acting like me as if I'm the supreme authority no way my kids must know this is the supreme authority and I want them to hear me say I'm wrong and he's right amen I think our wives need to hear that too amen our husbands need to hear that too we want to be right with him amen amen can you say Amen so we're going to start we're going to stop right there and then and then next week we're going to hit uh that woman Jezebel and uh then we'll start getting in some we'll start getting in some good stuff well we I I I love the F Tire in church age there's so much good stuff brother brother Harry car uh covered a whole bunch of that the other night and um and and so I thought that I would take take this portion here after after God gives amen uh he's he's making a he's setting the stage he's setting the stage that here here here is the false and here is the true and the false will always persecute the true how does the how does the false persecute the true well back then they were killing them they they were killing them but remember in leosia it's not guns and bullets and knives and swords and and gas chamber no no it's a totally different effect so Satan has anointed his false Vine amen and make them all churchy and we all sing the same songs we all play guitars and piano we all we all cry when we we all we have altars we have all those things now the false looks just like the real in worship amen hallelujah I don't I don't I it it's got to the point where I don't call their stuff worship at all I just a bunch of Hallelujah bunch of clowns up there on the on the and they're all dancing and doing their stuff and giving glory to God they're giving glory to their God all right but if you want to give glory to the to the Lord Jesus Christ follow his word be humble be pure be honest be undefiled love your neighbor even when they do you wrong love them anyway shine a light on your job oh but your boss your boss ain't doing your right show them how how show them that you're the big person love them anyhow amen I I I you know I was one of those guys that just you know maybe I was wrong amen but but I I told my boys someone hitting you amen turn around and walk off don't hit them back amen turn around and walk walk off live live this that show who you are we're not vindictive let God fight for me let God uh uh uh uh uh uh cause amen uh victories to come in my in my walk because listen when I get hard in my spirit and I'm and I'm defending my rights it's going to be hard for me to pray it's going to be hard and we're defending our rights and then when we pray we can't feel his presence come to church it's just another service others are being blessed but we can't be blessed because you have been hardened by the deceitfulness of sin that's scripture hardened by the deceitfulness of sin the open book has shown us how Satan works we are Overcomers because God God has been so faithful in this last day to open that Bible and tell us exactly where Satan's Playbook is aren't you glad for that hallelujah amen the first remember under those seals it was that white horse a and and he was a deceiver and that and and and remember that same Rider jumps off that horse and comes on to the red horse and then that Rider it's the same Rider he jumps off of that horse and jumps onto the black horse and then that Rider jumps off the Black Horse and comes to the Pale Horse and remember the prophet taught us that the Pale Horse is a mixture of the white and the red and the black so all of the powers that were in the White Horse all of the powers that was in the red horse all of the powers that was in the black horse is now on this Pale Horse and that same demon that that has that has been plaguing the church through these 2,000 years he's got all of the powers of hell right here right now and he's trying to fight every one of you and yet God says I'm going to have a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish God says I'm going to take a bride she's going to be my very own how is he going to do it he has given us his word oh how many loves him here tonight amen if the musicians would come amen love him tonight so we we we want to draw close to him soft Spirits soft Spirits attracts you to God now remember uh um I believe I believe it was the sermon was titled the ark and um is that right is there is there a sermon titled the ark amen I I thought it was may maybe maybe it's not hallelujah amen I want to use a phone for what it's supposed to be used for [Music] amen there is a title named The Ark so so there is the the ark and brother brandom goes through there talking about and he and he and he and he talks about how that the ark was made of of uh pliable wood and and and and that's something that um um I I think it would do us all good it's it's a real it's a real good message but but he but when he when he was when he was making this Battleship when he was when he was making this thing that was going to survive all of the Judgment he took the most porous and softest of wood he took that soft wood to make this Battleship out of and brother Brandon says it don't even seem it don't even seem logical it don't seem wise at all but God told him to cut down the AA tree uh uh uh or um um anyways uh C cut down the tree and and then he was then he was to take the evergreen tree and he was to beat that evergreen tree and and get all the resin out of the Evergreen heat it up and then pour it over that porous wood now now that soft wood it would soak up anything it it would soak up water it would soak whatever you would put on it so he had to be careful in building this and then and then he would pitch it with with that with that resin or that that uh sap out of the evergreen tree and it soaked it all up in it and then it made it it made it indestructible did matter if it hit rocks didn't matter if it hit this or that as it's it's going through the waters logs were to hit it it was it was indestructible and God has made his church he's taken soft pliable Hearts not hard not men that women that's demanding their own rights not boys and girls I'm going to do it my I'm going to demand my way yeah no one's going to hurt me listen if you got the blood of Jesus that's what the blood of Jesus Christ is there for is to cover over all the bruises and all the hurts and the fiery darts right we we don't want to we don't want to be resistant he takes those soft our soft hearts that the devil can come in and fill it with pornography you can feel it with bad music you Bo that you got your phones or whatever don't be playing that bad music don't be playing that country and that rock that is wrong don't put anything ungodly or filthy in your mind and ears you're a sponge you're made you're made to do this you're made to soak up God Made You to soak up his love he's made you to soak up his righteousness You're Made For That [Music] now now this is so important that's why you come to church some people said in the community a a Christian and I and I believe he is a real genuine Christian I I I do he don't see things like I do but I I I I you all know him and he come and told me he [Music] says I Isaiah he says I believe in letting my boys go to public school so they can be witness and I said I believe in protecting my sons and these young people so that they can soak up the presence of God he goes well I think you're missing it so now we fast [Music] forward and his sons are struggling they they they got they lost their way early and and and still waiting for them to come back home now here's and I and he's he listen he's a he's a he loves the Lord but I just happen to think the way that I my my theory the way that I feel about it I believe it gives all you young people more of a chance I know I know you want to go out there and play with the you know go go out there and play with the kids and and and on the playground and you miss maybe some of that kind of those kind of activities and and uh uh uh you know but you've got a wonderful opportunity here in with your homeschooling you got a mama that's loves you you live in a house that's protected you got you got Christian music you got the message playing and you've got an opportunity yourselves and I'm I and that's all of you uh you young people whether you're 20 years old or whether you're five it it you you you have this opportunity in your home to shut the [Music] door kneel down before God and I still believe that good oldfashioned kneeling down is appropriate kneel down and say Lord here's my heart don't let the devil Harden me I want your presence in me I want you to forgive me of my sins forgive me of the words or my actions or thoughts clean me up and forgive me and he's always Johnny on the spot he'll forgive you he'll forgive you but don't stop there say Lord I want you to show yourself to me I want to be a light I want your spirit in me I want your word to live in me I want a relationship with [Music] you and you might sit around and you might [Music] think hello are you there and you might not feel him and the reason is is because of the hardness of this AG age you've already got a lot of junk you got all your games you've got your videos you've got you you guys have have watched movies you've got and you've already sitting down there before God and you're finding yourself hardened already at Young [Music] ages but you guys are going to hit the age where you're going to need God to help you to overcome lust lying stealing you're going to deep G and the only way that God's going to be able to help you is if you've got a soft heart and that means quit putting the things of this world in you while you're young and take advantage of spending time with God at this early age that's why that's why you children get to stay home that's why you children get to have a home life you're not torn from pillar to poting up and gone you know out out early in the morning no while you're young you're still home get get get your get your Bible out spend time prayer mama don't be out shopping all the time don't take that away from these kids while they're [Music] young you know I prayed with Mom and Dad all the time and it was fine but I got to tell you some of my best of praying as a kid and even now is when I'm by myself and I'll go shut the door hard for me to kneel on my knees anymore will arthritis in them I'll just sit I'll sit down when y'all see me praying I most of the time I'm sitting down instead of kneeling but it is still a sign of surrender that's [Music] right and I just talk to the Lord Lord I I I want you and here's the deal if you don't feel it the first time you kneel down to pray we don't go by feelings but I am here to tell you there is a difference in praying and praying there is a difference in just saying words and then entering into the presence of God to where you know you're there and you you listen your soul can feel it there there there is an expression that begins to take hold you know when you're in the presence of God it's not just uttering words and many many many many many don't know how to enter in they just want to do it legalistically okay all right I'll give you five minutes here tell you all everything I need to tell you and then okay let's go let's get out let's do things no stof be soft be pable [Music] say Lord I'm coming back tomorrow I talk to him just like it I tell him I tell him Lord I want to come and meet you the same time tomorrow I need a visit visit with you I need to hear from you my spirit's still in an uproar I I I I I couldn't hear from you today Lord I got to go I'll be here tomorrow I can't tell you how many times God has just come down on the scene and I felt this presence just washed me over and over and over and over this presence comes down over me takes away my hurts gives me A New Perspective in life takes away depression takes away those things Satan don't want you entering into that he don't want us entering into that and so he's got this age here where those Spirits are hitting us every which direction with knowledge with your phones and computers and now these stupid computer games and all of these things going on and it keeps us so busy until our heart is hardened M and daddies we've got to work at that we I'm talking to the kids but oh M and daddies how we needed he still is the answer he still is the answer Jesus is the answer the same I I know they say he's the answer I mean I I don't blame the world for turning against Christianity it's all it's all a just a big it's it's just a big uh fairy tale it's like Buddha and it and and and and and and Muhammad and all of these Christianity's just become a a a a little prayer for five minutes and and come and give money to the church he Christianity Christianity is Jesus loving you you loving him that's what Christianity is [Music] about this is The False age the false Vine is matured religion has come to its peak I don't want to have a church service like they do on the internet I don't want to I don't want to be like what they do I want a reality of Jesus right here every day of my [Music] life amen Kobe gets me up here so I can up here early so I don't hold you a long time and then I take advantage of it and stay up here a long time anyways amen relationship [Music] I love it men and women M and daddies don't go another day with a hard [Music] heart tell the Lord where you want to meet him at he'll meet you brother Bram says when he's invited he will always show up you might not feel him because of your Hardness of Heart but determined Lord soften me I want to tell you I love you whether I feel you or not I know you're here you said you'd be [Music] here coming back tomorrow you'll find he's cracking that heart get into

we become powerful let's bow our heads in prayer we thank you Lord for your [Music] love I feel your presence Lord is the praise was given to the elect of the th tyan age and oh how you oh how you praised him that no matter how dark and no matter how much evil you praised them for their love and their faithfulness and their service we're going to hear that someday Lord you said Lord that we would hear well done When sin has has reached his climax when Satan has just comeing so intertwined into the church until it's just one big conglomerate mess and it looks like this is we're not careful we accept that as the norm you said Lord you're not coming after a lukewarm or a cold but you're coming after one that is fire hot we want to be fervent in our prayer we want to be fervent in our love to you our hardness of our hearts things that we allow I ask that you would take your blood washes soften our Spirits so that we can feel your presence and know that you are near and that we
