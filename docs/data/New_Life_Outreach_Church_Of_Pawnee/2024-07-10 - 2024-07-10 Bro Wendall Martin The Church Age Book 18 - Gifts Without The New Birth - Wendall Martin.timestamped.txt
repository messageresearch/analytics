[21:58] everyone back back home amen if you've
[22:01] been missing a while and we just say God
[22:03] bless you let's look here in the
[22:05] scriptures the Hebrews the 6th chapter
[22:08] amen and um we are uh we're going to be
[22:12] reading out of the church age book um
[22:16] we're going to read on
[22:19] 167 page
[22:22] 167 and um we've been we've been dealing
[22:25] with the gifts these last uh few uh uh
[22:29] Wednesday nights and um so we want to uh
[22:35] we're going to continue on that
[22:37] tonight and um but let's let's look here
[22:42] at at Hebrews 6 and four now we've been
[22:47] dealing with what the what it's supposed
[22:49] to be amen the gifts came from God the
[22:53] gifts are ordained of God the gifts
[22:56] belong to the church the gifts are of
[22:59] God Amen got to be operated right but
[23:02] they are 100% of God that's right but
[23:04] the devil can also come in amen and
[23:08] imitate these things and and um so let's
[23:12] look here we're going to talk we're
[23:13] going to deal with that a little bit
[23:14] here tonight here in Hebrews 6 and 4 for
[23:18] it is
[23:19] impossible for those who were once
[23:22] enlightened and have tasted of the
[23:24] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[23:27] the Holy ghost and have tasted of the
[23:31] good word of God and the powers of the
[23:35] world to come if they shall fall away to
[23:40] renew them again unto repentance seeing
[23:44] they crucify to themselves the Son of
[23:46] God aresh and put him to an open shame
[23:49] now some people say see you can
[23:51] backslide you can so salvation isn't
[23:54] secure no keep on keep on reading on
[23:57] down for the Earth which drinketh in the
[24:00] rain that cometh off upon it bringeth
[24:04] forth herbs meat for them by whom it is
[24:08] dressed and receiveth blessings from God
[24:11] but that which beareth thorns and Briars
[24:15] is rejected and is nigh into cursing
[24:18] whose end is to be burned amen and
[24:22] beloved we are persuaded better things
[24:24] of you and things that accompany
[24:26] salvation though we the speak so so we
[24:30] can see there's two different seeds here
[24:33] receiving the same rain the same
[24:36] Sunshine but bringing two totally
[24:40] different results let's go to the Lord
[24:42] in prayer father we thank you tonight
[24:44] for your love and your blessings thank
[24:46] you for your your call Upon Our Lives
[24:50] Lord and the Revelation that you have
[24:53] given us in this day to give us a
[24:56] security Lord to give to know where our
[24:59] feet are are planted and father I'm just
[25:02] asking that you would bless us in our
[25:04] readings tonight Lord and just ask that
[25:06] every word that is spoke every scripture
[25:09] that is read everything that we read out
[25:11] of the church age book lord that it
[25:13] would be used of you to to uh Enlighten
[25:17] our hearts and settle our hearts in you
[25:20] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can
[25:23] the church say amen amen and amen God
[25:26] bless you you may be seated here here
[25:28] this evening I'd like to start out with
[25:30] reading um with with reading this we
[25:33] read this this uh passage um three weeks
[25:36] ago and um but we're going to now go
[25:40] back and deal with some of this I wanted
[25:42] to I wanted to come back and deal with
[25:45] the gifts in the church amen and and how
[25:48] many how many understands that the gifts
[25:51] were in the first church amen they were
[25:54] all in the first church with the book of
[25:56] Acts is is is just amen from the very
[26:00] beginning to the very ending the nine
[26:02] spiritual gifts were in operation Gifts
[26:05] of power anointing was there amen but
[26:10] Satan has can come in because we are
[26:14] Spirit beings amen and and and can
[26:17] infiltrate the church and and and if
[26:21] you're not careful you're not able to
[26:24] you're not able to determine what is God
[26:26] and what isn't God amen and so brother
[26:30] brother brandham is telling the story
[26:33] and we're going to start there at the
[26:34] second paragraph at 16 page 167 it says
[26:39] many years ago when I first came across
[26:41] the Pentecostal people I was in one of
[26:44] their camp meetings where there was much
[26:46] manifestation of tongues and
[26:48] interpretation of tongues and prophecy
[26:50] two preachers in particular were engaged
[26:53] in this kind of speaking more than any
[26:56] of the other Brethren I th enjoyed the
[26:58] services and was truly interested in the
[27:01] various
[27:03] manifestations for they had a ring of
[27:05] reality to them it was my Earnest desire
[27:09] to learn all that I
[27:10] could about these gifts so I decided to
[27:14] talk to the two men about them and
[27:16] through the gift of God resident in me I
[27:18] sought to know the spirit in the first
[27:20] man whether he was truly of God or not
[27:23] after a brief conversation with that
[27:25] sweet humble brother I knew that he was
[27:27] a genuine solid Christian he was real
[27:30] the next young man was not at all like
[27:33] the first one he was boastful and proud
[27:37] and as I spoke to him a vision moved
[27:39] across my eyes and I saw that he was
[27:41] married to a blonde lady but living with
[27:44] a brunette and had two children by her
[27:47] and if ever there was a hypocrite he was
[27:49] one now let me tell you I was shocked
[27:53] how could I not be here were two men one
[27:57] of uh one of which was a real believer
[28:00] and the other was a sinful impersonator
[28:03] yet both were manifesting gifts of the
[28:07] Spirit I was troubled by this confusion
[28:09] and I left the meeting to seek God for
[28:11] the answer I went alone to a secret
[28:13] place and there with my Bible I prayed
[28:16] and waited on God for the answer not
[28:19] knowing just what portion of scripture
[28:22] to read I casually open the Bible to
[28:24] some place in Matthew I read for a while
[28:27] and then laid the the Bible down in a
[28:29] moment a wind blew into the room and
[28:31] turned the pages of the Bible to Hebrews
[28:34] the 6th chapter I read it through and
[28:37] Par and was particularly impressed by
[28:40] those strange verses that we just got
[28:42] through reading for it is impossible for
[28:44] those who were once enlightened and have
[28:46] tasted the Heavenly gift and were made
[28:48] partakers of the Holy Ghost and have
[28:50] tasted of the good word of God and the
[28:53] powers of the world to come if they
[28:55] should fall away to renew them again and
[28:58] repentance seeing they crucify to
[29:00] themselves the Son of God aresh and put
[29:02] him to an open shame for the Earth which
[29:05] drinketh in the rain that cometh of upon
[29:07] it and bringeth forth herbs meat for
[29:11] them by whom it is dressed receiveth
[29:13] blessing from God but that which beareth
[29:16] thorns and Briars is rejected and is
[29:19] nigh into cursing whose end is to be
[29:21] burned but beloved we are persuaded
[29:23] better things of you things that
[29:26] accompany salvation though we thus speak
[29:29] I closed the Bible laid it down
[29:31] meditated on it a while and prayed some
[29:33] more I still had no answer I again open
[29:36] the Bible aimlessly but did not read
[29:39] suddenly the wind blew into the room
[29:41] again and once more the pages turned to
[29:43] Hebrew six and remained there as the
[29:46] wind ceased I read those words over
[29:49] again and when I did then come the
[29:51] spirit of God into the room and I beheld
[29:53] a vision I saw in the vision a man
[29:56] dressed with the purest
[29:58] white who went forth into a freshly
[30:01] plowed field and sold grain it was a
[30:04] bright day and the sewing was done in
[30:06] the morning but late at night after the
[30:09] sewer in the white had gone a man in
[30:12] Black came and steeply sowed some more
[30:15] seed amongst that which the man and
[30:17] white had sown the days went by the Sun
[30:20] and Rain blessed the ground one day
[30:23] there appeared the grain how fine it was
[30:26] but a day later appeared the
[30:28] tears the wheat and tears grew together
[30:32] they partook of the same nourishment out
[30:34] of the same soil they drank in the same
[30:37] sun and
[30:39] Rain then one day the skies turned brass
[30:42] and all the plants and the plants all
[30:44] began to droop and die and I I heard the
[30:48] wheat lift their heads and cry to God
[30:50] for rain the tears also lifted their
[30:53] voices and pleaded for rain then the
[30:55] skies darkened and the rain came and
[30:58] again the wheat now full of strength
[31:00] lifted up their voices and cried in
[31:01] adoration praise the Lord and to my
[31:05] wonderment I heard the revived Terror
[31:08] Terrors also look up and say
[31:11] hallelujah then I knew the truth of the
[31:14] camp meeting and the vision the parable
[31:17] of the sewer and the seed the sixth
[31:19] chapter of Hebrews and the evident
[31:22] manifestation of the spiritual gifts in
[31:24] the mixed audience all became
[31:26] wonderfully clear the s in white was the
[31:29] Lord the swer in Black was the devil the
[31:33] world was the field the seeds were
[31:35] people elect and rebates both partook of
[31:38] the same nourishment water and Sun both
[31:41] prayed both received help from God for
[31:44] he maketh his son and Reign to fall on
[31:47] the good and evil though they both had
[31:49] the same wonderful blessing and both had
[31:53] the same wonderful manifestations there
[31:55] was still one great differ they were of
[31:59] different seed here also was the answer
[32:02] to Matthew 7:21-23
[32:05] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[32:08] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[32:09] heaven but he that doeth my the will of
[32:12] My Father which is in heaven many will
[32:15] say to me in that day Lord Lord have we
[32:19] not C prophesied in thy name in thy name
[32:23] have cast out devils in thy name done
[32:26] many wonderful works
[32:29] then will I profess unto them I never
[32:32] knew you depart from me you that work
[32:35] iniquity Jesus does not deny that they
[32:39] did the mighty works that only the Holy
[32:43] Ghost can accomplish by way of men but
[32:46] he did deny ever knowing them they were
[32:50] not backsliders somebody say they
[32:52] weren't
[32:54] backsliders these were Wicked unre
[32:57] generate
[32:59] rebates these were the seed of Satan
[33:02] right and there it is now he's going to
[33:05] tell us you can't claim the
[33:09] manifestation is the evidence of being
[33:12] Spirit born Spirit field no sir I will
[33:16] admit that the true manifestation is the
[33:19] evidence of the Holy Spirit doing Mighty
[33:22] acts but it is not the evidence of the
[33:25] individual being Spirit-filled
[33:27] even though that individual has an
[33:29] abundance of
[33:31] manifestations can you say Amen now now
[33:35] we want to to look at this for for a few
[33:38] moments here tonight and uh brother Merl
[33:41] had mentioned here a couple of U uh two
[33:45] or three Wednesday nights ago to um it
[33:47] mention the anointed ones at the end
[33:49] time has anyone got to got got to go
[33:51] back and and and listen to that I would
[33:54] encourage um good some of you have uh I
[33:57] went back and listened to it I'd
[33:58] encourage everyone to go back and listen
[34:00] to it and and and when you're listening
[34:03] to these tapes don't don't
[34:05] listen um don't listen to the tapes and
[34:09] and then let your mind wander off if if
[34:11] you can only listen 30 minutes at a time
[34:13] do that but but just but I want you to
[34:16] catch everything that brother brandom is
[34:19] saying because that anointed one at the
[34:21] end time brother Bram is saying the Holy
[34:23] Ghost is saying a lot uh through that
[34:26] prophet and and so um but I want us I
[34:30] want us to to look tonight now now first
[34:33] of all the the gifts of of the the pro
[34:37] uh uh prophets amen and the gifts of
[34:40] Prophecy is not new to the New Testament
[34:43] amen there was Gifts of Prophecy in the
[34:46] Old Testament in fact there were Gifts
[34:48] of healing in the Old Testament there
[34:51] there were the gift of wisdom in the Old
[34:54] Testament everything that was in the New
[34:58] Testament we can go back and find it in
[35:01] the Old Testament amen God does never
[35:04] God never changes his approach if he is
[35:07] a Healer in the New Testament he was a
[35:10] Healer in the Old Testament if he was a
[35:12] prophesier in the New Testament he was a
[35:15] prophesier in the Old Testament amen
[35:17] Gifts of wisdom Gifts of knowledge all
[35:20] of those amen were manifest the only
[35:23] difference is amen is is today you have
[35:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[35:31] Holy Ghost is within you manifesting
[35:34] himself through you amen amen and so the
[35:39] the the the the word now now there's not
[35:42] there's a difference in a gift of
[35:44] Prophecy and a word
[35:46] Prophet a word born Prophet amen he was
[35:50] he was the special built man amen that
[35:55] that could commune with God and and and
[35:58] hear from God directly he was one that
[36:01] could amen that could go into a total
[36:04] different realm and and and that's how
[36:08] the Bible was wrote through through a
[36:10] word born prophet he was raised for a
[36:14] Divine Purpose he was sent to a specific
[36:17] age to declare that age but also forell
[36:21] amen of things that were we off in the
[36:24] future kingdoms Rose kingdoms
[36:28] by the words of that word Prophet can
[36:32] you say Amen now now prophecies amen the
[36:36] gift of prophecies were amen
[36:40] uh were were men that would would be
[36:43] used and and all throughout the Old
[36:45] Testament uh the the Lord would tell
[36:47] them of of of of of what the enemy was
[36:50] doing the Lord would amen would give
[36:52] them Direction and and and and many of
[36:55] wonderful things through the through the
[36:57] gift of Prophecy and so what I want to
[37:00] deal with here tonight amen I I want
[37:03] first of all I want to establish that
[37:06] that prophecy was used in the Old
[37:08] Testament by ordinary men that were
[37:11] Beyond just just word prophets but yet
[37:14] those
[37:16] prophesied to line their prophecies up
[37:20] with the word prophit that's right they
[37:24] had to line theirselves up with the word
[37:26] of God can you understand what I'm
[37:29] saying so if you were going if you had a
[37:31] gift amen it in the Old Testament it was
[37:35] still required for you to line yourself
[37:38] up with what God was doing through that
[37:41] word prophet and through the scriptures
[37:44] of that day amen can you say Amen now
[37:49] now there're there're in and and I want
[37:52] you to write these down because I got a
[37:53] lot of scriptures here and we're not
[37:54] going to read them all to you tonight
[37:56] cuz I I want to uh
[37:58] I want to get a we're going to do a lot
[38:00] of reading but amen um the Jeremiah 285
[38:05] through n and y'all write this down I
[38:07] want I want y'all to make sure you go
[38:08] back and look at it amen and and and and
[38:13] the Lord is saying the way that you know
[38:16] that uh that I've spoken is to watch if
[38:20] the prophecy comes to pass you you you
[38:25] you you can you can tell if there is a
[38:28] consistency in in what the Lord does now
[38:32] amen Deuteronomy 13
[38:34] 1-5 it says now if a man
[38:38] prophesies and it comes to pass and he
[38:42] teaches something contrary to what the
[38:45] prophets and the the the word has
[38:48] already said then count that man a false
[38:53] prophet right take him out and kill him
[38:57] Hallelujah that's the way they dealt
[38:58] with their false prophets so so if a man
[39:02] says something and it comes to pass and
[39:06] yet he is teaching contrary to scripture
[39:09] that's in Deuteronomy 13 1:5 amen then
[39:13] then he says then it is then do not
[39:16] follow now now we're fixing a show a
[39:21] repeate with an anointing to be able to
[39:25] see things predict things
[39:28] and still be and and still split hell
[39:30] wide open right amen now you you catch
[39:35] that you don't follow gifted men you
[39:39] follow the word of
[39:41] God there's been a lot of gifted men who
[39:43] were with brother brandham and they used
[39:46] that amen and and they were gifted they
[39:48] were gifted men but they didn't they
[39:49] weren't they weren't accurate on they
[39:51] they missed it they missed it half the
[39:53] time and yet they have they they have
[39:56] they have lured people amen and and told
[39:59] well I was with the prophet and you got
[40:01] to listen to me and and I or it's it's
[40:04] just death or it's going to be doomed
[40:06] that man is a false prophet no man will
[40:10] ever pull any pull anybody to himself he
[40:14] will always point to the word of God
[40:18] Amen and if he doesn't point to the word
[40:21] of God then he's false amen can you say
[40:24] Amen now Deuteronomy 18 20 through 22 it
[40:29] says now it it's dealing with the man
[40:31] that that
[40:33] prophesies and it doesn't come to pass
[40:37] amen and he'll say fear me you got to
[40:39] fear me amen he says if the and he says
[40:42] you are not responsible to follow that
[40:46] man if he says it and it doesn't come to
[40:49] pass mark it off and the Bible says ston
[40:53] him amen so so uh it was it wasn't a
[40:57] good deal to be a false prophet praise
[40:59] the Lord and and so we we we um that's
[41:04] not that that's not the kind of U
[41:07] amen work that we want to be in now
[41:11] again the the the scripture says now
[41:14] what did the scripture says in the last
[41:15] days sister kala if You' put that uh
[41:18] Matthew
[41:19] 24:24 in the last days when he's talking
[41:22] about the perilous times and it's
[41:24] talking about all the signs of the end
[41:25] time he says there's going to be false
[41:27] Christ false prophets which shall
[41:31] show great signs and wonders in so much
[41:37] if it were possible it would deceive the
[41:40] very elect now brother brandham would
[41:42] say now how could they deceive he says
[41:45] it would be an a genuine
[41:49] gift a genuine and somebody that is able
[41:53] Amen to reach up into those other reals
[41:57] and come back and tell you things amen
[42:01] that are that that they gen it's a
[42:04] genuine anointing upon
[42:06] them amen hallelujah if the the if the
[42:11] Old Testament people who were
[42:14] unregenerate how many how many knows
[42:16] that there was no one in the Old
[42:17] Testament filled with the Holy
[42:19] Ghost amen they did not but it was men
[42:24] that that had gifts gifts and callings
[42:27] of God are without repentance amen so so
[42:31] the was these were men that could tap
[42:34] into the supernatural even though they
[42:37] they did not have the Holy Ghost and it
[42:40] is so today that there's going to be men
[42:43] who can tap into that
[42:45] Supernatural and yet split hell wide
[42:49] open amen amen so uh uh there in Romans
[42:54] 11 and 29 again the gifts
[42:57] and callings of God are without
[43:01] repentance that that means you can have
[43:03] a gift and you hav't even you're still a
[43:05] sinner yeah right praise the Lord amen
[43:12] now Matthew 5 and and 45 we we we've
[43:16] just established that you you he makes
[43:19] his he makes his uh uh son to rise on
[43:22] the evil and the good and he sends his
[43:25] Reign on the just and and the unjust
[43:28] amen now now now while we're hitting
[43:31] this here tonight this does not take
[43:34] away from the honeste hearted genuine
[43:39] Sons and Daughters of God who have
[43:41] genuine Gifts of of Prophecy who have
[43:45] genuine manifestations of God Amen and
[43:49] and I I and I I I you know I as I have
[43:52] been thinking about this here I've
[43:53] thought you know in the way that we
[43:55] present it amen sometimes you can
[43:57] present it so hard amen because what we
[44:00] do is as preachers many of times Amen in
[44:03] in the message and I and I've been
[44:05] guilty of that because I came out of a
[44:07] lot of nonsense in Pentecost and so I
[44:10] find myself in those early years
[44:12] especially just I mean I I was I was
[44:16] hammering the gifts and and what I was
[44:19] doing though amen I was taking all of
[44:22] the quotes where brother Brandon was
[44:24] really amen hammering those things and
[44:27] leaving out the quotes where brother
[44:29] Bram was saying they belong in the
[44:32] church and so what we do is our younger
[44:35] generation comes up amen and they don't
[44:38] want they don't know nothing about it
[44:39] they don't want I'm here to tell you
[44:41] tonight we welcome the Holy Ghost and we
[44:45] welcome however he wants to use
[44:49] us amen if if if if the Lord comes upon
[44:53] you all to speak in tongues don't don't
[44:56] don't Hinder that raise your hands and
[44:59] just speak in tongues if the Lord gives
[45:01] you now if the Lord gives you uh if you
[45:05] feel like you have a prophecy well you
[45:06] don't just blurt it out in front of
[45:08] everybody amen you you take that write
[45:11] that down and and and you and and your
[45:14] prophecy needs to be judged that's right
[45:18] well that's the way they taught it in in
[45:20] the Bible days can you say amen amen
[45:23] because what you're doing if you're not
[45:25] careful you're you know you you you get
[45:28] you get you get this one missing and
[45:30] that missing until everyone no no one's
[45:32] believing in the gifts at all and I want
[45:34] to tell you when you see what's going on
[45:36] in the Pentecostal world and how Trump
[45:38] was going to make it in and how this was
[45:40] going to happen and that's going to
[45:41] happen what does that do to people that
[45:42] just that just makes everyone that just
[45:44] makes everyone think that Christianity
[45:46] is a farce and that everyone you know
[45:48] this this just it's just it's not a
[45:51] farce the bride will do nothing until
[45:55] she has thus said the
[45:58] Lord but we don't Squatch the spirit of
[46:02] God that's right we're not going to say
[46:05] we the holy ghost isn't allowed here we
[46:08] want the Holy Ghost to work however he
[46:10] wants to
[46:11] work he's always welcome to work in his
[46:15] church can you say Amen now I I think I
[46:18] wanted to go through this for a little
[46:19] bit here tonight and I want I want you
[46:21] and everyone to turn there but I want
[46:23] you kids to look there too let's go to
[46:25] numbers 11 and 24 and we're going to
[46:28] read that
[46:29] together now the this this setting here
[46:33] um uh Moses has has uh he's just weary
[46:38] he's wore out if you if you read up he's
[46:41] complaining if you read the whole
[46:42] chapter he's complaining to the Lord you
[46:44] know you brought me out
[46:47] here I've got all these people and
[46:49] they're again they're hungry and and and
[46:52] this this is just too big of a load for
[46:54] me you I I'm need I I I I don't know
[46:58] what else to do and he's ask he's
[46:59] actually asking the Lord just let me die
[47:03] just just just just take me amen and and
[47:07] and the Lord tells Moses to gather the
[47:10] people together he says I want you to go
[47:12] choose amen 70 men and I want you to
[47:15] have them to come in and so here's here
[47:18] Moses is obeying the Lord amen and and
[47:21] um he he tells him there in 11 and 16 he
[47:23] says I want you to go and get these 70
[47:26] men I you to come in and and and um so
[47:29] now Moses went out and told the people
[47:32] the words of the Lord and gathered the
[47:34] 70
[47:35] men of the Elders of the people and set
[47:38] them round about the Temple of the
[47:40] Tabernacle and the Lord came down in a
[47:42] cloud and spake unto them and took of
[47:46] the spirit that was upon Him Moses and
[47:51] gave it unto the 70 elders and it came
[47:54] to pass that when the spirit rested upon
[47:57] them they prophesied and did not cease
[48:01] so so we find amen it wasn't an another
[48:05] Spirit it was the same spirit that was
[48:07] upon that Prophet the that Prophet that
[48:10] was ordained to take them into that land
[48:13] of promise it was not another Spirit but
[48:17] he took of The Same Spirit of the word
[48:20] profet in a small measure and gave it to
[48:25] those 70 men it was the spirit of wisdom
[48:28] and knowledge and
[48:30] prophecy they did they were not word
[48:34] prophets they had to line themselves up
[48:38] with the word prophet of that day you
[48:42] know what God's doing here today amen I
[48:45] I it it is under the umbrella or under
[48:48] the anointing of V 7th Church age
[48:53] anointing amen it's the open book
[48:56] anointing that we receive of are you
[49:00] understanding amen God has come and
[49:02] given us one Prophet somebody say one
[49:05] Prophet one Prophet to to to One Church
[49:08] age there's not two prophets there's one
[49:10] Prophet Amen to a church age then you
[49:13] and I then the anointing comes upon the
[49:16] five-fold ministry amen we are anointed
[49:20] to preach you say well we don't need you
[49:22] amen all we we all we need is Moses no
[49:26] God gave the anointing to those 70 and
[49:29] they came up under not another anointing
[49:33] but the anointing that was upon the
[49:35] prophet is now upon these 70 men to help
[49:40] carry out the work that God ordained
[49:44] am well I I like that amen I like that
[49:48] now and and then and then we'll we find
[49:51] out amen if you were the next the next
[49:54] verse that the spirit fell and some
[49:57] others amen that they didn't show up
[49:59] they didn't show up to the to the
[50:01] Tabernacle like was required of them and
[50:03] there were some others it says and there
[50:05] remained two of the men in the camp the
[50:07] name of the one was was elad and the
[50:10] name of the other midad and the spirit
[50:12] rested upon them and they were of them
[50:15] that were written but went not out unto
[50:17] the Tabernacle and they prophesied in
[50:20] the camp and there ran a young man and
[50:22] told Moses and said El dad me dad do
[50:25] prophesy in the camp and Joshua the son
[50:28] of num the servant of of Moses one of
[50:30] the young his young men answered and
[50:32] said my Lord Moses forbid them amen and
[50:36] Moses said unto them envest thou for my
[50:39] sake would God that all uh that that all
[50:42] the Lord's people were prophets and that
[50:44] the Lord would put his Spirit upon them
[50:47] and Moses got him into the camp he and
[50:50] the Elders of Israel so so here here is
[50:53] a here is a time in the scripture where
[50:55] the anoint ing the prophecy amen the
[50:59] spirit of the Lord was upon these men
[51:02] Amen to come and there were some that
[51:04] did not follow the command of Moses that
[51:07] actually the spirit of the Lord Came
[51:09] Upon
[51:11] anyways amen
[51:13] now now Moses would Moos God would speak
[51:17] with Moses am man there in in numbers 12
[51:20] and6 and and I want you to turn there
[51:22] too if you if you wouldn't mind uh
[51:25] numbers 12 12 and six and tell me when
[51:27] you when you get there Moses is or God
[51:30] is going to say now listen there's some
[51:32] of you that's going to have a gift of
[51:33] Prophecy or have a dream or have a
[51:36] vision but that's not the same as what
[51:39] I've called Moses for amen he says he
[51:42] said are y'all
[51:44] there amen uh numbers is is the U what
[51:48] is it fourth the fourth book of the of
[51:50] the Bible amen right Genesis yeah all
[51:56] right
[51:57] it says um uh hear now my words if there
[52:01] be a prophet among you I the Lord will
[52:04] make myself known unto him in a vision
[52:05] and will speak unto him in a dream my
[52:08] servant Moses is not so who is faithful
[52:11] in all my house with him will I speak
[52:13] mouth to mouth even apparently not in
[52:15] dark speeches and the similitude of the
[52:17] Lord shall he behold wherefore then were
[52:21] ye not afraid to speak against my

[53:35] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[53:38] things I write unto you are the

[56:08] killed all at one
[56:12] time

[59:23] let's let's look here in Numbers 22 if
[59:26] you kids haven't read
[59:28] that
[59:29] 22 and
[59:32] um and one and the children of Israel
[59:35] Set uh forward and pitched in the plains
[59:38] of Moab on this side of Jordan by
[59:41] Jericho and baac the son of zapor saw
[59:45] all that Israel had done to the amorites
[59:48] Moab was sore afraid of the people
[59:51] because they were many and Moab was
[59:54] distressed because the children of
[59:55] Israel
[59:56] and Moab said unto the Elders of Midian
[59:59] now this now shall this company lick up
[1:00:02] all that are around about us as the ox
[1:00:05] lith up the grass of the field and baac
[1:00:08] the son of zapor was the king of the
[1:00:10] moabites at that
[1:00:12] time and he sent Messengers therefore
[1:00:15] unto balum the son of bore to uh pathor
[1:00:19] which is which is by the river of the
[1:00:21] land of the of the children of of his
[1:00:24] people and to call him saying behold
[1:00:28] there is a people come out from Egypt
[1:00:31] behold they cover the face of the Earth
[1:00:33] and they abide over against me come now
[1:00:36] therefore I pray thee and curse me this
[1:00:38] people for they are too Mighty for me
[1:00:41] per Adventure I shall Prevail that we
[1:00:44] may Smite them that I may drive them out
[1:00:47] of the land for I want that he whom thou
[1:00:51] bless uh bless us is blessed and whom
[1:00:54] thou curs us is cursed
[1:00:56] and the Elders of Moab and the Elders of
[1:00:58] Midian departed from with the rewards of
[1:01:01] Divination in their hand and came unto
[1:01:03] balam and spake unto him the words of
[1:01:05] baac and he and he said unto them Lodge
[1:01:08] here this night I will bring you word
[1:01:10] again as the Lord shall speak unto me
[1:01:12] and the princes of the Moab Abode with
[1:01:15] balum and God came unto balum and said
[1:01:18] what men are these with thee balb sent
[1:01:21] unto God baac the son of zapor the king
[1:01:23] of Moab had sent unto me saying behold
[1:01:27] there is a people come out of Egypt
[1:01:29] which
[1:01:30] coverthe now and curse me then per
[1:01:32] Adventure I shall be able to overcome
[1:01:35] them and drive them out and God said
[1:01:37] unto balum Thou shalt not go with them
[1:01:42] Thou shalt not curse the people for they
[1:01:44] are blessed and balam Rose up in the
[1:01:48] morning and said unto the princes of BAC
[1:01:51] get you into your land for the Lord
[1:01:53] refuses to give me leave to go with you
[1:01:56] and the princes of Moab rose up and they
[1:01:59] went unto baac and balum refused to come
[1:02:02] with us and said baala refused to come
[1:02:05] with us and baac sent yet again princes
[1:02:09] more and more honorable than they and
[1:02:11] they came to balum and said to him thus
[1:02:15] saith baac the son of zapor let nothing
[1:02:18] I pray thee hinder thee from coming unto
[1:02:21] me for I will promote thee uh unto very
[1:02:25] great honor I will do whatsoever thou
[1:02:28] saith unto me come therefore I pray thee
[1:02:30] and curse me this people and balam
[1:02:33] answered and said unto the Servants of
[1:02:35] balac if baac would give me his house
[1:02:38] full of silver and gold I cannot go
[1:02:40] beyond the word of the Lord my God to do
[1:02:43] less or more now therefore I pray you
[1:02:46] Terry ye also here this night that I may
[1:02:50] know what the Lord will say unto me more
[1:02:53] and God said unto balb at night he said
[1:02:55] unto him
[1:02:56] if the men come to call thee rise up and
[1:03:00] go with them but yet the word which I
[1:03:03] shall say unto thee and thou shalt do
[1:03:05] now was was balam right was balum right
[1:03:09] to ask the Lord again if the Lord has
[1:03:12] already told him
[1:03:16] no you should
[1:03:18] always leave it alone but because of the
[1:03:22] prestige and the continual pushing did
[1:03:25] you know brother brandham they
[1:03:26] constantly was trying to push brother
[1:03:29] brandham and manipulate him one way or
[1:03:32] another to fit their circles but I'm
[1:03:35] sure glad he was a god-sent prophet he
[1:03:38] stood there with a backbone and said no
[1:03:40] I ain't going with you and I don't care
[1:03:41] about your honor I don't care about your
[1:03:44] right amen these guys wanted brother
[1:03:46] brandham now watch balam rose up in the
[1:03:49] morning and saddled his
[1:03:51] ass and went with the princes of Moab
[1:03:55] and the Lord Lord's anger was kindled
[1:03:58] because he went now you
[1:04:01] say why would the Lord be mad he told
[1:04:03] him to go because it was in his evil
[1:04:07] heart to go that's right and if our
[1:04:12] heart is resisting the word of the Lord
[1:04:14] in any area of our life we want to stop
[1:04:17] right then and say God please take this
[1:04:20] out of my soul I don't want anything
[1:04:24] that is not agreeable to your word amen
[1:04:27] don't want anything that's not agreeable
[1:04:29] to your word so so God's anger was
[1:04:32] kindled because he went amen now you
[1:04:36] kids listening and the angel of the Lord
[1:04:38] stood in the way for an adversary
[1:04:40] against him now he was riding upon his
[1:04:43] ass that's his donkey and his two
[1:04:45] servants were with him and the ass saw
[1:04:48] the angel of the Lord standing in the
[1:04:51] way now watch this the donkey sees the
[1:04:54] angel of the Lord
[1:04:56] and balam doesn't seem him at all now
[1:04:59] watch Saw the angel of the Lord standing
[1:05:01] in the way and his sword drawn in his
[1:05:04] hand and the ass turned aside out of the
[1:05:08] way and went into the field and balum
[1:05:11] smoked the ass to turn her into the way
[1:05:14] and the angel of the Lord stood in the
[1:05:15] path of The Vineyards a wall being on
[1:05:18] this side and a wall on that side and
[1:05:20] when the ass saw the angel of the Lord
[1:05:22] she thrust herself unto the wall and
[1:05:24] crushed alam's foot against the wall and
[1:05:28] he smote her again and the angel of the
[1:05:30] Lord went further and stood in a narrow
[1:05:33] place and there was no way to turn
[1:05:36] either to the right or to the left and
[1:05:38] when the ass saw the angel of the Lord
[1:05:40] she fell down under balum and balam's
[1:05:43] anger was kindled he smoked the ass with
[1:05:46] a staff and the Lord opened the mouth of
[1:05:49] the ass and she said unto Balon now
[1:05:52] here's the donkey talking to it what
[1:05:54] have I done done unto thee that thou H
[1:05:58] has smitten me these three times and
[1:06:02] balum started talking to the donkey and
[1:06:05] balum said unto the ass because thou has
[1:06:09] mocked me I would there was a sword in
[1:06:12] my hand for I would kill thee and the
[1:06:15] ass said unto balam am not I thine ass
[1:06:19] upon which thou Hast written ever since
[1:06:22] I was thine unto this day was I ever
[1:06:26] want to do so unto thee he said nay and
[1:06:30] then the Lord opened the eyes of balum
[1:06:33] and he saw the angel of the Lord
[1:06:35] standing in the way and his sword drawn
[1:06:38] in his hand and he bowed down his head
[1:06:41] and F fell flat on his face and the
[1:06:44] angel of the Lord said unto him
[1:06:45] wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass
[1:06:48] these three times behold I went out to
[1:06:51] withstand thee because thy way is
[1:06:54] perverse before me
[1:06:56] and the ass saw me and turned from me
[1:06:59] these three times unless she had turned
[1:07:02] from me surely now also I would have
[1:07:05] slain thee and saved her alive and balb
[1:07:09] said unto the angel of the Lord I have
[1:07:11] sinned for I knew not that thou stood Us
[1:07:14] in the way against me now therefore if
[1:07:16] it displease Thee I will get me back
[1:07:20] again and the angel of the Lord said
[1:07:23] unto bam go with the in but but only the
[1:07:26] word I shall speak unto thee that thou
[1:07:29] shalt speak so balum went with the
[1:07:33] princess of baac not that quite a story
[1:07:37] I now now now you say well the Lord is
[1:07:39] telling them to go
[1:07:42] because he should have stopped and said
[1:07:45] no you're you
[1:07:50] you I am not going one step further if
[1:07:53] you were fixing to split my hair with
[1:07:56] your sword I'm not going any further I'm
[1:07:59] going to get back in the will of the
[1:08:01] Lord but it's not in his heart to get
[1:08:06] back in the will of the Lord that's
[1:08:10] right you say well the Lord should have
[1:08:12] told him to go back no his he's going to
[1:08:15] do his heart's
[1:08:20] desire and I want to say this here today
[1:08:24] we don't want to have that kind of a
[1:08:27] heart that is constantly pushing against
[1:08:30] God that's right we don't want God
[1:08:33] giving us our heart's desire when it's
[1:08:36] not upon his word that's
[1:08:39] now if you were to read and you can do
[1:08:42] this in your devotional times but he
[1:08:44] gives the prophecy numbers 237
[1:08:49] to2 he is that's numbers 237 to12 he
[1:08:53] comes and prophesies a blessing on
[1:08:56] Israel so then the king says King BAC
[1:08:58] says hey okay I'll take you another
[1:09:00] place so so they kill the the the the
[1:09:04] they have the seven sacrifices and they
[1:09:06] offer them all up and they're doing
[1:09:07] everything amen numbers 2318 to 24 he
[1:09:12] gets up to prophesy and what does he say
[1:09:15] he says my eyes are my my eyes are open
[1:09:18] and a vision has come across and he
[1:09:20] starts telling what he sees and and he's
[1:09:23] and it's right there it's it's you you
[1:09:24] got to read it amen then he goes and
[1:09:26] takes him to another place numbers
[1:09:29] um let numbers uh
[1:09:32] 24 let's see uh yeah 24
[1:09:37] 4-9 and when he gets up there he he
[1:09:41] prophesies blessings again so then he
[1:09:44] goes amen uh there in the 245 to to 25
[1:09:50] and it's nothing but blessings and I
[1:09:52] want to tell you he prophesied of Jesus
[1:09:54] coming he prophesied I mean balam
[1:09:59] prophesied of things that were going to
[1:10:01] happen thousands of
[1:10:05] years and he was
[1:10:09] false praise the
[1:10:12] Lord when balum could not get God to
[1:10:16] curse and and again read the story
[1:10:19] finally the the the the Bible says that
[1:10:21] balum taught them the Israel to commit
[1:10:25] met
[1:10:26] fornication and taught him to
[1:10:28] intermingle amen their their seed was
[1:10:30] some you know the wind it just it it
[1:10:32] just brought it there amen and the
[1:10:35] scripture says there in in Deuteronomy
[1:10:38] uh uh thir not uh numbers 31 and6 if you
[1:10:42] wouldn't mind putting that up such Keys
[1:10:43] 31 and 16 of
[1:10:45] numbers that the council behold these
[1:10:49] caused the children of Israel through
[1:10:51] the Council of balum to commit trespass
[1:10:53] against the Lord uh in the matter of
[1:10:55] pure and there was a plague among the
[1:10:59] congregation of the Lord here this man
[1:11:03] was used to prophesy and his prophecies
[1:11:07] were
[1:11:10] genuine but his
[1:11:13] teaching did not teach the people to
[1:11:17] follow the
[1:11:19] Lord amen y'all understand that praise
[1:11:23] the Lord and then
[1:11:26] he's talked about there in Peter he's
[1:11:27] talked about in Jude I've wrote this I
[1:11:29] brought this one in Jude 1 And1 woe unto
[1:11:31] them for they have gone in the way of
[1:11:33] Cain and reain greedily uh ran greedily
[1:11:36] after the error of balum for reward and
[1:11:38] perished in the gang saying of cor amen
[1:11:42] all right let's look at let let's look
[1:11:45] at at at at another at another one that
[1:11:48] um how many's understanding so
[1:11:51] far amen so do we understand that that
[1:11:54] you can can you can prophesy but that
[1:11:58] does not mean you are you Holy Ghost
[1:12:03] filled amen we want to do things oh
[1:12:07] church it's so important that we follow
[1:12:11] after God with all of our heart follow
[1:12:14] after
[1:12:15] God I'm a singer and sometimes we can
[1:12:18] get anointed that we can get and you say
[1:12:20] well I'm a singer and God anoints me and
[1:12:22] God blesses me would would you would you
[1:12:25] base your your walk with God and your
[1:12:28] salvation upon you being able to move a
[1:12:31] crowd with your voice and still go out
[1:12:34] there and live contrary to the word what
[1:12:37] what what good would that be what good
[1:12:39] would that be to be a singer and then
[1:12:42] end up in hell that's right what good
[1:12:45] would it be to be a be a preacher or be
[1:12:48] a musician or to be a a deacon or or or
[1:12:52] or whatever and yet and yet
[1:12:56] and depend on your special
[1:13:01] gift and not really pay
[1:13:04] attention to your heart and the
[1:13:06] willingness to obey God go ahe that's
[1:13:10] now I'm going to fixing to give you
[1:13:11] another example here now I'm not going
[1:13:14] to give all the examples that brother
[1:13:15] brandham gave they in the anointed ones
[1:13:17] at the end time but he brother brandham
[1:13:20] I'm not even going to try toeach his
[1:13:21] sermon y'all y'all y'all go back and
[1:13:23] listen to him because it is is it's an
[1:13:25] incredible deal but I'm going to show
[1:13:26] you how that the anointing Came Upon
[1:13:29] King Saul and when the anointing when
[1:13:33] when Saul uh when he was anointed by
[1:13:36] Samuel to be king amen the scripture
[1:13:39] says that that he became a different man
[1:13:44] with that with that anointing to be king
[1:13:47] and the Bible says that he began to
[1:13:51] prophesy with the prophets
[1:13:55] amen there there in there in
[1:13:59] Samuel Samuel the 10th chapter praise
[1:14:03] the Lord then Samuel at the first verse
[1:14:06] then Samuel took a vial of oil and
[1:14:08] poured it upon his head and kissed him
[1:14:10] and said is it not because the Lord hath
[1:14:12] anointed thee to be Captain over his
[1:14:15] inheritance whence Thou Art departed
[1:14:18] from uh for me today then Thou shalt
[1:14:22] find two men by Rachel sepon now this is
[1:14:24] the prophet Samuel that is letting him
[1:14:26] know that God is with him and so he's
[1:14:29] going to he's going to tell him things
[1:14:30] is fixing to happen as he's on his way
[1:14:31] home he's just he's just told him that
[1:14:33] his that his donkeys have been found
[1:14:35] they are now safe they're they're
[1:14:37] they're back at h house and then he's
[1:14:39] telling him as you're going home you're
[1:14:40] going to run into this this this this
[1:14:42] this so now he's telling says when thou
[1:14:44] are departed from me today then Thou
[1:14:46] shalt find two men by Rachel seeper in
[1:14:48] the border of Benjamin and and zelza and
[1:14:51] they will say unto thee the asses which
[1:14:54] thou Wiest to to seek are found and lo
[1:14:56] thy father hath left the care uh of the
[1:15:00] asses and and sorth for you saying what
[1:15:03] shall I do for my son then shalt thou go
[1:15:06] on forward from then and thou shalt come
[1:15:09] to the plain of Tabor and and there
[1:15:12] shall meet thee three men going up to to
[1:15:16] God to bethl one carrying three kids
[1:15:20] another carrying three loaves another
[1:15:22] carrying a bottle of wine I want to tell
[1:15:25] you doesn't that doesn't that just sort
[1:15:26] of make you think of our Prophet how how
[1:15:30] how right precise that was now watch he
[1:15:34] says uh it says and they will salute
[1:15:37] thee and give thee two loaves of bread
[1:15:40] Thou shalt receive of their hands and
[1:15:42] after that thou shalt come to the hill
[1:15:44] of God and there is a Garrison of the
[1:15:46] Philistines and um and and it shall come
[1:15:49] to pass when thou art come to this C th
[1:15:52] to the city Thou shalt meet a company of
[1:15:54] prophets and coming down from the high
[1:15:56] place with a sultry and a Tabet and a
[1:15:58] pipe and a heart before them and they
[1:16:01] shall prophesy and the spirit of the
[1:16:03] Lord will come upon thee and thou shalt
[1:16:05] prophesy with them and shalt be turned
[1:16:07] into another man and and let it be when
[1:16:09] these signs are come to unto thee that
[1:16:12] thou do as occasion serve thee for the
[1:16:15] Lord is with thee and thou shalt go down
[1:16:17] before me to gilgal behold I will I I I
[1:16:20] will come down unto thee to to offer
[1:16:22] burnt offerings and to sacrifice
[1:16:24] sacrifice of people peace offerings
[1:16:25] seven days Thou shalt T till I come to
[1:16:28] thee and and show thee what Thou shalt
[1:16:30] do and it was so that when he had turned
[1:16:33] his way back from to go from Samuel that
[1:16:35] God gave him another heart and all those
[1:16:36] signs come to pass that day and when
[1:16:38] they had came thither to the hill Behold
[1:16:41] a company of prophets met him and the
[1:16:43] spirit of God come upon him and he
[1:16:44] prophesied among him and it come to pass
[1:16:47] when all knew him beforehand Before Time
[1:16:49] saw that behold he prophesied among the
[1:16:52] prophets then the people said one to
[1:16:54] another
[1:16:55] what is this that is that has come unto
[1:16:57] the son of
[1:16:58] Kish is Saul also among the prophets one
[1:17:02] of the same place answered and said uh
[1:17:04] but who is their father and therefore it
[1:17:07] become a proverb is is Saul also among
[1:17:10] the prophets and when he had made an end
[1:17:12] to prophesying he came to the high place
[1:17:15] amen so so God's anointing is on him
[1:17:17] right now how many how many can say that
[1:17:20] I mean if you if you had a prophet to
[1:17:22] tell you that you're going to meet this
[1:17:23] and this and this and this and this and
[1:17:24] this and it all happens you say oh my
[1:17:27] goodness okay all right I'm God's man
[1:17:30] God's anointing me
[1:17:32] right
[1:17:35] anointed but Saul's heart was not
[1:17:39] perfect before God that's right right
[1:17:43] now I'm giving you the illustr I'm I'm
[1:17:45] I'm I'm I'm I'm not going to hold you
[1:17:47] too much longer but I'm giving you the
[1:17:48] reason why one man could prophesy and he
[1:17:51] was a genuine Christian and this other
[1:17:53] man can prophesy and things happen
[1:17:55] genuinely by the Holy Ghost and that man
[1:17:59] was living with another woman that was
[1:18:01] not his wife and was fathering another
[1:18:04] child is
[1:18:07] because it was an anointing but they
[1:18:10] were depending upon an anointing instead
[1:18:12] of their hearts being right with
[1:18:16] God I would rather I would rather this
[1:18:20] congregation never have another gift
[1:18:23] never have a gift of the spirit never
[1:18:25] have anything and be right with God and
[1:18:28] walk with God than to have a church full
[1:18:31] of gifts with no one's desire to serve
[1:18:34] God that's right
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:38] amen now so now we we're going to fast
[1:18:42] forward here to Psalms 19 and and we're
[1:18:45] going to read at the 20th verse now
[1:18:47] we're finding that David Saul has been
[1:18:51] rejected Saul is is now jealous of David
[1:18:55] he's chasing and he's trying to kill
[1:18:57] David he's trying to kill David and and
[1:19:00] so we sending Messengers out and they're
[1:19:02] amen and so we're just breaking in here
[1:19:05] now uh the 19th Chapter 1st Samuel 19
[1:19:07] and 20 and Saul sent Messengers to David
[1:19:11] and when they saw the company of the
[1:19:12] prophets prophesying Samuel standing as
[1:19:15] appointed over them now here's again
[1:19:17] here's some people prophesying but D
[1:19:21] Samuel over them the spirit of God was
[1:19:23] upon the Messengers of Saul and they
[1:19:26] also prophesied and it was cold to Saul
[1:19:28] and he sent another he sent other
[1:19:29] Messengers and they prophesied likewise
[1:19:32] and Saul sent Messengers again the third
[1:19:34] time and they prophesied also then went
[1:19:37] he Saul also to Rama and came to a great
[1:19:40] well that is SEC
[1:19:43] seu however you pronounce it he and he
[1:19:45] asked and said where are Samuel and
[1:19:47] David one said behold they be at at nth
[1:19:50] at Rama and and they went thither to
[1:19:53] Nath to in Rama and the spirit of God
[1:19:57] was upon Him Saul also and he went on
[1:20:01] and prophesied until he come to Nao in
[1:20:05] ra Rama and he stripped off his clothes
[1:20:07] also and prophesied before Samuel in
[1:20:11] like Manner and laid down naked all day
[1:20:14] and all that night wherefore they say is
[1:20:18] Saul also
[1:20:21] among the prophets
[1:20:30] see genuine gifts prophesying with the
[1:20:37] prophets but a heart that was not
[1:20:40] perfect before
[1:20:41] God so what we
[1:20:44] want does that do away with the good
[1:20:46] prophets does that do away with the pro
[1:20:48] the gift of Prophecy no but we want
[1:20:51] those gifts in operation the way God
[1:20:55] wants him in operation we want the Holy
[1:20:58] Spirit to be satisfied with us so so now
[1:21:01] I'm just I I think I'm just going to I'm
[1:21:03] I'm going to uh end right there
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:09] and now
[1:21:12] again while I'm here um and and while
[1:21:17] it's been said and you
[1:21:20] know uh the prophecy that Kenneth Hagen
[1:21:23] and it's all over the Internet and
[1:21:24] things you know but it it that he gave
[1:21:27] Kenneth Hagen toward brother brandham it
[1:21:28] says now at the end of
[1:21:30] 65 he who now stands in the Forefront of
[1:21:33] The Healing Ministry as a prophet will
[1:21:35] be taken out of the way he will make a
[1:21:38] false step Satan shall destroy his life
[1:21:41] and but his spirit will be saved and his
[1:21:43] Works will follow him air 66 shall come
[1:21:46] and he shall be gone
[1:21:50] now they're they're CLA now first of all
[1:21:53] I want to say this did not come out in
[1:21:55] the open until after brother Brandon was
[1:21:57] gone so we can question that right we
[1:22:00] can question that anyone can make things
[1:22:02] up but they now this was Kenneth Hagen
[1:22:05] the founder of the the the faith the
[1:22:07] word of faith you know there in they're
[1:22:09] in Broken Arrow okay all right so you're
[1:22:14] looking and you're thinking
[1:22:18] hm
[1:22:20] now good man wonderful man wonderful
[1:22:23] Prophet but now now now he is but God's
[1:22:26] going to take him
[1:22:27] away and um and and
[1:22:32] um he he would he would go on and add
[1:22:38] that
[1:22:40] um uh he he would
[1:22:43] add he said the Lord the Lord explained
[1:22:46] to me I had to permit him to be removed
[1:22:49] because of the damage he was causing in
[1:22:52] the body of Christ
[1:22:54] hm
[1:22:56] okay
[1:22:58] so what are we going to do we've got
[1:23:00] we've got a prophet versus a
[1:23:04] prophet right now we accept him as a
[1:23:07] word Prophet they don't so now we've got
[1:23:10] a prophet versus a prophet what are we
[1:23:12] going to
[1:23:14] do take it back to
[1:23:18] scripture okay all right I will let's
[1:23:22] let's just okay
[1:23:26] yes God's going to take him off the scam
[1:23:28] because he's doing great
[1:23:31] [Music]
[1:23:34] damage show it by scripture that's
[1:23:40] right are you saying brother Wendell
[1:23:42] that he didn't see that Vision no he saw
[1:23:45] that
[1:23:46] Vision I believe the Lord allowed him to
[1:23:49] see brother brandham passing
[1:23:52] on brother brandham knew he was going to
[1:23:54] pass on I believe brother Brandon was
[1:23:57] was even knowing at at at that
[1:24:01] point but but his
[1:24:04] interpretation is not scriptural that's
[1:24:07] right so he's adding to and putting
[1:24:10] things in and it and you you miss it in
[1:24:13] one way you miss the whole
[1:24:15] thing so you can't L are you
[1:24:19] understanding so they so they base this
[1:24:21] whole
[1:24:22] thing that God showed him that that
[1:24:25] great prophet was going to what okay
[1:24:29] wonderful but did God tell you all of
[1:24:31] that God will never go against his
[1:24:36] word that's right now let's talk about
[1:24:39] Kenneth
[1:24:40] Hagen shall we amen the angel of the
[1:24:45] Lord come and S at his bed now when when
[1:24:48] he would come and appeared to brother
[1:24:49] Branham brother brandham would he would
[1:24:51] fall as a dead man did is that not is
[1:24:53] that not the way scripture reads in when
[1:24:56] when the angel of the Lord would appear
[1:24:58] to to one of those Old Testament
[1:24:59] prophets it was like but this one that
[1:25:02] would appear to brother Kenneth Hagen
[1:25:08] amen I'm not going to be too mean I was
[1:25:10] going to extract the word
[1:25:12] brother he would come and sit on the bed
[1:25:14] beside him and they'd talk about things
[1:25:16] and they would just talk back and forth
[1:25:19] that's when the angel of the lord gave
[1:25:21] brother brother Kenneth Hagen the
[1:25:23] revelation of the hair for the woman
[1:25:26] that it was a cap well I don't know why
[1:25:29] his wife and children don't wear caps
[1:25:32] and uh where where you know something
[1:25:34] over their head but the a but it's it's
[1:25:36] all it's all there go look it up for
[1:25:39] Kenneth Hagen amen and the woman
[1:25:41] question he'll tell you how the Lord
[1:25:42] just gave just settled that whole thing
[1:25:45] okay okay okay is it
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:53] scripture he a false prophet
[1:25:57] amen yet some of his prophecies have
[1:26:01] come to pass but it's
[1:26:03] false he's leading people contrary to
[1:26:08] the word
[1:26:11] amen god-given
[1:26:13] gift in a reprobate heart that has led
[1:26:17] thousands and thousands away from the
[1:26:20] scripture
[1:26:24] see what I'm saying so you hit it so you
[1:26:28] was able to hit it the brother random
[1:26:29] was going to pass away good for
[1:26:35] you do I make
[1:26:39] sense you try you go back and look there
[1:26:42] at the genuine prophet of
[1:26:44] God Amen now then of course Gordon
[1:26:48] Lindsay you know Gordon Lindsay jumps in
[1:26:52] yeah how many knows who Gordon Lindsay
[1:26:53] is you know amen Gordon Lindsay um just
[1:26:58] just jumps in and it's two days later
[1:27:00] after after brother brand pway brother
[1:27:02] Lindsay called me up and said brother
[1:27:04] Hagen the the brother you referred to
[1:27:06] just died I got I I I I got all out that
[1:27:09] prophecy the lord gave us 18 months ago
[1:27:12] and read it and it's right on brother
[1:27:14] Lindsay related an experience he had had
[1:27:17] with that prophet and brother Lindsay
[1:27:19] said I told him you're not a teacher so
[1:27:21] don't try to teach this is brother
[1:27:24] Hagen's words he says he was he he he
[1:27:27] was a preacher and a good one at that
[1:27:29] and he had marvelous manifestations of
[1:27:31] the holy spirit in his ministry brother
[1:27:33] Lindsay said I begged him not to teach I
[1:27:36] said you don't know the Bible you're
[1:27:39] confusing folks leave the Bible teaching
[1:27:41] to the teachers and just go ahead and
[1:27:44] preach and exercise the word of
[1:27:45] knowledge and Gifts of healing as the
[1:27:47] spirit wills and and be a blessing to
[1:27:49] the body of Christ this Prophet said to
[1:27:52] brother Lindsay I know I'm not a teacher
[1:27:53] but I want to teach and I'm going to
[1:27:59] teach
[1:28:02] see not even not even you you even these
[1:28:05] kids know better than that but brother
[1:28:07] Brenham did say many of times in front
[1:28:09] of all the theologians now I know I'm
[1:28:10] not a teacher you guys are the
[1:28:13] theologians but uh uh but I've got
[1:28:15] something on my heart I and I want to
[1:28:17] tell you what he said there in just a
[1:28:19] few moments would just blow those guys
[1:28:21] away yes sir he he had a
[1:28:25] gift the angel of the lord gave him
[1:28:28] direct knowledge he didn't get it from a
[1:28:30] seminary he got it from the he was a
[1:28:34] prophet to restore us back to the
[1:28:39] word those
[1:28:41] rebellious leoan Preachers did not want
[1:28:45] to go back to the word that's right
[1:28:48] that's
[1:28:50] right Kenneth Hagen you should have came
[1:28:53] in life
[1:28:58] Gordon Lindsay you should have brought
[1:29:00] your gift in
[1:29:02] line TL osbor you should have brought
[1:29:06] your gift in line with the voice of the
[1:29:09] day
[1:29:11] amen and you would have had your
[1:29:13] reward but you
[1:29:16] didn't you brought your own following
[1:29:19] instead of pointing them are you
[1:29:21] understanding now the 70 were given the
[1:29:26] gifts but it was the gift that was upon
[1:29:29] the prophet
[1:29:31] Moses and be and that was distributed
[1:29:33] out and they were not stewards of that
[1:29:38] gift bottom line is if
[1:29:43] you're a sticker If you're a thorn bush
[1:29:46] you'll never give wheat right and if
[1:29:50] you're a
[1:29:51] wheat you ain't going to Bear Thorns

[1:30:15] backslide you can get your heart so
[1:30:18] muddled up and so hardened by this lay
[1:30:20] osia that you allow things in your lives
