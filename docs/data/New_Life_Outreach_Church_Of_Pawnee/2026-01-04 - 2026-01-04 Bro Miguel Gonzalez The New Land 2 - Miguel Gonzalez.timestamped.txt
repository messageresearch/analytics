[25:04] Oh, Christ walks [music] beside me.
[25:08] angels [singing] to guide me. Oh,
[25:11] walking up the king's highway. It's a
[25:15] highway. Oh, it's a highway
[25:19] to heaven.
[25:22] Oh, none can walk [music] up there.
[25:26] But the pure in heart, it's a highway
[25:29] [singing and music]
[25:31] to heaven.
[25:34] I'm walking up. Do we have one more
[25:37] verse? my way tonight. Oh, if you're not
[25:42] walking, star while I'm talking,
[25:45] [music and singing]
[25:46] walking up the king's highway.
[25:52] Oh, there [singing] will be [music] a

[25:55] You'll be possessing
[25:58] walking [music and singing] up the
[26:00] king's high way. Oh, it's our
[26:05] way to heaven.
[26:10] Oh, none shall walk [music] up there
[26:13] by the pure in heart. It's a highway
[26:18] to heaven. [music and singing]
[26:21] I'm walking up the king once again now.
[26:25] Oh, it's a [music] highway
[26:30] to heaven.
[26:33] Oh, none shall go up there. Oh, but the
[26:37] pure in heart. It's a highway
[26:42] to heaven.
[26:44] I'm walking up the king's highway.
[26:50] [music and singing]
[26:50] In pains of death seized on my soul unto
[26:57] [singing] the Lord I cried [music]
[27:02] till Jesus [singing] came and he made me
[27:07] whole. I would not [music] be denied.
[27:12] Oh no I would [music] not be denied.
[27:19] No, I would [music] not be denied
[27:24] until [music and singing] my Jesus came
[27:28] and he made me whole. I would not be
[27:33] [music and singing]
[27:34] denied.
[27:36] As Jacob in the days of old, I wrestled
[27:43] [music and singing]
[27:44] with the Lord
[27:48] in inant [music] with a courage bold. I
[27:54] stood upon his [music] word.
[27:59] Oh, I would not be.
[28:04] No,
[28:05] I would [music and singing]
[28:06] not be denied
[28:10] until my [music] Jesus [singing]
[28:12] came and made me whole. I would help we
[28:18] do that last verse now.
[28:21] Oh, Satan said my Lord was gone and
[28:28] would not hear my prayer. Well, praise
[28:32] the [music] Lord. But praise the Lord.
[28:36] The [singing] work's already done and
[28:39] Christ the Lord he is here.
[28:44] Oh, [music]
[28:45] I would sing it now with Sister Tracy
[28:48] comes. No,
[28:51] I would not be denied [music]
[28:54] [singing]
[28:56] until my Jesus came and he made me
[29:01] [music] whole. I would once again now.
[29:05] Oh no, I would.
[29:10] Thank you, Lord.
[29:12] No, I won't [music]
[29:16] deny
[29:18] until [music] my Jesus came and he made
[29:23] me whole. [singing]
[29:24] I would not be
[29:28] denied.
[29:31] Hallelujah. That that should be our
[29:33] attitude tonight.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Every promise in the
[29:37] book is ours. Amen. God bless you now.
[29:40] Bless the Lord.
[29:54] You
[29:56] may be rich
[29:59] with the wealth of
[30:01] a king.
[30:04] Have servants
[30:06] to bow at your feet.
[30:12] or a rusty
[30:15] tin cup.
[30:17] You're [screaming]
[30:19] everything.
[30:22] You're a beggar [screaming]
[30:25] out on the street.
[30:31] But it really
[30:33] doesn't matter
[30:36] how rich or
[30:39] how poor.
[30:41] See, God has provided [screaming]
[30:46] that we
[30:52] can have what the whole world's
[30:57] been searching [screaming]
[31:00] for.
[31:02] See the answer
[31:05] is calary. [screaming]
[31:12] Now, who
[31:14] who would go
[31:17] to the market
[31:20] place
[31:22] to buy
[31:25] a brand
[31:27] new car?
[31:32] or dig [singing]
[31:35] a hole
[31:37] way down in the ground
[31:42] in search of
[31:45] a shining
[31:48] star. [screaming]
[31:52] or choose
[31:54] choose to stand
[31:57] in the busy
[32:00] part of town
[32:02] to hear
[32:05] the waves of [screaming] the sea.
[32:12] It's the same if you're lost
[32:17] and you want to be found.
[32:22] See the answer
[32:24] is calary [screaming]
[32:30] mount of redemption.
[32:37] [music]
[32:38] Oh [screaming]
[32:39] mountain
[32:41] of hope,
[32:46] [music] my feet have not walked
[32:49] [screaming]
[32:53] up your rocky [singing]
[32:56] slope. [screaming]
[33:00] My eyes have seen
[33:07] that old merciless
[33:11] dream.
[33:15] But my heart took a trip
[33:20] I will never [screaming]
[33:22] forget

[33:32] Mount of redemption.
[33:41] Oh mountain
[33:44] of hope,
[33:48] my feet have not walked [screaming]

[35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[35:18] [music] As we invite the men of God, can
[35:20] we sing this? Amazing
[35:23] grace
[35:26] shall always
[35:29] [music and singing] be
[35:31] my song of praise.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; For it [singing] was [music] grace
[35:42] that bought
[35:44] my [singing] liberty.
[35:51] I do
[35:53] not know [singing]
[35:57] just why he [singing] came [music]
[36:01] to love
[36:04] &gt;&gt; to love me so. Oh my. But he looked
[36:08] [singing]
[36:08] beyond
[36:10] &gt;&gt; all my faults tonight
[36:14] and so my need.
[36:20] I shall I shall forever
[36:27] live [music]
[36:29] my [singing] eyes
[36:31] to Calary
[36:36] to [singing] view [music] the cross
[36:42] where Jesus
[36:44] died for me. [music and singing]
[36:50] How marvelous [music and singing]
[36:56] the grace [music] that caught our
[37:00] falling [singing]
[37:02] soul. Hallelujah.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; So so glad he [music]
[37:05] [singing] looked beyond
[37:09] all my thoughts and saw. Is there
[37:13] another verse? my knee.
[37:17] I love this amazing [singing]
[37:21] grace.
[37:23] Don't mind that [music] save [singing]
[37:26] me from
[37:28] my sin and shame
[37:33] to draw me close [singing]
[37:38] [music]
[37:39] and keep
[37:41] me by his [music] side.
[37:48] Forever
[37:50] [singing]
[37:51] rise.
[37:54] All praise,
[37:56] all [singing] glory
[37:58] to his name. Oh my.
[38:03] If not
[38:05] for him,
[38:08] [music] I surely
[38:11] would have died.
[38:15] Can we just lift a hand and sing it now?
[38:17] I shall
[38:19] forever
[38:23] [music and singing]
[38:46] and marvelous. [singing]
[38:52] The grace that call my boy
[38:57] [music]
[39:01] he ly on
[39:06] [singing and music] my fault and soul
[39:10] [music]
[39:11] &gt;&gt; my
[39:15] Amen. And [applause and music]
[39:22] that's definitely one of my [music]
[39:24] favorite songs.
[39:27] That God was so big that he could
[39:29] [music] look beyond my faults and he
[39:31] could see my need.
[39:33] that God could look down past my
[39:36] humanity,
[39:37] past my flesh,
[39:40] past everything contrary [music] that
[39:42] his scripture is, and he could look down
[39:44] and say,
[39:47] &gt;&gt; "They need redemption.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, God,
[39:49] &gt;&gt; they need my word. They need my love.
[39:53] God,
[39:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to look past their faults and
[39:55] I'm going to see their need." How many
[39:57] are thankful for that here this evening?
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And did you enjoy the word of the
[40:01] Lord here this morning? [applause] Amen.
[40:09] Definitely
[40:11] uh just good stuff to write down and
[40:13] keep in your memory bank. A lot of just
[40:16] nutrition for the journey there and just
[40:19] just a lot of good word scriptures and
[40:22] quotes and
[40:22] &gt;&gt; [music]
[40:22] &gt;&gt; uh just thankful for the Lord here for
[40:25] that and to attend a church that has
[40:27] that. And uh if we could, I won't keep
[40:30] you very very long here this evening. I
[40:32] got a a few scriptures
[40:35] uh that we've put down here. And if we
[40:38] could, I'd like to go ahead and start in
[40:41] the book of Number or uh yeah, Numbers
[40:44] 13th chapter, the 26th verse. And I
[40:48] believe the last time that uh we spoke
[40:51] uh we were talking about the new land.
[40:54] And it's kind of a subject that uh
[40:59] I just don't feel justice, you know, um
[41:03] by only going kind of halfway with it in
[41:05] order to get a point across because,
[41:08] you know, as I was telling brother Wind,
[41:11] you know, mama didn't really raise no
[41:13] quitter. Um you know, I might butcher it
[41:17] all the way.
[41:20] I might butcher it all the way. I might
[41:22] not be the the the best person for the
[41:24] subject, but at least I know something
[41:26] about the subject.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; All right.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; So, but if we could, we'd like to go
[41:31] ahead and go into the scripture here,
[41:33] Numbers 13 and 26
[41:35] through through the um 33rd verse. But
[41:40] if you're there, just say amen. And um
[41:43] and they went and came to Moses and to
[41:45] Aaron and to all the congregation of the
[41:48] children of Israel unto the wilderness
[41:50] of Pyan to Kadesh and brought back word
[41:54] unto them and unto all the congregation
[41:56] and showed them the fruit of the land.
[41:59] And they told him and said, "We came
[42:01] unto the land whether thou sent us, and
[42:03] surely it flowth with milk and honey,
[42:06] and this is the fruit of it.
[42:08] Nevertheless, the people be strong in
[42:10] the land or strong that dwell in the
[42:13] land, and cities are walled and very
[42:15] great. And moreover, we saw the children
[42:18] of Anoch there, and the Amalachites
[42:20] dwell in the land of the south, and the
[42:22] Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the
[42:24] Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the
[42:25] Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the
[42:28] coast of Jordan. And Caleb stealed the
[42:31] people before Moses and said, "Let us go
[42:34] up at once and possess it, for we are
[42:37] able to overcome it." But the man that
[42:40] went But the men that went up with him
[42:42] said, "We are not able to go up against
[42:45] the people, for they are stronger than
[42:47] we." And they brought up an evil report
[42:50] of the land which they had searched unto
[42:52] the children of Israel, saying, The land
[42:56] the uh the land through which we have
[42:59] gone to search it is a land that eateth
[43:01] up the inhabitants thereof, and all the
[43:03] people that we saw in it are men of
[43:05] great stature. And they we saw the
[43:08] giants, and the sons of Anoch, which
[43:10] come of the giants, and we were in our
[43:13] own sight as grasshoppers.
[43:15] And so we were in their sight. And as
[43:19] the Lord adds the blessing to the
[43:22] reading of his word, you could be seated
[43:24] here this evening or this this evening.
[43:27] And [snorts]
[43:29] and as as I said before, just to kind of
[43:31] maybe just give a quick recap of what we
[43:33] had talked about uh the last sermon
[43:36] dealing with this subject and we were
[43:38] dealing with Israel and their journey to
[43:40] the promised land. And at the beginning
[43:42] of our last service, we had talked about
[43:44] how that Israel was in Egypt and how
[43:46] that God had brought them out of Egypt
[43:48] and they had brought them up to the Red
[43:50] Sea and God again delivered them at the
[43:52] Red Sea and then from out of the Red Sea
[43:54] they were going to the promised land and
[43:57] God had done many of miracles for the
[43:59] children of Israel. He had brought them
[44:00] water. He had given them mana. He had
[44:03] given them he had given them flesh to
[44:05] eat that he had provided just different
[44:07] uh just different things he had provided
[44:09] for them along the journey. And now
[44:12] coming coming up to this Israel had had
[44:15] been provided for by the Lord for all of
[44:17] the different things. And they had
[44:18] murmured against Moses and the way that
[44:20] he had done things. And then where we
[44:23] had left off is where we had come up to
[44:25] the point that throughout that period of
[44:27] time in the wilderness that they had
[44:29] come to the point where God was leading
[44:31] them to the promised land there at
[44:33] Kadesh Barnea. And there at Kadesh he
[44:36] had brought the children of Israel there
[44:38] and they had come and they had of course
[44:41] where we had read where we had left off
[44:43] that there were spies that had went out
[44:44] into the land and they had come back and
[44:46] they'd come back with this report that
[44:48] we read here and the but out of the 10
[44:51] spies there was two of them. Now notice
[44:52] that we had read there that it was
[44:54] Caleb. It was one there was Joshua and
[44:56] Caleb one of the two or two of the 10
[44:59] spies that had went over there and they
[45:01] had come back and they had brought the
[45:02] evidence of it. Now something that I
[45:04] would like to kind of pin note there
[45:06] would be the evidence that they had
[45:08] brought from the new land. Now it now
[45:10] they said from their own mouth that yes
[45:12] it flows. Yes it's a land that flows
[45:15] with milk and honey. Yes it's a land. So
[45:17] everything that God had said was true.
[45:19] But yet they had come to the point where
[45:21] they in their disbelief is where they
[45:24] angered God. And now we can go there in
[45:27] numbers 14 and 21 through the 25th
[45:29] verse. It says, "But truly as I live,
[45:31] and all the earth shall be filled with
[45:33] the glory of the Lord, because all those
[45:36] men which have said seen," now think
[45:38] about this. This isn't just something
[45:39] that they heard of. This isn't just
[45:41] something that was written in stone
[45:42] somewhere, but these people seen this
[45:44] thing, seen these things with their own
[45:46] eyes. They said, "Because they all those
[45:48] men which have seen my glory and my
[45:51] miracles which I did in Egypt and in the
[45:53] wilderness and have tempted me now or
[45:56] tempted me now these 10 times, and I
[45:59] have not and have not hearkened to my
[46:01] voice. Surely they shall not see the
[46:04] land which I swear unto the fathers,
[46:06] neither shall any of them that provoke
[46:08] me see it. But my servant Caleb," now
[46:11] there's Caleb again being brought there
[46:13] into the mix. And he says, "But my
[46:14] servant Caleb, because he has another
[46:17] spirit within him." Now God God
[46:20] specifically begins to pinpoint Caleb
[46:22] out. And he's beginning to pin he says
[46:24] that because he's of another spirit now.
[46:26] Now now and also Caleb was one of the
[46:28] ones that came from the other from the
[46:31] other spies to give a good report a
[46:33] report of faith. But yet we know where
[46:35] the children of Israel were their report
[46:38] which report that they believe. But he
[46:40] says here surely they shall not see the
[46:42] land. which I swear unto the fathers,
[46:43] neither shall any of them that have
[46:45] promote provoked me see him, but my
[46:47] servant Caleb, because he has another or
[46:50] he had another spirit with him, and hath
[46:53] followed me fully. Uh, him will I bring
[46:56] unto the land wherewith he went, and his
[46:59] seed shall possess it. Now the 25th
[47:02] verse, now the Amalachites and the
[47:03] Canaanites dwell into the valley.
[47:06] tomorrow turn you and get you into the
[47:09] wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.
[47:12] Now we see that at this point that that
[47:14] that it that the whole entire journey
[47:16] and everything up to this point that
[47:18] everything was in vain at this point
[47:21] because they had come up to the border
[47:22] there and they rejected they rejected
[47:25] they didn't believe that God was able to
[47:28] provide uh a way of safe passage that
[47:30] they didn't believe that God was able to
[47:33] keep his word and what he had done in
[47:36] the things in the past he was they were
[47:38] they they they they counted God as a God
[47:40] of yesterday. They counted God maybe as
[47:42] a god of the past. They counted God as
[47:45] as something well he did it back then.
[47:47] Now I'm facing this new situation. No
[47:49] doubt at that period of time they never
[47:51] fought giants or they never they never
[47:53] fought uh of these strong these walled
[47:56] cities. But yet nevertheless no matter
[47:58] the circumstance God was expecting them
[48:01] to count him faithful. And it was
[48:04] because of their unbelief after the
[48:06] miracles that God had shown them. Now
[48:08] the miracles that they physically seen
[48:10] with their eyes that they physically
[48:12] experienced that they physically uh and
[48:15] nobody nobody up to that time had ever
[48:17] had ever smoke a rock and water had
[48:20] come. Nobody at that period of time had
[48:22] ever woke up in the morning and seen
[48:24] mana there on the on the on the ground.
[48:27] Nobody had seen flesh uh that was cooked
[48:29] come down from heaven. Nobody had seen
[48:31] these things. So surely you would have
[48:33] thought Israel would have been fully
[48:35] persuaded that God would been able to do
[48:37] anything. But yet all of the things that
[48:40] GOD HAD DONE, ALL of the miracles that
[48:42] he performed, Israel was still dwelling
[48:45] in unbelief. And we know that you can't
[48:48] have unbelief in mixed with faith with
[48:52] in your walk with God or you'll crumble.
[48:54] So So God begins to come down and and he
[48:57] sees the unbelief here and he's like, I
[49:00] can't do nothing with these people.
[49:01] they're just going TO HAVE TO GO UP into
[49:03] the wilderness. And he give them a
[49:05] mountain to go up on. And and he he told
[49:07] them to terried there in the wilderness.
[49:10] And it was like 30 to or it's like 38 to
[49:12] 40 years. It was 40 years that they
[49:14] begin to go around in this wilderness.
[49:16] And in this time, I mean, these people,
[49:19] these people again, they weren't in the
[49:21] promised land that God had problem or
[49:23] that God had promised them, but yet they
[49:25] were in the wilderness on the outside of
[49:28] the land that God had promised them. So
[49:31] there was no place that they could call
[49:32] home. There was no place that they could
[49:34] call theirs. There was no place that
[49:36] that that that they could go freely,
[49:38] that they could water their cattle, that
[49:40] their children could be raised, that
[49:42] they could that they could plant
[49:43] vineyards, that they could build homes.
[49:45] They couldn't do none of this cuz this
[49:46] land was inhabited by another. Now along
[49:50] this along this uh along the journey
[49:54] there the reason they couldn't the
[49:56] reason that they couldn't possess the
[49:58] land was because there in Deuteronomy 2
[50:00] 2 and9 the Lord had spoke to Moses and
[50:03] he says and ye have come past this
[50:05] mountain long enough.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Now we're jumping a little bit ahead
[50:08] here. You know this is the reason
[50:10] because we if we theoretically we could
[50:12] sit back and say well why didn't if
[50:14] Israel was without number when they was
[50:16] and they didn't have they had armies
[50:18] they had this and they had that and and
[50:20] there was fighting that why didn't they
[50:21] possess any of the land that was there
[50:23] why didn't they just stay on this side
[50:25] of the promised land just outnumber
[50:27] everybody and just take over everything
[50:29] that was there but but God spoke Moses
[50:32] to said and said this he says ye have
[50:35] come past this mountain long enough turn
[50:37] you northward and command thou thy
[50:40] people, saying, Ye are to pass through
[50:42] the coast of your brethren of the
[50:44] children of Esau, which dwell in Sire,
[50:47] and they shall be afraid of you, and
[50:48] take ye of heed unto yourselves. Meddal
[50:51] not with them, for I will not give you
[50:54] of their land, no, not such as a foot
[50:57] breath, because I have given mount sir
[51:00] unto Esau for a possession. Ye shall buy
[51:03] of them uh uh for money or ye shall you
[51:06] shall buy meat of them for money that
[51:08] you may eat and you shall also buy water
[51:11] of them that you may drink. For the Lord
[51:13] hath blessed him in all the works of thy
[51:16] hand. He knoweth thy walking through the
[51:19] this great wilderness. These 40 years
[51:22] the the Lord thy God hath been with
[51:24] thee. Thou hast lacked nothing. And when
[51:27] we passed uh by from the brethren of the
[51:30] children of Esau, which dwelt in Sire
[51:33] through the way of the plain of Edom,
[51:35] from we turned and passed by the way of
[51:37] the wilderness. And the Lord said,
[51:38] "Distress not the Moabites, neither
[51:41] contend with them in the battle. For I
[51:43] have not given thee of the land of uh gi
[51:47] for a possession, because I have given
[51:50] uh unto the children of the lot for a
[51:53] possession." So there was nothing for
[51:55] the children of Israel for them to
[51:58] possess outside of the land of promise.
[52:01] There was nothing for them that God
[52:03] didn't give them the land in the
[52:05] wilderness. Therefore therefore they had
[52:07] problems in the wilderness. God could
[52:09] not bless them in the wilderness. God
[52:11] couldn't God couldn't come down and yes
[52:14] he if you want to say that he they laid
[52:16] in his permissive will. Yes, he would
[52:18] bless them because they were the
[52:19] children, but yet they weren't in the
[52:21] pro promised land, but yet God was
[52:24] teaching him through the struggles and
[52:26] through the trials and through the
[52:27] situations. We can go we can go uh we
[52:30] can go and look and we can see in the in
[52:33] in in the scripture where here that
[52:35] nevertheless that Israel was in the
[52:37] wilderness and they were in the
[52:38] confusion and they and they were they
[52:40] were going through battles for 40 years
[52:42] and and now looking at this you can see
[52:44] that they they they had they had
[52:46] brothers that was with them there in
[52:48] Numbers 14 or 20 and 14 through 18.
[52:52] Y'all just y'all just let me just kind
[52:53] of lay this out here so we can try to
[52:55] see the whole entire thing as a whole.
[52:57] But it says here in Numbers 20 and
[52:59] 14-18, and Moses sent messengers. Now,
[53:02] this is the children of Israel in the
[53:04] wilderness. Okay? Now, in the
[53:06] wilderness, they're trying to navigate
[53:08] their way through. They're trying to,
[53:10] you know, they're trying to settle in
[53:11] there. They're trying to, you know, hey,
[53:13] make some friends and do this, but that
[53:15] land's not theirs. And God was going to
[53:17] make sure that they weren't comfortable
[53:18] in the land that they were in. It says
[53:21] here, "And Moses sent messengers from
[53:23] gate Kadesh unto the king of Eden. Thus
[53:26] saith thy brother."
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Not your neighbor.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Not your longtime friend once removed.
[53:36] Thy brother Israel. Thou knowest all the
[53:40] TO THE TRAVAIL THAT hath befallen us.
[53:42] How our fathers went down in Egypt, and
[53:44] how we dwelt in Egypt a long time. And
[53:46] the Egyptians vexed us and our fathers.
[53:48] And when we cried out unto the Lord,
[53:51] &gt;&gt; uhhuh,
[53:51] &gt;&gt; he heard our voice and sent an angel and
[53:53] have brought us forth of Egypt. And
[53:55] behold, we are in Kadesh and in the city
[53:57] of the most of the uttermost of the
[53:59] borders. Let us, I pray thee, through
[54:02] thy country. We will not pass through
[54:04] thy fields, through the vineyards,
[54:05] neither drink of the water of the wells,
[54:07] that we will go the king's highway, and
[54:09] we will not go to the right or left. We
[54:11] will we until we have passed through the
[54:13] borders. And Edom said unto him, "Thou
[54:16] shalt not pass by me."
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Lest I come out against thee with the
[54:21] sword.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Whoa. Talk about uncomfortable.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; You know, you Israel's thinking, "Hey,
[54:28] I'm just going to go talk to my bro and
[54:30] everything's going to be okay.
[54:31] Everything's going to be all right. I'm
[54:32] going to live next to him. We're going
[54:33] to live next to each other and
[54:35] everything's okay." He says, "No, and if
[54:36] you do, I'm going to come at you by the
[54:38] sword." And so they're like, "Okay." So
[54:40] they try it again. They go they they go
[54:43] to A-Rod and they go to Silo and then
[54:45] next thing you know and and and they go
[54:47] to these two these other ones that are
[54:49] their brothers that are their kindred
[54:50] and they say don't come to my borders
[54:52] and in fact they go to the borders with
[54:54] swords and men and they they end up
[54:55] getting to a battle and Israel has to
[54:57] destroy every one of them and God's
[54:59] making sure that they're that they're
[55:01] not comfortable in this wilderness.
[55:04] They're making sure that they're not set
[55:05] in roots that they're not set in place.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Okay. The wilderness was not their
[55:10] possession.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, Israel was out of their
[55:14] land and they went around this had to go
[55:17] around this mountain and this continuous
[55:19] cycle for 40 years to where they had to
[55:22] battle and they had to sustain and they
[55:24] had to fight this stuff and they had to
[55:25] they had in order to do these things
[55:27] they they couldn't plant here because
[55:29] this wasn't their land. It was it was
[55:31] this land and these people would
[55:32] constantly be trying to come back for it
[55:34] and they so they had to event they had
[55:36] to stay there. But during this time in
[55:38] the wilderness, you got to remember that
[55:40] there was an age group of people.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; That there was an age group of people of
[55:44] 20 and over that God had said, "I want
[55:46] every ONE OF YOU DEAD and nobody's going
[55:48] to go into the promised land until your
[55:50] corpse rots in the wilderness."
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[55:53] &gt;&gt; It's kind of heavy.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; It's kind of low down. And God tells you
[55:57] that I hate you so much that I'm going
[55:58] to wait until your corpse rots in the
[56:01] wilderness before I let your children
[56:03] even go over.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Whoa. It's kind of a lot there.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; And he just and during this time that in
[56:10] the wilderness, he's instructing his
[56:12] covenants and his laws and the and the
[56:14] children and these ones that these ones
[56:16] that that are that are the 20 and under,
[56:18] they're being instructed of the laws
[56:21] during this time in the wilderness.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Okay, now we're starting to make a
[56:24] transition. these two, the the Israel of
[56:27] old, the ones that had rejected, the
[56:29] ones that were unbelieving, the now
[56:31] they're instructing all of the young
[56:32] ones of the statutes of God and what God
[56:35] had done for them in Egypt and how that
[56:37] he provided them with water and how that
[56:39] he brought the mana and how that he he
[56:40] he had done ALL THESE GREAT BATTLES AND
[56:43] THROUGH THIS TIME PERIOD, all these OLD
[56:45] FIGHTERS BEGIN TO DIE OFF AND ALL THESE
[56:47] old ones that had seen the glory of the
[56:49] Lord in time past, they all begin TO DIE
[56:51] OFF. AND IT COME TO THE POINT THAT even
[56:53] Moses had come to his point in his time
[56:55] where he was going TO HAVE TO GO BY THE
[56:57] WAY OF THE GRAVE and you find that in
[56:59] the scriptures where you go and you see
[57:01] where where where these different ones
[57:03] were coming unto the promised land.
[57:05] Okay. Then you have Eleazar and God
[57:07] gives his commission to Moses to do what
[57:09] he needs to do to Eleazar and Eleazar is
[57:12] left there on the mountain and and God
[57:14] now God's coming and he's leading Moses
[57:16] and they're coming up to the promised
[57:17] land and he's instructing Joshua.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, Joshua was one of the two
[57:22] that were of a different spirit.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[57:30] And he's instructing Joshua, hey,
[57:33] the time of those that are about the age
[57:35] of 20 are coming up of age and all the
[57:38] old the other ones are are are fight are
[57:40] are are dying UP. AND WHEN YOU GO UPON
[57:43] WHEN YOU COME UPON this new land, I want
[57:45] you to sacrifice like this. And I want
[57:48] you to give thanks like this. and I want
[57:50] you and I want you to do these things
[57:51] that are pleasing unto the Lord. And
[57:53] Joshua's standing back and he's
[57:55] wondering what he's GOING TO DO WITHOUT
[57:57] MOSES AROUND.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And there's where we could stop the
[58:03] picture for a moment.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Now, all of this, as we talked about in
[58:09] the sermon in the past, is nothing has
[58:12] all to do with Israel, but more so to do
[58:15] with you.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and your walk with God
[58:18] &gt;&gt; and how you deal with things and how in
[58:21] your wilderness and where your journey
[58:23] is that you come with the Lord and where
[58:25] your where your stage is and where your
[58:26] walk is and and and and how you deal
[58:29] with the things of God. And we left off
[58:31] at the point where we come to Aanes
[58:33] BARNEA IN OUR LIFE TO where where we are
[58:36] GOING TO ACCEPT GOD. GOD HAS FINALLY
[58:38] BROUGHT US TO THE POINT, THE PINNACLE OF
[58:40] EVERYTHING that we've learned,
[58:42] everything that we're seeing, everything
[58:44] that that that WE'VE HEARD THROUGH THE
[58:45] MESSAGES, EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE heard
[58:47] through the scriptures and and and the
[58:50] sermons that ARE PREACHED AND WE BROUGHT
[58:52] UP AND HE SAYS, "GO AND POSSESS YOUR
[58:54] MOUNTAIN." AND WE STEP BACK AND WE ACT
[58:56] AS IF GOD IS NOT ABLE.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[59:00] &gt;&gt; And God has to run you through the meal
[59:02] and AROUND THE MOUNTAIN 40 DIFFERENT
[59:05] TIMES. You can pick pick whatever your
[59:07] number is. You can pick how many ever
[59:10] years that you want to deal with that
[59:11] unbelief that's in your life. Whether
[59:13] it's year one, year two, year three,
[59:16] year four. And God puts you around that
[59:18] mountain until he begins to put all of
[59:21] that unbelief to death. And he begins to
[59:23] take all the unbelief out of his people.
[59:25] And all the unbelief begins to come and
[59:28] it begins to strangulate, amen, the the
[59:30] the the sin of unbelief out of your
[59:33] life. And you begin to see, amen, all of
[59:35] these old things BEGIN TO DIE OFF, AMEN,
[59:38] out of your life. And then you begin to
[59:40] see where God is ushering in a new era
[59:43] for the believer. Now, we've come from
[59:45] justification. And we've come from
[59:47] sanctification. Amen. We we've BEEN
[59:49] WE'VE BEEN PULLED OUT of Egypt, the
[59:51] world. AMEN. AND GOD HAS BROUGHT SHOWN
[59:53] THE LIGHT OF THIS MESSAGE over us TO
[59:56] CALL US OUT OUT OF EGYPT. NOW, think
[59:58] about it. Egypt talked about THE GARLICS
[1:00:00] AND THEY'RE ALWAYS WANTING TO GO BACK to
[1:00:02] the garlics and and and and and and God
[1:00:04] was wanting to come AND JUST BURN OUT
[1:00:06] ALL THOSE BRIDGES AND DESTROY IT WITH
[1:00:08] THE RED SEA. And now that we've come to
[1:00:10] THIS PLACE IN OUR WALK, AMEN. What are
[1:00:13] we going to do when we come to THE
[1:00:15] BORDER OF GOD'S PROMISE FOR YOUR LIFE?
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; OKAY,
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; I can go back and I can look here.
[1:00:22] Now, we're talking about the life that
[1:00:24] parallels with the journey.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now look here. I thought this was
[1:00:30] an I thought this was an interesting
[1:00:32] quote
[1:00:36] if I could just find it here.
[1:00:40] It says, "A man outside of Caven knows
[1:00:42] nothing.
[1:00:44] He's still wandering." Not saying that
[1:00:46] he's not a good man. I don't say that. I
[1:00:49] don't say that a man even in Egypt's not
[1:00:51] a good man. But until he comes into
[1:00:56] this possession
[1:00:58] and the possession that the promise that
[1:01:01] we give to the church is not a natural
[1:01:03] land but it's a spiritual land for we
[1:01:06] are a royal priesthood a holy nation
[1:01:09] then in this royal priesthood holy
[1:01:11] nation peculiar people called out
[1:01:13] elected chosen set aside then all the
[1:01:16] world is dead on the outside and we are
[1:01:19] led by the spirit sons and daughters
[1:01:22] daughters of God, led by the spirit of
[1:01:24] God, NOT BY MAN, BUT BY THE SPIRIT. SO,
[1:01:27] now that we've talked about that, this
[1:01:29] man, Amen, doesn't that this man knows
[1:01:33] nothing and he's still wandering, you're
[1:01:35] still trying to figure out where you are
[1:01:37] in the plan of God, wandering in between
[1:01:39] Egypt and the promised land.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Still wandering IN BETWEEN JUSTIFICATION
[1:01:43] AND SANCTIFICATION. You know, I got to
[1:01:46] be good here and has God called ME OR
[1:01:48] HAS GOD CALLED me not? YOU KNOW, OR OR
[1:01:50] OR you know what? I I seen the miracles,
[1:01:53] amen, boldly with my eyes through
[1:01:55] brother window. Or I seen boldly through
[1:01:57] my eyes, amen, the the prayer requests
[1:01:59] that were answered, amen, through this
[1:02:01] brother or that brother. AMEN. AND
[1:02:03] YOU'VE SEEN ALL THESE things and you
[1:02:05] come to that place and you come to your
[1:02:07] SPEIA AND YOU REJECT GOD.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Just like the children of Israel did.
[1:02:14] They come to that point and the believer
[1:02:17] comes to that point in their walk WHERE
[1:02:19] YOU WILL ACCEPT AND YOU WILL WALK INTO
[1:02:21] the promised LAND OR YOU'LL REJECT GOD
[1:02:24] AND YOU'LL STAY IN SANCTIFICATION AND IN
[1:02:26] JUSTIFICATION. AMEN. And you'll not move
[1:02:28] on into the new land.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; What is the new land? As we talked about
[1:02:33] in the times back, y'all y'all just bear
[1:02:34] with me. I got to make that transition.
[1:02:37] Amen. Amen. Over into there. It's kind
[1:02:38] of like, you know, how many of you ever
[1:02:40] standed boards? you know, you got two
[1:02:41] boards that are like this, you know, and
[1:02:43] and you're trying to transition those
[1:02:44] two and you just got to sand them down,
[1:02:45] you know, until until it gets to that
[1:02:47] point where it's all leveled out. And
[1:02:48] that's where we're trying to get to is
[1:02:50] just leveling it out here. Amen. So you
[1:02:52] you're trying so you come to that place
[1:02:54] where there's a rest.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; You got to come to a rest with God.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; It says they are like the children of
[1:03:02] Israel who came out of Egypt AND STOPPED
[1:03:05] SHORT OF THE PROMISED LAND.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:03:12] that deserved a wow.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And they STOPPED SHORT OF THE PROMISED
[1:03:20] LAND.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Who came out of Egypt and stopped short
[1:03:24] of the promised land. Now those children
[1:03:26] of Israel left out about 2 million
[1:03:28] strong. They all JOURNEYED TOGETHER. ALL
[1:03:31] SAW THE SAME MIRACLES. ALL partaken of
[1:03:34] the same mana. all the water FROM THE
[1:03:36] SMITTEN ROCK AND FOLLOWED THE same cloud
[1:03:38] by day and the pillar of power by power
[1:03:40] by night. Only two reached the promised
[1:03:43] land. Only two were the real believers.
[1:03:46] That is correct because the word tells
[1:03:47] you THAT THE REST DIED BECAUSE OF THEIR
[1:03:50] UNBELIEF.
[1:03:52] And because of their unbelief, they
[1:03:53] could not enter. Hebrews 13:19. Then
[1:03:56] since it is so the only two that
[1:03:58] entered, the rest were not true
[1:04:00] believers. What made the difference? two
[1:04:03] stayed with the word when the hearts of
[1:04:05] the 10 spies failed AT KANES BARNEA,
[1:04:08] JOSHUA and Caleb did not stagger, for
[1:04:10] they believed the word that was said,
[1:04:12] "We are more than able to take the
[1:04:15] land." They knew they could because God
[1:04:17] had said, "I have given you the land."
[1:04:20] After all the Israelites saw the power
[1:04:22] and the goodness and the deliverance of
[1:04:24] God, they did not enter into rest.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; They did not enter into rest.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You've seen how God can deliver
[1:04:34] those that are underneath drugs and
[1:04:35] alcohol. You seen how God can deliver
[1:04:38] out of depression. You seen how God can
[1:04:40] can miraculously create a liver. You
[1:04:43] seen how God can restore eyes. You seen
[1:04:46] how God can come down in the power of
[1:04:48] this world or come down in the power of
[1:04:51] the word. Amen. Manifest through bodies
[1:04:53] and MANIFEST THROUGH THE WORD. Manifest
[1:04:55] through songs. Manifest through ALL
[1:04:57] THESE THINGS. AND YOU CAN COME TO CHURCH
[1:04:59] AND YOU REJECT GOD'S WORD WHEN IT STANDS
[1:05:01] BEFORE YOUR EYES. YOU STAND AS AN
[1:05:03] UNBELIEVER, UNPOWERED, NOT ABLE TO MOVE
[1:05:06] ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE BECAUSE YOU COME
[1:05:09] TO THE BORDER OF YOUR PROMISE AND YOU
[1:05:11] COUNT GOD AS UNFAITHFUL.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; You count him as unfaithful when you
[1:05:17] nonchalotely walk INTO THE CHURCH DOORS
[1:05:19] AND YOU ACT as if GOD IS JUST SOMETHING
[1:05:21] ELSE. AMEN. that you can just come and
[1:05:23] you could just you could just put your
[1:05:24] time in and you could walk out and you
[1:05:26] wonder where wonder why you're going
[1:05:29] through the trials. You wonder why
[1:05:30] you're going through THE SITUATIONS AND
[1:05:32] YOU WONDER WHY IT'S BECAUSE YOU DID NOT
[1:05:35] TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD TO PREVAIL. I mean
[1:05:38] for the things that ARE IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:05:39] YOU MUST ENTER INTO REST THAT GOD IS
[1:05:42] GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; WHAT is the Holy Ghost? What is it? IT'S
[1:05:49] A REST. IT
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; IS GOD COMING IN AND IT'S COVERING THE
[1:05:54] FIBERS AND THE PORES OF THE OF OF of the
[1:05:56] world. I loved how brother Window talked
[1:05:59] about it. He talked about the shittwood
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; and he talked about how the gold being
[1:06:03] overlaid over the shittwood. What is
[1:06:05] that shittwood? That shitwood is it's
[1:06:06] not just it's just a little porous, you
[1:06:09] know, it's it's it's it's just horrible
[1:06:12] wood and it's just horrible. And that's
[1:06:14] what you are. You're a horrible wood.
[1:06:16] You weren't fit for nothing. You weren't
[1:06:18] fit for anything to build. Amen. For the
[1:06:21] master's use, amen. But yet that your
[1:06:24] pits and your scars and the things that
[1:06:26] you've gone through of unbelief can be
[1:06:29] sewed up and that could be soaked in by
[1:06:31] the deity of the Holy Ghost and God's
[1:06:33] spirit to where it could COVER EVERY
[1:06:36] PORE OF unbelief in your life to where
[1:06:38] all that reflects is the MANIFESTATION
[1:06:40] OF GOD'S GLORY OF HIS WORD. AMEN. BEING
[1:06:43] DISTRIBUTED, MANIFESTED throughout elite
[1:06:47] body of a group of believers on this
[1:06:50] day.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; So they come up into that promise and
[1:07:00] they come up to that place and now now
[1:07:02] they come to that place and they've laid
[1:07:04] everything. The prophet the prophet is
[1:07:06] off the scene. Now they come to this
[1:07:09] place AND NOW JOSHUA WAS holding the
[1:07:11] bag. Joshua's standing there and he's
[1:07:13] like he's just like whoa. And you know
[1:07:15] he had just come off of this scene where
[1:07:17] where Moses was. Could you imagine
[1:07:19] filling the shoes of Moses?
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Not I, you know, not I. You're talking
[1:07:26] about somebody that You're talking about
[1:07:28] somebody that went out there and he
[1:07:29] split the Red Sea with a stick.
[1:07:32] You're talking about somebody that just
[1:07:33] looked up and fire rain from heaven. He
[1:07:36] come out and he he come out and the the
[1:07:38] the the the river Euphrates, the one
[1:07:40] that the God that that they worshiped,
[1:07:42] the mother, the birth of all living
[1:07:44] things around that area, God defied
[1:07:47] their their the God that they served by
[1:07:49] turning it into blood and made it
[1:07:50] unhabitable. Made it to where to where
[1:07:53] every living thing could had to escape
[1:07:55] from it. You couldn't DRINK FROM IT. GOD
[1:07:57] HAD DONE ALL THESE THINGS THROUGH MOSES.
[1:07:59] And now Joshua's like, "Me?"
[1:08:02] Yeah. You
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; and you and you.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And you.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he looks at this and you can
[1:08:13] go back and you can find in the
[1:08:14] scripture right here. You can find in
[1:08:16] Joshua 1 and5. There shall not any man
[1:08:19] be able to stand before thee in all the
[1:08:21] days of thy life. As I
[1:08:26] I That was not Donald Trump.
[1:08:29] Donald Trump didn't say as I
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; was with Moses.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; It wasn't your granddad. It wasn't your
[1:08:38] mom. It wasn't doctor so and so. It
[1:08:41] wasn't this person. He says he says
[1:08:44] therefore not any man stand before thee.
[1:08:46] As I was with Moses, so shall I be with
[1:08:50] thee, and I will not fail thee, nor will
[1:08:53] I forsake thee. Amen. You got to be able
[1:08:56] to come up and be able to you be able to
[1:08:58] come to your promised land and be able
[1:08:59] to be like, you know what? AMEN. I'M
[1:09:01] TIRED of living in the wilderness and
[1:09:03] I'm TIRED OF I'M TIRED OF LIVING WITHOUT
[1:09:05] PURPOSE. I'M TIRED OF SERVING GOD
[1:09:07] WITHOUT PURPOSE. I'M TIRED OF COMING TO
[1:09:09] church and I'm TIRED OF SITTING ON A PEW
[1:09:11] and I'm tired of just listening to what
[1:09:13] THE PREACHER SAID. I'M TIRED OF JUST
[1:09:14] LISTENING TO A QUOTE. I'M TIRED OF JUST
[1:09:16] READING THINGS, AMEN, HALF-HAZARDLY AND
[1:09:18] NONCHALANTLY. AMEN. BUT I'M READY TO
[1:09:21] walk into the FRUITS OF THE PROMISED
[1:09:23] LAND. AMEN. THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN. I've
[1:09:25] seen the miracles through William
[1:09:27] Brandon's ministry. I'VE SEEN THE
[1:09:29] MIRACLES NOT ONLY THROUGH HIS MINISTRY,
[1:09:31] BUT DIFFERENT ONES. DARYL WARD HAD HAD A
[1:09:33] DAUGHTER WHO WAS BROUGHT BACK. HER SIGHT
[1:09:36] WAS BROUGHT BACK. AMEN. THAT'S A LIVING
[1:09:38] TESTIMONY OF THE EVIDENCE. AMEN. THAT
[1:09:41] GOD IS BROUGHT BACK TO US THAT HE'S
[1:09:42] LIVING, THAT HE'S REAL. AND THAT SAME
[1:09:45] POWER THAT DWELLS IN THOSE MEN AND THAT
[1:09:47] DWELT IN THAT DWELT IN THOSE PEOPLE CAN
[1:09:50] COME AND IT can inlay itself through the
[1:09:52] Holy Ghost inside you.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; So we begin to see, you know,
[1:10:03] I begin to match things. You know,
[1:10:06] sometimes if you're not, you begin to
[1:10:08] see things and you begin to know things
[1:10:10] by its characteristics.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, some of your children,
[1:10:15] you adults, I could tell exactly who
[1:10:20] whose children they belong to by those
[1:10:23] characteristics.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Poor Dylan and Austin.
[1:10:28] [panting]
[1:10:30] I can see their characteristics of who
[1:10:32] they belong to.
[1:10:34] [panting and sighs]
[1:10:36] I can see those things. I can see
[1:10:39] characteristics that are there. So all
[1:10:41] of a sudden you begin to look you know
[1:10:42] what you know there was a lot of people
[1:10:44] that was there that didn't hear Moses
[1:10:46] tell Joshua if as I was with as I was
[1:10:49] with or you know as I was with Moses so
[1:10:52] shall I be with thee was a lot of people
[1:10:53] that wasn't there so all of a sudden
[1:10:55] yeah the as a natural man as a natural
[1:10:57] woman you begin to look at the
[1:10:58] characteristics and you begin to look at
[1:11:00] the things that God did with Moses and
[1:11:02] if God was with Moses then he'll be with
[1:11:04] Joshua so you begin to see right there
[1:11:06] in Joshua 3 and 15 and they said and
[1:11:09] they said that and as they said they
[1:11:11] they bear the ark were were coming uh
[1:11:14] unto Jordan and the feet of the priests
[1:11:16] that bear the ark were dipped in the
[1:11:18] brim of the water. For Jordan overflowed
[1:11:21] at its bank at a time of harvest that
[1:11:23] the waters which came from from the
[1:11:25] above stood and rose upon the heap of
[1:11:27] the far uh from the city of Adam that
[1:11:29] was beside Zeratan. and those that came
[1:11:32] downward to the sea of the plain even at
[1:11:34] the salt sea failed and were cut off and
[1:11:36] the people passed right over against
[1:11:39] Jericho. Now think about this. You got
[1:11:41] Joshua splitting water and then you got
[1:11:43] Moses splitting water, you know, and and
[1:11:46] there in Joshua 6 and 20. So the people
[1:11:48] shouted when the priests blew with the
[1:11:50] trumpets. And it came to pass that when
[1:11:52] the people had heard the sound of the
[1:11:53] trumpet and the people shouted with a
[1:11:55] great shout, you see that Joshua was
[1:11:57] beginning to move into the promised land
[1:12:00] and he's beginning to possess it. He's
[1:12:02] beginning to possess the land. Now think
[1:12:04] about this now. Now, now Joshua,
[1:12:08] now now the the whole purpose, the whole
[1:12:11] motive, the whole everything around
[1:12:14] Israel begins to change when they begin
[1:12:16] to go into the land that God had had had
[1:12:19] desired for them to have. Amen. Now
[1:12:22] they're stepping out of a place. Amen.
[1:12:24] They're stepping out of this. They're
[1:12:25] stepping out of this. I don't think, you
[1:12:27] know, I I don't belong here. You all
[1:12:30] these people are fighting me. All these
[1:12:31] things. And all it's doing is it's
[1:12:33] pushing them into their homeland. And
[1:12:35] now they step into this homeland. Now
[1:12:37] there's a difference when they step into
[1:12:40] this homeland is because God has
[1:12:42] positionally placed them to be in that
[1:12:46] land. He said that he'd given them a
[1:12:48] land that flowth with milk and honey.
[1:12:51] The milk and honey was there. THE 10
[1:12:53] SPIES BROUGHT BACK THE PROOF THAT THE
[1:12:54] milk and honey was there, that the
[1:12:56] grapes were there, that the Hittites
[1:12:58] were there, that the Canaanites were
[1:12:59] there, that the Jebusites were there,
[1:13:01] and that WAS EVERYTHING THAT GOD SAID
[1:13:03] THAT THAT THAT was going to be there.
[1:13:05] But he said that IT WAS YOUR LAND TO
[1:13:07] TAKE. And so they had to the same faith
[1:13:10] that that that that the Israel before
[1:13:13] failed to have to go into the promised
[1:13:15] land is the same faith that the Israel
[1:13:18] that come to possess the land. THEY
[1:13:20] BEGIN TO WALK INTO THAT LAND BECAUSE
[1:13:23] THEY FULLHEARTEDLY BELIEVED THAT GOD WAS
[1:13:26] WITH THEM AND THAT GOD WOULD WOULD FIGHT
[1:13:28] FOR THEM AND GOD WOULD HELP THEM POSSESS
[1:13:30] THE LAND THAT THEY HAD AND GOD DID IT.
[1:13:33] AND EVERY TIME THEY CONQUERED a they
[1:13:35] conquered a Jericho, EVERY TIME THEY
[1:13:38] CONQUERED THE WALL AND THE FENCE CITIES
[1:13:40] and there was nothing that could stand
[1:13:42] before them.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; What was happening?
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; What was happening?
[1:13:50] Bless the Lord. It's good.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; What was happening?
[1:13:55] I'll tell you what happened. Just a
[1:13:57] second.
[1:13:59] I tell you what happened.
[1:14:03] Is that you weren't dealing with the
[1:14:05] same Israel
[1:14:07] before
[1:14:09] that Israel didn't know where she
[1:14:11] belonged.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; That Israel, she was just stuck out into
[1:14:15] the wilderness. And God's just like,
[1:14:17] "Keep going to the promised land." and
[1:14:18] he's leaning on this Israel, you know,
[1:14:20] she's she's fighting this and she's
[1:14:22] fighting that, you know, but but but but
[1:14:23] but she she's she's chose to stay in the
[1:14:26] wilderness because she didn't want to
[1:14:28] move any further.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; But there come
[1:14:33] a new age, if I could put it this way,
[1:14:36] there come another time
[1:14:39] where Israel had heard of it and they
[1:14:42] desire to possess the land. Now we look
[1:14:45] here they're in uh adoption one it says
[1:14:49] now he's talking to the spiritual
[1:14:52] Canaanites Israel the spiritual Israel
[1:14:56] who's possessed the land or aren't you
[1:14:58] glad that you've come out of Egypt's
[1:15:01] garlic
[1:15:02] aren't you glad that you've come out of
[1:15:04] the wilderness and remember they had to
[1:15:08] eat mana angel's food out of heaven
[1:15:11] until they crossed over into the land
[1:15:14] and when crossed over into the land.
[1:15:17] Mana ceased to fall.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; they were fully mature then.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; GOD wasn't having to go around and hold
[1:15:26] their hand everywhere that they go and
[1:15:27] they're like, "Hey, HE'S JUST OKAY. NOW,
[1:15:30] WATCH AS DADDY GOES over here and
[1:15:32] destroys the bad guys for you." You
[1:15:34] know, just just not having to hold their
[1:15:36] hand everywhere that they go. Stop
[1:15:38] sinning. Stop doing this. Stop doing
[1:15:42] that. is because they DIDN'T BELIEVE
[1:15:43] THAT GOD WOULD DO WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD
[1:15:45] DO.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; And remember, they had to eat mana,
[1:15:51] angels fruit out of heaven until they
[1:15:52] crossed over into the new land. And when
[1:15:54] they crossed over into the new land,
[1:15:56] mana ceased to fall. They were fully
[1:15:59] mature then. And they and they ate or
[1:16:02] and they ate the old corn of the land.
[1:16:05] Now, not now that you're not babies
[1:16:10] anymore. Let me say that again. and they
[1:16:12] eat the old corn of the land. Now, now
[1:16:15] that you're not babies anymore, now that
[1:16:17] you're not desiring the sincere milk of
[1:16:21] the gospel,
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; can I can I preach? Is this all right?
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Not desire desiring to get off the milk,
[1:16:35] OFF GOD'S BOTTLE.
[1:16:38] desiring to GET OFF GOD'S BOTTLE TO BE
[1:16:40] ABLE to be a mature Christian.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Not sitting here desiring what can the
[1:16:46] church do for me?
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; What can God do for me with a with a
[1:16:53] welfare type mentality? What can what
[1:16:56] what what's God going to do for me?
[1:16:58] WHAT'S GOD NO. I'M A SON.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; WHAT CAN I DO TO ADVANCE HIS KINGDOM?
[1:17:03] WHAT DID God do when he was a young boy?
[1:17:05] Don't you not know that I must BE ABOUT
[1:17:07] MY FATHER'S BUSINESS? And this is a
[1:17:09] little kid. Amen. He's going out and
[1:17:11] he's debating with the Sadducees and the
[1:17:13] Pharisees. This this group of people
[1:17:15] that went into the promised land came
[1:17:18] mature. They came to saying WE'VE COME
[1:17:21] TO POSSESS THE land that God had given
[1:17:23] us.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Gym mature and they ate the old corn of
[1:17:27] the land. Now they they're not babies
[1:17:29] anymore. That they're not desiring the
[1:17:30] sinc sincere milk of the gospel. that
[1:17:33] they don't they don't have to be babyed
[1:17:35] and powdered and and persuaded to come
[1:17:37] to church.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Now, you're not desiring the sincere
[1:17:49] milk of the gospel. You don't have to be
[1:17:51] baby and p and persuaded to come to
[1:17:53] church now that you're fully
[1:17:57] matured.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:02] Doesn't matter what Joe does to me.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Joe's made me mad plenty of times.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; And Joe will continue to make me mad
[1:18:11] plenty of times.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; But I don't come to church because of
[1:18:17] Joe.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; I don't come to church because because
[1:18:23] Joe comes to church. And if Joe fails
[1:18:26] me, then I'm not coming to church.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; I am fully persuaded. that the man that
[1:18:32] comes up behind this desk and the gospel
[1:18:35] that's being preached, amen, I AM FULLY
[1:18:38] PERSUADED THAT THAT IS MY MEAT, AMEN,
[1:18:41] FOR THIS DAY AND IN THIS HOUR.
[1:18:43] THEREFORE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME,
[1:18:45] AMEN, TO BE AT CHURCH. You don't have to
[1:18:47] tell me to listen to tape. YOU DON'T
[1:18:49] HAVE TO TELL ME, AMEN, AMEN, to pray
[1:18:52] every day. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME

[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; The problem is
[1:19:06] we walk around as Christians with
[1:19:07] binkies in our mouth.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't going to work in the promise.
[1:19:12] Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Nursing on your last revival.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Nursing on the last time that a minister
[1:19:23] came through. Nursing that the last time
[1:19:25] when when when you're to go out and
[1:19:26] you're to Aren't you represented as the
[1:19:29] eagle? Yeah.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Aren't you represented to be able to go
[1:19:31] out and find your own meat and go out
[1:19:33] and to kill your own prey and to go out
[1:19:35] and to do these own things instead of
[1:19:37] having to just wait and wait for your
[1:19:39] pastor or your or the minister to be
[1:19:41] able to come up and feed you. This ain't
[1:19:43] no food line, you know. This ain't
[1:19:44] something that you just come through.
[1:19:46] Amen. He the word that he's preaching
[1:19:48] should be vindicating what you're
[1:19:49] listening to.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; The word that he's preaching should be
[1:19:52] something that you know what, I know
[1:19:54] that that's the truth because I heard
[1:19:55] the messenger of the hour preach that. I
[1:19:57] read that in my Bible. So what he's
[1:19:59] saying is the truth and it ping and it
[1:20:01] amens you. Amen. But there's no pinging
[1:20:04] because there's no reading and there's
[1:20:05] no listening and there's none of that
[1:20:07] going on. That's why there's no amen
[1:20:09] going on. Amen. And that's what happens
[1:20:11] is because we're used to the milk.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; We would rather get the world's
[1:20:16] supplement.

[1:20:21] rather get on some app.
[1:20:25] Yeah.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; We would rather get on some app
[1:20:28] somewhere and be like, "VOICE OF GOD,
[1:20:30] SHOW ME WHAT I'm to read today."
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.

[1:20:52] family needs? for you today.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; How about GOING OUT AND SAYING, "YOU
[1:20:58] KNOW WHAT? I'M BATTLING, AMEN, this
[1:21:00] demon of depression in my family, and
[1:21:02] I'm not going to rely on this sap and
[1:21:04] I'm not going to rely on on this person.
[1:21:06] I'm not going to rely ON THAT ONE. I'M
[1:21:07] GOING TO GO TO MY CONCORDANCE, AND I'M
[1:21:10] GOING TO FIND IT FOR MYSELF, AND I'M
[1:21:12] GOING TO GO AND I'M GOING TO SAY, "AMEN,
[1:21:14] I'M A I'M A MATURE SEED."
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I AM A MATURE CHRISTIAN AND I'M IN
[1:21:20] MY PROMISE BECAUSE I'M FILLED WITH THE
[1:21:22] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. I'm resting
[1:21:25] upon God's word of the hour and I am not
[1:21:28] waiting for the fight to come to me but
[1:21:31] I AM GOING TO THE FIGHT. [applause]
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:37] You know during this whole entire time
[1:21:39] you watch you watch as Mo when Moses was
[1:21:42] come was going through the wilderness
[1:21:44] and now now you remember that there was
[1:21:46] a battle that was that was going on and
[1:21:48] Moses had to go out and he had to and
[1:21:51] and in in this battle as long as Moses's
[1:21:54] hands were raised.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; The battle was going
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; as long as the word was being exalted.
[1:22:03] as long as the word was being was being
[1:22:05] was was being waved over the people.
[1:22:08] Amen. The the the Israel was winning.
[1:22:10] And all of a sudden, he began to go
[1:22:12] down. He began to let down the bars and
[1:22:14] the word began to get tired and he began
[1:22:16] to come down. And so Joshua sent men up
[1:22:19] there to prop the word up. And that's
[1:22:21] what we do. Amen. You prop the word. You
[1:22:23] I mean, you don't got to prop the word
[1:22:25] up, but but you know what? You see the
[1:22:27] word, Amen. beginning to deviate down in
[1:22:29] your life. You go up there. Amen. And
[1:22:31] you prop it up. Amen. because it's that
[1:22:33] that brings you victory. But I also want
[1:22:35] to point something else out to you
[1:22:39] underneath Joshua.
[1:22:41] Joshua was in a battle as well.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Joshua was in the middle of he was
[1:22:46] battling the five kings
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; and he was right there. It was one of
[1:22:49] the last battles that he was going to
[1:22:51] have to go through before Amen. before
[1:22:54] the the taking of the complete promised
[1:22:56] land. And time was beginning to
[1:22:58] transpire and his men were spread out
[1:23:01] all throughout the field. And he was
[1:23:02] standing and he was looking at the
[1:23:04] battlefield AND HE WAS WATCHING all
[1:23:06] these things beginning to take place.
[1:23:08] But he knew that if he retired from the
[1:23:10] war that the enemy which were great and
[1:23:13] numbered and they had them all split up
[1:23:15] and strategically divided to where they
[1:23:17] could conquer the enemy. But he knew
[1:23:18] that if they would all regroup and that
[1:23:20] they would have time, amen, that they
[1:23:22] wouldn't be able to overcome them. Now
[1:23:24] look, amen. It was a prophet back then
[1:23:27] that had went out there and it was his
[1:23:29] hands that were being raised up. It was
[1:23:31] the word in the prophet his hands being
[1:23:34] raised up. Amen. That was saying but YET
[1:23:36] IT WAS JOSHUA. AMEN. He did it. It was
[1:23:39] the word that laid INSIDE JOSHUA THAT
[1:23:42] TURNED AND HE SAID, "SON, STAND STILL
[1:23:45] OVER GIDEON." AMEN. AND IT WAS THE WORD
[1:23:47] THAT WAS BEING SPOKEN OVER AN
[1:23:49] INDIVIDUAL. AMEN. It was THEM SPEAKING
[1:23:52] THE WORD. AMEN. THE SUN STAND STILL THAT
[1:23:55] I CAN CONQUER over my enemy. And it's
[1:23:57] you. It's not the prophet no longer
[1:24:00] speaking the word, BUT IT'S YOU, THE
[1:24:02] BRIDE OVER YOUR SITUATION SPEAKING THE
[1:24:04] WORD. You can overcome your enemy.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; You can overcome.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; You can come to your mountain.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Say, "Be thou removed and cast into the
[1:24:17] sea."
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; You can do these things.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Now, think about this. They were coming
[1:24:24] with a divine purpose.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna finish this quote. They were
[1:24:30] further matured Christians and ready to
[1:24:32] to eat the strong meat. Now you're ready
[1:24:34] to come into something. He says you're
[1:24:36] ready to uh understand something that's
[1:24:39] deep.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; That's rich.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Oh well, we'll get into it directly in a
[1:24:47] way. It's hidden since the it's been
[1:24:48] hidden since the foundations of the
[1:24:50] world. He said, "Now that you've come to
[1:24:52] this, I'm addressing this to you, not to
[1:24:54] those that have just left Egypt."
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Not your boarding call.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Those of you that are still in Egypt,
[1:25:07] still don't know whether God's going to
[1:25:08] do something for you,
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; still don't believe that he's powerful,
[1:25:12] still hanging, still hinging off of
[1:25:14] whether God can do this. This this isn't
[1:25:16] for you. Yeah.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; You you your mountain's over there.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; You just keep spinning around your
[1:25:25] mountain over there. But there come a
[1:25:26] generation of people that was like, I am
[1:25:28] tired of going around the mountain.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; There come a generation of people that
[1:25:32] you know what? I'm tired of drugs and
[1:25:34] alcohol destroying my family.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of depression destroying my
[1:25:37] family. I'm tired of anxieties. I'm
[1:25:40] tired of of of family issues. I'm tired
[1:25:42] of of hereditary problems. I'm tired of
[1:25:45] health problems. I'm tired of all these
[1:25:47] things that are coming into my family.
[1:25:49] Amen. Why do we just stand here? I'm
[1:25:51] just going to die, Amen. with this
[1:25:52] problem, with this headache, with this
[1:25:54] infirmity. I'm going to die with all
[1:25:55] these things anyway. You know what? GOD,
[1:25:58] YOU'RE FAITHFUL. GOD, I BELIEVE YOU,
[1:26:00] GOD. AMEN. I'M taking the fight to them.
[1:26:02] I'M I'M TIRED OF SITTING THERE. NOW, as
[1:26:04] they begin to go through this journey
[1:26:09] now, as they begin to go through this
[1:26:11] journey and they begin to go through and
[1:26:13] they've conquered AI.
[1:26:15] Yeah.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; And they conquered Gibden
[1:26:18] and all the five kings. They'd all come
[1:26:20] and they all come against him. And they
[1:26:22] all come against him. And he and he AND
[1:26:24] HE PUSHED THESE FIVE KINGS BACK INTO
[1:26:27] BACK into a cave and they rolled a stone
[1:26:29] over them.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; And he comes back. Now these people,
[1:26:37] there's a difference when you're not
[1:26:40] fighting for anything from but when
[1:26:42] you're fighting for something.
[1:26:45] Okay.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, your life is worth
[1:26:48] fighting for.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Your children,
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; your grandchildren are worth fighting
[1:26:55] for.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Your presence in this congregation as an
[1:27:00] elder, as a pillar, as a post, as a sign
[1:27:04] that somebody can look to and say, "YOU
[1:27:06] KNOW WHAT? THAT'S SOMEBODY THAT'S
[1:27:07] WEATHERED THE STORM. That's somebody
[1:27:09] that's possessing their land. THAT'S
[1:27:11] SOMEBODY GOD IS PLEASED WITH.
[1:27:14] YEAH.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; NOW, as they begin to roll this stone
[1:27:17] over the over the over the lid of the
[1:27:21] five kings, Joshua begins to come back
[1:27:23] and they roll it back over. And we know
[1:27:25] how the story goes about how Joshua
[1:27:28] commands the children of Israel to put
[1:27:30] their heels up against their neck and he
[1:27:33] begins to cut their heads off one by
[1:27:35] one. and that that this day forever more
[1:27:38] that they will never see these kings
[1:27:40] anymore, nor they'll be tormented, NOR
[1:27:42] THEY BE NOR THAT NOR THAT THEY would be
[1:27:44] that they would be in any way, SHAPE OR
[1:27:46] FORM AND BE INHIBITED BY their presence.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; All right? AND JOSHUA BEGINS TO JOSHUA
[1:27:53] BEGINS TO come and then he he he the
[1:27:56] scripture says that he gets old in years
[1:27:59] and at this point that he possesses THE
[1:28:01] LAND AND JOSHUA COMES TO THIS PLACE AND
[1:28:03] HE BEGINS TO DIVIDE OUT THE LAND.
[1:28:07] NOW, this is something that pretty that
[1:28:09] that struck me as he begin to divide out
[1:28:13] the land
[1:28:14] and he begin to come out. He they begin
[1:28:17] to come out and he begin to give Nas
[1:28:19] Manasseh their their land and he begins
[1:28:22] to give Ephraim their land and he begins
[1:28:24] to give all these other ones their land
[1:28:26] and he begin to notice that every if you
[1:28:28] begin to notice that every TRIBE BEGINS
[1:28:31] TO FIT the land that they were given.
[1:28:34] Okay? And if you think and if you look
[1:28:36] at this, you can go back. You can go
[1:28:38] back and do
[1:28:42] there in adoption one. It says each one
[1:28:44] of them Hebrew mothers. Now think about
[1:28:46] this.
[1:28:48] And I thought this tied in beautifully
[1:28:49] because now Israel's in the promised
[1:28:52] land. Israel's in their inheritance.
[1:28:55] They've conquered the land and they've
[1:28:57] come to this place. And now and now
[1:28:58] they're coming to this place that God
[1:29:00] has says it's been yours.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, each one of these Hebrew
[1:29:04] mothers giving birth to these children,
[1:29:06] they spoke
[1:29:08] of the very place in her labor pains
[1:29:14] where they would be positioned
[1:29:17] in the promised land. Oh, IT IS GREAT
[1:29:21] STUDY. IF WE COULD ONLY go into detail,
[1:29:24] which which could take hours, someday we
[1:29:28] would get when we get our church fixed.
[1:29:30] I just like to COME TO TAKE A SOLID
[1:29:32] MONTH JUST TO SAY IT RIGHT. WATCH WHEN
[1:29:34] EACH one of these mothers when she
[1:29:37] called out Ephraim when she was in labor
[1:29:41] positionally placed him where his feet
[1:29:44] was sitting in oil just every one of him
[1:29:48] where they were at.
[1:29:51] And Joshua not knowing this, but by
[1:29:54] inspiration led of the Holy Spirit after
[1:29:57] being led to the promised land, each
[1:30:00] gave each man his promise, exactly what
[1:30:03] the Holy Spirit promised them back
[1:30:06] before birth.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel WERE WALKING INTO
[1:30:11] SOMETHING THAT GOD HAD ALREADY
[1:30:12] predestinated them to have.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when they were walking in the
[1:30:17] wilderness, the first time that the rock
[1:30:19] was smoked, when the mana was laid down
[1:30:21] in heaven, there was there was questions
[1:30:23] in their mind or if they were able to be
[1:30:25] able TO POSSESS THE LAND. But before the
[1:30:29] founder, before Ephraim was born,
[1:30:31] MANASSES WAS BORN, GOD HAD GIVEN THEIR
[1:30:34] MOTHERS through inspiration the name of
[1:30:37] the land and the name of the place that
[1:30:40] they would go. SO WHEN THEY GO TO THE
[1:30:42] PROMISED LAND without assurance, without
[1:30:44] any doubt, THEY COULD REALIZE THAT GOD
[1:30:47] HAD GIVEN THEM THIS LAND of promise.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; You're talking about being able to walk
[1:30:52] in and say, you know what, this is mine.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Hey, this is mine. Hey, I don't know. I
[1:30:57] don't know what you say, but before I
[1:30:58] was even born and my mother had given me
[1:31:00] of this birth. Amen. And God,
[1:31:09] this is where mindbomb emoji comes.
[1:31:13] [snorts]
[1:31:14] Listen to this Pentecostal. Listen or
[1:31:17] listen to this. Not Pentecostal. Listen
[1:31:20] to this.
[1:31:22] Predestination
[1:31:24] looks back to fornowledge. I mean
[1:31:27] election. He says election looks back to
[1:31:29] fornowledge. and predestined looks to
[1:31:32] destiny. Don't forget that election
[1:31:35] looks back here. Here it is. I was a
[1:31:37] conqueror. I was born in sin shapen in
[1:31:41] iniquity. Come into this world speaking
[1:31:43] ly born among sither s s s s s s s s s s
[1:31:45] s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
[1:31:45] s s s s s s s s s s sinners, fathers and
[1:31:46] mothers and all my who or whole family
[1:31:49] sinners. I was a cocker bird, but all of
[1:31:51] a sudden I became a a wheat grain. How
[1:31:54] did it happen? What was that? Election.
[1:31:59] election. God before the foundation of
[1:32:02] the world elected the cocker was was to
[1:32:05] become A GRAIN OF WHEAT. NOW I know I'm
[1:32:07] a grain of wheat because I'm saved. How
[1:32:09] did I do it? I looked back and see that
[1:32:13] he predestinated it A LONG TIME BY
[1:32:18] FORNOWLEDGE. He seen that I would love
[1:32:21] him. So he made a perpetuation through
[1:32:24] his son that through him I might become
[1:32:26] a cocker to a grain of wheat. Now, where
[1:32:29] am I at now? I'm saved. I'M WALKING
[1:32:31] THROUGH GRACE. WHAT DOES predestination
[1:32:33] look? It looks to destiny. What are the
[1:32:37] Where will he take me to? And where I'm
[1:32:40] going? Amen. That's got you. That's
[1:32:42] where you are. Now, let's now let's just
[1:32:45] a little further. Then we'll have to
[1:32:48] close pretty soon. According. He's
[1:32:49] reading a scripture. According
[1:32:52] according. We're talking about God
[1:32:54] predestinating us.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; THIS WAS ALL TYPED OUT THROUGH ISRAEL.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; YOU JUST THOUGHT that you were reading
[1:33:03] just Moses and a little being stuck in
[1:33:06] the bull rush and you just THOUGHT THAT
[1:33:08] YOU WERE JUST READING THE LITTLE RED SEA
[1:33:09] and you just thought that you were just
[1:33:11] YOU WERE JUST READING JERICHO. BUT YET
[1:33:14] GOD WAS MAPPING OUT THE PLAN OF
[1:33:17] REDEMPTION, AMEN, TO HIS PEOPLE. GOD WAS
[1:33:20] MAPPING OUT, AMEN, THIS PLAN. AND IN
[1:33:23] JUST AS I had PREDESTINATED ISRAEL TO GO
[1:33:27] into a land of promise that I had I had
[1:33:29] given to THEM BY NAME BEFORE that they
[1:33:32] had even got there that their attributes
[1:33:34] that their characteristic is proof.
[1:33:37] Amen. That you come into this land of
[1:33:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost AND THAT
[1:33:41] YOU'VE RESTED FULLY.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Rested fully. YOU CAN WALK INTO your
[1:33:47] situation.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN WALK RIGHT IN AND
[1:33:50] YOU NO MATTER WHAT THE doctor says, you
[1:33:51] can walk right INTO THERE. AMEN. THE
[1:33:53] DOCTOR IS infringing on your promise.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Infringing. Yeah.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; He's squatting.
[1:34:05] Yeah. Back in the world, you had no
[1:34:08] inheritance. You were you were squatting
[1:34:11] on the devil's land. You were a child of
[1:34:14] God squatting on the devil's land out
[1:34:15] there in the wilderness. Amen. But
[1:34:18] underneath this rest,
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; underneath this seal of the baptism of
[1:34:22] the Holy Ghost, amen, that you've come
[1:34:24] underneath a full rest has been granted,
[1:34:26] amen, to you. And now you're walking out
[1:34:29] into your promised land. Amen. You don't
[1:34:31] have to no longer you don't have to no
[1:34:33] longer wonder, oh, I'm going to possess
[1:34:35] this, but I can't keep it. No, you can
[1:34:38] possess the land of your children
[1:34:40] because that's your inheritance. And if
[1:34:42] you have enough faith, amen, to believe
[1:34:44] for your own salvation, then you should
[1:34:46] be able to believe the salvation for
[1:34:47] YOUR CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO COME. And
[1:34:50] you can't. Does it matter what Jericho?
[1:34:52] Doesn't matter what AI doesn't matter,
[1:34:54] Amen. any of the monsters or any of the
[1:34:57] armies, amen, that have COME AGAINST
[1:34:58] YOU. GOD [screaming] HAS BEEN THE ONE
[1:35:00] THAT SAID THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU THE LAND.
[1:35:03] IT'S NOT up to you. It's not up to YOU
[1:35:05] TO SURRENDER. GOD GAVE YOU THE LAND. NOW
[1:35:07] YOU GO AND POSSESS IT. AMEN. BECAUSE
[1:35:09] YOU'RE BONE OF HIS BLOW AND YOUR FLESH
[1:35:12] OF HIS FLESH.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; As our musicians come,
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; it says, "According as he has chosen us
[1:35:25] in him before the foundation
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; of the world."
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; See the parallel there?
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; You see what's going on?
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; I I did this before. That was all
[1:35:37] around.
[1:35:39] I'm the originator of that. They stole
[1:35:41] They stole that from me.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; According chosen us in him before the
[1:35:48] foundation of the world, that we should
[1:35:50] be holy without him without blame before
[1:35:55] him in love. You see the parallel there?
[1:35:58] You see where God brought Israel into a
[1:36:01] land that was already theirs and God has
[1:36:05] already given you the victory before the
[1:36:08] foundation of the world. He had already
[1:36:11] seen you sealed. He had already seen you
[1:36:15] positionally placed in YOUR LAND OF
[1:36:18] PROMISE FOR TODAY.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Now it's up to you to believe this
[1:36:25] ministry.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Now it's up to you to believe this
[1:36:29] Joshua ministry. You think the burden is
[1:36:31] just off of is off of you because Israel
[1:36:34] tanked it.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; No. Now it's on you.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; God's like, I've done all these things.
[1:36:43] I've raised a young man. I've raised a
[1:36:45] young boy back from the dead in Finland.

[1:37:01] congregation out of sickness, from a
[1:37:04] hyper thyroid. I brought I brought I

[1:37:38] We're not talking about a people that
[1:37:39] are beyond the that are on the other
[1:37:41] side of Jordan. We're not talking about
[1:37:43] a people that are just laying in
[1:37:45] justification and in sanctification.
[1:37:47] We're talking about a people that have
[1:37:48] already crossed over and are coming to a
[1:37:52] place that they they're realizing who
[1:37:53] they are and they're realizing that you
[1:37:57] know what I have a purpose in life
[1:38:02] and that's to exhibit
[1:38:04] a living God
[1:38:07] just as Israel did. Look at him. Look at
[1:38:10] every time that Israel went and did and
[1:38:11] went and did something. He says that so
[1:38:13] my glory would be made known. All
[1:38:16] right. All right.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; So that all the world will know that I
[1:38:21] am God.
[1:38:23] You think that God's exhibiting himself
[1:38:25] through you for your glorification? No.
[1:38:29] But he's chosen a willing vessel
[1:38:32] for today. If it's willing,
[1:38:35] if that vessel's willing
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; to possess the land.
[1:38:44] Are you willing to possess the land?
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:38:56] I've reached too [music] far. That's way
[1:38:57] I can I can preach this.

[1:39:15] a loved one. God's put that desire in
[1:39:16] your heart that you can overcome the
[1:39:18] infirmity in your body. God put this
[1:39:20] desire in your heart, amen, for for your
[1:39:23] financial need or for a brother or for a
[1:39:25] sister. He put those things in your
[1:39:26] heart because he knows that you can
[1:39:28] overcome him and that you're the only
[1:39:31] hands he's going to be able to use.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Surely he can come down in the [music]
[1:39:36] spirit. Surely he can come down in
[1:39:38] manifestations. Surely he could come
[1:39:41] down by AN ANGEL. BUT WHY WOULD HE DO
[1:39:42] THAT WHEN HE COULD USE YOU?
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; YEAH.

[1:40:06] men that we that that have went on
[1:40:07] before us. The same God that was with
[1:40:09] them stands right here, right now. Then
[1:40:12] it will stand with every son and
[1:40:14] daughter of God that be willing.
[1:40:17] But they've got to be willing.
[1:40:19] They got to be ABLE TO SAY, "LORD, I
[1:40:21] NEED TO HEAR YOUR WORD OR I'LL DIE. GOD,
[1:40:24] I NEED TO BE ABLE TO COME INTO YOUR

[1:40:29] FELLOWSHIP WITH YOUR BELIEVERS OR OR I
[1:40:31] WILL CEASE TO LIVE. LORD, I NEED YOUR

[1:41:30] loss inside the promised land was when
[1:41:31] sin was in [music] the camp and Achen
[1:41:34] had to pay for his sin.

[1:43:13] be able to say that I'm more than able
[1:43:15] to take the mountain. No matter what the
[1:43:18] situation is looking like IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:43:20] IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOUR kids are going

[2:05:04] It's all already done,
[2:05:12] buddy.
[2:05:15] That was a message.
[2:05:20] [applause and music]
[2:05:22] Wow.
[2:05:26] And [music] we just say, "Amen."
[2:05:29] God's call. Let's get your act together.
[2:05:31] [music]
[2:05:33] take your pampers off and
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; become men and women
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; and be who we are.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; I I was telling somebody today, it's
[2:05:47] it's time for elders to be elders.
[2:05:50] Time for elders [music] to be elders and
[2:05:53] be an example.
[2:05:55] If you want respect, [music]
[2:05:57] then be worthy of it.
[2:06:00] just be [music] worthy of it. And if
[2:06:03] you're not worthy of it, well, you know,
[2:06:07] you just ain't [music] you just ain't
[2:06:09] going to get it.
[2:06:11] Yep. You you you'll be all wrinkled and
[2:06:13] gray and with zero respect [music]
[2:06:21] because you have not [music] shown what
[2:06:24] it is
[2:06:26] to take your position [music] as a man,
[2:06:30] as an elder woman, and come in line with
[2:06:33] that word
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; and show it to the to the younger
[2:06:37] generation.
[2:06:39] But I'm here to tell you, [music] I
[2:06:41] mean, you know, I there Joshua 5, I I
[2:06:46] was I [music] was looking um you know,
[2:06:49] at at the scripture that um that brother
[2:06:52] Brandham quoted on the new corn, the new
[2:06:55] corn, and you know, the it says [music]
[2:06:58] when they when they came over, you know,
[2:07:00] Joshua 5 is talking about the you know,
[2:07:03] that that [music] they just wanted they
[2:07:05] just said, "All right, you know, we're
[2:07:07] just going to let the we're just going
[2:07:08] to let those older ones just have
[2:07:09] church. Let them come. Let them do their
[2:07:11] thing. Let them go through their rel.
[2:07:12] They're They're just [music] going to
[2:07:13] let them die off. All right. They're
[2:07:15] just going to go. They're just playing
[2:07:16] anyways. Let them die off.
[2:07:20] But then when that next generation came
[2:07:22] up,
[2:07:24] they're in Joshua 5. They did not
[2:07:26] [music] They weren't circumcised.
[2:07:29] And so it they required them to be
[2:07:31] circumcised. Circumcision represents,
[2:07:34] you know, the Holy Ghost. [music] The
[2:07:36] new land represents that that promised
[2:07:39] land, Holy Ghost word living in us,
[2:07:41] right?
[2:07:44] And after they had sanctified [music]
[2:07:46] their hearts, they were over in the new
[2:07:48] land, they were they they were uh they
[2:07:52] they all were circumcised.
[2:07:57] And the Bible says that they begin to
[2:08:00] eat
[2:08:02] um you know it it it says [music] there
[2:08:04] in in Joshua
[2:08:06] 5 and and um well it's not giving
[2:08:09] [music] me the the the verse there but
[2:08:12] it says they were uncircumcised because
[2:08:14] they had not been circumcised by them by
[2:08:17] the way. And it came [music] to pass uh
[2:08:19] they had done circumcised all the people
[2:08:22] they abode in their places till they
[2:08:23] were whole. And the Lord said unto
[2:08:26] Joshua, Joshua, this day have I rode
[2:08:30] away the reproach of Egypt from off you.
[2:08:34] [music]
[2:08:34] Wherefore the name of the place is
[2:08:36] called Gilgal, unto this day, and the
[2:08:37] children of Israel encamped in Gilgal,
[2:08:40] kept the Passover on the 14th day of the
[2:08:42] month, at even in the plain of Jericho.
[2:08:45] And [music] they did eat of the corn of
[2:08:48] the land on the marorrow after the
[2:08:52] Passover, unleavened [music] cakes and
[2:08:54] parched corn in the selfsame day. And
[2:08:57] the mana ceased on the marorrow after
[2:09:01] they had eaten of the old corn of the
[2:09:03] land. And neither had the children
[2:09:06] [music] of Israel mana anymore, but they
[2:09:08] did eat the fruit of the land of Canaan
[2:09:11] that year.
[2:09:14] They they they they had to they had to
[2:09:17] cross Jordan. They had to surrender and
[2:09:20] die to their stinking natures. [music]
[2:09:22] They had to do that in order to come
[2:09:24] over to that promised land. God
[2:09:26] circumcised their hearts and the Bible
[2:09:29] [music] says that all the reproach was
[2:09:32] all born away. Well, praise the Lord.
[2:09:35] How many wants to be an example of
[2:09:36] [music] faith? I want to be an example
[2:09:39] of faith. I want to be an example of
[2:09:42] faith. [music]
[2:09:43] Hallelujah. And and so he you know the
[2:09:46] the the the [music] uh uh when brother
[2:09:49] Brandon would talk about the children of
[2:09:50] Israel going he says he said all it was
[2:09:52] was murmuring complaining and and
[2:09:55] [music] it was just it was just a
[2:09:57] constant uh it was just a feuding a
[2:10:00] feuding among them just just every
[2:10:03] little bit. Moses was constantly having
[2:10:05] to having to fix things just constantly.
[2:10:08] It was just, he says, but when they came
[2:10:10] over into the other land, there's no
[2:10:12] more feuding. They were in their land.
[2:10:15] They were possessing their promises.
[2:10:17] They were taking Amen. And and and I I
[2:10:21] just I just decided I want to be that
[2:10:23] kind of a person. I want to possess my
[2:10:27] land. Can you say amen?
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Did you enjoy that message tonight?
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. [applause and music]
[2:10:37] Hallelujah.
[2:10:40] Now remember Moses represented the law.
[2:10:44] Joshua represented grace.
[2:10:48] The law Moses under the law under under
[2:10:51] that it was it [music] was it was just
[2:10:54] just just constant
[2:10:56] uh uh
[2:11:00] uh you know just constantly having to
[2:11:02] get them to to believe God. constantly
[2:11:04] having to they were just constantly
[2:11:06] discouraged just constantly. But when
[2:11:08] they got over to Joshua, I love the way
[2:11:10] you brought that out. It wasn't someone
[2:11:12] having to hold Moses hands up. [music]
[2:11:14] Now it was a Joshua leading the crew
[2:11:16] saying charge. Amen. Why? They [music]
[2:11:19] didn't belong. It was the permissive
[2:11:22] will of God in the wilderness. It's
[2:11:24] [music] the perfect will of God in the
[2:11:26] land. And when you're in this pro, what
[2:11:29] what what land is it? It's this. The
[2:11:32] Holy Spirit has [music] opened up the
[2:11:34] book to you.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Now we can possess it, brother. Charge.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Charge. Go forward in the name of the
[2:11:44] Lord.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I I just Man, I just love it
[2:11:48] tonight. Amen. There's no possessing in
[2:11:51] the wilderness.
[2:11:53] Possessing.
[2:11:56] when we get through with all of our
[2:11:57] little pet peeves and all of this that
[2:11:59] [music] and the other and just come to
[2:12:01] God's word and look in the mirror and
[2:12:03] say, "I'm going to possess
[2:12:05] everything God said I can have." Well,
[2:12:08] can I hear an amen?
[2:12:11] So, [music] so we want to do that. We
[2:12:13] want we want to I started out saying us
[2:12:15] elders, we want to, [music]
[2:12:17] you know, um uh us elders want to be
[2:12:21] that kind of an example. We want to be
[2:12:22] that example. And actually, I was
[2:12:24] talking to somebody about that today.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; We want to be an example. Amen. Uh
[2:12:31] [music] be an example. Hallelujah.
[2:12:34] And uh and if we'll do that, God will
[2:12:37] bless and [music] he'll bless that next
[2:12:40] generation.
[2:12:42] Hallelujah.
[2:12:43] Amen.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Well, there's there's there's there's
[2:12:48] too many. We got we, you know, we just
[2:12:50] we, you know, setting setting [music]
[2:12:51] the message for you and we're just going
[2:12:53] to we're just going to keep all the old
[2:12:55] family tradition [music] that that bound
[2:12:57] daddy that's bound to you and you going
[2:12:58] to let it bind your sons and and and if
[2:13:01] he's got your attitude, he's going to
[2:13:02] bind he'll he'll let it bind his sons.
[2:13:05] Well, you know, somebody's got to stand
[2:13:08] up and say enough's enough. And my
[2:13:10] family has suffered enough because of
[2:13:13] me. And I I and and and [laughter]
[2:13:16] my church has suffered enough because of
[2:13:18] [music] me. And the young people have
[2:13:20] suffered enough because of me. I'm going
[2:13:22] to stand up and I'm going to be
[2:13:25] accounted for among the faithful
[2:13:28] believers. I'm going to believe what God
[2:13:31] has promised. Amen.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; You you you young ones that's got young
[2:13:35] people in your in your in your uh
[2:13:37] [music] uh families now, your young
[2:13:40] children, you mark my words. Amen. There
[2:13:44] are there are curses that are being
[2:13:46] passed down through your [music]
[2:13:48] genetics. And somebody's got to stand up
[2:13:50] against the tide and show them that
[2:13:52] somebody can overcome. Yeah. Well,
[2:13:55] praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:13:58] [applause]
[2:14:00] you know, depression and and and
[2:14:02] bitterness was something in my family
[2:14:04] [music] and u I seen it I seen it in
[2:14:06] grandpa. I've seen it in my my dad's,
[2:14:09] you know, my dad's family and and uh
[2:14:12] [music] but dad told me when I was a
[2:14:14] kid, he told me, he said, "Now, you're
[2:14:15] going to fight it because well, [music]
[2:14:16] you're a Martin. You're going to fight
[2:14:18] bitterness." And uh but he's going to
[2:14:21] say, "By God's grace," he said,
[2:14:22] "Wendall, I have [music] I have put I
[2:14:25] have stood right there and stood guard."
[2:14:28] And it would be easy for me to get
[2:14:30] bitty. Really easy. It's in my genetics.
[2:14:33] [music] He said, "But I'm telling you,
[2:14:36] by God's grace, he has helped me. And if
[2:14:38] I can, [music]
[2:14:39] by his grace, I'm going to I I I'm going
[2:14:42] to I'm going to die a man that [music]
[2:14:44] is not like uh my father." And he loved
[2:14:47] his father, and I loved my grandfather,
[2:14:49] but he says he died a bitter man. And he
[2:14:52] said, "Wendo, you're going to have to
[2:14:53] make up your mind." I appreciate that.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; I appreciate dad for taking me and
[2:14:58] saying, "Hey, there's some things in our
[2:15:00] family that wasn't quite that wasn't
[2:15:02] quite right." And and [music] and I want
[2:15:04] you to I want you to put the Holy Ghost
[2:15:06] on that. Put the Holy Ghost on that so
[2:15:08] that you can overcome. Amen. Well, and
[2:15:10] I'm Aren't you glad that my dad is not a
[2:15:13] bitter old man that's all hateful and
[2:15:16] today he's a kind man, loving man. He's
[2:15:21] He's just He sees good in everybody.
[2:15:23] Well, I'm glad for that. I I'm glad for
[2:15:27] that. Amen. Now it's my turn. Amen. I'm
[2:15:31] still of the genetics, but the Holy
[2:15:32] Ghost is in me that is going to help me
[2:15:35] to overcome it.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I you know, when I heard
[2:15:39] what what got me going on that is when
[2:15:41] brother Michael said, "Hey, uh you know,
[2:15:43] all of those 20 years and over will not
[2:15:46] make the promise." [music] And I go,
[2:15:47] "Ouch,
[2:15:49] ouch, ouch, ouch." I don't guess I'd
[2:15:52] ever read that. [music] and uh uh or I
[2:15:55] forgot about it or something and I
[2:15:57] thought, man, man,
[2:16:00] some grandpa had influenced a daddy and
[2:16:03] some daddy [music] had influenced a 20
[2:16:05] year old
[2:16:07] and they had a bad attitude at that
[2:16:09] promised land and God says, "You ain't
[2:16:11] going [music] in neither." Ay.
[2:16:16] So, it's really [music] serious.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; It is serious. So anyways,
[2:16:21] uh, had to add my two [music] cents to
[2:16:23] your message. Amen. Praise the Lord. So
[2:16:26] I'm I'm I'm glad for that. But I will
[2:16:28] tell you I I will tell you that another
[2:16:31] good another good quote in the promised
[2:16:34] land. Brother Brandham says the new
[2:16:36] birth breeds [music] out the call.
[2:16:40] The new birth, he's he's talking about
[2:16:43] your nature. He says, [music] and and
[2:16:45] your genetics. He's talking about
[2:16:47] genetics, but he says the new birth
[2:16:49] breeds out the call. What what that's
[2:16:52] what that [music] means is, Amen. the
[2:16:54] Holy Ghost can come in and take over
[2:16:56] things in our lives. Amen. We can come
[2:16:59] over in our [music] promised land and
[2:17:00] possess our land.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Someone shout hallelujah.
[2:17:07] [applause]
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; So, I'm thankful for it. I I'm thankful
[2:17:12] for it. I I I and and really I think
[2:17:14] [music] the message went right along
[2:17:16] with mine this morning. Amen. Humanity
[2:17:19] and deity. God has come over. Somebody's
[2:17:21] got to look at themselves this year in a
[2:17:24] different light. I am an overcomer. That
[2:17:27] word is mine. And by George, I'm taking
[2:17:29] my mountain.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm coming over on this other
[2:17:32] side. I ain't going to question it. I'm
[2:17:34] going to believe it.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go forward." [music] Amen.
[2:17:37] God bless you. And um we we certainly
[2:17:41] appreciate the word of the Lord. [music]
