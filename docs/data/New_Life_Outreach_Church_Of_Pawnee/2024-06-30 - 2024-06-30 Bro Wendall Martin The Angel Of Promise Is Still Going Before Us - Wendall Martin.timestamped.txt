[48:58] he will never

[49:05] promises are true they're just as true
[49:08] today as they were the day that he gave
[49:10] the
[49:12] promise you can trust him you can rely
[49:16] upon
[49:17] him and I say this morning that the
[49:19] great one is among
[49:21] us if you could give me a little more
[49:23] monitors amen
[49:27] I know the enemy of our souls wants to
[49:29] see
[49:30] everyone discouraged and everyone
[49:33] sitting down with our hearts hanging on
[49:35] the willow
[49:37] trees but I say tonight or this morning
[49:41] he that has begun the good work will be
[49:44] faithful to complete that work this
[49:49] morning I believe God answers prayer I
[49:52] believe God hears every
[49:54] prayer that you pray
[49:57] right there's not one prayer that goes
[49:59] unnoticed there is not one there's not
[50:02] one minute detail of your life that God
[50:05] does not know
[50:07] about that's right he's not answering
[50:10] today there's a
[50:13] reason many of
[50:15] times the reason is is Satan is trying
[50:18] to battle you
[50:20] and mind to cover your mind up and
[50:24] hinder your faith from accepting
[50:27] but I say today we've got to believe
[50:29] God's word and accept God's word
[50:31] regardless of how we feel regardless of
[50:34] what the devil is saying to you
[50:37] regardless amen how the situation looks
[50:41] oblique God is very mindful of you here
[50:44] this morning and I believe
[50:49] that and I know I know he's here today
[50:55] [Music]
[50:57] as we go to the Lord in prayer before we
[50:59] Minister the word this morning I want
[51:01] you to just take your
[51:03] need and I want you to just lift it
[51:06] before the Lord and say Lord I'm you
[51:09] still

[51:14] work and I I need your

[51:41] path for us to come before

[51:55] wonderful way
[51:58] Lord I'm asking father that your word as
[52:00] it is going forth that it would be
[52:03] unhindered

[52:29] need in the name of the Lord
[52:32] Jesus ask Lord that you would anoint us
[52:35] to minister your word and that the word
[52:38] would come rich and real to every
[52:41] heart and we'll give you glory and honor
[52:44] in Jesus name we

[53:51] chapter
[53:54] amen and we're going to read there at
[53:56] the sixth
[54:00] verse being confident of this very
[54:04] thing that he which hath begun a good
[54:08] work in you will perform it unto the day
[54:15] of Jesus
[54:16] Christ now that that is a problem the
[54:19] the angel of the Lord is to take us Amen
[54:24] to the place that he has prepared
[54:26] what is that place amen there in in
[54:29] Revelations 21 and and one I saw a new
[54:33] heavens and a new Earth amen for the
[54:36] first Heaven and the first Earth were
[54:39] passed away and there was no more sea
[54:41] and I saw that Holy City descending out
[54:44] from Heaven that is a promise and that's
[54:48] what God is taking you to God bless you
[54:50] you can have your seats here this
[54:53] morning
[54:54] amen I want to Minister the angel of
[54:59] Promise is still going before
[55:02] us amen the angel of Promise the one who
[55:06] made the promise now today we see the
[55:11] the world in in in great
[55:13] turmoil and we realize that we need
[55:16] something to Anchor the heart amen
[55:19] there's a lot of emotions that are
[55:22] swirling around and amen constantly
[55:27] we we the of course right now we got the
[55:30] presidential amen
[55:33] uh uh you know things that are that are
[55:35] uh you know the the uh election coming
[55:38] up and amen and and um the world is is
[55:42] is looking at this and wondering and
[55:44] you've got amen um uh According to some
[55:48] that this is the world's greatest
[55:49] economy that we've ever had and um uh
[55:53] you know they were talking about all the
[55:55] lies that Trump told the other night and
[55:57] I thought is anybody looking at a few of
[55:58] them on the other side and
[56:02] amen but you and I are supposed to
[56:04] believe that this is uh amen that we're
[56:07] in a Utopia here today but I I want to
[56:10] say that we are amen that that this life
[56:13] is is is is pretty am man the our
[56:18] nations are are are are crumbling
[56:21] kingdoms are falling amen and and and
[56:25] and the reason it is is because it is
[56:27] built upon Humanity amen and anything
[56:30] about Humanity cannot last there is no
[56:35] continuing City here there's nothing
[56:38] that is continuing here on the Earth the
[56:40] only hope that we have is in the Lord
[56:43] Jesus Christ and I say here this morning
[56:46] that you amen are just as fickle as they
[56:49] are amen except for the grace of God
[56:53] Amen there is an anchor in your life
[56:56] that brings about a a stability amen
[57:00] that keeps you but you are fickle there
[57:03] is nothing about you that is any better
[57:05] than any other human being amen except
[57:08] for the grace of God can you say Amen
[57:12] brother Brandon would say man in his
[57:14] nature is a Castaway he is an alien he's
[57:17] away from God then God by Grace has to
[57:22] draw him to his side and all that the
[57:25] father has given given me will come to
[57:27] me no way at all amen uh there ain't
[57:32] enough picture shows enough D Halls
[57:34] enough bersu shows in the in the country
[57:39] to keep you away from God Amen he says
[57:42] when God goes to drawing and back Yonder
[57:45] before the foundation of the world when
[57:48] he put your name down that you would
[57:50] come he says you're coming and that's
[57:53] all that's all amen so the only
[57:56] difference between you and between amen
[57:59] your neighbor down the road or between
[58:01] the amen is that God is calling you and
[58:04] God has got his grace upon you in in
[58:07] this time of turmoil that we can see and
[58:10] I want to say that in this time of
[58:11] turmoil amen we've got to keep our eyes
[58:15] upon the creator that created You In His
[58:18] Image because remember as I read the
[58:21] quote to you a couple weeks ago where
[58:23] brother bradam says listen to thus
[58:25] sayith the Lord if you consider me to be
[58:27] a prophet his servant just before the
[58:30] break of day or he says uh if you
[58:33] consider me to be a servant it's just
[58:35] before the break of day somebody look to
[58:37] your neighbor and tell them it's just
[58:39] before the break of day and that's why
[58:43] this horrible Gloom is over the Earth
[58:47] it's just before the coming of the Lord
[58:49] Jesus there's no more hope left in
[58:52] nothing but his coming nations are
[58:54] against Nations they have fooled with
[58:56] God's laboratory until they've got the
[58:59] power to blow uh one another into Atomic
[59:02] ashes they're Wicked they're unreligious
[59:05] they're un Christlike and the only
[59:08] motive they have an objective is to
[59:10] destroy you are inspired they they are
[59:14] inspired by the destroying angel that
[59:16] was sent from heaven to inspire these
[59:18] men let me say this in the name of the
[59:21] Lord Jesus the holy spirit is sent as a
[59:23] Watchman on the Tower and the people cry
[59:26] what of the night are you weary of this
[59:29] life are you weary of sin are you weary
[59:32] of funeral processions and sickness and
[59:34] ungodliness on every hand has the night
[59:36] been long and weary what of the night
[59:39] Watchmen he said the morning cometh see
[59:43] the Comfort the morning cometh see the
[59:47] Comfort amen the angel of the Lord is

[59:52] glad that the angel of the Lord is
[59:53] leading us through all amen the Maze of
[59:57] of Darkness that we have found ourselves
[59:59] in and aren't you glad that the promise
[1:00:01] is still just as good today as the as it
[1:00:05] was when God said it amen no matter the
[1:00:08] rebellion and no matter the Wilderness
[1:00:10] experience no matter the all of the
[1:00:12] unbelief in the children of Israel there
[1:00:14] was still a promise and there was still
[1:00:16] an angel that was going to take them to
[1:00:18] that promise amen now the unbeliever
[1:00:23] couldn't make it but the unbeliever
[1:00:25] cannot keep the believer from believing
[1:00:28] sin cannot keep the UN amen The Believer
[1:00:31] from believing there is nothing that can
[1:00:34] keep you out of the promises of God
[1:00:36] because they are yes and amen they are
[1:00:39] not yes and no amen it's not if and
[1:00:42] maybe God has called you placed your
[1:00:45] name on his book and he said your name
[1:00:48] is written in that land can you say amen
[1:00:51] amen it's just as good God knew that
[1:00:53] this day was coming amen God said in in
[1:00:56] Luke 21 and 25 there shall be signs in
[1:00:59] the Sun and in the moon and in the stars
[1:01:02] and upon the Earth distress of nations
[1:01:04] with perplexity and the Seas and the
[1:01:07] waves are roaring and men's heart
[1:01:09] failing for fear for for the looking
[1:01:11] after those things which are coming on
[1:01:13] the earth for the powers of Heaven shall
[1:01:15] be shaken and then they shall see the
[1:01:17] son of man coming in a cloud with the
[1:01:20] power of great glory and when you see
[1:01:25] these things amen are are you hearing me
[1:01:28] have we seen amen signs in the heavens

[1:01:33] moon and the signs and the scars haven't
[1:01:35] we been hearing this on the news for the

[1:01:49] or it is the son of man but it's not the
[1:01:51] body of God but he came in the power of

[1:27:51] y'all say amen amen but when he went on
[1:27:53] to the other side into the promised land

[1:27:59] spirit amen giving the power to the
[1:28:02] church to overcome it does not mean
[1:28:05] Heaven it does not mean that amen

[1:38:10] however long it's been since the prophet

[1:38:23] message is not just a little formal
[1:38:26] Feelgood amen I belong to the message

[1:38:38] Elisha the same God that anointed him
[1:38:42] has anointed you why because you believe
[1:38:47] his

[1:39:35] build houses and they will inhabit
[1:39:38] them they'll plant Vineyards and eat the

[1:40:05] innocence there'll be nothing
[1:40:08] there be nothing could hurt we'll be
[1:40:11] changed from what we are now to that
[1:40:14] glorious image of the Son of God which
[1:40:16] is Immortal years can never touch him
[1:40:20] age can never do anything to him he's
[1:40:23] the immortal Son of
[1:40:25] God and we know that we're at the end
[1:40:29] time we're at the junction all these
[1:40:31] things fairly thoroughly
[1:40:34] identified and so will it be identified
[1:40:42] again when God
[1:40:45] said I want to send Elijah the
[1:40:49] prophet When God says that he would come
[1:40:51] with healing in his wings
[1:40:54] when he raised that Prophet up it was a
[1:40:57] Vindication to God's word it was the
[1:40:59] light on God's word it was God's word
[1:41:02] God God identifying himself and raising
[1:41:06] up that man and the prophet is saying as
[1:41:09] he has identified it there so will it be
[1:41:12] identified
[1:41:14] again the
[1:41:17] manifestation now I I you know it breaks
[1:41:20] all tops Elisha NE Elijah never did
[1:41:22] raise from the dead to come back and
[1:41:24] preach
[1:41:25] again that's i i i i if if you're
[1:41:27] looking for Elijah to return uh to to to
[1:41:30] raise from the dead you know I I I I
[1:41:33] just I you know he's going to raise in
[1:41:35] the general Resurrection like the rest
[1:41:37] of us amen but this worship of of
[1:41:40] brother brandom that he's got to rise up
[1:41:42] and finish his ministry I'm going to
[1:41:43] tell you something the seventh angel has
[1:41:47] completed the mystery of God you've got
[1:41:50] to believe what he said amen there ain't
[1:41:54] nothing future you've got to believe now
[1:41:57] it takes the elishah to pick up that
[1:42:00] mantle Keep Your Eyes Upon that word
[1:42:04] amen can you say
[1:42:06] amen
[1:42:09] amen the
[1:42:11] promises the promises then for an Elijah
[1:42:15] to come and to turn your hearts
[1:42:18] back and here we
[1:42:21] are we've turned our eyes back what are
[1:42:23] we looking at this
[1:42:25] morning if the scripture says he shall
[1:42:28] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:42:30] the
[1:42:31] fathers and he said it over and over
[1:42:34] again turn it back to the
[1:42:37] fathers then what are we to be looking
[1:42:41] at in this dark day before the Rapture
[1:42:45] of the
[1:42:47] church we are to keep our eyes upon the
[1:42:52] fathers
[1:42:57] we're to keep our eyes on the word of
[1:43:03] God and he that's promised the
[1:43:06] Millennium is going to fulfill it just
[1:43:08] like he raised up a prophet there is a
[1:43:10] bride here on the earth that is fixing
[1:43:12] to see a
[1:43:13] Rapture just as he
[1:43:16] promised that there would be no sickness
[1:43:18] and there would be no pain and there
[1:43:19] would be no more heart trouble and there
[1:43:20] would be no more Hallelujah

[1:46:38] deal I don't
[1:46:41] know but until
[1:46:44] then I'm not looking at this one or that
[1:46:47] one I'm looking at a Divine promise I'm
[1:46:49] holding a book and I'm fighting those
[1:46:52] Devils off that will keep me from the
[1:46:55] eternal
[1:46:56] life can you see am man do you love

[1:47:07] us well glory to
[1:47:09] God Amen I'm so
[1:47:13] glad
[1:47:16] now brother brandham would say Jacob as
[1:47:19] a Wanderer yet in the promise
[1:47:22] he said he ran for his
[1:47:24] life well he would have he says he
[1:47:27] wouldn't have got killed anyhow for God
[1:47:30] was with
[1:47:31] him then one day after tired and running
[1:47:35] through the
[1:47:37] Wilderness looking back to see if Esau
[1:47:40] was coming and you know and scared and
[1:47:42] nervous and wondered if he could hear
[1:47:45] the gallop the horse hoof somewhere
[1:47:48] Esau Jacob probably with his little
[1:47:50] spear to keep the animals off of him run
[1:47:52] as hard as he could and his little old
[1:47:54] ragged coat kept tearing through the
[1:47:56] Wilderness and climbed up on a big old
[1:47:58] high hill so he could look way off and
[1:48:01] see if he had seen Esau coming
[1:48:04] anywhere in the evening sun going down
[1:48:07] the poor little fell was tired and he
[1:48:11] just rode some rocks together and laid
[1:48:14] down for a rest I just want to tell you
[1:48:16] sometimes it's good to just go find us a
[1:48:19] little place and
[1:48:21] rest now stick with me a little bit
[1:48:23] longer I'm not going to hold you too
[1:48:24] much too much more time
[1:48:27] but he he he
[1:48:31] he he run and he was running and he was
[1:48:34] running for his life and
[1:48:36] then he laid down
[1:48:40] and he said he rode some Stones together
[1:48:44] and laid them for a a rest and he fell
[1:48:46] into a trance and it was God talking to
[1:48:48] a
[1:48:49] servant because in his servant not
[1:48:51] because he was right but because God had
[1:48:53] made a
[1:48:55] promise
[1:48:57] amen look the way Jacob got
[1:49:01] it but God had a promise and had to keep
[1:49:04] it in the loins of Jacob laid the
[1:49:07] blessings and the rest and the righteous
[1:49:09] seed coming forth from there according
[1:49:12] to the seed of Isaac his father which
[1:49:14] had been promised through Abraham and in
[1:49:17] L in Jacob's loins was the seed laying
[1:49:19] there whether it come out many centuries
[1:49:22] Generations on but there was the
[1:49:26] promise God took Jacob and showed him
[1:49:29] some of the future and know he was an
[1:49:31] heir of the promise not because he
[1:49:33] deserved it someone say hallelujah
[1:49:36] hallelujah but because God had promised
[1:49:39] it not because you got a right not
[1:49:42] because that's something you've done but
[1:49:44] because God gave you the same kind of
[1:49:47] promise when we are dead in Christ and
[1:49:50] take on Abraham's seed are we are heirs
[1:49:52] with Abraham in the
[1:49:54] promise now the only way you can be an
[1:49:56] heir is to be dead to yourself take on
[1:49:58] the Seed of Abraham which was
[1:50:00] Christ and Christ can only come by the
[1:50:03] Holy Ghost that's right then you're an
[1:50:06] heir of the same promise Pilgrim listen
[1:50:09] at it a pilgrim stranger seeking a city
[1:50:11] to come who Builder and maker so Journey
[1:50:14] wandering about there you are Pilgrim
[1:50:17] but a faith that looks steadfast Through
[1:50:19] The Dark Skies the Cloudy weather and
[1:50:22] he's beyond that God and God in his
[1:50:25] great domain Dominion
[1:50:27] above little old Steven was dying and
[1:50:30] Jesus had been glorified sitting up
[1:50:32] there up there at the right hand of the
[1:50:35] majesty and they began to beat him with
[1:50:37] stones and his head was mashed in with
[1:50:39] the stones and Steven looked steadfast
[1:50:41] toward the heavens Jesus after he had
[1:50:44] finished his work had sat down on the
[1:50:45] right hand but Stephen when he saw
[1:50:47] Heavens open up Jesus was standing at
[1:50:50] the right hand of God I guess the Savior
[1:50:52] must have stood stood up from his throne
[1:50:53] and gave the Martyr a welcome in yes he
[1:50:57] saw the Everlasting Dominion of God
[1:50:58] above God's promis is true look at him
[1:51:02] now we we take Jacob and he lays down
[1:51:05] God shuts him off gives him a coma of a
[1:51:07] vision and he looks up and he sees a
[1:51:09] ladder fastened up in heaven to God's
[1:51:12] throne and reached all the way to the
[1:51:14] Earth and Angels ascending and
[1:51:15] descending on the ladder up and down all
[1:51:18] through the years we found out that this
[1:51:21] was a beautiful promise that God had
[1:51:23] promised a way of escape a ladder to
[1:51:27] climb on a sure Foundation God had
[1:51:30] promised it God was hooked but it was
[1:51:32] hooked into glory and to the throne of
[1:51:34] God but where could he find a place on
[1:51:37] Earth to hook it Hallelujah he can't
[1:51:41] hook it to you he can't hook it to me he
[1:51:44] said he he tried to hook it one time to
[1:51:45] the newest Jewish Nation he found out
[1:51:47] they couldn't do
[1:51:49] it he knew he was going to have to do
[1:51:51] all the time because he had promised the
[1:51:53] seed and the seed was in Jacob then but
[1:51:55] he couldn't hook it on Jacob that's a
[1:51:57] planter neither could he hook it to
[1:51:59] Abraham the little fella sitting out
[1:52:01] there backslid little Shyer lying
[1:52:03] treating his wife the way he was he
[1:52:06] couldn't hook it onto that he couldn't
[1:52:08] hook it on many other things he couldn't
[1:52:10] hook it into the temple Jesus said
[1:52:11] there'll be a time where there won't be
[1:52:13] one stone left on another he tried on
[1:52:16] the patriarch David he took bisha for a
[1:52:19] wife you're right had him killed see
[1:52:22] everything he tried to hook it to it
[1:52:25] wouldn't
[1:52:27] anchor but he says oh

[1:52:32] will be a stone laid in Zion a precious
[1:52:35] stone a tried Stone and that'll be the
[1:52:38] anchor someone shout
[1:52:40] yes a wonderful Stone than God being God
[1:52:44] in heaven with the ladder hooked into
[1:52:46] his own Throne he hooked it also in none
[1:52:48] other but the son of man Jesus Christ
[1:52:50] the Chief Cornerstone
[1:52:52] God won't let this ladder slipping
[1:52:54] around amen he tried to hook it to a
[1:52:57] covenant with Adam he broke it he hooked

[1:55:41] Covenant he made with Adam he tried to
[1:55:43] make the an anchor into him and it
[1:55:45] failed then there's nothing else he
[1:55:47] could hook it to but to bring down his
[1:55:50] own son and hook it to him and now it
[1:55:54] can't

[1:56:57] troubles but remember there's a great
[1:56:58] company of angels all along the road to
[1:57:02] Bear thee up anytime taking you up when

[1:57:15] Amen this
[1:57:18] morning as we come to a close
[1:57:25] the word is for
[1:57:28] sure the angel of God is just as
[1:57:32] powerful as it's ever been no matter
[1:57:35] where you
[1:57:37] are from the time that you gave your
[1:57:39] life to God to the time that you reach
[1:57:41] heaven
[1:57:44] hallelujah it's already been taken care
[1:57:47] of as I told you before we are not in
[1:57:52] Wilderness we're not in Egypt we're not
[1:57:54] in the wilderness we are in the promised
[1:58:00] land we're taking possession of what God
[1:58:05] seen in his mind for
[1:58:08] us now brothers
[1:58:13] sisters you can't be wishy-washy with
[1:58:17] God you can't serve God and then keep
[1:58:20] your own way
[1:58:23] you're going to have to surrender
[1:58:25] everything you've
[1:58:27] got if you want
[1:58:30] Victory what I have found is we had in
[1:58:33] Pentecost we had we didn't have all of
[1:58:36] the word so how could there be full
[1:58:39] justification we could shout and rejoice
[1:58:41] we had great manifestations we seen God
[1:58:43] do wonderful
[1:58:46] things but God wasn't Lord of us
[1:58:52] so when the Miracles were done the
[1:58:55] healings were
[1:58:57] done prophecies were
[1:59:05] given they were just
[1:59:09] finished we would have our highs and go
[1:59:11] down to our real deep lows because we
[1:59:13] were living from emotion to
[1:59:16] emotion but when we made him Lord
[1:59:22] we weren't depending on the preacher
[1:59:24] weren't depending on gifts weren't
[1:59:27] depending on
[1:59:28] emotions didn't matter whether we were
[1:59:30] walking in the Valley of the shadow of
[1:59:32] death we feared no evil
[1:59:35] why because the word has come to Anchor
[1:59:40] us I must surrender everything I am to
[1:59:44] his
[1:59:46] word can you say amen
[1:59:50] amen where where are you where are you
[1:59:52] at

[2:00:00] battle are you wondering if you're going
[2:00:02] to make
[2:00:05] it I say today you're going to make
[2:00:10] it I say you're going to make it because
[2:00:12] he's made it I say you're going to make
[2:00:14] it because the mighty Angel has comeing
[2:00:17] this day the great holy spirit is
[2:00:20] here the very person of the
[2:00:23] word is
[2:00:26] here to meet

[2:00:41] aware

[2:01:08] children he's
[2:01:14] aware he knows where you
[2:01:18] are he knows right where you are
[2:01:29] [Music]
[2:01:33] I'm a guy that believes
[2:01:42] that the message that God brought us
[2:01:44] through the
[2:01:46] seventh Church age
[2:01:49] messenger is very viable
[2:01:55] very real very up toate even for
[2:02:01] today that no matter what you're going
[2:02:03] through I believe that we can find the
[2:02:06] [Music]
[2:02:13] answer some say wow brother things have
[2:02:16] changed a lot since
[2:02:19] the since the prophet has left the
[2:02:23] Earth indeed so indeed
[2:02:28] so but go back and listen to brother
[2:02:30] brandham in these last especially those
[2:02:32] last three four years of his
[2:02:37] ministry and if he didn't tell
[2:02:40] us that we would be right here in this
[2:02:44] condition today if that wasn't a
[2:02:47] prophetic utterance these those last
[2:02:49] three years telling us of what this
[2:02:51] world would look look like
[2:02:53] [Music]
[2:02:56] today he said America would become
[2:03:00] totally
[2:03:02] [Music]
[2:03:06] Lawless Lawless
[2:03:09] brother

[2:03:58] [Music]
[2:04:01] Angel speaking words into his
[2:04:06] Spirit to empower me and you in this day
[2:04:09] that we're living
[2:04:11] in and that Mighty Angel is here the
[2:04:15] same one that anointed
[2:04:17] him to speak is the same one that's
[2:04:19] anointing you to hear to
[2:04:22] receive and to cause
[2:04:25] those Spirit spoken
[2:04:27] words to conceive in our
[2:04:30] [Music]
[2:04:33] hearts all I have to do is quit
[2:04:37] resisting all I have to do is quit
[2:04:40] trying to figure it
