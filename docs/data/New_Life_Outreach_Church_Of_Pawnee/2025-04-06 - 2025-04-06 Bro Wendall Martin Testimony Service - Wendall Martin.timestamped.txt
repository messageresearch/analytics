[21:08] may be
[21:09] seated. Like to open up the floor for
[21:12] testimonies. And Sister Titha, has there
[21:14] been any testimonies on
[21:17] Facebook from from any of the kids at
[21:20] all? Okay. But I'd like to open up the
[21:22] floor especially for our young people.
[21:25] Be nice if we can hear our our young
[21:27] people. Asked Dylan if he had a test a
[21:29] uh a song. He said he didn't have a
[21:31] song, but he did have a notebook full of
[21:33] testimonies from what I hear.
[21:35] No, I'm just kidding. But Lord, bless
[21:37] whoever is going to come up and give
[21:39] their
[21:40] testimony.
[21:46] Amen. Not everybody at once.
[21:50] Amen.
[21:52] Amen. We are opening up the floor for
[21:55] whoever, but we like to hear our youth
[21:57] if we can tonight as well.
[22:01] Amen. All right, brother Luke.
[22:04] You have a testimony tonight.
[22:08] Amen. Put him on the
[22:18] spot. Okay. So, I really enjoyed camp. I
[22:21] had a lot of fun.
[22:24] Uh the Lord definitely uh blessed me and
[22:28] uh definitely got the refilling of the
[22:31] Holy Ghost. But uh when I arrived at
[22:33] camp Thursday night,
[22:36] uh I don't know what happened, but I
[22:38] arrived there and the devil just cast a
[22:40] spirit of depression and sadness on me
[22:44] Thursday night after service and all day
[22:47] Friday, I was having
[22:51] trouble. I could not relate to anybody.
[22:54] I was constantly just wandering off to
[22:56] my dorm wanting to just cry
[23:00] and
[23:02] hide. At lunch, I was hanging out with
[23:04] friends and one of my friends that I
[23:08] trust more than anyone said something
[23:12] very hurtful. Uh after camp, they
[23:15] apologized. But uh later on, I realized
[23:18] I took those words cuz Friday night I
[23:20] got so desperate before the Lord. I went
[23:23] down to the altar and I prayed and
[23:25] prayed and prayed and Friday night the
[23:28] Lord delivered me from that spirit and I
[23:31] was able to enjoy the rest of the camp
[23:33] with my friends and like I said got the
[23:35] refilling of the Holy Ghost.
[23:42] Amen. That's awesome.
[23:45] They are. Yes.
[23:50] [Music]
[23:53] not in a meeting. It's just those those
[23:56] dumb old devils will do that. But you
[23:58] done the right thing. Go to that altar
[24:01] and call out and and ask God for
[24:03] deliverance, man. And so I I like that
[24:06] testimony.
[24:13] I uh got to say I really appreciate the
[24:17] um the atmosphere that was created by
[24:20] everybody for my kids. I I missed it
[24:22] during the prayer line. I usually enjoy
[24:24] seeing my kids go through it, but they
[24:26] were saying that Eric was just sobbing
[24:28] and all all the kids that went through
[24:30] was just crying. So that that means a
[24:33] lot for me as a parent watching my kids
[24:35] get older about to have a a teenager for
[24:37] the kids. So pray for me. But while my
[24:40] kids are soft, it's it's it's amazing
[24:43] how they can there's an atmosphere for
[24:45] them to to go through and and to live
[24:47] in. So thank you from the bottom of my
[24:49] heart for this church, for everything
[24:51] you do for my kids.
[24:53] Amen. Anyone
[24:55] else? Anyone else? All right, I'm g
[24:58] start popping them off. Brother Dylan,
[25:00] you have a testimony
[25:03] tonight. Amen. Say, "Lord, bless Brother
[25:06] Dylan." Amen.
[25:20] Uh well,
[25:24] uh yeah, the meetings were they're
[25:27] great.
[25:28] Um I know that the Saturday night that
[25:31] prayer line uh the anointing was so
[25:34] strong up there was just uh it's really
[25:37] good to go through there and get a touch
[25:40] from the Lord that Saturday night. But
[25:43] um all the all the services were just
[25:45] great and um yeah appreciate the
[25:49] brothers coming down and preaching
[25:50] those. Those are really good services.
[25:52] And yeah.
[25:59] Amen. What can we say about our
[26:01] musicians as well? I thought they
[26:03] thought they did a good
[26:04] job.
[26:07] Amen.
[26:10] Yeah. All
[26:12] right. Brother
[26:15] Jonah, you have a testimony tonight? I
[26:18] know he had work a few
[26:20] Sorry for the hair. I didn't see you
[26:22] walk up. Well, I was saying I wasn't
[26:25] going to do this before, but
[26:28] um well, I'll say that uh everyone knows
[26:33] I just moved out, so I've been
[26:34] struggling, you know, reading. I just
[26:36] been real busy. Haven't been able to
[26:38] focus on the Lord very much. And um so
[26:42] that's what I kind of went for. But, uh,
[26:45] Saturday night, uh, I always went to the
[26:48] prayer lines like, um, I don't know. I
[26:51] kind of looked at it like I don't know,
[26:53] like I don't know. I didn't really look
[26:55] at it very much different than just
[26:57] going to the altar. But then, brother
[26:58] Andrew took it and was like, you're
[27:00] walking through the Red Sea, you know?
[27:02] You got to step through. And I really
[27:04] spoke to me. I was like, wow. And then,
[27:06] uh, after camp, I thought, well, I think
[27:09] I guess that really helped me. And then
[27:11] I started reading. I started breathing
[27:13] with Bella a lot more and uh I just want
[27:15] to thank Lord for that. Yes sir.
[27:29] [Music]
[27:31] Um camp was great. Um, it was also very
[27:37] uh a very weird time for uh for me and
[27:42] my wife. Um, as y'all know, when I
[27:44] posted after camp, um, I found out the
[27:48] Thursday afternoon before we drove over
[27:51] to the camp, um, that I was, uh, no
[27:55] longer going to be employed. And so,
[27:59] um, we got over there and, um,
[28:04] I I started off started off Thursday. My
[28:08] wife didn't know what was going on. Um,
[28:10] she had known there was some different
[28:11] stuff going on at work, but um, I
[28:13] couldn't bring myself to actually tell
[28:16] her what had happened. And so, we went
[28:18] to camp. She didn't know what was going
[28:20] on. Um I
[28:25] uh whether it was the the wisest choice
[28:28] or not um I think it was the choice that
[28:31] was led of the Lord and that I I told
[28:33] her on Friday. Um we were at camp she
[28:37] couldn't back out of going. Um she was
[28:40] there. Um and
[28:44] so but it gave her her a place where
[28:47] then she was able to uh talk to some
[28:50] friends and then we were able to go
[28:53] spend time with brother Wendell and cry
[28:56] and let out a a lot of things that that
[29:00] we were going through. Um and um I don't
[29:06] you know it's one of those where I know
[29:07] we were at a uh a youth camp um but
[29:13] really it felt like there were um
[29:15] particularly points through through
[29:16] really every service where um the
[29:19] ministers were preaching right to me um
[29:22] and right to the situation that that I
[29:25] was dealing with at that moment. Um, and
[29:29] I know that I'm sure in their heads and
[29:32] hearts, they were thinking, I'm I'm
[29:34] preaching to the kids and what they're
[29:35] going with, but there was plenty of
[29:36] times when I was when I was sitting
[29:38] there and they're going, "Hey, you have
[29:40] to be trusting in God. You have to be
[29:42] putting everything into him." And I'm
[29:44] sitting there going, "Yep, I got I got
[29:46] nothing. So, Lord, this is this is all
[29:48] you." Um, and
[29:53] uh, the services were all all wonderful,
[29:56] but I'll say the same thing about about
[29:59] the prayer line. And the prayer line for
[30:00] me was different this year because um,
[30:03] this was the first year where I ever
[30:05] stood right at the entrance of of the
[30:08] prayer line. Um, and Brother Wendell has
[30:11] has mentioned before and talked before
[30:13] about how the angel of the Lord will
[30:16] kind of stand right at the the start of
[30:18] that prayer line and um to be standing
[30:21] there and I'd be watching, you know,
[30:24] there were some people that way down the
[30:26] line they're already crying, but a lot
[30:27] of people they'd be coming up, you know,
[30:29] they were they were serious. They were
[30:30] they were doing their best to enter in.
[30:32] It'd be right here, they're fine. One
[30:36] step forward and suddenly they're
[30:37] balling. they're doing whatever. It's
[30:39] like they haven't even gotten to the
[30:40] point where the ministers are touching
[30:42] them. Right. And I could see I I knew
[30:46] the point because I watched it happen
[30:48] time after time where person would take
[30:50] this one step and suddenly it would just
[30:53] hit them and this and it was it was the
[30:56] barrier like there was no physical line
[30:58] but I could see the change that happened
[31:01] as person after person would step across
[31:05] across the line and step into that
[31:08] presence and um and then just watching
[31:12] and and being right
[31:15] there to see as as as brother Tim and
[31:19] and brother as brother Timothy and
[31:21] brother Andrew would just be grabbing
[31:23] them and entering in and
[31:26] um and
[31:29] uh you know I'm I'm one of those that I
[31:32] don't I don't know that I
[31:34] necessarily feel it the same way as
[31:36] everyone else. Um I feel it but it
[31:40] doesn't I don't know. I'm just doesn't
[31:43] hit me quite the same way as everyone
[31:45] else. But being in the presence and just
[31:47] watching how the Lord would work on each
[31:49] one. And um it's a
[31:53] very it's a very intimate moment cuz
[31:55] even as they're going through and it's
[31:56] like this is a fast prayer line. This is
[31:58] not meant for it to be very long. Still
[32:02] seeing these brothers that they would
[32:05] grab a person and some of them you would
[32:08] know, okay, they they know this person
[32:09] is from their church or from whoever.
[32:11] But there were many of them where like
[32:13] they don't know who this person is and
[32:14] they would it is it was it wasn't a
[32:17] generic prayer. They would be hitting
[32:20] and you could tell the spirit of the
[32:21] Lord was dealing with each person that
[32:23] was coming through and you know not to
[32:27] the point of like when the the prophet
[32:29] would be discerning and saying this is
[32:31] your name. This is where you're from.
[32:32] But at the same time discerning and
[32:35] praying in a way that you could tell was
[32:37] dealing with something specific. This
[32:39] wasn't just Lord touch them as they come
[32:41] through or Lord bless them. This was the
[32:44] spirit of the Lord coming in going we
[32:46] need to deal with this and we need to
[32:48] deal with that.
[32:50] and being in that moment and
[32:54] um you know, brother brother Cole, we
[32:56] may not have gotten to see it, but I got
[32:58] to see all the youth coming through and
[33:01] um all the ones from our church
[33:04] and seeing them as they would step
[33:06] across that line and suddenly be be
[33:09] weeping as they were going through the
[33:10] line and and having the
[33:12] opportunity for me standing there to be
[33:16] praying for them directly to go, Lord, I
[33:18] pray that you would touch this one cuz I
[33:20] know this person. I mean, I could pray
[33:22] for all of them coming through, but to
[33:23] see the ones that were coming through
[33:24] that was, you know, this is one of the
[33:27] kids from my church or this is my son or
[33:30] my daughter. Um, and it was just a a
[33:34] really
[33:35] special a special place for me to be
[33:39] able to to be in an
[33:41] experience after coming
[33:44] through a day or two where I was
[33:47] battling, I was dealing with with my
[33:50] different things. And then to go into it
[33:52] and just see the Lord moving, the Lord
[33:55] addressing, and see the Lord dealing
[33:57] with it. And whether it was the kids
[33:59] coming through or whether it was just
[34:02] different members from the church that I
[34:04] knew or even seeing my own wife going
[34:06] through, seeing the Lord dealing with
[34:08] each one as they went through was
[34:12] just such a
[34:14] special time and a special place to be
[34:17] in. Um, and it's just something that I
[34:19] know that
[34:20] I'll whether there will be other prayer
[34:22] lines where I get the same spot. I this
[34:25] one's going to stand out because it was
[34:26] the first one where I really got to see
[34:28] this and experience this and it was it
[34:30] was just a real blessing.
[34:42] Can we can we stand just for a minute? I
[34:44] think brother Michael has a testimony.
[34:47] Can we stand real quick and let you
[34:48] stretch your legs for a minute and can
[34:51] we look sing Look what the Lord has
[34:53] done. Look what the Lord has done in
[34:55] you. Look what the Lord has
[35:00] done. Oh, look what the Lord has
[35:05] done. Oh, he healed my body. He touched
[35:10] my mind. He saved
[35:13] me just in time. Oh, I'm going to praise
[35:19] his
[35:20] name. Oh, each day he's just the
[35:25] [Music]
[35:26] same. Come on and praise him. Look what
[35:30] the Lord has done. One more time now.
[35:34] Oh, now look what the Lord has
[35:39] done. Look what the Lord has done.
[35:45] Oh, he healed my body. He touched my
[35:49] mind. Oh, he saved
[35:52] me just in time. Oh, I'm going to praise
[35:58] his
[36:00] name. Each day it's just the
[36:05] same. Come on and praise him. Look what
[36:09] the Lord has done.
[36:15] Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you. Now,
[36:18] you may be seated.
[36:25] Amen. Well, I enjoyed uh youth camp. I
[36:28] still consider myself youth and some of
[36:31] the youth that I bring in wouldn't be
[36:33] here if I wasn't here.
[36:37] So, so but uh I always I always have
[36:41] liked or enjoyed youth camp especially
[36:44] since this year we haven't had to do so
[36:46] much loading and unloading and man it's
[36:49] it's been great. Yeah. So u appreciate
[36:52] everybody's uh work that went on there
[36:55] and and um just to kind of and I really
[36:58] liked enjoying riding the golf carts.
[37:01] That was really fun. And uh but uh just
[37:05] kind of looking around and just seeing
[37:07] seeing the uh the vision and kind of
[37:10] seeing where we come from and camp and
[37:13] where we where we are now and and um
[37:16] sure appreciate all of the the elders
[37:19] vision, you know, seeing what's going on
[37:21] because we got the potential to put on
[37:22] just a really big camp and um then the
[37:26] ministers that have been brought in and
[37:28] to preach to the way that they u the way
[37:31] that they do And like brother was
[37:33] saying, brother Harry was saying, I
[37:35] mean, people from all different levels,
[37:37] whether it's youth and the and the the
[37:40] elder people, I guess you call it, you
[37:42] know, the that come, you know, they can
[37:44] receive from there. And then um you know
[37:47] I know the people that own the camp
[37:49] don't realize you know the style of of
[37:52] church that we have you know and to see
[37:55] the the kids actually entering in um
[38:00] blesses my heart you know and you guys
[38:03] uh creating the atmosphere to where the
[38:06] spirit of the Lord can come and be there
[38:08] and and I felt the Lord's presence real
[38:11] strong even all the way in the back
[38:12] there and and um it done my heart to see
[38:16] our youth blessed and um you know done
[38:19] my heart good to see uh actually you
[38:22] know how effective the youth camps are
[38:24] because a lot of a lot of the people you
[38:26] know that I kind of hang out with around
[38:28] there you know they went to youth camps
[38:30] too you know and and the Lord can really
[38:33] you know do something for them you know
[38:35] while they're at camp and kind of ground
[38:37] and stabilize you and and um you know so
[38:40] I was just really blessed by the the
[38:42] ministry I liked the uh the point that
[38:45] Brother Andrew made about the Red Sea,
[38:48] you know, and I thought that was a
[38:49] really valid point going through the
[38:50] prayer line and uh the message there at
[38:53] the end, Brother Timothy and um you
[38:57] know, it just did it just did my heart
[38:59] good to see everybody just blessed and
[39:01] and uh see uh a lot of our youth
[39:06] musicians and the uh uh you know, the
[39:10] song leading and the different brothers
[39:12] and different ones that are helping out
[39:15] and uh and I just really enjoyed enjoyed
[39:18] the camp and was blessed by it. So
[39:24] [Applause]
[39:36] Joe here as it always is, you know, from
[39:40] my first time going um what seven years
[39:43] ago
[39:45] Yeah, I mean it's just every year it
[39:47] just gets even better. Uh going to the
[39:50] prayer line uh was
[39:53] wonderful. Uh I got really blessed by
[39:55] God. Uh got a total deliverance.
[40:02] And uh I want to thank God for that.
[40:05] when me and you was out drinking coffee
[40:09] and uh you know how my stomach is with
[40:10] all that coffee I've been battling and I
[40:12] said by his stripes I'm healed. I didn't
[40:15] say nothing but something come down I
[40:18] can drink coffee. I'm drinking coffee
[40:20] today fellowship hall and I want to
[40:22] thank God for that too.
[40:26] Amen. That's
[40:28] awesome. I want to say we we did
[40:31] appreciate our our night guards. Amen.
[40:33] They don't get talked about enough, but
[40:35] they're the first ones up. Last ones to
[40:36] bed,
[40:37] so appreciate
[40:39] them. Brother Patrick made it
[40:42] interesting the first the first morning.
[40:44] Hey, everybody loved it. He would go
[40:46] around with the uh the megaphone and
[40:48] play music trying to get everybody up
[40:50] and he came up to me. He's like, "Now, I
[40:52] don't understand." He goes, "I'm
[40:53] supposed to be punishing these kids by
[40:56] playing this music and getting them out
[40:57] of bed, but they were loving it." So,
[40:59] yeah, we had we had a good time. We
[41:01] appreciate all of all of their help.
[41:04] Amen. Anyone else? Brother Nathaniel.
[41:24] Okay. First of all, I want to say thank
[41:27] you to all all of y'all that have put
[41:30] this together and
[41:32] all. Everything was just amazing. Uh
[41:35] camp here has always been a huge
[41:38] highlight of my year. So, want to thank
[41:41] y'all. And then, uh so, first of all, uh
[41:46] I came to camp and I had different
[41:50] problems like I had a few complexes that
[41:52] I've just really been battling with. And
[41:56] then uh I just had a real desire to get
[41:59] a refilling of the Holy Ghost. So I came
[42:03] down or whatever. And first service,
[42:06] brother Andrew preaches and talking to
[42:08] us about the forecast or whatever and
[42:11] how this whole weekend is just going to
[42:13] be nothing but deliverances and
[42:16] breakthroughs and all that. So I was
[42:18] like, man, this is going to be a good
[42:19] week.
[42:21] So yeah, but uh I just want to say uh
[42:26] that I received the refilling of the
[42:28] Holy Ghost. Those complexes that I had,
[42:31] the Lord completely took them away and
[42:34] that I just had an awesome time and
[42:38] thank all of y'all for making this
[42:40] happen.
[42:43] [Applause]
[42:48] You have a song as well.
[42:52] This guy, this guy can sing.
[42:58] Sister Denise,
[43:08] I want to say that doing the youth camps
[43:10] the last few years, seeing our kids
[43:13] growing up, seeing them come back
[43:16] married and then the next year they're
[43:18] coming back with their children is
[43:21] really an awesome thing to see. And
[43:23] seeing the excitement when they check in
[43:25] to, you know, because they just know
[43:28] something's going to happen. Well,
[43:29] something happened to me at youth camp,
[43:31] too. I've been holding on to this. I'm
[43:33] sorry, brother Window. I never shared
[43:35] this with you last night, but um since
[43:38] youth camp, I have not had one stomach
[43:41] problem at all. Not one pain, not one
[43:44] nausea, nothing.
[43:48] And I had I had to go for an enzyme shot
[43:52] because, you know, the pancreas is not
[43:53] producing enzymes anymore. The blood
[43:56] test was normal. Everything was normal.
[43:58] The digestive enzymes are normal. There
[44:01] was no shots given. And I can actually
[44:04] drink milk and eat foods that I haven't
[44:06] been able to eat in a long time. So, the
[44:08] Lord really touched me there and has
[44:09] healed that pancreas.
[44:12] [Applause]
[44:23] Well, I guess I can qualify for uh youth
[44:26] camp. This is my second
[44:30] childhood. But um this year I went and
[44:35] it seemed like there was an expectation.
[44:38] I didn't know what was going to happen
[44:39] because I know, you know, we volunteer
[44:43] to to help wherever we can and and that
[44:46] was exciting in itself too because we
[44:48] didn't have to do as as much. But um
[44:52] when they started preaching and I kept
[44:54] thinking I just like you know he just
[44:57] like it's coming it's coming you know
[45:00] when he said that forecast and the Red
[45:02] Sea when he got
[45:04] there all the the things that I've
[45:07] carried for years that I thought were
[45:12] gone I could feel them. They just they
[45:15] just
[45:17] left. And there's some things that were
[45:20] that were really really hurtful as a as
[45:23] a little girl that I kept saying that
[45:26] every time that I go to the altar or
[45:29] whatever, it something comes back and it
[45:31] nags at me and it says you're not you're
[45:34] not delivered. you know, nobody cares
[45:38] about this or they see it in you and and
[45:43] that Satan was just kind of picking at
[45:45] me and I always tell them, "Get lost cuz
[45:47] you've already
[45:49] lost." And um this year when I went
[45:52] through that line, I was watching the
[45:54] kids, Katrina and I were sitting
[45:56] together and as that line was going
[45:58] around, the closer it got, you could
[46:01] tell straight across from us that that
[46:04] you could feel it. It was so strong that
[46:08] that you could see the the faces on them
[46:11] that they were entering in. And as they
[46:13] got up closer to that, I thought, "Wow,
[46:16] something's fixing to bust loose here
[46:18] any minute." And as they got there, like
[46:20] brother Harry said, you can you can feel
[46:23] it. It's just like that threshold. They
[46:26] were just stepping into I saying the Red
[46:29] Sea, you know, cuz cuz that's where the
[46:31] deliverance came. And um myself when I
[46:35] went up there I kept thinking I've been
[46:38] praying for quite a while for
[46:40] specifically for brother Duran's healing
[46:43] my sister Toto who's who's now almost
[46:46] totally blind and different ones of my
[46:50] grandchildren who have um addiction
[46:53] problems and and I thought well a week
[46:57] before we had camp something happened to
[47:00] my hip and every time I'd step on it my
[47:03] hip would hurt so so bad. And I just
[47:06] said, "Lord, you're going to take care
[47:09] of it cuz I'm going and doing my thing.
[47:11] I'm going to help wherever I can and I
[47:13] know you're going to take care of it."
[47:15] And that first night we stepped in
[47:17] there, it was like um I could feel it.
[47:21] It felt better. I can step on it. I
[47:23] could walk on it. I could do things. I
[47:25] could lift and do all those things. And
[47:27] by the time I got up to that line that
[47:31] Saturday night when I was going to step
[47:33] into that into the realm is what I in my
[47:37] mind keep calling it. It was gone. It
[47:40] was just it left. And I thank you Lord
[47:45] for healing my body. And I my prayer for
[47:49] myself was was Lord one more time just
[47:52] give me the strength to do it one more
[47:54] time. And when I got in there and before
[47:59] I
[47:59] never I was always just praying,
[48:02] thanking the Lord, you know, every time
[48:03] I went to a prayer line, but this time
[48:06] it's like the Lord opened my ears
[48:08] because
[48:11] um when brother Andrew touched me, it's
[48:16] just like like something just popped in
[48:20] my spirit and I heard him say that I've
[48:23] been praying for my
[48:25] my native people, my Indian nation. And
[48:28] he said, "It's granted." And that's what
[48:32] popped because before the Lord comes,
[48:35] all Native Americans have to hear hear
[48:38] this message. Has to hear about the
[48:40] Lord. And that's been that's been my
[48:43] prayer for my people. I know it was I
[48:46] always said to myself, that's a tall
[48:48] order, but my God is so much bigger than
[48:51] any problem this world has to offer.
[48:56] So I I heard that and it was like,
[48:59] "Thank you, Lord. I've been praying that
[49:02] that their spiritual eyes be open, their
[49:05] spiritual ears be open so that they can
[49:08] hear him calling me in their heart." And
[49:10] I said, "Lord, one sweep." Because the
[49:13] natives, we believe in the spiritual
[49:16] realm and one sweep is all it's going to
[49:19] take that that all of them are going to
[49:23] see who he really is and it's going to
[49:26] happen. I believed that with all my
[49:29] heart. And and as I was going through
[49:31] the line, I kept hearing things that
[49:34] that I had been, you know, how sometimes
[49:38] when you when you pray, you're going
[49:39] down the road and you're you're praying
[49:41] and and you you drop a little prayer
[49:43] about something. I heard those being
[49:46] answered as I walk through that line.
[49:49] And I thought, Lord, you're so mindful.
[49:52] I don't care how old I am or what what I
[49:55] think might be little bitty problems to
[49:58] to a lot of people, but you're so
[50:00] mindful. You heard it. You answered it.
[50:03] And I just thank him for it because this
[50:06] this camp was really for me. And and I
[50:09] seen my family before I got to the end.
[50:12] I seen my family coming coming to him
[50:16] coming together. So, I just thank the
[50:18] Lord for that camp and I love him and I
[50:21] love my church and I thank you for
[50:23] creating that atmosphere, all you you
[50:26] folks that are up there on that stage
[50:28] because that atmosphere is what did it
[50:32] for everybody. It it allowed those
[50:34] preachers to to step in there and just
[50:37] deliver what the Lord had for each and
[50:40] every one of us. And every time they
[50:42] spoke directly to me and I want to thank
[50:44] you all. God bless you for what you do.
[50:49] [Applause]
[50:56] Amen. As brother Caleb's getting ready
[50:59] to come, I want to say appreciate all
[51:02] the prayers to Grandpa. I I don't know
[51:03] if you noticed, but we had six services
[51:06] and Grandpa, I believe, was at all all
[51:08] six of them, wasn't he? Or at least all
[51:10] the nights.
[51:13] Okay.
[51:21] Okay.
[51:24] Yeah.
[51:33] Amen.
[51:38] So
[51:39] yeah, and uh I you know I u he he wanted
[51:44] me to take him to get a haircut uh
[51:48] Monday and um you know so I come to the
[51:51] house and u you know he he gets up
[51:55] without any help gets up and walking to
[51:57] the door and and I'm wanting to tell him
[52:00] you know uh better grab that cane and
[52:04] and then I thought you No, I'm not going
[52:06] to hinder his faith. And and uh I tell
[52:09] you what, he walked right out to the car
[52:11] as if it was nothing. Got out of the
[52:13] car, went to the went into the barber,
[52:15] sit on the Hallelujah.
[52:18] Amen. Wonderful savior. Amen. Well, we
[52:22] all know how big that auditorium is at
[52:24] the camp. And on Grandpa's testimony, he
[52:26] said he walked made three trips to the
[52:28] front and the back. Wasn't he carrying
[52:30] chairs or something? Carrying something?
[52:31] No, he was he was coming up carrying
[52:33] microphone cords and and things, guitar
[52:36] stands
[52:38] up from that stage all the way back
[52:40] there to the truck area there. So, it
[52:43] was uh well, all I can say is I I told
[52:46] dad I said, you know, this is I I just
[52:49] as God can do that that I believe that
[52:52] every symptom, every shake, every God
[52:56] can do those things before we even have
[52:58] a body change. Amen. I just believe it.
[53:01] It's going. I I believe miracles are
[53:03] coming.
[53:06] Amen. Yes, sir.
[53:09] Praise the
[53:14] Lord. Mine's a little bit
[53:17] of it's a testimony in a
[53:20] song. I like to tell the testimony
[53:22] first. That's okay.
[53:27] So, not too many people knew if any at
[53:30] all. Just these past
[53:33] just two years or even three or four,
[53:37] however long I've been a Christian or
[53:39] have claimed to be one, I've just been
[53:42] fighting
[53:43] something.
[53:45] And I wrestled with it for just so long.
[53:49] And I didn't know what it what it was. I
[53:52] couldn't find out what it was.
[53:55] And I thought maybe it's just one
[53:58] singular thing in my past that I did.
[54:00] Then I can be free from everything. And
[54:03] it didn't work out like that. Every time
[54:05] I thought I would be delivered of
[54:07] something, I ran right back to it. And
[54:12] um I'm going to have to go down this
[54:14] rabbit hole before I start.
[54:17] But so it was the night I was um the
[54:22] night I made the decision to be baptized
[54:25] about two or three years ago that
[54:30] um when I was uh doing the sound, I just
[54:35] felt something around my heart as if it
[54:37] were chains or just something in sort of
[54:41] like a X pattern just tugging me towards
[54:43] the front like there's something for you
[54:47] And it pulled me to the front and I just
[54:50] started praying and
[54:53] uh as I lifted my
[54:55] hands, I felt just think of the softest
[54:59] hands you can and they were all over my
[55:01] arms. They were lifting me
[55:04] upward.
[55:05] And I believe that those were angels
[55:08] helping me and lifting me up to be
[55:10] prayed
[55:11] for. And I hadn't felt that in over two
[55:14] years. And it would happen every time I
[55:16] prayed, but something happened to where
[55:18] I I was lost or I just wasn't delivered
[55:21] to something that was keeping me from
[55:23] it.
[55:25] And I was just fighting something. I
[55:28] couldn't find out what it was. And to
[55:31] tell you the truth, I it was so much
[55:34] that I didn't really want to come to
[55:35] this camp this year. I honestly had not
[55:38] planned on it, but my mom was the one
[55:41] wanting me to go and I didn't want to
[55:44] deny her any sort of a blessing or
[55:46] anything. So, I went and
[55:51] um the first
[55:53] night I didn't know what I was
[55:55] expecting, but I knew something had to
[55:57] happen or just something is going to
[56:00] happen.
[56:01] And uh brother Windle had came up and I
[56:06] was just praying for God to let me know
[56:08] that he hasn't forsaken me, that he's
[56:11] still come after me. And then brother
[56:13] Wendle had walked up and he started
[56:15] talking to me about just different
[56:17] things that are happening and that have
[56:19] happened in my life and just that I need
[56:22] to believe this. And he asked me several
[56:24] times, do you believe this that it will
[56:27] be? And I said yes. And I knew he could
[56:31] tell and I could tell, but in my heart
[56:33] there was just a wall. I didn't know how
[56:37] to break it down, but there was a wall
[56:39] just blocking me from getting something.
[56:42] And uh, Brother Window had said that if
[56:45] you hadn't gotten anything, you and God
[56:47] need to have a serious talk. And I just
[56:51] started praying. I sat down and I
[56:53] started praying afterwards
[56:55] because I was just searching for what am
[56:57] I missing? What am I fighting here?
[57:00] Because like I should be getting
[57:02] something, but I don't know what I
[57:03] should be getting if I don't know what
[57:05] I'm fighting. And I don't know if it was
[57:08] that night or the night or the morning
[57:10] afterwards, but I figured it out. God
[57:12] revealed it to me that I'd been fighting
[57:16] the entirety of my past.
[57:18] just everything I'd done um and
[57:22] everything before I even was a
[57:24] Christian. Just everything I was
[57:26] fighting
[57:27] that
[57:29] and just that being revealed to me, I
[57:33] realized
[57:34] like this has been going on for so long
[57:37] and I didn't even realize about it. It's
[57:40] defining who I am. It's defining what
[57:42] I'm going to be.
[57:45] and I was just tired of it. And I wanted
[57:49] it
[57:51] gone. And it wasn't just that. I had
[57:54] complexes of the constant need to fit in
[57:57] or just people not caring about me or
[57:59] being alone. And um the night after it
[58:04] was Saturday night
[58:07] um and I had wrote down in my notes
[58:10] before brother Andrew had came up and I
[58:12] said, "Not to my past, but looking at my
[58:15] future with
[58:16] God.
[58:17] And I'm pretty certain he almost said
[58:21] that exact phrase over and over
[58:23] again.
[58:26] And I had asked God to throw something
[58:28] in there for me and that was it. It was
[58:31] just confirming that what I found was
[58:34] right. Like this is what you're
[58:35] fighting. You need to get rid of it here
[58:38] and
[58:39] now. And then he had talked about um the
[58:43] See, and I've always loved the story of
[58:45] Moses and the deliverance of the
[58:48] Israelites, but I'd never seen a prayer
[58:51] like like that before. Like, I never
[58:53] thought of it that way to where you
[58:57] leave all of your past or anything
[58:59] you're fighting behind. You go through
[59:01] the prayer line just confirming what you
[59:04] believe and then you come out into the
[59:07] promised land or you're
[59:08] new.
[59:10] And that's the way looked at it and
[59:13] that's exactly what happened. And I
[59:16] didn't really feel anything as far as
[59:19] like goosebumps or anything, but it was
[59:21] in my heart that I knew something
[59:23] changed. Something's different today.
[59:26] And u once I had gotten back to my seat
[59:30] because before I went up, I had said,
[59:31] "I'm leaving my past
[59:33] here and I'm not picking it back up
[59:36] again."
[59:38] And as soon as I got back to my seat,
[59:42] I I just started praying. And as soon as
[59:45] I raised my hands again, I felt those
[59:46] angels again. After two years of not
[59:50] feeling them or hearing from them, I
[59:53] felt them
[59:54] again. And I know I'm delivered of
[59:59] it. And I know that it's no longer my
[1:00:04] past, but it's my future with God that
[1:00:06] I'm looking to. Amen.
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:32] Oh, I searched the
[1:00:35] world, but it couldn't fill
[1:00:39] me. Oh, man's empty praise and treasures
[1:00:43] that fade never enough.
[1:00:48] And then you came
[1:00:52] along and put me back
[1:00:56] together. Now every desire is now
[1:01:01] satisfied here in your
[1:01:05] love. Cuz there's
[1:01:08] nothing better than you. There's
[1:01:12] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[1:01:16] nothing nothing is better than
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:25] you. Oh, I'm not
[1:01:30] afraid to show you my
[1:01:34] weakness. All my failures and flaws.
[1:01:37] Lord, you've seen them all and you still
[1:01:40] call me
[1:01:42] friend. Cuz the God of the mountain,
[1:01:47] he's still God in the
[1:01:50] valley and there's not a place your
[1:01:54] mercy and grace won't find me
[1:02:00] again. Cuz there's
[1:02:03] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[1:02:07] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[1:02:11] nothing nothing is better than
[1:02:16] you. Oh Lord, there's
[1:02:19] nothing better than you. Lord, there's
[1:02:24] nothing better than you. Lord, there's
[1:02:28] nothing nothing is better than
[1:02:33] you. I know it's true.

[1:02:43] dancing. You give beauty for
[1:02:47] ashes. You turn shame into glory. You're
[1:02:51] the only one who
[1:02:55] can. You turn mourning to
[1:02:59] dancing. You give beauty for ashes.
[1:03:04] You turn shame into
[1:03:07] glory. You're the only one who can.
[1:03:12] You're the only one who
[1:03:16] can. You turn graves into
[1:03:20] gardens. You turn bones into
[1:03:24] armies. You turn seas into highways.
[1:03:28] You're the only one who can. And you're
[1:03:33] the only one who can. Cuz there's
[1:03:39] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[1:03:43] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[1:03:47] nothing nothing is better than you.
[1:03:53] Lord, there's
[1:03:55] nothing better than you. Lord, there's
[1:03:59] nothing better than you. Lord, there's
[1:04:04] nothing nothing is better than
[1:04:10] you. You turn graves into
[1:04:14] gardens. You turn bones into
[1:04:18] armies. You turn seas into highways.
[1:04:22] You're the only one who can.
[1:04:28] You turn graves into
[1:04:31] gardens. You turn bones into
[1:04:35] armies. You turn seas into highways.
[1:04:39] You're the only one who can. You're the
[1:04:44] only one who
[1:04:47] can. You turn mourning to
[1:04:51] dancing. You give beauty for ashes.
[1:04:56] You turn shame into glory. You're the
[1:05:00] only one who can. And you're the only
[1:05:05] one who
[1:05:08] can. Because there's
[1:05:11] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[1:05:15] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[1:05:19] nothing nothing is better than you.
[1:05:25] Oh, cuz there's
[1:05:27] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[1:05:32] nothing better than you, Lord. There's
[1:05:35] nothing nothing is better than you.

[1:12:15] to you, Lord. Sing

[1:13:17] [Music]
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:30] Well, blue skies and hillsides feel so
[1:13:33] far away. And I wrote in my notebook
[1:13:36] that I've seen better days than the ones
[1:13:39] as of
[1:13:41] late. Oh, I can't bear the waves.
[1:13:47] The rain won't stop pouring out my
[1:13:50] window pain. And I haven't left my
[1:13:52] bedroom in 76 days. Wish something would
[1:13:58] change cuz I'm losing
[1:14:02] faith. So I brought it up in a desperate
[1:14:07] prayer. Lord, why are you keeping me
[1:14:11] here? Then he said to
[1:14:14] me, "Oh child, I'm planting
[1:14:18] seeds, cuz I'm a good and I have a good
[1:14:23] plan. So trust that I'm holding a
[1:14:26] watering can. And someday you'll see
[1:14:31] that
[1:14:33] flowers
[1:14:34] grow in the valley."
[1:14:37] [Music]
[1:14:40] So whatever the reason, I'm barely
[1:14:42] getting by. Trust it's a season knowing
[1:14:46] that you're by my side every step of the
[1:14:51] way and I'll be
[1:14:54] okay cuz I brought it up in a desperate
[1:15:00] prayer. Lord, why are you keeping me
[1:15:03] here? Then he said to
[1:15:06] me, "Child, I'm planting
[1:15:11] seeds, I'm a good God and I have a good
[1:15:15] plan. Trust that I'm holding a watering
[1:15:19] can and someday you'll
[1:15:23] see that
[1:15:24] flowers
[1:15:26] grow in the valley.
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:43] When I'm on a mountain looking down
[1:15:46] below, I see a valley of flowers and
[1:15:49] needed time to grow. And I thank you for
[1:15:53] the rain,
[1:15:55] the hurt, and days of pain.

[1:44:02] you no human being has ever reached the
[1:44:05] limitations of God.
[1:44:08] We put the limitations on. We say,
[1:44:09] "Okay, well, I go to church, I do this,
[1:44:11] I do that, and that's all I want." But I
[1:44:13] want to I want to tell you, if you want
[1:44:14] more of God, you can have more.
[1:44:17] Seek after the Lord.
[1:44:20] Amen. Pull. you don't don't quit praying
[1:44:22] just because you're you're you're out of
[1:44:24] camp. Call out to the Lord there at at
[1:44:27] the uh at your home. Develop that
[1:44:30] relationship with the Lord. And we and
[1:44:33] we know the Lord will be there. I uh I
[1:44:36] thought I thought everything uh even
[1:44:39] your testimony, Brother Caleb, Amen.
[1:44:43] and um all the testimonies. But the
[1:44:45] thing is is
[1:44:47] is you
[1:44:49] know we go through those dry spells in
[1:44:52] our lives and
[1:44:54] we but the but the main thing for all of
[1:44:57] us is is we want to make sure that we've
[1:45:00] got a good s we want to find
[1:45:04] Jesus and we don't ever we don't ever
[1:45:07] quit. We're thankful for what God does
[1:45:09] for us at camp or does for us at a
[1:45:11] service, but we never quit.
[1:45:15] And sometimes, as I I like the way
[1:45:18] brother brother Caleb put it, it felt
[1:45:20] like angels lifting you
[1:45:23] up. And there's sometimes when you don't
[1:45:26] feel those
[1:45:27] angels, but that doesn't change God's
[1:45:30] love for us. And it doesn't
[1:45:32] change who we are. The main thing is is
[1:45:36] having that new
[1:45:38] birth because I will say that there's
[1:45:40] been plenty of those
[1:45:42] times where I have felt like I have
[1:45:46] walked with
[1:45:49] angels. There's been those
[1:45:52] times where I have felt so all
[1:45:58] alone. But it's so good to know God's
[1:46:01] love for me.
[1:46:03] It's so good to
[1:46:05] know that what he done in my life, no
[1:46:08] one can ever take that away.
[1:46:11] Never take that away.
[1:46:14] And that's why I love
[1:46:16] him so very
[1:46:18] much. Do you love him tonight? Have you
[1:46:22] elders experienced that? his great love
[1:46:26] for you
[1:46:28] that no matter where you
[1:46:32] are, it's an incredible
[1:46:34] thing. I thank God for that.
[1:46:39] Well, amen. Listening to those
[1:46:41] testimonies, I I was smiling and
[1:46:44] crying
[1:46:47] and enjoyed myself here tonight. God
[1:46:50] richly bless you.
