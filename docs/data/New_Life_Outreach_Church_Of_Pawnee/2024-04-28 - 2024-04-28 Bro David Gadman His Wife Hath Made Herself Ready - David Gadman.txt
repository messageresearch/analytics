everybody's got to step up this morning amen so amen so just just say Amen or home me or ouch or whatever amen we'll try to get you out of here as quick as we can amen and so my wife sitting back there and when you look back there and she you see her closer notebook I guess that's about time to stop amen so we pre she's going to kill me amen no she go like this that means cut it amen you love him appreciate them Esther the first chapter we want to look at the first or the 10th or through the 12th verse says on the seventh day when the heart of the King was married with wine he commanded and you see all there names there seven of them he said the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of russas the king to bring Vesti the the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princess her beauty sure for she was fair to look upon but the queen V I refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him then drop down there to the 19th verse say if it please the king Let There Go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the mes that it be not altered that vesi come no more before the king arus and let the King give her Royal Estate unto another that is is better than she may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated if you want to look over in Revelations the 19th Chapter don't have to turn there but I'm sure I'll put it up on screen and right the seventh verse here's what I want to draw my thoughts from this morning amen it said verse Revelations 19:7 it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready like to speak on that this morning his wife hath made herself ready his wife hath made herself ready now I was thinking and and then along these lines and just and just thinking about uh this this and I was thinking about it here the other day and just I spoke on it back home at the church uh the last time I spoke there and I guess is this my water right here in this cup amen I'm than about everything that's going on with uh with uh Israel and different things and just uh you know how it is and and people giving up in the message and quitting and leaving and and all these things and just just seems like you know everything that's going on and we see you know seems like everybody just see you turn here and there's this person needs prayer you turn here this one needs prayer and that one and it just seems like everybody's going through something anymore I mean just you know you heard the old expression when it it seems like when it rains it pours and surely everybody's going through something and I thought you know what but the scripture says his bride ha made herself ready now see I can't make you bride this morning you can't make me bride she's elected is that right but you know what uh you can make yourself ready and I can make myself ready and that's by the word of God oh I want to make myself ready do you as we see the day approaching amen and it's approaching pretty quickly I had text this brother and he had text about a meet a brother that he's going to have a meeting in October and I text him and I said well brother I'll be praying for your meeting amen just be praying for your meeting and he said BR he told he text me that back said Brother David that's good and said I he said I just don't see us heaven and it's it's going to be in October and about six mon he said I just don't see us being here 6 months from now but we never know we never know hey I've heard that expression you know just any day now ever since I remember coming in the message especially and everybody that I know they put dates on here they said 77 they said this and that but I want to tell you something he's going to come back one of these days and if you're not ready you ain't going if I ain't ready I ain't going I remember brother Billy Paul gives this testimony that his dad said hey Billy when he comes back and you're on this side the said you'll go and I want or or vice versa I go and you want so hey I want to be ready just because you say well my dad's a pastor my my my my dad's a preacher what that don't make no difference we ain't got no Monopoly on God we got to make oursel ready like I said I can't make you bride you can't make me bride but we can make oursel ready and that's by the word of God every time I come to the house of God I appreciate brother W's messages last Sunday amen especially you know the about the cost of of Praise amen it cost Christ something amen and it cost me and you something Amen to come to the house of God like this morning when they might not too many of us this morning but we got to put everything we got into serving God and I don't care how many there is or whatever I don't care if it's a house full not a house full if the scripture says we're two and three gather together my name there he be you you believe that this morning amen so I believe there's more than two or three of us here this morning so I believe he's here this morning and so I ain't going to let that stop me or hinder me and it shouldn't let you well that brother Wendell ain't here or this one ain't here no you ought to come into the house of God and say God I don't care who's here I'm going to praise you this morning I'm going to worship you this morning I'm going to give it all I've got this morning cuz I want to be ready to go when you come for me I don't want my banner to be distorted I want my banner to be clear there's too many miles behind me amen too many rivers my feet have gone through there's too much to gain to lose he said brother I got to preach like I'm a dying person preaching to a dying congregation I made it up in my mind several months back I don't care if it hair lips the devil or not I'm going to come to church and I'm going to have myself a good time if people don't feel like raising their hands I got to raise my hands to worship him for what he has done for me has he been good to you now let me read you a couple things the prophet said is that all right God keeps his word 1957 now said now if you'll notice he said as it was in the days of Noah in the days of Noah Before the Flood how it would be and God was not willing that any should perish he's still not willing that any of us should perish this morning he don't want to see none of us lost but you know what there's going to be somebody that's lost there's going to be somebody that's saved there's going to be somebody that takes a Rapture there's somebody's going to take get out of here and a body change amen so he left it up to me so I got he said here he didn't say hey the preacher has made you ready he said his wife has made herself ready amen so hey the preacher hey the preacher just preaches it it's up to me to make myself ready Hallelujah now he says and God was not willing that any should perish but that all should come in their repentance God help us this morning then then he suffered long the flood stage was past due down in Egypt it was way past due he said do you get it in the anti thean destruction now way past due the destruction and judgment was Co and coming out of Egypt was way past due you know brother Brown said one place he said the Rapture was overdue help me Lord Amen Let Me God if I need to unpack let me unpack let me unpack my attitude my rotten attitude let me unpack anything that's not like you Lord so I'll be ready to get out of here he said 40 years over time but God was determined God was determined that his word would not return to him he's still determined today that is the Bible says that when his word goes out it won't go out and it won't return back to him void for to go out and do what what it is purpose to do this morning whatever it's purpose to do this morning it'll do that it ain't going to return back void I I hope if it's here this morning to uplift somebody it'll do that if it's here this morning to correct somebody it'll do that whatever the word is called to do this morning that's what he to do he said it's not willing amen he he was determined that his word would not return he made a promise is that right oh Hallelujah alah he made a promise to us this morning you know the Bible you said there's a lot of people slipping away this one died and this one died but you know God said in his word that there's going to be some that are alive and remain amen that scripture ain't going to go unfulfilled whether it's me or you there's going to be somebody that's alive and remain waiting for the catching way of the Lord amen I determined say Lord let me be a part of that group but if I ain't let me be ready Lord either way Lord let me be be ready so he says it says he's not determined that his word would he's determined that his word will not return to him he's going to keep his word he has to keep his word he must do it in order to be God think about that if he has to make a change of everything and by Grace he will do it that's the reason I say if the church does not get herself ready he said he said that's your duty to get ready the bride has made herself ready the guard garments is paid for they are ready but you must be ready to wear those garments I wonder this morning if we can say that we're ready to wear those garments this morning oh and we don't cut the Garment to fit us we cut ourselves to fit the Garment amen Elijah didn't cut Elisha didn't cut himself down to fit Elijah's uh cut the Garment Elijah's Manel to fit himself he had to cut himself down to fit the manle God help us this morning to cut oursel down to fit the word of God Hallelujah he said the go they're ready but you must be ready the church has made herself ready you believe that this morning again he says amen 1958 sudden secret going away of the church he said some people say well I'll go to church on Sunday morning I listen to our pastor which is a fine preacher he said that's good I appreciate that in you are the America the world what whoever it is but it takes more than a good message from the pull pit he said it takes more than a good message from the pull pit it takes you to get ready it takes your life in Revelations the 19th Chapter the seventh verse the Bible said that speaking of the bride of Christ she has made herself ready she made herself ready and you as members of his this bride you got to make yourself ready are we members this morning of his bride then you got to make yourself ready this morning again the same message sudden secret catching away of the church he said you see God does he you see you see God does work through the pastor to get his church ready he works through the songs to get his church ready amen he works to the songs he works to the pastor amen that's why I pray at this morning we gathered in the back pray for those that playing the instruments brother meral he's leading this in wor I don't want to just be brother Moro and brother morl right don't want it just be him amen he gets up here and he starts L we got to enter in and if we don't it's just entertainment or just become uh going through the motions or I don't want to just go through the motions I want to come cuz he said the preacher makes you ready not only he said and the songs that we s it helps get you ready Oh my he said the songs he said and he works to you to get his church ready if your pastor would fail and continually to fail you hunt you another Pastor quickly you would do that if you're choir didn't sing right or your soloist wasn't right you said to the director the one who has the music don't let them sing no more they just make me nervous to sing that's what he said now I'm just reading what he says he said say what the tape say so I'm just saying what he says amen he said Hey listen you you'd hunt you out if your pastor continue to would fail and continue you'd hunt you out another Pastor especially if you got away from the word of God you'd hunt yourself out another Pastor wouldn't you hey he said if the S the so if the S he said Hey listen qu didn't saying right the soless wasn't right you go to you go to brother say hey don't let them saying no more it makes me nervous what he said so then he says but what about you as an individual on see I I'm I'm guilty or I'm responsible for what I let go in my house you as husbands you got F you're responsible what you let go in your house but me as an individual I'm going to have to stand before God my wife I have to stand before God every one of you it's an individual Affair he said but what about you as individual how do you fail he said how do you fail in your daily living He said how do you tally up with God that's something to think about how do you tally up with God how do you fail you well Brother David you can look you can you're a good Christian I I just believe you're the bride you're part of the Bride but I wonder when God gets me under his microscope how does he see me this morning amen I may say brother Burl hey I I appreciate you I just believe you you're right on 100% but how does God when God gets brother Merl under that M or anybody else how does God see us this morning how do we tally up this morning you isn't in how do you tally up he said what does God he said What God Says for you to be a shining light that sits on the hill he said no one can pass that way went around your way without knowing about Jesus oh that's what I want then hey man when I'm at my job or wh I at whatever I'm doing Lord when people come around me I want them to see Jesus I want them to see you Lord amen I want them to see Lord I want him to see love I want him to see patience I want him to see forgiveness I want him to see longsuffering hey he was longsuffering to you if it wasn't for his grace you wouldn't be none of us would be here this morning but because of his Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound we're here this morning amen oh I want to have Grace for one another amen but oh I don't want to have too much I wanted to get back I it's got to be a balance all of that God help us to get ourselves how do I tally up this morning when I come around people when people come around me can they see Jesus you remember in the Bible it was joh uh Peter and John when they was going down to the temple for it was the third hour the day going on the nth hour day going down there to pray and this man that been begging arms sit around there maybe he was there in the when Jesus walked the shorts again I don't know but there he was was cuz he said been crippled from his birth and when he got up there he held out his cup and Peter said look on us I imagine that guy thought brother Mor I'm fixing to get something oh but Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None brother said you could that's a good sign to look at them and say they were uh Pentecostal preachers cuz Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto thee in the name of the Lord Jesus rise up and walk amen and a man that was lame from his youth stood up and started walking went in the temple leaping and praising God and the Bible said when they begin to question Peter and John and they had to take note that Peter and John had been with Jesus why because they were producing Christ in their lives what about us this morning what they say about me and you when they come around us amen he said what type of Life do you live one of those typ that's mean and insulting my wife was mentioning something to me this morning I said well and it wasn't about nobody in here but about some of my family back in the family tree I said yeah you all you think the whole side is mean I told her I said yeah you think the whole side is mean amen but he said one of what of the one of those types that's mean and insulting and aggravating indifferent or can you speak of the peace and the love that you have found in Christ she has made herself ready now my theme for this morning is Esther so let's just look at this for a little can we try not to hold you too long my wife ain't would like that yet so in in in Esther the first chapter we read said on the seventh day he begin to call he begin to call his men together the seven chamblin can you imagine look at that seven we had seven Church ages and and that serveing the presence of the king to bring vasti the queen before the king with a crown wall to show the people and the princesses are Beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen vasti refused I thought oh God I thought about that and I thought my here it was how the king had invited his wife cuz she was fair to look upon amen so he she invit she he invited her to come and set by his side cuz he wanted to display her amen wanted to show her off but you know what it said there that the king that the queen refused oh God help us this morning amen we've been invited me and you have this morning have been invited to mold and shape our character like his we've been invited to do that since we but you know what it depends on sometimes the invitation whether we want to go or not how many's ever been invited to something maybe you've got an invitation in the mail a wedding or something and it just depends sometimes on who sent the invitation whether you say oh look at that I ain't going throw it in the trash cuz the person that invited you all right or maybe because the way the invitation looked or maybe or whatever it was but you said well I but hey what about us amen he's invited us amen our lord Jesus who came came down from his home in glory to suffer and die that he might make a home for me and you amen he's invited us this morning I wonder if we're refusing his invitation this morning he's invited us to shape our character like his this morning I say Lord help me then amen you invited me Lord you remember when the Lord was here he spoke a parable about them hey somebody always called it two two fools and a HED husband B it that one that one cuz they said the the king had made a great feast invited them to a wedding supper invited one and they without delay begin to make excuses one said well you know what I bought a piece of ground and I got to go see about it I wonder why they didn't go see about it before they bought it right amen it might have been some swamp land in Florida or something why didn't they go see about it the other one said hey I I I bought five OA oxen and I got to go have them proved why didn't he prove it before prove him before he bought it amen he might have got ripped off or something amen and then the last one said well I'm married a wife and I can't come brother Bram said if anybody had a good excuse it was that last one married the wife but hey he's invited each and every one of us this morning amen and I want to come this morning I don't care what the invitation looked like it came it wasn't wrapped right it was came and it was in a little manger amen wrapped in swadling cloth it didn't look like very much but he invited me

with the word for the hour that we're living in amen and you know God's always he's always kept his word and he and once he started a pattern he's always kept that pattern there he was raised up Martin Luther stepped out begin to speak against the CL that Roman church amen cack that uh thesis on the door said the just shall live by faith and there's a group of people that stood with him amen and said the just shall live by faith but God had a bigger picture in mine he had a plan cuz he was bringing his church trying to get his church his little bride back into maturity again amen and Wesley stepped out amen said there's more than just by faith we ain't doing away with faith you got to live by faith amen not by sight but by faith and said there's more than that you got to have a

maiden which pleaseth the king be and pleaseth the King be Queen instead of vesi and the king pleased the and the thing pleased the king and he did so if you read over there what we read in verse one it says when he said let her crown be taken from her and given to another that is better than that she is you remember when Saul would not listen to Samuel you remember when he not listen and he didn't obey and he brought back the thing all this because he didn't obey when Samuel told him to go out there and kill all the men and women children everything kill the animals everything don't hold nothing back and when he said when he came to Samuel Samu said have you done all hey that that I've said to do he said I've done it all then Samuel said what's the Lo of the ox or the bleeding of the sheep that I hear amen said hey you you you you didn't do all and said who's this King aad why'd you why'd you bring him and all that and hey hey he said bring him here and and Samuel took the sword and hacked them to pieces and he said your kingdom is being ripped from you and giv it to a neighbor better than thou God help us I wanted this morning morning if we don't obey and we don't listen and we refuse to become pregnated with the word of God he won't turn around and give it to somebody else that's better than we are so they begin to fix themselves up to look pretty so they could appear before the king amen the churches today that's what they want the worldly things all these things Amy man do them things to the world let down them bars wonder how the Sheep got out and the goats got in because you let down the bars you begin to compromise with sin you begin to compromise with all these things and sheep got out the goats got in and so they begin to Daw their themselves up begin to pretty theirselves up with all these kind of things and my oh it just you know the things of the world and let down the bars and everything oh my and said oh you know what it's all right we'll compromise hey I was out in the hunky Tonk last night but I got saved this this morning I'm on the platform preaching the gospel or or or playing a guitar brother said you got to be proven he said

and that I can play Monopoly amen or Uno cards with my grandson's at home I didn't come to play that this morning I'll come to say God help me let me make myself ready amen so there had to be proven now drop down to the 15th verse in the second chapter now when the turn of Esther the daughter you see that word there sometimes I don't you know I don't try to pronounce these words unless I'm by myself and if I can't pronounce them you know we have the tape that we can put on the Bible reading and I hope that they're like Alexander scorby and I hope he's pronouncing them right cuz sometimes I don't you know I'm going sometimes brother ml if I don't know I'll just put I said well I'm going to read out verse you know and I'll just put it on and see how he pronounces then I try to get in my mind but I got a little age on me now and sometimes I forget what he said by the time I left the house the time I come to church cuz sometimes you try to pronounce these words and God forgive me but sometimes I Lord I don't know I sound like I'm trying to pronounce these words sound like I'm blaspheming or something trying to pronounce these words or something I said God forgive me I said man why couldn't they just be named Harry and Merl and you know and all that stuff you know or Robert or something you know that have been a whole lot better amen help us Lord oh my say it said that so it says the king there the uncle Mori who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what higi the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her oh this bride is going to obtain favor amen oh they put her in one of these places you know to get herself all fixed up and the Bob says amen the prophet of God said it like this she refused it she said you know what I I I I refuse to put all this stuff on I ain't trying to dress up for them I ain't trying to put on something that I ain't oh there's a lot of us Amen in the church today that try to put on something that we ain't hey I remember working at the place I know about brother ml but you know works for post office or stuff but I work for a place that made nuclear weapons amen final cing point for nuclear weapons and sometimes a general or somebody would come or the the I remember one time we had the the the Secretary of Energy come and and I forget his name but he used to be governor of New Mexico and he came and so my we put on the dog so to speak we we fixed up everything kind of sometimes picked up the rug and swept everything under the rug find out that he like roast beef sandwiches and so hey man they was going everywhere to trying to find roast beef so they could fix him some roof Beast sandwiches and we was lobbying for some jobs that were the Savannah Riverside out there in a in uh uh South Carolina amen here we are in Emerald Texas we want the jobs they're wanting the jobs so we're trying to fix everything up so he lock it I had to stay over uh two or three times that week to clean the carpets and everything you know what we didn't get the job they did amen so it don't matter he wants you to just come just like you are amen and say God let me heart be humble let me be willing to surrender everything I am amen amen let me refuse anything that they hey they're calling for this and they're calling for that but Esther she refused it amen she asked the HEI he said I want to know something what does he like what does the king like and that's how I'll adore Ador myself Amen in what he likes amen that's what I want to do this morning amen what does Jesus like what does God like this morning that's what I want to Adorn myself in the apparel that he likes amen if he don't like it then I don't want it amen I want to Adorn myself Amen in what he likes amen what does the king like amen she wanted nothing but what pleased him that's what I want to do this morning whatever pleases him or you say well I danced in the spirit that's good I can dance with the best of them that's sir I spoke in tongues and that's all right I shouted and that's all right but I want the part of the Living God with a life to back it up I imagine can you imagine asra she might have got discouraged when she looked around and see how everybody else was was dressing up see how everybody was doing seeing their attitude and everything but she said you know what I don't know maybe she was tempted say you know what's the use look at what they're doing look at how they're doing look at their attitude look at how they're dressing look at how they're doing look at way they're come to church look at way you know but you know what this is what the prophet of God said and I'm sure we all get discouraged don't we how can I overcome 1963 we're sometimes tempted to go back he said many you tempted go back to the denomination go back and take up CU all the world say what denomination you belong to what church you affiliated with we're tempted to do that this is 1963 how can I overcome he said we're tempted to do that all of us are our sisters are tempted to go back go back and join up with some of the rest of the churches with some of the assemblies Churches of God or some of them still be Pentecostal let your hair cut off and dress about any way you want to see you're tempted to do that go back and be popular with this wicked generation that we're living in when this is the major sin of our days it's it's the major sin among our people worldliness as the bride said the C she was worldly Rich had need of nothing don't know what she don't know that she's naked miserable wretched and blind that's the sin of our day when you hear the word of God call out against it then you take the other route you're unpopular with the world you're tempted to go back so imagine Esther she might have been cuz everybody else said Ma you ain't going to be popular Esther but she said that's all right I want to do what pleases the king Hallelujah whatever pleases him that's what I want to do this morning amen I don't care what anybody else says how I'm poer it may be I po I may not be or whatever I may not be in who's who this mag hey but I just want to be popular with him amen I wonder what pleases him Hallelujah Esther she didn't Adorn herself of the world of the world of anything of the world what they wanted but she adorned herself in a Meek and humble Spirit a Christlike Spirit adoring herself with the fruits of the spirit Galatians 5:22 if you want to turn there we ain't going to read it but fruits of the spirit what is it love joy Faith peace long suffering amen meance amen a Meek and humble spirit amen she purged her heart God helped me to purge my heart this morning she took the spirit in her heart that's what I want to do this morning amen Purge my heart Purge me Lord from everything that's not like you this morning just take everything away if I got a bad temper take it away whatever it is Lord just take it away Lord Jesus Purge me I got big willing to be purged cu the scripture says she has made herself ready I got to be willing to say Lord Purge me amen and she took the spirit in her heart sometimes we want the biggest church well if ain't the biggest church I ain't going to go to it if it ain't this I ain't going to go to it if it

it is see estra made herself ready she laid aside all these things she was accepted the rest were rejected brother Brandon says like this the same on marriage of the Lamb he said the same way it is about Divine Healing God's got the power to heal you if you got the courage to accept it but you'll fight every inch of the way God's got Amazing Grace to save you and he will do it but you fight every inch of the way I've been behind this pull bit going on 31 years and every inch of that has been a fight constantly it certainly has but we got to fight if we must rain so we must find that the bride has made herself ready be be willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience that race that is set before us we must keep them uh uh we must lay them aside ourself we can't say God you come lay them aside for us we must do that ourselves that's do it ourselves then say God help me whatever it takes Lord let me light everything she she was accepted and the rest of the women was rejected because she was willing to lay everything aside what about me and you if we're born again this morning willing to lay everything inside that we are be chosen the others they'll be rejected BR said it like this 1960 Revelations chapter 4 po Charlie Nell know you said just what we're talking about down there in Rodney the other day see when elishah throw the Garment upon Elijah oh Elijah put it upon Elisha he reached back took it off again put it on himself walked with it on him till he crossed the Jordan went on the mountain and got up in the

sanctify himself from unclean habits ly inside every weight making herself ready the bride has made herself ready again from that time 1962 so I'm just making my decision I'm saying right now from now

brother random is wrapping up the sermon and he says shall we bow our heads Heavenly Father oh God with my heart turning around and around it seems knowing that you're here see you move out over this audience in a form of a Big Bright Light speaking Visions breaking forth knowing that the time is at hand right now soon you shall send Jesus again and he will come to this earth no man knoweth the minute or hour not even even the angels but the father only and here he comes to the Earth again time way past due like it was in the days of Noah the long suffering when the ark was being prepared wherein seven Souls were saved or eight now today his coming is way past due way overdue should have been here a long time ago but God's not willing that any should perish but that all might come to repentance it was a few weeks back maybe even a month or more now I was ministering and I was talking about the woman that had lost her coin and she had to sweep the house to find it and talking about how that those coins were actually part of a uh a piece of jewelry that she would wear and it was normally given to the bride before the wedding it was one of the first wedding gifts that she got and when you look up the history about it that says that whenever she would be having time where she was thinking about the groom she was supposed to be ising those coins and so when the wedding day came the more shiny the more that was recognized that she had been thinking about her groom she had been thinking about the one that was coming and brother ROM talked about how those coins are the different fruits of the spirit that we have in our life and are we going through and polishing those things when Brother David was talking about are we the bride hath made herself ready how are we spending all of our time doing those are we are we in that place where our heart is continually thinking towards the groom and that that's where our desire is that's where our focus is we know we live in a world where we have to go to work and we have to provide we have to go and do this we have to go and do that but is our desire continually going we just want the groom to be here we just want to be with him we just want to be in his presence I can think back to before my wife and I were married when we would be calling each other every evening and sometimes we didn't even have anything to say sometimes there wasn't a whole lot to say other than say over and over I miss you I miss you people would have laughed if they had been listening to conversations because we would just be saying that kind of over and over to each other other times we'd have good conversations but that desire to just be she was in one state I was in another and all we wanted to do was just to be together but yet it's so easy for us to get distracted from that even today 19 years later my wife still hates the game of Monopoly because I got together with the youth one night during the time we were engaged and we got wrapped up in a game of Monopoly and I didn't call her that night because I was so busy spending time with youth and playing this game of Monopoly and even today my wife will say she hates the game of Monopoly because it distracted me from her it distracted me from paying attention to her at that time and when we're when the scriptures say the bride hath made herself ready we have to throw aside those distractions we have to throw aside those games of Monopoly that are in our life that they may not even the things that they may not be wrong there's nothing wrong with playing a game of Monopoly there's nothing wrong with doing this or doing that but even Beyond cleaning the sin cleaning out those distractions that make us think about other things around us that make us get wrapped up in other things when God is wanting the focus to be completely on him the bride hath made herself ready she have polished everything up just right she's clothed herself in the right garment she prepared herself to be just what God wants her to be that's the place that we're at and that's the place that we have to keep ourselves being from being distracted from I thought that was a really good service this morning I really enjoyed Brother David we want to make sure that we're praying for him that he gets rested out because he is on the hot seat again tonight he gets to to minister again so pray the Lord will give him a a little bit of rest this afternoon to be ready for the service um brother ml what would be a good song to wrap up [Music] with rise rise above it all I'm going to rise rise rise above it all I'm going to spread my wings and fly away to heaven I'm going to rise above it all I'm going to rise rise Rise Above It All I'm going to rise rise rise above it all I'm
