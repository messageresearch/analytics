[Music] I really want to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire this evening to see Jesus? Amen. I enjoyed that. My God is tremendous. when I'm in need. [Music] All right, let's start over.

Jesus, lion of Judah. Our God is tremendous. The strength never failth. He goes through the fire just to save a sinner. He is almighty. He sends his angels to guide me. [Music] There's no storm too powerful. Our God cannot handle. Our God is in bliss. He revealed in you and me. Came down from his glory and gave us the victory. The greatest love story. When you're in trouble, Jehovah Nissi, the great forcer, God Almighty, will fight your battles. Oh yes, he'll stand for you. [Applause] Your victory will come, but not the way you think it should.

Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Oh Sat's life a roaring line rolling to and fro seeking who he may. The Bible tells us so. And many souls have been its prey to fall at some weak hour. But God has promised us today. His overcoming power. Oh now greater is he. God is greater. My God is greater that is in me than he that is in me. On the day of Pentecost and on the day of Pentecost, a rushing mighty wind. It blew into the upper room and baptized all of them. Oh, now with the power gater than any earthly foe. And I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm going to let the whole world know. Oh, God is greater. So much greater. Oh, he's gater. that is in me than he that is in without music now sing it. Oh now gater is he that is in me. &gt;&gt; Greater is he. Do you believe it tonight? Oh gater is he that is in me than he that once again now. Oh gater. [Music] Oh gater. He's greater. Oh greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Oh my. Do you believe that tonight? Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Greater is he. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Now, if you have your Bibles, like to turn to Revelations 1 and 18. It is good to see Brother Robert and Sister Brianna back with us here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Definitely had y'all in our thoughts and prayers and um enjoyed Annalina's song as well. And &gt;&gt; honestly, I am surprised to see Grandma here tonight, but it's good to see you. We definitely had you in our prayers. Um so, I'm glad everything went well. Amen. Do you love him here tonight? Amen. Now, I don't know how Brother Josh got out of preaching tonight. You know, usually when he's here, he needs to be preaching, but you guys got to hear me tonight. So, I pray we can say something that would be a help. But Revelations 1 and and 18 says, "I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold, I am alive forever more." Amen. &gt;&gt; And have the keys of hell and of death. Gracious heavenly father, how we love you here tonight. And it's it's it's an honor to be here, Lord, and appreciate the your presence that we felt and the the songs of praise and worship that has come out from your people tonight. I pray, Lord, that you'll bless each one of them. Bless the word here tonight. Father, may there be something that will be said that will be a help and a benefit to each one of them here tonight. We love you, Lord. In your precious name, we pray. Amen. You may be seated here tonight. And if I had a a a simple title, I you know, I'm used to speaking to the youth on Tuesday night. So tonight, it's going to be simple. So you can just turn to your neighbor and say, "I don't care how old you are. You're youth tonight. You're all youth." So we're going to keep it simple. Amen. Yeah. Brother Torrance is is youth tonight. Amen. But if I had a simple title, it would be to the victor goes the spoils. And we see I seen this here. It says to the victory goes the spoils is a proverb. Meaning the winner of a conflict, a competition or a struggle is entitled to the rewards and prizes or benefits that come with that victory. And we see here in our scripture reading, he says that I am he that liveth and was dead and behold, I am alive forever more and have the keys of death and hell. And and I want to declare here tonight that Jesus is our victorious king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not serving a a dead God, but we have a God that has risen from the dead &gt;&gt; and has power and dominion over every enemy that we have here tonight. But when he rose from the grave, he didn't come out empty-handed. He came out with something that declared his power over darkness. He took the keys of death and hell and the grave to show that he has the power. And Satan no longer has dominion over humanity. But God has dominion. God has power. Satan has no control over you anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he did it for you and I that we may walk in a newness of life and that we may share his victory. &gt;&gt; That we can stand up and boldly declare that death where is thy sting and grave where is thy victory? &gt;&gt; We can say that here tonight because the same power that raised Christ from the dead &gt;&gt; if it dwelled in you it will quicken &gt;&gt; your mortal bodies. &gt;&gt; And do you believe that you're part of Christ tonight? Do you believe that you're part of Christ tonight? Then you have the same authority that Christ has. &gt;&gt; So we can say this death where is thy sting and grave where is thy victory because we stand in confidence that we can overcome it as well. &gt;&gt; Now when I say to the victor goes the spoils I I want you to imagine a a boxer fighting in the championship round. dead. &gt;&gt; They say that a championship round goes for 12 rounds. And and how you win is either achieve a a knockout, which is a KO, or a technical knockout, which is a TKO, or by points scored by the judges. And we see at the end of it all, whether it was a KO or or a TKO or he made it all the way to to the 12 rounds and the judges by score declare that he's the champion, the champion is now standing in the middle of the ring hoisting a belt, &gt;&gt; showing that he just defeated his opponent &gt;&gt; and the announcer hands hands him the the championship belt. It is proof of his victory. Now he gets the spoils of that victory. He gets the belt. He gets the money. He gets the prestige. He gets the recognition that he is a champion boxer. &gt;&gt; No one can ever take that from him. He is a champion. And let me say this here tonight that Jesus didn't defeat his opponent in in a stadium with spotlights. But he defeated the greatest foe that was ever out through sin and death on the cross of Calvary in a tomb that could not hold him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he stepped into the throne of heaven, belted hand, saying, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. Brother Brenham says here, "He went through the valley of the shadow of death and caught every dart of the devil &gt;&gt; and pulled it into his bosom and called for the church to take what you've got and do the best that you can." Praise God. He says, "On the day of Pentecost, a rushing mighty wind fell out of the heavens above and armed every man." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And every woman, every boy, I'm adding that there. And every girl with a weapon. And he says, "I'll say today, my brethren, that every man, whatever you got, let's do the best we can with it. Fight to the last man because we've got the enemy's lines broke." He says Christ defeated Satan, stripped him of everything he ever had. He is nothing but a bluff. When he tells you we cannot have another old-fashioned Holy Ghost outpouring of the spirit, we can have it today because the lines of the enemy has been broken and God rules and reigns today. &gt;&gt; We are fighting a defeated foe. &gt;&gt; Say that with me. We are defing a defeated foe. &gt;&gt; Then how in the world are we cowarding down to a defeated foe here tonight? I don't care what you're facing. &gt;&gt; It may look like the obstacle is the biggest thing you've ever seen in your life. Remember this. You are fighting a defeated foe here tonight. And if God had the power to overcome the enemy, you have the same power. &gt;&gt; You have the same authority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see the the spoils the the reward of Jesus's victory was not just for himself. Now in ancient times a king would conquer another kingdom and receive their land's treasure and their prisoners and of war all their wealth. So we see when Jesus conquered the dominion of darkness, he ransomed the lost souls. &gt;&gt; He took everybody that was in the grip of Satan and he ransomed them unto himself. and he took the keys. &gt;&gt; What jail cell are you in here tonight? &gt;&gt; Jesus has the keys. &gt;&gt; Satan no longer can keep you there because Christ has the keys. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you and I can walk in victory because the King of Kings has the keys here tonight. &gt;&gt; There's no jail cell. There's no prison bars that can keep you. You're free here tonight. Satan wants to keep you bound with the fake bars. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. And if we don't realize what Christ has done for us, we will stay behind those fake bars. &gt;&gt; We'll be like Johnny Crow having our bonds cut. But we've been so used to being in that condition year after year, month after month, day after day that we're staying there of our own accord. &gt;&gt; The bonds have been cut. Come on. &gt;&gt; The rope has been cut. You're free to walk out. The door to your jail cell is open. It's no longer shut. You're no longer bound. You're free. &gt;&gt; The only way you can stay in captivity is by your own accord. &gt;&gt; If Satan can blind your eyes here tonight to make you think this is who you are, to make you think that you can never be to get over this addiction and make you think this is all you're ever going to be. You're going to stay in that condition. But if you can listen to Christ's voice that says, "He who the son sets free is free indeed." You can walk out of that jail cell. &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Kobe, that's simple." &gt;&gt; But it's true. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We need to realize that Jesus' victory has now become our victory. Yes. &gt;&gt; When we fail to see the victory that Christ had for us, &gt;&gt; we begin to live beneath our privileges, &gt;&gt; okay? &gt;&gt; We'll struggle when we should be walking in peace and we'll mop when we should be shouting the praises of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; Bear with me as I build a foundation here tonight. like to go back to the Garden of Eden for just a minute in the fall. And we see that humanity, they needed to be rescued &gt;&gt; when Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of Eden. But we understand that the conflict did not just start in the Garden of Eden, &gt;&gt; but it started in heaven. &gt;&gt; And because of this war that raised between the devil and God, Satan was kicked out with a third of the angels. And then he brought this war to earth. &gt;&gt; And when the serpent deceived Adam and Eve, sin entered into the world. It it bringing spiritual death and and separation from God. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; I know we've heard all this before, so just bear with me here tonight. and and men fell from from eternal innocence into a state of sinfulness and which opened the door to the devil and his lies and his ability to bind the children of God. And in that moment of disobedience, it was then that Adam handed over the keys of dominion that God entrusted to him. And remember, God did say in Genesis 1:26, "Let us make man in our image and and and let them have dominion." And that dominion was ours. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? But when we sinned, we forfeited it and handed the devil a legal right to rule over followers humanity. I hope this is okay tonight. So the devil bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo boasted about having authority over the earth. &gt;&gt; But he overlooked one major factor. God had a redemption plan. &gt;&gt; Satan thought when he caused the fall of man that the fall out out of a garden of perfection. &gt;&gt; He thought when he caused God's children to fall that he had pulled one over God. and he thought there's no way that God can ever get them out of this condition. But remember, God knows all things. &gt;&gt; And God knows the end from the beginning. And God seeing the fall of man. And God already had a lamb slain before the foundation of the world. God had a redemptive plan. &gt;&gt; God wasn't going to let you stay in that state that you were in. God wasn't going to let you stay in the torments and the binds of the devil. He had a plan. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God wasn't caught off guard. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank God for that. &gt;&gt; God wasn't caught off guard when Adam and Eve fell. &gt;&gt; He wasn't pacing heaven thinking, "Oh my, how did this happen?" You see, in the same chapter when when man fell, &gt;&gt; Yeah. God promised in Genesis 3:15 that the seed of a woman &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; would bruise the head of the serpent. &gt;&gt; That God had a plan. Oh my. And from the moment humanity's eyes was open to sin, God set in motion a a plan that would bring forth a deliverer. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for that. Oh my. looking at my life and what I've been through and what I've done. I think I'm thankful to God every day that he had a plan. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That he wasn't going to leave you in that condition. &gt;&gt; So, we see the plan of God was put into motion. &gt;&gt; And we look at Noah's arc, a picture of salvation from judgment. &gt;&gt; Hope that's okay. And &gt;&gt; the Passover lamb, it's deliverance by the blood of a spotless lamb. man, the tabernacle, a foreshadowing of atonement, and God's dwelling among his people. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus finally came on the scene, the angels announced in Luke 21:14, "Glory to God in the highest stand, and on earth peace, goodwill to towards men, &gt;&gt; and all of heaven recognized that the victor had arrived to wage war against sin and the devil and reclaim authority that Adam had lost." The angels knew. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The angels knew when they came down they were they were so excited that they would see this that the power of sin destroyed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we see when Jesus was nailed to the cross. I'm trying to hurry through this. &gt;&gt; He wasn't just a victim of Roman cruelty or or Jewish leaders uh uh jealousy. He was the lamb of God laying down his life &gt;&gt; as a final sacrifice. Colossians 2:14 would describe it this way. Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us &gt;&gt; and took it out of the way, nailing it to the cross and having spoiled principalities &gt;&gt; and powers. He made a show of them openly triumphing over them. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When God set this plan into motion, he knew &gt;&gt; that he would not fail. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; there's a lot of things that I I I I uh can't do with my life. And there's a lot of times I go into situations knowing I'm probably going to fail. &gt;&gt; God didn't go into this situation thinking he was going to fail. Come on. &gt;&gt; When God put this plan into motion, Brother Patrick, God went in as someone that was confident that he was going to overcome. &gt;&gt; So, I love this phrase, make a show of them openly. &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay. &gt;&gt; It means not on the cross that that Jesus did more than just quietly win. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He took the devil's entire demonic host and lined them up and paraded them as defeated &gt;&gt; before heaven and earth, &gt;&gt; showing the people. &gt;&gt; That this thing that has held you bound for year after year after year has no power over you any longer. You say this is simple. Hear me out. Satan tonight has no authority over your life. &gt;&gt; You see, I can't give up this addiction. Well, I know a conqueror that has never been defeated. &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is call on the name of Jesus, and he will help you overcome it. &gt;&gt; But picture a victorious king leading captives down Main Street for everyone to see. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's what Jesus did with all the spiritual forces arrayed against you and I. He showed them up, took their authority, took the keys to the prison and said, "Now your hold over mankind is broken." &gt;&gt; The rule that Satan had over humanity for thousands and thousands of years was broken. &gt;&gt; Now think about it. Of course, if Jesus had died and not risen, then every all of this plan would have been in vain. &gt;&gt; We would still be in trouble. &gt;&gt; Death from the days of Adam had an unbreakable grip on humanity and everybody died. The Old Testament fathers passed away. The the prophets died. The the kings died. Righteous men and unrighteous alike passed. All ended up in the grave. But when Jesus came up on the scene, he wasn't just a man. &gt;&gt; He was God in a human body. &gt;&gt; So Jesus changed the script. &gt;&gt; He wasn't going to stay in the grave like every other man had before. &gt;&gt; What would be the purpose of Jesus coming to die if he would stay in the ground like every other man? &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. But Jesus had to show that he had power over death, hell, and the grave. The Bible says in Matthew 28:2, it tells us there was a great earthquake. &gt;&gt; And the angel rolled the stone away, revealing that Jesus was no longer in the tomb. Let me say this. Jesus didn't just crawl out. &gt;&gt; He wasn't battered and nearly dead. He walked out fully alive and victorious. Our captain is not someone that has barely won. At the end of the match, people are are are wondering who won this match. No, I when it was all said and done, not one demon in hell had to wonder. They knew. &gt;&gt; They knew that this is not just a man, &gt;&gt; but this is God in flesh. When he rose from the grave, they knew. &gt;&gt; Listen, folks. Our captain is the champion of champions. &gt;&gt; He's never lost the battle. He is the Lord mighty. I said mighty in battle. &gt;&gt; I know this is simple, but what I've come to do here today is to build your faith a little bit. Knowing that on your worst days, you got a captain that has never failed. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you feel overwhelmed and you feel surrounded, remember the presence of God is always there, &gt;&gt; you're never alone. I love that song. When it when it looks like I'm surrounded, I'm surrounded by him because it is so true. On the days you feel alone &gt;&gt; and you feel discouraged and the sickness is in your body and you don't feel like you can make it through, remember &gt;&gt; Yeah. The presence of God is always there. &gt;&gt; He never leaves. He never forsakes. &gt;&gt; They say in the Bible days when a king would defeat another king in his kingdom that they would go in and cut the robe off of the defeated king. And the the king that won would take that robe and it would tie it to his own, &gt;&gt; showing that he defeated this king and how mighty in battle this king is. And &gt;&gt; so when a king would come into his his his throne room, they would look at the robe that this king had. And however long the train of this king was shows how powerful this king is. Isaiah 6:1 says, "In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train &gt;&gt; his robe &gt;&gt; filled the temple. &gt;&gt; He was so powerful, &gt;&gt; so strong, so mighty in battle that is trained &gt;&gt; that is trained." showing that he has never been defeated &gt;&gt; and he never will. Here tonight, &gt;&gt; his train filled the temple. Oh my, what a sight that would have been. &gt;&gt; To see a king walk out with maybe 10, 12 robes saying, "My, what a powerful king." But oh to be Uzziah and to say that his train filled the temple. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; When he rose from the grave, he made an open statement &gt;&gt; that I have the keys of hell and of death here tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; as I continue on, the last fear that has paralyzed humanity is the fear of death. &gt;&gt; But when Christ rose from the grave, death lost his grip on humanity. &gt;&gt; He robbed the grave of its victory. And the sting of death was neutralized by the power of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear death. &gt;&gt; We don't have to be afraid of death. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you love him here tonight? &gt;&gt; But we see that Jesus has the keys to death, hell. &gt;&gt; And the grave. And if I can say this here tonight that one of the greatest problems that the church has today, it is so worried about the enemy that is present with them that they forget who's fighting for them. &gt;&gt; We get so worried about the obstacle that we're facing right in our present time at the moment in life right there that we forget who is fighting for us. We can look at the children of Israel and see them get to the Red Sea. What happened? They begin to complain. &gt;&gt; They they said, "Did you bring us out here to die?" They forgot the miracles &gt;&gt; that God just brought them out of Egypt with. &gt;&gt; We get so worried about the finances that we're dealing with and the the sickness and depression, oppression, whatever it may be. Everyone's different here tonight. Whatever you face, we get so bombarded and overwhelmed with the circumstance that we forget the God that fights for us. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Kobe, this giant is too big and these walls are too thick and the spirit is too powerful." Brother Brenham says here, "You got to get determined." &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right. Get ready. Take over." God said, "Let's take over." Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what God wanted us to do. That's what God wants us to do tonight. God's always willing to give us if you're ready to receive it. That's right. God's made the promise, so it's ours. &gt;&gt; God made the promise, so it's ours. The promise is unto you and to your children, and to them that's a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. So the promise is here. This is a a lengthy quote, so just bear with me. &gt;&gt; Jesus or Joshua and Caleb when they went over, I like the thought there. &gt;&gt; When they came over, the 10 came back and said, "Oh, we look like grasshoppers up the side of them." &gt;&gt; And Joshua and Caleb says, "We can do it." That's right. Why? Because God promised that we can do it. God says we can do it. God promised our fathers that we was going. there was a land that belonged to us. No matter if they got walt cities, they look like giants and everything else. He quit looking at the giants. I think that's something we need to do. Quit looking at the giants, he says, and start looking at God's word. &gt;&gt; And when men and women quit looking at their sickness and their diseases and start looking to what God said about it, you will take over. He says, "Amen." All things are subject to Jesus Christ. All things are subject to you in prayer, he says, when you ask in his name and believe it. Amen. Ask what you will in my name and it shall be done. He said, that's right. Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe it and you shall receive it and you shall have it. God said so. So let nothing stand in your way. Stop looking at the things you're looking at here. Look to the unseen. God said we can do it. &gt;&gt; Are you thankful for that here tonight? &gt;&gt; God said it and I believe it. &gt;&gt; That should settle the questions in your mind. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But looking at these keys for just a minute as we try to wrap this up. I'm not going to keep you long here tonight. But keys mean authority. &gt;&gt; Now look this up. says in the ancient world possessing the keys meant you have the right to lock or unlock to bind or to release. So when scripture says that Jesus holds the keys to hell and death it means Satan no longer calls the shots. &gt;&gt; Hello somebody. &gt;&gt; Satan no longer calls the shots. We don't have to remain locked in sin. We don't have to remain attained to addiction. And we certainly don't have to fear the grave. &gt;&gt; It means the one who lives forever has the power to set the captives free here tonight. Oh, thank God for that. I was bound, &gt;&gt; but thank God he set me free. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Jesus didn't just conquer the devil. He ransomed us. &gt;&gt; He paid the price for us. All right. &gt;&gt; Think of a person kidnapped by by bandits and and no matter how strong that person is, they they can't easily free themselves and they needed a rescuer, someone who was willing to come and pay the price &gt;&gt; to take them out of the chains that they were in. And you look at what God did for us. He ransomed us with his precious blood. &gt;&gt; All right? Satan thought humanity was forever bound to him after the fall. But Jesus through his blood purchased us back, closing the chasm that was between God and man. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's why I love to sing songs like He set me free. Because it's not just a pretty tune, but it's a reality &gt;&gt; that he set me free. &gt;&gt; That we've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb. And devil, you can't have me anymore. You have no clay because you have no keys. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead, if it dwells in you, what is that? Romans 8:11. That it will quicken your mortal bodies. that Holy Ghost power. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That resurrection power that's inside of you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Think about that for a minute. God didn't give us a a a a a mild improvement of what he had. &gt;&gt; God gave us something that has stood the test of time. &gt;&gt; And what God used to defeat the devil, he gave the same thing to us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We look at warfare. Imagine, brother Merl using World War I uh uh uh weapons to fight today's war. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't work. It's like I think brother Michael showed us a video of Afghanistan or some guys over there shooting tanks with machine guns. &gt;&gt; What is that going to do? &gt;&gt; It does nothing. And that's like us trying in our own ability against Satan's tactics. us coming up with our machine guns when he has a take. &gt;&gt; But remember, when you align your life up with God &gt;&gt; and you take the power of God, you no longer just have a take, but you got an atomic bomb. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that he gave us the greatest weapon that we could ever ask for. That was his word. It doesn't need improve me. Improving. &gt;&gt; It doesn't need to be modified. If it was good for Christ 2,000 years ago, it's good for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it. If we can just realize who we are here tonight &gt;&gt; and the power that lays inside of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could just get to a place as individuals, as a church to see what God can do with a unified body, think about what God can do for a unified church. &gt;&gt; That gets under the headship of God and aligns themsself with his word. &gt;&gt; Think about the power. Oh my goodness. Healings can happen and deliverances can happen. Addictions can be broken. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your children could be set free. &gt;&gt; Your children could be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Sinners can walk off the street and be set free by the power of God. &gt;&gt; That's what Satan's afraid of is a unified body. &gt;&gt; That's why he tries to put division and keep us pulled apart. He knows if the bride can just unify themselves under the word and the message that was brought, &gt;&gt; you can shake the gates of hell with your prayers. &gt;&gt; You step out of bed, Satan ought to tremble. &gt;&gt; Satan ought to be scared &gt;&gt; of the power that you possess. &gt;&gt; That's why he don't want you recognizing who you are. If he keep you blind to the world and its pleasures and the addiction and keep you blind to being satisfied to just go to church and keep you blind with reading your Bible once a month, he's okay with that. &gt;&gt; He's okay with that. He don't mind you going to church and he don't mind you listening to the prophet maybe once a month and he don't mind you reading your Bible every now and then. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; He don't mind you living in a state of lukewarmness. He doesn't care. He don't mind. But when you begin to look into the scriptures and and listen to the message for yourself and when you really begin to recognize who you are, &gt;&gt; Satan begins to take notice them. &gt;&gt; He didn't care before. You were like everybody else. &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh my We all want victory and I'm almost done. &gt;&gt; But every victory comes costs. &gt;&gt; There are obstacles that we have to overcome. We got to overcome fear and doubt. &gt;&gt; We got to overcome the struggles of life. We got to overcome any any sin that can easily beset us. &gt;&gt; We We've got to overcome the not understanding who we are. And we got to overcome lukewarmness. &gt;&gt; We got to overcome being content in the condition that we're in. &gt;&gt; There's obstacles to victory. As I've said before, I I'll probably wear this out, but anything worth having is worth fighting for. &gt;&gt; You want the Holy Ghost? You really think it's going to be that easy? &gt;&gt; You really think Satan is going to make it easy on you? &gt;&gt; I mean, it's easy. Christ already paid the price. You accept it. But getting our mind in that condition and trying to push everything out. &gt;&gt; Do you realize? Have you seen when you try to get down to pray and read your Bible and listen to a message, how your mind just becomes all cluttered? &gt;&gt; You begin to think of things that you have to do tomorrow and have to do right now and oh man, I need to get up. Did I forget to take the pot off the the oven or did I turn the water off or did I do this? Did I do that? Did I did I do this at the job? our mind becomes so cluttered &gt;&gt; because Satan knows if you can get into true prayer &gt;&gt; into true prayer &gt;&gt; where it's more than just words &gt;&gt; but you've stepped from this dimension into another where you're in the presence of God if he knows &gt;&gt; that's why he he makes it so difficult &gt;&gt; because he knows Satan's smart. Satan knows. &gt;&gt; But in all of the aspects of life, we got someone that's already overcame for you. &gt;&gt; Fear and doubt. Too many believers live in fear. Fear of failure and fear of the unknown and fear that God won't come through. Yet the Bible says, "God hath not given us &gt;&gt; a spirit of fear, &gt;&gt; but of power and of love and of a sound mind." Amen. &gt;&gt; In a world where people are losing their mind, as Dan was talking about the other day, the rise of of of mental illness, &gt;&gt; God promised that in the midst of this, I will give you a sound mind. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; we don't have to fear losing our children to the world. &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear losing our our families to the grips of the devil. We don't have to fear &gt;&gt; in this world where Satan has it his way. We can live in a state of peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why it's so important. I remember growing up and with with with addictions and things that I was faced and dad always took us back to scripture because anything that you deal with in life there is a scripture pertaining to that. There's nothing new under the sun. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So any obstacle that you have in your life there is a word to help you overcome it. growing up and dealing with addictions in life, dad would always have us go back and look up. If it was lying, look, look up all the scriptures on lying. Man, if it was stealing, look up all the scriptures on stealing. If it was lust, whatever it was, get into the word. I was talking to the young people last night. I was telling them, align yourself up with the word. &gt;&gt; How are you going to align yourself up with something that you have no clue what is it about? &gt;&gt; That's true. If you have no idea what this word is, how are you going to overcome? &gt;&gt; How are you going to align yourself with the scriptures that's pertaining to you? If you have no idea what this book says, &gt;&gt; but we must align our thoughts, &gt;&gt; our our our priorities, everything up with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in the time of your need, in the time of your crisis, God will bring back to the remembrance the words of power. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I hope that's okay. &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. I &gt;&gt; been up here for 45 minutes. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to keep you long tonight. But another thing that we must overcome is lukewarmness. &gt;&gt; Believers getting complacent. &gt;&gt; Hope that's okay. We stop praying as as much as we need to and we get in a state to where we're okay where we're at. &gt;&gt; God does not want you being content where you're at. &gt;&gt; If you're in a walk with the Lord, you're always moving higher &gt;&gt; and higher and higher. When you feel yourself stall, that's not God. &gt;&gt; That's the devil trying to make you happy where you're at. All right. &gt;&gt; But remember, with God, we're always moving up &gt;&gt; until one day we're going to leave this earth. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; my goodness. I better stop here. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Do you love him here tonight? &gt;&gt; Skip through some of this here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. you love him. &gt;&gt; So the to the victor goes the spoils. Give me a few more minutes. We see with David and Goliath. After David slew the Goliath, Israel gained the spoils of the Philistines and David's boldness in God brought victory. See Jehoshaphat. When Judah faced an impossible circumstance, they began to worship the Lord and God set traps and the enemy armies destroyed each other. And Judah found so much spoil it took them three days &gt;&gt; to collect it all. We see Paul and Silas in Acts 16 that they were beaten and imprisoned and and put in stalks. But at midnight they prayed and sang praises and an earthquake loosened every prisoner's chains and the jailer got saved. &gt;&gt; The spoils of that victory included souls added to the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every victory that you face, there spoils with that. All right. &gt;&gt; Every victory that you overcome or every obstacle you overcome, there's spoils that go with that victory. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, people say that, you know, Bible times, they're different. And and we're in a modern time. We're in a modern society. And people aren't interested in the gospel anymore. And the days of miracles have passed. &gt;&gt; Do we serve a dead God or a live God here tonight? Do we serve a God that has failed or has never failed? &gt;&gt; Do we serve a God that says, "I am God and I change not." &gt;&gt; The same power &gt;&gt; that was there in &gt;&gt; in the book of Acts is the same power today. Let the devil say the days of miracles have passed. I really don't care. The same power &gt;&gt; that Christ had then the bride has today. He has restored that authority to you again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And with victory, our spoils come in the form of lives, families restored, and miracles taking place and and seeing people set free and having your joy restored again. &gt;&gt; Oh my, one day we'll be We be before the throne of Christ and laying our crowns down. One day all the fighting that we have faced in our life will finally be home. The final victory over the devil as the musicians come now. Don't give up. Don't give up. Don't get discouraged. You say, "Brother Colobby, I feel like I've I'm losing more battles than winning right now." Maybe you're thinking, "Preacher, I've heard you talk about the victories and but my life is a mess and my family's maybe in disarray or my my bills have this how I feel most of the time. I got more bills than money. The bills are piling up. I'm dealing with sickness and and anger and depression." Remember, the devil wants to isolate you, make you feel that you're alone and that no one cares. We was talking at brother Robert's house a few weeks back and talking about isolation and what pride will do to a person. Humanity can get so proud that they would rather deal with the situation alone than ask for help. And Satan, if he can get you isolated, thinking that no one cares and that no one can relate to you and and that that that that you're alone, &gt;&gt; Satan will whoop you if he can get you isolated. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in Hebrews 13 and5 that I will never leave thee. Oh, thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Nor will I forsake you. Remind the devil tonight if he's trying to isolate you. Remind him and say you don't have the keys anymore. &gt;&gt; That you don't have the keys anymore. That Jesus Christ does. So that means the jail cell of discouragement can't keep you locked in forever. &gt;&gt; The jail cell of isolation cannot keep you locked forever. Satan has opened every door. I mean, Jesus has opened every door here tonight. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is walk out. &gt;&gt; Walk out in freedom. &gt;&gt; See, Lord, I I don't know what we're facing tonight. I know what I face, what I deal with, how the struggles of life can be real. Just so glad that through it all, thinking of that song that grandpa and grandma sing for years. Through it all, we got someone that we can depend upon. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. And when the battle's over, when the battle's over, we should wear a crown here tonight. Gracious heavenly father, I know this was simple. But Lord, this is what you placed on my heart here tonight that we're in a war and a battle for our life and a battle for our families, the battle for our spouses and children, Lord, and and the battle, Lord, for the young people. a battle, Lord, where Satan's trying to divide and isolate us, Lord. Making the young people just feel all alone, making the elders and the adults, myself included. Lord, there's been times he's whispered, "You're just all alone and to isolate us. But Lord, we're in a battle. Father, you've overcame everything that we go through in life. And you opened up the jail cells for everyone here. Whatever we're facing, depression, lust, pornography, isolation, sickness in the body, or maybe in the mind, Lord, or whatever it is, a homosexual spirit, Lord, I don't know what we're facing, but Lord, you do. I pray that your spirit comes down tonight and opens every cell, Lord, and let them know that they don't have to stay in that prison, but you've broke every chain and you got the keys tonight to whatever they're facing. Lord, uplift the feeble tonight, Lord. the ones that have been fighting sickness. Father, I can only imagine, Lord, how the devil's plaguing grandpa and and Lord, Uncle Donald, Aunt Angie, Lord, Angie Bendabout, the ones McDougall, Lord, the ones that have been fighting these these battles for so long. I pray you lift them up, Lord. Don't let the devil plague their mind, but Father, lift up their hands and let them know that you've overcome every enemy tonight. We love you, Lord. Thank you for your mercy and goodness. Thank you, Father, for never leaving us alone. We love you, Lord. In your precious and lovely name, we pray. We've been made more than coner [Music] overs in this life. Oh, we've been made victorious. [Music] The blood of Jesus Christ. We've made Oh, we've been made more than coner. Yes, we have. Overcomers in this day. We've been made and we've been made victorious through the blood of Jesus. Can we go up another key? We've been made We've been made more than coner. Is that your confession tonight? Overcomers in this life. [Music] Oh, we've been made victorious through the blood of Jes. Verse one. Now just as Christ and trouble may come knocking at your door. Don't be afraid tonight. Don't be afraid. You know it's not like before. And don't you give in. Don't let it bring you down. You don't have to worry anymore. [Music] For we've been made more than coner, overcomeers in this life. We've been made. We've been made victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ. Hold on. and hold on. We're getting stronger every day. Yes, we are. There's no reason. There's no reason for you to go astray. Don't you lean to your own understanding. Just lean on him and we'll all save. Oh, we've been made more than coner. Thank you, Lord. Overcomers in this life. [Music] Oh, we've been made victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ. Give me your hand. [Music] Let's agree together [Music] that all of our eneies will crumble at our feet. Whatever we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven at the name of Jesus. Oh my. Satan has to flee. Oh, we've got the power in the name of Jesus. [Music] Oh, Satan raes. We cannot be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord for many years now. Satan's tried to stop that. But the bride of Jesus, she's still alive. Oh yes. Like a mighty army. We've been marching onward. Oh yes. winning every battle with the Lord. All together now. Sing it with all of your heart. The power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power [Music] in the name of the Lord. Though Satan raes, [Music] we cannot be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. [Music] Glory to God. Glory to God. Well, isn't God just wonderful to us tonight? Aren't you glad that Amen. that you get the spoils of the victory? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we need the spoils of the victory. We ought to we every time the devil comes, we He should He should lose land. Amen. Every time he comes in, I'm gaining more land, more victory, taking more spoil. Can you say amen? Well, glory to God. And aren't you glad for the Lord here tonight? Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. Uh, Brother Kobe quoted that scripture, made a show of him openly. Amen. He didn't he didn't privately win, but he made a show of it. Amen. Satan is defeated. Praise the Lord. And that's one thing that that, you know, Satan really tries to do is to isolate us and to make us think that we're the only ones that battle. We're the only ones that struggle in our minds. We're the only ones that struggle with certain parts of our of this this old nature, different different things. And and but but that's just one of his tactics. That's one of his tactics. Listen, we are all in a war. were in a war and and the Amen. So So here in this little brigade brigade here in in Pawn, Oklahoma, Amen. We're just a small portion. Uh but God's ordained us to win in this part of the country. He's ordained us to fight the devils here. And I guarantee you the devils that we're fighting here's the same kind of devils that they're fighting in Ohio or fighting in in uh I in Virginia, Arizona, wherever else. Amen. But we've got to fight in our territory. And I say we are going to fight and we are going to win. We are winning. We have won. We will win. Hallelujah. Amen. and and so uh I I think praise is so important. Amen. And and thanking God for all of his his grace upon our lives. So we enjoyed the word of the Lord here tonight. We appreciate that. I tell you what, the last the the the those last three services brother uh Josh ministered last Wednesday night, it was such an incredible blessing. And um and those that weren't here, you need to go back and listen to that. I'd encourage you to listen to all the last three. Uh uh uh well, not Sunday morning. I'm talking about Wednesday night, Sunday night, and this and this Wednesday night. I tell you what, Brother Kobe, Brother Michael, and Brother Josh, those guys have preached these last three services. They're always good preachers, but they've been really good. And I believe the Lord is preparing us for the for these meetings that are coming up. We get our get our faith get our faith up where it belongs. Listen, if you don't line up and I you know when I I was mentioning on the logos if I if now remember if you're fighting with this and and u I think it's cute watching people fight this. Well, I'm not well that's okay. Just stay defeated. But remember this must come logos. God's got it here. So if you can line this and this that that that that living word. Amen. As I've as I I had tried attempted to do the invisible God spoke. It came into that pillar of fire. It settles down into that believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you as long as you are lined up with that word, there is authority. That's the only way you have authority. That's the only way you overcome. It's not that you have authority on your own. It's that you are lined up with the present will of God and you have to win. &gt;&gt; You must win. And when we understand it is the will of God for the dead to be raised in this day. It is the will of God for rapture. It is the will of God to be healed in our minds. Amen. It is the will. just line up. Then this word becomes logos living &gt;&gt; in us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Well, God bless you. Amen. I um it's good to have it's good to have brother Robert and sister Brianna back home. And um I know they must be wore out [Applause] uh week over there. I know of such a tragic week. Um but I'm sure they were a great comfort to um Esther and the boys and and grandpa and grandma and those those over there. And so we pray God's blessings upon them. Uh brother William text me last night and said he had made it in uh uh yesterday evening. I don't know 8 or 9:00 somewhere in there. They had made it home. And so, uh, man, uh, they they had a long drive. And so, uh, so we we, um, we got a revival starting this next Thursday, or not tomorrow, a week from tomorrow. So, um, let's be in real earnest prayer. And let's do that. Let's, you know, um, really spend some take some extra time in the evening. You and your families get together. Even come down here if you wish. But but let's let's get together and and um uh however in your homes here and um just ask the Lord just start pouring our hearts out, emptying ourselves out and say, "Lord, fill me." We've got some wonderful men that are are are very gifted. These these men are have wonderful gifts in their lives. And I'm just believing the Lord is going to minister to every need that is present. How many has needs? You know, we've got to admit that we have needs and we can't talk from both sides of our mouth. We can't say, "I need help." And then refuse help when help is is is come. Amen. You you you've got to you've got to look at yourself and say, "I cannot win without God's help." &gt;&gt; Amen. And the only way he's going to help you is through his word. And so as the word is coming this week, that that word is coming as Lord, Father, I I just want you to remove everything from my mind. Remove everything from my heart. Take everything. And Lord, let your word let your word anchor in. You know, the areas you're needing. I I I just I I just believe God's going to come and walk down these aisles this week. He's going to minister to needs. He's going to meet you right at your pew. Amen. I'm expecting him to meet me at mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I sure am. And so uh I'm I'm looking forward to that. Um, so I guess everyone as as you you brothers have have looked on the uh on our on our the men the the the the guys chat and uh where we're going to be at in uh you know we've got a part to play in the uh uh in the meetings and so u you know I think to help take the trash out and to keep the tables clean and that sort of thing.
