the Parker family man we we love the Parker family huh Emma Emma Emma Kate that's it but we appreciate sister Emma Kate for being here and I've got her all red and amen praise the Lord all right let's look here at first John the first chapter with today's going to be a very wonderful day at the end of the service we're going to have a baptismal service and so we're looking forward to brother Joel Dean baptized in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're sure excited about that and today's a uh these last couple days or or special days brother Colton had a birthday yesterday and uh it slipped right under the radar amen so we say happy birthday Colton and how many loves brother Colton I remember when he was when he was first born I I was so excited and um your mama used to send me pictures of you every month I'd get a new picture you know and and we were so excited us Martins we kept up with you as you as you've grown up and so uh we sure love brother Colton and then also brother Joshua man is 25 years old today and uh we sure do love brother Josh and appreciate uh his ministry and so we say uh Happy Birthday to brother Joshua as well praise the Lord here in first John the first chapter the first verse praise the Lord that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon in our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested as we and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life that was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ I would also like to look here in in first John 5 and we'll start at the 11th verse amen first John 5 and 11 for this is the record that God has given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the son of God hath not life can you say man I'd like to read one other place and that's in Matthew the 18th chapter these are all familiar uh chapters here but verses Matthew 18 and 10. take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven amen God bless you you can be seated here this morning amen and so I want to minister uh for a few moments on a on a thought creatures of time end of Eternity amen and maybe we could uh just uh try to bring out the that there is a group of people who has been eternally represented in glory amen eternally represented you're a creature of time but you're also a creature of Eternity now we we want to look at at this at today as uh uh at a great drama Iman and uh when you have a in a drama there's there's going to be many actors there's going to be a central theme and there are going to be uh uh amen the the end product you usually have a man you've got the good you've got the bad you've got the you've got the villain amen and you've got the Savior praise the Lord and and so this morning we're wanting to look at this great drama that God has had in his mind from before the foundation of the world when I say drama I simply mean that God has had the plan from the beginning God has seen the whole scope before it has taken place his Spirit has been sent to Earth amen and he anoints uh uh men with a portion of his word for each and every age so God seen the full scope from the beginning to the end now if we believe God is God then we know that God's foreknowledge he could see amen the he could see uh uh from before creation and he knows what exactly is going to be after it is all said and done God is God and and he sees this great drama unfold amen So within the now we we within the good or within the framework of the good there are also uh three sections there's going to be the believer there's going to be the make-believer there's going to be the unbeliever and I want you to keep that in your mind for a few moments this morning now as we go through and begin to look at this drama there are some that are going to be ordained to eternal life there are some that amen uh who will never have each eternal life because Jesus Christ is the only one now the scripture says therein in First Peter 2 and 7. it says where unto you therefore which believe somebody say unto you which believe he is precious but unto them be which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has become the head of the corner a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed now as we look at the drama there are actors there are there is a scene and there's going to have to be as we begin to see this scene unfold there's got to be amen there's there's there's got to be those that are appointed to the good and there's those that are appointed to the to the to to to the bad amen now they're in Jude one and four it says for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of God into lasciviousness denying the only Lord God our Lord Jesus Christ so so we we when we as we begin to look here there there are those that are going to be eternally represented and there are those who will end up having an end and of course there's only one form of eternal life and that is the Lord Jesus Christ that is God God has eternal life there is no there is no such thing as an eternal hell there is no such thing as an eternal devil there is no such thing as an eternal fire there's only one form of eternal life and that is with God Amen now that is with God now now hell will will will will be forever and ever and if you look there in the in in your uh in the Greek it is times and times and times so we don't know when if I go for a million years uh Help Me Maybe for 10 million years but the thing is the scripture says the soul that sinneth shall surely die amen now we're not talking about there's a body and there's the soul there's the death of the body but that does not mean that the soul has died you still alive even after you die here on this Earth you're still alive and you are waiting for your uh a judgment you have either been judged by the word here amen and are waiting in Paradise we're waiting in that first Heaven waiting there for for the coming of the Lord or you will be also in waiting for your judgment at the end and the second Resurrection but this but the but the soul that sinneth shall surely die it will come to an end amen but there are souls that are eternally represented in God and those will never heaven in well I I feel really good about right now and I ain't even got started hallelujah amen this is the record amen that their life is in the sun can you say Amen now now I want us to look at this now amen there there are those that are that again that that uh have been appointed to stumble and to be disobedient Jude 1 and 4 Once Again put it back up there sister keys for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation now I would say Judas amen was part of this uh what was was part of this uh uh a group of people now Jesus called him the Son of Perdition they're in in Saint John 17 and 12. he says while I was with them in the world I gave them in thy name or I kept them in thy name and those that thou gave us me I have kept and none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled so there were scripture already spoken of Judas to come Judas was fulfilling a part of the drama that was spoken hundreds of years before and but I want you to also look Judas was a part of the good Judas was a part of the church well praise the Lord he sung songs he cast out Devils amen he done Miracles he done all of those things he was a part of the twelve he was a part of the 70. amen and when they all come back rejoicing the devils are subject to us this one's subject and that subject and Jesus is Rejoice not that the devils are subject to you but Rejoice that your name is written in heaven Judas was there a part of that group that 70 that was there and praise the Lord and the seventy left them and so did Judas well praise the name of Jesus now what is the scripture of course we understand that he was the Fulfillment of Psalms 41 and 9. yay mine own familiar or amen dear friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel Against Me Jesus in another place in John 6 and 70. Jesus answered them have not I chosen you twelve and one of you is the devil so so in this drama that we're looking amen there are those that are represented eternally in heaven well bless the name of the Lord amen now now there there is a good there is a group that the scripture says amount that art not appointed unto wrath and you look there and there's many of those scriptures but there in first Thessalonians 5 and 9 it says for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ now now as we as as I begin to set the stage here this morning I want you to understand when I say that there is a group that is eternally represented in glory I mean that you were forever in the mind of God and there is nothing the devil can do to take the eternal life away from you praise the Lord amen you have been eternally represented if you ever have eternal life you always did have eternal life for you were eternally in the thoughts of God oh that's a mouthful right there but that that should make you want to shout hallelujah amen first of all Hebrews 4 and 3 lets us know he says I want you to rest because the works have been finished from the foundation of the world Amen if you look there in Ephesians 1 and 4 it says he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the werewolf well praise the Lord if you look there in Revelations 3 and 8 it says all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world Amen look there at Revelations 21 and 27 it says and there shall in no why somebody say no wise enter into it which is talking about the city anything that defileth neither whatsoever uh worketh Abomination or maketh a lie and but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life Now I want to say here this morning that there there is no place found in the scripture to where God is just now a compiling a record of names there is no place in the scripture that says amen when when my when my brother Joel gave his heart to the Lord last Sunday night or or when he comes and gets baptized this morning that his name is put on the Lamb's Book of Life there is no scripture no evidence that a name is currently a compilation of names are currently put on on the Lamb's Book of Life today either your name was on it before the foundation of the world or it was never going to be on it praise the Lord amen now as we said the drama when we we're talking now we're talking about we're talking about uh those who's got the names on the book and we've got we're talking about those named man uh who have not that representation can you say Amen now am I am I doing all right so far here this morning amen Revelation 17 and 8 it says the Beast that thou saw us was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into Perdition they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was is not and yet is in the drama we've got the sinner we have got those who are going to be in the religious cycle and where God those that will be part of the elect well praise the Lord now you say now brother Wendell amen are you are you for certain I just want to tell you this morning that if your name is not in the book of life you will not be there in heaven that now now the scripture says there in Revelations 20 and 12 I saw the dead and small and great uh stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead was judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and the death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and and they were judged every man according to the works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire which is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast in to the Lake of Fire amen so so I I want to say here this morning we must have representation in glory well praise the Lord now I want to just sort of confuse you maybe for a moment because the Bible does say that there are some names that can come off of The Book of Life Now The Prophet uh would show us that amen that the book of life has two sections there is deception a man which has the record of immortal life it has the record also uh the second section is the Lamb's portion of the book now according to the the Mortal life the psalmist says my members were written in thy book of remembrance when as of yet there was nothing there God put some names in that book Hallelujah in that mortal life book in that book of a man your hair color and your DNA and your hey man your your complexion and and and even your events of your life God's seen it God's seen it if it is all a part of his memory at the beginning can you say Amen but now that section can have their names taken out Judas was part of that section amen now once again Judas was part of it Judas was part of uh the twelve he was part of the church now now brother Branham would say now I'm sure that you have noticed that that those names were in the uh were in The Book of Life were part of that religious order of that day that centered around the true God and and worship of him though they did not worship Him according to the truth the word and and Judas like Judas uh they didn't go all the way and now see how Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth he shared the knowledge of the Mysteries he had the ministry of power granted unto him he healed the sick cast out devils in Jesus name but when The Showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he was devoid of the spirit make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized of the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receives the fullness of the spirit and will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes fail right there and when they fail to go on in the word their names are taken off that book of life can you say amen amen now now the scripture says there and they're in in uh Revelations 22 he that would add to this word of Prophecy or take away from this book of Prophecy his name shall be taken off the Book of Life Hallelujah so there are those that are going to be a part of it amen going to be a part well praise the Lord I heard it I had a I had an Old Gentleman tell me one time an old preacher he says now listen don't cast don't don't get rid of all the goats God sends the goats in to help keep the light bills paid hallelujah amen he said have mercy on them all let God be the one that's doing the choosing here amen and and so uh but but you see but the only those that have been eternally represented in heaven will have the desire to go all the way with God praise the name of the Lord amen are you hearing me now brother Branham would go on to tell us he would say at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a bunch of names amen a record of names this is all done before the foundation of the world and as as we will point out shortly it is not a question of Simply involving ourselves with two groups of people both of whom had the opportunity to receive eternal life that wherein one group received it and had their names placed on the record while the others refused it and had their and did not have their names he says we'll actually show them multitudes who were not born again will will be given eternal life as strange as that might sound but that is certainly true we will also show that there is a group of people whose names have been placed on that record before the foundation and they cannot under any circumstances have those names removed but we'll also show another group that whose names were on that record before the foundation of the world and will have their names removed so now we we now we don't we're not God we don't understand how why God does these things that he does but yet that's the way God does it well praise the Lord amen now now we can we can see we we can see that that God can show Mercy unto one for the sake of showing Mercy unto the elect well praise the Lord the scripture says that God raised Pharaoh up to show his glory in the elect amen y'all want to read it praise the Lord now you might know who are you you're the Sons and Daughters of God you've been born again of the Heavenly places you've got an eternal representation in glory when you see the whole when you receive the Holy Ghost the word of life becomes illuminated to you because you come from the genetics of God that's who you are can you say amen and the scripture says Jesus said all the father gives me I will give eternal life another place None Shall pluck them out of my hand man well I'm thankful for that here this morning amen I'm thankful now now the scripture says there in Romans 9 and 15 it says uh for he saith unto Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so that it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of God that shows Mercy for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised me up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth with thou then say unto me why does he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will name it o man who art thou that replies against God shall the thing form say to the to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction that he might make known somebody say hallelujah that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a four prepared unto Glory now I'm telling you today that we are living we are walking we are part of a drama this is part of a play God created it God is the one that chose the actors you're you're you're part of the drama he chose you to fit your part Hallelujah good I just can I just give you a little bit of can I give you a little bit of relief amen if you're worried about the future hey man it's just all part of the drama it's all part of the scene it's all what God's seen in his mind before the foundation of the world that's the reason God could tell us exactly how the Beast was going to be and about the Anarchy and how that the church would be that's how he did he already seen it he already spoke it he's already declared it to you when you receive the Holy Ghost then you are placed into your position in the body of Christ when you receive the Holy Ghost you are you are placed by God not the preacher not the mama not the daddy amen not by not by the bishop or Pope or anybody else you are placed by God in your place to fulfill your part in the great drama here on this Earth amen this drama is the drama of redemption this drama is to show amen that the power of the blood is greater than any Satan than any Antichrist than any power of of the church that any power of delusion but any power of deception it is here to show that God's power is greater than any power amen hallelujah so we we look at that now on the Apostle Peter would say Amen there in First Peter 1 he lacked accordingly to the foreknowledge of God the Father to the sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied now God for new you see God's God foreknew the serpent God foreknew The Sinner God foreknew the saint God for new The Plan of Redemption amen God God seen the serpent God seen Adam and Eve God seen the fall and so God before the world was even created the the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world in God's plan he will praise the Lord some religious people try to say Amen that it took God off guard he didn't take God off guard the Bible says the lamb was slain before the world it it was all part we say when did Jesus die Jesus didn't die it was part of the plan it was in God's mind he was already slave in God's mind you you were already saved in God's mind the Bible says whom he did predestinate in whom he called and knew me whom he justified he has also already glorified in him you're represented in that lamb that was in the mind of God before there was ever even a sin Hallelujah Serpent's children cannot be a part of that but God knew the Serpent's Seed was coming the Serpent's children could not be a part of it there's no Redemption for them they never came from God there there is no representation there but you came from God and there is an eternal representation can you say man amen now the scripture did say what if God Amen had that long suffering for those vessels of Wrath fit for this long suffering in other words giving him a time to repent giving them a time there's a fact the scripture says they're they're they're in I I believe it was it was in in Peter amen where where he says uh and I I thought I I had it root here amen but uh uh you know that it's not the will of God that any should perish but that all should come to repentance and the Bible says and God is long-suffering to us word can you say man oh yes God's plan comes from foreknowledge amen so election looks back to what God's seen from the very beginning amen Destiny looks forward by predestination so God can predestinate your destiny because back in his yesterdays he saw you there God could predestinate you to be there because back in his foreknowledge before there was a devil before there was a sin before there was anything God seen you already I'm so glad that I'm part of a drama that I know I I'm glad to be on the good side hallelujah amen you know these kids were going around the other day they were well there's there's plants playing something I don't know it sounded pretty scary so one of them was one of them was leading the charge we're doomed we're doomed and the rest of it was falling behind and we're doomed we're doomed I said kids that ain't the crap that that ain't the vocabulary of a Christian amen you are blessed never say I'm dude amen you're not doomed there's a group that is doomed but that's not you amen hallelujah now how do I know I don't know the full play I don't know who's the elected who's not I don't know but you know what I'm doing I'm just believing that God don't sin I just fly this way I believe it I believe God don't send serpent seed to New Life Outreach amen I I believe that if you've got a heart that wants to please God and wants to surrender to the will of God and you are looking and saying God reveal to me the truth amen that is now that has been given to me I want this Lord let me not reject it how can you be serpent seed how can you be lost well praise the Lord but Judas came so far and Judas couldn't Judas just couldn't take it off Judas followed Jesus who is the record The Book of Life follow Jesus so far he went through justification sanctification even spoke in tongues or cast out Devils worked miracles but he could not go follow Jesus all the way to Pentecost and he put Christ to an open shame can you say Amen old church amen when you see the church that is doing that we can see the drama being unfolded Amen brother Branham would put it this way amen he would say before the great thought become a word god perceived it and pre-thought these things before the foundation of the world in other words God doesn't do anything by by the spare of the moment but it's eternally another place he would say Amen he would say in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God now before it could be a word it had to be a thought because a word as a thought expressed and when God seen that the enemy of this world and seen what he was going to do and what he did God thought how he would send the great Plan of Redemption and when he thought it then he spoke it and it was as good as done right then and thousands of years later came the Lord Jesus Christ and died for sins and rose again some 1900 years ago this morning for our justification setting at the right hand now as a high priest making intercession Upon Our confession see it's already finished and any word that comes out of God's Bible you can rest you're so upon in can you say Amen now represented God does and God always will identify himself in his Supernatural characteristics God will God will bring himself to the elect and it's not going to be in a in a in a natural knowledge it's not in coming and having a Bible study and say huh share to I said some things out of the scripture these are scripturals or these are spirit-based words that must receive the revelation of the spirit of God man now now I think this is this is pretty pretty true because God is Supernatural and these Supernatural characteristics are so far a phenomenal that it goes right over the top of of so many but you see good sweet nice well-meaning people can misunderstand them we've got all of these denominations coming out of the one same Bible but you see there's going to be a bride without spot who is going to take the word amen some say oh then we better we better uh start studying Greek and get the right Hebrew but how many dialects of the Greek the Greek Scholars don't even amen can't even agree together there are hundreds of different interpretations from hundreds of different Greek Scholars and and all of these things it's not the scholars and it's not it's the holy spirit that will reveal himself through his word through you can you say Amen amen well that Greek scholar can't agree with this and I would well we can't even get past a couple of Amen important verses in the Bible uh uh you know some some don't believe in in predestination some some believe those you know the police on the other side where you know you it's all work-oriented we got some that believes you know you got to be baptized three times Face Forward some three times backwards for the for the titles you've got so many that are going every which direction what we need today is the one who wrote the book to give the interpretation to the elect can you say Amen and when he does that then we can stand and every one of us will be in continuity well praise the Lord once again amen we go back to the brother random's uh time when he was in in uh I I believe it was there in South Africa and and there were there were hundreds of thousands of people there they were all divided up in tribes uh there there was a you know a a friction between them so they had everything on I mean it took it took it took a long time to get everything all set up Amen brother Branham comes in he's preaching and the and he's any and he and he talks about the the the the power of a resurrected Christ amen the first man to come in I I I I I believe that uh uh brother uh Billy Paul had he told Brother Billy Paul to go out and pick pick somebody out of the audience but brother Brandon had already had the vision of of that blind man being healed and so here here he comes up and he said now don't pick just anybody I want you to pick somebody that is validated somebody that I I want a noted Miracle to prove that Jesus Christ is alive amen and so um and and and if if I don't if is is this is this South Africa or is this India huh was it India okay so it might have been Bombay India amen so so anyways uh uh uh amen it's either South Africa or indeed all right putting that clause in here so so here here he's he comes up and and and and brother Branham had already seen it so he took he took all of these men from all of these I think there were 17 different religions there the the Hindus and this and that and the the the Sikhs and I mean there was a whole bunch of them there that he had talked with that day and those guys that told him wow their religion was the right religion and this that and the other and brother Branham says well instead of me doing the talking I want y'all to just come to the service tonight I want you to see my God in action so when brother pranam amen as he as he turned around to these men that he had talked to in that early in the day he says I want any one of you guys to come in the name of your God and I want you to bring healing heal this man's blind eyes now those eyes amen the whites the the the pupils were gone he had studied looked into the sun all of his life uh for for so long and and worshiping the son until it was just little white Globs in his in his head Amen brother Branham had just read us read him off told him who he was what had happened and this that and the other and he tells him he says I want you guys to come and make this man whole and then he gets persistent he says come and make this man whole if your God Is Right come and make him whole now brother Branham knew who he was he was an actor in a drama he knew by Vision God sent him there God told him what was fixing to happen brother Bradham could stand there with absolute confidence and he says and now that you may know that you may know that there's only one God and he is the Lord Jesus Christ he he commanded uh the blindness to leave the man began to see amen the power of God come down upon Him amen and all of a sudden there were hundreds of there are there were thousands that gave their heart to the Lord Jesus Christ it was like crazy he made the announcement after this he says I want everyone that wants to accept Jesus Christ I want you to take your Idols that you've got I want you to throw them down on the ground amen and denounce those Idols he said there was a Stomp and Stampede going on Dust flying everywhere amen as they took their idols and they were stomping them on the ground amen and so then he then he asked how many you know accepted Christ and raised their hands and there was about 30 000 people there and and so they they said well maybe they didn't understand only raise your hands if you've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ amen and they raised their hands thirty thousand people saw the Supernatural and they gave their heart to the Lord but another thing that was more incredible than raising their hands took place all of a sudden those natives that didn't know the right hand from the left some of them didn't have nothing but a loincloth on they were they were as naked as naked could be out there all of a sudden those Hallelujah that the holy brother random didn't teach them nothing brother Bradham didn't show them nothing all of a sudden the ones that the Holy Spirit women begin to separate themselves from the men and they begin what happened the spirit the supernatural spirit of God if we would get the supernatural spirit of God back in the Church of the Living God you wouldn't have to have all of the the do's and the notes there would be a holy ghost to tell you there wouldn't be no argument well show me how long is long show me whether it's right or wrong show me where well I want proof of this I want proof that you get the Holy Ghost you won't have to have proof you'll have your own proof he'll praise the Lord can you say Amen when the supernatural comes the elect Knowles when the supernatural Falls the Holy Spirit was falling upon the 300 000 but there were 30 000 in there that the supernatural presence of God ignited something on the inside of their hearts oh the glory to God that just does something so there is a seed of God predestinated of God and when the spirit of God falls upon it there is a supernatural effect that takes place well praise the Lord now I say today that there are in this drama there are those that are dominated by demons they're dominated by the spirit of the Antichrist the religious very religious a man they go to church they do those things and yet they are under the control or the auspice of spirits Paul talked about it amen it's wrote In the book of Jude it's wrote In the book of James it's wrote In the book of of Peter amen it's rodents in in to the Thessalonian church it's wrote In the book of Romans this is all containing inside the church where demon powers have control take their place but this is part of that that God had already seen But I say today and I want to finish my thoughts up on this we and this is my message here this was just a a leading up to it this part of the play is to be a Supernatural part of the play be it Demon's powers under the Antichrist Spirit has assumed their seeds doing their things but there is who under the supernatural power of God will do the Greater Works [Applause] she's not under the control of demons she's not under the control of of the Antichrist Spirit she's not out of the control of Rome she is under a Heavenly influence in her life amen think about Joseph when the angel appeared to Mary now he couldn't understand how a virgin how his virgin could have a a baby it was too much for his Limited well bless the Lord he was a creature of time but he was also a creature of Eternity and he's looking at this and he's looking at his limited find that comprehension Mary comes to him with the news of the angel and and she's looking up at him with with a pretty big brown eyes and she she's saying honey I've got something I got to tell you as we're engaged amen the angel Gabriel is came to me and uh Joseph the angel told me that the baby that I'm carrying and then I I'm I'm carrying the baby of God that it's been conceived of the Holy Ghost Joseph this baby is not yours it is finite thinking he's looking and he's saying Dear God I thought that I had a woman that was true and that and here she is a floozy and the Bible says that Joseph is now wanting to privately put her away and that's looking now now if Joseph would have simply taken the the facts taking the events of the day back to scripture he would understand that he's part of a drama he would understand that this that there was a virgin that was going to conceive but he would also have amen the lineage of David can you say Amen how Joseph wanted to believe that but intellectually he could not comprehend what God was doing he was part of the plan he was part of the plan but he was having a hard time understanding the plan good man just man wonderful man but he didn't have a clue laughs yeah when God is revealed in the Supernatural and God is always revealed in the unusual wait why is he revealing the unusual because he is revealed in the Supernatural the Supernatural is unusual to this world are are you all having hearing me amen you can't reason God's word with your mind two plus two does not always equal four you've got to walk with God by faith can you say Amen and I want to say that as the believer of every age has always come expecting amen the believer of every age has got to come to to grips has got to come to grips with the thought amen with the understanding that I am not here by accident and that anything that I am facing today God's placed me here so that the supernatural power of an unlimited God can be expressed through me in me can you say man don't look at this situations just trying to control you don't look at the situations just trying to put you down look at those situations as God is allowing this for his Supernatural presence in you Hallelujah can you see man me the elect from every age had a portion of that word they had to live out now they had to understand the Holy Spirit had to baptize him into that day into that body and when they was baptized in then they understood ha I'm here with purpose are y'all hearing me what happened to those people over there when they received the Holy Ghost they came in as naked as could be without any kind of with without that's just the way the life was and when they received the power of the Holy Ghost all of a sudden they covered themselves and were trying to hide men and women trying to hide from each other what was it they were the elect of God represented in the book of life before the foundation of the world but it took the Holy Ghost to come in and initiate it it the guys I hated I hate it when I'm up here preaching you guys are are battling the Sandman I I've been in I I've been out there well I know I know how it feels but I'm here to tell you oh I wish you would just shirk that devil off y'all right now get rid of that old Devil's truck this is a good sermon this morning how hallelujah amen the Sandman tries to come in and gets us all sleepy and oh my it's tough I I've been in a lot of services like that but I've also know what it is to overcome it amen and say Satan I'm here for a purpose and I know that demons are out there trying to keep me from my blessing this morning I'm going to stab them I praise the Lord I I'm the elect of God I'm the ordained of God I have been blessed by God Hallelujah can you say Amen yes if Joseph would have considered this Supernatural event by scripture but he was having a hard time amen if it looked out and if he would find the place that it was to take place in that day now there were no Prophets it had been 400 years since the last prophet Malachi was the last one and and so they they had no prophets in them days so you know what God done God used a secondary thing God gave him a dream now here he is he's a righteous man he's ordained of God he's got Eternal representation The Works of God are happening all around him Hallelujah but then an angel comes and appears to him in a dream it says Joseph Don't You Worry About Mary this has been ordained to happen Joseph I want you to know that you're part of the plan go take Mary into you to be your wife amen and it was after that that the Holy Spirit then he could step into the plan become part of them hallelujah what I'm trying what I want to really point out to you right now if God does not choose groups God does not choose New Life Outreach God does not choose message circles God does not choose denominational circles God chooses individuals it's an individual Affair you can sit in this church all you want to in Mr rapture you you can you can join any church it's not in a group it's in the individual God deals with you as an individual you kids can't go off of Mama's uh uh a religion you can't go off of Dad's Revelation you've got to have a revelation for yourself and when that Holy Spirit comes upon you then you're no longer fighting scripture you're no longer fighting the the word of the hour you're looking and that's all you can see and all of a sudden you find out you're as naked as naked could be clothed in laodicea and garments while saying you're clothed and you've got your Revelations and you're just fine and then when your eyes are open and you get the ice half then you found oh I'm serving a god of yesterday God's doing something in a rapturing age preparing a rapturing people and there is a people part of that drama well glory to God hallelujah oh feel me feel me can you say man God always God always God always deals with that individual God identifying himself he always does it in a supernatural way are you hearing me it is the individual who receives the Holy Ghost it is the individual who is placed into his body by one Spirit it is the individual's eyes that are open to their day and their messenger it is the individual gift that God uses within the church amen you've got to give sister Karen it's for the save you've got gifts I've got gifts we've all got gifts we are all part of this drama Hallelujah now it's not a group but it's a body of individuals with revelation do I have to teach my hand what to do it's part of the body my eyes don't have to go down and say am I supposed to be walking no you're born looking right all right amen you have to learn to walk as a as a body you do your legs are ready to walk but the rest of your body don't quite the rest of the body doesn't know if they can trust the legs or not amen and so when you're first learning to walk you're just amen you've got the legs and the legs are wanting to do something but the rest of the body's saying this is going to hurt this is going to hurt if we fall my head is gonna oh we've done this yesterday right but individuals part of this body baptized I I don't make preachers I can't make a deacon I can't make a Sunday school teacher I can't make a a singer I can't make a Christian but what I can do is preach the word and the Holy Spirit will bring the gifts out in their lives well praise the Lord amen it's the individual because your name not new life not new life named written in the Lamb's Book of Life but you as an individual your name is written in heaven in that lamb section and let me just tell you right now if you're in the lamb section what is God now praise the Lord there are some folks the right answer it's written down here all of your members are wrote down all of your Deeds are wrote down everything is wrote down in that in that book of life oh man good and bad good and bad but there's also some people that's represented in the lamb section well praise the Lord and what happens when that Eternal Gene seed comes to life when the Holy Spirit ignites that seed and you find out who you are oh now all of everything has all been thrown in the book of or in the sea of God's forgetfulness now your name is represented with Jesus Christ when God looks in the blood in the lamb section of the book he sees blood he sees Mercy he sees Grace he sees forgiveness he sees righteousness your name is written in his section of the book you're not under the denominational section you're not under this section of that section you're under the section of the Lamb can you say man and brother Brandon says now amen why do you hang on to some group when when they're all together wrong amen Revelation 17 said that all be collected into one great group to be out there but out of there will be those individuals that's right with God not not the group right but the individual amen he says we found out then we fuss and we go about and we belong to this and we belong to that that don't mean one thing to God it's you as an individual before God it's you you've got to stand on your own feet you've got you're the one that has to make the testimony each one of you has to do that and you've got to answer to God for the Revelation it is you as an individual your part of that drama now so the elect of the uh of of of God has been energized by that Holy Ghost now there is in this drama of rapture we're coming to the close of this message just like we're coming to the close of this world Hallelujah the the clothes of this world is is a man coming and everything is all at its stage the Antichrist is sitting there like the Bible said amen the all of the harlots are are are coming back home and just being going to be all thrown back into the bed amen with Mama just like the Bible prophesied amen we've got it all set here we've got everything going Hallelujah Russia the King of the North amen watch Russia watch Russia amen we're at Russia right amen the King of the North is going to come down and put a hook and you know what the Bible says there and we understand that Russia is going to destroy the Vatican in one hour we can see all of this we're seeing Russia flexing the muscles we see everything all setting up Hallelujah I think the church needs to be a yes just if I I believe we need to be more Spirit-filled than we've ever been before we need to be a believer is it more than we've ever been we ought to believe God for the supernatural more than we've ever believed God for the supernatural we're fixing to see a supernatural Rapture we're fixing to have a supernatural body change we're fixing to go up to meet the saints of God in the air with the Lord Jesus can you say Amen we are here at that point we're in this drama we are at the very peak of it First Age had their part second age had their part but I'm here at this age I'm at this rapturing time amen oh God hallelujah yes yes we're we're we're we're here and we're bombarded by the things of the natural the things of the flesh we got our sicknesses we've got those kinds of things but remember remember there is a purpose for everything that God allows everything comes God knows what he's doing nothing happens by accident God's seen it when he put your name on that book he knew it was coming your way but you are represented by him in the heavens Hallelujah how does he do it he's always searching out that predestinated seed how does he do it how does God search out the predestinated seed he'll come by his word living for that day can you say man amen is already written all over that word their name is written all over the word for the day you hear me amen already all over your name is written in this last day word either it's there or it'll never be there it was put there before the foundation of the world and you're going to rest in that and take God's word and say I'm gonna I'm just gonna believe what you say instead of trying to figure out if you said that there are vessels that are fit for Destruction I'm just I don't understand it but I say I believe it if you say favor I don't understand how I could be a part but I believe it can you say Amen amen now when your name is written in that section of the book your name is written in the Supernatural word of the day now brother Branham says God was determined that he had saved his people predestinated Church he had to do it himself because he predestinated it before the foundation of the world man's a failure always will be he's a failure to start with he always he will always be a failure but God in his predestination and his own great infinite mind planned the plan to put a real Vine down he planted it on this Earth the vine the righteous Vine not a denomination not a church not a Creed but a man himself made flesh he manifested his peace his power the great angel of God the great Jehovah was with him and in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily men did not believe he believe in him and disbelieved him because he could he would not cooperate with their Creed finally they led him away to Calvary and there that blood cell was broken of the precious Son of God the body of in which Jehovah dwell lived there came forth a Vine with its roots in glory with his branches on Earth to produce a Church of the Living God to show forth his resurrection and his power who is these men and women that would deny that church the vine of the Living God the never failing presence of the Lord Jesus with his church to live and to show forth his predestinated branches that he caught before the foundation of the Earth and swore by an oath that he had raised them up and his church today with the glory of his resurrection living in her I am the vine you are the branches every time the heart beats the the blood flotates every member of the body every time the loyal Heart Of God beats it pulsates through the name of Jesus Christ to the church whatsoever you ask in my name I will do I Am With You Always even to the end of the world no wonder Peter on the day of Pentacles says repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of sins and you shall be filled with the life from this Vine the Holy Spirit giving forth his name that if we're connected with him he's connected with God because he was the root and The Offspring of God he come to Earth the Earth was made by him he came into the world the world knew him not and now today after his dying to give forth the blood cell to break there that that through the blood of Jesus Christ a church could be Sanctified and put in order that the great Holy Spirit which is the life of the vine the eternal life of the vine the Holy Spirit could pulsate in to every member of the Church of the Living God it's no wonder they're odd and peculiar people no wonder they act strange they don't have no more affairs of this world for they are dead and buried in Christ they have raised a new life to be with the first fruits of them that enjoy the spiritual resurrection that the Holy Spirit Will flow through every member and would show forth the glory of God like God showed in Egypt when he brought forth that vine can you say Amen when I begin to think of this as I'm as I'm as I'm bringing things winding things up my thoughts up I want you to look at that Bond Lily here this morning now I I hope that that that this hasn't just been a lot of words what my desire has been here this morning is to show that the predestinated plan of God is is going on in this Mortal body in this mortal world the Eternal one came down as brother Branham says now we have got our roots in heaven and the vines are being expressed here on the earth we have got our headship from Heaven we've got our life from Heaven the supernatural power of the Holy Ghost is now living and energizing the seed of God on the inside of us how can we be anything else than what God has already ordained us to be but I believe that the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is not I I I I I I I think too many times that we have got so complacent now I just want to I want to just pour my heart out for just a moment amen here this morning because I want to tell you you'll never live this life by thinking that Holy Ghost amen is easy believism that believing this message amen is all that you've got to have in order uh uh to be a part of that drama you must be initiated into it by the Holy Ghost now now listen easy believism amen is something that the world has it's it's coming in making a confession shaking the preacher's hand amen getting baptized and then just sitting there in your in in your bench and and now you're you're a Christian that is not a Christian that's easy believism amen that that is that is part of the other that is part of of Cain worship amen Cain worship had no life in it Cain worship took the fruit amen the best fruit of the field and what he could produce and what he had he had grown and he offers that unto God and that is what the church has done today we have come in and we've made confessions and we have said things and amen we have made things flowery until the music is pretty and the preaching is pretty and amen and and and and and worship is pretty in and giving your heart to the Lord is pretty and everyone it's a dry eye coming into the church and it's a dry eye going back out of the church but I want to tell you when the day of Pentecost was fully come when the Holy Spirit came down and baptized those people amen they were not the same scared men that were up there that 120 that was in that Upper Room when they came out of that upper room they were drunk man amen they were carried by a new wine there was a new something that had taken place and when they went out there on the streets they were not the same scared men amen that were in there hiding before now they're out there under the anointing of the Holy Spirit Peter's not the same tower that he was but now there is a vine that has been energized now he has anointed for service now there is a Church of the Living God it's no longer Jesus now it's God in his people living this drama ouch now this now this people would turn the world upside down now this people would heal the sick and raise the dead now this people would show that the Living God Of Heaven is living in his people here on Earth [Applause] man easy Believers and will never produce power friend is he believes and will never produce the anointing of the Holy Ghost it takes a dying and you say man easy believe is him will never bring up Lily Pond out of the scum and the muck of the bottom of the pond to overcome but it'll take the life the power of the life of the sun to beat down upon that scummy Pond that liturgized the seed that's way down in the bottom of that pond because there was some connection between the heavens and the Earth because there is some connection between the Sun and the seed it doesn't bring anything else up and that's coming upon everything else is dead the pond is dead everything's dead everything is coming it stinks but all of a sudden up through all of the scum and all the mud and all the rocks and all the filth and all the logs Here Comes something that's coming up and coming up and coming up working its way up in a pops its head up Hallelujah here comes the little Easter or the Little Lily upon Lily pokes his head up and begins to look around before you know what the Little Lily Pad amen begins to to expand and the beautiful flowers come off of it what was it it wasn't it was not somebody telling it or or it's shaking its hand it was it was an experience between the heavens and the Earth I wonder sometimes the easy beliefism that it's easy for us no wonder it's easy for us to do away but the nine spiritual gifts it's easy for us to do away and explain away because we ain't got enough Holy Ghost to perform it it's easy for um Church it doesn't mean that the seed's not there it means you'd better come out from underneath those denominational Towers that you're hiding behind it's the same Antichrist spirit that wants to do away with the life of the individual did the Catholic Church do at the beginning the Catholic Church says listen we don't need every man and woman with spiritual gifts we don't need men and women coming and doing their thing now the Apostle Paul says when you come together you've got Psalms one has a word of knowledge you have this you're edifying one another now he was getting on to the Corinthian Church this is not in order you need to do everything indecently in an order you're acting like children with these gifts amen but then when he got to the next chapter of the 14th chapter he said I I say covet the best gift I I say that y'all shall all covet to prophesy what we want to do away with that so did the Catholic Church the Catholic Church didn't want the gifts of the Spirit you know why the gifts of the Spirit is no longer present along for in the church and why Satan wants to keep those things away because brother Branham taught us that if the gifts are in the church sin will be exposed now I'm just talking to you from my heart here I'm just talking to you from my heart what I'm saying is it's easy for someone to set in a group and be disguised as Judas because the only thing that's going to tell the difference is the supernatural and the word of God and God will never do away his promise to the last in the last days I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh All Flesh that's Baptist flesh Mexican flesh Hebrew flesh that's black flesh yellow flesh Brown flesh red flesh yellow what whatever white flesh all these fleshes he's pouring them out every it's Paul it's falling on every denomination but only the seed that God has represented in the eternals is going to respond to that seed everyone else is going to have oh yeah you know yeah they're going to speak in tongues and oh yeah they're going to they're going to run the aisles oh yeah they're going to have their emotions and this is a trick of the devil to make us think we don't want anything to do with it they've missed it and they missed it and they missed it and they missed it and they missed it well I'm here to tell you the Holy Ghost don't miss it and I'm here to tell you God's place to every one of us here on this Earth for a purpose and with gifts and your name is already apart come on Church Holy Ghost energizing it with I'm going to tell you when the Holy Ghost energizes you those life of the word within you is going to come out in US come on Church come on now amen you don't get quiet on me hear what I'm saying is in the last days I will pour out my spirit and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see Visions the old men shall have dreams in the last days this is the last days praise the Lord what I'm saying the Catholic Church put it we're just going to have a few holy men let me take all your Bibles you don't need to study come on but they got by the time they got to the Dark Ages all the Bibles were collected it was all written in Latin and only the priests could have them we will teach you what you need to know there was no Holy Ghost worship there was no Holy Ghost this that well praise the Lord but I'm going to tell you we're living in the day where the gods opened the book up and he's saying amen whosoever will the command do the bride is go to the angel and take the open book come on that means that that that that that that means somebody else besides the preacher needs to be doing some study that means somebody else besides Mom and Daddy's got to do some studying I think something like what I've made somebody else has got to get a hold of God and say I want the holy ghost in my life that means God if you said that I'm part of this church I can't do it in my carnal ways I can't do it in my carnal thinking I've got to get a part of the Holy Ghost team I've got it's not been I'm part of a group the group Ain't Gonna Save Me the group ain't me I am an individual I have received the Holy Ghost I meet your presence I want your anointing I need you in my life living yourself through me I'm part of the drama you kids are part of the drama Hallelujah we're all part of the drama I praise the Lord Amen in my name you'll cast out devils and my name your hands on the sick my name you'll do these things in my name my name my name my name what what is it you are part of the Eternal book of God amen praise the Lord now when Jesus comes to the woman at the well because she had representation in the Lamb's Book of Life and she was part of God's thinking at the beginning Jesus on when he was here on Earth he said I needs must needs go that sounds like bad English but he said it and in another language so maybe our translations wrong but he said I must needs go to Samaria why what why because there is a red light worker there was a sex Queen that has her name on the book they came across fought Devil's coming and got all the way across got over there Jesus sent them disciples out to the going visit or go go get some groceries or whatever he starts talking to this woman eat a drink she says hi I'm a I'm a Samaritan you're a you're a Jew we don't have no dealings with each other what are you doing asking and has he began to talk to her and he says if you ask me have a drink I'll give you a drink and you'll never thirst again and she says you don't even have nothing to draw from this well and that well is deep what are you talking about he's thinking she's thinking he's hitting on her and then he says won't you go it's your husband and she says I don't have one he said you said the truth well he's had five and the one he's got it's not yours you turn around and look to him and said I perceived you're a prophet he said when the Messiah comes he will do these things he says I'm he says now you know you Samaritans you come to this well the Jews are saying you've got to be in Jerusalem you've got all of these things there but I'm saying that the times will come and now is that you must be worshiping in spirit and in truth she dropped a water panel and took off running telling the city come see a man that told me all that I I ever done there was something about that Supernatural presence of God that ignited the Eternal Gene's seed that was there as the musicians come I just want to read a little bit of what brother Branham said I thought it was I love the way he put it he said what if I'm speaking to a person that actually cannot receive it there's nothing in him to receive from the Bible said that she that lives in pleasure is dead while she's alive why was it those Pharisees look at Jesus all that we know we we he he was the Manifest word of God we believe that the Bible said it was well watch when he'd done his Messiah sign the Pharisees had a little bit of light they were good people lived a good Christian Life for a good religious life they had a little light about them they had organized in a priesthood they had a little light but down in the bottom of their heart they had no Eternal representation and Glory so when they seen the supernatural done they said this man's Beelzebub a devil what happened that put what like they had out but here was a little ill-famed woman a prostitute down in her heart well she had a representation of one of God's thoughts there she was waited in sin but when she seen what happened she said sir I believe you're a prophet I know when the Messiah comes he will tell us these things what did he do he cleansed her life he was a redeemer to her because he could lift her up where she came you'll miss that part if you're not if you're not careful she was part of Eternal representation and Glory in God's thinking Jesus came as the word The Living Word and brother Branham says he was her Redeemer because he could lift her up from this Mortal filthy world to where she came from in the mind of God but this Pharisee think of it religious as he could be and Jesus said you're of your father the devil and his works you'll do religious men belong to fine orders Jesus called them Snakes in the Grass and devils they rejected the light of the hour that's exactly what it was Jesus in his age what was he just like the prophets of their age each one of them was God's word being interpreted for that age Moses was God's word interpreted I'll send you down there I'll deliver them I'll send you down there with my word I'll do great signs and wonders he did it Mary she was God's words interpreted a virgin shall conceive that was God's word interpreted and I say today oh Church of the Living God God's calling us more and just coming to church three times a week calling us more just sitting in pew Pew destroy the Devil we are here Hallelujah someone says oh yeah don't take us back to Pentecost I I said I I say we need to go back to the original Pentecost not not 1906 Pentecost but the original where the Holy Ghost has his way in every one of our Lives can you say Amen hey man yes sir amen oh they they said well you there's nothing different someone told me the other day well there's nothing different between what what what what you're saying and and what they are in this Pentecost age brother Brandon says we don't need it and I said brother Brandon said we need the we need the Holy Ghost we need the gifts all the way up to the dime the day that he died he was expressing and declaring that we need the Living God but what he was trying to tell us is all this dancing and shouting and these all these tongues and all this stuff and then going out there living like the devil and and putting away of the word he says you're living contrary to it but a man or a woman that will come under the authority of the real Holy Ghost the real word of God subject themselves to it I want everyone in this building to know that you are subject to any of those nine spiritual gifts you are subject to visions and dreams you are subject to the power of an unlimited God but it's going to be somebody that is going to steal a way that is willing Amen to I'm not saying to manufacture nothing you'll never manufacture your you know if God's not called you to be a preacher I don't care how much you pray and fast you'll never be a preacher amen I'm not saying that but I am saying God places everyone in the body of Christ I am saying that the power of the Holy Ghost amen you should expect power in your prayer you should expect the supernatural in your in in your uh in your home in your car on your job come on Church we are the supernatural body of the supernatural God do you believe it not a group an individual not my mama not my daddy not my brother not my sister but it's me in the need of prayer it's me it's me it's me I am wanting to steal away I want the supernatural what can you say man amen amen do you ever cry for that Supernatural is there something on you it says crying for it he mine oh yes I'm not doing them I'm not I I'm not I'm not doing away with church attendance well I I'm I'm a I'm a proponent that if you believe God you're going to make it to church amen amen you know I I understand you know when you're when you're when you when you you know you you're can't go you can't go you're in the hospital you like Dad or uh uh you know like sister Angie or somebody that is just you know that's just that's just you know Satan is is trying to take their life I understand but it all comes back it all comes back to who we are and what we are when we're born again there's something on the inside and I said yeah there's a fight in US [Music] not not to stay away but a fight within us to be right to fight within us for God to use us and fight within us there's there's there's there's a lion on the inside of us that wants to defeat the Devil in every way possible [Applause] I believe in it for the song leader not leaving it for the musicians not leaving it for the preacher every one of us want to destroy him there's something in you longing for that and it's that longing it causes you to steal away say Lord I'm not satisfied I'm not satisfied with my preaching I'm not satisfied with my singing playing not satisfied with just being a part here or there her group foreign there's something deep down inside me Lord that is craving [Music] thing down inside your little scumbag of a body Hallelujah here's a here's a there's a a lily pad wanting to come forth it's inside you in your mortality in your carnality in your flesh there's eternal life that is wanting to come forth and be expressed and that's what the Rapture is [Music] sure sing to meet him his words of Life have been expressed as he would he come the first time or something you're saying that's me you've been in that barnyard all your life little eaglet you were stolen from the nest put underneath the chicken then he enhatched you right there with all of the others you've always known there's something different about you you've always known it oh yeah you followed her around just like the rest of the other chickens [Music] and eating the little worms the little bugs just wasn't here went in here you just got enough to get you by Hallelujah but when Mama came by and she began to scream at the moment began to let up that scream all of a sudden that he could he was the only one in that bar in the yard that heard that scream now chickens if they heard that screen they were probably running the opposite direction because eagles eat chickens amen amen but those little those little those little chickens didn't hear nothing saying come up higher but that little Eagle had heard something saying from the fire man his mama began to Circle and sweep over that little Barnyard swoop down and go back up and that little league that looked at his wings looked at her wings He Man looked at look look and understand oh she looks like me I look like her Eagle letting out that scream come up higher son you don't belong in that chicken pin you're not a chicken you always were an eagle you were hatched under the hen but you're not a chicken you're an eagle about that um he flapped his wings amen got to the edge got on top of the fence post Hallelujah Mama kept on screaming and he kept on looking I want to go higher flapped his wings again he got all the way up to the to the EU the ball iron oh he was seeing things from a different life but Mama kept on screaming scream don't get satisfied there you've got Wings come on up higher don't depend on the farmer to give you food don't sit there and wait for the slop come up higher Hallelujah then finally he got the courage and he flapped his wings before you know it he was soaring up there with his mama he always was an eagle he always had that representation and I say today you always were you always were this Rapture is declaring who you are it's calling you up body changes fixing to happen why is this body change fixing to happen because your soul has been given the earnest of the power of the Holy Ghost it's showing you where you came from where you're going [Music] laodicea praise the Lord [Music] what are you playing brother Kobe [Music] surround me [Music] surround [Music] oh Lord let your spirit [Music] Jesus surrounds [Music] I love you Lord I love you surround me Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] let yours one more time with all your heart [Applause] Surround Me Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] something pulling me unthankful that the anointing of the holy spirit that is upon me is not calling me to some emotional worker that he's calling me to see his word for this day [Music] I'm secured enough in the Bible that when he says [Music] drama there will be Seven Stars [Music] these are going to be the messengers to each one of those ages don't worry they'll be in my hand you can believe them and trust them I'll be identified with them I will show that I I'm I'm glad that the Holy Spirit can allow me to believe that that there are seven candlesticks and I'm glad that I can understand that the Holy Spirit for this day now I'm not talking about another day I'm talking about the day that the book is to be unveiled unsealed [Music] I I'm glad I don't have to go listen to Marilyn hickey's hard to to Billy barium or you know Jimmy Swagger's interpretation they've got they've got the they've got the seals going on in the tribulation they've got but God says no just listen when I send the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery is going to be finished he how does she how he not a she a he a church a prophet I'm glad when you receive the Holy Ghost it just automatically lined you up with present Day scripture and you're saying show me just as Philip Philip was out you know the the Deacon Philip out there talking about the Lord and man he just led a whole group of people and all of a sudden he was translated and he was and now he's now he's now he's running beside a chariot and and The Chariot stops and and he's talking to him and he and he knows he's reading he's reading the book of Isaiah he said do you know anything you're reading about he says I'm reading but I I don't really understand something was pricking his heart it was present Day scripture Philip said hey that that you're reading there in Isaiah it's fulfilled the unit says don't say it's in the book of Acts you don't say [Music] that scripture well I've never even heard it he's already come and he's gone he's already come and gone I tell you what if you repent of your sins you're baptized in water you can receive the same holy ghost that he had [Music] they said well here's water what does hindrance amen what damn it [Music] Eternal representation God sent Philip right his way because there was a seed who needed it God was showing him his day aren't you glad that God knew you were going to need it and you were conquering for it and God sent it to you and then you had the ability to say hallelujah I'll never forget the days when God came to me I'll never forget the day hello surely there's more there's more and when it came and when I found out God's order and I seen the great drama that God put in Revelations 2 and 3 and seen it all folded out I thought part of the seventh one Hallelujah God teach me show me it's never been a problem for me to get in study those messages it's never been a problem for me to say Lord cleanse me and wash me I'll take that open book I'll take it and eat it instead of me trying to change this whoo get all that stuff out of my belly here that don't belong here is that right I want to digest him I want to be a part of it now I tell you what we're going the baptistry is not ready and so we're going to have to have the baptism will it be all right to do it tonight I'm sorry uh brother Joel we'll do it tonight and um we'll get the baptism baptistry all already it's it's it's uh it's trying but it's not their and it's as brown and full of bugs you

time we had a baptismal here I we had a main a water main break and um so a lot of our water was really I mean we got mud and rocks and stuff all in it well it was still in the lines apparently here I guess I don't know how that happened has anyone else got any brown water foreign ours don't have it okay well it's just here hot man I'm glad I didn't have to take a shower in that this morning [Music] but I will tell you it's cleaner than the lake water so if if you would just give us a a little more time I don't know I was going to say we could dump that out and redo it but if it's if that's just the way it is then we'll continue filling it up and then we'll just we'll we'll be ready listen [Music] sized in muddy water Jesus was baptized in Jordan amen so that's not sewer that's not that's the late turning over that's just the that's just the color of our water [Music] praise the Lord I was going to say how did it take that long to clear those lines but if it's just the way it is around this around this part of the country no wonder we feel dirty when we're getting out of the shower man so uh we're excited somebody's excited for what brother what God is doing for brother Joel [Music] vessel buddy I and I I believe that healing and and I believe in miracles I believe it's still here and they took 30 he's lost 36 pounds of fluids this week amen and that's that's that's that's that Old Devil he's fighting and um I think you made the right decision that's the way I look at it I want to be right with God whether he takes me or whether he heals me permanently or whether he heals me temporarily permanently as us being ready to go on the other side brother Joel but if God but we also believe in God to to heal us right here too and the god that healed sister Stephanie

know Sister there's no sister Stephanie and this won't take me long just give me just give me two minutes here sister Stephanie Collins says I have a testimony to share for the glory of God everyone that knows me much at all knows I haven't had much of a life for four or five years dude to debilitating headaches and I want to just stop here and say I've known sister Stephanie to be having those headaches for the last 10 years and it got so bad that she could not do anything at all these last four or five years and she is there is she is he's not putting enough reality to that okay there is she was in bed and she worked and and we'll see how it goes on but this woman is very accurate the headache started when I was 18 I would get one bad once or twice a year as the years have gone they have progressively got worse to the point of being in bed 10 to 15 days out of the month I've laid in a dark closet many days I've seen three or four neurologists ENT doctors multiple chiropractors multiple regular doctors headache Specialists a few natural doctors and acupuncture I have I have had about every drug thrown at me no one has answers I have fought depression and anxiety I've missed my own children's birthday parties a lot of family functions holidays Church meetings sold my vehicle since I wasn't able to drive there's been many dark and feeling low days I bet God to please take me home all I wanted was to be well and to be able to take care of my family in prayers I prayed many prayers for healing and many of you have prayed hard for me and I can't tell you just how much that means to me April 1st was just another day dealing with a headache that evening I was laying in bed feeling down clicked on Facebook and a dear pastor friend was having church so I started listening to the service for a little bit I was about to turn it off and I thought what if there's something for me brother J.R reek was preaching and he started going through different Miracles that have happened I started feeling something stir inside my heart I said uh and Stern and I said you're my God too and I claim this for myself brother Jeremy Schreiner the pastor was concluding the service and began singing one of the songs was I'm going to see a victory how I love that song I felt the presence of the law of God very near and as I was in the church service with them as if I was in the church service with him he stopped singing and said I have a sister on my heart for the last 15 minutes she doesn't attend this church I don't even know if she's watching but I would like for us to pray for sister Stephanie callings I was sobbing at this point I started praising God for the victory in my life a little later my daughter Sarah came into my room and said Mama woke up this morning burdened for you I asked God to do something Supernatural for you today so that you will know that God is with you the devil has told me over and over God is not with you nor does he hear you well I'm here to tell you he's a liar Jesus said he would never leave me or forsake me since April 1 I have taken down my blackout curtains I never lay in my dark closet I'm never and I'm starting to drive again I never go to bed wondering what life will be like tomorrow I make plans now I'm able to follow through with my plans day for the day from April 1st until now I typically would have been in bed at least 60 days and missed many church services not only have I been able to attend our services but I've been able to go to church meetings with my family I do not want to fail to give God all the glory that he deserves I can never praise him enough I'm seeing victories I pray this testimony will help others to believe God for their need he always keeps his word oh isn't that just wonderful [Applause] I I've been there I've encouraged sister Stephanie I I've I've I've I've went down there I I I sit here at the church one night when the anointing was just really strong come up

while the presence of God was so strong took that down to her and I spoke the word of the Lord and his sister Stephanie's life and and she said she'd listen to that until the tape broke wore out she
