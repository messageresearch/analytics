[1:02:35] soldiers of the cross
[1:02:37] with you the believer
[1:02:39] amen and so if you have your bibles
[1:02:42] saint john the first chapter
[1:02:45] and we've got to link the scripture
[1:02:48] reading
[1:02:49] we'd like to just begin at the first
[1:02:52] verse and we'll go down to the 16th
[1:02:55] verse
[1:02:56] and then
[1:02:58] john the
[1:02:59] third chapter
[1:03:03] and then we'll turn to luke the 17th
[1:03:06] chapter
[1:03:12] i just like to say also that
[1:03:15] we just so appreciate all of the the
[1:03:17] labor and
[1:03:18] to put a meeting like this on and
[1:03:20] there's there's a lot of labor and
[1:03:23] a lot of things behind the scenes we
[1:03:25] appreciate all the meals and you sisters
[1:03:28] just
[1:03:28] laboring there in the kitchen and all
[1:03:30] the work that goes into that and
[1:03:33] it's just been tremendous
[1:03:35] and so saint john the first chapter
[1:03:39] beginning with
[1:03:41] verse 1
[1:03:43] in the beginning
[1:03:44] was the word and the word was with god
[1:03:48] and the word was god
[1:03:51] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:03:53] all things were made by him
[1:03:56] and without him was not anything made
[1:03:58] that was made
[1:04:00] in him was life and the life was the
[1:04:03] light of men
[1:04:05] and the light shineth in darkness and
[1:04:08] the darkness comprehended it not
[1:04:11] there was a man sent from god whose name
[1:04:13] was john
[1:04:15] the same came for a witness to bear
[1:04:18] witness of the light
[1:04:20] that all men through him
[1:04:22] might believe
[1:04:24] he was not that light but was sent to
[1:04:27] bear witness of that light
[1:04:29] thou was the true light which lighteth
[1:04:32] every man that cometh into the world
[1:04:35] he was in the world and the world was
[1:04:37] made by him and the world knew him not
[1:04:41] he came unto his own
[1:04:43] and his own received him not
[1:04:46] but as many as received him
[1:04:48] to them
[1:04:50] gave he power to become the sons of god
[1:04:53] i'd like to read that again but as many
[1:04:56] as received him
[1:04:58] to them
[1:05:00] gave he power to become the sons of god
[1:05:04] even to them that believe on his name
[1:05:08] which were born not a blood nor of the
[1:05:10] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[1:05:14] but of god
[1:05:15] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:05:17] among us
[1:05:18] and we beheld his glory
[1:05:21] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:05:24] father full of grace and truth
[1:05:27] john bear witness of him and cried
[1:05:29] saying this
[1:05:31] was he of whom i spake
[1:05:33] he that cometh after me is preferred
[1:05:35] before me
[1:05:36] for he was before me
[1:05:39] and of his fullness
[1:05:41] have all we received
[1:05:44] and grace for grace
[1:05:46] aren't you glad that we have received
[1:05:49] his fullness
[1:05:51] john the third chapter
[1:05:54] verse 28
[1:05:56] to verse verses 31
[1:06:00] ye yourselves bear me
[1:06:02] witness that i said i am not the christ
[1:06:07] but that i am sent before him
[1:06:11] he that hath the bride is the bridegroom
[1:06:15] but the friend of the
[1:06:16] bridegroom which standeth and heareth
[1:06:19] him
[1:06:20] rejoiceth greatly because of the
[1:06:23] bridegroom's voice
[1:06:25] this my joy therefore is fulfilled
[1:06:29] he must decree or he must increase
[1:06:33] but i
[1:06:34] must
[1:06:35] decrease
[1:06:37] now
[1:06:38] let us just go ahead and turn to
[1:06:42] luke the 17th chapter and i know all of
[1:06:46] these are familiar
[1:06:49] portions of scripture to us i'm sure
[1:06:53] but luke 17 beginning at verse 28
[1:06:56] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:06:59] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[1:07:02] they sold they planted they built it
[1:07:05] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:07:07] sodom
[1:07:08] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:07:12] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[1:07:15] it be in the day when the son of man
[1:07:18] is revealed
[1:07:19] now let's just bow our heads in a word
[1:07:21] of prayer
[1:07:23] heavenly father truly we deem it a great
[1:07:26] privilege to be here on this friday
[1:07:28] night and
[1:07:29] staying there in still water and
[1:07:32] just a lot of talk about game day and
[1:07:34] what's going to be taking place
[1:07:37] those that are coming in for
[1:07:38] a big day of festivities tomorrow lord
[1:07:42] but it's so good lord that you have put
[1:07:45] a real eternal joy within our hearts
[1:07:47] that
[1:07:48] we can come and rejoice around the word
[1:07:51] of god and something that is not just a
[1:07:54] temporal weekend satisfaction but an
[1:07:57] eternal joy
[1:07:59] lord i pray god that you would move us
[1:08:02] aside and help us to say something
[1:08:05] that'll just touch your people lord
[1:08:08] we would ask this in the name of the
[1:08:10] lord jesus christ amen
[1:08:13] and amen god bless you as you would take
[1:08:15] your seats
[1:08:16] i i would like to
[1:08:18] uh borrow a title from our prophet
[1:08:22] and i and that is just one word and that
[1:08:25] is look i'd like to speak on look and
[1:08:29] i i i found that
[1:08:31] john 1 1 to me john 1 1 and then of
[1:08:35] course hebrews 13 8 that jesus christ is
[1:08:39] the same yesterday today and forever are
[1:08:42] cornerstone scriptures of the entire
[1:08:45] bible
[1:08:46] and we see that god is his word and and
[1:08:51] he's never changed he he's not changing
[1:08:54] it his nature his ways his methods his
[1:08:58] pattern he is the word and he always
[1:09:01] will be the word
[1:09:03] and then we see that we read in the 14th
[1:09:06] verse
[1:09:07] that then we beheld his glory
[1:09:11] and it was the word when the word is
[1:09:14] made manifest
[1:09:16] then
[1:09:17] you can behold him you can see him
[1:09:20] and that doesn't need any interpretation
[1:09:23] it doesn't need anyone to look look back
[1:09:26] and and try to interpret what is going
[1:09:29] on but it is simply
[1:09:31] being interpreted before you
[1:09:34] and we just receive what god is doing
[1:09:38] amen and and i i i we see in the bible
[1:09:41] that god is the i am god
[1:09:45] and i am the promised word
[1:09:49] and when we see the promised word made
[1:09:51] manifest for the hour then you are
[1:09:54] looking at jesus christ the same
[1:09:58] yesterday today and forever
[1:10:00] now the prophet of god would tell us in
[1:10:03] the anointed ones at the end time that
[1:10:05] the teaching of the season brings fruit
[1:10:09] for the season
[1:10:11] you see john the 15th chapter jesus is
[1:10:15] saying that god is looking for fruit
[1:10:18] amen he's looking for a bride tree
[1:10:22] that is manifesting the word the word
[1:10:25] fruit we see in the restoration of the
[1:10:28] bride tree that there is predestinated
[1:10:31] fruit that has been laying in the word
[1:10:34] for a predestinated season
[1:10:37] and the fruit is going to be the faith
[1:10:40] to lay hold of the promises
[1:10:43] that that there could be a manifestation
[1:10:45] of the power of god in the bride of
[1:10:48] jesus christ
[1:10:50] now that's what god is looking for he's
[1:10:53] not looking for just children he's not
[1:10:55] looking for pentecostal babies but he's
[1:10:58] looking for a woman a bride that has
[1:11:01] been maturing in this evening-like
[1:11:04] message amen not not trying to figure
[1:11:07] out if it's still right or not and not
[1:11:10] trying to figure out if we can put our
[1:11:12] confidence in it but we are a mature
[1:11:15] bride amen and they're a fruit that is
[1:11:19] there's a word concerning this bride
[1:11:23] that is being manifested in this hour
[1:11:26] hallelujah now you see the message has
[1:11:29] brought christ into focus amen how many
[1:11:33] can say man to that
[1:11:35] amen you see if someone tells you to
[1:11:38] look then what they're trying to do is
[1:11:42] they're trying to to to
[1:11:44] there's something specific that they're
[1:11:47] trying to get you to look at
[1:11:49] it's something they're trying to get you
[1:11:51] to see and they're trying to get your
[1:11:54] attention now the prophet of god told us
[1:11:57] what what what he's trying to get us to
[1:12:00] look at and the attraction on the
[1:12:02] mountain is god is fulfilling his word
[1:12:06] hallelujah that's what that's what the
[1:12:09] message is trying to do is get us to
[1:12:13] look at the word that is being fulfilled
[1:12:16] in this day and say there is christ
[1:12:19] we don't have to look there we don't
[1:12:21] have to look there we don't have to look
[1:12:24] there but there is a word concerning
[1:12:27] this bride in the evening time that is
[1:12:31] manifesting the fruit of a prophetic
[1:12:34] word
[1:12:36] hallelujah you see what's the attraction
[1:12:38] it is god fulfilling his word
[1:12:42] then you see there's power in what you
[1:12:45] look at
[1:12:46] now we find this in the exodus amen when
[1:12:49] there was sin that came into the camp of
[1:12:52] israel then for the cure of sin the
[1:12:56] prophet was to take a brazen serpent and
[1:12:59] put it up on a brass pole and put it
[1:13:02] before the congregation of israel and
[1:13:06] anyone that can look would live so
[1:13:09] there's power in what you're looking at
[1:13:12] we find that when jesus christ was
[1:13:15] lifted between the heaven and earth he
[1:13:18] was not just put there for a show but it
[1:13:20] was for a people that they could look
[1:13:24] and it would be a cure for sin this
[1:13:27] power in what you look at
[1:13:30] well you see in this exodus we are not
[1:13:33] looking at his corporate body because
[1:13:36] that's not the promise but the promise
[1:13:39] is the revealing of the word and when
[1:13:42] that word is made manifest you can look
[1:13:46] and you can live there's power in what
[1:13:49] you look at let me go ahead and just say
[1:13:52] it this way there's an atonic power in
[1:13:55] the world there's a blood in the word
[1:13:59] there is a bleach in the word there's a
[1:14:02] power to heal a power to deliver a power
[1:14:07] to set the captive free it is found in
[1:14:10] the word
[1:14:14] you see today
[1:14:16] we're looking to his word
[1:14:18] his word that's been revealed
[1:14:21] and vindicated
[1:14:23] and made a reality before us
[1:14:25] you see the prophet was saying the seed
[1:14:27] is not aired with the shock but at the
[1:14:29] opening of the seven seals revelations
[1:14:31] 10 the forward
[1:14:34] is to be born into manifestation again
[1:14:37] and vindicated by the spirit of god
[1:14:41] in the full strength as it was when he
[1:14:44] was here on earth
[1:14:46] manifested in the same way
[1:14:48] doing the same things that it did when
[1:14:51] he was here on earth amen hebrews 13 8
[1:14:54] said jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:14:57] today and forever luke 17 30 in the last
[1:15:01] days as it was in the days of sodom when
[1:15:05] the son of man will be revealing himself
[1:15:07] again it'll be the same thing the world
[1:15:10] is in a solemn condition and the church
[1:15:13] has went into sodom with it like lot and
[1:15:16] his wife and i say that there is an
[1:15:19] elected church somewhere in this world
[1:15:22] that's pulling out and set aside from
[1:15:24] those things and the manifestation of
[1:15:27] god has attracted its attention were at
[1:15:31] the last days the shock has given forth
[1:15:34] his strength into the seed what is the
[1:15:38] seed it's the seed word what has
[1:15:41] attracted our attention it's the word
[1:15:44] the promised word for this hour made
[1:15:47] manifest oh friends in that promised
[1:15:50] word is our messiah it's the anointing
[1:15:54] to break the yolks it is the revealing
[1:15:57] of the son of man the word made manifest
[1:16:02] and it's caught our attention
[1:16:05] it's a reality of his power
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:12] now there is so much to look at today
[1:16:15] the devil has placed every gimmick
[1:16:18] he has placed all confusion
[1:16:20] he is trying to his best to take away
[1:16:23] the attraction from the word
[1:16:26] we find in luke 21 2 21 25
[1:16:30] and there shall be signs of the son
[1:16:33] and in the moon
[1:16:35] and in the stars
[1:16:36] and upon the earth distress of nations
[1:16:39] with perplexity the sea
[1:16:42] and the waves roaring
[1:16:44] men's hearts failing them for fear
[1:16:47] and for looking after those things which
[1:16:50] are coming on the earth for the powers
[1:16:52] of heaven shall be shaken so the people
[1:16:55] are looking at so much confusion they're
[1:16:59] looking at so much fearful happenings
[1:17:01] there's so many things amen to bring
[1:17:04] fear upon the hearts of the people but
[1:17:08] that's not where it stops he says and
[1:17:11] then they shall see the son of man
[1:17:14] coming in a cloud with power and great
[1:17:17] glory let me just stop there and say
[1:17:20] that was not just some event that
[1:17:23] happened to heaven look and you'll see
[1:17:26] your redemption look and you'll see the
[1:17:29] power of his resurrection look and you
[1:17:33] will see your deliverance
[1:17:39] and a clown with power
[1:17:41] and great glory and when these things
[1:17:46] begin to come to pass

[1:17:53] for your redemption draweth nigh

[1:18:05] it's not a weak hybrid gospel it's the
[1:18:09] power of his resurrection that are
[1:18:11] changing lives
[1:18:12] it's a it's a revival that is restoring
[1:18:16] us back to the very mind of christ where
[1:18:19] there is no bad belief
[1:18:23] there is no fear to shackle you
[1:18:27] there's no sickness that can discourage
[1:18:29] you
[1:18:31] we are under the power of the headship
[1:18:35] of the son of man it's the word that's
[1:18:38] calling you come up higher
[1:18:41] come up higher
[1:18:43] come out of that confusion
[1:18:45] come out of the doom and gloom
[1:18:47] come out
[1:18:49] of all of the bellyaching and the
[1:18:51] grumbling and where's god after i say
[1:18:54] look
[1:18:56] i say look
[1:18:59] quit looking at the unbelief quit
[1:19:01] looking at the fear quit looking at
[1:19:03] satan's lies
[1:19:05] look
[1:19:06] and live
[1:19:07] [Applause]
[1:19:15] you see looking and redemption
[1:19:17] are simultaneous
[1:19:19] it's happening at the same time
[1:19:24] you can't separate the two

[1:19:43] the power to change your nature is here
[1:19:49] you see god's given us something to look
[1:19:51] at
[1:19:52] we are looking at the revelation of
[1:19:54] jesus christ
[1:19:57] that's the promise of this hour
[1:20:00] the same ministry
[1:20:03] of jesus christ
[1:20:04] is made manifest in this day
[1:20:09] brother branham preached sermons like
[1:20:11] look
[1:20:13] look away to jesus
[1:20:15] looking unto jesus
[1:20:17] and he would ask those questions of
[1:20:20] what are you looking at
[1:20:22] what do you see when you look
[1:20:24] what are you looking for
[1:20:28] you would say what do you see when you
[1:20:30] do look
[1:20:31] that only depends
[1:20:34] on what you're looking for
[1:20:36] so let me ask you this what are you
[1:20:38] looking for
[1:20:41] [Applause]
[1:20:42] for jesus said who do you say i
[1:20:45] the son of man am
[1:20:47] i who are you looking for
[1:20:54] there it is
[1:20:57] you see
[1:20:58] let some say this
[1:21:00] some say that
[1:21:02] we got a lot of that still today
[1:21:07] the prophet would ask what are we coming
[1:21:09] to church for yeah
[1:21:14] i'll ask you this why do you why do you
[1:21:16] believe the message
[1:21:20] i'll ask you this who is the message
[1:21:23] [Applause]
[1:21:25] well you see
[1:21:27] it all depends what you're looking for
[1:21:30] you see some are looking just to see a
[1:21:32] good man
[1:21:34] and so they see a good man
[1:21:37] some are looking to see a teacher
[1:21:40] some are looking just to see a prophet
[1:21:43] some are looking to see a theologian
[1:21:50] what what are we looking for
[1:21:53] you see when man messes with the lens
[1:21:56] i've already told you the message has
[1:21:58] brought christ into focus
[1:22:02] we're not we're not looking to interpret
[1:22:04] anything
[1:22:05] we're looking to get all our belief out
[1:22:07] of our hearts and we're looking to keep
[1:22:10] christ the center of our focus
[1:22:13] [Applause]
[1:22:15] when man messes with the lens we always
[1:22:19] end up seeing a little lesser jesus
[1:22:24] we get a lutheran jesus we get a baptist
[1:22:27] jesus
[1:22:28] a methodist jesus a pentecostal jesus
[1:22:33] you see when men begin to put their own
[1:22:36] conception of jesus to this message it
[1:22:40] changes the whole focus
[1:22:45] then they begin to look for a
[1:22:47] psychologist
[1:22:49] they're looking for a modern day
[1:22:50] counselor to help cure the problems
[1:22:54] then they begin to maybe look for some
[1:22:57] modern day drug to numb their woes so
[1:23:00] they can get through lay out a seal
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:05] you see when men begin to put their own
[1:23:09] conception of jesus to this message 100
[1:23:14] of the time it lowers expectation for
[1:23:17] the supernatural
[1:23:20] people become disappointed
[1:23:23] they become discouraged
[1:23:25] they become offended
[1:23:29] what do you call that googly juice or
[1:23:31] whatever
[1:23:32] spray
[1:23:35] the goody-goody juice
[1:23:38] they become
[1:23:39] they become offended over everything
[1:23:43] they're looking for a substitute
[1:23:45] you know why they're looking for a
[1:23:46] substitute because the message can't do
[1:23:48] it any longer
[1:23:50] so they think
[1:23:53] that's good
[1:23:53] [Applause]
[1:23:55] but you see one time
[1:23:56] john the prophet
[1:23:59] he got into prison and his eagle eye got
[1:24:03] dimmed over
[1:24:06] and he had to he had to go and send some
[1:24:09] some messengers to go ask jesus are you
[1:24:11] the messiah or do we seek another
[1:24:16] and jesus didn't send john a little book
[1:24:19] to you know how to behave himself in
[1:24:21] prison but he just began to tell him of
[1:24:24] the word made manifest
[1:24:26] and he said don't tell john the blind
[1:24:29] seat
[1:24:30] the death here
[1:24:31] the dead are raised
[1:24:33] is not this the messiah only christ can
[1:24:36] do this
[1:24:37] only christ can take a drug addict and
[1:24:40] make them whole
[1:24:43] only christ can take a harlot and make
[1:24:47] them whole
[1:24:48] only christ can heal marriages only
[1:24:52] christ can set your heart in rapturing
[1:24:55] faith rapturing favor that there's no
[1:24:59] doubt no hindrance if he comes tonight
[1:25:02] you're ready
[1:25:11] hallelujah but jesus didn't say blessed
[1:25:13] are they who are not offended at me
[1:25:17] there's going to be some that are
[1:25:18] offended at the word
[1:25:20] and we're in that age
[1:25:22] there's so many people that just get so
[1:25:24] offended at the word
[1:25:26] hallelujah
[1:25:27] but you see the prophet of god would say
[1:25:30] he's done come through justification
[1:25:33] lutheran sanctification wesleyans
[1:25:35] pentecostal age done placed his gifts
[1:25:37] into the church and now appear to us in
[1:25:40] our flesh
[1:25:42] as jesus said he would
[1:25:44] don't be offended at him he's right on
[1:25:47] time
[1:25:49] john get out of that jail
[1:25:55] i just want to say
[1:25:57] we need to get out of the jail
[1:26:00] sometimes we get so locked up in our
[1:26:03] traditions we get so locked up in how
[1:26:07] the working the moving of the holy ghost
[1:26:09] supposed to be we get so locked up in
[1:26:12] how we think things ought to be we need
[1:26:15] to get out of the jail
[1:26:17] we need to give the headship to christ
[1:26:19] we need to allow the holy ghost to have
[1:26:22] preeminence in our life get out of the
[1:26:24] jail
[1:26:26] get out of the moly crops get out of the
[1:26:28] depression get out of the woe is me get
[1:26:31] away from what you can see with this
[1:26:34] natural eye and look to the reveal word
[1:26:39] it's a promise of revival
[1:26:42] it's a promise of victory
[1:26:44] it's a promise of joy it's a promise of
[1:26:48] revival
[1:26:50] not an intellectual revival it's a word
[1:26:53] revival
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:26:57] you know what that means don't you
[1:26:59] [Applause]
[1:27:00] in your mind
[1:27:02] the devil's telling you you're in your
[1:27:04] mind that everything's falling apart
[1:27:06] and you're still in revival
[1:27:10] your mind the devil's telling you you
[1:27:12] ought to be depressed but you're still
[1:27:14] in revival
[1:27:16] the devil's painting a bad picture of
[1:27:18] the of the world today
[1:27:20] but the word but you're still in revival
[1:27:23] this is not an intellectual revival it's
[1:27:25] a revealed word revival it's something
[1:27:28] that god has placed within your heart
[1:27:31] you're bearing fruit unto the teaching
[1:27:33] of the season and the teaching of this
[1:27:35] message is you never sinned in the first
[1:27:38] place you are a gene seed of god's
[1:27:42] thoughts you've never had a beginning of
[1:27:45] end and you'll never have an ending you
[1:27:48] are the word made manifest
[1:27:54] satan you've lost control
[1:27:57] we are under the headship of the
[1:27:59] anointed revealed word of the hour
[1:28:04] get out of that jail
[1:28:09] why are we staying there
[1:28:10] [Applause]
[1:28:13] did we not hear a prophet say house of
[1:28:15] hell give way to the name of jesus
[1:28:17] christ
[1:28:19] has not the bars already already been
[1:28:22] broken asunder get out of the jail
[1:28:33] you see so many people
[1:28:35] they don't recognize him
[1:28:37] because
[1:28:39] he doesn't come according to their
[1:28:40] traditions
[1:28:43] jesus
[1:28:45] when jesus come those scribes and so
[1:28:46] forth ought to have recognized him but
[1:28:48] they didn't
[1:28:49] because they were set in their
[1:28:51] traditions
[1:28:53] oh the prophet again says another time
[1:28:56] they formed their own opinions of what
[1:28:58] he ought to be
[1:28:59] their own idea
[1:29:01] instead of taking what the word said
[1:29:04] that's why we've got so many people
[1:29:06] saying he's just a psychologist
[1:29:09] he's just a good counselor
[1:29:11] he's just a good man
[1:29:14] hallelujah
[1:29:16] amen their own idea instead of taking
[1:29:18] what the word said
[1:29:20] that's the way when they look eve and
[1:29:22] even see jesus himself they fail to
[1:29:25] recognize him
[1:29:26] they did it on the day of pentecost they
[1:29:28] did it when he was in flesh they did it
[1:29:31] when he was in the manger they did it
[1:29:33] when he was on the streets of jerusalem
[1:29:35] they did it when he was on the cross and
[1:29:38] he's the fulfillment of that word and
[1:29:40] yet they had the messiah coming down on
[1:29:44] a corridor out of heaven and everything
[1:29:46] else and was wrong
[1:29:48] because it was their intellectual
[1:29:50] conception and they failed to see him
[1:29:54] and looking right at him at him
[1:29:57] so it is today
[1:29:59] [Applause]
[1:30:02] again the prophet would ask
[1:30:04] in the sermon this day this scripture is
[1:30:06] fulfilled
[1:30:07] he says it depends how you approach it
[1:30:11] depends on what you're looking for
[1:30:14] when you go to church
[1:30:16] it depends on what you're looking for
[1:30:21] hallelujah i hope i'm not reading too
[1:30:23] much
[1:30:25] the prophet says these men why was they
[1:30:28] called and was put in this condition
[1:30:30] these pharisees by jesus
[1:30:32] jesus said in the vain you worship me
[1:30:34] worship him genuine worship true worship
[1:30:38] from their hearts in vain you worship me
[1:30:41] why
[1:30:42] teaching for doctrine their tradition of
[1:30:44] man therefore you make the commandment
[1:30:46] of god of no effect to the people if i
[1:30:49] taught you a methodist message it would
[1:30:51] take no effect on you this is bride time
[1:30:55] if moses taught the message of noah it
[1:30:58] would take no effect if jesus taught
[1:31:00] moses message it would take no effect
[1:31:03] because the predestinated seed are
[1:31:06] laying there that will only be watered
[1:31:09] by that type of water let's give for
[1:31:12] that seed
[1:31:14] let me just say this this is harvest hot
[1:31:18] this is the evening harvest rain
[1:31:22] this is the anointing to ripen your
[1:31:27] your heart your faith to a perfect
[1:31:30] rapturing faith
[1:31:32] this is not a luther anointing this is
[1:31:35] not a wesley anointing and this is not a
[1:31:38] pentecostal anointing this is a
[1:31:40] bridegroom anointing this is our mate
[1:31:43] the revealed word that is revealing
[1:31:46] himself and whispering love secrets to
[1:31:49] your heart it's an anointing that comes
[1:31:52] from the headship of the messiah himself
[1:31:56] that i
[1:31:57] [Applause]
[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:32:00] [Applause]
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:10] i think
[1:32:21] again
[1:32:22] we're looking for a fat yeah
[1:32:26] we're looking for
[1:32:28] we're looking for a manifestation
[1:32:31] so the prophet of god would say the
[1:32:32] question is
[1:32:33] what do you look what do you see
[1:32:36] when you look
[1:32:38] you see isaiah 45 and 22
[1:32:42] says look unto me
[1:32:44] and be ye saved
[1:32:46] all things of the earth
[1:32:48] for i am god and there is none else
[1:32:54] the prophet would say look unto me all
[1:32:56] the ends of the earth now when the earth
[1:32:59] has come to its end
[1:33:01] or the system of the earth has come to
[1:33:04] its end let the people look unto him
[1:33:10] again the prophet would say look
[1:33:12] especially unto me at the end of each
[1:33:15] world system
[1:33:17] because he always makes himself known
[1:33:20] so real at the end of a world system
[1:33:26] is he god's into profit
[1:33:28] to tell us luck
[1:33:31] that means he's wanting us
[1:33:33] he's trying to get our focus on the
[1:33:36] promised word of the hour
[1:33:39] get our get our attention on the
[1:33:42] scriptural promises for the end time
[1:33:46] look on this and you won't miss the day
[1:33:48] of your visitation
[1:33:51] look at this malachi 4 luke 17
[1:33:55] revelations 5 revelations 10 look upon
[1:33:59] these promises and you will not miss
[1:34:02] your day and hour of visitation
[1:34:08] you see he's made known by the promised
[1:34:10] word made manifest and his promise for
[1:34:12] this hour is the revealing of the son of
[1:34:15] man
[1:34:16] as it was in the days of sodom so
[1:34:19] shall it be at the revealing of the son
[1:34:22] of man
[1:34:23] the prophet of god said and when it come
[1:34:26] to the end of that world system when
[1:34:29] judgment was falling upon sodom amen it
[1:34:32] was when elohim stepped down upon the
[1:34:36] earth and he took 16 elements of dirt
[1:34:39] and he
[1:34:41] and he blew and there was a body and he
[1:34:43] stepped into that body and he come to
[1:34:46] abraham and he began to discern a
[1:34:49] sheriff's heart in the temp behind him
[1:34:52] what was he doing the prophet said that
[1:34:55] he was representing something that he
[1:34:58] would be in the last days it would be
[1:35:01] elohim the son of man it would be
[1:35:04] melchizedek the son of man it would be
[1:35:08] jesus christ the son of man it would be
[1:35:11] the bridegroom the son of man it would
[1:35:14] be the word made manifest the son of man
[1:35:17] it will be everything
[1:35:21] our healer the son of man deliver the
[1:35:25] son of man rapturing faith the son of
[1:35:28] man it would be grace grace to the bride
[1:35:33] when the word is made manifest
[1:35:44] well brother jonathan but you know the
[1:35:45] pentecostals
[1:35:50] watch it
[1:35:51] the prophet said you're looking a shock
[1:35:56] well but i think those denominations
[1:35:59] watch it
[1:36:01] because the life has already
[1:36:03] moved on
[1:36:05] and every one of those systems are dead
[1:36:08] shock
[1:36:09] dead tassel
[1:36:14] so the prophet had to catch the
[1:36:16] attention of the bride and call her out
[1:36:21] that she can receive
[1:36:24] messiah
[1:36:25] [Applause]
[1:36:27] we're looking at that quit looking at
[1:36:29] that quit looking at that quit looking
[1:36:32] at that you've got to look at this
[1:36:35] anointed word for this hour
[1:36:44] the reason that some people can't be
[1:36:46] delivered they're looking at the wrong
[1:36:48] thing
[1:36:49] so many people are trying to get the
[1:36:50] holy ghost and you can't get it you're
[1:36:52] looking at the wrong thing
[1:36:54] so many people are trying to live in
[1:36:56] overcoming life but you're in defeat
[1:36:59] you're looking at the wrong thing you
[1:37:01] see you're gonna come out
[1:37:03] come out of the jail
[1:37:05] come out of the system
[1:37:06] come out of the grave come out of the
[1:37:08] doom and gloom
[1:37:10] come out we're a revival
[1:37:14] this is the anointed world
[1:37:17] that breaks the yolks
[1:37:20] we're arguing with this message we're
[1:37:23] fussing with this message it's the
[1:37:25] anointing to break the oaks
[1:37:32] [Music]
[1:37:37] you see he had to represent something
[1:37:40] he was going to be in the last days
[1:37:43] so he comes right down and talks in
[1:37:45] human flesh
[1:37:46] amen oh i'm so glad that he's that kind
[1:37:52] now you get the point
[1:37:55] because the prophet of god
[1:37:57] just goes ahead and says it many many
[1:37:58] times
[1:37:59] and he says that again in the trial
[1:38:02] and he's talking to that blind
[1:38:03] prosecutor
[1:38:07] and that blind prosecutor that's trying
[1:38:08] to blind the eyes of the people
[1:38:11] to say that god don't do those things
[1:38:12] any longer
[1:38:13] the days of miracles are in the past god
[1:38:16] really don't love you and god really
[1:38:17] don't feel with the holy ghost and god
[1:38:19] really don't provide eternal joy and
[1:38:22] eternal peace and and eternal rest
[1:38:28] oh but when the prophet how he's going
[1:38:30] to nail his case
[1:38:32] he's going to deal with that blind
[1:38:34] prosecutor who is the devil himself and
[1:38:37] says satan god never promised nail scars
[1:38:42] he never promised prince and thorns he
[1:38:45] promised luke 17 30 the revealing of the
[1:38:48] son of man and it will be as in the days
[1:38:51] of abraham the days of lot when elohim
[1:38:54] came to the earth and he brought forth
[1:38:57] the power to bring forth life in their
[1:38:59] womb and change their bodies let me tell
[1:39:02] you something god's here to deal with
[1:39:05] the deadness of your heart
[1:39:08] god's here to deal with you according to
[1:39:11] life
[1:39:12] and there is no life outside of this
[1:39:15] word and you cannot be made pregnant
[1:39:18] outside of this word and you cannot
[1:39:21] bring forth predestinated proof outside
[1:39:24] of a predestinative message
[1:39:26] [Applause]
[1:39:32] elohim
[1:39:34] amen
[1:39:36] elohim
[1:39:38] the one
[1:39:41] the one that you need
[1:39:43] he didn't need you
[1:39:44] he's the self-existing one
[1:39:48] well god just needs me he don't need you
[1:39:52] you need him
[1:39:53] he's your husband
[1:39:56] and i don't care what this modern
[1:39:59] satanic
[1:40:00] spirit says
[1:40:02] a woman cannot bring forth seed outside
[1:40:05] of a mate
[1:40:08] it took a profit to reveal
[1:40:11] the
[1:40:11] revealed word and say now there's your
[1:40:14] mate
[1:40:16] if you're gonna find life you're gonna
[1:40:18] find it in the reveal word
[1:40:21] if you're going to find anything to do
[1:40:23] with rapturing grace it's going to be
[1:40:26] found in the revealed word
[1:40:28] that is your mate
[1:40:31] that's where the dynamics come from
[1:40:34] the lord himself shall descent
[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:44] amen
[1:40:47] glory hallelujah is this all right
[1:40:52] amen see the prophet of god and i know
[1:40:54] we know this but i just
[1:40:55] got to read it
[1:40:57] i wasn't the one that appeared down on
[1:40:58] the river
[1:41:00] i was only standing there when he
[1:41:01] appeared
[1:41:02] i'm not the one that performs these
[1:41:04] things and foretells these things that
[1:41:06] happens as perfect they are
[1:41:08] i'm only one that's near when he does it
[1:41:11] i was only a voice that he used to say
[1:41:13] it it wasn't what i knew it's what i
[1:41:16] just surrendered myself to
[1:41:18] that he spoke through it isn't me it
[1:41:21] wasn't the seventh angel oh no it's the
[1:41:23] manifestation of the son of man
[1:41:27] the manifestation of the son of man it
[1:41:29] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[1:41:32] mystery that god unfolded it's not a man
[1:41:36] it's god
[1:41:38] the angel was not the son of man he was
[1:41:41] the messenger from the son of man the
[1:41:44] son of man is christ he is the one that
[1:41:47] you're feeding on you're not feeding on
[1:41:49] a man a man a man his words will fail
[1:41:53] but you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:41:57] word of the son of man
[1:42:00] [Applause]
[1:42:07] can you imagine when john came to
[1:42:08] revelations 10
[1:42:11] and john's a type of the bride
[1:42:14] and john
[1:42:16] was able to say i saw
[1:42:19] another mighty angel
[1:42:24] after coming through revelations nine
[1:42:28] when the lid of hell is lifted off and
[1:42:30] death angels are
[1:42:32] going forth
[1:42:34] and he's seeing nothing but death and
[1:42:35] destruction
[1:42:37] but then i saw
[1:42:39] another mighty angel when you see these
[1:42:42] things coming upon the earth and
[1:42:44] everyone is in fear and everyone is
[1:42:47] under the spirit of judgment and
[1:42:49] judgment is coming upon the world
[1:42:51] because they have rejected their messiah
[1:42:55] i'm not talking about 2 000 years ago
[1:42:57] i'm talking about this age they have
[1:42:59] rejected their messiah the prophet of
[1:43:01] god said we have our messiah the
[1:43:03] anointed word he's just looking for
[1:43:06] someone to anoint him with faith to make
[1:43:10] it live
[1:43:12] [Applause]
[1:43:14] they rejected their messiah when they
[1:43:16] rejected this message they rejected
[1:43:19] their bridegroom that could bring life
[1:43:21] within their womb to manifest
[1:43:24] predestinated fruit and they have just
[1:43:26] went into total chaos
[1:43:29] [Applause]
[1:43:34] but then revelations 10 the bride saw
[1:43:37] another angel
[1:43:38] and this wasn't just any angel this was
[1:43:40] a mighty angel
[1:43:42] oh this is a mighty angel and he's got a
[1:43:45] book in his hand and this is not a this
[1:43:47] is not a seven seal book this is not a
[1:43:50] book that's been that's been sealed up
[1:43:52] for the foundation of the world but this
[1:43:54] is a book of redemption that has been
[1:43:58] opened it has released the desires of
[1:44:02] the bride
[1:44:06] you know what the desires of the pride
[1:44:08] is to manifest christ
[1:44:11] to be pregnant
[1:44:14] what's the desire of any of any woman
[1:44:18] she wants to be pregnant she wants to
[1:44:21] manifest life
[1:44:23] so that seven sealed mystery of
[1:44:26] redemption had to be opened in the last
[1:44:28] days and the bride had to look and say
[1:44:31] wait a minute there's another angel
[1:44:34] this is not a death angel this is a
[1:44:37] messenger of life
[1:44:40] this is the body angel that's descending
[1:44:44] it's christ
[1:44:47] only christ
[1:44:48] can it be
[1:44:52] amen
[1:44:56] the prophet of god said christ is the
[1:44:57] anointed one
[1:44:59] john 1 1 says he's the word it's the
[1:45:02] anointed word
[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:05] this message ain't some dead letter
[1:45:08] this message is the dynamics
[1:45:12] i'm getting ahead of myself but that's
[1:45:13] okay
[1:45:14] this is the dynamics that has come to
[1:45:16] the mechanics to make this word live
[1:45:20] amen you don't have to just be sitting
[1:45:21] around a table mamas and daddies and and
[1:45:24] reading the bible and reading the
[1:45:26] message and saying my aren't those
[1:45:28] wonderful promises and too bad we can't
[1:45:30] live that today too bad god don't do
[1:45:33] those things today no sir there is a
[1:45:36] perfect faith within this bride when she
[1:45:39] reads of her promises she's looking at
[1:45:41] them with the spirit of joshua and caleb
[1:45:44] who were of another spirit and they said
[1:45:46] give me my mountain give me my point of
[1:45:49] redemption my name is written all over
[1:45:51] those promises christ has come to anoint
[1:45:54] my life to take my promises i'm anointed
[1:45:58] to possess the gates of my enemy i'm
[1:46:01] anointed to tear down cancer i'm

[1:46:27] my stereo no place on my computer get
[1:46:30] out of my home
[1:46:35] the mighty angel
[1:46:37] the anointed word
[1:46:39] has anointed you
[1:46:41] to take your position in christ
[1:46:44] [Applause]
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:48] only christ can be
[1:46:52] and the prophet of god said revelations
[1:46:54] 10 1
[1:46:55] was on the earth at the same time of
[1:46:57] revelations
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:01] so when the prophet was trying to get us
[1:47:02] to see
[1:47:03] it's not me
[1:47:05] i'm trying to point you to him
[1:47:08] he's the one that tells things that are
[1:47:10] so perfectly
[1:47:11] he's the one that is that has placed
[1:47:13] thus saith the lord in the bride
[1:47:16] he's the one that said follow me as i
[1:47:18] follow christ he's the one that we are
[1:47:21] taking this anointing message and
[1:47:23] prophesying again we're prophesying over
[1:47:26] our families
[1:47:28] we'll come on somebody we're prophesying
[1:47:31] and saying they're coming
[1:47:33] no weapon formed against me shall
[1:47:35] prosper death you have lost your sting
[1:47:38] grave where is your victory i am holding
[1:47:41] up the vindicated anointed message of
[1:47:44] the hour satan you have no place in me i
[1:47:49] come out of the jail i've come out of
[1:47:51] the confusion i've come out of the
[1:47:53] defeat i've come out of the doom i've
[1:47:56] come out of darkness i have ripened i am
[1:48:01] here
[1:48:02] i am anointed manifested word for this
[1:48:06] day
[1:48:08] don't tell me i don't have a right don't
[1:48:11] tell me i'm coming in the future
[1:48:13] i'm here
[1:48:16] bring it on devil
[1:48:18] [Applause]
[1:48:29] too late devil
[1:48:33] you can't hold back of gene seed of god
[1:48:35] [Applause]
[1:48:45] he is
[1:48:46] the opening of the word
[1:48:48] amen
[1:48:51] you see paul said
[1:48:52] the lord
[1:48:54] is thy spirit
[1:48:56] all right
[1:48:58] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:49:04] there is liberty
[1:49:08] what was paul talking about
[1:49:10] he was talking about tremendous
[1:49:12] administration of condemnation
[1:49:14] right
[1:49:15] that was being spoken under
[1:49:18] the law
[1:49:19] of tops and shadows
[1:49:21] that was only prophesying
[1:49:23] of a perfect one to come
[1:49:26] and moses had to put a veil over his
[1:49:30] face
[1:49:31] that the children of israel could not
[1:49:32] look and see that which was to be
[1:49:35] abolished
[1:49:36] but when the messiah come
[1:49:39] and said this day
[1:49:41] this scripture
[1:49:42] is fulfilled
[1:49:44] there is a change
[1:49:46] at the ends
[1:49:50] at the ends
[1:49:52] of the world system
[1:49:54] when christ come to turn the corner
[1:49:59] that we heard about
[1:50:00] it was a change of dispensations of
[1:50:04] types and shadows to the perfect one
[1:50:07] standing before them saying the spirit
[1:50:10] of the lord hath anointed me this day
[1:50:14] this scripture is fulfilled and paul is
[1:50:17] saying that ministration of condemnation
[1:50:21] is done away with
[1:50:23] [Applause]
[1:50:25] but there's a veil
[1:50:27] that's still over their heart
[1:50:29] when they read the law they cannot see
[1:50:32] that which was to be done away with they
[1:50:34] can't read and see christ
[1:50:41] i'm going to stop here for a second
[1:50:42] because
[1:50:43] some of you say why do we need this kind
[1:50:45] of a preaching
[1:50:46] why do we why do we have to labor in
[1:50:48] these things
[1:50:49] it's because
[1:50:51] you're the only one
[1:50:53] that is blessed
[1:50:55] to see the word
[1:50:57] and see christ
[1:51:03] there's a veil
[1:51:05] that is still over their hearts
[1:51:07] and they're reading the same bible that
[1:51:09] you're reading and they've got a hundred
[1:51:11] or a thousand different jesus
[1:51:18] you see
[1:51:20] paul was saying
[1:51:23] now if the heart will ever turn to the
[1:51:26] lord
[1:51:26] the veil will be lifted
[1:51:29] and the lord
[1:51:31] is
[1:51:32] thy spirit and where the spirit of the
[1:51:36] lord is there's an anointing
[1:51:41] to lift the veil of darkness off of your
[1:51:44] heart
[1:51:45] that you can see into the perfect law of
[1:51:50] liberty
[1:51:51] and be changed from glory to glory
[1:51:57] brother jonathan i i those things are
[1:51:59] just so deep watch it as you're looking
[1:52:03] not into something that is deep and so
[1:52:06] well it's just beyond me no the prophet
[1:52:09] of god said is simple
[1:52:13] and as you are looking into god
[1:52:16] hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:52:20] revealed in the same way as you're
[1:52:23] looking at it you are being changed from
[1:52:26] glory to glory
[1:52:29] there's a power
[1:52:31] there is a liberty
[1:52:33] to be changed
[1:52:36] to be transformed
[1:52:39] not to be reformed
[1:52:41] be transformed
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:46] not to just have a little pat on the
[1:52:47] hand and say now you know better than
[1:52:49] that
[1:52:50] not to just put you into the prison and
[1:52:52] say well let's reform him hopefully
[1:52:54] he'll be changed
[1:52:57] luther tried it and it never worked
[1:52:59] wesley tried it it never worked the
[1:53:02] pentecostal age tried it it never worked
[1:53:04] this is not a reformer's message this is
[1:53:08] christ himself the lord himself this is
[1:53:12] the liberty that the bride has been
[1:53:15] waiting for if you can see him you have
[1:53:19] the liberty to be changed
[1:53:22] you don't have to be the same
[1:53:24] you don't have to be bound you can be
[1:53:28] filled with the holy ghost
[1:53:30] you can be rejuvenated
[1:53:33] you can be changed by the power of the
[1:53:36] gospel
[1:53:46] you see
[1:53:47] we got to come to a mount
[1:53:48] transfiguration
[1:53:54] you see john
[1:53:56] john was there crying

[1:54:09] there he is
[1:54:10] quit looking there quit looking there
[1:54:12] quit looking there look
[1:54:14] all right
[1:54:16] and when the disciples went up to jesus
[1:54:19] up with jesus to mount transfiguration
[1:54:22] and they've seen they've seen uh uh they
[1:54:24] see moses and they've seen elijah
[1:54:27] and then
[1:54:28] oh they got peter got so beside himself
[1:54:30] that he said let's make three
[1:54:32] tabernacles one to moses and one to
[1:54:35] elijah and one unto you jesus and then
[1:54:38] there's a cloud
[1:54:40] i'm not scared of clouds
[1:54:43] if you're wanting christ to be revealed
[1:54:46] we're not scared of
[1:54:48] clouds if you're wanting your thinking
[1:54:51] to be changed we're not scared of clouds
[1:54:55] but praise the name of the lord and when
[1:54:58] that cloud came down there is a voice
[1:55:00] that said this is my beloved son hear ye
[1:55:05] him
[1:55:06] [Applause]
[1:55:07] and when the cloud lifted they saw jesus
[1:55:11] and jesus alone
[1:55:17] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:55:19] word was with god and the word was god
[1:55:21] and the word was made flesh
[1:55:23] and we beheld his glory
[1:55:27] now
[1:55:28] they came out of there
[1:55:30] my came off of the mountain they they
[1:55:32] said jesus told jesus
[1:55:35] we don't understand it we thought that
[1:55:37] elijah was to first come
[1:55:40] and jesus said elijah
[1:55:42] shall come and restore all things
[1:55:45] and he has come
[1:55:48] you mean they went all
[1:55:50] of this time
[1:55:53] and they didn't see
[1:55:55] you mean they actually had been
[1:55:57] listening to the prophet's message all
[1:55:59] of this time and they didn't still see
[1:56:02] that it was the revealed ministry of the
[1:56:05] son of man that they were looking at
[1:56:07] their their bridegroom
[1:56:11] the very thing that they have been
[1:56:12] longing for their healing their
[1:56:14] deliverance their revival their rapture
[1:56:17] their grace everything that they had
[1:56:20] been looking for was found right there
[1:56:22] in the word made manifest but they and
[1:56:24] jesus well god said the prophet god sent
[1:56:26] a prophet praise the name of the lord
[1:56:28] we've got to come to a map
[1:56:30] transfiguration
[1:56:31] [Applause]
[1:56:34] everything else has got to drop and came
[1:56:37] from you and we have got to see that
[1:56:40] this is christ the anointed vindicated
[1:56:43] word and it's christ and christ alone
[1:56:46] [Applause]
[1:56:48] he is the dynamics
[1:56:52] he is the power of transformation
[1:57:01] [Applause]
[1:57:09] you see
[1:57:10] the prophet says the mechanics don't run
[1:57:12] the church and i'm closing
[1:57:14] it's the dynamics
[1:57:16] the holy ghost that gets into this word
[1:57:20] the prophet would go on and say what god
[1:57:23] promised for the hour look for it to be
[1:57:24] fulfilled
[1:57:25] you must look to him because he is the
[1:57:27] word
[1:57:28] and the only way you can look to the
[1:57:30] word is look to him look to him he is
[1:57:33] the word and the word promised for this
[1:57:35] day is to be fulfilled this day
[1:57:38] amen noah's time could not be fulfilled
[1:57:40] this day it was only a time moses time
[1:57:43] and so forth but this is the day that
[1:57:45] god has promised these things and now
[1:57:48] and that we're now
[1:57:50] enjoying
[1:57:51] can i get an amen
[1:57:53] these things that we're now seeing
[1:57:57] that the world is laughing at this great
[1:58:00] momentous power of the holy spirit that
[1:58:02] can change a sinner's heart that can
[1:58:05] take a lukewarm church member and give
[1:58:07] him a testimony that will set the church
[1:58:09] of fire from where he come out of it's
[1:58:12] the dynamic that got into
[1:58:15] the word
[1:58:17] now i'm closing with this
[1:58:19] you see the prophet of god said that the
[1:58:21] pharisees and sadducees could not
[1:58:22] recognize him because
[1:58:24] they didn't understand
[1:58:26] that he was to come a son of man
[1:58:29] you see
[1:58:30] they didn't understand what moses meant
[1:58:33] when he said the lord thy god shall
[1:58:34] raise up a prophet like and unto me
[1:58:38] so many has missed him today because
[1:58:40] they have not understood
[1:58:42] when jesus said so shall it be at the
[1:58:44] revealing of the son of man that this is
[1:58:47] not just a man this is elohim
[1:58:51] is that okay
[1:58:55] we are not just in the presence of a man
[1:58:58] this is not a human being
[1:59:01] this is the person of elohim
[1:59:04] [Applause]
[1:59:06] this is the person that wants to visit
[1:59:08] you in your seat
[1:59:10] this is elohim the self-existing one
[1:59:13] before there was even a molecule yet by
[1:59:16] this power of his word he said let there
[1:59:20] be
[1:59:20] [Music]
[1:59:21] [Applause]
[1:59:23] we are in the presence of the one who
[1:59:26] can change circumstances in a manner of
[1:59:31] just a millisecond
[1:59:36] get your eyes off of the impossibilities
[1:59:38] and get your eyes upon elohim
[1:59:42] get your eyes upon christ
[1:59:45] the anointed one the lord himself which
[1:59:48] is the dynamics which is the person of
[1:59:50] the holy ghost who is anointing your
[1:59:53] life to bring about a manifestation of
[1:59:57] every promise for this last days
[2:00:00] it's not you

[2:00:15] impregnate you
[2:00:17] you must receive him
[2:00:20] and to them who receive him is given
[2:00:23] power to become manifested sons
[2:00:28] adopted sons
[2:00:30] mature sons who can handle the word
[2:00:34] who left to christ the one who has been
[2:00:37] transfigured before them and said i'll
[2:00:40] follow him
[2:00:41] i'm following him to my body change i am
[2:00:44] following him to the millennium i'm
[2:00:47] following him to the merit supper i will
[2:00:49] not leave him i follow him through my
[2:00:53] soul of it

[2:01:01] you see
[2:01:03] the prophet of god in the presence of
[2:01:05] god unrecognized

[2:01:11] that he is appearing to us in these
[2:01:14] meetings

[2:01:19] because he is here
[2:01:21] meeting us appearing to us in these
[2:01:23] meetings
[2:01:27] for what purpose
[2:01:30] that's to release our desires
[2:01:33] that we have in him to us
[2:01:39] but we've got to recognize his presence
[2:01:42] and now how you recognize his presence
[2:01:45] is when the promised word for this age

[2:02:30] got a little bit less for jesus

[2:02:36] lesser jesus
[2:02:39] when we heard it i don't know which one
[2:02:41] of the brothers said it but the same
[2:02:43] jesus

[2:12:28] the prophet of god said that we are
[2:12:31] priests
[2:12:32] unto our high priest
[2:12:34] and we come into the house of god

[2:14:51] bridegroom is over the pride the same
[2:14:54] spirit that raised christ if it dwells
[2:14:57] in you it'll quicken
[2:15:00] it'll quick it

[2:15:18] [Applause]
[2:15:22] a garment of praise
[2:15:25] for the spirit of heaviness
[2:15:28] that they might be called trees of
[2:15:31] righteousness
[2:15:32] the planting of the lord
[2:15:35] that he might be glorified where have we
[2:15:37] found that at psalms the first chapter
[2:15:40] the trees of righteousness that is going
[2:15:42] to bring forth three destinative fruit
[2:15:47] it's going to be god's fruit in the
[2:15:49] prophet season and it's going to
[2:15:51] manifest trees of righteousness branches
[2:15:54] that are men of plot manifesting
[2:15:56] pentecostal fruit
[2:16:00] that is not looking at a jesus in a day
[2:16:03] gone by but a jesus that is living in
[2:16:06] them saying i have been planted to bring
[2:16:08] forth fruit of jesus christ in my life
[2:16:13] what are you looking for
[2:16:19] let the musicians come
[2:16:21] [Applause]
[2:16:26] he's here
[2:16:32] i was reading where the prophet says god
[2:16:35] wants to be manifested
[2:16:39] this day we have seen god express
[2:16:42] his desire to be seen
[2:16:45] to be known
[2:16:47] to vindicate his presence
[2:16:50] with great pleasure
[2:16:53] god has
[2:16:54] proved his word
[2:16:57] to those ordained to see it
[2:17:00] the world won't see me
[2:17:02] but you'll see me
[2:17:06] because i live
[2:17:08] you'll live also
[2:17:11] look
[2:17:12] see his word made manifest
[2:17:15] and you'll live
[2:17:17] amen
[2:17:19] now
[2:17:21] you see if you can see him if you can
[2:17:23] see that manifested word
[2:17:26] it'll release the desires that you have
[2:17:30] what are you looking for
[2:17:34] you see whatever you're looking for is
[2:17:37] coming from a need in your own life
[2:17:41] maybe you're needing deliverance and so
[2:17:43] you're looking to him
[2:17:44] and saying lord
[2:17:46] i'm looking to you
[2:17:48] to find deliverance
[2:17:51] maybe you need healing so
[2:17:54] the message is focused you down now
[2:17:57] he said if you can look to the word and
[2:17:58] believe it
[2:18:00] by his stripes you are healed
[2:18:04] you need the holy ghost
[2:18:07] and you look to acts the second chapter
[2:18:09] that this promises
[2:18:11] is unto you
[2:18:13] and to your children
[2:18:15] and to them that are far off
[2:18:18] you see repent be baptized in the name
[2:18:20] of the lord jesus christ and you shall
[2:18:23] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[2:18:27] brother branham says that
[2:18:29] what i've seen in my own ministry seen
[2:18:31] him done
[2:18:33] you compile the volumes on this platform
[2:18:35] here

[2:18:39] do just in my own ministry seen him do
[2:18:41] it
[2:18:42] he had more success in my ministry than
[2:18:45] he did in his own
[2:18:46] this is right this is recording now
[2:18:49] remember
[2:18:50] he had more success now not me

[2:18:57] bridegroom his whole
[2:18:59] his whole vision his whole goal is just
[2:19:03] to get the bride to fall in love
[2:19:06] with christ
