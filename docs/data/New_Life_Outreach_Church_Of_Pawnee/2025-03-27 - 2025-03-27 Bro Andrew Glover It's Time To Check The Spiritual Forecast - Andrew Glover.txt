want to try to put together on either Friday or Saturday um volleyball tournaments and things of that nature so there's going to be a lot of a wonderful time how how many went over and got to see the uh the the uh gymnasium huh oh my I no no standing ovation amen now we were all prepared this time so that we would you know it's it's rained every year for the Oklahoma Camp all of these years for the last what five years so we finally get us a covered gymnasium and the sun is shining amen so we should have done that a long time ago but um all right um so now we this this being a new Campground uh they don't know you and and uh you know we don't know them very well they don't know us and so we want to respect one another uh there there there's just no no one in that sound booth whatsoever and we are asking uh uh they they don't want no one up here on the on the platform and so uh we we just want to uh we want to leave a really good impression uh with this Camp because hey if they like us they might let us come back next year and uh uh so y'all y'all help us out there with that I know in the other times we've just let y'all all come to the Tabernacle and and everyone had Jam sessions but that's just not an option this year and U so we just apologize ahead of time uh we don't we don't know what what the future will hold maybe next year things will be a little bit different but um this year we just this is this is what we've got so can I hear a great big amen all right all right so uh one other thing I want to talk to the non-campers and this is this is going to be a little bit different than any camp that that uh maybe that you've been to um but due to the campground policy um we're where you're not going to the non-campers are not going to be able to to go through the chow line over here and um and and get your food um so what we have done is for all of you that that uh you know you you that are supporting our youth and coming to the services after each of the morning Services we are going to open up the concession stand and um you're going to get a choice you can you can uh uh buy either you know a couple hot dogs and and we'll just throw in a bag of chips and and a drink with that or uh pulled pork sandwiches uh they've smoked some pulled pork and uh uh so there'll be there'll be that so all of you uh non-campers will still be able to grab you a little something here and um um but you're not going to be able to eat the delicious camp food and so uh so that's that's just um amen so we we hate to inform you but I but I have a feeling you're probably going to really enjoy that that pulled pork sandwich amen let's see um so we we're going to have our daily schedules that's going to be coming up uh the every every service you'll you'll

believe God and believe his word and how many here tonight believes he's able to do anything am amen he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or than Amen to think tonight that we've not gathered here in vain but we've gathered here on purpose and as I just play that Softly on the first night of this meeting maybe we just buy our hearts together for a word of prayer how many would say Lord on this first night I consecrate my life to you I dedicate myself to you for these meetings Lord let this be more than just another Youth Camp but Lord let this be a visitation in your presence almighty God is As We Gather here tonight on the first night of these meetings Lord your children have gathered here from the East the West the north the South Lord they've gathered from close and they've gathered from afar but Lord we've not come here because we're drawn by an attraction of a man but Lord we've gathered here because your word said wherever the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered together and Lord these are more than just young people living in Le oysa but Lord these are eagles of your word father that have been born from your word and lord they're not just here tonight Desiring a little sermon or a little feeling or a good idea but Lord they've got to have the meat of your word to overcome the age that they're living in and Lord as we come here tonight we pray that your anointing would descend into this building Lord may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit oh God lord may as we come on the first night of these meetings Lord may we find ourselves in your presence Lord conditioning in our hearts and our spirits to receive from you Lord father May may you come among us this weekend in the power of your Resurrection oh God lord may you drive out things in our lives that don't belong there Lord and replace it with the things of your word Lord I pray if there be one young person here tonight that don't know you Lord may this be the meeting oh God may this be the night Lord they would meet you father Lord if there's one here tonight that don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire lord I pray this be the night you open the windows of Heaven Lord and you fill them with the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord father if there's one growing cold on you here tonight May a cold of fire come up off the altar Lord may it touch their lips oh God and may you drive back the things of the world that may be dampering the fire oh God lord may this be a change of life here tonight father we submit ourselves unto you forgive us of our failes and our shortcomings Lord draw us into thy presence tonight by Your Word we commit these meetings this weekend everything that's said and done into thy faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen how many's happy to be at Camp again amen amen one more time the Lord the Lord has allowed us together here one more time amen want to say God bless you all tonight it is a real honor and the privilege to be here with you once again and want to thank you brother Wendell for the invitation to come the opportunity to be here and the church here in PA NE we thank you for the burden and the vision of these meetings and amen just getting used to the new Campground and amen we know the the Lord has something good in store for us here this weekend amen if you have your Bibles tonight I know it's the first night we want to go straight to the word of the lord we want to turn to the Book of Matthew The Book of Matthew the 16th chapter and then we're going to go to Proverbs and also the Book of Revelation amen but we want to turn first to Matthew chapter 16 and we want to say Amen we we thank the local church for all the work and effort and amen to put this together and amen I believe the souls of of Believers will be changed here this weekend amen amen Matthew chapter 16 and I want to look in the first verse of Matthew 16 the Bible here says the Pharisees also with the Sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from Heaven he answered and said unto them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is is red and luring oh ye Hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the time look here in verse four a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas and he left them and departed now in the Book of Proverbs the 29th chapter Proverbs 29 I want to look in the 18th verse it's a very familiar reading in Proverbs 29 in verse 18 Solomon here writing he says where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he amen where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he and one of the place I want to look is in the Book of Revelation The Book of Revelation chapter 10 a very another very familiar scripture I believe it's one of the uh anthems of the Believers in this hour Revelations chapter 10 and verse number s you love the Lord tonight amen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound somebody say sound when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophets the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here tonight I I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moments here this evening if I would if I would take a a title or take a thought with you tonight I want to speak to you for a few moments on this it's time to check the spiritual forecast amen it's time to check the spiritual forecast I believe tonight that we have all gathered here amen under great and spiritual expectations how many's gathered here amen under great and spiritual expectations amen not just the expectations of a preacher or the expectations of a church but we've gathered here under spiritual expectations which we know amen those expectations have to come from God and you know as I was just U maybe share a little bit of inspiration with you here on this thought I just a few weeks ago there at my house we were I was doing some work in my office and I was changing the the flooring there in my office and I was actually taking some some out putting some new in and there was a brother from a church there coming over to help me and and I I just thought in my mind this is the time to do it let's get it done and I was just making all these plans and we were going to do it on this day and these conditions and and I was actually talking to Brother John Scott there and he told me he said now you you you might need to check he said the the forecast he said see if it's going to be hot or cold now here I'm thinking we're just going to change out some floor amen now we're not doing anything outside so really how important amen is the forecast or the weather conditions for a task like this and when I looked at the forecast it was going to be really cold and he actually said this he said you know he said if we put it in there and it's too cold the floor won't acclimate right so we got to wait till the weather's right and as I begin to think about that it just struck me amen how much a forecast affects amen parts of our lives that really our minds will never even begin to believe amen that that really affects what we're going to do and you know when you look here at this word forecast it means a prophecy or an estimate or it is a prediction of a future happening amen or conditions it is to predict or to estimate amen a future event or Trend now I love this it is to indicate as likely to occur amen so when you have a forecast you are prophesying or you are making a declaration that something amen is not might happen or could happen but there is a very good possibility amen that it's going to occur when you look at that word forecast amen it means to articulate or to calculate the future now brother br will say this and we have seen his star amen and have come to worship Him He said what is a vision a vision is the forecast amen of future event see it foretells the thing before it happens he said that's the way God always Vindicated whether it was true or not whether the man that was in the Old Testament was supposed to be a prophet amen what he said come to pass amen then they know if this man said this amen it kept constantly coming to pass he said now that man cannot just be hands laid on him or shook up and give a gift see he is born with a gift amen it is born in him when he's born amen before he's born amen so if a prophet amen is a real god- sent prophet amen he don't wake up one morning and decide amen today I'm going to be a prophet amen but before he was born God already deposited something on the inside of him to make him what God ordained him to be Amen in the hour that he was living in and I'll just goad and say it amen if you are a part of this prophecy amen you didn't wake up one morning and decide amen I'm going to be a part of the Bride amen but if you ever was a Son of God Amen you always were a Son of God if you ever was a daughter of God you always were a daughter of God Amen God already predicted what you would be amen before you was ever even born brother BR said it beautifully he said yesterday's Luther's manner amen would not work for methodus methodus Mana would not work for Pentecost and Pentecostal Mana amen will not work for today see what I mean amen every day it comes day by day fresh and so it has amen Through the Ages Luther's manner amen was the message of justification when ley's manner was the manifestation of sanctification amen Pentecostal was the restoration of the gifts he said but this is introducing amen The Headstone the last day the brid tree amen which is contrary to all of it see amen it's the same light for the matured he said you cannot go against God's nature he's got a law and to contrary that amen will kill your plant amen you've got to go according to God's spoken laws amen and his laws is his word word amen can I say this his vision is his word amen his forecast is his word and any law is a word spoken and a word is a thought manifested see amen now we know that's the truth amen a vision is what it's the word of God or something foretold amen or a forecast of an event and the vision that the prophets had Jesus had Paul had all of them amen tell of this day amen was a forecast of what would happen and here see the forecast being made manifest amen and people don't even recognize it amen whether you want to believe it or not amen Paul spoke of this Youth Camp amen whether you want to believe it or not Zachariah prophesied amen of this Youth Camp whether you want to believe it or not amen Ezekiel and Moses and Jeremiah amen they spoke of you and they spoke of this meeting amen because it was not the ideas of a man it was the forecast of God listen God was going to do something and he wanted somebody to witness what he was going to do in the hour he was going to do it I say this God has g a forecast for this meeting this weekend amen God is going to heal somebody amen he's going to save somebody he's going to deliver somebody listen the forecast to this meeting says somebody is going to get the Holy Ghost the forecast to this meeting said somebody is going to meet God in a way that they've never met him before hey this is more than just a bunch of board and Camp directors amen putting an agenda together this is a prophesied agenda of almighty God from before the foundation of the world yes sir he said I'll begin to notice at the preaching of those seven Church Ages which is the pattern amen or the forecast of all amen that God was going to do for the churches amen and through the churches amen and positionally setting them up I love what he says here in the Old Testament alone it's more than 2,000 times that those prophets said thus saith the Lord he said now if a man says thus sayith the lord it's not the man talking if he would he wouldn't be a prophet he'd be a hypocrite see cause it would never come to pass there's one chance out of 1000,000 times amen see they might guess it but if it's thus sayith the Lord amen the Lord God has said it amen if it's thus saith the Lord amen the Lord God has said it listen folks this is not amen thus saith Andrew cover or thus sayith wend Martin or any other preacher amen this is thus saith the Lord can I tell you this meeting amen is not built upon the shifting Sands amen of man's ideas this meeting is not built upon the traditions of a religion this meeting is built upon thus sayith the Lord and I want to tell that devil tonight come hell or high water we're going to break out of every tradition we're going to break out of every form we didn't come here for just another meeting we come here to step into the the position that God give us from before the foundation of the world if it's thus sayith the Lord God has said it and these men being prophets they said it's not me I have nothing to do with it amen it's thus sayith the Lord I love this so the Bible amen is thus saith the Lord by the prophets the Bible is thus saith the Lord amen by the prophets he said notice they took Christ Spirit upon themselves and they forecast the events that would come to pass he said talk about forecast they said what would take place down Through the Ages as they sat they stood they laid amen they walked with the spirit of Christ upon them in so much that they acted like Christ and the readers would read it and they would think that the prophets amen was speaking of themselves amen they come under such an inspiration amen of the prophecy that when they begin to say things people actually begin to think hey they're not talking about somebody else amen they're talking about themselves can I tell you Paul prophesied I know it's the first night but I feel like preaching Paul prophesied and he said there's going to be somebody alive and remain at the coming of the Lord listen Paul's not alive tonight amen them Corinthians thought he was talking about him but he was not talking about them he was talking about you who would be alive at the time when the headstone would come to the church and there would be a bride on the earth who would move from religion and they would move into reality they would become the word by the message of the hour listen Paul wasn't talking about himself he was talking about you yes sir amen see what it was it was prophecy it came not in Old Time by the will of man amen but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost somebody say prophecy amen prophecy is the Divine mind in the message it is the rising of the sun he said prophecy if it's the true word of God Amen it can not fail my that makes me want to stop there and Shout brother Sean if it's the word of God if it's true prophecy it cannot fail if God said there's going to be a bride it cannot fail if God said somebody was going to overcome Le of see it cannot fail if God said in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh listen folks the devil can do whatever he wants to but he cannot cause this word to fail because this is not the saith William Brandon this is not thus saith any message preacher this is thus saith God God has said there will be somebody who will be so full of the Holy Ghost till the devil don't know what to do with them God has said I will pour out my spirit I will shake him and I will shake off the traditions and I will birth a young person I will take him Beyond feelings I will take him Beyond emotions I will take them Beyond sensation I will take them into prophecy and I will show them their position the same way I showed their Prophet hallelujah hallelujah don't you ever forget you're a part of Malachi 4 don't you ever forget it's not just Elijah it's behold I God will send you Andrew Glover will send you young people amen Elijah William Mary and brandom the prophet before the great and coming Dreadful day of the Lord amen if it's a prophecy it's the true word and it cannot fail now let me say this there is a natural forecast and there is a spiritual forecast when we think of the word forecast we automatically think amen of the of the of the word uh of the weather forecast right when you think of forecast you automatically think of the weather forecast now I'll say this no doubt amen thank you buddy no doubt amen uh some if not all amen have checked the weather forast this weekend Oh three of you amen four of you now you know why you check that forecast is in order to make preparations come on folks in order to make preparation for when you get here listen so that tells me the forecast amen affects the way you dress the forecast affects the things you wear amen the forecast affects the way you act come on church amen if it's going to rain amen you don't bring short sleeves you bring a rain coat amen if it's going to snow amen you don't bring a amen you don't bring jogging pants you bring snow clo are you hearing me am then then listen the forecast has spoke over this age and it said this there's going to be a bride and she's going to be without spot without wrinkle without blemish or any such thing listen we don't have to come into this age unprepared God has sent a message we're not a bunch of church members looking for something to wear we have received the message of the hour it is the close of the word and a prophet said if she'll stand still long enough I will dress her in this word come on young people there's got to come a time amen that Youth Camp becomes more than just a bunch of emotion a bunch of a bunch of getting together and seeing each other there's got a time that this Youth Camp becomes the dressing of the young people of this generation and you're looking at one preacher that will not replace Revelation with some feeling or some gift or some emotion we have got the clothes Amen to wear in this age where we will not be identified as a layout of sin we will be identified as a word born bride I'm sorry I may be in Leota but I'm not of Leota the Bible speaks of this forecast when you think of that when you think of that weather forecast in Matthew 16 amen as well amen is Luke 12 you see the Bible speaking of a weather forecast amen spoke of in the Bible amen is dealing with the ability Amen to forecast the weather amen but they lack spiritual discernment amen they're able to tell you amen when the evening's coming the weather will be fair and when it's going to be when it's it's going to be stormy the weather will be like this but look here amen I'll say this to you young people if you're going to make it out of Leota you must have spiritual discernment if you're going to make it out of Satan's heeden you're going to have to have spiritual discernment that's why Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2:14 he said the natural man amen receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolish unto him neither can he know them listen because they are spiritually discerned when you look there at that word spiritually it means by the aid of the Holy Ghost when you look there at the word discerned it means to estimate it means to determine the Excellence or defects of any person or thing in 2 Timothy 3:5 Paul says they will have a form of godliness but they will deny amen the power thereof and look what he says he says from such turn away ream comes along and said Paul promised it in the last day by the holy spirit that the church would fall away millions of them there will come of falling away see amen watch the next verse they will have a form of godliness but they will deny the power thereof he said see no spiritual discernment when you got spiritual discernment and the Holy Ghost is upon you you have spiritual discernment and it says Amen to every promise amen of God he said Paul said those days would be and we've got it it's here it's on us and we look and see it amen we hear it from everywhere amen and what do we do amen it ought to draw us together when you begin to see these things happening that's not the time to pull away and take a different direction on the message that's the time to come together and everybody get under one voice and that's not a preacher or a pastor that is the seventh angel his name is William Mary and brandom and I refuse to introduce any other voice to this young people of we have a voice and it's a Vindicated voice and it's a voice of authority it's a voice of it's a voice of accuracy there's no voice amen like that voice there is no guesswork in that voice there is no I think so I feel so I see so you might be know there is thus sayith the Lord or he didn't say anything at all I say it's time to get away and forget man May Theology and cry out to God amen for spiritual discernment listen this is not the generation that's going to go amen into the depths of perversion this is the generation that is seen the revealing of the son of man Jesus prophesied that the conditions of Sodom and Gomorrah listen they would return in the days when the son of man would be revealed when Jesus forecast this age he give a forecast of what Sodom and Gomorrah would look like he said as it was in the days of Sodom he said the police and the homicides just go on all the time breaking up boys amen living together as husband and wife women living the same way amen perverted amen and their minds are filthy Minds now why are their minds filthy because they don't have amen spiritual discernment all is a lust and a filth they can't satisfy themselves even with one another see he said they don't marry they just take up and go out until they're perverted and Jesus said it would be in the last days now here's a prophet and here it is amen you ever see a weather man amen a few days ago in Arkansas we had tornadoes come through there it took a weather man to stand there and say there it is right there it is here it's coming it's headed this way and a prophet stood in this generation and he trace the spirit of perversion all the way back to the Garden he traced the spirit of perversion all the way back to Sodom and Gomorrah and he said when you see these things that ain't the time to put your head down that's the time to put your shouting shoes on that's the time time to lift up your head for your Redemption is drawing nigh listen the whole world may be filthy but there's a bride who's going to be clean by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word of almighty God hey the whole world may be headed to Sodom and gor but there's another prophecy concerning you there's another Vision there's another forecast and it's come from the revealing of the son of man spiritual discernment amen is not guessing what is right and what is wrong spiritual discernment is standing there knowing what is right and what is wrong see I'll say this it takes spiritual discernment to know what truth is it takes spiritual discernment to know what error is in John chapter 8 Jesus said he shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free not going to set you free the truth is going to make you free brother said if you see God's word and still don't think it's the truth then there's something wrong with your spiritual discernment 1960 former and latter rign any man could read a newspaper if he's got any spiritual discernment about him at all he can see that we're at the end how many agrees we're at the end listen folks we're not promised another Camp we're not prom we're not even promised another service he said the hour is here and there is nothing left amen for us but the coming of the Lord Jesus some people go out and say oh that might be a thousand years from today I don't believe that I believe this generation will see the coming of the Lord and listen what he says if this generation doesn't do it he said I want to preach to the young people amen if this generation don't see it I want to preach to the young people amen that they'll be looking for it in their generation listen if Paul didn't see it he prophesied of it and brother said if I don't see it I'm going to keep on preaching to the young people cuz somebody sooner or later is going to see the Fulfillment of the changing of our bodies listen folks it could happen right here in this meeting this weekend I know it's the first night but I feel like preaching hey our dead loved ones could come walking right in this building your grandma and grandpa could come walking right in this building this weekend this is not a limited meeting this is not a limited generation this is a generation who has SA underneath the voice of the son of man and the word has been solded into their hearts and they know what to look for they know where to turn their attention to see what's happened the generation will not pass till all things be fulfilled I love that I want to preach to the young people brother W I sat there today and I said Lord you give me that privilege tonight amen through our brother window I want to preach to the young people people in other words I want to give them a spiritual forecast I want to prophesy to them I want to tell them about their future I want to tell them that the world is becoming full of crime and Corruption I want to tell them that Sodom has come back in their age I want to tell them that perversion is swept over homes but I also want to tell them they're an invincible Army I want to tell them the word is in them by the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes sir Prophet tells us he tells us these things now I love brother bram's quotes he said God promised prophets in the last days God promised prophets in the last days Exodus 23:20 behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared Malachi 4 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and F day of the Lord can I read you the forecast and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse do you realize Paul come along in Ephesians four and he said he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teacher amen for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry amen for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all somebody shout all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now listen I know somebody say well this is a youth camp so we just need to we just need to get an experience I believe in experiences but somewhere or another there's got to come some word amen over that experience to where you can whip the devil when you leave Youth Camp listen there's got to come somewhere that you come to a stability that the first mistake you make you ain't got to go get saved again and get baptized again you can stand there knowing that there is an advocate between you and the father and there is an atonement listen in other words can I just say what brother said an adopted church amen a church that knows their position in the word you say well that's a bunch of preachers I beg to differ with you I think that's some young men I think that's some young ladies I think there's some young people right here tonight that can meet God this weekend that your life will never be the same again I believe you can come to such a place of stability that the devil can't back you up because you know your place in the forecast that you would be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunny craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love that you may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ now brother said if a man comes he has a great gift no matter if he belongs to our denomination or another denomination you don't judge him by what denomination he come from how he dresses but what you want to see is what is he trying to do with his gift what purpose he has if he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name out of it he said I'd have discernment of spirit enough to know amen that's wrong no matter how great a teacher is how powerful he is is how intellectual he is or even how his gift operates if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of Christ your own spiritual discernment would tell you that that's wrong no matter how accurate how perfect how it is amen if it's wrong it isn't useful amen for the body of Jesus Christ listen we're not here amen trying to build you to myself or to build you to brother Timothy or to build you to any other preacher I have but one motive and one to objective and that is to build up your faith in the message of the hour and I want to get you so in love with this message it don't matter what anybody says what anybody teaches what anybody thinks you'll stand there and say that's not what brother brandham said and ask for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord come on I tell you amen this is more than just young people young people grow up and get married and young people grow up and get married and have kids and start families listen I think God can give you such a word foundation in these youth camps amen that when the enemy comes in like a flood hey the spirit of the Lord will raise a standard against him you say why are you saying that because this is a Joshua Generation Church it's a Joshua generation you know what the prophet said he said Joshua was the new leader he said and he positionally placed amen the tribes of Israel and he divided the land of inheritance amen by spiritual discernment hey Joshua stood there Amen brother and he divided the land and he placed them by spiritual discernment brother says this and there they remained in their place and they became the cream of the crop Oh Glory when Joshua put them in their place by the leadership of the Holy Ghost hey they remain there and they became the cream of the crop you say what is spiritual discernment brother REM says it's spiritual re reation of God watch what he says in Matthew 16 he says flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you did not learn it through an educational line or denominational line see amen Flesh and Blood revealed this not to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you look and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it listen will never be able to Prevail can I say this to you you are a part of the Church of the firstborn you are a part of the generation of the upright you are a part of the original creation amen the sons of God that were shouting for God they were shouting for Joy come on when were they doing this from before the foundation of the world Listen the pr of God said see then the Gates of Hell will never Prevail he said now watch and see where somebody say where where the gate G of hell is against it's not against denomination the government recognizes that the world recognizes them we have the right each one of us as American citizens have the right amen of denomination which is fine see but that's not what the gates of hell is against and come on somebody tell me amen what is the Gates of Hell against you brother bam tells us the gates of hell is against the spiritual revelation of Christ being here now the same yesterday today and forever listen listen that's what it's against what is Hell against hell is not against this building church it's not against these instruments it's not against this microphone it's against the Revelation that Jesus Christ is here and he's here in bright form he's here in every one of you young people he is here amen listen I can say what a prophet said that's where the church is missing it today it's that spiritual discernment to see amen what God's a doing not what God has done brother Matt or what God will do amen what is God a doing well I feel good and they look way over the top for something here that's going on right here listen and it'll be past you before you even know it let me say what a prophet said about 77 times in the message he screams out don't miss it he's screaming don't miss it in other words they're saying something's coming and he's saying don't miss it brother B establishes this principle I call them spiritual principles amen one of them I like is when he says we get what we expect what about this one he said man is now like he's always been he's praising God for what he's done and looking forward to what he will do and ignoring what he has done and is doing he Praises God for what he has done he looks forward to what he will do but he ignores what God is doing and there he misses the whole thing see ignoring what he is doing you say well he's healing brother so and so and he's saving sister so and so and he gave so and so the Holy Ghost and the power of God fell on brother so and so and amen and you're still missing what God is doing you say how can you say that because you're looking oh God how can I say this you're living in the moment and looking for something to come listen what he said he said he knows what has done and he knows the promise what he will do but he fails to see what he's doing spiritual Amnesia now may he and his power come through this audience of people wherever you are and with his spiritual discernment amen showing you that he is the word may our lord Jesus the god of the Bible may he come into this audience this weekend and may He Go from the right to the left from the front to the back from the puppet to the music from the music to the altar from the altar to the P may he go all over this place and may He shake you Amen to realize that this is more than just a religion this is more than just a good idea this is a vision from almighty God this is a forecast and you're in it you say brother Andrew we're looking for vision let me say this very plainly we are not looking for a vision we're looking at a vision we have have a vision Solomon said where there is no vision amen the people perish look at this word Vision it is an oracle it is a prophecy amen it is divine communication brother says this what is the sear what is the vision it's another dimension see it's outside the five he said it's a six sense look at another place what is a vision someone has asked me many times brother brandham are you impressed to say a certain thing do you just think it in your mind no sir I see it it's just there it's like I'm looking at you just the same as you are only you know you're standing here yet you may be 40 years back in somebody's life amen seeing what taking place even see them the way they're dressed oh God the way they're dressed positionally and everything he said what is a vision a vision is God by a word of knowledge dropping to the person Amen to foresee or foresee something it tells something that has been or something that will be I love what Peter says are you still with me in 1 Peter 4:11 he says if any man speak then let him speak as the Oracles of God if any man Minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth listen we're not looking for human ability and I'll tell you what human ability is it's human Impressions trying to help people we don't need human Impressions we don't need human ideas we need thus sayth the Lord what can I say something we've got thus sayith the Lord we've got 1,00 books and tapes and not one time will you find one mistake WIll you find one misconstruing because every time he spoke it was thus sayeth the Lord because it was not a man it was the spirit of Truth and if you're going to have a message meeting Amen Let the spirit of Truth be the special speaker let the spirit of Truth be the guest preacher because he's the only one that has the ability to show you where you come from to show you where you're standing but he can also tell you where you're going and I've been listening to the voice of the seventh angel today and you know what he said he said we're going home we're going in the Rapture we're going to change our bodies the old is going to become young you know what he said he said miracles and signs and wonders were going to be wrought if a man Minister let him minister is the ability which God give listen that God in all things may Glory ified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and Dominion forever and ever amen I love this word oracles it is a brief utterance it is a Divine Oracle in the New Testament it is the words or the utterances of God it is of the contents of the Mosaic law said now Lord are you with me the Great Dark Hours has come at the end time help us now tonight in this service that God's great spirit might come down visible among men every person in here might know that he's standing near them oh God take the Clay the voice of mortal beings and Speak Lord the Oracles of God that people might see and fear God and serve him another place he said may we speak of the Oracles of God lord not overbearing but talk in wisdom that we might know how to win others to you another place blessed father we're indeed grateful to thee for this time of Fellowship together around the word and these holy Oracles of God and may as we partake of them now let me ask you this how do you partake of the Oracles of God Amen by the reading and the hearing and may the Holy Spirit Inspire them to our hearts that when we leave today we could say like folks from EMAs it was good for us to be here and did not our hearts oh God did not our hearts burn within us amen because he talked to us in the way oh I pray when you leave this Youth Camp it'll be another mayus road walk home you'll be able to say did not our hearts hey burn within us not as a preacher talked to us but as the spirit of Truth came down and begin to commune with our souls oh he said now now I just I just love this we're a Joshua generation right we got land to possess we got inheritance you say brother Andrew how are we going to take it brother BR gives us the answer he said Joshua took the Oracles of God and marched over into the promised land Joshua took them books and tapes he took them words and he took those scriptures and he marched over into the promised land for the first time brother Ronnie he had some Uncle he had something amen that could not talk him out of his position can I say this to you and the message of the hour is the only only thing that will bind that HIIT and will bind that jebusite and will bind that amorites and that Philistine amen from talking you out of your position hey I say I pray tonight you get so full of a love for this message you start marching around in the promised land and that first devil of condemnation and that first devil of guilt and that first devil of unbelief raises its head I pray you stand there like Joshua and say go find somebody else big boy I'm not under guesswork I'm not under impressions I have been here because thus saith the Lord this is where I belong I don't belong in feelings I don't belong in emotions and Sensations I belong in the message of the hour and that is thus sayith the Lord hallelujah somebody shout my position my position can I say this it sure by the message now I just got to say what brother Remy said I want to get you built up now in this holy Oracles of God in the faith of this hour see it's going to take more faith in any age for this has to be rapturing Faith to be taken up so our vision is the Oracles of God it's the spiritual forecast can I say it brother Ben it's the message of the hour if you want to know what God thinks about you go hear what the seventh angels said if you want to know what God thinks about your life go hear what the prophet said oh my my my my my you say preacher you're getting way out there well let me just ask you how can you have a weather forecast without a weather man and how can you have a message without a messenger and I might as well say it how can you have a prophecy without a prophet I'm not looking for a prophet I'm looking at the prophecy because I've already heard the prophet I'm not looking for a message message I'm looking at the message cuz I've already heard the messenger surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his Secrets unto his servants the prophets I love what BR says he said the prophet is a special man he's a man of whom the word of the Lord comes to because the prophet is so designed life that his subconscious and his first conscience is so close together that he doesn't go to sleep to dream his dream he sees it when he's wide awake I love this brother Wendell a prophet Force his way off he sees things that's coming he sees the cup of God's Wrath full before it's filled and he can say thus sayith the Lord he says God will destroy this city except you repent why he's an eagle he rides way in Yonder see and he looks way off there and he sees that Cup of Wrath poured out that's what the prophets look at he ain't looking at what's going on here well somebody shout hallelujah he ain't looking at what's going on here he's looking Yonder and here's what he's saying it's coming it's coming see he can go so high till he can see that shade he said the world will be dark gross Darkness he's up high enough that the sun's are shining now but he sees the shades are coming and he's saying what he's looking at are y'all ready for this are you ready he says it ain't here yet but it'll sure be here woo Glory he can see see it above brother Wesley he can see it Beyond any Pastor he can see it Beyond any evangelist he can see it Beyond any missionary he can climb up into the presence of God and he can say I see a young person in the last days I see somebody hey living this word and then he climbs back down and he records it on books and tapes and we begin to read it and one day brother we say hey that's me that's me I was the one he seen with my foot on the head of the day I was the one in seen that was so full of the Holy Ghost I am a part of the forecast come on over here come on over here come on out of tradition come on out of religion come on over here into the message of the hour where you can March like Joshua by the Oracles of God and say devil never again never again devil never again devil he say you lost your mind he says when he speaks that if it's in the word of the lord it's already been spoke can I just say what he said and there's nothing in the world can stop it nothing in the world can stop it that's right not even God himself woo Glory not even God God himself amen can stop you from being what he ordained you to be well I might as well have fun I'm here anyhow amen can I say this if God can't stop you then quit letting the devil tell you he's going to stop you and if God can't stop you quit letting your mistakes tell you they're going to stop you and if God can't stop you quit letting the past tell you it's going to stop you there is nothing in the past there is nothing in the present and there is nothing in the future I can say thus sayith the Lord because I Heard a Voice there is nothing can stop you from coming to your position absolutely nothing somebody shout nothing I know you're tired but shout it like you ain't been on the road for 18 hours no shout it like it's the first time you ever heard it nothing really nothing n oh better be careful n o t h i n g nothing is going to stop God nothing is going to stop you well I feel like having a good time W hey nothing is going to stop this bride well come on devil I might as well preach since I got the microphone and nothing is going to stop this meeting and nothing is going to stop breakthroughs and nothing is going to stop deliveres and nothing is going to stop Miracles I've done seen the forecast and the forecast says there's going to be joy unspeakable and full of Glory I've already read the forecast and the forecast said there's going to be an outpouring of the Holy Ghost right here this weekend I say devil get all your imps together but nothing will stop it it's already in motion it's already been spoken sorry I'm not under Moses right now on the defense I'm following Joshua I'm on the offense I've been partaken of the Oracles of God and I'm going to go ahead and March over in the promis land anybody want to go with me anybody want to go over in the land where all things are possible anybody want to go over in the land where the devil can't get to you anybody want to go over in the land where you can see who you are in the word well come on let's cross this Jordan where we going to go preacher we're going to go in the third pole where all the promises God we're laying for the Joshua generation Hallelujah this message somebody shout this message has become our leadership notice here Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relevant to the word for that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church because he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false now listen the message is then broadcast to all the message the message am I reading that right the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within Reign to that message that message is received individually by only a certain by a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger those who hear now I just got to say it those who hear are not getting their own private Revelation nor is a group getting their Collective Revelation but each person that's you young people each person is hearing and receiving what the meage messenger has already received from God I find it amazing that when you when you when you look at a forecast brother it's usually broadcast Amen in a in a in a radio form or in a paper form I'm having too much fun can I say this our spiritual forecast has been broadcast in book form see I remember when we used to shout over that point well we might as well just we might as well just barrel down here and preacher for a second see I remember when we used to shout over things and we quit trying to sit there say well who's he after what he saying what's going no let me just go ah and get it out thr in the open I'm after one person that's the devil and anything that raises its head contrary to this message I qualified as a devil and it's deserved to be stomped on and you ought to be a part of this Joshua gener and partake so much of this message that when some little idea tries to creep into your heart contrary than what a prophet said you can say devil too late I've done been in the Oracles of God I've done been over in the prophecies and I know who I am and I refuse to allow you to damper me any longer we got to lose the shame folks we got to lose the shame Heen I say this look at this word broadcast it means to transmit a program or some information by radio I I I about shouted all over that little room brother wend when I read this one when you broadcast something you're scattering seeds oh God when you broadcast something you're scattering seeds when you broadcast something you're telling somebody you know what another word for broadcast is go look it up it's the word Soul you know what Jesus said he said behold a sewer went forth to seow you know what he said and he said the seed he was sowing was the word of God and a Prophet come along and said Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled but it must be fulfilled because it's gerti word of God spoken through Malachi the prophet and Jesus referred to it he said now here it is it is to be just before the coming of Christ the second time all scripture has not been fulfilled but it must be and before that time the Bible is to be finished he said the Gentile dispensation is to be finished when this church age when this anointed messenger arrives now are can can I say what he said is that okay he said of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible when he begins to sound he's doing more than just preaching sermons he's sewing a word seed of the entire Bible all the way from the serpent to the messenger in the former Reign he said this Bible is a different book from any other sacred book book there's no Bible like it because the Bible is God in word form and any seed will bring forth of its kind if it's in the right condition in the right atmosphere now this book of Prophecy it is foretelling future events listen there's been how many's heard a sermon called spoken word is the Original Seed honestly let me see your hand if you if you've heard that sermon okay you that heard that no brother said there he said there's been three seeds swn he said there was a denominational seed he said then there was a Pentecostal seed he said and then there was a word seed listen can I say this there is a difference Amen in an Oral Roberts anointing and a William Marian brandom anointing how many's heard of Oral Roberts can I see your hand you've heard of the brother okay can I say this there's a difference in a lay out of seean Age and what a prophet said a bride age you say what's that difference here it is it's the calling out of the Bride you say what's that mean well a prophet said this in 1951 now can I say this I want you to see his ministry change he says in 1951 he said now I believe there's something coming that's going to be a double portion to the church I feel that down in my heart oh Malachi for the heart he said now my Ministry is changing 1958 he said there's something that's great and wonderful amen there's something coming but in 1962 he changes from saying brother Joel there's something coming till he says my Ministry is to declare him he's here well now we can have church now we can shout and restricted now we can have the restoration of the word now we can have everything in the Bible because there's now a Vindicated voice of authority to say what should be in the church and what should not be in the church oh he said if the great Holy Spirit the Unseen now if the senses of faith will declare him to me he brought the senses of faith and his word has brought it so close this last day till he's got the picture of it here he's brought it so close to our senses anointed has went away and seen him come in here and move around in that form of a pillar of fire hasn't he he says this now he's here I know he's here my faith says he's here now if he can just materialize himself enough in here to catch that woman's life see as he promised he would do the Holy Spirit would do the same work he did folks can I just say it there is a difference in Seeking a sign and recognizing a sign we are not a weak and wicked adulterous Generation all gathered over here in the middle of nowhere in Oklahoma trying to pray up a Revival or shout down a Revival or seek a manifestation can I say this you are the manifestation I couldn't say that before the word come open but I can say it tonight brother Andrew where is the vision behold the vision of the word seed brother Andrew was there a crop there was a crop brother Brandon if you can look over the banisters of Heaven look in this building tonight the entire word seed has been sown what are you saying I'm saying we're not looking for a move of God can I say this we're not looking for a move of God brother Bram said we know we have a move of God we know it's performing Miracles it's Healing The Sick it's even raising the dead it's casting out Devils it's speaking with tongues and interpreting tongues it sends forth prophecies and they happen now I just got to say what a prophet said he said this move of God is the word it's not just birth and Sons it's adopting Sons because a promised Prophet said it very plainly he said now see your birth is is not your adoption see because the Holy Ghost is a witness of the resurrection showing that you have become an adult in Christ see that's the prophecy over your life is you will become an adult in Christ he said now all that happens in the natural is only a type of what's going to happen on the spiritual he said this listen friends let's hear him the Holy Spirit speaking in our midst showing diverse miracles signs and wonders let's not just passed over it as just common happenings let's remember it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever confirming his word can I say something to you young people never let this message become common never let this message become common brother R said see because every spiritual happening is a sign from God now I'm I'm I'm bringing this down to you right now we're not direct quote we're not here by accident these things just don't happen by accident it's a sign it's a sign to get to safety quickly see everything the message of the hour is a sign now watch it look what it's doing if it's man-made there's nothing to it now what are these happenings these happenings are achievements said what they are amen they're modern events made clear by the prophecy he said now what's happening amen that in the natural real all the world should see this but now there's a spiritual real and we see the great happenings today what why why now now I know people say this they say why are you preaching that message of the hour why are you quoting them quotes and why is everything about a message message message well I'll just make it I'll just make it very plain for you okay we see it and we want to talk about it testing one two it's still working we see it and we want to talk about it see all that spiritual union of Christ see the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh see just what the Bible said what happen in this day it's happening day by day what now now let me just say this what Pentecostal said was going to happen can I say this it's happening in you he said it's happening right before you in the name of the Lord that's by the original word the evening time message is here somebody shout the message is here brother BR said this look at this prophecy of Isaiah and I'm going to tie this right here it's the first night I don't want to go too long Isaiah 64 and4 for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear neither have the eye seen oh God beside thee what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him in 1 Corinthians 2:9 Paul says but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have it entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him now can I can I can I can I turn a corner from the prophecy to the Fulfillment he says but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but we received the spirit which is of god listen that we might know these things that have been freely given to us of God oh young people which things also we speak not in the words of man but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual with spiritual can I say this re said it very beautiful give freedom of the spirit that your worshiping children might have the privilege tonight to enjoy the deep rich blessings of the Holy Ghost which the father has stor in them he said may they have a great unction and strength and power to bring their congregations The Waiting sheep the food that God has in store for his people come on I know we're I know we may be a little bit nervous about camp food hey but can I tell you something every message Camp serves the same food behind the pull pit it may be different in the cafeteria it it should be the same behind the pull pit it may be different in the cafeteria it may be different by the cooks but inside the house of God there is a table prepared it's a banqueting table it's not coming from the mind of a man it's coming from a gift that has been fellowshipping in the Oracles of God and they spread a table before you we don't know what he has in store for us but we do know that there must be something he's going to bring forth to us why are you saying this because the preaching of the revelation of this Vision this forecast is the transmitting of the forecast Into You Who hath believed our report who hath believed our forecast brother Sean a forecast will never affect somebody until they believe it until they begin to believe what they're reading it'll never affect them they can look at it they can hear it they can search it out but when they begin to believe it's going to rain they're going to change what they're wearing when they begin to believe it's going to be cold they're going to change what they're wearing when they believe it's going to be hot they begin to change what they're doing oh I'm done preaching I'm just having fun now I have read the forecast folks and I have changed what I'm wearing I have changed what I'm doing I have changed where I'm going listen this forecast it changed my plans it let's wait it changed my plans are you hearing me this forecast changed my plans I was born in sin I was shap in iniquity I come in the world speaking lies but one day I Heard a Voice I heard a prophet he wasn't a weather prophet he wasn't a weather man he was an angel of God and he told me you was with God in the beginning he told me I come from God and I'm going back to God brother brother trip when I heard this forecast it changed the way I worshiped when I heard this forecast brother Peter it changed the way I shouted when I heard this forecast it changed the way I preach when I heard this forecast it changed everything about me you know why because it was true it was the truth I'm sorry brother wend I see it I see what was once in God's mind what is a word it's a fault expressed what's he going to sow brother Ben he's going to s the entire word can I say this I see it now let's talk about it it's the message that transforms you folks it's time to check the spiritual forecast but I checked it for you here's what it says it's going to rain this weekend Showers of Blessings are going to fall the former and the latter rain is going to fall together I checked the forecast brother Timothy the S so is going to shine and some seeds are going to be ripened hey I check the forecast the Sun is going to rise and the shackles are going to fall off I check the forecast Church hey the Sun is going to shine and Liberty it's going to ring in every heart believer I check the forecast for the window it's going to get awful windy around here the winds are Pentecost is going to blow I check the forecast The Winds of Change it's going to blow through this building listen folks I check the forecast and the forecast means to calculate the future glory to God it's time to change what you're looking at and start talking about the future let's quit talking about what happened happened yesterday who took who seat on the bus who didn't talk to who on the van who got upset at so and so at the hotel let's forget all that and let's start talking let's start talking about the future let's start talking about Transformations let's start talking about shackles being broke let's start talking about miracles I checked the forecast [Applause] brother I say this to you can I tell you what the forecast says is that okay it says this your present conditions cannot hinder your future brother Sean I checked the forecast and our present conditions the present conditions Brother Joseph of this Humanity cannot change the prophecy of the deity what God said you're going to see you're going to see what God said you're going to be I'll shout by myself what God said you're going to be is what you're going to be I check the forecast and there's nothing the devil can do to sit you down on the sidelines and say you can't see it listen Simeon I don't care if you are 80 years old when that forecast says you're going to to see the coming of the Lord you may be 80 years old and stoop shoulders but the word of God will never fail I need I need five minutes right here to do deal to to to do war with the devil and then we'll leave okay that devil got you here and that devil says you ain't going to see nothing you ain't going to experience nothing you really don't even want to be here do you know this mistake and do you know this failure and do you know this shortcoming and you know all this do you know all these things about you you remember last year when you shouted and said it was a new day and and Camp was Camp was a turning point you remember last year do you remember you remember remember a few weeks ago when you made that mistake and remember that and now all these things are piling up in your humanity and the devil's forecasting something but can I just remind that devil something greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world greater is the prophecy greater is the word greater is the vision greater is the forecast greater is the entire word seed that has been sold in your soul than the humanity of your flesh than the failures of your teenage years if God put you in this prophecy Mah there ain't no devil taking you out if God puts your name in the Lamb's Book of Life you will step by the holy Oracles of God into your position brother the window Not only was there a Simeon there was a blind Anna and that blind Anna brother Matt she's blind blind Anna and she's telling people I'm going to see I'm going to see she's blind but brother Judah I'm going to see help me to my chair you did such and such and you went here but I'm going to see hey let's go to a restaurant Anna come on so we go to a restaurant we sit down there I'm going to see would somebody read me the menu I I'm preaching now hey let's go down here let's go down here and let's let's go let's go on vacation and let's look at something hey let's read let's read a book okay Anna says read me that book but I'm going to see I I found how let me just say wait brother said he said now here's what's happening she knows the messiah's coming and this is what I want you to catch right here he said and that little life that was in her was predicting it would be here it would be there it would be there oh glory to God when her eyes fleshly couldn't see it when her emotions and feelings couldn't see it there was a little life on the inside of her Hallelujah there was a little life brother Nathan on the inside of her and the little life that was on the inside of her was a forecast of her future listen I know you may be blind I know you may be in a bad condition but let the life on the inside of you prophesy let the life on the inside of you predict your future can I say this on the outside it says no way but on the inside it says it's already happened on the outside it says it's impossible but on the inside there is a prophecy I shall see him I shall see him oh won't you stand on your feet tonight and let the life on the inside of you predict the [Music] future that's the seat of God as our musicians come let the seat of God on the inside of your soul predict this meeting let the seat of God on the inside of you let that little life on the inside of you let it predict what will be some of y'all right here right now is already believing the devil's predictions the devil predicted before you ever even left home it's going to be another Camp he predicted it's going to be another another weekend and there's going to be preachers and there's going to be singing and people's going to get happy and they're going to shout and people are going to rejoice and this is going to happen they'll have a prayer line and and you'll go and you'll leave the same way you came no the reason he's telling you that is because there's a life on the inside of you predicting his future the life on the inside of you is not just predicting your future it's predicting your enemy's future the life on the inside of you is not just predicting your future it's predicting Lucifer's future brother Kobe what is the life on the inside of you it's the word of almighty God you know what that word says that word prophesied they shall overcome their Enemy by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony can I say this go ahead and pull the devil up right now anybody want to prophesy with me let's prophesy pull the devil up and let's tell him his future it's a lake of fire let's tell him his future it's no more tormenting me let's tell him his future his day is over let's tell him his future he had a beginning and he's going to have an end let's tell him his future there was a day he started tormenting me and there's a day he's going to end but let me tell him my future when there is no more day I'll still be when there is no more trouble I'll still be when there is no more sickness I'll still be when there is no more mind battles I'll still [Applause] be cuz I've been feeding on the holy Oracles of God and I'm marching into my position that little life on the inside of her was predicting was predicting that same life come in the building in the form of a baby an illegitimate child wrapped in his swalling clothes cut up through the building and the Holy Spirit struck that old blind woman and she come by the Spirit Led through the people and stood over this baby and said bless the mother bless the baby and told what would be the future for it see it's ordained to life what what what made you what made you desire this in the first place can I say what the prophet said he said because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed laying there it always was there and when the Rain Begin to Fall it begin to Quicken that seed and when the sun begin to shine it begin to rip in that seed want you tonight just just do something with me just say devil devil it's over I believed your forecast the last day you've made some predictions of what I'll be and what I'm going to turn out to be but I heard another prediction and it wasn't guesswork it wasn't humanistic Impressions it was thus saith the [Music] Lord when's the last time you check the spiritual forecast you check the weather but what about tonight what about tonight you say Lord tune my heart into the spiritual forecast let's bow our hearts together tonight tune My Heart Lord to the spiritual [Music] forecast Lord I've heard the devil's predictions heard what my friends say I'll be maybe what your teachers have said you'll be maybe what your school counselors have said you're going to be you've heard all those predictions and you've read them all and you've pondered on them and you've looked into them and you fed upon them and but what about tonight what about tonight you change and say Lord I'm going to read your for for and your forecast says there's a blood there's an atonement Hallelujah your forecast says I'm not a failure your forecast says I have a future your forecast says my mistakes are not determining my future my future is determined by the word seed that's been sown by a Vindicated Prophet God bless you there buddy God bless you there I see Hands going up God bless you I want to I want to feed on my I want to feed on my real forecast I want to feed on the vision that a prophet had of me I want to lay in my bed or I want to ride down the road in my car I want to I want to sit there at home in the cool of my room and I want to read these books and I want to listen to these tapes and I want to hear this forecast [Music] Hallelujah now listen we can preach it the men of God this week will preach it your counselors will preach it to you they'll talk to you about it you'll hear it all weekend long but until you begin to believe the forecast it will never affect you almighty God in this building tonight Lord as young people gathered from near and far Lord Lord maybe some of them are didn't even realize they would be here Lord maybe last minute they came Lord maybe some had been planning since last year to come back I don't know what level they're at I don't know their plans or their agendas Lord but you do and Lord I know nothing happens by accident Lord I know there's always a meaning behind something now Lord I know that devil and he he's a liar he's a deceiver and he does everything he can to predict the futures of these young people he keeps them up at night predicting their Futures he likes to take things in their family history and their family past and tied all together and give him a forecast he likes to show them all the failures and the people that started out and fell away by the wayside he likes to show them them and and try to predict their future by that but Lord I'm so thankful tonight that I have the privilege to stand here before this group of young people as your Prophet said and to preach the message in this Young Generation Lord the devils in hell can't even stop it you you can't stop it it's going to come to pass now Lord on this first night of the meeting Lord as we come to the close of this service Lord May the young people right now may they change their attention from the devil's forecast from the devil's prediction and look at the spiritual forecast maybe things have crept in their lives and spiritual discernment has become dormant and the devil's taking those things that's crept in their lives and is trying to predict their future by those things that's crept in there but tonight Lord would you let spiritual discernment arise oh God your Prophet said it's time to cry out for Spiritual power and spiritual discernment Lord would you open your word to the heart of one of these young people here tonight and take them through your forecast show them what belongs and what don't Lord have your way among them tonight Lord father May the voice of the enemy May hell's forecast may it be paralyzed right now and may the forecast of

man's imagination but the reality is when scripture has been fulfilled When God Says in Malachi that before the destruction of the earth and before we walk out on the ashes of the [Music] wicked that there would be a spirit that would come Spirit of Elijah would rest God would send a prophet and he would turn the hearts of the children that's us back to the [Music] faith of the book then we can stand flat-footed tonight whether we're having a good day that day whether we're on the mountain or in the valley there's never a question Satan isn't going to be able to take it out of us well maybe I don't have the Holy Ghost take it right back to the scripture and what did the prophet say the Holy Ghost would be well praise the Lord back in Pentecost if we weren't jumping and shouting and if my pastor wasn't seeing a vision or a prophecy over me then I then God had totally forgot about me but when I came into the message I thought I've got something greater than a prophecy or something greater than hey we're thankful for them they're wonderful but when I'm in the Valley I've got the great Shepherd [Music] when I'm in the Valley and the preacher ain't around and the youth leader
