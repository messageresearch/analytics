[23:35] this weekend and just pray Lord that you
[23:38] would be with us here tonight as we lord
[23:41] look look a little bit more into the
[23:43] church ages and just ask your Holy
[23:46] Spirit would be pleased Lord minister to
[23:49] us you be the speaker here tonight and
[23:52] that would bless our all of our hearts
[23:55] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:57] amen can the church say
[23:59] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[24:02] seated amen
[24:06] so we um we're going to going to
[24:09] minister this evening on um um we're
[24:13] just going to deal a little bit on the
[24:15] Holy Holy Spirit
[24:17] leadership and brother uh
[24:20] Harry um done a wonderful job um a
[24:24] couple Wednesday nights ago dealing with
[24:27] ncol platonism yall enjoy that brother
[24:30] Harry ministered in church
[24:33] ages and so he had he and and you know
[24:37] were the the the man taking the place of
[24:42] the Holy Ghost in the body and and
[24:46] making it a political
[24:48] Affair instead of individuals being led
[24:52] and governed by the Holy Ghost now I
[24:55] want I want us to say want us to keep in
[24:59] mind this whole the whole essence of the
[25:01] church age book is to show us where the
[25:05] life where Satan uh has has propagated
[25:10] to take the life of God out of the
[25:13] church now that's his desire now we're
[25:17] we're going to be learning doctrines
[25:18] there's going to be plenty of things as
[25:20] you as you have already been going
[25:22] through the church ages but the the
[25:25] doctrines but but you're going to see
[25:28] almost in every page the holy spirit
[25:32] amen Satan trying to anoint men to take
[25:37] the anointing and take the leadership of
[25:40] the Holy Spirit out of out of the church
[25:44] so we want we must if you don't have the
[25:48] Holy Spirit you don't have life you you
[25:51] you're not born again you're you're
[25:53] you're you're not even on first base can
[25:55] you say Amen now we're thankful for for
[25:57] justification we're thankful for
[25:59] sanctification but the ultimate goal is
[26:02] for the Holy Spirit to to f these
[26:05] Tabernacles he's not filling a
[26:07] tabernacle he's filling these
[26:10] Tabernacles and so amen um so I I I
[26:14] thought before we got into reading Amen
[26:17] brother just just a few real short um
[26:20] excerpts here from different messages
[26:22] brother Bram would say the the Holy
[26:24] Spirit was sent to lead men to be the
[26:27] wife Watchman of our soul returning
[26:30] Jubilee He says God wants to lead men
[26:33] men just can't lead
[26:36] themselves amen looking at the Unseen he
[26:39] says when God made man he made him thus
[26:43] for he made him uh a a certain
[26:46] compartment in the man for his throne
[26:49] his control tower God wants to lead man
[26:52] but man wants to lead himself therefore
[26:56] uh there is a War constantly so so we
[27:00] know that the Warfare is going on it's
[27:02] your it's your two Natures it's the
[27:04] white dog and the and the black dog it's
[27:07] the it's it's the Apostle Paul says
[27:09] within me I find two laws amen there's
[27:12] the law of life and then there is there
[27:15] is the the the the fleshly it's your
[27:17] spirit man your fleshly nature and and
[27:21] so he says one man wants to go after
[27:23] what he sees uh and and there's where
[27:25] he's deceived that's where Satan
[27:27] deceived Eve goes on down it says God
[27:30] wants to lead men so he made himself a
[27:33] little control tower in the midst of his
[27:35] heart so that man would be led of the by
[27:38] the Holy by the spirit of God getting
[27:41] off on his own leading is what separated
[27:45] him from his Fellowship so so we we can
[27:49] see man that that this nician Spirit
[27:54] remember it would before it became a
[27:56] Doctrine the it was deeds and so this is
[27:59] the age of Deeds Deeds that that means
[28:02] it wasn't men teaching it was men
[28:05] following their own opinions following
[28:09] what they thought was right following
[28:11] what they uh felt was the best thing for
[28:15] them and God and so and in doing so they
[28:18] are usurping their Authority which is
[28:22] simply there there is no Authority but
[28:24] they're usurping their opinions as uh
[28:27] author authority over God's word and so
[28:30] Amen in other words he wants to serve
[28:32] God on his own terms uh uh and these are
[28:36] the Deeds of the nicians it is the
[28:39] Conquering of the Ley this was a spirit
[28:42] that was at work can you say amen and so
[28:45] brother Brandon would teach us remember
[28:48] they left their first love so this was
[28:52] no longer their absolute their opinions
[28:56] of what the word said mattered more to
[28:58] them than what God's word said and so I
[29:02] I I think it's I think it's very
[29:04] important because amen we've got to
[29:06] watch that spirit of nianis in every one
[29:10] of our
[29:11] hearts because you can minister to that
[29:14] as as um as a uh uh I got a beetle
[29:20] here crawling on me well anyways so if
[29:25] uh I'm glad it wasn't a tick
[29:28] but we if you you don't want to you
[29:31] don't want to minister unbelief to your
[29:34] children to your wife to your in other
[29:37] words there there should be an
[29:40] absolute in your heart for this word
[29:45] this message must be thus sayeth the
[29:48] Lord in every area of your life amen so
[29:52] if you're not careful you if you leave
[29:54] one word out it will go down to your
[29:57] children and and and and and your uh uh
[30:02] lackness will affect those under you
[30:05] amen and so we we we've got to teach
[30:09] we've got to believe every word of God
[30:13] we've got to teach our children through
[30:16] our example through our opinions through
[30:18] our through through our attitudes amen
[30:21] that God's word is the absolute can you
[30:23] say amen amen now now you know something
[30:27] is is just as simple as as as as as
[30:30] let's just use uh a church attendance
[30:32] cuz it's going to be in our next it's
[30:34] going to be in our next uh uh quote here
[30:36] that I'm going to going to read before
[30:38] we get in the church age book and and um
[30:41] Church you know it it's easy it's easy
[30:43] for us to just sort of push that off
[30:47] when when in all reality you are you are
[30:51] putting your opinion above that which
[30:54] God says and his word and in presuming
[30:58] brother Brandon would say now you that
[31:00] claim you have the Holy Ghost and and
[31:02] you that's got long hair wear your
[31:05] dresses neat everything like that and
[31:08] you stay home on Wednesday night to
[31:10] watch a program a television program
[31:12] instead of going to church for prayer
[31:14] meeting you're presuming you've got the
[31:17] Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost is in
[31:19] there the love of God Is So constrained
[31:22] in you you just can't stay away from
[31:24] those people you that has to be for
[31:27] first to prayer amen so so brother
[31:31] brother brandom would tell us now the
[31:33] love if you if having your first love
[31:36] then it's the opposite of law but when
[31:38] you lose your love then it becomes the
[31:42] law and he says as as I've often said I
[31:45] don't run around with other women
[31:46] because I'm afraid my wife will divorce
[31:48] me I don't run around with other women
[31:50] because I love my wife he says I don't
[31:53] believe that you should run around but a
[31:56] law isn't what keeps it my marriage vows
[31:58] it's my love it's the reason I love God
[32:02] not because I'm afraid he'll send me to
[32:04] hell I don't believe he'd do that I I I
[32:07] but because I love him so much I don't
[32:09] want to do it there is nothing in me to
[32:12] make me do it I love him too much I
[32:15] wouldn't hurt him for nothing certainly
[32:18] I love him and when men and women get to
[32:20] a place well I really ought to you I I
[32:23] want to stay home to see you know a play
[32:26] tonight or uh but if if if I if I tell
[32:29] you they'll they'll think that I'm
[32:31] backslid if I don't go on down to the
[32:33] church and and he says and you sat there
[32:35] and sleep anyhow you might as well have
[32:37] stayed home and look at something that
[32:39] you enjoy more when your joy becomes the
[32:42] Lord and the Lord is your joy you can't
[32:46] stay away from church then you're
[32:49] getting somewhere so he's bringing it
[32:51] right back to the first love the love
[32:55] that you love nothing else matters but
[33:00] Christ nothing else matters it well I'm
[33:03] old enough I don't need it don't matter
[33:06] every word of God Eve just forsook one
[33:11] word can you say Amen so amen so when we
[33:15] when we look at this everyone is to
[33:20] participate in worship that was what God
[33:24] birthed this church it was every one of
[33:27] us and when one is missing out of that
[33:31] link it it affects it affects the whole
[33:36] body it affects everything so to
[33:39] understand that the life of God is
[33:42] dependent upon this
[33:45] conduit just like it's dependent on your
[33:48] conduit your your wire your you are
[33:52] youen you are the reciprocal for the
[33:55] presence of God Amen are y'all are y'all
[33:57] following me so far so what was the
[34:00] nickan spirit to do amen now everyone
[34:05] again was to participate in worship not
[34:07] just the pastor not just the Deacon not
[34:10] just the choir not just the song leader
[34:14] amen that would be cand worship that's
[34:16] that's where the church has become today
[34:18] it's cand worship you come in and
[34:21] there's a few that do the
[34:23] entertaining that was what the nickan
[34:27] Spirit was trying to do I don't matter
[34:31] it lets me off the hook whether I'm at
[34:33] the prayer meeting or not whether I'm at
[34:35] church or not whether I this or not I
[34:37] yet God knows my heart I amen that the
[34:40] church is going to go on without me no
[34:41] no no no we are all a body in this
[34:46] worship
[34:47] amen amen so the nician
[34:51] says we'll do it for you amen you guys
[34:55] you guys are too messy with with your
[34:57] worship uh you you you can't we can't
[35:00] have all that shouting and and speaking
[35:02] in tongues and and and you don't have a
[35:05] deep enough understanding of the
[35:07] scripture and so we need a more
[35:09] theological approach uh which will be
[35:11] more appealing to the lost and we're
[35:13] trying to reach the lost we're trying to
[35:16] bring them in so that they can hear the
[35:18] gospel of Salvation and the way you guys
[35:20] are doing it you guys are just looking
[35:22] like a bunch of lunatics and so we're
[35:24] wanting to we're going to get some gu up
[35:27] here that are more polished we'll have
[35:29] our little program and then the lost or
[35:33] the people outside can hear the gospel
[35:36] now that sounds really good but that's
[35:39] not the way God planned it that's right
[35:41] can you say Amen so so brother Bram says
[35:44] they were trying to reach the educated
[35:46] and the oldfashioned gospel was too much
[35:50] for them my so on the uh before we get
[35:54] into the church H book I've got the uh
[35:57] there on the in the church a on the
[35:59] Samaran Church age on tape brother
[36:01] brandom says he had Apostles prophets
[36:04] teachers evangelists pastors now that's
[36:07] the elected offices of God to his church
[36:10] then in each Church there's nine
[36:12] spiritual gifts that come among the
[36:14] people that is knowledge wisdom Gifts of
[36:17] healing uh workers of Miracles speaking
[36:19] with tongues interpretation of tongues
[36:21] all these things go in each local body
[36:24] and every person in the church
[36:27] has an individual Ministry and that
[36:30] individual Ministry goes together with
[36:32] the rest of the ministry to edify the
[36:36] body of Jesus Christ can you say Amen so
[36:40] so now nickan ISM as brother as as
[36:43] brother uh Harry mentioned the other
[36:45] night as he as he brought out
[36:46] beautifully now it is men honoring
[36:50] men now it is men uh uh exalting men and
[36:55] and now it's now everyone's jockeying
[36:58] for positions and power and everything
[37:00] else because they want to be h h h uh a
[37:05] part of it and so now we have Bishops
[37:07] and we have uh presor and we have all of
[37:10] these things as we're fixing to read
[37:11] tonight amen now brother the Ephesian
[37:15] age there on tape he says uh he says now
[37:18] what they were trying to do here was
[37:20] trying to take the church where God had
[37:22] the pastors the spirit of God moving by
[37:25] gifts in the Church of the Living God
[37:26] God and they were having a Doctrine
[37:29] start that they was going to have some
[37:31] priests and Bishops and popes and so
[37:32] forth and God says he hated it he hates
[37:35] it yet today niiko overcome overthrow
[37:38] the leoty the leoty is the church how
[37:40] many knows that the leot the church he
[37:42] says overthrow or conqueror take the
[37:44] place of the leoty in other words take
[37:47] all the sacredness all of the power from
[37:49] the church put it over on the priest let
[37:53] the congregation live the way it wants
[37:55] to but the priest is the Holy One take
[37:57] the a holy ghost away from the people
[38:00] sign with signs and wonders following
[38:02] them take a take that away give them a
[38:05] holy priesthood take away the Holy Ghost
[38:08] and swap it for a priesthood can you say
[38:11] Amen now I want you to really open your
[38:12] heart up let's let's look here I'm going
[38:14] to go back um uh we're going to go back
[38:17] a page from from where it's in page
[38:21] 95 uh from where brother Harry stopped
[38:24] the other night
[38:27] now I want you to open your heart up
[38:29] because now I want you to now now now
[38:31] don't don't be looking at this through
[38:34] message
[38:35] filters I want you to take this message
[38:39] and I want you to listen to what brother
[38:41] brandham is saying now when I'm saying
[38:44] message
[38:45] filters I I'm saying brother brandham is
[38:50] telling you and me that we could very
[38:52] well denominate this
[38:55] message we want to hear it Through The
[38:58] Eyes Of God Amen he that hath an ear to
[39:02] hear Let Him hear okay now let's let's
[39:06] read here Ephesians or or the U 95 and
[39:10] we're going to start at the second uh
[39:13] paragraph he says Paul saw it coming but
[39:17] he warned them about this subtle
[39:19] priesthood that would come and take over
[39:21] with its false doctrines he knew they
[39:24] would Implement a Implement a way of
[39:26] worship that excluded people from any
[39:27] part of the Holy Spirit
[39:29] Ministry and even right today among
[39:32] those who claim to be free full of the
[39:35] spirit there is not too much freedom in
[39:37] the leoty and the best we can see is a
[39:40] few preachers with inspired preaching
[39:41] while the flock sits there and tries to
[39:44] absorb it this is a far cry from Paul
[39:47] who said that when all come together
[39:49] somebody say all and all had the leading
[39:53] of the spirit somebody say all all and
[39:57] all participated in spiritual worship
[39:59] somebody say all all participated and
[40:02] the church corporate never learned this
[40:04] lesson from the scripture nor from
[40:06] history every time God gives a
[40:09] visitation of the Holy Spirit the people
[40:12] get free and after a while they bind
[40:16] themselves right back to the very thing
[40:18] they came out of when Luther come out of
[40:21] Catholicism the people stayed free for a
[40:23] while but when he died the people Simply
[40:27] Organized what they thought he believed
[40:31] and set up their own Creeds and ideas
[40:36] and repudiated anyone who said opposite
[40:39] to what they said they went right back
[40:42] to Catholicism with a little different
[40:46] form now now hear me you if you are if
[40:50] you if you followed the the the the true
[40:54] message of Luther they would have never
[40:57] organized if you followed the true
[41:00] message of Wesley brother brandom says
[41:03] if they would have continued with the
[41:05] spirit they would have the message of
[41:08] today sure but they organized and God
[41:11] says amen that's that's that that part
[41:14] of the plant's going to die I'm going to
[41:16] keep going on and
[41:17] Brethren God is coming after a bride
[41:21] that is full of the life of God the Holy
[41:25] Spirit
[41:27] must be in our lives can I hear an amen
[41:32] now watch he says uh he he says uh he
[41:37] says they went right back to the
[41:38] Catholicism with a little different form
[41:41] and right today many Luthers are ready
[41:43] uh to go all the way back and today they
[41:46] have went back amen they've went back
[41:49] joined themselves back to the har uh to
[41:51] the wh Church they have accepted
[41:53] everything about her uh they've done
[41:55] that years ago now
[41:56] and the Pentecostal church has just
[41:58] recently done that now he says oh yes in
[42:01] Revelation 17 the old horde had many
[42:03] daughters these daughters are just like
[42:05] mother they set the word aside deny the
[42:10] work of the spirit of God subjugate the
[42:14] leoty and make it
[42:16] impossible for the leoty to worship God
[42:21] unless uh uh unless they come through
[42:25] them or through their pattern which is
[42:29] nothing but a blueprint of unbelief from
[42:32] Satan himself so so now he is saying
[42:36] okay so then the messenger's dead he's
[42:39] going on now they are denominating they
[42:42] are organizing around what they think he
[42:46] believed and then they make it
[42:49] impossible for anybody to worship unless
[42:53] they come through the pattern that they
[42:56] set in
[42:57] order can't make a Rapture unless you
[43:00] come through this
[43:01] message what message the message of
[43:05] William brandom was come back to the
[43:10] life that's the message of William
[43:13] brandom not another denomination not
[43:16] another Creed not another you got to do
[43:19] it my way in order to make you've got to
[43:21] know Jesus
[43:24] Christ now what
[43:27] he says um let's see where did I go okay
[43:30] unless you come through my pattern he
[43:32] says oh where oh where are we
[43:34] spiritually we're in a Wilderness of
[43:36] Darkness how far we have wandered from
[43:40] the first church Pentecost is nowhere in
[43:43] View and the word cannot be found now
[43:47] Brothers someone say
[43:50] hallelujah saying we don't believe in
[43:52] the ministry
[43:54] anymore and you need to shut down your
[43:56] churches and put brother brandom in the
[43:58] pull
[44:01] pit
[44:03] subjugating innocent people thousands
[44:07] and thousands and
[44:10] thousands and telling them they can't
[44:12] worship unless they do it the
[44:15] Jeffersonville pattern what did Brother
[44:19] brandom
[44:21] say come
[44:22] on we go back to what the M I don't care
[44:27] I don't care how many foul preachers
[44:29] have taken off denominational wise this
[44:31] way or that way you're in a denomination
[44:33] if you're following Joseph brandham
[44:35] instead of following the word of
[44:39] God you're in a denomination if you're
[44:42] following wendle Martin because if you
[44:44] were following truly following the
[44:47] prophet of the hour it would be causing
[44:49] repentance in our heart and a coming
[44:52] back to every word amen
[44:56] everywhere everyone say everywhere every
[45:00] word what they done is they took they
[45:04] left the most of it but then they were
[45:06] just taking little pieces out until now
[45:11] we can't eat there there ain't there
[45:12] ain't hardly anything that even looks
[45:14] anything even today like like what
[45:16] brother brandham uh what what the angel
[45:18] of the Lord done through brother
[45:19] brandham 50 60 years
[45:22] ago the life of God the Holy Spirit
[45:26] didn't die with brother brandham he's
[45:28] still Among
[45:29] Us can you say Amen
[45:33] now he says he says the Pentecost is
[45:35] nowhere in view the word cannot be found
[45:37] Apostolic
[45:39] secession which today abounds what is
[45:41] Apostolic
[45:42] secession that means that means it's
[45:44] just passed down it's a hierarchy Amen
[45:47] brother brandham is is now now it'll go
[45:49] to his son and they'll go to his son or
[45:52] it would be it would be the same as as
[45:54] as as uh I'm I'm pastor and now now my
[45:58] my son will have to be pastor and and
[46:00] then his son will have to be that's not
[46:02] the way the Holy Spirit works
[46:06] it God chooses who he will that's
[46:10] right and what we've got to do we've got
[46:12] to
[46:14] respect I've got to respect you you got
[46:16] to respect me but we obey the
[46:21] scripture now if God chooses to use one
[46:23] of my sons uh you know that's wonderful
[46:27] but but that's not the way it works God
[46:31] calls God ordains God puts into office
[46:35] that's why we get into so much trouble
[46:37] we we got a we got a powerful leader and
[46:39] then and then it's just got to and and
[46:41] we find come on we see we're seeing that
[46:43] in the UPC that I mean the it's an
[46:46] Apostolic uh uh succession whether the
[46:49] guy's anointed to be Pastor or not or
[46:50] whether the guy can preach a lick you
[46:52] know his dad built the thing up until
[46:54] you know they got a th pie people and so
[46:56] so now it's it's his you know and
[46:58] charismatic guys are all doing the same
[47:00] thing it's a business this is not a
[47:02] business this is God running his
[47:08] church amen all right well can you say
[47:11] Amen now Apostolic secession which today
[47:14] abounds is not found in the word it's a
[47:17] man-made device it supersedes illegally
[47:19] the truth that God not man has set his
[47:22] leaders in the church Peter was not even
[47:24] in Rome yet they lie and say he was
[47:27] history proves he was not they are
[47:29] people who read history they shrug their
[47:31] shoulders and go back to believing a lie
[47:34] where can you find the viker of Christ
[47:37] in the word no one no one takes his
[47:40] place yet it has been done and people
[47:43] accept it and where can you find add
[47:46] that added Revelation is accepted by God
[47:48] especially Revelation contrary to the
[47:51] one already given yet they accept it and
[47:53] rest on it where where do do you find
[47:56] Purgatory where do you find aass where
[47:59] do you find paying money to get out of
[48:00] hell it is not in the word people put it
[48:04] in their own book and by it look over
[48:06] the people ruling them by fear where do
[48:09] you find that man or where do you find
[48:12] that man has the power to forgive us as
[48:14] though he were God Grievious wolves is
[48:17] hardly strong enough to describe them
[48:19] nicod leonism organization man over man
[48:23] get back to God repent before it's too
[48:25] late see the handwriting on the wall it
[48:28] is it is writing judgment as sacred
[48:31] vessels were desecrated and thus brought
[48:33] the wrath of God now the sacred word has
[48:36] been desecrated and the spirit grieved
[48:38] judgment is here even at the door repent
[48:41] repent go back to Pentecost go back to
[48:44] the leadership of the Holy Ghost back to
[48:46] the word of God for why will ye die can
[48:50] you say Amen now now brother Brandon
[48:52] would go on and and um in he in he the
[48:57] Revelations 2 and 7 he that hath in hear
[48:59] Let Him hear what the spirit sath to the
[49:02] churches he says now he says uh it may
[49:05] be that Millions will hear these words
[49:08] or read them but how many will pay heed
[49:11] to them that we do not know but he who
[49:16] will lend his ear someone say hallelujah
[49:19] and want to know the words of truth will
[49:22] find the spirit of God enlightening him
[49:26] if your ear is open to the word the
[49:28] spirit of God will make the word real to
[49:31] you now that is a work of the spirit I
[49:36] can teach you the truth but if you don't
[49:38] open your ear to hear it and your heart
[49:40] to receive it you won't get the
[49:42] Revelation now notice it says the spirit
[49:45] is speaking to the churches this is plur
[49:47] that is plural not singular the spirit
[49:50] did not have John write this down to a
[49:51] local Ephesian Church nor for the first
[49:54] church age only
[49:56] it it is for all Church ages but this is
[49:59] the Church of Beginnings thus is like
[50:01] the book of be of Genesis what started
[50:04] in Genesis holds true now K keep this in
[50:07] your mind holds true throughout the
[50:09] entire word finally closes out in
[50:11] Revelation thus this church beginning in
[50:13] Acts is God's blueprint for all ages
[50:16] until she closes out in the lay Odyssey
[50:17] and age watch it carefully let every age
[50:20] take heed for what is going on here is
[50:24] only the start the little tree that was
[50:27] planted is going to grow it's going to
[50:30] grow Through the Ages this then is a
[50:33] message for every Christian through
[50:35] every age until Jesus comes yes it is
[50:38] for it is the spirit speaking amen can
[50:43] you say Amen to that now amen so so we
[50:47] can we can see that amen he wants to
[50:51] make himself real it must take the Holy
[50:54] Spirit amen now now in in the in the
[50:57] sard sardian church age in um um I I
[51:02] don't have the page number there it's in
[51:04] it's in paragraph 77 though it says make
[51:07] no mistake about it a person that is
[51:09] truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into
[51:12] the body of Christ receiving the
[51:14] fullness of the spirit will be in the
[51:17] word all the
[51:19] way not part of the way amen all the way
[51:24] somebody say all the way the there's a
[51:26] song we used to sing all the way amen
[51:31] and that is the evidence of being
[51:33] baptized with the Holy Ghost
[51:35] now amen so so we so we can understand
[51:39] that and that that just sort of goes uh
[51:41] just goes back to uh just wanted to go
[51:44] back a little ways from what brother
[51:46] Harry was mentioning the other night now
[51:48] let's go to page
[51:50] 93 uh for a moment and uh I want to also
[51:54] look here this is going going to be in
[51:55] this first paragraph halfway through it
[51:59] amen it says I believe in
[52:02] leadership of the Holy Ghost coming
[52:05] through the
[52:06] word I also
[52:09] um I I believe see come hold through the
[52:12] word I I believe also that God has set
[52:16] men in the church men who are gifted by
[52:19] the spirit and they will keep the church
[52:21] in order I believe that I believe also
[52:25] that the church is ruled over by men
[52:28] that God sends to take charge and by but
[52:31] by uh but that rule is by the word so
[52:34] that it is not men really ruling but the
[52:37] spirit of God for the word and the
[52:38] spirit are one Hebrews 13:7 remember
[52:42] them which have the rule over you who
[52:43] have spoken unto you the word of God
[52:46] whose Faith follow considering uh their
[52:49] conversation but see what is happening
[52:51] back there the false find was getting a
[52:53] hold and it was teaching that Ruth
[52:55] ership by men was right it taught that
[52:58] the church had to be governed it taught
[53:00] a control over the people but instead of
[53:02] doing it God's way they simply took
[53:05] authority vested all the spiritual power
[53:07] in their own hands came out with a holy
[53:10] priesthood standing between God and the
[53:12] people they went right back to the old
[53:14] ironic system and the Antichrist meteor
[53:18] Antichrist his mediatorship imposed
[53:20] their
[53:21] own he says God hated that the Ephesians
[53:24] hated that and any True Believer will
[53:26] hate that too we would have to be Stone
[53:28] blind not to see the same thing at work
[53:30] throughout all Through the Ages and
[53:32] right now it is worse of all what it was
[53:35] was organization they separated the
[53:37] people God's people uh are supposed to
[53:40] be one by one Spirit are they all
[53:43] baptized into one body everyone is to be
[53:45] moved by the spirit Holy Ghost everyone
[53:48] is to participate in worship of God but
[53:51] men wanted the preeminence so they took
[53:53] over control Bishops became archbishops
[53:56] with imposing titles and bypassed the
[53:58] word of God and taught their own
[54:00] doctrines they got the people obey them
[54:03] until the time that their way of worship
[54:05] did not in any way at all resemble the
[54:08] early days of Pentecost all right now
[54:14] okay having said that now I want us to
[54:16] look at this because um I I want us to
[54:19] deal now W with this with with this next
[54:22] uh for the next few minutes so
[54:26] what do we do with okay so if men is not
[54:29] supposed to um lead the church then then
[54:33] what are there is a leadership in the
[54:37] church amen God God has placed those
[54:40] that leadership in the church and
[54:42] because remember and this is this is
[54:45] something that that we need that we've
[54:46] got to remember now God always and I'll
[54:48] just read it to you uh this is in
[54:50] perseverant there in in
[54:52] 64 uh he said he was he he looked on the
[54:55] Harvest he was the lord of the Harvest
[54:58] he said the Harvest is ripe labors are
[55:00] few pray ye the lord of the Harvest that
[55:02] he may send labors into the Harvest
[55:04] making himself with man so bound
[55:06] together that he works only through the
[55:08] agency of men he could have chose or he
[55:11] chose man to work for him he could have
[55:13] chose the sun to preach the gospel he
[55:16] could have chose the winds or the trees
[55:18] the stars but he chose man veils himself
[55:22] inside he hides
[55:25] himself can you say Amen so another
[55:28] place he says we are only transmitters
[55:31] that transmits the voice of God through
[55:33] our agency of man to the hearer he would
[55:38] also say I believe one of the hardest
[55:40] things that God has ever had to do was
[55:43] to get one mortal to believe another
[55:46] mortal we won't believe one another and
[55:49] we are God's agency we know that he he
[55:53] says in another place the hardest thing
[55:55] God has ever had to do is to get one
[55:56] more to believe he says it would be easy
[55:58] if the angel that spoke to me was
[56:01] standing up here on the pull pit tonight
[56:03] and telling you this he said it would be
[56:05] much easier for the angel but he has to
[56:09] come uh he says he said why you would
[56:12] run up and worship him you would want to
[56:14] fall down to his feet but he uses the
[56:17] agency of man that's right can you say
[56:21] Amen now here we're getting back to what
[56:26] the spirit is trying to say it's not a
[56:29] few gifted men or men a hierarchy and
[56:34] and the church is entertained no he uses
[56:40] man every one of us have a
[56:43] Ministry can you say Amen now I want us
[56:46] to go to page uh
[56:49] 197 and and brother brandom's going to
[56:52] um he's he's going to
[56:55] deal here and and I understand that this
[56:58] here is is
[57:00] um this is just the uh the beginning so
[57:05] we're going to be dealing with the
[57:06] nicians all through these Church ages um
[57:09] but but here he explains it pretty good
[57:11] and I I thought we would we would bring
[57:13] this in
[57:15] 197 uh any any
[57:23] questions
[57:25] all
[57:26] right
[57:30] Hallelujah let's see
[57:35] [Music]
[57:41] uh okay so we will we will start
[57:45] there uh we it's got the scripture there
[57:49] in 215 Revelations but we're just going
[57:50] to go on down says you will recall that
[57:53] I brought out in the inisan church age
[57:56] that the word nicotin comes from two
[57:59] Greek
[58:01] words it says noika noiko which means to
[58:06] conquer Leo means the
[58:08] Ley letin means to conquer the leoty
[58:12] that now why is this such a terrible
[58:14] thing it is terrible because God has
[58:15] never placed his church in the hands of
[58:18] an elected leadership which moves with
[58:21] political mindness he has placed his
[58:23] church in the care
[58:25] of God ordained spirit filled word
[58:28] living men who lead the people through
[58:30] feeding them the word so how does God's
[58:34] H how do any of leadership whether it's
[58:36] in our families whether it's in the
[58:37] church wherever we're at it's all the
[58:40] man by feeding the people can you say
[58:43] you man feeding them the word he has not
[58:45] separated the people into classes so
[58:47] that masses are led by a holy priesthood
[58:50] it is true that the leadership must be
[58:52] holy but then so must the whole
[58:55] congregation further there is no place
[58:57] in the word where priest or ministers
[58:59] are such mediate between God and the
[59:02] people am I reading too fast are we okay
[59:05] uh uh through through the people nor is
[59:08] there a place where they are separated
[59:10] in their worship of the Lord God wants
[59:13] all to love and serve him together
[59:16] nickan ISM destroys those precepts
[59:20] instead separates the ministers from the
[59:22] people and makes them leaders overlords
[59:25] instead of servants now this Doctrine
[59:28] usually actually started as a deed in
[59:30] the first church age or the first age it
[59:33] appears that the problem lay in the two
[59:35] words Elders presor overseers Bishops
[59:40] though scripture shows that there are
[59:42] several Elders in each Church some began
[59:46] Ignatius among them to teach that the
[59:49] idea of a bishop was one of uh
[59:52] preeminence or authority and control
[59:55] over the elders so now brother random is
[59:57] is fixing to show us how this started so
[1:00:00] so here we had the bishop over one
[1:00:04] Bishop over many
[1:00:06] elders and there's a lot of that
[1:00:08] nonsense goes on in some of the ranks in
[1:00:11] in our message too where there's one
[1:00:13] over many and and even it even send
[1:00:16] their tithes into that one and then he
[1:00:19] distributes the money wherever that is
[1:00:21] that is that is denomination if there is
[1:00:24] ever been a denomination that's the
[1:00:26] truth now watch he says he says now the
[1:00:30] truth of the matter is the word Elder
[1:00:33] signifies who the person is while the
[1:00:36] word Bishop signifies the office of the
[1:00:39] same man the Elder is the man the bishop
[1:00:43] is the office of the man Elder always
[1:00:46] has and always will refer simply to a
[1:00:50] man's Chron chronological age in the
[1:00:52] Lord he's an elder not because he's
[1:00:55] elected or ordained Etc but because he's
[1:00:59] older he is more seasoned trained not a
[1:01:02] novice reliable because of experience
[1:01:06] and long-standing proof of his Christian
[1:01:08] experience but no the Bishops did not
[1:01:11] stick to the Epistles of of Paul but
[1:01:15] rather went to uh went to Paul's account
[1:01:18] of the time he called the elders from
[1:01:21] Ephesus uh to um from alphus to ma
[1:01:27] malius meletus whatever in acts in Acts
[1:01:30] 20 and and he says and in verse 17 the
[1:01:34] record States Elders were called men
[1:01:36] then in verse 28 they were called o
[1:01:39] overseers Bishops these Bishops no doubt
[1:01:42] politically minded and anxious for power
[1:01:44] insisted that Paul had given the meaning
[1:01:47] that overseers were more than local
[1:01:49] Elder with the official capacity only in
[1:01:53] his own church to make to them a bishop
[1:01:56] was now one that with extended authority
[1:02:00] over many local leaders such a a concept
[1:02:04] was neither scriptural nor historical
[1:02:06] yet even a man of the stature of
[1:02:08] polycarp leaned toward such organization
[1:02:11] thus that which started as a deed in the
[1:02:13] first age was made a literal Doctrine
[1:02:16] and so it is today Bishops still claim
[1:02:18] power to control men and deal with them
[1:02:21] as they desire placing them um where
[1:02:24] they so will in the ministry this denies
[1:02:27] the leadership of the Holy Ghost who
[1:02:30] said separate me Paul and Barnabas for
[1:02:32] the work there unto I've called them
[1:02:34] this is anti- word and Antichrist
[1:02:37] Matthew
[1:02:38] 20:25 but Jesus called unto them and he
[1:02:41] said ye know the princes of the Gentiles
[1:02:43] exercise dominion over them that uh they
[1:02:47] they that are great exercise Authority
[1:02:49] upon them but it shall not be so among
[1:02:52] you but who whosoever will be great
[1:02:55] among you let him be your minister
[1:02:57] whosoever will be Chief among you let
[1:03:00] him be your servant even as the son of
[1:03:02] man came not to be ministered unto but
[1:03:04] to minister and to give his life a
[1:03:07] ransom for many Matthew 23 and8 but be
[1:03:10] ye not called Rabbi for one is your
[1:03:13] master even Christ all ye are Brethren
[1:03:16] call no man uh call no man your father
[1:03:20] upon Earth for one is your father which
[1:03:24] is is in heaven can you say Amen so so
[1:03:27] now how many's how many's understanding
[1:03:29] so now what they were trying to do it
[1:03:32] was in they're taking that that they're
[1:03:35] in the book of Acts where he called the
[1:03:38] elders together and so they're they're
[1:03:41] looking at the Bishops but it was God
[1:03:44] has many Elders in one congregation
[1:03:48] there's many Elders now there's one
[1:03:51] Bishop he's an elder too but he is he is
[1:03:54] is the pastor of that local congregation
[1:03:56] he has no author I have no
[1:03:59] Authority uh uh over o o over amarilla
[1:04:04] no authority over Bartlesville uh
[1:04:08] Claremore or anything God places a a a a
[1:04:12] pastor over the people o over that local
[1:04:16] church in that church are are Elders
[1:04:20] amen and and so and and and there could
[1:04:23] be uh
[1:04:25] yeah and and they're deacons they
[1:04:27] they're ministers there's and there's
[1:04:30] and there's some that might not even
[1:04:31] have have
[1:04:33] a an official position but men that are
[1:04:37] that that are great in our church that
[1:04:40] have weathered the
[1:04:42] storms my they don't they don't have the
[1:04:44] title of Pastor but that don't make them
[1:04:48] any less than what the pastor is or they
[1:04:50] might not have the title of evangelist
[1:04:52] but that don't make them any less we are
[1:04:54] all one and equal in the call of God or
[1:04:57] in the in the family of God each of us
[1:05:01] have different
[1:05:02] calls can you say Amen
[1:05:05] now so so you can see that it was that
[1:05:09] it's politics plain and simple so now
[1:05:13] well brother Wendell if if if brother
[1:05:14] brandom is saying that we don't have we
[1:05:16] don't we don't have leadership anymore
[1:05:19] and that now and and and and there's a
[1:05:22] lot of there's a lot of you know again I
[1:05:24] I I don't I don't like picking on our
[1:05:25] own on our on our own um in the message
[1:05:30] but listen you got to do it the way
[1:05:32] brother Brenham the the the life the the
[1:05:35] the angel of the lord gave brother
[1:05:36] Brenham to give it to us he's not going
[1:05:38] to take away from the
[1:05:40] scripture he's not going to do that so
[1:05:43] to say we don't need a minister we don't
[1:05:44] need a we don't need a pastor we don't
[1:05:46] need a church we don't need where where
[1:05:49] where can you even remotely find that in
[1:05:51] the in the message see and then makes
[1:05:54] then then it makes the others look at us
[1:05:56] and call us occult well we're not the
[1:06:00] occult because we can take everything
[1:06:02] back to the Bible the prophet brought us
[1:06:05] back to the Bible now what other men
[1:06:08] make of it well whatever they make of it
[1:06:12] but it's not way the prophet brought
[1:06:14] it now in the bylaws let's just look
[1:06:17] let's just look here in the bylaws uh
[1:06:20] there in in um uh
[1:06:25] well this this just the uh the bylaws on
[1:06:28] on the pastor it says the office of the
[1:06:29] pastor is to conduct and act upon any
[1:06:32] program that he believes is to be
[1:06:34] according to the plan of God according
[1:06:36] to the word of God for the brandham
[1:06:37] Tabernacle he shall assume supreme
[1:06:40] authority to meet the initial
[1:06:41] responsibility of solely as to the
[1:06:44] keeping and promoting of the spiritual
[1:06:46] welfare of the church he shall be the
[1:06:48] head of the associate pastor the Deacon
[1:06:50] board the trustee board and the church
[1:06:53] body itself
[1:06:54] acting in wisdom to lead God's Saints
[1:06:56] manifesting love toward All Saints and
[1:06:58] their burdens conducting himself in
[1:07:01] perfect servitude of which God has
[1:07:02] called and placed him to act upon now
[1:07:05] you say oh no two totally opposites no
[1:07:10] no it's the way God put it and ordained
[1:07:13] it it's not meant I can't promote man
[1:07:18] you can't promote man God gives those
[1:07:22] calls right
[1:07:24] amen now questions and answers he says
[1:07:27] we believe in church government the
[1:07:29] government is ordered of the holy spirit
[1:07:31] in the Bible the pastor is always the
[1:07:33] head of the church pastor is always
[1:07:35] that's God's Elder in organizations they
[1:07:38] come through the bishop and now and
[1:07:40] there's no higher order in the Bible
[1:07:41] than the Elder uh in the church just
[1:07:44] just tell me where it's at there's no
[1:07:46] higher order in the Bible for the church
[1:07:48] than that Elder which is the pastor he's
[1:07:50] the highest order another place he says
[1:07:53] the pastor must be a man that's got a h
[1:07:55] a very humble Spirit way about him not
[1:07:57] too humble but what he he could be like
[1:08:00] the Lord Jesus when he saw wrong going
[1:08:02] on in the church and he plated ropes and
[1:08:04] ran them out of the church now the
[1:08:05] Church of God is the highest of judgment
[1:08:08] the pastor is the highest order in the
[1:08:10] church the Elder is the highest thing in
[1:08:12] the apostolic church outside the Holy
[1:08:14] Spirit the spirit brings his message
[1:08:16] straight to that Elder and the Elder
[1:08:19] gives it to the people so it's not
[1:08:22] taking away from Le leadership it is
[1:08:26] men usurping men tagging men men tagging
[1:08:30] men and making them and and and it's and
[1:08:33] it's a
[1:08:34] hierarchy but God has given God has
[1:08:38] given uh Shepherds God has given
[1:08:41] servants to feed his people not lead
[1:08:45] according to his every whim no that if
[1:08:48] he's a true pastor and we're fixing to
[1:08:50] get into to to to the other ministers as
[1:08:53] well but if he is a true Pastor he will
[1:08:56] never lead the people to himself he will
[1:09:00] always lead the people back to this and
[1:09:04] that's what we want so so but people
[1:09:07] Buck they what it
[1:09:10] is and and this is this is this is tough
[1:09:13] but people display the seed of the
[1:09:18] serpent they want to Buck Authority when
[1:09:22] God is working through that
[1:09:27] leadership and we've got to be careful
[1:09:30] that we're not dis we got to be care we
[1:09:32] got to make sure we've got the Holy
[1:09:33] Ghost yes sir because the Holy Ghost
[1:09:36] brother bradam says the Holy Ghost will
[1:09:37] subject to the Holy Ghost amen can you
[1:09:40] say Amen now now he says here he says
[1:09:45] now he says there's coming a church into
[1:09:48] that Perfection the ministry of
[1:09:50] perfection where the offices Apostles
[1:09:52] prophets teachers p pastors evangelist
[1:09:54] for the perfecting of the Saints then
[1:09:56] pastors and teachers so forth will be so
[1:09:58] with the word until the whole thing will
[1:10:00] work right up to the coming of the Lord
[1:10:05] amen
[1:10:06] so uh so you know so he he he he he he
[1:10:10] begins to talk on this amen so he's not
[1:10:13] doing a away with leadership leadership
[1:10:16] is
[1:10:17] here but the leaders that God places
[1:10:22] must be so Walking with God and
[1:10:26] communicating with God that they can
[1:10:29] hear his message not not their own
[1:10:32] message but hear his message and that's
[1:10:35] for the five-fold ministry that's for
[1:10:37] that's for every that's for those five
[1:10:39] Divine gifts just as the nine spiritual
[1:10:42] gifts those guys have got to hear from
[1:10:44] God and not just say you know thus
[1:10:47] sayith the Lord the lord loves you and
[1:10:49] all well the Bible says that so brother
[1:10:50] brand says that's vain repetition it's
[1:10:53] got to be from the
[1:10:56] Lord and that's the reason why man it's
[1:10:59] such a it's such a an incredible thing
[1:11:02] be the Lord God the Holy Spirit wants to
[1:11:07] move among his people he wants us all in
[1:11:10] one order y y'all understand any
[1:11:13] questions real
[1:11:15] quick amen any anything at all or anyone
[1:11:19] wants to add anything you're welcome to
[1:11:20] do so too amen brother Brenham even says
[1:11:24] that the that the Evangelist is subject
[1:11:27] to the pastor they go to so we hear we
[1:11:29] we hear um evangelist coming in boy I
[1:11:32] straighten that Pastor
[1:11:34] out the prophet said you're not you
[1:11:36] can't do that that's right because
[1:11:39] you're coming you well he don't have
[1:11:40] enough truth well go talk to him go talk
[1:11:43] to him by himself if you've got
[1:11:44] something you want to share with him but
[1:11:46] you don't go in and so
[1:11:48] confusion you you have to honor the way
[1:11:51] God set it up and the Evangel is not the
[1:11:54] leader of the
[1:11:55] church so we we so we we we keep the
[1:11:59] confusion away if God gives you
[1:12:01] something well then by all means you
[1:12:04] have to go and and and tell and and and
[1:12:07] tell that elder or whoever and say hey
[1:12:09] the lord gave me this you know I
[1:12:13] remember when I was selling shoes and
[1:12:15] and I well I was at the time I was doing
[1:12:18] Sonics and um so we were running all
[1:12:21] over Oklahoma you know doing those
[1:12:24] Sonics and I got a phone call and uh and
[1:12:27] the brother says I am grieved he said my
[1:12:30] heart is so grieved I I I'm I'm shaken
[1:12:33] right now as I call you and I said well
[1:12:37] he said the spirit of the Lord says he
[1:12:39] is grieved that you would
[1:12:43] put money and prosperity before your
[1:12:48] ministry well first thing happens to me
[1:12:52] is I'm who are you to be telling
[1:12:57] me but then the spirit of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:00] within me had to look at that because
[1:13:04] actually there was already conviction
[1:13:06] already taking place in my heart and I
[1:13:09] was I was out there after the well
[1:13:11] praise the
[1:13:13] Lord and it's hard it's been hard that's
[1:13:16] one one of the hardest things for me as
[1:13:18] a working Pastor you know trying to find
[1:13:20] that balance and I said what it's easy
[1:13:23] for you to say you've got money in the
[1:13:27] bank I don't I I I don't have a church
[1:13:30] you're and it was a pastor I said you
[1:13:35] you I have to
[1:13:37] work he says all I can tell you is what
[1:13:39] the spirit of the Lord told
[1:13:41] me
[1:13:47] click I had to subject myself to that
[1:13:52] word I had to
[1:13:57] repent amen now
[1:14:01] so God's got leadership God knows how to
[1:14:06] work now I don't know I can't tell you
[1:14:08] why you know why some some pastors are
[1:14:12] you know poor as all get out and some
[1:14:14] amen uh uh got they they've got enough
[1:14:17] money to build every everything and to
[1:14:19] satisfy all of their wants of of
[1:14:22] everything in their Church I I'm not a
[1:14:24] bit jealous they've got the money God
[1:14:26] bless them do it if I had the money I'd
[1:14:28] probably do it too amen I I I want our
[1:14:31] congregation to be blessed I want I want
[1:14:33] those things but ultimately I'm
[1:14:35] responsible to God not for my
[1:14:39] wants not to build a
[1:14:43] kingdom I'm not to build a kingdom I am
[1:14:46] to feed the sheep that God places under
[1:14:50] my tutelage that's right that's what I'm
[1:14:54] for I can't do anything else and I will
[1:14:56] be held accountable before God that's
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:02] amen now so let's move on I want to uh
[1:15:07] and I want us to just look for a moment
[1:15:08] at the
[1:15:10] deacons at the deacons because these are
[1:15:13] deacons trustees pastors uh the the
[1:15:16] fivefold ministry the the these are all
[1:15:19] areas and some people look at these
[1:15:21] things and says well I don't have to
[1:15:23] listen to the Deacon or I don't have to
[1:15:26] listen what the prophet said you
[1:15:31] did that is Holy Ghost
[1:15:38] leadership and we get we get angry with
[1:15:40] God or we get angry with this one or we
[1:15:42] tell this one off and we tell what what
[1:15:44] are you doing what what are you doing do
[1:15:47] we not fear God do we not understand
[1:15:52] that God's Got
[1:15:53] God's got a church this is his
[1:16:00] church and he's wanting your heart to be
[1:16:04] in line with his Spirit just as much as
[1:16:07] he's wanting the preacher's heart to be
[1:16:09] in line with the spirit that's right we
[1:16:12] must have the life of God within
[1:16:16] us so what we what we would say well
[1:16:19] that's nickel adism that's not nickel
[1:16:22] adism if it's to God that I just read
[1:16:24] you the guidelines on what brother
[1:16:25] randam had said on the on the
[1:16:28] pastor and and uh and I've also got it
[1:16:30] here for the Deacon and you'll
[1:16:32] understand that brother Brandon was
[1:16:34] saying these are men trying to usurp
[1:16:38] their
[1:16:41] opinion and trying to build Their
[1:16:47] Kingdoms and let the people die without
[1:16:51] without the power of God in their lives
[1:16:54] but it's not just the preachers that do
[1:16:56] it daddies do
[1:16:59] it you've got your own little kingdom
[1:17:02] and it don't care what the Bible says it
[1:17:04] don't care you don't care what the
[1:17:05] message says you're the boss of your
[1:17:07] little kingdom and you are under the
[1:17:10] authority of nickan
[1:17:13] ism you're Conquering the spirit of God
[1:17:17] the life of God that would be in your
[1:17:19] family of what you could what what could
[1:17:21] possess them and fill them and make
[1:17:23] Servants of them that's we got to be
[1:17:25] careful can you say Amen now now I want
[1:17:28] to start I thought this was an
[1:17:29] interesting quote he says brother bram's
[1:17:31] question answer 64 he says there's five
[1:17:34] offices elected of
[1:17:36] God he says for God has said in the
[1:17:39] church Apostles prophets teachers
[1:17:41] pastors evangelists God did that he says
[1:17:44] man has deacons and so forth I thought
[1:17:48] that was I I thought that was in
[1:17:50] incredibly now God sets the God sets the
[1:17:53] five-fold ministry and then he says and
[1:17:55] man has deacons and so forth and and um
[1:18:01] um he says
[1:18:10] uh well praise the Lord I'm I'm missing
[1:18:15] I I'm missing that uh but brother
[1:18:18] brandom says and God honored it and I I
[1:18:21] I I I I don't I don't see it here but
[1:18:24] where he talks about he said now and he
[1:18:26] and he takes back to the first deacons
[1:18:28] how that you know he said we've got to
[1:18:30] remain there in Acts the sixth chapter
[1:18:32] we've got to remain in the word and
[1:18:33] there was there was there was uh um the
[1:18:36] widows that weren't being taken care of
[1:18:38] the Greeks weren't being taken this that
[1:18:40] and the other and and so brother Brandon
[1:18:42] says so now God uh so they the they
[1:18:46] looked and said look out seven seven men
[1:18:49] of reputation and and he says and then
[1:18:51] God honored that and then put put by
[1:18:55] bylaws for the deacons and then he and
[1:18:57] then he says in in in several in in
[1:19:00] several places um he he says a Deacon's
[1:19:03] got more
[1:19:04] responsibility than the pastor has he
[1:19:08] says he's to be blameless a deacon is
[1:19:10] and and so uh another place it says GI
[1:19:13] and
[1:19:14] callings gets and callings let it let's
[1:19:17] let's get back uh what they what they
[1:19:19] are God sets them aside God places them
[1:19:21] in the church as he will God gives
[1:19:23] severally as he will is that right not
[1:19:25] as I will but as he will now if God
[1:19:27] wanted me to be a lay member of the
[1:19:29] church I'd be better off a lay member
[1:19:31] than I would to be a preacher because I
[1:19:34] will only bring reproach anywhere along
[1:19:37] the line it'll be something that'll
[1:19:38] bring uh that that'll bring reproach if
[1:19:40] he called me to be a be Deacon it's
[1:19:42] better for me to be a deacon than it
[1:19:44] would be a de Minister but if he's
[1:19:45] called me to be a minister I'd be better
[1:19:47] off a minister than I would be a lan
[1:19:50] member it's whatever God has called us
[1:19:52] to
[1:19:53] set us and set us in the church for his
[1:19:56] servants then we fit better so now he's
[1:19:58] he's coming back saying wherever he
[1:20:00] places you it is God that is doing the
[1:20:02] placing it's the Holy Spirit now are you
[1:20:06] understanding that it is not
[1:20:08] just a slack here it is to be working in
[1:20:13] that church there in 1 Corinthians 7:7
[1:20:16] it says but for I would that all men
[1:20:18] were even as myself but every man has
[1:20:22] his proper gift of God one after this
[1:20:24] manner one after that can you say Amen
[1:20:28] so because of the needs they they were
[1:20:32] they were to bring it in now um
[1:20:36] uh and I'm going to he says it it's it
[1:20:38] it isn't the pastor's duty to look out
[1:20:40] for the food and so forth that's
[1:20:42] supposed to be by the deacons it isn't
[1:20:43] the trustees it's the Deacon's office to
[1:20:46] do that remember in the Bible they was
[1:20:49] was contributing to their own the Greeks
[1:20:51] and the Jewish and where where the
[1:20:52] argument came up and that one that one
[1:20:55] was getting a little more than the other
[1:20:57] but it was the people who had sold all
[1:20:59] their goods and had give it to the
[1:21:00] church for its support and then divided
[1:21:03] among them equally and there was that
[1:21:05] little dispute there's where we got our
[1:21:06] first deacons and that was one of their
[1:21:09] uh duties was to do
[1:21:12] that um in church order 63 he says now
[1:21:16] the Deacon is a policeman a Deacon's
[1:21:18] office is actually more strict than any
[1:21:20] office in the church I don't know of any
[1:21:22] office any more strict than the Deacon's
[1:21:24] office that's right he's got a real job
[1:21:27] and he's God's man he's he's God's man
[1:21:31] just as much as the pastor is God's man
[1:21:33] certainly he is God's uh he's God's
[1:21:37] servant there in hiding himself in
[1:21:39] Simplicity when brother bradam is
[1:21:41] dedicating the Tabernacle before the
[1:21:42] seals he says please let every Deacon
[1:21:45] stand to his post of Duty and remember
[1:21:47] that you're under a commission from God
[1:21:49] to hold that post sacred and every
[1:21:52] trustee the
[1:21:54] same now he he goes on he says now the
[1:21:57] deacons they are the policemen of the
[1:22:00] church this is this is still this in the
[1:22:02] seals he says that is if young couples
[1:22:06] come on the outside and blowing horns
[1:22:08] and you know you know how they usually
[1:22:10] do and something like that in the
[1:22:12] meetings or you know get out there and
[1:22:15] their mother is sending her her girl
[1:22:17] down here and she takes out with a
[1:22:19] renegade kid and runs out there in the
[1:22:21] car and her mother think she's in church
[1:22:24] the Deacon ought to see to that you
[1:22:26] either come in here and sit down or I'm
[1:22:29] going to take you in my car and take you
[1:22:31] to your mother he says You must do that
[1:22:36] remember love is corrective always love
[1:22:38] is corrective genuine love so you must
[1:22:41] be able to stand correction and mothers
[1:22:43] know now that there's a place there for
[1:22:45] your babies and your kids now that they
[1:22:47] don't run around all over the building
[1:22:48] he goes on but but what he's what he's
[1:22:50] saying is okay in church out
[1:22:54] Church God's God's got God's got
[1:22:58] deacons that that are
[1:23:00] there we don't want no one ran over we
[1:23:03] don't want no one speeding in our
[1:23:04] parking lot we don't want gravel being
[1:23:06] spun out everywhere we don't we don't
[1:23:08] want them running up and down the the
[1:23:10] God's given us deacons to say that
[1:23:14] that's right so if if I have a problem
[1:23:16] with a deacon getting on to one of my
[1:23:18] children or getting on uh uh uh my
[1:23:21] grandchildren I have I now I'm not
[1:23:23] saying disciplining them I'm not saying
[1:23:25] that's the parents job but the thing is
[1:23:29] if there is somebody outside there don't
[1:23:31] you I mean and a and and a and going out
[1:23:34] there in the back of the you know going
[1:23:35] behind a
[1:23:37] car well a deacon a you you a deacon
[1:23:41] needs to hey hey and that that family
[1:23:45] and those children needs to know that
[1:23:48] Deacon has
[1:23:51] Authority that that's God's
[1:23:55] leadership that's God's
[1:23:59] leadership you know and then we just
[1:24:02] what no one better get on to my children
[1:24:03] you're a
[1:24:07] doofus come on let the spirit of the
[1:24:10] Lord come on
[1:24:13] you and see what the prophet is telling
[1:24:16] us he says the children should know
[1:24:20] discipline they should get it at home
[1:24:23] but even if it's mine my kids get in
[1:24:26] here at any time and they get disorderly
[1:24:29] I don't want to just draw One String
[1:24:31] Sarah Rebecca Joseph Billy whoever it
[1:24:35] might
[1:24:37] be can you say Amen he's not going to
[1:24:40] he's not going to hold anything back he
[1:24:43] says you tell me I'll see to it and if
[1:24:47] they can't behave they'll stay away from
[1:24:50] church until they learn to behave that
[1:24:52] is not an arena this is the house of God
[1:24:55] this is a not a place to play skate
[1:24:57] write notes laugh cut up in in the house
[1:25:00] of God to be carried on you come here to
[1:25:02] worship not even a place to visit or not
[1:25:04] not even to visit this is a not a picnic
[1:25:08] ground uh this is not a visitation place
[1:25:12] this is the visitation place of the Holy
[1:25:13] Spirit listen to what he has to say not
[1:25:15] to one another we don't come here to
[1:25:17] fellowship with one another we come here
[1:25:19] to fellowship with Christ this is the
[1:25:20] house and if these parents of the
[1:25:21] children want not listen to that then
[1:25:23] the deacons then that's this parrot
[1:25:25] should be corrected themselves can you
[1:25:26] say Amen so so again it's not you know
[1:25:30] we but what what I'm what I'm trying
[1:25:32] what what I'm trying to say here in this
[1:25:34] in this in in this area is we got to
[1:25:37] understand that God
[1:25:39] places
[1:25:41] leadership God places this leadership to
[1:25:45] keep us all safe now again Deacon's got
[1:25:50] the same he's got the same got to have
[1:25:52] the same same qualifications that the
[1:25:53] pastor does any kind of a leadership's
[1:25:55] got to have those same qualifications
[1:25:57] you know uh uh uh uh you got to be got
[1:25:59] to be humble and and things of that
[1:26:02] nature there can you say amen he says
[1:26:04] now God's not sent brother Neville and I
[1:26:07] to be bosses not at all we're your
[1:26:09] brothers you see instructions
[1:26:11] instructors in the gospel so let us all
[1:26:13] work together sometimes if something
[1:26:17] operates operating has to be called or
[1:26:19] said something about called down
[1:26:21] something in that order
[1:26:22] the person that's got the gift rejects
[1:26:24] it in other words the other person
[1:26:25] they're talking to just remember and if
[1:26:27] he refuses it remember your gift isn't
[1:26:30] right it wasn't God in the first place
[1:26:32] the spirit of God is ready for
[1:26:34] correction sweet and humble willing see
[1:26:38] if it stands up and says well I'll do it
[1:26:40] anyway you know how sometime you know
[1:26:42] how sometimes just remember arrogant
[1:26:44] Spirits are not of
[1:26:49] God deacons were asking brother Brandon
[1:26:51] one in respect to to the to the order of
[1:26:53] the church we have tried to go according
[1:26:54] to the way we understood it given in the
[1:26:57] dedication of the new church he said
[1:26:58] that's correct you're doing right now
[1:27:01] this is supposed to be the deacons he
[1:27:03] says and by doing so people has often
[1:27:06] gotten mad at us he says they do me too
[1:27:09] they'll do that at any man see a person
[1:27:12] that does that there's something wrong
[1:27:14] with that person they're not right with
[1:27:16] God for the spirit of Christ is subject
[1:27:19] to Christ's teaching Christ's house
[1:27:22] Christ order see any man any woman any
[1:27:26] person children that would get angry
[1:27:28] with a Godly Deacon that would tell them
[1:27:31] or any parent would get angry with a
[1:27:33] deacon really we want everyone in this
[1:27:35] church that we can get but if that would
[1:27:38] only cause trouble somewhere else
[1:27:39] there's a thorn or a rabbit in the wood
[1:27:41] pile as we used to say that person isn't
[1:27:43] right can you say Amen so so when we
[1:27:47] when we
[1:27:49] look leadership is part of it but a lot
[1:27:52] of people bring that as a hierarchy
[1:27:56] saying huh well that's just no no this
[1:28:00] is what the prophet taught on Holy Ghost
[1:28:03] leadership should be that's right so
[1:28:05] when we're looking when we're going and
[1:28:07] and we're you know as we as we go
[1:28:09] further and we're fixing to get into
[1:28:11] that uh as we go on brother Brandon's
[1:28:14] going to really start dealing how that
[1:28:15] it's sucks the life out of the church
[1:28:19] sucks that life out of the church and so
[1:28:22] we don't want that life sucked out of
[1:28:24] the church can you say amen and and and
[1:28:27] brother bradam would bring these the
[1:28:29] these deals in you know he would even
[1:28:30] separate and now the trustee is over the
[1:28:31] finances and things of the building they
[1:28:33] have nothing to do with the deacons the
[1:28:35] deacons are the policemen of the church
[1:28:36] the the assistance to the pastor the the
[1:28:39] trustees is the holding of the property
[1:28:41] the the trustees has nothing to do with
[1:28:43] the spiritual end of it the Deacon has
[1:28:45] nothing to do with the financial end of
[1:28:46] it and and and he says now the trustees
[1:28:49] the only thing they're under the duty by
[1:28:51] God somebody say Duty by God Duty by God
[1:28:54] to watch the finances and take care of
[1:28:57] that the thing that goes on like that I
[1:28:59] told you about them tapes and and about
[1:29:01] the other things here about the building
[1:29:03] and repairs and taking up and the
[1:29:04] finances and things that that's that's
[1:29:06] what they truste of the property and
[1:29:09] things he says uh the deacons has
[1:29:12] nothing to do in that neither does the
[1:29:14] trustee have anything to do with the
[1:29:16] Deacon's office and so so it is so here
[1:29:20] so what I what what reason I thought I
[1:29:22] would bring this in tonight and and
[1:29:24] we've not read just a whole bunch out of
[1:29:26] the church age book but before we go
[1:29:28] into this next section uh the next the
[1:29:30] next time's going to be the the two
[1:29:32] trees in the garden and that's that's
[1:29:34] going to be a wonderful I can't wait to
[1:29:36] get on that amen and U
[1:29:40] but to to say that well we don't we
[1:29:44] don't have we don't have to have
[1:29:45] Authority or we don't we don't have to
[1:29:47] have no no no no no God's got God
[1:29:51] ordained
[1:29:53] leadership in the
[1:29:56] church amen he does he's got that
[1:30:00] now I and I want to even say that on on
[1:30:03] on on on work days for the trustee if
[1:30:05] he's trying to organize put teams
[1:30:08] together and things like that we should
[1:30:10] rally brother random says he is
[1:30:13] commissioned by
[1:30:15] God so we should rally around you say
[1:30:19] well that's just all natural that's just
[1:30:21] bu no
[1:30:22] you you you you you you're missing the
[1:30:24] point it takes us all God's not all of
[1:30:29] you can
[1:30:31] preach not all of you can play music
[1:30:34] you're not gifted that but you do have
[1:30:37] some hands and a foot and a and a and a
[1:30:40] strong back you can do something for the
[1:30:45] Lord he said the trustees are not over
[1:30:47] the spiritual aspect at
[1:30:49] all and yet they're commissioned by God
[1:30:56] God so the Holy Spirit has ordained that
[1:31:01] the natural well we got the we got the
[1:31:04] Youth Camp coming up
[1:31:06] well everything you do you are you are
[1:31:10] you are you are rallying around what God
[1:31:15] is
[1:31:16] doing can you say
[1:31:18] amen amen now
[1:31:22] uh one more quote here and he says um he
[1:31:25] says uh he says now the group of
[1:31:28] officers of our church and deacons
[1:31:30] trustees Sunday School uh superintendent
[1:31:32] Pastor our church set in order you
[1:31:35] people elected the officers I I um uh
[1:31:40] I'm and Pastor I I'm let's see I'm just
[1:31:44] overseer to see that it goes on right to
[1:31:46] give advice and so forth you are the one
[1:31:49] who elects now I want you to understand
[1:31:52] that you are the one and he and he goes
[1:31:56] and he goes on down he says it's your
[1:31:58] duty to stand by those men they'll make
[1:32:01] mistake they're Mortals they're just men
[1:32:03] they'll make mistakes but if the
[1:32:05] president of the United States makes a
[1:32:06] mistake we do we throw him out as a
[1:32:09] president we forget about it and move on
[1:32:12] or he said no we forget about it and
[1:32:14] move on that's the way we want to do our
[1:32:16] church remember it's the and on down he
[1:32:18] says remember it's the devil's business
[1:32:20] to see that it's broke up that's uh it's
[1:32:23] always been that way it always will be
[1:32:25] but stand by your officers can you say
[1:32:27] Amen so so as we as as we as as we get
[1:32:33] ready to close here now the when we see
[1:32:38] what God has has um has called us to
[1:32:42] there is one thing that brother brandom
[1:32:44] is is is really stressing amen he is
[1:32:48] stressing keeping the life in the
[1:32:52] church
[1:32:54] now you say well brother wend that's a
[1:32:56] lot of carnal things yes it is and
[1:33:00] that's the reason why we must
[1:33:04] always there's a balance we've got to
[1:33:07] take because we're not turning this
[1:33:09] thing into a money
[1:33:10] machine we're not turning this thing
[1:33:12] into a but we are simply taking care of
[1:33:17] what we've
[1:33:18] got we are taking care deacons got their
[1:33:23] job to take that care of the Holy Spirit
[1:33:25] preachers are to hear from God to to to
[1:33:28] to feed the people moing the lawn we're
[1:33:31] doing we're taking care of what we've
[1:33:33] got and in doing so you mothers are the
[1:33:38] officer of God to your children you
[1:33:40] husbands are the officer of God to your
[1:33:42] to your families you're you're you and
[1:33:45] and and but the husband ain't ain't
[1:33:47] ain't free to just do everything he
[1:33:49] wants he's got to line it up right here
[1:33:52] Mama's got to line it up right here you
[1:33:55] children's got to line it up right here
[1:33:57] pastors got to line it up right here
[1:33:59] we've all got to line it up with thus
[1:34:03] sayith the
[1:34:05] lord well praise the Lord all right amen
[1:34:08] we're going to open the floor again if
[1:34:09] you've got if you've got anything you
[1:34:11] want to you want to say any
[1:34:14] questions anything you want to
[1:34:17] add praise the
[1:34:19] Lord yeah
[1:34:50] care
[1:35:20] yeah
[1:35:36] well you know that's tough I you know
[1:35:39] mama mama bears and her
[1:35:41] Cubs you
[1:35:42] know
[1:35:44] Hallelujah you know but Mama bears need
[1:35:48] the Holy Ghost too if they've got the
[1:35:50] Holy Ghost they they've
[1:35:53] got that's why that's that's that's
[1:35:56] that's why the deacons got it rough
[1:35:58] Hallelujah they they do and and so
[1:36:04] we uh uh but but the thing is is that's
[1:36:08] that's that's what we've got to have in
[1:36:11] order to keep the life of God and and I
[1:36:14] think I think most most mamas if deacons
[1:36:16] are fair and they're not you know taking
[1:36:19] up for their own children or they're not
[1:36:21] you know this that and the other I mean
[1:36:22] you know it's being a being a being a
[1:36:25] minister period a minister um and and a
[1:36:29] deacon you know you you you've got to
[1:36:32] judge you got to judge fairly you can't
[1:36:36] you can't you
[1:36:37] can't and and I think if the
[1:36:39] congregation knows then that that gives
[1:36:42] that gives them a um a little more
[1:36:46] credibility you know amen anyone else
[1:36:58] well I know this wasn't the way that you
[1:36:59] planned on this going here
[1:37:02] tonight and
[1:37:10] um but brother brother Harry had given
[1:37:14] the the other on on on how that you know
[1:37:17] I I like the way he well we're all going
[1:37:19] to play a tape at a certain time time
[1:37:21] you know we're going to everyone has to
[1:37:23] everyone has to get on the the internet
[1:37:25] and do it this way that is usurping
[1:37:28] Authority Beyond now I have no problem I
[1:37:31] I have no problem listening to the tape
[1:37:33] of the day the quote of the day I have
[1:37:35] no problem with that but but but someone
[1:37:37] saying you've got to come under this
[1:37:39] order and this is the way it's got to be
[1:37:42] I think that's what brother Harry used
[1:37:44] the other night on it and that becomes
[1:37:47] our spirituality as long as as long as
[1:37:50] we're f following you know what what
[1:37:53] Jeffersonville is telling us to do then
[1:37:56] you know I think we should listen to
[1:37:58] tapes every day not just not just one
[1:37:59] day out of the week
[1:38:01] myself I think we need to and I don't
[1:38:04] think we just need to be reading just
[1:38:07] the quote of the
[1:38:08] day I think we need to get into the
[1:38:10] message and listen to the message that's
[1:38:12] right and I think if there were more of
[1:38:14] us listening to the message we wouldn't
[1:38:16] be following blindly with a lot of this
[1:38:18] other stuff and saying well uh they
[1:38:21] don't listen to the message too much A
[1:38:23] lot of these in order to follow it don't
[1:38:26] take too much to know you know when when
[1:38:28] the Thunder group was was whining and
[1:38:29] dining me and trying to get me to go I
[1:38:32] mean it hey it was attractive the
[1:38:34] Thunder group was attractive I mean they
[1:38:36] had actionpack Services I mean people
[1:38:39] were I mean I'm thinking Whoa man all
[1:38:43] right I can do this Hallelujah and and
[1:38:46] you hearing the message oh yes and wow
[1:38:50] and so
[1:38:51] but then after
[1:38:54] I begin to hear what they've gotten I
[1:38:56] thought well that I don't remember
[1:38:57] brother brandom putting it quite that
[1:38:59] way and nah brother brandom didn't say
[1:39:02] that and so then I'd go I say okay all
[1:39:05] right give me your quotes give me your
[1:39:06] quotes they gave me 50 pages of quotes
[1:39:09] and so I'm reading all these quotes and
[1:39:11] then I seen some were spliced in this
[1:39:13] and the other and I'm
[1:39:16] going no thank you no thank you that's
[1:39:18] not what I
[1:39:20] want huh take it like he said take it

[1:42:06] the devil took the life
[1:42:10] out so we can't be satisfied being with
[1:42:13] just being message
