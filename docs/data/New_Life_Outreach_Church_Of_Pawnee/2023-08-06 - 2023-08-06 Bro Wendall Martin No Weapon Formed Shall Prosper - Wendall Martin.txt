to be here this morning good to see everyone uh here in the house of the Lord and and we sure appreciated the the song service and uh and the special from our our sisters and uh I tell you what I was enjoying that back there in the office praise the Lord and so we we certainly do appreciate that what a wonderful uh uh birthday party we had yesterday huh my sister-in Lois's birthday and uh uh wonderful food and fellowship and uh I tell you what it was almost like going into a theme park or something amen and praise the Lord let's look here in the book of Isaiah of the um the 54th chapter and um we'll we'll start here at the 16th verse praise the name of Jesus good to see everyone here today and trust everyone has had a wonderful week and um man we are praying for those who aren't here amen our Revival is coming up and so that's something to to be excited about amen and we're sure looking forward to what God has in store let's look here at Isaiah 54 and 16. it says behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals and the fire that bringeth forth an instrument for his work I have created the waster to destroy but no weapon formed or that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee and judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for the many blessings that you have given us thank you for the wonderful rain and Lord and cooling the weather down a little bit for his father and replenishing and and renewing the the grass and trees and we thank you for that Lord we thank you for your spiritual Reign here on the inside of the building this morning and Lord we're just asking that their rain would soak our hearts and renew and re-energize Lord thank you for healing power to those Lord who are present Lord who have been faithful to come and Lord for those who who cannot come Lord and they're at home just asking Lord that you would be with them and encourage and strengthen and heal father we ask that you would have the preeminence in this service that you would speak Lord in his as only the words that you want and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen we want to minister here this morning amen uh on a on a little thought no weapon formed against you shall prosper amen somebody say no weapon formed against thee shall prosper amen that's some of you know how about us all say it now no weapons formed against thee shall prosper amen now there's a lot of weapons in the world today there's uh there's we've got the nuclear weapons in the hands of unstable governments we've got terrorists who who love to breed fear in the hearts by by their weapons amen they um amen they they don't have to have a way of a a of a plane or a gun they can make bombs they can uh they they they can they've strapped suicide vests to themselves and and go into uh places and and and blow themselves up along with the other people they they they will get in a car and amen drive into a crowded place and blow it up and amen and so uh there's many weapons many weapons that you can that can be used to destroy and and there is there has been a cry amen for uh nuclear disarmament from uh from these evil regimes that are out there that has there's been long talks of the intentions of Iran and you know the uh don't let them enrich uranium because they've made specific evil comments to destroy uh we've had North Korea sending Rockets we've got China flexing its muscle there's a a lot of talk about weapons and there's a a lot of talk about armies amen but God says there's no weapon that is formed against you that is going to prosper amen we've had a lot of debate on gun control in in our country here these last several years and amen it seems like we've had so many of the mass shootings and weapons at the disposal of of bad and evil wicked men and Evil Hearted men and so many are saying that we've got to remedy it by confiscating all of the weapons amen many say that we need to arm more people with weapons we've we've got amen but as long as there is is uh uh uh um on Earth and Evil on the earth there's there's going to be no peace and there's going to be no place and no safety except for the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's right Amen in the recent months we've had uh people using objects thrown in concerts and injuring the performers and giving him stitches so you can do away with the guns you can do away with the nuclear warfare you can do away with a lot of things but as long as there is evil in the hearts of men there are weapons around but I've heard the voice of the Lord say there is not a weapon formed against you that is going to prosper amen can you say Amen amen but then there's the onslaught of the weapons that are uh uh of the enemy against our souls and these are spiritual weapons that are formed against the people of God Amen and boy does he know how to use Mass uh weapons of mass destruction when it comes to the souls of man amen men and women there are we're living in an age where where where where Satan has so uh broken homes and broken marriages and broken are young people in the heritage is it and even our soul but yet we are standing here with the promise that no weapon formed against you shall prosper now now amen that doesn't say that there wasn't going to be any weapons it didn't say that he was going to confiscate all the weapons he didn't say that he was going to annihilate all the weapons he said in any weapon that has formed against you will not Prosper somebody say no weapon formed against me shall prosper no weapon formed against me shall prosper you know what I'm going to stand upon the promises of God because God's word cannot lie When God says it he means it now there's a lot of Weaponry out there there's a lot of Amen a lot of things that are out there but if God says it that I'm going to believe it amen now the scripture says this is the heritage of the Saints of the Lord for their righteousness is of me amen so it's not depending upon my righteousness it's not depending upon yours it's depending upon his righteousness now I want us to to think for a for a few moments as we look here at this 54th chapter of the book of Isaiah because if you were to look in the first of the 54th chapter you would see that amen Jerusalem is is is as a mother that is weeping for her children amen of course this is symbolic of of the amen God putting Israel away as a divorced wife amen as you read on down through there you will find that Israel had been carried away into Babylon and and that she had as uh you know been carried away for 70 years and she had lost her sons and her daughters and she had become like a a barren woman without a husband and Israel had provoked God unto anchor amen and so according to Ezra the the second chapter the scripture says that she was reduced down to 42 000 people amen that was all that came out of captivity uh there in when they came out of Babylon now that's quite a contrast from the 2.5 million that came out of Egypt at the beginning amen so she truly was a woman without her children she was as a widow amen she she was you know broken and bruised and amen and if you were to read in fact amen man I I I'll just go ahead and read some of it for you here in Isaiah 54 and and and one and it says single Baron thou that ditch not bear and Break Forth into singing and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child for more of the children of the death slip than the children of the married wife saith the Lord enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitation spare not and lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy Stakes for Thou shalt Break Forth on the right hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make desolate cities to be inhabited fear not for thou shall not be ashamed neither shall thou be confounded for thou shall not be put to shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of thy you that shall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more for thy maker is thine husband and the Lord of hosts is his name thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the Lord the god of the whole Earth shall he be called for the Lord hath called thee a woman Forsaken and grieved in spirit a wife of Youth when she when thou was refused saith the Lord thy God and for a small moment have I forsaken thee but with great Mercy will I gather thee in a little wrath I hit my face from from thee for a moment but with Everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee saith the Lord thy God Amen and he's and he goes on down and he continues but you see amen you see God is now affectionately calling unto Israel amen before and he's telling them now he's saying now before the child in Army had came in and carried you into the land of Babylon you were mine amen and before your stubbornness and before you you willfully walked away from my word you were mine I've allowed you to go in amen and you have suffered and amen you have gone through some of the some of the the shame that that you have had to endure you're coming back home you're embarrassed you're you're coming back home and amen and your head is not really hanging too high but he's telling them but I want you to know I want you to remember you are mine amen you've always been mine you oh well praise the Lord now I've created the waster to destroy I created the Smith to make an iron amen but there is no happened somebody say no weapon now I I'm saying this here this morning is because many times we get into the to the areas of our life where we walk contrary to the word of God we walk contrary to what God has said in our lives and many times amen he has to bring his his arms amen his Swift hand of of Correction and many a times where we're living in our you know in the regrets and we're living in the in the situations of of hurts and fears and amen and regrets of the past amen you remember if God is correcting his sons and daughters he's got a reason for it you have always been his son and you will always be his son he's got a purpose in what he is doing well praise the Lord now many times we we quote that quote amen for the weapons of our Warfare amen are not carnal But Mighty through God but yet we fail to realize many a times we're having to stand up in the midst amen of a failure and come into recovery now I want us to look for look at this for a moment amount he says now you've come back broken and bruised you've suffered embarrassments you've you've borne the reproach of your failings amen but he says I'm going to redeem you back to myself amen I will be a husband to you again and your barrenness will be forgotten and your sin of your youth amen shall be forgiven and this city shall once again be inhabited well praise the name of the Lord amen so he says I want you to enlarge your tents Amen in other words I want you to make your heart bigger I want you to make your home bigger I want you to add rooms to your home I want you to prepare you who were once Barren and Forsaken and I want you a man to look at the promise that I've given you for truly your seed shall possess the gates of the enemy you shall possess the Gentiles can you say amen I just want to say here this morning amen I want to talk a little bit on recovery because as we have been as we have been talking lately amen many of times we we can look and see how uh in our lives amen we go through the seasons of purification amen just amen as as there are periods of cycles of time amen for for a woman so is there for the bride of Christ there is there are Cycles amen a purification where God comes in into his and begins to work in his church and begins to really a man to to bring things to light and say you need to be purified and his blood begins to wash us and purify us well can you say Amen it's in those times that God begins to shine the light upon our lives and we can see where we've allowed sin where we've allowed things we've allowed bitterness we've allowed things to to come in and to dominate our lives amen may all that time you're still the bride of Christ you've just got to be renewed you've got to be refreshed you have got to be a man cleansed from within can you say Amen and God sends situations our way and as we're looking many times we feel like a woman forsaken amen we feel like amen but and then we're looking at and we're just feeling like a man where my victory of yesterday amen my joy of yesterday my peace of yesterday everything that I once had amen the presence of God of yesterday amen it seems like somehow a murder or another I've allowed myself to wander off to wander off and here I wake up amen and I'm like a Samson here I am amen with my eyes put out here I am I'm feeling like I am all alone you ever been there Hallelujah amen but even Samson when he was all alone even Samson when it seemed like amen he had veered so far off from God hallelujah amen God had control of his hair and God had control of his power I want to say God had control of his hair and God had control of his power now his eyes were put out and he was going to suffer the consequences can you say Amen but when Samson began to Humble himself and Samson began to call out to God and Samson says God I've been wrong I've wandered all somehow someway somewhere here I am grinding at the meal of the very Philistines that I once slaughtered Hallelujah amen now Satan's there telling him Satan's there telling him you've made your bet and now you gotta lay in it you went against the word of God and now you've got to live with it amen you were ordained of God to defeat the Philistines you were raised up you were told not to cut the locks of your hair and now here you are amen here you are grinding at the meal you're a has been you've been forsaken of Hallelujah but there was a cry in that predestinated seeds art that was saying God I want you to forgive me God just once more God Let Your Presence come once more God if you take me once more Say Amen the scripture says that there were more Philistines killed by that blind weak Hebrew slave well praise the Lord I said he was blind he was weak he had become a slave to the Philistines but God was faithful well let me tell you something I have created the waster to destroy I have created this myth to bring back there's no weapon formed against you that shall prosper you are mine I've ordained you you have my promise can you say Amen now I want you to strengthen I want you to say Amen strengthen your stakes and I want you to even lengthen your cards I want you to enlarge your tent in other words modern day it's time to start adding on head on to your house because you're fixed you're you're fixing to have some children and hey man I'm going to be a husband to you Hallelujah now you've you've wandered off and amen you've you've you you've went astray but you've always been mine I'm bringing you back to me amen you're you're no longer haughty anymore well come on church amen you you were once hottie that's the reason why you got off where you got off amen you were once self-sufficient that's the reason you wandered off how you wandered off if you would have stayed with me at the beginning if you would have stayed with my work if you would have stayed with my spirit if you would have stayed amen with what I called you to do amen you wouldn't be here where you are but even in your mess you are still mine you are still mine can you say man amen and what God Amen is doing to the bride Amen in this last day I know the church has wandered off for seven ages it seems like she's wandered here and wondered there but I want you to know church I want you to know little pride you are mine you are my and no weapon formed against you is going to prosper for the Lord is called thee sixth verse a woman forsaken Hallelujah and grieved in spirit and the wife of Youth when thou was refused for a small moment I've forsaken you but with great Mercies will I gather thee in a little wrath I hit my face from the for a moment but with Everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee saith the Lord thy God the Redeemer for this it says the Waters of Noah unto me for as I have sworn that the Waters of Noah should no more go over the Earth so have I sworn that I will not be wrath with thee nor rebuke thee for the mountains shall depart somebody say hallelujah and the hills be removed but my kindness shall not depart from thee neither shall the Covenant of my peace be removed saith the Lord that hath Mercy on thee Oh thou Afflicted toss with the Tempest and not Comfort it behold I will lay thy stones with Fair colors and lay thy foundations with sapphires I will make those windows as a Gates and thy agates has as carbon uncles and thy borders of of the pleasant stones and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the Peace of thy children in righteousness shall thou be established Thou shalt be far from oppression for Thou shalt not fear and and from uh for and from Terror for it shall not come near thee behold they shall utterly gather together but not by me whosoever gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake the only reason you went babbling is because I allowed you to go to Bad Blood the only reason I you went through that trial is because I allowed you to go through that trial the only reason amen you've gone through that trap place is because I've allowed you amen but I'm here to tell you I am bringing you back [Applause] can you say Amen so Satan can do nothing without you Satan can do nothing towards you without God allowing can you say Amen amen they shall gather together and against thee and shall fall for thy sake but I have created the Smith that bloweth the coves in the fire and bringeth forth an instrument for his work I have created a waste or destroy but no weapons somebody say no way have you said that already no weapon formed against thee shall prosper Hallelujah can you say Amen God loves to renew now God loves to test God's not one that is going to let you get by with sin he's not going to let you get by with nonsense amen he's uh he's a he's a but he loves he's a God that loves to renew he's a God that loves to restore he's a God that loves to reinvigorate God allows you to fall flat on your face God allows you Amen to see yourself that you are a failure to begin with aim can you say amen amen and when you have found that you cannot when you have found that you are a failure when you have found that there is no ability of your own he says I will give I I I will give power unto the faith there in Isaiah 42. I will give strength I will give power I will renew saith the Lord can you say man to them that have no might I'll increase strength even the youth shall faint and become weary and utterly fall but they that wait somebody say but they that wait a man they that know that they are whipped they that know amen they who comes to grips with the reality that they need God they who are willing to Humble themselves before God and pray amen God will forgive their sins and he will heal their land can you say man he'll renew their strength so that they mount up with the wings as Eagles and they shall run and not be weary amen Joel talks about uh to backslit in Israel amen and is he is is he is dealing there in in their in Joel too amen he's he's talking about Israel that is that has wandered away from Christ the word become quite independent and self-sufficient amen who it had suffered the the the the reproach the embarrassment of a reproach and the scripture says amen God says I have sent to my great Army amen I have sent the caterpillar amen the devil didn't send it I sent it but I want to tell you it's not to destroy it's to bring you back to your power and you say man and he says if you come to me with if you just read it you come to me with all your heart with your fasting and you're weeping and you're mourning for your wrongs and let the ministers and the Saints repent hallelujah amen if you go there to the 19th verse Joel 2 and 19. it says yea the Lord will answer and say unto his people behold I will send you corn and one and oil and you shall be satisfied therewith and I will no more make you a reproach among the Heathen for I will remove for off from you the northern Army and will drive him into a land Barren and desolate with his face toward the East sea and his

are y'all understanding what he's saying it is the time of restoration now remember now this scripture is deep this is prophecy that is dealing with the church amen this was the prophecy that was going to be coming but in the days of restoration why did Elijah have to come to restore what did Jesus say amen I must go and Elijah must first come and restore all things Amen in other words the church was going to go through amen those four stages amen they were going to that the tree was going to lose its leaves it was going to lose its fruit it was going to lose its bark and it was going to get down to the very life the root of the tree but God said it was an Army that he had sent to reprove that tree but there was going to be a restoration time to come back right what is that restoration time amen by the time you got into your another time you got into the Catholic age there was the Dark Age everything was gone there was nothing left it looked hopeless but there was a little laugh that was in the tree and then out of the out of the old tree a man that had been pruned all the way down here come justification by faith and amen it began to Spring out and here come amen what was it it was beginning to restore here come amen sanctification here come the gifts of the Spirit Here Comes This one into Perfection I'm here to tell you today that this is the church that God is going to restore amen he's not looking at the church of what it was in in the Dark Ages and what it's been in the past but he's got a pride he's got somebody that he's had his hand upon he's got somebody a man that that is that is sensitive to his spirit and saying God not by might not by power but God it's by your spirit I rest in you I trust in you I believe in you you are my husband you say man amen and what did God say he man that there's rain the former Hallelujah what did the scripture say in the New Testament the promise was that the former and the latter rain would come to and fall together amen we're witnessing that he said the 24th verse and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years the locusts hath Eden canker worm and the caterpillar the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty aren't you glad for this word that God has sent to us you shall eat in plenty

pleasure in you Hallelujah you shall lead in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel that I am the Lord your God and none else my people shall never be ashamed can you say man now as we have been ministering lately amen uh upon amen a disciplined this is a

want to leave a child behind I don't want nobody missing this Rapture I don't want my children my grandchildren I don't want any of this church missing this Rapture can you see man amen the only way that we're going to stand up against that Spirit outside those doors is to get some discipline on the inside we need men to be men and we need women to be women we need women to stay out of the place of the man and we need the man to stay out of the place of the women and we need to stand upon the conviction of God's word I say today there is restoration Among Us can you say Amen amen if it's just become a part of life where you can just easily stand up to your man and tell him where to get off you're uh you're you're wrong and you're as just as wrong as this as Israel was to God you you don't stand up to your man you don't stand up to your man and yell at him you don't stand up to your leader amen well who makes you well what makes you but you're you're well I'll tell you what uh you are dead wrong Hallelujah come on hi boy Hallelujah Hallelujah you don't God's made you to be the feminist the sweet God has built you to subdue Your Man by the feminist side and if your man is subdued by

Brandon says he made that Burly spirit for the man made the tender little delicate feminist spirit for the woman and when you see a woman act like a man she's just out of her place you see in the beginning all right I think it's a shame that a woman has lost her dainty feminist place it's a disgrace I tell you it is I you know I I'm going to say this now I'm not talking about you women here but of course if it hurts well it's yourself amen but look you you ask me something or let me ask you something it used to be that women was so feminist till a man would go to talking to them they'd blush huh what what is blushing anyhow I haven't seen it in so long I would never I wouldn't even know what it is amen if some woman blush well they haven't got any of that dignity anymore all of that they're a fine feminist Spirit they wear their clothes like a man they cut their hair like a man they smoke like a man they drink like a man they cuss like a man they work like a man they become so rough and barely oh my that shows where you've got to that's exactly right amen the little lady like your you see you don't see her much anymore she's a hard person to find isn't that right yes that's the truth so a woman is not supposed to stand up and act like a man digging Burly because she's dainty amen a feminist spirit amen she is sweet loving not big carrying on acting like a man what she's not supposed to be when when she does that her life is perverted she's sweet loving kind where Adam is more the Burly type for he was the man the masculine type the woman is the feminist can you say Amen now now brother Brandon would go on down and say now I'm not saying this necessarily to you sisters amen because you've got that sweet spirit amen but that's the spirit of the age that is out there can you say amen amen he says now remember when you act that way like a man you're out of your place when a man begins to get so too and babying and this that and the other he's out of his place when he is babing and becoming a [Music] Hallelujah well can you say amen he said do you know what's wrong for you to be uh for you not to be the husband of your house your wife gets a little temper

exactly right do you know sister that your husband is not your only your husband that he is your ruler isn't that what the Bible said come out we want the spirit of God Samson has got to come Hallelujah some of us have woke up and we found out amen that we're in the prison house we're we're grinding meal to the devil I don't care whether it's a man or it's a woman amen whether we're grinding to the meal we're grinding at the meal we're grinding at the meal but if there is a desire on the inside of your heart saying I God I am a covenant I'm a covenant bride member God there's something on the inside of me I want to tell you if there's a cry for once more if there is a cry for God Amen forgive me and bring me back let me be the man you've ordained let me be the woman that you've ordained let me be the Son of God the devil come on church let me be what you want me to be when we become disciplined in our prayer disciplined and are coming back to God discipline to say

Church well y'all might as well start amening with me here you know what's the truth amen if not I've got a backslitting congregation if you can't amen God's word amen I want to tell you we want God's

brother Branham Hallelujah I didn't bring the quote I put it on the prayer app the other day because I quoted it but you remember brother Branham says that there there is there are genes the male genes are beginning to pervert he says because feminist women are no longer women until men are burning in lust for men well praise the Lord married to a woman and you're having to answer and to hold her ten percent all of her all of her nonsense that's not the way God intended it God did not intend a man to be a God intended a man to be a man and he intended a woman to love and honor and respect her man well praise the Lord I wouldn't even read those quotes but I'm here to tell you again I'm glad I brought them now hallelujah amen maybe we forgot those quotes hallelujah amen but no weapon you said brother Wendell here I am I'm often I'm off in the him I'm off in the north 40s somewhere God don't even know where I'm at I don't even know what to do I don't know where I'm at God knows where you are you're his and God allowed you to wander off oh come on church he allows his Spirit to be pulled off but I want to tell you that does not change the fact that you are eternally God's that does not change the fact that you're a daughter of God that you're a Son of God that just simply means amen that you got to start crying out and the Bible says amen they're in Egypt when they went down into Egypt amen the Bible says God heard the Cry of his people when the cry began to come before God when the language begin to come before God when everything of our soul began to scream out I need my God then God came to running and God came to working and God came to delivering well come on church God says no weapon formed against you shall prosper can you say Amen now the Zeal of the age is repentant I Repent of my selfish ways can you say man brother Bradham says now enticing Spirits he says brother Branham I'm sick and tired of these old little things these little things I've got petty things that's hung on to me so long I'm always talking how to turn I'm doing things that I shouldn't do I I know it's not becoming to a Christian I don't want to do that God knows I don't I don't want

brother there don't treat me right I'll pray for him if my daddy don't treat me right I'll love him if my wife don't that doesn't treat me right or my husband I'll go about humble before God Amen Lord I look only to your kingdom I want my mind straight I Want My Heart full of joy I want to go about when trouble is really buzzing around me and I still want to stand with my hands up and my heart cure before you Lord knowing this that someday somebody say someday someday I will meet you I want that kind of an experience that allows that allows God allows the dry seasons God allows God pulls his Spirit back God does that because he knows that you came from his side he knows that your bone of his bone your flesh of his flesh God knows that without him you are nothing God knows and sometimes God will hide his face so that we will begin to seek him and honor him honor his love honor his word honor his Spirit honor his prayer well come on when you feed him in the morning time when you're getting up you're not just quick to just run off you're going to stop that's okay I'll put my coffee off for a minute I feel your presence I want to talk to you Lord amen when it when he comes and he's dealing with you you're not so quick to run out to play basketball but you stop his presence is in the room I want to honor him while he's near Wallace while he's near where wherever if I feel him in the church I'm going to stop and put everything on hold it don't matter about the Sunday dinner it don't matter about McDonald's it don't matter about the fellowship what matters is he's here I feel him he's talking to me I want to honor his presence can you say Amen he says now I'm bringing you back oh it seems like I hid my face from you but your ending is none that of a barren woman you're ending is not that a man of of Brokenness can you say mine Hallelujah Oh Glory to God let me just let the devil know something right now the devil sometimes says I've got God's children right where I want them all God's forsaken them let me just let you know something right now you numbskull of a devil listen to me real good if God allows you to do anything to God's people it will never be to destroy us it'll never be to destroy us if God allows anything come on God told Moses he said Moses so I want you to I I I I I want you to strike I want you to speak to the Rock and Moses in his anger against the people he smelt The Rock again and he broke all the types he broke the type he had already smoked the rock once then God said speak Christ The Rock was to be smoking once once and for all and today we are to speak not Smite speak Moses broke the type and God told Moses because of your disobedience you're not allowed to go into that Promised Land Moses stood and God took him upon the mountain God says look over the land this is I want you to know that it's real this is what you have brought the people to and Moses got to look over into that land that's a faithful prophet but God could not allow him to go over because of his disobedience can you sing man the Bible says the Bible says that when Moses died Satan came up and started disputing with Michael the Archangel come to bury him Moses amen Michael the Archangel come to take him and the Bible says that Satan withstood Michael and saying he's not yours he disobeyed he's not able to go up into the Promised Land he's mine and Mark and and Michael viarca Michael just looked at him and the Bible says he did not even bring any kind of railing accusation didn't he just says the Lord rebuke thee Satan with his gleeful I thought that he had the prophet Moses but God says no he is mine thank you he was always mine he was mine before he's mine now and you ain't got him the Lord rebuked thee are you hearing me devil I I said are you hearing me Old Devil you that tries to manipulate families you that tries to destroy families you that tries to destroy amen individuals men and women and boys and girls they are not yours they never were yours and you cannot have them the blood of Jesus Christ has redeemed these men and women the blood of Jesus Christ are y'all listening to me here tonight amen this morning I say there should be a joy in the hearts of the believer Satan cannot destroy you because there's something in the heart of the believer that Satan does not have and that's the ability to say I'm wrong Satan never could Satan never will his son Cain could not would not even after he was given the opportunity but a believer is one who can repent you know what is the Zeal of the age what is the Zeal of laodicea repent what's the characteristics of this age it's a lukewarm woman who is saying her self-estimation as I have got it all and I have need of nothing and her husband on the outside of the house saying you're naked you're wretched you're miserable and you're flat out deceived her interpretation of herself is quite different than that of her husband praise the Lord but what did God say inside that stagnant Church he says I'm calling to the individual If any man boy woman girl hear my voice and opens the door I will come in and sup with him I will I will the scripture says he will wash our eyes with eye saith God repentance he says be zealous therefore and repent repent what is repent repent is saying hey I wandered off repentance is saying hey I'm wrong repentance is saying Lord let your word Lord I want to be disciplined by your word I want your word to have the absolute in my life I want it to be the absolute in my mind I want it to be the absolute of my actions I want to be in my place everywhere that you've ordained me to be can you see man amen can I remind the devil of something else Hallelujah who can lay anything to the church of God's elect [Applause] hey you hey you the one that was created to destroy hey you you I've created the waster to destroy hey I've created hey you that's got your weapons and you think you can destroy me with them hey you who can condemn the elect for it is God g-o-d that justifies Hallelujah the last time I heard Satan ain't God Satan ain't God God is the one that justifies God's the one who came in a in a body God's the one who died on Calvary God's the one who provided Redemption for me it's Christ that justify it for whom he did for no and predestinate and call and glorify are the ones that he has already pronounced righteous through his blood well can you say Amen Hallelujah I want to just tell you right now there ain't nobody better get in and I'll just tell Hallelujah don't nobody should get in between a marriage spat Allelujah don't ever get in between the marriage fat because that you might be on that girl's side right now and she might and you and you might boy you might be looking like a hero but I'm here to tell you hey man she's going back home and Daddy might be as mad and you he's going to go listen they love each other they're just in a spot right now what praise the Lord come on church amen and I just want to tell that Old Devil don't you get in between me and God he might have to correct me occasionally and I might get out of line okay he never gets out of line he's the great Eternal one I get out of line occasionally and we go through a little bit of a tussle but my [Applause] can you say Amen Romans 8 31. what shall we say then to these things if God be for us what weapon can be against us he that spirit is not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elected as God that justify who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us can I hear an amen from the bride he told David there in Psalms 89 and 20. and if you go to the 20 to the 29th verse oh my he's talking about how good that he's going to be to David and and he he says I have found David my servant with my holy oil I anointed him my hands shall be with whom my hand shall be established my arms shall strengthen him the enemy shall not exact upon him nor the son of wickedness afflict him I will beat down his foes and plague them that hate him but my faithfulness and my Mercy shall be with him and my name shall his horn or his strength be exalted I will set his hand also in the sea in his right hand in the rivers he shall cry unto me thou art my father my God the rock of my salvation I will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the earth my Mercy will I keep for him forever and my Covenant shall stand fast with him his seed will I make also to endure forever and his throne has the days of heaven but God don't stop there and he says and when he fails I'm going to visit him with a rod of iron I'm yeah God still believes in spankings amen back when we were kids we call them they were called weapons amen but you can't call them weapons anymore amen now they're spankings and uh but God still believed in nine and the scripture says in his children forsake my law and walk not in in my judgments if they break my statutes and keep not my Commandments I will visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes nevertheless say nevertheless my loving kindness will not will I not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fall uh fail my Covenant will I not break not alter the things that is going out of my mouth once have I sworn by my Holiness that I will not lie unto David now Hallelujah are you catching the J the jest of my message here this morning God is a god of recovery God is a god of restoration God's a God who means his who means business he's a god that'll let you fall into captivity he's a God Amen that'll forsake you as a divorced woman amen and you'll find out that you you don't you you ain't got it without him you ain't got it without him Hallelujah somebody say oh you can't use that God use the word divorce I did Hallelujah can you say Amen in other words amen he he's he's not going to put up with nonsense not gonna put up with nonsense but I guarantee you when that feminist Spirit comes right back out that little feminine amen that little feminine Spirit comes right back to where it belongs I guarantee you God's going to come running God's gone [Laughter] because he loves you and he wants you and he's you or his life amen but there ain't enough room amen for for two kings In Heaven There ain't enough room for two kings in the in in the home there ain't enough room for two kings in the church there ain't enough well praise the Lord God's got a king he's he's the king and he wants a queen I'm I want to be his Queen I want to be that one that loves him that honors him that understands my position in him and so our weapons the greatest thing that we could ever have is Lord give me a heart of humility forgive me Lord try me one more time as the song goes I'll be yours if you'll be mine if a fall or if I fail let me rise and try again Forgive Me Lord and try me one more time as we close the weapons they have got weapons y'all remember I think it's back in the early 90s how many was born before the 90s before 1990. y'all remember I was wondering I'm glad you raised your hand up there brother Ken amen you remember when Saddam Hussein was sending the scud missiles over to Israel and he was he was trying to hit and kill civilians military he didn't he didn't care who he was hitting he just he was just Hallelujah and was telling him you'd better be good and he said he was retaliating against the west and retaliating against things and so but we came up with the missile defense system that was called I believe it's called The Patriot missile defense system and so what why what are those in those countries where the and so when when Saddam The Madman was launching his stuff over the Patriot defense missiles would come out and blow his missiles right up in the air without them Landing upon the people right well glory to God I said glory to God and when the enemy is coming in like a flood it's a barrage of scud missiles and he's just out there to destroy you destroy your family destroy your job destroy your church destroy everything about you you just remember that God's got a patriot Heavenly Patriot defense system shoot that thing right on he will take what he wanted to kill you with and he'll blow it up are y'all hearing me Hallelujah you know what I'm telling you know what I'm telling the devil what you're trying to destroy the family is with we're going to blow it up it's gonna blow up in your face you ain't gonna you ain't got no power over me you ain't got no power over my family you ain't got no power over my church you ain't got no power over my wife my husband my child come on Church you ain't got no power over my soul you ain't got no power of my attitude you ain't got no power over my face you ain't got no power over anything I'm using the word of God now these were so equipped that it it it was a it was a heat-seeking missile and and as it was coming those things those things you didn't have to have them just lined up perfectly if you just got them in the general direction those things and it didn't matter how the devil brought him in how the devil tried to destroy it didn't matter what there was no are y'all are y'all no weapon formed against you that shall prosper but now he's told him now now I've allowed you to go into captivity I'm bringing you back I'm bringing you back to me Stay With Me where I am Devils can't stand where I am victories are all around can you see man and I just want to say that the word of God Amen now Ephesians 6 talks about all the defensive amen the armor man there's the there's the shield of Faith there's the there's the breastplate of righteousness this helmet of salvation she the feet shout about with the preparation of the Gospel law and skirt about with truth but there's one offensive weapon and that's the reason why we're lining everything that we are up with that weapon and you talking about a heat-seeking missile this is a demon-seeking missile and if you keep that thing activated it'll knock those weapons out of the Skies coming and going it'll keep the enemy out of your mind if you'll allow the word to do that can you say amen I was telling someone the other day you can either look at the situations that are not exactly the way they should be and there's nothing in your power to change that or you can look at your purpose that I am here with a Divine Purpose and Satan cannot destroy that purpose in my life God's word says it God's Prophet declared it as he looked through thousands and thousands of visions and he could say I say there is nothing that can destroy the purpose of God in one's life to allow those missiles to come into my mind telling me what this and that and no no no no no no I'm gonna send the word of God out and defeat it before it even hits me you say man amen do you love him if the musicians would come amen he's the one that has formed me he's the one that has called me I am his he is mine now you can say it you can say it and this is where this is where I've been coming back to the scripture a man coming back to being diligent and disciplined according to the word concerning me I must believe that word and I've got to be disciplined about it we're living in a non-disciplined age where the word has been torn and we understand it we we've seen it all the way back to the third third Church age where Jezebel seduced the servants we understand that was amen when when 83 25 I see a room we we understand those things where Jezebel started leading the church and before you know it amen the word of God become nothing an invalid she told lies listen folks the entire world entire world at one time entire world we're Catholics and none of it's based on truth come on but the prophet told us if you just keep telling a lie long enough and just keep saying you believe it and you'll make others believe it and you can convince yourself that you're right and you'll do what you're going to do because you believe it oh you might say oh man I wish I wouldn't oh man no you do it because that's who you are that's your belief system the world out there is doing what they do because they they believe it until here we are today incredible that it started in the church it did not start in society it started in the church way back in the early part until today now the church we he can identify as whatever you want to brother Wayne said something this morning that they have just passed a law they're in Michigan that you can you the right pronouns that you can go to jail for five years now I don't know if it's been signed yet but that's it's been passed by one of the houses and maybe both [Music] that you you we're talking about pronouns what we're talking about proper we're not talking about our pronouns we're talking about their kind of pronouns he she it whatever it's incredible the world is the world is Lawless but the church has been Lawless hundreds and hundreds of years the church has forsaken this a long time ago but the church should be the one that's bringing Society into the church governed by the church don't let this little group right here become a powerless body Let's Line ourselves up with his word let's ask God lord I want to be everything you want me to be [Music] I'm nothing without you and I want your favor can you say man I want your favor Lord thank you for bringing me back where I need to be thank you for calling me thank you for bringing me are you thankful that the Holy Spirit brings us right back in line [Music] this morning as we prepare to dismiss [Music] I wonder if the Holy Spirit [Music] good deal with our hearts in such a way [Music] foreign humility real genuine humility [Music] that says Lord I remember when I first came to you [Music] I was soft I was pliable I'm asking that you would send the waters back at the time of renew and come back Let the Rain Fall upon my soul [Music] let the anointing of the Holy Spirit [Music] let me crave it more than I crave anything else let me crave your anointing more than pizza Mexican food popularity [Music] I want your approval Lord I want your approval upon me help me Lord [Music] I believe he's here this morning [Music] oh God as we bow our heads search in your heart what does God mean to you today have you allowed tempers and Tantrums to characterize you and be allowed unbelief and foreign sluggishness [Music] to determine who you are [Music] have you just been satisfied with becoming just the norm of laodicea [Music] he loves you here today he's calling you [Music]
