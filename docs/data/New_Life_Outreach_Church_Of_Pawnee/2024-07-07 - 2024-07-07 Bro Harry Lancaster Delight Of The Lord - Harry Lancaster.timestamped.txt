[52:06] let's go ahead and turn to the Book of
[52:08] Psalms we're going to go to Psalms 1
[52:20] [Music]
[52:26] Psalms chapter 1 and we're going to read
[52:28] the the first two verses to
[52:38] start blessed is the man that walketh
[52:40] not in the counsel of The Godly ungodly
[52:43] nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor
[52:45] sth in the seat of the scornful but his
[52:47] Delight is in the law of the Lord and in
[52:50] his law doth he meditate day and night
[52:53] you all may have your seats
[53:03] in the church age book in The patmas
[53:06] Vision brother brandham says have you
[53:08] ever noticed how the world gets into the
[53:10] spirit of things that are in the world
[53:12] they go to their ball games their
[53:14] sporting events and their dances they
[53:16] enter into the spirit of it they they
[53:18] don't sit there like wild flowers old
[53:20] dried up sticks they enter right into
[53:22] the feet of things and become a part of
[53:23] things but oh how they hate the
[53:26] Christians for getting into the spirit
[53:27] of God's word they call us Fanatics and
[53:30] holy rollers there is nothing they they
[53:32] won't do to show their hatred and
[53:34] disapproval but ignore that you can
[53:36] expect it knowing where it is coming
[53:38] from just go on and get in the spirit of
[53:41] worship our spirit is clean it is fresh
[53:44] it is real it is a so it is sober and
[53:47] serious but nonetheless full of the joy
[53:49] of the Lord the Christian ought to be
[53:51] just as exuberant and full of his
[53:53] pleasure in the Lord as the world is
[53:54] when it savors and delights in its
[53:56] pleasure Pleasures both Christians in
[53:58] the world are human both have emotions
[54:00] the difference is the Christian's heart
[54:01] and emotions are purely on The Lord Of
[54:04] Glory and his love while the world
[54:07] satisfies the
[54:10] flesh so I want
[54:12] to minister a little bit this morning on
[54:16] the Delight of the
[54:17] Lord now in Psalms that we read here but
[54:21] in verse two when it says but his
[54:23] Delight is in the law of the Lord
[54:26] that word delight um comes from uh the
[54:32] word haets which is spelled he PES which
[54:36] means Delight or
[54:39] pleasure let's turn to Malachi CH
[54:50] 1 Malachi chapter 1 and we'll start at
[54:54] verse 6
[55:04] a son honth his father and a servant his
[55:06] master if then I be a father where is
[55:09] mine honor and if I be a master where is
[55:12] my fear sayith the lord of hosts unto
[55:14] you oh priests that despise my name and
[55:17] you say wherein have we despised thy
[55:19] name ye offer polluted bread upon my
[55:21] Altar and you say wherein have we
[55:24] polluted thee in that you say the table
[55:26] of the Lord is contemptible and you
[55:28] offer the blind for sacrifice is it not
[55:31] evil and if you offer the lame and sick
[55:33] is it not evil offer it now unto thy
[55:36] Governor will he be pleased with thee or
[55:38] accept thy person sayeth the Lord of
[55:40] hosts and now I pray you beseech God
[55:43] that he will be gracious unto us this
[55:46] hath been your means will he regard your
[55:48] person sayith the Lord of hosts who is
[55:51] there even among you that would shut the
[55:52] doors for not neither do you Kindle Fire
[55:55] on mine altar for not I have no pleasure
[55:58] in you sayith the Lord of hosts neither
[56:00] will I accept an offering at your
[56:04] hand and in 1st Samuel chapter
[56:09] 15 1st Samuel chapter 15 and verse
[56:13] 22 very familiar
[56:17] passage and Samuel said hath the Lord as
[56:20] great Delight in burnt offerings and
[56:23] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[56:25] the Lord behold to obey is better than
[56:28] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[56:30] the
[56:31] Rams now as I said the the word that was
[56:34] used in Psalms
[56:37] chapter 1 and verse 2 is this word heets
[56:41] and the same word is used in both the
[56:43] verses that we read in Malachi and in
[56:45] Samuel as it's now talking
[56:49] about what pleasure what Delight does
[56:52] the Lord have often when we talk
[56:57] about the Delight of the Lord or we
[57:00] might talk about it as Delight in the
[57:01] Lord we'll be talking about how it's
[57:04] what we should be delighting in and what
[57:06] we as Christians should Delight in the
[57:08] word of God and as it said in Psalms we
[57:11] should be meditating on it but I think
[57:14] sometimes that we don't necessarily take
[57:18] the time to think about what is it that
[57:20] Delights our Lord what is it that that
[57:23] he Delights in as we're serving him I
[57:25] mean when you look at the fact that it's
[57:27] the same as when uh what it should be
[57:30] with your spouses you're going to you
[57:31] want to do what's going to please your
[57:33] spouse you want to do what's going to
[57:35] Delight them yes we may want to do the
[57:38] things that will Delight us as well
[57:41] we're going to want to do things that we
[57:42] enjoy but at the same time if we love
[57:45] that person that's with us we're going
[57:47] to want to do the things that would
[57:48] please them we're going to want to do
[57:49] the things that would bring them joy
[57:52] that would bring them uh enjoyment um
[57:57] and so it's the same thing if we love
[57:59] the Lord if we're really wanting to
[58:01] serve him then we should be thinking
[58:02] about what is it that gives him pleasure
[58:05] what are the things that when he looks
[58:07] down he goes that's
[58:10] good that's something that that that he
[58:14] cares
[58:16] about so the first thing we kind of pull
[58:19] out as we're looking at 1st Samuel
[58:21] chapter
[58:22] 15 Samuel as he talking said hath the
[58:25] Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings
[58:27] and sacrifices as in obeying the voice
[58:29] of the Lord behold to obey is better
[58:32] than
[58:34] sacrifice so what would be one of the
[58:36] things that would please our lord well
[58:40] obedience would be one of the first
[58:42] things that we'd pull out as we go
[58:43] through the scriptures is are we obeying
[58:46] are we doing what he tells us are we
[58:48] doing are we following his instructions
[58:50] are we following his commands or are we
[58:53] going out and doing just whatever we
[58:54] feel like doing well this is what I want
[58:57] to do it doesn't matter what he wants
[59:00] what matters is what I want what's going
[59:01] to make me happy are we thinking about
[59:04] ourselves and our own enjoyment are we
[59:06] thinking about our Lord are we thinking
[59:09] about what's going to give him pleasure
[59:11] and that obedience that we give to
[59:15] him let's go to Micah chapter
[59:25] 6 Mah chapter 6 and we'll start at verse
[59:36] 6 Micah chapter 6 and verse 6 it starts
[59:39] off wherewith shall I come before the
[59:41] Lord and bow myself before the high God
[59:45] shall I come before him with burnt
[59:46] offerings with calves of a year old will
[59:50] the Lord be pleased with thousands of
[59:52] rams or with 10 thousands of rivers of
[59:54] oil shall I give my firstborn for a
[59:57] transgression the fruit of my body for
[59:59] the sin of my
[1:00:01] soul he hath showed thee oh man what is
[1:00:03] good and what does the Lord require of
[1:00:06] thee but to do justly and to love mercy
[1:00:09] and to walk humbly with thy
[1:00:12] God in verse 7 that when when Micah is
[1:00:17] asking the question will the Lord be
[1:00:22] pleased that's the word rasa
[1:00:27] which is to be pleased with be be
[1:00:29] favorable to
[1:00:32] accept and then as he goes on he says
[1:00:35] what does the Lord require of thee but
[1:00:37] to do justly to love Mercy to walk
[1:00:42] humbly so if we're making a a list as
[1:00:45] we're going through we have what's going
[1:00:48] to please our Lord the Lord's going to
[1:00:49] be pleased if we're obedient if we're
[1:00:52] doing what he says the Lord's going to
[1:00:54] be pleased when we're
[1:00:56] showing Justice when we're doing
[1:00:59] justly when we're showing Mercy when
[1:01:02] we're loving Mercy for those around us
[1:01:07] when we're walking in humil humility
[1:01:09] walking
[1:01:11] humbly these are the things that are
[1:01:13] going to please our Lord that are going
[1:01:14] to make him happy with us that are going
[1:01:16] to make him proud of us that are going
[1:01:18] to make him look down and go those are
[1:01:20] my children
[1:01:21] that's I'm happy with the way they're
[1:01:24] acting you the same way that
[1:01:26] as parents we want to be able to look at
[1:01:28] our children and go we're proud of them
[1:01:30] for doing this we're proud of them for
[1:01:31] acting this way we're proud for the way
[1:01:33] that they carry themselves we're proud
[1:01:34] for the character that we see in them
[1:01:38] and God's pointing out and going through
[1:01:39] the scripture going hey these are the
[1:01:40] pieces of the character that I'm looking
[1:01:42] for in you this is what I'm looking for
[1:01:44] you to be practicing this is what I'm
[1:01:46] looking for you to be doing and and and
[1:01:49] saying and how I want you to be
[1:01:54] living that's same word
[1:01:58] rasa is used over in
[1:02:01] Isaiah in Isaiah chapter
[1:02:04] 42 starting at verse
[1:02:10] one Isaiah 42 and verse one it says
[1:02:13] behold my servant whom I uphold my elect
[1:02:17] in whom my soul delighteth I have put my
[1:02:20] spirit upon him he shall bring forth
[1:02:22] judgment to the Gentiles he shall not
[1:02:25] cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to
[1:02:27] be heard in the street a bruised Reed
[1:02:30] shall he not break and the smoking flax
[1:02:32] shall he not quench he shall bring forth
[1:02:35] judgment unto truth he shall not fail
[1:02:37] nor be
[1:02:38] discouraged till he have set judgment in
[1:02:40] the earth and the Isles shall wait for
[1:02:42] his
[1:02:43] law thus saith God the Lord he that
[1:02:45] createth the heavens and stretch them
[1:02:47] out he that spread forth the Earth and
[1:02:49] that which cometh out of it he that
[1:02:51] giveth breath unto the people upon it
[1:02:53] and spirit to them that wal therein I I
[1:02:56] the Lord have called thee in
[1:02:57] righteousness and will hold thine hand
[1:02:58] and will keep thee and give thee for a
[1:03:01] covenant of the people for a light of
[1:03:02] the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to
[1:03:05] bring out the prisoners from the prisons
[1:03:07] and them that sit in darkness out of the
[1:03:09] prison
[1:03:12] house my elect in whom my soul delight
[1:03:15] and Isaiah is prophesying about Christ's
[1:03:17] coming
[1:03:19] and God is
[1:03:21] saying this is one that I delighteth in
[1:03:24] this is going to be the model if you're
[1:03:27] wanting to live a life that would
[1:03:30] Delight me that would please me that
[1:03:31] would make me happy here's the model for
[1:03:33] you to be living after here's the one
[1:03:35] for you to be copying here's the one for
[1:03:36] you to be following this is the one that
[1:03:39] I delighteth
[1:03:41] in and we go to Matthew chapter
[1:03:46] 12 Matthew chap 12 and starting at verse
[1:03:52] 14 it says then the Pharisees went out
[1:03:54] and held a counsel against him how they
[1:03:56] might destroy him but when Jesus knew it
[1:03:58] he withdrew himself from then and great
[1:04:01] multitudes followed him and he healed
[1:04:03] them all and charged them that they
[1:04:05] should not make him known that it might
[1:04:07] be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias
[1:04:09] the prophet saying behold my servant
[1:04:12] whom I have chosen my beloved in whom my
[1:04:14] soul is well pleased I will put my
[1:04:16] spirit upon him and he shall show
[1:04:17] judgment to the
[1:04:20] Gentiles this is the same scripture but
[1:04:22] what you find interesting is
[1:04:26] when it says my beloved in whom my soul
[1:04:27] is well pleased they actually in this
[1:04:30] time as they write it in the New
[1:04:31] Testament they use a different word in
[1:04:34] place and so when they use pleased here
[1:04:36] they use uh the word
[1:04:40] OKO EU d o k
[1:04:43] EO which means it seems good to one it
[1:04:46] is one's good pleasure or to be well
[1:04:48] pleased with to take pleasure in to be
[1:04:51] favorably inclined towards one
[1:04:58] that word continues to be used multiple
[1:05:00] times as we continue to go through the
[1:05:01] New Testament if we go to uh Matthew
[1:05:04] chapter
[1:05:08] 3 Matthew chapter 3 and verse
[1:05:13] 16 and Jesus when he was baptized went
[1:05:15] up straight way out of the water and lo
[1:05:17] the heavens were opened unto him and he
[1:05:19] saw the spirit of God descending like a
[1:05:21] dove and lighting upon him and lo a
[1:05:24] voice from Heaven saying this is my
[1:05:25] beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:05:28] pleased or as brother brandham explained
[1:05:32] to us in whom I am pleased to
[1:05:35] dwell Matthew chapter
[1:05:39] 17 and verse
[1:05:42] one and after six days Jesus taketh
[1:05:45] Peter James and John his brother and
[1:05:47] bringeth them up into an high mountain
[1:05:49] apart and was transfigured before them
[1:05:52] and his face did shine as the sun and
[1:05:54] his reignment was white as the light and
[1:05:57] behold there appeared unto them Moses
[1:05:59] and Elias talking with them then
[1:06:01] answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord
[1:06:03] it is good for us to be here if thou
[1:06:06] Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles
[1:06:08] one for thee and one for Moses and one
[1:06:10] for Elias while he yet spake Behold a
[1:06:13] bright Cloud overshadowed them and
[1:06:15] behold a voice out of the cloud which
[1:06:18] said this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[1:06:20] well pleased hear ye him
[1:06:26] the same word is used again over in Luke
[1:06:28] Luke chap
[1:06:32] 12 Luke 12 and starting at verse
[1:06:38] 32 fear not little flock for it is your
[1:06:41] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:06:44] kingdom sell that ye have and give alms
[1:06:48] provide yourselves bags which wax not
[1:06:50] old a treasure in the heavens that fath
[1:06:53] not where no Thief approacheth neither
[1:06:55] moth corrup for where your treasure is
[1:06:58] there will your heart be also let your
[1:07:00] loins be girded about and your lights
[1:07:02] burning and ye yourselves like unto men
[1:07:05] that wait for their lord when he will
[1:07:07] return from the wedding that when he
[1:07:09] cometh and knocketh they may open unto
[1:07:10] him immediately blessed are those
[1:07:13] servants whom when the Lord when he
[1:07:14] cometh shall find watching verily I say
[1:07:17] unto you that he shall guard himself and
[1:07:19] make them to sit down to meet and will
[1:07:22] come forth and serve them and if he
[1:07:24] shall come in the second watch or come
[1:07:26] in the Third Watch and find them so
[1:07:27] blessed are those servants and this know
[1:07:30] that if the good men of the house had
[1:07:32] known what hour the thief would come he
[1:07:34] would have watched and not have suffered
[1:07:36] his house to be broken through be
[1:07:39] therefore ready also for the son of man
[1:07:41] cometh and an hour when you think
[1:07:45] not so it's the father's good pleasure
[1:07:49] to give you the kingdom and then as he
[1:07:51] goes on Jesus talks about the faithful
[1:07:53] servant that is there watching that is
[1:07:55] what there ready that is there prepared
[1:07:58] that is willing to be working even in
[1:08:02] the late hours even if the master Waits
[1:08:05] until the second or the third hour of
[1:08:08] the day as it gets later and later the
[1:08:11] servant still awake still watchful still
[1:08:14] ready to S serve still ready to do the
[1:08:16] work that he's been called
[1:08:22] to and in Hebrews chapter 10
[1:08:26] and verse
[1:08:28] 38 it says now the just shall live by
[1:08:31] faith but if any man draw back my soul
[1:08:35] shall have no pleasure in
[1:08:40] him you know as God is telling us the
[1:08:44] things that he looks for that will give
[1:08:47] him pleasure he also points out multiple
[1:08:49] times the things that won't
[1:08:53] Disobedience and in this he goes someone
[1:08:55] that will turn away or turn back from
[1:08:58] what they were supposed to
[1:09:00] do you know those servants that decided
[1:09:03] to be lazy and go to sleep instead of
[1:09:06] watching for their Master to come back
[1:09:08] or those that saw the truth and then
[1:09:11] decided no my own desires are more
[1:09:14] important let me go this way instead of
[1:09:17] sticking with what I've been told
[1:09:18] instead of
[1:09:20] following the path that I've been shown
[1:09:25] God's telling us
[1:09:28] that these are the things to do that
[1:09:31] would not please him and then here's the
[1:09:33] things to do that will please him and he
[1:09:36] lays it out in front of us and basically
[1:09:39] he's asking the
[1:09:40] question do you love
[1:09:44] me do you
[1:09:46] actually truly love me or are you simply
[1:09:52] claiming it are you going hey I'm I've
[1:09:55] got the name badge
[1:09:56] Christian I go to
[1:09:58] church I have a Bible in my house I do
[1:10:03] this I do
[1:10:05] that I've got I've got the Bible
[1:10:07] downloaded on my phone even I've got it
[1:10:09] at all times it's right there with
[1:10:11] me I've got the message books in my
[1:10:14] house I've got the tapes in my house
[1:10:16] I've got these take your pick of what it
[1:10:18] is that would give you the name badge of
[1:10:22] Christian but are we actually going
[1:10:24] through in focusing on what actually
[1:10:26] Delights our Lord are we focusing on
[1:10:28] what is actually going to give him
[1:10:31] pleasure what is
[1:10:33] actually going to make him
[1:10:40] happy Hebrews chapter
[1:10:45] 11 and verse
[1:10:49] 5 by faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:10:53] should not see death and was not found
[1:10:55] because God had translated him for
[1:10:57] before his translation he had this
[1:10:59] testimony that he pleased God but
[1:11:03] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:11:05] him for he that cometh to God must
[1:11:07] believe that he is and that he is a
[1:11:09] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:11:15] Him the Greek word that's used here is
[1:11:17] the word your esto which means to be
[1:11:21] well pleasing or to be well pleased with
[1:11:24] a thing
[1:11:27] brother Brandon in the sermon only
[1:11:29] believe he says and you notice when
[1:11:32] Jesus was crossing the sea the devil
[1:11:33] knowed that he was on the road to a
[1:11:36] great win a great victory for God and he
[1:11:38] tried to drown him that night because a
[1:11:40] sto caused a storm to come up but Jesus
[1:11:43] know that God had sent him because he
[1:11:45] did only what God led him to do wouldn't
[1:11:48] it be nice if we had a testimony like
[1:11:50] that Brethren I do only that which
[1:11:52] pleases God wouldn't that be wonderful
[1:11:55] like like Enoch walked with God 500
[1:11:58] years and had a testimony that he
[1:11:59] pleased God he didn't have to die just
[1:12:02] went up so then a little afternoon
[1:12:04] stroll he just started walking out and
[1:12:06] just thought well I've been on the earth
[1:12:07] long enough I'll just walk on up and
[1:12:10] just started by faith he thought well
[1:12:11] I've been here long enough so I'm kind
[1:12:13] of tired of being around here I think
[1:12:15] I'll just stroll on up till I hit the
[1:12:16] Milky Way and just walk on up knock on
[1:12:19] the door so that's what he did see by
[1:12:21] faith he did it the Bible said so so we
[1:12:24] just got tired staring he said well I'm
[1:12:25] just going to walk up home God just went
[1:12:28] on up through the air walking he did
[1:12:30] that by faith the Bible said he did and
[1:12:32] so oh I when I feel death come knocking
[1:12:35] around my door I want to have that kind
[1:12:36] of Faith don't you just say well so long
[1:12:39] old world I'm going to walk away from
[1:12:40] you now and just start walking on just
[1:12:42] walk right on up and past the moon and
[1:12:45] stars and strike the Milky Way and go on
[1:12:47] up into the Spheres and spheres and out
[1:12:49] of the Spheres and just go on into Glory
[1:12:51] that's right
[1:12:57] what pleases God
[1:12:59] obedience Justice Mercy
[1:13:02] humility
[1:13:03] faith for without faith it is impossible
[1:13:06] to please
[1:13:09] him John chapter
[1:13:12] 8 verse
[1:13:15] 28 then Jesus said unto them when you
[1:13:18] have lifted up the son of man then shall
[1:13:20] you know that I am he and that I do
[1:13:22] nothing of myself but as my father hath
[1:13:25] taught me I speak these things and he
[1:13:27] that sent me is with me the father hath
[1:13:30] not left me alone for I do always those
[1:13:33] things that please
[1:13:36] him in the sermon hear ye hymn brother
[1:13:39] brandom says and now we find that our
[1:13:41] Lord never did anything just at random
[1:13:44] every move he made was ordained of the
[1:13:47] father we just go at random but he said
[1:13:49] I always do those things which pleases
[1:13:51] the father so every move that he made
[1:13:54] had a meaning and it was to please God
[1:13:58] oh I would say here would it not be
[1:13:59] wonderful if we could have a testimony
[1:14:01] like that that we always do that which
[1:14:04] pleases
[1:14:12] God I
[1:14:18] was I was talking with
[1:14:20] my Sunday school class this morning and
[1:14:24] we've been going through
[1:14:27] through the Book of Ezekiel for a little
[1:14:32] bit and we know the
[1:14:36] scriptures but Ezekiel chapter
[1:14:42] 9 and verse four it says and the Lord
[1:14:45] said unto him go through the midst of
[1:14:47] the city through the midst of Jerusalem
[1:14:49] and set a mark upon the foreheads of the
[1:14:51] men that sigh and cry for all the
[1:14:53] Abominations that be done in the midst
[1:15:01] thereof God calls us and set up the
[1:15:04] example with Christ that Christ only did
[1:15:07] that which pleased his father he only
[1:15:10] did
[1:15:12] that he didn't do anything of his own
[1:15:14] will he didn't do anything of his own
[1:15:16] desires but he focused just on what
[1:15:18] would please the Lord and when we go
[1:15:21] back into Ezekiel we find that and
[1:15:24] brother Brandon
[1:15:25] preached on this and mentioned it
[1:15:27] multiple times throughout the message
[1:15:29] where the Mark was given to those that
[1:15:31] sighed and
[1:15:34] cried you know we live in a
[1:15:37] day in this age of leoda that's lukewarm
[1:15:41] and it's very easy for us to get
[1:15:45] comfortable it's very easy for us
[1:15:47] to be in an environment
[1:15:50] where this is just kind of the
[1:15:52] normal as we look around at us and you
[1:15:55] see the sin all around and you see these
[1:15:59] different things in the news reports or
[1:16:01] these different things going on in this
[1:16:03] city or these different things going on
[1:16:04] in this country or these things going on
[1:16:07] around the
[1:16:08] world and we read the
[1:16:11] report and we'll say oh isn't that a
[1:16:14] shame or isn't that
[1:16:16] terrible and then we'll put down the
[1:16:19] newspaper or close out the web article
[1:16:22] and go on about our lives and not think
[1:16:23] about it again
[1:16:27] and it's only when something happens
[1:16:31] that makes it hit
[1:16:34] close whether it's a family member that
[1:16:37] suddenly gets embroiled into something
[1:16:39] that they shouldn't or they chose to
[1:16:43] leave the message or leave Christianity
[1:16:46] and go into the world or whether it's a
[1:16:48] friend or whether it's a coworker or
[1:16:51] something like this until it hits close
[1:16:55] we don't find ourselves being driven to
[1:16:57] our knees we don't find ourselves being
[1:16:59] driven to a point that we're sighing and
[1:17:01] crying over
[1:17:03] it brother random said that that Mark
[1:17:06] was the holy spirit being placed on
[1:17:10] them but yet all too often it's so easy
[1:17:13] for
[1:17:14] us to get used to what's going on around
[1:17:18] us you know I
[1:17:21] remember oh this has probably been I
[1:17:25] would guess two or three years ago it
[1:17:26] could be longer now the way time goes
[1:17:28] but it was two or three years ago they
[1:17:30] started having
[1:17:36] uh trans story hours in the
[1:17:40] libraries you would have this
[1:17:42] crossdressing person that would come in
[1:17:44] and they would be the ones to read story
[1:17:46] time to the
[1:17:47] children and this was big news like I
[1:17:51] said in my head I think two to three
[1:17:52] years ago but it could have been longer
[1:17:53] by now I don't
[1:17:55] time passes so quickly anymore and it
[1:17:57] was such a big thing and there was so
[1:18:00] much push back all over the world about
[1:18:05] it but then slowly Things become more
[1:18:08] and more normal to
[1:18:10] where I was listening to news article
[1:18:13] where they were talking about that we
[1:18:15] just went through June which they call
[1:18:17] pride month and they were like this was
[1:18:19] one of the quietest Pride months that
[1:18:22] we've ever
[1:18:23] seen does that mean maybe we're starting
[1:18:26] to make some traction does that mean
[1:18:28] we're maybe starting to Twin things back
[1:18:30] a little
[1:18:32] bit and the commentator that was talking
[1:18:34] I thought had a really good observation
[1:18:36] he's
[1:18:37] like we think it's one of the quietest
[1:18:39] we've ever
[1:18:40] seen because it's gotten so loud all the
[1:18:45] time not necessarily that this
[1:18:48] particular month was quieter than the
[1:18:50] month before but we've gotten so loud
[1:18:52] every month that this one month no
[1:18:55] longer stands
[1:18:56] out and it's become so normal it's
[1:18:59] become part of the
[1:19:02] everyday take your pick about which type
[1:19:05] of immorality we're talking about and
[1:19:08] it's basically the standard I could go
[1:19:09] out and buy the newspaper from today the
[1:19:12] newspaper from a week ago and probably
[1:19:14] find almost every single thing in one of
[1:19:17] the Articles somewhere because it's just
[1:19:19] a daily occurrence now it's just
[1:19:23] standard it's just
[1:19:27] normal and we get
[1:19:30] so used to
[1:19:33] it that we begin to lose sight of the
[1:19:36] fact that we're supposed to be affected
[1:19:39] by
[1:19:40] it we begin to become numb to it because
[1:19:43] it's around us all the time to the point
[1:19:45] where you know brother brandham as he
[1:19:47] described Enoch walking off in the quote
[1:19:50] he said Enoch got tired of being there
[1:19:54] it was like you know what I just want to
[1:19:56] walk on to the
[1:19:58] Lord and when we're here at church we
[1:20:00] will say aren't we all ready to go home
[1:20:03] aren't we ready to
[1:20:06] leave but if I just show up at your door
[1:20:09] at your
[1:20:11] house am I going to find and this is as
[1:20:15] much to me as anyone if anyone shows up
[1:20:17] at my house are they going to find
[1:20:19] me in prayer they're going to find me in
[1:20:22] desperation going lord it's time to go
[1:20:23] home
[1:20:25] it's time to get out of here or are they
[1:20:27] going to find me
[1:20:30] comfortable are they going to find me
[1:20:33] content because I have a
[1:20:35] job I have a job that I
[1:20:38] enjoy I have a family I have a wife and
[1:20:41] children that I love I have a roof over
[1:20:44] my head I have comfortable Furniture
[1:20:47] maybe it's not the newest in the world
[1:20:48] but it's comfortable we're not sitting
[1:20:49] on the floor we're not sitting on things
[1:20:52] that are just rough wood we have
[1:20:54] cushions we have maybe we don't have the
[1:20:56] most comfortable mattress in the world
[1:20:58] but I have a mattress I'm not laying on
[1:21:01] the floor I'm not laying on straw not
[1:21:03] laying on whatever we have all these
[1:21:05] Comforts around
[1:21:07] us even in our day-to-day lives and are
[1:21:10] we feeling that push that it's time to
[1:21:14] go
[1:21:15] home that it's time to leave or are we
[1:21:17] comfortable where we're sitting are we
[1:21:20] comfortable with what we're doing
[1:21:25] brother random talked about how the
[1:21:28] world would try to creep into the church
[1:21:30] and the devil would try to creep in to
[1:21:33] bring little things here and there
[1:21:36] because it's so
[1:21:37] normal you know
[1:21:40] where it used to be
[1:21:43] that as soon as you walked out into the
[1:21:46] world if I saw a woman in a dress or a
[1:21:49] skirt you immediately
[1:21:51] knew they had to have some sort of
[1:21:53] standard
[1:21:56] but if you look in just the last year or
[1:21:58] two fashion have started to swing around
[1:22:00] to where some of these long flowy
[1:22:02] dresses are actually coming back in my
[1:22:05] wife can find more stores online that
[1:22:07] aren't being targeted to that they're
[1:22:10] just this is the standard fashion
[1:22:12] now it's starting to swing back and you
[1:22:15] start to get comfortable like oh we can
[1:22:17] find this easier it's not quite as hard
[1:22:21] doesn't mean it's easy but it's not
[1:22:24] quite as hard hard as it used to be to
[1:22:25] go find these clothes it's not quite as
[1:22:27] hard as it used to be to do this or do
[1:22:32] that and we become
[1:22:35] comfortable we become
[1:22:39] content when the Lord is telling
[1:22:42] us you're supposed to be driven towards
[1:22:44] this you're supposed to have this
[1:22:48] desire Jesus wasn't going out for his
[1:22:50] own Comfort brother brandom talked about
[1:22:52] the fact that Jesus
[1:22:55] had the right to have a family he had
[1:22:58] the right to have a home he had the
[1:23:00] right to do this and do that because he
[1:23:02] was a
[1:23:03] man but yet he was willing to give up
[1:23:05] all that he was willing to give up his
[1:23:07] own desires he was willing to give up
[1:23:09] his own
[1:23:11] wants and he would only do that which
[1:23:14] delighted his
[1:23:22] father we begin to lose sight of that
[1:23:25] because it's comfortable because it's
[1:23:29] normal the things I was and another one
[1:23:33] of the news things I happen to be
[1:23:35] following does anyone remember it was
[1:23:38] approximately 15 years ago now when the
[1:23:42] cake maker in
[1:23:44] Colorado was brought up on charges
[1:23:46] because he wouldn't make a cake for a
[1:23:50] homosexual wedding does everyone
[1:23:53] remember that okay it's 15 16 years ago
[1:23:57] it was big
[1:24:00] news the guy's name is Jack something I
[1:24:04] forget what his last name is but his
[1:24:05] name is
[1:24:08] Jack and then they went all the way to
[1:24:10] the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court
[1:24:12] finally ruled that no he could not be
[1:24:15] forced to use his creative abilities to
[1:24:19] make something for someone that went
[1:24:21] against his
[1:24:23] beliefs and that ruling was five six
[1:24:26] years ago something like that
[1:24:30] now he's still in
[1:24:33] court there are still court cases
[1:24:35] against
[1:24:37] him from more people that have brought
[1:24:40] charges against him because he wouldn't
[1:24:42] make a cake for a trans thing and he
[1:24:45] wouldn't make a cake for this or for
[1:24:48] that but yet those aren't big news
[1:24:51] anymore because we've kind of gotten
[1:24:53] used to it
[1:24:56] when that first came out it was huge how
[1:24:58] dare they persecute how dare they go
[1:25:00] against
[1:25:01] him but now it's become so
[1:25:06] normal that it's not big news anymore
[1:25:09] it's lost in the
[1:25:14] memory we live in a lukewarm world we
[1:25:16] live in a world where everything is just
[1:25:19] becoming
[1:25:22] normal I found it interesting my on July
[1:25:26] 4th as my we had watched the fireworks
[1:25:29] and my wife started talking to me about
[1:25:31] it and she
[1:25:33] said for the first time in a long time
[1:25:35] as she was watching the fireworks she
[1:25:37] thought about what the Cannons must have
[1:25:40] sounded like back during the
[1:25:42] Revolutionary War and how people would
[1:25:45] have been reacting and it made her think
[1:25:46] about the people over in Israel that
[1:25:49] have rocket attacks on a continual
[1:25:52] basis and where we look at fireworks and
[1:25:55] we celebrate the color and we kind of
[1:25:57] even enjoy the noise and all these kind
[1:25:59] of things like she asked the question
[1:26:01] like what do you think a child
[1:26:04] there how are they reacting when they
[1:26:07] hear this kind of sound off in the
[1:26:09] distance what are they thinking
[1:26:13] about and I'll be the first one to say
[1:26:15] that thought didn't even pop in my head
[1:26:17] until my wife said something about
[1:26:20] it and I'm one that tries to follow what
[1:26:24] news is going on with Israel and Hamas
[1:26:26] and Hezbollah and all this kind of
[1:26:29] stuff but yet at the same time it's so
[1:26:31] easy to look at as well that's happening
[1:26:34] on the other side of the
[1:26:35] world that's over
[1:26:39] there it's not really affecting me it's
[1:26:42] not affecting my little world of
[1:26:45] Stillwater Oklahoma and pony
[1:26:48] Oklahoma those are basically the two
[1:26:50] places I'm
[1:26:51] at it doesn't affect me here so I don't
[1:26:54] have to think about
[1:26:55] it the news of the baker in
[1:26:58] Colorado that just makes you go man that
[1:27:01] Colorado it's such a this kind of state
[1:27:03] or that kind of state I'm glad I'm in
[1:27:05] Oklahoma and then you move on about your
[1:27:07] day and don't think about
[1:27:09] it or when you hear about this person or
[1:27:12] that person or this going
[1:27:14] on in the Sports World or this going on
[1:27:17] in fashion or this going on in
[1:27:20] entertainment or this going on
[1:27:23] politically in this state or that state
[1:27:24] or in the
[1:27:27] nation we'll look at
[1:27:30] it and we'll think about it for a few
[1:27:33] minutes and then we'll go on about our
[1:27:41] day but is that what God's calling us to
[1:27:45] do if God's calling us to be at a point
[1:27:48] where we're supposed to
[1:27:51] be we're supposed to have this strong
[1:27:53] desire to get out of
[1:27:57] here we're supposed to have this desire
[1:28:00] to be out of this
[1:28:04] world then shouldn't it all be affecting
[1:28:07] us a little bit
[1:28:08] more shouldn't we be looking at these
[1:28:10] things and it making us sigh and cry it
[1:28:14] making us look at it and go Lord how
[1:28:17] long Lord how much longer we know we're
[1:28:20] not going to be sitting here praying and
[1:28:21] going Lord send the Revival that came
[1:28:23] and
[1:28:25] went we can be asking the Lord to send
[1:28:27] the Revival to
[1:28:29] us Lord let the Revival be in me but I
[1:28:33] know he's not going to come in and save
[1:28:35] the
[1:28:36] nation that's done that's
[1:28:40] gone but are we passionate am I
[1:28:43] passionate about going Lord I need more
[1:28:47] of you I need to get closer to you I
[1:28:49] need to be living in a way that pleases
[1:28:52] you I need to have that testimony the
[1:28:54] same one that Enoch had that God goes He
[1:28:59] looked down at Harry and was pleased he
[1:29:02] lived a life that pleased
[1:29:04] God I'm supposed to be living a life
[1:29:07] like Christ where I go I do
[1:29:09] nothing unless it pleases my father I do
[1:29:13] nothing unless it pleases my savior I do
[1:29:15] nothing unless it pleases my
[1:29:22] Lord but we get so w wed up in our
[1:29:25] normal day-to-day lives we get so
[1:29:26] wrapped up in our own wants and our own
[1:29:29] desires we get so wrapped up in going
[1:29:31] man my car is getting older they've got
[1:29:34] some really nice cars out there now I
[1:29:36] don't even get a brand new one get one
[1:29:38] two three years old look at all the
[1:29:41] bells and whistles that it has it's got
[1:29:44] this feature and that
[1:29:46] feature I
[1:29:48] remember the first time I got a vehicle
[1:29:50] I wasn't looking for it the first time I
[1:29:52] got a vehicle that had heated seats
[1:29:56] seats and in the winter flipping that on
[1:30:00] was pretty
[1:30:04] nice and now they've got seats in some
[1:30:06] of these cars that not only heat but
[1:30:08] they will
[1:30:09] cool I don't have that kind of car I'm
[1:30:11] not that fancy not
[1:30:15] yet but they have all these different
[1:30:17] bells and whistles all these things to
[1:30:20] make you
[1:30:20] comfortable you know you can go out and
[1:30:23] get the fancy beds that you can get them
[1:30:25] to move so they can have you propped up
[1:30:27] a little bit or have your feet propped
[1:30:29] up or do this do that and there's
[1:30:31] nothing wrong with having that kind of
[1:30:32] bed I don't know if someone here has
[1:30:33] that kind of bed there's nothing wrong
[1:30:35] with having that there's nothing wrong
[1:30:37] with having the seats that heat and
[1:30:40] cool but yet every single one of these
[1:30:43] things is something that is designed to
[1:30:45] make us
[1:30:47] comfortable every one of these things is
[1:30:50] something that is designed to make us
[1:30:55] satisfied that is designed to put us in
[1:30:57] a place where we're no longer
[1:31:00] looking to the other realm we're no
[1:31:03] longer
[1:31:04] looking to where we want to
[1:31:07] go but instead we're going I've got a
[1:31:11] pretty good life
[1:31:13] here you know I've
[1:31:15] got my kids that I'm
[1:31:19] raising my older ones are starting to
[1:31:21] turn out pretty
[1:31:22] good Lord willing they'll stay that way
[1:31:25] but you start to see some successes
[1:31:27] coming through you start to go okay Lord
[1:31:29] you're helping me get through to this
[1:31:31] point I know I'm in the early stage of
[1:31:33] it there are a lot here that you guys
[1:31:35] have had more success than I have you've
[1:31:38] gone further along that that path but
[1:31:41] you see these things and you kind of
[1:31:43] get that feeling of satisfaction we've
[1:31:46] we've done it we've gone this far we've
[1:31:47] been able to accomplish this we've been
[1:31:49] able to do this you know I've got that
[1:31:53] job where I can bring provide I'm able
[1:31:54] to take care of my family I've got that
[1:31:56] home I've got these different
[1:31:59] things and we
[1:32:01] become so content and we become So
[1:32:07] Satisfied and we begin to get L to sleep
[1:32:12] a little
[1:32:18] bit and so maybe that's all that this
[1:32:21] service is about this morning is
[1:32:25] wake us up just a little bit and remind
[1:32:26] us are we focusing on what pleases our
[1:32:30] Lord are we focusing
[1:32:32] on what he
[1:32:34] wants are we busy being wrapped up in
[1:32:37] our own desires and our own
[1:32:40] wants am I
[1:32:43] giving the Lord the time that I should
[1:32:45] am I giving him the attention that I
[1:32:47] should or am I too busy thinking
[1:32:50] about what I'm going to enjoy or what I
[1:32:55] want am I too busy thinking
[1:32:58] about the book I want to read or the
[1:33:01] show I want to watch or the new
[1:33:03] restaurant I want to try or the new
[1:33:06] vehicle I want or the new this or the
[1:33:08] new
[1:33:09] that am I too busy thinking about those
[1:33:14] things am I allowing myself to be
[1:33:17] affected by the world around me or if I
[1:33:19] become numb to it
[1:33:28] in John chapter 8 the vers we read when
[1:33:32] it says I do always those things that
[1:33:34] please
[1:33:37] him this one is using the word
[1:33:40] arrestos which means pleasing or
[1:33:45] agreeable 1 John chapter
[1:33:50] 3 1 John chapter 3 and verse 19
[1:34:00] and hereby we know that we are of the
[1:34:02] truth and shall assure our hearts before
[1:34:05] him for if our hearts condemn us God is
[1:34:08] greater than our heart and knoweth all
[1:34:10] things beloved if our heart condemn us
[1:34:13] not then we have confidence toward God
[1:34:15] and whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[1:34:18] because we keep his Commandments and do
[1:34:20] those things that are pleasing in his
[1:34:22] sight and and this is his Commandment
[1:34:24] that we should believe on the name of
[1:34:26] his son Jesus Christ and love one
[1:34:28] another as he gave his commandment and
[1:34:30] he that keepeth his Commandments
[1:34:32] dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby
[1:34:34] we know that he abideth in Us by the
[1:34:36] spirit which he hath given
[1:34:41] us John as he's writing here
[1:34:44] says we keep his Commandments and we do
[1:34:47] those things that are pleasing in his
[1:34:50] sight
[1:34:57] obedience we keep his
[1:34:59] Commandments Justice do justly Mercy
[1:35:02] love Mercy humility walk humbly Faith
[1:35:05] because without faith it is impossible
[1:35:07] to please
[1:35:09] him and the patriarch Abraham brother
[1:35:12] brandom says we realize that in this in
[1:35:15] doing this it pleased God so well to see
[1:35:17] that Abraham loved him above everything
[1:35:19] on Earth even his only son he loved him
[1:35:21] above what anybody could say what
[1:35:24] anybody could do he still loved God
[1:35:26] enough to believe his word all Abraham's
[1:35:28] seed believes God like that they are
[1:35:31] believing God and we know that it
[1:35:32] pleased God so well that here is what he
[1:35:35] said thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:35:37] its enemy thy seed shall possess the
[1:35:39] gates of its
[1:35:43] enemy in the sermon hear ye
[1:35:50] him brother brandom's getting ready to
[1:35:53] pray and he said says the center aisle
[1:35:55] to the left would you raise your hands
[1:35:56] now that you believe that you'd like to
[1:35:58] take Christ tonight and he be so real to
[1:36:01] you so real that God would say this is
[1:36:03] my son this is my daughter oh I'm so
[1:36:06] pleased in him the way they act and the
[1:36:08] way they do I'm pleased with it would
[1:36:11] you want that kind of an experience that
[1:36:13] the world would say there's really a
[1:36:15] Christian woman there's really a
[1:36:16] Christian
[1:36:20] man as the musicians come
[1:36:31] when we listen to brother Brandon preach
[1:36:34] those questions we can still take to
[1:36:35] heart
[1:36:40] ourselves do we want it to be so real
[1:36:42] that God would say this is my son this
[1:36:45] is my daughter oh I'm so pleased in them
[1:36:48] the way they act the way they do I'm
[1:36:51] pleased with it
[1:36:55] in the identified Masterpiece of God
[1:36:58] brother brandom says so ought every
[1:36:59] Christian today to have the same
[1:37:01] testimony if in this promised word of
[1:37:03] God if our lives don't qualify and meet
[1:37:06] exactly what the word said then we have
[1:37:08] no right to call ourselves Christians if
[1:37:09] we're not born
[1:37:10] again Jesus said in Mark 16 these signs
[1:37:13] shall follow them that believe say not
[1:37:16] they may they ought they probably will
[1:37:18] they shall do it that's the sculpture
[1:37:20] that made us that's the church that's
[1:37:21] HED out that's the body of Christ Christ
[1:37:24] now we find it reflected in him
[1:37:26] perfectly the sculptor now have the word
[1:37:28] reflected in the Masterpiece again
[1:37:30] called his son God Emanuel just think
[1:37:33] that a person so yielded unto God
[1:37:35] identified himself in there in that body
[1:37:37] and he became him and God became one I
[1:37:40] and my father are one my father dwelleth
[1:37:43] in me I do that always which pleaseth
[1:37:45] the
[1:37:46] father but what if the Christian today
[1:37:48] could have a testimony like that you
[1:37:51] would be a masterpiece right here in
[1:37:53] Yuma on the
[1:37:55] street let's change that for a minute
[1:37:57] you would be a p Masterpiece right here
[1:37:59] in paon right here in Still Water right
[1:38:02] here in Oklahoma right here in
[1:38:05] Missouri if you're a washwoman out there
[1:38:08] behind the wash tub you still be a
[1:38:09] masterpiece to God when you can say I do
[1:38:12] that always which pleases God and the
[1:38:14] whole world can see it the work of Jesus
[1:38:18] Christ reflecting in you
[1:38:24] in the Jehovah of Miracles brother
[1:38:25] random says give us more Marys around
[1:38:28] here that can take God at his word and
[1:38:29] praise him whether you feel anything or
[1:38:31] not take him at his word God's trying to
[1:38:33] find somebody who will take his word I
[1:38:36] don't care how you feel someone say well
[1:38:39] I don't feel any
[1:38:40] better I went to the meetings I was
[1:38:42] prayed for that don't have nothing to do
[1:38:44] with it God said so and that settles it
[1:38:46] amen somebody who will take his word
[1:38:49] that's what pleases him believe his word
[1:38:52] that's what pleases God that's the only
[1:38:54] way you will ever find fav favor with
[1:38:57] him is believe his
[1:39:04] word sister titha if you would just
[1:39:07] start playing only
[1:39:11] [Music]

[1:39:15] believe if you truly believe then you'll
[1:39:17] obey his
[1:39:19] word if you truly believe then you'll
[1:39:21] walk justly if you truly believe you'll
[1:39:23] love Mercy if you truly believe you'll
[1:39:25] walk humbly if you truly believe then
[1:39:29] you have that faith in your
[1:39:31] life in the unchangeable god brother
[1:39:34] random says we've got to receive it in
[1:39:36] the way that God said it God has pleased
[1:39:39] with it that's his way he's all wisdom
[1:39:41] he's all powerful he's omnipotent
[1:39:43] omnipresent oh he's God the I am not the
[1:39:46] I was or will be but I am forever the
[1:39:48] same he's God and he does things in
[1:39:51] mysterious ways
[1:39:53] ah but he does it for his own Glory he
[1:39:55] does it because that it's the best to do
[1:39:58] it that way we must receive it the way
[1:40:00] he sends
[1:40:01] [Music]
[1:40:13] it if we believe God if we truly love
[1:40:19] him then our goal is to Delight him our
[1:40:22] goal is to Delight him the same way that
[1:40:24] it should be our goal is to Delight our
[1:40:27] spouse and take care of them and meet
[1:40:29] their
[1:40:32] needs as Jesus said that he only did
[1:40:36] that that would please the
[1:40:40] father so we're called to do only that
[1:40:43] which would please our Lord that
[1:40:46] would you can go through the scriptures
[1:40:49] and you can make a much longer list than
[1:40:51] what I went through
[1:40:54] in what would please the
[1:40:59] Lord are we living the way that we
[1:41:02] should or are we being rocked to sleep
[1:41:05] by the world are we
[1:41:08] actually
[1:41:10] affected by what we see around us are we
[1:41:13] affected by the sin around us are we
[1:41:16] affected as we see the world falling
[1:41:19] apart does it make us go into
[1:41:23] prayer does it make us go
[1:41:25] into desperation with our
[1:41:28] [Music]
[1:41:29] Lord or are we lull to where we go well
[1:41:33] that's out there I've got our little
[1:41:36] bubble we've
[1:41:38] got my home we' got the church in Pon
[1:41:43] I've got you know our church family
[1:41:45] we're good we're
[1:41:48] fine but the same thing that creeps into
[1:41:52] the world out there will will start to
[1:41:53] creep in
[1:41:55] here if we're not in desperation if
[1:41:58] we're not asking for that renewing if
[1:42:01] we're not asking for that refilling day
[1:42:03] after day the same thing that's out
[1:42:05] there will start to creep in
[1:42:07] here the things that are in fashion or
[1:42:10] things that are in entertainment or
[1:42:11] things that are whatever will start to
[1:42:13] creep
[1:42:15] in things that maybe we wouldn't have
[1:42:18] allowed 5 years ago 10 years ago 20
[1:42:21] years ago we now go oh that's okay oh
[1:42:25] that's not too bad oh that's
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:29] fine and please don't any of you be
[1:42:31] sitting there thinking that I'm standing
[1:42:33] up here going I'm holier than
[1:42:36] thou I'll be the first one to
[1:42:39] go I need to do another
[1:42:42] checkup I need to go through and go is
[1:42:44] there anything that I've let
[1:42:47] in that needs to be pushed back out is
[1:42:49] there anything that's come into my life
[1:42:52] is there anything that come in that's
[1:42:53] made me more laxed that's made me more
[1:42:57] accepted of everything going
[1:43:02] [Music]
[1:43:06] around brother brandom talked about and
[1:43:10] preached about how we have to be in
[1:43:12] desperation but all too often we let
[1:43:16] that desperation slip to the side
[1:43:18] because we are content we are
[1:43:21] comfortable and that desperation only
[1:43:24] comes when God sends the trials to us
[1:43:27] when God sends the problem when God
[1:43:29] sends the sickness when God sends the
[1:43:31] Affliction when God sends whatever then
[1:43:33] suddenly we're driven to that
[1:43:41] desperation but God's calling us to be
[1:43:44] there without it he'll send that if
[1:43:46] that's what it takes cuz he's going to
[1:43:49] get the bride where she needs to be and
[1:43:52] if that takes sending trial after trial
[1:43:55] and affliction after Affliction to get
[1:43:57] us down on our knees and get us in
[1:43:59] desperation that's what he's going to
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:03] do but yet he put it in the scriptures
[1:44:06] that we could be doing that all on our
[1:44:08] own we could have that desire we could
[1:44:10] have that goal Lord I just want more of
[1:44:13] you Lord I just want you working in my
[1:44:15] life Lord I just want to be pleasing to

[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:07] comfortable and there's a difference
[1:45:09] between being comfortable and content
[1:45:12] God calls us to be content in all things
[1:45:14] God calls us to be content in the trial
[1:45:16] and content with what he's provided for
[1:45:19] [Music]
[1:45:21] us but he didn't call us to be
[1:45:23] comfortable in this world he didn't call
[1:45:26] us to be happy with where we're
[1:45:29] at we're ambassadors we're supposed to
[1:45:32] be looking to go back to our country
[1:45:34] back to our

[1:45:43] home Lord Jesus we come into your
[1:45:45] presence this morning once more Lord
[1:45:50] and Lord this was just a simple thought
[1:45:53] that's been on My Heart Lord

[1:45:57] Jesus Lord as we've heard
[1:45:59] our pastor preaching about the gifts
[1:46:02] Lord

[1:46:06] the church age book and going through
[1:46:08] these different Spirits Lord
[1:46:10] [Music]
[1:46:14] that and Lord it's so easy as we're in
[1:46:17] this leoan age this this age of
[1:46:21] lukewarmness it's so easy
[1:46:24] Lord for us to slip into being
[1:46:28] comfortable it's so easy for us to slip
[1:46:30] into to focusing on our own desires
[1:46:34] focusing on our own wants focusing on
[1:46:36] our own
[1:46:37] [Music]
[1:46:40] Pleasures but Lord you you set the
[1:46:42] example in Christ Lord you said in your
[1:46:46] scriptures Lord
[1:46:48] that Lord we're supposed to be dying to
[1:46:51] our own wants we're supposed to be dying
[1:46:53] to our own desires and you call us Lord
[1:46:56] to live a life that would please you
[1:47:00] [Music]

[1:47:04] each one of us to examine ourselves Lord
[1:47:08] help each one of us to examine Our Lives
[1:47:11] Lord
[1:47:12] Jesus Lord if there's anything that that
[1:47:15] shouldn't be there Lord that we've let
[1:47:17] slip in help us to to push it back out
[1:47:20] Lord
[1:47:23] Lord if
[1:47:24] there's anything where we've allowed
[1:47:26] ourselves just to be laxed we've allowed
[1:47:28] ourselves to be focused on other things
[1:47:31] Lord then Lord may we enter into a new
[1:47:35] dedication to you Lord
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:39] Jesus Lord Brother Wendell talked about
[1:47:42] that those nine spiritual gifts are
[1:47:45] supposed to be evident in every Church
[1:47:47] body Lord and
[1:47:51] that it's Fallen away because we don't
[1:47:54] really desire
[1:47:56] it we don't really have that desperation
[1:47:59] for
[1:47:59] [Music]
[1:48:01] it Lord we don't have that desperation
[1:48:03] to be sighing and crying for the sins
[1:48:05] that are all around us the sins in the
[1:48:07] city the sins in the
[1:48:10] nation and Lord we know that the
[1:48:13] nation's gone we know that it won't get
[1:48:16] Revival but that shouldn't make it to
[1:48:18] where
[1:48:20] we where we're able to just ignore
[1:48:23] what's going on around
[1:48:24] us Lord we should still
[1:48:27] be in desperation for you Lord we should
[1:48:30] still be in desperation and we may not
[1:48:33] be in the desperation for you to send
[1:48:35] the Revival to the nation but now we're
[1:48:36] in the desperation for you to take us
[1:48:39] home now we're in the desperation for us
[1:48:41] to get everything right so that you can
[1:48:43] catch us away
[1:48:45] Lord now we're in the desperation for
[1:48:48] you to be able to use us like we've
[1:48:49] never allowed you to use us before Lord
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:57] Lord may you examine every heart here
[1:48:58] Lord may you help us each to examine our
[1:49:01] lives and our hearts Lord
[1:49:04] Jesus Lord forgive me where I failed
[1:49:07] forgive me where I've been too lacked
[1:49:09] forgive me where I've been too focused
[1:49:11] on my own desires and my own wants Lord
[1:49:15] Lord but Lord help help us all help me
[1:49:19] Lord to surrender more to you Lord and
[1:49:23] Lord to be able to have that testimony
[1:49:25] that we only do what pleases
[1:49:27] [Music]
[1:49:33] you Lord may
[1:49:35] you just continue to minister to the
[1:49:37] hearts here Lord
[1:49:39] Jesus Lord may you go beyond any words
[1:49:42] that I could speak anything that I could
[1:49:45] say because Lord ultimately you're the
[1:49:47] one who
[1:49:48] provides conviction Lord you're the one
[1:49:51] who provides encouragement you're the
[1:49:52] one who provides peace you're the one
[1:49:55] who provides everything that we would
[1:49:56] have need
[1:49:57] of and so Lord we lay it all at your
[1:50:00] feet Lord

[1:53:20] Jesus is here
[1:53:24] [Music]
[1:53:26] you know when we
[1:53:27] have so many new songs that we've
[1:53:30] learned and so many
[1:53:33] new worship songs
[1:53:36] and they're good we enjoy
[1:53:41] them but sometimes going back to the old
[1:53:44] ones I
[1:53:45] [Music]
[1:53:47] mean I don't think there's anything that
[1:53:49] quite Compares with only believe when
[1:53:51] you sing it and you start to think about
[1:53:53] all the times that you heard brother
[1:53:55] brandom singing as you listen to the
[1:53:57] messages
[1:53:58] and all the times that you would hear
[1:54:01] that sung before the prayer line or
[1:54:04] before he was getting ready to minister
[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:10] and just
[1:54:12] [Music]
[1:54:13] to be able to sing it
[1:54:16] and brother Brandon would have the
[1:54:19] congregation singing it and
[1:54:23] as they're singing he's waiting for
[1:54:24] their faith to get up to the point where
[1:54:26] it should be and they're just singing
[1:54:28] over and over only believe only believe
[1:54:30] and sometimes they would go for a while
[1:54:32] it wasn't it wasn't always just one time
[1:54:34] through or two times through he would
[1:54:36] let it go for a while and just
[1:54:39] continuing to sing it continuing to say
[1:54:41] it over and over lord I believe Lord I
[1:54:43] believe Lord only believe Lord I believe
[1:54:47] until
[1:54:48] finally brother brandom could tell the
[1:54:50] faith had reached the point where it
[1:54:51] needed to
[1:54:54] be and then he would enter
[1:54:57] in to the prayer line or into the
[1:54:59] discernment or into whatever it
[1:55:01] was and we love the new worship songs
[1:55:04] there are definitely those with a gift
[1:55:06] of worship that are in this day that are
[1:55:10] that there are some great
[1:55:12] songs but sometimes just the simple
[1:55:16] ones can help increase our faith and
[1:55:18] help lift us up to where we should be
[1:55:24] well I hope that that was a blessing it
[1:55:27] wasn't anything deep
[1:55:30] or wasn't a shouting or anything like
[1:55:32] that or exciting but hopefully it was
[1:55:35] something to give you a little bit
[1:55:37] further along down the
[1:55:39] [Applause]
[1:55:41] road so I know brother Merl mentioned it
[1:55:44] earlier that sister Kathy's going to be
[1:55:47] leaving us and going up to
[1:55:50] Alaska sister Kathy it's been great
[1:55:53] having you as part of the the body here
[1:55:55] and we're definitely going to be sorry
[1:55:57] to see you go I know that you had to
[1:56:00] with work and everything you were only
[1:56:02] able to be here every other service or
[1:56:04] so but we loved having you we'll
[1:56:07] definitely be sad not to have you here

[1:56:15] times as we

[1:56:20] your spirit and what you bring and we're
[1:56:23] very glad to have you a part of us and
[1:56:25] you will be

[1:56:51] y'all will be praying for me I would
[1:56:52] appreciate it um brother Merl what
[1:56:56] should we be singing as we
[1:57:00] [Music]

[1:57:15] way to be
[1:57:18] lost in his presence
