[1:08:28] and it don't matter
[1:08:29] you take the courage away from somebody

[1:08:38] their heart is fearful because their
[1:08:42] heart man and it's creating the attitude
[1:08:45] of a man of Gloom but I say tonight

[1:08:59] Bible says put the strong man right
[1:09:00] there and the strong man will cast out
[1:09:02] any other day you know what that tells
[1:09:05] me

[1:09:11] trying to torment you I'm here to tell
[1:09:15] you well come on church amen I don't
[1:09:18] care what how strong the enemy is how
[1:09:20] strong the demons are how strong the
[1:09:22] sickness is how strong whatever it
[1:09:24] happens amen well praise the Lord but
[1:09:27] I'm going to tell you I'm going to do it
[1:09:28] anyways amen there's been times where
[1:09:30] I've been up here on this platform and
[1:09:31] my chest is so clogged up closed amen I
[1:09:34] can hardly breathe but I tell the devil
[1:09:37] I'm not going to ask for a substitute
[1:09:38] I'm going to stand up there I'm going to
[1:09:40] give it everything I've got well praise
[1:09:43] the Lord I say when the devil tries to
[1:09:46] come in one way amen I'm gonna stand

[1:09:52] formed against me that is going to
[1:09:54] prosper I shall overcome because greater
[1:09:58] is he that is in me than he that is in
[1:10:01] the world is there some Believers in the
[1:10:03] building that can take some courage
[1:10:05] tonight and say God renew my vision
[1:10:08] renew my purpose renew me for who you've
[1:10:11] called me to be I want to stand strong
[1:10:14] against the enemy
[1:10:21] well praise the Lord
[1:10:22] do you love him here tonight
[1:10:24] man courageous
[1:10:26] yes the commission
[1:10:29] and I want you to notice
[1:10:31] the commissions have always been given
[1:10:33] to the flawed human beings
[1:10:37] God called Flawless human beings
[1:10:39] well praise the Lord
[1:10:41] all the prophets were flawed
[1:10:43] and yet God put his Supernatural
[1:10:47] holy word in their hearts and upon their
[1:10:50] lips
[1:10:51] I praise the Lord
[1:10:53] it's flawed men
[1:10:55] that God's called to be the leaders of
[1:10:56] the family
[1:10:57] it's flawed women that God's called to
[1:11:00] be mothers they man to take care of the
[1:11:03] home it's flawed preachers that God has
[1:11:06] put over his put over his church it's
[1:11:10] flawed the only difference between you
[1:11:14] and somebody else is you're here with a
[1:11:17] purpose what made brother Branham so
[1:11:19] different than all of those other guys
[1:11:20] he was born with a purpose amen once
[1:11:23] calls you to stand when everyone else
[1:11:25] when many have fallen and failed you
[1:11:28] were here with a purpose and you will
[1:11:31] never uh under don't underestimate your
[1:11:34] purpose can you say man
[1:11:37] amen Hallelujah we press
[1:11:41] so submission submission
[1:11:44] now brother Harry preached on submission
[1:11:45] here a while back
[1:11:47] and submission sometimes can be a bad
[1:11:49] word
[1:11:50] who or no one wants but the blessings
[1:11:52] are with submission as brother Harry was
[1:11:54] telling us the blessings come with that
[1:11:57] follow submission
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:00] well hello now missions I'm missing
[1:12:02] submission then everyone gets real quiet
[1:12:04] on me amen
[1:12:06] amen but submission submission
[1:12:10] a human being submitting himself to the
[1:12:14] supernatural God will bring the
[1:12:16] supernatural invisible realm in a human
[1:12:19] being's reality
[1:12:22] oh Hallelujah
[1:12:24] Abraham had to believe God he had to
[1:12:28] follow God he had to obey God
[1:12:31] says I want you to leave your Kindred
[1:12:33] won't you leave all of them God appeared
[1:12:34] to him says leave them all but Abraham
[1:12:36] Didn't Do It All
[1:12:38] he done most of it but he kept his his
[1:12:41] uh his his nephew with him amen and his
[1:12:45] family and the Bible says that God would
[1:12:48] not appear unto Abraham God did not
[1:12:50] appear unto Abraham until he fully
[1:12:54] submitted
[1:12:57] but when he fully submitted
[1:13:01] then the supernatural God came back
[1:13:04] Hallelujah
[1:13:06] I got to sit in here today here here in
[1:13:09] the church and and uh brother Joe would
[1:13:11] put that that that light up behind that
[1:13:13] cross and and I I like that you know the
[1:13:15] lights are off and you're here and and
[1:13:17] and it just you you know it just it's so
[1:13:20] peaceful in here and I got to thinking
[1:13:22] amen oh there's too many times we go
[1:13:26] without prayer we it's because that we
[1:13:30] have turned the gospel into a human's
[1:13:33] religion until we don't really need
[1:13:36] prayer anymore we've already got
[1:13:38] everything down and and we don't really
[1:13:40] get into Earnest prayer unless there's
[1:13:42] something that's going wrong in our
[1:13:44] families or our lives and then when that
[1:13:46] happens then we get Earnest and we start
[1:13:48] calling out to God and and and I was as
[1:13:52] I was sitting there I said Lord why is
[1:13:53] this it seems like this is a routine it
[1:13:56] seems like amen
[1:13:59] it takes it it takes it it takes you to
[1:14:03] to to sort of pull yourself away and and
[1:14:07] uh because and and I really even felt it
[1:14:09] in my heart it's because we've learned
[1:14:12] how to be a Christian but Christianity
[1:14:16] is not in the learning Christianity is
[1:14:19] in the presence of God walking with you
[1:14:23] you dying to yourself so that he can
[1:14:28] raise you in his likeness
[1:14:31] oh come on church so where a person is
[1:14:34] Walking with God if he's courageous it
[1:14:37] takes courage to stand up and say this
[1:14:40] this is more than just a Sunday school
[1:14:42] lesson I need the supernatural this is
[1:14:45] more than just another church service I
[1:14:48] need the supernatural amen it's going to
[1:14:52] require somebody to get out of that
[1:14:54] comfort zone and say I need the
[1:14:56] supernatural no we got a Revival coming
[1:14:59] up amen it gave me another meeting it
[1:15:02] can be another protractive meeting but
[1:15:04] oh what would it be if there were some
[1:15:06] folks that was courageous enough to
[1:15:08] stand before God and say Lord I want to
[1:15:10] start fasting and praying and the
[1:15:14] psalmist says I fasted and prayer
[1:15:16] returned into my Buddhism I
[1:15:20] other group of preachers I want just
[1:15:22] another I don't want these things I
[1:15:25] to see God
[1:15:28] somebody that is courageous enough who
[1:15:30] praise the Lord amen now you're in your
[1:15:33] mindset amen and I I have found in my
[1:15:36] sickness some of the things that I've
[1:15:38] gone through I I can tell you right now
[1:15:40] amen if I get all gloomy in my mind and
[1:15:43] I allow that gloominess to get there
[1:15:45] before you know it I'm feeling bad all
[1:15:47] the time I'm feeling bad it's just
[1:15:49] everything I do like it's just like I oh
[1:15:52] I just amen but when I start turning my
[1:15:54] vision back around and say that's not
[1:15:56] for me that's not who I am and I begin
[1:16:00] to look and I say I'm going to get up
[1:16:02] I'm going to get out I'm going to do
[1:16:04] something I'm going to press on Amen
[1:16:07] what do I find that that that that that
[1:16:10] something that predestinated something
[1:16:13] that's on the inside of me
[1:16:15] what's up and I begin to see things a
[1:16:18] little bit differently
[1:16:20] and I begin to take control of that
[1:16:24] situation when Satan's trying to come
[1:16:26] well can you say man Abraham had to say
[1:16:29] he had to confess that he was a father
[1:16:33] of many nations even though his body was
[1:16:38] saying he was lying
[1:16:41] Hallelujah even though he looked at
[1:16:44] Sarah amen and she was on you know she
[1:16:46] she had already lost her her good teeth
[1:16:49] and maybe her false teeth amen and there
[1:16:52] she was with a cane she had already it
[1:16:54] was it was but yet he had to stand right
[1:16:57] there and say I believe God
[1:17:02] oh y'all ain't listening to me here
[1:17:04] tonight you guys just want to come in
[1:17:06] and put our little time clock into the
[1:17:08] into the church service you guys just
[1:17:10] want to come in amen and make your
[1:17:12] little conscience feel good but I am
[1:17:14] here to say it you've got a bigger
[1:17:16] purpose than that here tonight you
[1:17:19] you take a purpose here tonight you can
[1:17:22] raise up you can pull that sword and you
[1:17:25] can get your healing
[1:17:26] can get your Miracle you can get a
[1:17:29] Revival you can be filled with the Holy
[1:17:31] Ghost you can have those things in your
[1:17:34] life
[1:17:37] can you say Amen
[1:17:39] yes
[1:17:40] amen now
[1:17:43] the ability to see the problems
[1:17:48] is not one of the nine spiritual gifts
[1:17:53] the ability
[1:17:55] to see that what the devil is doing in
[1:17:57] the church what the devil's doing in
[1:17:58] your family or what the devil's doing to
[1:18:00] you or what the devil's doing can you
[1:18:02] say man that doesn't really take too
[1:18:04] much spiritual discernment Hallelujah
[1:18:10] but it does take the Holy Ghost
[1:18:13] to stand up against the odds
[1:18:18] and say when I received the Holy Ghost I
[1:18:21] receive the power from God on high
[1:18:26] come on
[1:18:27] but my mind who cares about your mind
[1:18:29] stand up in faith in the gift that God's
[1:18:32] placed in your life
[1:18:34] yeah praise the Lord
[1:18:36] some of us have got that Holy Ghost so
[1:18:38] dumbed down amen till although we say we
[1:18:42] say the Holy Ghost still speaks in
[1:18:43] tongues and the Holy Ghost still does
[1:18:44] Miracles and the Holy Ghost amen but we
[1:18:47] no more believe that than anything in
[1:18:48] the world if we were what the scripture
[1:18:51] says or the Apostle Paul told the
[1:18:53] Corinthian Church there in the 14th
[1:18:55] chapter he says covet the gifts amen he
[1:18:59] says but but more importantly covet to
[1:19:01] prophesy now this that that that that
[1:19:04] part of the Bible was never taken out
[1:19:06] amen God still does those things but we
[1:19:10] don't see those things because there's
[1:19:12] no one courageous enough to stand up and
[1:19:15] say the god of today is the god of the
[1:19:19] book of Acts if he'd done it then he'll
[1:19:23] do it now
[1:19:26] Hallelujah I I I you know people say
[1:19:29] well brother Branham took him out of the
[1:19:30] church he did not
[1:19:32] know set the gifts in order
[1:19:34] you took him out of the church
[1:19:37] the prophet set him in order and all the
[1:19:40] way up into 1965 brother Brandon was
[1:19:42] saying that the nine spiritual gifts
[1:19:44] should be in every local church
[1:19:48] the devil don't want those spiritual
[1:19:49] gifts in the church because brother
[1:19:50] Bradham says when you get those
[1:19:52] spiritual gifts to operating correctly
[1:19:54] sin can't stay in the church
[1:20:00] the devil wants Sinners setting in the
[1:20:01] church
[1:20:05] the Devil Wants backsliders Something in
[1:20:07] the church the devil wants people
[1:20:09] without courage sitting in the church
[1:20:11] but God says I want you to take my word
[1:20:17] take courage stand upon my word believe
[1:20:21] for the supernatural where I'm at the
[1:20:25] Supernatural is pressed
[1:20:30] Hallelujah well praise the Lord I want
[1:20:33] our young people to hear somebody speak
[1:20:36] in tongues I want our young people they
[1:20:38] meant to be so full with the Holy Ghost
[1:20:40] that God will give them visions and
[1:20:42] dreams that God will but it's going to
[1:20:45] take courage it's going to take somebody
[1:20:46] to stand up and say the god of yesterday
[1:20:49] is the god today Amen brother Bradham
[1:20:51] says all of the ages amen of
[1:20:54] approximated that church all of the ages
[1:20:57] have imitated their desire their goal
[1:21:00] their ambition
[1:21:02] was for that church
[1:21:04] to live in them
[1:21:07] can you say Amen
[1:21:10] Hallelujah
[1:21:11] so I'm not just wanting to find my
[1:21:14] problem
[1:21:16] amen the problem is is we need courage
[1:21:20] we need courage
[1:21:22] amen well praise the Lord
[1:21:24] ain't mine I want to stand up say Lord
[1:21:27] there's something wrong with me
[1:21:29] now I I believe that the spirit of
[1:21:31] discernment
[1:21:32] we'll let you know amen if there's if
[1:21:35] the spirit of discernment will will
[1:21:37] operate
[1:21:40] it it'll tell you that the certain
[1:21:42] situation that is there it'll tell you
[1:21:44] the devil's behind that thing the

[1:25:33] some people say some people say well
[1:25:37] if my husband gave me something to
[1:25:38] respect I'd give him that honor
[1:25:45] I would say that if you went back and
[1:25:46] you looked in the Bible
[1:25:49] all of those Bible
[1:25:51] all those Bible believers
[1:25:54] you know we we might we might not be
[1:25:57] able to uh
[1:25:59] let me let me tell you could could you
[1:26:01] imagine being Peter's wife
[1:26:05] Hallelujah
[1:26:08] Peter you know Paul Peter
[1:26:11] you know and and and I I you know we we
[1:26:15] talk about Peter uh he he was always the
[1:26:18] one that say that Jesus and Satan get
[1:26:20] there Peter was just always talking out
[1:26:23] of turn
[1:26:24] Peter was Peter was
[1:26:27] always
[1:26:28] missing the mark Jesus would be trying
[1:26:31] to give the spiritual Revelation and
[1:26:33] Peter's missing it he's just totally
[1:26:35] missing it
[1:26:36] he's telling them I'm not going to be
[1:26:38] here much time much much longer with you
[1:26:40] he's already told him the son of man's
[1:26:42] got to go to the grave and then and then
[1:26:45] Peter pulls out his sword and says we'll
[1:26:47] fight for you till till death well Peter
[1:26:50] you're missing the point here remember
[1:26:51] what I told you about Jonah and remember
[1:26:54] what I've told you about these kinds of
[1:26:56] things you know and and and but Peter
[1:27:00] just you know just couldn't quite just
[1:27:04] couldn't quite get it together amen
[1:27:08] but it was also Peter
[1:27:10] it was it was Peter that stood there
[1:27:12] when no one else was catching him when
[1:27:14] no one else was kept was was
[1:27:18] a light a light just beamed in his head
[1:27:22] in his heart
[1:27:24] when he's asking the disciples
[1:27:26] whom do men say that I am oh there's
[1:27:28] later than this or this and then Peter
[1:27:30] he's the one that stands up and says
[1:27:33] I Know Who You Are
[1:27:36] you're the Christ the son of the Living
[1:27:38] God
[1:27:39] the rest of the guys are going huh
[1:27:43] Peter
[1:27:45] and then Jesus turns around and says
[1:27:47] Flesh and Blood hasn't given this to you
[1:27:48] Peter
[1:27:50] then because of this I'm giving you uh
[1:27:52] it was revealed to you about my Father
[1:27:54] in heaven and because of this I'm giving
[1:27:56] you the keys
[1:27:59] keys
[1:28:01] who did he give the keys to the kingdom
[1:28:02] to
[1:28:04] the guy that a few days later was
[1:28:06] backsliding cussing and saying that he
[1:28:09] don't know who Jesus is
[1:28:16] but you see and could you imagine could
[1:28:19] you imagine Peter's wife having to go
[1:28:21] through all of that and having to
[1:28:23] Hallelujah but you see what God's seen
[1:28:26] in Peter maybe those around him didn't
[1:28:29] see him Peter but God gave the keys to
[1:28:32] the kingdom to O Brother Peter
[1:28:37] well praise the Lord
[1:28:40] can you say Amen amen so so we we when
[1:28:44] we look in the natural
[1:28:46] and we we we don't we don't see things
[1:28:49] the way God sees things
[1:28:51] and you then you fail to submit to the
[1:28:55] glory that is to follow
[1:28:58] that life of submission
[1:29:01] it takes courage in this age of
[1:29:04] rebellion
[1:29:06] stand up
[1:29:07] and say I am going to resist anything
[1:29:12] that will take me from humility and
[1:29:15] submission
[1:29:16] to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:18] can you say man
[1:29:20] amen that that's exactly right
[1:29:22] Hallelujah well you love him
[1:29:25] yes I love him with all of my heart amen
[1:29:28] so so when we look here
[1:29:31] and and then by the way and then when
[1:29:33] Peter had done all of that
[1:29:35] Peter in his heart loved the Lord
[1:29:38] Peter loved the Lord so much
[1:29:41] Peter
[1:29:43] Peter was so he was so condemned
[1:29:48] that when that when
[1:29:50] everyone separated Peter was he was when
[1:29:53] Jesus was raised from the dead
[1:29:56] Peter was found out there on his boat
[1:29:57] naked
[1:29:59] out there in the middle out there out
[1:30:02] there fishing
[1:30:04] and when Jesus tells the disciples when
[1:30:06] he tells us he says he tells the the
[1:30:09] ladies
[1:30:10] he says go tell my disciples
[1:30:13] and don't forget Peter
[1:30:16] that I'm alive
[1:30:21] don't tell my go tell my disciples and
[1:30:23] don't forget Peter
[1:30:25] let Peter know and
[1:30:27] he still has purpose
[1:30:32] [Applause]
[1:30:36] and Peter didn't quite get the news and
[1:30:38] and and and wasn't going to hear it and
[1:30:40] so Jesus went and looking for Peter
[1:30:45] and there he was he was he was ashamed
[1:30:47] and he was hiding and he was all of that
[1:30:49] he had lost his courage
[1:30:52] but then Jesus says
[1:30:54] Peter do you love me
[1:30:57] you know I love you Lord
[1:31:01] I said feed my sheep
[1:31:04] then he asked him again Peter
[1:31:09] do you love me
[1:31:12] you know I love you Lord you know
[1:31:16] oh it don't look like it it don't look
[1:31:18] like it but I do
[1:31:22] and feed my sheep
[1:31:26] and then he comes back around and he
[1:31:28] says Peter
[1:31:33] do you love me
[1:31:38] but this time it wasn't the filial love
[1:31:40] it was the agape love is I'm trying to
[1:31:43] get way down to your purpose Peter
[1:31:45] Peter you're you I I know all around you
[1:31:48] you look like a you look like a goofball
[1:31:49] to everybody
[1:31:51] and you are
[1:31:53] the Peter
[1:31:55] if I can get down to the reality here
[1:31:59] do you love me from way down deep inside
[1:32:03] I do Lord
[1:32:06] he says then won't you feed my sheep or
[1:32:09] my Lambs
[1:32:11] can you say man God was taking
[1:32:16] this goofball that maybe everyone else
[1:32:19] was saying
[1:32:23] and God gave the man courage
[1:32:28] who was the spokesman on the day of
[1:32:30] Pentecost
[1:32:32] it was the Gopher
[1:32:39] girlfriend brethren

[1:33:02] things should be why don't you stand up
[1:33:05] with courage tonight and say just be
[1:33:08] courageous enough to come and lay before

[1:37:42] if you're my wife
[1:37:43] toward my leadership how much more would
[1:37:47] he do it to my wife
[1:37:50] concerning herself
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:37:55] are y'all catching me in other words the
[1:37:58] same one that influences men
[1:38:01] and women here on the earth is the same
[1:38:04] one
[1:38:06] that influences our minds and our hearts
[1:38:09] that tells us you're not going to make
[1:38:11] the Rapture you're not bribe
[1:38:14] you send away your day of Grace you
[1:38:17] never were you'll never be
[1:38:20] it's the same spirit
[1:38:23] that would get on you concerning
[1:38:26] questioning the prophet's Authority
[1:38:29] is that same unbelieving spirit that
[1:38:33] gets you questioning your own salvation
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:40] in product is for you to stay out of his
[1:38:44] presence
[1:38:46] so he'll do whatever it takes
[1:38:50] to keep you out of his presence
[1:38:53] but I'm here to tell you someone's going
[1:38:55] to stand up with courage
[1:38:56] and say that ain't happening
[1:39:00] I ain't listening
[1:39:03] I ain't buying it
[1:39:05] praise the Lord
[1:39:06] amen some years back when that when that
[1:39:10] believed the sign you know before that
[1:39:12] believed the sign came in and different
[1:39:15] ones that left I want to tell you Satan
[1:39:17] fought my mind was fighting my mind so
[1:39:19] hard
[1:39:21] I said you know this ain't right you
[1:39:24] know that message ain't true you know
[1:39:25] that ain't and I mean he bombarded my
[1:39:28] mind and bombarded and bombarded well at
[1:39:31] the time I'm thinking dear God I must
[1:39:34] not be a believer do I even have the
[1:39:37] Holy Ghost now this is before this is
[1:39:39] before these people started going off
[1:39:41] this way in that way
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:46] and I'm sitting there in prayer
[1:39:48] and of course every time when it would
[1:39:50] come
[1:39:51] I'd take it right back to scripture if
[1:39:54] this isn't true then then tell me who it
[1:39:57] is
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:39:59] if the words of that Prophet isn't true
[1:40:02] then then why all of these scriptures
[1:40:06] and then hit then it would then it would
[1:40:08] leave for a little bit then it'd come
[1:40:09] right back
[1:40:11] be listening to a tape and then say well
[1:40:13] that's just his opinion
[1:40:15] that was stuff going on in my head
[1:40:19] and I'd say I'd come right back and I'd
[1:40:21] say
[1:40:22] no it wasn't his opinion he was God's
[1:40:26] voice for this generation
[1:40:29] he was my prophet
[1:40:34] now
[1:40:37] then I began to hear so I talked to some
[1:40:40] others I said man does the devil replied
[1:40:41] to you they said yes amen Saints fought
[1:40:43] me hard
[1:40:44] fought men fought and fought me hard you
[1:40:47] mean you've
[1:40:48] you've always been a great defender of
[1:40:50] the message
[1:40:52] you mean you because Satan fights you I
[1:40:54] said man it's been hitting my head like
[1:40:56] crazy
[1:41:00] before you know what this was going and
[1:41:03] that one's going and this one's going
[1:41:04] and that one's going
[1:41:07] and I'm thinking you sorry scoundrel
[1:41:12] these were demons that were trying to
[1:41:15] come in and someone had to take courage
[1:41:17] use that word
[1:41:20] it's not based on his personality and
[1:41:21] it's not based on my personality it's
[1:41:23] based on what God Said and I've got to
[1:41:25] take courage enough courage to say I
[1:41:28] believe God
[1:41:31] and you know what
[1:41:33] that happened for that that happened
[1:41:34] probably for two or three months
[1:41:37] and then one day
[1:41:40] it left
[1:41:43] and then
[1:41:46] that's when I found the quotes where
[1:41:49] brother branham's using that same thing
[1:41:50] where Satan's saying if you be if you be
[1:41:52] if you be he said that same spirit will
[1:41:55] come on you if it be if it be if it be
[1:42:00] but he said you got to take him right
