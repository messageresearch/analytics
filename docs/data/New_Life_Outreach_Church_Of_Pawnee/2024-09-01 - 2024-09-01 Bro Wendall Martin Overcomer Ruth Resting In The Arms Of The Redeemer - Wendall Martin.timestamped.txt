[27:32] been for a redeemer amen amen let's look
[27:35] here in Ruth 1 and one and it came to
[27:39] pass in the days when the judges ruled
[27:42] there was a famine in the land and a
[27:44] certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to
[27:47] sojourn in the country of Moab he and
[27:50] his wife and his two
[27:53] sons and the name of the man was immc
[27:57] and the name of his his wife Naomi and
[28:00] the name of his two sons melan and
[28:03] Chilean ephra ephrathites of Bethlehem
[28:07] Judah and they come into the country of
[28:09] Moab and continued there and ALC Naomi's
[28:13] husband died and she was left and her
[28:16] two sons and they took wives of the
[28:19] women of Moab and the name of one was
[28:22] orpa and the name of the other was Ruth
[28:25] and they dwell there about 10 years
[28:29] and Menan and Gillian died also both of
[28:32] them and the woman was left of her two
[28:35] sons and her husband then she arose with
[28:39] her daughters-in-law that she might
[28:41] return from the country of Moab for she
[28:44] had heard in the country of Moab how the
[28:47] Lord had visited his people in giving
[28:50] them bread why don't we go to the Lord

[29:52] glory and honor in the name of the Lord
[29:54] Jesus Christ can the church say amen
[29:57] amen and amen God bless you you can be
[30:01] seated now uh I want to go ahead and
[30:03] continue reading on down we just um we
[30:07] we're at the seventh verse now it says
[30:10] wherefore she went forth out of the
[30:12] place where she was and her two
[30:14] daughters-in-law with her and they
[30:17] went uh on the way to return unto the
[30:20] land of Judah and Nomi said unto her two
[30:23] daughters-in-law go return each to her
[30:26] mother's house
[30:28] the Lord deal kindly with you and ye
[30:31] have dealt as you have dealt with the
[30:33] dead and with me the Lord grant you that
[30:36] you may find rest each of you in the
[30:38] house of her husband then they then she
[30:42] kissed them and they lifted up their
[30:44] voice and wept and they said unto her
[30:47] surely we will return with thee unto thy
[30:51] people and Naomi said turn again my
[30:54] daughters why will you go with me are
[30:57] there yet any more sons in my womb that
[31:00] ye may be uh that may be your husbands
[31:03] turn again my daughters go your way for
[31:06] I'm too old to have an husband and if I
[31:10] should say I have hope if I should have
[31:13] a husband also tonight and should also
[31:15] bear Sons would you tar for them till
[31:19] they were grown would you stay for them
[31:22] from having husbands nay my daughters
[31:25] for it grieveth me much for your sakes
[31:27] that my my that the hand of the Lord is
[31:29] gone out against me and they lifted up
[31:32] their voice and wept and
[31:34] orpa kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth
[31:38] caved unto her and she said behold thy
[31:42] sister-in-law was gone back under her
[31:44] people and under her Gods return Thou
[31:47] after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said
[31:49] inre entreat me not to leave thee or to
[31:53] return from following after thee for
[31:55] wheither thou goest I will go whether
[31:58] thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people
[32:01] shall be my people thy God my God where
[32:04] thou dest will I die there will I be
[32:08] buried and the Lord do so to me and more
[32:11] also if ought but death part thee from
[32:14] me and when she saw that she was
[32:17] steadfastly minded to go with her then
[32:20] she left speaking unto her and so they
[32:23] two went until they come to Bethlehem
[32:27] amen so
[32:28] this is a um a a wonderful
[32:32] story and um man this is a um this is a
[32:38] a story of redemption and I'm wanting to
[32:40] continue on on rest a little bit here
[32:43] tonight if I if if I may um and and but
[32:48] yet this is a story it's um it's it's a
[32:51] love story that was it's pretty
[32:52] incredible that it was included in the
[32:55] scripture and the prophet would tell us
[32:57] us that amen that it had so much uh uh
[33:01] hidden meaning and prophetic meaning uh
[33:04] to the to the church and to the bride
[33:07] and so amen there would be uh this this
[33:12] book of Ruth has four chapters and and
[33:16] it deals amen uh uh with again a
[33:19] prophecy of redemption it compasses a
[33:22] vast array of material it it it includes
[33:25] the Jews and the Gentiles it includes
[33:29] amen the fall and the Redemption of the
[33:31] Jews it talks about the Gentile bride
[33:35] being called and so then there's also
[33:38] the three women there's Naomi the Jewish
[33:41] people there's Opa orpa the the the you
[33:45] know the church member goes so far then
[33:47] turns back and then there is Ruth am man
[33:52] who who is the the Gentile bride that
[33:55] says thy God will be my God
[33:58] thy people will be my people and so you
[34:01] can you can see in in the world today
[34:05] you you can you can find where you are
[34:07] in this picture amen you can see where
[34:10] you are in this in in this uh story here
[34:14] but tonight I want to deal um uh uh with
[34:17] Ruth and and and maybe maybe we should
[34:21] you know uh uh uh just just sort of go
[34:24] back a little bit where it all started
[34:26] it all started with amen a covenant that
[34:29] God made with Abraham amen it was and
[34:32] and God says I'm going to give you this
[34:35] land I'm going to give this land to thy
[34:38] seed so it was a promise that he was
[34:40] going to have a seed and that they were
[34:41] to stay in that land now we all know
[34:45] that that uh uh it it was election from
[34:48] the very beginning because because
[34:50] Abraham was the first of the Jewish race
[34:54] Abraham was a gentile himself and so
[34:57] amen he he he he was no special breed he
[35:01] was no special race there was nothing
[35:03] special about him at all other than
[35:06] really he was a he was the least
[35:09] candidate he he was not one that that
[35:12] could even uh uh you know uh fill out a
[35:16] resume to God because he was never able
[35:19] to have a son he was never able to have
[35:22] a daughter he and Sarah had been married
[35:25] uh all of their lives practically since
[35:27] since kids and and had never been able
[35:29] to have children and yet God comes down
[35:32] appears to him and says I'm going to
[35:35] call you I'm going to give you sons and
[35:39] you're going to have a nation and the
[35:41] whole world is going to be blessed by by
[35:45] uh uh by by by your seed and uh uh you
[35:49] talking about far-fetched you talking
[35:51] about something that seems so uh
[35:53] illegitimate and so far out there Pie in
[35:56] the Sky am amen but you see there there
[35:59] was there was the only thing that was
[36:02] special about Abram is that God appeared
[36:06] to him and that made him special you
[36:09] know it was Grace I've always said it
[36:11] was Grace that made Abram a great nation
[36:15] amen and brother bradam would say this
[36:17] he says God doesn't call qualified men
[36:21] he call he qualifies the men that he
[36:25] calls so God does doesn't call qualified
[36:29] individuals that should make you feel
[36:31] really proud amen but he
[36:34] qualifies the
[36:36] individuals that he calls amen and so
[36:40] when God raised him up amen and he
[36:43] called him out and God ordained his seed
[36:46] and God established them in the midst of
[36:49] their enemies now amen then God said if
[36:52] you stay in this land I will bless you
[36:57] you get out of this land amen then
[37:00] you're outside of your blessings so with
[37:03] the story amen beginning to start here's
[37:06] IMC and and Naomi who came from this
[37:10] wealthy or this wealth of History amen
[37:14] they they they they can their their
[37:16] lineage goes all the way back to Abram
[37:19] amen and and the miraculous uh uh hand
[37:23] of God and they could trace their
[37:25] lineage back but but yet IMC and Naomi
[37:30] in the midst of a famine they left the
[37:34] promise that God ordain them to do now I
[37:37] think this is a good lesson for every
[37:38] one of us I'm not going to hold you long
[37:40] tonight so I'm going to try to speak
[37:42] amen I'm going to try to speak uh fast
[37:44] and you he fast okay amen so so here God
[37:49] told them to stay in the land but
[37:53] Abram that that God gave Abram and it
[37:55] was to his seed it was to his seed
[37:57] forever stay in that land blessings are
[38:01] in that land but Naomi and ALC left
[38:05] Bethlehem in the time of famine amen now
[38:09] they went down into the land of Moab
[38:12] Moab was a country that God did not like
[38:15] amen God had cursed the moabites and uh
[38:19] amen we're not going to go into that but
[38:22] be when they left the land of Israel
[38:25] then they find out that death is a death
[38:28] pursu amen we find that immc and maon
[38:32] and chilon they all died amen they they
[38:36] all died because they were outside of
[38:40] the will of God may this be a lesson for
[38:43] every one of you you husbands listen
[38:46] where you lead your family is
[38:50] important where you lead your family is
[38:52] important amen and you young men that
[38:55] are that are at that marriage age you
[38:58] all need to make sure that you have a a
[39:01] revelation that is that is that is uh
[39:04] rooted deep in the scripture you need a
[39:07] revelation that is deep in the scripture
[39:10] because you're going to be leading a
[39:12] family amen when you lead families you
[39:15] you it's either life or death amen your
[39:20] choice your choice in the in the hour of
[39:24] decision amen will influence the Next
[39:27] Generation to come and could influence
[39:30] generations to come that's right amen so
[39:33] we we we need to under understand this
[39:37] amen now we understand that God take God
[39:40] can take anything that that uh anything
[39:44] bad and turn it for our good amen and
[39:47] out of this here come amen a uh uh uh
[39:51] and the he Naomi who is who means a
[39:55] bitter and broken and she decides to go
[39:58] home and she tells her daughters-in-law
[40:01] amen that that that that they just need
[40:03] to stay behind and amen and and and and
[40:06] the scripture says there in that seventh
[40:08] verse now that both of those
[40:11] daughters-in-law both of them left the
[40:14] land of Moab to go with her amen but but
[40:19] only one went the wholeway and the other
[40:23] turned back amen now that's a that
[40:26] that's a that's that's a that that
[40:29] that's been All Through the Ages where
[40:30] you go so far amen and not going all the
[40:34] way into the promise that God has for
[40:37] each of those ages amen God's got a
[40:39] promise for each of these Seven Ages now
[40:42] Brethren ours is the rapture and we must
[40:46] not ever hold back from that there must
[40:50] be a desire to go all the way turn to
[40:54] your neighbor and say I'm going all the
[40:56] way
[40:58] I'm not going partway amen and turning
[41:00] around and so we we see where where amen
[41:05] she's saying my my my daughters I want
[41:07] you to you know turn back I there's no
[41:09] way I can give you children there's amen
[41:12] and wh ends up amen uh H turning aside
[41:16] and and and and and and but there was a
[41:19] decision that had to be made amen and
[41:22] and orpa was quick very quick to turn
[41:25] around and say I'm going back I love my
[41:27] mother-in-law been a wonderful family to
[41:29] be a part of Amen I'm glad to be
[41:31] associated with it but I I I I I've got
[41:33] to go back I can't go with you amen but
[41:36] but there was Ruth and Ruth in this
[41:39] decision amen she she knew that the
[41:42] decision was going to to mean the the
[41:45] the the harder road going to a land that
[41:49] that she didn't know a people that she
[41:51] didn't know going to a country that
[41:54] despised her race going to a were people
[41:58] amen that hated the moabites she knew
[42:02] the road that she was going to take was
[42:05] the despised road but yet she chose in
[42:09] her heart amen there's something in that
[42:12] heart that was predestinated before the
[42:14] foundation of the world Amen because she
[42:17] was a part of the lineage of Jesus
[42:19] Christ amen she was going to type out
[42:23] the very Redemption of the Gentiles Ruth
[42:27] God used gruth the moabitas to to type
[42:31] out the Bride of Jesus Christ oh that
[42:35] should make you want to shout amen so
[42:38] orpa kisses Grand or Mama and leaves but
[42:42] it was Ruth that said thy God will be my
[42:45] God can you say amen amen now now now it
[42:49] was because of that decision to follow
[42:52] amen that she says now don't don't don't
[42:54] beg me to return amen don't beg me to to
[42:56] go back back Ruth says where thou goest
[42:59] I will go thy God will be my God thy
[43:04] people will be my people where you Lodge
[43:07] is where I will Lodge amen and and she
[43:11] says where thou dest I will die too I am
[43:14] going with you you're not turning me
[43:17] aside amen what a choice for a moit huh
[43:21] what a choice amen for a for what a
[43:23] choice for for a woman to to to leave
[43:26] all of her family family and everything
[43:28] behind to follow after knowing nothing
[43:31] of the way and that she had to embrace
[43:34] she had to leave all of her old family
[43:36] to embrace her new and accept things
[43:39] that were foreign to her amen she left a
[43:42] Land of Plenty to follow this woman I
[43:46] think that's that that's pretty
[43:47] incredible every one of you children's
[43:49] got to make that decision too it's not
[43:51] easy listen it's not easy to make that
[43:54] decision to to Leave the World Behind to
[43:57] follow after Jesus
[43:59] Christ but the rewards come to the one
[44:02] that is willing to leave the one behind
[44:05] in order to walk the road by
[44:07] faith you know Ruth did not have she had
[44:11] no promise Ruth did not have a promise
[44:14] that Naomi even had a home to go to
[44:17] Naomi went back she lost her inheritance
[44:20] she lost it all amen and here she is
[44:24] she's she's she's going back because
[44:27] there is something about that seed that
[44:29] is calling her back home and there's
[44:32] something about Ruth that was willing to
[44:34] follow along too can you say amen amen
[44:37] now amen so so every one of us have got
[44:41] to make that cleancut decision now I I I
[44:44] wrote down here on on on on the board
[44:48] here there's four chapters in The Book
[44:50] of Ruth now the first chapter is is
[44:53] dealing with decision deciding you got
[44:55] to make your choice which way you're
[44:57] going to go amen and you girls girls
[45:00] like reading love stories y'all need to
[45:02] go and read the book of Ruth amen and
[45:05] and so the the second the the the the
[45:08] the second chapter is serving and you'll
[45:11] find that they're the heart of a of a
[45:13] servant yeah that the heart that is
[45:16] willing to love and then the next is
[45:18] resting and then finally the end she
[45:21] becomes the Bride of of of the
[45:23] wealthiest man of one of the wealthiest
[45:25] men in Israel and so that second chapter
[45:28] we find that Ruth is serving amen she's
[45:31] displaying as brother bradam would say
[45:33] the heart of every True Believer amen
[45:37] because they always have a have a desire
[45:40] to serve and to help amen and and she
[45:43] knew that her mother-in-law was breaking
[45:45] down in health and and and providing for
[45:48] herself would be would be difficult for
[45:51] her and and she didn't want her to uh to
[45:55] continue wearing down her body and and
[45:58] so she was she was willing she said
[46:00] listen I will go to work and I will take
[46:03] care of me and you and and and and you
[46:06] know I I think that's the way every
[46:08] Christian should be every one of us
[46:10] should have a desire and you especially
[46:13] you children with your parents you you
[46:14] should have a desire to take care of Mom
[46:16] and
[46:17] Dad can I hear an amen amen that's right
[46:22] I I don't care if if if your mama's 70
[46:24] years old or if she's 100 years old or
[46:27] if she's you know uh uh 30 years old our
[46:30] desires but I but more than just family
[46:33] I think we should have a desire you know
[46:36] you know Jesus uh uh brother Bram talked
[46:38] about blind Barda sitting on the road
[46:40] and how he had dreamed all night about
[46:42] the uh uh about being healed and and
[46:45] what it would have been if if Elijah you
[46:47] know if he was in the Days of Elijah
[46:49] amen and so there he he's there on the
[46:51] road and he's contemplating and then a
[46:53] throng is is coming by the Jericho
[46:55] coming down the Jericho Road and and and
[46:58] and he hears some things going on and
[47:00] and and he says blind bardus was got
[47:02] alarmed and and he says what's all of
[47:04] this about what's the matter what what's
[47:06] all the racket I hear and someone
[47:08] someone said out of the way you beggar
[47:10] others this way and that way and finally
[47:13] I believe it must have been some
[47:15] precious lady the the old fell had been
[47:17] pushed off his Rock and she said are you
[47:19] hurt sir and he says no ma'am I'm not
[47:21] hurt but I'm I can't understand what's
[47:24] all this noise about she says why Jesus
[47:27] of Nazareth the Galilean Prophet is
[47:29] passing this way and he says now good
[47:31] woman he he says she must have been a
[47:33] follower of C of Jesus because the
[47:35] followers of Jesus is always considerate
[47:38] they're kindhearted like to help people
[47:40] they like to do things do something to
[47:43] help somebody all the followers of Jesus
[47:45] act that way whether old people trying
[47:47] to cross the street a follower of Jesus
[47:50] doesn't uh just doesn't go on by and let
[47:53] them stand there to get ran over he
[47:57] stops and helps them across the street
[47:59] if if they see some poor old person with
[48:01] a big bunch of groceries a follower of
[48:03] Jesus stops to help them pack them home
[48:07] if they see somebody in need they they
[48:10] go help them that's what followers of
[48:13] Jesus does they're always kind and
[48:17] tenderhearted showing compassion doing
[48:20] things for somebody I I I believe that's
[48:23] what a Christian that that is what a
[48:25] Christian does Amen a Christian is one
[48:27] that that is that is always willing to
[48:30] do that and you'll notice that in your
[48:32] you you children in your mamas and
[48:33] daddies they're they're not one when
[48:35] when when when someone is in needing
[48:37] help your mom and daddies aren't the
[48:38] ones that's waiting for somebody else to
[48:40] go do the job but but it's always your
[48:42] mama that is that is in your daddy
[48:44] that's always raising up the hand and
[48:46] saying Hey I want to help I'll help let
[48:48] me do what I can to help you see that's
[48:51] the way a Christian does now a Christian
[48:53] doesn't keep scores say well I helped
[48:55] you yesterday I'm not going to help you
[48:56] today do no it's who we are Ruth had the
[49:01] heart of a servant she wanted to help
[49:06] her uh uh help Naomi and I I I you know
[49:09] and so here she goes and and and and the
[49:13] scripture uh says it was about the time
[49:15] of of of Boaz or about barley amen
[49:19] season and amen when they would bring in
[49:22] the barley and it was fresh bre bread
[49:24] season and amen and so but BST to her
[49:28] she happened in the field of Boaz are
[49:30] y'all following me so
[49:31] far who was next of kin to Naomi now she
[49:35] said I'm going to go and I'm going to to
[49:40] provide bread or I'm going to go get uh
[49:44] uh uh go get a job I'm going to bring in
[49:46] some groceries for you Naomi
[49:50] now now you know after so many days the
[49:54] Bible says this is all in the scripture
[49:56] you can read read that there that that
[49:58] that she caught the attention of Boaz
[50:03] and so Boaz asked his servant amen the
[50:06] the the the the the caretakers of of the
[50:08] property and and and he's and he's
[50:10] asking who is that girl amen and they
[50:13] said oh that's that's that's the
[50:14] moabitas she's come in from uh uh with
[50:18] Naomi and and and she's been here every
[50:21] day working and serving where she can
[50:23] and and he says now that good lady there
[50:26] he says make sure that you give her amen
[50:29] throw throw some extra behind as you're
[50:31] gleaning the the the the the barley he
[50:33] says leave handfuls of purpose behind so
[50:36] she don't have to work so hard to where
[50:38] she can come in and pick it up and and
[50:40] and and get the pick up the barley and
[50:42] that way she can take it home and and uh
[50:44] amen he he sort of knew knew the
[50:47] situation he knew her and he knew Naomi
[50:50] and amen but he taking a l to this girl
[50:53] and and so uh he came up to her and and
[50:56] and told her he says now listen I don't
[50:58] want you to go around in any other field
[51:00] I've done talk to my uh my my head
[51:02] servant here and they've told me all
[51:04] about you and told me how faithful you
[51:06] are and and he says now I want you to
[51:09] make sure you come up and eat with the
[51:11] rest of the guys when they're eating
[51:13] amen I I want you to get a drink
[51:15] whenever you have and and she and he
[51:18] actually went and got her some water and
[51:20] uh he there was something about the girl
[51:23] that he loved amen and there she was
[51:27] with that virtuous nature that she had
[51:30] amen that love pouring out for for her
[51:34] motherinlaw and and and and knowing that
[51:37] that it was all all all all abroad that
[51:42] she had left everything to come and to
[51:44] care for a woman that she wasn't even
[51:48] amen uh naturally K to and so here here
[51:52] She was and doing all of this work and
[51:55] coming back in and taken care of of
[51:58] Naomi in in her in her
[52:01] season and and there was
[52:04] something
[52:06] about that that that struck her heart
[52:10] she she she knew she could see it in the
[52:13] smile she could see it in the in his in
[52:17] his uh in his tenderness and his eyes
[52:19] toward her that she had caught his
[52:22] attention also amen and so she as she's
[52:25] going out and working and amen one day
[52:28] he loaded her up and he comes back she
[52:31] and she asked him Naomi ask what where
[52:34] have you been and and and and she she
[52:38] tells him I I've been back out there at
[52:40] Boaz and I've not been out to any other
[52:42] field and and and there she she is uh uh
[52:46] Naomi says amen I I I I don't know if
[52:49] you know it but he's next of kin he is
[52:54] my husband's brother
[52:57] and he has the rights of
[53:02] redemption and and and he she's not
[53:06] understanding amen the the uh Jewish uh
[53:11] ways of redemption and and and so uh
[53:14] Ruth is saying I don't guess I
[53:16] understand she says you got to
[53:19] understand amen that in order that I
[53:23] cannot redeem myself we've lost our PR
[53:26] property amen we are here living as as
[53:30] orphans you and me but you have happened
[53:35] into the
[53:37] field of my husband's brother and he has
[53:44] the rights of
[53:46] redemption in other words he has the
[53:50] ability to redeem all of us amen take me
[53:56] back to where give us back our land give
[53:59] us back our amen and so uh uh uh he she
[54:03] she is excited and so if you go to the
[54:06] third
[54:06] chapter and uh and you'll you you'll
[54:10] you'll see amen he says oh I'm not I'm
[54:13] going to seek rest for you now now Naomi
[54:16] is not interested in just for herself
[54:20] he's she's saying listen you like him
[54:23] and he likes you amen there's something
[54:27] about this now this is a gentile girl
[54:30] and a Jewish man and God already said
[54:34] there better not ever be
[54:37] any relations between the Jews and the
[54:40] moabites amen that's something else but
[54:42] maybe you m can teach can can can take
[54:45] uh in your next Bible study amen show
[54:47] them the curse that God gave the
[54:49] moabites oh they were cursed amen till
[54:52] the end of the world I mean they because
[54:54] they were bad to the to to the Jews when
[54:58] they were coming into their own land
[54:59] they wouldn't let their cattle uh drink
[55:01] water they wouldn't let them have any
[55:03] any of their crops and so God cursed him
[55:05] with a curse and told Israel stay away
[55:07] from him but now here God's
[55:10] orchestrating something of divine
[55:14] grace oh praise the
[55:17] Lord this Jewish man who was very very
[55:21] very very very wealthy was interested in
[55:25] that was that was showing love and favor
[55:27] to this moabit girl amen are y'all
[55:30] following me now amen so Naomi says all
[55:35] right now this is Ruth 3 and one Naomi
[55:39] her mother-in-law said unto her my
[55:41] daughter shall I not seek rest for thee
[55:43] that it may be well with thee amen he
[55:46] says now is now is not Boaz our Kindred
[55:50] with whose maidens thou was behold he
[55:53] winnoweth barley tonight at the
[55:55] threshing floor now wi with barley that
[55:58] that mean that's when they take the
[56:00] barley out of the field amen and and
[56:03] they and they're the hard kernels and so
[56:06] they'll either take rocks and and beat
[56:08] those kernels and and and and so that
[56:11] they can get to the to the good stuff on
[56:13] the inside or they'll they'll actually
[56:15] stomp on it and uh they'll they'll have
[56:17] a they'll just have a party and they're
[56:19] all in there stomping and getting and
[56:21] and and while they're doing this then
[56:24] they've got uh and they do this in the e
[56:26] evening time when the winds are blowing
[56:28] and then they've got they've got these
[56:29] little shovel type deals as rake type
[56:31] Deals they put up and they throw it up
[56:33] in the air and then all of the all of
[56:36] the other stuff blows away and then the
[56:39] lights or the light stuff blows away and
[56:41] then the good stuff amen The Barley
[56:44] itself it settles back to the ground and
[56:46] so that's what winth is amen they
[56:48] they're winnowing the the barley and so
[56:51] she says there it's it's noised around
[56:53] the community that they're going to be
[56:55] doing that tonight she says I want you
[56:58] to do this I want you to go in there I I
[57:01] want you to take a bath and and uh they
[57:04] didn't have bath back then but want you
[57:06] to clean up and I and and I maybe they
[57:09] did have bath but anyways and then put
[57:11] and then I want you to dress yourself
[57:13] really nice he says because once it's
[57:16] all done amen he's going to stay in he's
[57:19] going to sleep out there to guard The
[57:21] Barley so that no one will steal it and
[57:23] and I and I want you to go in there
[57:25] about midnight I want you to go in when
[57:27] he's asleep and you sneak up to him and
[57:32] you lay at his feet and when he wakes up
[57:37] he'll tell you what to do now now
[57:41] listen th this this
[57:44] was this was really scandalous amen and
[57:48] and it's all in the Scripture it it it
[57:50] it it it tell it it tells it the fourth
[57:52] verse says and it shall be when he lies
[57:53] down Thou shalt Mark the place where he
[57:56] shall lie and thou shalt go in and
[57:59] uncover his feet and lay thee down and
[58:02] he will tell thee what you must do amen
[58:06] and so he marked the place brother
[58:08] brother brandham just loved this story
[58:10] as he's in in as as he's talking about
[58:12] the uh kinsman redeemer he says Mark the
[58:15] place he says this was Our
[58:20] Redeemer and and and to mark that place
[58:23] where he laid down where did Jesus lay
[58:25] down Jesus laid at Calvary amen Jesus
[58:29] was laid at gol gotha Jesus was laid
[58:32] there amen and she's telling him you you
[58:35] go in there amen and and you be
[58:38] identified with him and I wonder tonight
[58:41] amen if if we should Mark that place
[58:45] where Christ laid down as Our Redeemer
[58:48] amen where did he lay golgatha he
[58:51] overcome at Calvary now I I now I
[58:54] thought this is interesting because this
[58:55] is a type again Naomi says Mark that
[58:59] spot where he lay and I want you to join
[59:03] him right there can you say amen amen
[59:07] amen I I I think
[59:08] tonight it would be a little
[59:11] oldfashioned to lay at his feet it would
[59:14] be a little old fashion for a woman amen
[59:17] because that that is an act of
[59:18] submission to a man amen it it's it's an
[59:22] act of uh uh a surrendering of of Rights
[59:27] it's an act of humility laying down
[59:30] there at the feet of a man no that's
[59:33] that's that that that wouldn't fit with
[59:36] the feminist uh way of thinking in this
[59:39] day amen now a but but it's the way that
[59:44] she was instructed and she was willing
[59:47] to follow the
[59:50] instructions can you say amen and so
[59:54] amen so that and that's what we've got
[59:56] to do now that before I go on any
[59:58] further I want you to really take that
[59:59] type because brother Brandon spent a lot
[1:00:00] of time on that he says Mark that spot
[1:00:04] where did Christ pay the price of
[1:00:07] redemption for you where did Christ he
[1:00:10] done that at Calvary he lay there at
[1:00:14] gotha if you want to find amen if you
[1:00:18] want to find favor with him meet him
[1:00:21] there where he laid down
[1:00:26] and when she laid down it startled it's
[1:00:28] all there there in the third chapter it
[1:00:30] startled
[1:00:32] Boaz man and Boaz is looking at her and
[1:00:35] saying what are what are you doing here
[1:00:38] amen what what what are you doing here
[1:00:41] and uh amen and and and and she uh she
[1:00:45] says uh
[1:00:47] amen praise the Lord uh uh let's see
[1:00:51] here let me find where I'm supposed to
[1:00:53] be at amen
[1:00:56] and and and he says' who artart thou and
[1:00:57] she says I am Ruth thine handmaiden now
[1:00:59] watch this he says she says spread
[1:01:02] therefore thy skirt over thine handmade
[1:01:06] for thou art a near Kinsman brother Bram
[1:01:11] would teach us he said that was a type
[1:01:13] you're meeting Christ at gol gooth
[1:01:16] there's where he paid his price and when
[1:01:18] you are willing to come in humility and
[1:01:21] suffer the reproach and suffer amen the
[1:01:25] indignation and suffer the scoffing of
[1:01:28] the people amen for you believing in
[1:01:30] such a message and you believing in the
[1:01:33] Bible and you believing and giving your
[1:01:35] lives uh uh to this Jesus Christ when
[1:01:38] the world is all turned H has turned to
[1:01:41] commercialism and all of these kinds of
[1:01:43] things and and but this was not what got
[1:01:45] him with the got what got him was is
[1:01:48] when she said take thy
[1:01:52] skirt and cover me with it
[1:01:56] brother Bron says oh the anointing that
[1:02:00] Holy Spirit that was upon him she's
[1:02:04] asked for that anointing to come upon
[1:02:07] her for thou art a
[1:02:11] kinsman redeemer am now now why am I
[1:02:16] telling my telling this story well I'm
[1:02:19] telling this story because it's a good
[1:02:20] story but I'm telling the story because
[1:02:23] this is a type of where you and I are
[1:02:26] today amen she had she had found herself
[1:02:32] at the feet of
[1:02:34] Boaz she asked for his covering not her
[1:02:38] own covering not not I I want you to
[1:02:42] redeem me but I'm still going to be who
[1:02:44] I want to be no no no no no she didn't
[1:02:46] ask for her own covering she asked for
[1:02:49] his covering Hallelujah I I you know I I
[1:02:54] I I you know I still believe in the
[1:02:56] oldfashioned gospel and I think I I I
[1:02:59] think there's a time for a woman to be
[1:03:01] talking to her man and a and a time when
[1:03:03] a woman shouldn't be talking to her man
[1:03:04] I think women should respect their
[1:03:08] husbands he's your leader you should not
[1:03:11] get on to your man you should not tell
[1:03:13] him where to get off you should not tell
[1:03:15] him what he's to do and what he's not to
[1:03:17] do he is your provider he's a type of
[1:03:22] the Redeemer he's a type of Jesus
[1:03:27] Christ now whether you believe that or
[1:03:29] not that's up to you but but but the
[1:03:31] scripture did say that the prde of this
[1:03:34] last day the great is going to say
[1:03:38] am I not rich am I not increased with
[1:03:40] goods and do I not have everything and
[1:03:42] he's going to say you are
[1:03:47] naked because you've covered yourself
[1:03:50] with your own covering and you've not
[1:03:54] covered yourself with your husband
[1:03:57] Christ that's well Hallelujah oh yeah
[1:04:01] it's no wonder they're trying to rewrite
[1:04:03] the Bible all the time and they got so
[1:04:04] many different versions is
[1:04:06] because it just don't fit it don't fit
[1:04:10] in This Woman's World but I want to tell
[1:04:12] you if you're going to belong to God's
[1:04:14] world we've got to accept God's
[1:04:17] way and if God's going to redeem us the
[1:04:21] way we act in our individual walks is
[1:04:24] the way we're acting to him that's
[1:04:28] right now how could that great church
[1:04:30] how could the Roman Church be called a
[1:04:34] you know does that mean there's
[1:04:36] been some uh there's been people you
[1:04:38] know out committing adultery and stuff
[1:04:40] like that that that mean there's church
[1:04:42] people you know in in the high up that's
[1:04:44] going and and and having sex with kings
[1:04:46] and queens all over the world no no it
[1:04:50] was a spiritual
[1:04:52] act taking another
[1:04:56] opinions taking her own opinions over
[1:05:00] amen God's
[1:05:02] opinion and it's individual women that
[1:05:05] make up and men and women that make up
[1:05:07] the marriage and it is the individual
[1:05:11] families that make up the church and the
[1:05:14] church is either going to be and part of
[1:05:17] the Great Horror or they'll be a part of
[1:05:20] the Divine
[1:05:22] bride it's our choice with way we're
[1:05:26] going to be I want I want I I I I I want
[1:05:30] to go like I'm taught amen she was
[1:05:33] willing to do what she was told she was
[1:05:36] willing to go at the feet of Boaz Amen
[1:05:39] to lift up his skirt that covered his
[1:05:42] feet amen and to ask for him to come or
[1:05:45] to lay at his feet and then he and ask
[1:05:47] for his skirt to cover over
[1:05:53] her can I hear an amen
[1:05:56] now now watch
[1:05:58] Hallelujah and I don't see I don't see
[1:06:01] the rest of my my scripture there but I
[1:06:03] I want to read this to you because it's
[1:06:05] good hallelujah amen now now the ninth
[1:06:09] verse again who art thou I am Ruth and
[1:06:11] handmate spread therefore thy skirt over
[1:06:13] thine handmaid for thou art near Kinsman
[1:06:16] and what did he say blessed be thou of
[1:06:20] the Lord my daughter for thou Hast shown
[1:06:24] more kind Ness in the latter end than at
[1:06:29] the beginning in as much as thou
[1:06:31] followed not young men whether poor or
[1:06:34] Rich and now my daughter fear not I will
[1:06:39] do to thee all that
[1:06:44] thou
[1:06:45] requirest hallu
[1:06:49] hallu I'm in need of
[1:06:52] redemption I'm in need and it was
[1:06:54] through humil
[1:06:56] that she came before her
[1:06:59] Boaz and her act of submission her act
[1:07:03] her kindness her her humility what did
[1:07:06] he say he says H you're better to me and
[1:07:10] your End Amen you were good to me but
[1:07:12] not following the other men and not
[1:07:14] following this way and that way but this
[1:07:17] this is the act he says I will do all
[1:07:22] well glory to God you know what she was
[1:07:24] saying she was saying you are my you
[1:07:28] have the ability to redeem me I'm asking
[1:07:32] you to redeem me amen I know you have
[1:07:35] the power I know you have the ability
[1:07:37] and she didn't have to beg her act of
[1:07:40] humility caused a response from him that
[1:07:43] says I will do all that thou
[1:07:47] sayest I will do all that you're
[1:07:51] requesting of
[1:07:53] me well praise the Lord now this is a
[1:07:57] love story of love
[1:07:58] stories this is a woman that does not
[1:08:01] even belong in the nation of Israel this
[1:08:03] is a
[1:08:04] woman that God
[1:08:08] allowed this is a
[1:08:10] woman wait a minute wait a
[1:08:14] minute this is a woman this Gentile
[1:08:17] woman this bride of how did I get
[1:08:24] here the G Gentiles weren't even a part
[1:08:27] of redemption we were
[1:08:29] dogs God never dealt with Gentiles he
[1:08:33] only dealt with the Jews he called jabr
[1:08:36] Braham and told him it would be your
[1:08:40] seed did you know that the Bible says
[1:08:42] that God blinded the Jews in Jesus
[1:08:47] day God blinded the
[1:08:51] Jews so that they would reject the
[1:08:55] gospel they left the Covenant they left
[1:08:59] the blessings amen now they've not left
[1:09:01] the Covenant because God still loves the
[1:09:03] Jews can you say Amen but they left what
[1:09:06] happened they rejected the
[1:09:10] Christ so that all of us Gentiles could
[1:09:13] come into
[1:09:16] relation
[1:09:18] God the Bible says God blinded their
[1:09:23] eyes now there's two blindings
[1:09:26] amen the first blinding was to J was to
[1:09:29] the Jews the Jews were blinded but the
[1:09:32] scripture says it wasn't willfully God
[1:09:34] blinded their eyes so that you and I
[1:09:36] could be called now the Gentiles are
[1:09:40] blinded but they are willfully
[1:09:45] blinded come on they are going after
[1:09:48] their own ways and they are willfully
[1:09:50] blinded Oh Glory to God now why did God
[1:09:55] why did God blind the eyes of H H
[1:10:00] IMC and
[1:10:02] Naomi and they go down into the land of
[1:10:06] cursing and lose their sons and lo Naomi
[1:10:09] lose her husband death is all around
[1:10:12] them listen why did God allow those Jews
[1:10:16] to uh to to reject Christ and the Bible
[1:10:20] says in Ezekiel man that there would be
[1:10:23] blood just h uh uh uh slain all over
[1:10:26] Jerusalem and it would start right there
[1:10:28] at at the
[1:10:30] temple that Titus would come in and just
[1:10:33] totally obliterate there were millions
[1:10:35] of people that has been killed and
[1:10:37] destroyed because of the act of
[1:10:41] forsaking
[1:10:45] Christ death followed
[1:10:47] them so that God could call you that's
[1:10:51] right now I I I I am am I am I making
[1:10:55] this am I making this uh good enough for
[1:10:57] you
[1:10:57] youngans God that this is Bible now this
[1:11:01] is Bible the Apostle Paul deals with
[1:11:03] this in the Book of Romans he deals with
[1:11:05] it when in in the in the ninth chapter
[1:11:07] in the 10th chapter and I believe the
[1:11:09] 11th chapter you can go in and read it
[1:11:11] where it talks about how God blinded the
[1:11:14] Jews so that us
[1:11:18] Gentiles could come in now all right now
[1:11:21] back to my story now so so here Naomi
[1:11:26] God allowed Naomi to go down there
[1:11:29] because there was a Ruth that had to
[1:11:32] meet
[1:11:34] Boaz praise the Lord because Ruth would
[1:11:38] and Boaz was going to type Jesus and his
[1:11:41] Gentile bride amen
[1:11:45] hallelujah now why do we call it

[1:30:48] his skirt to be placed over her to cover
[1:30:51] me with yours what well glory to God

[1:30:59] that it was a sign it was a it was a
[1:31:02] sign of humility I wouldn't suggest you
[1:31:04] do that to any boy today amen that might
[1:31:08] not be good but the thing is that she

[1:39:48] better so as we talk this morning there
[1:39:52] are
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:56] brother brandham would disguise would
[1:39:58] would describe it he says we will go
[1:40:00] into total
[1:40:01] lawlessness I've read that quote to you
[1:40:03] several times over the
[1:40:05] years
[1:40:08] lawlessness to where the laws of God
[1:40:11] just just not going to mean
[1:40:18] anything and we can see the spirit of
[1:40:21] lawlessness today until the LA really
[1:40:23] truly laws don't matter any they don't
[1:40:25] it doesn't
[1:40:27] matter but it reflects it reflects where
[1:40:31] the church has been in a for a while the
[1:40:34] church has been a lawless church not not
[1:40:37] the bride I'm not talking about the
[1:40:38] bride I'm talking about the
[1:40:40] church the great the great wh and her
[1:40:46] daughters denominationalism putting
[1:40:49] their thoughts and opinions before that
[1:40:50] of
[1:40:51] God the lack of humility before
[1:40:55] God just really just
[1:41:00] and you
[1:41:01] know brother brandham says we need to
[1:41:04] get
[1:41:05] back to where Sarah is in her tent and
[1:41:08] letting God talk to her
[1:41:11] husband he said he brings it in he says
[1:41:15] and it says that in this
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:20] day that if you will be as Sarah
[1:41:26] and obeying your own
[1:41:28] husbands he said you will be called the
[1:41:31] daughters of
[1:41:33] Sarah now that's incredible because it's
[1:41:35] been brought into the scripture her
[1:41:40] obedience and I know it always gets
[1:41:42] tight when when when we preach along
[1:41:44] that I'm not I'm not getting on to you
[1:41:46] to you women in the slightest but if the
[1:41:49] shoe fits wear it
[1:41:56] but we are
[1:41:58] all part of that
[1:42:00] bride and that's that's that's in God
[1:42:04] that's neither male nor female it's
[1:42:07] it's our
[1:42:09] attitudes toward God can be
[1:42:14] really
[1:42:16] [Music]
[1:42:17] stinky have you noticed have have you
[1:42:20] have you kids noticed uh U Maybe kids a
[1:42:23] little bit more than well maybe all of
[1:42:25] us I don't know I just I just go looking
[1:42:27] at even some of the the the music videos
[1:42:30] the the Christian music videos some of
[1:42:31] [Music]

[1:42:36] them because there's a song that you
[1:42:38] like or that you've heard that we sing
[1:42:40] even and and you'll see these
[1:42:43] guys up there on the platform with their
[1:42:46] hats in the church turn backwards and
[1:42:49] they're up there singing and people in
[1:42:51] the church dancing and they've got
[1:42:54] they've got their hats on and they've
[1:42:58] got to me it's a lack of respect am am I
[1:43:03] I am I the only one thinking that am I
[1:43:05] just an old
[1:43:07] fogy I mean really is it is it is
[1:43:12] respect and reverence going to be gone
[1:43:16] with this
[1:43:20] generation because there was there was
[1:43:22] someone that that was that that came
[1:43:24] here a real Precious brother that that
[1:43:26] came here and sat and enjoyed the
[1:43:27] service cried all the way through the
[1:43:28] service but he couldn't get over that he
[1:43:31] was asked to leave his hat off he'd come
[1:43:34] walking in with a Jesus hat on and and
[1:43:38] they stopped him there at the door and
[1:43:39] said if you wouldn't mind taking off
[1:43:41] your hat and it really made him upset
[1:43:43] but he but he come and he and he and he
[1:43:44] and he enjoyed the service he just wept
[1:43:46] and enjoyed the service but then when he
[1:43:48] laughed it's just ate him up so ate him
[1:43:51] up
[1:43:53] and over at Wendell's
[1:43:55] church I had a hat on and it said
[1:43:58] Jesus now all we were asking for is a
[1:44:02] little bit of reverence I I I I I know I
[1:44:06] know I know
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:10] it I know that I used to tell my boys if
[1:44:13] you ever appear before a judge or you do
[1:44:15] it put on your shirt and tie if you go
[1:44:18] anywhere important I know it's not that
[1:44:21] way anymore I know
[1:44:30] I watched a clip last night of an
[1:44:32] anointed man oh gosh he was
[1:44:35] anointed and he had his shirt had his P
[1:44:39] out of his
[1:44:40] pants he had his t- tennis shoes on his
[1:44:44] suit
[1:44:44] coat and and and his shirt out of his
[1:44:47] pants you know no tide and he's just
[1:44:50] preaching away and people were up there
[1:44:52] just
[1:44:53] just aen and him with her hats on
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:45:06] and I don't know
[1:45:08] they're they're getting
[1:45:17] something cuz there's an emotion about
[1:45:19] them
[1:45:20] [Music]
[1:45:23] the guy was preaching like nobody's
[1:45:27] [Music]
[1:45:31] business yet they were dressing ungodly
[1:45:35] and
[1:45:35] provocative I looked at the audience and
[1:45:38] I thought I know I know there's nothing
[1:45:41] in the Bible says you you don't that you
[1:45:43] come to church without a hat I know
[1:45:48] [Music]
[1:45:51] that but it's been the custom of our of
[1:45:54] our
[1:45:56] culture to show
[1:45:59] reverence and
[1:46:02] respect it seems
[1:46:06] like in this age of
[1:46:10] [Music]
[1:46:14] lawlessness that we can't give him
[1:46:16] respect it
[1:46:18] [Music]
[1:46:21] all and that's the very thing that
[1:46:25] ultimately won boaz's heart was the act
[1:46:29] of
[1:46:30] reverence he says this thing out of
[1:46:33] everything you've done you've been there
[1:46:34] you you said you didn't follow the other
[1:46:36] guys the young men and all of you and

[1:46:42] me I will do what you're asking me to do
[1:46:47] I will redeem you
[1:46:53] just I don't
[1:47:00] know I I I don't think it's
[1:47:05] legalism showing him
[1:47:07] respect I think it's legalism in our
[1:47:12] homes loving him
[1:47:16] and keeping stuff off of our Bibles
[1:47:20] inste of putting stuff on top of our
[1:47:22] Bibles
[1:47:23] [Music]
