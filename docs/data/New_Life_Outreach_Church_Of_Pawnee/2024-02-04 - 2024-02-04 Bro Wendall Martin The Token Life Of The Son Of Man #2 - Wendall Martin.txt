praise the name of the Lord amen and so we're we sure uh glad to see everyone here tonight in the house of the Lord and and uh amen coming back on a Sunday night uh we got our tummies full and sometimes it's a little a little hard on on these Sunday nights but uh I believe if we make the effort to come God will make the effort to be here you know brother bradam said that he always shows up where he's wanted and so how many wants him here tonight amen we want the Holy Spirit to be here with us if you have your Bibles we'll look here in St John the 14th chapter and um we want to um keep sister Karen in our prayers she's going to be uh going in for surgery on on that arm that the wrist that she broke and so that's that's going to be this this coming Tuesday so at the end of the service sister sh Karen we want to uh pray with you and and um amen she she broke that was a clean that that was a good cut uh cut it all the way she she broke it all the way through but um it's a it's a real uh going to be a tedious operation and and um right there where it happened and so it's just um but we're just believing the Lord's going to be with her and be with the surgeon and um so we want to do that before we uh dismiss tonight and um how many enjoyed the word of the Lord this morning wasn't that just wonderful amen I love that word this morning let's look here in St John 14 and we'll let's just start at the 13th verse and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the sun if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if ye love me keep my Commandments I will pray the father and he will give give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I'm in the father ye in me and I in you now brother brandham would say that this is the day this day is the day that brother BR or that that Jesus was talking about in that day I will be in you you will be in me and the world will know it amen and then a very familiar passage of scripture there in in Revelations 10 and one just going to read the first two verses and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face where as it the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot upon the earth now if you would go back and read there in the first chapter of Revelations you would know that the was Christ amen this was Christ that has been promised in this day what a promise father we want to thank you today for your love thank you for your blessings and the anointing of the holy spirit that we feel tonight thank you for the message this morning Lord thank you for people who still have a craving for you and to love you and to know you and your presence to be with them I ask God that you would just be here tonight Lord we want the power of your Holy Spirit In Our Lives Lord we want everything that you've promised for this day for we know that without your life Lord life is meaningless and without your life there is no Rapture for us so Lord we want your life within us now God I just pray that your Spirit would be here in everything that is done and said tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated I want to speak tonight amen um along the lines again of the token life of the son of man and uh we've been talking about the son of man and and what the the son of man is and and so we want the token life of the son of man we there have been a few questions uh along those lines amen what is the what's the difference why why make a big deal uh uh or um if the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost then then why do we um you know talk about the of man the Son of God the son of David and um we understand that the son of man is has been promised for for our day and how that the Holy Spirit would take form in humans as the son of man in the last days this would be the logos of God Amen manifested in flesh and and it's it's still the same Holy Ghost it was the holy ghost in Jesus that made him the son of man he was he was the god of the Old Testament living in a body and so you can see as we as as I put here amen we've got the son of man can you'all see that we we've got um the son of man uh it's the same Holy Ghost In Christ it's the holy ghost in a man in The Seven Ages it's the Son of God the Holy Ghost as intercessor through Seven Ages because the Seven Ages amen since the Antichrist has come in the church is not in its completion amen the church is not where it should be what it needs to be so we have got the intercessor the Son of God but the promise has been in this last days amen right before the Rapture time there would be a bride time in this evening time of the of the leoty and age and Christ would come again he would come with an open book this would be the the fullness of God if you will coming down to give life to the people for the for the Rapture and so you you can see amen the original Christ Pentecost that early that that first church had the son of man then we' went to the son of Son of God it's still the same Holy Ghost but the holy ghost have the fullness of Christ and the church the holy spirit will lead and guide this church like no other age since Pentecost amen that's the promise of this age that's that's where we're going so when we talk about it's still it's all the Holy Ghost but it's God been promised in this day greater than than any other day because the re Revelation has come back to us like it was at the beginning the anointing is here for that and so amen just to give a little bit of Prelude to what I'm fixing to to to talk to you about here this evening I believe that there should be a cry within the church for the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Spirit could not fill the Luther it was the Holy Ghost coming up through the plant amen it was the life it was the life of God in this sea that that came through and stuck its head up after the the the the the Dark Ages through Luther life was there that's why it was green that's why it was growing it was the Holy Ghost in that plant but it was not giving the token life that went into the ground amen the Holy Ghost came up to Wesley amen and and and through and through the leaves and the stock came on up through through 1906 you see but it could not be the fullness because the plant had not come to its completion if there's ever a time for us to desire and seek for the fullness of God this fullness is not amen learning we had the book all along but you see it was the son of man that Mighty angel with the rainbow over his head it was the Holy Ghost like never before coming and putting his feet upon the land and the Sea can you say man now brother brandham would say I challenge you to believe God what what is that it's the identification of Jesus Christ you say what is that he is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the word was made Flash and dwelt Among Us the word is sharper than a two-edged sword a discerner of the thought and intents of the heart can't you see the word has come Among Us in this last days it's the Holy Spirit taking the word of God identifying Jesus Christ which is the token you could not have the token life in 1906 it was not given that was just a portion that was a baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it was not the fullness of the plan now now brother Brandon would talk about in in the church age book the resume of the ages he he would say the birth of the church was at Pentecost and at and as the first Adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of God and was UN undefiled for a certain span so was Christ the last Adam given the pure Bri uh given a bride pure and fresh at Pentecost and she remained separate and undefiled for some time now how long this continued we do not know but one day even as Eve was tempted and seduced by Satan so the church was contaminated by the entrance of the Antichrist spirit and we understand that was right there in that first age Amen to where that church had fallen and the the original word seed bride fell are are y understanding me it was the Antichrist denominational Spirit Christ was no longer the head he was no longer their all in all that first church left her first love begin to wander and taken other men's ideas Creeds dogmas instead of God's and and and and the first church believed nothing but what God Said and what God Said alone can you say say amen amen and now now we find that even uh through the whole uh Church age it's been the Son of God and and and and there in in in in uh Romans the 8th chapter we we can understand why brother brandham would put this as the Son of God because uh as the holy ghost in the uh in the in between and that is because of the he's he is it's the spirit of Christ interceding for us it's the spirit of Christ amen that is there in in in 8 and 26 it says uh it says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray as we ought the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession intercession for the saints of God according to the will of God so so we can see that the the holy spirit is the intercessor that is in between it's the same spirit of God intered there is a lamb set on the throne there's a lamb's blood that is there the holy spirit is interceding for the church age in her imperfection God is saying I will not leave this church like I done Eden I am going to stay here and restore her and make her what she is supposed to be what I had in my mind for her well praise the Lord amen what I had in my mind for her is where I'm going now amen ausa was still under the Reformation amen now now brother brandom would say if the true spirit of God there it it'll direct into the word not just one place in the word the the entire word for the entire age it says now Pentecost the spirit directed it uh right right into that to Joel 238 uh the day of Luther it directed it right into that Wesley and in this last Pentecostal move but this is another age this is a calling out of the Bride amen he says the the Holy Spirit was in Luther the Holy Spirit was in Wesley and God's word being anointed the Holy Spirit turned to the people of the age and they begin to have the restoration of the gifts and they found out by yielding themselves to God the Holy Ghost spoke it through tongues through them they laid hands on the sick they was recovered they danced in the spirit that was the age of reformation bringing the church back into order and the last order of the church was the placing of the gifts into the church like Luther was placed just ification Wesley sanctification the Pentecostals place the gifts now he goes on down he says but now is the bride calling now is when the Seven Seals has been opened now when the complete things that the reformers left off has been open only Malachi 4 can do that because it takes the Revelation straight from God to an individual to do so that's right it can't come to a group it never did one man that's what God promised in the shadows of his coming for the bride and elzer well can you say Amen so so we can see here as you're if you're following me along amen they thought that the baptism of the Holy Ghost which was the restoration of the gifts was amen the final outpouring of the Holy Ghost it was still under Reformation amen now now what what what do we mean by Reformation it was still under the man age the man age was still under Reformation they had been they had come from justification sanctification speaking in tongues knowing that that had to come Hallelujah but the realities of God could only come through a prophet messenger amen can you say Amen now I I want us to to to look here it took an elzer now another scripture or another quote that I want to that I just want to put here that amen that Pentecost was a Reformation is in the rater message message and he says what if what if Moses would have come and brought Noah's message will build an ark and float down the Nile it wouldn't have worked but neither was Jesus message ever worked by Moses neither will Wesley's message ever work in Luther Luther's message vice versa today our last great Reformation was Pentecost but we're moving from that and the Pentecostal message won't mix with this because it is another day can you say amen amen he he uses another he begins to talk about the the the three stages the three women representing the three stages he talks about Sarah Hagar and then talks about Mary amen and he and he says now these three women were carriers amen one one brought forth a natural son another one brought forth uh the the uh uh uh the bond son the other one brought forth the word then he takes the three stages and he begins to use this do it this way amen he takes the blade stalk and shuck he says we we've had the three women that have brought it in but it will take the Shu or the Pentecostal 1906 move to bring on the reality of the word for the day now he would say there in that the seed is is not air with a Shu he says we can see the true revelation of the true type there's three women carriers of the natural seed until matured into Jesus Christ amen he says the shu is a carrier that's exactly what our denominations have been a carrier Luther Wesley Pentecostals and now it's time for the seed to come forth notice she was not the seed Mary was not just a Shu the tassel stock carriers of part of the word not all of the word Luther had justification Wesley had sanctification Pentecostals had restoration of the gifts but when the word came that's your time to start shouting hallelujah amen he says now they could produce that justification will save a man you believe that sure it's a carrier of the word it's the same as the stock it's part of the weak sure it is but it's a carrier it ain't the life it ain't the life now Brothers I just want to tell you this message is not learning and I I I I want us all I want us to be filled with the same holy spirit that came down in in two or in 1963 I believe Arizona 1963 when that cloud came down that was the Holy Spirit of all Seven Ages coming to the Bride of Jesus christall Hallelujah I believe it amen now it goes how many believes in sanctification you you have you believe the Bible you have to sure it's it's a little more that that's that's two more words but then come the Pentecost the restoration of the gifts amen speaking in tongues they call it the initial evidence of of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues they call uh they call it the initial evidence which brought forth the what the Shu they denominated but when you say I and my father are one these other things then the Shu begins to pull away from it that the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness in its Mist amen for he's the same yesterday today and forever can you say amen amen he says now the world is in a is is in a Sodom condition church has went into Sodom like lot and his wife and I say there's an elect church somewhere in this world that's pull out set aside of those things and the manifestation of God has attracted its attention where're at the last days the Shu has give forth its strength into the sea it's went on out it's been it was a good sh but it served its time now see it is word Bride of the word groom amen cannot he says it's the seed time Brad time the shars are dead the sharks are dried up the Virgin word time not touch it's virgin and remember a virgin word time now what is what what what is all of this link because brother brandham just isn't smart enough to make this up on his own all right the holy spirit is directing this prophet and pointing these things out so that we can truly see where we are he's putting these stages in there so that you and I can identify where our desires and where our focus should be in this evening time Hallelujah the fullness of the son of man could not come in this in this calf age in this man age it can only come in the eagle age Eagle AG is the prophet age it's that prophetic class that brother Josh was talking about this morning can you say amen amen now watch brother brandom in the Feast of the trumpet 64 he says the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years where's the 2,000 years it's from right here to right here the Holy Spirit has been bound by Creeds for 2,00 years he says by these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the whole Holy Spirit back into the church what it was here is what it'll be there the evening time the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said it he promised it amen well praise the Lord hallelujah now I want you to catch this because the realities I and you I'm going to be talking about realities for I'm going to say it a bunch of times tonight it's not learn this is not reality the reality is when it's walking off the pages and living in me the reality is when the words that brother brandham has been preaching finally begins to start striking our home by in our heart by Revelation and we can stand up and say we are that people amen we're called for this day this is the rapture I will oh can you say amen amen now now brother brandham in the when he when he talks he says now he says that seed that fell in the ground uh at at Nia that was the original seed that's this is in the Masterpiece and she's come through the process of these denominations which only comes into existence once but the Pride returns back again in the last days I will restore the Masterpiece is brought back up that's the reason she was in view reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time and then she was reviewed the second time and she's perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy hurry hurry hurry life get in the grain right quick quick he says all these others all these others never appeared again they went out and never came back up he says they've never appeared again these ages will never ever are come on Church they will never ever appear again this was not what God was after he says I am the author and I am the finisher I am the alpha I am the Omega brother bradam says he says nothing about in between what he was there is what he is here hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelu oh come on Church what he was at the first he must oh God Amen and we triy to put it on a prophet we tried to put it on a single man amen it took Malachi 4 to turn our hearts back to the original it took Malachi 4all can you say amen amen how many believes that you're the children that God's turned their hearts back to can you say amen he says all these others never appeared no more they never went out they they never uh they went out never to come back but the bride comes back because she is Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor has made him a masterpiece for it is a piece of his of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden and took a piece from it made another piece and that was marred and fell now he's been all this time building it up again and he brought forth his Masterpiece and it was smitten in order uh that part uh and that part that was smitten was in order to bring him again uh that m Masterpiece again so the Masterpiece the Son of God the the Masterpiece and the bride it's a piece of him which must be the fulfilling of the word the word has been fulfilled and we're ready for the coming of the Lord can you say Amen now the promise is that the original is coming the promise now Satan knows that he knows it this other churches they don't know it they can't see it they've not seen the opening of the seals they've not heard the eagle anointing so they're not concerned they're they're they're wrapped up in in man-made ideas and music and religion and oh God but there is a people that is not going to be content sitting on a Pew they're not going to be content sitting in a church they're not going to be content just reading a Bible they want the same home holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost they want the same God that was in Jesus Christ dwelling in them yes sir amen come on Amen we got to we got to break away amen from playing church we got to break away from every kind of a tradition to see Jesus Christ Living in US amen don't amen it ain't a bunch of quotes and don't amen it ain't how much we learned it's the life of God living in us that's putting his foot up on land and sea Hollywood and Rome can you sayen yes yes now brother Brandon would say the first he fell and and was used in the second Reformation the second coming is as as bringing forth a child child now is become the true bride again the seed the Alpha and the Omega is the same he said I'm Alpha and Omega he never said anything in between I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last he didn't say anything about the in between I'm Alpha and Omega I was the first I'll be the last amen he says yes sir the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message and the second the last Ministry is the same I was in Alpha I'm in Omega there will be a day that won't be called night or day and but in the evening time it shall be light see Alpha and Omega it's become the first and the last my brother we could stay on that for hours The Great Masterpiece of a family the second Adam and the second Eve now ready for the garden the Millennium amen and back on the earth the great sculpture didn't leave them lay there he took it he took time as he did through the million years molding the first perfect couple and they fell and that's been through the thousands of years he's molded again and and and here they are ready the Masterpiece was come and was struck down from his side come forth to help me and she brought up in the same process and here she is back again with the nature the Bible and everything else showing here we are Hallelujah can you say Amen am man now I I I want the Revelation I've been praying God let there be a revelation strike us like never before it's not important that you understand with this what's important is the Holy Spirit to baptize because if we ever get the life of the Holy Spirit right here h it'll live this right here we G no one had to teach Jesus on what he was going to be no amen he was that word and I say this last day bride amen when we say we're receiving the Holy Ghost I've heard people say well you know the man stood up amen and and there were hundreds and hundreds probably close to a thousand people there amen and the man the the man stood up a after another brother had been preaching on the Holy Ghost amen and and and and just really laboring and and and and the man stood up afterwards and he says how many how many believes this message amen yeah beles believes the prophet in this message so the whole congregation just raised their hands he says you've got the Holy Ghost case dismissed Hallelujah that that that's blaspheming it's not what you believe it's not what you have it's what you are here Devils believe and tremble amen that's the reason why that's the reason why this message has got so many denominations going because we got too many men without the Holy Ghost we got too many people that don't know about the life of God in them you ever get the same life you get that same anointing you get that same person of the Holy Ghost that came down in 1963 that Revelations 10 anointing it'll reveal the book to you buddy just exactly like the prophet brought it amen and you say amen that's where we are amen now brother Brandon would say now then the three stages comes the church out from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost let me read it again justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost him incarnate God made manifest Among Us amen another quote then the church came out of the Dark Ages justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word another quote justification made way for uh justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself amen hallelujah can you say amen amen amen I probably shouldn't have put that in my mouth praise the Lord what God is doing where God is going it's the season it's the time the anointing is here not an anointing but the person of the almighty God because he knows there's a person there's some young people that's going to want it more than ever he says why did God send it to you he says cuz he knew you would want it yeah as brother Josh was saying about predestination he knew you would want it he said it in this day because you were going to Crave for it you you you he said it in this day and allowed you to have this message because just a little bit of emotion wasn't going to do anything for you can you say am man you see the genuine baptism now you say now brother w What does it mean why wh what what I I just I just don't quite understand when you say the the the the the the the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it made way for the Holy Ghost itself you see the baptism amen you can you can speak in tongues you can have be baptized and have all of all of the nine spiritual gifts and not have the giver hallelujah it's the same holy ghost that Luther had but in a greater light but God's wanting the word itself the logos this ain't the word this is just representative of the word this was all written this had a time that this was produced this had a Time amen where where every Bible will every every Bible and every page will be gone it'll this is not Eternal this is this had a time that it was made it had a time that it's going to die it it's i' I've went through a couple of these B babies this is not Eternal but the this represents the Eternal one this book was not with God before the foundation of the world but that logos was with God before the foundation of the world the Loos The Living Word of God becoming flesh in this end time amen hallelujah hallelujah and when we listen to that message here tonight as the as we were listening to brother bradam Minister a little on the token and then ministering man we we heard him as as we as as he begin to discern the Holy Spirit begin to discern the hearts never never has there ever been the Holy Ghost going on earth like it been in this generation yes sir except for the days of the Lord Jesus Christ never has it ever fallen and rested so on a man like it done William Brandon and like it's doing in this bride you say no no I she under her Messenger will become the final voice to the final age Hallelujah no not quoting your quotes not reading your books but understanding your position your position in time he come to separate you so that you would know who you are and God would place you right can I tell you what the other one is amen he would say justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he says but you still got to be adopted right come on come on what is adoption it is the placing of the son over the inheritance right praise the Lord when we talk about the seal did you know that brother Bram when he preached the token I think he preached the token several times and he would Say Never And this ain't this ain't just a this ain't just a little mistake that he said because he said it a couple of times many times as he's preaching this message he is saying never could the token message ever be preached till this time and then he would start talking about the power of the Holy Ghost well when I first came out of Pentecost I'm thinking what do you mean that the token could never be preached because I thought the Holy Ghost was the Holy Ghost I looked at the Son of God as but then when you find out that the Holy Ghost is this yeah it's the same holy ghost in justification that brought the plan into sanctification that brought it into speaking in tongues but that's not what he's got in mind he wants a people where the word has total control of he wants a people that the word can live it through them he wants to speak in tongues through you he wants to work miracles through you he wants to be justified through you he wants to be Sanctified through you but he wants preeminence through you he wants preeminence come on Church well he wants a preeminence in this bride amen a placing where he can look at you well praise the Lord amen I I I I don't want a baptism I don't want an emotion I don't want a feeling I want a ceiling of the Holy Ghost the same ones that they had at the beginning Ephesians 1:3 and whom also you trusted after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise someone shout hallelujah which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchase possession unto the praise of his glory can you say Amen so when you receive the power of the Holy Ghost today you are not receiving amen you're not receiving it in its in its in in its in just a portion form the holy spirit is on Earth today to baptize you with the full fullness of the Holy Ghost because this is the fullness of the word with the full hallelujah oh my I I I you know I I wish I wish I could let all the Pentecostals know and the denominational know what you got is wonderful but there's something that'll give you a reality there's a reality in the word there's a reality in Christ I want this church to know that the realities of God are at your fingertips here tonight you can be so full of the power of the Holy Ghost that he will live his very life through youall can you say amen amen Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption 2 Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure or stand sure having this seal God knoweth them that are is and let everyone that nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity can you say amen he says the Pentecost represented Mary Mary the last stage of it she was not the seed yet the life of the seed was in her but it hadn't matured yet I feel religious it hadn't matured yet it was there but it wasn't matured so it is with our Pentecostal age that we're living in there's got to come forth a word of God do you catch that now this was in he he preached this a man and the seed is not air with the shook there's got to come forth a word of God Amen UND denominational outside of the rims of that denomination Luther went to the husk with his first word the just shall live by faith Wesley had two two words sanctification second definite work of Grace Pentecost had the third work the restoration of the gifts but the entire seed has to come forth see they've denied denominated on one word or another word or another word can you say Amen now what what where you going brother wend where you going I want to tell you that when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost today you're not receiving a portion like Luther a portion like Wesley a portion like ausa when you receive the Holy Ghost today that Revelations 10 could not happen until the seventh angel messenger was on Earth and ready to give that word that's right and when that anointing came it took now remember been bound Holy Ghost bound bound by denominational Rivers but it is to be released by the evening time message when the Holy SP Spirit comes down with an open book to that messenger sir he releases the Holy Spirit back into the church that's right yes Hallelujah don't let me sit in sit in this church and and and and and only expecting a little bit like the Pentecostals are getting the Holy Spirit has been released and if it's not working it's because denominational tears have crept back in true but the Holy Spirit doesn't go back the message is already here we got to get serious with this message and we got to cut loose all of our denominational thinking and the Holy Spirit Will flow and manifest through our hearts and our lives and our homes well praise the lord it's like I've talked about you know the games and and that internet this morning I mean that kind of stuff should be so Elementary should be so far gone that that kind of stuff should be right here in sanctification I mean we're talking about down here that that that's that's sanctification amen what that that that we're we're we're we're a couple we're we're Three Ages above it right yes sanctification that's that's where we say no that's worldly no that's pulling me away no that's causing me to to to wander from the Lord no that's not helping my family that's under Wesley's age if the eagle has come and Has Lifted us up then the anointing of the holy spirit is here through that message to make us to make us s higher oh godah can you say Amen now Hallelujah now are are you hearing me that's what the holy spirit is to do now I I want y'all to catch this because true justification could never come until there was a true word token until the true word came we lived under Dogma we my opinion was just as good as yours I your opinion was about like everybody else's and the good thing about denominations amen I get to keep my opinion and you can start your own denomination but you can't do that with this word you can't do that in this bride God sends a messenger and you must line yourself up with that word I don't have a choice you don't have a choice you've been favored by God and you stand upon the word of God praise the Lord can you say Amen Now consume me Lord because if we don't get through the first process praise the Lord if we don't know how to identify sin and we don't know how the holy or how the devil has worked through the church under cover all these years brother you're going to be fol cuz the prophet ain't here to discern you every time you turn around and tell you get back in line hey hey hey turn off your phone hey we're playing no get Prophet ain't here because then you would be relying upon the prophet to tell you everything what to do instead of the spirit of Truth here lining up with what he's already given you you don't have to have the prophet here Discerning everything he's done open that book to you now the Pentecostals have got enough Holy Ghost to feel good in church to shout in church but brother Bram says they had a dip it was a dip they were Justified Sanctified and then 1906 comes they're satisfied speaking in tongues and it was a wonderful work of Grace and it work for their time for me to sit around and say Luther didn't have anything that that'd be an idiot I'd be an idiot to say that Wesley didn't have anything come on I'd be an idiot to say 1906 didn't have anything but I'll be pretty wise to say there's a reason why Luther wasn't raptured it would be the spirit of wisdom to say there's a reason why Wesley wasn't raptured it would be the spirit of wisd wisdom to say h there's a reason reason that 1906 wasn't raptured hallelu come on now huh hallelujah amen and I want to say it's pretty wise for you and I to say don't let the lukewarmness of this age keep me from the life of God in my heart and keep me out of a Rapture don't let the lukewarmness of this age I'm not mad here tonight I I'm just preaching under I'm I I I I've got a burden and I I'm preaching hard amen I I I don't you sat here and claim to be a message and you're still living under a Pentecostal sensationalism thinking that you're going to make the Rapture because you play music thinking you're going to make a Rapture because you know you're you're the preacher son thinking you're going to make a Rapture because you know you you you've got all the message tapes that's all Pentecostalism denominationalism and I want the life the genuine life that has been released on this Earth through the opening of that book folks if you don't see if you don't see that Revelations 10 as the fullness of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the Holy Ghost himself the word coming of Christ then you're never going to buckle and say God fill me with that Holy Spirit that's right well glory to God Amen I should have stayed on my notes cuz these are a little bit nicer than what I'm feeling right now Hallelujah the holy ghost in the beginning was God God's stamp of reproval it was it was the seal until the day of redemption Luther didn't have that seal until the day of redemption no one's had that seal until the day of redemption until this evening time light oh come on now the dead of sin has been satisfied well glory to God the Deb of sin has been satisfied by both parties God and the believer sinner has met God's requirements of repentance accepting of the blood God has accepted the humble heart of faith in that blood and then God comes down and robes his son with the Holy Ghost yes sir brother bradam call it the robe of the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God when we talk about the Holy Ghost robe and every time brother brenon would talk about it he would go back to Elijah Elisha and he would say Elisha as Elijah's leaving he Elijah's going and he looks to Elisha and he says do you have a request he says yeah I want a double portion of what you got he did not say if I can just if I can just have a little bit of what you've got it'll suffice me if give me just a little bit of the anointing that Jesus had I want a double portion yeah of what you've got yeah right brother Brandon would say that is the church and Jesus now Elish Elijah would say if you see me when I leave keep your eyes on me now man keep your eyes upon the word you can have a double portion of my spirit well praise the Lord and while he was while he was preaching while he was while he was sharing these and they were following him man the Bible says that a chariot of fire swung down low and the prophet would dramatize it and say as the as the as The Chariot swung down and picked him up and carrying off him off to Heaven he says Elijah takes off his roope and Elisha has still got his eyes upon Elijah and he tosses he tosses the robe down to Elisha Elisha runs over he picks up the rope that Elisha War the prophet says he puts the Rob on that's right all right and he says he GS through the river are you hearing me amen and he starts talking to the river just like Elijah done I'm here with a double portion I'm here with a double anointing I'm here well praise the name of the Lord amen he took off his coat you're not going to have I'm going to tell you something right now when you get that coat on you you're no one's going to have to tell you amen you're not going to have to go around telling people I've got Elijah's coat I've got no the the authority of that coat is what you're wearing you don't have to go around saying you're a message believer the anointing of that message is upon you man it's a robe of authority how can you say amen amen well glory to God Amen he walk up there and he says may the god of Elijah open up that sea well can you say Amen am amen it's a robe of authority the Devils know it your friends know it the guys on the jobs know it amen the websites know it everyone knows it because you've got the same spirit that was in Christ dwelling in you and he said and if the spirit that dwell in Christ lives in you it will Quicken your mortal body therefore mortify by the Deeds of your flesh why because the anointing that was upon Christ is now in you and you have authority to overcome the enemy Hallelujah can you say amen amen hallelujah yes sir now Jesus says As he ascended oh I feel good about right now as Jesus ascended he dropped his robe he dropped the robe of the Holy Ghost he says I want you to keep your eyes on my promise I want you to go to Jerusalem I want you to stay there in Jerusalem don't you let anybody take away this promise Amen in John John 14 and2 he had already told him verely verily I say unto you he that believeth upon me from the heart the works that I do what is the works it's the display of the token life within him the works that he says if you don't believe me for my word sake believe me for my work sake he says the works that I do the works that display the father in me shall you do also and greater than these shall you do because I go to my father Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you Terry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high acts 1 and8 but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in Judea Samaria and un the uttermost parts of the earth Mark 16 now this the the these are after he's raised from the dead he said unto them go unto you mark 16: 15 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpant and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the robe that Christ war is now fitting pretty good on the bride fitting pretty good on his churchu come on it couldn't happen well praise the Lord now I'm giving you some visuals here because I want you to see what this was and what this this is God once again living in human beings this was God this was God on their flesh these were anointings this was the Holy Spirit intered this was the spirit of Christ making intercession this was God living in amen this is God living in amen am we're not amen living in men can you say Amen well Glory Jesus he's risen up from the dead or what what when they when he when he after he sins they're all gazing up and and and two angels appear to them and tell them men why gaze you up into heaven the same Jesus that went up that way on a cloud is going to descend on a cloud the same anointing that took him up is the same anointing that's going to come down now I can hear you say h no don't be looking at that cloud don't be looking at that cloud the same anointing that was in Jesus Christ came in a cloud in our generation amen this is not the physical return of Jesus Christ he will be returning but that will be the only sign of Christ that you ever see before the Millennium Hallelujah the next time you see Christ will be on Mount ol of it and you'd better be with him or or you're in the tribulation yes sir you'd better be a part of that Heavenly Host because then he's revealing himself to his brothers and he's showing the Jews look at mycars and all the eyes are going to be holy praise the Lord yes sir man praise the Lord now I I'm talking about a robe that amen I'm talking about in a day where you're if there's ever been a day that you can be totally washed from your sin it's this day in Pentecost I had to siphon through everything in order to put my faith in anything in pente cost one minute my preacher was preaching Faith the next minute he had me he had me in the tribulation one minute I was a friend the next minute I I didn't know one minute I I I felt like a preacher and then next I didn't know and then one minute you feel it was Pentecostalism it was it was emotionalism it was up and down ISM well come on it was wrong to have a TV in our house until he got one and then it was okay are are you hearing me yes goad we're we're talking about we're talking about not being able to put your faith in anything concrete the movement we was raised in my my my my pastor had didn't didn't believe in that so I'm thankful for that but the groups that we fellowshipped with said it was wrong to wear short sleeves I couldn't wear short please it was wrong to have a mustache I went to a meeting one time and I I had my hair in the middle and I was preached on there for having my hair in the middle my wife would love for me to just part my hair right now and let you know I've got a permanent part in the middle but I'm not doing that amen you see men's ideas men's interpretations how could you have a real Faith how could you line up with the word when the doctrines of men were being preached for the for the Commandments of God how can you have a faith for a rapture God's not interested in what your what I think about it God's not interested in what you think about it God says I'm going to send the book to the seventh angel Messenger on Earth and it will release the Holy Spirit back into the church why because once again faith can work unrestrictive what are you talking about brother I'm talking about I'm talking about we're in the we're we're we're we're I don't care whether you're Baptist Pentecostal message even a message believer amen but if you're not understanding if you're not if you're not giving Christ and giving this word you're everything then amen then then then you are you you're missing the point Hallelujah can you say amen hallelujah you're missing the point the Bible says there in says there in in in Isaiah 64 and6 amen it says we are all unclean a as an unclean thing and and all our righteousness or as filthy rags Zechariah I love this one here I love this one here Joshua was clothed with Zechariah 3 and3 filthy garments and stood before the angel and they answered and spake unto those that stood before him take away the filthy garments unto him behold I have caused th iniquity to pass from thee and I will clothe thee with a change of reignment now I I I I I'm want to type this here to the church we we've been dirty the church has been dirty we've we've had too much dogmas tied to us good people good men good women good Sons and Daughters of God but it's been in this day that the word has come the word that has been given to us in this day has said take away the filthy garments the filthy garments of traditionalism the filthy garments of denominationalism the filthy garments of opinions and I will clothe thee with the change of reignment are you hearing me what what what did he what what did he say I will cause thine iniquity to pass from thee you look there in re in Revelations where he says Behold The Marriage of the Lamb was come and to the bride was granted clean and white linen which is the righteousness of the Saints wh wh what am I saying you're not you're not there there in Ezekiel 36 and 25 it takes us it it it it it it get takes us through the three steps there in Ezekiel uh 3625 it talks about justification I will then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you will be clean from all your your filthiness and all of your Idols will I cleanse you 26 Here Comes sanctification and a new heart will I give you and a new spirit will I put in you and I will take away the ston heart out of your flesh and will give you a heart of Flesh brother brandham says see you couldn't even get along with yourself let alone with God so that through the process of sanctification he cleanses you man to where now you can accept his word you can look at his word amen but in the 27th verse he says and I will put my spirit within you and watch what happens it will cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them it's the word coming it's the logos in a body it is the Holy Spirit and the son of man living in his people well praise the Lord now I I I can I can hear you sa now brother Wendell I I don't know whether to shout or cry or smile or nod or I don't know what what I'm saying is God let do see the importance of what we've got don't you let this word just be intellectual this word is to make you it is to compel you it is to live its life through you justification I'm going to cleanse you I'm GNA I'm G to I'm GNA take away your your your sins sanctification I'm going to put a new spirit within you take away the Stony heart of rebellion now amen you'll be able to get along with yourself and get along with me amen you're going to see that hey there's some cleaning up I need to do amen maybe maybe there's some stuff here that I need to get serious you know maybe I should go to an altar occasionally I know brother brandham says we don't have to but man I my lack of an altar ain't helping me out any so when I hear that from brother brandham saying well you don't have to have an altar amen well you know brother brandham was right the altar ain't going to do it and you sitting on your Pew ain't going to do it come on the altar does nothing for you and you sitting there like a night on the log listening to the preacher service after service knowing you need the Holy Ghost ain't going to help you neither right knowing the Rapture is upon us knowing that you've still got this carnal sinful nature that is against God so what's the problem it ain't this and it ain't your Pew and it ain't the preacher and it ain't the prophet that's right it's your Stony heart there's a lot of quotes on it look it up it's the Stony heart that feels like I'm okay is the reason why we don't ball at an altar and asking God to forgive us and to take the desire of sin away some of us just go from one thing to the other to the other and we never learn God delivers us from one thing we'll go right back to the other and we'll always end up in the same sess pool we're not in we're not here we're here if the internet took you down before it'll take you down again get away from it holy ghost is preaching am we got to want this more than we want anything else the anointing of this word will bring Deliverance if it is accepted now what is that son of man and what is that eagle and bride time and the seed and adoption that's the time the church is placed that's the time that the sun is thinking like God thinks that's the time that the enemy is thinking he's not under justification anymore he's not under sanctification anymore he's not satisfied with a little bit of an emotion occasionally this man's got the adoption Rob on and what this man says he thinks just like his daddy or he would have never got it come on he this adoption robe he's going to kick stuff out of brother bradam says when you get the token you'll kick the TV out of your house and if he says you'll kick the TV out of your house when you get the token then that means you're going to kick the stupid phone out of your house amen oh you say well I got to have my phone yes you do I'd rather go back to the Stone Age and knowing that I'm not petting Spirits inside my home that is going to talize my children I'd rather go back living under a bridge than to have over all of this stuff of Leia and act like it doesn't matter you hypocrite that'll take this message here it day in and day out if you listen to it at all and then claim that you're living up here when dear Lord You're Still back in the fourth you're still back in the in the fourth and fifth age but these guys gave it willingly at least these guys were willing to die for what they believed in can you say Amen many are saying well I believe that we don't have to have emotion and so I'm glad you're preaching this message that is howdy everyone on the internet I'm not mad but I'm preaching I'm anointed I'm anointed amen that's the dumbest thing you can could ever say glad you preached against emotionalism because brother you're not doing away with anything the life that caus justification is the life that brought sanctification the life that brought sanctification is the life that made them speak in tongues and the life that makes them speak in tongues is the life that is maturing the bride today you're Justified you're Sanctified and you should be able to speak in tongues and prophesy and believe the nine spiritual gifts what it was here is what it is here but now we've adopted the ellite doctrine Theo Baptist Doctrine easy believism the campbellites believe that if he was baptized in Jesus name you're all okay where the Church of Christ comes from they don't well you better not speak in tongues Baptists believe that once you believe you've got the Holy Ghost that's the two doctrines that are prevailing in the message churches all I have to do is God send a prophet believe that God sent a prophet and I've got the Holy Ghost that's what the Baptist believe come on cites I got Justified I got baptized in Jesus name and Buddy you better not you speak in tongues in one of our churches we'll put you out what it's denominationalism I'm going to tell you the mo the the the critics are always going to mock that dead cold formal powerless icicle of a church is it going to stand for the power of God and the word will never live in them you're going to find all kinds of backbiting and you're going to find all kinds of fighting you're going to find all kinds of troubles because it's the Corinthian Church that knows nothing about their position in Christ someone say hallelujah hallelujah if our homes are full of backbiting we need a holy ghost baptism brother brandham says the invisible Union of the Bride this is a true picture of the modern church today neither does this modern Church want any of these here screaming and shouting tongu speaking acts 238 youngans around her she doesn't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah what now I I just heard brother Bram talk about in the token while ago brother W that that all of the shouting stuff just this emotional what are we going to do he's trying to get you to take all the work in the son of man age you're going to take it all yes and saying that you've got emotionalism is the sign of having the Holy Ghost is about as as is about as bad as someone sitting in a message Pew Bound by the devil and just as sober as you both ain't got a bit of the Holy Ghost because the devil has control of your life that's right good job brother wend he says why such a child would immediately be put out of her denomination they had one like that in one of their churches why they' throw her out right quick amen why you let such stuff that go on as this go along so you see she's pregnated with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want any of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her in her educated ethical societ scientific Society Church that she belongs to and they would throw her out at the next Council she can't have it she don't want to be pregnated with the word because that is the only kind that the word can bring forth born of the spirit of God it has the spirit of God in it no intellectual Church joining creedo bobbed haired painted face there is no such a thing in it at all you don't find that in the word of God you find an oldfashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost filled child born of the spirit of God screaming hollering shouting and praising God can I hear an amen it will produce the works of Christ but the shouting can be manufactured the jumping can be manufactured speaking in tongues can be manufactured prophecy can be manufactured but we're living appear here with the son of man where he is to take full control and if he takes full control you're going to be acting like a mad man too I'm sure but when it's all said and done it's because there's something that is burning deep down in that Soul we don't all shout we don't all scream we don't all do it but I guarantee you that's the way they done it in the book of Acts they all came Mary had Mary had I know she she conceived without sensation but she came out of that upper room out the windows drunker than all get out speaking in other tongues so your Prophet said in many occasions praise the Lord am I doing all right token the token life of the son of man where the Holy Spirit has control of Our Lives now why would let me just stop right here why would any of us stop short of what is already on the earth for you to possess today why would any of us that no time in the last 2,000 years has the Holy Ghost been here in such a reality like this generation now do you want to know why when the real thing is setting before you hallelujah hallelujah I don't know amen I I need eron come here let me let me talk and everything eternal life everything everything everything that Adam has lost is now wide open the book has been closed has been sealed we didn't know but this this is the age this is the time that God has been talking about all through Bible that we're going to rule and Reign on this earth and the power of the Holy Ghost is going to be on us and our sons and our daughters are going to prophesy that's what he said in joy in the restoration that our sons and daughters are going to prophesy our old men are going to dream dreams our young men are going to see visions and it's going to be real it's all right here it's all put here and it's all in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he has set it down it's yours Hallelujah I need to borrow some I don't know just I need I need I need a I need a couple of cell phones I'm not looking at at them Hallelujah you need

you got that amen what else do we have what else can I and we got huh so we got oh my and you got all of this right here now this is the time when the sons of God are going back to Perfection with authority the devil knows it you say well well I don't I don't really believe that then if the devil doesn't know that why did he work all through here why why why why why are we here in this leot to see a poor Pale Horse Rider age the devil knows what happened in the Garden of Eden he knew that his trick worked he knew that the Holy Ghost was up the church at the in night in at the day of Pentecost and he has worked worked worked worked he knows he can see what Luther done to him what Wesley done to him what 1906 done done to him he knows what William Bram done to him on come on why is

ugly NOP mine's got spit on it Hallelujah do I have any friends in the [Applause] building the son of man the son of man I could go through I could go through this through this son of man over and over it's the word having preeminence in his church he couldn't do it in the Dark Ages he couldn't do it in Luther he couldn't do it in Wesley he couldn't do it in 1906 but he's got a people here on the earth that he is going to do it through well I wish you had Shout with me because what I'm preaching is really good hallelujah amen what has happened in this last day I'm I'm closing thanks for your attention tonight in this day to receive the Holy Spirit it it means that all the Lans all the leans that have been held against this church has been struck off every time a man would come up with his own opinion and attach it to the church it was another lean on it it was another lean saying you can't have it to have a lean on your property is is is is legal term you can own your house but if there's a tax lean against your property they can sell the house right out from underneath you and you you you own the house outright and they can sell your house out from underneath you because they've got a tax lean against you and what happened is Satan was attaching leans all through these all through these ages he's been attached in the leans man's opinion man's opinion man's opinion man's opinion it's been nothing but man's opinion there's all kinds of leans there's no way that we could live an overcoming life because we were under the Dominion of sin the word had no authority over us some of us will stand there and say ah I ain't going to come under no man Hallelujah and you're the biggest Pharisee there is you're the one that's holding to your opinions I'm not I'm just preaching here tonight I don't know who I'm preaching to but I'm preaching to somebody all right this ain't on my notes my abstract is I'm I want to read that to you but I had a few of these quotes scriptures Satan's had these leans he's had these Lings on us and that's the reason why that's the reason why we never could rise above it it's the reason why we go in circles that's the reason why we get victory for a while and then we come back around to the same old deal and we find out that we're just doing the death walk we find out that we are the Samson that's just going around in circles treading at the at the at the Mill of the Philistines we're just going in circles but the token life of the holy spirit in this day is God's abstract it's God sending the abstract to each one of us saying that all of the leans have been stricken off everything that Satan has held against us well Mama believe well Dad well but grandma said well but I I it's been struck off and the Holy Spirit runs the abstract the title opinion and he goes the abstract to the title and he goes and he searches it and see if there's any leans I don't care if there was a lean that was put on the house way way back there in great grandma's house or or whatever any kind of a lean and they and and and and and they go back and they do the title search and they and they go all the way back the Holy Ghost comes in and begins to deal with you and say all right you've got you a lean right here go take my blood you got enough there take care of it you've got an area right here they got to lean on you you can't you need to take care of it you run back to the Altar and you take the blood of Calvary and you wash all that worm and you wash and sanctify me holy spirit's he's he's teaching you and then finally he says the abstract is clean I'm going to fill you with the Holy Ghost I'm going to fill you with the holy spirit that is God's abstract to the title once that seal has been signed that means there is nothing held against you that that when you receive the Holy Ghost let me just let me just and I'm closing amen but let me just read this to you he says God gave Abraham a promise Abraham believed God it was imputed unto him for righteousness but he sealed the Covenant by the Seal of circumcision God gives you a promise potentially that you'll receive it you're going to be raised up this body's going to be glorified with him at the end time but you see you have to have a clearance on that deed the clearance is when everything against it has been stricken off you've got the abstract to it you've got the seal it's yours everything on it belongs to you and when we believe on Jesus Christ to be our savior and repent and are baptized and come up to believe him God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sends down the abstract the abstract is the Assurance it's the guarantee that everything that was ever held against you you thoroughly repented of Hallelujah the property is bought you hold the abstract for the Assurance let nobody try to put you off a land and say it doesn't belong to you with the abstract in your hand let him try to no law in the land can do it because you hold the abstract there's no devil there's no church or any theology that can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and Abstract that the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized us in Christ Jesus this token life it's the seal every one of you that hop that token life that hold the holy ghost in your in your possession it's your guarantee to the resurrection it's your guarantee that if this body goes in the grave you're coming back out it's the guarantee I would encourage everyone I know we're looking at the church ages and I and I want us to continue to doing that but I would also like for you to listen to this message Easter seal and brother bradam Deals Deals with it for two and a half hours it's powerful powerful what that token does for the believer it quickens you love him tonight for those of us that have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say can I have the Holy Ghost and lose my first love yeah you can come back to your first love is it true that I can sit in a message church and act like I've got the Holy Ghost when I really don't have the power of God to overcome yep yep can both parties those that have the Holy Ghost Out have allowed junk in their life while the Holy Ghost has been sitting there telling you the whole time the Holy Ghost is there saying don't do that you shouldn't do that don't don't do that or the guy that doesn't have the Holy Ghost doesn't have he just he just he's just oblivious to anything he's just oblivious he's just oblivious he's just in life just going through life and he ain't got nothing correct in him he's just one thing after another and can't can't can't understand that there's devils in every one just he's just he needs the Holy Ghost for both of us I think that would include all of us those that need it and those of us that need a refilling there's plenty of blood and the mighty Angel is still here if you want it there's blood if you want the abstract the guaranteed to the resurrection it's here can you say Amen will you forgive me for keeping you so long I'm here with a burden tonight what can I do to give it get get the Holy Ghost brother wend you can get the Holy Ghost right now right there where you're sitting but most of the time it's got It's got to require sanctification that Stony heart being taken out and that new spirit that's wanting it there's where our problem is we go from justification and we wonder why we can't get the Holy Ghost is because we ain't got the the Second Step taken care of we have no desire we have no desire to overcome we have no desire so God has to take out the Stony heart put in a heart of Flesh so that you can receive his Spirit you got to want it it's got to be more important to you than than belonging to anything it's got to be real can you sayen musicians you can come if the holy spirit's dealing with you and you're one of those musicians up here that needs to be at an altar don't go if there's if there's anyone that's that that that should that that should be at an altar nothing I'm using them as an as an illustration but I I nothing no position in the church should keep us out of our position as the bride

Rel de there in deep cont [Music] H my un [Music] be I'm crying [Music] say you save [Music] won't you hear my arble C why [Music] a [Music] do not [Music] pass it's a scary thing to not feel the Holy Spirit tugging at your heart it's a scary thing to [Music] not when the spirit of the Lord moves like he has [Music] and these last few Services as we have been going through some of these things and if our hearts haven't been touched [Music] brother Brandon said in communion gave a [Music] very very Bleak assessment and those that feel like you're just content with where you are and that you I I I want you to really listen to this quote here I says the of hunger listen it's a great cry because it's a distressful cry when you're hungry you're you're screaming out I got to have something from the Lord cuz I'm lacking it I I'm hungry he says the person is dying he says oh if we could get to that place if this nation could get to a place to Where It's So Hunger for God it's in a worse starvation than the Nations like India that's starving physically this nation is starving spiritually but after you hunger so long it gets to the place that you don't know you're hungry just like freezing you after you get so far freezing and you get so cold then after a while you become warm and when you do you're dying that's what's the matter tonight churches have got so cold until they're freezing they think they're warm by membership and are dying spiritually dying don't know it finally he lays down to sleep and that's all of it he never wakes up no more because his blood is froze in his veins [Music] that's a that's a that's a pretty bleak picture if I was a young [Music] man and I don't have the Holy Ghost and I don't have that burning down in my heart I I I think I'd be going I'd be going home and busting up everything thing that's that's that's that's taking that desire away from me used to be would take would take the televisions out and shoot it with a shotgun or would the girls would take their dresses sister Carol you remember those pants burning parties and tight clothes burning parties we've had that's right holy spirit would get so convict them convict the hearts and I remember one time out here I think we met out at the lake we brought records there were records and CDs and pants that girls had hid and bunch of top clothes they said we're not going to keep them around to give them to somebody else where this this has been a trap for me and I'm not and we had a we had a part I'm talking about a burning party you remember that [Music] CA it meant something to us we wanted to get rid of junk I think back in those days it was records and CDs and cassettes and DVDs hard to burn these phones that aren't they hard to they're valuable can't do that can't get rid of those [Music] things and you need the Holy Ghost I I'm talking about a holy ghost that'll be there that'll put that we can put on these Electronics of ours you see what I'm saying yes sir used to be we could take them out smash them get rid of them lock the door in our house and okay we ain't got none of that junk back in here not [Music] today let's be serious about this something is taking the place of our hunger yes and if you young people are satisfied with your experience and all of the old guys are at the altar when it's you young people that need the Holy Ghost yes sir [Music] these guys have been coming up to the Altar for [Music] years I'm saying where's the drive where's the fire in this next Generation do we not want any more of God could I do I have to preach it out and do we I do I have to just go down the aisle and start pointing out sin but we'll go to a youth camp as long as we got other people man we'll skip the stupid Youth Camp extract that from the record the Blessed Youth Camp what kind of a holy ghost do we have are we only getting the holy ghost at youth camps and we're not getting the holy GH ghost in a personal relationship with God and a and a and a and a cry in our heart for more of God that ain't the Holy Ghost I got sir when these kind of messages were being preached my mom would tell you I was down to I I I I lived at the church until I got the baptism of the Holy [Music] Ghost my mom felt so sorry for me she'd bring all all the ladies of the church trying take me down to the church we' I'd be I I I don't know the mighty Angel's here if we want him but I promise you you're going to have to start getting hungry for him he said I don't have to come to an altar dear lord your attitudes when the word's been preached preached and when the anointing is here you don't even know how to even respond when the anointing is here there is a response when the when the anointing is here you know when the anointing is here
