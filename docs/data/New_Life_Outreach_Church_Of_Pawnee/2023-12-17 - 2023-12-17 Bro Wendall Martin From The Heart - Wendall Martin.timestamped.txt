[55:44] unbelief and Hardness of Heart because
[55:46] they believed not them which had seen

[56:23] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[56:26] shall recover let's go to the Lord in
[56:29] prayer father we want to thank you for

[56:33] morning the wonderful songs that have
[56:36] been sung Lord the the specials that
[56:40] have been sung today Lord we thank you
[56:44] we thank you for your grace and your
[56:46] your goodness because it's not by it's
[56:50] not by power and it's not by might but
[56:53] it's by that Supernatural presence of
[56:55] the spirit of God upon the heart and we
[56:59] love you Lord father I I ask that you
[57:02] would see those that aren't here today
[57:05] and that you would touch Lord and be
[57:08] with brother Mitch Lord as he's
[57:11] recovering with his hand and and Lord
[57:14] give him a speedy
[57:16] recovery be with brother Lord uh Martin
[57:19] as he is as he is weak and and Lord I
[57:23] visited him last night and Lord just not
[57:26] just just weak in his body father oh God
[57:30] we still are looking to that blood
[57:33] Covenant that you have made Lord Lord uh
[57:36] we we just ask that you would see our
[57:39] our our brother uh Watkins Lord and our
[57:42] brother Barry and I I'm asking Lord that
[57:45] you would heal them Lord and Let Your
[57:48] Presence be with them and let the
[57:50] anointing of God be upon them oh God
[57:55] you're our healer and we look to you
[57:57] father just ask that you would speak to
[57:59] us this morning help our hearts Lord to
[58:02] just be in tune with you and we'll give
[58:05] you glory and honor in the name of the
[58:07] Lord Jesus Christ and can the church say
[58:10] amen amen and amen God bless you you may
[58:14] be seated here this
[58:18] morning I uh want to just take a title
[58:23] from the heart and this is going to just
[58:28] just be uh pretty simple here this
[58:31] morning as we as we deal with faith and
[58:36] believing from the heart and we we could
[58:42] see he that
[58:43] believeth shall be saved and he that
[58:47] believeth not shall be damned that's
[58:51] pretty simple amen and and so if you
[58:55] have forsaken the way of life if you
[58:58] have
[58:59] forsaken What God gives you amen uh then
[59:04] there that you you have no blessings of
[59:07] God upon you brother brandom says it is
[59:09] the revelation of
[59:11] God that will give you authority over
[59:14] the devil and you can see why they he
[59:17] would add or take from it would be
[59:21] cursed it would have to be so for who
[59:24] can add or take away from the perfect
[59:26] revelation of God and overcome the enemy
[59:29] it is that simple there is nothing of
[59:32] such prevailing power as the revelation
[59:36] of the word amen see in verse three it
[59:39] says uh blessing is pronounced on those
[59:42] that give special attention to this book
[59:45] I think it refers to the Old Testament
[59:47] custom of the priest reading the book to
[59:49] the congregation in the morning and you
[59:50] see uh many could not read so the priest
[59:53] had to read it to them as long as it was
[59:55] the word the blessings was theirs it
[59:58] didn't matter if it was read or if it
[1:00:00] was heard the blessing is to those that
[1:00:05] believe amen can you say Amen now
[1:00:08] brother Bram would say the first thing
[1:00:11] before we can have faith we've got to
[1:00:15] have some foundation for Faith there has
[1:00:19] got to be something behind it so so in
[1:00:23] order to have Faith there's got to be a
[1:00:27] reality for Faith to rest upon amen now
[1:00:32] now Santa Claus you can put Faith in
[1:00:33] Santa Claus but there but that's a myth
[1:00:36] amen uh uh the scripture says that the
[1:00:40] all all of these religions amen uh
[1:00:43] arrive or derrive out of the bottomless
[1:00:46] pit Amen in other words there's no
[1:00:49] foundation for their faith to rest upon
[1:00:53] amen amen so the believer has something
[1:00:57] to rest our faith upon it's it's not
[1:01:02] we're just not putting it in nowhere
[1:01:05] amen faith has a
[1:01:07] foundation and that is God's word amen
[1:01:11] there is the foundation of Faith amen
[1:01:14] matters of fact brother brother Brandon
[1:01:16] would titled that sermon the fundamental
[1:01:18] foundation for Faith so faith has got to
[1:01:22] have something to rest upon amen now you
[1:01:25] can believe in Santa and that's you know
[1:01:27] I I Satan has a way of of of just uh
[1:01:32] coming in and and and trying to so
[1:01:34] intermingle his junk so that our faith
[1:01:37] just doesn't have anything amen you you
[1:01:40] you you look at Santa Claus and oh my
[1:01:42] Santa Claus associated with Christmas
[1:01:43] and then before you know it you are you
[1:01:45] you you you find out that Santa Claus is
[1:01:47] not real you they've got the Easter
[1:01:49] bunnies and and the and the egg hunts
[1:01:51] and all of this on Easter amen and
[1:01:53] before you know what you find out man
[1:01:55] that's not even real you you you you you
[1:01:57] have the tooth fairy and then you find
[1:01:59] out that it's not even real and and so
[1:02:02] we associate that kind of nonsense with
[1:02:04] with
[1:02:05] Christianity amen and Christianity is
[1:02:08] not a myth right Christianity has
[1:02:10] nothing to do with Santa Claus
[1:02:13] Christianity has nothing to do with with
[1:02:15] with with Easter Bunnies
[1:02:18] Christianity is faith in the finished
[1:02:21] work of Jesus Christ
[1:02:25] can you say Amen so this is not an
[1:02:27] imaginary faith and our heart must have
[1:02:32] something that we can believe in now now
[1:02:35] you can do it with your mind you there's
[1:02:37] too many times that that we try to
[1:02:40] accept the word of God with our mind and
[1:02:43] you cannot accept god with his with your
[1:02:45] mind you cannot believe God with your
[1:02:47] mind it always reasons with the thing
[1:02:51] and will always talk you out of the
[1:02:53] supernatural right amen that's true so
[1:02:57] so Faith's Foundation is upon God's
[1:03:00] infallible word if you were to look
[1:03:01] there in Hebrews if you put that up
[1:03:03] Hebrews 11 And1 amen faith is the
[1:03:08] substance of things hoped for the
[1:03:11] evidence of not of Things Not Seen for
[1:03:14] by it the elders obtained a good report
[1:03:17] and we know through faith we understand
[1:03:20] that the worlds were framed by the word
[1:03:23] of God God so that the things which are
[1:03:26] seen were made of things which do not
[1:03:30] appear in other words they had to be a
[1:03:35] foundation Hallelujah you know the world
[1:03:38] it it it doesn't you amen it's just it's
[1:03:40] just rolling in air it's just hanging in
[1:03:42] space all by itself amen but it's upheld
[1:03:45] by the word of God and God believing his
[1:03:47] own word and so the believer amen God
[1:03:50] doesn't want you believing with your
[1:03:52] mind God wants you believing with your
[1:03:53] heart God God doesn't want you believing
[1:03:55] with your emotion God wants you
[1:03:56] believing with your heart God doesn't
[1:03:58] want you Amen to accept things amen as
[1:04:01] they come God wants you to be forever
[1:04:04] settled in your heart upon thus saith
[1:04:08] the Lord and then you can Prevail in
[1:04:11] your darkest of hours then you can
[1:04:12] Prevail in the bottom of the sea then
[1:04:15] you can Prevail Amen in the Lion's dead
[1:04:17] then you can Prevail in in in the fiery
[1:04:19] furnace it does not matter then because
[1:04:23] faith has found its resting place upon
[1:04:26] the infallible
[1:04:29] unchangeable word of God and you're
[1:04:32] resting
[1:04:34] there amen now amen we understand only
[1:04:38] from the
[1:04:39] heart can you can you believe there in
[1:04:42] Romans 10 and 6 it says but the
[1:04:45] righteousness which is of faith speaketh
[1:04:48] on this why saying or say not in your
[1:04:52] heart who shall Ascend into heaven
[1:04:54] that is to bring Christ down from above
[1:04:57] who shall descend into the deep that is
[1:04:58] to bring Christ up from the dead what
[1:05:01] saith it the word is n thee even in thy
[1:05:04] mouth and in thine heart that is the
[1:05:07] word of faith which we preach now want
[1:05:10] you to understand notice this that if
[1:05:12] Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[1:05:14] Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine
[1:05:17] heart that God ha raised him from the
[1:05:20] dead Thou shalt be saved for with the
[1:05:23] heart man believes under righteousness
[1:05:26] and with the mouth confession is made
[1:05:30] under salvation for the scripture sayith
[1:05:33] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[1:05:39] ashamed Hallelujah shall never be
[1:05:42] ashamed so it's got to be amen too many
[1:05:45] times we know that it faith our our our
[1:05:49] our our belief system is built upon the
[1:05:53] spirit man which is the mind and the
[1:05:55] reasoning and things because that's the
[1:05:57] way our mouth
[1:05:59] talks amen but with the heart man
[1:06:02] believeth and from the abundance of the
[1:06:06] heart the mouth
[1:06:08] speaketh Hallelujah so you get this you
[1:06:11] see this is where the heart amen I
[1:06:15] believe it was there in the book of of
[1:06:17] proverbs 4 and 20 he says my son attend
[1:06:21] to my words inclin
[1:06:24] thine ear unto my sayings let them not
[1:06:27] depart from Thine Eyes keep them in the
[1:06:29] midst of thine heart for they are life
[1:06:32] unto those that find them and health to
[1:06:35] all their flesh so so he's so he's
[1:06:37] telling him now this word is health and
[1:06:41] it's
[1:06:43] life I want you to keep these words in
[1:06:47] your heart but now watch it says keep
[1:06:50] thy heart with all diligence
[1:06:54] for out of it are the issues of life so
[1:06:59] the the the the
[1:07:02] emphasis is turning from hear my words
[1:07:06] attend to my sayings amen keep my
[1:07:09] Commandments and now it's telling you
[1:07:12] guard that heart because only through
[1:07:16] your faith in my
[1:07:19] words will it bring Health to you amen
[1:07:24] now I think this is in important because
[1:07:30] we don't believe here we believe right
[1:07:33] here amen now the world's going to fall
[1:07:36] the world is going to shake listen folks
[1:07:38] if we need a foundation we need that
[1:07:40] Foundation
[1:07:41] today we wake up in Good Moods wake up
[1:07:44] in bad moods some of us wake up in good
[1:07:46] moods and end up in bad moods amen it it
[1:07:48] it it just it this this old flesh amen
[1:07:52] is so tipsy tosy can you say amen amen
[1:07:56] and if you allow your faith and and and
[1:07:59] your your belief system to go up and
[1:08:01] down with that well you're never going
[1:08:04] to conquer anything you're never going
[1:08:05] to overcome anything last week we
[1:08:07] talking about overcoming amen the Holy
[1:08:09] Ghost is in you to overcome through you
[1:08:13] amen this is not a myth this is not
[1:08:15] something that amen that that a preacher
[1:08:17] just gets up makes you pumps you up and
[1:08:19] makes you feel good this is the
[1:08:21] realities of the word of God when placed
[1:08:24] in your heart with faith it'll produce
[1:08:27] everything that God
[1:08:29] said can you say amen amen now Hebrews
[1:08:34] 11 and6 but without faith it is
[1:08:39] impossible to please him for he that
[1:08:43] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:08:46] that he's not a myth that he's not a
[1:08:48] totem pole amen that he's not a an idol
[1:08:52] somewhere you you've got to believe that
[1:08:55] he truly is he's a living
[1:08:59] being there is a heaven and there is a
[1:09:02] Jesus setting In Heaven There is a
[1:09:04] reality to the things of God come on
[1:09:07] church amen we've got we we've got folks
[1:09:10] you know that has totally taken Jesus
[1:09:12] off the throne in the message amen
[1:09:14] saying you know you know saying that uh
[1:09:16] you know he's not on the throne and The
[1:09:18] Mercy Seat and all the that's just a
[1:09:20] bunch of baloney folks amen we've got to
[1:09:22] come to the reality we've got to accept
[1:09:25] God's
[1:09:26] word believe God's word in order to have
[1:09:31] the results how many wants results in
[1:09:34] your walk with
[1:09:35] God I I believe you do I know I want to
[1:09:38] I I want to see but he says you've got
[1:09:40] to believe that he is and that he is a
[1:09:44] rewarder of them who diligently seek
[1:09:47] him why do we come to church day in and
[1:09:51] day out sick or not sick or up or down
[1:09:54] whether we feel good hallelujah how many
[1:09:57] how many feels like coming to church
[1:09:58] every time you come to
[1:10:00] church we're not coming to church
[1:10:02] because we feel like coming to church we
[1:10:04] don't come early amen just because we
[1:10:07] feel like it we come early because the
[1:10:08] prophet said we should come early and
[1:10:11] that we should spend time in prayer why
[1:10:13] he says you need to prepare your heart
[1:10:16] for the service that is to
[1:10:19] come but if it's just a duty to you
[1:10:22] you're going to show up a 5 minutes
[1:10:23] after every time Hallelujah and you're
[1:10:25] going to say preacher love it or lump it
[1:10:28] Hallelujah see it's but it does not mean
[1:10:30] anything to the preacher the pre it
[1:10:33] don't matter to the preach you can live
[1:10:34] an overcoming life if you
[1:10:37] want and you can choose not to live an
[1:10:40] overcoming life you've got to take the
[1:10:42] things of God from the depths of the
[1:10:47] heart and if you know that he is and you
[1:10:51] know that he sent his Prophet then then
[1:10:53] you are willing to follow the guideline
[1:10:57] that God said would
[1:11:00] work and those who diligently seek Him
[1:11:04] will find him well glory to God don't
[1:11:07] you love him now so that heart that
[1:11:11] heart why why would the scripture say
[1:11:14] that you've got to keep that Heart Guard
[1:11:16] that heart is that not what we just read
[1:11:19] amen there there back back up to uh uh
[1:11:22] uh proverbs 4 amen was that the third
[1:11:26] chapter or was the 23rd chapter what was
[1:11:28] that where it says guard your heart
[1:11:32] guard your heart be diligent upon that
[1:11:35] heart why why why should you guard that
[1:11:38] heart amen keep the heart with all
[1:11:42] diligence because out of the heart not
[1:11:44] the mind out of the
[1:11:46] heart is where the issues of Life are
[1:11:49] going to come now the scripture says
[1:11:51] that the what that the heart amen can
[1:11:54] either be it can be the most deceitful
[1:11:57] thing Hallelujah so
[1:12:00] only only through guarding that heart
[1:12:05] placing the blood around that heart
[1:12:08] keeping that heart pure before God well
[1:12:11] praise the
[1:12:12] Lorden there was another warning there
[1:12:14] in Hebrews 3 and12 says take heed
[1:12:18] Brethren lest there be any of you okay
[1:12:24] an evil
[1:12:26] heart of
[1:12:29] unbelief and depart
[1:12:33] from
[1:12:35] what l i v i n g the Living God now you
[1:12:43] can have it here and not have a living
[1:12:46] God hallelujah you can have all the dos
[1:12:49] and the don'ts and the ins and the outs
[1:12:50] and the ups and you can have it all down
[1:12:52] in your little suitcase and and in your
[1:12:54] little belief system all put away right
[1:12:56] here in the in the mind but only from
[1:12:59] the heart can you bring out the
[1:13:02] realities of the supernatural this mind
[1:13:06] is enmity against God it will never know
[1:13:09] God it will never believe God it will
[1:13:11] only reason God we are not here to
[1:13:15] reason with God we are here to walk with
[1:13:21] God and that can only come from the
[1:13:26] heart can you say Amen so so you your
[1:13:30] heart can be full of life and your heart
[1:13:34] can be full of
[1:13:38] death all the while
[1:13:41] sitting in this
[1:13:45] church can you say Amen listening to the
[1:13:48] same preacher Amen in the same quotes
[1:13:52] amen and and we don't want to do it from
[1:13:54] here we want to do it from here God does
[1:13:58] go God doesn't work through psychology
[1:14:00] God works amen through through a faith a
[1:14:03] heart of faith I told you it's going to
[1:14:05] be simple this morning but it's from the
[1:14:07] heart from the heart somebody says from
[1:14:10] the heart out of the abundance of the
[1:14:13] heart there's where God is looking at
[1:14:16] God came in and touched not the mind not
[1:14:19] the body but God redeemed the soul to
[1:14:22] himself
[1:14:23] and it's with that Soul or with that
[1:14:26] heart that he is going to communicate
[1:14:28] with you and move in the Supernatural
[1:14:30] Rim through you it's only through that
[1:14:33] which has been redeemed
[1:14:36] right that's right your body's not been
[1:14:38] fully redeemed yet no your spirit man's
[1:14:41] not been fully redeemed yet but that's
[1:14:43] okay as long as you've got God in that
[1:14:46] heart in that soul and you can believe
[1:14:49] there is nothing impossible to him him
[1:14:53] that
[1:14:56] believes I don't care what the doctor
[1:14:58] says I don't care what mama says I don't
[1:15:00] care what anyone else says as long as
[1:15:03] thy heart can see God's word and believe
[1:15:08] it it is
[1:15:13] yours man now we got to get that in our
[1:15:15] heart brother brandom says I'd like to
[1:15:18] draw your attention to the word of the
[1:15:19] Lord this morning for just a while I
[1:15:22] want you to pay the utmost attention to
[1:15:24] it listen closely the value of this word
[1:15:29] after 25 years of Ministry for the Lord
[1:15:32] in his work and in his word after being
[1:15:35] coming into my 12th year of
[1:15:37] international evangelism by the grace of
[1:15:39] God to meeting tens of thousands of
[1:15:42] people and seeing our Lord in all in our
[1:15:45] own campaigns now I have seen him or
[1:15:49] I've seen to him right in towards two
[1:15:52] million or million
[1:15:54] 500,000 somewhere along in there in the
[1:15:56] meeting uh sing them to the Lord I've
[1:15:59] come to this
[1:16:01] conclusion of all of our efforts and so
[1:16:04] forth it is
[1:16:06] impossible for God to do anything for
[1:16:10] the people until the people first get
[1:16:14] settled on whether it's truth or
[1:16:18] not oh ah that's coming from a prophet
[1:16:21] he says now now with all of Supernatural
[1:16:24] with all the Visions with all of the
[1:16:26] things that I've done I I I I i' I've
[1:16:28] been I've been doing this for 25 years
[1:16:30] this is 12th year in in in in the
[1:16:33] international
[1:16:34] evangelism and out of everything that
[1:16:36] has been
[1:16:37] done I have found that it is impossible
[1:16:40] for God to do
[1:16:43] anything until the people get it settled
[1:16:47] whether it's
[1:16:48] truth or not you're never going to get
[1:16:51] it settled here so don't ever try that
[1:16:52] don't don't even try that but that's
[1:16:54] something that God gave you at that new
[1:16:56] birth buddy you can put that in the bank
[1:16:59] and you'll work he'll work miracles with
[1:17:02] that he'll work miracles with that he
[1:17:05] will do the impossible in and through
[1:17:09] you if you will open that heart up to
[1:17:12] him well glory to God I said glory to
[1:17:16] God it don't matter whether you're a
[1:17:18] teenager whether you're old whether it
[1:17:21] does not matter if you can believe it
[1:17:25] there is no telling what God can do M
[1:17:27] Jesus said that in Mark 11:22 he said
[1:17:30] Jesus answering sayth unto them have
[1:17:32] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[1:17:34] that whosoever shall say it to this
[1:17:37] mountain be removed and be thou cast
[1:17:39] into the sea and and now now here he's
[1:17:42] now he's given the two opposites and not
[1:17:44] doubt in his heart but shall be he says
[1:17:48] now there's going to be the opportunity
[1:17:50] for doubt and there's going to be the
[1:17:52] opportunity for Faith right but if you
[1:17:55] doubt not in his heart but shall believe
[1:17:59] that those things which he says shall
[1:18:00] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:18:02] said therefore I say unto you whatsoever
[1:18:05] things you desire When you pray
[1:18:08] what when you pray what believe believe
[1:18:13] that you receive them and you shall have
[1:18:16] them oh that heart is
[1:18:18] precious that heart is the most
[1:18:20] important thing you can have can you
[1:18:23] amen amen I I I believe in healing I
[1:18:27] believe in miracles I believe I believe
[1:18:31] that when God when God saved my soul
[1:18:34] that I have a right to believe God for
[1:18:38] healing in my
[1:18:41] body well the prophet said healing is
[1:18:44] the children's
[1:18:46] breath the doctors might say that it's
[1:18:49] incurable the doctors might say Amen
[1:18:52] that you don't that that you that that
[1:18:54] that that you've got to go down amen but
[1:18:57] that's not what What We believe We
[1:19:00] Believe What God
[1:19:03] Says amen
[1:19:05] hallelujah now if we could ever get it
[1:19:07] settled that the same God that saved my
[1:19:10] soul is the same God that can heal my
[1:19:15] body if we could ever get it in our
[1:19:18] heart that the only reason sickness came
[1:19:22] and death has come is because sin came
[1:19:26] into the soul right that's right so when
[1:19:29] you deal with the
[1:19:31] soul the spirit you have the authority
[1:19:34] to bring that Spirit man and that body
[1:19:38] under your control through faith in
[1:19:40] God's
[1:19:42] word hallelujah now you got to get it
[1:19:45] settled well brother when I I believe
[1:19:47] God can heal but I I just don't know if
[1:19:49] he if he really wants to do it I'm going
[1:19:51] to tell you right now God is wanting to
[1:19:52] heal you you more than you want to be
[1:19:54] healed God's wanting to bring this about
[1:19:57] can you say Amen brother Brandon would
[1:19:59] say of course any Christian believes
[1:20:02] that that's heard there' be a
[1:20:03] resurrection but if there's no
[1:20:05] attributes of the Resurrection if
[1:20:08] there's no Earnest of the Resurrection
[1:20:11] then there is no
[1:20:13] Resurrection now now God says he's given
[1:20:16] Supernatural proof If there's no Divine
[1:20:20] Healing then there's no Resurrection
[1:20:23] now you couldn't disprove that I I if uh
[1:20:26] if you could by Bible see I'm arguing
[1:20:29] the points of Christ see because we have
[1:20:33] the earnest of our Salvation which is
[1:20:36] the baptism of the holy spirit is that
[1:20:39] right that's the down payment that's the
[1:20:43] earnest which holds it secure in heaven
[1:20:46] for us and then if there is no Divine
[1:20:49] Healing to make a cancer written body
[1:20:51] come to normal and well again then there
[1:20:54] is no resurrection of the dead that's
[1:20:56] right we have no Earnest of it at all
[1:20:58] there's no plan made for it so that just
[1:21:01] settles it can you say amen hallelujah
[1:21:06] what did God say let's just let's just
[1:21:08] start let me let me deal with healing
[1:21:09] for a for a little for a little while
[1:21:10] here this morning we've got some folks
[1:21:12] in our church that need some healing how
[1:21:14] many needs healing in this
[1:21:16] building amen I know some people I know
[1:21:19] some of you in this in in in this in
[1:21:21] this place are are are are are are in
[1:21:24] dire need for God to do something
[1:21:27] doctors cannot help you that's right but
[1:21:30] I'm here to tell you your faith can
[1:21:34] touch the throne room of God and bring
[1:21:37] God's word to pass in your life can you
[1:21:40] say amen amen but there must be Faith to
[1:21:47] appropriate your healing now now just
[1:21:50] because healing is yours
[1:21:53] and healing is the children's bread
[1:21:55] doesn't mean that you're going to get
[1:21:56] healed just because the Bible says you
[1:22:00] have got to come through the means that
[1:22:02] God do you've got to come through the
[1:22:03] means of the blood brother in order to
[1:22:05] be saved you can't come through any
[1:22:06] other way you've got to do it the way
[1:22:08] God's word says to do it amen and that's
[1:22:11] the same way with healing can you say
[1:22:12] amen I want to tell you the promises of
[1:22:15] God are life to them that find them and
[1:22:18] the scripture says what we just read it
[1:22:20] there in proverbs 4 amen and and it is
[1:22:23] Health to all their flesh Exodus 23 and
[1:22:26] 5 or 25
[1:22:29] 23:25 we shall and ye shall serve the
[1:22:32] Lord your God and he shall bless thy
[1:22:35] bread and thy water and I will take
[1:22:40] sickness away from the midst of thee now
[1:22:45] now now we cannot
[1:22:48] presume we cannot just come and say
[1:22:50] that's a good thought yes yes yes yes
[1:22:52] God can do that it's got but but if your
[1:22:55] heart down here is is is is questioning
[1:22:57] well well I I you know I but I don't
[1:22:59] know but I I don't know if God can do it
[1:23:01] I'm too old I'm too young I'm too far
[1:23:04] gone I'm too this I'm too that God's
[1:23:06] never done it in the past I don't know
[1:23:08] if he can do it now there's got to come
[1:23:10] somebody that gets past the presuming
[1:23:13] that maybe God will do it and we've got
[1:23:16] to step up to the plate and say I
[1:23:20] believe God amen
[1:23:25] amen now I told you last week too many
[1:23:28] times people say I don't have the Holy
[1:23:30] Ghost amen because I'm still fighting
[1:23:33] temptation I don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:23:36] because I'm still fighting amen things
[1:23:38] in my walk with God I'm still bringing
[1:23:41] but you see amen Jesus was
[1:23:45] tempted Jesus had to
[1:23:48] overcome and so are you tempted and
[1:23:50] you're tried and we're not going to
[1:23:52] preach l last last week's sermon amen
[1:23:55] but you see the Holy Ghost within you
[1:23:58] will overcome the enemy because only
[1:24:02] then can you have true Faith to
[1:24:05] overcome amen are you hearing me now
[1:24:10] brother Brandon would say Moses never
[1:24:11] went down into Egypt presuming that God
[1:24:14] was with him he went down to Egypt
[1:24:17] knowing somebody say hallelujah
[1:24:20] hallelujah he went down into Egypt
[1:24:23] knowing that God was with him you don't
[1:24:26] accept your healing thinking God will do
[1:24:30] it you accept your healing because God
[1:24:34] has
[1:24:36] already done it he promised it and your
[1:24:41] faith says that it's so and nothing else
[1:24:44] can wipe it out someone say hallelujah
[1:24:48] hallelujah
[1:24:49] amen now is my Faith going to bring the
[1:24:53] healing
[1:24:55] about no no my faith is resting on the
[1:25:01] finished work of
[1:25:03] Calvary the debt of sin has already been
[1:25:08] paid and by his stripes I am already
[1:25:17] healed Hallelujah so when you receive
[1:25:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is a
[1:25:23] faith not to the to the intellect but
[1:25:26] it's a faith that has been placed in
[1:25:28] your in in in your life
[1:25:34] Hallelujah it is the get out of jail
[1:25:37] card that you permanently carry
[1:25:39] around and when sickness comes in it's
[1:25:43] already been paid
[1:25:46] for it's already done you're not begging
[1:25:49] God to heal you you're not begging God
[1:25:51] to deliver you you're not begging God
[1:25:53] for some kind of Supernatural something
[1:25:55] to take place and I hope I can get right
[1:25:57] no you are stepping into the room where

[1:31:32] lamb and I'm not going to hold you long
[1:31:34] on this point there was the redeeming
[1:31:37] work of the lamb and then there's the
[1:31:40] claiming work of the
[1:31:41] Lamb how many knows the
[1:31:44] difference the redeeming work or the
[1:31:47] initiation of redemption was the lamb
[1:31:51] sacrifice
[1:31:52] on
[1:31:53] Calvary and he has come to pay the
[1:31:56] penalty he has come to cure you of your
[1:31:59] sickness he come to pay the penalty for
[1:32:02] your sin and it took care of everything
[1:32:05] underneath
[1:32:06] that
[1:32:08] penalty you die because Adam sinned you
[1:32:13] get sick because Adam sinned you have
[1:32:17] marriage problems because Adam sinned
[1:32:20] amen you fight Devils because Adam
[1:32:24] sinned so when Christ came when the lamb
[1:32:28] came and he gave his life he paid the
[1:32:36] penalty for all the condemnation that
[1:32:38] was held against you therefore there is
[1:32:43] nothing nothing the devil can condemn
[1:32:46] you
[1:32:47] with well he would heal you
[1:32:50] but God would touch your marriage
[1:32:53] but you could overcome but the butts are
[1:32:58] gone
[1:32:59] amen well I'm telling you right now this
[1:33:02] is your chance to get up and do a
[1:33:05] jit

[1:33:24] inde Hallelujah now therefore there is
[1:33:26] no condemnation let's look here look
[1:33:28] look there he Romans 8 And1 hallelujah
[1:33:33] oh I love him therefore there is
[1:33:36] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:33:39] which are in Christ Jesus how do you get
[1:33:41] in Christ
[1:33:43] Jesus you are baptized into Christ by
[1:33:47] the power of the holy spirit amen you
[1:33:50] are baptized into this body oh come on
[1:33:53] church he says I found no condemnation
[1:33:55] to them that are in Christ Jesus who
[1:33:57] walk not after the flesh but
[1:34:01] after the spirit where does the spirit
[1:34:06] dwell what controls the
[1:34:10] flesh where does God's spirit
[1:34:16] dwell hallelujah what controls your
[1:34:20] flesh
[1:34:23] well praise the
[1:34:25] Lord faith is the
[1:34:30] substance faith is the
[1:34:33] evidence faith can move
[1:34:37] mountains faith if you
[1:34:39] believe these signs Will Follow You
[1:34:44] faith in my name you will cast out
[1:34:46] Devils through faith you shall lay hands
[1:34:49] on the sick and they shall recover none
[1:34:53] of that none of that could
[1:34:56] happen after Adam
[1:34:59] fell none of it no mortal man could ever
[1:35:03] stand up and claim them those
[1:35:06] scriptures until after the
[1:35:08] lamb initiated
[1:35:11] Redemption and when the lamb initiated
[1:35:14] Redemption all of the penalty of Adam's
[1:35:17] sin that you have on you is now put to
[1:35:21] the tree cursed is every man that
[1:35:25] hangeth on the tree he died for well I
[1:35:29] just want to shout right now because the
[1:35:31] devil just trying to make me think I
[1:35:34] can't do it when I can do
[1:35:38] it now the initiation of redemption was
[1:35:43] the lamb giving his life he initiated
[1:35:47] Redemption we've went through all this
[1:35:49] time we've went through all of this this
[1:35:51] ages through the power of the Holy
[1:35:54] Spirit but not in full restoration there
[1:35:57] was no restoration there coming out of
[1:35:59] the dark and now we've seen what had
[1:36:00] happened in the in the book of Acts the
[1:36:02] book of Acts was full of the power of
[1:36:04] the Holy Spirit Jesus it was showing
[1:36:07] that what Calvary done in the body of
[1:36:11] Jesus Christ now all of these other
[1:36:14] bodies plural was carrying the same life
[1:36:19] of God they were healing the sick they
[1:36:21] were raising the
[1:36:23] dead they were turning the world upside
[1:36:25] down even the very shadow of Peter was
[1:36:28] healing
[1:36:30] people but then the Dark Ages come
[1:36:33] along man and the tree and his brother

[1:41:09] that book and everyone's crying John
[1:41:11] brother bandam says the reason he's
[1:41:13] crying is because he knows that though
[1:41:15] the lamb paid for Redemption it would go
[1:41:18] on and on and on and on and on until the
[1:41:22] lamb
[1:41:23] claimed but then there was a voice that
[1:41:26] says there's one worthy he says I looked
[1:41:29] under the Earth no one was worthy I
[1:41:30] looked in the earth no one was worthy no

[1:41:48] in the hands of of the Lamb
[1:41:52] right he didn't die for himself right so

[1:43:01] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:43:03] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:43:05] of God should be finished as he ha
[1:43:07] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:43:09] now Redemption is fixed to be finished
[1:43:11] amen the mighty Angel has taken the lamb
[1:43:14] has already opened the book The Mighty
[1:43:16] Angel has come down to give the book
[1:43:18] amen and for those of you that that have
[1:43:21] a hard time with Revelations 10 brother
[1:43:23] bradam says the mighty angel will be on
[1:43:26] the Earth or the Earthly angel will be
[1:43:28] on the earth the same time that the
[1:43:31] mighty Angel comes it's the anointing
[1:43:34] that is coming down to reveal God's word
[1:43:37] to his
[1:43:40] people all
[1:43:43] right seventh verse again the seventh
[1:43:47] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:43:51] mystery of
[1:43:53] God should be
[1:43:55] finished you're no longer wondering
[1:43:57] whether you're saved you're no longer
[1:43:59] wandering if you can overcome you're no
[1:44:00] longer wandering now watch but just
[1:44:03] because the seventh angel is preaching
[1:44:06] and you're listening to the
[1:44:08] tapes and you're listening to brother
[1:44:10] Wendell don't mean that you're catching
[1:44:13] it it could be all right here it doesn't
[1:44:17] mean that okay it's already said but now
[1:44:19] watch and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[1:44:22] spake unto me saying go take the little
[1:44:26] book which is already open in the hand
[1:44:29] of the angel that standeth upon the sea
[1:44:31] and upon the
[1:44:33] Earth the Earthly Angel is doing the
[1:44:37] preaching right the Heavenly Angel has
[1:44:41] got the
[1:44:43] Revelation you can hear the he the
[1:44:45] Earthly Angel and get it here but the
[1:44:48] problem is is we keep it right here and
[1:44:50] we get it right here but God's wanting
[1:44:52] you to know that hey I don't want this
[1:44:54] to be an intellectual thing the mighty
[1:44:56] Angel is right here why don't you come
[1:44:58] to God and ask for that divine
[1:45:01] revelation to go from here to right here
[1:45:03] so all things can become possible to
[1:45:07] you come on it's not here it's here oh
[1:45:11] if I could just listen I
[1:45:14] don't how is it that Stephanie who was a
[1:45:18] rank Sinner and didn't deserve anything
[1:45:20] from
[1:45:22] God she was just as rank as rank can be
[1:45:25] how is it that God could heal her when
[1:45:28] she was still battling habits when she
[1:45:30] was still battling things she didn't
[1:45:32] even she she was still learning God she
[1:45:35] was still well maybe you was already
[1:45:37] delivered from your habits by then you
[1:45:38] you were I mean God came down and
[1:45:39] touched her so God did God did deliver
[1:45:42] that so I'm not going to take away from
[1:45:44] that but she wasn't serving the lord for
[1:45:47] 120 years in order to get a brand new
[1:45:49] liver
[1:45:51] right she was an she was an
[1:45:54] Infidel she was she she loved claiming
[1:45:57] that she was
[1:46:00] atheist she loved she was proud of the
[1:46:04] fact and yet when she beli God God gave
[1:46:08] her a brand spanking new
[1:46:13] [Applause]
[1:46:15] liver how could that be she didn't know
[1:46:19] it here all right come
[1:46:22] on you see now if she was in Luther's
[1:46:26] day she would have believed that
[1:46:28] justification like no other because the
[1:46:30] anointing of justification was here if
[1:46:34] she was in Wesley's day and she got
[1:46:36] saved it would be like the anointing of
[1:46:38] sanctification boom it's already there
[1:46:40] she don't know nothing about it yet it's
[1:46:42] already there and then when the preacher
[1:46:44] as John Wesley begins to preach on the
[1:46:46] methods of Salvation and sanctification
[1:46:48] her heart's in yes yes yes yes yes she's
[1:46:51] under the sanctification
[1:46:55] anointing if you were to get receive it
[1:46:58] on at 1906 and and and that and that in
[1:47:02] in the in the in the in the early 19th
[1:47:04] century you will the 20th century you
[1:47:06] would find that the power of the Holy
[1:47:09] Spirit would come upon you to speak in
[1:47:11] tongues people said amen they say that
[1:47:14] they would just walk within two blocks
[1:47:17] people walking to work two block
[1:47:20] box of the isusa street and they would

[1:49:50] give those guys a hand
[1:49:55] clap so the redeeming work of the
[1:50:00] lamb but this is the claiming work of
[1:50:04] the Lamb this is when the lamb is
[1:50:06] claiming what he died for he's called
[1:50:09] he'll always speak through a man so he
[1:50:12] comes and he speaks he always does he
[1:50:14] does nothing but through a man so he
[1:50:17] anoints a man to come
[1:50:20] and bring the Oracles of God now he
[1:50:22] can't just use a clergyman he can't use
[1:50:25] he can't just use anyone in the
[1:50:27] five-fold ministry amen those those have
[1:50:30] their they have their purpose but
[1:50:32] there's only one messenger per age that
[1:50:35] God chooses to reflect the anointing of
[1:50:39] the age to that people he builds that
[1:50:44] man that Prophet cannot fail his words
[1:50:48] will my words can fail fail your words
[1:50:51] can fail but God
[1:50:54] equips his man to
[1:50:57] speak and he expects you not to judge
[1:51:03] it you're required to judge
[1:51:06] me you're required to judge something
[1:51:09] when someone says something you'd better
[1:51:10] say h is that what the Bible says you're
[1:51:13] required prophecy has to be judged
[1:51:16] Visions have to be judged dreams have to
[1:51:18] be judged preachers have to be judged
[1:51:21] right but you never a prophet never
[1:51:24] stands before a
[1:51:27] tribunal he never stands before amen a
[1:51:31] group of men and say am I right if that
[1:51:33] were the case there were 400 of them
[1:51:36] told MAA you're
[1:51:39] wrong but God was with
[1:51:41] M there was a big group of them that
[1:51:44] stood against Jeremiah saying thus
[1:51:47] sayith the Lord and Jeremiah says maybe

[1:57:25] Supernatural
[1:57:30] am i' the Lord has put this out there

[1:57:50] of
[1:57:51] restoring it's the age of full faith in
[1:57:56] the word of
[1:57:58] God hallelujah well can you say amen
[1:58:02] amen now we've got brother Brandon would
[1:58:06] say we've got to have Divine Healing for
[1:58:09] the earnest of our complete deliverance
[1:58:12] if there's no Divine Healing there is no
[1:58:13] resurrection of the Dead how about that
[1:58:15] teacher if there's no Divine Healing
[1:58:18] there's no Resurrection Divine Healing
[1:58:21] is the earnest of the Resurrection if
[1:58:22] the holy spirit is here that is the
[1:58:25] earnest of our eternal life do you
[1:58:27] believe that the reason that God
[1:58:29] included Divine Healing how could you
[1:58:31] take it out of the Gospel when he was
[1:58:33] wounded for our transgressions by his
[1:58:36] stripes we were healed the same blood
[1:58:38] from the same man on the same day I love
[1:58:42] it the same blood from the same man on
[1:58:46] the same
[1:58:48] day he said one for salvation one for
[1:58:51] healing to deny one is to deny the
[1:58:58] other
[1:59:00] now I believe that there is a
[1:59:04] reality there's a
[1:59:07] reality now when Adam died and I'm going
[1:59:10] to I'm I'm closing I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:59:12] nowhere near my end so I'm just going to
[1:59:14] I'm going to
[1:59:15] pause here in just a
[1:59:18] minute
[1:59:21] the result of the curse it says in the
[1:59:23] day that you eat you shall surely die
[1:59:26] that was a compound
[1:59:28] meaning it was
[1:59:30] instantaneous the Soul's eye was closed
[1:59:33] it was spiritual death Adam lived
[1:59:37] on how how long did Adam live another
[1:59:40] 900 years I how
[1:59:45] eight and we know a thousand years is
[1:59:47] one day with God so we understand that
[1:59:50] it was twofold but Adam's Soul the
[1:59:53] spiritual death happened immediately the
[1:59:55] physical death happened amen 900 and
[1:59:58] something years later can you say Amen
[2:00:01] now the spiritual death is the lack of
[2:00:04] the ability to believe Heaven's channel
[2:00:07] was closed up Adam could no longer have
[2:00:10] the faith he had no longer had the faith
[2:00:11] to say to this tree to move he was no
[2:00:13] longer had the faith to stand there to
[2:00:15] to Leo the line now he's running from
[2:00:17] Leo now he he's no longer speaking to
[2:00:19] the storm now he's running from the
[2:00:20] storm he no longer has the faith the
[2:00:22] spiritual sense of Adam died closed he
[2:00:25] could no longer fellowship with
[2:00:28] God his super Rim his Supernatural
[2:00:31] ability to go into those that other rim
[2:00:34] of the unknown and to believe God listen
[2:00:36] friends what we' seen in the prophet and
[2:00:37] the supernatural of that that's way
[2:00:39] every one of us were built we were all
[2:00:42] built to communicate with
[2:00:48] God no longer aware of the new Angels no
[2:00:50] longer aware of the supernatural no
[2:00:52] longer aware of any of those things the
[2:00:55] physical
[2:00:56] death came
[2:00:59] disease amen is the penalty of death is
[2:01:02] that right sickness is part of the
[2:01:06] curse blindness cancer diabetes high
[2:01:11] blood
[2:01:12] pressure deafness blind eyes all of
[2:01:15] these things are all the results
[2:01:19] the attributes of
[2:01:22] death you are born to
[2:01:27] die don't care how good-looking you boys
[2:01:30] are you're going to start hurting you're
[2:01:32] going you're going to you're going to go
[2:01:33] downhill quick think you miss squirrels
[2:01:35] now
[2:01:37] Hallelujah wait till you get as blind as
[2:01:39] me
[2:01:42] amen So when you say I believe God for
[2:01:46] my
[2:01:48] salvation
[2:01:49] can I have confidence to believe God for
[2:01:51] my healing I say yes we
[2:01:55] can amen
[2:01:58] now I am looking for a place to pull
[2:02:01] over right now
[2:02:05] hallelujah
[2:02:07] amen you love
[2:02:10] him praise the
[2:02:12] Lord
[2:02:15] amen let's just have the musicians to
[2:02:17] come
[2:02:21] how many understands my
[2:02:22] point what I was preaching on here this
[2:02:26] morning healing is part of
[2:02:29] it you can now I I and I and I I I'm
[2:02:32] wanting to touch on healing here and and
[2:02:34] maybe if the Lord be willing he'll allow
[2:02:36] me to to continue my thoughts and to
[2:02:38] finish this for this evening because I
[2:02:40] think it's I think it's I think it's
[2:02:43] beautiful but I'm wanting to hit it's
[2:02:46] it's it's it's in you it's not outside
[2:02:49] of you it's on the inside of you that's
[2:02:51] the reason why I I I sung the song this
[2:02:53] morning Jesus on the inside working on
[2:02:56] the outside it's from the heart it's
[2:03:00] from the heart of man that brings the
[2:03:03] healing to man it's from the heart of
[2:03:06] man salvation comes it's from the heart
[2:03:08] of man you you you you'll never convince
[2:03:12] God
[2:03:14] enough to bring healing to you he's
[2:03:17] already done it
[2:03:21] huah
[2:03:23] now what we want to do is
[2:03:27] Lord let window Martin get past this
[2:03:31] little PE
[2:03:36] brain let me get past this hindrance
[2:03:38] this enmity the mind is enmity with God
[2:03:43] let me get past this
[2:03:47] mind let me get to that heart and let
[2:03:50] that
[2:03:51] heart really be
[2:03:54] energized therefore I'm not fighting for
[2:03:56] healing I'm
[2:03:57] fighting all of the resistance of the
[2:04:00] enemy so that I can get to my
[2:04:03] healing we're not begging God to heal us
[2:04:06] what we're need to do is fight all of
[2:04:08] those Devils between you and your
[2:04:10] healing the enemy there telling you that
[2:04:12] you can't the enemy telling you well the
[2:04:14] doctor said the enemy sitting there
[2:04:16] telling you all of that you have got to
[2:04:18] get past pass those things and you're
[2:04:20] only going to be able to do that by
[2:04:22] taking the sword of the spirit from the
[2:04:24] heart and defeat the enemy and get to
[2:04:27] that
[2:04:28] point healing is
[2:04:30] yours victory is yours salvation is
[2:04:35] yours salvation was yours when you were
[2:04:37] out the bar salvation's always been
[2:04:41] yours but you had to get to the point

[2:09:35] bit this
[2:09:40] evening and I'm asking
[2:09:42] God that by the end of this
[2:09:46] day that there will be a real Faith
[2:09:49] that'll just rise
[2:09:50] [Music]
[2:09:56] up I have no special powers you have no
[2:09:59] special
[2:10:03] powers brother brandom said over and
[2:10:05] over Jesus can do no more work than what
[2:10:07] he's already
[2:10:09] done so all we
[2:10:12] need is to believe that the power of the
[2:10:15] Holy Ghost is within you
[2:10:18] [Music]
[2:10:22] and that power within you is what gives
[2:10:24] you that
[2:10:27] Faith so we're asking God
[2:10:32] lord the word simply just moves the
[2:10:35] trees and the doubts out of the way so
[2:10:38] that I can see the sunshine the sun's
[2:10:40] already there I'm already destined to
[2:10:43] see it the word is coming forth to move
[2:10:45] all doubts out of the way to remove all
[2:10:48] those Devils out of your
[2:10:50] way so that you can see a clear picture
[2:10:53] of
[2:10:54] Calvary now brothers sisters let's
[2:10:57] believe God for
[2:10:59] that wouldn't it be wonderful if the
