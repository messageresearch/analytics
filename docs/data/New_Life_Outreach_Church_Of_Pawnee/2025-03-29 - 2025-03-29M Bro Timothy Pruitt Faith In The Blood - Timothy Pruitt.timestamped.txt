[3:08] [Music]
[3:25] Grace, how sweet the
[3:30] [Music]
[3:33] sound like
[3:35] [Music]
[3:37] me. All I was was
[3:41] lost, but
[3:43] now found. I was
[3:47] blind, but now I
[3:51] see. My chains are
[3:55] gone. I've been set
[3:59] free. My God, my
[4:03] Savior has me.
[4:08] Like a
[4:10] flood, his mercy
[4:14] reigns. Unending
[4:17] love. Amazing grace. Verse
[4:22] two was grace that taught my heart
[4:30] to bring me
[4:33] deep. Relieve me.
[4:37] Really, how
[4:39] preious did that
[4:42] grace
[4:44] appear. The hour I
[4:49] first Oh, my chains are
[4:53] gone. Can you testify of that? I've been
[4:58] set
[4:59] free. My
[5:02] Savior has ransomed me.
[5:06] And like a
[5:09] flood, his mercy
[5:13] reigns. Unending
[5:16] love. Oh, may sing it one more time
[5:20] now. My chains are
[5:23] gone. I've been set
[5:27] free. My God, my
[5:31] Savior has ransomed me.
[5:35] And like a
[5:38] flood his mercy
[5:42] reigns. Unending
[5:45] love. Amazing
[5:49] grace. Unending
[5:53] love. Oh my god. Amazing grace. Can you
[5:58] give the Lord a hand clap of praise?
[6:02] Has he done something good for you?
[6:06] How many enjoyed the the word of the
[6:07] Lord last night? Yes. I trust y'all were
[6:10] blessed. I know many things happened. Uh
[6:12] many deliverances took place, but it
[6:14] ain't over yet. This we're we got a
[6:16] service this morning and I believe the
[6:18] same God that met us last night is here
[6:21] to meet us this morning. We do have one
[6:23] announcement. There's a lost and found
[6:26] back there on that little stage. There
[6:28] is a ring. I think maybe some Bibles and
[6:30] things. So, if you are missing
[6:32] something, just go back there and look
[6:34] for it and hopefully it'll be there. You
[6:36] you expecting to hear from the Lord this
[6:38] morning. Come to worship the Lord. Amen.
[6:40] Can we sing that song? I'm not giving
[6:44] up. I'm not giving
[6:47] up. Oh, I'm not turning
[6:51] round. Oh, by the grace of God, I wear a
[6:56] shining crown.
[7:00] someday holding
[7:03] on to his self
[7:07] hand. Oh, I'm not giving up. No, I'll
[7:12] keep going
[7:16] on. Walking through this
[7:19] valley, through the veil of
[7:23] tears. Times I've even questioned.
[7:28] Even if my Lord was
[7:31] near at times that old tempter, he said,
[7:36] "Why not turn
[7:38] around? You can't get any further
[7:43] because you're just losing ground. But
[7:46] I'm not giving up. Oh no, I'm not
[7:51] turning round.
[7:53] Oh, by the grace of God, I'll wear a
[7:58] shining crown. Someday I'm going to keep
[8:02] holding
[8:05] on. They scarred
[8:08] hands. Oh, I'm not giving up. No, I'll
[8:12] keep going on.
[8:17] Oh, would you like to tell me there's
[8:21] been something bothering
[8:23] me? Why is it that old devil just won't
[8:28] let God's children be? You see, he has
[8:32] purpose and
[8:35] determined to get right in the
[8:38] way and turn us from the way of life and
[8:43] lead our soul. What are we going to tell
[8:46] him this morning? I'm not giving
[8:49] up. I'm not turning
[8:54] around. Grace of
[8:57] God crown someday. I'm going to keep
[9:02] holding
[9:04] on to him now. Our third verse. I'm
[9:10] giving up. Can we sing verse one again?
[9:13] Holding
[9:16] on. I've been walking through this
[9:20] valley, through this valley of
[9:23] tears. Sometimes I've even
[9:28] questioned. My Lord was
[9:31] near. At times that old
[9:35] tempter, why not turn
[9:38] around? You can't get any further.
[9:44] Just losing ground, but I'm not giving
[9:48] up. Oh no, I'm not turning
[9:53] around. The grace of
[9:58] God crown someday. I'm going to be
[10:02] holding
[10:04] on to his nails
[10:07] hand. Oh, I'm not giving up. You know,
[10:12] I'll sing it again
[10:14] now. Oh, I'm not giving
[10:19] up. Oh, I'm not turning
[10:24] round. So, I will sh ground.
[10:39] I'm not giving up. Go out. Keep going
[10:43] [Music]
[10:46] on. Can you give the Lord a hand cup of
[10:48] praise this
[10:49] morning? Through the
[10:52] trial. There's two ways I can
[10:56] go. I can still wear a
[11:00] smile or let it bring me down
[11:03] [Music]
[11:04] low. Satan whispers your truth.
[11:09] But I hear Jesus tell me to stand. What
[11:14] am I going to
[11:16] do? I think I'll throw up my hands.
[11:21] I'll just throw up my
[11:24] hands. That's the praising the
[11:29] Lord. Give up because I
[11:32] stand for his power of the
[11:36] word and God keeps my hands
[11:41] raised. He comes down and it my bra. Got
[11:45] to die in my
[11:48] plan. When I throw up my
[11:52] hand, everything is going
[11:56] wrong. I got my back to the
[11:59] wall. Oh, Satan's coming on
[12:04] strong. He really wants me to
[12:08] fall. He trles my way.
[12:12] Oh, even sickness is part of his plan. I
[12:17] myself, I can't
[12:18] win. Oh, so I'll just throw up my
[12:23] hand. I'll just throw up my
[12:27] hand. It's praising the Lord.
[12:32] I won't give
[12:36] up the
[12:39] word. When God
[12:43] sees, he comes down. I miss my bra. God
[12:48] is not in my plan. They just can't
[12:51] stand. When I throw a first one
[12:54] again, when I'm faced with a
[12:58] trial, I've got two ways I can
[13:01] go. Oh, I used to wear a
[13:06] smile, but let it bring me down,
[13:10] Lord.
[13:13] Satan. Oh, I
[13:17] hear me to stand. What am I going to do?
[13:21] [Music]
[13:29] I just praise the Lord.
[13:36] [Music]
[13:39] world.
[13:43] [Music]
[13:46] He comes down
[13:50] and my plan just
[13:53] can't throw up my hand. I got a
[13:59] my just can't stand when I throw up my
[14:07] hand.
[14:08] Hallelujah. There's something about
[14:10] worshiping the Lord. Amen. Amen. When
[14:12] things get tough, things get tight, just
[14:15] worship the Lord and start to change the
[14:17] atmosphere, change the situation around
[14:19] you. We're going to go to prayer this
[14:21] morning. Brother Matthew, if you
[14:22] wouldn't mind coming and leading us in
[14:24] prayer. We don't have any written
[14:26] requests this morning, but let's just
[14:28] remember the man of God as he would come
[14:31] and he would yield himself to the Lord
[14:33] and speak to your needs, speak to your
[14:35] hearts. I believe that your pull
[14:37] operates the gift of the Lord. You
[14:38] believe that this morning? So as you
[14:40] pull on the gift of the Lord, I believe
[14:42] that the God can meet your expectation.
[14:43] If you would would have an unspoken
[14:46] request, just make it known by an
[14:47] uplifted
[14:49] hand. Amen. Let's just go before him.
[14:53] Lord Jesus, how we just want to tell you
[14:56] once again how we love you and
[14:57] appreciate your goodness and your mercy
[14:59] to us, Lord. That you would call us and
[15:02] elect us and write our name on the
[15:05] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[15:06] foundation of the world.
[15:09] Lord, by the shedding of your blood on
[15:10] Calvary that we could be forgiven and
[15:15] not only forgiven, Lord, but justified
[15:17] that we never did it in the first
[15:19] place, Lord. And to hear how you've come
[15:21] by your grace and your mercy, and you've
[15:23] let us know that we're an unlimited
[15:26] generation where if we can believe, all
[15:28] things are possible, Lord. And you've
[15:30] sent us a message that we can believe
[15:34] all things to show our position, Lord,
[15:37] that we don't have to bow down to any
[15:39] devil or any creed, but we can be set
[15:42] free to soar in heavenly places in
[15:44] Christ Jesus. And Lord, thank you for
[15:47] that, Lord. And we've gathered once
[15:49] again. We thank you so much for what
[15:52] you've already done in the meetings, but
[15:54] now we stand in another predestinated
[15:56] moment in time where you look down
[15:59] through the portals of time and said,
[16:00] "This is going to be the time that I
[16:02] meet this young one and this son and
[16:06] this daughter and this will be the
[16:08] moment where they catch the revelation
[16:10] of who they are and they're born again
[16:12] and filled with the Holy Ghost. Lord, I
[16:13] I come with that expectation this
[16:15] morning, Lord, that there's going to be
[16:17] sons and daughters filled with the Holy
[16:19] Ghost and changed, never to be the same,
[16:22] Lord. And we're just asking that you'd
[16:24] come anoint the man of God and just move
[16:26] them aside, Lord, and speak to our
[16:30] hearts, Lord. We're excited to be here
[16:32] and to see one another and to make
[16:34] friends,
[16:36] and but Lord, you're
[16:39] here. We want to meet you.
[16:44] We want to set aside any of the
[16:46] distractions and certainly there's
[16:48] activities and things to do after the
[16:51] service and maybe plans that have been
[16:54] made. But Lord, we don't want to leave
[16:57] you here with dirty feet. We want to
[17:00] take a moment
[17:01] and wash your feet with our tears and
[17:05] let you know we love you, Lord.
[17:08] want you to know. We want you to have
[17:10] preeminence in this
[17:13] service. Lord, maybe we've been holding
[17:15] some things back. We haven't been making
[17:17] a full surrender. And there's still some
[17:19] hurts and some disappointments that we
[17:22] haven't got over. We just say, Lord, I
[17:25] lay it all down at your feet now and
[17:27] just have your will and way now. We
[17:30] commit all things to you. The unspoken
[17:32] prayer request, the
[17:34] needs, we commit them to thy hands,
[17:36] Lord. and ask your will be done. We love
[17:38] you and pray these things in your name,
[17:40] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[17:42] [Music]
[17:44] Amen. I'm
[17:47] free. Praise the Lord. I'm free. No
[17:52] longer
[17:55] bound. No more chains holding
[17:59] me. It's
[18:01] resting. It's such a blessing.
[18:06] Praise the
[18:08] Lord. Can we sing that again as brother
[18:10] Caleb Fairweather would bring a special?
[18:13] Oh, I'm
[18:15] free. Oh, praise the Lord. I'm free. No
[18:21] longer
[18:23] bound. No more chains holding me. My
[18:28] soul is
[18:30] redeemed. It's such a blessing.
[18:34] Praise the
[18:36] Lord. Hallelujah. I'm
[18:39] free. Oh yes, I'm
[18:44] free. Oh, praise the Lord. I'm free. No
[18:49] longer
[18:51] bound. No more chains in me. My soul is
[18:58] resting. It's such a blessing.
[19:03] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I praise.
[19:07] Sing it again now. Oh, I
[19:13] praise the
[19:16] Lord. No longer
[19:21] bound in my soul.
[19:34] Hallelujah. I'm
[19:37] free. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm
[19:45] free. Amen. Right after this for the 10
[19:48] winners, if you wouldn't mind coming and
[19:49] singing for us. God bless you.
[20:04] [Music]
[20:17] Lord, I
[20:21] confess I've been a
[20:24] [Music]
[20:25] criminal. Stolen your
[20:30] breath and I sang my own song.
[20:36] Lord, I
[20:37] [Music]
[20:39] confess I'm far from
[20:43] innocent. These shackles I
[20:48] wear, I bought on my own.
[20:59] Lord, I
[21:02] confess I've been a part
[21:07] of made for your
[21:11] house, but I walked my own
[21:16] ropes. Then Jesus
[21:21] came. He tore down my
[21:24] prison walls. Death came to life.
[21:30] life when he called me by
[21:36] name. Scarlet sin had a crimson cost. He
[21:42] nailed my debt to that old rugged cross.
[21:46] An empty slave had an empty grave. Thank
[21:51] God that stone was rolled.
[21:56] Scarlet sins had a crimson cost. He
[22:00] nailed my death to that old rugged
[22:04] cross. An empty slave and an empty
[22:08] grave. Thank God that stone was rolled.
[22:15] [Music]
[22:23] I see bright crimson robes draped over
[22:26] the ashes. Wide open tomb where there
[22:30] should be a casket. The children are
[22:34] singing and dancing and laughing. The
[22:37] father is welcoming. This is our
[22:40] homecoming. Roses in blue, pushed up
[22:44] from the elves. Rivers of tears flow
[22:48] from good
[22:50] times. Families are singing and dancing
[22:54] and laughing. The father is welcome.
[22:58] This is our homecoming. Heaven joins in
[23:01] with the glorious sound. The great cloud
[23:05] of witnesses all gathered around cuz the
[23:09] ones that are lost, they're finally
[23:12] found. The father is welcome. This is
[23:17] our home. Scarlet sins at a crimson
[23:22] cross. He nailed my death to that old
[23:26] rugged cross, an empty slave.
[23:32] Thank God that storm was
[23:37] [Music]
[23:40] roll.
[23:42] [Music]

[24:36] was away.
[24:39] [Music]
[24:54] Thank you for the cross. us.
[25:00] Lord, thank you for the
[25:05] price
[25:07] you
[25:09] pay. Bearing all my sin and
[25:15] shame. In love, you
[25:19] came and gave
[25:22] amazing grace.
[25:26] Thank you for this
[25:29] love,
[25:32] Lord. Thank you for the
[25:36] dead
[25:38] pierced
[25:40] hands. You washed me in your cleansing
[25:44] flow.
[25:46] Now all I
[25:49] know is your
[25:51] forgiveness
[25:52] and
[25:54] [Music]

[26:45] [Music]
[26:49] crucified. Worthy is the
[26:53] lamb.
[26:56] Oh, worthy is the lamb. Verse one.
[27:02] Thank you for the
[27:05] cross, Lord. Can you just lift your
[27:08] hands for a minute? Thank you
[27:11] for the
[27:14] price. Are you thankful for
[27:18] that? My sin and shame.
[27:23] In love, you
[27:25] came and gave the
[27:29] amazing
[27:31] grace. Thank you for his

[29:00] Lord. Worthy is the
[29:05] [Music]
[29:10] [Music]
[29:14] lamb. Amen. It's yours. Good to be here
[29:17] with y'all this weekend. Brother Kobe
[29:20] asked me if I'd come up and sing My God
[29:23] is Real. I've heard Brother Sean sing
[29:25] that before, so I wouldn't go in there,
[29:27] but we're going to try this
[29:32] one. Well, there is
[29:35] power. So much
[29:38] power. Oh, there's power in the name. In
[29:43] the name of Jesus. There's
[29:47] power. So much
[29:49] power. Oh, there's
[29:52] power in that
[29:55] name. Well, the man came on to Jesus. He
[29:59] cried, "Lord, I want to be healed. My
[30:02] body's full of source." And he cried,
[30:05] "Lord, I want to live." Then Jesus
[30:08] reached down and touched him. And his
[30:11] sickness went away. Just like he healed
[30:14] that man, he will take your pain away.
[30:18] Oh, there's
[30:20] power. So much
[30:23] power. Oh, there's power in the name. In
[30:27] the name of Jesus. There's
[30:31] power. So much
[30:34] power. Oh, there's power in that name.
[30:41] Take a look at Paul and tied up in be a
[30:45] pulp. They were thrown into a Roman
[30:48] jail. And it looked like all was lost.
[30:52] But something started to happen as they
[30:55] begin to pray. Their chains fell off as
[30:58] they praise the Lord. They said, "Can't
[31:00] you all now see? There is
[31:04] power. So much power.
[31:08] Oh, there's power in the name. In the
[31:12] name of Jesus. There's
[31:15] power. So much
[31:18] power. Oh, there's power in that
[31:23] name. Now you may be here suffering.
[31:27] Your body's full of
[31:29] pain. Satan said, "I got you now. Your
[31:33] life will never be the same." But as the
[31:36] word comes forth this morning, that body
[31:39] must obey. Just get up on your feet
[31:43] right now and to God give your praise.
[31:46] For there's
[31:47] power, so much
[31:50] power. Oh, there's power in the name. In
[31:55] the name of Jesus. There's
[31:59] power. So much power.
[32:02] Oh, there's power in that name.
[32:07] [Music]
[32:36] Take a look at Paul's island tied up in
[32:40] me to a boat. They were brought into a
[32:44] Roman hill and it looked like all was
[32:46] lost. But something started to happen as
[32:50] they begin to pray. Their chains fell
[32:54] off as they prayed Lord as they take you
[32:56] all now see there is
[32:59] power so much
[33:02] power oh there's power in the name in
[33:07] the name of Jesus there's

[33:13] power there's power in that
[33:18] name oh there's power
[33:22] in that
[33:28] name.
[33:32] Amen. Amen. Do you believe that this
[33:34] morning? Have you experienced that power
[33:36] for yourself? Amen. Can we sing this
[33:40] little song as the plets get ready to
[33:43] come? My God is awome.
[33:48] He can move the
[33:51] mountains. Me in the
[33:56] valley from the
[33:58] rain. Oh my God is
[34:03] awesome. When I'm
[34:06] broken, strength for I am
[34:10] weaken forever. He will reign. Second
[34:13] verse.
[34:15] My God is
[34:18] awesome. Savior of the whole world,
[34:22] giver of
[34:25] salvation. By his stripes I'm
[34:29] healed. My God is
[34:32] all today. I am
[34:36] forgiven. His grace is why I'm
[34:40] living. Praise his holy name.
[34:44] Oh my God is
[34:48] awesome. Yes, you are
[34:51] [Music]
[34:53] awesome.
[34:55] Awesome. Yes, you're
[34:59] awesome. My God is
[35:02] awesome. Oh, you're
[35:05] [Music]
[35:07] awesome.
[35:09] Awome. Yes, you're awesome.
[35:13] [Music]
[35:15] Amen. God bless you. You may be singing
[35:17] this morning.
[35:38] [Music]
[35:52] You never ask me to stretch out my
[35:59] arms. Put nails in my hands.
[36:07] I'll never feel the weight of the
[36:13] world or carry that cross on my back.
[36:22] Nothing I do could ever
[36:28] repay all that you did on that
[36:35] day. For you took my
[36:38] place up there on that
[36:43] tree. You paid the price so that I could
[36:48] be free.
[36:51] You died for me. Now I'm living for
[36:57] you, Lord. That's the least I can
[37:08] do. You never sent me out on my own.
[37:16] You're always
[37:19] leading the
[37:22] way. And all that I ask for is a hope in
[37:28] my heart and only a small seed of
[37:37] faith. I know you gave me all that I
[37:42] have.
[37:44] Oh, why would I not give it
[37:51] back? You took my
[37:54] place up there on that
[37:58] tree. You paid the price so that I could
[38:04] be
[38:05] free. You died for me. Now I'm for
[38:13] you, Lord. That's the
[38:15] least I can
[38:18] do. You didn't have to walk down that
[38:22] road. You didn't have to rescue my
[38:26] soul or lay down your life just for
[38:32] me. I should have been taking those
[38:36] steps. You should have been my last
[38:39] prayer.
[38:43] But you just want me to
[38:49] be. You took my
[38:52] place up there on that
[38:56] tree and you paid the price so that I
[39:01] could be
[39:03] free. You died for me. Now I'm living
[39:08] for you.
[39:11] You're
[39:17] that I can do.
[39:20] [Music]
[39:27] [Music]
[39:32] [Music]
[39:38] Ah, wasn't that beautiful this morning?
[39:40] Have you enjoyed the specials this
[39:46] morning? Can we all stand as we get
[39:49] ready to turn into the man of
[39:53] God? How do you explain?
[39:59] [Music]
[40:01] How do you
[40:03] [Music]
[40:07] describe a love that goes from east to
[40:15] west as deep as it is
[40:18] [Music]
[40:22] wide. Oh, you know all our hopes.
[40:31] Lord, you know all our
[40:34] [Music]
[40:37] fears and words cannot express the love
[40:43] we
[40:44] feel. But we long for you to hear.
[40:53] So listen to our
[40:55] [Applause]
[40:57] [Music]
[40:59] hearts. Hear our spirit
[41:06] sing. A song of praise that
[41:10] [Music]
[41:13] flows from those you have
[41:18] redeemed. Hallelujah.
[41:21] And we will use the words we
[41:26] know to tell you
[41:29] what an awesome God you
[41:35] are. When words are not
[41:38] enough to tell you of our
[41:42] love, listen to our
[41:49] hearts. If words could fall like
[41:54] [Music]
[41:55] grave, oh from these lips of
[42:03] mine. And if I had a thousand
[42:10] years, I would run out of
[42:15] time. Hallelujah.
[42:18] But if you listen to my
[42:25] heart, every beat will
[42:30] say, "Oh
[42:32] yes, thank you for the life. Oh, thank
[42:37] you for the
[42:39] truth. Thank you for the
[42:43] way." Can you sing them with all your
[42:45] heart this morning?
[42:47] So listen to our
[42:51] [Applause]
[42:52] [Music]
[42:53] hearts, hear our
[42:57] [Music]
[43:10] spirit. you every
[43:15] day. And we will use some words we
[43:21] know to tell you what an
[43:26] awesome awesome God you
[43:31] are. Not
[43:33] [Music]
[43:36] enough. Oh, listen to our heart. Sing
[43:40] that one more time. Listen to our hearts
[43:44] and listen to our
[43:46] [Music]
[43:49] hearts. Oh yes,
[43:52] Lord. Hear our spirit
[43:57] sing. Oh, a song of
[44:00] [Music]
[44:05] praise. Those you have redeemed.
[44:11] [Music]
[44:16] Words we
[44:17] know to tell you
[44:21] what an
[44:23] awesome awesome God you
[44:30] are. To tell you my love.
[44:35] listen to our
[44:39] hearts. Hallelujah. How many would have
[44:42] a need? You just want to make it known
[44:44] to the Lord and ask the Lord to come by
[44:47] and speak to your heart today. Amen.
[44:49] Let's just bow our hearts before him.
[44:52] And Father, we just come again this
[44:55] morning just asking Lord that you would
[44:57] come
[44:58] and Lord you would come and minister to
[45:01] our needs today as only you can. We ask
[45:04] Lord that you would come and break the
[45:07] words of life to us and to where each
[45:10] one can grab a hold of it and apply it
[45:12] to their lives. Lord, you see the needs
[45:15] around this building. The hands are
[45:17] lifted up and said, "Father, come by my
[45:19] way." And we Lord know, Lord, that
[45:21] you're able to do that. you're able to
[45:24] meet our needs according to your riches
[45:26] and glory and beyond what we can think
[45:29] or even ask. Lord, exceed even our own
[45:33] expectations. Lord, we just want to say,
[45:35] Father, this morning, we love you with
[45:38] all of our hearts. We thank you once
[45:40] again for this opportunity. We ask,
[45:42] Lord, that you would move in this place,
[45:45] Lord, by your presence. And Lord, just
[45:48] set every captive free. We pray. Heal
[45:50] the sick, Lord. Lord God, just save the
[45:54] lost, Father. Whatever, however you want
[45:56] to move, Lord, we open it up to you and
[45:59] ask, Lord, that you take preeminence. We
[46:02] ask it in Jesus name for your glory.
[46:05] Amen. Amen. Let's turn to John chapter 1
[46:09] if you
[46:11] would. Amen. John chapter
[46:17] 1 and verse 29. and also Hebrews chap 10
[46:21] and verse one if you would be be there
[46:24] as well like I said it's quite an honor
[46:28] to speak to you this morning and just
[46:30] ask the Lord to come and take control
[46:33] amen this morning of and and do as he
[46:36] would he would want to that's what
[46:38] that's our desire is to give him
[46:39] preeminence in every service amen and
[46:43] verse 29 it says the next day John seeth
[46:47] Jesus cometh coming unto him and saith,
[46:51] behold the lamb of God which taketh away
[46:55] the sin of the world. Hebrews 10 and
[46:58] verse
[47:01] one says, "For the law having a shadow
[47:04] of good things to come and not the very
[47:07] image of the things can never with those
[47:09] sacrifices which they offered year by
[47:12] year continually make the cumbers there
[47:14] unto perfect. For then would they not
[47:18] have ceased to be offered, because that
[47:21] the worshippers once purged should have
[47:22] no more conscience of sin. But in those
[47:26] sacrifices, there is a remembrance again
[47:28] made of sins every year. For it is not
[47:31] possible that blood, the blood of bulls
[47:34] and goats should take away sins. So we
[47:37] heard of one lamb who took takes away
[47:39] sins and one lamb who could not take
[47:42] away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into
[47:44] the world, he saith, sacrifice and
[47:46] offerings, thou wouldest not, but a body
[47:49] hast thou prepared me, and burnt
[47:51] offerings and sacrifices for sins, thou
[47:53] hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I
[47:56] come in the volume of the book, it is
[47:58] written of me to do thy will, oh God.
[48:00] And above when he said, above when he
[48:03] said, sacrifice and offering and burnt
[48:05] offerings and offering for sin, thou
[48:07] wouldest not, neither hast pleasure
[48:09] therein, which were offered by the law.
[48:11] Then said he, "Lo, I come to do thy
[48:14] will, oh God." He taketh away the first,
[48:17] that he may establish the second, by the
[48:20] which we which will we are sa sanctified
[48:24] through the offering of the body of
[48:25] Jesus Christ once for all. And every
[48:29] priest standing daily, ministering and
[48:31] offering oftenimes the same sacrifices,
[48:34] which can never take away sins. But this
[48:38] man, after he had offered one sacrifice
[48:40] for sins forever, sat down on the right
[48:43] hand of God, from henceforth, expecting
[48:46] till his enemies beca be made his
[48:48] foottool. For by one offering, he hath
[48:52] perfected forever them that are
[48:55] sanctified by one offering. Amen. God
[48:59] bless. You can be seated
[49:00] today.
[49:02] Um, I'd like to speak on faith in the
[49:05] blood. Amen. faith in the blood. As in
[49:09] our scripture reading, as I pointed out,
[49:11] we we read about a lamb that could not
[49:15] take away sins. They would come and they
[49:17] would offer every year. And uh but you
[49:20] as we know that that that blood of that
[49:22] lamb that they would offer that woolly
[49:24] lamb or that blood of bulls and goats.
[49:27] Amen. They they the life of that bull or
[49:30] the life of that goat or the life of
[49:32] that lamb or whatever they offered it
[49:34] could not come back upon the sacrif or
[49:37] upon the person who sacrificed. Amen. Or
[49:39] upon the worshipper. But Amen. But the
[49:42] one we also read about was the lamb who
[49:44] took away the sins of the world. Amen.
[49:47] It was telling us that there was not
[49:49] only was he there to cover the sins as
[49:52] that blood before would just cover sins
[49:55] that were made and it was still there.
[49:57] The desire was still there. The the want
[49:59] was still there. But now we have a blood
[50:01] that doesn't just cover but that blood
[50:04] carried them on his shoulder and nailed
[50:06] them to a cross. That blood, amen, as we
[50:09] would look at it is is to take away or
[50:12] would annihilate sin. Amen. Would
[50:15] annihilate. This annihilate means to
[50:17] cause to cease to exist. To do away with
[50:21] entirely so that nothing remains. Amen.
[50:24] To cause it to have cause something to
[50:27] have no effect. Amen. To nullify. To
[50:31] destroy the substance or the force of of
[50:35] whatever to regard as of no consequence.
[50:38] It also means to cause something to
[50:41] vanish or cease to exist by coming
[50:44] together and changing it into another
[50:46] form. Amen. And we've been taught in the
[50:49] message that this blood is a bleach.
[50:51] Amen. It's a it's a bleach for our sins.
[50:54] that as you could take a a a cup of
[50:57] bleach and you could take a little drop
[50:58] of ink and and you could just put it in
[51:01] a little bit of bleach and before you
[51:03] know it that that that that ink would
[51:05] swirl around and it would swirl around
[51:07] and then all of a sudden you couldn't
[51:09] find one molecule of it anymore. You you
[51:11] couldn't find one evidence of it
[51:13] anymore. And the prophet of God said,
[51:15] "We stand justified in the presence of
[51:17] God as that drop of ink that dropped
[51:20] into the tub of bleach. You'll never
[51:23] find the stain of the ink no more. It
[51:26] went somewhere, but it can never come
[51:28] back again. Amen. It went somewhere, but
[51:31] it can never come back again. And a man
[51:34] who's truly redeemed and his sins are
[51:37] under the blood, those sins are
[51:39] demolished. They are annihilated. It's
[51:42] gone. It's separated. It's dropped into
[51:45] the ink of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[51:47] And it'll never be remembered no more.
[51:49] God forgets about it. and you stand as a
[51:53] son and daughter of God in the presence
[51:55] of God. What kind of power is afforded
[51:58] to the church of the living God today?
[52:01] Amen. Not that we have to carry our
[52:03] shame and our guilt and all the things
[52:05] that we've done in our life anymore.
[52:07] That's where Satan likes to keep you. He
[52:09] likes to keep you in your shame and and
[52:11] your mistakes and your failures. But I'm
[52:13] here to tell you, we're not under the
[52:15] blood of bulls and goats. We're not
[52:16] under a blood of a offering that we have
[52:19] to come every weekend and we got to
[52:21] offer or every camp service and we Amen.
[52:23] But by one sacrifice he has perfected
[52:26] every one of us by the blood of the
[52:29] offering of this lamb. Amen. And brother
[52:31] Brandon would bring it. He said he the
[52:33] bridegroom took away your shame.
[52:37] Well, right there is enough to shout
[52:39] about for a long time. Amen. Amen. He
[52:41] took away your shame and he put it in
[52:44] the sea of forgetfulness. Amen. How? By
[52:47] the washing of the water of the word.
[52:49] Amen. And the blood of life. He would
[52:51] say in another place, this word, Amen.
[52:54] It bled for you. It It washed you. It It
[52:57] came over your life and it changed you
[52:59] from who you was. Amen. Your first
[53:02] husband you was married to. Now, we were
[53:04] brought into this world. We were born in
[53:06] this world sh in in sin, shaped in
[53:08] iniquity. Amen. by we didn't come that
[53:10] way by choice. Amen. We came that way by
[53:12] the fall. Amen. The fall brought us into
[53:15] this condition. And we were married.
[53:17] Amen. Under this covenant to sin. But
[53:19] Amen. He came as a bridegroom to divorce
[53:22] you from that covenant, to do away from
[53:25] with that covenant, to annihilate that
[53:27] covenant and bring you under a new
[53:29] covenant. Amen. To bring you into a
[53:32] place that you don't even have to bear
[53:34] the shame of it no more. But why? Cuz
[53:37] your lamb, he bore the shame. You don't
[53:39] have to bear the weight of it no more.
[53:41] Why? Cuz your lamb bore the weight. You
[53:43] don't have to bear the reproach of it no
[53:45] more. Why? Cuz your lamb, he bore the
[53:50] reproach. We were like that eagle that
[53:53] was not by choice, but somebody grabbed
[53:55] the egg and put it in the wrong place.
[53:59] Come on, somebody. And he was born in
[54:01] this chicken yard. He He knew that
[54:03] something was wrong here. He knew that
[54:05] something didn't quite match up. Amen.
[54:07] The desires of the chicken wasn't quite
[54:09] what he wanted. Amen. He tried to
[54:11] satisfy it maybe for a little while. He
[54:13] tried to maybe eat a few bugs and
[54:15] whatever chickens eat, but he wasn't
[54:17] ever a chicken. I want you to understand
[54:20] that eagle was never a chicken. He was
[54:23] an eagle. Amen. From birth. He was an
[54:26] eagle from the beginning. Amen. In the
[54:28] mind of God, he was always an eagle. He
[54:31] never was a chicken. Amen. The man may
[54:33] have put him in a chicken yard, but that
[54:35] didn't make him a chicken.
[54:38] Amen. And Satan may have may have made a
[54:41] way that you was born in sin and shaped
[54:43] in iniquity. But you never was a son of
[54:46] Satan. You never was a daughter of
[54:48] Satan. You never was a son of this
[54:50] world. But before the foundation of the
[54:52] world, God saw you and he called you and
[54:55] he put your name on the book of life.
[54:58] You always was a son. You always was a
[55:01] daughter.
[55:06] He said that first husband that you were
[55:08] married to the world, he said the
[55:10] anointed bridegroom, he forordained you
[55:14] and he washed you by the water by the
[55:16] church. No, that don't sound right. By
[55:20] that's not in God's Bible. He washed you
[55:22] by the water of the word. In the word,
[55:24] you're standing completely justified as
[55:27] though you never did it in the
[55:29] beginning.
[55:32] You never did it in the beginning. If
[55:34] you're standing on God's word and with
[55:36] God's word, how many standing on God's
[55:38] word? He not standing on your feelings
[55:41] or or your emotions or or not standing
[55:43] on none of that. Standing on the word of
[55:45] God. Every amen, every jot, every
[55:48] turtle. He's I'm trying to tell you,
[55:50] pull away from them shucks. Get out here
[55:52] in the weed where you can get right
[55:53] before the sun. He said, I hear the
[55:55] coming of the combine. You're standing
[55:57] completely justified like you never did
[56:00] it in the first place.
[56:03] Where is the first place? Where you was
[56:06] first thought of in the mind of God.
[56:08] Amen. You never did it in the first
[56:11] place. Therefore, I'm so thankful more
[56:13] than of of that than anything I know.
[56:15] You are the pure v virtuous sinless
[56:18] bride of the son of the living God.
[56:21] Every man or woman that's born to the
[56:23] spirit of God and washed in the blood of
[56:25] Jesus Christ and believes every word of
[56:28] God, you stand as though you never
[56:30] sinned in the first place. You are
[56:33] perfect.
[56:36] You are perfect. Well, I don't feel
[56:38] perfect. Well, good. It ain't about you
[56:40] feeling perfect. Well, I don't look
[56:42] perfect. It ain't about you looking
[56:44] perfect. Amen. I I I wasn't born in a
[56:47] perfect family. It was It ain't about
[56:49] you being born in a perfect family. It's
[56:52] about you having a perfect sinless
[56:55] sacrifice that died before the
[56:57] foundation of the world. But he came
[56:59] down in flesh and he bore your reproach.
[57:02] He bore your sins. He bore your iniquity
[57:05] that you can be free.
[57:14] He says, "If I was supposed to die in
[57:17] the morning, the man took my place. I
[57:19] can't die for that sin. Somebody took my
[57:21] place."
[57:23] And Jesus the word took my place.
[57:28] Hello.
[57:30] And Jesus the word took my place. He
[57:33] became me that I might become him.
[57:39] That spiritual union of Christ and his
[57:41] church now with the flesh becoming word
[57:43] and the word becoming flesh manif
[57:45] manifested vindicated just what the
[57:47] Bible said would happen in this day it's
[57:49] happening day by day we're near the
[57:52] coming of the Lord to be united with his
[57:53] church where the word becomes the word
[57:56] the call of the Holy Spirit searching
[57:58] the heart you're standing completely you
[58:01] never sinned in the first place
[58:04] it's in the sea of forgetfulness is
[58:08] if I can get really get you to see that
[58:10] this morning and and you can realize I
[58:12] don't have to bear that shame no more. I
[58:15] repented of it and God put it in the sea
[58:17] of his forgetfulness. There is now no
[58:21] condemnation. If we can get condemnation
[58:24] out of here, we can see victory in the
[58:26] house of God. Amen. We can see
[58:28] overcoming lives. We can see people,
[58:30] Amen, that'll walk right, talk right,
[58:33] live right. Why? It ain't no shame on
[58:35] me.
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:43] Hallelujah. Oh, you were accused of it
[58:46] by your accuser, but really you're
[58:48] predestinated to be a son or daughter.
[58:50] You're standing there washed and your
[58:52] old book of divorcement is put away and
[58:54] it's dead. Absolutely out of existence,
[58:57] even in the mind of God.
[59:02] Hello.
[59:05] Precious, virtuous, sinless son of God
[59:07] standing with a pure, unadulterated,
[59:09] burn bright word that he washed by the
[59:11] water of his own blood that become flesh
[59:13] and
[59:14] manifested. What a place we're standing.
[59:17] This blood that was shed is no longer
[59:20] just covering our sins. It's not a
[59:22] temporary thing.
[59:26] Amen. It was an annihilation of our
[59:29] sins.
[59:30] Hebrews 9 and:12 said, "Neither by the
[59:33] blood of good goats and calves, but by
[59:35] his own blood, he entered once into the
[59:37] holy place, having obtained eternal
[59:41] redemption for us." So, it's not a
[59:43] temporary redemption. It's not a
[59:46] temporary thing where it's dependent on
[59:48] you and what you done and what you don't
[59:50] do. It's an eternal redemption.
[59:53] It's dependent on what he's already
[59:55] done.
[1:00:01] We talked about Gethsemane yesterday,
[1:00:03] but
[1:00:04] Calvary, Amen. Calvary settled the sin
[1:00:08] question once and for all.
[1:00:12] Amen. Man was found guilty of sin. And
[1:00:15] sin was a penalty that no man could pay.
[1:00:17] That penalty was so great until there
[1:00:19] wasn't anyone else, anyone that just
[1:00:21] anyone that could pay it. He said, "I
[1:00:24] truly believe that God ordained it that
[1:00:25] way. That penalty would have to be so
[1:00:28] great that not just any man could do it,
[1:00:31] but he would have to come himself.
[1:00:34] The penalty of sin was death. And we
[1:00:37] were all born in sin and shaped in
[1:00:39] iniquity, come to this world speaking
[1:00:40] lies. There wasn't none of us worthy.
[1:00:45] There ain't one of us worthy this
[1:00:46] morning. They could find that they
[1:00:48] couldn't find one on the earth that was
[1:00:50] worthy. Amen. We know sin didn't just
[1:00:52] start on the earth. It started in
[1:00:53] heaven. When Lucifer, as we talked about
[1:00:55] self, he couldn't get self out of the
[1:00:57] way.
[1:00:59] So the self brought sin down into the
[1:01:01] earth and and sin be to multiply and go
[1:01:05] across the world. Amen. But so it had to
[1:01:07] take a there had to be a penalty. Amen.
[1:01:09] And this blood of you could offer every
[1:01:11] lamb in the world. You could offer every
[1:01:13] goat in the world. You could offer
[1:01:15] everything. But it could never take away
[1:01:18] sin.
[1:01:22] It required death.
[1:01:29] When sin struck the earth, it began as a
[1:01:32] sheet of blackness falling upon the
[1:01:34] heaven and it literally paralyzed the
[1:01:36] earth. It throwed every creature on the
[1:01:39] earth, all of God's creation into
[1:01:41] bondage. Man was under bondage of the
[1:01:43] sickness of death and sickness and
[1:01:45] troubles and sorrow. All nature fell
[1:01:48] with it. Sin was like an anesthetic, he
[1:01:52] says, which actually paralyzed the
[1:01:54] earth. And then we're sitting here now
[1:01:56] hopeless because every creature on earth
[1:01:58] was subject to it. Every everyone born
[1:02:00] on the earth was subject to it. So it
[1:02:02] had to come from one someplace if we was
[1:02:04] going to get true redemption. There had
[1:02:06] to come. It had to come from a place
[1:02:08] that had no sin.
[1:02:12] It could not come from the earth.
[1:02:16] One of us could not redeem the other. It
[1:02:18] had to come from something else. When a
[1:02:20] man realizes he's a separated from God,
[1:02:22] you know what happens? He becomes a
[1:02:24] wonderer
[1:02:25] and man begin to wander around and look
[1:02:28] for God and and look because what
[1:02:30] happened? They were broken away from the
[1:02:32] true fellowship they was ordained to
[1:02:34] have.
[1:02:37] They wept, they cried, they told. They
[1:02:39] wandered in the wilderness. They
[1:02:40] wandered through deserts and mountains.
[1:02:42] They were seeking a city whose builder
[1:02:44] and maker was God. for he knew that if
[1:02:46] he could ever get back to the into that
[1:02:48] presence.
[1:02:51] Maybe here this morning, you've been
[1:02:52] wandering through a lot of deserts and
[1:02:54] wandering across mountains and valleys
[1:02:56] and you're wondering about this and
[1:02:57] you're wondering about that. I'm here to
[1:02:59] tell you there's somebody here this
[1:03:01] morning that can be the dissolver of
[1:03:03] your doubts. He can answer every
[1:03:06] question in your heart. If you can come
[1:03:08] back and fellowship with him and realize
[1:03:10] this is what I was born for. I wasn't
[1:03:13] born to be the household of every devil.
[1:03:16] I was born to be the temple of the
[1:03:18] almighty
[1:03:23] God. Something on the inside of him told
[1:03:26] him he was from a place that was
[1:03:29] perfect.
[1:03:32] Oh,
[1:03:35] glory. There ain't nobody in this
[1:03:37] building that don't seek perfection.
[1:03:41] Don't tell me that. I've seen your
[1:03:44] selfies. I talked about it last night or
[1:03:47] yesterday morning. You know, we got to
[1:03:48] get
[1:03:54] everything. Then we send it out to our
[1:03:56] friends. This look good. What are you
[1:03:58] doing? You're seeking
[1:03:59] perfection. But that's a temporary
[1:04:02] perfection.
[1:04:05] Hey, you can be 18 years old this
[1:04:08] morning. Muscles as big as barn
[1:04:11] doors. You can have all of that. But
[1:04:14] just look right up here and right here
[1:04:16] is what you're going to
[1:04:21] be. If time carries or every one of
[1:04:24] you's got an appointment with death. I
[1:04:26] know when you're 15, 18 years old, you
[1:04:28] don't think about it much. All you
[1:04:29] thinking about is that brown hair, red
[1:04:31] hair, beautiful hair, this hair, curly
[1:04:32] hair, straight hair. I don't like my
[1:04:34] hair. I want a different kind of hair.
[1:04:38] But when you get older, sometimes you
[1:04:39] just want hair.
[1:04:42] I didn't mean to get there. I
[1:04:45] just You want those muscles back. You
[1:04:47] want that strength back. You want And
[1:04:49] you're just wondering, this is what
[1:04:51] happened. The cycle of revival and death
[1:04:53] has never failed. Those who are born
[1:04:55] young, they end up growing up and
[1:04:57] becoming old and dying.
[1:05:00] It's a cycle of life that was put upon
[1:05:03] us by sin.
[1:05:08] And a lot of people don't when you're
[1:05:09] you're young, you don't think about
[1:05:10] those things. You don't think about the
[1:05:12] frag how fragile life really is. And and
[1:05:15] listen, you don't you don't got even got
[1:05:16] a promise of becoming 50 years old or 60
[1:05:19] years old. There's a lot of 18 year olds
[1:05:20] that die.
[1:05:27] But we're wondering and we're trying
[1:05:29] this and I if I can just get this
[1:05:32] certain goal, if I can just reach this
[1:05:34] and if I can just get all my bills paid,
[1:05:36] if I can then somebody gets sick and you
[1:05:38] got more bills
[1:05:40] and excuse me,
[1:05:43] you you know, you get you get over
[1:05:45] something and something else comes up.
[1:05:52] Amen. you know, sickness gets all right
[1:05:54] and then all a sudden, you know,
[1:05:55] something else comes up and it's was one
[1:05:57] battle after another battle and one
[1:05:59] situation after another situation. Amen.
[1:06:01] Why? Because sin has come
[1:06:04] on. He said it's because of the wave of
[1:06:07] sin. But in your heart, you know there's
[1:06:09] something. Amen. You've been seeking
[1:06:12] something. It shows you there is a
[1:06:14] perfection somewhere. Somewhere there is
[1:06:17] something. And that's the reason he says
[1:06:19] many times today sinners are still
[1:06:21] wandering about. Beautiful young girl
[1:06:23] will cut off her hair and put fa makeup
[1:06:26] on her face and clothes that'll show her
[1:06:28] being. And and listen, that's got to be
[1:06:30] in the boys, too.
[1:06:34] Come on now. Amen. The boys will pick up
[1:06:36] every worldly hairstyle and think it's
[1:06:38] all right. Pick up every worldly jean
[1:06:40] style and think it's all right. All
[1:06:42] kinds of nonsense.
[1:06:46] Amen. Why? because they're wondering.
[1:06:50] They're wondering. And you know,
[1:06:51] neighbors will build a certain house and
[1:06:53] fix it a certain way, you know, a little
[1:06:54] better. And this neighbor, he'll start
[1:06:56] he'll start picking up his side. He'll
[1:06:58] start doing something. Amen. There's so
[1:07:00] much tore up and worry. And this young
[1:07:02] lady will find another young lady that's
[1:07:03] more popular than her. The neighbor will
[1:07:05] find somebody's got a house that's
[1:07:06] better than his. And the wife will the
[1:07:08] woman will find another woman dressed a
[1:07:10] certain way and looks better than she
[1:07:12] does. It's something in us that's
[1:07:13] seeking for something. But it shows
[1:07:16] we're lost.
[1:07:20] We want to find something that brings us
[1:07:22] satisfaction. Do you understand? Amen.
[1:07:25] Your wants for the world is just a
[1:07:27] thirst inside of you that was actually
[1:07:29] created and put in there not for the
[1:07:31] things of the world, but for the things
[1:07:33] of God. That thirst was put on the
[1:07:35] inside of you to bring you to a place
[1:07:38] where you can find him. And he is the
[1:07:41] only one that'll ever quench that
[1:07:43] thirst. You can have a million dollars
[1:07:46] in the bank, $10 million in the bank. If
[1:07:48] you ain't got
[1:07:50] Christ, you're still
[1:07:53] thirsty. You're still looking. You're
[1:07:55] still wondering. You're still trying to
[1:07:57] find that perfection. But if you will
[1:08:00] find that perfect sacrifice,
[1:08:05] [Applause]
[1:08:07] hallelujah. Humans have tried it through
[1:08:10] the ages. They've wept for it. They
[1:08:11] cried. They've done everything. But
[1:08:14] finally that day on
[1:08:16] Calvary, there one came one down from
[1:08:19] glory. One by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:08:22] who came from glory and Calvary was
[1:08:24] formed. That was the day that the price
[1:08:27] was paid and the sin question was
[1:08:29] settled forever and it opened away to
[1:08:32] something that we've been hungering and
[1:08:34] thirsting for. It brought to us to a
[1:08:37] place of satisfaction.
[1:08:41] There's no man that's ever visited
[1:08:42] Calvary that's seen it the way it was
[1:08:44] that could ever be the same. Everything
[1:08:46] that he desired and longed for is met
[1:08:49] when he reaches that place. When Jesus
[1:08:51] died at Calvary, he paid the sin
[1:08:54] question.
[1:09:04] He said he said right here. He said,
[1:09:06] "Satan was knocked out at Calvary."
[1:09:13] Well, you know, I thought I'd get a few
[1:09:15] no more shouts than that. I'm talking
[1:09:16] about the very one that's been
[1:09:18] tormenting you.
[1:09:20] I'm talking about the very one that's
[1:09:22] been trying to bluff you and hold you
[1:09:24] and keep you. That one, our champion,
[1:09:31] you know, you you was talking about ball
[1:09:33] games last night. I'll just kind of jump
[1:09:35] in on that. People get all of excited
[1:09:37] about somebody and you know about some
[1:09:39] prize fighter and he he's won 32 three
[1:09:42] victories and he's lost two.
[1:09:47] He's lost two. And they get all excited
[1:09:50] about it or they get all excited by
[1:09:51] their team and there might be 54 and 45
[1:09:55] 54 wins and 45 losses and they're
[1:09:58] pulling for them. They're dressing like
[1:09:59] them. They're acting like them. They're
[1:10:00] shouting. They're carrying on.
[1:10:04] Oh, don't act like you don't know what
[1:10:06] I'm talking about.
[1:10:08] People act a fool at a ball game.
[1:10:12] And we're talking about acting a fool
[1:10:13] over somebody who's lost a
[1:10:18] [Applause]
[1:10:20] lot. Got 45 losses and you're still
[1:10:22] going,
[1:10:23] "Woo! Get up, win, get out." Well, we'll
[1:10:28] get them next
[1:10:30] time. And that don't stop you from
[1:10:32] cheering for them. That don't stop you
[1:10:35] from trying to follow them and figure
[1:10:37] out who they going to get next year and
[1:10:38] what they going to do and how they going
[1:10:40] to prove this and what they're going to
[1:10:41] do. That don't stop you from nothing.
[1:10:45] [Applause]
[1:10:47] Amen. But I'm talk not talking about a
[1:10:49] champion who has some
[1:10:52] losses. I'm talking about a champion of
[1:10:55] champions.
[1:11:00] You know what a championship champion
[1:11:02] is? Is a champion that knocked out other
[1:11:04] champions.
[1:11:09] Hallelujah. This God that we serve, he
[1:11:12] has not got one loss in his loss column.
[1:11:18] If we can act a fool about somebody
[1:11:20] that's lost 45 games or missed 45 shots
[1:11:24] or or not made a touchdown in their
[1:11:26] life, how much
[1:11:27] more could we praise the champion of
[1:11:31] champions? He's not lost a battle. He's
[1:11:34] not lost a person. He's not lost a war.
[1:11:38] And he's not going to lose this battle,
[1:11:40] but he's going to bring his word to
[1:11:42] fulfillment.
[1:11:46] How about praising a champion that never
[1:11:48] lost? How about praising a champion that
[1:11:51] never went down one time in defeat?
[1:12:05] Hallelujah.
[1:12:07] He broke the backbone of Satan at
[1:12:09] Calvary.
[1:12:15] He broke the backbone of Satan at
[1:12:18] Calvary. Ever seen something with a
[1:12:20] broke
[1:12:21] backbone? It's lost its abilities to do
[1:12:26] things. It's paralyzed.
[1:12:31] You know, one day I was going to church,
[1:12:34] Sister Ruth, there we was going down
[1:12:36] this little country road, just kind of
[1:12:38] looking into the sun a little
[1:12:40] bit and
[1:12:42] uh preaching that night, something was
[1:12:45] real heavy on my heart and some sit I
[1:12:47] don't remember now, some
[1:12:49] situation, all of a sudden out of the
[1:12:51] corner of my eye, I catch a catch a
[1:12:54] little movement. I look just right at
[1:12:56] the last second and I see this snake
[1:12:58] come out and I go
[1:13:01] And I look back and he's messed up and
[1:13:03] he's flopping around. I was like, "Well,
[1:13:05] I didn't I didn't see him. I didn't I
[1:13:08] didn't even have time to move. Not that
[1:13:09] I would have, but I would didn't have
[1:13:11] time to
[1:13:12] move." Sister Ruth looked at me. She
[1:13:14] said, "Well, I think the greater thing
[1:13:16] is he didn't see you."
[1:13:21] Could it be that way this weekend?
[1:13:25] Maybe the devil, you didn't see the
[1:13:26] devil coming in his last attack and you
[1:13:29] didn't see him trying to step out in
[1:13:30] your way. But I think the greater thing
[1:13:32] is he didn't see you.
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:37] He didn't realize that it wasn't just
[1:13:40] your power alone.
[1:13:45] If it had been my power alone, I might
[1:13:47] have jumped out of the way. I might have
[1:13:49] walked around him. But I wasn't
[1:13:50] dependent on my power. I was in a power
[1:13:53] that I didn't have to worry about his
[1:13:55] bite. I didn't have to worry about
[1:13:57] anything he could do. He couldn't do
[1:13:59] nothing to
[1:14:00] me. And if you get into Jesus Christ and
[1:14:03] you come across Satan, it's not your
[1:14:06] power you're depending on. It's the
[1:14:08] power of almighty
[1:14:10] God. And greater is he that is in
[1:14:16] me. May it be like this this weekend.
[1:14:19] There be people so charged with the
[1:14:21] spirit of God, it'll be so anchored in
[1:14:23] their soul when they leave this place
[1:14:26] and the devil tries to set his first
[1:14:27] trap and he tries to get out of the
[1:14:32] [Applause]
[1:14:35] way. Why? Cuz they're not no longer
[1:14:38] dependent on this veil of flesh. They're
[1:14:40] not no longer trying to defeat them on
[1:14:42] their own, but they're riding in the
[1:14:45] power of the Holy
[1:14:46] Ghost.
[1:14:51] Our sins are forgiven.
[1:14:58] Anybody need to hear that this morning?
[1:15:02] Your sins are forgiven.
[1:15:07] Woman, where is our accuser?
[1:15:12] The only one who has the right to accuse
[1:15:14] you don't even know what you're talking
[1:15:16] about.
[1:15:20] You know what I'm saying? He put it in
[1:15:22] the sea of his forgetfulness. He's the
[1:15:24] only one that has a right to bringing
[1:15:26] forth judgments.
[1:15:31] But Satan comes and he accuses us and he
[1:15:34] brings past up and he he brings guilts
[1:15:37] up and he brings
[1:15:43] shame. Hallelujah. He
[1:15:47] says, "You can be forgiven of every
[1:15:51] sin." Not only that, but that sin is
[1:15:54] paid for.
[1:15:57] You don't have to say, "I'm not worthy."
[1:16:03] You could never be worthy. But a worthy
[1:16:06] one took your place.
[1:16:09] You're free. You don't have to wander no
[1:16:11] more. You don't have to be a pleasure-
[1:16:12] seeeking man out there for the earth.
[1:16:14] You don't have to be
[1:16:17] lost cuz there's a highway. It's a way
[1:16:20] called the way of holiness. And the
[1:16:22] unclean won't pass over. But he who
[1:16:25] comes to the fountain first, then he has
[1:16:27] a right to the
[1:16:29] highway. He broke the powers of Satan.
[1:16:33] You don't have to no longer be tore down
[1:16:35] by sin. You don't have to no longer
[1:16:37] yield your members to sin. Sin has lost
[1:16:40] its power.
[1:16:45] That's what Calvary
[1:16:47] meant. I want you to understand we were
[1:16:50] not I want to drive this home as hard as
[1:16:52] I can. We were not saved or forgiven by
[1:16:56] animal
[1:16:58] blood. It was not temporary blood. It
[1:17:02] was not ordinary blood. But you were
[1:17:04] saved by the sinless, spotless lamb of
[1:17:07] God. That's not ordinary
[1:17:10] blood. Cuz that blood crushed the head
[1:17:13] of Satan. That blood broke the chains of
[1:17:16] sin and death. That blood is not just
[1:17:19] another man's blood. It's the blood of
[1:17:21] Jesus Christ, the son of the living God.
[1:17:23] It's the blood that can heal the sick.
[1:17:25] It's the blood that'll save the violent
[1:17:27] sinner. It's the blood that open the
[1:17:29] eyes of the blind. It's the blood
[1:17:31] that'll cure the sick, the man, the
[1:17:35] feeble. It's the blood that walked on
[1:17:37] water. It's that same blood that calmed
[1:17:40] the seas. is a
[1:17:42] blood that restores.
[1:17:45] There's no mistake too much for this
[1:17:47] blood. There's no sin too great for this
[1:17:50] blood. So if I was you, I would shake
[1:17:53] off the guilt. I would quit living
[1:17:58] condemned. Cuz you're not under a
[1:18:00] temporary blood. You're not under the
[1:18:02] blood of bulls and goats. Your sins are
[1:18:05] forever
[1:18:07] forgiven.
[1:18:11] [Applause]
[1:18:18] Before this blood, when a man sinned, he
[1:18:21] separated himself from God. He crossed a
[1:18:24] great chasm and put himself in death on
[1:18:27] this side. And there was no way back.
[1:18:31] There was no way for him to get back.
[1:18:33] But when he did that, talking about Adam
[1:18:35] and Eve, when they did that, God
[1:18:36] accepted a substitute as a lamb or a
[1:18:39] goat, a sheep, something for
[1:18:41] blood. And on that side, he's a son of
[1:18:44] God. He's offering from God, offspring
[1:18:46] from God. He's an inheritance of the
[1:18:48] earth. He can control nature. He can
[1:18:49] speak into existence. Why? He's a
[1:18:51] creator himself. He's offspring of God.
[1:18:53] But when he crossed, he separated his
[1:18:56] sunship. His sn he's a sinner by nature.
[1:18:59] He's under the hands and dominion of
[1:19:00] Satan. And God took a sacrifice of
[1:19:03] chemical of the blood. But the blood of
[1:19:05] bulls and goats did not, as we said,
[1:19:06] divorce sin. It only covered it. He
[1:19:09] said, "If I have a red spot on my hand
[1:19:11] and I covered it with white, that red
[1:19:13] spot is still there.
[1:19:15] It's still there." But God sent down
[1:19:17] from heaven a bleach. It was a blood of
[1:19:20] his own son. And we have put our He puts
[1:19:22] our confessed sins into God's bleach.
[1:19:25] You try to find it again.
[1:19:29] And I want to you to really catch these
[1:19:31] next few words the prophet of God left
[1:19:33] us. He said, "The coloring of sin goes
[1:19:36] back through the mediators and down
[1:19:39] through time until it hits the accuser,
[1:19:42] Satan, and then it lays on him till the
[1:19:46] day of judgment."
[1:19:52] Come on, somebody. Ain't no shame on me,
[1:19:55] but it's shame on you, devil. Ain't no
[1:19:58] sin on me, but it's sin on you, devil.
[1:20:01] Ain't no drugs on me, but it's drugs on
[1:20:04] you, devil. Ain't no temper on me, but
[1:20:06] it's temper on you, devil. Ain't no
[1:20:08] anxiety on me, but it's anxiety on you,
[1:20:13] devil. You think the devil don't suffer
[1:20:16] with anxiety? It says the demons believe
[1:20:19] and tremble.
[1:20:21] Oh yeah, there's a lot of anxiety that's
[1:20:23] been placed on them. Why was it placed
[1:20:25] on them? cuz somebody realize I don't
[1:20:28] have to bow down to that thing no more.
[1:20:30] I can be forgiven of it. I can repent of
[1:20:33] my unbelief and all of a sudden the
[1:20:35] coloring of it rolls down and it's
[1:20:38] laying on the
[1:20:40] devil. Hallelujah. If I can get you to
[1:20:43] understand dang sins on you, they're on
[1:20:46] your accuser. It's his sins. It's his
[1:20:49] iniquity. It's his doubts. It's his
[1:20:52] fear. It's his suicide. It's his
[1:20:55] anxiety. It's his, not yours.
[1:21:01] Hallelujah.
[1:21:04] [Applause]
[1:21:09] Turn to your neighbor and said, "Ain't
[1:21:11] no shame on me."
[1:21:19] It's time we really put that devil where
[1:21:20] he belongs.
[1:21:25] You know where he
[1:21:26] belongs? Under those sin, the weight of
[1:21:29] those
[1:21:30] sins. Under the weight of that unbelief.
[1:21:33] Under the weight of that worry and doubt
[1:21:35] and anxieties,
[1:21:39] fears. Amen. When he's when a man's
[1:21:42] confessed his sins, they've been dipped
[1:21:44] into the blood of Jesus Christ. It kills
[1:21:47] all
[1:21:50] symptoms. That's a direct quote. It
[1:21:52] kills all symptoms and every molecule of
[1:21:55] sin goes back to the devil and lays on
[1:21:58] him to judgment.
[1:22:04] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:22:07] Hallelujah. Do you see what happened?
[1:22:09] You had a lamb that carried your sins
[1:22:12] and he died
[1:22:16] and that blood ran down his body and he
[1:22:19] said, "It is finished. What was he
[1:22:22] saying? Sin's reign is done.
[1:22:27] The offering of sacrifices year by year
[1:22:29] is done.
[1:22:31] Guilt is done. Shame is
[1:22:36] done. And all of those sins he carried
[1:22:40] down into Calvary or into into hell.
[1:22:45] And he put them where they belong.
[1:22:49] And he told the devil, said, "Devil,
[1:22:50] you've been falsely accusing my children
[1:22:52] because they didn't never do it in the
[1:22:53] first place. These actually belong to
[1:22:56] you. I'm bringing them back to the house
[1:22:59] they belong to. I'm bringing them back
[1:23:01] to the place where all this started. It
[1:23:04] is your sin. It is your unbelief. It is
[1:23:07] you that has started this whole thing.
[1:23:09] And you are going to be the ones who die
[1:23:12] in with these sins. And you will be dead
[1:23:15] for eternity.
[1:23:20] Oh, I love that right now. I can tell
[1:23:22] you right now, I use it all the time,
[1:23:24] but I'll use it again right now. Your
[1:23:26] devil has an expiration date.
[1:23:30] [Applause]
[1:23:33] I read the scripture yesterday. In the
[1:23:35] last days, perilous time shall come.
[1:23:37] Last days for who?
[1:23:40] It ain't my last days.
[1:23:43] This is not my last days, but it is the
[1:23:46] last days for cancer. It is the last
[1:23:50] days for Parkinson disease. It is the
[1:23:52] last day for sugar diabetes. It is the
[1:23:55] last days for
[1:23:58] sin. Woo. If I can get some of you
[1:24:01] sisters to realize it's the last days
[1:24:04] for anxieties and
[1:24:08] fear. But I don't have an expiration
[1:24:10] date. I checked the date. It says
[1:24:14] eternal.
[1:24:20] [Applause]
[1:24:21] Oh, let's just praise the Lord for a
[1:24:23] moment. We are eternal beings brought to
[1:24:27] eternal sunship by the blood of Jesus
[1:24:31] Christ. There is now no
[1:24:36] condemnation. Let's kick that
[1:24:38] condemnation out the building this
[1:24:40] morning.
[1:24:43] I'm not looking at a lot of condemned
[1:24:44] people. I'm looking at a condemned
[1:24:47] devil.
[1:24:49] I'm not looking at a lot of jailed up,
[1:24:51] frozen up, bound up people. I'm looking
[1:24:55] at a bound
[1:24:58] [Applause]
[1:25:04] devil. This blood is a powerful blood.
[1:25:07] This blood is a glorious blood. His
[1:25:10] blood will wash every sinner clean.
[1:25:20] Hallelujah. He talks about Moses under
[1:25:22] the blood of bulls and goats could walk
[1:25:24] out and call for flies.
[1:25:28] Under the blood of bulls and goats. He
[1:25:31] said, "Why would we stumble when
[1:25:33] someone's under a perfect sacrifice
[1:25:36] speak squirrels into existence?"
[1:25:42] Hello.
[1:25:48] Why would we stumble when there's
[1:25:50] somebody now under the blood of the
[1:25:53] perfect sacrifice that can speak to
[1:25:55] their mountain?
[1:25:59] Come on now. I like how Jesus said it.
[1:26:02] He said you.
[1:26:04] How many you's we got?
[1:26:07] How many can say I'm a you?
[1:26:09] Good. You're a lamb. You. That's a lamb,
[1:26:11] right? A
[1:26:15] you. You speak to the mountain. And
[1:26:19] brother Andrew, I I didn't find nowhere
[1:26:21] in any of the scriptures that records
[1:26:22] this that it Jesus instructs them said,
[1:26:25] "Go find a
[1:26:27] preacher. Go find your mom and dad. Go
[1:26:30] find
[1:26:32] you." How many you's we got? You speak
[1:26:36] to your mountain. Do you know why that's
[1:26:38] important? Cuz your mountain knows your
[1:26:40] voice.
[1:26:44] And it ain't just your voice. It's the
[1:26:47] voice of resurrection. It's the voice
[1:26:49] that is behind the
[1:26:51] voice. It's the voice of authority. It's
[1:26:53] the voice of power. It's the voice of
[1:26:55] triumph. It's the voice of glory. that
[1:26:58] when a man is born to the spirit of God,
[1:27:00] he said when you when you come when you
[1:27:02] have that, you can ask what you
[1:27:12] will. Got to hurry. Read some
[1:27:15] scriptures. Romans 5:9 says, "Since
[1:27:17] therefore we have now been justified by
[1:27:20] his blood, much more shall we be saved
[1:27:22] by him from the wrath of God."
[1:27:26] justified. Ephesians 1:7, "In him we
[1:27:29] have redemption through his blood, the
[1:27:31] forgiveness of our trespasses according
[1:27:33] to the riches of his grace." 1 John 1
[1:27:36] and verse 7. But if you walk in the
[1:27:38] light as he is in the light, we have
[1:27:41] fellowship one with the other. And the
[1:27:43] blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from
[1:27:46] a few sins,
[1:27:50] partial sins,
[1:27:54] all sins.
[1:27:57] I said this before and I use it again. I
[1:27:59] love that three-letter word he uses
[1:28:01] through the scripture. I'm the Lord God
[1:28:03] that heals all thy diseases. I'll
[1:28:06] forgive all thine iniquities. Three
[1:28:07] letters, all. But a whole lot of stuff
[1:28:11] fits in three letters.
[1:28:14] You can have doctor's descriptions this
[1:28:16] long and it'll go right down into all.
[1:28:19] You can have words you can't even
[1:28:21] pronounce and it'll go right down into
[1:28:23] all. You can have sins that you have
[1:28:25] bore, but you've asked for forgiveness
[1:28:27] and you ask God to move upon your life.
[1:28:29] It can right now go into all all sins,
[1:28:33] all sicknesses, all
[1:28:37] iniquities, all. He cleanses us from
[1:28:40] all. Colossians 1:20 said, "Through him
[1:28:43] to reconcile to himself all things,
[1:28:47] whether on earth or in heaven, making
[1:28:49] peace by the blood of his cross."
[1:28:54] Hebrews 9:22 says, "Indeed, under the
[1:28:56] law, almost everything is purified with
[1:28:59] blood." Almost everything is purified
[1:29:01] with blood. Did you catch that? Under
[1:29:04] the
[1:29:04] law. But without the shedding of blood,
[1:29:08] there is no forgiveness of
[1:29:11] sins. So under the shedding under the
[1:29:14] law, it would almost cover everything.
[1:29:18] But under this blood, it covers all.
[1:29:23] If I can just really get you to grasp a
[1:29:25] hold of that this morning with your
[1:29:28] whole heart and say, "God, I bore this
[1:29:30] for a long time. I bore the reproach for
[1:29:33] a long time. I bore this this shame for
[1:29:35] a long time. But I'm hearing the word of
[1:29:37] God. I'm hearing as that eagle did down
[1:29:39] in that chicken yard. I hear the word
[1:29:42] screaming to me this morning and saying,
[1:29:44] "You don't have to live in that shame
[1:29:46] any longer. You don't have to live in
[1:29:48] that unbelief no longer. come up out of
[1:29:51] there. How am I going to get it? You've
[1:29:54] been given two
[1:29:55] wings. And there's a wind of the Holy
[1:29:58] Ghost blowing this morning. And if
[1:30:00] you'll set those
[1:30:01] wings, the Old and the New
[1:30:04] Testament into the word of God, into the
[1:30:07] winds of the Holy Ghost, you will
[1:30:09] rise. Rise. Rise above it all.
[1:30:15] All
[1:30:21] Oh, first Peter 1 and verse 18 says,
[1:30:23] "For as much as you know that you were
[1:30:26] not redeemed with corruptible
[1:30:30] things." We heard it last night. There
[1:30:33] was some things were limited, but
[1:30:34] there's some things that are not
[1:30:35] limited, that are unlimited. The law of
[1:30:38] sin and death reign because the the the
[1:30:41] sacrifices of goats and sheep were
[1:30:45] limited.
[1:30:48] They were corruptible things. They were
[1:30:50] something that would live and die, have
[1:30:53] a beginning, have an end. So he had to
[1:30:55] come who had no beginning and has no
[1:30:57] end.
[1:31:00] So you were not, Amen. redeemed by
[1:31:02] something that's corruptible. You were
[1:31:04] redeemed by something that's
[1:31:06] incorruptible. Amen. You were not
[1:31:07] redeemed us by silver or gold from your
[1:31:10] vain conversation received by the
[1:31:11] traditions from your fathers, but with
[1:31:14] the precious blood of Christ as of a
[1:31:17] lamb without spot and without blemish.
[1:31:22] Titus 2:13 says, "Looking for that
[1:31:25] blessed hope, that glorious appearing of
[1:31:28] the great God and our Savior Jesus
[1:31:29] Christ, who gave himself for us that he
[1:31:32] might redeem us
[1:31:35] from oh, y'all y'all can read
[1:31:39] good. who redeemed us from
[1:31:43] all, let's just say it till we believe
[1:31:45] it, all iniquity, and purified unto
[1:31:49] himself a peculiar people zealous of
[1:31:51] good works.
[1:31:58] Revelations 15 says, "Unto
[1:32:02] him that loved
[1:32:05] us, oh my
[1:32:10] Can I just deal with something right
[1:32:12] now?
[1:32:14] Young people have the hardest time
[1:32:15] receiving
[1:32:21] love. They have all these complexes and
[1:32:24] things that they have and the devil or
[1:32:26] maybe even some of their friends used of
[1:32:28] the devil said to them. I just just the
[1:32:30] way it is. Listen, your words have
[1:32:34] power. I dealt with it just a little bit
[1:32:36] yesterday. Come on. Just the Lord just
[1:32:38] placing it right here in my lap
[1:32:40] again. Amen. Your words have power. We
[1:32:43] read it. Be kind one to another.
[1:32:48] You need to watch what you say to each
[1:32:50] other.
[1:32:53] Well, he ain't popular anyway. Well, you
[1:32:55] ought to put your arms around him and
[1:32:56] love him more.
[1:33:00] Come on. Oh, that kind of burnt your
[1:33:02] hide, didn't you? Don't want to clap
[1:33:03] about that.
[1:33:07] [Applause]
[1:33:13] Our sisters have a hard time recognizing
[1:33:16] their true given beauty given of God.
[1:33:20] Given by God. Listen, it ain't important
[1:33:23] that some man recognizes your beauty.
[1:33:26] It's important that God recognizes it.
[1:33:32] You probably don't want the man that's
[1:33:33] after you just because of your beauty.
[1:33:37] [Applause]
[1:33:39] Come on, somebody. He's after you for
[1:33:42] the wrong thing anyhow. He need to be
[1:33:44] after you cuz you got so much of God in
[1:33:46] you and he's got so much of God in him.
[1:33:48] That is the attraction.
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:33:55] But the devil wants to come and he puts
[1:33:57] all this false beauty out in your face
[1:33:59] and he puts all this false stuff out
[1:34:01] there and he says, "You ain't beautiful.
[1:34:03] You ain't lovely. Look how ugly you are.
[1:34:05] Look at your face. Look at your nose."
[1:34:07] And he points out all the faults and all
[1:34:09] the failures and all of this
[1:34:11] nonsense. Cuz why is he pointing it out?
[1:34:14] Cuz he don't want you to see the real
[1:34:16] beauty on the inside. And that's that
[1:34:19] seed of God he put in your world, in
[1:34:21] your soul before the foundation of the
[1:34:24] world.
[1:34:26] That's the real beauty of a heart, of a
[1:34:28] life, is a seed on the inside.
[1:34:33] Cuz natural beauty is temporary.
[1:34:37] It's limited.
[1:34:41] That's true.
[1:34:43] Listen, me just deal with this right now
[1:34:46] because Satan puts all his beauty out
[1:34:48] there, but they ain't satisfied with
[1:34:50] that beauty.
[1:34:52] A man gets attracted to that stuff.
[1:34:57] And he's like,
[1:35:00] "Woo, hello.
[1:35:04] Well, I can really get into some stuff
[1:35:06] right now, but I better watch myself."
[1:35:12] And all of a sudden, one day he wakes up
[1:35:14] and she didn't put her makeup on before
[1:35:15] he got
[1:35:17] up. It's like, "Who are you and what did
[1:35:19] you do with my wife?
[1:35:23] All of a sudden, it begins to become
[1:35:24] wrinkled and gayheaded and he starts
[1:35:26] looking for another beauty because it's
[1:35:29] a limited beauty and that's what
[1:35:30] attracted him and that's what he's
[1:35:31] searching for and that's what he wants.
[1:35:33] Why? Because he has that sinful lustful
[1:35:36] nature on the inside of him.
[1:35:41] Come
[1:35:42] on. But we ought to be careful what we
[1:35:45] say one to another. It ought to be words
[1:35:48] of encouragement. We ought to love one
[1:35:51] another. Why? Cuz God loved you when you
[1:35:54] wasn't lovable.
[1:35:58] God loved you when you was a
[1:36:00] slimeball. You was a nothing. You was a
[1:36:07] nad. Can I just say it plainly? He loved
[1:36:10] you when you was ugly as homemade
[1:36:13] soap or worse cuz you was coated around
[1:36:16] with all kind of sin and iniquity on
[1:36:19] your life and you look so
[1:36:21] undesirable. Meanwhile, Satan's over
[1:36:23] there saying, "You're beautiful." Woo,
[1:36:24] you're
[1:36:26] beautiful. But God's looking to say,
[1:36:28] "That's not the beauty I desire, but I
[1:36:31] want you to understand you're
[1:36:32] wonderfully and beautifully made.
[1:36:37] I fashioned you just like I wanted to.
[1:36:45] God made you just like he wanted to.
[1:36:49] And he brought this one together, this
[1:36:51] one together, this one together, this
[1:36:52] one together, this one together. Watched
[1:36:53] over this one in a storm or watched over
[1:36:55] this one. Kept him from a wreck. Watched
[1:36:56] over this one in a war so this can come
[1:36:58] over here and give me this and this and
[1:37:00] this and this one. and we want to come
[1:37:02] down and we look at ourselves in the
[1:37:04] mirror and we say, "Man, I'm so ugly."
[1:37:09] You're made in the image of God.
[1:37:14] So, who you calling ugly?
[1:37:20] Thank you, Lord. That was pretty good.
[1:37:22] Thank
[1:37:23] you. That's in honor of our brother
[1:37:26] Daryl Ward.
[1:37:31] We we we look at ourselves so
[1:37:35] undesirable sometimes. Some people look
[1:37:37] at themselves too desirable. But that's
[1:37:39] another another
[1:37:40] place. Some some of them look at
[1:37:43] themselves. I I done got stuck in this
[1:37:44] thing. Brother, help me
[1:37:51] out. Some of you boys I just go that
[1:37:53] way. It says, "Some of you boys think
[1:37:56] you God's scent blessing.
[1:38:00] Some of you boys spend more time in
[1:38:02] front of a mirror than a girl does. You
[1:38:04] ought to be ashamed of that nonsense.
[1:38:06] I'm just be honest with you. You got
[1:38:09] less hair, less
[1:38:12] looks, and you over
[1:38:16] there. How long I ain't going to ask how
[1:38:18] long it took you to get ready for church
[1:38:20] this morning.
[1:38:24] When I'm trying to attract somebody,
[1:38:26] brother Timothy, that's what I'm trying
[1:38:27] to look my best. Well, you know how you
[1:38:30] look your best is a life surrendered to
[1:38:32] Jesus
[1:38:34] Christ. That's how you look your
[1:38:37] best. Sure, I'm not saying you ought to
[1:38:40] dress like a, you know, just like a hag
[1:38:42] or or a bum on the street. That's not
[1:38:44] what I'm talking about. But put it where
[1:38:46] it really
[1:38:47] belongs. Let me give my best to Jesus
[1:38:50] Christ. Let me give my heart to him.
[1:38:53] Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all
[1:38:56] of this will be added unto
[1:39:01] you. You seek God with all your heart.
[1:39:03] You'll find somebody that's seeking God
[1:39:05] with all their heart. And there'll be a
[1:39:07] deep that calls to a deep. There'll be a
[1:39:09] deep to respond.
[1:39:15] Boy, I got all that from unto him that
[1:39:17] loved us.
[1:39:20] Mercy unto him that loved us. He loved
[1:39:24] you when you didn't love him.
[1:39:29] Yeah, it's kind of hard for humans to do
[1:39:31] is to love somebody that don't love
[1:39:32] them.
[1:39:36] Come on now. Amen. But he loved us when
[1:39:39] we were unlovable and he washed us from
[1:39:41] our sins in his own blood. Brother Rand
[1:39:43] would say it like this. He said the word
[1:39:45] washed means loosed.
[1:39:50] I love that word right there. Loosed us
[1:39:53] from our sins and his own blood. Isn't
[1:39:55] that wonderful? He said, "If you're
[1:39:57] spiritually minded, did you catch it?"
[1:39:58] It was his own blood that loosed us
[1:40:01] completely from our sins. It was not
[1:40:03] human blood. It was the blood of God.
[1:40:06] Peter called it the blood of Christ.
[1:40:07] Paul called it the blood of the Lord,
[1:40:09] the blood of Jesus. Not three persons,
[1:40:11] but one person. There's that revelation
[1:40:13] again. One God. that omnipotent Jehovah
[1:40:16] God came down and made himself a body by
[1:40:19] means of the virgin birth and indwelt it
[1:40:21] that it might be the blood of God that
[1:40:23] would free us, loose us entirely from
[1:40:26] our sins and present us spotless before
[1:40:29] him with exceedingly joy.
[1:40:32] Woo! Glory to God. It goes back to the
[1:40:35] Old Testament. He says, "Let's go back
[1:40:37] to the Garden of Eden. When the news
[1:40:39] came from glory that Adam was lost, did
[1:40:41] God send an angel? Did he send a son?
[1:40:44] Did he send another one? Or did he send
[1:40:46] another one like unto us? No. He came
[1:40:48] himself to redeem the lost son. God did
[1:40:51] not entrust his plan of salvation to
[1:40:54] another. He trusted only himself. And
[1:40:56] God was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:40:59] and redeemed us unto himself. We're
[1:41:01] saved by the blood of God. The eternal
[1:41:04] God and dwelt a mortal body in order to
[1:41:06] take away sin, to become a lamb, in
[1:41:08] order to shed his blood and enter into
[1:41:10] the veil with it. Consider this. Since
[1:41:13] it's a perfect blood of God, it is a
[1:41:15] perfect blood. And if it's a perfect
[1:41:17] blood, it loosens us from the power. It
[1:41:20] loosens us from the bondage and the
[1:41:23] defilement of sin.
[1:41:26] You say, "Well, I've got a defiled
[1:41:28] life." Well, if you'll come under this
[1:41:30] blood, it'll loose you from that
[1:41:31] defilement. And loosen is perfect and
[1:41:34] complete. There is now no condemnation.
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:39] Who shall lay charge to God's elect? It
[1:41:42] is God that justify. Who is he that
[1:41:44] condemnth? It is Christ that died.
[1:41:48] Devil, you didn't die for me, but you're
[1:41:52] going to die because of me.
[1:41:58] Hallelujah. He didn't die for me, but
[1:42:01] he's going to die because of me. Because
[1:42:04] everything he tried to put on me, it's
[1:42:06] going to roll back on him.
[1:42:15] This blood has loosed us. There is no
[1:42:17] condemnation. There is nothing. Somebody
[1:42:20] say nothing. There is nothing to be
[1:42:22] condemned for cuz the blood has loosed
[1:42:24] us from sin. Don't listen to man. Listen
[1:42:27] to the word.
[1:42:30] You are loosed by the blood.
[1:42:35] You know what that blood also did for
[1:42:37] us? Continue on. And he made us kings
[1:42:41] and priests.
[1:42:45] This blood changed our position.
[1:42:54] Hallelujah. This blood changed our
[1:42:56] position. It's exactly what happened in
[1:42:58] Esther's
[1:42:59] day. Hello. I lose you for a minute.
[1:43:02] Esther was there as a as a
[1:43:06] queen and Mori was out there facing
[1:43:09] death and Hmon was trying to get him.
[1:43:12] But one night the king got restless and
[1:43:14] he couldn't he couldn't sleep and he
[1:43:15] said, "Bring me the book of remembrance.
[1:43:18] Bring me those chronicles back." And
[1:43:20] when the book was
[1:43:25] opened because I want you to understand
[1:43:27] when that blood was shed on Calvary, it
[1:43:29] released a life.
[1:43:32] And that life would go into Acts two and
[1:43:34] then it would go down through church
[1:43:35] ages. But then it would come back to us
[1:43:37] again in the same power, the same
[1:43:40] resurrection, the same Christ. When when
[1:43:43] the book was open,
[1:43:47] come on now. When the book was open, it
[1:43:50] gave us authority and power again
[1:43:52] because we can now see who we really
[1:43:54] are.
[1:43:57] I I look at that book, Brother Andrew,
[1:43:59] and I say, "Well, I never was a son of
[1:44:01] Satan. I never did belong to the devil."
[1:44:04] Look at here. I always belong to God.
[1:44:08] And when the book was open, they
[1:44:09] realized, Amen, something had been play
[1:44:12] misplaced and it had been missed for a
[1:44:14] long time, but it was brought back at
[1:44:17] the right time.
[1:44:19] Come on now. And it was mentioned there
[1:44:21] in Mori how he saved the king's life.
[1:44:24] And what happened at the opening of the
[1:44:26] book? Position swap.
[1:44:32] All of a sudden, the gallows that Hmon
[1:44:35] had made for Quotai, Hmon is hanging on
[1:44:37] the gallows.
[1:44:40] The robe that Hmon thought he was going
[1:44:42] to wear and wanted to wear and dreamed
[1:44:44] of wearing and the power that he wanted
[1:44:46] and he dreamed of was now Mori.
[1:44:51] Come on, somebody. The devil tried to
[1:44:54] set a trap for you.
[1:44:57] He tried to come and bring you down into
[1:44:59] death and bring you down into sins, but
[1:45:02] there was a book that was
[1:45:04] open. And your name was found written
[1:45:07] therein. And the Hmon had built gallows
[1:45:10] for you. He had dreamed of what you have
[1:45:13] and what you've been afforded. But at
[1:45:15] the opening of that
[1:45:17] book,
[1:45:20] swap. You were who once bound for hell
[1:45:23] is now bound for heaven. He who once
[1:45:26] wanted heaven is now bound for hell.
[1:45:34] We are made kings and priests.
[1:45:37] He's given us a position. A king is no
[1:45:40] king unless he has authority.
[1:45:46] But he made you
[1:45:48] this. He swapped the
[1:45:56] power. Oh, devil's like, "What
[1:46:00] happened?" I said, "I would have sinned.
[1:46:03] I would be like most God." And now I'm
[1:46:06] watching the people of sin that I've
[1:46:08] tried to keep beating down. And I've
[1:46:10] tried to keep down in the dumps and down
[1:46:12] in beaten condition. I'm I'm watching
[1:46:14] all of a sudden young people that's
[1:46:15] rising up and what's happening. I tell
[1:46:18] you what's happening, devil. They saw
[1:46:20] their name in the
[1:46:23] book. They realize this wasn't just so
[1:46:25] and so's lamb or brother Window's lamb
[1:46:29] or but they realize he died for us all.
[1:46:37] He's delivered us from the power of
[1:46:39] darkness. He's made us priests which is
[1:46:43] offer as priest unto him is offering a
[1:46:45] spiritual praise with sanctified
[1:46:48] lips. Hello.
[1:46:51] There you go devil. I got a right to
[1:46:53] praise my Lord.
[1:47:04] Do you realize what has happened?
[1:47:07] Lucifer was a angel of worship. He was a
[1:47:10] worship of praise.
[1:47:14] Come on, somebody. But he lost and he
[1:47:17] gave up his position and he came down to
[1:47:19] bring sin upon the
[1:47:21] earth. But now the blood has changed it
[1:47:24] to where now you have been placed in
[1:47:26] that position. That's why I have a right
[1:47:29] to praise him.
[1:47:32] It ain't because I got it on my own or
[1:47:34] or brother Windle gave it to me or your
[1:47:36] pastor gave it to you or he don't give
[1:47:38] it to you. Amen. I got a right. Praise
[1:47:41] him because the blood gave it to me. God
[1:47:44] gave me that God-given right. And I will
[1:47:46] not bow. I will not back up. I will
[1:47:49] praise my God for all that he's done in
[1:47:52] my life.
[1:48:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And this closing
[1:48:04] a little bit right now. I want you to
[1:48:06] understand the blood there's a the blood
[1:48:08] also has a voice.
[1:48:12] When Abel's blood was shed, Amen. The
[1:48:15] spirit of the Lord came down and began
[1:48:16] to speak to Cain. He said, "Where's your
[1:48:18] brother?" And he said, "Well, I I don't
[1:48:20] know." He said, "Well, your your
[1:48:21] brother's blood speaketh from the
[1:48:22] ground."
[1:48:24] Paul would pick it up and he'd say, he'd
[1:48:26] say, 'The blood of Abel, yes, speaketh.
[1:48:28] He said, 'But there's another blood that
[1:48:29] speaketh greater things.
[1:48:33] Hallelujah.
[1:48:38] There's a greater blood that speaketh
[1:48:40] that greater thing. What did Abel's
[1:48:41] blood speak? It spoke of guilt. It spoke
[1:48:43] of murder. It spoke of all kind of
[1:48:46] unbelief and fears and anxieties and
[1:48:48] things that would cause a man to get so
[1:48:50] in such a condition that he would kill
[1:48:51] his own brother. It spoke of all kinds
[1:48:53] of things. But there was another blood
[1:48:55] that came.
[1:48:59] And this blood speaks greater things.
[1:49:02] Amen. It speaks of healing. It speaks of
[1:49:06] joy. It speaks of power. It speaks of
[1:49:09] life. It speaks of heaven. It speaks of
[1:49:12] freedom. It says you're not guilty no
[1:49:15] more. It says you're justified as though
[1:49:18] you never done it in the first place.
[1:49:22] You don't have to carry not one more
[1:49:24] service.
[1:49:25] [Applause]
[1:49:30] I believe we're having a prayer line
[1:49:32] tonight, right? Well, let's just go on
[1:49:33] and just make sure there ain't no
[1:49:34] condemnation left in this building.
[1:49:38] What kind of prayer line could we have
[1:49:40] if there ain't no condemnation in this
[1:49:45] building? Hallelujah. That you're not
[1:49:48] walking through I'm not worthy. I'm not
[1:49:50] worthy. I'm not worthy. I've done this.
[1:49:53] I done this. There's a blood that spoke
[1:49:55] for you.
[1:49:58] I'm not worthy. Sure. But I have a
[1:50:00] worthy sacrifice. I have an atonement
[1:50:03] that paid every sin. Therefore, I can
[1:50:05] lift up my hands and say, "You said it.
[1:50:08] I believe it. You said it. It belongs to
[1:50:11] me. I'm free. I'm forgiven. It's over
[1:50:14] with. There's no shame on me.
[1:50:18] My sickness is gone. My sins are
[1:50:21] forgiven. I have been made righteous by
[1:50:23] the blood of Jesus
[1:50:25] Christ. Satan, take your hands off of
[1:50:28] me.
[1:50:31] [Applause]
[1:50:32] Come on, somebody. Why don't you put
[1:50:35] your mouth to work right now? Why don't
[1:50:37] you put your voice to work right now and
[1:50:39] say, "Satan, take your hands off of me.
[1:50:44] I'm a godgiven rights to praise and
[1:50:47] worship a king of kings and a lord of
[1:50:50] lords. He's paid the price. He's went to
[1:50:53] Calvary. He's risen again. He showed he
[1:50:56] not only had power over sins. He had
[1:50:59] power over the grave.
[1:51:02] Yes, sir.
[1:51:06] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the m
[1:51:09] musicians he
[1:51:14] call. He broke the back of
[1:51:19] death. Brother Brandham was in Portland,
[1:51:23] Oregon and a maniac came up began to
[1:51:26] make a
[1:51:28] challenge said I'll throw you out into
[1:51:30] the car. You know made all kind of
[1:51:31] challenges. I'll beat you. I'll do
[1:51:35] this. And he said, hawkked and spit in
[1:51:38] his
[1:51:39] face, you know, brother Adams, he said,
[1:51:41] I felt sorry for the
[1:51:44] man. That's a good place to start. Just
[1:51:46] start feeling sorry for your
[1:51:49] enemy. Satan's got to kind of get him
[1:51:52] trapped into something. Just start
[1:51:54] feel so sorry that you're in that
[1:51:57] condition. There's a way out. He said,
[1:51:59] "I was about to speak and he said
[1:52:01] because you challenged the army of the
[1:52:03] the living
[1:52:04] God, you'll fall at my
[1:52:07] feet." He said, "That man went to rare
[1:52:09] back and he fell down, rolled down.
[1:52:11] He'll cross his
[1:52:13] feet and the policeman run up and said,
[1:52:15] "Is he delivered?" He said, "No." He
[1:52:17] said, "He worships that
[1:52:21] spirit."
[1:52:22] Self self had gotten away. He worshiped
[1:52:25] that spirit and it was a limited spirit.
[1:52:29] I love that last night. It was a limit.
[1:52:31] Woo. Come on now. If you'll start coming
[1:52:34] to the prayer line realizing your enemy
[1:52:36] is
[1:52:38] [Applause]
[1:52:48] limited. He said, "No, he's not
[1:52:50] delivered, but will you just kindly roll
[1:52:52] him off of my feet?" rolled him off his
[1:52:55] feet and he walked back to the pull pit
[1:52:56] and he said now as I was
[1:52:58] saying. Faith is a substance of things
[1:53:00] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[1:53:03] seen. And he said about that time a man
[1:53:04] in a wheelchair jumped up and somebody
[1:53:06] in the cot jumped up. He said within
[1:53:08] about five minutes time everyone in the
[1:53:10] building was delivered. He said why? He
[1:53:13] said because the chief of that tribe of
[1:53:15] demons had made a challenge.
[1:53:18] Oh, I feel the spirit of God right now.
[1:53:21] Amen. And the chief of that tribe of
[1:53:22] demons had made a challenge and he lost.
[1:53:29] [Applause]
[1:53:33] He said, "And when the chief lost,
[1:53:35] everything under him
[1:53:38] fell." I want you to understand the
[1:53:41] chief of the tribe of Satan, death
[1:53:43] itself,
[1:53:45] lost. It lost. It tried to seal him in a
[1:53:48] tube. It tried to put Romans around him.
[1:53:51] It tried to hold him
[1:53:53] in. Let me tell you, listen. He didn't
[1:53:55] roll that stone away for his own
[1:53:57] benefit. He could have walked away and
[1:53:59] left that stone standing there, but he
[1:54:01] rolled that stone away so you would know
[1:54:03] and so that the devil would know he was
[1:54:06] risen. And that chief of that tribe of
[1:54:10] demons fell. Therefore, every devil I
[1:54:13] want to serve notice again this morning.
[1:54:15] Devil, every devil under the death
[1:54:18] itself is
[1:54:21] defeated. Hallelujah. Is defeated. I
[1:54:25] said is defeated. Your enemy is
[1:54:30] dead. Come on, Mariam. Your enemy is
[1:54:36] dead. He tried to come through the
[1:54:38] blood, but he couldn't make it. Your
[1:54:41] enemy is dead. You have a right to sing
[1:54:44] a new song. You have a right to praise
[1:54:46] your God.
[1:54:53] I want to put my voice with a prophet
[1:54:55] right now. House of hell,
[1:54:59] give way to the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:03] [Music]
[1:55:05] Every house of conflicts, every house of
[1:55:08] fear, every suicide spirit, every demon,
[1:55:12] give way to the name of Jesus
[1:55:15] Christ. Let there be victory in the
[1:55:18] house of God. For who the son is set
[1:55:20] free,
[1:55:23] how many is free this morning? Who the
[1:55:25] son is set free is free indeed.
[1:55:32] Now, why don't you just lift up those
[1:55:34] holy
[1:55:35] hands and go to open up those sanctified
[1:55:39] lips and give praise to a God, who paid
[1:55:43] it all.
[1:55:48] Come on now. Give praise to a God who
[1:55:52] paid it all. Give praise to a champion
[1:55:55] who hasn't never lost a battle.
[1:55:59] He's not lost the battle. He's not going
[1:56:01] to lose you. He's not going to lose one
[1:56:03] seat of his. He's not going to lose one
[1:56:05] predestinated son, one predestinated
[1:56:07] daughter. Won't you give praise to that
[1:56:12] God? Oh, come on. You praise more than
[1:56:15] ball. I'm talking about open your mouth
[1:56:17] and praise the living
[1:56:19] God. Lift up your voice. Say, "God, I

[2:08:57] The fact is you always were a son and
[2:09:00] daughter of
[2:09:01] God. And you're not a son and daughter
[2:09:03] of God because you're raised in
[2:09:05] church or that your mom and dad are

[2:09:12] God because God's your
[2:09:15] dad. Well, that's simply

[2:09:40] God opening up the mystery of who you
[2:09:43] are to let you know what other ages just
[2:09:47] didn't quite understand. to let you
[2:09:51] know in this most evil age where Satan
[2:09:54] is vowing to take you into the
[2:09:57] tribulation and ultimately to hell where
[2:10:00] God was going to open the revelation to
[2:10:04] you that you are a son and there is
[2:10:08] nothing that the powers of hell in this
[2:10:11] evil age can do to
[2:10:15] anal. Hallelujah.
[2:10:26] Hallelujah. Well, glory to
[2:10:28] [Music]
[2:10:30] God.
[2:10:32] [Music]
[2:10:34] Hallelujah. God wants you to start
[2:10:36] acting like
[2:10:38] sons. He wants you to have a confidence
[2:10:41] of a
[2:10:43] daughter. Can you say amen?
[2:10:46] Did you enjoy the word of the Lord here
[2:10:48] this
[2:10:49] [Music]
[2:10:51] morning? Hallelujah.
