[27:53] trust you've had a a good day today I
[27:55] know like brother Merl said we might be
[27:57] weary and body but strong in spirit and
[28:00] I believe if we're willing to press
[28:02] through tonight the Lord can speak to
[28:03] Heart speak to needs whatever our desire
[28:06] is amen well if you would have your
[28:08] Bibles let's open our scriptures to
[28:10] Ephesians 2 and
[28:17] 4 amen it is good to be back home I know
[28:20] we've been home a couple services but
[28:23] it's it's good to be back home there's
[28:25] no place like home that's for sure you
[28:27] hear you hear it said a lot by ministers
[28:30] that their favorite places to preach is
[28:31] at home and that's true for me I always
[28:33] enjoy preaching at home and so it is
[28:36] it's good to be here tonight and Lord
[28:38] willing on Sunday evening I'm going to
[28:40] do a mission report of my trip in
[28:42] Nicaragua I know there's a few that's
[28:44] always asking about trips and so I
[28:46] apologize for not doing that more often
[28:48] but Lord willing I'll I'll try to give a
[28:50] small report on Sunday just to show a
[28:53] few pictures and things and I know I
[28:55] appreciate y'all's prayers and y'all
[28:56] support as we do travel and things but
[28:59] Ephesians 2 and 4 but God who is rich in
[29:03] Mercy for his great love wherein he
[29:06] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[29:09] hath quickened us together with Christ
[29:11] by Grace ye are saved and ra raised us
[29:15] up together and has made us set in
[29:17] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen can
[29:20] we bow our heads tonight dear gracious
[29:23] Heavenly Father Lord what an honor it is
[29:25] God to come into your house Lord God may
[29:28] we never take it lightly father that we
[29:30] have this opportunity Lord a place where
[29:33] we can come in a freedom of worship Lord
[29:35] and just to lay aside our trials and our
[29:37] troubles Lord but God as we come to this
[29:40] part of the service we ask that you
[29:42] would just just feel welcome among us
[29:44] tonight Lord you see the simple thought
[29:46] you've placed upon My Heart Lord may it
[29:48] be an encouragement in some way and
[29:50] strengthen and edify father Lord we just
[29:53] commit the service into your hands in
[29:55] jesus' name amen you may be seated
[29:59] tonight and this is just a simple
[30:01] subject but while I was in Nicaragua um
[30:04] the Lord sort of G gave me this here as
[30:07] I was ministering there so I hope hope
[30:09] it' be okay if I just preach some of it
[30:10] tonight but it would be on atmosphere
[30:13] and brother Brandon would say in perfect
[30:15] faith and I've read it here before but
[30:18] it's a powerful quote he would say but
[30:20] Jesus lived in a world that no one knew
[30:22] about he was an odd person he lived in a
[30:25] world of perfect faith in the perfect
[30:27] God in which he was if we lived in a
[30:30] perfect faith of a Christian that's what
[30:33] we are we'd be Mystic to the world the
[30:35] people don't understand you you walk in
[30:38] the spirit what what the spirit say you
[30:40] would do what it forbid you would not do
[30:43] then the people begin to say you'd be a
[30:45] Mystic person then that's the way it is
[30:48] with all believers they're a Mystic
[30:50] they're Mystic people don't understand
[30:53] because they live in a world to
[30:55] themselves and Jesus lived in a world
[30:57] that nobody else could touch the
[30:58] disciples didn't understand him when he
[31:01] spoke to them they said that what are
[31:03] you talking in riddles we don't
[31:05] understand this how can it be see there
[31:08] wasn't in the world that he lived in
[31:10] they couldn't understand him nobody
[31:13] could understand him and when a man
[31:15] lives by faith and walks by faith I mean
[31:18] substance Faith he is isolated from the
[31:21] entire world and becomes a new creature
[31:23] in Christ then now you're getting into
[31:26] bride material see you're getting into a
[31:29] rapturing condition now that means for
[31:31] each one of us not just the pastor or
[31:33] the deacons or trustees that means for
[31:36] the leoty every individual walks in the
[31:39] world alone with God you're baptized
[31:41] into the kingdom and there's nobody in
[31:43] there but you and God see he gives the
[31:46] orders you pack them out whatever he
[31:48] says there's no Shadow of Doubt anywhere
[31:51] you walk right on if the Lord says this
[31:53] there's nobody in the world can talk you
[31:56] out of it you go right on just the same
[31:58] now you're coming into perfect Faith
[32:01] perfect Perfection that cannot fail that
[32:04] faith never fails and I thought that was
[32:06] so powerful that we walk in a world
[32:09] isolated uh from everybody else but it's
[32:12] just you and God and brother Brandon and
[32:14] I love it how he's putting it that we're
[32:16] walking by substance faith it ain't an
[32:19] intellectual faith it ain't something
[32:21] mind over matter but it's a substance
[32:24] that that that a revelation has given
[32:26] you and it's and this place is only for
[32:29] the bride because brother Brandon would
[32:31] tell us that we're getting into bride
[32:33] material now that's what separates us I
[32:36] believe from the church world and you as
[32:38] the bride of Christ is we've been called
[32:40] into Heavenly places I I believe we've
[32:43] been called into an atmosphere where
[32:45] you're alone with God and I think it's
[32:47] pretty incredible how brother brand is
[32:50] putting it that we've been invited into
[32:52] a place that not even the disciples
[32:55] could go into he says when Jesus would
[32:58] speak even though it was in their
[32:59] language it was in riddles you know so
[33:02] even though it was confusing to the
[33:04] disciples Jesus had perfect
[33:06] understanding of who he was where he was
[33:10] the uh uh uh the the what he was to
[33:12] perform what he was to produced so in
[33:14] this other world that Jesus was walking
[33:17] in the mystery was was clear it wasn't
[33:20] confusion it wasn't you know he knew
[33:23] what his position was and with Jesus
[33:25] knowing who he was he knew that there
[33:28] was potential that laid inside of him
[33:31] that he was to produce cuz you know what
[33:33] what is a thought it's a it's
[33:35] potentially a word but in order for that
[33:38] potential to be expressed it's got to go
[33:40] from a thought to a word and what is a
[33:42] word it's an action in potential form
[33:45] you know so once the word was written
[33:48] then those potentials could be
[33:50] manifested then the word would come
[33:52] inside of Jesus then those potentials
[33:54] would no longer be a thought no longer a
[33:57] word but now it is an action so Jesus
[34:00] knew that he was on the earth with
[34:02] potentials and he had to produce these
[34:04] things and before Isaiah would say a
[34:07] virgin shall conceive it was in the mind
[34:10] of God then whenever he would say that
[34:12] it would come into word form but there
[34:14] had to be a body that would take the
[34:17] word and produce the potentials of it
[34:20] and so by Jesus knowing who he was he
[34:23] knew what he was to produce and brother
[34:25] Brandon would say this now no to see by
[34:28] it when he stood and said if you destroy
[34:31] this body this Temple I'll raise it
[34:33] again in 3 days why he was just as
[34:36] satisfied that he would do it because
[34:39] the scripture says he would do it the
[34:41] Messiah I'll not leave a soul in Hell
[34:44] neither will I leave my my Holy One to
[34:46] see corruption a prophet who the word
[34:48] comes to had said that that would happen
[34:51] and he knew who he was that person and I
[34:55] thought that was powerful whenever I
[34:56] read that because here is deity Jesus
[34:59] Christ was pointing back to a prophet
[35:01] with with Fallen uh with a fallen nature
[35:04] with with with human mistakes you know
[35:06] but he was pointing back to that
[35:08] prophet's word and says I am the
[35:11] potential I am the manifestation of that
[35:14] prophet's word and I thought that's what
[35:16] we are to do in this generation Jesus
[35:18] was our example that would say search
[35:20] the scriptures and in them testify of
[35:23] who I am there was no condemnation
[35:26] against him that he had found his
[35:28] position and I believe we can be
[35:30] satisfied in knowing that we are who
[35:33] Malachi 4 was talking about we are the
[35:36] one that the message has come to to
[35:38] produce the life in this generation Luke
[35:42] 4:18 would say the spirit of the Lord is
[35:44] upon me because Heath anointed me to
[35:47] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[35:49] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[35:51] preach Deliverance to the captives and
[35:53] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[35:55] at Liberty them that are bruised and so
[35:58] Jesus was just picking up prophecy and
[36:01] acting it out and and I think I think
[36:04] what is so incredible is brother Brandon
[36:06] would tell us that Jesus would not quote
[36:08] all of that prophecy he would only do
[36:11] half of it then would stop and would say
[36:13] this day the scripture is fulfilled
[36:16] brother Brandon would tell us why that
[36:18] it it was not time for that scripture to
[36:21] be fulfilled the second part of that
[36:23] scripture was concerning is his second
[36:26] coming so you can look at the
[36:28] discernment that Jesus would have he
[36:30] would look at the word and and would
[36:32] discern that this is the alloted portion
[36:35] for this time and I believe that the
[36:37] bride has got a discernment that we can
[36:40] look at the word and see what is my
[36:43] portion to produce you see Jesus knew
[36:46] that this ain't the time for that to be
[36:48] produced yet you know and I believe that
[36:50] we can look at the scripture and find
[36:52] yourself in the book and say this is
[36:55] what I'm to produce I'm not producing
[36:57] this you see if you find that you're the
[36:59] bride of Christ you're no longer
[37:01] worrying if you're serpen SE right if
[37:03] you find that you're the bride of Christ
[37:05] and you're going to make a Rapture
[37:06] you're no longer worried if you're a
[37:08] tribulation Saint it's discernment in
[37:11] the word of God that is found your
[37:13] position and then you act upon it and
[37:16] you let those potentials just start to
[37:19] manifest itself and brother Brandon
[37:21] would say whatever he said God honored
[37:24] what he said think of that Jesus said
[37:26] and God brought brought it to pass so he
[37:28] knew that his words were God's words now
[37:32] look that same scripture comes back to
[37:34] us again if you say to this mountain oh
[37:38] my just let that soak just a little bit
[37:40] and so that same thing applies to us
[37:43] Jesus knew if he was in the will of God
[37:46] his words was the same as deity himself
[37:50] and the same thing with the bride of
[37:52] Christ when you get in the will of God
[37:54] for your life you know what you speak is
[37:57] what the spirit is saying you see your
[38:00] your confession is not different than
[38:02] the word of God but what the word says
[38:04] you say it and then your word is the
[38:07] same as God himself because we're not
[38:09] twisting the word we're not adding our
[38:11] own ideas or our own opinions but our
[38:14] confession is the same as the word has
[38:17] been brought to us oh Hallelujah and so
[38:21] we have uh faith in who we are and and
[38:24] brother Brandon would say no one can do
[38:26] anything unless you know what you're
[38:29] doing and you got to know your position
[38:32] so once you know what you're doing and
[38:34] what you to produce then there is a
[38:36] faith that puts you into action and
[38:39] brother Brandon would talk about
[38:41] Potentials in in in the Easter seal he
[38:43] would talk about it a lot and he would
[38:45] say that we've had a resurrection now
[38:48] and since we have one now if we go by
[38:51] the way of the Grave we can have one
[38:53] then you see we've potentially already
[38:56] raised up again and if we go by the way
[38:58] of the Grave The Same Spirit that has
[39:01] quickened us now is going to bring them
[39:03] back out of the grave and I believe that
[39:05] the word is a seed it's potentials but
[39:08] the same spirit that has quickened us
[39:10] and has brought us to Life The Same
[39:13] Spirit whenever the word comes across
[39:15] the pulpit or comes across the tape
[39:17] player that same Spirit can grab it grab
[39:20] that seed grab that potential and bring
[39:23] it into manifestation where we're not
[39:25] just dead church members we're not just
[39:27] layer of sin walking around in confusion
[39:30] but the same God that has refilled us
[39:33] with the Holy Ghost and brought his life
[39:35] on the inside is picking up the word and
[39:38] bringing it into manifestation and you
[39:41] see brother Brandon would say my brother
[39:43] my sister let me say to you this is in
[39:46] Godly fear knowing that I may never live
[39:48] to see anter again but there was one
[39:51] thing sure when a genuine for ordained
[39:54] Son of God by the word of God hears the
[39:57] voice of God he'll raise up and go to
[40:00] meet it's the potentials that's he that
[40:03] he is going to meet the Living Word as
[40:05] he as he was the bride will meet the
[40:08] groom she is a part of his body talking
[40:11] about if you go by the way of the Grave
[40:14] he says as sure as you're a
[40:15] predestinated Son of God he's going to
[40:18] rise again because there are potentials
[40:21] laying there and I believe in every one
[40:24] of our life are potentials I don't
[40:26] believe God has called us to be a
[40:28] potentially the bride of Christ or or
[40:30] potentially an overcomer but God has
[40:33] called us to put it into manifestation
[40:36] and you can look at the the little Eagle
[40:38] that was in the Barnard he was always an
[40:40] eagle but he the potentials was laying
[40:43] there all the time even though he was
[40:45] walking around with the chickens and
[40:47] eating like the chickens all he needed
[40:49] was Mama's voice to come and bring out
[40:52] the potentials that was laying there and
[40:55] to bring an identity to him
[40:57] that was there all along and I'm so
[41:00] thankful that we would have a message
[41:02] even when we was in confusion and and
[41:04] and and in chaos the word would come
[41:07] over our life and let us know our true
[41:10] identity that there were potentials
[41:12] laying on the inside of us to be an
[41:15] overcomer to to be the bride of Christ
[41:18] to make a Rapture and to see a body
[41:20] change you see it's getting in the right
[41:22] atmosphere the word of God coming and
[41:25] bringing forth the life of the word oh
[41:28] my brother Brandon would say now to you
[41:30] that's here and that that's needing
[41:32] needing of healing in your body how many
[41:35] Believers are here raise your hand I'm a
[41:37] Believer as far as I know in my heart
[41:39] how many possesses it you know beyond
[41:42] the shadow of a doubt that is that's in
[41:44] your heart right now you've been raised
[41:46] from the dead you know it oh my what
[41:49] could happen in a meeting like this then
[41:52] I know I'm late but what could happen
[41:54] right now just think of what could take
[41:57] place face the potentials are laying
[41:59] right in you now ain't that powerful so
[42:02] if you're needing healing the potentials
[42:05] is in you right now but the brand must
[42:07] say the Rapture is in you right now so
[42:10] the potentials of everything is laying
[42:13] inside of you but you need the right
[42:16] atmosphere you see that's why we don't
[42:17] need just some dead theology or or some
[42:20] psychologist to come by and look over us
[42:22] we need an atmosphere that the word of
[42:25] God can fall into and bring forth the
[42:28] life not just at church but at home at
[42:31] school at the job site wherever we are
[42:34] we're leaving in a constant atmosphere
[42:37] that the life of God is constantly being
[42:40] produced oh Hallelujah you see and that
[42:43] should change the way we act that should
[42:45] change the change the way we think of
[42:47] things and and think of how H how we
[42:50] should live if we know that all of the
[42:53] potentials is already in us that should
[42:56] change the way react knowing that
[42:58] somebody's not going to come with a
[43:00] magic wand but I've got something to do
[43:03] you see God has given us his word and
[43:05] his Spirit what what else can God do you
[43:08] know we need to get into get into action
[43:12] the God has given me everything that I
[43:15] need but let me get in the right
[43:17] atmosphere and you see brother Brandon
[43:19] would tell us in in the message parting
[43:21] the church ought to be in million miles
[43:24] up the road and Christ is waiting for
[43:27] for the church just to get ready and you
[43:29] see so the potentials are laying there
[43:32] but we've got something to do you see
[43:35] brother Brandon would tell us that God
[43:37] loves sincerity and he says the reason
[43:40] that the church world is in that
[43:41] condition is because they've lost their
[43:43] sincerity and that really really spoke
[43:45] to my heart as I was reading that cuz
[43:48] brother brandom says they'll they'll
[43:49] come to the church and they'll be
[43:51] chewing bubblegum you know they'll come
[43:53] to the Altar and they're laughing and
[43:55] snickering and and they're hitting one
[43:57] another so even though they're coming
[43:59] inside of a building they're not getting
[44:02] into the atmosphere and you see brother
[44:04] Brandon with would preach in
[44:06] perseverance he would say many people
[44:08] think that once you get to a meeting
[44:10] where Jesus is at the fight is over he
[44:13] talks about the the woman that that that
[44:15] Jesus called her a dog he says once he
[44:18] once she got into the atmosphere of
[44:20] Jesus once what once he she got into his
[44:22] presence she did not stop fighting there
[44:25] he says Jesus looked at her and says
[44:28] you're a dog and she didn't get
[44:30] discouraged but she stopped and she said
[44:32] that is true but even the dogs get get
[44:36] the crumbs brother brandom says many of
[44:38] us cannot get humble enough just to get
[44:41] the crumbs he says too many people think
[44:43] that just getting to the meeting is all
[44:46] you have to do but you still have to
[44:48] persevere you still have to enter in you
[44:51] see it takes sincerity to say God I'm
[44:55] needing something from you not just
[44:57] coming and hearing a A good sermon or or
[45:00] reading a church age book on on a
[45:01] Wednesday night but let me come in
[45:04] sincerity so that the word can be
[45:06] brought into manifestation you look at
[45:09] Titus 2 and6 uh the Apostle Paul would
[45:12] tell a young men likewise exort to be
[45:15] sober minded in all things showing
[45:17] thyself a good pattern of Good Works in
[45:21] Doctrine showing UNC corruptness gravity
[45:24] and sincerity sound speech that cannot
[45:27] be condemned that he that is of a con
[45:30] the contrary parts may be ashamed having
[45:33] no evil thing to say of you so that's
[45:37] what sincerity does it brings the
[45:39] potentials out of your heart into
[45:42] manifestation but not even the sinner
[45:44] can bring condemnation against you and
[45:47] that is bringing uh making them ashamed
[45:50] is your life because of sincerity and
[45:54] the Apostle Paul is telling us once you
[45:56] get sincerity it's going to affect your
[45:59] speech the way you talk is going to be
[46:01] different the way you live is going to
[46:03] be different what it is is pulling out
[46:06] the potentials that is already laying
[46:08] there and you brother Brandon would talk
[46:10] about zakus and would say sometimes God
[46:13] gets a man to do the ridiculous to see
[46:16] how determined he is to get to Jesus and
[46:20] you know and it's a kid story but he
[46:22] would say zakus he would could not get
[46:24] to Jesus so what he would do is get a
[46:27] trash can and push that trash can up to
[46:30] a tree he says he was doing the
[46:32] ridiculous because he was determined oh
[46:35] my and he and he says how sincere are
[46:38] you to do the ridiculous to get to Jesus
[46:42] so if we really know that the potentials
[46:45] are laying there we'll do whatever it
[46:48] takes to get into the right atmosphere
[46:51] for it to become manifestation if I have
[46:54] to crawl through the dirt or or get on a
[46:56] trash can like zakus I'm going to do
[46:59] whatever it takes to get into the
[47:01] presence of Jesus Christ if I have to
[47:04] get past bitterness get past
[47:05] discouragement whatever it takes I want
[47:08] to get into the right atmosphere so that
[47:11] the Life of Christ can be manifested
[47:14] through my
[47:16] life Hallelujah brother Brandon would
[47:18] say and Men through all ages that's ever
[47:21] tried to achieve something has been
[47:23] persistent man in order to be persistent
[47:27] is to know what you are after and if you
[47:30] do not know you're not certain of where
[47:32] you're standing but when you thoroughly
[47:35] understand what it is and what you're
[47:37] after and are satisfied you're going to
[47:40] get it then you can be persistent I
[47:43] thought that's pretty pretty pretty
[47:45] incredible he says man in order to be
[47:48] persistent you have to know what you are
[47:51] after cuz if you don't know what you're
[47:53] after and if you don't know if you can
[47:55] get it or not there's no point in trying
[47:58] right you know it's like losing weight
[47:59] you know if it's it's in the mind if you
[48:02] truly believe that you can lose weight
[48:05] you're going to jump in and start to do
[48:06] it right but usually that first week
[48:09] you're struggling you're hungry then all
[48:11] of a sudden you tap out mentally right
[48:13] CU you don't think it's possible but
[48:16] even though it's possible your
[48:18] perseverance is going away because you
[48:20] don't think you can do it and brother
[48:22] brandom is saying in order to be
[48:24] perseverant you got to know you can get
[48:27] what you're after you see so if you're
[48:30] looking for Joy or peace you got to know
[48:33] that it's something you can achieve if
[48:35] you want a Revival in your home it's got
[48:38] to be something you know that you can
[48:40] achieve if you want Revival in the
[48:42] church and and your children on fire
[48:44] it's got to be something you know that
[48:47] you can reach and I believe this message
[48:50] has brought to us whatever we or
[48:53] whatever God leads our souls to believe
[48:56] we can have it so if our souls is
[48:58] believing and expecting for a Revival
[49:02] press for it don't give up when you're
[49:04] tired don't give up when you're weary
[49:06] don't give up if it don't happen after
[49:08] the first week but if your soul is
[49:10] looking for something be persevering get
[49:13] in the right atmosphere and say God
[49:15] bring out the potentials I want my
[49:18] children on fire I want my home life on
[49:20] fire I want the power of God in my
[49:23] church like never before if you think
[49:26] you can have it keep fighting for it oh
[49:29] you've got something to do you bring the
[49:32] atmosphere brother the brandom says
[49:34] we're miniature creators right he says
[49:36] you can change the atmosphere too many
[49:38] times you think that the preacher brings
[49:40] a Revival or or Youth Camp brings the
[49:42] Revival but you can bring the Revival if
[49:45] you're looking for the fire of God to
[49:47] flow through these pews once again you
[49:49] change the atmosphere you get here early
[49:52] and say God I'm looking I'm expecting
[49:55] I'm looking for you to move move like
[49:57] never before and that starts to change
[49:59] the atmosphere and it's conditioning you
[50:02] for your promise to be
[50:04] fulfilled oh Hallelujah you see we got
[50:07] to be persevering you see you remember
[50:10] brother the Brandon would talk about the
[50:12] the the the lady with the dead baby and
[50:14] she was standing out there in the rain
[50:16] and brother the brandom say she kept
[50:17] fighting and kept fighting and it was a
[50:20] commotion brother brandom says she he
[50:22] stopped and asked brother brother Jack
[50:24] Moore I believe and says she w know the
[50:27] difference you just go over there and
[50:28] pray for her and as he was going to go
[50:31] pray for her brother the brandom says a
[50:33] vision appeared over him and he seen a
[50:36] baby that was well and was standing and
[50:38] he would say hang on Brother Moore bring
[50:40] the baby to me and what I love about the
[50:42] story is brother Brandon would say there
[50:45] wasn't four 300 ushers that could keep
[50:47] her from getting to brother Brandon it
[50:50] was somebody that knew if I could just
[50:53] get to the prophet let me tell you this
[50:55] the prophet is off of the scene but the
[50:58] same Angel of the Lord is here every
[51:01] service if you're willing to be
[51:03] persevering for a breakthrough if you're
[51:05] willing to be perseverant to see God
[51:08] move like never before let nothing stop
[51:11] you oh my you may say well he seen a
[51:13] vision he he he had a word for her life
[51:16] you see that don't matter too many times
[51:18] we're looking for something Supernatural
[51:21] for us to believe in God again but the
[51:23] same word that was Discerning back then
[51:26] is the same word that can bring forth a
[51:29] a faith and a courage over your life
[51:31] tonight you see we don't need to stand
[51:33] before a Propet we've got the word you
[51:36] know and just to give a quick testimony
[51:39] you know my my sister-in-law one of them
[51:41] was had a had a sickness in her body and
[51:43] she was sitting at home listening to a
[51:45] tape and on that tape there was a
[51:47] discernment that would go forth and
[51:49] brother Brandon would Des ear a life and
[51:51] would say you're healed of it and my
[51:53] sister-in-law was sitting there and she
[51:56] realized that the same condition I she
[51:58] has was just caught out and if that lady
[52:01] was healed of it so can I be healed of
[52:04] it and right there the power of God
[52:07] would bring forth the healing it wasn't
[52:09] a prophet that was Discerning her but
[52:12] the same word that was Discerning in
[52:14] that prayer line is still Discerning
[52:16] today and whatever you have need of you
[52:19] don't need a holy man to come and pray
[52:22] for you you need some perseverance to
[52:24] say God if you are here to tonight I'm
[52:27] willing to do what it takes oh if it's a
[52:30] Sunday morning or a Sunday night get let
[52:33] me get into the right atmosphere oh
[52:36] Hallelujah you see in in another one I I
[52:39] was preaching in in in North Carolina at
[52:42] brother Roberto a a Hispanic church and
[52:44] I was preaching on heaviness and I was
[52:46] reading a quote on how brother Brandon
[52:48] was in a prayer line and would say there
[52:50] there there is a two dark Spirits
[52:52] hanging over you and it's because that
[52:55] you wanted to have a baby and you've had
[52:57] two miscarriage I'm sure y'all y' have
[52:59] heard that heard that quote before and
[53:01] he says there there's there's two
[53:02] Spirits hanging over you and it's
[53:05] because you want a baby and you've had
[53:07] two miscarriages and then brother
[53:09] brandham stops and he says but now you
[53:11] over here you've got an issue and he and
[53:13] he's starting to discern her this
[53:15] person's life over here and this lady's
[53:17] still standing here and and my mind
[53:20] automatically started to think what if
[53:22] she would have lost her faith you know
[53:24] standing there the Lord speaking to her
[53:27] called out her condition but never said
[53:29] she was well but then the spirit of the
[53:31] Lord moved over here but then brother
[53:33] brandom says you're you're healed of
[53:35] that then stops and he says so are you
[53:38] you're healed of that condition and so
[53:40] I'm telling the I'm reading this quote
[53:42] and after the service there's a prayer
[53:44] line and this lady comes up and she says
[53:47] brother Josh i' I've been in heaviness
[53:49] for a long time I wasn't sure what it
[53:52] was but I when you read the quote I had
[53:54] a miscarriage in the past and that same
[53:57] thing happened to me I've been under a
[53:59] heaviness but the same God that
[54:02] delivered her can deliver me it's not a
[54:05] prophet a man it's the prophetic word
[54:08] that is still Discerning lives and if
[54:11] you've got a need the same Jehovah Gyra
[54:14] is walking in the midst of the church
[54:16] today saying if you have a desire be
[54:20] perseverant Hallelujah even when it's
[54:23] not easy be perseverant oh Hallelujah
[54:27] you see brother the brandom he he he
[54:29] would say this here and he would say and
[54:31] the trouble of it now is we don't have
[54:33] people humbling themselves to get some
[54:36] crumbs I didn't get in the line that
[54:38] that don't make any difference just come
[54:40] and see if he's the same yesterday today
[54:44] and forever I'm after some crumbs so he
[54:47] says it don't matter if you're in the
[54:48] line and and you stand before me just
[54:51] coming expecting to see that Jesus
[54:54] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[54:56] for forever and you will get some crumbs
[54:58] go brother Brandon would talk about the
[55:00] Greek Lady and he would say she had
[55:02] never seen a miracle before she had just
[55:04] heard that he could do these things he
[55:07] said she' never seen anything before and
[55:10] and this really spoke to me as a parent
[55:12] because she wasn't coming for her own
[55:14] need she was coming for her child and
[55:17] she didn't care if the preacher called
[55:19] her a dog she knew that my my my my
[55:22] daughter is hanging in the balance and I
[55:25] the Lord give us some more parents like
[55:26] that that don't get Hur over this don't
[55:29] get Hur over that but says God I even if
[55:32] I've never seen this happen before I
[55:34] know you can do it for my child my child
[55:37] is hanging in the balance let me
[55:39] persevere to get into the right
[55:41] atmosphere so my children could have a
[55:44] Revival you see I'm already interceding
[55:46] for my two children they're only one and
[55:48] one and three and I'm already praying
[55:50] and saying God it's impossible for them
[55:52] to be normal unless by God's grace you
[55:55] know I'm praying saying God God let me
[55:57] create an atmosphere in my home when I'm
[56:00] at a hotel room or or in the van let me
[56:03] create an atmosphere that their
[56:05] potentials can bloom don't let me let me
[56:08] push them away in an atmosphere of
[56:11] bitterness or or of gossip and this and
[56:13] that that that atmosphere starts to
[56:15] choke out the potentials but God let me
[56:17] get him in an atmosphere that the
[56:19] potentials that are in the inside of
[56:21] them is blossoming because of his grace
[56:25] I know that's all of you're desires to
[56:27] say God let me get them in the right
[56:30] atmosphere but Brandon would say this it
[56:32] takes the spirit of God to bring life
[56:35] and the life must not come out of just
[56:37] an intellectual Revival it's got to come
[56:39] out of the Bible a word Revival and the
[56:42] word is the same yesterday today and
[56:45] forever and when it falls today and
[56:47] quickens you get the same results you
[56:50] did in Acts 2 you see when the word
[56:53] Falls today and it quickens you get the
[56:55] same results and he says and because
[56:58] it's the spirit of God that conditions
[57:01] the atmosphere and so how do we get an
[57:04] atmosphere is by the spirit of God
[57:07] that's why we come and we come early and
[57:09] we we we get quiet and you know I turn
[57:11] on the tape before I come to church it's
[57:13] getting me in a in a condition that the
[57:16] spirit of God can create an atmosphere
[57:19] that's why brother Brandon going say get
[57:20] here 30 minutes early and pray and and
[57:23] read your Bible it's the spirit of God
[57:25] conditioning you to step into that
[57:28] atmosphere that when the word comes
[57:30] forth you're in an atmosphere that says
[57:33] even though it's crumbs it is mine even
[57:35] though it's a a church AG reading it is
[57:38] mine even though it's a a simple sermon
[57:41] it is mine I'm in the right atmosphere
[57:44] for the potentials to come forth oh
[57:47] little church we got to so good having a
[57:50] pastor that will preach the message of
[57:52] the hour not adding his own ideas his
[57:54] own thoughts but he's bringing forth a
[57:56] seed that drops into your atmosphere
[57:59] that the word can come forth brother
[58:02] Brandon I say if you want an oak tree
[58:04] let me give you an acorn you see it's
[58:06] potential it's potentially an oak tree
[58:10] but it's got to be planted in the right
[58:12] soil you see this word every sermon is
[58:15] seeds that is being thrown out and it's
[58:17] potentials that can fall in your life
[58:20] but it's got to be in the right soil the
[58:23] right atmosphere and as we're in the
[58:25] right ATM atmosphere the seed starts to
[58:28] fall and it manifest itself and and
[58:30] brother Brandon he he he would say this
[58:32] the word is a thought expressed God's
[58:35] thinking expressed it his words through
[58:38] the prophet they wrote the Bible which
[58:40] which is in word form and Jesus called
[58:43] it a seed and any seed will bring forth
[58:46] of its kind in the right condition the
[58:49] right atmosphere and you remember in the
[58:52] rising of the Sun but the Brandon would
[58:54] say that the Earth was over a gloomy
[58:56] atmosphere and he says there were seeds
[58:59] laying there that was dormant and it
[59:01] needed the sunlight to bring those seeds
[59:04] to life and so the sun did not put the
[59:06] seeds there the sun came because the
[59:09] seeds was already there and as that sun
[59:12] came over that atmosphere it pushed back
[59:15] the Gloom in order for that seed to be
[59:18] brought to light and sometimes we get in
[59:20] Gloomy atmospheres sometimes we get
[59:23] discouraged sometimes we get we get hurt
[59:25] but as the Sun the word starts to come
[59:28] over your life let it push back that
[59:30] Gloom brother Brandon must say it is the
[59:32] rising of the sun he said I don't have
[59:34] the quote in front of me but he would
[59:36] say that the rising of the sun there's a
[59:39] dual dual Sunrise whenever the the
[59:42] physical sun came up he says so did the
[59:44] eso wi and he says and those ladies ran
[59:48] and says he is risen and he says that
[59:50] sunlight went to all of the Nations and
[59:54] the people I thought that's powerful cuz
[59:56] this message has went around the world
[59:58] seven times not just to Nations but it
[1:00:01] has went to people it did not just come
[1:00:04] to Oklahoma but it came to PA it came to
[1:00:07] some people that was in atmospheres of
[1:00:09] Doubt atmospheres of Gloom and
[1:00:11] discouragement but as the word came over
[1:00:14] your life it pushed back that Gloom
[1:00:17] pushed back all of those atmospheres so
[1:00:20] that the seed can be brought to life oh
[1:00:23] my that's why we need a need a living
[1:00:26] word Jesus would say my words are spirit
[1:00:29] and they are life not just the mechanics
[1:00:31] but by Dynamics but the life behind that
[1:00:35] word and brother Brandon in the Easter
[1:00:38] seal he would talk about John do he says
[1:00:40] John Doe he was in God's thinking he was
[1:00:43] the attributes of God and he says even
[1:00:46] though it was millions and millions of
[1:00:47] years ago the god thought of him he says
[1:00:50] once he gets into the right atmosphere
[1:00:53] he says even though he's lying even
[1:00:55] though he cheating even though he he's
[1:00:57] doing all of these things but he says
[1:01:00] let him get under the right atmosphere
[1:01:03] he says then Joe John do is bound to
[1:01:05] recognize who his father is oh my he's
[1:01:09] bound to recognize no matter how far in
[1:01:12] sin he was once he got into that right
[1:01:15] atmosphere then it starts to bring a
[1:01:18] realization and that brother Brandon
[1:01:20] would tell us he says it's atmosphere
[1:01:22] that does things and he says the reason
[1:01:24] your men oh reason you men
[1:01:26] always always taught bring your children
[1:01:29] here is because it's the atmosphere for
[1:01:32] them to get the Holy Ghost and that
[1:01:34] really spoke to me John do he says he
[1:01:36] could have been uh in God's mind
[1:01:38] millions and millions of years ago and
[1:01:40] he's lying and he's cheating but in the
[1:01:42] right atmosphere it brings a realization
[1:01:46] who his father is then he says you you
[1:01:48] you fathers bring your children to
[1:01:51] church because in this atmosphere is
[1:01:54] where the Holy Ghost Falls and he in
[1:01:56] that quote he would say some of you saw
[1:01:58] me wink at a young girl he says that was
[1:02:01] my daughter Rebecca and he says I'm glad
[1:02:03] she's here with me because she's needing
[1:02:05] the Holy Ghost and he says in this
[1:02:08] atmosphere she can get the Holy Ghost
[1:02:11] and I thought my we're not bringing our
[1:02:12] children to church in vain cuz we know
[1:02:15] in this atmosphere there's a deep
[1:02:18] calling to a deep you see even when
[1:02:21] they're sick even when they're tired if
[1:02:22] they can come bring them to church and
[1:02:25] let them get in into an atmosphere and
[1:02:27] even at a young age and and brother
[1:02:29] Brandon would say he says that no matter
[1:02:32] if you're Presbyterian if you're Baptist
[1:02:34] if you're Methodist in the right
[1:02:36] atmosphere it'll hatch out a newborn
[1:02:39] child of God claim the word it's the
[1:02:42] atmosphere that does it no matter the
[1:02:45] denomination tag you have on it so it
[1:02:48] don't matter the denominational tag they
[1:02:50] might not know know anything about the
[1:02:53] move of God but if there is somebody
[1:02:55] that does know something about it and
[1:02:57] create an atmosphere then somebody that
[1:03:00] don't have a clue can step into that and
[1:03:03] I thought M that's what we do as parents
[1:03:05] our children don't know anything we're
[1:03:07] raising them up but we do have
[1:03:10] understanding we do got Revelation even
[1:03:13] when they don't our Revelation is
[1:03:16] creating a Haven creating an atmosphere
[1:03:19] that you're the the TR we're training up
[1:03:21] a child in the way it should go and once
[1:03:23] it gets in that right atmosphere
[1:03:26] at the predestinated time the right
[1:03:28] season something's going to recognize
[1:03:31] that wow God's my father oh Hallelujah
[1:03:34] it don't matter where they are at as
[1:03:37] long as there's somebody with
[1:03:39] understanding that's say son come in my
[1:03:41] atmosphere I'm I'm Sheltering you from
[1:03:44] all of the things of the world get into
[1:03:46] this atmosphere with me oh Hallelujah
[1:03:50] cuz many times we want our children
[1:03:51] saved but not willing to create the
[1:03:54] right atmosphere and you know and maybe
[1:03:56] your children you know don't don't have
[1:03:58] a clue about things but let me create
[1:04:01] the right atmosphere because we've got
[1:04:03] something to do you know the woman that
[1:04:05] that that that when Jesus says you're a
[1:04:07] dog you know she couldn't stop and just
[1:04:09] go back home and say honey hope you get
[1:04:12] well let's go try another doctor but no
[1:04:14] it was up to her they to to persevere
[1:04:18] and say Jesus you're my last hope you
[1:04:20] know if I if I don't get an answer from
[1:04:22] you what's my what's my child going to
[1:04:25] do you know I think of job yeah the
[1:04:27] Bible would tell us that that that his
[1:04:29] friends would come and say he's a secret
[1:04:31] Sinner and if you if you look at him if
[1:04:34] he would have started to doubt that he
[1:04:37] if he started to think he was a secret
[1:04:39] sinner he was losing his faith on the
[1:04:41] bloody sacrifice right it was the bloody
[1:04:44] sacrifice that made him just and so even
[1:04:47] though the accusations said he was a
[1:04:49] secret sinner he knew because of that
[1:04:52] sacrifice I'm a just person but what if
[1:04:55] he started to doubt his own sacrifice
[1:04:59] what hope would he have had for his
[1:05:01] children that was already gone right cuz
[1:05:03] the Bible told us that he did a
[1:05:05] sacrifice for his children just in case
[1:05:08] they would sin so if he lost faith in
[1:05:10] his own sacrifice what about the Next
[1:05:13] Generation oh little church that's why
[1:05:15] as parents have got to make sure we got
[1:05:18] the right atmosphere cuz if we lose our
[1:05:20] faith what about the Next Generation now
[1:05:23] like how brother brother Andrew said on
[1:05:25] Sunday what about the Next Generation
[1:05:28] that's why we got to unclog the channels
[1:05:30] if the water ain't flowing what hope
[1:05:32] does the Next Generation God but I say
[1:05:35] we've got shovels tonight on a Sunday
[1:05:37] morning Sunday night to unclog the
[1:05:40] channels the water can flow not just for
[1:05:42] me but for my loved ones so that my
[1:05:45] children ain't going out into the world
[1:05:47] my children ain't Ain dabling in things
[1:05:49] of the world but because of me there's
[1:05:52] water going to the Next Generation
[1:05:56] Hallelujah let me create that atmosphere
[1:05:59] for the Next Generation you see brother
[1:06:02] Brandon would say this when you talk to
[1:06:03] that child and he he's talking about
[1:06:07] whenever you you wanting people who are
[1:06:08] saved and the message the and the token
[1:06:11] and he calls out mothers and I think I
[1:06:13] think that's so profound and he says you
[1:06:15] mothers and he says when you talk to
[1:06:17] that child when you talk to that husband
[1:06:20] or talk to your wife talk to that loved
[1:06:22] one believe that it's going to help just
[1:06:25] stand there and say Lord I've claimed
[1:06:27] them they are mine I'm getting them for
[1:06:30] you apply it and create the atmosphere
[1:06:34] around you that that will drop right
[1:06:37] into it oh there you are if you've got
[1:06:40] the token you create a spirit around you
[1:06:43] he says apply the token with it and walk
[1:06:46] then walk with it and claim your
[1:06:49] household he says when you talk to your
[1:06:51] loved ones he says you're applying that
[1:06:53] token and then you're letting that
[1:06:56] atmosphere bring your claim into
[1:06:58] manifestation he says you claim it then
[1:07:02] create that atmosphere oh my and I
[1:07:04] thought my it's mothers you know brother
[1:07:06] Brandon W call you all that the Fifth
[1:07:07] Gospel right I believe it's because
[1:07:09] you're the ones that are showing the
[1:07:11] Life of Christ Matthew Mark Luke John is
[1:07:14] is showing the Life of Christ and its
[1:07:16] mothers that brother Brandon would
[1:07:17] commissioned that you claim your
[1:07:19] children you claim the children apply
[1:07:22] the token and then create that
[1:07:24] atmosphere for your children children
[1:07:26] that's what we do at home when we turn
[1:07:27] on tapes it's creating an atmosphere
[1:07:29] when we bring them to church it's
[1:07:31] creating an atmosphere oh Hallelujah and
[1:07:34] brother Brandon he would tell us we're a
[1:07:36] little Creator right and he said you you
[1:07:38] create the Atmosphere by the way you
[1:07:40] live by the way you talk your
[1:07:42] conversations he says uh he says and you
[1:07:44] you've seen them all the you you've seen
[1:07:46] those that every time you shun them all
[1:07:49] the time they want to talk about
[1:07:51] something evil and talk about somebody
[1:07:52] say oh my there they came they're going
[1:07:54] to criticize somebody there here here he
[1:07:57] is now he's going to talk about this man
[1:08:00] they're going to tell dirty jokes and or
[1:08:02] something about a woman or something
[1:08:03] like that you just hate to get around
[1:08:06] them see cuz they create seemingly
[1:08:08] pretty nice people but they create that
[1:08:11] atmosphere and the things you think on
[1:08:14] the things you do the actions the things
[1:08:17] you talk about creates an atmosphere man
[1:08:20] that that that should just that struck
[1:08:22] me between the eyes you know the what
[1:08:24] the things I talk about what the thing
[1:08:26] the way I live the the things I
[1:08:28] criticize you know I criticize people
[1:08:30] that's creating an atmosphere you know
[1:08:33] and the Bible would talk about the two
[1:08:35] they're walking on the way to the road
[1:08:36] to Emmas they were talking about how
[1:08:39] Jesus was dead they thought he was the
[1:08:40] Messiah and the Bible says Jesus himself
[1:08:43] Drew near and came to them and the Bible
[1:08:46] says their eyes was Holden that they
[1:08:48] should not know him and then Jesus looks
[1:08:51] at them and says what manner of
[1:08:53] communications are these that you have
[1:08:56] one to another that you are sad and so
[1:08:59] what they were talking about was
[1:09:01] creating an atmosphere of Gloom well I
[1:09:04] love the story because the the Bible
[1:09:06] tells us that Jesus did not leave him
[1:09:07] there he was willing to walk with him
[1:09:10] willing to take him back to scripture
[1:09:12] but they had to receive him and once
[1:09:14] they received the word and he broke the
[1:09:17] bread then their eyes was open it was
[1:09:19] the broken bread that would bring him
[1:09:21] out of that gloomy atmosphere and we've
[1:09:23] had a message in this generation you
[1:09:25] know broken bread that would could bring
[1:09:28] us out of an Earthly atmosphere and
[1:09:30] place us into Heavenly places that can
[1:09:33] change our communication that can change
[1:09:35] the way we the way we act the way we
[1:09:38] talk it can change us that we can walk
[1:09:40] in a right
[1:09:42] atmosphere because we're living in a
[1:09:44] time of gross darkness and I know these
[1:09:46] things are simple tonight but the Bible
[1:09:48] would tell us in Isaiah 60 And1 arise
[1:09:50] and shine for thy light has come the
[1:09:53] glory of the Lord is risen upon on thee
[1:09:56] for behold Darkness shall cover the
[1:09:58] Earth and gross Darkness the people but
[1:10:01] the Lord shall arise upon thee and His
[1:10:04] glory shall be seen upon thee so the
[1:10:07] Bible is talking about two different
[1:10:09] classes the Lord is going to come upon
[1:10:11] one and gross darkness is coming upon
[1:10:14] the other and brother the brand or the
[1:10:16] Bible would tell us that there's been
[1:10:17] what 200,000 demons that has been lifted
[1:10:21] out of the river Euphrates and the Bible
[1:10:23] tells us that it's gross Darkness over
[1:10:25] the people brother Brandon would say man
[1:10:28] wants to look like woman woman wants to
[1:10:29] look like man it goes to show there is a
[1:10:33] perversion a dark Spirit hanging over
[1:10:36] gross Darkness over the people so the
[1:10:39] gross darkness that the Bible's talking
[1:10:41] about there spirits that are coming over
[1:10:43] and Spirits create atmospheres and
[1:10:45] brother the Brandon would tell us that
[1:10:47] there's a shadow of Darkness just over
[1:10:49] the people that is pressing them so it's
[1:10:52] the the gross Darkness are spirits that
[1:10:54] are trying to to press in your mind
[1:10:56] trying to press in your homes try trying
[1:10:58] to press in your spirit man and we see
[1:11:01] it's not demons that we can see but it's
[1:11:04] Spirits in another dimension so in order
[1:11:06] to fight these Spirits we got to be
[1:11:08] equipped to fight in another dimension
[1:11:11] you see and I talked about some of these
[1:11:13] things last time I had preached but we
[1:11:15] got to be in the Heavenly places in
[1:11:18] order to fight in that other dimension
[1:11:20] cuz there's no way you can pick up a
[1:11:22] natural sword and and fight the enemy
[1:11:24] right you can't pick up a a bazooka and
[1:11:27] fight the enemy but it's something what
[1:11:29] you get into Heavenly places you're
[1:11:32] picking up the word in the right
[1:11:33] atmosphere and you're sending the word
[1:11:36] you're sining thus sayith the Lord and
[1:11:38] that is starting to whoop the devil any
[1:11:40] place under any condition and so as it's
[1:11:43] Shadows Of Darkness that's pressing the
[1:11:46] people and we see that that's creating a
[1:11:48] heaviness where there's no rest there's
[1:11:50] there's fear there there's turmoil and
[1:11:53] you can't even ask at somebody going to
[1:11:55] down the road how they're doing and it
[1:11:56] happened the other day you ask somebody
[1:11:58] how they're doing and their confession
[1:12:00] is always this went wrong that went
[1:12:02] wrong they're speaking from the
[1:12:04] atmosphere that they are dwelling in and
[1:12:07] that's the reason that the devil sends
[1:12:08] us through hard times right you know
[1:12:10] brother Brandon would talk about how
[1:12:12] when he came home a a and his wife was
[1:12:15] crying the children were fighting and he
[1:12:17] says the baby was screaming he says the
[1:12:19] children hadn't eaten all day and he
[1:12:21] says his wife comes up to him and says
[1:12:23] Billy I'm about to lose my mind and in
[1:12:25] that state it was a chaotic atmosphere
[1:12:29] but there was a man of God that wasn't
[1:12:31] willing to leave his family in that
[1:12:33] condition brother brandom says I didn't
[1:12:35] fight with her he says I rolled up my
[1:12:37] sleeves and says honey what do you want
[1:12:39] for supper I see you have eaten and
[1:12:42] brother brandom says she looked at him
[1:12:43] and says bill you can't cook supper he
[1:12:46] says you can do the dishes but you can't
[1:12:48] cook supper he says oh honey you've
[1:12:50] never tried my potatoes before and he
[1:12:52] says right there that atmosphere and he
[1:12:54] says J didn't know what I was doing he
[1:12:57] says but in my heart I was saying God
[1:12:59] help my wife he was saying Lord she has
[1:13:02] stood for you her her hair is almost
[1:13:04] gray because of the ministry that that
[1:13:07] she's been with me Lord help my wife and
[1:13:10] all along he was just talking Comfort
[1:13:13] words to her and that was changing the
[1:13:15] atmosphere it was the husband that came
[1:13:18] home from work maybe but wasn't willing
[1:13:20] to let that wife stay in that atmosphere
[1:13:23] where she felt like she was going to
[1:13:24] lose her mind and man you know uh wives
[1:13:26] go through it you know Mama go through
[1:13:28] it but you don't got to stay in that
[1:13:30] atmosphere you know you don't got to
[1:13:32] stay in that place where you don't feel
[1:13:34] like you you can keep going on you don't
[1:13:36] feel like you're good enough for your
[1:13:37] your family or good enough for your
[1:13:39] children you're a Creator where you can
[1:13:42] change that atmosphere and I'm so
[1:13:44] thankful that that brother Brandon was
[1:13:46] showing us that he was Human Too Human
[1:13:49] just like all of us you know and so get
[1:13:51] that a human being can change that
[1:13:54] atmosphere and you see brother the
[1:13:56] Brandon he preaches a message called
[1:13:58] letting off the pressure five times and
[1:14:00] he says if you don't let off the
[1:14:01] pressure you're going to explode and he
[1:14:04] says the the husband is racing home
[1:14:06] flying by and he says he gets home and
[1:14:08] he's he's home too early and he says uh
[1:14:11] the the wife don't have the don't have
[1:14:13] the supper ready because he's home too
[1:14:15] early and he says what happened they
[1:14:17] explode and he says what was it it was
[1:14:20] pressure and all of that is going back
[1:14:23] to an atmosphere but I don't believe
[1:14:25] we're to be dictated by the darkness
[1:14:28] that is pressing against us you see
[1:14:30] we're not called to be dictated there's
[1:14:32] two classes of people one the gross
[1:14:34] darkness is upon and another that the
[1:14:36] glory of the Lord is coming upon and I
[1:14:39] don't believe we're to be dictated by
[1:14:42] gross Darkness but the glory of the Lord
[1:14:44] has risen upon us and and brother
[1:14:47] Brandon would talk about about Joshua
[1:14:49] and he says when he said this when he
[1:14:51] said Son stand still he says he was tied
[1:14:54] to an absolute and he was under a
[1:14:56] commission and since he was tied to an
[1:14:59] absolute he would say son stand still so
[1:15:02] even though his atmosphere was starting
[1:15:05] to change and darkness was coming over
[1:15:07] his situation since he was tied to
[1:15:10] something solid he would speak the word
[1:15:12] and 11 brother Brandon would dramatize
[1:15:14] it he says he didn't stop and pray about
[1:15:17] it he didn't get the the men together
[1:15:19] and say let us pray for more sunlight he
[1:15:22] says no he had need of it and he spoke
[1:15:25] the word and that's the way it is with
[1:15:27] us we're tied to an absolute we're tied
[1:15:30] to the word of God in Heavenly places
[1:15:33] and when darkness tries to come over our
[1:15:35] situations we don't got to stop and say
[1:15:38] oh Lord I thought you promised me
[1:15:39] Victory we're tied to an absolute we say
[1:15:42] son stand still Darkness get back Moon
[1:15:45] you hold over there I'm sitting I'm tied
[1:15:49] to an
[1:15:50] absolute Hallelujah I'm tied to
[1:15:53] something and said I'm tied to this I've
[1:15:56] got a creative power you see there's a
[1:15:58] separation that has taken place and you
[1:16:01] remember there in Egypt that while the
[1:16:03] plagues were Fallen the children of
[1:16:06] Israel was in in Egypt but isolated in
[1:16:09] Goan and I thought this was so powerful
[1:16:11] in Exodus
[1:16:12] 8:22 the Bible would say and I will
[1:16:14] sever in that day the land of Goan in
[1:16:17] which my people dwell that no swarms of
[1:16:20] flies shall be there to the end thou May
[1:16:24] knowest that I am the Lord in the midst
[1:16:26] of the earth and I will put division
[1:16:28] between my people and thy people
[1:16:31] tomorrow shall this shall this sign be
[1:16:35] and the word sever means to be separated
[1:16:38] to make separate set apart so even
[1:16:41] though the children of Israel was in
[1:16:43] Egypt they were separated into the land
[1:16:46] of Goan and here we are in Leo but we've
[1:16:49] been separated into a bright age we've
[1:16:52] been separated into Heavenly places and
[1:16:55] brother Brandon would tell us how do we
[1:16:57] get into Heavenly places it's the word
[1:16:59] coming the word Has Lifted us up into
[1:17:02] Heavenly places so even though we're
[1:17:04] living G Le Ora there was a voice saying
[1:17:07] come out of her my people and be not
[1:17:10] partakers of her sins and brother
[1:17:13] Brandon would say this and just stop
[1:17:15] just one moment here in Heavenly places
[1:17:18] not just anywhere but in Heavenly places
[1:17:21] he would say we are heavenlies in our
[1:17:24] souls he says oh what could happen
[1:17:26] tonight what could happen if we get to
[1:17:29] be setting in Heavenly places in a
[1:17:32] Heavenly atmosphere the Holy Spirit
[1:17:34] moving everywhere every heart that's
[1:17:37] been regenerated and become a new cre
[1:17:40] new creature in Christ Jesus he says God
[1:17:43] let me never leave here just Heavenly
[1:17:46] places in Christ Jesus and brother
[1:17:49] brandom he would say that Heavenly
[1:17:51] places is an atmosphere and I'd never
[1:17:53] seen that before till recently I guess
[1:17:56] he says Heavenly places is an atmosphere
[1:17:59] he says that's your position in Christ
[1:18:01] Jesus and what I what I love about it is
[1:18:04] brother brandom could look into that
[1:18:06] other atmosphere you know he he as a
[1:18:08] prophet he could look into that other
[1:18:10] atmosphere and I was listening to a tape
[1:18:12] and brother brandom was in a prayer line
[1:18:14] and there was a lady that would start to
[1:18:16] cry and brother brandom says you you
[1:18:18] something just changed he says you feel
[1:18:21] something is here the closer you get to
[1:18:23] me he says that is the Angel of the Lord
[1:18:25] and he says it's standing here in this
[1:18:28] heavenly atmosphere and so even though
[1:18:30] the lady could not see it there was a
[1:18:33] prophet that could identify what was
[1:18:36] there another place he would say that
[1:18:39] the angel of the Lord is in a Heavenly
[1:18:41] atmosphere and in another place he would
[1:18:44] say that there are angels mingling near
[1:18:46] in this heavenly atmosphere we could not
[1:18:49] see it but there was a prophet that
[1:18:52] could look into that other atmosphere
[1:18:54] and tell us what is there but what's so
[1:18:57] powerful is brother Brandon would not
[1:18:59] just leave it for us he would say we
[1:19:01] would say this when your faith catches
[1:19:03] the word it sends you into another
[1:19:05] dimension so now we're not just relying
[1:19:08] on brother the brand I'm saying there
[1:19:10] are angels mingling here but there's a
[1:19:12] word that has sent us into Heavenly
[1:19:14] places in another dimension where we
[1:19:17] believe that they are here we know that
[1:19:19] every time we come to church angels are
[1:19:22] mingling near brother Brandon going talk
[1:19:24] about uh Elijah and Gesa he would say
[1:19:27] whenever Gesa came and said we're
[1:19:29] surrounded but the brandom says that
[1:19:31] Elijah did not see the Angels there he
[1:19:34] believed that they were there so him
[1:19:37] believing sent him into another
[1:19:39] dimension that he knew they were there
[1:19:42] and US believing the word of God sends
[1:19:44] us into another dimension that we
[1:19:47] believe all things are possible even
[1:19:49] when nothing is changing we're in
[1:19:51] Heavenly places when the circumstances
[1:19:53] ain't changing when when there trials
[1:19:55] are work and the and the home life is
[1:19:57] chaotic we're still setting in the right
[1:20:00] atmosphere because of the word for the
[1:20:03] brand say this The Headstone crying what
[1:20:05] Grace Grace pass from death and create
[1:20:08] into a Living Word of the Living God
[1:20:11] God's only provided plan for his a for
[1:20:14] this age for his sons in a word age
[1:20:17] quickened by his Spirit like a spark
[1:20:20] that's that that Lit off something to
[1:20:22] make it alive and seeed that now in
[1:20:24] Heavenly places past tense he says
[1:20:27] already alive subject to every promise
[1:20:30] of the word of God little musicians come
[1:20:33] tonight and here here's the quote I
[1:20:35] referred to earlier brother Brandon
[1:20:37] would say in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:20:39] Jesus for we claim that we passed from
[1:20:41] Death un Life by his promise we are
[1:20:44] caught up in a Heavenly atmosphere and
[1:20:47] sitting with him now my so we've been
[1:20:50] called up how by a word coming to call
[1:20:54] us up High into a Heavenly atmosphere
[1:20:57] where there's Angels mingling near where
[1:20:59] the angel of the Lord is accompanying
[1:21:01] this word always even when we don't see
[1:21:04] him even when we don't see the angels we
[1:21:07] know that he is here brother Brandon
[1:21:09] would say this such a sweet feeling now
[1:21:12] no oh if you could just feel this
[1:21:14] wonderful Heavenly atmosphere it's is
[1:21:16] it's his presence now you're see the
[1:21:19] angel on that picture almighty God who
[1:21:21] would judge me at that at the day of
[1:21:23] judgment no
[1:21:25] that that angel is right here right now
[1:21:28] you're looking this way looking straight
[1:21:30] towards it not me him I can feel a
[1:21:34] moving in the audience everywhere it was
[1:21:37] a Heavenly atmosphere in that Heavenly
[1:21:40] atmosphere was the angel of the Lord and
[1:21:43] little church that's why we got to
[1:21:44] create an atmosphere you know that's why
[1:21:46] we don't just come to church at out of a
[1:21:48] ritual or a duty become the church to
[1:21:51] get into an atmosphere that changes can
[1:21:54] take place the that our children can be
[1:21:56] filled with the Holy Ghost not just a
[1:22:00] tradition but an atmosphere and you know
[1:22:02] brother Brandon when talking about the
[1:22:05] churches A Million Miles Away he says
[1:22:07] they've lost their sincerity and they're
[1:22:10] in a ritual a tradition you know they're
[1:22:13] doing what they think that that God is
[1:22:14] leading them to
[1:22:16] do but there's no Spirit behind it you
[1:22:18] know it's a ritual and Lord don't let us
[1:22:21] make comeing to church a ritual I know I
[1:22:23] know that's all heall Des are Lord let
[1:22:25] me come to church to be persevering let
