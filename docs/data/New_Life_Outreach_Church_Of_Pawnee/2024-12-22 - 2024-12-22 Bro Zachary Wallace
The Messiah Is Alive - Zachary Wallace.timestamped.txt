[46:33] our brother to come in the sixth month
[46:37] the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
[46:40] a city of Galilee named
[46:48] [Music]
[46:53] Nazareth and the angel came in unto her
[46:56] and said hell thou that are highly
[46:59] favored the Lord is with thee blessed be
[47:03] blessed art thou among
[47:08] [Music]
[47:14] women and the angel said unto her fear
[47:16] not Mary for thou Hast found favor with
[47:19] God
[47:24] [Music]
[47:26] shall call his name Jesus and he shall
[47:29] be great and shall be called the son of
[47:32] the highest and the Lord God shall give
[47:34] unto him the Throne of his father
[47:38] [Music]
[47:44] David then said Mary unto the angel how
[47:47] shall this be saying I know not a Manel
[48:02] [Music]
[48:07] and behold thy cousin Elizabeth hath
[48:10] also conceived a son in her old age and
[48:12] this is the sixth month with her who who
[48:16] was called
[48:18] [Music]
[48:21] baren and Mary said behold the handmade
[48:24] of the Lord be it unto me according to
[48:28] Thy word and the angel departed from
[48:33] her now if we look there in Luke 2 and
[48:39] 1 we will do the same and it came to
[48:42] pass in those days that there went out a
[48:45] decree from Caesar Augustus that all the
[48:49] world should be taxed
[48:56] and all went to be taxed everyone into
[48:59] his own
[49:01] [Music]
[49:07] [Music]
[49:15] City to be taxed with Mary his espoused
[49:18] wife being great with child
[49:23] [Music]
[49:29] and she brought forth her firstborn son
[49:31] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[49:33] laid him in a Manger because there was
[49:36] no room for him for them in the
[49:38] [Music]
[49:46] end and lo the angel of the Lord Came
[49:49] Upon them and the glory of the Lord
[49:52] Shone around about them and they were
[49:55] sore afraid
[49:57] and the Ang said
[49:59] [Music]
[50:04] themar to All For unto you is Born This
[50:08] Day in the city of David a savior which
[50:11] is Christ the
[50:14] [Music]
[50:22] lord and suddenly there was with the
[50:25] angel a multitude of heavenly host
[50:28] praising God and
[50:29] [Music]
[50:36] saying and when it came to pass as the
[50:38] Angels were going away from them into
[50:40] heaven the shepherd said one to another
[50:44] let us go even un Bethlehem and see this
[50:47] thing which is come to pass which the
[50:50] Lord ha made known unto us
[50:58] M and when they had seen it they made
[51:01] known abroad this the saying which was
[51:04] told them concerning this
[51:08] [Music]
[51:12] child but Mary kept all these things and
[51:15] pondered them in her
[51:17] heart and the sheer return
[51:20] glor God all the things
[51:24] [Music]
[51:29] and when eight days were accomplished
[51:31] for the circumcising of the child his
[51:34] name was called Jesus which was so named
[51:37] of the Angel before he was conceived in
[51:39] the
[51:50] womb as it is written in the law of the
[51:53] Lord every male that openeth the womb
[51:55] Shall be Called holy to the
[52:01] [Music]
[52:05] Lord and behold there was a man in
[52:08] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon the same
[52:11] man was just and devout waiting for the
[52:13] consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost
[52:15] was upon
[52:24] him and he came by the Spirit into the
[52:27] temple and when the parents brought in
[52:29] the Child Jesus to do for him after the
[52:31] custom of the
[52:38] [Music]
[52:40] law Lord th now let us thou thy servant
[52:44] depart in peace according to Thy
[52:47] word

[52:53] face of all

[52:58] Glory of
[52:59] people and Joseph and his mother

[53:42] and four years which departed not from
[53:44] the temple but served god with fasting
[53:47] and prayers night and day

[54:00] according to the law of the Lord they
[54:02] returned unto Galilee to their own it to

[58:32] just happy to be identified with
[58:34] Believers this
[58:35] morning if you have your Bibles let's
[58:37] just turn over to Isaiah the 7th chapter
[58:40] take a reading
[58:43] there yeah I I I sure wasn't feeling
[58:46] that good yesterday but you know brother
[58:48] Ron Spencer kind of shut down calling in
[58:50] sick
[58:51] so I figured that an invincible Army
[58:55] doesn't quit for lying vanities so we're
[58:58] here this morning testifying that Jesus
[59:00] Christ is alive and well and it doesn't
[59:03] matter how you feel about it it's still
[59:05] the word of God Isaiah the 7th chapter
[59:09] and verse 14 very familiar portion of
[59:14] scripture Isaiah 7
[59:19] and14 says uh therefore the Lord himself
[59:23] shall give you a sign yeah behold beh
[59:26] old a virgin shall conceive and bear a
[59:28] son and shall call his name
[59:31] Emmanuel which is God With Us all right
[59:35] and Isaiah 96 just over a couple of
[59:38] pages
[59:39] there Isaiah
[59:41] 96 For unto us a child is born unto us a
[59:45] son is given and the government shall be
[59:47] upon his shoulder and his name Shall be
[59:49] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[59:52] God the Everlasting father the prince of
[59:57] peace and then we don't need to turn to
[59:59] it you know the scripture Hebrews 138
[1:00:02] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:00:05] today and forever I want to take a text
[1:00:08] this morning on the Messiah is alive all
[1:00:12] right let's just bow our heads Lord we
[1:00:16] love you and we're so thankful to be
[1:00:19] identified with a living God and to know
[1:00:22] that you're here present among us to
[1:00:23] manifest yourself Lord and that you You'
[1:00:26] never failed to keep one of your
[1:00:27] promises Lord your word has always come
[1:00:29] to pass it's always been fulfilled
[1:00:31] exactly the way you said it would be and
[1:00:33] I pray this morning Lord that you would
[1:00:35] just open up your word to our hearts
[1:00:36] that we might recognize you in your
[1:00:39] reality Lord we might recognize you
[1:00:40] alive here amongst your people this
[1:00:42] morning and identify that you're the
[1:00:44] same yesterday today and forever I just
[1:00:47] pray that you would have your Liberty
[1:00:48] Among Us may you move according to your
[1:00:51] will in Jesus Christ's name amen be
[1:00:54] seated this morning
[1:00:58] uh kept different things in the song
[1:01:01] service and things I kept uh hearing
[1:01:04] things that just kind of encourage you
[1:01:05] and tell you you're on the right track
[1:01:07] you got the right inspiration so I'm
[1:01:10] thankful for
[1:01:12] that move that down a little I don't
[1:01:15] know seems to be thumping a little bit
[1:01:17] but
[1:01:18] uh I want to just look at how the
[1:01:21] Messiah is alive but many times we look
[1:01:23] at this and we say oh well yes the
[1:01:25] Messiah is alive because he raised from
[1:01:27] the dead and the grave is empty and but
[1:01:30] we we we leave him back there we leave
[1:01:32] him as a god of history of 2000 years
[1:01:34] ago we recognize yes that Jesus he
[1:01:37] raised from the dead but I ask you where
[1:01:39] is he at right now today where is the
[1:01:42] Messiah at because he's not dead He's
[1:01:45] Alive you say well if he's alive could I
[1:01:47] meet him yes you absolutely could oh
[1:01:50] well if the Messiah is alive then you
[1:01:52] know where's he at and and that's what I
[1:01:55] really want to look at this morning and
[1:01:57] I want to keep it in the context of
[1:01:59] Hebrews 138 that God doesn't change he's
[1:02:02] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:02:04] so if you look and you'll truly
[1:02:05] recognize what Messiah was then and how
[1:02:08] he was expressed and what he did you'll
[1:02:10] be able to identify him again today and
[1:02:14] you know they didn't recognize him then
[1:02:17] because it didn't come the way they
[1:02:18] thought it should but happens still the
[1:02:21] same today he comes in a way they don't
[1:02:23] expect and and they they they looked at
[1:02:26] and it looked like failure to them it
[1:02:27] looked like here's this this one who
[1:02:29] claims to be the Son of God he's dying
[1:02:31] stripped naked on a cross crucified
[1:02:33] rejected spit upon his own followers
[1:02:35] forsook him it looked like a mess and it
[1:02:37] looked like he was defeated but he's
[1:02:39] still the King right he was not defeated
[1:02:42] he overcame and he conquered and today
[1:02:45] he has a kingdom and I'm so glad to be
[1:02:48] under his Dominion to be a part of that
[1:02:50] Kingdom and and the prophet said here uh
[1:02:54] he says we're under the Dominion of the
[1:02:56] anointed one not only that but he has
[1:02:59] made us Kings and Priests unto God
[1:03:02] anointed ones unto God so what is an
[1:03:07] anointed
[1:03:08] one it's a
[1:03:11] messiah the the Messiah the word Messiah
[1:03:14] means the anointed one and today there
[1:03:18] is a people on this Earth who are
[1:03:20] anointed ones under that Dominion of the
[1:03:24] Mighty God okay
[1:03:26] now when when Jesus came he came in an
[1:03:29] unexpected way he came in Simplicity he
[1:03:32] came in such a way that people could not
[1:03:35] recognize that it was him okay that's
[1:03:38] the way it's always been God moves in an
[1:03:40] unexpected way he moves in paradoxes he
[1:03:43] everything he does is contrary to the
[1:03:45] thinking of man because God's ways are
[1:03:47] far above our ways his thinking is not
[1:03:50] our thinking and when he does something
[1:03:52] people don't recognize it because they
[1:03:54] have you know their own
[1:03:56] their own measuring of things and
[1:03:58] there's a way God measures something and
[1:04:00] then there's a way man measures
[1:04:01] something and they really often times
[1:04:04] don't have any anything in continuity
[1:04:06] with each other you know it's kind of
[1:04:09] funny I was up in a up in some mountains
[1:04:12] in Nicaragua one time and I was way up
[1:04:14] there ride way up in the mountains and
[1:04:16] you get up there and uh there's a little
[1:04:19] church up there in these mountains got
[1:04:20] there by horseback and we were talking
[1:04:22] to the pastor and he was having some
[1:04:24] problems in the church you know he's
[1:04:25] like well you see the brother down the
[1:04:27] hill he's got more horses than me and so
[1:04:29] he wants to run the
[1:04:33] church and it just was so funny to me to
[1:04:36] think that he would think that horses
[1:04:38] was something spiritual you know but you
[1:04:41] know Spirits are the same but the way
[1:04:43] man thinks is so human it's so carnal
[1:04:46] the way God thinks it's so beyond it's
[1:04:49] so beyond anything the way we would
[1:04:51] think we would think that when Jehovah
[1:04:53] came he would roll down the corridors of
[1:04:55] Heaven he would come down in Golden
[1:04:57] robes and he would come down in splendor
[1:04:59] and power but when he came down it was a
[1:05:01] baby crying in a Manger over a manure
[1:05:03] pile was the way God did it brother
[1:05:07] brandom says here in the sermon the
[1:05:08] Messiah he says the father dwelleth in
[1:05:10] me he doeth the works and if I do not
[1:05:13] them works then don't believe me but if
[1:05:16] I do them believe me now that was for
[1:05:20] messiah the for Messi The church here it
[1:05:24] comes are you you ready St John 14:12
[1:05:27] Jesus said he that believeth on me the
[1:05:30] works that I do shall he do
[1:05:40] also the
[1:05:42] representation of Messiah on Earth yet
[1:05:47] all right yes where's the representation
[1:05:49] of the Messiah on Earth on okay you tell
[1:05:53] me brother kobby where's it at
[1:05:57] now you say the Messiah yeah the
[1:06:01] anointed one it's the same anointing
[1:06:04] it's the same spirit and you know you
[1:06:08] see this church is all that he was if he
[1:06:11] was perfect then I'm perfect now he was
[1:06:15] perfect by sinless Perfection I'm
[1:06:17] perfect by a perfect blood amen but what
[1:06:20] he was we are so if he was the Messiah
[1:06:23] then we are Messiahs if he was a Healer
[1:06:25] then we have the same power to go and to
[1:06:27] heal the sick if he cast out Devils then
[1:06:29] his church will do the same thing she is
[1:06:31] to be the exact representation a
[1:06:33] reflection of him this very same Messiah
[1:06:36] that was here 2,000 years ago that
[1:06:38] Messiah is not dead he's not in a grave
[1:06:41] but he is alive this morning and he's in
[1:06:43] a people in such humility in such
[1:06:46] Simplicity that it looks foolish to the
[1:06:48] world and even when you look at yourself
[1:06:50] you say me yeah I Messiah yeah no no you
[1:06:56] see if it was going to be Messiah if it
[1:06:58] was going to be a messiah if it was
[1:07:00] going to be a manifested Son of God it
[1:07:01] would look like this and it would look
[1:07:02] like that and it would look and you
[1:07:04] start measuring it by the measurement of
[1:07:07] man but the prophet said the Messiahs
[1:07:09] that's right Messiahs the representation
[1:07:12] of Messiah on Earth yet so the Messiah
[1:07:16] is on Earth right now but it's in a
[1:07:19] people the Bride of Jesus
[1:07:23] Christ now when the Messiah came
[1:07:26] he came by a stable and I I just want
[1:07:29] you to let's just I want you to Journey
[1:07:31] with me in your minds as best you can uh
[1:07:34] and just think about this we're gathered
[1:07:36] around this this this Barn a cave in the
[1:07:40] wall and you hear the cows in there and
[1:07:43] it stinks I mean have you ever been in a
[1:07:46] in an Old Barn they stink they're not a
[1:07:48] pleasant place and you're in there it's
[1:07:51] dark out the the city is crowded there's
[1:07:53] all this noise going on there's this
[1:07:55] this this mother in there crying out in
[1:07:57] labor pains she doesn't have a nice bed
[1:07:59] she doesn't have nice sheets she's
[1:08:01] laying in a pile of straw with with
[1:08:03] animals all running around there's
[1:08:05] probably mice and rats running around
[1:08:06] there too I mean why wouldn't they be
[1:08:09] and you got all of this and a pile of
[1:08:10] manure in the corner and
[1:08:14] this is
[1:08:16] Emmanuel you say you know if we were
[1:08:18] sitting there and be like oh yes it's
[1:08:20] just so wonderful think about it the
[1:08:22] Fulfillment of Isaiah 9:6 the
[1:08:24] Fulfillment of a son being given to us
[1:08:26] and the Fulfillment of the Prince of
[1:08:28] Peace the Mighty God all of that right
[1:08:30] there in the
[1:08:32] dirt it's absurd it's
[1:08:36] ridiculous you would if if somebody were
[1:08:38] to be sitting let if we were to go to to
[1:08:41] uh I noticed you had a chicken coop
[1:08:42] brother Caleb where where'd you go I
[1:08:44] just seen you a second ago I lost you
[1:08:46] there you are if we were over there and
[1:08:48] you know you got your little chicken
[1:08:50] coop on the side of the house and some
[1:08:51] wafs came in and they were like hey we
[1:08:53] we we don't have anywhere to go can we
[1:08:54] have our baby in your chicken
[1:08:56] coop and you be like uh well if you have
[1:08:59] to I guess you know and and then I we
[1:09:02] say well I just want you to know this is
[1:09:04] the fulfill this is the greatest thing
[1:09:05] that ever happened on Earth in your
[1:09:06] chicken
[1:09:07] coop it's
[1:09:10] ridiculous but it's what
[1:09:13] happened in such a way and nobody knew
[1:09:16] about it nobody understood what was
[1:09:18] going on nobody nobody could believe
[1:09:21] that God would do something that it
[1:09:23] didn't happen in the great religious
[1:09:24] palaces it didn't happen in the the
[1:09:26] great places of the earth and the
[1:09:28] kingdoms of the earth it didn't happen
[1:09:30] in those places it happened in a pile of
[1:09:32] dirt and straw and manure in a stable
[1:09:36] somewhere but that gives me so much hope
[1:09:39] that gives me so much courage to know
[1:09:41] that if God can come and he can come in
[1:09:43] a way that would be like that and he
[1:09:45] would Express himself and he would bring
[1:09:46] forth the Messiah in that then he can
[1:09:49] come and he can reveal himself and he
[1:09:50] can express himself through this pile of
[1:09:53] dirt and manure and garbage this little
[1:09:55] Earthly vessel that has nothing of value
[1:09:57] or goodness in it he can come and reveal
[1:10:00] himself in
[1:10:02] Me God hides himself in
[1:10:06] Simplicity God is not in the great
[1:10:08] things he's not in the the Beauty and
[1:10:10] the glamour he hides himself in
[1:10:13] simplicity so much that the whole world
[1:10:15] walks right past it the religious people
[1:10:17] missed it the the scribes the Pharisees
[1:10:19] these people that studied the scriptures
[1:10:21] they had everyone memorized they knew
[1:10:23] all of the prophecies and prophecies
[1:10:25] being fulfilled right there in their day
[1:10:28] and they knew nothing about it God
[1:10:31] hiding himself in Simplicity and then
[1:10:34] revealing himself in the
[1:10:38] same he's doing the same thing today and
[1:10:42] yet that was the Messiah that was the
[1:10:44] Messiah laying in a in a
[1:10:48] Manger wrapped up in a old piece of
[1:10:53] cloth it didn't come to a person you
[1:10:56] would expect it came to Mary a little
[1:10:59] girl that lived in a mean little town
[1:11:01] called
[1:11:02] Nazareth was an unexpected place an
[1:11:04] unexpected person and he had Jesus when
[1:11:08] he was born he had the reputation that
[1:11:10] he was born
[1:11:15] illegitimately all right everything
[1:11:18] about it didn't make
[1:11:20] sense everything about it was
[1:11:23] Simplicity humility
[1:11:27] you know he was born under a bad
[1:11:29] name you know and I've been born under a
[1:11:32] bad name too they not good about me but
[1:11:35] he has expressed and revealed himself in
[1:11:39] my
[1:11:40] life their educational ethics could not
[1:11:43] swallow that their interpretation of the
[1:11:46] scriptures know nothing about that but
[1:11:49] yet it was thus saith the Lord he says
[1:11:53] it Shivers me to think it to see see the
[1:11:55] same thing reoccurring again God cannot
[1:12:00] change the same thing is reoccurring
[1:12:03] again in this day God coming manifesting
[1:12:06] himself the Messiah on Earth and it
[1:12:09] doesn't come according to their
[1:12:10] interpretation of the scriptures but
[1:12:13] it's exactly according to thus sayeth
[1:12:16] the
[1:12:17] Lord now where is the Messiah
[1:12:21] today where is he at what does the proph
[1:12:25] phy say what did the prophecy say the
[1:12:27] Messiah would be show me one place where
[1:12:29] Jesus didn't fulfill it he fulfilled it
[1:12:32] line upon line scripture upon scripture
[1:12:34] he was exactly according to the prophecy
[1:12:37] exactly according to the promise and yet
[1:12:39] completely different to the human
[1:12:42] thinking it's the same thing
[1:12:45] today what does the prophecy say about
[1:12:47] the Messiah today what does it say about
[1:12:50] where what this church will be in this
[1:12:53] last day it says in Ephesians 5 27 that
[1:12:56] he will present to himself a glorious
[1:12:58] church not having a spot or wrinkle or
[1:13:01] any such thing but that it should be
[1:13:03] holy and without blemish this last day
[1:13:07] church is going to be a glorious church
[1:13:09] it's not going to be a church that just
[1:13:10] barely survise leoda it's not going to
[1:13:13] be a church that just barely Gets By by
[1:13:14] the Skin of Their Teeth it's a
[1:13:16] triumphant Victorious church it's an
[1:13:18] invincible Army it's a glorious church
[1:13:21] and there's not even going to be one
[1:13:22] spot on it from the filth of leoda
[1:13:25] right John 14:12 verily I say unto you
[1:13:29] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:13:31] do shall he do also that's what the
[1:13:34] Messiahs are going to look like the
[1:13:36] works that I do shall he do also and
[1:13:38] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:13:40] because I go unto my father okay Mark 16
[1:13:44] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:13:46] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:13:48] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:13:50] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:13:51] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:13:54] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:13:56] and they shall recover that is what the
[1:13:59] Messiahs are going to look like that's
[1:14:01] what they're going to manifest and now
[1:14:03] when we start thinking about that we
[1:14:04] start thinking of something kind of
[1:14:06] exciting we start to think of something
[1:14:09] you know with a little bit of uh Pizzazz
[1:14:11] about it or a little bit of you know
[1:14:13] glory in In the Flesh or something we
[1:14:15] think oh well you know I'm going to be
[1:14:16] going around and I'm G to have my chest
[1:14:18] stuck out and I'm going to walk up and
[1:14:19] I'm going to cast out the devils and no
[1:14:21] it could be a little eight-year-old girl
[1:14:23] coming up and putting her hand on her
[1:14:24] daddy and pray for
[1:14:28] him don't think of it the way man would
[1:14:31] think of it look at it the way God would
[1:14:33] look at it and how he hides himself in
[1:14:36] Simplicity in Acts 10:38 it says how
[1:14:40] that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[1:14:43] the Holy Ghost and with power who went
[1:14:45] about doing good and healing all that
[1:14:47] were oppressed of the devil for God was
[1:14:50] with
[1:14:51] him now if we leave that back 2,000
[1:14:54] years ago we've missed the purpose of
[1:14:56] Jesus Christ's coming okay it needs to
[1:14:59] read how that God anointed Colby Martin
[1:15:02] of paon with the Holy Ghost and with
[1:15:05] power who went about doing good and
[1:15:07] healing all that were oppressed of the
[1:15:09] devil for God was with him
[1:15:13] okay the same power that was on him he
[1:15:16] put into his church all that was in God
[1:15:19] he poured into his church all that were
[1:15:21] all that was in God he poured into
[1:15:22] Christ all that was in Christ he poured
[1:15:24] into his church so if this church is in
[1:15:26] tabernacling deity if it has the power
[1:15:29] of God within it it will perform the
[1:15:31] same works that he did he said that's
[1:15:33] what he said that's not my
[1:15:35] interpretation that's not my idea he
[1:15:36] said the works that I do shall ye do
[1:15:39] also so we should be under expectation
[1:15:42] to see the manifestation of the power of
[1:15:45] God in our
[1:15:46] lives God once again hiding himself in
[1:15:50] Simplicity in a simple little people in
[1:15:53] ponti Oklahoma
[1:15:55] yes sir and yet Messiahs the Messi hates
[1:15:58] of this day on the earth in Pony
[1:16:01] Oklahoma now doesn't that just kind of
[1:16:03] sounds
[1:16:06] silly but God comes in a paradox every
[1:16:10] time it seems impossible it seems
[1:16:13] unlikely but it's the truth
[1:16:16] anyway now I want to look at this
[1:16:19] morning for a little bit just the the
[1:16:20] principle of Jesus Christ being the same
[1:16:23] yesterday today and forever and how we
[1:16:25] can recognize what he was and how he
[1:16:27] came we can recognize what he is now and
[1:16:30] how he's going to express himself but I
[1:16:32] just want to really establish this this
[1:16:34] principle of the scriptures which
[1:16:36] brother brandom called the Keystone of
[1:16:38] the Bible he said the Keystone of the
[1:16:40] Bible it is the Revelation that God
[1:16:43] never changes and that his ways are as
[1:16:46] unchangeable as he is Hebrews 13:8 says
[1:16:49] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:16:50] and forever and he says uh Ecclesiastes
[1:16:53] 3:14 I know whatsoever God doeth it
[1:16:56] shall be forever nothing can be put to
[1:16:58] it nor anything taken from it and God
[1:17:01] doeth it that men should fear before him
[1:17:03] that which hath been is now and that
[1:17:06] which is to be hath already been and God
[1:17:09] requireth that which is PED here it is
[1:17:12] an unchanging God with
[1:17:15] unchanging ways okay God doesn't change
[1:17:19] what he did the first time he'll do the
[1:17:20] second time because if he didn't he made
[1:17:22] a mistake when he did it the first time
[1:17:23] if God forgave sinner that came and
[1:17:26] repented the first time he'll do it the
[1:17:28] second time if God healed one person who
[1:17:30] came on the basis of faith if you come
[1:17:32] on the basis of Faith he'll do the same
[1:17:34] thing because God doesn't change his
[1:17:36] nature doesn't change his laws don't
[1:17:38] change his word doesn't change and if
[1:17:40] you can find out how he works and you
[1:17:42] can recognize what he's doing then you
[1:17:44] can position yourself and be right in
[1:17:46] the line where he's going to move okay
[1:17:49] now the scripture says in Malachi 3 I am
[1:17:52] the Lord and I change not there
[1:17:54] therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
[1:17:57] consumed you see God chose Israel right
[1:18:01] he put his choosing upon Israel why is
[1:18:04] there a nation of Israel over there in
[1:18:07] Palestine right now because God put his
[1:18:10] choosing upon Israel and there was
[1:18:13] prophecies in the scripture that said
[1:18:15] that there would be a people on the
[1:18:16] Earth in the last days in a nation of
[1:18:19] Israel in a city of Jerusalem how is it
[1:18:21] possible that that country resurrected
[1:18:23] after all those years because of
[1:18:25] Prophecy and because God's choosing is
[1:18:29] not is not just temporary it doesn't
[1:18:31] just last for a day when God places his
[1:18:33] choosing upon you that settles it it's
[1:18:36] not because Israel is is good it's not
[1:18:39] because Israel is righteous it's not
[1:18:40] because they've earned it or deserve it
[1:18:42] no no they they they failed so many
[1:18:44] times they they God turned his back on
[1:18:47] them time after time because they kept
[1:18:48] rejecting him right down till when he
[1:18:50] sent his son to them they rejected and
[1:18:52] crucified him but it still does not
[1:18:54] change that God has placed his election
[1:18:57] upon
[1:18:58] Israel nothing Israel can do will ever
[1:19:01] change God's mind about
[1:19:03] it brother Wendell God chose you and you
[1:19:07] can't change God's mind about it amen
[1:19:10] when God places his hand upon your life
[1:19:13] it's not because you're good enough it's
[1:19:15] not because you're worthy it's not
[1:19:17] because of how holy you are but by his
[1:19:19] elective Grace he puts his hand upon
[1:19:21] your life and he claims you and he says
[1:19:24] you are mine and nothing's going to
[1:19:26] change his mind about
[1:19:29] itj God doesn't change his
[1:19:32] nature God doesn't God his nature
[1:19:36] Remains the Same now he comes in a
[1:19:37] different way he comes in an unexpected
[1:19:39] form but his nature stays the same now
[1:19:42] what is his nature well he's a redeemer
[1:19:46] he's a savior he's a Healer he's a
[1:19:49] father his very the very nature of him
[1:19:53] is love
[1:19:56] he's a God of Justice and therefore God
[1:19:58] of judgment he never breaks his word
[1:20:03] that's his nature that's his character
[1:20:05] that's who he is he hides himself in
[1:20:08] Simplicity that's his nature every time
[1:20:11] he expresses and hides himself in
[1:20:14] humility and simplicity you want to find
[1:20:17] God find humility and
[1:20:20] simplicity God doesn't change we we see
[1:20:23] here uh I was reading the story the
[1:20:25] other day of David and uh it it says how
[1:20:28] Nathan came into him and and told him
[1:20:31] this story about what this man had done
[1:20:33] and all these things and and and and
[1:20:35] David got so angry you know he was
[1:20:36] looking looking at the his neighbor and
[1:20:38] seeing all the sins of his neighbor and
[1:20:40] he's like well that guy this and that
[1:20:41] and he's like well that person should
[1:20:44] die you know it's really easy to see the
[1:20:46] faults in the person sitting next to you
[1:20:48] in church or the person across the aisle
[1:20:50] or your husband or your wife it's easy
[1:20:52] to see the faults in them but then
[1:20:54] Nathan the prophet just turned the the
[1:20:56] picture a little bit and he says you're
[1:20:59] the man you're the one and there's going
[1:21:02] to be judgment brought upon your home
[1:21:04] and and you're going to pay a price for
[1:21:06] what you've done and and David didn't
[1:21:08] make one excuse he didn't say try to
[1:21:11] offer one reason he just immediately the
[1:21:13] first thing out of David's mouth after
[1:21:16] Nathan brought this this this uh to this
[1:21:20] before him he said I have sinned against
[1:21:23] the Lord
[1:21:25] now I want you to notice how
[1:21:29] quickly David said unto Nathan I have
[1:21:31] sinned against the Lord and Nathan said
[1:21:33] unto David the Lord also hath put away
[1:21:36] thy
[1:21:39] sin if God did that for
[1:21:43] David David was as guilty as guilty
[1:21:46] could be he had committed adultery he
[1:21:48] had murdered his friend who was fighting
[1:21:51] for him who was faithful who had stck by
[1:21:53] him for year after year and he murdered
[1:21:55] his own friend because he wanted to take
[1:21:57] his wife you talk about a a sinner and
[1:22:00] David he confesses I have sinned he was
[1:22:04] a repentant Sinner and the moment that
[1:22:06] he confessed it Nathan the prophet who
[1:22:09] has that Divine contact with God turns
[1:22:11] to him and he says your sin has been put
[1:22:14] away from
[1:22:15] you if that could happen under the blood
[1:22:18] of bulls and goats how much more under
[1:22:20] the blood of the perfect sacrifice of
[1:22:22] the Lord Jesus Christ if he forgave a
[1:22:24] sinner then he's still the same today
[1:22:27] and he'll forgive a sinner
[1:22:29] today I looked up that word put away thy
[1:22:33] Sin from you and it's the word abar it
[1:22:36] means to pass away to immigrate leave
[1:22:39] one's territory to vanish to perish to
[1:22:43] cease to exist oh
[1:22:46] my David a sinner as sinful as he could
[1:22:51] be and yet as soon as he confessed his
[1:22:53] sin God took his sin and caused it to
[1:22:56] cease to
[1:22:57] exist it vanished off of his
[1:23:01] life oh and you know it didn't David
[1:23:05] David didn't have to go and repent and
[1:23:07] sackcloth and Ashes and David didn't
[1:23:09] have to go and and do a bunch of good
[1:23:11] works to to earn the grace of God
[1:23:14] impossible to earn the grace of God he
[1:23:16] didn't have to do anything but confess
[1:23:18] and recognize I am a sinner and I was
[1:23:21] wrong hallelujah amen now
[1:23:25] I believe many times when when God deals
[1:23:27] with a person's life and he begins to
[1:23:29] bring conviction on their life and they
[1:23:31] say you know what I'm a sinner I need to
[1:23:32] get right with God and and they come and
[1:23:34] they they they they kneel down they they
[1:23:36] they confess their sins they give give
[1:23:38] their heart to the Lord and and the Lord
[1:23:39] comes and he brings his forgiveness and
[1:23:41] he washes out that vessel and he
[1:23:43] cleanses it and he gives them the
[1:23:45] Forgiveness they asked for but then
[1:23:47] after a few years go by they become a
[1:23:48] church member and they go to church and
[1:23:50] and they know they they they they act a
[1:23:52] whole lot better they're a lot nicer to
[1:23:53] be around and all these things and then
[1:23:55] what happens is they begin to think oh
[1:23:57] well you know I sinned again and you
[1:23:59] know I'm going to make sure that I'm
[1:24:01] going to go I'm going to be really good
[1:24:03] for the next little while and and I'm
[1:24:04] gonna I'm going to try and earn my
[1:24:09] forgiveness how how did you get your
[1:24:11] forgiveness the first
[1:24:14] time you came down and you said God I'm
[1:24:17] a sinner there's nothing good about me
[1:24:19] but you said there was a blood that I
[1:24:21] could receive and you claimed that blood
[1:24:23] for your for forgiveness that's how
[1:24:25] you're going to get it the next time
[1:24:26] that's how you'll get it every time not
[1:24:28] based off of your merits not based off
[1:24:30] of how good you are but based off of a
[1:24:32] blood sacrifice that was shed for you
[1:24:35] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:24:37] forever God's ways don't change how did
[1:24:40] you get it the first time that's how you
[1:24:42] get it the next time I was hearing
[1:24:43] brother Brams talk about the receiving
[1:24:45] the Holy Ghost he says when you go to
[1:24:46] receive the Holy Ghost don't come to him
[1:24:48] and tell him about how good you are he
[1:24:50] says you come and you say I'm a rascal I
[1:24:52] don't deserve it but you make made an
[1:24:55] invitation on you made a promise and I'm
[1:24:58] here to receive that promise you say oh
[1:25:00] well I want a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:02] I want I want a refilling of the Holy
[1:25:04] Ghost you know I'm going to really pray
[1:25:05] for for every day I'm going to pray
[1:25:07] every day I'm going to do this I'm going
[1:25:08] to do that you're trying to earn
[1:25:10] something from God that's not how you
[1:25:12] receive it it's by Grace you come to him
[1:25:14] you say I'm a rascal I don't deserve
[1:25:16] this but you made an invitation you said
[1:25:19] anybody that desires it could receive it
[1:25:21] and I'm here to receive it
[1:25:25] God's way is by grace and his way
[1:25:28] doesn't
[1:25:31] change if you want the blessings of God
[1:25:34] you come the way of Grace or you won't
[1:25:35] get anything but
[1:25:38] judgment Psalms 103 says bless the Lord
[1:25:41] on my soul and forget not all his
[1:25:43] benefits who forgiveth all thine
[1:25:45] iniquities who Health all thy diseases
[1:25:50] he was a Healer in the Old Testament he
[1:25:52] was a Healer in the New Testament and
[1:25:53] he's A Healer yet today in
[1:25:56] 2024 how do I know that because I've
[1:25:58] experienced his Divine Healing power in
[1:26:01] my
[1:26:02] life I know it as a
[1:26:05] reality there was a woman that came she
[1:26:08] was found guilty guilty as could be
[1:26:11] caught in the very Act of adultery and
[1:26:13] they were they were wanting to get
[1:26:15] nmer and Jesus just asked the question
[1:26:19] whoever is without sin Let Him cast the
[1:26:22] first stone
[1:26:24] and every one of them turned around and
[1:26:27] walked away you know many times we're
[1:26:29] all ready to cast a stone but if we just
[1:26:31] look in our own heart we drop that stone
[1:26:34] pretty
[1:26:36] quick everyone they turned and they
[1:26:38] walked away and Jesus said woman where
[1:26:40] are thine accusers hath no man condemned
[1:26:43] thee and she said no man Lord and Jesus
[1:26:46] said unto her neither do I condemn thee
[1:26:50] you see he was the only one that could
[1:26:52] have cast a stone because he was without
[1:26:55] sin he could have done it but he says I
[1:26:58] do not condemn thee and if he didn't
[1:27:00] condemn her then he won't for condemn me
[1:27:03] because he's still the same today as he
[1:27:05] was
[1:27:06] then if you can recognize his nature you
[1:27:10] can recognize his characteristics you
[1:27:12] can recognize that great is his
[1:27:14] faithfulness and his mercies are new
[1:27:16] every morning when you can begin to
[1:27:17] recognize that then you'll know how to
[1:27:19] get in position you say oh well I want
[1:27:21] the mercy of God I want the the
[1:27:23] Forgiveness of God well how do you get
[1:27:25] it by Grace same way you got it the
[1:27:29] first times the same way you'll get it
[1:27:30] every time God's nature doesn't
[1:27:34] change if God forgave one person he'll
[1:27:36] forgive another person if God healed one
[1:27:38] person he'll heal another person if God
[1:27:41] saved job's family he'll save your
[1:27:44] family you know that job his children
[1:27:46] were saved because he offered a blood
[1:27:49] sacrifice he in his day all that was
[1:27:52] required was job you offer sacrifice and
[1:27:55] he went and he offered that sacrifice
[1:27:57] for his children believing for his
[1:27:59] household and the prophet of God says
[1:28:01] that he is with his children today
[1:28:04] because he offered that sacrifice and
[1:28:06] you know I've thought in my own heart
[1:28:08] sometimes oh I wish I could just do
[1:28:09] something that simple just to offer a
[1:28:11] sacrifice and then I heard the prophet
[1:28:13] say he says we have it even easier than
[1:28:15] that all we have to do is believe on the
[1:28:18] sacrifice that's already been made come
[1:28:20] on if job's silver children were saved
[1:28:23] because of of the blood of a bow or a
[1:28:25] goat how much more will our children be
[1:28:27] saved under the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:30] Christ the perfect
[1:28:32] sacrifice if God Did It for
[1:28:34] job if God Did It For That Centurion
[1:28:38] that beli if God Did It for Rahab who
[1:28:40] got her family in that home how much
[1:28:42] more will he do it for us God doesn't
[1:28:47] change
[1:28:49] Hallelujah God's nature he's he has a
[1:28:53] law if believe for your household shall
[1:28:55] Rahab did it worked job did it it
[1:28:59] worked the scripture says in Isaiah that
[1:29:01] there's going to be a great Millennium
[1:29:03] in this great millenum we're build we're
[1:29:05] going to plant we're going to harvest
[1:29:06] and we're going to a wonderful time and
[1:29:08] it also says that they shall be there
[1:29:10] and offering with them well who's in
[1:29:13] that Millennium I'm be there and you
[1:29:14] know who else be there my children I'm
[1:29:17] not mad out of the scripture and I
[1:29:18] believe the word of God and if he said
[1:29:21] my children are going to be there then
[1:29:22] they're going to be there there's
[1:29:23] nothing that's going to stop that
[1:29:25] because I am a
[1:29:26] believer God doesn't change his nature
[1:29:30] doesn't change his ways don't change how
[1:29:33] he reveals himself one time is how he's
[1:29:35] going to reveal himself another time God
[1:29:38] revealed himself in Exodus 1526 he says
[1:29:41] I am the Lord that Health
[1:29:45] thee Oh you talk about a healing power
[1:29:49] of God when they left Egypt there wasn't
[1:29:51] even a feeble one among them because
[1:29:53] they partook of that Passover Lamb and
[1:29:56] as they partook of that Passover Lamb it
[1:29:57] brought healing to their bodies and
[1:29:59] there wasn't a feeble one among them
[1:30:01] that Passover Lamb was a type of
[1:30:13] the Lord Jesus Christ and as we receive
[1:30:17] the Lord Jesus Christ it quickens our
[1:30:20] mortal
[1:30:21] bodies did you know that as they
[1:30:24] journeyed in the wilderness that their
[1:30:25] clothes didn't wear
[1:30:27] out and in Nehemiah 9:21 it says that
[1:30:31] their feet didn't even
[1:30:33] swell you know why would you why would
[1:30:36] you bring healing to their shoes and not
[1:30:38] healing to their
[1:30:40] feet I think many times we start to
[1:30:42] limit God we say oh well you know this
[1:30:44] is just part of a natural thing if
[1:30:46] you're walking around in a Wilderness
[1:30:47] for 40 years your feet are going to
[1:30:48] swell a little bit yes but you see we've
[1:30:50] got a God Among Us who he breaks those
[1:30:52] laws of nature he changes what you would
[1:30:54] think would be the expected outcome and
[1:30:56] he changes it to a different thing don't
[1:30:59] put up for anything the devil tries to
[1:31:00] put in your life when you have the Lord
[1:31:02] that Health thee in your
[1:31:05] midst their clothes did not wax old and
[1:31:08] then their feet swelled not it says they
[1:31:11] lacked
[1:31:13] nothing now he did that for a bunch of
[1:31:17] people who actually weren't even a part
[1:31:19] of the
[1:31:20] promise
[1:31:22] okay a two million of them came out of
[1:31:25] Egypt there was only two of them that
[1:31:28] actually caught the revelation of what
[1:31:30] God was doing in their hour and yet God
[1:31:33] took care of all of
[1:31:39] them you know what's available to us
[1:31:42] today all
[1:31:45] things
[1:31:47] now when brother brandom came up to that
[1:31:50] pillar of that that that those those
[1:31:52] three rainbows coming up out of the hill
[1:31:53] and that form of the manora lampstand he
[1:31:55] came up there in the message of Grace
[1:31:57] and he was standing there before that
[1:31:58] and that voice cried out and said Jesus
[1:32:01] of the New Testament is Jehovah of the
[1:32:04] old he only changed his mask from Spirit
[1:32:08] to
[1:32:10] man now Jehovah the Healer of the Old
[1:32:13] Testament is Jesus the Healer of the New
[1:32:16] Testament it came from a pillar of fire
[1:32:18] down into a man it was the same God it
[1:32:21] was the same expression that did the
[1:32:23] same works
[1:32:25] it's the pillar of fire once it was a
[1:32:27] man of Flesh another time but it's the
[1:32:29] nature look for the nature look for the
[1:32:32] characteristics of what it is God
[1:32:34] doesn't change his nature but his form
[1:32:37] constantly
[1:32:39] changes now in identify Christ of all
[1:32:42] ages brother Bram says remember God
[1:32:45] changes his form in morphe the Greek
[1:32:48] word means he put on a different mask
[1:32:50] like in Carmen or Shakespeare plays he
[1:32:52] he's like an actor he changes his form
[1:32:53] form all what those prophets were that
[1:32:56] was God in those prophets Jesus said so
[1:33:00] you call them Gods whom the word of God
[1:33:02] came to and here I am the Son of God how
[1:33:05] can you condemn me oh my the same thing
[1:33:08] is today it's God manifested in flesh
[1:33:13] the message of the hour the light of the
[1:33:19] day oh the message of the hour the light
[1:33:22] of the day it's gone manifested in flesh
[1:33:26] God doesn't want to remain in a in a
[1:33:29] book somewhere he doesn't want to remain
[1:33:31] in history somewhere he wants to be
[1:33:33] manifested in flesh that's what this
[1:33:36] message of the hour is about that's
[1:33:38] what's going on it's God having
[1:33:40] preeminence in a
[1:33:43] people here again in Topeka Kansas
[1:33:45] identify Christ of all ages he says dear
[1:33:48] Jesus great Immaculate son of the Living
[1:33:50] God who is here tonight in the form of
[1:33:52] the Holy Spirit
[1:33:54] changed his form and come down and
[1:33:57] revealed his word right in human flesh
[1:34:01] man women of all walks of life showing
[1:34:06] that he still
[1:34:08] lives he's the same yesterday today and
[1:34:12] forever the Messiah is alive today
[1:34:15] friends he's alive and he's manifesting
[1:34:18] himself in men and women of all walks of
[1:34:22] life and it's the same way he's done it
[1:34:24] before it's humility it's Simplicity but
[1:34:27] it's the same Jehovah
[1:34:31] godall oh he says here and mighty God
[1:34:34] unveiled before us I'm identified with a
[1:34:37] group that knows he's unveiled that
[1:34:40] knows he's the same yesterday today and
[1:34:42] forever that know that it's not a
[1:34:44] fanaticism it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:34:47] yesterday today and forever I'm
[1:34:49] identified with that group here tonight
[1:34:52] yet they're called a bunch of heretic
[1:34:54] yet a bunch of fanaticism on account of
[1:34:56] the word of God but I'm not ashamed of
[1:34:59] the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the
[1:35:01] power of God unto salvation and I'm one
[1:35:04] I'm with them living Epistles I spoke of
[1:35:07] Vindicated God veiled in human form in
[1:35:11] men and women
[1:35:14] all God veiled in human form what human
[1:35:19] yeah brother
[1:35:21] Wendell what human
[1:35:25] you see we want to think oh well God
[1:35:27] veiled in human form that was in God's
[1:35:29] Prophet absolutely it was that was the
[1:35:31] manifestation of God in flesh absolutely
[1:35:36] yeah yeah we say oh well you know I can
[1:35:38] see God you know expressing himself and
[1:35:41] brother Wendell I can see that I oh
[1:35:45] that's not what this is about you see
[1:35:47] the gospel isn't about brother Wendell
[1:35:49] and
[1:35:50] Jesus GL it is to him but but you see
[1:35:53] the gospel is about Zachary and
[1:35:56] Jesus the gospel is about what he's done
[1:35:59] in me it's the good news that Jesus
[1:36:01] Christ is raised from the dead and he's
[1:36:03] a liive in my life and if you're looking
[1:36:06] for Jesus somewhere else whether it be
[1:36:08] in the person next to you or back 2,000
[1:36:10] years ago you're missing the reality of
[1:36:13] where he's at if you're a holy ghost
[1:36:15] filled believer then you are a messiah
[1:36:17] of this last
[1:36:19] day God veiled in human form yes
[1:36:24] oh this is a little lengthy but oh it's
[1:36:26] just powerful he says here and mighty
[1:36:28] God unveil before us he says and there
[1:36:30] he stands yet tonight the mighty
[1:36:32] conqueror since he broke every Methodist
[1:36:35] Baptist Presbyterian every other kind of
[1:36:38] veil we need to get away from all the
[1:36:41] veils of well this is what grandpa said
[1:36:42] and you know this is what our fathers
[1:36:44] said and this is what I don't care what
[1:36:46] all those Traditions say I don't care
[1:36:48] what they are I'm looking for what the
[1:36:50] word says I don't care what the
[1:36:51] Pharisees say he's going to be I don't
[1:36:53] care what the sadd are going to say he's
[1:36:55] going to be I want to know what the word
[1:36:57] says he's going to be and if the word
[1:36:59] says that Jehovah God is tabernacled in
[1:37:01] a people if the word says that the deity
[1:37:03] is not in heaven but it's in you then
[1:37:05] that's what I want to believe that's
[1:37:07] where I'm going to stand lay aside every
[1:37:10] tradition every Veil every idea brother
[1:37:13] Wendell you've got ideas of your own
[1:37:15] that's been in your mind for a long time
[1:37:17] that becomes traditions of our own minds
[1:37:20] we've got to break through those
[1:37:21] Traditions that we receive re them from
[1:37:24] denomination we receive them from other
[1:37:25] man's thinking we receive them from
[1:37:27] criticism people saying oh well I don't
[1:37:29] believe that could really happen in you
[1:37:31] or I really don't and you begin to build
[1:37:33] up a complex I don't care what those are
[1:37:35] break through every
[1:37:37] Veil everything that's trying to keep
[1:37:40] Jesus Christ from becoming reality break
[1:37:43] through that Veil until you come into
[1:37:44] that Shina Glory where the pillar of
[1:37:46] fire is war
[1:37:50] swirling he says break every traditional
[1:37:54] barrier he says he still stands among
[1:37:57] his people tonight unconquered by
[1:38:01] Traditions let people say what they want
[1:38:03] to do what they want to anything they
[1:38:06] want to God comes breaking right through
[1:38:09] that sound barrier and remember they
[1:38:11] tell me when a plane really breaks that
[1:38:13] sound barrier there's no limit to its
[1:38:16] speed and I'm telling you when you break
[1:38:18] that traditional barrier there's a
[1:38:21] tradition there's something that we just
[1:38:23] do a tradition is just something you
[1:38:25] kind of always do because everybody else
[1:38:27] does it it's just something you do
[1:38:28] because it's kind of what I've always
[1:38:30] done it's a habit it's just a way of
[1:38:33] life it's something you do constantly
[1:38:36] again and again and again he says here
[1:38:40] break that traditional barrier that
[1:38:43] Jesus is way back and he isn't now okay
[1:38:49] we've got this traditional barrier that
[1:38:51] Jesus is 2,000 years ago we've got this
[1:38:53] barrier of a tradition that says oh well
[1:38:55] that was God God was back in brother
[1:38:57] brandham oh well God's over here God's
[1:38:59] over there and we don't recognize that
[1:39:01] he's here right now he says break that
[1:39:03] traditional barrier that Jesus is way
[1:39:05] back and he isn't now when you find he's
[1:39:08] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:39:10] there's no limit to what God could do
[1:39:13] right here in this
[1:39:14] convention you want omnipotence you want
[1:39:17] unlimited power then recognize that he's
[1:39:20] the same this morning that he was 2,000
[1:39:23] years ago

[1:39:29] baptized with the presence of the Living
[1:39:31] God in morphe in veiling himself into
[1:39:34] human flesh oh he broke every barrier
[1:39:38] every Veil and nothing could hide his
[1:39:40] presence when people gets hungry in
[1:39:43] their heart there's a veil ready to be
[1:39:45] broke you can just depend on that rent
[1:39:48] every veil by his great Holy Spirit and
[1:39:50] here he stands tonight the mighty
[1:39:52] conqueror same yesterday today and
[1:39:54] forever Healing The Sick baptizing the
[1:39:57] Believers just as he always did he's the
[1:40:00] mighty conqueror and doomed devils are
[1:40:03] on the Run yes sir they always are when
[1:40:06] he's
[1:40:07] around I want to declare that he's
[1:40:09] around this morning that same Jesus that
[1:40:12] whenever he came against the devil he
[1:40:14] defeated him that same Jesus is here
[1:40:16] this morning and the devils are doomed
[1:40:18] and they're on the Run they're shaking
[1:40:19] in their boots because they know that if
[1:40:21] you recognize that Jesus Jesus Christ is
[1:40:24] the same today they are utterly defeated
[1:40:26] before that Lord Jesus
[1:40:30] Christ what did the Messiah do when he
[1:40:32] was on Earth 2,000 years
[1:40:34] ago well he went around casting out
[1:40:40] Devils he went around defeating every
[1:40:43] attack of the enemy he went around
[1:40:46] delivering those that were oppressed of
[1:40:48] the enemy he went around preaching the
[1:40:50] Good News of the Gospel of the kingdom
[1:40:52] of God that there was coming a holy
[1:40:54] ghost power that would fill the
[1:40:56] Believers he told them that I will give
[1:40:58] you power to cast out Devils I give you
[1:41:00] power to lay hands upon the sick that's
[1:41:02] what he did he commissioned the people
[1:41:05] when he was on Earth he gathered around
[1:41:06] him some people and he says now I'm
[1:41:08] going to commission you to do the same
[1:41:10] things that I'm doing that's what the
[1:41:12] Messiah did when he was on earth oh it
[1:41:16] was if we were look back 2,000 years ago
[1:41:19] at what Jesus did you know we we could
[1:41:20] go through it but we know what he did we
[1:41:22] know how he was expressed we know the
[1:41:25] power of God was with him and yet the
[1:41:27] religious World couldn't recognize it
[1:41:29] they seen it and it just it didn't come
[1:41:32] the way they expected it and it was
[1:41:34] unrecognized by the world it was it was
[1:41:37] in such Simplicity and humility and and
[1:41:40] you know when we look at the birth of
[1:41:42] Christ nobody believed it unless a
[1:41:45] messenger told
[1:41:48] them
[1:41:50] Mary she didn't just read she she' read
[1:41:53] Isaiah 9:6 that a virgin would conceive
[1:41:56] she'd read that but she didn't know it
[1:41:58] was talking about her wow but you see a
[1:42:01] messenger came he said Mary you're the
[1:42:06] one she would have never believed that
[1:42:09] if a messenger hadn't come and told her
[1:42:11] an angel messenger appeared and says
[1:42:13] you're the one that these scriptures are
[1:42:15] talking about you're the one that these
[1:42:17] prophecies were speaking of and you're
[1:42:19] the one that's going to bring forth
[1:42:21] Emmanuel
[1:42:23] and she yielded to that
[1:42:25] word you know who was it that came to
[1:42:29] his
[1:42:30] birth some
[1:42:32] Shepherds well why did they come why
[1:42:35] didn't the Pharisees come why didn't the
[1:42:37] the the the princes of Judah come you
[1:42:40] see the messenger didn't come to
[1:42:43] them The Messengers The Messenger came
[1:42:47] these little Shepherds up in the
[1:42:49] mountains and he told them listen the
[1:42:52] Fulfillment of prophet
[1:42:54] is today the Mighty God coming down and
[1:42:57] veiling in human flesh Emmanuel it's
[1:43:00] happening today in a little stable down
[1:43:02] there and they believe the messenger and
[1:43:05] because they believe the messenger they
[1:43:07] found the
[1:43:09] Messiah oh you would never accept it you
[1:43:12] would never believe that you could be
[1:43:14] the one that's a part of this prophecy
[1:43:16] unless the the messenger came to you and
[1:43:19] he told you and identified to you what
[1:43:22] the situation
[1:43:26] was Simeon and Simeon and Anna only way
[1:43:30] they knew was the Holy Ghost began to
[1:43:33] Quicken and move and stir you didn't
[1:43:35] find this by reading textbooks you
[1:43:37] didn't find this by by you know
[1:43:39] self-examination you didn't find this no
[1:43:41] it took holy ghost power it took
[1:43:43] quickening power it took the leadership
[1:43:45] of the Holy Spirit to show you where
[1:43:48] Jesus Christ
[1:43:51] was why did those wise men pack up their
[1:43:56] camels and start traveling for two years
[1:43:59] why' they do it because they seen a
[1:44:02] Mystic light in the
[1:44:05] sky they seen his star they seen that
[1:44:09] star and they knew that that Mystic
[1:44:11] light was declaring that he is here now
[1:44:14] on the
[1:44:15] earth they knew what it meant they knew
[1:44:18] the prophecy and when they recognized
[1:44:20] that Mystic light they took off for all
[1:44:22] they were Earth it took them two years
[1:44:24] to get there but they knew that that
[1:44:26] Mystic light would lead them directly to
[1:44:29] Jesus
[1:44:30] Christ hallelu Hallelujah now there was
[1:44:35] a lot of people there who couldn't see
[1:44:37] it they traveled past many a a wise
[1:44:40] person many a good person they came
[1:44:42] right into Jerusalem they came right in
[1:44:44] Jerusalem they thought he would be in
[1:44:46] Jerusalem because I mean that's the
[1:44:48] reasonable place for it to be but he
[1:44:50] wasn't there he wasn't in the temple he
[1:44:53] he wasn't in the Palaces he wasn't in
[1:44:55] there he was over in a little humble
[1:44:56] place in
[1:44:59] Bethlehem oh you know we think they were
[1:45:03] excited they came running in they says
[1:45:05] oh we we we followed that we've seen
[1:45:08] that Pillar of Fire and we're here where
[1:45:10] is he that's born King of the Jews they
[1:45:12] didn't have a clue what he was talking
[1:45:14] about they didn't understand it but you
[1:45:17] see they had seen the Vindication yes
[1:45:20] they knew he had to be there yes
[1:45:23] oh friends we have seen the Vindication
[1:45:26] we've recognized that there has been a
[1:45:28] sign that's been revealed to us and it
[1:45:30] declares that he is
[1:45:35] here
[1:45:36] now Joseph the man that was
[1:45:40] predestinated to be the Earthly
[1:45:42] caregiver of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:45] Joseph who was to take care of Mary
[1:45:48] predestinated for this he wasn't an
[1:45:50] accident it wasn't just something oh
[1:45:52] well Joseph I well I guess we can put
[1:45:54] him into the program no no this a
[1:45:57] predestinated man chosen for this
[1:45:59] purpose and when he hears about Mary
[1:46:02] saying hey I've heard a message and this
[1:46:04] message has told me that I'm going to be
[1:46:07] the one that's going to fulfill these
[1:46:08] prophecies I'm going to be the one he
[1:46:11] says I I I can't that's too much I
[1:46:14] that's I mean I know the scripture talks
[1:46:15] about that but but
[1:46:17] you it was it was too much for
[1:46:21] him and yet he was predestined he was
[1:46:23] one of those Believers he was absolutely
[1:46:25] a Believer but it was too much for him
[1:46:27] you see but then when he got heard from
[1:46:29] the messenger
[1:46:31] himself then because he he thought Mary
[1:46:34] was just trying to use him as a shield
[1:46:36] to protect her from being stoned for
[1:46:37] committing adultery but when he realized
[1:46:40] what was really happening when he heard
[1:46:43] the message and he found out what it was
[1:46:45] all about he was so happy to be her
[1:46:47] Shield he was so glad to Bear the
[1:46:50] reproach that she had on her life
[1:46:52] because she was manifesting the promised
[1:46:54] word it was a joy to him and you might
[1:46:58] think oh well I don't know about being
[1:46:59] identified with these holy rollers or
[1:47:01] this fanaticism or all these different
[1:47:02] things but when you can recognize what
[1:47:04] it's really all about when you can hear
[1:47:06] the message and find out what these
[1:47:08] Messi are supposed to be and see that
[1:47:10] it's a manifestation exactly according
[1:47:12] to scripture you'll be overjoyed to Bear
[1:47:15] the reproach for the cause of
[1:47:19] Christ now brother Ram says and there's
[1:47:22] a sermon brother BR preached in 1961
[1:47:24] January 17th it's called the Messiah and
[1:47:28] uh if you want to listen to some Eagle
[1:47:30] food that's oh and that's that's some
[1:47:32] powerful stuff right there it's h it'll
[1:47:35] choke a chicken any day but it's it's
[1:47:37] some good stuff and brother Brown says
[1:47:40] in there he says God wants eaglets he
[1:47:43] wants Messiahs he wants men and women
[1:47:47] who have signs and wonders anointed ones
[1:47:50] he wants a church that's filled with the
[1:47:52] Holy ghost oh my a church reflecting him
[1:47:55] the same yesterday today and forever God
[1:47:58] didn't die he just borne to Kingdom got
[1:48:02] his Messiahs in it amen every word he
[1:48:05] says they say Amen to it that's right
[1:48:08] yes sir they look like him act like him
[1:48:12] they believe it got the conductor moving
[1:48:14] right on with signs and wonders
[1:48:15] following that's messiah messiah lives
[1:48:19] tonight he isn't dead he's alive forever
[1:48:22] more
[1:48:23] do you believe
[1:48:25] that Messiah lives
[1:48:30] where where is the Messiah where is this
[1:48:33] Great Mighty God that's unveiling
[1:48:35] himself and expressing himself in a
[1:48:37] glorious Church expressing himself with
[1:48:39] signs and wonders following right here
[1:48:42] Amen in Simplicity in humility in
[1:48:45] something you would say well in a in a
[1:48:48] stable in a barn with a bunch of garbage
[1:48:53] yeah that's how he did it the first time
[1:48:55] that's how he's doing it again in an
[1:48:57] unexpected place in an unworthy
[1:49:01] place that Barn wasn't worthy of
[1:49:04] Emanuel but that's where he chose to
[1:49:06] reveal himself
[1:49:11] amen
[1:49:14] GL
[1:49:16] GL when Jesus Christ came to the Earth
[1:49:20] what did he
[1:49:21] do well
[1:49:23] that's what his church is going to do he
[1:49:25] said the works that I do shall you do
[1:49:27] also and in John 1 John 3:8 it says the
[1:49:31] son of for this purpose the Son of God
[1:49:33] was manifested that he might destroy the
[1:49:36] works of the devil so if you're
[1:49:38] wondering what you're supposed to be
[1:49:39] doing this morning you're supposed to be
[1:49:41] destroying the works of the devil that's
[1:49:43] your job description because he says the
[1:49:45] works that I do shall you do also that's
[1:49:48] your commission that's your job and and
[1:49:50] we would think oh well somebody that's
[1:49:51] going to go forth destroying The Works
[1:49:53] of the devil that'll be such a mighty
[1:49:54] powerful fancy looking Christian no just
[1:49:58] a humble sweet little
[1:50:00] mother destroying the works of the
[1:50:03] devil John the Baptist came it was
[1:50:06] completely different to the way they had
[1:50:08] it thought of was some fuzzy faed man
[1:50:10] out in the wilderness dunking people in
[1:50:12] the water it was and we have all these
[1:50:14] prophecies speaking about how the the
[1:50:16] mountains would clap their ham hands and
[1:50:18] the Le the the skip likee little Rams
[1:50:20] all these things talking about it but
[1:50:22] when it came it was so different to the
[1:50:24] way they would have expected it and what
[1:50:26] man calls great God calls foolish and
[1:50:30] what man calls foolish God calls gra
[1:50:36] yes
[1:50:38] now we know that the first Messiah when
[1:50:41] he was on Earth he went around
[1:50:45] and
[1:50:46] he showed them the power of God he
[1:50:49] showed them how to put Satan under under
[1:50:52] their feet he conquered every Gate of
[1:50:55] Hell he destroyed the the kingdom of
[1:50:58] hell he set every captive free and here
[1:51:01] this morning he's Desiring to use a
[1:51:04] people for the same
[1:51:07] purpose see when you see somebody bound
[1:51:09] as a captive to sin God wants to use you
[1:51:13] to go to that person and to bring the
[1:51:16] Liberty that's available to them you
[1:51:19] remember that snake that was trying to
[1:51:20] bite that man brother said angel said it
[1:51:23] was sin he says there's great danger in
[1:51:25] these days and that sin was trying to go
[1:51:26] after that brother and brother brandom
[1:51:28] knew that if it ever got him it would it
[1:51:30] would kill
[1:51:30] him and the angel of the Lord told him
[1:51:33] you've been given power to bind these
[1:51:35] this and others and he bound that sin
[1:51:39] that was going after his
[1:51:44] brother now that would sound like
[1:51:46] something that only Jesus could do and
[1:51:49] you'd be right
[1:51:53] yeah but where's
[1:51:55] Jesus the angel told the prophet he says
[1:51:58] You must be more
[1:51:59] sincere there's a call to a greater
[1:52:02] sincerity when you begin to recognize
[1:52:04] what God's really doing in our lives
[1:52:07] what he's really expressing in our
[1:52:09] natures and in who we are how he's
[1:52:11] wanting to express himself through us it
[1:52:14] should we should just lay aside all the
[1:52:16] carnality of this Earth and and our jobs
[1:52:19] they really aren't that important all
[1:52:21] these things like Jesus was a carpenter
[1:52:23] for a season but then he laid that down
[1:52:25] because his father had a work for him to
[1:52:27] accomplish there's these things that we
[1:52:29] do in life just to get by but that's not
[1:52:31] the main thing the reason we're here on
[1:52:33] Earth is to express Jesus Christ that's
[1:52:36] the focus that's the whole goal of it
[1:52:38] that in this last day he would have a
[1:52:40] people on this Earth that would be flesh
[1:52:42] of his flesh and bone of his bone Spirit
[1:52:44] of his Spirit we should not be
[1:52:45] distracted with our eyes on all the
[1:52:47] other things of the world or worried
[1:52:48] about who's going to be president or all
[1:52:50] these other things those things don't
[1:52:52] matter what matters is that God said
[1:52:55] that he wants to dwell in you and
[1:52:57] express himself through you oh if if you
[1:53:01] KN if you Mary when Mary had that angel
[1:53:05] come to her and explain to her that she
[1:53:07] was going to bring forth Emanuel that
[1:53:09] became the most important thing in her
[1:53:18] life in this last day we have a promise
[1:53:21] of what this glorious church is going to
[1:53:24] be one of those things is that we're
[1:53:26] going to be like Enoch who walked with
[1:53:29] God who pleased God and who was not for
[1:53:32] God took
[1:53:34] him now I I need to close here but let
[1:53:39] me
[1:53:41] uh so in in Malachi chapter 4 it says
[1:53:45] behold the day cometh that shall burn as
[1:53:46] an oven now that's talking about the
[1:53:48] Judgment that's going to come on the
[1:53:50] last days there's going to come a day
[1:53:52] that's going to to burn as an oven
[1:53:53] there's going to be destruction all
[1:53:54] these things are going to happen but
[1:53:55] just before that happens behold I send
[1:53:58] you Elijah the
[1:54:00] prophet just before that day when the
[1:54:02] judgment's going to fall the fire is
[1:54:04] going to strike behold I send you Elijah
[1:54:06] the prophet and so we recognize the a
[1:54:10] pattern of how God's going to work and
[1:54:12] if you'll look back in the days of Sodom
[1:54:14] and Gomorrah just before that place
[1:54:16] burnt as an oven there came a Ministry
[1:54:19] that expressed something to Abraham and
[1:54:23] Sarah right now do you know what
[1:54:26] happened the next day after the
[1:54:28] revealing of the son of man to Abraham
[1:54:30] and
[1:54:32] Sarah
[1:54:34] now the when when when Abraham and Sarah
[1:54:37] were there a man came walking up the
[1:54:39] road he was absolutely a man now uh do
[1:54:43] you have can you give me the pillar of
[1:54:44] fire and brother brandom uh you have
[1:54:46] that picture
[1:54:48] available so I I want to uh just get
[1:54:51] into a little something here if you go
[1:54:52] to questions and answers it's a little
[1:54:54] bit deep um takes a little bit of of
[1:54:57] looking at it but he goes for about 15
[1:54:59] minutes bringing out some different
[1:55:00] things on the revealing of the son of
[1:55:01] man and they said they said somebody
[1:55:05] told me that you were the son of man
[1:55:06] they says I don't understand that
[1:55:08] because I thought the pillar of fire was
[1:55:09] the son of man and brother Brandon
[1:55:12] begins to break that down he says well
[1:55:15] no not exactly he says the the pillar of
[1:55:17] fire is not the son of man he says and
[1:55:22] and I am not the son of man he says I am
[1:55:24] a son of man now in the scripture we
[1:55:28] know in Luke 17:30 it says as it was in
[1:55:30] the days of of lot so shall it be in the
[1:55:32] coming of the son of man and these
[1:55:33] different things it says so shall it be
[1:55:35] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:55:38] now the son of man is that Pillar of
[1:55:42] Fire expressed through a body and
[1:55:46] William brandham was a son of man but
[1:55:49] that Pillar of Fire coming down and
[1:55:51] tabernacling in his flesh he began to
[1:55:54] reveal and express the son of man to the
[1:55:57] people he says I am not the son of man
[1:55:59] but I am a son of man revealing to you
[1:56:02] the son of man now many times we we
[1:56:06] might think that that Pillar of Fire was
[1:56:07] the son of man it's not but you see that
[1:56:10] Pillar of Fire when it comes into a body
[1:56:12] now it is a man a flesh body but it's
[1:56:16] God in that flesh body and the word for
[1:56:18] that is the son of
[1:56:20] man now the prophet when that Pillar of
[1:56:23] Fire would come to them and they would
[1:56:24] prophesy and they would speak they were
[1:56:26] called son of man because it was that
[1:56:28] Pillar of Fire expressing itself through
[1:56:30] them when Jesus Christ was here on this
[1:56:33] earth and the fullness of the godhead
[1:56:35] bodily in that man he was called the son
[1:56:39] of
[1:56:40] man
[1:56:42] now Abraham and Sarah are sitting up
[1:56:45] there at a tent and a man comes walking
[1:56:49] up the road with that Pillar of Fire and
[1:56:52] inside of him you know what that is
[1:56:55] that's the son of
[1:56:57] man it was the son of man that came to
[1:57:00] Abraham and Sarah in their tent and
[1:57:02] began to speak to them and began to show
[1:57:05] them by a prophetic sign of the
[1:57:06] Discerning of the thoughts and intense
[1:57:08] of the heart telling what Sarah was
[1:57:10] thinking in the tent behind him
[1:57:12] manifesting and showing him a sign of
[1:57:13] who he was now do you know what happened
[1:57:17] the next day after that revealing of the
[1:57:20] son of man to Abraham and Sarah
[1:57:22] Prophet says now Sarah and Abraham got
[1:57:25] got way down till they was hundred years
[1:57:27] old and I can see Abraham get up the
[1:57:30] next morning he said dear you know Sarah
[1:57:33] Sarah was a beautiful woman when she was
[1:57:35] young and said say dear do you know what
[1:57:38] your hair is turning dark
[1:57:40] again he said they got up the next
[1:57:42] morning and her hair was turning dark
[1:57:44] again I see all the wrinkles going out
[1:57:46] from under your face since last night
[1:57:49] well she said dad I noticed your
[1:57:50] shoulders are straight up oh my a few
[1:57:54] hours later he went out to get a bucket
[1:57:56] of water or something maybe come back
[1:57:58] and said Sarah you look beautiful she
[1:58:00] said why Abraham you look like you did
[1:58:03] when I married
[1:58:06] you when did that happen the next
[1:58:09] morning all right after the revealing of
[1:58:12] the son of man all right says here again
[1:58:15] he says now Abraham the next morning
[1:58:17] getting up why Sarah you know what your
[1:58:19] your your wrinkles are going out of your
[1:58:21] face no other place Abraham said then
[1:58:23] Abraham next morning he looked up and he
[1:58:25] said Sarah honey your eyes are turning
[1:58:28] black again your hair the graay are
[1:58:30] leaving from
[1:58:32] it now why is that important why does
[1:58:35] that
[1:58:36] matter because it's the hour we're
[1:58:38] living
[1:58:39] in we can see what God did in Abraham
[1:58:42] and Sarah and we can see the pattern and
[1:58:44] we can recognize where we're at right
[1:58:46] now we're not looking for the son of man
[1:58:48] to come we've already recognized the
[1:58:50] manifestation of the son of man we've
[1:58:52] seen that and we know that the next
[1:58:54] thing in the course the next thing in
[1:58:56] the pattern is the changing of our
[1:58:58] mortal
[1:59:00] bodies oh here in the Easter seal he
[1:59:02] says that's the same thing he's going to
[1:59:04] do next after that remember Abraham and
[1:59:06] his group and the next thing come was
[1:59:09] that
[1:59:10] change oh now we done seen everything
[1:59:12] justification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:14] placing of the sun signs and wonders of
[1:59:16] him being in his presence to discern the
[1:59:18] thoughts of the heart and so forth and
[1:59:20] he said as it was in the days of Sodom
[1:59:23] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:59:24] of man we see that taking place right
[1:59:27] now what was the next thing the change
[1:59:31] of the
[1:59:32] body so where are we at what's next are
[1:59:36] we looking for another day to come no
[1:59:40] we're not looking for another day we're
[1:59:41] not looking for another messenger we're
[1:59:43] not looking for another visitation we
[1:59:45] recognize where we're at we recognize
[1:59:47] the pattern of the scripture we know
[1:59:49] that just before the changing of the
[1:59:51] body is to happen there's going to be a
[1:59:53] revealing of the son of man and we've
[1:59:55] seen it we've recognized it and that
[1:59:57] tells us that we're at the hour of the
[2:00:00] changing of our mortal
[2:00:02] bodies what God did once he'll do again
[2:00:06] what God did for Abraham and Sarah he's
[2:00:08] going to do again he's going to change
[2:00:10] our mortal bodies and we shall be
[2:00:14] quickened in Genesis 19:27 it says and
[2:00:17] Abraham got up early in the morning to
[2:00:20] the place where he stood before the Lord
[2:00:22] now that morning that he's talking about
[2:00:24] right there was the morning his Earthly
[2:00:25] body was
[2:00:26] changed and he looked toward Sodom and
[2:00:29] Gomorrah and toward all the land of the
[2:00:30] plain and behold and low the smoke of
[2:00:32] the country went up as the smoke of a
[2:00:35] furnace that's where we're living at
[2:00:38] we're living at just moments any moment
[2:00:40] now we look at Russia and how they're
[2:00:42] they're amping up their nuclear program
[2:00:43] and all these things going on we see the
[2:00:45] Earth coming to a fiery destruction we
[2:00:48] see everything's coming to a close but
[2:00:50] just before that happens for we're going
[2:00:52] to be changed in our Earthly bodies and
[2:00:54] we're going to look out and we're going
[2:00:55] to see the smoke of Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:00:57] going up as a furnace but we received
[2:00:59] aij of the Prophet before that great and
[2:01:01] Dreadful coming day of the Lord we
[2:01:03] received the messenger and he told us a
[2:01:06] message and we received that message we
[2:01:08] would believe that message we have
[2:01:10] recognized the revealing of the son of
[2:01:12] man we have recognized that Mystic light
[2:01:14] that Vindicated that he is here we
[2:01:17] recognize the Messiah is in our midst we
[2:01:19] recognize that he's the same yesterday
[2:01:21] today day and forever and that he is
[2:01:24] alive here today in a people and this we
[2:01:28] say unto you by the word of the Lord
[2:01:30] that we which are alive and remain un
[2:01:32] the coming of the Lord the Lord shall
[2:01:34] not prevent them which are asleep for
[2:01:37] the Lord himself shall descend from
[2:01:39] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[2:01:41] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[2:01:43] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[2:01:46] then we which are alive and remain shall
[2:01:48] be caught up together with them in the
[2:01:50] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[2:01:53] so shall we be ever with the Lord the
[2:01:57] Messiah is coming for
[2:02:02] Messi oh the Lord Jesus Christ Mr Jesus
[2:02:06] Christ is coming for misss Jesus
[2:02:10] Christ God's not going to be unequally
[2:02:13] yolked together do not the scriptures
[2:02:16] say ye are

[2:02:21] yoke together when Jesus Christ comes
[2:02:24] he's going to be United with Mrs Jesus
[2:02:26] Christ who will be flesh of his flesh
[2:02:28] and bone of his bone life of his life
[2:02:30] Spirit of his Spirit she is
[2:02:34] him as he was Messiah she is Messi
[2:02:38] little Messiah amateur Gods under God
[2:02:42] what was Adam Adam was a Son of God he
[2:02:45] was a god what is this bride she is
[2:02:50] Jesus Christ expressed expressed in a

[2:02:54] form the Messiah coming for his
[2:02:58] Messiah let's just stand to our feet
[2:03:01] this

[2:03:04] don't look for him in palaces don't look
[2:03:07] for him in fancy Cathedrals and and big
[2:03:10] fancy buildings somewhere God's never
[2:03:12] shown himself that way he always comes
[2:03:16] in Simplicity in
[2:03:18] humility he comes in an unexpected way
[2:03:21] and when we look around we we can see
[2:03:23] the conditions of the earth we see the
[2:03:25] chaos that's all around us but you know
[2:03:28] when we recognize the hour we're in that
[2:03:30] we're just in the last few closing
[2:03:31] moments of
[2:03:33] time we shouldn't be so distracted by
[2:03:35] all these other things around us but we
