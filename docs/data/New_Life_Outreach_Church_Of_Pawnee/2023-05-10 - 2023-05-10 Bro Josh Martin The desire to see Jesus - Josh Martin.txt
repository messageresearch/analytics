future that I love [Music] my years [Music] to live [Music] I want to see Jesus amen do you want to see him tonight in the power of his resurrection proclaiming he's the same yesterday today and forever you know we just came through Easter brother Brandon says Easter means Redemption he says Easter gives the flowers a right to come back to life he says whatever it's lost and may have lost its fruit may have lost its Bloom but when Easter comes around it says it's the right for it to bloom again and maybe you've lost your joy or your peace or your love but it's Easter time it's the resurrection and it's given you the right to have your joy to have your peace to have your healing to have your deliverance and I believe all things are possible tonight to them that believe I mean I believe we can see Miracles it may be a Wednesday night but I believe there's an atmosphere created where all things are possible amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to John 12 and 18. you happen to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen praise the Lord John 12 and 18. and before we read let's Bob our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to say thank you for giving us this opportunity Lord for pulling on us Lord tucking our heart to come into your presence Lord God maybe never take this for granted God the opportunity we have to come into your house God and fill your presence where we can push everything aside Lord and and best into your presence Lord I ask that you would come and be in the service God lord as if I I've studied and I've prepared Lord for tonight Lord you place this thought upon my heart and I ask that you would help me to get myself out of the way Lord and you speak to these lips of Clayton night father Lord May there be a heart to receive the word tonight we ask these things in your precious name amen in John 12 let's let's go up to the 17th verse John 12 and 17. the people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead bear record for this cause the many people also met him for they had heard that he had done this miracle and the Pharisees therefore said among themselves perceived ye how ye Prevail nothing behold the world has gone after him and there was a certain Greeks among them that come up to worship at the feast and the same came therefore to Philip which was a bethesita of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus amen as the Lord blesses his word you can have your seats um if I had a simple subject tonight with the desire to see Jesus and I have been going through the the services sir we would see Jesus and there's so much in those messages if you haven't listened to him in a while there's there's a bunch of them maybe 12 I'm not exactly sure but there's a bunch of them so if you ever listen to him in a while I would encourage you to go and listen to them so that's what I'll be drawing a lot of tonight out of would be those messages but I like how the Bible puts it they desired to see Jesus before they ever found Philip before they ever ever came to that location the Bible says there were certain Greeks I like how the I like that word search and it's not a peculiar or or or or something like that but it's somebody that has chosen some uh I chose my my Loretta to be my wife so I chose a certain somebody it's somebody that I chose to live with to express my life with and I believe that God chose these Greeks a certain uh there's there's many people in Greece many people around that that part of the country but God chose those people in place of desire in their hearts that they would come and see Jesus and I believe before you can ever see Christ there must be a desire to see Christ but the the definition of Desire is too long or hope for the Bible says in Mark 11 24 therefore are saying to you whatsoever things ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them so he's saying here before you ever come praying before you ever come asking you have to desire something before you can ask it before you can go and buy something go to store you have to have a desire to go and purchase something before you go to the to White so you need or yeah Williams if you need a loaf of bread before you go to the store you have a desire and I like how daddy preached a sermon the other day on on the need he says before the before a fan was created there was a need to know there was something how did you put there there was a need for the fan before it was recreated and I believe before God was ever on the earth before Christ ever came to the Earth there was a need there was a desire and I believe seeing the supernatural starts with the desire before you can pray for something you have have to have a desire brother Branham says you get so much guard on the inside that you can seek him everywhere you look see but until that desire to see him you won't ever see him he says you can see him in the Sun so you can you can hear him in the call of the bird you can watch him everywhere he's on every hand but the old man had so much of God on the inside that he could see God everywhere he's talking about the boy that he wanted to see God he came up to his mother and said Mama can anybody see God and she said Son go ask the preacher she goes up to the preacher and says preacher can anybody see God and he says no son nobody can see God and live and being disparaged he goes to the to the Sunday school teacher he says Sunday school teacher can anybody see God and she said no son nobody can see God and live and this boy was heartbroken why serve a God that you can't see why serve a God that you can't experience the realities of it and that's a good question why should the god that you can experience why server God that you can't see the power of and this boy was walking down the road brother Brandon says and he's seen a a fisherman setting in a boat he had tears coming down his face he was looking up at a rainbow crying and the boy ran and jumped you to the man's lap and said sir can anybody see God and he stopped and he said son that's all I've seen for the last 35 years he's gone there was a preacher there was a mama there was a Sunday school teacher all looking at the same Sunset looking at the same rainbow but they didn't have a desire to see God but there was an old man that had been through some storms that have been through some hard times been through some struggles but there was still a desire on the inside to see God no matter what he went for no matter the circumstance and I say this evening I don't care where you have if there's a desire to see the resurrection if there's a desire to see the resurrection their savior there's a resurrected Savior for you to see you can experience the realities of his presence you can experience the realities but it first starts with the desire you see a desire makes you look for something the Bible says you have not because you ask not and you don't ask because there's not a desire like I said you're not going to go to the grocery store unless there's a desire so it first starts with the desire but that desire has to be in the right direction you can have a desire for something but if that desire is perverted it's going to send you in the wrong direction and brother praying says that every every man is born with the thirst and The Thirst is to be a it's the first after God after his things but the devil would like to pervert that desire and push you towards the things of the world so even though there's a desire there if the devil gets a hold of it it's going to point you in the wrong direction and I believe even though you you have a desire to see Jesus Christ if you're not pointed in the right direction you're going to be chasing an imaginary thought you're going to chase a Creed you're going to try chase a Dogma but if somebody can point you in the right direction and say right over here is Christ you're no longer walking this way but your direction has changed towards that towards the desire that is on the inside and I love that I love the scripture about Philip and the eunuch I talked about it here before but the Bible says that there was a eunuch that was reading the scriptures Isaiah 53 he was reading these scriptures and the angel of the Lord come to Philip and says go to that man and as he come to that man he heard him reading the scripture and he says sir do you understand what you read and he says how can I unless a man guides me and that just stood out to me he was reading the Bible he was reading prophecy he was reading inspiration but without somebody to appoint him in the right direction that desire was going to lay dormant and I believe we had a message in this last day but God knew there was going to be a desire for you to see Jesus Christ there was going to be a desire for you to the the experience the realities of the Resurrection but before you can see that he needed something to guide you and say this is the direction this is the way this is the way you can see Jesus Christ and I believe this message has opened our eyes where we can see that Jesus Christ ain't something in the Tomb Jesus Christ ain't something of yesterday but he's the same yesterday today and forever hope and the bearing them says too many he says men are people getting in their minds that they're looking at for looking to what God did yesterday and looking for him to do something but fail to see what he's doing today but there's a message it's come and says your desire is right but you need something to guide you oh my brother Brandon he says in that in that message sir would we see Jesus he says too many people is living in a glare of the light he says that glare is a part of the light but it's not the light but in order to get out of the glare you gotta come to prison truth oh come on now before he says to the there's a lot of old people that is looking in yesterday years and putting makeup on that they're putting things on that are trying to make them look young instead of living in today and he says that's where many church members failed oh that's where they live is the looking of something yesterday instead of looking in the light the God gave this state what's the bible say that in the evening time it shall be light we're not looking in the light of yesterday we're now looking for a life to come but this message has has brought a light where we can slam it's pointed Us in the right direction oh my you see we we did a lot of traveling uh before we came back home I think we traveled over 4 000 miles I believe but before we can go from place to place we needed something to give us a direction even though we had a desire to go to South Carolina than the North Carolina then to Virginia than the Tennessee then the Kentucky we first had to have something give us the direction even though we have the desire we had we had the car we had gas it had a battery it had a spark plug it had the means to get us to our desire but we needed something to point us in the right direction and before we can get pointed in the right direction we needed to find something that was capable of giving us the direction Hallelujah I couldn't come to this chair and say take me to or watch the directions to South Carolina even though the shame is good it's very useful it has its purpose there's nothing in that chair that can give me the direction I can come to this speaker and say speaker give me the direction to Florida give me the direction to Indianapolis but even though the brother the speaker has a good purpose but it's not its purpose to give me a direction but what I needed to do was put my desire in my GPS come on somebody put my desire in my GPS then I was no longer guessing the way I was going there was a direction there was a guide that was telling me each turn I needed to take telling me you need to go 50 miles on this highway then you're going to turn left then you're going to go this way a certain amount of miles I found the direction that was fulfilling my desire and I believe God has given us a message that is fulfilling our desire we're not wishy-washy questions we're not hope and sore we're not thinking maybe so but there's a Direction that's been give it to the bride we can see the realities of Jesus Christ her mother's a Direction that's been given a first had to find something capable they've given me the direction and oh my you're safe man's Creeds is not capable of giving us the direction to a Rapture means ideas he's not capable of giving us the direction to the realities of Jesus Christ we needed something to fulfill our desire and give us our direction oh mine I like how the Bible is putting that Jesus is saying blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness so not just hungering and thirsting but they got something that they're thirsting for and the Bible says for they shall be filled it's a promise it's not a hope so but if you're thirsting and you're Desiring for God then you shall be filled you see but before you can recognize something you gotta realize you need it you see many people can look at this message and say it's nothing it's created it's men's ideas it's just man's theology it's just a just a kentuckian's words they don't have a need for it but for those who has a need for a guide for a direction you recognize that's what I have need of oh man you see us electricians we like the whole punch the hole punch kid you know their dad bought the first one I think that we've seen around here he bought it at a pawn shop for dirt cheap because the guy didn't know what he had if he knew what he had he wouldn't have gave it away he he didn't recognize that what it was meant to be used for but there was somebody that had a need for it come on now there's somebody that had a desire for it and since there was a desire for it there was something to recognize hey this is going to take away a lot of hard work oh man if you can just recognize that this a message is the direction that we need it we don't got to work nothing up we don't gotta work our way to our rapture we don't gotta work our way to a body change the desire on the inside says this is what I have need of this is what I have need of oh my but before the hole punch hit we already you saw we got to use whole sauce and sometimes the holes would get walled out and it would be too big we need WD-40 and there'll be shavings everywhere but there was something that was invented that would fulfill the desire and God has sent something to layer to share that would fulfill the decided the desire But first you have to hunger and first for it first you've got to understand and realize that you have need of it you look at Revelations one and three blessed is he that readeth for they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are therein for the time is at hand blessed is he that readeth and invade that heareth you see the blessing is realizing that this prophecy is what I have need of I'm not just reading it but I'm hearing the words I'm understanding the words I'm putting yet hang to action you look down Luke 8 and 4. and much people were gathered together and when and will come to him out of every city and he's speak by a parable so there was an attraction that was gathering all of these people together but once they heard the parable there was no desire to see the revelation of the parable but there was somebody's there were some disciples that stopped him and says hang on a second what does this mean you go to the eighth verse and the Bible says A sower he's speaking of the parable A sower went out thy soul to sow his seed and he sowed some fell by the wayside and was trotting down and the founders of the air devoured it some fell upon a rock and as soon as as soon as they were sprung up it wilted away because of lack of moisture and some fell among the thorns and the Thorns sprang with it and it choked it out and other fell on good ground and sprang it up and Barefoot a hundred-fold and when he said these things he cried out he that happened ear to hear Let Him hear so he throws it out he that has a desire to hear this prophecy let him hear it but they turned away and there was no desire but the next verse says and his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be they didn't turn around and leave Jesus there was a desire saying what's you you got is the revelation come on now you might not understand this message yet but if there's a desire on the inside you can't turn away you know there's something in this message that is calling doubts through the dis to the desire the desire the next verse and Jesus says and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that sing they might not see hearing they might not understand but then he stops and he says this so plainly now the parable is this the seed is the word of God so he's speaking the parable to the ones that has no desire but then he stops it says since you're asking since you're seeking since there's a desire this is the parable this is the Revelation we're no longer guessing who Jesus Christ is the Revelation has been made known to the ones that has a desire the ones that is shaking brother Branham says Christ only reveals himself to the ones that is looking at looking for him his first has to be a desire oh my you looked at uh II Chronicles 9 and 12. hey King Solomon gave to the Queen of Sheba all her desire all of her desires she he started to give to her and when I love about the story is there was something on the inside of the Queen of Sheba before she ever left her a land before she ever left her home there was a desire to see a living God no doubt there was there was many gods in her lands there was many prophets there was many holy men there was many prophecies there was many of these things but that still did not fulfill the desire that was on the inside but the Bible says she started to hear the fame of Solomon she started to hear of a supernatural God in another in another land and you notice what she did she was willing to give up everything to go and fulfill the desire oh come on now if you're not willing to give up everything to find Jesus Christ you're never going to find him but if you're willing to give up everything to lay down creature to lay down Traditions to lay down ideas then watch that watch God leads you to himself that you can fulfill what he placed on the inside on my first Kingston and one and when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she came to prove him with hard questions hey she didn't come to play she says if this is of God I'm going to ask some questions I'm going to share if this is of God or not and before she ever asked the questions Solomon started to reveal the answers come on now that was a supernatural God revealing himself to somebody that had a calling on the inside and if there's something on the inside that is wanting to save Jesus Christ of today there's Jesus Christ on Earth waiting for you to come and look for him I say you don't gotta look any longer the word Jesus Christ has been revealed for you to see him if there's a desire on the inside to search for him oh my God the Bible says in Matthew 12 and 42 and the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she come from the other most parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here she was willing to forsake everything but the Branham says she went across the desert not in a train not in a in a car not in an airplane but she went on a camel in order to find the in order to find a living God hey simple and the Bible says that she's going to judge the generation because a greater than Solomon is here that was just a man with a gift but in this day we've Jesus Christ not a man not a guest not a personality but the person the word Jesus Christ is here a greater than Solomon is here hey is still held a sick he can still feel with the Holy Ghost he can still deliver he can still set free he can still give you a joy he can still give you a peace a greater than Solomon is here but are you willing to forsake it all to go and find him oh my brother put him gives a drama he says they're her priest which say oh no that's just Fanatics over there don't go over there and look but she wasn't going to let the doubt the Skeptics the naysayers keep her from seeing a living God oh come on now we got too many people that has a desire but they're letting what other people say keep them from seeing Jesus Christ but if you can push past it all and press and press to a revelation you won't leave the same way that you did that you came in and the Bible says in Philippians 3 and 13. brother I count not myself to have apprehended but there's one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before this was the Queen of Sheba that did this very thing she forgot the things that was behind her and she started to press to the mark rest towards the calling oh come on now if there's a calling on the inside there's something to fulfill that calling but first you got to know where to look you got to know where the brother Branham says if you don't know what you're looking for how can you find him you remember when Joseph and Mary they left Jesus in Jerusalem the Bible says they realize that Jesus was missing and they stop and they looked for Jesus among Kinfolk and acquaintances they had a desire to find Jesus but they didn't know what to look come on now in order for them to find Jesus they had to change their Direction and say he's not here and if he's not here he must be somewhere come on now if you've looked for Christ in Traditions if you've looked for Christ and preached if you've looked for Christ in men's ideas and you haven't found him yet he's got to be somewhere he's got to be somewhere don't don't quit don't stop looking for Christ for he is here in the power of his resurrection through the form of his word saying come unto me all ye that are leather that are heavy burden I will give you rest but first there has to be a desire hope this is okay this evening but once they change their Direction they can find Jesus but you notice the closer they got to Jesus there was other influences that started to rise up and tried to change their Direction because you notice whenever she found Jesus she says Jesus your father and I have searched for you with many tears and right there brother Branham says she denied the Virgin birth because she was trying to impress the priests she didn't want to look crazy by saying that he you know that was a virgin birth but she says this is your father and right there she scarred her testimony because of the alma because of the influences around her the closer she got to Jesus the stronger the influences God and let me say this the closer you get to Jesus the closer so you get to the revelation of who he really is influences or going to try to turn you away influences it's going to try to turn you another Direction but keep pressing keep pressing in the right direction because on the other side of the press is Jesus on the other side of the press is the reality of the desire that is on the inside but you got to know where to look brother Branham says how would you go to hunt for a pumpkin and you never seen one before and never heard of one he says how would you go to find a watermelon if you never know there was such a thing and how it looks why why you can find a tub and think it was a watermelon you can find something else you can find a block and think it was a watermelon but you got to know what you're looking for I can say this hanky is a watermelon but if you don't know what a watermelon is you're going to believe me and the Bible says in Colossians 2 and 8 beware lest any man spoil you through through the philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ so if you don't got something that is guiding you to Christ any tradition any idea any Creed can turn you away after the traditions of men but I'm not worried or I'm not concerned about traditions of men I'm wanting to find Jesus I'm not worried about what other people are saying I want to see Jesus and if that is your attitude tonight Hanukkah what they think of me I don't care what they say about me I want to see Jesus there's a desire on the inside that is wanting to see Jesus oh man the Bible for the praying him says they're looking and don't know what they're looking for because they've got their own conception of what they're trying to find and how would you know what to find if you didn't know what you was looking for he says they don't know what to find because they've got the wrong conception and that's what the Bible says to be aware of unless a man in philosophy and vain deceit point you towards their traditions instead of of Christ but I believe if you can ever get a revelation of Jesus Christ through this message you're not going to be pointed in another Direction you see the counterfeit don't take the value of the genuine away but it increases the value of it because the more counterfeit dollar bills there are the more valuable the genuine dollar bill is and there's many counterfeits out there this Towner fits that man's ideas and traditions but that's just making the revelation of Jesus Christ the more valuable hey and the more hard to find you notice I I know we've given this example many times but unless you don't got the light to shine on the counterfeit you're not going to know the difference you know when you go to a store and you buy something and you give a hundred dollar bill what's the first thing they do they put it up in the light and that light exposes it either for the genuine or for a counterfeit and before the lights ever exposes it it's got a purchasing power it's got a power to purchase until it's exposed that once it's exposed it loses its power it loses its Authority amends trades and traditions has a purchasing power over you until it's exposed by the light and the message has exposed Traditions it's exposed Creeds and says it's the work of the devil but the genuine is here the crates and the Traditions didn't push the word out of the picture it's just made it more valuable if you can see it oh my so what happens after you give a counterfeit they say no this is the counterfeit this ain't going to work here there's no Authority behind it there's no purchasing power behind it and it's refused and you know brother Branham says that the devil has no real power he says it's just a it's a perversion of the power of God but then he says but it is a power it's not a real power but it still has the power if it's not exposed hey come on now I said that's still a power until it's exposed and once it's exposed it loses its hold and I believe there's a bride without spot or with our wrinkle because the power The Works of the enemy has been exposed by the revelation of Jesus Christ oh my you see we got to make sure we're Guided by the by the genuine not by the counterfeit you look at Ecclesiastes 11 and 3. if the clouds be full of rain make empty themselves upon the Earth and if the tree fall toward the South or toward the North in the place where the tree falleth there it shall be in other words if the direction of the tree is falling this way it's not going to land here if it's falling this way it's not going to land here so in other words the direction that the tree is falling is where the destination of it's going to be oh come on now we can expect our destination to be the realities of Jesus Christ if the following the direction of Maine's ideas and traditions hey I'm preaching now we can't expect us to be going this way if we're driving that way the message come to pull you out and say no that is the counterfeit but the genuine is here if there's a desire to see it oh we gotta know the direction we got to know what we're looking for brother Branham says we got to know what we're looking for for Christ he says if you're looking for somebody with nail prints in their hands anybody can do that he says any hypocrite can ever Crown of Thorns have straps on its back but you don't find Christ by the outward appearance of a man you don't find him in the garments he says he says overseas he's been places where there's many there's dozens of certified nails that was crucified that held Christ to the Cross he says How can there be dozens when there was only three he says everybody's got the Revelation everybody but there's only three so he says if you're looking for Christ in the garments if you're looking for Christ in the flesh you're going to fail to find him but you've got to find him in the living realities of what he was in the Bible Almighty says in order to find him today you gotta find him of yesterday for he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says the way he acted in the Bible is what is the way he's acting today you look at Matthew 24 and 24 for this shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so it's the word that identifies the counterfeit because this false prophets this false Christ that is rising up and showing great things but if wasn't for the word identifying the true from the false we want to know what to look for but thank God for the word that says no Christ ain't in a tradition but Christ is right here in his word you look at Matthew 24 and 28 for wheresoever the carcass is where the Eagles will be gathered together so the same time that those false christs are rising up and deceiving many there's another group that's being attracted to the carcass which is the word there's a desire on the inside that's not attracted to the false Christ the false prophets but there's something on the inside that is longing for Jesus Christ sir we desire do we receive Jesus Christ you notice he didn't go straight to Jesus he went to somebody that knew Jesus he needed somebody I hope your hope is making sense tonight he come to Philip he knew Philip had been with Jesus so he knew if I can just get to this one he can take me like hell our pastor was bringing it out Sunday men don't like being led by men but that's the way God orchestrated him was a man to be led by men brother Branham says if God wanted the rocks to preach he would have the Rocks preach if he wanted the birds to preach he would have the birds preach but he called man to preach he called man to reveal the revelations of Jesus Christ and so the Greeks came to Philip and said show us Jesus I know you've been with him I know you've been with him there's something different about you show us Jesus you see so the attraction of the Bride is always the word brother Branham says what God is never changes he can't say one thing and then change his mind he can't do one thing then change his opinion or change his idea he says whenever God said he can he would only accept the blood sacrifice when he loses when he refused Cain he says that's the way it's always going to be he can never change his mind but then he says if a man is healed according to his faith then the next one that comes with faith he's got to heal him because it's on the same basis of their Revelation so if somebody in here is going to revelation of Jesus Christ because they they've seen him in this message that means he's not going to change if there's somebody else that's got a craving to see Jesus he's not going to change his way but you see the only way to identify him today is to see what he did yesterday and that's only through the Bible and not believe that the Bible has got to be the direction we've got to learn how ideas our opinions everything that we think and believe goes right back to the Bible you look at John 1 and 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God then you come down to the 14th verse and the Word was made flesh and so the word didn't change when it come into flesh the actions of the word come inside of the flesh body Jesus Christ to prove to the world that the word was on the Earth come on now then whenever Christ was crucified and went back to back to heaven the word still didn't change the words still it did not change and you see the entire chapter of John is pretty incredible I started studying some event here here recently and it's a good chapter the first chapter of John but the Bible says that John the Baptist he seen Christ and said Behold the Lamb of God he was sent there to Proclaim and announce that Jesus Christ was coming to the Earth but you notice how his Direction changed it went from he is coming to Now Behold he is here he was in Christ himself there was many people that come up there that come up to John and says are you the one are you the one we're looking for or where are we to look for another are we looking for the for another one and he says I'm not even worthy to loosen the shoes of the one that is coming you see so his Direction was he is coming but then all of a sudden it changed from his coming to he is here and what I love about it is whatever he says Behold the Lamb of God his disciples the ones that was following him the Bible says ran after Christ that I no longer staying with the man I'm going after Christ and that's why I don't believe in dear find the prophet I don't believe that brother praying him was Jesus Christ no sir he was strong the Baptist letting you know that Jesus is coming and now he's not just coming but he is here in the power of his resurrection to heal the sick the set free to bound to loose the captives to break down the prison bars to bind up of the brink of a to loosen up the Bruce and the ones that is in prison uh believe it here he announced that Jesus is here so the the one of the ones that ran after Christ was Andrew and the Bible says that he ran back to Peter and says Peter the Messiah is here the Christ the one we've been waiting on is here we don't got to look any longer and the Bible says that Peter ran with him to Christ and what I love about the scripture is Before Peter ever said a word Jesus turned and says this is Simon Peter this is Simon Peter the son of Jonah before he had ever seen him he started to reveal who he really was and that was a sign to Peter that this is the messiah come on now you see it wasn't the garments that revealed to Peter that the Messiah was here it was the revealing of the word it was prophecy that was being revealed that opened up his eyes you look at Deuteronomy 18 and 15 the Lord thy God shall rise up rise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of the Brethren like unto me and unto him ye shall hearken and what's the Bible saying Hebrews 4 and 12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two Rich sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Mora and there's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so what's a discerner is the word and the bus the bible say that the word of the Lord come to prophets and so this was a revelation to Peter but the word of the Lord is on Earth if he is proving the signs of the Messiah he was no longer looking but the actions of Jesus was manifesting the revelations of the scripture oh and I believe that the message that we got in this day is the manifesting the revelations that has been poured out in this day we don't got to look for another but we have found the one we're looking for you look at John 4 and 25 the woman saith unto him I know the Messiah cometh which is called Christ and when he has come he will tell us all things in Jesus saith unto her I speak unto thee I am he and she ran away she dropped the water parts and I've given the example before but you notice she was arguing with Jesus whenever he said give me something to drink he says she stopped and she says we've got no dealings with each other's you're a Jew I'm a Samaritan but then Jesus stops he noticed that she had a desire but she needed the right direction so he stops and he says if you knew who I was you would ask of me to drink but you notice what her excuse was her argument was you've got no buckets to get water she was arguing with what she had in her hand but after she was at the revelation of Christ was revealed the Bible says she dropped all water pots she dropped what was holding her back from seeing the Messiah and says come see a man isn't this the Christ the anointed one and maybe you're hanging on to some things that is keeping you from seeing the Christ but if you can just drop the buckets if you can disrupt the theology if you can disrupt the ideas and realize this is the Christ this is the one we're waiting on this is the Messiah Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's the Messiah hope this is okay brother Branham says there's three times there's three nationalities he says there's the Gentiles the Jews and the Samaritans and he says the the Messiah sign was revealed to the Jews then it was revealed to the the Samaritans but as never was revealed to the Gentiles until this day and so the same signs that he did with the with the Samaritan when he started to reveal the heart of the Samir the woman of the well that was the Messiah sign that was revealing to her that the sign of the Messiah is here and what he did with Nathanael remember Nathanael he was that he was under the tree and I believe it was it was Philip that ran up and says hey come see the Messiah the man of Love The Man from Nazareth and you notice he was a little skeptic he stopped and he says can any good thing come out of Nazareth he was skeptic because there was many opinions but you notice what Philip says he says come and see he didn't stop and argue with him but he says come and see the Messiah sign was just revealed to a man called Peter he says you remember Peter he says the fishermen that didn't know how to sign his name that Messiah signed was just revealed to him whenever revealed to him his heart but he says come and see and what happened as Philip come up to Jesus Jesus turned around and he says behold an Israelite with no gal and he stops and he says when have you known me he says whenever you was under the tree whenever Philip called you I saw you he says right there that was the Messiah sign being revealed to the Jews but he says it was never revealed to the Gentiles because they was never looking for the Messiah come on now David says he said the Samaritans was looking for the Messiah he says the Jews was looking for the Messiah but he says the Gentiles was never looking for the Messiah but in this day the Gentiles are now looking for the Messiah and he says the same sign that he did to Philip the same sign that he did to the woman at the well he's now dead in this generation it wasn't there where was the William paying him but it was the word the discerner of the heart we we listen to the tapes there was time after time where he was able to discern the heart he would assume the life he would discern the address I heard one time I think it was brother Brown and I told him he says he gave he gave an address to a woman and there was a lady in the crowd that says my he just missed it she don't live there he just missed the wrong address and brother Branham says she came up to the woman afterwards and she said he just missed it you don't live at that address that's the wrong address and she stopped and she says oh I forgot to tell you we just moved yesterday it wasn't a man that was saying I guess this I guess that I think this I think that it was the word the Messiah Jesus Christ come on now we're no worshiping a man we're not following a man we're not following some sensation but is it is the word Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever proving that he's alive to somebody that is looking for him that has a desire but you see before you can find something there must be a foundation hope this is okay this evening there has to be a foundation for your faith but the Bantam says I said he hasn't got no grounds for Faith no touching of a tree having faith he said and having faith that's Superstition you've got you have to have grounds full of faith and he says faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God so the grounds of faith is the word of God not man's ideas not men's Traditions but is the word of God he says if you just take it like a newspaper report and something why you can't have faith in that he says they make errors because they're human but this Bible cannot make any errors it's got to be perfect because it's the word of God and God is no better than his word and you're no better than your word I'm no better than my word so therefore when the Bible says anything remember it is settled forever so the base of our faith is always the Bible we don't believe everything you read in the newspaper because there's human errors there's human false and brother Brandon says you can't read the Bible like a newspaper he says you can't read it like a newspaper how do you read a newspaper you throw this out because it might not be true you throw that out because it might not be true and you pick and choose what you want to keep but he says you can't do that with the Bible you can't read it like a newspaper it's got to be a revelation for the Bantam says you got to get down look up and say God Give Me Faith to believe your word you gotta have the right approach hope this is making sense this evening our faith is based on something that is unmovable remember heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail so our faith to see Christ is based on something solid so there once our faith is based on heavens and Norful pass away but my word will never fail then our desire starts to become a reality you look at Hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh the God must believe that he is that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so before you can never find Christ you have to have faith knowing that your desire is going to be met come on now your desire is going to be met by seeing Christ but before that can happen your faith has to be on the right basis Hey Brother Branham says that you have to have faith to start your car you have to have when you go into your car and turn your ignition he says that is Faith turning to turning the key and the starting your car and now you have to have faith whenever you're walking in your legs you're believing that your legs is going to catch you but faith in my ignition is not going to save me Faith in my legs is not going to give me a body change so my faith to see the supernatural has to be on the right thing if you follow me the the Buddhist and the muhammads they all have faith believing in something but the basis of their faith is not producing the supernatural but if the basis of your faith is on the word then it will produce the supernatural every time oh my look at Hebrews 11 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for so remember what does the word desire mean it is to look to hope for so now that desire is going from hoping to find something but now that there's a basis for your faith it's the substance of things hoped for what's that word hoped it's past tense you're no longer hoping to see Christ but now that your faith is done the right thing it's producing the evidence the realities of the desire is now being is now being manifested right in front of your eyes it's the evidence the reality of that desire is now right in front of your eyes we can see Jesus Christ but the barium says now before there was a palm tree to grow in the earth there had to be an Earth First there are there there be no palm tree to grow is that right if you believe in Divine Healing the power of God before there can be before there's gather something created that desire he says is that right before there can be a creation there has to be a Creator to create the creation is that right then you are when you are when the Holy Ghost created that desire on the inside this to see the power of God work in the city there's got to be a power of God somewhere he says it's the Deep calling to the Deep we're expecting to see it so we're not just hoping by man's man's desire but God has placed thou tug and thou pull on the inside to pull you to himself and brother Branham says and now many times you try through unbelief to explain that his days is gone but thou will not satisfy the scriptures that he said the same yesterday today and forever and then if your desire today is the same desire and that that these Greeks were sirs would we see Jesus and they were granted that privilege they got to see him then if we have the desire to see Jesus and if he's the same yesterday today and forever then why can't we be granted to see the desire he says if he's the same yesterday today and forever then why can't we see Christ I'll bring this down to a close here in a few minutes just bear with me a few more a few more minutes here I'm going to talk about Zacchaeus uh you know I can say have you heard the story you've read the story but this just started to strikeouts I mean you look at Luke 19 and 2 and behold there was a man's Zacchaeus which was the chief among Republicans and he was rich and he sought to see Jesus who he was so before he ever could find Jesus he had to look for him and the Bible says in the name and continuing on and he says then could not for the Press because he was little of stature and he says he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore trade to seek him for he was to pass that way so he knew that before he was ever in the tree that Christ was going to walk by this way he was going to walk by the path he was going to walk down the road and he wasn't going to let this opportunity pass him by so he shot him he didn't let the unbelief from the Stouts push him back but he was willing to press through the Press he was willing depressed and the Bible says when Jesus come to the place and looked up and saw him and said unto him Zacchaeus make haste come down for today I must abide at thy house I messed abide at thy house I didn't come by this way on accident but I come to abide in your house this a message didn't come by accident but it's come to abide in your house Christ ain't here by accident but he's come to abide in your house but you notice how how Christ Abode in his house the next verse and he made haste come down and received him joyfully so before Christ could abide in the house he had to receive him he had to act on the word that spoke to him and then whenever he acted upon the word the the Christ started to abide but you notice the Christ the physical body left the house so what's that he mean I'm going to abide abide means to take up permanent residence it means to live it's means to derail so when the body of Christ left the Revelation did it come on now you notice how the Bible says that he wanted to see Jesus for to know who he was he wanted to see Jesus the body but he wanted to know the God on the inside that's what was going to abide not the body the revelation we might not have the physical body of Jesus Christ right here on the Earth but the Revelation is abiding in every heart it's abiding in every home it's abiding in marriages it's abiding in families it's abiding in homes it's abiding but the painter says the Christ is here in every aspect but the Corporal body is the same power the same anointing I believe the same power that held the marriages together in the book of Acts and brother Branham state is the same power that can hold marriages together that can perform the same signs the same actions as Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever do you want to see him is there a desire on the inside to see him and not believe the Christ is here to dwelling in our midst if we can just see him if we can just see him the Bible says in Colossians 2 and 6 as she therefore receive Christ God receive Christ Jesus the Lord so walk he in him just like uh just like Zacchaeus received Christ it changed his walk you notice the Bible says that he looked to Christ and says I'm rich I'm going to give half of what I own to the poor and he says if there's anybody that I have dealt wrongfully with I'm going to pay it for I'm going to pay it four times as much whenever he received Christ he started to walk in the ways of Christ he had to throw his old actions aside here from his own ideas aside and says I'm walking in your footsteps and all my f Christ has been revealed to you we've got to receive him and walk ye in him the next verse Colossians 2 and 7 rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as you have been taught abounding for with with Thanksgiving Rudy then builds up in him walk in him we're now walking in the physical body of Christ but the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what we're walking in that's what we're dwelling in that's what's the world against our Tabernacles that's what's dwelling in a new life Outreach without the revelation of Jesus Christ new life now reaches another Lodge it's another building your home is another home but when the revelation of Jesus Christ starts to abide something takes place the mystery of God has been finished you look at Revelations 10 7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished the mystery of who Jesus was was finished when Zacchaeus received him and whenever you receive the voice of the Sabbath Angel The Mystery of God is finished as the bio as the musicians come the Revelation changed Peter's life it changed the woman out the well that Revelation changed the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul thought he was following the Messiah thought he was following God whenever he was killing Christians he thought he was doing God of service but there come a time on the road to Damascus that a pillar of fire appeared and knocked him off his horse and he looked up and he says Jesus or he says Lord who art thou and he says I am Jesus whom thou persecute us that Revelation struck in a change he was no longer persecuting the Christians but he was willing to give up his life that Revelation changed him the Revelation changed Nathanael the Revelation changed the Ethiopian the eunuch we know how the story goes with the eunuchy the Bible says he desired Philip to teach you and he come and he started reading the same scriptures that that the eunuch was reading Isaiah 53 he was reading start of the read those same scriptures and the Bible says that the Ethiopia looked and he asked Philip he says is this speaking of a prophet is it speaking of him or is it speaking of another and the Bible says Philip stopped and he says this is Jesus Christ this is Jesus and he stopped the Revelation Struck it changed the way he was reading scripture he was reading the same scriptures and as The Story Goes On the Bible says he went by a certain pool a certain water and says here's water what hinders me to be baptized the revelation of Christ started to put him into action it changed the way he thought it changed the way he acted and the Bible says Philip looked at him and he says if you can believe that Jesus is the Christ you can do it you can start acting upon it and the Bible says I believe that Jesus is the Christ and he says let's be baptized let's act upon that revelation but the Bantam says Christ that Christ expressed the word talked he says Christ expressed what the word talked amen there you are Christ was the expression of the word that was wrote Christ expressed it and he says now we find Jesus now has come to express the word now that's what he was yesterday that's what he is today that's what he will be forever God's word made known is that a better word think it no God's word expressed word maidenhead God's word express show that it is true and everything that God would do he did it everything that he wrote in the Bible of him doing he done it just exactly because he was the word expressed he says well if he's the same yesterday today and forever all of these promises hanging to this generation why wouldn't he be the same today to express everything that God's word promised he says see it has to be exactly the same because that's what he was then that's what he is now he will be forever God's word expressed and I believe God is here expressing his word to this generation sing on the same yesterday today and for that's about our heads tonight their Heavenly Father Lord we want to say thank you for this message that you've given us up you've given us a revelation Lord in the midst of Chaos in the midst of

false light the robbers put up a false light [Music] stopped the train and when they stopped the train the guys got in took the stuff was gone when they took their currency here's the thing and when you're listening to brother Josh preach the Bible says that the Beast of Revelations 13. which came out in brother Merle brought it to my attention the other day that I did not uh uh uh uh put credentials with with the Beast and the water the other day but the water according to Revelation 17 means people's multitudes so the Beast that came up out of the out of uh the the multitudes and you know that's the Roman Catholic church we understand that then their Beast came up out of the ground which was um no people and it was like unto a lamb the United States 13th chapter The Book of Revelations we had 13 colonies followed with 13 colonies 13 stars 13. 13 is America and America the Bible says would cause the whole world to wander after it had become a supernatural or a it would come a superpower and that the U.S would give power unto the Beast and would cause and would give power unto an image unto the Beast the image is a fake Jesus Christ it's not the real Jesus it's not the real word so the people are coming by a fake light they're going to church they're thinking they're coming to Christ and they don't have the slightest idea they're looking for they're they're claiming they've they've got a pumpkin and they're holding a watermelon they have taken Creeds calling that Christ they're taking putting their name on a book and calling that Christ who started it Rome the Beast the image they're bowing to that image and the people are following after it you don't have to be Catholic oh you don't have to be Catholic you could be Protestant but if you're bowing to the traditions of a man instead of the word [Music] sirs the word still here and the word is still being made flesh oh listen now brother Josh was talking uh the Jews and the Samaritans were looking for Christ because they had seen in the scripture that it's fixing to come and so when Christ come and done the Messiah sign the the prophetic sign they'd say ha he's here they had been looking for that scripture now here we are at the end of the Gentile age waiting for the Fulfillment waiting for prophecy waiting for the Rapture and God has come in this age not in any other age but this age with a messiah sign and that Prophet was more than just a a gift of Prophecy it was a messiah sign to to declare wait what happened what happened it was at the end of the Jewish dispensation and bringing it into the Gentile now at the end of the Gentiles dispensation it's going back to the Jews weave on and before God can reveal himself to the Jews you've got to be out of here and Satan is putting up the false light trying to get everyone amen but when we were going thinking that this and then God sends and shines his light on the word and says no no no no no no no no he'll never go outside his word he'll never go outside of a creek or go into a Creed he has to come here there's scripture that must be fulfilled here can you say Amen I like that I I I Hallelujah the biggest sham that week there the people are worshiping a Christ Jesus that they don't even know Jesus is the word it's the word whole Church of the Living God how blessed we are to have that word I read that story on Amen the biggest Heist and the false light and I thought Dear God that ain't what Satan has done if that ain't Revelations 13 and the whole world is is he's hijacked the whole church supposedly he's hijacked the whole church but there's an elections we ain't stopping we got the goods and we ain't stopping them Hallelujah I just loved it I appreciate that message tonight [Applause] and here

for the Rapture so don't get that mixed up there is a Corporal body and you will meet him but before he came he says he will reveal himself in that form of the son of man God made flesh again not God in the Redeemer on Earth again like Jesus but now it's God in a bride holy ghost in you coming into your completion of redemption you hearing me Christ in you the hope of glory oh and you know what I
