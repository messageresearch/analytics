amen Overcomers that's who we are Overcomers I love that song Amen thank you Jesus amen God bless y'all this even you musicians can have your seats sure it's good to be in the house of the Lord ain't it amen outside of Glory there's no place I'd rather be than here in the presence of Jesus Christ when I'm sick when I'm hurt when I've got a need this is where I want to be amen you know some people when they got an issue or they got situation going on you know they use it as a reason to stay home from church but when I've got a need there's no place I'd rather be than right here in the presence of Jesus Christ Christ amen if y'all would this evening we'll go right into the word p The Book of Psalms the 20th chapter we're going to begin in verse one amen it would say the Lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of Jacob defend thee send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of Zion remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice say law Grant thee according to thine own heart and fulfill all thy counsel we will rejoice in thy salvation and then in the name of our God we will set up our banners the Lord fulfill all of thy petitions now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed he will hear from him in the his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand now pausing here for just a moment here in this sixth verse now I know the Lord saveth his anointed if you look this word saveth up in the Hebrew concordance it would actually mean to be victorious or to give Victory unto so this verse would read now I know that the Lord gives Victory unto his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand some Tres in chariots and summon horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God they are brought down and they are Fallen but we are risen and stand upright save Lord or again give Victory Lord let the king hear us when we call amen and from there going to the book of Isaiah the 10th chapter and we're going to read uh in verse 24 it would say therefore thus sayith the Lord God of hosts on my people that dwell Us in Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian he shall smot thee with the rod and he shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of Egypt for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and my anger in their destruction and the Lord of host shall stir up a Scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of orb and as his Rod was upon the sea so shall he live Ed up after the manner of Egypt and it shall come into to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off of thy shoulder and his yoke from off of thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing amen I would like to take my text tonight out of this passage and for a title I would take a Victorious People through an anointed message a Victorious People through an anointed message let's bow our heads this evening dear father Lord we count such an honor and privilege to be able to stand before your people Lord Lord as we were saying there's no place we would rather be Lord than here in your presence father Lord just to feel your anointing and your presence and your spirit come down Among Us father Lord I know that Lord we are standing in front of a group of people Lord and that the people have needs father Lord they have hearts they have souls that need your help and Lord I ask during the service Lord that we would that you would just move me outside and you would come and you would move in a mighty way father you would meet every need you would touch every heart you would touch Every Soul father Lord you see every person here father Lord I ask that you would just come give them whatever they have need of give them whatever they're longing for whatever they're seeking for Lord I ask you just take this broken vessel father speak your word I ask that this message would just come forth with power and authority and Lord that your word would come forth we love you and we thank you we place this service into thy hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you all can take your seats amen so laying a foundation for this thought we see here this scripture that we'll reading in Isaiah you've you've got to understand the backstory what's going on here and just a short little recap of the story here that is taking place the army of Assyria is marching on the kingdom of Judah and they have just finished taking over and wiping out Israel and so now they're marching on Judah now Assyria is one of Israel and judah's most formidable enemies we're at war with uh with Assyria almost constantly throughout the Old Testament and if you begin to look you will see that at this period in time the country of Judah while they have stayed with the word they have stayed with what God has told them to do the Kingdom of Israel has completely left the word they have completely left God as a matter of fact ever since the kingdom would be divided after king after King Solomon and King Jobo would become the first king of Israel and King rabom will become the first king of Judah after this happened there was never again a Godly King over Israel but Israel will begin to decline farther and farther into sin as time went on and because of it God has now allowed the king of Assyria to move in and to completely take over Israel to clean out the country and to carry them away into captivity and this would actually it would be the last time that Israel is ever defeated because after this point in time Israel would never again come together but these lost 10 tribes that would be scattered throughout the world and they would never again return to their Homeland until World War II but we see now it's a very PCT ugly picture for the king of Judah because now that he has overtaken Israel the Bible says that the king of Assyria begins to get boastful the Bible says he begins to get lifted up within himself and he begins to say he begins to set his eyes upon Judah and he says I'm going to do into Judah What I've Done into Samaria I'm going to do into unto Jerusalem what I have done into Samaria and this this struck fear Into the Heart of the king of Judah that he is seen what's happened to Israel he has heard that the Assyrian army is on its way he has watched what's just happened to the neighboring country right next to him and this begin to strick fear into his heart and he was afraid so what did he do did he start Gathering his forces mustering his armies Gathering his generals no the prophet of God or the Bible says that he consulted the prophet he went to their Prophet that was his immediate response when the enemy was at his Gates was that he would go to the prophet he went to Isaiah and he asked what we should do and so now this scripture in Isaiah the 10th chapter this is Isaiah's response to the king of judah's plea now I want you to not is his response he would say he would tell God's people don't be afraid of this King don't be afraid of this enemy this yoke of bondage shall be broken from off of thy shoulders because of the anointing because of the anointing not because you have followed me not because you are better people than Israel is not because you have kept my Commandments but because I have chosen you to be my anointed that anointing will be the reason that the Yoke of your bondage will be destroyed I will bring you freedom I will bring you Deliverance I will bring you Victory because you are my anointed I mean I thought that was so powerful to think about tonight that God would save and give power and Authority unto a group of people for no other reason than that they were his anointed people for no other reason that they were a nation that was chosen by God to be placed under this anointing amen I would like to begin tonight by saying I believe this bride is Anointed I believe I'm standing this evening not just before the Bride of Jesus Christ but before the anointed bride of Jesus Christ I don't believe there will be any dispute in that tonight I believe that I'm standing before a group that we don't just sympathize with this anointing it's not just something that sounds good oh but this anointing I believe is I'm part of a group that's just as anointed as Jesus was when he walked the earth I believe we're just as anointed as a prophet of God was when he brought the message of the hour I don't believe we have a lesser anointing or a smaller anointing I don't believe we are a lesser people but the same anointing that flowed through Christ is flowing through this bride the same anointing that flowed through the angel messenger is Flowing inside of every body that's coming to the headship of that angel messenger if there's one thing I want to make clear to that devil tonight is that I know that I'm anointed I know who I am I know where I'm going I know where I came from I know that I am anointed Amen brother Brandon would say the Messiah means ano anointed and if he was the Messiah because he was anointed with the fullness of God then we are anointed too with the same Spirit now you say how do you know you're Anointed with the same Spirit he said the same life the same things he did he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also what did he say in St John 5:19 verily I say unto you the son can do nothing what he sees the father doing and that doeth the son likewise any correct Messi would have the same message so if God does any one thing any child of God is going to do the same thing you believe that ton not if the Messiah does any one thing any Messiah is going to do the same thing so if God was anointed his children are anointed if Christ was anointed his bride is Anointed there's no question about it there's no wondering there is no confusion and I just want to tell somebody here tonight I don't know what you're going through I don't know the situations I might not know what you're dealing with I might not know what you're battling with but it doesn't matter if I know because I can stand here and I can tell you in confidence that you were anointed by God to see Victory you weren't anointed to be defeated you weren't anointed to watch the enemy Prevail in your life you weren't anointed to stand oh and to watch as the enemy comes and tramples over you but you were anointed to overcome you were anointed to Prevail you were anointed to conquer and Destroy every yoke of bondage that the enemy would try to place upon you you were anointed to see Victory I love how the prophet would say we are anointed too with the same Spirit not a similar Spirit not a locking Spirit but the Same Spirit oh in other words the spirit that quickened him has now been quickened inside of you the same spirit that Rose Christ from the dead is the same Christ is the same spirit that is Raising this bride from the dead Hallelujah he will go on he would say the Holy Spirit Body of Christ will move just as Christ moves and if Christ in heaven can never get his spiritual body on Earth moving as he wants it to move watch for things to happen watch for things to happen he would say it's beginning to come to life it's beginning to come to life they paralyzed it long enough but the holy spirit is bringing life into it oh my I'm going to read that again it's beginning to come to life theyve paralyzed it long enough but the holy spirit is bringing life into it and it's beginning to wake wake up and it's beginning to move because it sees its position oh Hallelujah church this anointing is bringing life into the body oh we are not paralyzed we are not stagnant we are not a dead corpse but this mod body is moving under the authority and the power of the anointing of Jesus Christ because we have seen our position and we are anointed to step into that position as a member of the bde body oh Hallelujah if Christ was anointed with 10 Satan I say I'm Anointed with sin Satan if Christ was anointed to raise from the dead I'm anointed to raise from the dead if Christ was anointed to overcome and to see total victory in every area of his life I am anointed by God to do the exact same thing because I the manifestation of Jesus Christ and so because of that I will manifest the same anointing I will manifest the same power the same Authority y'all I'm having nose believe y'all excuse me I will manifest that same power that word comes to life inside of this body brother Brandon would say as Jehovah Eagle is the Great Eagle we're the eaglets he's the Messiah and he with the same anointing we are the Messiahs amen anoint the Messiah means the anointed are you anointed amen what with the same spirit that he was anointed with amen Isaiah 61 verse1 a very familiar scripture it would say the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the Good Tidings to the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted thank you Heath sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance and to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn and z and to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the Trees of Righteousness the planing of the Lord that he might be glorified now I want you to remember here this chapter is speaking of Jesus Christ there's a prophecy of the role of Jesus Christ and the anointing that he will be placed under I thought it was so powerful that before the prophet of God would ever come along and he would show us that that he would show us that we are under the same anointing as Christ was God would actually give us a list of every everything that Jesus Christ was anointed to do he was anointed to preach the word he was anointed to bind the Brokenhearted he was anointed to Proclaim Liberty to open the prisons to give Beauty for Ashes Jesus Christ was anointed to do all these things through his Natural Body and now the prophet will come on the scene he will show us that everything the natural body that the natural always tpes of spiritual so if the natural body was anointed to do something the spiritual body will be anointed to do the same thing amen she was anointed to preach the word she is Anointed to bind the Brokenhearted she's anointed to Proclaim Liberty to open the prisons to get Beauty for R the church you are doing and denight everything Jesus did you were anointed to do everything brother Benham did you have been anointed to do there is no line there is no limit there is no you can go this far and you can't go any farther there is no there is no end to the power of that anointing but the same anointing that Jesus Christ was under is the same anointing that you've been placed under oh I say to our church this anointing is not going to take us part of the way it won't take you halfway it won't take you 3/4 of the way it's not going to take you 99% of the way but this message this anointing will take you all the way it will take you every step of the way it will take you every part of the way oh you can go so far under a denominational Spirit you can go so far under some menm be oh when this Bride Comes under the anointing of this message I say this message this anointing will carry you all the way excuse me it'll take you every step of the way it'll take you every part of the way oh Hallelujah it'll carry us through a Rapture it'll carry us through a body change it'll carry us through church problems it'll carry us through storms it'll carry us through trials it'll carry us through Seasons oh when the sermon why are people so tossed about the prophet he would go through the scripture and he will show he would talk about Isaiah 61 and he would show how that that this anointing would be placed upon Jesus and he would say now that is what's here it's not something we were looking for out in the future I love that now that is what's here it's not something that was was lost out in history it's not something that we've seen just how in times past but that is what's here he said that anointing that power is what is here oh I say Church there's an anointing here tonight there's an anointing in this building tonight there's ano the anointing favors the Bride of Jesus Christ the anointing favors you as members of God himself the Pentecostals have a portion the denominations have a portion brother Bram would actually say that man would be given a lesser portion oh but the body of Christ would have so much anointing that she will become the fullness of the godhead deity I said we have not been given a lesser portion of the anointing I'm not standing before a group of people church that you just have part of the anointing you just have a your just anointed to do any one thing oh but I say the full anointing of Jesus Christ has been placed upon you until we have become the fullness of God expressed we have been filled with the full anointing of God to take this message to take this word oh to stand on this word to stand on every line oh to apply every word to live in Victory to live an overcoming life oh I don't know about you church but I refuse oh to be I refuse to be satisfied with manifesting a portion of this message I refuse to be satisfied with just manifesting a part of this word oh when I say give me every word I say give me every line if the message said it I believe it I might not fully understand it I might not fully get it oh but give me the easy Parts give me the hard Parts give me the encouraging Parts give me the worth Parts if the word said it I say I'm going to believe it and I'm going to stand on it amen y'all just bear with me tonight we're going to get through this oh that devil don't want it but we're going to get through this anyway amen the prophet of God would say in the cross's mystery God revealed he would say there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church having the pinen is in this church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh I like that Caleb what kind of people are y'all over there we're anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by why accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see Anointed with the word so we aren't just anointed we have been Anointed with the very word of God so we see brother bernham he would tell the church here that there would come a time when God would have a desire to express himself in fullness God would have a desire to express himself in fullness not in part not express just a portion of himself oh but there was going to come an age when God would want to make an Express of who he was of what he was of the power that he had of what he could do and the way that he was he was going to express himself was going to be through a group of people who were Anointed with the word an anointed people not just any group not just any people not just any church but that word was going to be expressed through God's anointed people now that word anoint it will mean to consecrate to identify as sacred to set apart for a specific purpose oh so to think tonight this group of people this anointed bride body was of people who were set apart for a specific purpose she will be consequ set aside amen I believe that I don't believe that God set me apart from before the foundation of the world just for any other reason I don't believe that God predestinated this body and plac it as a member of the body of Jesus Christ just for any old reason oh but if God anoints an individual is because he has a purpose for that individual oh I'm might be here just tell one person here tonight God has a purpose for your life I know sometimes maybe just sitting in the PE backing the preacher it feels like you ain't got a purpose I know sometimes you're sitting there and maybe singing along with a song reader maybe it feels like you ain't got a purpose it feels like that there's no reason for you to be here oh when I say if you are a member of the Bride body of Jesus Christ I say God the very word anoint means that God has given you a purpose and you have a role to fulfill even it's the tiniest role even if it's the smallest part brother bham said every part of the body must be there in order for that body to take a Rapture every single member every single part of the body must be there oh church you've got a purpose T now young people you've got a purpose for coming here you might feel useless sometimes you might feel helpless sometimes oh but there is a purpose for you coming here there's a there a purpose for you to come and to fill up these pews there's a purpose for you to come oh because there was a bride body oh and we are members of a body church we are members that must come together under that anointing in order for it to work there must be a group of people that come together brother bham would preach Unity over and over and over again why because he knew that half the bride could not do it he knew three quarters of the Bride couldn't do it but he knew that every single member of the body must come together must come together oh we might have differences we might have differences of opinion we might have differences in Doctrine oh but I say Throw aside the indifferences throw aside the problems you have with your brother and let's stand under the anointing of Jesus Christ let's stand oh under the word of God I say the anointing is here for the Bride of Jesus Christ to manifest amen excuse we know that brother brandham he would he would tell us if you begin to studying the Bible you will see that there were three groups of people that were anointed in the Old Testament there were the prophets the priests and the Kings and brother Brandon will go through and he will show how that each of these roles had the very special purpose that they were elected to perform and as God's people it was only under that anointing that they could rightly perform those duties the way that God had intimidated them for the way what they were designated for and we know that Jesus Christ he would come in a natural body and he fulfilled all three of those roles that the anointing was designated for he was anointed as a prophet as a son of man he was anointed as a priest after the order of melkisedek he was anointed as a king as the king of Heaven as the king of all Kings Jesus Christ came and he was a complete fulfillment of the word and now the Propet will come along he will show us that the anything that the body that the the head does the body would be subject to the same thing so if the body raised from the dead brother Bram said if the head raised from the dead brother Braham said the body must raise from the dead if those head is under an anointing the body must be under the same anointing so if God predestinated you if he elected you if he if he anointed you and placed you in the body of Christ is because he has a purpose for your life okay what is that purpose I'll just go back to what the prophet of God said he said that purpose is so that you God the word could be fully meant ested through you so that he can be manifested through you oh Church you are the manifestation of Jesus Christ tonight that is what you are you are the manifestation of the very of the very word that was in the mind of God from before the foundation of the world how was God alive today I'll tell you how God is alive today you are how God is alive today how is God moving today you are how God's moving today how does God do this how does God do that I tell you how he does it he's going to have an anointed individual he can have an anointed Church an anointed body an anointed group of people who will stand and will say I'm here Lord tell them what you need me to do tell me what purpose you have for my life tell me where you want me to go send me Lord I'll go oh Hallelujah we are living in the most victim mentality world ever oh people in the church have such a victim mentality where the walk in the S on the PE what can God do for me what can God do for me what can the preacher do to me what what can the pastor do for me I say Lord what can I do for you we need some people who will stand under the anointing and say Lord I know you elected me as a member of this body and so you have a purpose for my life you have a role that you want me to fulfill I say young people God has a role for you to fulfill because he placed you under an anointing and that anointing has given you a purpose that anointing has given you oh a reason to push forward it's given you a reason to fight oh I say this word is Anointed this message is Anointed oh this isn't just any word this isn't just any message we follow oh but I follow the most anointed word that has ever come forth to any group of people on the face of the Earth and we are anointed to believe it we anointed to manifest it oh Hallelujah church this body ain't going through an identity crisis we ain't worried about who we are we ain't confused about who we are we ain't puzzled about who we are but we know who we are because the word told us who we are he said you are an anointed predestinated oh holy ghost fied elected member of the body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we are anointed for victory we're anointed to overcome we're anointed to stand on this word we are anointed to break the Yoke of bondage to stand under the headship of the message and to manifest his word with everything that we've got oh listen to what the prophet said there would be a Time come forth oh when he would Express himself in this fullness of his godhead deity on down he would say oh my to bring back the anointed bride oh not to make the anointed bride he said to bring back the anointed bride now the last time I checked the word that word to bring back means to restore that which already existed oh so to think tonight that you were anointed in the mind of God oh before the foundation of the world there was all already a group of people who was anointed in the mind of God before there was a world before there was man before there was anything oh there was a group of people who were anointed in the mind of God to express this word oh I say why don't you just tell that devil that's been battling you tonight tell that enemy that's been fighting with you say devil before you were even created I was already anointed to defeat you I was already anointed to cut your head off I was already anointed to stand on this word oh and to run the sword of the spirit through your heart oh I say there is an anointing in this building tonight whatever you have need of oh the anointing is here to fight for you the anointing is here oh to take this word oh and they're running through the heart of the enemy oh whatever Mountain you're through going through whatever Valley you're going through whatever storm whatever trial I see there is an anointing here that will carry you through it all it will carry you every step of the way oh you were already anointed in the mind of God from before the foundation of the world oh when God predestinated you he predestinated the outcome of every battle you would ever go through every Tri you would ever face every storm you would ever go through because the moment that you are anointed for victory every enemy that you ever face was anointed to be defeated I say I can stand tonight in the same confidence that I was anointed to win I can stand in that same confidence that my enemy was anointed to lose oh Hallelujah come on devil you can hit me you can strike me you might push me down you might knock me down oh but I say I'm coming back because I was anointed to win I was anointed for victory I was anointed to overcome oh he might hit you he might stri you he might shove you around he might knock you down oh brother Bram said the difference between excuse me between a Believer and an unbeliever is when the unbeliever Falls he stays down when the unbeliever goes down he stays down oh but when a Believer falls to the ground a Believer stands back up he says I know I am anointed I know I've got the Holy Ghost I know I've Got The Power of God I know who I am I know where I'm going I know that I can overcome because there is an anointing place inside of my life that I know I can see Victory oh hallelujah hallelujah brother Brandon would say that Jesus was the most anointing man to ever walk the face of the Earth so to think tonight the same amount of anointing that was placed on Jesus has now been placed inside of you yo I don't know what y'all seeing so y'all forgive me if it's a freak show up here oh he would say that Jesus was the most anointed man that ever walked the face of the Earth so to think that same amount of anointing has been placed inside of you CH there is no shortage of the anointing there is no we are not wanting for the anointing but we are living in an overflow of the anointing of God we are living in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit we're living in an age where every devil has been Unleashed every sickness has been Unleashed every complex has been Unleashed every Power of hell has been Unleashed oh but fear not little bride every bit of word has been Unleashed every bit of power every bit of authority every bit of anointing has been Unleashed to the body of Jesus Christ I say there is enough anointing whatever you're going through there is enough anointing there is enough power there is enough Authority in this message to take you through whatever battle you're going through there is enough oil oh Hallelujah right now is not the time to live under your privileges now is not the time to live under the promises of God oh but it's the time to stand under the power of this word stand under the anointing and step into your position as a member of this bride body and say I will overcome because I'm anointed I will receive Victory because I am anointed I will defeat this devil because I am anointed I will live through this trial I will go through this storm why because I am anointed oh Hallelujah Joel 2:23 it say be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he ha given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the vat shall overflow with wine and oil so there will be an overflow of wine and an overflow of oil now the prophet he would expand on this oil and wine in the third seal and he would say that the oil represented uh the anointing of the Holy Spirit and that the wine represent the stimulation Revelation he would say the oil and the wine in the Bible is associated together always I got the concordance and I look there's a string of them like that where the wine and the oil goes together all the time see when the truth of a pro promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with the oil or filled with the anointing they all get stimulated oh wine is a stimulation Glory I feel it right now stimulated with joy and Shout see and when it does it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man oh because when the Revelation has been given of a truth and the True Believer is filled with the oil or filled with the anointing the Revelation is revealed and the stimulation becomes so great it makes him behave himself unnormal oh my C why do y'all behave unnormal over there because when the Revelation is revealed do an anointed body do an anointed body I say there will be some stimulation that comes forth there will be some stimulation oh that comes forth from the body of Jesus Christ I say church when the Revelation when the spark of Revelation is the oil anointing placed inside of your heart there's going to be some stimulation there's going to be some excitement oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say you might not jump in sh you might not oh some people are going to do that oh but there is going to be a stimulation either way there will always be an excitement there will always be just a just a bubbling forth of the word oh when that Revelation hits the anointing when the wine comes together with the oil oh I say there will be a stimulation hallelujah oh when I hear this word I get stimulated oh when I hear this message it stimulates me oh what do we do when we heard the revelation of the Seven Seals we got stimulated what do we do when this bride heard the revelation of adoption we got stimulated what do we do when we heard the seven Church changes I say we got stimulated why because a spark of Revelation came in contact with the anointing that was placed in the bride body of Jesus Christ and there was a stimulation that had to come forth oh Hallelujah I know what it means but when I was going through this I looked up the definition of the word stimulate oh and man reading the definition got me stimulated all right y'all got a second it means to revive to rekind to enliven to Quicken to light up to ramp up to fire up to juice up to vitalize to invigorate to jumpstart to power up to jol into ignition to energize into action okay what happens when anointing meets Revelation I'll tell you what happens we get stimulated we get invigorated we get vitalized we get Juiced up we get amped up we get powered up we get Jed into aition we get energized into action I say Church there is an anointing that's come in contact with the revelation of this word and we are a stimulated group of people oh when the definition was to rekindle oh maybe your Fire's a little low tonight maybe there's a fire that's a little low in your heart I'll tell you a place where there's some good old fashion Holy Ghost gasoline or that fire can get to burning again that flame can get to burning again oh Hallelujah we are a stimulated people oh it ain't a working up it ain't to build up it ain't just a motion oh Caleb you're acting like a Pentecostal no the Pentecostals act like me oh how can you say that I'll show you by the word I can say that oh they were started dancing for joy they started Shine for Joy at Zeus Street 1906 I was shouting for Joy before the foundation of the world in the presence of my king I say I was dancing before they were dancing I was shouting before they were shouting oh I was rejoicing long before they were rejoicing oh don't tell me I've got a denominational devil because I'm doing what I was created to do I say I'm GNA praise I'm going to Rejoice I'm going to praise my king because the anointing has come in contact with the revelation of this message oh and the word came forth and it struck thy seed and I can't help but get stimulated oh hallelujah oh watch it brother Caleb you're saying that you got to dance when the anointing comes no that's not what I'm saying that's not brother Brandon would purposely make sure that we did not think that he purposely made sure he was very careful and why people so tossed about he would say that so many times he said people misconstrue the anointing uh for emotion he would say people misunderstand and they misconstrue anointing to be emotion he said that that's what people will mistake it for but he would say the anointing is not emotion the anointing is supreme power in control oh but the cable what does that mean and the and the uncertain sound the priv will go through the supreme power and he would say that the way that the believer is filled with the supreme power is by faith in the perfect word of God he said when a Believer is filled has faith in the perfect word he said they are instilled oh with that supreme power oh and so God would not give a supreme power unto a group of people without giving them a way to control it just like we were talking about this morning brother Brandon would say the Pentecostals cannot have this power because he said they will be emptying out the hospitals all over the world they cannot control this power the world cannot control this power oh but it was not given for any people it was not given for a denomination it was not given for them oh but this word has been given to you this power has been given to you and it's been given to you through an anointing that could that could control that power that's why when brother Bron would have a prayer line if you listen to them on tapes you hear it all the time brother Bron He he'll say I'm waiting on the anointing I'm waiting on the anointing to come because the prophet of God knew that whenever that that anointing was the way that God would channel the power inside of the believer oh this power is not for the World Church oh this power was for the anointed bride this power has been for you in the day that you're living in oh do I get excited sometimes yeah I do I'll get a little joy in my victory oh but that anointing comes and that anointing is supreme power in control inside of the life of a Believer oh I say Church you need this anointing you've got to have this anointing because in order for that word to come forth in order for it to be manifested through you it can only be good it it can only happen through that channel of the anointing oh brother Brandon would say that the message he would say the anointing didn't bring dancing and shouting that stuff's all right I'm all for that and I went want you to know I mean you guys you guys see me I know a lot of you people know me I'm the biggest advocate for that in the world I love that I get excited more than just about anybody oh but the anointing is supreme power in control that's what the anointing is it's not a workup it's not a buildup it's not fing Goose The anointing is the channel through which the power of God is controlled in the body of Christ amen this bride church is in control oh this anointing church is what CS this bride in control I see this bride ain't blowing this way in the wind blowing that way in wind we ain't falling away after this we ain't running after this or running after that oh but I'm standing on a firm foundation I'm standing Church on an anointing that keeps me still it keeps me firm it keeps me solid in this message oh I say that anointing it places you in your position under the headship with the message of the hour and the anointing brings control of the power of God oh you say brother Caleb you don't understand we are on fire last week we were on fire but the church is going through a season right now yeah I understand church is going to go through seasons brother Braham said churches go through seasons and some people I feel like don't understand that churches go through Seasons oh and you know say well there's just some indifference in the church there's some family issues in the church going on right now I guess we've just lost that fire I guess the fire just ain't here no more he said but the C that's silly but that's the way that people think so many times is that because you're going through a season because a Believer is going through something means that the anointing ain't there and that's just not true brother brandham would go through Seasons he would say his church went through Seasons oh but I want you to read what the prophet says about this he said there's something within us a fire that is burning a life that has been lit by God and no breezes can blow it out there's no cold spells in the church there's no indifference amongst the people there's no persecution in the world that can blow out a flame that God has lit for as God's purpose is torch light of Freedom will burn until the coming of the Lord and no power can blow it out they will only make it burn brighter as they blow oh Hallelujah they tried to blow us out Church they tried to put us out in differences tried to put us out oh bitterness has tried to put us out complexes have tried to put us out Church problems family problems have tried to put us out oh but I say we only makes us burn brighter as they blow because this anointing can be put out by the world it can't be put out by Leia it can't be put up on any devil or with this fire that was lit by God I say there is a fire lit in the Church of the Living God did not oh no devil no problem no situation no complex can take out of fire that God has lit it only makes it burn brighter oh hallelujah amen I looked up what happens when oil and wine comes together and you know how uh Google started this new thing when if you look something up it'll generate an AI response you know for you and so I looked this up and I thought was amazing because when I looked this up oh it brought up a thing the theyi generated response and it came up popped up real big is it exercise Extreme Caution oh when you put oil and wine together because when oil and alcohol join together the mixture created is so flammable and combustible it forms a potential explosive oh Hallelujah devil you better exercise Extreme Caution when laying hands on their body of Jesus Christ cuz I'm here to tell you this morning this evening I say you are messing with some potential explosives I say there's some chemistry in the house of God tonight oh he's pushed my buttons and he's pushed my buttons oh what ton not devil you push the wrong button and I see there's an explosion in the house of God there's an explosion in the Church of the Living God oh we're blowing you the Smither RS devil I say there is an explosion happening oh Hallelujah when the old comes together with the wine it creates an explosive oh Hallelujah come on Church you were anointed for Rapture you were anointed for victory you were anointed to overcome you were anointed to explode you were anointed to Bubble forth with the power of God hallelujah amen you are anointed when I look across this church when I look across the bride oh I see some people with some testimonies I see some people when I look across this message I see more testimonies than any other group of people why because there is an anointing in this message oh that works through this word there's an anointing here that brings the power of God oh Hallelujah I see some testimonies oh New Life Outreach oh indifference is tried to take you out Satan is try to take this church out he's tried to destroy this church he's tried to destroy its members he's tried to destroy the Believers they gather here in Pony Oklahoma oh but I declare to the devil tonight I say you can't take out a fire but God is lit in the house of God I say look again devil New Life Outreach is still standing this church is still here this church is still standing this church is still on fire for God oh Hallelujah when the anointing comes the anointing speaks oh that Devil's trying to take out my wife he tried to kill my wife I say look again devil she was anointed to win she was anointed for victory she was anointed to overcome oh Church there been cancer I tried to take some of you out oh problems has try to take some of you out I say look again devil we were anointing to win we were anointed for victory we were anointed to come through the end of the storm oh and to praise God and say Lord you carried me through it oh the anointing carried me the anointing held me the anointing fought for me oh oh church I say you can rest in the anointing oh this anointing is here to carry you oh hallelujah oh that sness was anointed by Satan to defeat you that complex you're dealing with tonight oh that depression that pornography that was anointed by Satan to defeat you oh but I say you bride this bride was anointed by God you say there ain't no problem there ain't no pornography there ain't no depression there ain't no issue there ain't no family indifference there ain't no bitterness there ain't no grudge there ain't no problem Satan can place upon this bride oh that can stop an individual that's been Anointed with the word of God or with the spirit of God hallelujah you look at Israel today the prophet of God said to watch Israel he said it's he said it's the bride's time piece and I was looking the other day anybody if you watch the news you look around you see oh that Israel has been in war constantly over the past few years every enemy that tries to rise up enemy after enemy after enemy has tried to rise up and has tried to overtake that nation and every single time Israel's washes him like a bug every single time Israel just completely annihilates him why there's an anointing that has been placed upon that Nation Oh Hamas can't replace generals fast enough before Israel takes them out by the time they put a new leader in oh Israel has already blown them up Israel's already destroyed them oh I say Satan can't replace generals fast enough he can't replace Devils fast enough oh before the bride takes them out I say Church there ain't no enemy that can stand before an anointed group of people there ain't no devil there ain't no problem that can stand before you oh Hallelujah I saw a thing the other day where Israel they posted a picture and this picture showed the 11 leaders of Hamas and in this picture they had five of their heads circled in red and the footnote at the bottom said so far this is how many we've killed oh so far this is how many we've killed a few months later they put up another picture with every single head circled in red and said we've got the last of them oh I say whenever they put posted that picture oh with the oh with their five heads stroken in red oh I say there were putting a notice out for the other saying hey you better go home and get your life insurance ready cuz come morning time we're going to make one dead devil closer to Victory oh I say why don't you put that devil on notice tonight we've killed the devil to the left of you we've killed the devil to the right of you oh but come morning time we are going to be one dead devil closer to Total Victory oh I say Church oh don't give that devil no Grace oh you fight that Devil with everything you've got oh the anointing is here the anointing is a weapon oh the cut the head off of that devil Hallelujah just as Israel the nation is Anointed to overcome brother bam said this bride follows Israel I say you were anointed to overcome you were anointed to win you were anointed to fight through hardships oh Israel you look on the nap every single country around them is at war with them oh I see you look around this bride every single enemy around us oh we are surrounded by enemies we are surrounded by problems we're surrounded by issues we are surrounded by complexes we're surrounded by demons they're trying to destroy this bride oh but I say we are going to overcome because that was an anointing that's been placed upon this bride hallelujah amen the prophet of God would say time and time again he would talk about David a lot and while Christ speak he would go through the anointing he would talk about David in several different places David knew he was anointed and was Vindicated to be a good shot he knowed he was a good shot David was anointed and he knowed it another place David know the anointing Lord was on him it didn't make him any difference he said the Philistines will be like the bear and the lion so here I come one more place he knowed where he was standing he was a man of Faith he believed God God was in him he knew that he was anointed oh Church there was power in knowing that you were anointed David didn't overcome because he was strong because he was strong he didn't overcome because he was a good shot he didn't overcome because he was educated he didn't overcome because he was just because of something he had learned oh but David overcame because he knew that he was anointed amen if he get ever get to that place night where you know that you were anointed brother B said if you get a revelation of who you are and what you can do you will be an invincible Army oh you'll be unstoppable undefeated unconquerable because you know that you're anointed amen saying that though to go to this area of thought David knew he was anointed brother Brandon would say or God himself would say David's a man after my own heart God would say that David was anointed to betray Christ and so now we want to skip ahead 300 years we're going to skip ahead five generations after this time and if you look over in 2 Kings 19 we ain't going to read it we ain't got time to go through it all but if you begin to read through the story here we are 300 years after David David's been dead 300 years we're five generations later and now Assyria has come up against Judah and King Jehoshaphat he was a Godly King and he consulted the man of God and he asked what we should do and in in 2 Kings 19 the prophet would say thus sayith the Lord fear not I will give you victory for my servant David's sake and the Bible said that night that the spirit of the Lord went out and killed 185,000 Assyrians in one night oh you know brother malol I got a thinking about that oh the anointing that been placed upon David had so much power after 300 years that it could kill 185,000 Devils all in one night oh I begin to think of a 300y old anointing placed upon great great great grandpa had so much power that it could kill 185,000 Devils I say what about a fussing oting that's been placed upon the body of Jesus Christ oh I ain't using Grandpa's anointing I ain't using Daddy's anointing I ain't using some pastor's anointing or what I'm standing with the anointing of Jesus Christ oh and if a 300 year old anointing oh would able to kill 185,000 I'll say there is no limit or to what the anointing fresh anointing of the word poured out upon this Bride Can Do there's no limit to what it can accomplish There's No Limit Oh to the power that it has oh Hallelujah yeah oh is that enemy begin to come up Oh I thought it was amazing oh I imagine the Bible says that night the enemy went out oh I'm Not Just Be Imagined here but I like to imagine King Jehoshaphat slept really good that night oh I imagine that oh I imagine that he's been having some sleepless nights lately oh he knows Assyria is on its way he can't sleep Assyria is here he can't sleep Assyria is gathering ready to break through the walls he can't sleep oh but that now that King oh went to sleep to the sound of his enemy crying for for help oh that night jeos out went to sleep and he heard the pleas of his enemy as he heard the anointing slaughtering the enemy that had come up against him oh I want to put that devil on notice tonight morning is coming oh you might think you got power now you might think you've got Authority now you might think that you've got it you're over us now oh but I say the anointing is favors the Bride of Jesus Christ and mour is coming watch out devil morning is coming watch out complex morning is coming oh and when morning comes oh King Jehoshaphat said Israel do the spoil outside your Gates lay an entire Army of the enemy that stood against you oh I say tonight the anointing will fight for you the anointing will kill for you the anointing will stop every enemy that comes against you oh hallelujah oh that Prophet told Jehoshaphat he said stand still oh just praise he told him he said Just Praise he said Gather the musicians he said gather all the priests he said and y'all just praise and watch as the anointing Slaughters your enemy watch as the anointing Slaughters every devil that's come against you watch as the anointing fights for you oh hallelujah amen going back to the scripture we begin with Isaiah 10:24 it would say therefore thus sayith the Lord God of host oh my people that dwelleth in Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian he shall SMY with the rod and shall lift up a staff against thee after the manner of Egypt for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and my anger and their destruction and the Lord of Lord of host shall stir up a scourage for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of orb now the slaughter of Midian at the rock of orb is referring to Gideon and the time in the Bible whenever three soldiers killed 135,000 midianites 300 soldiers 300 men completely destroyed the armies of Midian and so what what we see is that during this battle as they killed all these men and and so now once this happened the general of this Army the general of the army of the minites runs and he hides in the rock of Orab oh but I declare to you tonight when the day when God becomes your enemy there ain't no rock that can hold you there ain't no Fortress that can hold you there ain't no place you can go to hide when the anointing is out to kill you oh because whenever that whenever they those people had touched God's anointed oh that man he went and he hid in that rock oh but that anointing went out and but and this Bible is saying oh that the anointing went out and he slew that man at the rock of orb not only did the anointing slay your enemy oh but that man's name was Orab oh and so not only did he kill your enemy oh but God made oh and God made a declaration God wanted to make a monument oh what happened when an enemy messes with an anointed people I say tonight God made an example of your devil he hit him up he he he killed him in that rock oh and now that rock was named the rock of Ora oh to show us a monument hey this is what happens when an enemy comes against God's anointed this is what happen happens oh when the anoint when someone comes against the anointing oh of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that anointing went out and killed them and now we see years and years later Israel or Isaiah is talking to the king of Judah and he's telling him look back to the rock of orb oh he's saying look back to the Rock oh not only did the devil kill oh the enemy that stood against God's people but he said I'm going to make a memorial of what happens when the anointing goes to battle and now all these years later Israel Isaiah standing there and he says okay fear not fear not this enem is against you fear not this that this enemy has come to your Gates oh look back to the rock of or oh I say tonight is a time of remembrance I say that we look back to the rock of or oh look back to what to the rock of pornography look back to the rock of complexes look back to the rock of bitterness look back to the rock of your past look back to what happened whenever an enemy tried to take you oh what the anointing said no look back to what happened oh when the enemy tried to kill you but the anointing said No I say God made an example of your devil tonight God made a God made a memorial of your enemy oh and I love this I was doing some research on the rock of orb and I thought it was so amazing one biblical historian wrote orb fell at a rock which became known afterwards as the rock of orb and this incident not only mocked a a Victorious turning point for the Israelites oh but it also devastatingly impacted the medanite influence in that region oh to the point where this is the last time in history where Midian was ever a threat to the nation of Israel oh I love that it said it not only was a turning point in Victory for Israel but it said it was the last time it marked the last time the minion was ever a threat to the nation of Israel oh you know what that means that means when Midian would try to creep in when the enemy would try to come back in again oh Israel would say before you do that why don't you go look to the rock of orb why don't you go look back do what happened the last time you said the anointing wasn't enough go back and look at what happened last time you tried to slay God's anointed oh church I say the anointing is here to fight for you the anointing is here to make a memorial of the devil that's come against you oh Hallelujah as they come to the music if they will come tonight oh I say tonight Church fear not that the enemy has come against you there's an anointing in this word there's an anointing in this message oh you ain't got to go look for it it's started here you ain't got to go find it you were born with it you were born with this anointing you were born for this message you were predestinated to take a hold of this word oh Hallelujah the prophet of God would talk about that duck that was born in the chicken yard and he would say that that farmer laid that duck or laid that egg into that chicken and that duck was born into this chicken yard oh but just because you're born into something doesn't mean that you were born for it oh Hallelujah because the thing about chickens that bar would say is he said chicken pins are dry oh but that duck was made for that water and brother B said one day that duck was walking around that chicken yard and he said all it took was one whiff of that water he said there was a pond that had been there the entire time at the bottom of the hill Oh and the prophet of God said all it took was one whiff of that water and he said that duck shot over the fence and he shot down to that water oh Church you were made for that water that duck realized that he was made for that water he was not made for the chicken yard he was not made for the chicken pin oh but he was made for that water and the second that he had an experience and came in contact with that water he shot down to that water oh I say tonight Church you were made for this water you were made to swim in this fond you were made to swim and to bathe in the anointing of the message of the hour oh you were made you w
