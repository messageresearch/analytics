praise the Lord [Applause] we'll just go ahead and go right into the word we can turn to First Corinthians chapter 11. First Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 3. but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God let's just go ahead and pray Lord Jesus we come into your presence this evening Lord and Lord we've we've worshiped you Lord we've we've praised your name we've done our best to to set the atmosphere Lord and Lord we Lord I know that I I can feel your presence here Lord Lord I trust that the rest can feel it as well Lord and Lord we we want you to be welcome here Lord we want you to take control of the service Lord I pray that you would just Lord help me to to get out of the way Lord help me to to Just Surrender myself to you Lord so that you're able to to use the the gift Lord use my lips use use my words Lord Jesus just speak through me to the to the needs of the people Lord you see everything that's on the hearts of the people Lord everything that they're concerned with everything that they're facing everything that they're dealing with Lord Jesus and Lord I I pray that you administer to each one right now Lord I lift before you sister Denise and brother Mike King Lord and and Joel in the hospital Lord Jesus Lord I I got the call from them earlier that Joel had begun to pass more blood Lord and so they were going into to to examine him more with with the cameras and things Lord Lord we pray that you would just move on the scene Lord that you would take control there Lord that you would Lord that you would just touch him Lord and more than anything Lord that you would just continue to to touch his heart Lord to touch his soul lord Jesus and Lord may you just be glorified in the situation Lord be with brother Mike and sister Denise Lord give them peace and give them Faith Lord and the strength that they need is their their going through this with Joel or just Lord we commit the situation into your hands Lord we just commit the mind of the service into your hands Lord we just we want to hear from you we love you and we thank you Lord the name Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seats I always feel uh I always feel a little bit bad for my Sunday school class when I'm called up to preach because I feel like they've gotten here the uh uh the trial version of the first version of most of my sermons through Sunday school um and then they just hear what take two or take three when I come up to preach but so headship uh according to the definition is the duty or function of watching or guarding for the sake of proper direction or control Authority is the power or right to give orders make decisions and enforce obedience let's turn to Colossians chapter one Colossians chapter 1 and verse 18. and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence preeminence our our pastor has been mentioning a few times in the Bible studies and preeminence is the fact of surpassing all others it is superiority and then let's turn to Hebrews chapter 13. Hebrews chapter 13. and verse 17. obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as that as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you now a lot of times when we begin to talk about the ideas of headship and submission people immediately begin to get a little pull back a little bit begin to get a little bit defensive because the way that we think of headship and submission is very much colored by the society that we live in by the fact that we're a western mindset by the effect by the effect of the culture that's around us but if we just go back not even that far but just go back to the Middle Ages the idea of headship and submission were much more easily understood just looking through a little bit of History I found a couple things that I I found pretty interesting um written in uh in the use of law published posthumously in 1629 by Francis Bacon he wrote fealty is to take an oath upon a book that he will be a faithful tenant to the king in 11th century France um this was written on in uh on feudal obligations by the bishop folbert of charters in France he says ask to write something concerning the form of fealty I have noted briefly for you on the authority of the books the things which follow he who swears fealty to his Lord ought to always have these six things in memory what is harmless safe honorable useful easy practicable harmless that is to say that he should not be injurious to his Lord and his body safe that he should not be injurious to him in his Secrets or in the defense through which he is able to be secure honorable that he should not be injurious to him in Justice or in other matters that pertain to his honor useful that he should not be injurious to him in possessions easy or practicable that the good which his Lord is able to do easily he make not difficult nor that which is practicable he make impossible to him however that the faithful vassal should avoid these injuries as proper but not for this does he deserve his holding for it is not sufficient to abstain from Evil unless what is good is done also it remains therefore that in the same six things mentioned above he should be Faithfully he should Faithfully counsel and Aid his Lord if he wishes to be looked upon as worthy of his benefits and to be safe concerning the fealty which he has sworn the Lord also ought to act toward his faithful vastel reciprocally and all these things and if he does not do this he will be justly considered guilty of bad faith just as the former if he should be detected in the avoidance of or the doing of or consenting to them would be perfidious and perjured the Lord and vassal relationship was understood to have benefits for both parties while today many people look at headship and submission is one person giving up all their rights for nothing in history it was understood to have benefits going both ways even if you were the one that was swearing allegiance that you were pledging fealty that you were giving yourself over to a lord there was something you were getting in return it wasn't just that you were giving up your rights or giving up your ability to make decisions going I'll just do what you want there was something that was coming both directions this wasn't a one-sided relationship let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 15. First Corinthians chapter 15 and we'll start at verse 24. then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put down all Rule and all authority and power for he must Reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is Manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all the scripture tells that even Christ is subject when we go to John chapter 5 and verse 19 . it says then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things so ever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise for the Father loveth the Son and showeth him all things that himself doeth and he will show him Greater Works than these that ye may Marvel and so and then we go to Ephesians chapter five and starting at verse 21 it says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that love is his wife loveth himself for for no man ever hated his own flesh but nourisheth it and cherished with it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband and so Paul as he's writing he types it in the relationship between the husband and the wife but in verse 32 he makes it very clear this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church not to say that the instruction doesn't apply to the marriage but I'm talking to you about the relationship with Christ I'm talking to you about the submission and the headship that we're going to have here brother Branham said in the sermon the medus meanest man in Santa Maria he said I was talking to someone today when Rebecca come to meet Isaac did you notice she veiled her State her face they still do they they don't know what they're doing but a bride veils her face why the man is her's head and then the nature of the woman is to yield to a man and that's the reason the church should be veiled it has got ahead that is Christ that's the way the woman is supposed to wear long hair because of her head which is her husband he used to have short hair because of Christ the woman wears long hair because of angels what is the Angels the messenger a true Messenger to the church that's right he will always call it down says it's wrong see and so forth and the church to be so yielded to Jesus that it don't claim its own head its own headship Christ is the headship of the church veiled we not our own but we're his yielded to him and him alone how beautiful so submission is the action or fact of accepting or yielding to a superior force or to the will or authority of another person when in medieval times when they would come to to swear fealty to give themselves over to another Lord they would come and they would bend the knee to the Lord and they would say I will first they had two different steps to it there was fealty and then I forget the term for the other one but the first thing they would do is basically an act of total surrender they would kneel down on both knees they would put their hands together in front of them and the Lord that they were swearing allegiance to would place his hands on the outside of their hands to signify that he accepted their complete surrender then they would go through feel to where they would just swear the oath and go through saying all the verbal things that I will govern the land as you would have me I will do this I will do that and in medieval times basically the idea was I'm swearing feel to you if you go into a war go into a battle I will call up the soldiers that I can I will come fight for you for whatever you deem is worthy of fighting for and then the leads Lord would be the one that would go okay I'm going to help uh provide for the land that you have I'm going to make sure that uh if you're attacked my Army's going to be coming in to to help fight for this I'm going to uh if you or things are going on that you need assistance with I'm here to help provide for it and so the vassal was there to work the land and to uh you know pay his uh his fees to his liege Lord and all these different things to call up the Army when need be but there was was a give and take relationship where they were both getting something from it you had one person that was above the other but yet it wasn't just a one-sided relationship they were both receiving something from it now this obviously isn't a perfect type of our relationship with Christ um but it begins to give us a better idea when we actually start to think about it instead of thinking about it from the way that Society wants us to think about when it comes to submission the most people if you talk to it have been in society and I I Society now would be if I'm going to submit it's gonna grade against me because I have my rights I have what I want to do I have how I want to handle things how I want to do things it's all about my rights we're in the age of laodicea it's all about people's rights and what I can do the idea of me submitting and giving up those rights to someone else just greats against most people in Isaiah chapter 4 and verse 1. and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by then thy name to take away our approach brother Brandon said in the sermon the flashing red light of his coming he said when Isaiah 5 when he talked about how the immorals of the women would get in the last days and so much clothes they'd have and how they'd have to have their hair set and everything like that the Bible speaks that how she'd walk with high-heeled shoes on tinkling her feet as she went and and the things she would do and all that be taken away from her and she shall sit and stink for Immortal and said even seven women will grab one man and said we'll do our own work just let us take your name to take away our approach let us have your name but don't make us submit let us still be able to live the way that we want to let us still be able to do whatever we want just let us have your name so that you take away our reproach that's very much what we see in society where it goes well no I want to be able to do what I want you know it's pretty much standard now when people get married or get in a relationship they still keep completely separate bank accounts what the woman has this is her money what the man has this is his money maybe they have a third account where they share some but he has no right to what's hers she has no right to what's his they're separate that's like standard in today's society this is normal that people don't merge everything that it doesn't all come together it goes well no this way if we have to split up the break is easy you still have what's yours you still have what's yours we can go our separate ways and everything's fine but there are blessings that come from submission and headship that's what I'm going to be ministering on tonight is the blessings of submission so let's turn to to Genesis chapter 22. Genesis chapter 22 and we'll start at verse 8. and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou feirest God seeing thou Hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen I think this first one is pretty easy submission to proper headship brings you provision brother Brandon said in the sermon Jehovah Jireh said could you imagine this little boy Isaac being born Abraham and Sarah now about a hundred and and 15 years old was Sarah and about 125 years old was Abraham wait here's the promised child that pretty little boy about 16 years old little hair hanging down over her shoulder a handsome little lad how he loved his father and his mother and Justin is obedient you know children that's what you ought to be to your father and mother I think it's awful when you hear young people say my old man and my old woman I don't believe you people in Carolina you little children would say that way up in the northern lands where I come from they see it and it's too bad they ever say it listen that's not the old man an old woman someday when the floors is creaking and cracking a casket is going out and you look and see a gray-headed person laying there it won't be the old man then that's your daddy that's your mother you honor them now that's the first commandment with promise honor your father and mother which may lengthen the days on the earth that the lord giveth thee so little Isaac being so subject in subjection to his father and mother because he was a type of Christ as he wasn't subject to the father perfectly and how he minded his father and mother in Jehovah Jireh brother random says and as he throw the wood on Little Isaac Soldier and climbed upon the hill a type of Christ wish we had time to go into it but we're pressed right now so up the hill when Isaac he said father here's the wood and here's the fire and the altar but where is the Lamb for the burnt offering he said my son God will provide for himself a lamb oh my you see it something had to happen God will provide I told the boys you and I'd be back God told me to come up here and kill you but God will provide somehow I don't know how I'm going to come out but I'm just walking on God will provide I love that don't you his faith didn't fail he didn't stagger reached over goddess son tied his hands and feet his only beloved Son God and Abraham you see it God and Abraham could tell God could take his own word through Abraham to trust himself and if you've got the Holy Spirit surely God would trust his own word as your healer as your savior Abraham was under submission he was willing to do what his head had told him to his head commanded him go sacrifice your son logically this makes no sense we've heard sermon after sermon go into this but Abraham was willing to be in submission and go this is what I'm told this is what I'm gonna do and God will provide I don't know how I can't explain it but I know that God will provide as long as I continue to do what he's telling me to do as long as I continue to remain in submission to him brother random said in the sermon God hath provided a way Moses the father and mother of Moses had to do something similar to that how is Moses going to deliver the people when they seen you as a fair child if they shoved him out there in the midst of a bunch of crocodiles how is he going to be a deliverer how is he going to do it well they received him in that manner so they pushed him back out into the crocodiles knowing god could take care of it and God did take care of it God got his hand on his church God got his hand on his man on his woman God is able to take care of the situation so Abraham said we will return when you left home this morning did you tell husband when I come back I'll be feeling different yes sir how are you going to know it I don't know but I will oh amen I'll be different when I come back you just watch and see how are you going to do it God will provide there when this great crucial hour come and they went up to the top of the mountain and Abraham took his knife out took the little boy and he said this question to him said father here's the wood here's the altar but where is the burnt offering he said God will provide an offering isn't that a lesson to us God will provide there's no need of us getting all upset about anything God will provide it in First Kings chapter 17 we find Elijah and he is he comes to deliver the message it's not going to rain until I say so he comes to to Ahab and tells him until I give the word there's going to be no rain there's going to be no Dew and then he immediately follows God's command to go east and hide thyself by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan he goes and the scriptures tell us that the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook got he didn't have to prepare all the food himself and take this huge pack of supplies he went in submission ago this is where God told me to go this is what I'm supposed to do and when he gets there God provides God doesn't provide in a way that would be expected but he still makes sure to provide so the prophet had sustenance while he was there you know he probably expected I'm going to the brook there should be some water he expected that part he probably didn't expect when the first Raven showed up with bread and fish he probably didn't see that one coming here comes the food okay this is how it's going to be and he was able to eat because God was continuing to provide as we continue through the story The Brook dries up and Elijah gets sent on and he's sent to meet the the widow woman and so he goes and here she is she's Gathering up the last two sticks so that she can make the last of her meal for her and her son and then they'll die and Elijah comes and he says fear not go and do as thou I said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son she then has the decision to make on am I going to listen to the word am I going to come under subjection of this word that's being given to me I have the choice I can either be subject to it or I cannot looking at it logically from this moment this makes no sense why would I give this to this strange man who's now telling me It's Gonna Last but instead she chooses to be under subjection to the prophet whether she knew it was the prophet right at that moment I don't know but she chooses to come under subjection of it and because she came under subjection she was provided for because she chose to come in her subjection the oil lasted and the meal lasted and so they kept eating and they didn't have to die now she could have if she had gone and done it her own way and not been her subjection they would have ate one meal and that would have been it it would have been the end but she chose to come under subjection and so subjection to the proper headship gives provision it provides for us it gives us what we have need of at that time you know we can go into uh the story of Ruth and here we find Ruth as she comes back to the land of Israel with Naomi and they come back and they have nothing they're just two Widow women they have no way to provide and so Ruth decides to go glean in the field and she happens to go to boaz's field and she's there working and Boaz comes and talks to her after he finds out who she is he comes and talks to her and he says here's thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field they do reap and go after them have I not charged the young man that they shall not touch thee and when thou art of thirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn she gives him instructions stay here stay here and you'll be provided for you now she could have been like well I can glean here for a while and I can probably go in that other field for you know at least an hour or two and get a couple more over there she could have made that kind of decision to go hey I'm going to work double shifts I'm going to get extra at this other field so we can really get it coming in like sometimes us guys want to do I'll work double shifts and maybe it means that I'm going to miss church but I'll I'll do the double shifts that I can get a little bit more coming in um but yet they had the instruction on how to be provided for stay in my field I'll make sure it look have the water you're not limited from it the my men are drawing the water you don't even have to draw it yourself you just go over drink you'll be safe here I've commanded everyone not to touch you just come here and you will be provided for and so she goes through this and she continues through it and after she had risen to to go and and follow the the the command that he'd given her he tells his Reapers drop extra make sure that there's extra on the ground floor drop the handfuls of purpose just to make sure that there's no temptation to go somewhere else I want to make sure she has plenty so that way she and her mother-in-law will be taken care of we continue on through the the story of Ruth and Naomi is now the one giving her instructions going hey Boaz is going to be at his threshing floor and after he falls asleep this is what I want you to do now once again Ruth has the choice of am I going to be in submission to the guidance that I'm being given to the headship that's that's in place right now she what didn't have one a man to be in headship over her but she had her mother-in-law she had the Elder that was in place to give her the instruction to go this is what you need to do and so she's like okay I'm going to go through this I'm going to do as I've been instructed and she goes to the place and she goes and she waits till Boaz is asleep and she uncovers his feet and lays down at his feet and waits for him to wake up and they have the whole conversation we're on to save time a little bit I'm not going to read through the whole story we all have read this story so many times but he sells her that she's uh he thanks her for uh coming and being interested in marrying him um and he says you know what I'm not the closest Kinsman I have to go talk to somebody else but I don't want you to worry about it I want you to go back home and wait there until I come for you until I come to talk to you and then he makes sure he says bring the veil thou Hast upon me and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city I want you to go while I deal with this situation but let me make sure that you've got food while you're gone let me make sure that you have no need to leave the house you don't need to go reap anywhere I've provided here's what you need and when she goes home Naomi tells her the same thing says good rest here because he won't rest until it's handled and so she remains in ah submission and because of that she's provided for and because of that she's redeemed and because of that she becomes the wife to Boaz because she keeps being willing to be in submission to the headship that's around her to the instructions she's being given to go this is what I need to do and the provision will come it didn't mean that for the longest time she didn't have to work she still had to go reap in the field she still had to do her part but the instructions were there for the Reapers keep dropping a little bit extra make sure she has everything that she needs Luke chapter 12 and verse 24. it says consider the Ravens for they neither sow nor reap which neither have Storehouse nor Barn and God feedeth them how much more are ye better than the fowls and which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit if ye then be not able to do that which is least why take you thought for the rest consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these if then God so clothed the grass which is today in the field and tomorrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe You O ye of little faith and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be of doubtful mind for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that you have need of these things but rather seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you Lord let's turn to Luke chapter 16. we'll talk about one of the talk about Another Blessing of submission of submission here Luke chapter 16 and verse 10. he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much let's go to Matthew chapter 8. Matthew chapter 8. and starting at verse 5. and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and Jesus saith on him I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way and as thou Hast believed so it be done unto thee and his servant was healed in the self-same hour now the Centurion said he said I'm a man under Authority and to reach the rank of centurion he didn't step into that day one he had gone through a process he had gone through a process where he had had to be proven he had had to show that he was willing to follow his orders that he was willing to do the dirty job that he was willing to do this and do that and through that he had advanced and so he had come to the point where now he had authority of other over others but he had only given he was only given that Authority because he had been subject to Authority because he was willing to be in submission and do what he was told if he had been a man that complete what was always disobeying orders and always doing the wrong thing he wouldn't have advanced and so when we are under submission to Authority when we're under submission to our headship a lot of times we can find that Authority is given to us that we get into a place where we begin to have authority as we move through brother random said in the sermon Jairus he says in the Roman Centurion that had a friend that was sick his servant he said I'm not even worthy that you come under my roof just speak the word for I am a man under Authority and I say to this man do this and he doeth it and to this man do that and he do with it see that Roman recognized that Jesus his word had all the power that was needed for the healing of the person he knew that was in him was invested the power of Jehovah God and he knew that whatever Jesus said that he mastered diseases he mastered the sea he mastered the universe that's what he is tonight the same yesterday today and forever if you could only recognize that his word has Supremacy over every demon every Power every all everything every sin every sickness every disease every Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever believe what he said he said I'm a man under Authority and I know that anybody's under me has to obey me and my word is Law and Order he has to do it and he knew that Jesus Christ had sickness under his feet he had disease under his feet so when we look at it in the physical natural realm I have authority at my job I have that Authority because someone else gave me this Authority I didn't go in and throw my weight around and go you've got to listen to me because I'm bigger and stronger than you I've got to do this it was my boss said hey this is your job this is what you have the authority to do you can't do this but you can do this and as long as I'm abiding by The Authority that I've been granted there are those that have to listen to what I say there are those that have to follow my instructions because I have authority at a certain level now this is an authority that's not by my own making Authority isn't something that I have because of my own strength or because of my own power Authority comes from something else someone else gave it to me and now I'm expressing their strength I'm expressing their power through the authority that I'm using you know if we look at it from the the marriage uh and and the way that God has created is I as the husband have a certain level of authority that God has given me God has placed me as the head of my home this is the god-given authority that I have my wife has an authority within the home she has an authority over the children she has an authority over the way the house is run she has an authority over these different things that Authority was not given to her by me so I can't take it away even though it may look like I'm above her in Authority I didn't give the authority to her so I can't take it away her Authority was given to her by God to go this is your role as the wife this is your role as the mother and it may be my place to be the head but that doesn't mean I can tell her well this isn't your job anymore because an authority above me told her this is her job so the person The Authority comes from is the one that can take away the authority not someone else I didn't give it to her so I can't take it away she didn't give me my authority so she can't take it away from me God is the one who lay down said this is Brother Colby as the head of your home this is your Authority Sister Mary this is your Authority brother Colby you have no right to take away sister Mary's Authority this is how she takes care of the kids when you're at work make sure the house is taken care of does these things runs the household in different ways that's her Authority you have your Authority as the head of the home and Sister Mary has no right to take that away from you or to undermine it or undercut it because this is how God laid it out we all have the authority we've been given but it isn't that brother Kobe is the head and so he gives sister Mary The Authority no God laid it out God said this is your Authority as the wife as the mother this is what you are in charge of this is how you're handling things and I think that's one of the things that we break down a lot of times because we think about it like a hierarchy all too often like we see in a business of this person above this person above this person above this person so if the husbands of love the wife then the husband can do whatever he wants to tell the wife whatever he wants except that her Authority doesn't come from him so that's not the way it works it's not the way it connects her Authority comes from someone above the husband her position is decreed by the husband's Authority brother random said in the sermon and ensign he says we don't have power we've got Authority it's not a power it's Authority we don't need power Christ has the power but we've got the authority amen there's a lot of difference he was the one who conquered he conquered and gave us the authority he's got the power but we got the authority just like any Ambassador going to another country here to explain it to you you go down here at one of these Crossings here in Phoenix along about five o'clock in the afternoon there's a policeman standing out there here's the cars passing by at 40 50 miles an hour well that bit little bitty policeman maybe not five foot high walk out there why he hasn't got power enough to stop one of them cars one of them cars maybe 300 horsepower well they just pick up that little fellow up and crush them and go on but let him raise his hand once blow the whistle he hasn't got power but he's got Authority that's it brakes will slide wheels will squeak everything will stop because he raised up his hand because he has an authority and when a man or a woman is dressed in the full armor of God it ain't power it's Authority from on high when he says Devils will scream and brakes will squeak even death itself will shudder and graves will open at the authority that Jesus Christ gave his church all men know this these signs shall follow them that believe lift up the authority the Ensign his hand raise up with his white glove on and every car will stop he hasn't got enough power maybe to stop a bicycle but he's got authority to stop anything that comes across that street because why the whole law of Phoenix is behind him and a Christian that's dead and buried and raised with him in his resurrection in Heavenly places see if we're Dead with him then we're also raised with him for the body goes where the head is and he is the head and this is the body and not will be but now we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus with every Power of the devil conquered and under his feet authority authority there is the answer that's the hand that lifts up that counts we don't when we stand against the devil coming in with sickness or with trial or any of these different things it's not because of our power or our strength it's we're able to stand with the authority of Christ he's the one with the power he's the one with the strength and that power isn't just to the husband as the head of the home the wife has that same authority to call on when the husband's at work and the kids are running wild around the house and she they're acting like little Devils she has the same authority to begin to bring it under control she has the same authority to apply to that home now maybe dad has to come and do some whippings when he comes home it happens but she has the authority if one of her kids is getting sick she has the authority to say the prayer to lay on the Hands of Faith and apply the token she has that same Authority because the authority comes from the one above the man comes from Christ because Christ is the one who laid it out and said this is the authority that each of these positions have I'm the one giving it to you Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 it says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross he put himself under submission and became obedient he became obedient to the instruction the father was giving to go you're going to die now he didn't want to we know from the garden he was going Lord let this cup pass I don't want to die no human would want to die brother Brandon told us in different sermons as a man he had the right to get married he had the right to have a life he had the right to live out these different things but he chose to instead be under the headship be in submission and give up those rights to then be the sacrifice he humbled himself down to the point that he would follow the instructions that he was given wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things that heaven and things in the earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father submission to proper headship can bring Authority that can happen in the natural that can happen in the spiritual that God gives us the authority to deal with these different situations that come along it's not our power it's not our strength to overcome but as us our Authority that's been given to us by him let's go to First Samuel chapter 10. first Samuel chapter 10 and verse 17. and Samuel called the people together unto the Lord to mizpah and said unto the children of Israel thus saith the Lord God of Israel I brought up Israel out of Egypt and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of them that oppressed you and you have this day rejected your God who himself saved you all out of your adversities and your tribulations and you have said on him nay but set a king over us now therefore present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands and when Samuel had caused all cause all the tribes of Israel to come near The Tribe of Benjamin was taken when he had caused The Tribe of Benjamin to come nearby their families the family of maitri was taken and Saul the son of Kish was taken and when they sought him he could not be found therefore they inquired of the Lord further if the man should yet come thither and the Lord answered behold he hath hid himself among the stuff and they ran and fetched him fence and when he stood among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulder and upward and Samuel said to all the people see him whom the Lord hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people and all the people shouted and said God saved the king then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the Lord and Samuel sent all the people away every man to his house and Saul also went home to gibea and there went with him a band of man his Hearts God had touched so we start out with this story with Israel deciding that they don't want to be in submission they don't want to be under the headship of God they want a king and Samuel's upset and God tells him you don't need to be upset they didn't reject you they rejected me and God gives them what they asked for said okay we'll give them a king they didn't want to be under submission to me they didn't want to be under my headship so we'll give them a king for them to be under submission to a King whose headship they're going to follow yeah in the sermon in the Samaritan Church age and the church age book it says when they approached Samuel and asked for a King Samuel was so dismayed that his heart almost failed him God had been leading his people through this consecrated scripture Vindicated prophet and he felt that he had been rejected he gathered the people and pleaded with them not to turn away from The God Who had carried them like children and prosper them and bless them but they persisted they said to Samuel you've never been wrong in your leading you've never been dishonest in your financial dealings you've done your best to keep us in line with the word of the lord we appreciate the Miracles wisdom provision and protection of God we believe in it we like it and furthermore we don't want to be without it it's just that we want a king to lead us to battle we just want to have something we can see we just want to have someone that we can look at and go this is who's leading us this is who we're following this is who we're listening to and so they rejected one submission so God gives them the king God gives them Saul Saul's appointed as king it's all laid out this is how the kingdom is going to work it's written in the book they all go home and at first it doesn't really seem like anything changes Saul went back home to gibia it's not like he's out throwing orders around right away he just he went home everybody went home the only thing that changed was there's some men that followed him so now Saul has all these people that he's got to take care of at his house that he's got to make sure fed and clothed and armed because they'd followed him but beyond that nothing changed in Israel he didn't start making decrees about this that or the other he just went home in first Samuel chapter 11. and verse 1. the ammonite came up and it camped against jabish Gilead and all the men of jebusch said unto nahatch make a covenant with us and we will serve thee and nahash the m and I answered them on this condition will I make a covenant with you that I may thrust out all of your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel and the Elders of jabus said unto him give us seven days respite that we may send Messengers unto all the coasts of Israel and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee then came The Messengers to gibea of Saul and told the tidings and the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices and wept and behold Saul came after the herd out of the field and Saul said what ailith the people that they weep and they told them the tidings of the men of jabish and the spirit of God Came Upon Saul when he heard those Tidings and his anger was kindled greatly and he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of Messengers saying whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the Lord fell on the people and they came out with one consent so the enemy comes to jabish Gillian and said to take him out and jabus Gillian who is supposed to be under headship of a king now on their own goes well let's make a deal let's we'll we'll do a covenant with you we'll what do you want we'll give it to you everything will be fine we don't need a king to come save us we can do this deal on our own and the enemy goes great I want to Blind every single man in one eye I want all of your right eyes okay this didn't seem like a good deal anymore they thought they could make a deal and then they go okay well give us seven days to see if there's anyone that will will come save us and if they won't then we'll come out and give them to you now don't really understand the enemy's thought why he didn't just go ahead and take them through Force maybe he thought hey no one's going to come save him and then I don't have to fight all you got to do is sit around for seven days and the exact same thing will happen maybe that was his thought I don't know which one it was but they send out Messengers and here's Saul the king and I will point out still nothing had changed Saul was still out in the field plowing he was still working in the field the same as he always had he was the king but at this point there was no difference he was still there just working his father's land doing like he'd always done every other day of his life but then the message comes hey they're all gonna lose the right ice because the enemy has come into the land and then the headship Rises up because his anger is kindled his righteous indignation gets kicked up and he goes known that's not happening that is not acceptable and so he sends this message out to the entire country he kills his oxen he Hues apart all the instruments he was using his old life is over there's no going back to plow tomorrow the oxen's Dead the instruments are dead he is fully going I'm King and I have to go fight there is no going back to the field like always he sends it out to all the nation and says either come or the same things happening to your fields and your animals and your oxen certainly happens to all of them unless you show up and so the entire nation comes to him and Saul leads them they fight and to keep it short they win they defeat this ammonite that's come in and so the next one and one of the ones that I think we always want to think about is that submission to proper headship brings protection Saul was the king the nation was to be in submission to him they had the right to call for protection to call for help the enemies upon us Saul hadn't even stepped in really to the role of King yet he was plowing the field but the call came we need help and then headship had a responsibility headship had a responsibility to come in and go they need protection a fight a battle needs to take place and it's my job to lead it it's my job to go into place let's turn to Joshua chapter 9. Joshua chapter 9 and we'll start at verse 3. and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to AI they did work Wiley and they went and made as if they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and wine bottles old and rent and bound up in old shoes and clouded upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread of their Provisions was dry and moldy and they went to Joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said in him and to the men of Israel we come from a far country now therefore making a league with us and the men of Israel said unto the hivites per Adventure ye dwell Among Us how shall we make a league with you and they said unto Joshua we are thy servants and Joshua said unto them who are ye and once Come Ye and they said unto him from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the Lord thy God for we have heard of the fame of him and all that he did in Egypt let's drop down to verse 22. and Joshua called for them and he spoke unto them saying wherefore have you beguiled us saying we are from very far from you when you dwell Among Us now therefore ye are cursed and there shall none of you be freed from being Bond men and humors of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God and the answer Joshua and said because it was certainly told thy servants how that the Lord thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you therefore we were so afraid of Our Lives because of you and have done this thing and now behold we are in thine hand as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us do and so did he unto them and deliver them out of the hand of the children of Israel that they slew them not and Joshua made them that day heroes of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord even unto this day in the place which he should choose so Israel has come in and they have destroyed Jericho and AI the message is going abroad Israel's basically Unstoppable at this point is what everyone's thinking and so the gibeonites are like okay we've got to try to save ourselves because we can't beat them in battle it's not going to happen and so they set up this deception and come here let us make this league with you and okay fine we'll make a league with you and then the deception is discovered Israel says how dare you and the people of Guild go we just don't want to die it's basically all we're looking for we just don't want to die so whatever you want to do with us as long as you're not killing us we're good with it we're willing to do whatever you want they were willing to come under submission and so Joshua goes fine you're going to be our servants you're going to be drawers of water and humors of wood for the uh for our God for the rest of time this is what you're doing and the men of gilgal go fine We're Not Dead we're better off than we thought we would be that's good enough for us I'm good being a servant okay then we go into Joshua chapter 10. and in Joshua chapter 10 it's verse 1 it says now it came to pass when Adam nazedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ahi and it utterly destroyed it as he had done to Jericho and her King so he had done to Ai and her King and how the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them that they feared greatly because gibeon was a great city as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than Ai and all of the men thereof were mighty wherefore Adam isadek king of Jerusalem Senator hoem king of Hebron and under Purim king of jarmouth and unto jaffea king of lakish and unto Debra king of eglon saying come up unto me and help me that we may spite gibeon for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel therefore the five Kings of the ant the five Kings of the amorites the king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king of jarmouth the king of Lakers the king of Eglin gathered themselves together and went up they and all of their hosts and encamped before gibeon and may warn against it and the men of gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to gilgal saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the king of the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered against us gilgal is now putting themselves as servants they have come under Authority we're your servants will do the job you tell us to do we'll do what you want the enemy goes well this isn't okay this this cannot be allowed we have to destroy them they come to fight against gilgal and gilgal sends the message to Joshua says we're your servants when I was talking earlier about in medieval times about how this was a two-way street this is the same thing they're going hey there's a two-way street here worse your servant will do whatever you want but you have to protect us this is the other part of we're here to serve you to meet your needs to do what you tell us but the enemy is attacking and now part of your responsibility part of your headship is to come fight and to protect us and go into verse eight and the Lord said unto Joshua fear them not for I have delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night and the Lord discomfitted them before Israel and slew them with a great Slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth are on and smote them to Attica and unto Mecca and it came to pass that they fled before Israel and were in going down to bethron that the Lord cast down great stones from Heaven upon them unto azica and they died they were more which died with hailstones and they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword so not only did they get protection from Joshua but God respected it God respected that they were willing to go look we just don't want to die we will be your servant we will do what you want Joshua comes to fight and then God goes I'm getting in on this and starts throwing rocks and when God throws a rock is over he throws down the hailstones and takes out more with the Rocks than the men of Israel did men of Israel killed people they took out some of the enemy but God took out way more than they did spake Joshua to the Lord and the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel son stand now still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agilon and the sun Stood Still and the moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies so not only is Joshua defending his servants but he goes so far as to go hey I'm not done son stopped there Moon stopped there there are more enemies that need to be defeated it's not good enough that we've gone this far the enemy can get away we've protected our servants no you attacked our servants you all have to go and so there was never a day like that the scriptures say that and there was no day like that before it or after that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of man for the Lord fought for Israel and this all started because they were out to protect some of the men that the original instruction was to destroy but those men were willing to give themselves under submission go we just don't want to die we'll be your servant we'll do whatever you want we're not trying to convince you to worship our gods or anything we'll we will serve your God we will bring the water we will Hew the wood we will do what we need to take care if that's what you want us to do will come under that submission and God had respect for that to the point where he would fight for Israel he would throw down the Rocks he would stop the Sun and Moon so that the enemy could be destroyed sir submission to the proper headship brings about protection I talked a little bit earlier about how it brings Authority and so the wives have a certain level of authority within the home but if sister Fresca and her Authority is dealing with a situation and someone is bothering her she has the right to turn to her head and say talk to him she has the right to take the person that's bothering her this issue and pass it on yeah go uh talk to my husband if someone is bothering my wife she doesn't have to handle it on her own God didn't put her at the head God put me at the head so if she has a problem that she can't handle or doesn't want to handle she has every right to say talk to Harry or to call me over to become the barrier between her and whatever the issue is she has that right every wife has that right to put the husband out in front and go you know what this salesman's getting a little too aggressive I don't want to deal with it anymore they're not wanting to hear no from me great talk to my husband I don't have to deal with this I have a head well guess what when Satan's getting like that with us and he keeps wanting to beat you over and he won't listen he won't accept it he keeps throwing it at you you keep going no by your stripes I'm Healed I don't accept that I don't accept that I don't accept that eventually you hit the point of going look talk to my head if you don't want to listen to me you don't want to listen to that talk to my head he's the one you have to deal with he's the one you have to go through talk to my husband go through him if you want to get to me in the church age book and the fellow different Church age it says when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the Key of David God being Sovereign he foreknew by Divine decree who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her Delight Psalms 24 and verse 8 says who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle okay brother Joe you're going into the doctor tomorrow for your lungs to get them checked again right okay you have the authority to tell them to go talk to your husband you have the authority where you don't have to stand there on your own you can go you know what talk to him you talk to Christ I don't have to deal with this it's not required of me I have a head that I can pass it on to I have a head who has the power who has all that they need for the victory who already has won the victory forget that can get the victory victory is already done and we have the right as the Bride of the Christ to pass it on to her husband we have the authority to deal with things we also have the ability to pass it on to our husband for the protection that he provides the same thing it is in the natural you know I have the same thing when it looks at it from a workplace standpoint I have a certain level of authority well part of that Authority is my job is to protect those underneath me if I have a if we have a customer that's come in that is extremely irate and all these kind of things my responsibility is to step between them and those under me and to take the brunt of it it's my responsibility to protect them I have this Authority but with the authority there's also this responsibility of protecting those under me to take care of them as a husband I'm the head of the home there's a level of authority I have but there's also a responsibility I have to protect my wife to protect my children not just in physical but to protect them emotionally to protect them spiritually I have a responsibility to do it not just an ability not just an ability to protect them but I have the responsibility to do it and we have the same thing as Christians where we have been granted this Authority but we are also able to turn it to our husband for protection and there's a responsibility there and Christ doesn't shirk his responsibility he's the ever-present help in time of trouble he's quick to step in he's quick to come in and be the Lord Mighty in battle the scripture I read earlier from Isaiah chapter 4. starting at verse 1 it says in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we shall eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our approach that sounds a lot like the world that's going on around us but the rest of the chapter is beautiful verse two and in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel and are succumbed to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be Called holy even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem and we know that Zion brother Brandon taught us Zion can also be you can put the bride there you can put bride in in place of Zion and so and it shall come to pass that he that is left in the bride and he that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be Called holy even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and The Shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the Heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from the storm and from rain during the same time that you have all these people that just want to take on the husband's name to take away their approach but they don't want to do what he wants them to do they just want to do their own thing still not be under submission at the same time here's God saying but my children the branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel and in verse 5 and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon her assembly is a cloud and smoke by day and The Shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense everyone doesn't want what God wants to offer them they want to do their own thing brother random talked about the fact that that applies to the dominations that they want to have the the name of Christian they want to have the name of Christ but not come under submission but yet here God through the prophet Isaiah is writing and saying but at that same time during the same time that you're seeing that happen everywhere I'm going to be the one providing defense I'm going to be the one providing the defense providing the protection for mine for my bride in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride it says oh pray the Lord Jesus watch here how the words cannot fail now watch here in Isaiah I got it wrote down here if I can find again just a minute now listen he's talking of the coming of the Lord how the woman would be so immoral and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we'll eat our own bread where our own apparel and let us be called by thy name to take away our approach that's the end time where we're living now marriage divorce prostitution whatever and that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and cumbling The Escape of Israel how that you escaped all that damnation see and it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and that's a Remnant in Jerusalem in Jerusalem Shall be Called holy even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem see where in the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion remember that's always the bride see and shall have purified the blood of Jerusalem that's the remnant of the Jews plus the bride and in the midst thereof with the spirit of judgment fire that's always God's judgment when he makes his final judgment calls you justifies you and brings you to Redemption then his judgment breaks forth upon you and the Holy Ghost and Fire cleanses away the sin then you're his same thing he does to the earth when he purges it with fire and by the spirit of burning now look listen are you ready and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon her assembly a cloud of smoke by day a shining of Fire by a night for upon all the glory shall be a defense the Lord in that day upon the top of it shall create a fire of light to burn upon the day and it goes and says it'll be a shelter a rest a refuge notice making exactly the speaking of the Bible exactly the walls were straight up and down you couldn't see it it has to lean all my holy mountains he'll create this light upon this mountain and it shall be for a defense psalm 91. starting at verse 1. he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God and him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and Buckler thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth in Noonday A thousand shall follow thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee Only With Thine Eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall be no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over there to keep thee in all thy ways Thou shalt bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against a stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and Adder the Young Lion and the dragon shalt thou trample on her feet because he had set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation as the musicians go ahead and come in the sermon letting off the pressure brother random says if you're all pressured up and you don't know where you're going what's going to happen to you after death and you know you're going to die sometime you've got to do then the thing to come is come to Christ The Refuge and let off the pressure settle once for all no matter what takes place Christ is our refuge and when we come to him we can let off the pressure you can quit worrying about well if I die what's going to happen to me what's going to happen to the wife what's going to happen to the husband what's going to happen to the children just come to Christ and let off the pressure he gives us all things all things are ours by Christ so just let the pressure off the only way you can do it somebody might give you a million dollars it would build up pressure you might join a church and it would still build up pressure because the Methodist will tell you they're right and the Baptist is wrong and the Baptists say they're wrong and we're right so it just builds up more pressure because you don't know where you're standing but if you ever come to Christ you can let off the pressure because it's all over then just settle it down it's God's provided place of safety where God said the name of the Lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into and are safe in a time of sickness when sickness strikes and the doctor says there's nothing else I can do about it don't build up pressure let off the pressure call your pastor let him anoint you in oil and pray over you the prayer of faith shall save the sick let off the pressure see he's our refuge while you're in this Refuge you got you got the right to anything that's in the Refuge and Christ is our refuge and everything you have need of is in him Amen in sickness don't build up pressure let off pressure you say well I wonder brother Branham you don't wonder you just let the pressure off commit your case to God and go on as if it was all over don't build up pressure it lets off pressure well you say I'm so worried brother Branham I just don't know let off the pressure Amen in the City of Refuge he took your worry so you don't have to have it cast your cares on him for we careth for you don't you worry about your cares that's his business [Music] in a world where submission is so often looked down upon and the world fights against the idea of being under submission and and having to do what someone else is telling them to do they tell everyone that your destiny is in your own hands you can do it all yourself you can pull yourself up by your bootstrap take all whatever cliched comment you want to come up with and go you can do it on your own you don't need anybody we as Christians are called to be under submission we're called to go against how the world wants to teach us we're called to go against what the world wants to do and say no we're supposed to be under submission and yes that means that the woman is under submission to her husband yes we're not preaching on that today so we're not worried about it the man's under submission to Christ we're in these places and when we're under submission there are these blessings that come with it and I only touched on three I only went into these three areas submission grants provision God will provide Jehovah Jireh God provides our needs submission and headship often grants Authority we know that Christ is the power but he's given us the authority the authority to tell Satan to leave the authority to tell the spirits not to be in our home the authority to send back the box of rattlesnakes and not accept it and that submission provides protection we don't have to deal with it the same way that my wife has every right to send someone to talk to me instead of her the same right that she has to step behind me and go he's my head you deal with him we have that same right we have the authority to handle it we have the authority to stand against what Satan's throwing at us but when we keep fighting and when we keep facing it over and over and we start to get a little tired and we start to get where maybe we can't quite stand on her anymore we have the right to say talk to my husband I can't fight so much anymore I've gotten tired I've been dealing with this battle for too long [Music] whether it's a disease we've been dealing with some physical malady or maybe it's something on the spiritual side that we've been struggling with and we can't seem to get past I have the authority but I also have the right to send it to my husband and say that's my headship you talk to him Satan you have to go through him to get to me [Music] submission is not a bad thing it's not something that like the world wants to put out there that is no we have to do it our own we have to be able to stand up and be strong and do all these different things it's okay to have a song leader that cries while he's up here to have a worship leader that's able to feel the leading of the Lord and let some tears out it's okay as men that we cry occasionally there's nothing wrong with this because we're allowed to be in submission or allowed to turn it over to our Heavenly Father to our husband to go Lord I I know you've given me the authority to handle it [Music] but I'm tired I'm worn out Satan has bothered me for so long that I don't feel that I can handle it but Lord I can turn it over to you and I can let you step in front and I can let you show yourself as the one Mighty in battle again you want to see a husband get riled up have someone mess with his wife a little bit you want to see the husband get mad at the kids have the kids upset mama then you'll see Daddy get upset more than normal it's like you could have the dad that's the most calm in the world but you get Mom upset suddenly dad's upset because that's my girl back there someone gets her upset that's not acceptable and if that's what I can do as an Earthly husband if that's how I want to react as an Earthly Fallen man how much more is Christ acting that way when Satan keeps going after his wife and keeps bothering her and keeps pressing her and getting her all worried and getting her all upset and getting her all stressed and getting her all worked up how much more does our Heavenly Father our Heavenly husband want to step in and go you got to get through me you have to talk to me now submission isn't a sign of weakness submission isn't a sign that we're less than what we should be which is how the world wants to portray it submission is part of our calling it's part of how we were created we were designed to worship we were designed to submit to our creator foreign to try to do it our own we weren't designed to follow after Lucifer to create my own kingdom we were designed to worship and submit to the Creator and so whatever each one of us is facing whatever trials we may be going through whatever concerns they are whatever worries or nagging at the back of our mind whether it's something in the Physical Realm with our bodies with our with sickness with finances with whatever it might be there's still the headship where God will give us provision God will give us Authority God will give us protection when we submit to him when we're willing to give up that desire to deal with it on our own when we're willing to surrender when we're willing to come and swear fealty and I don't know if y'all paid attention in the way as I was describing when someone would come to swear fealty they went down on their knees and they put their hands in front of them does this remind anyone of anything all of us have been in this position before at this altar or in our own places at home where we're in the exact same position before God and we're down and we're in the position of fealty and we're surrendering to him and we're saying Lord I just want to do what you want me to do I just want to follow your guiding I just want to follow your leading I'm willing to give up my desires to surrender to you [Music] and yes it's a two-way there's there's a give and take here we get blessings from it when we surrender when we submit when we give ourselves over there are blessings that we have access to [Music] but we don't do it for the blessings yes I love the blessings and yes I want them but I don't do it for that I do it because I'm in love with my creator and I want to please him and I want to give him what he wants and I'm yes I want him to help me overcome the things in my life that he doesn't like and I want to help him over help me overcome the things that are keeping me away from him I want to surrender and then God will take care of the rest brother Colby what are we singing [Music] let's all stand in worship for a moment [Music] and bow my knees and worship and your throne I need you Lord I need you Lord right now I don't know if there's anyone else that maybe maybe you need to take some time to to be down in prayer and be returning to that state of fealty with your creator maybe you've done it recently maybe you've been in your prayer closet and you've been there maybe you've been here at this Altar and done it recently but if it's been a while if there are things that have begun to crop up in your life the altar's open the Pew where your at's open the position [Music] a fealty is still available to us we're still able to come before him and surrender afresh and come in and go Lord maybe I made a mistake maybe I messed up somewhere but I can come back before you and I can confess I can bring it back unto your blood and you can take control again [Music] all right [Music] if my hair how my knees [Music] thank you I need you Lord I need you Lord right right now [Music] I need you Lord I need you Lord right now [Music] I lift my hands thou my knees worship your throne I need you I need you [Music] my life is not my own to you I

minister I'm not responsible for cleaning anybody up I'm not responsible for for anyone I can't make you a Christian I can't I can't keep you out my responsibility amen my authority is in the word and to preach that word if you choose not to follow it that's between you and him I still get paid the same from him at the end of the day can you say Amen I just want to make sure that I'm pleasing to him is that right and that's the way we do it with one another at the Apostle Paul was telling I believe the colossian church he's telling he's when you serve when you're when you're under the authority of your boss he said don't do it as men Pleasers do it as unto the Lord then it doesn't matter doesn't matter what goes on and what you're going to get paid from him at the end of the day just serve him Oh Glory to God so it takes the loan off of you when you just simply say Lord I want to be submissive to you I want to be submissive just want to follow him and Lord Give Me a Heart a
