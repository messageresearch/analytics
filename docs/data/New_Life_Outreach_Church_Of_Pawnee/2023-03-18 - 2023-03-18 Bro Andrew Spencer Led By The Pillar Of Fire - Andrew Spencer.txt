too uncomfortable this morning maybe a brother to a brother or sister to a sister would come here today to give praise to the Lord of all I know that there's needs that are still amongst us we saw so many victories last night we are needy people but he's the god that supplies and we are told by science that when we lay our hands upon one another that there is a light that transfers and I believe that we are carriers of the pillar of fire and maybe you just lay your hands over on your brother not just praying for yourself just now praying for your brother your sister there let's go to the father in prayer Heavenly Father what a privilege it is Lord for us as your children Lord to be gathered one more time here under the opening of the word father or to recognize that we are not just a people but Lord we've been ordained to Stand Here In This Moment Lord it's your spirit that has drawn us to your father and we recognize that it's you that is calling upon your children today Lord to lift up their hands father to recognize that they have a need and they recognize that you are God that can supply all of their needs Lord Jesus science tells us that we shouldn't even be able to lift our hands but we have defied gravity this morning by lifting our hands to the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob but you're not just their God you're our God this morning and Lord we lift our hands and surrender and we say father come and take us and make us to be what you'd have us to be father Lord we are looking unto you the author and the finisher of our faith this morning I pray Lord that the mighty Angel would Lord wrap his arms around me Father Lord strengthen this vessel father of clay that you would use it for the glory of the Lord Lord I sense a great outpouring of your spirit father here today and I ask Lord that you would move aside every little skeptic of unbelief father every little chain of doubt and you would begin to move in Father Lord right now I pray that you would allow these sixth sense to go to work father Lord that we would get in tune father with the supernatural right now and that you'd come and move in this place today Lord where are your children and we love you so we give you Praise In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ [Music] a man if you have your Bibles this morning we'd like to look over into a couple places in the Bible over in the book of Exodus chapter 13. Exodus chapter 13 and verse 21 and we certainly enjoyed being in the presence of the Lord last night and watching watching the angel of the Lord begin to move in this place and I just counter the privilege to be standing here we again want to say thank you to brother Wendell and and the church for inviting us to be a part of these meetings and and to be here standing with my buddy brother Andrew it's it's real honor and and uh we've been friends for quite some time and we're going to be friends for quite a long time I don't plan on running out of a friendship with him we're going to spend eternity together amen amen Exodus chapter 13 and verse 21 and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by not in the pillar of fire to give them light and to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people Romans chapter 8 and verse 11. Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 and as you're as you're turning there this morning I'd like to I'd like to read a portion of a quote the Branham speaks here and in the message absolute he said now you see we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity because each one of us holding a part of God and we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness in the fullness of it when his church sets together in Heavenly places then the fullness of the power of God is in his church then the fullness of the power of God is in his church not when we're divided but when we come together in unity each one of us is holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that Pillar of Fire back again Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord and today by the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you on a thought of lead by the pillar of fire led by the pillar of fire brother Brandon said he said one of the greatest things that I found in Christian Life is letting the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you one of the greatest things in life is seeing to let the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you and here is the prophet of the age a prophet messenger that has come and has seen so many mighty miracles vehicles that has transpired and things that have happened but he said the greatest thing that I've found in Christian life is to be led by the Holy Spirit and we know that he is the one that has led us here to this Camp he it was not nobody here that drugged you here but it was the very Spirit of the Living God that has led you under this camp and we recognize that that the message that we are under that it makes us a prophetic class of people that we have recognized that it is his doing that is brought about the works of Christ that is that has led us here and we recognize that that we are not just a people but we've been ordained and so being ordained it makes us sensitive to the power of the Holy Ghost and it's a very powerful thing to recognize and to to witness that the Holy Spirit wants to lead you and he wants to guide you throughout all of your life and all of your good times he wants to lead you in all of your bad times he wants to lead you and he'll be there with you as the Bible said that I'll never leave you and I will never forsake you you and we recognize that even this morning that the pillar of fire is in the building this morning we recognize that Jesus said that where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them so he is here today he is leading you in worship he is leading you in Praise he is leading you in to be able to say Amen to the word of God he's LED you here every energy here that will be that will be exposed today or be to to be to be released it will be by the leadership of the Holy Ghost I believe that I believe that if if it's if it's that easy for men to be able to work us up then we ought to be able to go down to Walmart and work everybody up down there but it is it's not that but it's the leadership of the Holy Ghost that is leading the children of God to respond to the word of God it's a deed that is calling to the Deep he's the one that has brought us here he's a god that'll take us all the way through he was God when he was back there with the children of Israel when they had journeyed for 40 years and they'd wandered around that mountain and they they wandered around but you know that the Bible said the Bible tells us that they never had the shoes never worn out they never had to go to another department store to buy new shoes or to get a little medicine bag to find out if they could find Healing down there at the pharmacy but they had one scripture that I am the Lord thy God that healeth thee and you know Moses didn't have nothing to do with that it wasn't the man that had anything to do with it it was the angel of the Lord that was leading them that was taking care of them so young people I want you to I want you to recognize that that same Angel is in the room today he's still leading the children of God right here right now and he's not ashamed to work in this place it doesn't matter how you came into this Camp he's not ashamed of where you came in at but he knows exactly how you're going to leave and I'll say this that the holy spirit is the god that is going to lead you out of this camp and I want you to know you're going to be an overcomer you're going to be a winner you're not going to be a Survivor but you're going to be an overcomer you're going to be able to make it you're going to be able to go all the way through you're going in the Rapture because the pillar of fire is here to lead you all the way because we are not under the leadership of a man we are under the influence of the mighty Angel it is his effect of this message that has transpired our life to where we are it is not Ron Spencer that has called us it's not Wendell Martin that has called us it's not Tim Pruitt that has called us it's not Joseph Branham that has called us it's not some of these other great men out there it's the power of the Holy Ghost that has brought us under the message if it was that easy Hallelujah that anybody could come but because God deposited a gene seed of God on the inside of the elect of God is the reason why that you feel the call on your life to be led by the Holy Spirit you see you are being led by a mighty a mighty conqueror that has never lost a battle I want you to know his record is perfect this morning he's never lost one of his children he's never one law he's never lost one fight he's never lost one battle he has a perfect record today I know there's a lot of people that are upset at March Madness today because their back brackets got busted but I want you to know God's bracket has never been busted when he scored the greatest touchdown or the greatest goal that there was two thousand years ago he's still the reigning Champion today he's a champion of Life he's the champion of the supernatural he's here to prove himself alive in the Church of the Living God we are here and we are being led by the church we are being led by Mighty conqueror it has been said that an army of sheep led by a lion will always defeat an army of lions that is led by a sheep you see it matters who you're being led by you see you are not led by some weak little wimpy cat today but you are being led by the lion of the tribe of Judah and when William Branham he come and preached the eagle as the eagle stirs its nest he said you are kin to the lion of tribe of Judah you have a Stern this you have a bravery you have a tenacity you have a firmness in the Church of the Living God there is no backing down in the Church of the Living God when the pillar of fire got angry and he looked at the Red Sea and he opened up the Red Sea that same pillar fire is looking over your life and he's pushing sin back he's pushing depression back and I want you to know there is no circumstance that can stand in front of the pillar fire is here to lead the Church of the Living God ain't no wonder Moses could stand out there as a man and it can lead 2 million right out there in the face of opposition it was because Jehovah's leading and if Jehovah was leading then brother Nathan he's leading right now he led them right out there knowing knowing that Jehovah was the one that was leading them you see they had Joseph's bones they had Joseph's bones but they needed a fresh scene of what God was it was more than just working on the bones of a prophet and said we're going to go out of here but they needed to see the supernatural for themselves let me tell you it's not enough for the supernatural just to dwell in William branham's Ministry in his personal Ministry you've got to have the supernatural you've got to have the Holy Ghost you need to see miracles happen you'll say brother Andrew I've never seen a miracle in my life have you got the new birth it's the greatest miracle that there ever has been or ever will be we can have healing demonstrations or manifestations eyes being opened the ears being opened but the greatest miracle that there is a new birth you know brother banham said he said that same star that led the wise men up there to baby Jesus it's the same one that is leading you to the new birth right now he's not leading you into destruction he's not leading you into defeat he's not leading you into something that he can't get you out of he is leading you into something that'll grow you give you a greater Victory and a greater glory and when God gets done with your life young people you can expect greatness in your life you can expect miracles in your life you can expect the supernatural in your life you're being led by the Holy Ghost and he's here to take you Hallelujah now notice what brother random says he said he said we know that the angel that let Moses was the angel of the Covenant which was Christ the son of God he said or the logos that came out of God was the son of God he said God delivered the children of Israel when they were in bondage and he couldn't help themselves he said but today God's people are not in bondage you hear what I'm talking to you today God's people are not in bonded spiritually for they are delivered by the Holy Ghost come on wake the devil up tell him you're not in bondage you're not in fear you're not in depression you are delivered by the power of the Holy Ghost and there is no chain that can hold you back from being the potential as a son and daughter of God there is nothing that is too great for my Jehovah he knows how to destroy the Red Sea he knows how to destroy Pharaoh you're not in the bonded spiritually I'll tell you the same one that led Peter out of the prison is the same one that is here and is leading his children he's breaking every shackle he's breaking every fear he's breaking every little cycle of humanity that's been in your life the holy spirit is here to lead you out of the prison cell wake up wake up Peter wake up it's time to Mark it's time to walk out of here oh I say oh God let God arise and let his enemies be scattered Hallelujah it's time that you wake up because there have been prayer that's made up you made up for you upper and John Marsh house you were down here in Camp you thought that you were down here all alone but there was prayer made a prayer for you you didn't walk into this Camp alone there's prayers over your life and they are not going to be unanswered they are going to be answered it might shock you when the answer gets coming to your way but there is a prayer that is going to be answered and brother random said in the Sixth Sense he said all of them prayers had accumulated itself around that Jail's hell where Peter was and the angel the angel slipped into the window he slipped into the window and he tapped Peter on the side and said wake up wake up young people wake up the seven Thunders had uttered their voices and we are woken that the lamb is amongst us [Applause] Hallelujah he's slipping through these doors he's so powerful he can slip through those doors he can slip through that wall he can slip through your idea he can slip through your barriers he's still Jehovah he ain't changed he's still the same yesterday today and forever come on now wake up come on now we're living in a generation that say they woke up they're living up they're waking up to things that they they thought was bad or things things that they shouldn't have done but the Bride of Jesus Christ has been awoken since 1963 when God revealed the seals you're not a sleeping virgin you woke up to the fact that the son of man is manifested in the bride's body and I challenge you to believe it thank you I challenge you to believe that whatever you have need of is in this God's body you ask for the supernatural receive the supernatural you ask for a miracle receive a miracle Hallelujah he's in this place he has everything you have need of when Moses met him up there in a burning bush he had everything he had everything that Moses was lacking and everything that you are lacking young people the New Birth has for you you say I can't make it on my own let me tell you he can let me tell you I know what it's like to be hung out and strung out on drugs I know what it's like to be at the end of a bottle and I know what it's like when he comes and wakes you up let me tell you when God goes to waking you up when brother Bynum preaches the prodigal in 1950 he said that angel went down there the angel went down there and woke him up well wake up wake up you are no longer a prodigal no more you've been ordained to be in the father's house Father's House of Liberty a father's house of worship for there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit I want you to say it out loud there ain't no chains on me there ain't no condemnation on me there is no sin on me the blood is pardon me [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah you're being led by a pillar of fire and there's a major difference between a pill or fire and a pillar of salt at Sea what the difference is is which way you turn to it I have turned my eyes towards Jesus let me tell you the pillar of fire is not something that we just talked about with our imagination that we say he's in the room he's here foreign you to believe that he's here he's here it ain't the second person in the Trinity it ain't the third person it is Elohim and Elohim has made his say his way back into the bride's body again she has the same characteristics as he had If he if we're going to be identified with anything we're going to be identified with the characteristics of Jehovah if Moses recognized him as the characteristics of the Voice who spoke to Abraham he recognized that the same character that was speaking to him at that burning bush he was more than able to make a son of man Invasion down there in Egypt and get all of his children out I say that the son of man is making an invasion into this camp the Lord's working in this place and when the word goes to work it there ain't nothing going to stop the word Creeds can't stop it theologians can't stop it ideas can't stop it the Lord is here for you young people what takes a man of God off of his notes what takes a man of God to come down and work through your 1010 alley it's the spirit of the Living God that is working in you let me tell you he knew where eunuch was one time and the angel directed he directed Philip over there the angel was the one that was directing it but the gene seed of God the germ had to come through the body he couldn't come to the angel the Angels here this morning the anointing is here this morning but he's working through my body to bring you to the realization that you don't need no theology you don't need no education you don't need some work up all you need is what the angel has the angel is depositing on the inside of you what God ordained you to believe let me tell you I've been a follower of this Pillar of Fire for many years now and he's never left me wrong he's never let me down a case where he led me to a spot that I was going to lose the battle he's always rose up as the mighty conqueror he's in these brothers he's in these sisters and he's working the works of discernment right now it's right here he's moving mother Madam said he said if you want to see what that angel looked like he said because in Exodus 23 he said behold I'll send an angel before thee to keep you in the way he said if you want to see what that angel looked like he said you look over in Exodus 13 and 21 he said and the Lord went before them this is what the angel looks like the Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud to lead them in the way by night in the pillar of fire to give them light and to go by day and night and he took not away the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people and to think that you're living in the greatest day that there ever has been that science has had to testify that the pillar of fire is back over the body of Jesus Christ let me tell you something you look at that picture in Houston got the Houston column see him and if all you see is William Branham you are missing the picture the great one in that picture is our Lord Jesus Christ in his Revelations 10 1 over top of Revelations 10 7 and he is sending out a voice eat the book take the book don't let it destroy you it'll make you strong it'll make you a soldier it'll make your wall light and you have been elected to tear down every stronghold every demon of depression I want you to shout out what you've been dealing with well don't be scared of it don't you recognize that what you've been dealing with is to feed it right here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come on young people today's your day of Liberty [Applause] let me tell you Camp's about to be camping this place you're about to break down every stronghold the pillar of fire is working through here come out of your jail cell come on ouch no friends I got a friend depression I am not oppressed suicide I don't even know your name but I know the name for the pillar fire and it is my Lord Jesus Christ he's working here today he's working in his body to show himself alive don't you be afraid to worship him you're not worse than worshiping some weak God you're worshiping the god of Heaven [Applause] he ain't gonna let you down he ain't gonna back off of his promises he never has and he never will he's still the same yeah if William Bynum would take Hebrews 13 and 8 and tell us that he's the same yesterday today and forever over 3 100 times I believe the prophet was trying to send us a message that the same yard that was in William Graham is the same God that's in Andrew Clover the same God it's in Matthew mcclart he's the same God that's in Joshua Martin it's a saying God in Jordan Roberts said it's a saying God in brother green he's just saying God In The Pruitts he's just saying God in the Spencers [Applause] he's gone he ain't lost the battle it's time it's time to come out you see they were never called The Church of God until they came out because that's what the church means it means the called out they were always known as Israelites they were living down there in Egypt but now we are living in another Ephesians it's a time of coming out of and going into what did they come out of they come out of bondage and they went into their Liberty what is this message about today it's to bring you out of your bondage and to bring you into your Liberty let me tell you your Liberty is in the room [Applause] when those Brothers when those men those Warriors had come back across the sea and they got up there in New York and they looked out there and they seen the Statue of Liberty they began to cry they begin to weep because it was a sign of the freedom was on the other side of that Statue of Liberty the pillar of fire is in the room and it's a sign that your future is clear your Liberty is here [Applause] your Liberty is here what about it Joe he's the god of your future if he was God of your past he's a god of your Liberty Hallelujah God ain't looking for your Mechanical Devices he's looking for a live body somebody that'll leave out his message if all he wanted was tape players we'd have went in a Rapture in 1965. but God is running live vessels somebody to shake the hell shake the kingdoms of Hell live voices powerful anointing under the greatest message that there ever has been [Applause] he ain't wanting your mechanics he's wanting you to get the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost and it's greater than all your fears it's greater than all your tears it's greater than crying all night long he's everything that you have need of in this life's journey he'll be your everything he swore to you that he before you he gave you a promise that this land is your land he said it's not just for your mamas and daddies but God's raising up a new generation come on somebody you know where you're living at you're in a Joshua Commission you're under the greatest commission that there ever was it's time to go into your Fallen Heritage you are fully adopted as Sons and Daughters of God to walk in there and take your Liberty and tell the amarats to get out tell the jebusites to get out brother Nathan I heard the prophet say that there as soon as God made a promise to Abraham for 660 to 685 years they're the amarats he said since that time the amorites went in there the jebusites went in there to go in there and take over that land 660 years they'd went over there since the time they heard the promise you know the devil's real close wherever the word at Satan wherever the word's at Satan's real close so he's hearing what is happening right here now brother Brandon would say he said he would say in one place he said now Satan can't know what's in my heart he said but as soon as I speak it he said then he'll go to work but you know there's something in my heart that is burning right here today that's 660 years they went out there to work but it only took Joshua it only took Joshua seven days to go into Jericho and overthrow it and the devil that's been working against your family history for six thousand years our great Jehovah is here to lead you out of your trouble freedom it's a wonderful thing [Applause] Freedom's a wonderful thing there's one thing God hates it's a powerless religion and if you ain't got no blood on your sacrifice you have a powerless religion but today we have the greatest message that there is we are covered by the blood of the Lamb there is still Mercy On The Mercy Seat it doesn't matter how far you are out in sin the pillar of fire has been searching for you you may have thought well I'm just going about my life and going about my business the pillar of fire has been hunting for you he's been hunting for you and you thought that you were just coming for a crumb but the angel has everything that you have need of he's everything that you want in life he's everything that you have need of the Angels here William Brandon would say that one since I've that I've watched ever since I was a little bitty child he said his standing no further than two feet away from you you see if you want angels to appear to you you've got to keep your mind on them is that right that's what Mary was doing she had her mind on them scriptures she had a mind on them angels she got to thinking about that virgin that was going to rise up in a scene and in a certain season she began to think on him and the angel appeared to him the Bible said in John 1 and 11 that Zacharias was up there offering incense at the temple he was up there doing what he was called to do he's brother random said he said if you want angels to appear to you get your house in order like zachariah's house was in order he was up there to worshiping God and the angel appeared on the right side of the Altar and when William Branham was standing there and he's going through those scriptures he's looking into those things he looks over and he begins to think about all of the things that is happening he said that's why I bring those prayer lines up there on my right side he said because that's where the angel stands I happen to say this to you that I believe that the great angel of Gabriel has come to give us a message not to leave us where we are let me tell you if theologians could have done it the Unicorn had got it when he was up there in Jerusalem if theologians could have done it they'd have gotten a prayer when he was up there and wore it when he was up there in worship but he had to come down there where the message was at that there was a holy ghost after being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the word worked its way out the word is working its way out right here this morning and you know that God has given you a promise that I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll give you the same holy ghost that was back there in Paul's day it's the same Holy Ghost right now and if Paul could get it you can kid it if Caleb could get it you can get it if Colby could get it you can get it if Andrew can get it you can get it and shaken is here listening to these things this morning and he's trying to keep you from your promises and saying you've got to wait for another day when Satan hears about you getting ready to possess new land of healing of blessings and deliverance he will try to move in there and occupy and keep you away from your blessings but the angel is here to make sure that you get your visitation he ain't worried about how old you are ain't worried about how sick you are if he was able to get to say right 90 years old surely he can get to a 15 year old girl foreign you know what it's like you know what it's like to be in the presence of the Angel and the angel says he's coming by your house tonight you know what it's like when all the things that you've been fearing about the things that you've been asking about all of a sudden he comes by your house and your house is completely different he made it one way he made it perfect one time he's in the way of making it perfect again fear is over depression is over the things that hunt you in your nighttime they're over it's over welcome back to a new family the angel is working in the neighborhood and if you can make tumors drop off if you can make gallbladders or make make different things fall off the Angels working in here this is that that was prophesied by the prophet troll that in the last days I pour out my spirit and when he poured out in Acts 2 is what he's pouring out right now I pray that there comes such Assurance of the Holy Ghost let me tell you young people you are on the verge of the greatest move that you've ever seen he's still moving he's still working he's still making ways go ahead and back off me devil give me enough room here to work today you can't hold them no longer they're God's children you can't hold them back [Applause] you may have held him back before they got in this presence but they are in the presence of one that ain't scared of you devil you can try to threaten them with all kinds of ideas that you're only going to go so far and it's only going to be a camp experience but what Moses got he walked away from there completely changed and what you are experiencing you're in the atmosphere of the Angel of the Lord if we could walk out there it could walk out there and say what are you hunting for those things were sovereignly given if you could walk out there on Colorado Mountain and he could bring peace to a storm if you could walk out there and know that media Branham had those tumors on her body and said before the doctor ever touches her what was it it was an angel that was speaking to the prophet say the words young people when we get back into speaking conditions again the Eden will return and where we are I'm not trying to tell you something that's far off this bride is in speaking conditions she speaks what the father says she's in Perfect Harmony I'm not looking for making you to look for some pie in the sky the Bible says in First John 3 and 2 that now are we the sons of God and if we are right now we have the abilities of the father I know where I'm at like an abstract I gotta write to these young people come on now you can go ahead and get nervous homie devil because you're gonna lose this battle I've got an abstract for them the token's already here they are God's children Satan take your leave in the name of Jesus Christ every fear every anxiety every depression the pillar of fire is working in this place yeah I'm trying to make you aware that the same Pillar of Fire that showed up with William Branham is in this room right now you've been wanting to see him take a look around come on now take a look around he's circling in the building right now he's the one that's leading these words he's the one that's leading this message he's the one that's controlling this atmosphere if he wasn't that kind of a god you'd have never got in the building Satan would have made to go he'd have made you sick but because the Angel's been circling the camp [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord if I was a preacher or if I was if I was an atomatic person I'd climb them shingles I'd climb on top of that thing I'd shouted from the rooftops he's still alive yeah come on somebody we are here to shake the kingdom of hell so let's raise the roof let's shake the rafters let's shake down the stalactite to Hell drop them in the devil's eye we are the Victorious bride of Jesus Christ [Applause] I'm taking you somewhere [Applause] foreign he's working right here it wasn't the water that healed the people when they got in the water it was the angel on the water I want to tell you he's working in here he's working in here how do you know that he's working in here I'm watching the moving of the water right now and if you study out the Bible Waters representing Waters represent people and I'm watching it the water is rolling backwards it's a supernatural move of the Holy Ghost he's whirling in here so I know that the Angels here you'll never raise your hand you don't never danced in the spirit you'd have never spoke in tongues but because the Angels won the water that's right ain't it [Applause] suppose them children looking on back there when them serpents came in and bit them we went up there and looked at that Brazen that Brazen serpent on that pole what was they looking at it wasn't the pole but it was the angel on the pole what was it it's like this if you would take a break up go to a bank president and said now I want you to know that there is a there is an account that is coming open it's coming open in 2000 years and there's going to be a large deposit or in 2000 years upon upon this account and I want to withdraw I want to draw interest on that account that bank president would say you're absolutely crazy there ain't nothing to draw from but because God is the greatest Banker that there ever has been he looked into the bank of heaven and he knew that the Son of God was slain before the foundation of the world so he was able to draw interest and the angel was looking at a full atonement that the price had already been paid if they were looking at it that sin had already been judged what about it young people your sin is judged the perfect lamb took your spot come on get out of there Paul you ain't supposed to be in the prison you're supposed to be out there preaching a message [Applause] it's gonna shock you when he comes he'll shock you when he comes Zechariah and his wife have been praying for a baby been praying for a baby but when the angel showed up it shocked him so much that he'd forgot about his prayers mother Burnham said he said when God goes answering your prayers he said it's going to scare you to death he said but it's everything that you've prayed about all this time that that God is answering your prayers right now and I ain't going to preach it till you recognize it I ain't gonna keep giving my voice to you until you fully accept what I'm talking about right now you're free I can tell you that you're free I can tell you that you can walk out of the prison door I can tell you that the chains are rough are your feet I can tell you all those things but you got to be the one to walk out of it you got to be the one to say I'm going to overcome I'm going to walk out of my sickness I'm gonna walk out of my pain I'm gonna walk out of my home condition I'm going to walk out of abuse I'm going to walk out of an oppression situation I'm gonna walk out of I'm gonna walk out of a condition that makes me claustrophobic and I can't dance away my victory I can't dance away all of the things in my life I'm going to walk out of it [Applause] I'm gonna walk out of fear I'm gonna walk out of it I'm gonna walk out of it I'm gonna walk out of family problems let me tell you what I did last night I took a Spencer family into a supernatural realm and I believed that cancer is defeated at the cross 2000 years ago it would do me no good to preach to you today that cancer is defeated if it wasn't all ready to feed it if Jesus didn't already say the wrong Spencer was healed I wouldn't stand up here and testify about it but because I understand by the books [Applause] come on now come on you're right on the verge of it you feel it in this place you feel it working why don't you walk out of that to me one of the greatest preachers that's ever walked in shoe Leathers Tim Pruitt but he had a daddy that told him he'd never amount to anything I had friends that tell me that I'd never amount to anything it does not matter what people say about you let me tell you I could give a care in the world I want the critics got to say they ain't never done anything good for me so why should I ever listen to a voice of a Critic let me tell you something young people we have come too far to start listening to the voice of our critics when we ought to be listening to the voice of the mighty angel that has told us that there has been a release of the supernatural in this place he said I am he that liveth and wants death I have the keys of death Hell In The Grave I have the keys to your joy I have the keys to your peace I have the keys to your oppression I have the keys I have the keys to unlock the supernatural I am the keys to unlock the natural and if you can unlock the natural it can unlock the supernatural the keys are hung in the door I've given you the Keys of the Kingdom shake it down walk out of here well blessed be the name of the Lord somebody said Hallelujah I'm walking out of it I'm free I'm saved I'm delivered I'm an overcomer I'm gonna make it I'm Healed [Applause] I'm Healed no Devil's got no hold on me and knows how to speak don't he brother Nathan when it's impossible the angel knows how to make the impossible possible who they didn't look like another child was coming by your way the father opened it up and nobody can sing it like you can laughs nobody can sing you don't know like I know when you're the one that knows how about it arthritis ain't got no hold on you he can get in your back he can walk around your body it can go to working in there and make you stiff but when the angel goes to working that's going to become a flexibility to your back pain [Applause] ain't nothing too hard for my God how many has been healed in this place before how many knows the power of Resurrection how many notes of power being saved in this place then you can shout you don't know like I know and you may not understand why this person is dancing the way that their person they're dancing you may not understand the reason why they're shouting like they're shouting but if you were standing in the shoes that they were standing in if you walk to mile in their shoes you'd understand this Shout if you was locked up like I was locked up you'd understand the power of the key being turned over yourself when the angel walked in and let you out foreign and he's changing his mass that same pillar fire that Paul met is heard today [Applause] what is it it's our same Lord Jesus Christ working in the bride's body he emptied himself out he poured himself into the Church of the Living God and in the last days this Third Exodus is when the pillar fire takes the bride from the church we're not a part of a denomination we're not a part of some move of 60 years ago we're a move of right now [Applause] we're right here on the greatest return that there ever has been the return of the power of Pentecost I ain't talking about some movement that happened in 1906 we're not even part of a movement of man this is a move of the Holy Ghost you have been restored to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers your heart has been turned back you know where you're standing at you could not have got here unless the message Led you here you could have never come to this knowledge unless the father LED you to this knowledge but because he loved you he gave you the greatest weapon that there ever has been he equipped you with the word of God to defeat every devil that you ever come up against he's not going to leave you powerless today Church you are under you are under a mighty move for the pillar fire that's shame anointing we're not just her and under an Acts 2 anointing we are under a Revelations 10 anointing it's a bar anointing we have a double witness that the words that I do shall you do also a greater works for me see how you do because I go into my father it's the same spirit it's the father spirit it's the father's life it's the father's will thank you Abram knew who he was talking to when he come to his tent door he knew who he was talking to it was the same voice that had led him all the way about his life he told him about his failures told him about where he come out of him and the voice that was talking to him had his back turned to the tent what was it brother Branham said he said if that Melchizedek ever was he's got to still be he said now I'm going to turn my back to the tent like Abraham like Melchizedek did what was it it was full proof that the same angel that Abraham was fellowshipping with was the same one that you are fellowshipping with he said now he said now I can't see you but I see you sitting back there in that red checkered shirt I see you back there you're dealing with this certain case you're dealing with that I see I see there's a doctor that's working over your case and it doesn't look like it's going to bring any there is no hope but our same Lord Jesus that was fellowshipping with Abraham is here to tell you that thus saith the Lord you're already healed what we said what was it it was the same Melchizedek fellowshipping right here and he's come to vindicate the word of God let me tell you the reason why I can preach to you that if you'll repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost is because the Bible is backing me up the reason why I can tell you that you can get the Holy Ghost the reason why I can tell you that Isaiah 53 is still in effect the reason why I can tell you that Jesus Christ is alive is because the gospels are backing us up it is the framework to the Pentecostal blessing and what is the Pentecostal blessing it's a confirmation of the Resurrection that Jesus Christ is alive and well and you've been restored back to full power full Authority you are here you're here for such a time as this [Applause] what is it Satan knows that it's being identified in the body right now he knows what's happening I brought you to this moment right here because William Branham said in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said that's why the devil's howling it's being identified in your body it's right here being identified in your body your hands shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now if it breaks out sin breaks out then you know what's going to happen at a certain time but if you laid your hands on a certain need and you believed it with all of your heart you can lay hands on autism and they shall be recovered you can lay hands on the sick and they shall be delivered you can take up serpents and it shall not harm you you shall drink any deadly thing and it shall not harm you you shall speak in unknown tongues come on don't you be afraid of it these gifts are in the body a gift of knowledge a gift of faith a gift of Grace a gift of speaking in tongues a gift of Prophecy and if it was restored that it's here in the bride's body don't you be afraid of the Pentecostal blessing don't you be afraid of the moving of the Holy Ghost [Applause] thank you William by him said in Oneness of unity he said I believe in conservatives he said I believe in being conservative he said it brings about a spirit of superstition though he said break he said God I pray that you loosen up this crowd loosen up this crowd don't you sit back there and be conservative no more Let the Holy Ghost loose in this place holding back give it all give everything you got I pray that there come another Mighty Russian wind in this place let there be another outpouring [Applause] another act true experience where they gotta open up the doors and let them out let it come in this place let it rain on the gene seed of God let the Holy Ghost fall let the Holy Ghost move well I don't know if I can't let me tell you the one that's walking with you I don't know if I really can let me tell you who you're walking with you are walking with the greatest dancing partner that there ever has been let me tell you the angel knows how to dance the angel knows how to heal the angel knows how to work and you are walking with our Lord Jesus Christ it is the pillar fire is our Lord Jesus Christ he has returned back to the Church of the Living God ain't power that was poured out come on now come on now you're about her long enough with it come on come out of it he battled long enough of not being good enough part of that could only realize your everything he's looking for God's
