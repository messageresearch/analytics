[8:22] Satan [music] attacking your people. And

[8:59] life is always a great thing. And we're
[9:01] so appreciative of you giving it to us,
[9:03] Lord. [music] And Lord, we ask you to
[9:05] take the remainder of this service, the
[9:06] songs, and the worship and the

[29:51] are going to be songs that you probably
[29:52] never heard before. So maybe if we go
[29:55] through it once and then pick up or
[29:57] something, but uh we'll try this. And um
[30:02] I was supposed to have a cape of it. Um
[30:05] somebody didn't bring it. And I'm not a
[30:07] guitar player.
[30:09] I'm not a guitar player, so pardon me.

[30:33] He counts stars [singing]
[30:36] and all. He knows How much sand is on
[30:40] the shore? Sees [singing] every sparrow
[30:44] that falls.
[30:51] The [singing] mountains and seas
[30:54] in [singing]
[30:59] all creatures great and
[31:02] [singing and music] small.
[31:04] And he knows my name.
[31:08] Every [singing and music] step that I
[31:10] take.
[31:12] Every [singing] move that I make,
[31:17] every tear that I [singing] cry,
[31:22] he [music] knows my name. I'm [singing]
[31:26] overwhelmed by the pain.

[31:37] fine.
[31:39] He knows [singing]

[31:56] I don't know [music] a lot of things.
[32:04] I don't have all [singing] the answers
[32:07] to the [music] questions of life,
[32:09] [singing]

[33:17] [applause]
[33:24] I got to take a minute. This is not
[33:26] working. [clears throat]
[33:34] Nothing like listening to somebody tune.
[33:57] Battle scars and bruises they hardly
[34:00] count as cost. As victors fist the
[34:03] spoils the enemy has lost. Lifeless foes
[34:08] lay scattered on the cold and stony
[34:10] ground.

[34:38] Jesus, [music and singing] victorious
[34:41] king.
[34:46] The fog of war can sometimes make it
[34:49] hard to see, but faith will guide
[34:52] through darkness and lead to victory.
[34:55] Take courage in the battle. Don't mind
[34:58] the temptor's bar.
[35:01] Hold steadfast to the promise and
[35:04] [music] press on through the dark.
[35:05] [singing]
[35:07] Oh, look up. Redemption draweth nigh.
[35:11] [music]

[36:28] armor in righteous robes. We'll sing
[36:33] forever [music] praises to the Lord.
[36:36] He's Jesus, victorious
[36:39] king. We'll lay down [singing] our
[36:42] battle [music] armor and righteous robes
[36:44] will sing.
[36:48] Forever praises to the Lord. He's Jesus,
[36:52] victorious [music]
[36:54] king. [singing]
[37:02] [applause]
[37:06] That was supposed to be higher. That's
[37:08] why I needed the capo. But [laughter]

[50:26] has come and his wife has made herself
[50:31] ready. Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[50:33] Father, we just want to say thank you
[50:36] today for your goodness and your
[50:38] blessings.
[50:40] Lord, as as we um enjoyed the song
[50:44] service and enjoyed the specials, Lord,
[50:47] and and Father, we want you to to be
[50:52] everything to us. We want you to be
[50:54] expressed through us. And we just ask,
[50:57] Lord, that you would be here in a real
[50:59] special way this morning.
[51:02] Lord, I pray that you'd meet every need
[51:04] that is here. Lord, we know that you
[51:07] It's not in numbers. It's not in it's
[51:11] not in our efforts. It's in your
[51:13] presence. And Father, we want to yield
[51:16] ourselves to you this morning. Both the
[51:18] speaker and the hearer. And Lord God, I
[51:22] pray that the presence of your spirit,
[51:26] Lord, would would so touch hearts and
[51:29] lives both present and online, Father.
[51:33] And we'll give you glory and honor in
[51:36] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can
[51:38] the church say amen?
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[51:43] seated here today. Amen. So we um
[51:48] uh I'm wanting to just continue my
[51:51] thought. I guess um from from this last
[51:55] week and um I know uh last week was sort
[51:59] of a a strange Christmas message
[52:03] um but yet that's the that is the
[52:05] message. Amen. And that's God becoming
[52:09] flesh and the the word uh being made
[52:13] flesh, the eternal God. Amen. Becoming a
[52:16] man. And um so we we sort of dealt last
[52:21] week with Amen. Uh and just giving just
[52:25] laying in the scriptures. Amen. That
[52:28] that he Christ is not uh a second person
[52:33] of the Godhead, but Christ is God.
[52:37] Amen. He is God. He is um he is every
[52:41] bit. Amen. There is uh God created a
[52:47] body and God uh moved into that body.
[52:52] And and if you don't understand the
[52:54] Godhead the way that you should
[52:57] understand the Godhead, then you're not
[52:58] going to really truly catch the the real
[53:02] beauty of redemption. And so we talked
[53:05] about this Christ child. And last week
[53:07] we had asked, "Amen. Who is this
[53:10] mysterious child?" Amen. He was God in
[53:15] the flesh.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Now, Amen. Brother Brandham would tell
[53:19] us about a dream that he had had is, you
[53:22] know, his supposed mother being beat by
[53:24] his supposed father. Neither of them
[53:27] were his natural mom and dad, but Amen.
[53:31] Uh and and you know it had a uh this
[53:34] this man had a three- cornered stick and
[53:36] he was taking her by the hair of the
[53:38] head and just beating her down with it.
[53:40] And every time she had tried to rise
[53:42] back up, he had beat her back down. And
[53:45] &gt;&gt; and and um Amen. and and he would say
[53:49] that the that the church being beat down
[53:51] by trinitarianism
[53:54] &gt;&gt; and and and you know if you separate the
[53:57] one true God into three different uh
[54:02] gods, you miss the actual um reality of
[54:08] revelation of Jesus Christ because Jesus
[54:11] uh becoming was God becoming tangible.
[54:14] Amen. He come in order to redeem his
[54:18] germ thoughts. He come to express
[54:22] himself upon earth. And and so Amen. You
[54:26] you you you can only reflect God and and
[54:30] and and give yourself to God as you
[54:34] understand the real revelation of your
[54:37] salvation. You've got to understand the
[54:40] real revelation of of why you've been
[54:44] saved. And and so, Brother Brandham, the
[54:47] the as soon as he had woke up from the
[54:50] dream, the presence of the Lord come
[54:52] into the room and and and revealed to
[54:54] him the the the interpretation. And he
[54:57] said, "The woman represents the church
[54:59] of the world today. And I was born right
[55:02] into this mess, the mess that she's in.
[55:05] and and she was supposed to be of kind
[55:07] of a mother. Amen. But she is the mother
[55:09] of harlots and her husband is the
[55:12] denominations that rule her. And the
[55:15] three cornered uh block is the the false
[55:17] triune baptism unto a trinity. And every
[55:21] time she started to rise up, that means
[55:23] the congregations begin to accept the
[55:26] truth. He would drive her right back
[55:29] down again with that false doctrine. And
[55:32] he was so big that I was afraid of him
[55:35] at first. But when I came against him, I
[55:38] found I had great and powerful muscles.
[55:41] They were faith muscles. The outlet uh
[55:44] the outcome of the dream was that uh
[55:47] since God is with me and can give me
[55:50] such strength, then let me stand up for
[55:53] her against the denominational power of
[55:57] the world and make him quit striking
[56:00] her. Now, I'm not trying to build a
[56:02] doctrine upon a dream, nor am I trying
[56:04] to vindicate any doctrine I stand for by
[56:07] a dream. The oneness of the Godhead is
[56:11] all the way through from Genesis 1:1 to
[56:14] Revelations 22:21.
[56:16] But the people have been blinded by an
[56:19] unscriptural dogma of a trinity. And
[56:22] that dogma is so universally accepted to
[56:25] uh that to try to see a one god person
[56:29] is all but impossible. But if people
[56:32] can't get can't see the truth of the
[56:34] godhead but fight it, they can't ever
[56:38] see the rest of the truth because the
[56:41] revelation of Jesus Christ in his church
[56:46] and his works in the midst of the church
[56:48] for the seven ages. Did you get it? Now,
[56:51] I hope you or I'm sure you understand.
[56:54] So, so the prophet is letting us know.
[56:58] Amen. It's not it's Amen. We It's not a
[57:02] one God opinion versus a trinitarian
[57:05] opinion. It this isn't this isn't about
[57:07] opinions. This isn't about doctrines.
[57:10] This is understanding the real purpose
[57:14] of redemption.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is God becoming visible. GOD
[57:21] COMING DOWN in as and being a human. Can
[57:26] you say amen? AMEN. SO, SO WHY AMEN.
[57:29] DOES DOES SATAN distort the name of that
[57:32] one true God? Amen. He he he he does it.
[57:36] He attacks the deity of God. He attacks
[57:39] the body in which God lives in. Now, I I
[57:44] want us TO TO TO REALLY STOP BECAUSE
[57:46] this morning I I want to talk Amen. That
[57:49] mysterious child, Amen. came for a
[57:52] purpose and that was to be married.
[57:56] Amen. He come to be married to a bride.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and and so you are part
[58:05] of that equation. JUST AS THAT BODY,
[58:08] THAT LITTLE baby in a MANGER WAS WAS SO
[58:12] MYSTERIOUS. It was so mysterious. So is
[58:16] the bride to the church. Amen. The
[58:20] church world looks at you and looks at
[58:23] me and and we look and WE WE WE'RE SO
[58:26] MYSTERIOUS AS TO WHY WE STAND OUT, BUT
[58:30] we are in covenant with the one who has
[58:33] called us. Well, can you say amen? So, I
[58:36] want to read you a few more quotes here
[58:38] as we get started. uh uh brother brother
[58:40] Brandham WOULD SAY NOW GOD'S SECRET
[58:43] MYSTERY he had before the world began.
[58:46] Now back in the back of uh part of God's
[58:48] mind there was something he was trying
[58:52] and was going to achieve. He had a
[58:55] motive in doing it in order to let
[58:58] himself be expressed. SO GOD IS IS
[59:03] DESIRING TO BE EXPRESSED. AMEN. We
[59:06] understand he was the great pillar of
[59:07] fire. HE WOULD COME AND REVEAL himself
[59:11] in in in a human form to Abraham. He
[59:13] would reveal himself in a human form to
[59:16] Moses. He would reveal himself in a
[59:19] human form in the fiery furnace. The
[59:22] these were THESE WERE LITTLE THEOPHANES.
[59:24] THESE WERE GOD SAYING, "I'M GOING TO
[59:27] COME TO EARTH
[59:29] &gt;&gt; AND I'M GOING TO HAVE a race.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO COME. I'M GOING TO LIVE IN
[59:36] HUMAN BEINGS. And there's going TO BE A
[59:39] GOD RACE. WELL, praise the Lord. Can you
[59:43] imagine God going to work? CAN YOU
[59:45] IMAGINE GOD RAISING A FAMILY? Can you
[59:49] CAN YOU IMAGINE? YOU SAY, "WELL, THAT
[59:51] THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE." BUT YOU ARE THE
[59:55] TABERNACLE OF GOD. You are the very
[59:58] tabernacle that God has come and is
[1:00:01] living in. Can you say amen?
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He would say in another place, if
[1:00:06] people can't see the truth of the
[1:00:08] Godhead, I believe I just read that to
[1:00:09] you, they they'll they'll never see the
[1:00:12] rest of the truth because the revelation
[1:00:14] of Jesus Christ in his church and his
[1:00:18] works in the midst of the church for the
[1:00:19] seven ages. Amen. Another place he would
[1:00:22] say that revelation is opening up to
[1:00:27] bring us strength. Now, IT'S IMPOS IT'S
[1:00:30] IMPORTANT. NOW YOU'VE GOT TO SEE WHAT
[1:00:32] GOD IS, WHAT HE'S DOING. NOW WATCH THIS.
[1:00:35] Look how this revelation how powerful it
[1:00:37] is. That revelation is opening up to
[1:00:40] bring us strength to illuminate the word
[1:00:44] and glorify his name. It was in the
[1:00:47] midst of the last two churches or the
[1:00:49] two ages that the revelation of the
[1:00:52] deity of Jesus Christ blossomed out
[1:00:55] before us. Yes, we knew he was God. How
[1:00:58] else could he be our savior? BUT TO KNOW
[1:01:01] THAT he was only GOD OR GOD ALONE, THAT
[1:01:06] HE WAS THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA. THAT
[1:01:09] THIS JESUS was both Lord and Christ
[1:01:13] making him Lord Jesus Christ, the
[1:01:15] father, son, and holy ghost, all one
[1:01:19] person. That's that had been lost since
[1:01:22] the first church ages. But now we are
[1:01:25] seeing it again. The revelation of who
[1:01:29] he was has come back. Well, praise the
[1:01:32] Lord.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He says, "BUT THE
[1:01:36] REVELATION OF THE GODHEAD IS BACK and
[1:01:39] the true church can build in strength
[1:01:43] again."
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; The revelation, Amen. BECAUSE IF YOU
[1:01:47] DON'T UNDERSTAND the revelation, AMEN.
[1:01:50] THAT IT WAS GOD [screaming] DESCENDING.
[1:01:52] GOD'S DESIRE TO COME DOWN. GOD WANTING
[1:01:55] TO BE ONE OF YOU. YOU WILL ALWAYS LOOK
[1:01:58] at him as as something contrary to you.
[1:02:01] YOU CONTRARY TO GOD. YOU ARE NOT
[1:02:04] CONTRARY TO GOD. YOU ARE HIS very love.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE HIS VERY HEARTBEAT. YOU YOU
[1:02:13] [screaming] ARE EVERYTHING TO HIM. WELL,
[1:02:16] glory be to God.
[1:02:18] Can you say amen?
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO CHRIST, AMEN. GREAT IS THE
[1:02:23] mystery of godliness. God made manifest
[1:02:28] in the flesh. So So the mystery of the
[1:02:31] godhead is is is one of the greatest
[1:02:33] thing. BUT IT'S THE ONE OMNIPOTENT
[1:02:36] SPIRIT MANIFESTED IN FATHERHOOD, SPIRIT
[1:02:40] GOD IN SUNSHIP, SPIRIT GOD IN A BODY AS
[1:02:45] A REDEEMER. AND THE HOLY GHOST, CHRIST,
[1:02:49] THE HOLY SPIRIT in a redeemed bride.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Now, the shepherds,
[1:02:57] Amen, those years ago were beside
[1:03:00] themselves because here here come Amen.
[1:03:04] the angels and telling them that the
[1:03:06] baby was going to be born in Bethlehem
[1:03:09] and and it will be happening, amen, in a
[1:03:12] he'll be in a manger and he'll be in in
[1:03:15] swaddling clothes. And the Bible says
[1:03:17] that when they got to them, amen there
[1:03:21] in in in Luke 2 and 20, the shepherds
[1:03:24] returned glorifying, praising God for
[1:03:27] all the things they had heard and seen
[1:03:30] as it was told unto them. God's word
[1:03:33] coming to pass.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. The shepherds HAD HEARD IT, BUT
[1:03:38] WHEN THEY SEEN GOD'S WORD COMING TO
[1:03:40] PASS, it anchored something in their
[1:03:42] heart.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MARY, WHEN MARY WAS HEARD, WHEN
[1:03:46] THE ANGEL COME TO HER, AMEN. And and and
[1:03:49] and HE TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS GOING TO
[1:03:52] HAVE THIS CHRIST CHILD AND IT WOULD BE
[1:03:55] GOD WITH US. And and and then he THEN HE
[1:03:59] SAYS AND AND TO COMFORT YOUR HEART AND
[1:04:01] TO LET YOU KNOW. HALLELUJAH. He says,
[1:04:04] "You go talk to Elizabeth and she'll be
[1:04:06] of child." And Amen. And and and then
[1:04:10] the angel appears to Joseph in a dream.
[1:04:13] And Amen. AND THEN THE PROOF BEGIN TO
[1:04:15] GROW in her belly. AND A AND THE STAR
[1:04:19] FOLLOWED THEM TO BETHLEHEM. YOU SEE,
[1:04:22] THESE WERE THINGS IT WAS THEY COULD GO
[1:04:25] BACK TO AND ANCHOR IN THEIR HEART that
[1:04:29] yes indeed, I'm the girl.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; And I I I I want that to really resonate
[1:04:36] to you here today. I want you to be able
[1:04:39] to look in the scriptures and to SEE THE
[1:04:42] PRESENT DAY TRUTH TO SEE GOD SENDING A
[1:04:45] PROPHET TO SEE AMEN EVERYTHING THAT GOD
[1:04:49] HAS INVESTED AND CALCULATE THEM AND PUT
[1:04:51] THEM ALL TOGETHER AND SAY yes indeed I'm
[1:04:56] THE GIRL. I'M THE ONE THAT HE HAS COME
[1:04:59] FOR. OH, glory to God. I don't have to
[1:05:03] guess. I DON'T HAVE TO WISH. I DON'T I'M
[1:05:06] NOT GOING TO LOOK AT MY FAILURES. I'M
[1:05:07] NOT GOING TO LOOK AT MY INABILITIES. I'M
[1:05:09] GOING TO ACCEPT God's word concerning
[1:05:12] me.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. The Bible says
[1:05:20] that she pondered and hid these things
[1:05:23] in her heart. She thought about them,
[1:05:26] meditated. Well, glory to the lamb of
[1:05:28] God.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; You see, amen. Jesus was that mystery
[1:05:32] even to his disciples. You know there
[1:05:34] there Philip says it would suffice us if
[1:05:36] you I if you would show us the father
[1:05:39] and he says have I been so long a time
[1:05:41] with you Philillip and you still don't
[1:05:42] know who I am. He that hath seen me hath
[1:05:46] seen the father.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; I'M AN EXPRESSION OF THE FATHER. WELL
[1:05:52] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? And then he looks at
[1:05:54] him. Amen. There in in in John 14 and
[1:05:57] 10. Amen. HE SAYS, "BELIEVEST THOU that
[1:06:00] I am in the Father and the Father in me.
[1:06:04] The words that I speak unto you, I speak
[1:06:06] NOT OF MYSELF, BUT THE FATHER THAT
[1:06:10] DWELLS IN ME, HE DOETH THE WORKS." SO
[1:06:14] WHILE THEY COULD NOT IDENTIFY GOD IN
[1:06:17] THAT BODY, God was in that body.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; The only problem was in that day or the
[1:06:24] only good thing about it was in that
[1:06:26] day, Jesus had a revelation of who he
[1:06:28] was.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus could look right there and says,
[1:06:31] "I don't care what the rest of you say.
[1:06:33] I AND MY FATHER are one." AND GOD'S
[1:06:36] WANTING THAT SAME KIND OF A FAITH IN
[1:06:39] YOU. I [screaming]
[1:06:40] AND MY FATHER ARE ONE.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, the devils are telling
[1:06:47] you you're not bride. Devil's telling
[1:06:48] you, you know, you you won't make the
[1:06:51] rapture, BUT YOU STAND RIGHT UP AND SAY,
[1:06:53] "LISTEN, MY FATHER DWELLS IN ME. THE
[1:06:56] PRESENCE OF [screaming] GOD HAS APPEARED
[1:06:58] TO ME. I AM EVERYTHING THAT HE SAYS I
[1:07:02] AM."
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; So, the fullness of the of the Godhead
[1:07:09] bodily, amen, in Christ. Hebrews 1 and3
[1:07:13] it says he who BEING THE BRIGHTNESS OF
[1:07:16] HIS glory and the express image of his
[1:07:20] person. So he was the express image.
[1:07:25] Hallelujah. That little Galilean, that
[1:07:28] little carpenter son. He was the express
[1:07:31] he was the perfect image of the
[1:07:35] invisible God. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:07:38] COLOSSIANS 1 AND 15. WHO IS the image of
[1:07:42] the invisible God. JU UH JOHN 1:18, "NO
[1:07:46] MAN HATH SEEN God at any time, the only
[1:07:49] begotten uh son which is in the bosom of
[1:07:52] the father, he hath declared him."
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now in our in our
[1:08:01] uh church age when God was wanting to
[1:08:05] reveal
[1:08:06] uh himself he's his first words there in
[1:08:10] Revelations 3 and14 unto the angel of
[1:08:15] the church of the leotans write these
[1:08:18] things saith THE AMEN THE FAITHFUL AND
[1:08:22] TRUE witness the beginning of the
[1:08:26] creation of God.
[1:08:28] Now, now brother Brandham would would
[1:08:31] tell us that man uh uh that this
[1:08:35] scripture is saying that God created
[1:08:39] Jesus and that or yes that that that God
[1:08:43] created uh you know him first before he
[1:08:47] created uh the creation and and and thus
[1:08:50] it would make him lower than the Godhead
[1:08:53] and then this first creation which would
[1:08:56] be Jesus and then he would he would
[1:08:58] create the universe. But brother
[1:09:00] Brandham would tell us God did not
[1:09:03] create God.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; God God did not create God. God created
[1:09:10] a body.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; GOD CREATED A BODY for him
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; to live in.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Just like you build a house for you to
[1:09:21] live in, God created a house, a
[1:09:25] tabernacle, a body. so that he could
[1:09:28] live in. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the beginning was the word. The
[1:09:33] word was with God. The word was God.
[1:09:36] Amen. Is that right? And all THINGS WERE
[1:09:39] CREATED BY HIM, and without him was not
[1:09:44] anything created. So, SO HE'S THE SAME
[1:09:48] ONE IN GENESIS 1 AND1 WHO SAYS, "AND IN
[1:09:51] THE BEGINNING, GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS
[1:09:54] and the earth." IT'S THAT SAME ONE. CAN
[1:09:57] YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; SO, BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US
[1:10:00] HE IS the beginner or he is the author
[1:10:05] of the creation of God. And and and AND
[1:10:08] HE WOULD SAY THAT GOD COULDN'T REVEAL
[1:10:10] HIMSELF IN THESE IN THIS MYSTERIOUS WAY.
[1:10:13] AMEN. REMOVE ALL the mystery until the
[1:10:16] very last church age.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; And then, amen. HE WOULD REVEAL HIMSELF
[1:10:22] IN A greater measure because he wants
[1:10:25] this church to know who she is.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; And the only WAY YOU CAN KNOW WHO YOU
[1:10:33] are is not looking in the MIRROR AND NOT
[1:10:36] FOLLOWING YOUR 23 AND ME AND NOT DOING
[1:10:40] THESE THINGS TO TO FIND YOUR NATURAL
[1:10:43] GENETICS. God wants you to know you have
[1:10:47] an origin
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; that is greater than anything here of
[1:10:51] this earth.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, praise the Lord. Now,
[1:10:55] that you you've got an origin that is
[1:10:57] Well, Praise the Lord. I I I like that.
[1:10:59] Amen. I'm getting older and fatter and
[1:11:02] Amen. You You go down and look, you look
[1:11:04] Amen. My my my grandfa was heavy. My
[1:11:07] grandma was heavy. My daddy's heavy.
[1:11:11] Amen. and and and and and you know uh my
[1:11:14] my my grand my grandmother's mother was
[1:11:18] heavy and and and uh I'm heavy
[1:11:23] and and so uh uh you know so we fight
[1:11:27] those things, you know, and you can look
[1:11:28] back through our genetics and and
[1:11:30] there's just a lot of things I see in me
[1:11:32] that I wish I could scrub out, but I
[1:11:34] can't scrub it out. It's it's part of
[1:11:36] who I AM.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; WELL, COME ON. a lot of your complexes
[1:11:40] you have here. Amen. Sitting here this
[1:11:42] morning is because of your genetics.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; A lot of THE THINGS THAT YOU GO THROUGH
[1:11:46] AND and and and you you you just
[1:11:49] SOMETIMES OUR MIND FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING
[1:11:51] TO EXPLODE AND IT ALL GOES BACK THROUGH
[1:11:53] YOUR GENETICS. BUT WHEN GOD COMES IN AND
[1:11:55] SAYS, "LISTEN, AMEN. I HAVE GOT ANOTHER
[1:11:58] CREATION." AND HE'S NOT DEALING, BROTHER
[1:12:00] BRANDHAM SAYS WHEN HE SAID THAT HE IS
[1:12:03] THE HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THE CREATION OF
[1:12:05] GOD. HE SAYS HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THE
[1:12:07] OLD CREATION AT THE BEGINNING
[1:12:09] NECESSARILY. HE'S TALKING ABOUT A
[1:12:12] CREATION OF HIMSELF,
[1:12:15] A BODY OF HIMSELF. [screaming]
[1:12:18] THERE'S GOING TO BE A PEOPLE THAT HE is
[1:12:21] going to live in.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. So, he's the author
[1:12:28] or the beginner of the creation of God.
[1:12:32] Hallelujah. He says this is a completely
[1:12:33] different creation than that which was
[1:12:36] immen 6,000 years ago. He says this is a
[1:12:39] special designation of himself. He is
[1:12:43] the creator of that church. The heavenly
[1:12:47] bridegroom
[1:12:49] created HIS OWN BRIDE. AMEN.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; NOW, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND this
[1:12:56] mysterious one that WAS LAYING IN THE
[1:12:59] MANGER CAME FOR A PURPOSE.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; TO express himself and to have children.
[1:13:06] Well, glory to God. Now, amen. Brother
[1:13:09] Brandham would say, "As the spirit of
[1:13:11] God, he come down and created in the
[1:13:14] Virgin Mary the cells from which his
[1:13:17] body was born." I WANT TO REPEAT THAT.
[1:13:20] He created the very cells in the womb of
[1:13:23] of Mary for that body. It was not enough
[1:13:26] THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT TO simply uh give
[1:13:28] life to a human oam supplied by Mary.
[1:13:32] That would have been SINFUL MANKIND
[1:13:34] PRODUCING A BODY. But that would not
[1:13:37] have uh produced the last Adam of him.
[1:13:40] It was said, "Lo, A BODY THOU FATHER
[1:13:44] prepared to me."
[1:13:46] SO GOOD. NOT GOD, NOT MARY PROVIDED that
[1:13:50] body. Mary was the human incubator and
[1:13:54] SHE CARRIED THE HOLY child and brought
[1:13:58] him to birth. Now I want you to catch
[1:14:00] that now BECAUSE THE NEW BIRTH IS THE
[1:14:02] SAME WAY.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS NOT DEPENDENT UPON MARY. GOD
[1:14:10] CHOSE MARY TO GIVE BIRTH TO THAT CHILD.
[1:14:15] ARE YOU HEARING me
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; now? He says it was a God man. He was he
[1:14:20] WAS THE SON OF GOD. HE WAS THE VERY
[1:14:23] CREATION THE the He was of the new
[1:14:26] creation. Man and God met and joined. He
[1:14:30] was the first of this new race. He is
[1:14:33] the head of this new race. Well, praise
[1:14:36] the Lord.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Now, I WANT US TO JUST JUST STOP. AND I
[1:14:40] I I'M GOING TO I you know, and I should
[1:14:42] have said at the beginning, none of this
[1:14:43] is going to BE NEW, BUT I WANT YOU TO
[1:14:46] CONNECT THIS WITH CHRISTMAS.
[1:14:48] I want you to connect you sitting here
[1:14:52] AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT TOOK PLACE. AMEN.
[1:14:55] When with that baby in the manger, IT
[1:14:59] WAS GOD WORKING HIS way into the human
[1:15:03] race.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now, now there in
[1:15:08] Colossians 1:8, it says, "He is the head
[1:15:11] of the body, the church." Amen. Who is
[1:15:15] the beginning, the firstborn
[1:15:19] uh from the dead, THAT IN ALL THINGS HE
[1:15:25] MIGHT HAVE PREEMINENCE. WELL, bless the
[1:15:28] name of the Lord.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. 2 Corinthians 5:17.
[1:15:33] Therefore, if any man, and you can put
[1:15:36] those scriptures up, any man be in
[1:15:38] Christ, he is a new creation.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, things have PASSED AWAY, BEHOLD, ALL
[1:15:45] THINGS ARE BECOME NEW. CAN you say amen?
[1:15:48] So, so though man was of the older
[1:15:52] order, the older creation, God is saying
[1:15:56] there is a new creation and it's going
[1:15:58] to be my very own bride. Yeah.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to just stay with me a
[1:16:03] little bit longer and then we're going
[1:16:04] to get into the good stuff. Hallelujah.
[1:16:06] Ephesians 2:10. We are his workmanship
[1:16:11] created in Christ Jesus. Now, now here
[1:16:16] here is here is what the original says.
[1:16:18] Created in union with Christ Jesus unto
[1:16:23] good works. So everything that you are,
[1:16:28] Amen. in your in your Christian walk is
[1:16:32] found in that Christ child.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now when Jesus when
[1:16:39] Jesus was teaching his disciples to pray
[1:16:43] and he started out our father who art in
[1:16:46] heaven. Now Jesus spoke it's it's it's
[1:16:50] uh he he spoke uh uh uh how do you spell
[1:16:54] that? Uh hallelujah.
[1:16:58] Am
[1:17:00] a r a m a i c. Aramaic. That's what I'm
[1:17:04] trying to say. Amen. That was the that
[1:17:06] was the language there in the in the
[1:17:08] Galilee. And so most of the scholars
[1:17:11] believe that when he taught them to
[1:17:13] pray, Amen. our father. Now we have in
[1:17:17] there the Abba, Abba, father, daddy,
[1:17:21] papa. Amen. But the original it was the
[1:17:24] abun. Amen. Our abun who art in heaven.
[1:17:31] And and it's and it's quite an
[1:17:32] incredible thing because Amen. Um, abw
[1:17:37] blends father ab with womb. The word
[1:17:42] womb means womb. Womb. Womb of a woman.
[1:17:46] It puts the masculine and the feminine
[1:17:50] together. So, so when he was praying,
[1:17:52] Amen. the ab masculine wound feminine.
[1:17:56] Amen. Ab wound is mother father. Now, I
[1:18:00] WANT YOU TO CATCH THIS for them and and
[1:18:01] because I'm I'm getting to A TO A PLACE.
[1:18:03] GOD WANTING TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. HE COULD
[1:18:06] NOT JUST EXPRESS HIMSELF IN the deity
[1:18:10] form of Jesus Christ. HE HAD TO EXPRESS
[1:18:14] HIMSELF IN THE DEITY FORM THROUGH A
[1:18:18] WOMAN.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. SEE, WE WANT
[1:18:26] TO PUT IT ALL IN JESUS. BUT AND AND AND
[1:18:29] WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS TRINITY THING,
[1:18:31] you're you're you're just YOU'RE YOU'RE
[1:18:32] YOU'RE YOU'VE GOT THIS SLOTMENT. BUT
[1:18:34] YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND IT IS GOD
[1:18:37] [screaming]
[1:18:38] IN us living his life.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Now I thought this was this was in in
[1:18:46] incredible because the abun amen is that
[1:18:48] Aramaic word amen is not just a loose
[1:18:51] word. Now it you know father hearing
[1:18:54] it's it's just hard. They say it's hard
[1:18:56] for the English language to just really
[1:18:58] pick that up, but it conveys a deep
[1:19:01] intimacy and respect. Amen. And and and
[1:19:04] and IT'S IT'S IT'S FAR MORE AFFECTIONATE
[1:19:07] THAN THAN just the word daddy. AMEN. AND
[1:19:10] AND SO AS AS [screaming] GOD, HE IS THE
[1:19:14] ALLSUFFICIENT ONE. AMEN. We sing the
[1:19:17] song. He's my mother. He's my father.
[1:19:18] He's my brother. He's my sister. He is
[1:19:21] all in all to me. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:19:24] Amen. He appeared unto Abraham and and
[1:19:27] he SAYS, "I AM EL SHADAI."
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; WELL, EL SHADAI IS THE ALMIGHTY GOD, THE
[1:19:33] BREASTED GOD.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; And he was telling he was telling
[1:19:40] Abraham, "Amen, you're weak. You're old.
[1:19:42] Your name is Abram. You you've gone
[1:19:45] these these these many years waiting on
[1:19:47] a promise. Amen. Won't you come and take
[1:19:50] hold of my breasts? I've given you."
[1:19:53] Amen. Nurse on MY PROMISES. NURSE. I I'M
[1:19:57] GOING TO NURSE. TAKE MY words into your
[1:20:01] being. And the Bible says just a few
[1:20:03] VERSES DOWN, GOD CHANGED HIS name and
[1:20:06] made him well, praise the Lord.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; AFTER HE TOOK THE PROMISES OF GOD, HE
[1:20:12] SAYS, "TAKE HOLD OF MY BREAST. TAKE HOLD
[1:20:15] OF MY PROMISES." AMEN. AND AND NURSE
[1:20:18] YOURSELF A STRENGTH. I KNOW YOU'RE OLD.
[1:20:22] I KNOW YOU'RE INCAPABLE, BUT I WANT YOU
[1:20:24] TO TAKE these promises. And by the way,
[1:20:27] Abram, amen, fatherless, your name is
[1:20:30] going to be called Abraham because
[1:20:32] you're going to be a father of many
[1:20:35] nations.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; SO, IT WAS GOD EXPRESSING HIMSELF IN THE
[1:20:40] FORM OF A WOMAN.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He had it in him.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Abom, can you say amen?
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You know when God
[1:20:51] created Adam?
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; He created him in his own image.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Good point.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; And when he created Adam, Adam had
[1:21:03] feminine and MASCULINE IN THE BODY.
[1:21:06] WELL, glory to God.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; ADAM WAS PREGNANT with Eve. Yeah,
[1:21:13] [laughter]
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; ADAM HAD EVE ON THE INSIDE [screaming]
[1:21:19] OF HIM.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; ADAM WAS LIVING IN PERFECTION, BUT ADAM
[1:21:23] WAS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL HE COULD EXPRESS.
[1:21:27] [screaming]
[1:21:27] OH, GLORY TO GOD.
[1:21:29] GOD THE ALLSUFFICIENT ONE. GOD THE
[1:21:32] [screaming] ALL AND ALL THE PERFECT GOD
[1:21:35] COULD NOT BE COMPLETE UNTIL HE EXPRESSED
[1:21:41] HIMSELF.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT CHRISTMAS IS. AMEN.
[1:21:45] UNDERSTANDING THE [screaming] EXPRESSION
[1:21:47] OF GOD.
[1:21:50] YEAH,
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; there's no wonder when Jesus was laying
[1:21:54] there in [laughter]
[1:21:56] in the manger
[1:21:58] that angels from the highest heavens
[1:22:02] came down. Amen. PROCLAIMING PROCLAIMING
[1:22:05] TO THE SHEPHERDS. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS A
[1:22:08] GREAT HOST OF ANGELIC BEINGS COME
[1:22:10] MAGNIFYING AND WORSHIPING GOD. WHY?
[1:22:14] THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION.
[1:22:20] YEAH,
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; that was Jehovah laying in that manger.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; That was Jehovah that the cows were
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; loing at,
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; the sheep were banging at. Well, praise
[1:22:31] the Lord. [laughter]
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, but that was not the Oh, that's just
[1:22:35] the beginning.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; That's just the beginning. This Christ
[1:22:38] child would become the word in flesh.
[1:22:42] This This one would redeem you and me.
[1:22:45] Well, bless the Lord.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:48] Now, amen. Adam was like his father.
[1:22:53] Hallelujah. When he created him, he
[1:22:55] created him with Eve in him. Male and
[1:22:58] female created he them according to
[1:22:59] Genesis 1:27. Amen. So, he he was like
[1:23:04] his father. Amen. He was male and
[1:23:06] female. Hallelujah. He was living in
[1:23:10] perfection. Well, glory to God. He was
[1:23:12] walking and talking with God already in
[1:23:14] the cool of the evening.
[1:23:16] And and it and IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE
[1:23:18] THAT RIGHT RIGHT THERE IN THE SAME
[1:23:19] SCRIPTURES WHERE HE'S SAYING he's naming
[1:23:21] the animals. AMEN. GOD HAD JUST MADE
[1:23:23] FROM THE DIRT AND NOW GOD HAS HIM MAKING
[1:23:25] THE ANIMALS AND HE'S AND HE'S LOOKING AT
[1:23:28] THE TWO BY TWOS AND HE'S DOING ALL OF
[1:23:30] THIS. AND THEN GOD LOOKED AT ADAM and he
[1:23:34] seen Adam
[1:23:36] was lonely
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; and and and Adam needed well praise the
[1:23:42] Lord. And he says, "It's not good that
[1:23:44] man should be alone, and I will make him
[1:23:48] a helpmate for him." Well, can you say
[1:23:51] amen?
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God, WE WE YOU KNOW, AND AND
[1:23:54] AGAIN, THIS IS ALL THIS IS ALL this is
[1:23:56] this is all old stuff for y'all. I
[1:23:57] understand. But God didn't take new dirt
[1:24:00] like he done everything else. HE REACHED
[1:24:03] INSIDE OF Adam
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; and HE PULLED EVE OUT of Adam
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; AND HE TOOK THAT FEMININE SPIRIT OUT OF
[1:24:12] ADAM AND HE PUT IT IN THIS NEW creation
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; by the name of Adam.
[1:24:20] You see, Adam was Adam and so was Mrs.
[1:24:25] Adam.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; She didn't become Eve until she had her
[1:24:28] first baby.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Eve, Adam, WELL, WELL, CAN YOU
[1:24:34] SAY AMEN?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; SO ADAM WAS LAYING THERE. GOD
[1:24:38] [screaming] PULLED THE RIB, CREATED THE
[1:24:41] WOMAN. AMEN. BROUGHT THE THE FEMININE
[1:24:44] SPIRIT, PUT IT UPON HER, AND CALLED HER
[1:24:47] ADAM. And and and and and this IS WHAT
[1:24:50] THIS IS WHAT G THIS IS WHAT THE
[1:24:52] SCRIPTURE SAYS. AMEN. Genesis 2 and 21.
[1:24:55] AND THE LORD CAUSED INDEED SLEEP TO FALL
[1:24:57] UPON ADAM, AND HE SLEPT. AND HE TOOK ONE
[1:24:59] OF HIS RIBS, AND CLOSED UP THE FLESH
[1:25:01] INSTEAD THEREOF. AND THE RIB WHICH THE
[1:25:03] LORD HAD TAKEN from the man, he made a
[1:25:04] woman and brought her unto the man. AND
[1:25:08] WHAT DID ADAM [screaming] SAY? AMEN.
[1:25:11] THIS IS BONE OF MY BONE.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; THIS IS FLESH OF [screaming] MY FLESH.
[1:25:19] She shall be called woman because she
[1:25:21] was taken out of the man.
[1:25:28] When I think about Christ, this
[1:25:30] mysterious one, THIS ONE THAT GOD HAD
[1:25:34] CREATED, THIS BODY, now Christ, think
[1:25:38] about it now. Amen. Think about it.
[1:25:42] Within Adam was that woman. He was
[1:25:43] carrying the woman. All the feminist
[1:25:45] qualities were residing in him. They
[1:25:49] came from him. Can you say amen?
[1:25:52] ADAM WAS PREGNANT WITH PROMISE AND
[1:25:54] [screaming] SO WAS JESUS PREGNANT WITH
[1:25:58] PROMISE.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; For the bride
[1:26:05] Jesus bride was in him.
[1:26:10] All all of the all of THE ATTRIBUTES OF
[1:26:14] GOD, ALL OF THE DNA,
[1:26:17] ALL EVERY SON, EVERY ALL [screaming]
[1:26:21] OF THOSE thoughts
[1:26:23] that were in the mind of God were now in
[1:26:26] the body of Jesus.
[1:26:30] You know what that means, Sister Angie?
[1:26:32] You were there then.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:26:36] Brother Donald, you were there that
[1:26:38] Jesus. Hallelujah. Probably shouldn't
[1:26:41] preach this kind of stuff on the
[1:26:42] internet, but Jesus was pregnant with
[1:26:45] promise. He had you in him. Jesus had to
[1:26:52] go to Calvary. When Jesus went to
[1:26:54] Calvary, you were there in him.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; When Jesus went to hell, you were there
[1:27:00] in him. When Jesus rose from the dead,
[1:27:03] you were there. As Eve WAS IN ADAM, SO
[1:27:07] WAS THE BRIDE in Christ. OH, COME ON,
[1:27:12] CHURCH. AMEN. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE
[1:27:14] GOING THROUGH. I DON'T CARE WHAT
[1:27:16] MISTAKES YOU'VE MADE. I DON'T CARE WHAT
[1:27:18] SIN THAT SATAN TRIES TO HOLD OVER YOU.
[1:27:21] IT HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN CARE
[1:27:23] [screaming] OF THROUGH ADAM, THE SECOND
[1:27:26] MAN, ADAM, JESUS CHRIST.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:31] HALLELUJAH. WELL, glory to God.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:27:36] so Jesus
[1:27:38] had to be put to sleep. Adam had to be
[1:27:41] put to sleep
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; in order to take the bride.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; And Jesus had to be taken put to sleep
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; in order to pull the bride out of him.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Pull the bride. You say, "No, no, no."
[1:27:56] Now, brother, he he put he put the flesh
[1:27:59] back together,
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; brought him back out of his sleep.
[1:28:03] Hallelujah. Are you hearing me? And then
[1:28:05] ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, WHAT HAPPENED?
[1:28:08] THE VERY LIFE OF GOD,
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; the feminist,
[1:28:17] the feminist side of God
[1:28:21] come down. Well, glory to God. You say,
[1:28:23] "Now, now
[1:28:25] it doesn't say that the feminist side of
[1:28:27] God come down." Listen, we've already
[1:28:30] got the groom.
[1:28:32] Now, here comes the Holy Spirit in his
[1:28:36] bride. The characteristics of the bride
[1:28:39] is not that of the groom. In in in other
[1:28:41] words, you're not the bride is not
[1:28:43] brash. The bride is not out trying to
[1:28:46] provide for herself. The bride is not
[1:28:48] out the the bride is meek. the the the
[1:28:51] the the the bride has been created,
[1:28:53] amen, to be a a companion suitable UNTO
[1:28:58] CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT A HELP ME IS. A
[1:29:00] COMPANION SUITABLE. Eve was a companion
[1:29:03] suitable unto unto uh uh uh Adam. AMEN.
[1:29:07] AND THE BRIDE IS A COMPANION. AMEN. HER
[1:29:10] DESIRE IS UNTO HER LORD. SHE COME FROM
[1:29:13] ADAM. WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:29:17] CHRIST IS THE GROOM. CHRIST IS THE BURLY
[1:29:19] ONE. HE'S THE ONE THAT SAYS, "I'VE DONE
[1:29:21] PAID THE PRICE. I'VE PROVIDED
[1:29:23] EVERYTHING. [screaming] EVERYTHING'S
[1:29:25] TAKEN CARE OF. THE BRIDE IS THERE."
[1:29:28] AMEN. SITTING AT HIS TABLE, LOVING HIM,
[1:29:31] ADORING HIM, GIVING HIM HONOR AND PRAISE
[1:29:34] as only the bride can do.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:45] Hallelujah. Do you love him? Amen.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; So though he was perfect, he was not
[1:29:51] complete until he gave birth or he
[1:29:54] expressed the attributes within him in
[1:29:58] their fullness.
[1:30:00] Hallelujah. He had to be delivered of
[1:30:02] the woman in order to be complete. Is
[1:30:06] that right? Amen. So is God all in all
[1:30:10] within him are those qualities. Brother
[1:30:12] Brandham says in very plain language,
[1:30:15] "The true bride of Christ was in the
[1:30:18] mind of God eternally, though not
[1:30:20] expressed until each came forth in the
[1:30:24] designated decreed season.
[1:30:26] As each member came forth, it become
[1:30:30] expressed and took its place." I love
[1:30:33] that. I love that word expressed.
[1:30:36] HALLELUJAH. SO WHY HAVE YOU BEEN
[1:30:39] EXPRESSED?
[1:30:40] YOU'VE BEEN EXPRESSED TO DECLARE HIS
[1:30:42] DEITY, TO DECLARE HIS GLORY, NOT TO
[1:30:45] DECLARE YOUR NOT TO DECLARE YOUR
[1:30:48] WORTHLESSNESS, NOT TO DECLARE YOUR your
[1:30:52] you know UH UH YOUR SHAME AND NOT TO
[1:30:55] DECLARE those things.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God knew you were born in your
[1:31:00] natural lineage. You were born in
[1:31:02] defeat. GOD KNEW IN YOUR BODY YOU WERE
[1:31:05] BROTHER JOHN. THERE'S NO GOOD IN YOU.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; COME ON, BROTHER. As pretty as as as as
[1:31:09] as SISTER APRIL IS, THERE'S NO GOOD IN
[1:31:12] YOU.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; COME ON, GOD.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; AND AS HANDSOME AS THAT YOUNG FELLA
[1:31:15] RIGHT THERE BESIDE HER, THERE'S NO GOOD
[1:31:17] IN YOU.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. There's none of us.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; We fight depression.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; We fight anxieties.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; We fight those things in our mind.
[1:31:31] And if you don't, if you're not careful,
[1:31:33] sometimes you can't separate the two.
[1:31:35] Yeah.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; And you've got to
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; you've got to you've got to separate the
[1:31:39] two.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Because in your decreed season, you came
[1:31:44] forth.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; The new creation IS NOT YOU'RE STILL
[1:31:49] YOU'RE STILL LIVING IN YOUR BODY, but
[1:31:51] the new creation is that word made flesh
[1:31:54] in you. Well, praise the Lord. Now, he
[1:31:57] says each member come become expressed,
[1:31:58] took his place in the body. Thus, the
[1:32:00] bride is the literal spoken word seed
[1:32:02] bride. And though she is feminine
[1:32:04] designation, she is also called the body
[1:32:05] of Christ. It is very apparent that she
[1:32:08] ought to be called that for she was
[1:32:10] predestined to him come from the same
[1:32:12] source was eternal with him and is now
[1:32:16] manifesting God in a many membered body.
[1:32:20] Whereas once God was manifested in one
[1:32:22] member even our Lord Jesus Christ. Well,
[1:32:25] can I hear a
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; great big amen?
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's because of this,
[1:32:31] BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY, HER
[1:32:32] RIGHTEOUSNESS IS HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. HER
[1:32:34] ATTRIBUTES are his OWN GLORIOUS
[1:32:37] ATTRIBUTES. HER IDENTITY IS FOUND IN
[1:32:39] HIM. WHAT HE IS, SHE IS TO REFLECT.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE HAS, [screaming] SHE IS TO
[1:32:49] MANIFEST.
[1:32:50] And then he says, THERE IS NO FAULT.
[1:32:56] And I know sometimes you're looking at
[1:32:57] your wife and saying, "I just don't
[1:32:59] know." And sometimes you're looking at
[1:33:02] your husband and you're saying, "Ah."
[1:33:04] But when God when when your heavenly
[1:33:07] bridegroom looks at you, there is no
[1:33:11] fault in her. She is all glorious within
[1:33:15] and without from the beginning to the
[1:33:18] ending. She is the work OF HER LORD AND
[1:33:22] ALL HIS WORKS ARE PERFECT. CAN I HEAR A
[1:33:25] great big amen?
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Well, glory.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Now, IF MY WIFE COULD GET THAT from me
[1:33:33] every day that we live,
[1:33:36] if I COULD GET THAT KIND OF AFFIRMATION
[1:33:39] from her every day that I live,
[1:33:43] ain't going to happen because we're full
[1:33:44] of failures.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. AMEN. BUT I WILL
[1:33:51] TELL you the one that you came out of,
[1:33:55] Christ is saying, "You're all perfect."
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Do you understand
[1:34:05] that? We've got to understand the
[1:34:06] Godhead. You've got to understand what
[1:34:10] God is doing.
[1:34:12] God in the great PILLAR OF FIRE. GOD IN
[1:34:15] THE PERFECT MAN. God in the redeemed
[1:34:19] body of the bride.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; And brother brother Brandon would put it
[1:34:28] this way. From beginning to the ending,
[1:34:30] she is the work of the Lord and all his
[1:34:32] works are perfect. In fact, in her is
[1:34:35] summed up and manifested
[1:34:38] the eternal wisdom and purpose
[1:34:42] of God.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:45] He said, "How can one fathom it? How can
[1:34:47] one understand it? Though we cannot do
[1:34:49] that, we can accept it by faith. For God
[1:34:53] has spoken it."
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; SO THE SECOND MAN, ADAM, AMEN. He had
[1:34:59] the masculine
[1:35:01] and the feminine spirit. AMEN. HIS WIFE
[1:35:05] WAS IN HIM. HER EVERY ATTRIBUTE,
[1:35:10] EVERY ATTRIBUTE WAS IN him then. Yes,
[1:35:14] sir.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; That's why Adam could say bone of my
[1:35:16] bone. She's flesh of my flesh. Jesus
[1:35:19] would put it this way, and I love this.
[1:35:21] Now, catch this on the Godhead. Now, I
[1:35:23] quote this a lot, and you guys have
[1:35:24] heard it a lot these these last a little
[1:35:27] bit, but Colossians 2:9. For in him
[1:35:30] dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead
[1:35:33] bodily. And we stopped there, but the
[1:35:36] 10th verse says, "And you are complete
[1:35:40] in him.
[1:35:45] You come from him.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; He was the EXPRESSION OF THE INVISIBLE.
[1:35:50] HE WAS THAT GREAT ABUNDANT, THAT GREAT
[1:35:53] GOD WHO WAS MOTHER, FATHER, MALE,
[1:35:59] FEMALE.
[1:36:00] HE COME [screaming] EMPTIED HIMSELF IN
[1:36:03] THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST AND THEN PULLED
[1:36:06] OUT OF CHRIST.
[1:36:09] that woman.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE PULLED OUT OF PERFECTION. YOU
[1:36:15] WERE CREATED IN PERFECTION RIGHT HERE.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; The new birth is perfection.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; That's why God holds nothing against
[1:36:22] you.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE HIS. [screaming]
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; He is so He is so complete that the
[1:36:29] prophet of God Amen. The prophet of God
[1:36:31] tells us that that he is that that you
[1:36:34] are so complete in him,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; right? that you will not you will not
[1:36:39] come into the tribulation. They said,
[1:36:42] "Well, won't you have to be won't you
[1:36:43] have to go through the pur uh
[1:36:45] purification of the tribulation?"
[1:36:46] Brother Brandham SAYS THAT WOULD BE
[1:36:48] AGAINST EVERYTHING GOD.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; GOD TOOK CARE OF IT [screaming] ALL WHEN
[1:36:55] HE WENT TO CALVARY.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; AND SHE IS COMPLETE [screaming]
[1:37:01] IN HIM.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. OH, GLORY TO GOD.
[1:37:08] LADIES, YOU'RE COMPLETE IN YOUR HUSBAND
[1:37:10] HERE ON THE EARTH. YOU HAVE A FAMILY.
[1:37:13] YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RAISING THEM IN THE
[1:37:14] FEAR OF THE LORD. BUT YOU THERE IS A
[1:37:17] GREATER PURPOSE. THERE'S A GREATER
[1:37:20] PURPOSE. YOU ARE THE VERY BRIDE OF THE
[1:37:23] LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; WELL, glory to God.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you say amen? In this
[1:37:34] Christ dwells the fullness and you are
[1:37:36] now complete in him.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Oh the glorious union. Oh that glorious
[1:37:44] union. Bless the name of the Lord. Now
[1:37:48] Amen. Now the prophet would tell us that
[1:37:51] entire Bible is an expression.
[1:37:55] Hallelujah. Amen. He said God's great
[1:37:58] secrets he had before the world. back in
[1:38:00] the back part of God's mind. There was
[1:38:01] something he was trying and that he was
[1:38:03] going to achieve. He had a motive in
[1:38:05] doing it in order to let him be
[1:38:06] expressed. Amen. He wanted these
[1:38:10] attributes to be expressed. In him was
[1:38:13] love. In him was to be father. In him
[1:38:16] was to be son. In him was to be savior.
[1:38:18] In him was to BE HEALER. AND THESE
[1:38:20] ATTRIBUTES THAT WE see already
[1:38:22] expressed, they were in God. Amen. ON
[1:38:24] THAT HE SAYS, "AND THE ENTIRE BIBLE IS
[1:38:26] AN EXPRESSION OF THE ONE GO." SOMEBODY
[1:38:28] SAY ONE GO, [screaming]
[1:38:30] ONE PURPOSE HE WANTED TO ACHIEVE IN THE
[1:38:34] ENTIRE BIBLE OUT OF ALL THE ACTS OF THE
[1:38:36] BELIEVERS IN THE Bible has been a type
[1:38:38] an EXPRESSION OF WHAT GOD'S GREAT GOAL
[1:38:40] IS. AND NOW in this last day, he's
[1:38:42] revealed it and SHOWED IT. THAT'S HIS
[1:38:46] PURPOSE THAT HE MIGHT be able TO ACHIEVE
[1:38:50] TO HAVE HIS preeminence working in his
[1:38:53] church. and let the WORD OF GOD SHINE
[1:38:56] FORTH FIRST. No matter what any else
[1:38:59] looks like, I don't care if
[1:39:01] intellectuals say this, that, or the
[1:39:03] other. It h it has nothing to DO WITH
[1:39:06] IT. GOD'S WORD SAYS SO, and we are more
[1:39:09] than able to take it.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Now, this glorious union, hallelujah.
[1:39:16] Now, it does require it does require
[1:39:19] submission
[1:39:21] just as it required submission from
[1:39:22] Mary.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. as it required submission.
[1:39:25] I believe God no matter what.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; But you're of a higher order than Mary.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Mary wasn't the bride of God.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Think about it. [laughter]
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Mary Mary wasn't the bride of God. God
[1:39:40] created God. She was the human
[1:39:42] incubator. God created Amen. Uh uh the
[1:39:46] the the sperm and the egg. Amen. And
[1:39:48] here come Jesus Christ. She was not the
[1:39:50] bride. That's the reason why when
[1:39:52] brother Brandon would would would give
[1:39:54] the the types
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Hagar and and uh Sarah
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; and and Mary
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; and he would say Hagar was the first
[1:40:04] denominator or the you know coming out
[1:40:06] that was that was justification Luther
[1:40:09] and then here come here come Wesley he
[1:40:12] said that was Sarah
[1:40:14] and he says and now Mary though Mary
[1:40:16] says oh many say Mary she's she's it she
[1:40:20] said he She was the shuck.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Shuck. Mary said, "Be it unto me." Well,
[1:40:28] praise the Lord.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; You see, MARY WASN'T THE BRIDE of God,
[1:40:33] but you are.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Mary had to go to the upper room to
[1:40:38] receive a new birth.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Sure did.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Sure did.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? Could you
[1:40:43] imagine that? After having the baby,
[1:40:45] raising Jesus. Amen. That was her boy.
[1:40:48] And yet she was up there in that upper
[1:40:50] room and had to receive the same new
[1:40:51] birth that everyone else had to receive.
[1:40:53] IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; SO HERE YOU ARE TODAY. GOD'S NOT GOD'S
[1:40:58] NOT EVEN PUT YOU IN THERE WITH HAGAR.
[1:41:00] Thank God for that. He's not even put
[1:41:02] you in there with Sarah. Thank God for
[1:41:03] that. He didn't even put you in there.
[1:41:05] He didn't even put you in there with
[1:41:07] with with Mary.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; This is the greatest of all things where
[1:41:13] the word becomes flesh
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; in us.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Well, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? GLORIOUS UNION.
[1:41:25] The glorious union. Amen.
[1:41:29] Where the word has a womb
[1:41:34] that it can pregnant.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Bride, groom
[1:41:42] producing promises
[1:41:45] supernatural.
[1:41:48] Yeah, that that's right. Brother
[1:41:50] Brandham says he wants to impregnate.
[1:41:53] Now, now when you receive the Holy
[1:41:55] Ghost, you that's not that's you're not
[1:41:58] giving birth. You're receiving the
[1:42:00] birth.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE RECEIVING THE HOLY GHOST. THERE
[1:42:03] IS SOMETHING THAT IS IGNITED IN YOUR
[1:42:05] SOUL. YOU'RE BORN AGAIN. WHY ARE WE born
[1:42:09] again? SO THAT WE CAN BE IMPREGNATED BY
[1:42:14] GOD. AND HIS WORDS LIVE THROUGH us
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; and become manifest through us.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Am I doing all right here this morning?
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I hope I hope I hope I
[1:42:28] hope this gets you. I hope this gets you
[1:42:30] right where it needs to get you.
[1:42:32] Hallelujah.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. RIGHT THERE WHERE WHERE I HAVEN'T
[1:42:36] I can say, God, here I am. Amen. Would
[1:42:39] you receive the Holy Ghost? That's just
[1:42:41] the beginning. That's not the ending.
[1:42:43] That's not the ending of all things.
[1:42:45] YOU'RE JUST BORN AGAIN SO YOU CAN ACCEPT
[1:42:47] THE THINGS OF GOD.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; You're you're YOU YOU JUST BECOME BORN
[1:42:51] AGAIN SO THAT THE SEEDS OF GOD CAN COME
[1:42:53] INTO YOUR LIFE and live and manifest
[1:42:57] deity. Oh, can you say amen?
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; I SAID HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; GOD COULD HAVE CHOSEN THE SUN TO PREACH.
[1:43:05] HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN THE MOON TO PREACH.
[1:43:06] HE COULD HAVE USED THE SOLAR SYSTEM. HE
[1:43:08] COULD HAVE USED THE ANIMAL LIFE. HE HE
[1:43:10] COULD HAVE HE COULD HAVE YOU DONE THE
[1:43:12] ANGELS. He could have done that, but he
[1:43:15] didn't. Amen. Why? Because the angels He
[1:43:18] wasn't carrying angels in his in his
[1:43:20] body.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; He wasn't carrying the sun and moon in
[1:43:22] his body. He created those things, but
[1:43:25] there was only one that he was carrying
[1:43:26] in his body.
[1:43:28] That's his bride.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Amen. When God
[1:43:34] used the when God used the type, he says
[1:43:36] he couldn't kill Sarah because she was
[1:43:38] part of Abraham. She was part of him.
[1:43:42] Amen. Though Sarah strug Well, praise
[1:43:44] the Lord. And then he says, "And God
[1:43:46] cannot KILL HIS BRIDE. HE CANNOT BRING
[1:43:48] JUDGMENT ON HIS BRIDE." AMEN. YOU HAVE
[1:43:51] TO
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU [screaming] WERE INCLUDED IN
[1:43:55] THAT PROMISE.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why Amen. that
[1:44:03] that in the invisible UNION OF THE
[1:44:05] BRIDE. BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY,
[1:44:07] "AMEN, that you've got TO BE CAREFUL
[1:44:09] BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN A WOMB. YOU'VE
[1:44:12] BEEN GIVEN A SACRED TRUST AND YOU JUST
[1:44:14] AS A A NATURAL WOMAN, AS YOU WOMEN HAVE
[1:44:17] GOT TO KEEP YOUR VIRTUES,
[1:44:20] you've got TO KEEP YOUR VIRTUES ONLY TO
[1:44:22] YOUR HUSBAND AND NOT COMMIT ADULTERY."
[1:44:25] HE SAID, "SO MUST THE bride
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; keep her womb."
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. unadulterated
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; because God,
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; he said, "What a sacred trust. What a
[1:44:42] sacred responsibility to a woman." Now,
[1:44:44] you see, she's a type of the church.
[1:44:46] Amen. You see why she's a type of the
[1:44:48] church, which is is the same
[1:44:50] responsibility. A woman has a sacred
[1:44:51] responsibility to her motherhood, her
[1:44:53] virtues, to her husband. The church has
[1:44:55] a sacred responsibility to prayer, to
[1:44:57] the word, to Christ, the same as the
[1:44:59] woman has. Amen. On doubt he says she's
[1:45:02] a type. SHE HAS THE SAME PRECIOUS VERSE
[1:45:06] USED by the spirit given TO HER TO
[1:45:09] PRESERVE THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD.
[1:45:12] Somebody say to preserve
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; the spirit and the word and never commit
[1:45:17] adultery with anything of the world or
[1:45:19] anything. Stay virgin to the word as a
[1:45:23] woman IS TO STAY VIRTUOUS TO HER
[1:45:25] HUSBAND. IT'S A SACRED TRUST TO honor
[1:45:28] her Lord's word above every man-made
[1:45:31] creed, wisdom, denomination there is.
[1:45:33] The church has been given that creed.
[1:45:37] Can you say amen? Amen. The spoken
[1:45:39] word's original seed. He would say
[1:45:40] Christ has TAKEN HIMSELF THAT BRIDE TO
[1:45:43] BE PREGNANT WITH HIS OWN SEED WORD IN
[1:45:46] HER [screaming] WOMB IN her mind.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. M
[1:45:54] now I want to deal with this a minute.
[1:45:56] Now he's he's pulled you out. He's
[1:45:59] justified you, sanctified you, given you
[1:46:01] that. Now he's created himself
[1:46:06] this bride
[1:46:10] and only through you is the supernatural
[1:46:12] going to be expressed.
[1:46:14] That's the reason why we don't believe
[1:46:16] doctor's reports over God's reports.
[1:46:18] That's the reason why we don't believe
[1:46:20] what we see in our family. If someone's
[1:46:22] going astray, we we count that not. We
[1:46:25] look not at the deadness of Sarah's
[1:46:27] womb. We look at God's word.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; We're not going to look at anything
[1:46:32] else. That's the reason why, Amen. When
[1:46:34] we when we're when we're going through
[1:46:36] our our valleys and it SEEMS LIKE GOD IS
[1:46:38] SO FAR AWAY FROM us and it seems LIKE IT
[1:46:41] SEEMS LIKE WE'RE SO DRY, WE ARE NOT
[1:46:44] GOING TO CONSIDER THE DEADNESS OF OUR
[1:46:47] WOMB. WE ARE CONSECRATED TO GOD.
[1:46:49] [screaming]
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; WE'RE KEEPING THAT MIND PURE. FOR
[1:46:53] KEEPING THAT BECAUSE I [screaming] AM
[1:46:55] HIS BRIDE
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; AND HE WANTS TO IMPREGNATE ME WITH THE
[1:47:02] ORIGINAL SEED WHICH IS HIS WORD.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; HE'S NEVER HAD A woman that he could
[1:47:07] impregnate himself with. Eve committed
[1:47:09] adultery and brought us all down.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Adam was to speak he was to speak the
[1:47:16] creative word of God. He was in the
[1:47:18] image of God.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; She was the womb. She children were to
[1:47:23] come forth through the womb of of of Eve
[1:47:27] without without sorrow.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; He was to speak and it was to happen.
[1:47:35] Well, praise the Lord. Now, here we are
[1:47:37] today. We're still in our We're still in
[1:47:39] this this fallen flesh,
[1:47:43] but God's got a creation on the inside
[1:47:45] of you.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; There's a soul that is made in his
[1:47:48] image. You are the feminist side of God.
[1:47:51] God speaks his word. It comes INTO YOUR
[1:47:54] MIND, DROPS DOWN INTO YOUR SOUL, AND
[1:47:57] THINGS TAKE PLACE. GOD'S WORD IS A SEED.
[1:48:00] GOD'S WORD MUST LIVE. GOD'S WORD CAN
[1:48:03] ONLY BE EXPRESSED THROUGH HIS BRIDE.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense here this morning?
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A [screaming] VIRGIN
[1:48:15] IS CARRYING CHILD TODAY.
[1:48:19] THE [screaming] VIRGIN WOMAN, A VIRGIN
[1:48:21] MARY IS CARRYING THE PROMISES OF GOD.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; In you,
[1:48:31] you are carrying the promise
[1:48:34] of a rapture.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; And all you can say is,
[1:48:41] "I don't know how this is going to
[1:48:42] happen,
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; but here I am.
[1:48:46] That's right.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? WE LOOK WE SAY
[1:48:50] [laughter]
[1:48:51] I DON'T HALLELUJAH. But there there's a
[1:48:53] pull on the inside. There's something on
[1:48:55] me as as as as as brother Brennham was
[1:48:58] talking about Mary when God put those
[1:49:00] holy thoughts in the in the heart of
[1:49:03] Mary and begin to have her think and
[1:49:06] prepare IN HER HEART PREPARING HER WOMB.
[1:49:10] Brother Brandham said God knew who the
[1:49:14] woman would be. THE VERY DAY THAT ISAIAH
[1:49:17] SAID, "A VIRGIN shall conceive," God
[1:49:20] knew her name was Mary. God knew when
[1:49:22] she was going to have that child.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; And then God be to prepare the womb.
[1:49:31] Womb womb. Womb. God be to prepare this.
[1:49:36] [snorts]
[1:49:38] Her thoughts become holy. Her thoughts
[1:49:40] begin to God begin to I wonder who that
[1:49:43] virgin would be.
[1:49:46] I wonder as the as the kids enacted the
[1:49:49] other day, [sighs] I what was it? It was
[1:49:53] holy desires
[1:49:55] calling her,
[1:49:57] preparing her because God was fixing to
[1:50:01] do something supernatural in her.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; What has God [laughter] What has God
[1:50:07] been doing in this last day? Send a
[1:50:09] prophet our way which is a lot higher
[1:50:11] than the angels. Yeah.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; A prophet's word is a lot higher than
[1:50:15] the angel's words.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; A prophet comes and what's he doing?
[1:50:20] Preparing our hearts. Preparing our
[1:50:23] hearts. There's seed that must come
[1:50:24] forth there that there's something that
[1:50:26] has to happen. Get ready. YOU'RE HIS
[1:50:29] BRIDE. HE'S PREPARING YOU. ARE YOU
[1:50:31] HEARING ME? AND THE WORD. WHAT ARE WE
[1:50:33] DOING? WE'RE SEPARATING FROM ALL
[1:50:35] UNBELIEF. We are not going to commit
[1:50:37] adultery against the word. We're
[1:50:39] standing there. AMEN. WE CAME FROM
[1:50:42] [screaming] GOD. OUR DESIRES ARE HIS.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Now Christ is taking
[1:50:56] himself a bride to pregnant with his own
[1:50:58] seed word in her womb, the spirit womb
[1:51:01] in her mind. Don't mix it with
[1:51:04] denominational trash. She's a virgin to
[1:51:06] him." Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother
[1:51:10] Brandham would say in another place,
[1:51:11] Mary, the mother of Jesus in the city of
[1:51:13] Nazareth, the meanest city uh that there
[1:51:16] was in the land, but out there uh God
[1:51:20] chose a little lady to give birth to a
[1:51:22] son, an incubator, a womb. Amen. A baby
[1:51:25] had to be born by and he took such a
[1:51:28] person to do it. AND GOD WORKS THROUGH
[1:51:31] HUMAN beings to redeem human beings. He
[1:51:33] can take you and work through you to
[1:51:35] redeem humanity. you if you'll
[1:51:38] completely dedicate everything you are.
[1:51:41] If you're a young woman, dedicate your
[1:51:43] morals. You're a young man, DEDICATE
[1:51:45] YOUR MORALS. DEDICATE YOUR MIND.
[1:51:48] DEDICATE YOUR THINKING. DEDICATE YOUR
[1:51:50] HEART. DEDICATE YOUR SOUL. DEDICATE ALL
[1:51:53] you are. And let Christ work through
[1:51:57] that.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY, "BE IT UNTO me
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; according to thy word."
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, can you say amen?
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming]
[1:52:09] DON'T YOU SEE IT? AREN'T YOU WANTING TO
[1:52:10] SHOUT HALLELUJAH RIGHT NOW?
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. WELL, [applause] he
[1:52:16] said, "Yeah, but you sort of prompted
[1:52:17] that one." AMEN. HALLELUJAH. THERE'S
[1:52:20] SOMETHING IN IN IN it in in the Eve
[1:52:24] that's looking back at her Adam and
[1:52:26] saying, "Oh, I came from you. I'm
[1:52:29] complete in you." Yeah.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Well, it should be that way today
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; with you wives to your husbands.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just look at him with those. Every
[1:52:42] time you look at him, your eyes just
[1:52:44] start going every which direction.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Michael amens it. You know it's
[1:52:56] the truth. Amen.
[1:53:00] That's right.
[1:53:04] But the first man, Adam,
[1:53:07] and we understand that his wife did not
[1:53:09] keep her womb. You say, "Now, now,
[1:53:13] Brother Window, you're you're mixing the
[1:53:14] natural with the spirit." Brother
[1:53:15] Brandham says she fell
[1:53:20] a long time before she committed
[1:53:22] adultery.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:53:27] The sin nature came in then,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; not after the act.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; She gave birth to a thought that was
[1:53:40] contrary to his word.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Let's not give birth.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, everyone has a mind, but
[1:53:49] you're the only one of the new
[1:53:51] creation."
[1:53:54] Yes, sir.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; His word can't pregnantate those guys
[1:53:56] out there. It'll neverate a rapture.
[1:53:58] It'll never A prophet's word could only
[1:54:00] come to those who God has predestinated
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; and that seed drops into your heart.
[1:54:09] Now, it don't matter. It don't matter.
[1:54:11] Most most promises of God are so out
[1:54:12] there that you can't do anything about
[1:54:14] it. You You couldn't make it happen in
[1:54:16] the first place. And that's the reason
[1:54:17] why we ain't trying to work up. We ain't
[1:54:20] trying to make jump and shout, dance. We
[1:54:22] ain't trying to do none of that. And
[1:54:23] though I believe in it all, I love
[1:54:25] dancing. I love shouting. I love crying.
[1:54:27] I love it all. But listen, I'm not doing
[1:54:30] that to try to bring God's presence
[1:54:32] down. I am not. I am here saying, GOD,
[1:54:36] YOU STARTED THE work and you're going to
[1:54:38] complete THE WORK. YOU'VE GIVEN ME A
[1:54:40] PROMISE. AND MY JOB, MY ONLY JOB,
[1:54:42] SOMEBODY SAY, MY ONLY JOB IS TO BELIEVE
[1:54:46] WHAT HE SAID. AMEN.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; MY ONLY JOB IS TO LOVE HIM. [screaming]
[1:54:51] HONOR HIS WORD. HONOR HIS COMMITMENT TO
[1:54:55] ME AND SAY, "I BELIEVE YOU."
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO THE LAMB OF GOD AND HIS SEED
[1:55:03] WILL COME TO PASS IN your life.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham, he's taking the
[1:55:09] natural and the spiritual. Now, he would
[1:55:11] say that c can I have just a few more
[1:55:13] minutes?
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "You'll notice how
[1:55:16] that Eve was united with Adam. She
[1:55:18] become part of him." Did you notice she
[1:55:20] he created man male and female he
[1:55:23] created he them
[1:55:26] both male and female? Man was both male
[1:55:28] and female when it come to being in the
[1:55:31] uh spirit of feminist and masculine.
[1:55:35] Then God took from the from his side.
[1:55:37] Did you notice the body part was a
[1:55:39] byproduct but not the spirit.
[1:55:42] The body part of the woman was a was a
[1:55:44] byproduct. After the creation had been
[1:55:46] finished, God had taken the side of the
[1:55:48] atom of Adam, a ri.
[1:55:52] But not the spirit. The spirit was the
[1:55:54] part of Adam. For he was both man and
[1:55:56] woman
[1:55:58] spiritually speaking, masculine and
[1:56:00] feminine. Now, do you see the great
[1:56:02] picture? WE IN FLESH ARE DIFFERENT.
[1:56:05] WE'RE LIKE A byproduct created by holy
[1:56:07] wedlock in the natural. BUT IN THE
[1:56:10] SPIRIT WE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS, NOT
[1:56:13] some other spirit, the spirit of the
[1:56:14] living God. We are in his likeness, in
[1:56:16] his unity, in his perfect image of the
[1:56:19] living God, which makes uh because we
[1:56:21] become sons and daughters, not
[1:56:23] separated, the same spirit, same God,
[1:56:26] same person. We've been joined in
[1:56:28] wedlock to the eternal. You see how God
[1:56:32] planned it that we should be not
[1:56:36] different, but we should be him.
[1:56:40] Can you say
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Do you love it? He says on the day of
[1:56:44] Pentecost
[1:56:45] is let's see here not some other being
[1:56:48] of some other tribe but a real union the
[1:56:50] offspring of the almighty God by a holy
[1:56:52] union. Amen. Now the body comes from a
[1:56:55] mother and a father but the spirit come
[1:56:56] from God and God separated himself as
[1:56:59] Adam was separated. And on the day of
[1:57:00] Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the
[1:57:02] pillar of fire SEPARATING ITSELF SETTING
[1:57:05] UPON each member of that church. God
[1:57:08] putting himself together. I just love
[1:57:11] that. God putting himself together.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; God putting himself together. Bride.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? God creating a
[1:57:22] bride. Members of the bride. AMEN. GOD
[1:57:26] PUTTING HIMSELF TOGETHER. Then with that
[1:57:29] group of people together, what does it
[1:57:31] do? IT BRINGS BACK the unified body of
[1:57:34] the Lord Jesus.
[1:57:37] TODAY IN THIS GREAT SEPARATION THAT
[1:57:38] WE'RE LIVING IN DENOMINATIONAL
[1:57:40] differences and things and what a pity
[1:57:41] and what a disgrace, but we're joined in
[1:57:43] heavenly wedlock to the eternal God.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Someone shout hallelujah.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:57:52] HIS ACHIEVEMENT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.
[1:57:54] HE'S GOT A BRIDE THAT HE WANTS TO HAVE
[1:57:56] PREEMINENCE in that's going to take his
[1:57:59] word.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, these are the the these are
[1:58:06] two crazy uh uh uh Christmas messages,
[1:58:11] but I I I just wanted to this this is
[1:58:14] what Christmas should mean to us
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; is let his word be born in me.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Let his word be born in me. See, in
[1:58:22] Pentecost, we we we we we received the I
[1:58:25] I I believe I received the Holy Ghost. I
[1:58:28] just I just believe that the Holy Ghost
[1:58:29] within me led me to this message. Yes,
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; I just do.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; But all my jumping and shouting and even
[1:58:38] all all of those manifestations, are you
[1:58:40] even healings and miracles? [snorts]
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Just something was missing.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; But when that message came,
[1:58:50] it anchored me.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I came from him.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; That's where I came from. I didn't come
[1:58:54] from the shouting.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Shouting's part of it.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Sons of God shouts.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; I didn't come from the miracles.
[1:59:00] Miracles part of it. Sons of God
[1:59:02] performs miracles. I came from the word.
[1:59:06] [applause]
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. The word
[1:59:09] WAS MADE FLESH.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? HALLELUJAH. DON'T
[1:59:14] YOU JUST LOVE HIM?
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? See this here?
[1:59:18] HERE HERE'S THE DEAL. WHEN [screaming]
[1:59:20] GOD COME TO THE BREAD WOULD SAY, "AMEN.
[1:59:22] WE WE'VE BEEN, you know, been been
[1:59:23] hitting along the Who is this? Melzdc."
[1:59:25] But but we we we we've been looking at
[1:59:27] the when WE LOOKED THERE AT THE uh uh
[1:59:31] here here come this this great eternal
[1:59:34] one.
[1:59:36] Amen. It was and he just had his the
[1:59:39] attributes the thoughts of God. They
[1:59:42] were the eternal thoughts of God. Is
[1:59:45] that right?
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; And then he come into the word form.
[1:59:51] Amen. Jesus
[1:59:54] took on that that theophony of the word
[1:59:57] that word form and then he become flesh.
[2:00:00] Well, brother Brandham says now that was
[2:00:02] Christ. He said there was the the
[2:00:03] attributes the thoughts then he become
[2:00:06] the word.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. The logos he could he could he
[2:00:10] could appear to Abraham. He can and then
[2:00:12] he then he come in the body of Jesus
[2:00:14] Christ. Is that right?
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; He says now we were his thoughts at the
[2:00:20] beginning. We were there, but we skipped
[2:00:24] the WORD PART, THE THEOPHONY PART, THE
[2:00:27] ONE THAT knows that can. We just come to
[2:00:30] flesh to be tempted and tested to
[2:00:33] believe.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; But now we're going back to the word.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; We were thoughts,
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; flesh, and now we're going to the word.
[2:00:41] Jesus was thoughts, word, flesh.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[2:00:50] THAT'S WHY IN THE LAST DAY, GOD HAD TO
[2:00:52] SEND US A PROPHET WITH THE WORD BECAUSE
[2:00:54] THERE'S A BRIDE WHO CAN BE IMPREGNATED
[2:00:57] WITH THAT WORD. AND SHE'S GOING TO
[2:00:59] PRODUCE THE WORD. SHE'S GOING TO PRODUCE
[2:01:02] A BODY CHANGE. SHE'S GOING TO PRODUCE
[2:01:04] THE MILLENNIUM. SHE'S GOING TO PRODUCE
[2:01:06] AMEN. BRAND NEW BODIES.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; We're pregnant.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; All right. If the musicians would come,
[2:01:16] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:20] HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:22] [applause]
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; A LAVISH LOVE AFFAIR IS WHAT THIS IS.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; It's a love affair.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Well, why would he call you his bride if
[2:01:31] it wasn't a lavish one? Come on.
[2:01:34] Hallelujah. If I can't if I can't enjoy
[2:01:37] my wife, there's times I don't. But
[2:01:39] there but
[2:01:42] and there's times she don't. But I'm
[2:01:43] telling you, our love together, we we we
[2:01:46] love one another. and and and if I had
[2:01:49] to go through life
[2:01:53] mad at her or her going through life
[2:01:55] mad, man, it would just be rough. She's
[2:01:57] my best friend. I love her. I mean, I
[2:02:01] love her.
[2:02:04] You love me. Amen. All right. Good.
[2:02:12] And baby, when I kiss, I I I I kiss with
[2:02:16] intent. That ain't little They ain't
[2:02:19] little pecs. I I love my wife.
[2:02:23] [laughter]
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Why can't we have that kind of a love
[2:02:27] relationship with God?
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; I come for I love him. I I I I love him
[2:02:32] with all of my heart. I love him. Is
[2:02:35] that right?
[2:02:43] Brother Brandon would say
[2:02:50] this is God's mystery
[2:02:52] of love
[2:02:54] expressed.
[2:02:59] Are you Am I making sense as far as the
[2:03:01] Godhead? This is not This is God. This
[2:03:05] is the only God
[2:03:10] who had masculine
[2:03:13] and feminism. Vivish,
[2:03:18] he expressed it through the man Jesus
[2:03:20] Christ.
[2:03:24] When he placed it all in him, then out
[2:03:28] of that Christ has come the bride.
[2:03:36] I believe miracles are in the making.
[2:03:40] You know why? Because a bride is not
[2:03:43] going to see herself as a The
[2:03:45] bride's going to see herself as the only
[2:03:48] lover of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; going to see himself.
[2:03:57] He can impregnate you with a word right
[2:03:59] now.
[2:04:03] You can give [music] birth.
[2:04:09] Let him do it.
[2:04:13] The prophet said the bride can't the the
[2:04:14] bride can't do nothing without him.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; He's the life.
[2:04:20] She's the womb.
[2:04:30] Well, do you love him?
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; All right. I I hope I I hope this is
[2:04:34] okay here. I can say I want to have a
[2:04:37] child. I'm going to have a child, but I
[2:04:40] can't have a child.
[2:04:43] My wife [music] could say, "I'm going to
[2:04:44] have a baby." H I'm going to have a
[2:04:47] baby. She ain't doing it without me.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; But together,
[2:04:58] GOD HAS ALL [screaming] OF THE LIFE.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; He's looking for He's looking for a
[2:05:07] [music] heart
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; that'll open it up and say, "Here I am.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Here I am.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Drop your life in my mind. Drop your
[2:05:17] life down into my heart." Are Are y'all
[2:05:20] saying it takes It takes mother and
[2:05:23] father. It can't be mama by herself.
[2:05:25] Can't be daddy by himself. It takes a
[2:05:27] holy union.
[2:05:29] And God has so designed this that he
[2:05:32] CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF.
[2:05:37] HE CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF [music]
[2:05:40] without his lady.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Praise [laughter] the Lord. So, you know
[2:05:52] what? YOU YOU KNOW WHAT MY JOB IS? MY
[2:05:54] JOB IS TO LOVE HIM, to honor him, to
[2:05:56] give him Hallelujah. Just like Just like
[2:05:59] you do to your husbands. You You honor
[2:06:02] him and you love him and you respect
[2:06:04] him. YOU YOU YOU RESPECT HIS WORD. AMEN.
[2:06:09] THAT MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING,
[2:06:11] BUT YOU BUT YOU BUT YOU YOU'RE TRUSTING
[2:06:13] him as your leader. [music]
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; And he can only he can only be a man as
[2:06:20] you give him that right. He can only
[2:06:22] feel like a man as you give him that
[2:06:24] right. It requires you.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; But when we come in and say, "Here I am,
[2:06:31] Lord.
[2:06:33] I [music] know you've got this."
[2:06:37] And then you go acting like you know
[2:06:38] he's got it. And you confessing like
[2:06:41] he's got it. And you're believing like
[2:06:44] he's [music] got it.
[2:06:48] God looks down to you. Jesus Jesus looks
[2:06:50] at you and go hey that's my girl. Is
[2:06:55] that right? [music]
[2:06:57] H that's my that's my baby.
[2:07:01] That right?
[2:07:03] You see he says it's [music] the mystery
[2:07:07] of great love expressed
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; the husband
[2:07:12] and the wife.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Well glory
[2:07:19] Merry Christmas. Amen.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; What are we playing [music] there,
[2:07:24] Brother Kobe?
[2:07:26] That your word be born
[2:07:30] in the manger.
[2:07:35] Let it live [music] in me.
[2:07:39] Let it scar.
[2:07:43] Live inside this [music] house of clay
[2:07:48] and mold me every day.
[2:07:52] Let your word be born in the manger.
[2:08:04] It was a tiny simple stable
[2:08:08] [music] all beaten
[2:08:10] and worn.
[2:08:12] so unlikely
[2:08:14] a [singing and music] place
[2:08:16] for his word to be born.
[2:08:21] He didn't choose [music and singing]
[2:08:22] some place special
[2:08:25] to reveal his majesty.
[2:08:31] Give him control.
[2:08:34] He'll be born.
[2:08:38] Let your word
[2:08:44] In the manger [music and singing] of
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; let it live.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing and music]
[2:08:56] live inside this house [music]
[2:08:58] of clay
[2:09:01] and mold me every day.

[2:09:09] in the manger.
[2:09:12] [music]
[2:09:17] Oh, [singing] outwardly I'm nothing,
[2:09:21] not much to behold.
[2:09:25] So unlikely
[2:09:27] [singing] the place
[2:09:29] for your word to unfold.
[2:09:33] But if I [music]
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; and let him
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; let him [singing] have his way.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; I know. I know.

[2:11:39] as I lift
[2:11:43] my hands.
[2:11:46] [music and singing]
[2:11:51] [music and singing]
[2:11:57] me. [music and singing]
[2:11:59] Holy
[2:12:01] Spirit,
[2:12:03] flow.
[2:12:09] Flow through me.
[2:12:13] Holy
[2:12:15] [singing and music] Spirit,
[2:12:17] flow
[2:12:19] through me,
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; God. Here I am.
[2:12:23] I'll let you do a miracle in me.
[2:12:27] I I'll accept your [music] You can do a
[2:12:30] miracle in me.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Just plant your seed [music] right here
[2:12:36] in my womb right now.
[2:12:39] Hallelujah. I've been created for this.
[2:12:44] Been created for this. Hallelujah.
[2:12:48] Oh,
[2:12:50] to magnify.
[2:12:53] [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:13:01] Holy. [music and singing]
[2:13:05] Now, now listen. I know. I know. I know
[2:13:07] this morning is is, you know, it's
[2:13:09] simple
[2:13:12] and and my my my thoughts are is this
[2:13:15] right here.
[2:13:19] the connection
[2:13:21] the connection of this this virgin
[2:13:23] [music] birth where the we're virgin to
[2:13:26] nothing but his word
[2:13:29] and I want you to take that home because
[2:13:32] sometimes when you're in prayer you're
[2:13:33] feeling
[2:13:35] just you know Satan fights us all in
[2:13:38] prayer. He fights us all in prayer. He
[2:13:41] really he really does it. And again the
[2:13:43] prophet of God says
[2:13:48] if he can't destroy the word [music] he
[2:13:51] will try to destroy the vessel in which
[2:13:54] the word dwells.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; So he can't destroy the word.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; So he [music] he works on you. And if he
[2:14:04] can get that element of unbelief.
[2:14:09] So, so what we've got to do is we've got
[2:14:11] we Listen, I don't care what it is.
[2:14:14] Leave out this building here this
[2:14:16] morning.
[2:14:17] Leave out this building. And I don't
[2:14:19] care. I I don't care if we're needing if
[2:14:21] we're [music] needing a new liver or if
[2:14:23] we're needing healed from cancer or if
[2:14:25] we're needing healed from
[2:14:27] whatever it is.
[2:14:30] If God drops those desires in our
[2:14:32] hearts, and it's strange [music] how God
[2:14:34] does it, but he does. He he he'll drop
[2:14:36] that little something down and and
[2:14:39] [music] begins to move. He and it's that
[2:14:42] way even in prayer when when the Lord is
[2:14:44] is is wanting to call you into a deeper
[2:14:46] prayer. All of a sudden, you wake up one
[2:14:48] morning and there's this little [music]
[2:14:50] something here that's
[2:14:52] I really
[2:14:54] I'm needing to talk to the Lord. He's
[2:14:57] dropping that in your in your heart cuz
[2:15:00] he's usually wanting to impregnate that
[2:15:01] heart with something.
[2:15:04] And so those those times alone with him
[2:15:07] [music] is important.
[2:15:09] Amen. Because we never know when that
[2:15:11] exact time's going to come when his Holy
[2:15:13] [music] Spirit just comes down in our
[2:15:14] heart.
[2:15:17] Something you've been believing for for
[2:15:18] a long time. They've been waiting. They
[2:15:20] had been waiting for 800 years for the
[2:15:22] Messiah to be born.
[2:15:26] But something started stirring strangely
[2:15:28] in Mary.
[2:15:30] Something strange. Is [music] there
[2:15:32] something stirring strangely in you
[2:15:33] lately? Is something stirring you? Is
[2:15:36] something even even for the rapture? Is
[2:15:38] there something [music] beginning to
[2:15:40] really stir you? It's it's that's the
[2:15:42] way God works.
[2:15:44] He's calling [music] us closer in the
[2:15:46] little areas of our lives.
[2:15:50] That's that's his word. That's he he's
[2:15:53] he's wanting [music] you to prepare the
[2:15:56] bedding grounds, as the prophet of God
[2:15:58] would say, prepare the ground
[2:16:01] for the seed to drop in.
[2:16:08] When using Mary, he said, "Now, see,
[2:16:10] Mary wasn't running around flirting with
[2:16:12] [music] the boys and doing all of this.
[2:16:13] Mary, there was something about Mary.
[2:16:16] she had, bought it, prepared her heart
[2:16:20] to receive that word.
[2:16:24] I I just I just can't help but believe
[2:16:26] [music] that we're a people of prepared
[2:16:28] hearts.
[2:16:30] Some someone told me, "Well, we don't we
[2:16:32] don't need to see the miracles." Yes, we
[2:16:33] do need to see the miracles. We're
[2:16:35] created to manifest miracles.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; We're we're we're his bride. We're his
[2:16:43] body.
[2:16:46] We need to see miracles
[2:16:48] and God needs to perform the miracles.
[2:16:51] He needs you to do it.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; You're already a miracle. The very the
[2:16:58] very fact that you're here in Lelay Osa
[2:17:00] and have a desire to please him and to
[2:17:02] serve him.
[2:17:04] Are you hearing me? [music] You come
[2:17:06] from him. That's a miracle itself.
[2:17:11] Glory.
[2:17:14] Glory to God. Brother Bradom says Jesus
[2:17:17] done okay until [music] they accepted
[2:17:19] Jesus. You know they Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:17:21] But when he stood up and said
[2:17:24] I and my father are one
[2:17:31] from that day on
[2:17:34] they quit walking [music] with him.
[2:17:37] And I believe God's wanting to hear you
[2:17:39] say that.
[2:17:40] I [singing]
[2:17:42] and my groom. I and my Christ are one.
[2:17:50] He is free to use me. He's free to speak
[2:17:54] through me. Drop that seed. Drop that
[2:17:56] word. I've I've carried enough
[2:17:58] bitterness. I've carried enough this.
[2:18:00] Carried enough that. I I don't I don't
[2:18:01] want that in my womb. I want I want
[2:18:03] nothing but righteousness. I want his
[2:18:05] word.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the famous lines [music]
[2:18:11] here. Amen.
[2:18:15] That that that every one of the messages
[2:18:19] uses it says they will love him
[2:18:23] love his and will have his potentials
[2:18:26] for he is their head and they are his
[2:18:28] subjects subject to his head. Headship
[2:18:31] of Christ was his. Notice the harmony.
[2:18:34] Jesus never did anything until he seen
[2:18:36] the father. The father first showed him
[2:18:38] first
[2:18:40] harmony between God and Christ. So will
[2:18:43] the bride. He shows her his word of
[2:18:45] life. He shows her and she receives it
[2:18:51] and she never doubts it. Nothing can
[2:18:54] harm her, not even death. For if the
[2:18:56] seed be planted, the water will raise it
[2:19:01] again.
[2:19:03] Then I got a great big hallelujah.
[2:19:05] Here's the secret. The word is IN THE
[2:19:09] BRIDE AND THE MIND OF CHRIST TO KNOW
[2:19:12] WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH THE WORD. She
[2:19:14] does it in his name. She has thus sayeth
[2:19:16] the Lord. Then it is grammatized by the
[2:19:20] Holy Spirit. So the Holy Spirit waters
[2:19:22] till it's grown and serves his purpose.
[2:19:24] [music] They do only his will. And he
[2:19:26] says, "Amen, I'll believe that." No one
[2:19:29] can persuade them different. THEY HAVE
[2:19:32] THUS SAYAITH THE LORD or they keep
[2:19:33] still. Then they will do the works of
[2:19:36] God, FOR IT IS HIMSELF in them,
[2:19:39] continuing his word to fulfill as he did
[2:19:42] completing his day all things when he
[2:19:46] was here. He did not complete all when
[2:19:48] he was here, for it was not yet [music]
[2:19:52] time.
[2:19:54] It will now be accomplished
[2:19:56] through his [music] bride.
[2:19:58] All as I lift my hands
[2:20:05] and worship [music]
[2:20:08] and to magnify
[2:20:12] [singing] his name
[2:20:14] flow

[2:20:18] Holy
[2:20:20] Spirit

[2:20:26] SINGING IT WITH REVELATION NOW. All flow
[2:20:31] through [music]

[2:20:38] me this morning.
[2:20:40] Flow through me. [singing]

[2:21:08] and [singing] to magnify.
[2:21:12] Hallelujah.

[2:21:17] through me. [singing]
[2:21:19] Holy
[2:21:21] Spirit,
[2:21:23] flow
[2:21:25] through me.
[2:21:29] God bless you.

[2:23:42] The wind went down.
[2:23:45] Presca, she's the one that sabotaged
[2:23:46] [music] our biscuits.
[2:23:48] I wouldn't doubt.

[2:24:01] and and then we'll put them in there and
[2:24:03] we'll have this all done." Well, somehow
[2:24:05] or another, when those biscuits, they
[2:24:07] were left out or something [music] and
[2:24:09] they were just one big doughy mess.
[2:24:11] Amen. and and we were trying to cook
[2:24:14] breakfast that morning and I could see
