[24:46] option this year and U so we just
[24:49] apologize ahead of time uh we don't we
[24:51] don't know what what the future will
[24:53] hold maybe next year things will be a
[24:54] little bit different but um this year we
[24:57] just this is this is what we've got so
[25:00] can I hear a great big
[25:03] amen all right all right so uh one other
[25:07] thing I want to talk to the non-campers
[25:10] and this is this is going to be a little
[25:12] bit different than any camp that that uh
[25:15] maybe that you've been to um but due to

[26:16] something here and um um but you're not
[26:19] going to be able to eat the delicious
[26:22] camp food and so uh so that's that's

[56:58] this weekend amen if you have your
[57:00] Bibles tonight I know it's the first
[57:01] night we want to go straight to the word
[57:02] of the lord we want to turn to the Book
[57:04] of Matthew The Book of Matthew the 16th
[57:07] chapter and then we're going to go to
[57:09] Proverbs and also the Book of Revelation
[57:12] amen but we want to turn first to
[57:13] Matthew chapter 16 and we want to say
[57:17] Amen we we thank the local church for
[57:19] all the work and effort and amen to put
[57:22] this together and amen I believe the
[57:24] souls of of Believers will be changed
[57:26] here this weekend amen amen Matthew
[57:29] chapter 16 and I want to look in the
[57:32] first verse of Matthew
[57:34] 16 the Bible here says the Pharisees
[57:37] also with the Sadducees came and
[57:40] tempting desired him that he would show
[57:43] them a sign from Heaven he answered and
[57:46] said unto them when it is evening you
[57:48] say it will be fair weather for the sky
[57:50] is red and in the morning it will be
[57:53] foul weather today for the sky is is red
[57:56] and luring oh ye Hypocrites you can
[58:00] discern the face of the sky but you
[58:03] cannot discern the signs of the time
[58:06] look here in verse four a wicked and
[58:10] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[58:13] sign and there shall no sign be given
[58:15] unto it but the sign of the Prophet
[58:17] Jonas and he left them and departed now
[58:21] in the Book of Proverbs the 29th chapter
[58:23] Proverbs 29 I want to look
[58:26] in the 18th verse it's a very familiar
[58:29] reading in Proverbs
[58:32] 29 in verse 18 Solomon here
[58:36] writing he says where there is no vision
[58:41] the people perish but he that keepeth
[58:44] the law happy is he amen where there is
[58:49] no vision the people perish but he that
[58:52] keepeth the law happy is he and one of
[58:55] the place I want to look is in the Book
[58:57] of Revelation The Book of Revelation
[58:59] chapter 10 a very another very familiar
[59:02] scripture I believe it's one of the uh
[59:05] anthems of the Believers in this hour
[59:07] Revelations chapter 10 and verse number
[59:11] s you love the Lord tonight amen but in
[59:15] the days of the voice of the seventh
[59:17] angel when he shall begin to sound
[59:20] somebody say sound when he shall begin
[59:23] to sound the mystery of God
[59:26] should be finished as he ha declared to
[59:29] his servants the prophets the days of
[59:32] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[59:35] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[59:38] should be finished as he has declared to
[59:40] his servants the prophets we ask Lord
[59:43] this evening to add the blessing to the
[59:44] reading of his word as you can have your
[59:46] seats here tonight I I want you by the
[59:48] help of the Lord for just a few moments
[59:51] here this evening if I would if I would
[59:53] take a a title or take a thought with
[59:55] you tonight I want to speak to you for a
[59:57] few moments on this it's time to check
[1:00:00] the spiritual forecast amen it's time to
[1:00:04] check the spiritual forecast I believe
[1:00:06] tonight that we have all gathered here
[1:00:08] amen under great and spiritual
[1:00:10] expectations how many's gathered here
[1:00:12] amen under great and spiritual
[1:00:14] expectations amen not just the
[1:00:16] expectations of a preacher or the
[1:00:18] expectations of a church but we've
[1:00:20] gathered here under spiritual
[1:00:21] expectations which we know amen those
[1:00:24] expectations have to come from God and
[1:00:26] you know as I was just U maybe share a
[1:00:28] little bit of inspiration with you here
[1:00:29] on this thought I just a few weeks ago
[1:00:32] there at my house we were I was doing
[1:00:34] some work in my office and I was
[1:00:35] changing the the flooring there in my
[1:00:37] office and I was actually taking some
[1:00:39] some out putting some new in and there
[1:00:40] was a brother from a church there coming
[1:00:42] over to help me and and I I just thought
[1:00:44] in my mind this is the time to do it
[1:00:46] let's get it done and I was just making
[1:00:48] all these plans and we were going to do
[1:00:49] it on this day and these conditions and
[1:00:51] and I was actually talking to Brother
[1:00:53] John Scott there and he told me he said
[1:00:54] now you you you might need to check he
[1:00:56] said the the forecast he said see if
[1:00:58] it's going to be hot or cold now here
[1:01:00] I'm thinking we're just going to change
[1:01:02] out some floor amen now we're not doing
[1:01:04] anything outside so really how important
[1:01:07] amen is the forecast or the weather
[1:01:10] conditions for a task like this and when
[1:01:12] I looked at the forecast it was going to
[1:01:13] be really cold and he actually said this
[1:01:15] he said you know he said if we put it in
[1:01:17] there and it's too cold the floor won't
[1:01:19] acclimate right so we got to wait till
[1:01:21] the weather's right and as I begin to
[1:01:23] think about that it just struck me amen
[1:01:25] how much a forecast affects amen parts
[1:01:28] of our lives that really our minds will
[1:01:30] never even begin to believe amen that
[1:01:33] that really affects what we're going to
[1:01:34] do and you know when you look here at
[1:01:36] this word forecast it means a prophecy
[1:01:38] or an estimate or it is a prediction of
[1:01:40] a future happening amen or conditions it
[1:01:43] is to predict or to estimate amen a
[1:01:46] future event or Trend now I love this it
[1:01:49] is to indicate as likely to occur amen
[1:01:52] so when you have a forecast you are
[1:01:54] prophesying or you are making a
[1:01:56] declaration that something amen is not
[1:01:59] might happen or could happen but there
[1:02:01] is a very good possibility amen that
[1:02:04] it's going to occur when you look at
[1:02:06] that word forecast amen it means to
[1:02:08] articulate or to calculate the future
[1:02:10] now brother br will say this and we have
[1:02:12] seen his star amen and have come to
[1:02:14] worship Him He said what is a vision a
[1:02:17] vision is the forecast amen of future
[1:02:20] event see it foretells the thing before
[1:02:23] it happens he said that's the way God
[1:02:25] always Vindicated whether it was true or
[1:02:27] not whether the man that was in the Old
[1:02:29] Testament was supposed to be a prophet
[1:02:31] amen what he said come to pass amen then
[1:02:34] they know if this man said this amen it
[1:02:37] kept constantly coming to pass he said
[1:02:40] now that man cannot just be hands laid
[1:02:42] on him or shook up and give a gift see
[1:02:45] he is born with a gift amen it is born
[1:02:48] in him when he's born amen before he's
[1:02:51] born amen so if a prophet amen is a real
[1:02:54] god- sent prophet amen he don't wake up
[1:02:57] one morning and decide amen today I'm
[1:02:59] going to be a prophet amen but before he
[1:03:02] was born God already deposited something
[1:03:05] on the inside of him to make him what
[1:03:07] God ordained him to be Amen in the hour
[1:03:10] that he was living in and I'll just goad
[1:03:11] and say it amen if you are a part of
[1:03:14] this prophecy amen you didn't wake up
[1:03:16] one morning and decide amen I'm going to
[1:03:18] be a part of the Bride amen but if you
[1:03:21] ever was a Son of God Amen you always
[1:03:23] were a Son of God if you ever was a
[1:03:26] daughter of God you always were a
[1:03:27] daughter of God Amen God already
[1:03:30] predicted what you would be amen before

[1:03:46] amen every day it comes day by day fresh
[1:03:49] and so it has amen Through the Ages

[1:03:54] justification when ley's manner was the
[1:03:56] manifestation of sanctification amen
[1:03:59] Pentecostal was the restoration of the
[1:04:01] gifts he said but this is introducing
[1:04:04] amen The Headstone the last day the brid
[1:04:07] tree amen which is contrary to all of it
[1:04:09] see amen it's the same light for the
[1:04:12] matured he said you cannot go against
[1:04:14] God's nature he's got a law and to
[1:04:16] contrary that amen will kill your plant

[1:04:22] spoken laws amen and his laws is his
[1:04:25] word word amen can I say this his vision
[1:04:28] is his word amen his forecast is his
[1:04:31] word and any law is a word spoken and a
[1:04:34] word is a thought manifested see amen
[1:04:36] now we know that's the truth amen a
[1:04:39] vision is what it's the word of God or
[1:04:42] something foretold amen or a forecast of
[1:04:45] an event and the vision that the
[1:04:47] prophets had Jesus had Paul had all of
[1:04:50] them amen tell of this day amen was a
[1:04:53] forecast of what would happen and here
[1:04:55] see the forecast being made manifest
[1:04:58] amen and people don't even recognize it

[1:05:11] it or not amen Ezekiel and Moses and
[1:05:13] Jeremiah amen they spoke of you and they
[1:05:16] spoke of this meeting amen because it
[1:05:18] was not the ideas of a man it was the
[1:05:20] forecast of God listen God was going to
[1:05:23] do something and he wanted somebody to
[1:05:26] witness what he was going to do in the
[1:05:28] hour he was going to do it I say this
[1:05:30] God has g a forecast for this meeting
[1:05:32] this weekend amen God is going to heal

[1:05:41] somebody is going to get the Holy Ghost
[1:05:44] the forecast to this meeting said
[1:05:46] somebody is going to meet God in a way
[1:05:49] that they've never met him before hey
[1:05:51] this is more than just a bunch of board
[1:05:52] and Camp directors amen putting an
[1:05:54] agenda together this is a prophesied
[1:05:57] agenda of almighty God from before the
[1:06:00] foundation of the world yes sir he said
[1:06:03] I'll begin to notice at the preaching of
[1:06:05] those seven Church Ages which is the
[1:06:07] pattern amen or the forecast of all amen
[1:06:10] that God was going to do for the
[1:06:11] churches amen and through the churches
[1:06:14] amen and positionally setting them up I
[1:06:17] love what he says here in the Old
[1:06:19] Testament alone it's more than 2,000
[1:06:22] times that those prophets said thus
[1:06:25] saith the Lord he said now if a man says
[1:06:28] thus sayith the lord it's not the man
[1:06:30] talking if he would he wouldn't be a
[1:06:33] prophet he'd be a hypocrite see cause it
[1:06:35] would never come to pass there's one
[1:06:37] chance out of 1000,000 times amen see
[1:06:41] they might guess it but if it's thus
[1:06:43] sayith the Lord amen the Lord God has
[1:06:46] said it amen if it's thus saith the Lord
[1:06:50] amen the Lord God has said it listen
[1:06:52] folks this is not amen thus saith Andrew
[1:06:55] cover or thus sayith wend Martin or any
[1:06:57] other preacher amen this is thus saith
[1:07:00] the Lord can I tell you this meeting
[1:07:03] amen is not built upon the shifting
[1:07:05] Sands amen of man's ideas this meeting
[1:07:08] is not built upon the traditions of a
[1:07:10] religion this meeting is built upon thus
[1:07:12] sayith the Lord and I want to tell that
[1:07:15] devil tonight come hell or high water
[1:07:17] we're going to break out of every
[1:07:18] tradition we're going to break out of
[1:07:20] every form we didn't come here for just
[1:07:22] another meeting we come here to step
[1:07:25] into the the position that God give us
[1:07:27] from before the foundation of the world
[1:07:30] if it's thus sayith the Lord God has
[1:07:31] said it and these men being prophets
[1:07:34] they said it's not me I have nothing to
[1:07:36] do with it amen it's thus sayith the
[1:07:39] Lord I love this so the Bible amen is
[1:07:42] thus saith the Lord by the prophets the
[1:07:45] Bible is thus saith the Lord amen by the
[1:07:49] prophets he said notice they took Christ
[1:07:51] Spirit upon themselves and they forecast
[1:07:54] the events that would come to pass he
[1:07:57] said talk about forecast they said what
[1:07:59] would take place down Through the Ages
[1:08:01] as they sat they stood they laid amen
[1:08:04] they walked with the spirit of Christ
[1:08:06] upon them in so much that they acted
[1:08:08] like Christ and the readers would read
[1:08:10] it and they would think that the
[1:08:12] prophets amen was speaking of themselves
[1:08:15] amen they come under such an inspiration
[1:08:18] amen of the prophecy that when they
[1:08:20] begin to say things people actually
[1:08:22] begin to think hey they're not talking
[1:08:24] about somebody else amen they're talking
[1:08:26] about themselves can I tell you Paul
[1:08:29] prophesied I know it's the first night
[1:08:30] but I feel like preaching Paul
[1:08:32] prophesied and he said there's going to
[1:08:33] be somebody alive and remain at the
[1:08:36] coming of the Lord listen Paul's not
[1:08:38] alive tonight amen them Corinthians
[1:08:40] thought he was talking about him but he
[1:08:42] was not talking about them he was
[1:08:44] talking about you who would be alive at
[1:08:47] the time when the headstone would come
[1:08:49] to the church and there would be a bride
[1:08:51] on the earth who would move from
[1:08:52] religion and they would move into
[1:08:54] reality they would become the word by
[1:08:57] the message of the hour listen Paul
[1:08:59] wasn't talking about himself he was
[1:09:01] talking about you yes sir amen see what
[1:09:04] it was it was prophecy it came not in
[1:09:07] Old Time by the will of man amen but
[1:09:09] holy men of God spake as they were moved
[1:09:12] by the Holy Ghost somebody say prophecy
[1:09:16] amen prophecy is the Divine mind in the
[1:09:18] message it is the rising of the sun he

[1:09:38] fail if God said somebody was going to
[1:09:40] overcome Le of see it cannot fail if God

[1:12:11] sent a message we're not a bunch of
[1:12:13] church members looking for something to
[1:12:15] wear we have received the message of the
[1:12:17] hour it is the close of the word and a
[1:12:20] prophet said if she'll stand still long
[1:12:22] enough I will dress her in this word

[1:12:30] a bunch of getting together and seeing
[1:12:32] each other there's got a time that this
[1:12:34] Youth Camp becomes the dressing of the
[1:12:36] young people of this generation and
[1:12:39] you're looking at one preacher that will
[1:12:40] not replace Revelation with some feeling
[1:12:43] or some gift or some emotion we have got
[1:12:46] the clothes Amen to wear in this age
[1:12:49] where we will not be identified as a
[1:12:51] layout of sin we will be identified as a
[1:12:53] word born bride I'm sorry I may be in
[1:12:56] Leota but I'm not of
[1:12:59] Leota the Bible speaks of this forecast
[1:13:02] when you think of that when you think of
[1:13:03] that weather forecast in Matthew 16 amen
[1:13:06] as well amen is Luke 12 you see the
[1:13:09] Bible speaking of a weather forecast
[1:13:11] amen spoke of in the Bible amen is
[1:13:13] dealing with the ability Amen to
[1:13:15] forecast the weather amen but they lack
[1:13:18] spiritual discernment amen they're able
[1:13:20] to tell you amen when the evening's
[1:13:22] coming the weather will be fair and when
[1:13:24] it's going to be when it's it's going to
[1:13:25] be stormy the weather will be like this
[1:13:27] but look here amen I'll say this to you
[1:13:29] young people if you're going to make it
[1:13:31] out of Leota you must have spiritual
[1:13:34] discernment if you're going to make it
[1:13:36] out of Satan's heeden you're going to
[1:13:38] have to have spiritual discernment
[1:13:41] that's why Paul said in 1 Corinthians
[1:13:44] 2:14 he said the natural man amen
[1:13:47] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:13:49] of God for they are foolish unto him
[1:13:51] neither can he know them listen because
[1:13:54] they are spiritually discerned when you
[1:13:57] look there at that word spiritually it
[1:13:59] means by the aid of the Holy Ghost when
[1:14:02] you look there at the word discerned it
[1:14:04] means to estimate it means to determine
[1:14:07] the Excellence or defects of any person
[1:14:10] or thing in 2 Timothy 3:5 Paul says they
[1:14:13] will have a form of godliness but they
[1:14:16] will deny amen the power thereof and
[1:14:18] look what he says he says from such turn
[1:14:21] away ream comes along and said Paul
[1:14:23] promised it in the last day by the holy
[1:14:25] spirit that the church would fall away
[1:14:28] millions of them there will come of
[1:14:29] falling away see amen watch the next
[1:14:32] verse they will have a form of godliness
[1:14:34] but they will deny the power thereof he
[1:14:37] said see no spiritual discernment when
[1:14:40] you got spiritual discernment and the
[1:14:42] Holy Ghost is upon you you have
[1:14:45] spiritual discernment and it says Amen
[1:14:48] to every promise amen of God he said
[1:14:51] Paul said those days would be and we've
[1:14:53] got it it's here it's on us and we look
[1:14:56] and see it amen we hear it from
[1:14:58] everywhere amen and what do we do amen
[1:15:01] it ought to draw us together when you
[1:15:04] begin to see these things happening
[1:15:06] that's not the time to pull away and
[1:15:08] take a different direction on the
[1:15:10] message that's the time to come together
[1:15:12] and everybody get under one voice and
[1:15:15] that's not a preacher or a pastor that
[1:15:17] is the seventh angel his name is William
[1:15:19] Mary and brandom and I refuse to
[1:15:22] introduce any other voice to this young
[1:15:24] people of
[1:15:25] we have a voice and it's a Vindicated
[1:15:28] voice and it's a voice of authority it's
[1:15:30] a voice
[1:15:31] of it's a voice of accuracy there's no
[1:15:35] voice amen like that voice there is no
[1:15:38] guesswork in that voice there is no I
[1:15:40] think so I feel so I see so you might be
[1:15:43] know there is thus sayith the Lord or he
[1:15:46] didn't say anything at
[1:15:49] all I say it's time to get away and
[1:15:51] forget man May Theology and cry out to
[1:15:54] God amen for spiritual discernment
[1:15:56] listen this is not the generation that's
[1:15:59] going to go amen into the depths of
[1:16:01] perversion this is the generation that
[1:16:03] is seen the revealing of the son of man
[1:16:06] Jesus prophesied that the conditions of
[1:16:09] Sodom and Gomorrah listen they would
[1:16:11] return in the days when the son of man
[1:16:13] would be revealed when Jesus forecast
[1:16:16] this age he give a forecast of what
[1:16:19] Sodom and Gomorrah would look like he
[1:16:21] said as it was in the days of Sodom he
[1:16:24] said the police and the homicides just
[1:16:26] go on all the time breaking up boys amen
[1:16:29] living together as husband and wife
[1:16:31] women living the same way amen perverted
[1:16:34] amen and their minds are filthy Minds
[1:16:36] now why are their minds filthy because
[1:16:38] they don't have amen spiritual
[1:16:41] discernment all is a lust and a filth
[1:16:44] they can't satisfy themselves even with
[1:16:46] one another see he said they don't marry
[1:16:48] they just take up and go out until
[1:16:50] they're perverted and Jesus said it
[1:16:53] would be in the last days now here's a
[1:16:55] prophet and here it is amen you ever see
[1:16:58] a weather man amen a few days ago in
[1:17:00] Arkansas we had tornadoes come through
[1:17:01] there it took a weather man to stand
[1:17:03] there and say there it is right there it
[1:17:05] is here it's coming it's headed this way
[1:17:08] and a prophet stood in this generation
[1:17:10] and he trace the spirit of perversion
[1:17:12] all the way back to the Garden he traced
[1:17:14] the spirit of perversion all the way
[1:17:16] back to Sodom and Gomorrah and he said
[1:17:18] when you see these things that ain't the
[1:17:20] time to put your head down that's the
[1:17:22] time to put your shouting shoes on
[1:17:24] that's the time time to lift up your
[1:17:25] head for your Redemption is drawing nigh
[1:17:28] listen the whole world may be filthy but
[1:17:31] there's a bride who's going to be clean
[1:17:33] by the blood of Jesus Christ and the
[1:17:35] word of almighty God hey the whole world
[1:17:39] may be headed to Sodom and gor but
[1:17:41] there's another prophecy concerning you
[1:17:44] there's another Vision there's another
[1:17:45] forecast and it's come from the
[1:17:47] revealing of the son of man spiritual
[1:17:51] discernment amen is not guessing what is
[1:17:53] right and what is wrong
[1:17:56] spiritual discernment is standing there
[1:17:59] knowing what is right and what is wrong
[1:18:03] see I'll say this it takes spiritual
[1:18:04] discernment to know what truth is it
[1:18:07] takes spiritual discernment to know what
[1:18:10] error is in John chapter 8 Jesus said he
[1:18:14] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:18:17] make you free not going to set you free
[1:18:20] the truth is going to make you free
[1:18:22] brother said if you see God's word and
[1:18:25] still don't think it's the truth then
[1:18:27] there's something wrong with your
[1:18:29] spiritual discernment 1960 former and
[1:18:32] latter rign any man could read a
[1:18:34] newspaper if he's got any spiritual

[1:18:54] of the Lord Jesus some people go out and
[1:18:56] say oh that might be a thousand years

[1:19:04] coming of the Lord and listen what he

[1:21:33] children to their fathers lest I come
[1:21:35] and smite the Earth with a curse do you
[1:21:38] realize Paul come along in Ephesians
[1:21:40] four and he said he gave some Apostles
[1:21:43] and some prophets and some evangelists
[1:21:45] and some pastors and teacher amen for
[1:21:47] the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:21:49] work of the ministry amen for the
[1:21:52] edifying of the body of Christ till we
[1:21:54] all somebody shout all come into the
[1:21:57] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[1:21:59] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[1:22:02] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:22:04] fullness of Christ now listen I know
[1:22:06] somebody say well this is a youth camp
[1:22:08] so we just need to we just need to get
[1:22:10] an experience I believe in experiences
[1:22:13] but somewhere or another there's got to
[1:22:14] come some word amen over that experience
[1:22:17] to where you can whip the devil when you
[1:22:18] leave Youth Camp listen there's got to
[1:22:20] come somewhere that you come to a
[1:22:22] stability that the first mistake you
[1:22:25] make you ain't got to go get saved again
[1:22:27] and get baptized again you can stand
[1:22:29] there knowing that there is an advocate
[1:22:32] between you and the father and there is
[1:22:33] an atonement listen in other words can I
[1:22:36] just say what brother said an adopted
[1:22:38] church amen a church that knows their
[1:22:41] position in the
[1:22:43] word you say well that's a bunch of
[1:22:45] preachers I beg to differ with you I
[1:22:47] think that's some young men I think
[1:22:49] that's some young ladies I think there's
[1:22:51] some young people right here tonight
[1:22:53] that can meet God this weekend that your
[1:22:55] life will never be the same again I
[1:22:57] believe you can come to such a place of
[1:22:59] stability that the devil can't back you
[1:23:02] up because you know your place in the
[1:23:06] forecast that you would be no more
[1:23:08] children tossed to and fro carried about
[1:23:11] with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate
[1:23:13] of men and cunny craftiness whereby they
[1:23:15] lie and wait to deceive but speaking the
[1:23:18] truth and love that you may grow up into
[1:23:21] him in all things which is the head even
[1:23:25] Christ now brother said if a man comes
[1:23:27] he has a great gift no matter if he
[1:23:29] belongs to our denomination or another
[1:23:31] denomination you don't judge him by what
[1:23:34] denomination he come from how he dresses
[1:23:37] but what you want to see is what is he
[1:23:39] trying to do with his gift what purpose
[1:23:42] he has if he's trying to take his
[1:23:44] influence and build himself a great name
[1:23:46] out of it he said I'd have discernment
[1:23:48] of spirit enough to know amen that's
[1:23:51] wrong no matter how great a teacher is
[1:23:53] how powerful he is is how intellectual
[1:23:55] he is or even how his gift operates if
[1:23:58] he isn't trying to achieve something for
[1:24:00] the benefit of the body of Christ your
[1:24:03] own spiritual discernment would tell you
[1:24:05] that that's wrong no matter how accurate
[1:24:08] how perfect how it is amen if it's wrong
[1:24:11] it isn't useful amen for the body of
[1:24:13] Jesus Christ listen we're not here amen
[1:24:17] trying to build you to myself or to
[1:24:19] build you to brother Timothy or to build
[1:24:21] you to any other preacher I have but one
[1:24:23] motive and one to objective and that is
[1:24:25] to build up your faith in the message of
[1:24:28] the hour and I want to get you so in
[1:24:30] love with this message it don't matter
[1:24:32] what anybody says what anybody teaches
[1:24:34] what anybody thinks you'll stand there
[1:24:37] and say that's not what brother brandham
[1:24:39] said and ask for me in my house we're
[1:24:41] going to serve the Lord come on I tell
[1:24:44] you amen this is more than just young
[1:24:46] people young people grow up and get
[1:24:48] married and young people grow up and get
[1:24:49] married and have kids and start families
[1:24:51] listen I think God can give you such a
[1:24:53] word foundation
[1:24:54] in these youth camps amen that when the
[1:24:56] enemy comes in like a flood hey the
[1:24:59] spirit of the Lord will raise a standard
[1:25:01] against
[1:25:03] him you say why are you saying that
[1:25:05] because this is a Joshua Generation
[1:25:07] Church it's a Joshua generation you know
[1:25:10] what the prophet said he said Joshua was
[1:25:12] the new leader he said and he
[1:25:14] positionally placed amen the tribes of
[1:25:17] Israel and he divided the land of
[1:25:19] inheritance amen by spiritual
[1:25:23] discernment hey Joshua stood there Amen
[1:25:26] brother and he divided the land and he
[1:25:29] placed them by spiritual discernment
[1:25:31] brother says this and there they
[1:25:34] remained in their place and they became
[1:25:37] the cream of the crop Oh Glory when
[1:25:41] Joshua put them in their place by the
[1:25:43] leadership of the Holy Ghost hey they
[1:25:46] remain there and they became the cream
[1:25:49] of the crop you say what is spiritual
[1:25:51] discernment brother REM says it's
[1:25:53] spiritual re reation of God watch what
[1:25:55] he says in Matthew 16 he says flesh and
[1:25:58] blood has not revealed this to you you
[1:26:01] did not learn it through an educational
[1:26:02] line or denominational line see amen
[1:26:05] Flesh and Blood revealed this not to you
[1:26:07] but my Father which is in heaven has
[1:26:10] revealed this to you look and Upon This

[1:26:48] never Prevail he said now watch and see
[1:26:51] where somebody say
[1:26:52] where where the gate G of hell is
[1:26:55] against it's not against denomination
[1:26:57] the government recognizes that the world
[1:27:00] recognizes them we have the right each
[1:27:02] one of us as American citizens have the
[1:27:04] right amen of denomination which is fine
[1:27:06] see but that's not what the gates of
[1:27:08] hell is against and come on somebody

[1:27:31] instruments it's not against this
[1:27:32] microphone it's against the Revelation
[1:27:35] that Jesus Christ is here and he's here
[1:27:39] in bright form he's here in every one of
[1:27:42] you young people he is here amen listen
[1:27:45] I can say what a prophet said that's
[1:27:47] where the church is missing it today
[1:27:49] it's that spiritual discernment to see

[1:27:54] not what God has done brother Matt or
[1:27:57] what God will do amen what is God a

[1:28:06] going on right here listen and it'll be
[1:28:08] past you before you even know it let me
[1:28:11] say what a prophet said about 77 times
[1:28:13] in the message he screams out don't miss
[1:28:17] it he's screaming don't miss it in other
[1:28:20] words they're saying something's coming
[1:28:23] and he's saying don't miss it brother B
[1:28:25] establishes this principle I call them
[1:28:27] spiritual principles amen one of them I
[1:28:30] like is when he says we get what we
[1:28:32] expect what about this one he said man
[1:28:34] is now like he's always been he's
[1:28:37] praising God for what he's done and
[1:28:39] looking forward to what he will do and
[1:28:41] ignoring what he has done and is doing
[1:28:44] he Praises God for what he has done he
[1:28:47] looks forward to what he will do but he
[1:28:50] ignores what God is doing and there he
[1:28:53] misses the whole thing see ignoring what
[1:28:56] he is
[1:28:59] doing you say well he's healing brother
[1:29:02] so and so and he's saving sister so and
[1:29:04] so and he gave so and so the Holy Ghost
[1:29:07] and the power of God fell on brother so
[1:29:09] and so and amen and you're still missing
[1:29:12] what God is doing you say how can you
[1:29:14] say that because you're looking oh God
[1:29:17] how can I say this you're living in the
[1:29:19] moment and looking for something to come
[1:29:22] listen what he said he said he knows
[1:29:23] what has done and he knows the promise
[1:29:26] what he will do but he fails to see what
[1:29:29] he's doing spiritual Amnesia now may he
[1:29:32] and his power come through this audience
[1:29:34] of people wherever you are and with his
[1:29:37] spiritual discernment amen showing you
[1:29:40] that he is the word may our lord Jesus
[1:29:43] the god of the Bible may he come into
[1:29:46] this audience this weekend and may He Go

[1:30:01] realize that this is more than just a
[1:30:03] religion this is more than just a good
[1:30:05] idea this is a vision from almighty
[1:30:09] God this is a forecast and you're in
[1:30:14] it you say brother Andrew we're looking
[1:30:16] for vision let me say this very plainly

[1:30:24] vision Solomon said where there is no
[1:30:26] vision amen the people perish look at
[1:30:29] this word Vision it is an oracle it is a

[1:36:58] prophet said oh my my my my my you say
[1:37:02] preacher you're getting way out there
[1:37:03] well let me just ask you how can you
[1:37:05] have a weather forecast without a
[1:37:07] weather man and how can you have a
[1:37:08] message without a messenger and I might
[1:37:10] as well say it how can you have a
[1:37:12] prophecy without a
[1:37:14] prophet I'm not looking for a prophet
[1:37:17] I'm looking at the prophecy because I've
[1:37:20] already heard the prophet I'm not
[1:37:22] looking for a message message I'm
[1:37:24] looking at the message cuz I've already
[1:37:27] heard the
[1:37:29] messenger surely the Lord God will do
[1:37:32] nothing but he revealeth his Secrets
[1:37:34] unto his servants the prophets I love
[1:37:37] what BR says he said the prophet is a
[1:37:39] special man he's a man of whom the word
[1:37:42] of the Lord comes to because the prophet
[1:37:44] is so designed life that his

[1:42:51] where all the promises God we're laying
[1:42:54] for the Joshua
[1:42:57] generation
[1:42:59] Hallelujah this message somebody shout
[1:43:02] this
[1:43:03] message has become our
[1:43:07] leadership notice here Jesus by the
[1:43:09] spirit in every age addresses himself to
[1:43:10] only one person relevant to the word for
[1:43:13] that age only one messenger for each age
[1:43:17] receives what the spirit has to say to
[1:43:19] that age and that one messenger is the
[1:43:22] messenger to the true
[1:43:24] church because he speaks for God by
[1:43:27] Revelation to the churches both true and
[1:43:30] false now listen the message is then
[1:43:33] broadcast to
[1:43:34] all the message the
[1:43:38] message am I reading that right the
[1:43:42] message is then broadcast to all but
[1:43:45] though it is broadcast for all who come
[1:43:47] within Reign to that message that
[1:43:50] message is received individually by only
[1:43:53] a certain by a certain qualified group
[1:43:56] in a certain way each individual of that
[1:43:59] group is one who has the ability to hear
[1:44:02] what the spirit is saying by way of the
[1:44:05] messenger those who hear now I just got
[1:44:08] to say it those who hear are not getting
[1:44:11] their own private Revelation nor is a
[1:44:14] group getting their Collective
[1:44:15] Revelation but each person that's you
[1:44:18] young people each person is hearing and
[1:44:22] receiving what the meage messenger has
[1:44:25] already received from God I find it
[1:44:28] amazing that when you when you when you
[1:44:30] look at a forecast brother it's usually
[1:44:33] broadcast Amen in a in a in a radio form
[1:44:36] or in a paper
[1:44:38] form I'm having too much fun can I say
[1:44:41] this our spiritual forecast has been
[1:44:45] broadcast in book form
[1:44:53] see I remember when we used to shout
[1:44:54] over that
[1:44:57] point well we might as well just we
[1:44:59] might as well just barrel down here and
[1:45:00] preacher for a second see I remember
[1:45:02] when we used to shout over things and we
[1:45:04] quit trying to sit there say well who's
[1:45:06] he after what he saying what's going no
[1:45:08] let me just go ah and get it out thr in
[1:45:09] the open I'm after one person that's the
[1:45:12] devil and anything that raises its head
[1:45:15] contrary to this message I qualified as
[1:45:17] a devil and it's deserved to be stomped
[1:45:20] on and you ought to be a part of this
[1:45:22] Joshua gener
[1:45:23] and partake so much of this message that
[1:45:26] when some little idea tries to creep
[1:45:28] into your heart contrary than what a
[1:45:30] prophet said you can say devil too late
[1:45:32] I've done been in the Oracles of God
[1:45:35] I've done been over in the prophecies
[1:45:37] and I know who I am and I refuse to
[1:45:40] allow you to damper me any
[1:45:43] longer we got to lose the shame folks we
[1:45:46] got to lose the shame Heen I say this
[1:45:48] look at this word broadcast it means to
[1:45:51] transmit a program or some information
[1:45:54] by radio I I I about shouted all over
[1:45:57] that little room brother wend when I
[1:45:58] read this one when you broadcast
[1:46:00] something you're scattering
[1:46:03] seeds oh God when you broadcast
[1:46:07] something you're scattering seeds when
[1:46:09] you broadcast something you're telling
[1:46:11] somebody you know what another word for
[1:46:13] broadcast is go look it up it's the word
[1:46:16] Soul you know what Jesus said he said
[1:46:19] behold a sewer went forth to seow you
[1:46:22] know what he said and he said the seed
[1:46:24] he was sowing was the word of God and a
[1:46:27] Prophet come along and said Malachi 4
[1:46:30] has not yet been fulfilled but it must
[1:46:32] be fulfilled because it's gerti word of
[1:46:34] God spoken through Malachi the prophet
[1:46:37] and Jesus referred to it he said now
[1:46:39] here it is it is to be just before the
[1:46:42] coming of Christ the second time all
[1:46:45] scripture has not been fulfilled but it
[1:46:47] must be and before that time the Bible
[1:46:49] is to be finished he said the Gentile
[1:46:52] dispensation is to be finished when this
[1:46:54] church age when this anointed messenger
[1:46:57] arrives now are can can I say what he
[1:46:59] said is that okay he said of course he
[1:47:02] will plant the seed of the entire Bible
[1:47:06] when he begins to sound he's doing more
[1:47:09] than just preaching sermons he's sewing
[1:47:12] a word seed of the entire Bible all the
[1:47:16] way from the serpent to the messenger in
[1:47:19] the former Reign he said this Bible is a
[1:47:21] different book from any other sacred
[1:47:22] book book there's no Bible like it
[1:47:24] because the Bible is God in word form
[1:47:27] and any seed will bring forth of its
[1:47:29] kind if it's in the right condition in
[1:47:31] the right atmosphere now this book of
[1:47:34] Prophecy it is foretelling future events
[1:47:38] listen there's been how many's heard a
[1:47:40] sermon called spoken word is the
[1:47:41] Original
[1:47:42] Seed honestly let me see your hand if
[1:47:44] you if you've heard that sermon okay you
[1:47:46] that heard that no brother said there he
[1:47:48] said there's been three seeds swn he
[1:47:51] said there was a denominational seed
[1:47:53] he said then there was a Pentecostal
[1:47:55] seed he said and then there was a word
[1:47:58] seed listen can I say this there is a
[1:48:01] difference Amen in an Oral Roberts
[1:48:03] anointing and a William Marian brandom
[1:48:05] anointing how many's heard of Oral
[1:48:07] Roberts can I see your hand you've heard
[1:48:09] of the brother okay can I say this
[1:48:11] there's a difference in a lay out of
[1:48:13] seean Age and what a prophet said a
[1:48:15] bride age you say what's that difference
[1:48:17] here it is it's the calling out of the
[1:48:20] Bride you say what's that mean well a
[1:48:23] prophet said this in 1951 now can I say
[1:48:25] this I want you to see his ministry
[1:48:27] change he says in 1951 he said now I
[1:48:30] believe there's something coming that's
[1:48:32] going to be a double portion to the
[1:48:33] church I feel that down in my heart oh
[1:48:38] Malachi for the heart he said now my
[1:48:40] Ministry is changing 1958 he said
[1:48:43] there's something that's great and
[1:48:44] wonderful amen there's something coming
[1:48:46] but in
[1:48:48] 1962 he changes from saying brother Joel
[1:48:51] there's something coming till he says my
[1:48:53] Ministry is to declare him he's here
[1:48:57] well now we can have church now we can
[1:49:00] shout and restricted now we can have the
[1:49:02] restoration of the word now we can have
[1:49:04] everything in the Bible because there's
[1:49:06] now a Vindicated voice of authority to
[1:49:09] say what should be in the church and
[1:49:11] what should not be in the church oh he
[1:49:14] said if the great Holy Spirit the Unseen
[1:49:16] now if the senses of faith will declare
[1:49:18] him to me he brought the senses of faith
[1:49:21] and his word has brought it so close
[1:49:23] this last day till he's got the picture
[1:49:24] of it here he's brought it so close to
[1:49:27] our senses anointed has went away and
[1:49:30] seen him come in here and move around in
[1:49:33] that form of a pillar of fire hasn't he
[1:49:37] he says this now he's here I know he's
[1:49:42] here my faith says he's here now if he
[1:49:46] can just materialize himself enough in
[1:49:48] here to catch that woman's life see as
[1:49:51] he promised he would do the Holy Spirit
[1:49:54] would do the same work he did folks can
[1:49:57] I just say it there is a difference in
[1:49:59] Seeking a sign and recognizing a sign we
[1:50:02] are not a weak and wicked adulterous
[1:50:04] Generation all gathered over here in the
[1:50:07] middle of nowhere in Oklahoma trying to
[1:50:09] pray up a Revival or shout down a
[1:50:11] Revival or seek a manifestation can I
[1:50:14] say this you are the
[1:50:18] manifestation I couldn't say that before
[1:50:20] the word come open but I can say it
[1:50:22] tonight brother Andrew where is the
[1:50:24] vision behold the vision of the word
[1:50:27] seed brother Andrew was there a crop
[1:50:30] there was a crop brother Brandon if you
[1:50:32] can look over the banisters of Heaven
[1:50:34] look in this building tonight the entire
[1:50:36] word seed has been
[1:50:40] sown what are you saying I'm saying
[1:50:43] we're not looking for a move of God can
[1:50:46] I say this we're not looking for a move
[1:50:49] of God brother Bram said we know we have
[1:50:51] a move of God
[1:50:53] we know it's performing Miracles it's
[1:50:55] Healing The Sick it's even raising the
[1:50:57] dead it's casting out Devils it's
[1:50:59] speaking with tongues and interpreting
[1:51:01] tongues it sends forth prophecies and
[1:51:04] they
[1:51:07] happen now I just got to say what a
[1:51:09] prophet said he said this move of God is
[1:51:12] the word it's not just birth and Sons
[1:51:16] it's adopting Sons because a promised
[1:51:19] Prophet said it very plainly he said now
[1:51:21] see your birth is is not your adoption
[1:51:23] see because the Holy Ghost is a witness
[1:51:26] of the resurrection showing that you
[1:51:29] have become an adult in Christ see
[1:51:33] that's the prophecy over your life is
[1:51:36] you will become an adult in Christ he
[1:51:39] said now all that happens in the natural
[1:51:42] is only a type of what's going to happen
[1:51:44] on the spiritual he said this listen
[1:51:47] friends let's hear him the Holy Spirit
[1:51:49] speaking in our midst showing diverse
[1:51:51] miracles signs and wonders let's not
[1:51:53] just passed over it as just common

[1:52:04] today and forever confirming his word
[1:52:09] can I say something to you young people
[1:52:11] never let this message become
[1:52:18] common never let this message become
[1:52:22] common brother R said see because every
[1:52:25] spiritual happening is a sign from God
[1:52:28] now I'm I'm I'm bringing this down to
[1:52:30] you right now we're not direct quote
[1:52:32] we're not here by accident these things

[1:52:41] the hour is a sign now watch it look
[1:52:45] what it's doing if it's man-made there's
[1:52:47] nothing to it now what are these
[1:52:49] happenings these happenings are
[1:52:51] achievements said what they are amen
[1:52:54] they're modern events made clear by the
[1:52:56] prophecy he said now what's happening
[1:52:59] amen that in the natural real all the
[1:53:01] world should see this but now there's a
[1:53:03] spiritual real and we see the great

[1:53:38] Bible said what happen in this day it's
[1:53:40] happening day by day what now now let me

[1:53:59] time message is
[1:54:01] here somebody shout the
[1:54:04] message is here brother BR said this
[1:54:07] look at this prophecy of Isaiah and I'm
[1:54:09] going to tie this right here it's the
[1:54:11] first night I don't want to go too long
[1:54:12] Isaiah 64 and4 for since the beginning
[1:54:15] of the world men have not heard nor
[1:54:18] perceived by the ear neither have the
[1:54:20] eye seen oh God beside thee what he hath
[1:54:24] prepared for him that waiteth for him in
[1:54:27] 1 Corinthians 2:9 Paul says but as it is
[1:54:30] written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard
[1:54:34] neither have it entered into the heart
[1:54:36] of man the things which God hath
[1:54:39] prepared for them that love him now can
[1:54:41] I can I can I can I turn a corner from
[1:54:44] the prophecy to the Fulfillment he says
[1:54:47] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[1:54:51] his spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[1:54:54] things yay the Deep things of God for
[1:54:56] what man knoweth the things of a man say
[1:54:59] the spirit of man which is in him even
[1:55:01] so the things of God knoweth no man but
[1:55:04] the spirit of God now we have received
[1:55:08] not the spirit of the world but we
[1:55:11] received the spirit which is of god
[1:55:13] listen that we might know these things
[1:55:17] that have been freely given to us of God
[1:55:20] oh young people which things also we
[1:55:23] speak not in the words of man but which
[1:55:26] the Holy Ghost teaches comparing
[1:55:28] spiritual with spiritual can I say this
[1:55:30] re said it very beautiful give freedom
[1:55:32] of the spirit that your worshiping
[1:55:34] children might have the privilege
[1:55:36] tonight to enjoy the deep rich blessings
[1:55:38] of the Holy Ghost which the father has
[1:55:41] stor in them he said may they have a
[1:55:43] great unction and strength and power to
[1:55:45] bring their congregations The Waiting
[1:55:47] sheep the food that God has in store for
[1:55:51] his people come on I know we're I know
[1:55:53] we may be a little bit nervous about
[1:55:55] camp food hey but can I tell you
[1:55:57] something every message Camp serves the
[1:55:59] same food behind the pull pit it may be
[1:56:02] different in the cafeteria it it should
[1:56:04] be the same behind the pull pit it may
[1:56:06] be different in the cafeteria it may be
[1:56:08] different by the cooks but inside the
[1:56:11] house of God there is a table prepared
[1:56:14] it's a banqueting table it's not coming
[1:56:16] from the mind of a man it's coming from
[1:56:19] a gift that has been fellowshipping in

[1:56:24] table before you we don't know what he
[1:56:26] has in store for us but we do know that
[1:56:29] there must be something he's going to
[1:56:31] bring forth to us why are you saying

[2:26:26] imagination but the reality is when
[2:26:30] scripture has been
[2:26:32] fulfilled When God Says in
[2:26:36] Malachi that before the destruction of
[2:26:38] the earth and before we walk out on the
[2:26:42] ashes of the
[2:26:43] [Music]
[2:26:45] wicked that there would be a spirit that
[2:26:47] would come
[2:26:50] Spirit of Elijah would rest God would
[2:26:53] send a
[2:26:56] prophet and he would turn the hearts of
[2:27:00] the
[2:27:01] children that's
[2:27:04] us back to the
[2:27:06] [Music]
[2:27:09] faith of the

[2:27:16] tonight whether we're having a good day
[2:27:21] that
[2:27:23] day whether we're on the mountain or in
[2:27:26] the valley there's never a
[2:27:30] question Satan isn't going to be able to
[2:27:33] take it out of us well maybe I don't
[2:27:37] have the Holy Ghost take it right back
[2:27:38] to the scripture and what did the
[2:27:39] prophet say the Holy Ghost would
[2:27:42] be well praise the Lord back in
[2:27:45] Pentecost if we weren't jumping and
[2:27:48] shouting
[2:27:50] and if my pastor wasn't seeing a vision
[2:27:53] or a prophecy over
[2:27:55] me then I then God had totally forgot
[2:27:57] about
[2:27:59] me but when I came into the message I
[2:28:01] thought I've got something greater than
[2:28:04] a prophecy or something greater than hey
[2:28:08] we're thankful for them they're
[2:28:11] wonderful but when I'm in the Valley
[2:28:14] I've got the great Shepherd
