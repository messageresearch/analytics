[34:35] it says the Lord's day and I heard
[34:38] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[34:41] saying I'm Alpha
[34:43] Omega the first and the last
[34:46] what thou seeest write in a book and

[34:51] which are in Asia and to Ephesus Smyrna
[34:54] pergamus thotara Sardis Philadelphia and
[34:58] under laodicea and I turned to see the
[35:01] voice that spake with me and being
[35:04] turned I saw seven candlesticks and in
[35:09] the midst of the seven candlesticks one
[35:10] like unto the son of man clothed with a
[35:13] garment down to the foot
[35:15] gird about the paps with a golden girdle
[35:18] his head and his hair were white like
[35:22] wool as white as snow his eyes were as
[35:24] flames of fire his feet like unto fine
[35:28] brass as if they burned in a furnace and
[35:30] his voice is the sound of many Waters
[35:33] and he had in his right hand Seven Stars
[35:36] out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged
[35:38] sword and his countenance was as the sun
[35:42] shineth in its strength let's go to the
[35:45] Lord in prayer father we thank you today

[38:32] older these days and hopefully have a
[38:35] little bit better understanding than

[38:41] got to see a lot of souls touched and
[38:43] saved
[38:45] um even even with with a little bit of
[38:47] experience that we had had at 15 and 16
[38:51] years old and and um so I've always

[39:15] predestination that's that's a that's a
[39:17] that's a deep subject and um uh it you
[39:21] you can it can leave questions sometimes
[39:24] as well you know then what's the need of
[39:26] praying uh if everything is
[39:28] predestinated amen you've got to
[39:30] understand the way that God has ordained
[39:33] it and what and what God has done we
[39:35] pray according to the will of God Amen
[39:38] we are seeking his will we are fighting
[39:41] for his will amen and his will is for
[39:45] healing his will is for deliverance and
[39:48] so we're not taking away human
[39:50] responsibility whatsoever in fact amen
[39:53] we are a free moral agency and and
[39:56] that's that's that's you you say free
[39:58] moral agency and then predestinated yes
[40:01] amen but but I I I want to tell you I've
[40:04] got a choice Amen to thrive in the ways
[40:08] of God thrive in the Bible blessings of
[40:10] God thrive in the word of God or I can
[40:13] be one of those Christians that just go
[40:14] to heaven amen by the by the skin of my
[40:17] teeth amen there's one thing that a that
[40:21] a Son of God will never be and that's
[40:23] the serpent seed amen that's one thing
[40:25] that a Son of God cannot be he cannot be
[40:29] the serpent or one of the serpents
[40:30] children the seed is different
[40:35] amen an apple seed has given has been
[40:38] given permission by God to produce
[40:41] apples and the Son of God that has got
[40:45] God's word seed in his heart has
[40:47] permission from God to heal the sick
[40:50] raise the dead believe the word now now
[40:54] whatever what however lazy you want to
[40:57] be as the Son of God Amen or however
[41:00] diligent you want to be as a Son of God
[41:02] you will be accountable before God
[41:04] someday amen are y'all are y'all
[41:07] understanding so God has placed us here
[41:09] as a witness amen so just because I say
[41:13] well I'm predestinated I'm just going to
[41:16] ride on the winds until I get to heaven
[41:19] amen I've got a work to do and I I want
[41:22] to fulfill my purpose here on the earth
[41:25] and so but but any of these kinds of
[41:28] things can can come in and you know any
[41:30] of these kind of questions I always say
[41:32] Amen write them down and ask those
[41:35] questions and uh and and if we don't
[41:38] have the answer we'll just tell you
[41:40] we'll just we'll we'll go find the
[41:41] answer amen and so
[41:44] um on these so we we we talked a little
[41:47] bit this last uh Wednesday night of
[41:49] course on the the the Christ walking in
[41:52] the midst of his church throughout seven
[41:55] periods so we found out that the that
[41:57] the seven uh candlesticks represented
[42:00] seven distinct periods of time amen
[42:04] throughout the church history from the
[42:06] time that Christ left to the time that
[42:09] Christ returns so from the time that
[42:12] Christ ascended on high and then from to
[42:15] the time that Christ comes and calls his
[42:18] bride home there will be seven distinct
[42:21] periods that are characterized by seven
[42:25] churches in there in Asia so you'll take
[42:29] those you'll take each of the
[42:31] characteristics of of each one of those
[42:33] churches and and and there was a there
[42:37] is something special about that church
[42:40] that that uh Christ is pointing out to
[42:44] John and saying now listen this is going
[42:47] to be a characteristic that is going to
[42:50] be coming through and down Through the
[42:52] Ages so so we we we're thankful for that
[42:55] now
[42:56] so we'll get into that a little bit
[42:58] later on as far as the amen the
[43:01] timetable and and that sort of thing but
[43:03] so we we we look there at the at the
[43:06] golden lamp stands and how that they
[43:09] received their life from the same Bowl
[43:12] y'all remember that amen so and and and
[43:15] and so you have the seven candlesticks
[43:18] amen uh that the seven seven lamp stands
[43:21] that were that were here
[43:24] and and then you had then you had a a
[43:27] bow amen uh and then you had a tree uh
[43:31] uh uh
[43:32] uh Hallelujah there is that better amen
[43:35] these girls got on to me
[43:38] there okay so then they're receiving
[43:41] their life that they're receiving their
[43:43] life flow from the new in the Old
[43:46] Testament and there's where you get your
[43:48] there's where you get your lights amen
[43:50] so the holy spirit is the oil and every
[43:54] one of the church ages are receiving
[43:57] life from that same Source the anointing
[44:01] can you say Amen so we we learned that
[44:04] amen that we we got into that this last
[44:06] week and so amen it is God continuing
[44:10] amen uh his work from church to church
[44:15] when Jesus left that physical body went
[44:19] to heaven but now there is a mystical
[44:22] body that would go from uh uh through
[44:26] seven Church ages and we would each make
[44:29] up that body we are members of that body
[44:32] so there is a bride that is called in
[44:36] every one of these ages there there is a
[44:40] bride in this age and when they died
[44:41] they were sealed under the message of
[44:43] that age amen then there was a bride
[44:45] that was called and the message of this
[44:48] saint and when they died they were
[44:49] sealed away in that message same Holy
[44:52] Spirit and it came all the way down
[44:54] until in this age this will be the
[44:59] rapturing age
[45:01] and when we rap when we come and reach
[45:04] that point where he's coming after us
[45:06] that all of the pride that is in each
[45:09] one of these ages will rise up first and
[45:13] we will be caught up together to meet
[45:15] the Lord in the air amen so we are it's
[45:20] an incredible thing you are the finality
[45:23] you are the one that is going to
[45:26] actually step into that place and bring
[45:30] Redemption to its finality it didn't
[45:33] happen in the first didn't happen in the
[45:34] second the third they all died believing
[45:38] for the promise you and I have received
[45:42] a message you and I have are the ones
[45:45] with the book that has been released
[45:48] unveiled to show you you're it
[45:53] [Applause]
[45:59] these all lived in symbols you live in
[46:04] reality
[46:05] you're living in the reality where the
[46:08] sea where the the symbols are opened up
[46:10] amen
[46:12] or Kyle and I was talking about your
[46:14] Bible falling apart amen mine does the
[46:16] same thing praise the Lord so so where
[46:19] it's a wonderful It's a Wonderful story
[46:22] now tonight if we can do this
[46:27] um I want us to look at some nuggets
[46:29] here in in this amen as we look at the
[46:33] uh at the seven-fold uh Glory of his
[46:37] person amen and so this personage is
[46:40] remember when we talk about a personage
[46:42] it is a it's a character in a play or a
[46:46] man it's all it's a word that is often
[46:48] used to express uh a person's
[46:51] significance or importance or elevated
[46:53] status and so amen we we asked last week
[46:56] who this mysterious one is and the
[46:59] Mysterious one was lacking to the son of
[47:02] man he was the Living Word the logos
[47:06] that is giving life and giving
[47:09] inspiration to each one of those
[47:12] churches amen did y'all catch that
[47:16] amen so amen where was John seeing these
[47:19] things now in his body John was on the
[47:22] Isle of Patmos he had been exiled there
[47:24] because they thought he was a witch and
[47:27] so they were trying to kill him so they
[47:29] they couldn't kill him they tried to
[47:31] ball him for 24 hours and oil they
[47:33] couldn't kill John amen well they
[47:35] weren't going to kill John because he
[47:37] was predestinated to bring this book of
[47:40] Revelation so God allowed him to be
[47:44] exiled on the Isle of Patmos with a
[47:46] bunch of criminals and and snakes and
[47:49] scorpions and amen and and there is
[47:53] where God came and appeared unto John
[47:57] man but
[47:59] the Bible says that while he was there
[48:03] physically that he was caught up in the
[48:06] spirit on the Lord's Day
[48:09] now now what a deal what a deal amen now
[48:12] here he is you know and that just that
[48:14] should that should be something for
[48:15] every one of us amen you might be on
[48:18] your Isle of Patmos it might look like
[48:21] you are you are in the worst of the
[48:24] worst and the worst and even right there
[48:26] in the worst you can still be in the
[48:29] spirit on the Lord's Day
[48:32] Hallelujah it pays to keep your attitude
[48:35] right even when things are going wrong
[48:39] amen can you say Amen so so he was in
[48:43] the spirit on the Lord's day now I I
[48:45] want us to look here as John examines
[48:48] this uh amen this mysterious one in in
[48:52] in the in here in these verses now Amen
[48:56] brother Bradham would tell us that he is
[49:00] seeing the judge he is seeing the judge
[49:04] amen these characteristics that we're
[49:06] fixing to show here amen he is he has
[49:09] seen the son of man amen the one that
[49:13] was the Living Word the one that was the
[49:16] intercessor the one who was the lamb the
[49:19] one who was the high priest is now the
[49:23] is now the judge can you say Amen now
[49:27] now if you look there where he talks
[49:29] about how that mean man uh and you see
[49:33] there in in amen the 13th verse and then
[49:37] it says you know he's the son of man
[49:38] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[49:40] and Gert about perhaps with a golden
[49:43] girdle now about the paps now the the
[49:46] the the the priest always wore his sash
[49:50] or his girdle around his waist amen that
[49:54] was that that was a sign of service in
[49:57] fact the ephod that went over the
[49:59] shoulders of the high priest and and
[50:01] would and would come down down amen it
[50:04] was the girdle it was a long it was a
[50:06] wide belt that would come in amen and
[50:09] and it would actually give strength to
[50:11] his back as he's picking up the the
[50:13] Lambs as he is sacrificing it was the
[50:16] girdle was was always War uh by that
[50:20] priest Jesus
[50:22] uh Jesus showed when he come to his
[50:25] disciples amen at the Lord's at the Last
[50:28] Supper well they do he gird himself
[50:30] around the waist with a towel so he was
[50:35] he was in serving his disciples amen he
[50:40] he was a servant he and and so but when
[50:45] you look here it's no longer around his
[50:48] waist
[50:49] but it's around his shoulders around his
[50:52] breast area amen it has now changed he
[50:57] is no longer the priest but now the
[51:01] authority rests upon his shoulders he is
[51:05] a judge amen and so now so I want us to
[51:10] just look a little bit here amen that
[51:12] now reading that that 14th verse and his
[51:16] head and his hair were white like wool
[51:20] as white as snow so I want us to look
[51:24] here white as snow a man his hair what
[51:28] did John see now this is this is what
[51:30] this is the first thing after he looked
[51:32] and he saw the griddle around his around
[51:35] his shoulder now he is looking at the
[51:39] white hair and and so now a lot of
[51:42] people want to say now uh brother
[51:44] Branham was curious when he was when he
[51:46] seen this it just he asked the
[51:48] theologians around these said now
[51:50] what does white hair mean
[51:53] what and so Jack Moore says well that
[51:56] was in his glorified body amen he was
[51:59] glorified and so now his hair is white
[52:00] and and but it didn't it just didn't
[52:03] quite make sense to to brother Branham
[52:06] and then one day the angel Lord told
[52:09] Brother Branham you are seeing him in in
[52:13] the position of Judge that hair
[52:18] represents wisdom amen and
[52:22] it it means amen
[52:26] experience and maturity and so I ask you
[52:31] here today can God age
[52:34] no God can't age but God is wise God is
[52:39] amen uh he has he has all experience
[52:43] he's the Fountain of Eternal wisdom can
[52:47] you say Amen now I I I want you to I
[52:51] want you to catch us for a moment
[52:52] because when God appeared in our day
[52:55] remember when the when the angel of the
[52:58] Lord when the cloud came and appeared at
[53:01] the opening of the seals Amen in that
[53:03] Vision that brother Branham had he
[53:05] noticed he he noted that that seventh
[53:08] angel amen it was it was it was an
[53:11] incredible Angel how how that that angel
[53:14] amen uh was uh it was just out it stood
[53:19] out to him and he comes back with a
[53:21] vision he tells exactly how the vision
[53:24] uh what happened and he goes I don't
[53:26] understand this he said these angels
[53:28] came there were seven dots that just
[53:29] came and they came so quick and by the
[53:31] time they materialized they were Angels
[53:33] they picked me up there was an explosion
[53:35] he tells the story well when they then
[53:37] when the picture is taken and that's the
[53:40] picture that that was taking taken right
[53:42] there of course that's just a painting
[53:44] but if you'll notice that seventh angel
[53:47] any man which was representing our day
[53:51] it acted as a wig over the head of
[53:56] Christ
[53:57] it formed the head of Christ when when
[53:59] the Lord told him he says look
[54:02] it is it is declaring Hoffman's head of
[54:05] Christ so in in symbolic form brother
[54:08] Branham was looking there amen and then
[54:12] all of a sudden the pieces begin to come
[54:14] together
[54:15] and he says
[54:17] yes the judges used to always a judge I
[54:22] don't care whether he's 30 years old or
[54:24] whether he's 40 or whether he's 50 he
[54:26] would put a white wig over his head
[54:31] that was part that was part of what the
[54:34] judge done when he came in to the
[54:37] courtroom so he had his robe but he
[54:40] always come and and they still and then
[54:42] and I I uh they're in the English judges
[54:45] especially they would put the white wig
[54:48] on which represented wisdom
[54:52] experience
[54:54] righteousness amen it was it was a it
[54:59] was a judge who was coming a man uh to
[55:03] to judge the situation I want us to go
[55:06] just real quickly over here to Daniel
[55:09] and um if we'd go Daniel the seventh
[55:14] chapter
[55:21] praise the Lord
[55:25] let's see
[55:26] um
[55:28] all right so Daniel 7 and 9.
[55:32] and it says and I beheld
[55:36] y'all still find it we'll we'll wait
[55:38] we'll wait till you get there I want you
[55:39] all I want you all to be able to look at
[55:40] that it's hard to find Daniel sometimes
[55:42] in the Old Testament amen
[55:46] praise the Lord I I
[55:49] think this is beautiful because this is
[55:51] showing the Judgment it says I beheld to
[55:54] the Thrones were cast down and the
[55:58] Ancient of Days did sit
[56:01] whose garment was white as snow and the
[56:05] hair of his head like pure wool
[56:10] and his throne was like the fiery flame
[56:13] and and his wheels as burning fire
[56:18] now fiery stream issued fourth issued
[56:21] and come forth from before him
[56:23] and thousands thousands Minister unto
[56:27] him that's the bride and Ten Thousand
[56:31] Times Ten Thousand stood before him this
[56:34] is the Judgment of the good and the bad
[56:36] and the Judgment was set and the books
[56:41] were open so Daniel Court a lot of
[56:44] Daniels actually Daniel's prophecy and
[56:46] visions and the and and uh uh John's
[56:50] prophecy and Visions they they correlate
[56:53] together it's talking about the Gentiles
[56:56] and the Gentile church now
[57:00] John sees though the uh the white hair
[57:04] on the son of man amen and now the uh uh
[57:10] uh uh Daniel is saying that he sees the
[57:14] Ancient of Days that has uh this this
[57:18] white hair as white as wool they're
[57:21] seeing the same thing now I want us to
[57:23] look I want us to really catch this
[57:25] again
[57:27] how how can you how you you you you know
[57:31] how how can you uh look at an eternal
[57:34] one and say does God age God does not
[57:38] age God's not an old man God is God
[57:44] he never began he'll never end God
[57:48] doesn't have good days bad days God
[57:50] doesn't have the flu God is God
[57:54] so this is expressing the Eternal
[57:58] Fountain of wisdom which is God and God
[58:03] Alone amen so now when you look at this
[58:06] where this white hair here in Daniel it
[58:09] is talking about the Judgment this is
[58:12] the judging of of the uh of the world
[58:16] now and it says in the 11th verse
[58:19] um is it's you know the Judgment was set
[58:21] the books were open 11th verse and I
[58:23] beheld then because the voice of uh the
[58:26] great words which the horns spake I
[58:29] beheld even till this the Beast was
[58:31] slain and his body destroyed we went
[58:34] through that a couple of uh Sundays ago
[58:37] talking about that they're in
[58:38] Revelations 13th chapter his body
[58:40] destroyed and given to the Burning Flame
[58:43] as concerning the rest of the Beast
[58:46] they had their Dominion taken away their
[58:49] lives were prolonged for a season in
[58:50] time
[58:51] and I saw in the night visions and
[58:54] behold one like the son of man came with
[58:58] the Clouds Of Heaven came to the Ancient
[59:01] of Days and they brought him near before
[59:04] him and there was given him dominion and
[59:08] glory and a kingdom that all the people
[59:11] Nations languages should serve him his
[59:14] Dominion is an everlasting Dominion
[59:16] which shall not pass away and his
[59:19] kingdom that which shall not be
[59:21] destroyed this is talking about the
[59:24] judge there is no more a lamb
[59:29] this is no more this is no more a high
[59:33] priest
[59:34] Mercy is over
[59:36] there's no more forgiveness there's
[59:39] nothing left they are now in judgment
[59:44] can you say Amen now notice who is
[59:48] ministering to him and who is standing
[59:52] before him
[59:53] amen the the Saints the bride are not in

[1:04:32] ministered unto him
[1:04:35] and ten thousand stood before him and
[1:04:41] the Judgment was set and the books were
[1:04:44] open so here we stand out now today we
[1:04:49] are being judged by the word today we're
[1:04:53] taking the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:04:56] applying that to Our Lives can you say
[1:04:59] Amen now we don't want to get off we
[1:05:02] don't want to get a lose track of where
[1:05:04] we're at here I just wanted to to bring
[1:05:06] this in now now remember
[1:05:09] First Timothy let's just turn this real
[1:05:11] quickly this this just came to me there
[1:05:14] in first Timothy 5 I believe it is
[1:05:16] history keys
[1:05:17] uh uh first first Timothy 5 and 24
[1:05:22] .
[1:05:29] praise the Lord
[1:05:32] some men's sins are open beforehand
[1:05:37] going before to judgment
[1:05:41] and some men's they follow after all
[1:05:46] right so here here we are so so we want
[1:05:49] to take care of our sins while we have a
[1:05:54] merciful high priest
[1:05:56] today
[1:05:58] amen now while we've got this merciful
[1:06:00] high priest we want to take care of our
[1:06:03] sins today repent of our sins don't hide
[1:06:06] sins under uh uh you know don't sweep it
[1:06:10] under the rug don't don't be listen
[1:06:12] that's the worst thing you could ever do
[1:06:13] is hide sins from your spouse hide sins
[1:06:16] from your mom and dad hide sins from God
[1:06:18] listen we've got a high priest that is
[1:06:22] there for the confession of our mouth we
[1:06:27] must confess our sins and put them under
[1:06:31] the blood
[1:06:33] don't wait till the rapture
[1:06:36] you know I believe someone was telling
[1:06:37] me the other day that some people
[1:06:38] believe that there'll there'll still be
[1:06:40] Souls getting you know people get saved
[1:06:42] that would actually you know sort of
[1:06:44] feel like maybe we might all be going
[1:06:46] through the tribulation listen I am
[1:06:48] washing my garments right now
[1:06:52] amen I don't have to go through the
[1:06:54] tribulation to believe the word of the
[1:06:55] Lord I believe in the word right now
[1:06:57] I'm taking my soul seriously right now
[1:07:00] can you say man now now
[1:07:03] there ain't going to be no one receiving
[1:07:05] the Holy Ghost after the Rapture takes
[1:07:07] place there ain't gonna be no one now
[1:07:09] there might be a lot of people speaking
[1:07:10] in tongues amen because the devil can
[1:07:12] impersonate tongues he can impersonate
[1:07:14] prophecies he can impersonate anything
[1:07:16] is that right
[1:07:18] but he cannot he cannot impersonate the
[1:07:21] word and he cannot impersonate a heart
[1:07:25] to receive the word in humility
[1:07:27] amen so I want to be humble somebody say
[1:07:31] Lord Make Me humble amen make me humble
[1:07:34] so so the position in this position here
[1:07:38] the position of the lamb and the high
[1:07:41] priest is over
[1:07:43] he is now standing as a judge the wind
[1:07:47] one is standing there as a judge amen
[1:07:51] there's no more atoning lamb there's no
[1:07:54] more priest offering blood for the
[1:07:56] people the mediator role is finished
[1:07:59] folks
[1:08:00] the mediator roll is over amen now the
[1:08:05] Sun
[1:08:06] the body the purpose for Christ's coming
[1:08:09] will deliver amen the kingdom that he
[1:08:14] has redeemed all of the sons that he has
[1:08:17] redeemed he'll deliver that back to the
[1:08:20] father
[1:08:21] and we'll say now amen these are all
[1:08:24] trophies can you say Amen now now now
[1:08:27] you're saying here we are we're going
[1:08:28] back to two again you've got to
[1:08:30] understand the role that God is playing
[1:08:33] it's one God using a body to redeem his
[1:08:39] people back to him
[1:08:43] so when you see the Ancient of Days with
[1:08:47] white hair
[1:08:48] and then you see the son of man in
[1:08:50] Revelations with white hair
[1:08:52] the Ancient of Days has the white hair
[1:08:55] and Daniel
[1:08:57] the son of man is the one
[1:09:01] how can the Sun have white hair I
[1:09:03] thought it was it's all the same
[1:09:08] we've got to understand the role I
[1:09:11] believe it was uh sister Nadine that
[1:09:14] brought it out last a couple Wednesday
[1:09:15] nights ago uh beautifully and that was
[1:09:18] amen it's the it's it's it's the chain I
[1:09:21] am a father I am a son I am a human
[1:09:25] being but my name is
[1:09:28] Wendell as as a role as son to Colby
[1:09:32] it's not the same role as a husband to
[1:09:36] my wife
[1:09:37] amen so I play a man it's it's it's it's
[1:09:40] different it's God putting on a veil of
[1:09:45] Flesh to accomplish only what God can do
[1:09:51] can you say man his purpose is to redeem
[1:09:55] you back to himself and when we get
[1:09:57] there to Heaven hallelujah amen well the
[1:10:00] scripture let's let's look let's let's
[1:10:01] let's find it here let's go to First
[1:10:03] Corinthians
[1:10:05] amen
[1:10:07] that's my problem here I can tell we're
[1:10:09] not going to get all this first
[1:10:11] Corinthians 15
[1:10:16] and since we're not going to get this if
[1:10:18] anyone's got anything just go ahead and
[1:10:21] bring it out
[1:10:22] praise the Lord
[1:10:27] let's see First Corinthians 15.
[1:10:33] and um
[1:10:38] 21 for Since By Man Came Death by man
[1:10:42] also
[1:10:44] by man came also the resurrection of the
[1:10:46] Dead for as Adam as in Adam all die even
[1:10:49] so in Christ shall all be made alive
[1:10:52] but every man in his own order Christ
[1:10:55] the firstfruits afterward they that are
[1:10:58] Christ's at his coming
[1:11:00] then come at the end somebody say then
[1:11:03] come at the end
[1:11:05] when he shall have delivered up the
[1:11:09] kingdom to God
[1:11:11] even the father
[1:11:13] when he hath put down all Rule and all
[1:11:17] and all authority and Power
[1:11:20] for he must Reign now this word rain
[1:11:23] amen is is is actually in his high
[1:11:26] priest over his sons and daughters he's
[1:11:30] got to intercede for them until he hath
[1:11:33] put all enemies under his feet The Last
[1:11:36] Enemy that shall be delivered is death
[1:11:39] for he hath put all things under his
[1:11:42] feet but when he saith all things are
[1:11:44] put under him it is Manifest that he
[1:11:47] that he ex that he has accepted which
[1:11:51] did put all things under him and when
[1:11:53] all things shall be subdued unto him
[1:11:56] then shall the son also himself be
[1:12:00] subject unto him that put all things
[1:12:02] under him that God may be all
[1:12:08] in all
[1:12:10] now you say now now brother window this
[1:12:12] this can this can really be confused the
[1:12:14] scripture says great is the mystery of
[1:12:17] godliness God was manifest In the Flesh
[1:12:22] so what are you talking about there will
[1:12:25] come a time amen when the church ages
[1:12:28] will be up there will come a time amen
[1:12:32] where it will it was the interceding
[1:12:36] work of a lamb for these seven Church
[1:12:40] ages there will come a time when the
[1:12:43] work of the lamb and the church will be
[1:12:47] totally over
[1:12:50] it'll be totally gone
[1:12:53] Redemption will be complete
[1:12:58] there will be no no
[1:13:00] reason for a lamb
[1:13:04] there will be no reason for a high
[1:13:06] priest there will be no we will be back
[1:13:11] to where Adam was before the fall
[1:13:16] so what God did what what the Apostle
[1:13:18] Paul said there's coming a time where
[1:13:21] this will all be complete
[1:13:25] you will be home
[1:13:27] I will be home
[1:13:30] Christ has stood there until the very
[1:13:34] last of God's children that he died for
[1:13:37] has made it home I want to tell you
[1:13:40] right now God is waiting amen for that
[1:13:42] last one to come in even right now and
[1:13:44] when that last one comes in brother it's
[1:13:46] over
[1:13:48] come on now he's not going to lose one
[1:13:51] Christ said I will not lose one I will
[1:13:55] not lose one no man will put them out of
[1:13:58] my hand he's there in that Redemptive
[1:14:00] role God's body is playing that role but
[1:14:04] there comes a time where it is no longer
[1:14:07] it is no longer Calvary it is no longer
[1:14:11] a lamb it is no longer a high priest now
[1:14:16] it'll be the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:14:23] are y'all seeing how it is God that that
[1:14:26] is that is looking there okay let's
[1:14:28] let's look here let's let's look here at
[1:14:31] John or at uh Revelations 5.
[1:14:35] praise the Lord
[1:14:38] amen

[1:14:49] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[1:14:51] not John we not behold the line of the
[1:14:55] tribe of Judah the root of David hath
[1:15:00] prevailed to open the book
[1:15:04] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof
[1:15:07] and I beheld and low in the midst of the
[1:15:11] throne and the four Beast and the midst
[1:15:14] of the elders

[1:15:19] it was King lamb it was God
[1:15:24] the Great Mighty King the Great Mighty
[1:15:28] judge becoming a lamb what John is
[1:15:31] showing that we're just looking at is
[1:15:33] now the interstate a session days are
[1:15:37] over and now it is it is the judge that
[1:15:42] is there amen and when I want to tell
[1:15:44] you don't stand before the judge in that
[1:15:45] day
[1:15:47] those who have rejected his blood those
[1:15:49] who have rejected his word those who
[1:15:51] have rejected his his atoning work
[1:15:55] to live in sin
[1:15:57] there will be no Calvary then it will be
[1:16:02] the lion
[1:16:04] the King right now
[1:16:07] the line of the tribe of Judah has
[1:16:10] prevailed
[1:16:12] he come in a body as a lamb sacrificial
[1:16:15] man but he's going to go back as the
[1:16:19] lion someday to claim his purchased work
[1:16:24] are y'all understanding it's Christ in
[1:16:27] two roles it is Christ putting it's God
[1:16:30] putting on the the the the the uh the
[1:16:34] veil of the body to buy Redemption but
[1:16:38] he's going to go back as judge someday
[1:16:41] Hallelujah but I got some good news for
[1:16:43] you

[1:17:40] looking for the time God is looking for
[1:17:43] the time where he is no longer having to
[1:17:47] intercede When sin and death will
[1:17:50] totally be over
[1:17:52] Hallelujah the Bible says I'm fixing to

[1:22:18] because the word has been substituted
[1:22:20] over and over and over until you can't
[1:22:21] even find a church that even looks
[1:22:23] resembles halfway of what the Bible uh
[1:22:25] teaching was right so it's not it's not
[1:22:29] the people in the denominator I believe
[1:22:30] there are Christians that are in the
[1:22:32] denominations
[1:22:33] I do but I'm going to tell you something
[1:22:35] right now amen for a Rapture they're
[1:22:37] going to have to wash their souls with
[1:22:40] the washing of the Water by the word and
[1:22:42] man's interpretation telling them well
[1:22:44] it don't matter it does matter
[1:22:47] we're sons of God and we line up with
[1:22:50] the word of God
[1:22:51] can you say Amen so it's important that
[1:22:55] we line ourselves up and don't listen to
[1:22:57] some kind of a you know two before
[1:22:59] preacher or some doctor or pulp or you
[1:23:01] know a TV evangelist or anybody that
[1:23:05] that that wants to substitute the word
[1:23:07] of God in any way we stand for the word
[1:23:10] of God because the blood of Jesus has
[1:23:13] washed us amen or has redeemed us so
[1:23:16] that we can believe every word of God so
[1:23:18] yes the seed of God is here amen my wife
[1:23:22] my wife was a was a Baptist you know
[1:23:24] amen and and her family her her family
[1:23:28] were
[1:23:29] you know we're uh I mean they were some
[1:23:32] pretty rough characters drug dealers and
[1:23:34] stuff over there man and uh you know uh
[1:23:37] and yet the Lord
[1:23:39] amen sent me over that way
[1:23:42] to rescue her amen well actually amen
[1:23:46] my pastor my pastor had a burden to go
[1:23:49] go her to community with with a tent and
[1:23:52] we set up the tent and her and her
[1:23:55] brother came to the Lord
[1:23:56] and the Lord's savior now
[1:23:59] that's God
[1:24:01] that's Jesus Jesus says I I've come for
[1:24:03] my own he said and I've got some sheep
[1:24:05] of another pasture that I'm going to
[1:24:06] come after too and he knows where to
[1:24:08] find you and how to find you
[1:24:11] I don't care if whether you're in a
[1:24:13] ballroom I don't care whether you're in
[1:24:14] it don't matter if you're his he's
[1:24:17] coming after you
[1:24:20] he's coming after you can you say amen
[1:24:23] hallelujah so amen so we're thankful for
[1:24:27] that all right let's look at this now
[1:24:28] the next thing that the next thing was
[1:24:31] eyes as the flame of fire now if you
[1:24:34] look there it says his head is his head
[1:24:36] and his hair is white like wool a white
[1:24:38] as snow and his eyes were as a flame
[1:24:42] of fire now
[1:24:45] think of it
[1:24:47] the eyes that were once dimmed with
[1:24:51] tears
[1:24:52] of Sorrow
[1:24:54] and agony
[1:24:57] the one that was
[1:25:01] they wept with compassion
[1:25:05] over the grave of Lazarus the one that
[1:25:07] looked over Jerusalem
[1:25:09] with compassion and say Jerusalem
[1:25:11] Jerusalem if you'd only known your hour
[1:25:13] of visitation and he wept
[1:25:16] he says how come
[1:25:18] to bring you in as a end of The Brood
[1:25:21] all right
[1:25:23] those eyes that cried or that wept
[1:25:26] they're in the garden
[1:25:28] the the the the one that looked down
[1:25:32] those eyes that looked down upon the
[1:25:34] murderous men that were beating him
[1:25:37] flogging him driving his his hands Nails
[1:25:42] into his hands
[1:25:44] and those eyes that were looking and he
[1:25:46] would still look and say father
[1:25:49] forgive them
[1:25:52] those those I eyes that moved with
[1:25:55] compassion are now a flame of fire
[1:26:03] it is Vengeance in his eyes
[1:26:07] they're now the eyes of a judge
[1:26:09] who will recompense those who rejected
[1:26:12] him now think about it amen of all the
[1:26:17] characteristics the human
[1:26:18] characteristics amen that Jesus had and
[1:26:22] and the human emotions he cried often
[1:26:26] yet behind the weeping
[1:26:29] behind the sorrow
[1:26:32] was God
[1:26:34] God was living in that body
[1:26:39] to redeem
[1:26:41] it was God in the body of Jesus saying
[1:26:45] oh Jerusalem Jerusalem
[1:26:50] now it is God standing there through
[1:26:54] those eyes of fire and judgment Jesus
[1:26:58] said there in in John a sixth chapter he
[1:27:01] says if you don't believe that I am he
[1:27:03] you'll die in your sins
[1:27:06] is that right
[1:27:07] amen you'll die in your sins
[1:27:11] and he was constantly there and we can
[1:27:14] look there at John 10 and 37.
[1:27:18] amen John 10 and 37
[1:27:27] praise the Lord
[1:27:30] if I do not the works of my father
[1:27:32] Believe Me Not
[1:27:34] but if I do
[1:27:36] though ye believe me not believe the
[1:27:38] works that ye may know and believe that
[1:27:40] the father is in me
[1:27:43] and I in him it was God
[1:27:46] redeeming
[1:27:49] well praise the Lord
[1:27:51] as Jeremiah of old Jeremiah was the
[1:27:54] weeping prophet
[1:27:55] Jesus was a weeping prophet
[1:27:58] that was God crying those tears
[1:28:02] amen but now now
[1:28:05] Mercy's over
[1:28:11] praise the Lord
[1:28:13] because he wasn't there just to read
[1:28:15] he's there he's there to bring as many
[1:28:16] to eternal life the Bible the Bible
[1:28:18] clearly says amen that he wants all to
[1:28:22] come he wants all to be safe he's come
[1:28:24] after his and he's coming after all as
[1:28:28] many of the whosoever wills that will
[1:28:29] come with us
[1:28:32] that's what the Bible says
[1:28:33] the foolish virgin he's he's offering
[1:28:36] them eternal life 144 000 Jews he's
[1:28:40] offering them eternal life he's even
[1:28:42] offering eternal life to anybody that is
[1:28:44] just good to the elect
[1:28:47] that's what he says there in Matthew 25
[1:28:49] amen when the judgment is open
[1:28:52] he's going to tell him you you he says I
[1:28:55] was hungry and you fed me I was not
[1:28:57] kidding you called me I was this and and
[1:29:00] he and and and and he's took he says
[1:29:02] enter into the joys of the Lord
[1:29:04] and they said when did we ever do that
[1:29:07] he says when you've done this to one of
[1:29:09] these that are mine
[1:29:11] you've done it to me
[1:29:13] and I'm going to give you eternal life
[1:29:15] because of that
[1:29:16] that judgment is not that's the second
[1:29:20] gen that's the white Throne judgment
[1:29:22] look at it
[1:29:26] you are his bride and yet God on that
[1:29:31] day is offering eternal life to
[1:29:36] because God is merciful and he loves his
[1:29:39] people and he loves people he wants
[1:29:41] every man to be saved
[1:29:45] but will they accept it
[1:29:50] we're living in a day
[1:29:53] where they're so far against God and so
[1:29:57] far against his word oh they want to
[1:29:59] believe God the way they want to believe
[1:30:00] it but they don't want to accept and
[1:30:03] he's the word
[1:30:05] so don't say that you love Jesus
[1:30:07] and you hate his word
[1:30:10] if you love The Christ you'll love the
[1:30:13] word of the Christ
[1:30:15] for he is the Living Word
[1:30:19] praise the Lord
[1:30:21] amen whole church don't don't sit here
[1:30:24] don't sit in this building here and just
[1:30:27] let things go and just and just let the
[1:30:29] friends make your salvation real love
[1:30:33] God with all of your heart amen and not
[1:30:37] just what if you love him you'll keep my
[1:30:38] Commandments if you love him you're
[1:30:40] gonna you're gonna come to his word and
[1:30:42] brother this word should mean more to us
[1:30:44] than anything else in the world
[1:30:47] amen
[1:30:49] because those fiery eyes are now amen
[1:30:52] they're they're now
[1:30:54] he's the judge those eyes are recording
[1:30:58] the lives of all the inhabitants of the
[1:31:00] earth they run to and fro the scripture
[1:31:02] says
[1:31:03] looking for hearts that are perfect
[1:31:05] toward him he knows the desire of the
[1:31:07] heart
[1:31:08] amen he sees all things nothing is
[1:31:11] hidden from him there in Hebrews 4 and
[1:31:14] 13 it says neither is there any creature
[1:31:18] that is not manifest in his sight but
[1:31:20] all things are naked and open unto the
[1:31:22] eyes of him with whom we have to do
[1:31:25] those eyes are searching out
[1:31:29] to bring us Redemption
[1:31:31] can you say Amen
[1:31:35] if you're going to be there in that
[1:31:36] let's let's look at your uh Romans the
[1:31:38] second chapter
[1:31:39] amen and we'll we'll wind this up here
[1:31:42] in just a minute
[1:31:45] praise the Lord Romans the second
[1:31:48] chapter
[1:31:52] and um
[1:31:55] if um
[1:32:01] I think the uh
[1:32:06] let's just let's just break in here so
[1:32:08] we can just get this part
[1:32:09] it's the fourth verse
[1:32:12] or despises thou The Riches of his
[1:32:14] goodness and forbearance and
[1:32:16] long-suffering
[1:32:18] not knowing that the goodness of God
[1:32:20] leads thee to repentance
[1:32:22] but after thy hardness and in penitent
[1:32:26] heart
[1:32:27] treasurous up thyself wrath against the
[1:32:31] day of Wrath and revelation of the
[1:32:34] righteous Judgment of God
[1:32:36] who will render to every man
[1:32:39] according to his deeds
[1:32:43] to them who by patient continuance and
[1:32:46] well-doing seek for glory honor and
[1:32:48] Immortal immortality eternal life but
[1:32:50] unto them that are contentious
[1:32:52] and do not obey the truth but obey
[1:32:55] unrighteousness indignation and wrath
[1:32:57] tribulation and anguish upon every soul
[1:33:01] that doeth evil of the Jew first and
[1:33:03] also to the Gentile
[1:33:04] but glory and honor and peace to every
[1:33:07] man that worketh good to the Jew first
[1:33:09] and also to the Gentile for God for
[1:33:12] there is no respect of persons with God
[1:33:15] amen so this is the judge this is the
[1:33:18] judge this is now the the the the
[1:33:21] Mercy's over
[1:33:23] we're now standing before the Judgment
[1:33:25] seat of God can you say Amen
[1:33:28] now the Bible talked about the
[1:33:30] long-suffering of the long-suffering of
[1:33:32] God going back waiting for that lack
[1:33:34] waiting for the looking for that elect
[1:33:35] amen look at look at First Peter 3 and
[1:33:38] 20. you don't have to turn well yeah go
[1:33:40] ahead and turn there amen I just want to
[1:33:42] hurt him get this finished here before I
[1:33:44] before we leave
[1:33:45] amen First Peter 1 uh first Peter 3 and
[1:33:49] 20.
[1:33:50] now and he's talking about
[1:33:53] uh a Noah and and I want you to watch
[1:33:56] here I want you the way I I love the way
[1:33:59] this was this was done
[1:34:01] God sent
[1:34:03] amen uh uh the God sent
[1:34:07] a a way of safety a provision
[1:34:13] for the for this for the house of Noah
[1:34:16] the righteous people on the Earth God
[1:34:18] gave that
[1:34:20] but listen but he was also looking for
[1:34:24] those
[1:34:25] giving others a chance
[1:34:28] now Noah
[1:34:30] was the one that God the Bible says no
[1:34:33] one is family
[1:34:35] amen there was no other righteous
[1:34:39] and yet God was merciful
[1:34:43] offering to allow anyone to come into
[1:34:46] that boat
[1:34:50] to allow
[1:34:54] Ed into
[1:34:57] yeah
[1:35:00] but they refused it
[1:35:03] because they didn't believe it the way
[1:35:04] Noah believed it
[1:35:08] when God sends us a prophet to show us
[1:35:11] his word and say this is where you need
[1:35:14] to be looking
[1:35:15] I would I
[1:35:18] I there ain't going to be too many
[1:35:19] people come into that boat
[1:35:21] because what they're thinking is the
[1:35:23] boat what they're thinking is Christ is
[1:35:25] a million a million miles off of it
[1:35:29] millions and men's men's
[1:35:32] ideologies and these dogmas and
[1:35:34] everything that got Christ so mixed up
[1:35:36] there is a real Christ folks
[1:35:39] there is a real Jesus Christ that is
[1:35:42] calling us he's long-suffering can you
[1:35:45] say amen he says which sometimes we're
[1:35:48] disobedient when Once the long suffering
[1:35:52] of God waited
[1:35:55] in the days of Noah while the ark Was
[1:35:59] preparing we're in view that is eight
[1:36:02] Souls
[1:36:04] were saved by water
[1:36:06] but God deliberately held off and held
[1:36:10] off and hell off
[1:36:13] but there's going to come a time
[1:36:15] where judgment strikes
[1:36:18] and God was not willing that any should
[1:36:21] perish and he wanted the world to come
[1:36:24] but that didn't mean that they came
[1:36:27] can you say Amen
[1:36:28] amen let's look here at second Peter 3
[1:36:31] and 9.
[1:36:33] amen
[1:36:38] praise the Lord
[1:36:40] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[1:36:44] promise
[1:36:45] as some in Council Agnes
[1:36:48] but is what
[1:36:51] long suffering to us word
[1:36:54] not willing that any
[1:36:58] should perish
[1:37:00] but that all
[1:37:02] should come to repentance
[1:37:04] amen
[1:37:07] Hallelujah
[1:37:09] you love him
[1:37:12] now listen
[1:37:14] amen and and
[1:37:16] if if
[1:37:19] if God is so merciful think about it if
[1:37:23] the holy spirit is here today and God
[1:37:24] has sent us a message like he promised
[1:37:26] he would and and God promised he would
[1:37:29] send Elijah Amen to the spirit of Elijah
[1:37:32] the fire of God would come down and
[1:37:34] vindicate it exactly the way it was in
[1:37:37] the in in the Old Testament times when
[1:37:39] the pillar of fire would come down and
[1:37:41] to prove that Elijah was right Elijah in
[1:37:44] the Old Testament was sent there for the
[1:37:45] Jezebels amen he condemned The Jezebel
[1:37:48] he killed her prophets he'd done all
[1:37:51] these things and then the holiest you
[1:37:52] know the holy spirit that He restored
[1:37:54] the altar
[1:37:55] and then God says that I'm going to send
[1:37:57] you Elijah the Prophet The Book of
[1:37:59] Revelations the second the the the the
[1:38:01] the second and third chapter talks about
[1:38:03] the Jezebel system that comes in those
[1:38:05] Church ages The Jezebel begins to try to
[1:38:08] Reign God comes in its promises and then
[1:38:11] in the last days before the coming of
[1:38:12] the Lord he's going to send that to
[1:38:13] Elijah with the same Pillar of Fire that
[1:38:16] would condemn that Jezebel system and
[1:38:19] then we not be willing to open our
[1:38:21] hearts in humility and say God I don't
[1:38:24] want any of Jezebel a part of me
[1:38:29] I want I don't want the Jezebel church I
[1:38:34] don't want I don't want that great
[1:38:36] that I want to be I want your blood
[1:38:42] I want you to wash me
[1:38:45] I want you to purify my mind and my
[1:38:47] heart
[1:38:48] I don't want none of that junk on me
[1:38:52] Elijah has come
[1:38:54] rebuilt the altar at the evening
[1:38:56] sacrifice the Bible said
[1:38:58] are you hearing me
[1:39:00] take this thing serious
[1:39:03] be serious with your walk
[1:39:05] now is the world going to accept it no
[1:39:08] no no because they're just as they think
[1:39:11] they're right they think they're right
[1:39:14] even after
[1:39:16] the coming of the Lord even after the
[1:39:19] coming of the lord The Book of
[1:39:20] Revelations there's several places when
[1:39:22] the vials are being poured out how many
[1:39:24] has ever read that they're in
[1:39:25] Revelations the 17th chapter
[1:39:27] where the vials are being poured out
[1:39:30] and God's given them a chance
[1:39:34] Hallelujah
[1:39:36] and and and and there's and they're
[1:39:38] cussing God
[1:39:40] Revelations the 17th chapter
[1:39:42] amen
[1:39:46] if I can get to the 17th yeah or the
[1:39:48] 16th chapter I'm sorry amen now now
[1:39:51] these are the vials that are all being
[1:39:52] poured out that's that's the Judgment
[1:39:54] this is the Judgment of the that's
[1:39:55] coming this is what he's talking about
[1:39:57] now
[1:39:58] hey man it's talking about there's
[1:40:01] annoying some Grievous sore upon the men
[1:40:03] which had the mark of the beast and upon
[1:40:05] them that worshiped the image and and
[1:40:07] it's going down all the you know these
[1:40:09] these vials that are being and look down
[1:40:11] at the ninth verse and men were scorched
[1:40:13] with great Heat and blasphemed the name
[1:40:17] of God which hath power over these
[1:40:20] plagues and they repented not to give
[1:40:23] him glory and the fifth angel poured out
[1:40:26] his vial upon the seed of the Beast and
[1:40:28] his kingdom was full of darkness and
[1:40:29] they gnawed their tongues for pain and
[1:40:33] blasphemed the god of Heaven because of
[1:40:36] their pains and their sores and repented
[1:40:40] not
[1:40:42] of their deeds
[1:40:45] there's not a heart of repentance
[1:40:49] the only kind of repentance that's going
[1:40:50] to be left folks is those that's going
[1:40:52] to make a rapture
[1:40:53] and we want to look at our hearts and
[1:40:55] say amen I want to be everything can you
[1:40:58] say Amen
[1:40:59] amen
[1:41:01] Hallelujah
[1:41:03] if you go back to the ninth verse this
[1:41:04] is talking about the plagues he's the
[1:41:05] bottomless pit you know being being
[1:41:07] opened up and amen it's it's it it's
[1:41:10] part of the same it's it's in that
[1:41:11] tribulation time that they're in in nine
[1:41:14] and twenty and the rest of the men which
[1:41:15] were not killed by these plagues yet
[1:41:17] repented not of the works of the hands
[1:41:20] that they should not worship devils and
[1:41:21] Idols of gold and silver and brass and
[1:41:24] stone and wood and which you could
[1:41:26] neither have seen or hear nor walk
[1:41:28] neither repented they of their murders
[1:41:31] their sorceries their fornications nor
[1:41:34] of their thefts I'm saying we're living
[1:41:37] in the day we're the judge
[1:41:41] or the judge is going to be a judge it's
[1:41:43] not going to be it's not going to be the
[1:41:46] lamb anymore
[1:41:48] if we if we if we try to amen put our
[1:41:52] lives if we if we try to
[1:41:56] if we can sit in a church folks
[1:42:01] if we can sit in a church
[1:42:03] and allow the devil to use us and anoint
[1:42:07] us
[1:42:09] when we've got the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:42:11] why would we do that
[1:42:14] because true repentance is to turn

[1:42:20] can you say man Lord give us a heart
[1:42:24] to repent
[1:42:26] he came for you and me because we're the
[1:42:30] only ones that can repent

[1:43:10] spirit on the Lord's day the Lord is
[1:43:13] showing him now
[1:43:15] he's showing him the judge the Supreme
[1:43:18] judge
[1:43:19] pretty it's just incredible how
[1:43:21] Supernatural God does things so so
[1:43:23] incredible this message is so incredible
[1:43:26] amen amen so now it's the eyes of Fire
[1:43:31] amen you could go to their book

[1:43:38] of iron

[1:43:43] he's full of Mercy
[1:43:45] he's full of love and he is full of love
[1:43:49] for his people
[1:43:52] Hallelujah
[1:44:01] I would get into church age book I I'd
[1:44:03] get in that church age book and read
[1:44:05] that thing man
[1:44:06] I'm going to tell you there are
[1:44:07] theologians there are theologians that
[1:44:11] that that book that book is an
[1:44:15] all-in-one buddy
[1:44:20] no
[1:44:22] no I'd go to the church age book
[1:44:25] and and read and start off there and
[1:44:27] just just really and and just really
[1:44:29] take that amen the it starts off with
[1:44:32] the revelation of Jesus Christ and the
[1:44:34] Patmos vision and that church age book
[1:44:36] has is loaded with history
[1:44:39] and what we're fixing to be going
[1:44:41] through in these in in this in the seven
[1:44:43] Church ages I mean it is it is got so
[1:44:46] much history uh and of the church and
[1:44:49] and how Satan has fought all down
[1:44:51] through those ages and I tell you what I
[1:44:54] I you know I I personally believe that
[1:44:57] that the purpose for god-bringing uh
[1:45:00] sending us brother Branham was was first
[1:45:03] to identify amen those Church ages and
[1:45:07] those seals that's his message that's
[1:45:09] his message what we're what we're
[1:45:11] teaching here is is something for us to
[1:45:14] be able to see get clear eyes where
[1:45:16] we're at
[1:45:17] amen the the scripture says that that
[1:45:21] that that religious tree would become
[1:45:23] would be that their their Revelations
[1:45:25] would be full of every foul and hateful
[1:45:30] bird
[1:45:32] all under the name of religion and you
[1:45:34] would have never known that ever you
[1:45:36] know everyone wants to put it to Muslim
[1:45:37] brother Brian said no no it's that
[1:45:40] Jezebel system it's that Roman Catholic
[1:45:43] Church that started in the beginning
[1:45:45] and now it's it was a covering over the
[1:45:49] people instead of the covering of the
[1:45:51] word and it was covering of men and
[1:45:54] brother
[1:45:54] I'm gonna I don't know you look at what
[1:45:56] brother Branham taught there and now you
[1:45:58] look at where we're at today and you
[1:45:59] think oh if he did not see this day and
[1:46:03] bring it out precisely
[1:46:05] he said the U.S would go total Anarchy
[1:46:08] the religious I it's just it's just
[1:46:10] incredible it's just incredible how
[1:46:13] accurate the Holy Spirit has been in
[1:46:15] this day
[1:46:17] amen
[1:46:20] yes yeah yeah I yeah do we do we have
[1:46:24] church age books here up there
[1:46:25] yeah we've got some Churches so anyone
[1:46:27] who wants Church age but I'd encourage
[1:46:28] everyone
[1:46:30] um and I don't think I don't think these
[1:46:31] kids are too young for for that uh
[1:46:33] that's one of the reasons I want to just
[1:46:35] go over to just slowly and simply and
[1:46:38] because we've got these youngins that
[1:46:40] are coming up too
[1:47:08] yeah
[1:47:09] that's right
[1:47:12] yep
[1:47:14] amen and that is and that is good yeah
[1:47:17] and that is that is true I I you know I
[1:47:21] I'm just I'm just I'm so thankful I'm
[1:47:24] I'm so some you know I I've heard people
[1:47:27] say well you know it's just hard for me
[1:47:29] to it's just hard for me to Rejoice that
[1:47:31] I'm the one Chosen and other people are
[1:47:33] going to hell you were his son
[1:47:37] for Kobe to turn around and say well
[1:47:39] it's just hard for me to to to say that
[1:47:41] I'm I'm Wendell Martin's son when
[1:47:43] there's others that's not his son are
[1:47:45] you kidding he was in my he was in my
[1:47:47] loins he's my son
[1:47:51] when you came out of the loins of God
[1:47:54] you came out from the loins of God the
[1:47:57] mind of God gird up the loins of your
[1:48:00] mind you're like your papa God God
[1:48:03] didn't have that Spirit didn't have
[1:48:06] loins he had a mind you were eternally
[1:48:10] in God
[1:48:14] oh he's redeeming you pulling you out I
[1:48:17] say cut loose of everything and ask God
[1:48:21] ask God to cut loose everything that is
[1:48:24] not like him
[1:48:26] cut it Loose it's Rapture time and if
[1:48:30] you're still tied to this world you
[1:48:32] ain't going
[1:48:33] cut it Loose can you say man he's come
[1:48:37] for you he loves you
[1:48:39] amen amen hey what else
[1:48:44] praise the Lord
[1:48:48] amen
[1:48:50] all right if the musicians would come
[1:48:54] praise the Lord are you enjoying these
[1:48:57] these these Wednesday nights or no
[1:49:04] amen
[1:49:05] I uh
[1:49:07] I I I love I love the Lord and I think
[1:49:11] that in everything that we do
[1:49:15] and all of our
[1:49:18] all of our learning is we don't want to
[1:49:19] hear
[1:49:21] or want in our eyes this eyes of our
[1:49:23] heart to see who we are and who he is
[1:49:26] and
[1:49:27] when you see that
[1:49:29] Revelation just starts it Revelation
[1:49:33] just simply
[1:49:35] breaks the chains over your over your
[1:49:37] faith because your faith can only go so
[1:49:40] far as your revelation
[1:49:42] But as God reveals himself then all of a
[1:49:44] sudden you begin to see things oh Lord
[1:49:46] here I am me and you this is special
[1:49:50] this is really special
[1:49:53] amen we're thankful we're thankful to
[1:49:56] have a knowledge
[1:49:58] but the greatest thing
[1:49:59] is to have that witness in our heart
[1:50:02] something in there I said Lord
[1:50:05] I just the more that I know you the more
[1:50:08] that I want to love you
[1:50:11] the more I want to express myself to you
[1:50:14] love you with all of my heart
[1:50:17] that's the way I am tonight I love him
[1:50:19] with all of my heart
[1:50:22] amen for everything that is
[1:50:25] I want to love him more I think there's
[1:50:27] still room to love him more
[1:50:31] cutting it off now we're living in a
[1:50:33] society Satan knows what he's doing
[1:50:35] so he's piling it on he's piling that
[1:50:37] internet and this and that and
[1:50:39] everything else on you've got to say no
[1:50:41] I'm a son of God
[1:50:43] judgment is fixing to strike I'm going
[1:50:46] to stay in that Ark of Safety with Jesus
[1:50:48] Christ
[1:50:51] praise the Lord
[1:50:56] please the Lord
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:02] be in his will in every way
[1:51:08] to be lost
[1:51:11] in his presence
[1:51:14] found in his likeness
[1:51:18] hear him say Well done
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:25] oh I just want to please
[1:51:31] the Lord
[1:51:35] be in his will in every way
[1:51:40] to
[1:51:42] be long
[1:51:44] it is presence
[1:51:47] found in his likeness
[1:51:51] [Music]
[1:51:57] Jesus
[1:51:59] I just wanna please
[1:52:04] you lost
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:08] be and your will in every way
[1:52:14] to be lost
[1:52:17] in your presence
[1:52:20] found in your likeness
[1:52:23] to hear you say Well done
[1:52:29] I wonder this evening if there's a
[1:52:31] desire for a closer walk with God
[1:52:37] something in your heart that says I want
[1:52:39] to be closer to the Lord
[1:52:43] I want to be what you want me to be
[1:52:48] if you've got that desire
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:52] won't you just let him know
[1:52:56] before we dismiss the night just let him
[1:52:58] know that
[1:53:00] you love him and you want to love him
[1:53:01] more
[1:53:04] [Music]

[1:53:08] rebellions and your
[1:53:10] sins
[1:53:14] let him know that you want to please him
[1:53:17] with all your heart
[1:53:19] foreign
[1:53:20] I think that that's
[1:53:23] the way it is for us all
[1:53:28] the cares of a life come on and many
[1:53:30] challenges surround us
[1:53:35] but Lord I'm asking that you would cut
[1:53:38] me loose
[1:53:42] from every attachment of this world
[1:53:43] every
[1:53:45] sin every Fetter every yoke
[1:53:48] that is not yoked to you
[1:53:53] free your children from bondages Lord
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:53:58] give us a desire more of a desire to
[1:54:02] to be right with you than ever before
[1:54:06] not just
[1:54:08] saying Amen to a thought but
[1:54:12] we want it to be a part of our very
[1:54:14] being that we
[1:54:16] we want it to be our conviction Lord

[1:55:08] their lives
[1:55:11] because they didn't they weren't sealed
[1:55:14] away with the Holy Spirit
[1:55:16] and I'm asking Lord that you would
[1:55:20] take our young people our teenagers and
[1:55:23] that happy-go-lucky stage of Life at
[1:55:27] you would really reveal yourself to them
[1:55:29] [Music]

[1:55:36] let them not be satisfied let me just be
