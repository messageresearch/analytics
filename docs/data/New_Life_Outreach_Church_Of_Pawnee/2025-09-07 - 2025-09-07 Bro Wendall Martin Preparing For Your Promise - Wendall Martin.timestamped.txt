[30:27] [Music]
[30:30] Hallelujah.
[30:33] Amen.
[30:35] That's such a that was such a beautiful
[30:38] song that Alina sung
[30:44] being desperate for him. And I
[30:47] I I
[30:50] think until we really get that place
[30:51] where we we're so desperate for him,
[30:54] we've got to have him,
[30:57] we'll just always be mediocre.
[31:01] whether we it's not it's not anything
[31:03] that we have to have
[31:08] and I think that's that's what
[31:12] really that's our society is a is a as
[31:17] I've said times before our society is a
[31:21] drugged society
[31:24] where everyone's on drugs there's no
[31:27] there's no desperation for God
[31:30] you the whether they're drugged with
[31:34] with the regular drugs, and there's too
[31:36] many of them that are. They're living
[31:38] off of artificial
[31:41] stuff,
[31:43] but
[31:46] but we're also drugged with the with
[31:48] with with
[31:50] the
[31:51] uh the the pleasures of life,
[31:55] things that numb just anything to numb
[31:59] us from reality.
[32:02] And then we don't really we're not
[32:03] really desperate for reality. We're not
[32:05] we're not desperate to
[32:08] to fix things in our lives. Not
[32:10] desperate to see God in our lives. It
[32:13] just becomes something that is
[32:17] whether we have our victory or whether
[32:19] we don't.
[32:21] But I I believe God wants us to live in
[32:23] victory.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; God didn't call us to be drugged up.
[32:30] God didn't call us to to be,
[32:34] you know, so our our minds so taken up
[32:38] on the internet and social media and
[32:41] things that he's called us to live
[32:44] victorious.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's going to be someone
[32:48] that's desperate for him saying, "You're
[32:50] all I want.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; You're of what I want."
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:55] So, we enjoyed that here tonight. Good
[32:57] to have brother Kobe back with us here
[32:59] this evening and missed him this
[33:02] morning. We um let's look here in the
[33:05] book of Ephesians the 2 chapter
[33:08] and um we won't keep you too long
[33:11] tonight where uh
[33:14] after the service uh I think there's
[33:18] going to be some that's going to be
[33:19] moving the pews getting getting them all
[33:21] ready to go for the for the meeting. And
[33:24] then I believe uh Sister Leah, I checked
[33:27] with her earlier. It it sounds uh that
[33:29] the ladies are going to meet down here
[33:31] at the church sometime tomorrow um uh to
[33:35] to give the the church a cleaning. And
[33:37] so um you all have probably got your own
[33:40] chats and things going. So um we
[33:43] appreciate everyone that's going to be
[33:45] helping on that.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; And then Wednesday um we're we're also
[33:50] uh we're going to dismiss the service
[33:52] here. So there's and then there's going
[33:54] to be a whole lot of work uh to be doing
[33:57] as ladies setting up the kitchen,
[34:00] bringing everything from the fellowship
[34:01] hall and and what have you. As guys,
[34:03] we've got refrigerators and stoves and
[34:06] and and things to move and as as well as
[34:11] um setting up CS and we've just got a we
[34:14] got a little bit to do there on on
[34:16] Wednesday. And um so uh we would so
[34:20] those who can come for uh for for any of
[34:24] this uh we would really appreciate your
[34:27] help. Hey, it's some sometimes it's
[34:29] better to have too much than not enough.
[34:31] Amen. We can get it done with we can
[34:33] always tell you to go home, but we if we
[34:35] need help and and don't have it than it
[34:40] so uh but um so we would appreciate
[34:44] that. looking forward to the meeting.
[34:47] Ephesians 2 and1
[34:50] it it says um for you hath he quickened
[34:55] who were dead in trespasses of sins. Now
[34:58] going back to what we mentioned this
[34:59] morning. Amen. Brother Brandham says in
[35:02] order to be quickened there had to be a
[35:04] seed in the ground. So, we're so
[35:07] thankful that there was something to
[35:08] quicken where in time past you walked
[35:11] according to the course of this world,
[35:14] according to the prince of the power of
[35:16] the air, the children which now workketh
[35:20] or or the the spirit that now workketh
[35:21] in the children of disobedience,
[35:23] among whom also we all had our
[35:26] conversation in times past, and the lust
[35:28] of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of
[35:30] the flesh, and of the mind, and were by
[35:33] nature the children of wrath, even as
[35:35] others.
[35:37] But God who is rich in mercy.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; He's rich in mercy. He comes and brings
[35:44] us out of those things. He brought us
[35:47] out of sin. Brought us back to our right
[35:50] mind. Brings us in. God who is rich in
[35:54] mercy. For his great love wherewith he
[35:58] loved us, even when we were dead in
[36:01] sins, hath quickened us with Christ. By
[36:05] grace ye are saved, and hath raised us
[36:08] up together, and made us sit together in
[36:13] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Aren't
[36:17] you glad you're in heavenly places in
[36:19] Christ Jesus? Let's go to the Lord in
[36:21] prayer. Father, we do thank you for your
[36:24] your blessings. We appreciate your
[36:26] presence tonight, Lord. And we are
[36:29] desperate for you, Father. We want our
[36:33] hearts to be blended with yours. And
[36:37] Lord, we want to see the way you see and
[36:40] believe the way you believe, Father. And
[36:43] we're just asking God as we are going to
[36:46] be making preparations this week for
[36:49] these meetings. We just ask that you
[36:51] would be with every team, Lord, all of
[36:54] the teams that are working. And I just
[36:56] pray, Father, that you would you would
[36:58] be with them all and give them wisdom,
[37:01] skill, strength, Lord. And we just ask,
[37:04] Father, that everything would go
[37:06] smoothly. And Lord, I I I just pray that
[37:09] you would help us here this evening as
[37:11] as I minister. I ask Lord that you would
[37:15] lift us both, the speaker and the
[37:17] hearer, into your wonderful presence.
[37:20] Lord, we love you. In Jesus name we
[37:23] pray. Can the church say amen?
[37:26] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[37:29] seated here this evening.
[37:32] not going to hold you long, but looking
[37:35] here at at the um at the scripture
[37:41] uh heavenly places and I I just thought
[37:44] for a title tonight, preparing for your
[37:47] promise, looking to these meetings,
[37:50] heavenly places is all things possible.
[37:54] Heavenly places, brother Brandham would
[37:57] describe it. He says, "Faith takes its
[37:59] position on the rock of God's word and
[38:03] all the waves of hell beating against
[38:05] it, its foundation. It'll take its eagle
[38:09] eye and soar beyond them clouds and see
[38:13] the God of resurrection
[38:15] uh of resurrection and promise." I'm so
[38:18] thankful for that tonight. And so I I'm
[38:22] glad that we can we can be in these
[38:25] heavenly places tonight. I'm glad that I
[38:27] can be here associated with you in
[38:29] heavenly places. Amen. He says he's made
[38:32] us all to sit together with Christ in
[38:35] heavenly places. Amen. That that's
[38:37] that's incredible to me because Christ
[38:40] was the only one Jesus was the only man
[38:45] that has ever been exalted to those
[38:47] heavenly places. But Jesus represents
[38:51] you. So when Jesus was exalted to the
[38:54] heavenly places, so were you exalted. We
[38:58] have a human being. We have a God man
[39:03] that is representing us in the heavens.
[39:07] Amen. He's conquered. He's in the
[39:09] heavenly places. And he's invited you
[39:12] and me to come in up into those heavenly
[39:15] places. Amen. What a place to be. What a
[39:18] place to be where you can escape this
[39:20] world. Amen. The doom and the gloom and
[39:23] to sat right there with your neighbor,
[39:26] your brother, your sister. Even tonight,
[39:28] right here in heavenly places. Amen.
[39:31] Heavenly places. That's where the
[39:33] promises are at. Heavenly places. This
[39:35] is where God, Amen, reveals himself.
[39:38] Heavenly places is where, Amen. you can
[39:41] grab a big old Amen. chunk of grapes
[39:43] from Canaan's land and be able to eat
[39:45] them and and believe God. How many
[39:48] believes that God still heals and
[39:50] delivers and sets free? Amen. Heavenly
[39:53] places, it's the it's the position or
[39:56] it's the perching place of faith. Amen.
[39:59] That's where that great eagle is. And
[40:01] Amen. He's above all of everything. And
[40:04] he can see the promises way out there.
[40:08] He can see the He can see the storms
[40:10] coming and prepare. He can he can he can
[40:12] rise up. I I I love going out to the
[40:14] lake and watching those eagles, you
[40:17] know, as they're just circling around
[40:20] the lake there and Amen. and before you
[40:22] know it, Amen. Uh or or a lot of them
[40:24] just set on those trees. There's there's
[40:26] several out there, but but you you'll
[40:28] see them just sitting on the trees and
[40:29] they're just watching and watching. Then
[40:31] before you know it, Amen. They're up and
[40:33] gone and they come back with a fish and
[40:36] and but what are they doing? They have
[40:38] they're they're they're above the
[40:40] waters. They're above the trees. They're
[40:42] above it all. And they're looking down
[40:44] for their prey, looking for their food.
[40:47] And I'm thankful that we can do that
[40:48] here tonight. Amen. You're above the
[40:51] hindrances of life. There's no
[40:52] obstructions to keep you from seeing
[40:56] heavenly places. You can dream and dream
[41:00] and dream. Amen. And there's nothing
[41:03] there to hinder you. All things are
[41:06] possible. Amen. Now, I've been around
[41:09] those who who who can't dream. Amen. I I
[41:12] I I've been around those that Amen. that
[41:15] uh uh live in a little bit different
[41:18] atmosphere. Amen. Because and and and
[41:21] quite honestly, I believe it's because
[41:23] they're not in the presence of God. They
[41:25] don't know how to walk in the presence
[41:27] of God. And and that's why, Amen. That's
[41:30] the reason why we have to go through all
[41:32] of these other things of life to try to
[41:35] numb our conscience because your soul
[41:38] desires to be with in the presence of
[41:41] God.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Desires to be in the presence of God.
[41:45] And Satan has got so many substitutes
[41:47] out there to keep you from his presence.
[41:51] Man, I I don't want to be living from
[41:53] fix to fix. I don't want to be Amen.
[41:56] just uh uh uh surfing the internet all
[41:58] the time just to keep my mind busy. God,
[42:02] let me be what you have called me to be.
[42:05] I want to fellowship with him just like
[42:07] God wants to fellowship with me. It's
[42:10] not that you want to you. It's not that
[42:12] you're begging God. God is begging you
[42:15] to take him at his word. He's invited us
[42:19] into those heavenly places. Can you say
[42:21] amen? Amen. But you see you those who
[42:25] can't quite dream. They're they're
[42:27] living in another atmosphere. And amen.
[42:30] It's a totally different atmosphere than
[42:33] those that are that are up in those
[42:34] higher places where their vision is
[42:37] totally different. Amen. Well, can you
[42:39] say amen? When you ask them, "What what
[42:41] do you what do you see? What are you
[42:43] looking at?" Ah, amen. They're looking
[42:45] at sickness and they're looking at bills
[42:48] and they're they're looking at troubles
[42:50] all around and and and they're mad at
[42:52] this one and they're mad at that one and
[42:55] amen and this one and the other. Oh my
[42:57] goodness. I don't want to live in that
[42:59] kind of an atmosphere. I want to live in
[43:02] those heavenly places where God called
[43:04] me to live.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; That's where Adam lived at the
[43:07] beginning. That's where God created man
[43:10] to live is in the presence of God. Who
[43:13] created you to live in his presence?
[43:15] Well, praise the Lord. You don't have to
[43:18] you don't have to wait for church time
[43:19] to come in his presence. You can live in
[43:21] his presence.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to come to church
[43:25] one once or twice or Amen three times a
[43:28] week just uh uh to to to feel the
[43:30] presence of God. I say that you can you
[43:33] can feel his presence right there. You
[43:35] can live in his presence. Oh, bless the
[43:38] name of the Lord. Adam longed. He lived
[43:40] in the presence of God. He He longed for
[43:43] it. He couldn't He couldn't awake. He
[43:46] anticipated for the presence of God.
[43:49] Every evening, God would come walking
[43:51] through the cool of the garden. And Adam
[43:53] and Eve waited. They could not wait. Oh,
[43:56] they enjoyed the garden and they enjoyed
[43:58] these other things. But I believe that
[44:00] Adam and Eve, they had an anticipation.
[44:04] Papa's going to be coming down any time.
[44:06] And we're going to get to fellowship
[44:08] with him. He's going to reveal himself
[44:10] to us a little bit more. And we're going
[44:12] to Well, can you say amen? Amen. And I
[44:15] believe that's the way our anticipation
[44:16] should be even. Amen. For our for for
[44:19] our services when we come. God, I I
[44:22] can't wait to come to church. I can't
[44:25] wait. Well, it shouldn't be. Well, well,
[44:28] I got a little bit of a cough. I better
[44:29] stay home. Don't want to get anyone
[44:30] sick. Amen. Well, oh man, I've got a
[44:33] backache. I Oh my. You're missing the
[44:35] whole point. Amen. If we are if we love
[44:39] him and we we fellowship with him and we
[44:43] Amen. and we know him the way he does,
[44:46] it's so wonderful when we can all gather
[44:49] together in heavenly places, believing
[44:52] for the supernatural things to come to
[44:54] pass in our lives. Well, can you say
[44:56] amen? Amen. That's right. Amen. You You
[44:59] see, Amen. when when those that that man
[45:02] that's in those heavenly places, you
[45:04] know, you when you look out, you're
[45:07] seeing things a little bit differently.
[45:09] Maybe you're going through something
[45:11] maybe even far worse, amen, than the
[45:14] other fella. Amen. But yet, because the
[45:17] Holy Spirit has quickened the faith in
[45:19] your heart and you're living in another
[45:21] environment, you are seeing something
[45:24] totally different. Why? Because you're
[45:27] walking alone with God.
[45:32] When you're walking with God, things are
[45:35] you you view things differently. When
[45:36] you're in his presence, you see things
[45:38] differently. You're living in a world
[45:40] alone with God. Oh, can you say amen?
[45:43] Amen. Now, for the other one, Amen. The
[45:46] other guy might might not be there and
[45:48] he can't see what you are seeing. Amen.
[45:51] But you see, and you're embracing
[45:53] healing. You can see and you are
[45:56] embracing victory. you can see and
[45:59] rejoicing with joy unspeakable. My God
[46:03] shall supply all of my needs according
[46:06] to his riches in glory. Can you say
[46:09] amen? Amen. What is it? It's not it's
[46:11] it's it's you're still living in this
[46:14] world and you've got the same problems,
[46:17] but there's one that is walking in faith
[46:20] and there's another that is walking by
[46:22] the way they feel, by the way they they
[46:25] see, by the way they hear. Oh God, let
[46:27] me stay in that heavenly place.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. That's right.
[46:33] You see? Amen. When these things come
[46:36] upon earth, the Bible says, "Lift up
[46:39] your eyes. Lift up your head for your
[46:43] redemption draws nigh." Sure, I can see
[46:46] what Russia's doing. And sure, I can see
[46:48] what China's doing. Sure, I can see what
[46:50] Trump is doing. I can see all of it. But
[46:53] you know what? When we see these things,
[46:56] lift up our head. Redemption is drawing
[47:00] nigh. This is a time, amen, to start
[47:03] preparing for the promise. Can you say
[47:06] amen? Amen. You, you, you, you have got
[47:09] a lot of troubles. Every one of us have
[47:12] got a lot of troubles. But I'm telling
[47:13] you right now, we are we we we've got a
[47:16] mighty God. And in this revival that is
[47:18] coming up, I I just want to give you a
[47:20] shot in the arm. Don't get Listen, if
[47:23] you've got your eyes lately off of the
[47:25] promises of God, get them on the
[47:27] promises. Amen. God is going to be
[47:29] moving in these meetings. We've got men
[47:32] that are preparing. Amen. They're
[47:34] they're they're fasting and praying and
[47:36] calling out to God for these services.
[47:38] Amen. Make sure that our expectation was
[47:41] where it should be. Lord, let me get out
[47:43] of the mlly grubs and let me come into
[47:45] your presence. Let me let me let me uh
[47:48] uh uh quit being drunk on the things of
[47:51] this world. Amen. Drunk on the cares of
[47:54] life. Amen. Drunk and numb. But oh God,
[47:58] I need more of you. I want more of you.
[48:02] I need more of you during these
[48:06] meetings. Can you say amen?
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Living in that world of faith.
[48:10] Living in that world of faith there in 2
[48:12] Corinthians. Amen. 4:18. It's a
[48:15] scripture that I that I love to quote.
[48:17] Amen. While looking at things uh not at
[48:20] things which are seen, but at the things
[48:22] which are not seen. For the things which
[48:25] are seen are temporal. Amen. Your trials
[48:29] temporal. Your sickness is temporal.
[48:32] Amen. The discouragement you've gone
[48:33] through is temporal. The situations in
[48:36] your home right now is temporal. Amen.
[48:39] But he says, "But we look at the things
[48:42] which are not seen, for they are
[48:47] eternal."
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Eternal. Amen. Eternal. It's in the
[48:50] heavenly realm that we can see eternal
[48:53] purpose. It's in the heavenly realm that
[48:55] we can say, "God's got a purpose for
[48:57] this disaster coming my way." Amen.
[48:59] God's got a purpose for allowing this to
[49:01] happen. God's got a purpose. Amen. All
[49:04] things work together for the good to
[49:05] them that love God. God's got a purpose.
[49:08] And I can see the purpose.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. When we start thinking
[49:18] of how good papa has been. Amen. When we
[49:21] stop to think when we stop to think
[49:23] about how good he's been, then we've got
[49:26] to stop and thank him for all of the
[49:29] goodness. Oh, well, can you say amen?
[49:32] He's been good to me. Oh, I know I don't
[49:34] might not have things the way the way
[49:36] that I want them right now or Amen.
[49:38] Maybe things maybe I I am a little sick
[49:40] or maybe this that or the other.
[49:42] Hallelujah. But I just want to say God,
[49:44] you've been good to me.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; You've been good to me. You've invited
[49:48] me into this place with you. Amen. And
[49:52] when we start seeing ourselves in every
[49:54] promise, when the light begins to come
[49:57] on and we see the great pains that God
[50:01] has taken in this last day to make sure
[50:05] that you have got a pure faith when we
[50:09] stop to think of the goodness of God and
[50:13] how good God has been to send you a
[50:15] prophet. Amen. And all that has been
[50:18] done. Now listen to me friends. Amen. If
[50:21] if if it wasn't for for God to to to
[50:25] anoint men to Amen. take those tapes and
[50:28] collect them from all over the place and
[50:31] Amen. and put them together and a and
[50:34] have the message that we listen. We are
[50:37] a blessed people. God has went through
[50:40] great lengths to make sure that you know
[50:44] who you are. Amen.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Then I begin to thank thank God for the
[50:50] ministers of this day. Amen. That are
[50:53] that are willing to study and a and pray
[50:56] and and dig into the message of the hour
[50:59] to give us this message. Listen folks,
[51:02] there's a lot of things to be thanking
[51:04] God for. And if we get into the heavenly
[51:08] places, we'll get out of the doom and
[51:10] gloom above all of the clouds and the
[51:12] muck and the mire. and we'll begin to
[51:14] see God's eternal purpose for us in our
[51:17] lives. And I say, God, I just want to
[51:19] stay up here in those heavenly places.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That's the way it
[51:26] should be. Amen. God, you've invested
[51:28] all of heaven in redemption. Hallelujah.
[51:32] When you look at these things, then your
[51:34] faith becomes intense. There becomes an
[51:38] intensess to you. Hey, God's done
[51:41] something and he's very serious about
[51:43] what he's given. Let me be intense about
[51:46] this. Now, I don't believe this meeting
[51:49] that's coming up is by accident. I
[51:51] believe God's ordained these this
[51:53] meeting. And God specifically put these
[51:56] men on my heart. It's a little bit
[51:59] different uh uh order than than what we
[52:02] have been. Amen. We we've always had uh
[52:05] at least had brother Sean and brother
[52:06] Jonathan and and and most of the time
[52:08] brother Wayne uh and then we we'd have
[52:11] the other ministers to come as well.
[52:13] Amen. And and they were home home folk,
[52:15] homegrown. We were Amen. just all we all
[52:18] grew up together in the ministry.
[52:21] Brother Wayne included. We were just all
[52:22] we were we were just all kids, you know,
[52:25] uh uh preaching together. And uh and
[52:27] I've got confidence in those men. Amen.
[52:30] But the Lord the Lord inspired my heart,
[52:34] amen, to go a different direction this
[52:36] year. And and and I I'm telling you,
[52:39] Amen. I I'm standing here behind this
[52:41] pull pit, amen, with a with a great
[52:45] expectation that God is going to do
[52:48] something in our meetings. God's going
[52:51] to do something. Amen. I I I I don't
[52:54] want to come Amen. And I I I think I I I
[52:57] don't want to just sit in church service
[53:00] and and and uh and and and just go
[53:02] through the routine and say it was
[53:04] another service. I want to touch God. I
[53:07] want to touch God. I need God. Listen,
[53:10] this preacher is coming into this
[53:13] meeting with a desperation for more of
[53:15] God. I I want more of God. And listen to
[53:18] me. If God has brought you into the
[53:20] church and he's been doing something for
[53:22] you, don't just sit there and and and
[53:25] let that opportunity pass by. Amen.
[53:28] Reach out. Get desperate before God and
[53:31] say, "God, while I'm in this church
[53:34] service, I need your presence. Speak to
[53:38] me. Help me. Encourage me. Deliver me.
[53:41] Whatever I have need of, God raised my
[53:44] faith." Can you say amen?
[53:47] those heavenly places. It's in those
[53:49] heavenly places that you begin to see
[53:52] things the way God see things. You begin
[53:54] to think the way God thinks. You begin
[53:59] it's it's a different thing now.
[54:01] Hallelujah. Amen. I I don't know if
[54:04] you've ever been there to where you've
[54:06] you've you've uh been been like Elisha's
[54:10] servant.
[54:11] Amen. And Elisha walks or the servant
[54:14] walks out the door and he sees all of
[54:16] the armies of the Syrians all around
[54:18] him. Now that's the flesh. That's the
[54:21] natural. Amen. He comes back in. He
[54:24] says, "Prophet of God,
[54:26] there's a they've got all I can see is
[54:29] nothing but armies of Syrians
[54:30] surrounding us." Hallelujah. Amen. And
[54:33] and and all I can see it's me and you.
[54:36] We We ain't got no soldiers. We ain't
[54:37] got no armies. They've got us. They've
[54:39] got us. They've got us trapped. Amen.
[54:42] But Elisha, the old prophet, he was
[54:44] already living in that other realm. And
[54:46] and he says, "Oh Lord, open this poor
[54:49] boy's eyes." He said, "Won't you go back
[54:51] out there and and take another look?"
[54:53] And and then when he goes out and takes
[54:55] another look, oh my. Then all of the
[54:58] heavens and the hills and everything
[55:00] around was full of angelic army.
[55:04] Oh my. What was it? It was the same
[55:08] situation,
[55:10] but somebody had moved into the heavenly
[55:12] places. Somebody began to see things the
[55:15] way God sees things. What you are
[55:18] looking at is terrible. It is terrible.
[55:21] But I just want to tell you, the armies
[55:23] of God are more terrible than the armies
[55:26] that are staring you down. Amen. God is
[55:30] a God of war.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll fight your battles. Can you
[55:36] say amen? And and and that's the reason
[55:38] we got to we got to stay in those
[55:40] heavenly places. Ephesians 4:8 comes to
[55:43] mind. Amen. Whatsoever things are are
[55:46] are lovely. Finally, my brethren,
[55:48] whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
[55:51] things are honest, whatsoever things are
[55:53] just, whatsoever things are pure,
[55:56] whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
[55:58] things are of a good report, if there be
[56:01] any virtue, if there be any praise,
[56:04] think on these things.
[56:08] Hallelujah. You say, "Well, my home life
[56:10] is is is is not quite the way I want
[56:13] it." You can live with God in in a in in
[56:16] in such an atmosphere of love. Amen.
[56:20] That the weward child just don't know
[56:22] what to do.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That the weward husband or the
[56:25] weward wife just doesn't know what to
[56:28] do. You can so live in that in the
[56:31] presence of God. Amen. That you create
[56:35] an aura about you.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; You're a miniature God.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; You're a miniature God. You are a son of
[56:43] God. You were made in the image of God.
[56:45] You are a creator. Well, can you say
[56:48] amen? Amen. You that's that's who you
[56:51] are. Brother Brandham would say, "I'm
[56:53] part of Charles Brandom because I'm his
[56:56] son. You're part of God because you're
[56:59] his son. You're born of his spirit,
[57:02] washed in his blood." Hallelujah. Yes,
[57:04] you are. You are part of him. You and
[57:07] you become a creator. Do you know that?
[57:11] Did you know that? Amen. He says that
[57:14] now it's it's a strange thing how that
[57:16] people the type of people and what we do
[57:18] and in our associations. He says now we
[57:20] we all have to face these facts that
[57:22] that there is people that you just love
[57:25] to be around and then there's people
[57:27] that's fine people and you love them yet
[57:30] there is something about that person you
[57:33] just can't hardly stay around them.
[57:35] Amen. We we want to talk a fact now that
[57:38] the re now the reason is is because of
[57:41] the atmosphere of that individual
[57:43] himself or herself what they create. But
[57:47] because you are a miniature creator, you
[57:51] are sons and daughters of God. No matter
[57:54] how far stooped in sin, you're still
[57:57] sons of and daughters of God because
[57:59] you're fallen degenerated in your soul
[58:01] and your mind. But God is your creator.
[58:04] And in your fallen estate, you're lost,
[58:07] undone creation of God, dominated by the
[58:09] devil. That's right. But you're still
[58:11] sons and daughters of God. But he's not
[58:14] willing that any should perish, but all
[58:16] might come to repentance. And he done
[58:18] everything that lays possible. Only God
[58:21] himself can do this. To give the
[58:24] opportunity to the creature of his to
[58:27] accept and to be what he wants you to be
[58:30] and to put you back in your right estate
[58:33] again.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you're not now you don't
[58:39] have to carry an aura of of of misery.
[58:44] You don't have to carry an aura of
[58:47] discouragement. You don't have to carry
[58:49] an aura. Now you can create your own
[58:52] little world and live in it. It's a
[58:55] world of faith. It's a world of joy.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many's ever started
[59:03] out your day and it's gone good and then
[59:05] amen, something happens and and before
[59:07] you know it, it messes with the chemical
[59:08] in your head and and and it just all of
[59:10] a sudden it just and before you know it,
[59:13] you've lost your strength. You're you're
[59:15] you're you're shaking in your in in in
[59:18] in your knees and you're amen and and
[59:20] you might have been working man just
[59:22] going and then all you can't get nothing
[59:23] else done that day is because something
[59:27] has come over you and your body is built
[59:31] amen to to react.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Your body is built
[59:37] to react.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so just the same as whatever
[59:43] came to you, whatever happened, whatever
[59:45] you read on your text or you heard or
[59:47] you you looked at Amen. And it caused
[59:49] all of a sudden just caused that that
[59:51] that and your stomach just sunk. That's
[59:54] the evil one. Trying to create an a an
[59:58] atmosphere of despair. Amen. And you
[1:00:01] want to just go in a dark room and just
[1:00:03] close the door and just stay there for a
[1:00:05] while. Amen. Well, maybe I'm the only
[1:00:07] one that ever does it. Amen. But I've
[1:00:08] counseledled too many people and I know
[1:00:11] it happens to the majority of us.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. It is something that
[1:00:17] comes and it creates something on you.
[1:00:21] But the prophet is saying what I'm
[1:00:23] trying to get you to understand. Amen.
[1:00:26] If that can happen to a fallen,
[1:00:28] degenerated a a a sinner who is a son of
[1:00:32] God, how much more to the one that's
[1:00:34] been born again, creating that
[1:00:37] atmosphere and say, "Oh, yeah. Amen. No,
[1:00:40] we're going to turn this thing back
[1:00:41] around. This body is going to come back
[1:00:43] where it belongs." Amen. And I've done
[1:00:45] it. I've done it. Been there, done that.
[1:00:48] Amen. I'll begin to turn some good solid
[1:00:50] music, Amen. gospel, and just begin to
[1:00:53] start praying. And before you know it,
[1:00:55] this old body just begins to to rise and
[1:00:58] rise rise right back up in the presence
[1:01:01] of God.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Been there, done that many times. Satan
[1:01:07] tried to take over. But I said, "No way.
[1:01:11] I'm not going to allow that. I am a
[1:01:14] creator
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; and I am going to walk in the presence
[1:01:18] of God."
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Well, how many believes that's all
[1:01:20] right?
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet says, "When we
[1:01:22] think of God, when we begin to when we
[1:01:25] begin to dream dreams of being well,
[1:01:28] when we dream dreams of being saved,
[1:01:32] when we get to thinking about our sins
[1:01:34] and how cruel it is before God, that's
[1:01:38] when he begins to draw near. That's when
[1:01:40] the then the the disciples brokenhearted
[1:01:43] going on the road to Emmas that Jesus
[1:01:46] stepped out of the bush and begin to
[1:01:48] talk to them while they were thinking of
[1:01:50] him.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; While they were thinking of it brings
[1:01:53] him near. It brings him near. So that's
[1:01:56] the reason you you say, "Well, what what
[1:01:57] kind of music?" Well, amen. It it ain't
[1:01:59] that contemporary junk that that's out
[1:02:01] there these days. I'll tell you that.
[1:02:04] Amen. But you you get some you get some
[1:02:07] good solid Amen. Just some good solid
[1:02:10] spiritfilled praying music and watch the
[1:02:13] presence of the Lord just come right
[1:02:15] back into your place.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; What are you doing? You're thinking on
[1:02:20] him and whatever thoughts caused that.
[1:02:24] Amen. They've got a the psychologists
[1:02:27] have got there there's there's a
[1:02:28] chemical that is released in your body
[1:02:30] and it just
[1:02:32] hallelujah. Well, God just brings on
[1:02:34] another chemical. Amen. And that that
[1:02:36] just starts bring brings you right back
[1:02:38] out of it. And you say, "Amen. I I I I
[1:02:41] I've talked to people." Amen. You go
[1:02:43] into that dark place when you you hate
[1:02:45] going into that dark place. Amen. I'm
[1:02:47] sort of going off my notes here, but you
[1:02:49] you hate going into that dark place
[1:02:51] because you're in that dark place for
[1:02:53] days. And Satan brings you in that. He
[1:02:55] wants you to stay in that dark place.
[1:02:57] But you don't have to stay in that dark
[1:02:59] place.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; You're a son of God. And the message of
[1:03:03] the hour has come to tell you. Amen.
[1:03:06] Take control of the situation. Take the
[1:03:09] word of God. Take the message of the
[1:03:11] hour. Amen. If there and and I'm not
[1:03:14] saying you have to turn on brother
[1:03:16] Brandham every time it happens, but I'm
[1:03:18] here to tell you, I've turned brother
[1:03:19] Brandham on many a time and that devil
[1:03:21] had to run.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; There's been plenty of time. Amen. It
[1:03:25] was just in prayer. It was always in
[1:03:27] prayer, but Amen. a listen to this or
[1:03:30] listening to a message that a brother
[1:03:32] preached or something and it drives
[1:03:34] those evil spirits away. My thoughts
[1:03:37] come right back to where it should and
[1:03:39] then I go to chasing that devil saying
[1:03:42] not today devil.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. So, so brother
[1:03:50] brother Brandham says when we begin to
[1:03:52] dream dreams of being healed, I think
[1:03:55] God wants us to be dreamers. He says,
[1:03:57] "Think big, dream big, ask big." Amen.
[1:04:02] Because God's a big big God. Hallelujah.
[1:04:06] Amen. He says, He says, "You you think
[1:04:08] the little the the little mouse around
[1:04:11] the gardeners of Egypt when they had all
[1:04:13] of that that wheat stocked up and stored
[1:04:15] up, you think they just ate a little bit
[1:04:17] at a time?" He said, "Oh, no. They ate
[1:04:20] until their little bodies were content."
[1:04:22] Hallelujah. They were fat and plump.
[1:04:24] Why? because they knew where the grain
[1:04:27] was and they knew that it was available.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; And I just want to say I know where the
[1:04:35] supernatural is. The prophet has taught
[1:04:38] us where it's at.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; The prophet has told us how to get
[1:04:45] there. We preach about it every which
[1:04:47] direction, but somebody's got to say,
[1:04:49] "Ha, there's a formula. There's a
[1:04:52] formula. Let me take the formula and let
[1:04:55] me mess press on. Can you say amen?
[1:04:57] Amen. That's right. Uh you know that I I
[1:05:00] was I I was thinking of a couple
[1:05:02] discouraged guys. Amen. Uh uh uh today.
[1:05:06] And uh you know the psalmist was all
[1:05:08] discouraged and and he was he was he you
[1:05:11] know he was discouraged and and uh amen.
[1:05:14] and and and he said I just just breaking
[1:05:17] in here Psalm Psalms 39 and2 and said I
[1:05:20] I I was dumb with silence. I held my
[1:05:24] peace even from good even from good and
[1:05:27] my sorrow was stirred but he said my
[1:05:30] heart was hot within me while I mused
[1:05:34] the fire burned and then I spake with my
[1:05:37] tongue. Now what was he talking about
[1:05:39] there? He was in his discouragement. He
[1:05:41] says I'm just I'm going to be silent.
[1:05:43] I'm not. But then he began to think
[1:05:45] about the goodness of the Lord and began
[1:05:47] to think about the the blessings of the
[1:05:49] Lord. And then a fire begin to burn
[1:05:51] within him. And then then he was able to
[1:05:53] start speaking the word one more time.
[1:05:56] Jeremiah was the same way. Jeremiah 209.
[1:05:59] Amen. He said, "I will not then said I.
[1:06:02] I will not make mention of him nor speak
[1:06:04] anymore in his name." But his word was
[1:06:07] in my heart as a burning fire shut up in
[1:06:10] my bones and I was weary with
[1:06:13] forebearing and I could not stay. Why?
[1:06:16] Because the word of God was dwelling
[1:06:19] richly within him.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Both of these instances they were
[1:06:24] discouraged puppies
[1:06:27] but they chose
[1:06:29] to think on the word of God.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Well,
[1:06:36] Brother Wendle, I I I just don't know if
[1:06:39] God I I I dream and I think and I I just
[1:06:43] want to tell you, Hallelujah.
[1:06:47] You can't dream You can't dream big
[1:06:49] enough.
[1:06:51] You can't dream big enough.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; God's a big God.
[1:06:57] And God is coming this day to satisfy
[1:07:00] your heart. Well, praise the name of the
[1:07:02] Lord.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. There there is nothing too big.
[1:07:06] Nothing too big. Every matter of fact um
[1:07:10] um Ephesians 3 and 20 sister keys. Amen.
[1:07:13] I believe three and 20 is now unto him
[1:07:17] that is able to do exceeding
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; abundantly
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; above. Everyone say exceeding
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; abundantly
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; above
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; all that we ask
[1:07:31] or think.
[1:07:34] You think about it, you get those bra
[1:07:37] those those dreams high enough. Whatever
[1:07:39] your dream is, whatever you're asking
[1:07:42] the Lord, he is able to do exceedingly
[1:07:45] abundantly
[1:07:49] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:07:52] would ask or think. That's right. Oh, on
[1:07:56] these, think on these things. Whatsoever
[1:07:58] are pure, whatsoever honest, whatsoever
[1:08:00] are lovely, whatsoever things are of
[1:08:01] good report. think on these things and
[1:08:05] he is able to do exceeding abundantly
[1:08:10] above all that we would ask or think.
[1:08:14] You know what that tells me? Amen.
[1:08:17] You're a creator.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Now, it takes God to do the creating,
[1:08:22] but you know how to work the system.
[1:08:25] He's the one. It's his word. You're
[1:08:28] thinking on his word. You're loving his
[1:08:31] word. He's coming on the scene
[1:08:34] fulfilling his word in your life.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, because the prophet Dun P, he
[1:08:42] put it very plainly. You have no power.
[1:08:46] So, going around there is claiming that
[1:08:47] we've all got power. We have no power.
[1:08:50] There's nothing in us. But Papa does.
[1:08:55] We're believing his word and we're
[1:08:56] speaking his word and we're claiming his
[1:08:58] word and we are becoming everything.
[1:09:01] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like I I I like the
[1:09:08] I I I like the uh I'm I'm a King James
[1:09:11] version guy, but I I I I sometimes I'll
[1:09:15] bring the amplified in because I I I I
[1:09:17] like to amplify it a little bit. Amen.
[1:09:21] Ephesians 3:20 in the amplified. Now
[1:09:23] unto him that is able to carry out his
[1:09:26] purpose and do super abundantly more
[1:09:29] than all we dare ask or think infinitely
[1:09:32] above our greatest prayers, hopes or
[1:09:34] dreams according to the power,
[1:09:36] expectations that is at work within us.
[1:09:40] Someone shout hallelujah.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's a God of promises.
[1:09:46] Amen. And his promises are still yes and
[1:09:50] amen. There is no variableness with God.
[1:09:54] He's unchanging in nature. He's
[1:09:56] unchanging in decree.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now this is the reason why I
[1:10:03] say when we get into those heavenly
[1:10:04] places, let you take these scriptures.
[1:10:06] I'm going to give you a couple
[1:10:07] scriptures and I'm going to shut up.
[1:10:08] Hallelujah. Amen. God cannot lie.
[1:10:13] Numbers 23 and 19. God is not a man that
[1:10:18] he should lie,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; neither the son of man that he should
[1:10:22] repent. Hath he said, and everyone say
[1:10:25] it with me, shall he not do it? Hath he
[1:10:30] spoken? And y'all say it with me. And
[1:10:33] shall he not make it good?
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, that should be enough right there to
[1:10:40] to send you to those heavenly places
[1:10:41] right now. G.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; That should be enough to just put you
[1:10:45] right over the moon right there. Amen.
[1:10:47] Beside Jesus and said, "All right, I I'm
[1:10:49] standing right here with you." Amen. All
[1:10:51] things are possible. Can you say amen?
[1:10:54] All right, let's look at this one. He's
[1:10:55] the author of every good and perfect
[1:10:59] gift. Let's look at it. James 1:17.
[1:11:03] Every good gift and every perfect gift
[1:11:06] is from above and cometh down from the
[1:11:09] Father of lights with whom is no
[1:11:12] variableness
[1:11:14] neither shadow of turning. God is God's
[1:11:18] not shaky
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; and God's not double-minded.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only way God could be
[1:11:25] double-minded and that would be drunk.
[1:11:27] And he's not drunk. He's got a steady
[1:11:29] mind. When God thinks something, it is
[1:11:32] forever. God called you, it is forever.
[1:11:35] If God said you're his son, it is
[1:11:38] forever. If God said you're his
[1:11:39] daughter, Len, it is forever. It is
[1:11:42] God's divine decree and it's forever.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Len was telling me this morning, she
[1:11:50] said, "You just preach to all the guys
[1:11:52] all the time and not the not not not the
[1:11:53] women." So, Amen. sons and daughter.
[1:11:56] Amen. All right.
[1:12:00] Now, amen. So, so the the the promises
[1:12:04] there's no changing.
[1:12:08] There's some of some of you, you had a
[1:12:10] girlfriend and then you
[1:12:12] she ain't the one. Amen. There's some of
[1:12:15] you that that's that's that's that's
[1:12:17] tried jobs. This ain't the one.
[1:12:21] But when God does something,
[1:12:24] it's perfect. And when God says
[1:12:26] something, it's perfect. You can believe
[1:12:29] him. Now, now, now, now catch this. Now,
[1:12:31] he's he says, "Come down from the father
[1:12:33] of lights with whom there is no
[1:12:35] variables, no shadow of turning." And
[1:12:37] then he then he then he begins to show
[1:12:39] you who you are of his own will be he us
[1:12:45] with the word of truth that we should be
[1:12:50] a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
[1:12:55] What creatures? The heavenly creatures.
[1:12:57] the sons and daughters of God.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was the firstborn among the
[1:13:04] creation. Amen. Jesus was that new
[1:13:07] creation. Amen. We've already gone
[1:13:09] through that with with with with a lot
[1:13:11] of scriptures here in the past. Jesus
[1:13:13] was the firstborn of the new creation.
[1:13:16] That's why you are born again. You can't
[1:13:19] look at things through these eyes,
[1:13:20] through these ears, through nothing. And
[1:13:22] if you do, you're going to be the most
[1:13:23] miserable guy and woman there is.
[1:13:25] Because there is nothing that that there
[1:13:28] is nothing stable about this stinking
[1:13:31] flesh.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Nothing stable about this body. Nothing
[1:13:35] stable about this world. Hallelujah. But
[1:13:38] he's saying God doesn't change and
[1:13:40] there's no variableness in him. And then
[1:13:42] he gives you a little wink and says,
[1:13:44] "And you are off the you're a chip off
[1:13:47] of the old block
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; of his own will be get he us with the
[1:13:52] word of truth." You're a chip off the
[1:13:54] old block. So that's telling you deep
[1:13:56] down inside you can stand up with the
[1:13:58] word of God and say, "I believe it. I
[1:14:00] claim it."
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Everyone
[1:14:06] of of my dreams, if God were to speak
[1:14:09] here tonight, he would stand up. If God
[1:14:11] were to speak tonight, amen, say, "Hey,
[1:14:13] Wendle, I want to use the microphone for
[1:14:15] a minute." And he would he would he and
[1:14:17] he'd stand up and say, "Hey,
[1:14:20] every one of my dreams
[1:14:24] come true."
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Every dream that God has ever dreamed,
[1:14:32] every thought that he has ever thought
[1:14:36] has come to pass.
[1:14:40] [Music]
[1:14:42] Isaiah 55:8, "My thoughts are not your
[1:14:45] thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
[1:14:47] sayaeth the Lord.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; As the heavens are higher than the
[1:14:50] earth, so are my ways higher than your
[1:14:53] ways, and my thoughts than your
[1:14:56] thoughts. For as the rain cometh down,
[1:14:59] and the snow from heaven, and returns
[1:15:02] not there, that but waters the earth,
[1:15:05] and maketh it to uh uh uh uh to maketh
[1:15:09] it bring forth and blood, that it may
[1:15:12] give seed to the swer, and bread to the
[1:15:15] eater, so shall my word be that goes
[1:15:19] forth out of my mouth. It shall not
[1:15:22] return unto me void, but it shall
[1:15:24] accomplish. Someone shout hallelujah.
[1:15:26] that which I please, and it shall
[1:15:29] prosper in the thing that I have seen
[1:15:31] it. You shall go out with joy and be led
[1:15:35] with peace, and the mountains and the
[1:15:37] hills shall break forth before you into
[1:15:40] singing, and all the trees of the field
[1:15:42] shall clap their hands. You know what
[1:15:44] he's talking about? He's talking about
[1:15:46] redemption. He's talking about, sons of
[1:15:48] God, the time is coming. The time is
[1:15:51] coming. I've given you my word. You are
[1:15:54] going to stand in your position once
[1:15:56] again.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Dear God, have we been a blessed people
[1:16:00] to know these kinds of things?
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; My word's coming to you and it ain't
[1:16:07] coming to you void. My word's going to
[1:16:10] come back to me, but it ain't coming
[1:16:12] back void.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to see the
[1:16:16] accomplishment of what I have spoken.
[1:16:18] I'm going to see it living in you. I'm
[1:16:20] going to see my word coming to pass
[1:16:21] through you. I'm going to have sons and
[1:16:23] daughters that are living in the glory.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Well, I could just shut up right now and
[1:16:31] I we could all go home and I guarantee
[1:16:33] you those are some good thoughts to be
[1:16:35] thinking about.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. Oh, get out of
[1:16:41] that doom and gloom stuff. Get up there
[1:16:43] in those heavenly places. And I'm here
[1:16:44] to tell you, I really feel in my heart
[1:16:47] God's going to do something special.
[1:16:49] I just believe God's going to do
[1:16:51] something special. You know why? Amen.
[1:16:54] And it's not because God's feeling sorry
[1:16:56] for us. Their sons and daughters coming
[1:16:59] into their position and expecting.
[1:17:01] They're expecting. Sons and daughters
[1:17:04] are believing. We're not We're not
[1:17:06] beggars. We're sons and daughters of
[1:17:09] God. And we're coming into this meeting
[1:17:12] expecting to meet with God.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now remember without
[1:17:18] the promise there is no expectation
[1:17:23] without the expectation
[1:17:26] there is no preparation.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; So if you don't have this settled in
[1:17:31] your heart
[1:17:34] if this is just one among many among
[1:17:37] many things
[1:17:39] then the expectation's not going to be
[1:17:40] there and the preparation's not going to
[1:17:43] be there.
[1:17:46] expectation. Without the promise,
[1:17:48] there's no expectation. Without
[1:17:50] expectation, there's no preparation. The
[1:17:53] promise is here in order to generate
[1:17:57] expectation.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; And then expectation
[1:18:01] causes preparation which brings to pass
[1:18:04] the promise that God has given. Can you
[1:18:07] say amen?
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. Amen. I love
[1:18:13] that. I love that. Praise the Lord. The
[1:18:16] word becomes vision to you. It becomes
[1:18:19] the absolute and you walk only by that
[1:18:24] sight and that sight alone. If the
[1:18:27] musicians would come.
[1:18:30] Hallelujah.
[1:18:32] Hallelujah.
[1:18:34] Brother Bradom says the Christian faith
[1:18:36] is based solidly upon rest.
[1:18:40] That's right. A Christian is not tossed
[1:18:43] about.
[1:18:44] A Christian doesn't run from place to
[1:18:46] place.
[1:18:48] A Christian doesn't fuss and fume and
[1:18:50] worry about things.
[1:18:52] A Christian rests.
[1:18:54] It's all over. It's all finished for the
[1:18:58] believer at Calvary.
[1:19:01] Oh, sickness
[1:19:02] may come and disappointments, but the
[1:19:06] Christian is at rest knowing this that
[1:19:09] God is able to keep that which he has
[1:19:14] performed.
[1:19:16] Amen.
[1:19:18] We accept that word tonight. I'm
[1:19:20] accepting that word tonight.
[1:19:23] I'm releasing my faith. It's because of
[1:19:26] the promise that was given. It's because
[1:19:27] the message of the hour. The message of
[1:19:29] the hour has come to release my faith.
[1:19:33] Amen. The book of Galatians third
[1:19:35] chapter says, "Before faith, before
[1:19:37] faith, we were shut up unto faith under
[1:19:41] the law, but we're no longer under the
[1:19:43] law of sin and death. Now the promises
[1:19:47] are real." God says, "My word is yes and
[1:19:52] amen, and there's no variableness."
[1:19:55] Then he turns around and says, "Hey,
[1:19:57] you're a chip off the old block. You can
[1:20:00] walk in that same kind of faith." And I
[1:20:02] say, "So be it, Lord." We're going to
[1:20:06] walk in that kind of faith. Hallelujah.
[1:20:09] Walking with that assurance. Well, can
[1:20:11] you say amen? Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:20:16] Take all my skepticism away, Lord.
[1:20:19] Take all the doubts. Squatch the doubts.
[1:20:23] All the sin put under the blood.
[1:20:27] Standing pure and clean. We're looking
[1:20:30] at everything in our hearts and our
[1:20:33] minds.
[1:20:35] Might need to go make things right
[1:20:38] with a brother or sister,
[1:20:41] mom, dad, husband, wife,
[1:20:45] because you don't want no hindrance from
[1:20:47] the word of God.
[1:20:50] anything, any kind of vibration of your
[1:20:52] soul. God don't want no variableness.
[1:20:53] Now, there's a vibration in your soul.
[1:20:56] Your faith knows that. You can't fake
[1:20:58] it. Your soul knows it. Just go get it
[1:21:00] right. Go make it right with God. Go
[1:21:03] make it right with your brother. Go make
[1:21:05] it right with
[1:21:07] whoever it is. Whether it's might be
[1:21:09] your boss.
[1:21:11] Get things right.
[1:21:13] Be honest. Be pure.
[1:21:16] Because God has called us to purity.
[1:21:21] And this ain't a bunch of flapping jaws
[1:21:23] and this ain't a bunch of charismatic
[1:21:25] junk. Name it, claim it.
[1:21:28] Well, we live like the devil.
[1:21:31] No. No. You're a germ seed of God.
[1:21:36] And God can't bless when there is sin.
[1:21:40] He sure ain't going to bless you with a
[1:21:41] closer walk with him.
[1:21:44] And you might be blessed in the natural,
[1:21:46] but you can't you can't look at the
[1:21:48] natural things as a blessing as if God's
[1:21:51] pleased.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Israel was blessed.
[1:21:56] And they they they are eternally dead.
[1:21:59] Israel was blessed. The elect was
[1:22:02] drinking from the water that came out of
[1:22:04] the rock, the supernatural,
[1:22:06] just like the other two million. But the
[1:22:09] other two million, amen, could not walk
[1:22:12] with God. Could not believe God.
[1:22:16] Miracle after miracle, God blessing them
[1:22:19] here, God feeding them mana, God doing
[1:22:21] all of that, but they never would
[1:22:23] change. They never would get things
[1:22:26] under the blood. They they they said,
[1:22:28] "Oh, but God's blessing me. He just gave
[1:22:31] me drink. He's g No, that's not who we
[1:22:34] are. Amen. Those people died. But those
[1:22:37] that elect that came under the prophet
[1:22:40] Moses and said, "We want to believe that
[1:22:43] word the way you have preached it. Teach
[1:22:45] us how to get over to the other side."
[1:22:48] Did you know that even when they were
[1:22:50] going over to the other side, Moses came
[1:22:53] out with the command of God and says, "I
[1:22:57] want you to sanctify you yourselves." He
[1:23:00] said, "Don't even come at your wives."
[1:23:02] He said, "I want these next three days.
[1:23:04] I want you to sanctify your hearts and
[1:23:07] purify yourselves.
[1:23:10] Get ready to cross over into that
[1:23:11] promised land. It's very serious. It's
[1:23:15] very serious with with this great vast
[1:23:21] of inspiration that God has given us is
[1:23:24] also great responsibility.
[1:23:28] Great responsibility.
[1:23:30] I'm not free. I'm not free to hate my
[1:23:32] brother. I'm not free to carry grudges.
[1:23:36] I'm not free, amen, to smoke my dope.
[1:23:40] I'm not free to drink that alcohol. I'm
[1:23:42] not free to live in adultery. I'm not
[1:23:45] free, amen, to go chasing other girls
[1:23:48] and and and and commit adultery on my
[1:23:50] wife. I'm not free.
[1:23:53] The word has come to me and I am to
[1:23:57] sanctify myself before him and say,
[1:24:00] "Here I am.
[1:24:03] Wash me
[1:24:05] as I look in the mirror of your word.
[1:24:08] Wash me. I see some things in here. Wash
[1:24:12] me. Purify me. How many wants a pure
[1:24:16] heart? Now, I I I done some of the
[1:24:18] natural the the things that you know,
[1:24:20] just common sins. But you know your
[1:24:23] heart. You know that if you've got a
[1:24:26] grudge in your heart towards somebody,
[1:24:28] you know that if that that if you don't,
[1:24:30] you know,
[1:24:33] you're on the that internet all the time
[1:24:35] and you're so drunk with that internet
[1:24:37] and you're just numb to the things of
[1:24:39] God to you can't even get you can't even
[1:24:41] kneel down to pray anymore and feel his
[1:24:43] presence is because it's numbed your
[1:24:45] spirit.
[1:24:47] You you're you're you're a son of God.
[1:24:49] You're a daughter of God. you know,

[1:24:57] and I'm desperate for you. I am needing
[1:25:01] something from the Lord.
