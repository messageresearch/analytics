to worship with us and it's a wonderful day to serve the Lord we love him with all of our heart we're thankful for his grace thankful for his anointing Upon Our Lives man I thought I'd seen oh no okay I was fixing to say I seen I've seen Patrick uh and so I guess he's not feeling well here this morning and so why don't we pray for Patrick real quick father we Look to You Lord and as you would see Patrick in his condition Lord and how you've been dealing with him in his life and Lord how he is wanting to look to you and looking to you for changes and we've seen you working in his life already but God I'm asking that you would complete that work and that you would rebuke every demon that would try to Hinder that wayward son to come home I'm asking God that you would touch Patrick and whatever is wrong and that you would heal him but Lord we ask that you would keep after that soul and that you would bring him right back to Total 100 Redemption I thank you for it Lord and we look to you for that and we thank you for what you're doing and what you're going to do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen man we've prayed a long time for Patrick and and I'm still I'm believing for a a man for the Lord to make a Powerhouse of that young man and um amen and I've still got plenty of children out there that I'm that I'm claiming now they're not blood children amen but they're children of God and they're amen I've I've had a lot to do with their lives and and I'm believing for everyone that God's allowed me to influence all of them to come back home where they belong amen amen I believe it and so I think we should have that kind of confidence for our children for our grandchildren we ain't losing one of them can you say Amen amen and sometimes our children amen when they've come through Brokenness and things and they you know the the statistics say and if they there's a chance that there's a big huge chance that they're going to go follow the same cycle of Brokenness that I'm here to tell you when you confess that token over those children God's going to break that break that that cycle of Brokenness and can bring them in to that Redemption can you say amen amen so we're believing God for a hundred percent everyone say a hundred percent for Patrick amen I'm believing that well it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning it's a wonderful spirit that we feel let's look here in first Chronicles the 17th chapter and we'll start at the first verse we want to thank our musicians we appreciate them and um good to see brother and sister gadman God bless you we love them so much they're just dear and precious friends to us and we thank God for the beautiful Ministry that they both have amen they're a team and and we love the gadman family amen and just good to see everyone here today let's look here in first Chronicles 17 and one now it came to pass as David set in his house that David said to Nathan the prophet lo I dwell in a house of Cedars but the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord remaineth under curtains then Nathan said unto David do all that is in thine heart for God is with thee and it came to pass the same night that the word of the Lord came to Nathan saying go until David my servant thus saith the Lord Thou shalt not build me in house to dwell in for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I've brought up Israel unto this day but have gone from tent to tent from one Tabernacle to another and who wheresoever I have walked well with all Israel spake i a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to Feed My People saying why have ye not built me a house of Cedars therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David thus saith the Lord of hosts I have taken thee took thee from the Sheep coat and from following the sheep that thou shouldest be Rooter over my people and I have been with thee where theresoever thou Hast walked and have cut off thine enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of Great Men that are in the Earth and I will ordain a place for My People Israel and will plant them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more neither shall the children of wickedness waste them anymore as at the beginning can you say Amen amen let's go to the Lord once again in prayer father we thank you for your love we thank you for your grace we thank you for the anointing that we feel this morning and we're asking the Lord that you would be with us as we Minister your word in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning amen we want to continue speaking brother Levi it's good to see you and your sister here with us this morning God bless you we want to continue a thought that we administered on a couple of weeks ago divine order in the Church of the Living God and we have dealt with the um the deacons during that time two weeks ago as we as as we looked at those offices and and so today I want to to uh continue in my thought if we will um we want to have we're going to be voting here before long or this this morning on on um Deacon and trustees and Treasurer and and but I I want us to look here this morning about our what what God is doing what God's desire is to be with his people the Church of the Living God the church is not a it's not a building but you are the Church of God David desired to build a house for Jehovah David lived in in a great house it was a house of Cedar and with great Grandeur and and he was it was beautiful and and um different ones from the kings of the different nations that had sent and and um they there was the soft Cedar there was the hard Cedar there was the Cedar uh from from all over the world that was brought in and one day as David was looking there at the at the blessings that God had given him and um amen he began to think of that Ark as he as he looked out and and the Ark was still behind skins and and as he beheld it he said God deserves the best God God deserves he man I here I am living in a nice house and God is living in a tent is the the the the the Ark of the Covenant and as the prophet Nathan listened to the heart of David his heart was overwhelmed as as he listened to David expressed his love for God and and and the observation and the honor for that David had for the Ark of the Covenant and for God and and the prophet responded and said do all that is in thine heart for I'm sure God is pleased with it and and while God was truly pleased with it yet God wouldn't let David build it he said David you're a man of war man if you would continue to read you would find that God says you have you have shed blood you have you have won many battles you fought many battles then you have you have done great feats for My People Israel but I'm not going to allow you to build a tabernacle Iman but he says your son your son Solomon shall build me a house Solomon is not going to have to do all of the war like you have Solomon is going to reign in peace and I'm going to anoint Solomon to build me a house and man God gave great consolation and if you had finished reading the chapter amen God promised David I love you David and I love your heart I I love your sincerity for me and toward me and I promise you David I I'm going to remember your seed amen forever I'm going to remember your seed and amen so here Solomon built a temple it was a more permanent Temple than than Moses is now he's still built according to Moses Tabernacle in the wilderness amen Moses had built a tabernacle that he has seen in heaven of course Moses Tabernacle was a portable Tabernacle it was one that could man be put up and then let down as they went through them through the uh Wilderness for the 40 years going into to canaan's land and it remained behind the badger skins amen and it would move from place to place but you see that Tabernacle it it was not just the Tabernacle that that made Israel so so special or so powerful within that Tabernacle was the Ark of the Covenant the Ark of the Covenant is where amen Jehovah dwelt he dwelt he would come down in between the cherubims amen and that great light would would come down the Shekinah Glory would rest over that Mercy Seat and there the priests would come in amen once a year and and would offer sacrifices for Israel and God would come down and God would forgive him of their sin and God's glory was with them the anointing would be there they were god-separated people Israel was God's chosen Nation they were ones they were a people that God a man had chosen to themselves and he would fight their battles he would he would be there and heal the sick he amen wore that Ark of the Covenant was God was there amen did you know that Ark of the Covenant represents the word of God today amen the word the word of the Lord is there is where the glory of the Lord is you know why the devil wants to come and take the word out of your heart because he wants to take the glory of the Lord from you he wants to take the presence of the Lord from you why has God left laodicea and all of the nominal churches is because the word has been taken away God dwells with his word anytime that Israel would sin and we've we've read through the history of Israel amen through the scriptures they're in Chronicles in the Kings and and and and the different books there where amen when the when the Iraq was was taken away Israel was as helpless as any other Nation they would become slaves unto the Conquering Nations because the word of God was not with them so Israel learned a man to treasure that word treasure that Ark of the Covenant not the Ark of the Covenant man it was a it was a box made of wood and then it was over laid with gold amen inside and outside speaking of the divine nature of Christ he would be God and man and how that he would come and and within that Ark was the was the Commandments was the two tables of stone Hallelujah now was one stone but two tables the new and the Old Testament was inside that Ark it was a type that Christ the man God would be word made flesh can you say man are you understanding a song a Solomon was building a temple and it was a magnificent Temple it would be a temple that wouldn't it would be a more permanent Dwelling Place it would be a grand place a grand Tabernacle that would be known and become famous all over the world and the god of Heaven would come and visit among his people can you say man and I I like looking at them at the amen the different uh characteristics of this temple in Iman and the many years that it took Solomon to build the temple amen did you know that there was material that was shipped from all over the world into Jerusalem amen it was a temple it was a uh there was material brought in from all the nations of the Earth and another thing that I want to I I thought was pretty fitting is everything was pre-cut that there was a a blueprint that was made up and they would cut the end and the the lumber and fashion the stones to pray to fit precisely into that building did you know that the scripture says that there was not the buzz of us all or a ding of a hammer the entire time that they were putting that building together amen there in First Corinthians or first first Kings six and seven and it says in the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither and so that there was neither Hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in the building now think about that are a hammer that was ever hit on the property there was never an ax that was used it was also precisely put together that when they got together they just simply put the kit together you say brother Wendell what are you trying to say here you see the scripture says that you are the Tabernacle of the Living God are Lively Stones you I want to say here this morning amen that you are the Living Stones you're a predestinated people God has placed you in his building just exactly where you belong you see Solomon's billing was an incredible building but what did what what did the scripture say Amen if you were to to to read there in amen uh acts 7 and 47 it says but Solomon built him in house albeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my full footstool what house will you build me saith the Lord what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made these things when Jesus came he said sacrifices and offering thou wouldest not but a body body thou has prepared for me they're in they're in First Corinthians the 13th chapter I believe it is or the sixth chapter I'm sorry amen and the 19th verse the Apostle Paul says what no you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God you are not your own you are brought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods you see it wasn't God's desire to live in a great big amen the Mormon Tabernacle there in Utah it's not God's desire to to to to live in the Great Big Majestic Temple there in Jerusalem God was going to live in another Temple it was going to be a holy Temple it was going to be it was going to be a fleshly temple it was going to be made of mortal men and women boys and girls a temple that the Holy Spirit could it would be a living Temple oh can you say Amen amen yes sir oh how we should be surrendered in our hearts today how there should be a surrender saying God I want to fit exactly where you want me to fit in your kingdom I want your spirit to so live and abide and move and and it was in me can you say Amen a total surrender to God's will the Apostle Peter man says that you are living stones and that you make up the temple of the Living God well praise the Lord you see what a type that God has already designed you for the age that you live in has already designed your gift your talent your calling everything about you has been ordered and designed of God sometimes you wonder amen where do I fit in I want to tell you you're going you fit in sometimes you think I'm just the oddest person in the church amen no one loves me or amen I just wish that I was a little I wish I could just fit in the click a little bit more you know God gives us nature sometimes as just a little bit odd and that's okay William Branham was just a little bit odd compared to all of the other preachers Jesus was just a little bit odd compared to a lot of others amen Saint Peter was just a little bit odd compared to the rest of the eleven can you say Amen sometimes we're wanting to fit in sometimes we want to be somebody else no God's ordained you God's called you God's designed you and there is no way the kingdom of God can work there's no way this church can survive there's no way that we can come into a completion and a Perfection like this body of Believers is ordained to do without your peculiarness we need you well can you say man amen you see you as a stone was ordained of God you see my brother Wendell I'm so different Hallelujah that means you're going to matter [Laughter] some of you say if I could just sing amen but you can't and Hallelujah God's orgains you to have a part is that right not everybody can be singers not everybody can be musicians not everybody can be preachers but we must all accept that God has placed us in his kingdom there were many stones can you imagine all of these thousands and thousands and thousands of stones that were all coming in and every one of those stones had a place amen many of those stones looked odd but there was a place in the temple for every God peculiar Stone God had a place for them can I hear a great big amen it's a beautiful type because our Ministries which is amen it's an anti-type it shows that our peculiarity our way of worship amen our our out of the way we are designed the way that we're built the way that we think everything about you God designed you before you got here praise the Lord amen now when that Temple when that Temple came together there was a place for every Odd Stone to meet it and you may look a little bit well praised the Lord amen some of you need to look to your spouse and you know because there's always the one

evangelist on the field that can do it like Brother David there's only one Joe Green there's no one else can take Joe Greene's place sister Stephanie shape I want him myself amen you see there is that God has placed these gifts in our lives God has designed us before the foundation of the world for this day to make the building complete did you did you read there in Ephesians 2 and 9 if you want to put that up there sister keys I don't have it here amen but Ephesians I believe it's two and nine amen hallelujah nope that one's not it try four and nine nope that ain't it neither amen fitly framed the building freightly framed together amen fiddly frame amen it's actually in Ephesians four amen uh speaking the word in love it's gonna be the 12th verse maybe oh don't make me look bad again amen hallelujah I've got my new Bible up my other one's all marked up all right for the perfecting of the Saints for the working of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man somebody say perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Christ was the body of God singular you and I are the body of God plural we are members of one body let's go to the next verse there and then henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every window Doctrine by the slide of men in the cunning craftiness whereby they lie in sieve and lie and wait to deceive speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ can you say Amen there's my scripture for from the home the whole body somebody say the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every somebody say every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love can you say Amen so I can't say the hand can't say Amen well I don't have no need of you or the the toe can't say it because I'm not the eye I don't no we are all in this together the building of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Brennan would say I think in the building today of the spiritual house that God worships in I think that's been a great failure today among the builders we have come with our denominations and have laid them in sincerity we have sent our boys to school to educate them to speak well before a congregation learn them psychology and Bible History and we have did everything and built fine pews and made towering Steeples and beautiful music and so forth we have built but we find out that there's something wrong we've tried to build it out of man-made material what education could produce what seminaries could bring out of them what scholarship we've tried to build it upon education upon scholarship upon denomination all these things will not work as long as we have not accepted the odd storm The Peculiar Stone and we know that as the Cornerstone Christ Jesus but as the building began to materialize they realized that the hall was left and the Odd Stone fit it to the DOT and that's where the spiritual Builders are today that's why the bride building of Christ is not ready for the bridegroom is because the builders have rejected the Chief Cornerstone which was laid on the day of Pentecost which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's been odd people act funny they don't they don't come into the order of our psychology of our educational our learning our Creeds that don't fit in there they've kicked it out because it was too odd too peculiar too disagreeable with the plans that we have made is the ideas of what the church ought to be and it ought to be a group they say it's all to be a group of polished Scholars it ought to be a group of fine dress people it ought to be a group of something where where we have tried to make an educational program or something that we could please our five senses something that we could see taste feel or something most of it has been through the site look at our fine people look at our best crowds in the city the mayor comes to our place the executive of our city the chief of police comes to our church and then we find out that it comes down to the actual building and all we've got is mortar and some rock the building did not go on they rejected the way the stone had been so prepared the stone that God had so prepared for it they rejected it can you say amen amen now God we find that in the in in laodicea today we have found that the Chief Cornerstone Jesus Christ the word the Living God the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not where it need can we can you say man but I want to say today that God's got God God still got a building and those denominations might have pushed him out and those others might have pushed him out there is a people though in minority that is going to say God put me in your building put me in your bill use me now I want to tell you I don't care whether you're a little kid or whether you're you're you're an elder it doesn't matter God's got a purpose for you or you would not be here God's got a place for you or you would not be here he has designed you what can you say man amen what kind of a house is God going to live in it's not a big building with a big Bell on the top of it amen it's not a high steeple but a body thou has prepared me it's a body that God can walk in it's a body that God can see in it's a body that God can talk in it's a body that God can work in it's a living body of Jesus Christ Church of the Living God I say today Amen Let us let us remember that without me without you this church cannot thrive can you say Amen but it's a life that's in Christ be in you it shall Quicken you now Iman we look here David prophesied they're in Psalms 46. and four not talking about a temple but he was talking about the Temple's plural of God if you look there at Psalms 46 and 4 it says there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God and the holy place of the Tabernacles plural of the most high God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved God shall help her and that ride early you see this church building this morning is simply the meeting place of the Tabernacles of God this is just simply the meeting place this is where all the Tabernacles of God come in and the Shekinah Glory comes Among Us through the temple of God the Holy Spirit lives in you what we must that Paul he he oh he he he he's so demonstrated that that the church must work effectually together that when the gifts come together amen we we should all feel like we have a part right not just a song leader singing and a preacher preaching but that we all belong into this great body of God we want every gift in this church to be used to its fullest whether it's in song whether it's in music whether it's in amen ushering or or or checking on the elderly or being a deacon or a trustee we must dedicate ourself with great sincerity to what God has called us to be praise the Lord did you know that even you singers that there was high priority placed on over the singers did you know that that singers that would go ahead did you know that there were sinner [Music] did you know that Levites we're singers and musicians now we sometimes we look at the Levites as just the preachers but there were also Levites that were singers and musicians and those singers and musicians had to be consecrated just the same as every other priest well it don't matter what lifestyle I live I'm a singer hey I'm not a preacher you are required the same dedication if the preacher has to prepare and the song leader has to prepare in prayer every musician should be preparing in prayer every singer should be in prayer listen you've been given a gift don't just use your songs and and and and and still singing songs that you learned 20 years ago amen be fresh let your gift let your gift be real you say brother Wendell that's you ought to learn that one amen hahaha no you got to keep singing that song you that we like your song brother Michael amen Michael and Joel Forney is the only one that can get by was singing the same song Amen [Laughter] given you I think I think we ought to be serious with our gifts praise the Lord we should be powerful in choosing our songs I I I I don't think we should just get up and sing songs because they rhyme I think we need songs that can bring the glory of the Lord down that can encourage the bride in her position because we are in the very last of the milliseconds of time and what we do matters every song matters every service matters every prayer matters everything about this last day bride matters I don't want to waste a song I don't want to waste a prayer I don't want to waste anything we are going home [Applause] and we've got to be serious about this we are on the last front the enemy The Last Enemy is death death has spiritual death has struck all of the churches it is totally strictly odyssia until people have no conscience they have no conscience at all they can claim to be a man they can claimed to love God and carry his word and and still they man be lesbians and homosexuals and and still live filthy lives than in pure lives their consciences are seared and you live in that same condition you live in a world of lukewarmness you you you you you live in a world of lukewarmness and godlessness you live in this world and it's required of the church to stand there amen and keep her garments undefiled you must be undefiled you cannot serve God and serve the devil at the same time you cannot be a singer and live out there in the world and looking at filthy stuff on your on your phones you cannot you know you smoke a cigarette when no one's watching her or pop a pill Amen in the in the secrecy of your own time and serve the Lord God's called us in this final hour and the scripture says there's going to be a bride without spot wrinkle or any such blemish he's coming after one that is subject to him as the head he's coming to one who has made him the headship what can you say man everything about my life it should be done in seriousness it should be done in prayer there should be prayer ringing all the time in the homes of the elect because this is the Midnight Cry him and the Death Angel is passing over it's already struck all of the world it has struck the churches it is struck our schools it instructed kingdoms and brother it'll strike anybody inside this church that is not under the blood of Jesus Christ it'll strike anybody in this church that is not right with God the death angel don't matter it don't matter it don't matter whether you belong to this Tabernacle here this is just a shell what matters is the God of all glory living in you are you a tabernacle for the most high God can you say math amen now let me just be a singer let me be a consecrated singer don't let me just be a man you know a a cleaner one that's cleaning the the church now let me just be hey man one that is that that is you know let me be a dedicated one let me be a consecrated one in everything that I do can you say man amen I want to be anointed I want to sing songs that are anointed I want the blessings of God because I am a priest and as a live I had or as a minister I am singing song and that anointing and that word must hit at the heart of somebody else that's the only reason I'm singing I'm a minister well praise the Lord amen they're in first Chronicles they're 25 and one this is moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of asaph and human and uh Jennifer who should prophesy with harps with sultry and with symbols now this is amazing because when you when you look at it it's not that they are going to be prophesying as in a prophet prophesying Iman but you see there with their music there is something that is that is coming coming out it's it's an expression should prophesy in other words should accompany their music and their instruments you're prophesying how am I prophesying with music you're taking the word of the Lord just as God said there in the book of uh in there in in Revelations 10 and and nine for Thou shalt prophesy again it's not that you're a prophet it's not that but you are taking the revealed word of the hour you're singing it you're putting it on your music you're putting it in your vocal course you are prophesying the words of the Lord to the people I've been in Services where the anointing so comes upon a singer as he or she is singing the glory of the Lord so come down in that church the people would just begin to weep they have seen people fall prostrate or just all over the building laying down in such reverence and respect coming from a song he said well we don't believe in songs brother when we just believe in the word well your Prophet believed in songs and the Bible believed in songs I believe in songs and so should you anointed songs that can bring the presence of the Lord down in the congregation oh can you say Amen you could go on down and and and and you know it goes down to the second verse of the amen of the sons of asaph and it talks about the singers which prophesied according to the order of the king and then the third verse amen it's it's talking about the sons of uh Jennifer and goes on down and it says at the end who prophesied with the harp to give thanks and to praise the Lord amen and you go on down to the fifth verse and Herman has has 14 sons and three daughters and the Bible says all these were under the hands of their father the sixth verse for a song in the house of the Lord with symbols and sultries and harps for the service of the Lord can you see man and the total of everyone that was there was 204 score and eight that would come in and would worship they would come in and sing the songs that was quite it must have been quite a band quite a it was quite the deal can you say Amen you see but they had to be consecrated dedicated to the Lord is this okay this morning you see what we want we want the presence of the Lord when Solomon got through building his house and it was a it was a beautiful glorious Temple but yet it was an empty Temple it had it had all of the furniture in it but it was an empty Temple and the Bible said that when Solomon killed I can't remember how many how many uh uh sacrifices he offered but they were thousands of sacrifices and as the blood of the Bulls and the goats were where where where where amen were sacrificed and the blood was rolling and the spirits of those Lambs was coming off the Bible says that God came into the temple the Shekinah presence of God so come into Solomon's Temple that the priest could not even Minister anymore the glory of the Lord the blood of bulls and goats because they were so at one with their call and their desire they were so at one and their willingness to make this go and it's it's an incredible story if you go back and look at the history if you go back and read these scriptures when you looked here at [Music] come down so strongly I'd love to see the glory of the Lord come down strongly I'd love to for this for this place to be such a beautiful place that for God not a beautiful place because of the beautiful building but a beautiful place because of the character of the people a beautiful place because all of the Tabernacles amen are all coming in together the character and the beauty of the people and God being so pleased with what we are and what he's made us to be oh can you say amen hallelujah and emplacing us and molding us and making us in his place oh my they're in second chronicles the fifth chapter it's got 14 verses and I'm not going to read it but you man if you you could you could look there when Solomon had finished the house and everything that was dedicated and everything was in place and he made sure everything was right according to the word of God and that's when the glory of God came down can you say man amen and and if you were to break in and and uh amen it you know they said that the uh man uh we just we just go ahead and these men started this seventh verse they're in a second chronicles five and seven it says then the priest and brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and to its place to the Oracles of the house into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims and the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the Ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above and they drew out the staves of the Ark and the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracles but they were not seen without and there it is unto this day and there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put in at horrible therein in horrible when the Lord made a covenant with Israel children of Israel when they came out of Egypt and it came to pass when the priests came out out of the Holy place for all the priests that were present were Sanctified and did not wait but course and also the Levites which were the singers and all of them of asaph and him and Gibson with their sons and their the Brethren being a raid in white linen having symbols and sultries and harps stood at the East End of the altar with them 120 priests sounding with the trumpets then it came even to pass as the trumpeters and the singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and the symbols and the music instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God if that can be done through the Bulls of goat and a temporal Tabernacle how much more right here today worship brings us into his presence and so I wanted to I wanted to bring that in this morning as we as we are still talking about the divine order of the house of God and I wanted you singers and you musicians to know how sacred of a call your gift is amen how sacred you're called is is that right I I think we have wonderful musicians and wonderful singers I think we have we have wonderful song leaders I I think leaders of worship leaders of worship should be uh prayerful I I think that I think every song leader should should be a well adapted into entering into that Supernatural rim with God because if you've not been there and if you're not there on a regular basis communing with God and you don't know how to come into His presence how are you going to lead people into his presence you've got to come into His pre you've got to know how to get the people there and the only way you can get the people there is to come out in his presence and bringing them lifting them out of this Rim into that most holy place with God come on this building right now but some have never entered into that Realm and we must enter into that Realm can you say Amen so those those of you you you song leaders I I just as we as we are going through some of these things back through some of the basics remember Brothers that you who help to create that atmosphere for the word you sound must not hear the word with this they must hear the word with this and depending on what atmosphere is in the building is what takes place whether it's here or here well praise the Lord I think that the the the the the the song leaders should know how to enter into that presence of God I think every preacher you don't just sit down and read your Bible and get your computer out and put you a sermon together I think every preacher needs to be anointed of God now listen you say well that's just not no no no no no no every preacher must be anointed I don't care whether he's a teacher evangelist yes sir whether it's just a a minister as a as the helps here at a local congregation we should all know how to come under the anointing not just reading notes not just saying words but where the unction of the Holy Spirit comes down and makes those words live praise the Lord because everything about us is for his presence amen but now I'm not just putting that on the preachers and the song leaders because the scripture says we are all Kings and Priests unto our God that means we've got a responsibility we've got to know how to enter in so when you've got well praise the Lord when you've got an anointed song leader and you've got an anointed preacher and the people are just there to listen to songs and they're there just to hear a sermon you ain't coming in because you're not consecrated well you say Amen to me while ago that these singers boy this yes sir they better be consecrated but you're a priest too you are the temple of the Holy Ghost that means Your Vessel must be consecrated that means you can't come in here and sit well praise the Lord I'm here you can't come in and sit on a Pew amen and you've been out there listening to your sports channel all the way up to the time that you walk into the church come in here and sit down and expect to feel the presence of the Lord that means you can't just come in and sit down and just you know just sit down on the preacher as if well Hallelujah man this is a boring service well where are you at it requires every one of us consecrated to God in our positions that brings his presence down Among Us so when the church why do we come early is because Lord knows you need it when you're coming in on a Wednesday night and you're just as carnal as the day is long can I hear it amen Brothers you've been working all day you're tired you're weary you're wore out you don't want to be here well you shouldn't even come if you can't prepare that heart to come why do we come on a Wednesday night is because you need him well why come why come if you're not going to enter into his presence why come to church any service and you're not willing to do what is required to enter into his presence I'm preaching better than you're a man the scripture says come into His courts with praise and into his gates with Thanksgiving [Applause] now that's that's that's Old Testament saying come into His courts with praise enter into his gates with Thanksgiving praise ye the Lord bless his name but the Apostle Paul says that you give praise or sacrifices of Praise by the lips of your mouth well praise the Lord so if I am a priest offering sacrifices then I am required to be dedicated are y'all with me so it don't matter whether it's the preacher behind the pulpit whether it's the song leader whether it's the musician or whether it's the congregation we must all be consecrated it takes all of us you know what the Catholic Church done the Catholic Church took all of the spirituality from the congregation he says you all shut up sat down we'll do your praying we'll do everything for you that's right they took all of the gifts out took all of everything out now there's a few sacred men that's anointed to take care of everything for you we'll do your praying we'll do your singing we'll do everything for you and all you have to do is just repeat after us a couple times a few times then go out there and sin that's the Catholic Church that was what you called nicolaitanism it was to conquer the laity the Catholic church that nicolaitan Spirit conquered the church till the church had no responsibility that God or each other it was now a few holy men that was dictating what they were going to do how they were going to do it and then they would all agree and say oh man go home and live like the devil praise the Lord what's different about laodicea now laodicea is the people's rights so the first church age that spirit that was striking the first church age was the amen was the spirit of Nicola which was to conquer the laity seven Church ages later now it's people's rights it was the it was the it was the clergyman saying shut up do what we say say some Hail Marys this that and the other took the word took the song took everything away from the people right but now we're in laodicea now the people Hallelujah the people are demanding that the preacher does it all now it's the people demanding entertainment now it's the preach now it's the people comes in sits on the Pew drinks their coffee amen checking their tax and their stocks and whatever else while the singers are entertaining and the preacher is compromising and they'll pay them they'll pay their fee to be in the service and go home that ain't Church before it was the Catholic hierarchy that was going to kill you if you don't buy now it's the church seven days later or seven Church ages later that said demanding the same thing that the first we'll praise the Lord amen and so now everyone just dismantling now Hallelujah you say thank God we don't belong to those kind of churches yeah but you bring that same Spirit into this one come in here and sit down and just act like I ain't got nothing to do yes you do you'd be better off going and drinking coffee with the guy down the road at his church than to come in and sit in the house of the Living God and not have no love and adoration and offer praise and sacrifices from the heart of genuine love and genuine worship thanking God for everything that he is in your life I want his friends in our church I want his friends in my life of what his presence to be found by all around me oh God I want your presence in me [Applause] but we're as selfish people living in a selfish culture and we demand everyone else to do it you can't find anyone that's willing to be servants as trustees anymore servant says Deacon what do I got in it what kind of money is in it what kind of person that's too much work for me I ain't doing it you can't find anyone that wants to to just lay it on the line I'm not necessarily talking about it here but I'm just saying people want it they want what's in it for me everything is without me what about the work of God well praise the Lord I told you I'm here we're just set empty dead it's because somebody has not had that consecrated life that'll keep his presence with us can I hear an amen consecrated lives keeps the Holy Ghost real therefore when it's all of the temples of God come together it's just like a great big Glory Festival the city of our God is made glad because all of the temples of God are together and we are in love can you say Amen amen yes the preacher needs to be consecrated this sacred desk should be held to the highest should not be any hypocritical lines behind this desk there should be no man preach the gospel living a sinful life but we are to be first partakers we are to be those that live that life before the people not amen and in the church but they can see it in our lives out those doors can you see mine the song leaders should be one that their lives reflect this not a hypocritical life not one that is that is that is that is singing and and and and and and and and you know anointed behind the pulpit but outside the doors there's something else oh God I don't care whether you're boys whether you're girls or whether you're grandpas and grandmas our lives have got to be dedicated to this cause I don't care whether you're a well-known preacher or a or a little known for each lies my screen flat the presence of God because it's the anointing upon us it's the anointing upon us that is that is going to break the yokes can you say man amen yes do you love him here today that's for the order of our of Our Lives order of our services depends upon the order of Our Lives I don't want to look back in yesteryears and say huh I remember the good old days I I want to say that the that the glory of the latter is greater than the glory of the former [Applause] I believe the supernatural should be in every service I believe that and I am willing to put myself on the line because it's not the preacher it's not the song leaders not just the musician but it's all of us together making this happen can you say Amen now we have a little bit different we we stand to sing we worship uh there's other churches might sit and sing and others but I've just always thought you know he's worthy of everything that we can give him all of us participate in it and all of us is that right there's nothing wrong with that God's blessed it and honored it over the years but while we're doing it man we'll see what some some people have got it all together where amen song leader don't even have to tell you to stand up you just jump up anyway as well he's fixing to ask so I'm going to do it before he asks amen there's nothing enthusiasm for the presence of God and enthusiasm to sing and well praise the Lord I don't believe it's a sin to to smile in church I don't believe it's a sin to to lift my hands up and glorify God I don't believe it's a sin a man to to distract the service myself through my through my prayer and praise can you say man amen so I think the divine order yes all of us have a responsibility now I've noticed something while we're on this and I'm and we have sort of gotten away with the opening prayer ain't no sorta about it we have gotten away I don't know how we've done it but it just well I know sometimes we'll just come up and start singing the song that's already been sung or played and then we but I think I think we should I think and um and all of our song leaders have done it we've just we've just overlooked it but we should start our services with prayer you know if they're singing and we can finish that song out or whatever and then have a have a word of Prayer I think that's I and and uh and that was something that was brought to my attention thanks to brother Ken amen and uh hey and that's a good that that's a good suggestion amen if we're a Christian church we ought to open with prayer amen now and then another thing that I would like to ask while we're here is this okay today I'm not too keen on doing the the praying for a prayer request and praying for the for you know the way that we just changed that around that that sort of I don't like that idea amen the monetary things needs to be a separate prayer and and and and and prayer for one another I I don't know how that got started but we but what I would like to do is we could start bringing our we could start bringing our prayer request right break before the people right at the beginning of the church service for for you uh song leaders and that way we could we just do it right there as we're praying opening the service in prayer we can pray for the people and then later on if uh and hey it's it's it's it's okay to pray more than once in church and then and then we pray over the offering the offering is is something that we need to pray over that's that's for sure because that's where we're we're doing it as unto the Lord it is it is an offering it's it's it's it's something that you offer unto the Lord y'all understand that and we want God's blessings upon that and um uh so but but I I think that the you know we could start it with a prayer request and then and and just start right at the beginning and if brother Merle or brother Kobe or whoever's leading songs wants to um you know have someone to come up and start the service off with prayer I I you know I think that's fine too uh uh or or you don't have to you can do it yourself but but the thing is I what I what I like is just to keep that order we want to keep the order flowing if you notice we try to keep things flowing I I don't I don't like a song leader having everyone sat down you know you can be seated and now we want brother semi to come up and um and sing and see me saying huh I don't have a song prepared I've got to go find my phone I've got to go do this and then we're okay let's sing it one no let's just let's have let's let semi know ahead of time that he's going to be singing and then say semi if you would get ready and then we'll continue to sing the song and while he's over here and brother Harry's helping him get his microphone and then when that song stops then it's ready to go and and everything's flowing if you all notice that's why we try to do it around here we try to keep it flowing why because we we with this this ain't entertainment this is worship and when he comes up Simmy I want I assume he's already praying Lord let me be anointed Lord I Surrender my voice I Surrender my mind to you help me Lord and when he comes up and the anointing that's already on the musicians and the anointing that semi's already in because he's already been asked to sing he's prepared he's ready to go now the anointing and what it does there's no break in the continuity the presence of the Lord is still continuing y'all understand what I'm saying that way we can keep and I and I and I I learned that I I I I I I got to be honest I'm not the originator of that amen I I found that at brother brother musgrove's church and I I loved I loved the order I loved the the continuity and I and I came in and said I'd like to do that where we just sort of where we where we keep the continuity going and everything is Flowing the people yes it's another gift being used but it is a gift right because it's a gift I don't care whether it's the children singing or whether it's it's it's it's it whether it's a a professional singer or whether it's a an amateur singer it don't matter the anointing is what we're after you say ah well you said we have to be prepared but listen prepared in the presence of the Lord is not being prepared with your vocal doing scales on in your vocal cords before you get up there I'm talking about we want the anointing of the Lord no matter where and what we well am I doing all right Hallelujah [Applause] I want that because our whole reason for being here dear God I hope you all have that same desire her whole purpose were coming is his presence that's our whole purpose I want him to be pleased in my life and I have to take care of business before I even come to church in order for that I have to live a consecrated life before the Lord and then I'm preparing throughout the week I'm in prayer I'm not just preparing but when the Martin's got to spend time in prayer right because when I come out amen I represent the highest office of them all I'm representing the word itself is that right I'm representing that to the people and I must live that life but not just live it I've got to have his presence with me oh how many wants his presence with you I want my press I want his presence with me amen prayer must be essential oh God prayer must be essential I think deacons I'm not going to hold you too much longer how long have I been up here oh I'm 12 30 already deacons uh uh brother brother Harry we're we're we're fixing to have a vote on on brother Harry but that responsibility brother Harry is one of the it's it's it's it's one of the highest orders keeping this place clean and pure Brothers I mentioned it a couple weeks ago but we don't want we don't don't make that the congregating Place back there in the back you brothers that you ushers that'll be helping brother Harry or uh uh uh assuming he gets voted in today his who who's who who Who's ever back there don't don't don't take that lightly don't take it lightly don't don't be guilty of sitting back there and yakking and talking no keep the place that's not a congregating place that is a middle ground between this place and the bathroom that is not the break room well praise the Lord guys we get onto these kids but I think adults are worse congregating back there in the back and doing all that talking let's not do that we've come and we are a fellowship and group can I hear an amen and Buddy we'll find time to Fellowship but coming in I want to encourage everyone let's keep this inside yes we can whisper out there yes we can say hello how are you doing but but we don't need to be talking about the day's work and what we're going to be doing next week and amen you know uh you know whatever the carpenter the carpenter contractor telling the electrician contractor that they're flubs and whatever you know or what you know we we don't we don't we we want we want this no jesting nothing let's keep the place there's only the one thing that separates that and here is that that door right here because we want this to be a place you say do we have to do that brother we know you don't have to and the presence of God don't have to be here neither but my house shall be called the house of Gap my house shall be called the house of sermons my house shall be called the house of musicians my house shall be called the house of prayer because prayer is what makes it all come together I'll tell you right now I'm not good enough to preach A good sermon you know that but it's the prayers of the people that can help their Pastor friends I need your prayer sometimes the weight gets a little heavy and I just sometimes it's just Spirits even when things are going good and spirits will will try to attack me as as as pastor brink of crying all the time you know and I know what that is that's a that's a devil of depression trying to take over Wendell Martin well if I'm if I'm Bound by the devil how can I free anybody else well praise the Lord but prayer for one another prayer for your pastor prayer for these leaders prayer for these officers of the church prayer and and and and we're all praying for one another can you say Amen now I think that should be that should be wonderful so we want to keep that and and and wow and and the ushers should be looking to the deacon uh for for the uh you know guidance and and and and just making sure that that we've got the Deacon's mind and and and and keeping things together because we we have elected a deacon and that Deacon is there to make sure that everything is carried out can you can I hear an amen we talked a couple Sundays ago sometimes the Deacon's going to be right there and he's going to be telling he's going to come up and tell him hey he might even come up to the pastor's kids and say hey uh your child is out of line and the pastor's kids have got to say yes sir Mr Deacon amen right no man can no no no no we've elect we're electing that man to keep things pure and it's up to us to keep our hearts pure come on you come on you you have to keep your heart pure against me how many times you're going to want to get mad at me but the moment you allow it and you allow bitterness I can't help you anymore but when you understand that hey brother Wendell's got a job and if he's saying something that's pretty that's a little on the sharp side well there's a reason he's saying it Lord Lord let me consider what he's saying help me show me let me let me be right let me let everything about me let me have a pure heart before you so that I can accept what you're trying to say and then there's going to be times where the Deacon just flat out gets it wrong and you're still going to love him because he's a human being and your pastor is going to flat out get it wrong and you're going to have to forgive me and love me just like I have to I have to forgive you and love you amen they tasty it takes us all we're humans amen so so we we think we I thank the Lord for that now we are going to be looking at trustees brother Joe has been a faithful trustee and we appreciate him and um and so we're looking to elect some trustees uh another trustee and a Treasurer here today and I just want to look over the the office of a of a trustee in the bylaws it's the body of men that shall govern the welfare of the church as a business group they're elected to protect the church in financial manners it's business and Investments the supervision of its properties and as it as expenditures they shall strongly consider every move of progress step by step which involves Church funds for they shall be responsible to keep the church from indebtedness and the Saints from burdens that are too great to Bear financially so so I I you know we are the we have got we can't go out there be getting loans and be doing this and that and the other fleecing the people we've we've got to uh and and I think we've got men these men that are uh that that understand that in the undertaking of any project regardless of what it is they are to bring the matter to the pastor the consultation by the pastor and by and consultation by the pastor only for every Financial project the the church wishes to invest and engage itself in is absolutely required now that's that's according to the Tabernacles uh that's that's the the bylaws and so the trustees take care of the maintenance of the property I think I think uh we understand that as we went over a little bit a couple weeks ago they take care of the maintenance part the the the lawn care which would include the flower beds and and and you know make sure everything's all cared for the trustees would inspect the buildings and and and and and repair the buildings as as they see need you know and it's and sometimes it's not a it's it's not a fun project because sometimes it's leaky Folly toilets and faucets sometimes it's leaky roofs sometimes that's what the trustees are there for now we understand that the trustees are as as we went over a couple weeks ago are not the trustees are not the ones that have to do all the work right but they are the ones that bring that that that are keeping up you can't have you can't have a bunch of uh a bunch of chiefs and no Indians right and so we've gotta brother Mike amen and so trustees are there to to make sure that that the church law and everything is is running good uh uh we that that that that that that that the monthly uh uh you know that uh any kind of a progress that is going to be made um you the uh the trustees are there and US brothers and I appreciate you Brothers I I've noticed there's been a lot more uh communication going on these last couple weeks which is a good deal and again we appreciate brother Joe for that um but we We join in behind the goal and try to get things done you know we we all jump in there and and try to um get get those things done now you know the treasurer is not it's not a trustee per se but he takes care of the money and the finances of the church the treasure um deposits the offerings he he makes the monthly bills keeps the records of the of the church's Financial dealings and um and so uh uh the the treasure attends the trustee meetings and acts also actually takes uh acts acts as a secretary actually you know takes takes the minutes or the record of the meeting uh you know to keep keep the keep everything all on the same page and then sharing notes whatever with the trustees and um especially when the trustees are considering a project now so these men are are incredible I I I I remember at one time when I used to do the I was treasurer secretary uh pastor I was the maintenance guy and huh I was a song leader too and musician I've done that all for years some some people say oh you just don't yeah and you just got it so easy oh you should have seen that the other years we are blessed here today I I did I played the piano I just got to tell you a story I was just a kid I was just a kid I'm I'm 19 20 years old and I'm getting people saved and praise the Lord what my my pastor in growing up that I was growing up but he was he was going to help me he said I'm going to set you up he says you're gonna need you a song leader you're gonna need you so he comes up and he finds this woman says you're going to be Wendell song leader and his and his piano player and um so we had us we we she so she she was leading songs and and uh leading songs and playing piano on Sundays and playing at bars on Saturdays no joke true story and uh or plan on it might not have I I think there were bars they were they were they weren't they weren't Christian settings I'll tell you that all right and um and so I'm thinking this ain't good this ain't good and uh my bass player was a cigarette smoker I'm telling you I I'm telling you it was a wonderful thing back in Pentecost when I when I was a kid and so we had to end up taking over being piano player and song leader so I played sung songs took offerings preached the sermon [Laughter] I mowed the lawn I sure did that line right over there that big old Hill and all that over there that we all get together on oh yeah yours truly I'm the guy I used to mow that thing you know how many times I've and my lawnmower was the most I was a I was a poor 19 year old poor 20 year old I I listen I was poor and I had a lawnmower that was almost poorer than me and I'm here to tell you buddy I could tell you some stories of me and that lawnmower and me tumbling down that Hill and the Lord has blessed us the Lord has blessed our little church here we've got we've got wonderful men and women [Applause] and we appreciate these trustees just because y'all's not Deacons does not mean that you're not important we need and appreciate these men can you say Amen [Applause] now I know we're a big family we're all a big church family and we just now listen um I mean I I listen people come over and borrow stuff from me all the time and tell me a couple weeks later oh I've got your saw or I've got you know I mean hey that's you know because y'all y'all know it's somewhere out there in that junk and um and so uh and I've probably done it to you too but we've just borrowed and we just we're just one big happy family what is yours is mine and what is mine is yours and and uh usually when I can't find mine no one else has it and um in the same way with you right but no one can I hear an amen you don't even know what I'm saying you're saying I'm not going to say Amen except for Kobe he's trusting amen no one has the authority to put anything on the church accounts except for the trustees amen no one has the authority unless the trustees have has given you that authority to go down to the lumber yard or whatever and then and and and so that anything that is bought with the church money or going to be put on Church property needs to go through a certain Channel Hallelujah amen anything bought for the church even if it's your own money must go through the right Channel you want to put a basketball court outside there you're not either until you talk to brother Joe well I talked to everyone else no no no no no no no no no no the Chan the trustee is the channel can I hear an amen well I I want to do that that is wonderful and we're you must go through the proper Channel so any idea any proposal concerning anything on the church property must go through the proper channels no one should act alone without the authority of the trustees and pastor now if the trustees accept the idea the treasurers verify that there's money in the funds that are there all of this then we can proceed but we want we want to get this sort of we we are we're we're a country church and we've got that country feel and I want us to continue having that country feel listen a country church is just it's awesome we love our elders we treat our kids good and we love the Bible that's a good country church amen we just we just we just love one another we're all family right well we love the in between the kids and the elders too we love everybody but that's that's our feel but we want that proper Channel amen no one should raise money uh for projects except for the trustees God is not the author of confusion and neither should we allow it money should be raised through the channels and that's through the trustees only can I hear it amen now so we we want to now there's there are things where um there's going to be um you know I've authorized sister Stephanie to purchase Church supplies and stuff of that nature well so she don't have to go through the trustees she can go she can just go straight to the treasurer and and pick up and pick up the cleaning supplies for whatever you know a toilet paper or uh um you know and and whatever else that she is you know that she is needing here there's no needing of a board meeting and and things like that so but yet sister Stephanie is responsible to bring the receipts and and get those to the treasurer so that the treasurer will know and and have that in the records y'all understand that so I I'm not saying that no one can go get it it just got to go through the right connection if if the trustee says yes uh you know you you we need 10 gallons of paint well we can go get that but make sure you get that re uh uh get get the receipt to the treasurer because they are responsible they are responsible for the upkeep yes they're every for the maintenance yes and they're also responsible for that keeping the money uh in clear and keeping us out of debt amen you know uh uh another thing comes mindset uh sister Keys when she's buying the food well it's not like she's going to have to go and and talk to no it's something that's that's that um uh we we have her to to go and and actually it's you a sister uh sister Katrina is right there buying food and sister Stephanie I mean they're they're you know they're all there together so it's not like it's it's you know we require a big old board meeting for this well we know that the food's going to have to be bought we've we've we've got that accounted for this that and the other and so uh uh but but what I'm saying is is everything everything is going has got to go through our trustees when we do that now how many believes that's right amen [Applause] and you know as I have as I have talked about um as I've said in the in the past you know um we we're thankful for these men we appreciate brother brother Torrance for being so selfless in in keeping track of the money all of these years and and um and and and doing that and I know he hasn't felt good uh in these last couple years and and his and and has wanted to get out of it but and I appreciate brother brother Torrance I appreciate you being a team a team player and um and I and the reason I delayed so long brother Torrance because you're good at it and we have asked brother Merle to be a treasurer now he he is he has come from this he's he's from the same mold that brother Torrance is amen and uh and so you know we but we love brother uh uh brother Merle and appreciate his years of service here at the church and um um I he he is one that I I to be honest I asked him a year or so ago and then I I he sort of shrugged it off and I thought well okay maybe he don't want to do it so uh but uh here a couple weeks ago he he said if you still want me to do it I'll do it I'm thinking good Lord where you been and but uh I think I think brother Merle would fit the job very very well and and I mean that um and so uh he's retired he can it's it's he can help with the uh bank account and that kind of thing and so I think he's he would be very good now um there's going to be thinking I'm closing I'm fixing and I want us to have our I want us to have a vote here in just a minute I I I I want us to um uh consider these men I have I have prayed hours in in asking the Lord for for leadership in this direction and because we're we got to be a team you can't be a Maverick and and be a part of a team you have got we've all got to flow together you ushers have got to flow with with with uh the Deacon the trustees and Treasurer has got to flow together the pastor has to flow together with everyone we've all got our different uh positions and places but we all uh are working toward that goal and I'm thankful I I as I've discussed these this with the with the brothers individually they don't know what I've talked about or what anyone anyone else has talked about but their desire is for the church the trustees especially it's you know would love to see uh the you know would love to see that house put on the market and and and get some money and the end goal is is is to be able to get the money to move to get the fellowship hall over on this side and that way we're not paying utilities and taxes and whatever else for two buildings which would be quite an undertaking planning a lot of a lot of that and and and time you know down the road but I don't think that these brothers are are in this thing just just to have position that's what I'm I guess that's what I'm trying to say I think they've got the best interest of our church and they want that I believe brother Harry is a is a good man he's got a he's got a good nature about him and he loves you I believe we have seen that exhibited over the years and and and and back again to the trustees brother Merle has has got a track record Among Us brother Michael brother Joe have got track records brother Harry's been here with us now how many how long have you been with us now brother Harry four years and he's been a a just a tremendous blessing working helping wherever he can and and we appreciate that what I would like to do and this is we I'm not going to send out papers today um what I would like to do I would like for I would like for brother Harry as a deacon to come brother Merle if you had come brother uh Joe and brother Michael if y'all would come up to the front and um and I want you to just face this direction toward me and um I I have found that these these um these brothers uh are good men I what we're going to do who whoever is uh who who can vote and who can't vote if you have good church record you've been coming here and you've got uh uh and you've got um and you pay your tithes and offerings here then we'll let you vote here today now if you're not paying tithes uh and your offerings you're then you're not at that age to vote yet and um let's let's just let's just read let's just redo this 16 and up will have a right to vote uh as long as you're in perfect attendance or you you attend to this church and you've got your um uh you you pay your tithes and offerings now I want to start with the deacon I think the deacons uh life is is is is is important and I um I'm going to read this to you here real quickly before we have the vote and um praise the Lord I thought I had that here already praise the Lord do you love him who's yeah uh yeah you can you can you can cut you can cut that off or no keep it going we'll shut it off right afterwards because there's there's others that are watching that couldn't make it this morning amen all right so the qualifications of of a deaconesses likewise must the deacon be grave not double tongued not given to much wine not greedy a filthy looker holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience let these also be first proved let them use the office of a deacon and be found blameless even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things let the Deacon be husband of one wife ruling their children and their houses well for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves a good degree a great and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus and so I I feel that that brother and I'm going to give that opportunity to all of these we will elect these these four brothers today we'll give them a month and if they don't uh if if they don't feel like it's the job for them then then we'll let them out of their out of this but at in a month if you guys feel like this is something that you all want to continue then um the church would be honored to do so so I'm going to start with Deacon right now um could everyone bow their heads with no no peeking around everyone that finds brother Harry an honorable man filled with the Holy Spirit that would lead that would be able to lead and to love our congregation I want you to raise your hand if you're in favor everyone in favor okay all right you can put your hands down now everyone that is not in favor could you raise your hands okay all right brother Joe Greene he has been faithful for these last several years as a as a trustee and has done a wonderful job and I we want him to stay on everyone that is in favor of brother Joe would you raise your hand okay all right you can put your hands down those who are not in favor could you raise your hand okay all right brother Michael who has been raised here at the church and um has has loved the church as and even though he has gone through some incredible uh trials these last a couple years brother Michael has been faithful to the church and uh kept he's just a he's been a wonderful man to this congregation and so those that would be uh uh in favor of brother Michael being a trustee would you raise your hand okay those who would not be in favor of brother Michael would you raise your hand all right um brother Merle Applegate uh we we all know brother Merle been faithful to the church for for uh many many years and I think that he would make a wonderful Treasurer everyone that that would be in favor raise your hand all right and those that are not in favor would you raise your hand okay all right okay you can lift your heads now um every uh the the um we the you've found the favor of the people every one of you Brothers have been found uh favorable with the people for for these these tasks and I I say that we appreciate you brothers and um and remember this this Duty that you have before the Lord it's your duty bound to God uh for in these positions and so I pray that we all work together I wonder if the church would all rise now I want us all to come around these brothers amen I'd like for us to just come around them we're wanting to have word of prayer with them and ask the Lord's blessings upon them yeah just come on come on up y'all everyone just come on up here we want God's we want all of us to come as a people and ask God's blessings upon these brothers want

appreciate your your willingness to work and I know it's alive I know it's a lot of work but I appreciate you bro amenity praise the Lord Hallelujah praise the Lord I was I was going to get brother Torrance up here and let us shake his hand real quick as he's I think he just went back to the restroom we appreciate uh brother Torrance and um and his his uh dedication over the years and so brother Branham talked about the unified body he says now when one member would talk against the other member you know that's wrong you're commanded to pray for one another and not to talk against one another but to love one another if someone is down let's pick him up and help him let you know that makes us a unified group of believers and when they don't obey that then they don't obey God and we displease God therefore our church or people cannot prosper the church cannot go on is because we're a disunified together little 11 11's the lump he said now if the church board or the deacons would would come and say thinking they'd build a new Tabernacle and if that is the votes of the deacons and the trustee are consulted they don't have the money to do it and they have a building program like we have going on now the general lot then it's taken before the general audience as it should be and all the church being Sovereign Church votes for the new Tabernacle then we should all cooperate with new Tabernacle frankly myself when I when they spoke of the new Tabernacle to me I was against the thought that's right I said we don't need exactly a new Tabernacle I'll probably be leaving here pretty soon as as the Lord will it what he showed he comes to pass then what what do we need a new Tabernacle we haven't got the money and then I come down and felt the feeling of the church and the church and the majority seem to want it well then what did I do I sacrificed my own thoughts and thrown it in with the church let's do that if it's the way that we cast the Lots that's that's the way it was in the Bible time the way the church voted the sovereignty the groups of the people come together in unity their strength therefore I said certainly if that's the way the church wants if that's what God is wanting he's got more authority to vote among a whole group and then than it has to me because I have no vision to say it shouldn't be so we throw in with the church move with the church and I'm behind it to do all that I can to help that should be the motive of every Christian every person in the church is for it to unify ourselves and stick together whatever the church votes for is what we should stand for can you say Amen now if our idea seems to be different a little different from the whole church lets the SEC let's sacrifice that idea because that's the only way we can stand Unified is if this church will just go on the way we're going now unified together it's unlimited what he'll do if we will stick together amen amen amen [Applause] we thank the Lord for that and we appreciate that we're going to dismiss and brother brother brother Torrance would you come would you come up front here for a minute we want we want people to shake your hands just real quick as we dismiss you just after you shake your hands you're dismissed we appreciate this elder and um [Applause] brother Torrance has been a good friend and he's been a he's been a this this this guy is so particular he carries a notebook in his pocket for everything he buys do you still carry that notebook yeah I see he keeps he he I I've I've walked around with him I don't care whether what it is he writes that down he was a good Treasurer amen amen and I know I I know you're getting hungry and um uh uh and and and brother Torrance is probably hungry too but uh why don't why don't we just come in and and come come on over here brother torns and then uh just come let's just shake his hand as we're being dismissed and uh let brother Torrance know how much we appreciate him and you just you just come right on up here love him we we love brother Torrance amen and we thank him for his for his love to this church and uh we appreciate all that he is he has done for us as a congregation praise the Lord are we going to sing oh go ahead [Music] when I kneel down at your feet it's a place of healing it's a place where I find Freedom there's a place my eyes can't see [Music] where my spirit longs to be it's a place of heat
