[37:57] um let's as we're going to look here in
[38:00] the scriptures and um um I want us to
[38:05] turn there there's two places I I'd like

[38:22] And uh we're going to um look into the
[38:29] I want to read a little bit from the
[38:30] church ages tonight.
[38:35] Thank you, Lord Jesus. So, Ephesians 2
[38:38] and 10, for we are his workmanship,
[38:42] created in Christ Jesus
[38:45] unto good works, which God hath before
[38:48] ordained that we should walk in them.
[38:51] also in the book of Ephesians 4 and um
[38:56] the the first verse
[39:03] and it says I therefore the prisoner of
[39:07] the Lord beseech you that you walk
[39:11] worthy of the vocation wherewith you are
[39:15] called. Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[39:19] Father, we want to thank you today,
[39:22] Lord, that you have been so good to us,
[39:26] Lord, bringing Brother Donald through
[39:28] his surgery and and we're just asking,
[39:32] Father, that your Holy Spirit would be
[39:36] with him, Lord, and and heal him and
[39:40] direct him, Father. just ask that you're
[39:44] Lord that you would lift his spirits
[39:47] Father as he is is healing and God you
[39:51] see what this u this throwing up Lord
[39:55] what's causing it and Father we're just
[39:58] asking that you would help him father as
[40:01] as as he is Lord he's has his chest cut
[40:05] open and Lord it just hurts to throw up
[40:09] it hurts to it just hurts to live right
[40:12] now. And I'm just asking, God, that you
[40:15] let your ministering angels be all
[40:18] around him and comfort him and
[40:20] strengthen him and heal him. Father, be
[40:23] with sister Angie there, Lord, and Angie
[40:26] as she's there by his side. And Father,
[40:29] we we thank you for the wonderful event
[40:33] today for the Cochran family.
[40:36] We just ask that you would bless Brother
[40:38] Nathaniel and Sister Katrina, Lord, as
[40:41] they have opened their hearts and home
[40:43] and name unto their boys. And we just
[40:46] ask that you would bless this family in
[40:49] such a wonderful way. May the presence
[40:52] of divine love just overshadow them,
[40:56] Father. Lord, we thank you for your word
[40:59] of promise. And we just ask that you
[41:01] would help us tonight as we as we read
[41:03] the church age book and comment a little
[41:05] bit. Just ask that your presence would
[41:08] be with us in the name of the Lord
[41:10] Jesus. Can the church say amen?
[41:14] And amen. God bless you. You can be
[41:16] seated here tonight.
[41:19] Praise the Lord.
[41:21] We um we're going to u minister on the
[41:27] true witness. And so, um, we're going to
[41:31] start in our reading in in page 331
[41:36] and all the way down to the bottom um
[41:40] there
[41:42] uh
[41:43] where it says salutation
[41:46] and um uh so we will we will read there
[41:52] and I think it's a it's a it's a good
[41:54] thing for us to know uh for us to really
[41:58] recognize and truly understand and again
[42:01] you know what I've said it so many times
[42:03] and is the adoption age is when we when
[42:09] sons of God comes to the full
[42:11] understanding of what God has been
[42:13] doing. And so this this adoption age is
[42:18] a is is an incredible age of grace. It's
[42:23] an incredible age of maturity. It's when
[42:27] son and father can talk and and
[42:30] communicate eye to eye. Amen. They can
[42:33] sit down and have communication with one
[42:36] another. Amen. Now, um the brother
[42:40] Torrance, it's so good to see you
[42:42] tonight. God bless you. We uh
[42:48] we have sure missed you. Amen. And um we
[42:52] we don't you just love Brother Torrance?
[42:55] Uh, brother Torrance is just a a a
[42:58] wonderful man, wonderful man of God. So
[43:00] we say, God bless you. Amen.
[43:03] And um so but but grace it but it's all
[43:07] grace. Um adoption is not is not where
[43:12] you're earning anything. Well, you know,
[43:15] uh where where you're learning to live,
[43:18] right? You have to earn and learn and
[43:20] earn and that's not it. is you're coming
[43:23] to a reality to where you're
[43:26] understanding
[43:28] what what the father has had in his plan
[43:31] all along. Amen. You're coming to grips
[43:34] with things. You're understanding. And
[43:36] even in our personal walks with God, in
[43:39] our in our situations, we understand
[43:41] that everything that is happening in our
[43:44] situations,
[43:45] every circumstance, it's orchestrated by
[43:48] God for us to overcome. Amen. and to
[43:51] rule and reign over and and so that it
[43:54] is an act. We we are acting in faith.
[43:58] We're standing up as sons of God. We're
[44:01] not falling apart. We're not we're not
[44:03] allowing our ourselves to uh waver one
[44:07] way or the other. We're in the last of
[44:09] the last. We're fixing to take over the
[44:11] world. Amen. the the authority has been
[44:14] given to us and God is teaching us
[44:17] through the message how we are to act,
[44:20] how we are to stand and faith. Brother
[44:23] Brandham says faith must be at its
[44:26] highest rapturing faith. He said there
[44:28] there has got to be a greater faith than
[44:31] any other time before walking into this
[44:33] rapture. So this rapture is going to
[44:36] require a matured faith. So when we talk
[44:40] about adoption, when we talk about this
[44:42] message, we're we're we're it's it's
[44:44] it's not just another corner uh to to
[44:47] make a denomination. These are true sons
[44:50] of God with a true father that is
[44:53] instructing them, preparing them. Amen.
[44:56] Uh to walk out and take take authority
[45:00] on this earth. And so that's that's what
[45:03] this is all about. And so we're going to
[45:05] read here tonight, Amen. about the the
[45:07] the final amen and and and that he is
[45:11] the amen and we've got to take that.
[45:14] Well, but my boss, you don't understand.
[45:16] He fired me. It I if a son of God is no
[45:20] longer waffling here and there and just,
[45:22] you know, like a like an eagle
[45:24] fluttering all over the place. We are
[45:26] sons. We are eagles. We are flying. We
[45:30] know that we must fly and we've got to
[45:34] have the winds of adversity that come.
[45:36] Everything that comes against us, there
[45:38] is a greater faith than ever before. And
[45:41] so I want us to walk into this here
[45:43] tonight as we are as as we're reading
[45:46] the church ages. And and I I want you to
[45:48] understand this is Papa trying to let
[45:51] you know in this age who you are. Can
[45:55] you say amen? And so let's let's look
[45:58] here.
[45:59] at the um uh it's in the Leoysian age
[46:04] and it's page 331 down here at the
[46:07] salutation and and it says there in
[46:10] Revelations 3:14
[46:12] these things saith the faith the amen
[46:16] the faithful and true witness the
[46:19] beginning of the creation of God.
[46:23] My isn't that a the most wonderful
[46:26] description of the attributes of our
[46:29] lovely Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[46:32] These words just make me want to shout.
[46:35] Well, how about you tonight? They bring
[46:38] such a spirit of reality into my heart.
[46:42] Just reading them without even waiting
[46:45] for a thorough revelation of the spirit
[46:47] upon them thrills me. Jesus has given us
[46:50] this description of himself in relation
[46:54] to the last age. Now Jesus is giving
[46:57] this description of him. Amen. In
[47:02] relation to the last age. Now he now
[47:06] catch catch this thing as we as we begin
[47:08] to read because there's a whole bunch of
[47:10] it here that's just so powerful. Amen.
[47:13] Now remember the third pull is adoption.
[47:18] We all talk about adoption. Amen. Oh my.
[47:21] Adoption. The day is going to come when
[47:23] we're going to have faith to speak arms
[47:25] into existence, limbs and and and I
[47:27] believe that. I believe that. But it's
[47:29] not a special power. Amen. The special p
[47:33] that is not what we're talking about.
[47:35] It's sons coming to an understanding of
[47:38] who they are and taking God at his word.
[47:42] Amen.
[47:44] It says, "The days of grace are winding
[47:46] up. He has looked from the first century
[47:49] right through to the 20th and told us
[47:52] all things concerning these ages."
[47:55] Before he reveals the characteristics of
[47:57] the last age to us, he gives us one
[48:00] final look at his own gracious and
[48:02] supreme deity. This is the capstone
[48:05] revelation of himself. Thus saith the
[48:09] amen. Jesus is the amen of God. Jesus is
[48:14] is the so let it be of God. Amen stands
[48:18] for finality. It stands for approval. It
[48:22] stands for prevailing promise. It stands
[48:24] for unchanging promise. It stands for
[48:27] the seal of God. I want you to watch
[48:30] this carefully now and see something
[48:32] really sweet and beautiful. I said this.
[48:36] This is the his end time revelation of
[48:38] himself. When the day of grace closes,
[48:41] then the millennium comes very shortly
[48:44] thereafter, doesn't it? Well, read with
[48:46] me Isaiah 65:16-19.
[48:51] That he who blessth himself in the earth
[48:54] shall bless himself in the God of truth.
[48:57] He that swearth in the earth shall swear
[49:00] by the God of truth, because the former
[49:02] troubles are forgotten, and because they
[49:05] are hid from mine eyes. For behold, I
[49:08] create new heavens and a new earth, and
[49:11] the former shall be not shall not be
[49:13] remembered, nor come into mine. But ye
[49:17] be but be ye glad, and rejoice forever
[49:20] in that which I create. For behold, I
[49:23] create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her
[49:26] people a joy. I rejoice in Jerusalem,
[49:30] and joy in my people, and the voice of
[49:33] weeping shall be no more heard in here.
[49:36] for the voice of crying. This is about
[49:39] New Jerusalem. This is the millennium.
[49:42] But as we go into the millennium, hear
[49:44] what he says about a certain kind of
[49:46] God. Verse 16, that he who blessth
[49:50] himself in the earth shall bless himself
[49:53] in the God of truth. Yes, that is true.
[49:57] But the real translation is not the God
[49:59] of truth. It is the God of the Amen. So
[50:03] we read it shall bless himself in the
[50:07] God of the Amen. He that swearth in the
[50:10] earth shall swear by the God of the amen
[50:15] because the former troubles are
[50:16] forgotten because they are hid from mine
[50:19] eyes. For behold, I create new heavens
[50:22] and a new earth. And the former shall
[50:25] not be remembered, nor come into mine.
[50:28] But be ye glad and rejoice forever in
[50:32] that which I create. For behold, I
[50:35] create Jerusalem a rejoicing. Her people
[50:38] a joy, and I will rejoice in Jerusalem,
[50:41] and joy in my people, and the uh voice
[50:44] of weeping shall be no more heard in
[50:47] here, for the voice of crying.
[50:49] Hallelujah. Here is Jehovah of the Old
[50:53] Testament, the God of the Amen. Here is
[50:56] Jesus of the New Testament, the God of
[50:59] the Amen. Here, O Israel, the Lord thy
[51:03] God is one God. There it is again. The
[51:06] Jehovah of the Old Testament is the
[51:09] Jesus of the New. Here, O Israel, the
[51:12] Lord thy God is one God. The New
[51:15] Testament does not reveal another God.
[51:18] It is a further revelation of the one
[51:21] and same God. Christ did not come down
[51:24] to make himself known.
[51:27] He did not come uh to reveal the son. He
[51:32] came to reveal and make known the
[51:34] father. He never talked about two gods.
[51:38] He talked about one God. And now in this
[51:41] last age, we have come back to the
[51:44] capstone revelation. The most important
[51:46] revelation of the Godhead in in the
[51:49] whole Bible
[51:51] that is Jesus is God. He is he and the
[51:55] father are one. There is one God. His
[51:58] name is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the
[52:02] God of the Amen.
[52:04] He never changes. He uh uh what what he
[52:08] does never changes. He says it and it
[52:12] stands fast. He does it and it is done
[52:16] forever. None can take from what he had
[52:20] what he says or add to it. So let it be.
[52:23] Amen. So let it be. Aren't you glad that
[52:27] you serve that kind of a God? You can
[52:30] know exactly where you are with him at
[52:33] any time and all the time. He is the
[52:36] amen god and won't change. Can I hear an
[52:40] amen? Amen. These things saith the amen.
[52:44] I like that. It means that whatever he
[52:48] says is final. It means that whatever he
[52:51] said to the first age, to the second
[52:53] age, and to all ages about his own true
[52:57] church and about the false vine is
[53:00] exactly right, and it won't change. It
[53:03] means that what he started out with in
[53:06] Genesis, he will finish in Revelations.
[53:09] He has to for he is the yay man. So let
[53:13] it be. Now we can see again why the
[53:16] devil hates the book of Genesis and
[53:17] Revelation. He hates the truth. He knows
[53:21] the truth will prevail. He knows what
[53:23] his end will be. How he fights that. But
[53:27] we are on uh but we are on the winning
[53:30] side. We I mean the believers of his
[53:32] word only are on the amen side. These
[53:36] things sayaith the faithful and true
[53:38] witness. Now I want to show you what I
[53:42] find in the thought of faithful. You
[53:45] know we often talk about the great
[53:47] unchanging God whose word does not
[53:49] change. When we speak of him after the
[53:52] manner uh after that matter we often get
[53:55] a view of him that makes him seem
[53:58] impersonal. It is as though God made the
[54:01] whole universe and all the laws.
[54:04] um
[54:06] all the laws that pertain to it and then
[54:08] stood back and become a great and
[54:10] personal God. It is as though God made a
[54:13] way of salvation and lost mankind. That
[54:17] way being the cross. Then when the death
[54:20] of Christ was atone has atoned for our
[54:22] sins, his resurrection gave us an open
[54:26] door to him. God just unfolds his arms
[54:29] and stood back. It is as if we have
[54:32] majored in believing in a great creator
[54:35] who having created lost personal
[54:37] interest in his creation. Now I say that
[54:41] is how too many people are apt to think.
[54:45] But that is wrong thinking for God is
[54:48] governing in the affairs of men right
[54:51] now. He is both creator and sustainer.
[54:55] Colossians 1:16-17.
[54:58] For by him were all things created that
[55:00] are in heaven, that are in earth,
[55:03] visible and invisible, whether they be
[55:06] thrones or dominions or principalities
[55:09] or powers. All things were created by
[55:11] him and for him. For he is before all
[55:13] things, and by him all things consist.
[55:16] He is a sovereign God. By his own
[55:19] counsel, he purposed the plan of
[55:21] salvation of his own elect which he
[55:24] foresaw. The son died upon the cross to
[55:27] establish the means of salvation. And
[55:30] the holy spirit carefully executes the
[55:32] will of the father. He is working all
[55:35] things at this moment according to the
[55:38] purpose of his own will. Can I hear a
[55:41] hallelujah?
[55:43] Amen. He is right in the midst of it
[55:46] all. He is in the midst of his church.
[55:49] This great creator, savior, God is
[55:52] faithfully fulfilling or working amongst
[55:55] his own right now as the great shepherd
[55:58] of the sheep. His very existence is for
[56:01] his own. He loves them and cares for
[56:03] them. His eye is ever upon them. And
[56:07] when the word says that your lives are
[56:09] hid with Christ in God, it means exactly
[56:11] what it says. Oh, I'm so glad that my
[56:14] God abides faithful. He is true to
[56:17] himself. He won't lie. He is true to the
[56:21] word. He will back it up. He is true to
[56:24] us. He will lose none of us, but will
[56:28] raise us up in the last day. I'm glad
[56:31] that I am resting in his faithfulness.
[56:34] Philippians 1 and 6. Being confident of
[56:38] this very thing, that he which hath
[56:41] begun a good work in you will perform it
[56:43] until the day of Jesus Christ. He is the
[56:46] true witness. Now this word true is the
[56:50] same word we saw back in Revelations
[56:52] 3:7. You recall that it does not mean
[56:55] true as in contrast with false. It has a
[56:59] richer, deeper meaning by far. It
[57:02] expresses perfect realization in
[57:05] contrast with partial realizations. But
[57:08] now in the Philadelphiaian uh but back
[57:11] now back in the Philadelphia age, the
[57:14] coming of the Lord was drawing nine.
[57:17] What great love and the age manifested
[57:19] for him. It reminds me of those
[57:22] beautiful words of first Peter 1 and8
[57:25] whom having not seen ye love and whom
[57:28] though now ye see him not yet believing
[57:32] you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[57:34] full of glory. With them we rejoice
[57:37] also. We haven't seen him but we have
[57:40] felt him. We know him now as much as our
[57:45] limiting senses can let us. But one day
[57:49] it will be face to face. That is for
[57:52] this age. This is the coming or this is
[57:56] coming at the end of this age. Partial
[57:58] realization will become perfect
[58:00] realization. Completed realization.
[58:04] Hallelujah.
[58:05] We have been looking through a glass
[58:07] darkly, but soon it will be face to
[58:09] face. We have been going from glory to
[58:12] glory, but soon it will be right in
[58:15] glory. And in his glory will shine. We
[58:19] shall be like him, wondrously like him.
[58:22] Jesus, our savior divine. Isn't that
[58:26] wonderful? We are complete in him. That
[58:29] is true. He would not lie to us about
[58:32] that. One day we will be changed in the
[58:35] atoms. We will put on immortality. We
[58:38] will be all swallowed up in life. Then
[58:43] we will realize realization.
[58:46] He is the faithful and true witness.
[58:49] Now we think of that word witness. Well,
[58:52] that word is is the one that we get the
[58:54] word martyr from. The the Bible speaks
[58:57] of Steven and Annabus and others as
[59:00] martyrs. They were martyrs. They were
[59:03] also witnesses.
[59:05] Jesus was a faithful martyr. The Holy
[59:08] Ghost is the witness to that. The spirit
[59:11] bears record of that. The world hated
[59:14] Jesus. It killed him. But God loved him
[59:18] and he went to the father. The proof
[59:20] that he went to the father is that the
[59:22] holy ghost came. If Jesus had not
[59:25] received of the father, the spirit would
[59:28] not have come. Read it in John 16:7-11.
[59:32] Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It
[59:35] is expedient that for you that I go
[59:38] away. For if I go not away, the
[59:41] comforter will not come unto you. But if
[59:43] I depart, I will send him unto you. And
[59:47] when he has come, he will reprove the
[59:49] world of sin and of righteousness and of
[59:52] judgment. Of sin because they believe
[59:54] not on me. Of righteousness because they
[59:56] go to my father. and ye see me no more
[1:00:00] of judgment because the prince of this
[1:00:02] world is judged. The presence of the
[1:00:05] Holy Spirit in this world instead of
[1:00:08] Jesus being here proves that Jesus was
[1:00:11] righteous and went to the father.
[1:00:14] But it also says in John 14:18,
[1:00:18] I will not leave you comfortless. I will
[1:00:21] come to you. He sent the comforter. He
[1:00:23] was the comforter. He came back in
[1:00:26] spirit upon the true church. He is the
[1:00:29] faithful and true witness in the midst
[1:00:32] of the church. But one day he's going to
[1:00:36] come back in flesh again. And he will
[1:00:39] prove then who is the only wise
[1:00:42] potentate.
[1:00:43] It is he, Jesus Christ, the Lord of
[1:00:46] glory, the faithful and true witness,
[1:00:49] creator and sustainer, perfect
[1:00:51] realization, the amen of God. Isn't that
[1:00:54] just wonderful? It says, "Oh, how I love
[1:00:57] him. Oh, how I adore him, Jesus, the son
[1:01:02] of God." He says, "I want to bring my
[1:01:05] thoughts on this part of the salutation
[1:01:08] with these words of 2 Corinthians 1:18
[1:01:12] to 22. But God, but as God is true, our
[1:01:17] word toward you is true
[1:01:19] or toward you was not yay and nay. For
[1:01:22] the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was
[1:01:24] preached among you, by us, even by me,
[1:01:28] and Sylvanus, and Timoththeus, was not
[1:01:30] yay and nay, but in him was yay. For all
[1:01:35] the promises of God in him are yay, and
[1:01:39] in him a man, unto the glory of God by
[1:01:43] us. Now he which establishth us with you
[1:01:46] in Christ and hath anointed us is God
[1:01:50] who hath also sealed us and given the
[1:01:54] earnest of the spirit in our hearts. The
[1:01:57] beginning of the creation of God. That
[1:01:59] is who the Lord Jesus is. Says he is.
[1:02:03] But those words don't mean exactly as
[1:02:06] they sound to us.
[1:02:08] Just taking them the way they sound has
[1:02:11] made some people, in fact multitudes of
[1:02:13] people, get the idea that Jesus was the
[1:02:16] first creation of God, making him lower
[1:02:18] than the Godhead.
[1:02:20] Then this first creation created all the
[1:02:23] rest of the universe and whosoever it
[1:02:26] contains. But that is not right. You
[1:02:30] know that doesn't line up with the rest
[1:02:31] of the Bible. The words are he is the
[1:02:35] beginner or the author of the creation
[1:02:38] of God. Now we know for assurityity that
[1:02:41] Jesus is God very God. He is the
[1:02:44] creator. John 1:3 all things were made
[1:02:47] by him and without him was not anything
[1:02:50] made that was made. He is the one of
[1:02:53] whom it is said Genesis 1:1 in the
[1:02:56] beginning God created the heaven and
[1:02:58] earth. Also it says in Exodus 20 and 11,
[1:03:03] for in six days the Lord made heaven and
[1:03:06] earth, the sea and all that is in them
[1:03:09] or in them is and rested the seventh
[1:03:11] day. See there is no doubt that he is
[1:03:15] the creator. He was the creator of the
[1:03:18] finished physical creation. Surely we
[1:03:22] can see what these words mean. Now to
[1:03:25] have any other interpretation would mean
[1:03:27] that God created God. How could God be
[1:03:30] created when he himself is the creator?
[1:03:34] Now he is standing in the midst of the
[1:03:36] church. As he stands there revealing who
[1:03:39] he is in this last J this age. He calls
[1:03:43] himself the author of the creation of
[1:03:46] God. This is another creation. This has
[1:03:49] to do with the church. This is a special
[1:03:52] designation of himself. He is the
[1:03:55] creator of that church. The heavenly
[1:03:59] bridegroom created his own bride. Well,
[1:04:02] that makes me want to shout. As the
[1:04:05] spirit of God, he came down, created in
[1:04:09] the virgin Mary the cells which uh from
[1:04:15] which his body was born. I want to
[1:04:17] repeat that he created the very cells in
[1:04:21] the womb of Mary for that body. It was
[1:04:24] not enough for the Holy Spirit to simply
[1:04:26] give life to a human oam supplied by
[1:04:28] Mary.
[1:04:30] That would have been sinful mankind
[1:04:32] producing a body. That would not have
[1:04:35] produced the last Adam. Of him it was
[1:04:38] said, "Lo, a body thou hast uh
[1:04:43] body hast thou father prepared for me."
[1:04:46] God, not Mary, provided that body. Mary
[1:04:50] was the human incubator. She carried
[1:04:54] that holy child and brought him to
[1:04:56] birth. It was a God man. He was the son
[1:05:00] of God. He was of the new creation.
[1:05:03] Man and God met and joined. Oh, this is
[1:05:07] so rich. He was the first of this new
[1:05:11] race. He is the head of this new race.
[1:05:15] Colossians 1:18, he is the head of the
[1:05:18] church, the body, who is the beginning,
[1:05:21] the firstborn from the dead, that in all
[1:05:24] things he might have preeminence. 2
[1:05:27] Corinthians 5:17, therefore, if any man
[1:05:30] be in Christ, he is a new creation.
[1:05:34] Old things have passed away, behold, all
[1:05:36] things are become new. There you can see
[1:05:39] that though man was of the old order or
[1:05:42] creation, now in union with Christ, he
[1:05:45] has become the new creation of God.
[1:05:48] Ephesians 2:10, for we are his
[1:05:50] workmanship, created in union with
[1:05:53] Christ Jesus under good works. Ephesians
[1:05:56] 4:24, that you put on the new man, which
[1:06:00] after God is created in righteousness
[1:06:02] and true holiness.
[1:06:04] This new creation is not the old
[1:06:06] creation made over. It could not be
[1:06:09] called a new creation. This is exactly
[1:06:12] what it says. It is new creation. It is
[1:06:17] another creation distinct from the old
[1:06:20] one. No longer is he dealing by ways of
[1:06:23] the flesh. That was how he dealt with
[1:06:26] Israel. He chose Abraham and Abraham's
[1:06:29] issue uh through the godly seed line.
[1:06:34] Now uh but now of every kindred, tribe,
[1:06:38] and nation, he has purposed a new
[1:06:41] creation. For he is the first of that
[1:06:44] creation. He was God created in the form
[1:06:48] of man. Now by his spirit he is creating
[1:06:52] many sons unto himself. Now listen to
[1:06:54] that. He was God created in the form of
[1:06:57] man. And now by his spirit he is
[1:07:00] creating many sons unto himself. God the
[1:07:03] creator creating himself a part of
[1:07:06] creation. That is the true revelation of
[1:07:09] God. That was his purpose. This purpose
[1:07:12] took form through election. That is why
[1:07:15] he could look right down to the last age
[1:07:18] when all would be over and see himself
[1:07:21] still in the midst of the church as
[1:07:24] author of this new creation of God. His
[1:07:27] sovereign power brought to pass. Isn't
[1:07:30] that beautiful?
[1:07:32] Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God. See,
[1:07:35] you you understand? Do do see adoption
[1:07:38] is not it's not a it it's it's it's not
[1:07:41] a bad word. Sometimes it can be taboo uh
[1:07:43] in messes circles because we've got so
[1:07:46] many people that have claimed like the
[1:07:47] Thunder Movement uh you know claiming
[1:07:50] they they've got they've got this and
[1:07:51] they try to put adoption over here and
[1:07:53] they've got they've got this trying to
[1:07:55] put adoption over here and and in all
[1:07:58] reality adoption was was was God was
[1:08:03] brother Brandham telling the
[1:08:04] Pentecostals, hey listen, you guys are
[1:08:07] speaking in tongues, running the aisles
[1:08:09] and prophesying and seeking after
[1:08:11] vision. isions. That's all good, but
[1:08:13] that's not God's purpose. That's not
[1:08:16] God's purpose. You need to be adopted.
[1:08:19] You need to be placed. We're not going
[1:08:21] by of the roller coasters of of of of I
[1:08:24] need a word from the Lord or I need a
[1:08:26] prophecy or I seen a vision or I seen
[1:08:28] that. Listen, you need to come to the
[1:08:31] reality that you are sons of God.
[1:08:34] Whether you feel it or whether you
[1:08:36] don't, whether you're in the valley or
[1:08:38] on the mountain, it does not matter.
[1:08:42] Adoption is son's understanding that
[1:08:46] they are the very creation of God.
[1:08:50] Amen.
[1:08:52] It's not God way off. You are the
[1:08:56] creation of God in physical form. Can
[1:08:59] you say amen? He says, "By his own
[1:09:01] decree, he elected the members of this
[1:09:04] new creation. He predestinated them to
[1:09:07] be the adoption of children according to
[1:09:10] his good pleasure. By his omniscience
[1:09:13] and omnipotence, he brought it to pass."
[1:09:16] How else could he know that he would be
[1:09:19] standing in the midst of the church
[1:09:21] receiving glory from his brethren if he
[1:09:24] did not make sure? All things he knew
[1:09:28] and all things he worked out according
[1:09:30] to what he knew in order that his
[1:09:33] purpose and good pleasure be brought to
[1:09:36] pass. That's a mouthful, but I can say
[1:09:38] amen.
[1:09:39] Ephesians 1:11, whom uh in whom also we
[1:09:44] have obtained an inheritance, being
[1:09:46] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:09:49] of him who workketh all things after the
[1:09:52] counsel of his own will. And then he
[1:09:55] asked this question. This going to be
[1:09:57] the last that we read of the church
[1:09:58] tonight church book. Hallelujah. Aren't
[1:10:01] you glad that you belong to him?
[1:10:07] Amen.
[1:10:09] Now, next week we're going to start
[1:10:10] going he's going to go back through the
[1:10:12] the lukewarm leodysian age. He's wanting
[1:10:15] before he gets here, he's wanting to
[1:10:18] make sure to the elect that the spirit,
[1:10:21] he that hath an ear to hear, let him
[1:10:25] hear what the spirit says. Only the true
[1:10:28] creation of God can hear what the spirit
[1:10:31] says. Because only the true creation of
[1:10:35] God was created with those kind of ears,
[1:10:37] too. here. God's not wanting us to come
[1:10:39] and just sit here in in the church and
[1:10:43] and uh and hear, you know, uh a good
[1:10:48] good words and and uh uh and good things
[1:10:52] because though it can sound good here in
[1:10:55] our minds, if it's not revelation here,
[1:10:59] how many how many's known people that
[1:11:01] that that go that that that are up on
[1:11:03] the mountaintop and and and it is just
[1:11:05] so wonderful and they're flying high And
[1:11:07] it's just so but then they go back down
[1:11:09] in the valley within three or four weeks
[1:11:11] and then they go in that valley and it
[1:11:13] it's just gloomy. It's just oh their
[1:11:15] life is miserable and gloomy for about 3
[1:11:18] months and then all of a sudden they're
[1:11:20] coming back up and then and it and it's
[1:11:22] shortlived. And that's what we've been
[1:11:23] talking about. Amen. About that about
[1:11:26] the three rooms. There's the body, the
[1:11:28] spirit and the soul. That that that that
[1:11:30] body is subject to the circumstances
[1:11:33] around us. The spirit is connected with
[1:11:36] that body. Amen. It took bodies. It took
[1:11:40] priests uh uh human beings to come in
[1:11:43] and light the fire. It took priests to
[1:11:45] come in and keep the oil in. It took
[1:11:48] priests and and and it and and they had
[1:11:50] in that in that spirit realm in that uh
[1:11:54] that second compartment, they had to
[1:11:56] constantly bring in new shoeb bread.
[1:11:58] They had to do it every Sabbath. They
[1:12:00] had to come in and bring in new. It was
[1:12:03] it was constantly it was constantly. So
[1:12:05] the spirit and the body are all
[1:12:07] connected together. There's no
[1:12:09] revelation in here. There's no
[1:12:12] revelation in your spirit. There's no
[1:12:14] there's there's intellect and and
[1:12:16] there's good ears and intellect and
[1:12:19] putting the one and one equals two. And
[1:12:21] we say, "Yes, yes, I'm a son of God.
[1:12:24] Yes, I can do this. Yes, yes, I can do
[1:12:27] this." But then after 3 or 4 weeks,
[1:12:30] we're back down again and we're
[1:12:32] discouraged again and we're downhearted
[1:12:35] again. But God is wanting to take us
[1:12:38] into that that inner court where brother
[1:12:41] Bradom says it's just you and God. It's
[1:12:45] your soul hearing the voice of God and
[1:12:48] there's nobody. It's soundproof then.
[1:12:51] Soundproof. You're not hearing anybody
[1:12:54] outside. You're not It's the the the
[1:12:56] storms. Hallelujah. Amen. Uh uh you know
[1:13:00] how many heard the sirens around Pawne
[1:13:01] last night? I I I usually don't hear
[1:13:03] those things, but I heard those things.
[1:13:05] Amen. And uh and and I hear we can thank
[1:13:08] brother Donald about that. Hallelujah.
[1:13:10] He he went down and said, "Those sirens
[1:13:12] have not been going off." And so they
[1:13:14] said, "We'll check into it." So uh man,
[1:13:17] we got sirens waking us up now. And but
[1:13:21] u thank God for the sirens. But but but
[1:13:24] when you're in that inner veil,
[1:13:27] you're not worried about the storms
[1:13:30] because you don't know the storms. There
[1:13:33] is a personal revelation.
[1:13:36] Now, now guys, God lives in your three
[1:13:41] room house.
[1:13:44] God, the creator has created that soul.
[1:13:48] He said, "This has nothing to do with
[1:13:51] the original, with the body and the
[1:13:53] spirit. It has nothing to do with that.
[1:13:56] It's not who you are. It's not what you
[1:13:59] are." Amen. He says, "It's not a it's
[1:14:02] not taking your body and making a new a
[1:14:04] a new way over. It is that Holy Spirit
[1:14:08] that has done something to your soul."
[1:14:13] Soul is where the revelation is. Can you
[1:14:15] say amen? So, so as as we look there as
[1:14:20] as we have as as my my scriptures that I
[1:14:24] read, we are his workmanship
[1:14:27] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:14:30] which Godath be for ordained that we
[1:14:32] should walk in them. And then that next
[1:14:34] scripture was I the prisoner of the Lord
[1:14:38] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[1:14:41] vocation wherewith you are called. So
[1:14:44] now there's a requirement of every one
[1:14:46] of us uh uh today to make sure Lord let
[1:14:51] me go into that bedroom. Let me go into
[1:14:54] that room where it's me and you. Let
[1:14:57] your word take root in my spiritual womb
[1:15:01] into my soul. Let that soul amen
[1:15:05] germinate the seed of Christ within me.
[1:15:09] Can you say amen? That's what we want.
[1:15:12] Amen. The character of faith lies in
[1:15:16] that one who has ordained us for before
[1:15:18] the foundation of the word. The very law
[1:15:21] of God. The very first law of God was
[1:15:24] faith. In the beginning was the word.
[1:15:27] The word was with God. The word was God.
[1:15:31] And then the word spoke. What caused the
[1:15:33] word to speak is because there was an
[1:15:36] inner knowing. There was an absolute
[1:15:39] assurance he had already seen it. And
[1:15:41] when you've got that God living in you,
[1:15:43] it produces a knowing. Brother Brandham
[1:15:46] says there's just a knowing deep in your
[1:15:49] heart, you have that revelation. Can you
[1:15:52] say amen? Amen. How many wants to walk
[1:15:54] worthy of that vocation? Amen. Walk
[1:15:58] worthy of God's grace. Walk worthy of
[1:16:02] his of of his dealings with you. So, if
[1:16:06] he's designed you, and I'm not going to
[1:16:08] add too much more to what we've got here
[1:16:10] tonight because I I do believe that uh I
[1:16:14] I want I want this I want this these
[1:16:16] words that we read tonight to really
[1:16:18] germinate. Let it germinate in you.
[1:16:20] Don't don't
[1:16:22] go back and and forget what I've what
[1:16:24] we've read tonight. Amen. This is
[1:16:26] important. This is who you are. Can I
[1:16:30] hear a great big amen? Amen.
[1:16:33] Now if God's created the bedding grounds
[1:16:35] in you and he's designed you amen for
[1:16:38] this specific purpose and remember
[1:16:41] remember Ezekiel 17 and8 it says it was
[1:16:45] planted in a good soil by great waters
[1:16:49] that it bring forth branches that it
[1:16:52] might bear fruit that it might be a
[1:16:55] goodly vine. And that's what God has
[1:16:58] planted here right here in the earth
[1:17:00] right here. and he's fixing to take the
[1:17:03] fruit off that vine. Well, glory to God.
[1:17:06] He's planted you in the word, planted
[1:17:09] you in life. His blessings are here upon
[1:17:12] you to thrive and to grow. Amen. So
[1:17:16] while we see scriptures being fulfilled
[1:17:18] and the musicians could come while we
[1:17:20] see scripture being fulfilled there in
[1:17:23] Israel
[1:17:26] and and
[1:17:29] we know we we we we know that Israel is
[1:17:32] going to have a tough time. Israel's got
[1:17:34] a tough time of coming. The world will
[1:17:36] end up turning on Israel. And and we we
[1:17:39] know that that's part of prophecy. We
[1:17:42] know that God's going to be with Israel.
[1:17:45] Amen. We know we we know that the man of
[1:17:47] sin is going to step in, is going to
[1:17:49] make a covenant with the Jews. He's
[1:17:51] going he's going to come in and somehow
[1:17:53] or another help bring in bring a peace
[1:17:56] uh in the world, but it's not going to
[1:17:58] last very long. And and so um we know
[1:18:03] that that a lot of this is all coming
[1:18:06] together and we know that the one who's
[1:18:09] making the peace, the one that is
[1:18:11] anointing him, brother Brandham says, is
[1:18:13] the God of force. And so he's coming in
[1:18:16] with flatteries and he's coming in with
[1:18:18] all kinds of things. And u and some
[1:18:22] people say, "Well, that was uh man,
[1:18:25] that's that's that's Donald Trump."
[1:18:27] Well, you know, I'm I'm glad again I'm
[1:18:30] glad that God's given us a prophet so
[1:18:32] that we're not going to get mixed up and
[1:18:33] all that kind of stuff. We do know that
[1:18:35] Donald Trump has a whole bunch to do
[1:18:37] with it because remember the two beasts
[1:18:39] in Revelations uh 13, it's going to be
[1:18:42] the USA and Rome that's going to bring
[1:18:45] this thing together. And and so what a
[1:18:48] day we're living in. Can you say amen?
[1:18:51] What a day we're living in. It's a
[1:18:54] glorious day.
[1:18:57] Amen. So many people are saying the
[1:18:59] Antichrist is going to be Muslim.
[1:19:02] I'm just glad that we have the
[1:19:04] revelation that God's given us. Right.
[1:19:07] Amen. Most most all of them today are
[1:19:10] saying it's Muslim, that it's going to
[1:19:12] be a Muslim Superman that's going to try
[1:19:14] to bring the peace.
[1:19:16] And the man of sin is sitting over
[1:19:18] there. Amen. that old fella that weird
[1:19:21] wears those weird looking clothes with a
[1:19:23] cross. Amen. He's He's the man of sin.
[1:19:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:29] But the God
[1:19:32] God is not a god of force. And brother
[1:19:34] Brandham says that the man of sin or the
[1:19:38] the the antichrist
[1:19:41] will will will
[1:19:44] become incarnate of the devil. So the
[1:19:46] devil will totally incarnate him. He'll
[1:19:48] become the beast. He will become a a man
[1:19:52] that is literally
[1:19:55] a a beastly nature.
[1:19:57] He will be anointed
[1:20:00] because he serves the God of force.
[1:20:04] But he says God is not a god of force.
[1:20:06] He's a gentleman.
[1:20:08] He wants us to follow him
[1:20:13] because we love him.
[1:20:16] And we're beyond the time where God is I
[1:20:20] believe I I I I I believe that as in in
[1:20:24] this age of maturity,
[1:20:27] God is not just
[1:20:35] correcting his his people all the time
[1:20:38] with I, you know, I told you not to and
[1:20:42] spanky here and spanky and spatany here.
[1:20:44] He's want you to be sons. He wants you
[1:20:47] to take his word. He wants me to take
[1:20:50] his word. He wants us
[1:20:52] He wants us to enter into this
[1:20:54] relationship with him
[1:20:58] that we know sin is going to kill us.
[1:21:03] That we know and we can discern the
[1:21:06] spirits of this age. God's not wanting
[1:21:08] to beat us over the head. God is not a
[1:21:10] God of force. God is wanting his sons,
[1:21:14] his creation,
[1:21:17] his lineage
[1:21:19] to understand things the way he
[1:21:21] understands things.
[1:21:25] It's quite a it's quite an incredible
[1:21:27] time. Lord, I think I think being
[1:21:30] pliable is so important. God, let me be
[1:21:33] pliable.
[1:21:36] Anything that comes my way,
[1:21:39] you're allowing it.
[1:21:42] You're wanting me to You're want me to
[1:21:44] walk with you.
[1:21:47] You've called me for a specific purpose.
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:53] You've made the covenant with man
[1:21:56] to rule and reign in authority.
[1:22:03] Lord, I I can feel the mantle upon my
[1:22:06] shoulders.
[1:22:10] Don't let me walk in unbelief.
[1:22:13] Don't let me walk with question marks.
[1:22:17] Father, reveal yourself to me. Please
[1:22:20] reveal yourself to me. I'm sitting here.
[1:22:26] I I I I I'm sitting here. I I I want I
[1:22:31] want me and you.
[1:22:35] Everything else is out of the picture.
[1:22:38] I want your grace to be upon me and not
[1:22:41] I don't want it to be in vain. I I'm
[1:22:45] everything that you planned for the age.
[1:22:46] I I'm I'm here.
[1:22:50] I think we should take our singing
[1:22:52] seriously. I think we should take our
[1:22:54] preaching gifts seriously. I think we
[1:22:57] should take our parenting seriously. I
[1:23:00] think everything about us should really
[1:23:02] should really be serious. Lord, here I
[1:23:05] am. Here I am.
[1:23:10] Here I am.
[1:23:13] You're no longer speaking in riddles.
[1:23:15] You're no longer speaking in symbols.
[1:23:18] You're speaking lip to ear.
[1:23:20] Help me, Lord. Has that been your heart
[1:23:23] here tonight? Help me, Jesus.
[1:23:27] There's never
[1:23:30] been a light
[1:23:34] to shine
[1:23:36] so bright
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:43] this glor
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:23:51] Oh, there's never
[1:23:55] been a day.
[1:24:03] Oh, God.
[1:24:05] There's never
[1:24:08] been a day
[1:24:12] like this day.
[1:24:14] I see
[1:24:18] there's never
[1:24:22] never been a light to shine.
[1:24:29] Oh,
[1:24:31] yesterday.
[1:24:38] I know I've said it a lot
[1:24:41] these last couple weeks.
[1:24:43] [Music]
[1:24:47] But oh, keeping our spirits,
[1:24:51] man. Satan is going to do what he can to
[1:24:53] r you up, friends.
[1:24:58] If there's ever a time to learn to keep
[1:24:59] our spirits,
[1:25:02] control our spirits,
[1:25:05] control our imaginations, control these
[1:25:08] things.
[1:25:11] It it'll take the life of God right out
[1:25:13] of you. It'll take it'll take it'll
[1:25:16] it'll it'll it'll detour you from your
[1:25:18] purpose. God wants us to rule and reign.
[1:25:22] Not our mind ruling and reigning over
[1:25:24] us, not our spirits having that we the
[1:25:29] the authority is in that soul. That's
[1:25:31] the new creation.
[1:25:33] So keeping keeping our spirits calm is
[1:25:36] so important. You know what I mean? And
[1:25:40] you say, "Brother Windle, that there
[1:25:41] there's where I'm at." You're his
[1:25:43] creation. You're his creation. Go into
[1:25:46] that bedroom. Go into that third
[1:25:48] compartment. Go into that most holy
[1:25:50] place and let it fall.
[1:25:53] I get flustered in my flesh. I get
[1:25:55] flustered in my mind. But I don't live
[1:25:57] there. I've got to come back to this
[1:26:01] other area. That's the real me.
[1:26:04] That's who I am. Amen. Lord, help me.
[1:26:08] How can I rule and reign if I'm
[1:26:11] flustered all of the time?
[1:26:14] How can I have peace if I'm just if
[1:26:17] everything around me that I'm looking at
[1:26:18] or hearing
[1:26:20] No, that's not what God's called us. We
[1:26:23] live here.
[1:26:26] But that's not to dictate us. Amen.
[1:26:29] Let's walk with him.
[1:26:32] I know in our bodies we get sick. I know
[1:26:34] in our minds we get weary.
[1:26:38] But that doesn't change who you are.
[1:26:41] Amen. The miracle happens
[1:26:45] in that third compartment.
[1:26:48] There's where the miracles are. So let's
[1:26:51] let's go in that place and live. Amen.
[1:26:55] So bright
[1:26:59] as he
[1:27:02] this glory.
[1:27:06] One more time.
[1:27:09] Oh, and there's never
[1:27:14] been a day
[1:27:17] like this day
[1:27:20] to me.
[1:27:23] There's never
[1:27:26] been a day
[1:27:30] like this day.
[1:27:32] I see.
[1:27:36] There's never He's coming.
[1:27:40] He's coming.
[1:27:42] Oh, he's coming. He will keep his word.
[1:27:47] He's the final amen. He'll be the final
[1:27:50] amen to your faith.
[1:27:52] He'll be the final amen.
[1:27:54] Oh, bless the Lord. We got to do it
[1:27:57] again. Oh,
[1:28:00] there's never
[1:28:03] been a day
[1:28:07] like this day
[1:28:10] to me.
[1:28:13] There's never
[1:28:16] been a day
[1:28:19] like this day.
[1:28:22] I see.
[1:28:25] There's never
[1:28:28] Never
[1:28:30] been a light that shines
[1:28:34] so bright.
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:46] Maybe we can talk to father now.
[1:28:50] We thank you for the light
[1:28:54] that is shining in our path.
[1:28:58] We thank you for removing the scales
[1:29:00] from our eyes,
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:04] taking the cataracts off so that we can
[1:29:06] see you for who you are.
[1:29:12] Oh, Father,
[1:29:15] we want to catch the revelation.
[1:29:19] We we want we want you to talk to us.
[1:29:26] And as
[1:29:27] the man said when you were here on earth
[1:29:30] the first time,
[1:29:33] I believe, but help thou mine unbelief.
[1:29:39] Lord, your prophet preached the message
[1:29:42] that God's word requires a total
[1:29:44] separation from unbelief.
[1:29:48] [Music]
[1:29:50] And we're standing up today and saying
[1:29:52] yes, it must be.
[1:29:57] If it's true to you, it's true to us.
[1:30:02] Lord, eradicate unbelief from our minds
[1:30:05] and hearts.
[1:30:07] I ask God that your Holy Spirit
[1:30:12] would so scrub our conscience,
[1:30:17] scrub our bodies, scrub our spirits, our
[1:30:20] minds, everything about the spirit man.
[1:30:25] Let us be pure, undefiled before you.
[1:30:30] For Lord,
[1:30:33] we want a heart that believes every
[1:30:36] word. And we don't want to just believe
[1:30:38] it according to the way we think it
[1:30:40] should be. We want to see your word the
[1:30:43] way you wrote it for the intended
[1:30:46] purpose that you put it there.
[1:30:49] Our womb is open.
[1:30:52] Our heart are open to you.
[1:30:55] We're saying, Lord, be it unto me
[1:30:58] according to thy word.

[1:31:04] Oh, we thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:31:08] Lord, take our spirits and control it.
[1:31:13] We thank you for it. Now, Lord, be with
[1:31:17] all of those who have been fighting
[1:31:18] sickness. We believe your word.

[1:31:42] but the things that are unseen.

[1:31:48] brother Torrance. Father,
