and we're going to read at the 9th verse amen uh we're we're in um the saman church age now and um so we're going to uh do a little bit of reading uh there praise the Lord amen there in in Revelations 2 and9 I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich I know the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan now it doesn't say are of the synagogue of Satan they are the Temple of the devil and so let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you for your blessings first of all we want to thank you for salvation and what it means to be here in the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night with anticipation of hearing from you Lord we love you with all of our heart and we're thankful for the call of God and the gift of God Upon Our Lives and Lord we thank you for brother William and sister Sharon Lord and and brother Kobe and Sister Mary and these wonderful pillars in our church and and what it means Lord to Lord to have men and women that love you and that have put you at the at the Forefront of their marriage and I I pray Lord that you will bless each of these couples and Lord I pray that you'll give them Lord just uh many many more years together and happiness and health and Lord I I I pray Lord that Lord that they would be able to that you would keep them in your Vineyard and working for you Lord as long as as time shall be father we thank you for it now Lord I'm just asking that your your spirit would be here with us tonight that you would help us Lord as as we are Lord reading the church age book and just asking that you would be pleased with every comment that you would be pleased with the reading Lord we ask father that this not just be a another service but we want you to be here Lord and I'm asking that you will speak to us Lord More Than Just Words here but Lord let the spirit be with each one and interpret your word to our hearts and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated praise the Lord amen so we uh we want to turn uh in our books here tonight to uh we're going to start on page 119 and um uh we're going to start down here at the last paragraph now we um we're going to deal with tonight we're um we're going to examine the two spirits and the two churches and that's uh that's this is going to be all throughout the Book of Revelation so there's two Spirits there's the spirit of Christ and then there is the spirit of the Antichrist there is the true church and then there is the false church amen and so uh and and and I want to say that the Book of Revelation is was clearly written for the elect amen it's clearly written for the elect it's it's only for the elect amen now now this is I want you to understand that because only in this last day can the can can the church say that we have have the correct understanding of the symbols of the Book of Revelation now that that's major that's major but but but this only in the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen will the mysteries of of of uh as as as proclaimed by the prophets be finished so the mystery is has has been complete in this day now if you are not going through that seventh Angels message now you say well you're just putting it on on one man well I I I am but I'm only I'm only repeating what God says in the day put it up there uh Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophets so so I'm just simply amen uh echoing what God's already said that's right amen now the scripture says that uh behold I send Elijah the prophet before that great and terrible day of the Lord and He singular he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers this is just before the coming of the Lord so so we we we've got to understand amen that that there are many interpretations and many Revelations out there and eschatology and the Book of Revelation and all of this is I mean this is the number one topic everyone's talking about it amen uh and and and and a lot of those guys I I I seen a little clip today um where where John heggy has has um uh he he he was he was proclaiming you know uh my phone uh knows what I what I do and so it's always sending me to preachers and so uh uh and and so it you know it had a little little clip of him uh answering questions about the solar eclipse and things and and he said that he sold 1 million copies of his book of the four blood moons and so he's he's done really well with W with that and the thing is amen hallelujah it's not even concerned by God yeah it was never even brought up by the seventh angel messenger it was never well praise the Lord so so we've got a million copies that have been sold and these guys are going to the Book of Revelations and they're claiming they've got the Revelation and yet only the El fact who has heard the voice of God have the true Revelation you say boy if that ain't an a cult that then if that if if this is an Ault then the Bible's Ault the Bible said that he's going to send a prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord and he came and I say thank you Jesus can you say amen amen now now I want you to understand that the Mysteries they were written in a mystery but those Mysteries had to be expressed there there're in Mark 4 and10 uh let's just read that and I and and actually why don't you all all of you kids and you young people turn there this is something that that you should know be able to quote this because um this is this should be a part of your belief system amen that Mark Mark four Mark 4 and10 this is something that really that that that that that uh catalyzed my Revelation and my stand on what I believe today um this this revelation of this scripture and when he was alone they that were about him with the 12 asked him of the parable and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in Parable that see they may see and not perceive hearing they hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them now did they understand the parable no that's the reason they're asking they're asking we don't understand what this Parable is and then the next verse the next verse then Jesus says Amen on the next verse and he said unto them know ye not this Parable how then will ye know all Parables and then he begins to go in through so you've got to have not just a Bible but you've got to have the spirit of Revelation to reveal to you what the what the scripture is saying can you say Amen so as as we as we look through this and we see this then it's going to take a spiritual mind it's going to take a spiritual man and woman to do this or you're not going to be able to understand amen so as as we examine these things remember the original setting that we that we went through at the last at the end of the the last chapter amen we found that there were two trees there was the tree of life and then there was the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil excuse me there were two sons that were birthed to one woman everyone say two sons birthed to one woman hallelujah amen one was the seed of the devil one of them was the seed of God so so one woman two children one one Church two Spirits all right both of them claiming both of them come out of the same Bible every everything else so as there were two sons that were birthed to Eve a and one was the son of of of the spiritual which was Adam who was the son of God and the other was the son of the evil the serpent the Incarnate devil amen and then we find that there were two worshippers in the garden amen there was Cain the son of the wicked one and then there was Abel the son of the righteous one they were worshippers but the scripture says one worshiped by revelation of God and knowing that hey there was something more than than an apple or an apricot there was a blood sin that took place and there must be blood amen a blood covering to cover that sin now the other one was by the the carnal perception of the Earth can amen he he he thought it was an apple or something of that nature that caused the death to come therefore he offered the fruit of the trees so the natural mind cannot understand the spiritual mind and as we're going into this remember even for you and me we're not coming in here just to read the book and and say that we understand there there's a lot of people that have read this book and it's not really changed their life but this book will change your life if it is divine revelation it's got to be divine revelation can you say Amen so so we we must we must look at these things it must be by the same inspiration that the prophets gave it is the same inspiration that came amen uh uh to the messenger of this day and it's the same spirit that must Inspire our hearts to catch it exactly like God gave it in the very beginning amen so to be cardinally minded M materialistically minded is death but to be spiritually minded is something that is greater can you say Amen materialistic minded Earthly minded amen uh there's no way to really understand the book there's a lot of Concepts there's a lot of these things it's just simply impossible it's utterly foolish to the individual but the spiritually minded the revelated uh is eternal life and that's where the spirit of God is now brother brandham would say and and and I want to just lay this Foundation before we get into the reading here and and I will restore he says but God through election that shakes you down a little bit because I'm speaking to a a half half a group of Armenians here amen he says but he says but look it was through election that God called Abel and had recompense to his reward amen he said Abel come not nothing beautiful he had he had a little old lamb out of the flock he didn't work it up he he did he didn't do something or another he didn't try to make big fine churches he didn't build this that or the other he just went out there wrapped grape vine around the Lamb's neck and and come pulling it I guess they didn't have any hemp in the day rope they so they they just come with a with a grape vine pulling an old lamb a little old lamb what a sight picked him up laid him on the Rock I I don't guess they had a lance him that day so they took a sharp rock and and pulled his head little head back and begin to beat him in the throat with it what a sight blood begin to sprinkle and bathe his little wool over like that and and the poor little old thing dying bleeding God looked down from heaven and rewarded him what was it spiritually minded by election spiritually minded by election oh if you're not elected to it can you say Amen Esau could not there was then there then there was the two twins that came down there was Esau and Jacob both uh had the same parents both had the same parents but one had Revelation the other was carnally minded God loved Jacob and God hated Esau Esau despised the birthright and Jacob all he could give in his mind was that Birthright that's all Jacob wanted was that Birthright he was he and and and even before he was converted he was trying his very best to get that Birthright going to try everything that he could can you say amen and so but but but the but but but Esau despised the birthright amen then brother Brandon would say so does his children today why do I have to do that for wh why why should I receive the Holy Ghost my religion is just as good as yours why should I go through all of that there you know why why should I chry at an altar why why should I steal away in a closet and and and just me and God and and and sincerely begging God for the Holy Ghost amen why fast and and pray until I know that I know that I know that I've got the birthright that I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Esau seen no benefit in in in receiving it but Jacob on on the other hand spent his life looking and seeking the the presence of God can you say amen and I want to say only the elect are spiritually minded only the elect is asking God I want this more than I want a new car I want this more than I want a job I want the baptism of the Holy Ghost so rich in my life so that I can be spiritually minded amen can you say amen hallelujah so so we're we're we're thanking the lord for that now one one last point that I want to make Amen brother brandham would say and he's talking about the nine spiritual gifts and and he's going to tell us which gift that he thinks is the greatest he says now watch he is speaking in the last days directly to his body here is to the one that has wisdom oh I like this oh my here is one that'll shock you listen to this all right here here is the mind that has witness here's the mind that has wisdom if those Holy Ghost gifts didn't come down to all the age why did he speak this for the last days then if there's going to be no gifts in the church in the last days why did he direct this to the last days here's to the one that has wisdom another place he says the Pentecostal Church today comparing the two and what's happened if you'll notice the routine of the gifts the first is a gift of wisdom that is the best gift of the group if we don't have wisdom then we won't know how to use knowledge which is the second gift if we can't use the second gift without wisdom how are we going to use the last gift interpretation or to the uh next to the last the speaking in tongues you see our Z has ate up our wisdom our Zeal for denominations our enthusiasm has Aid up the wisdom off the vine can you say Amen so so the greatest desire that we could ever have and brother Bram says of all the nine spiritual gifts the greatest thing we could ever ask God is for Wisdom spiritual understanding let me know what you're doing and I just want to say amen that's why we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just coming and and making a decision and not just to saying okay I felt good so I've got the holy ghost or I believe and I've got the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost is the very thing that opens your eyes to see you're you're no longer judging things by the natural anymore you're no longer seeing things for just you and your family or you and your your husband or you and your uh uh uh your friends or or or or whatever you you have got a totally different set of of of of rules you totally different set of eyes you're looking at things totally different than what the normal man or woman here on this Earth does you are seeing everything Through The Eyes Of God well that's a great gift brother I I I believe we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen now if uh uh uh you know one other thing we read this let's turn to the page 30 keep your page that we're fixing to start on but turn turn to page 30 just real quick I just reminded of this amen page 30 all the way down to the very last paragraph if Revelation is beyond you look up and seek God for it that is the only way you are ever going to get it Revelation has to come from God it never comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual endo you can even memorize the scripture and though that is wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from God it says in the word that no man can say that Jesus is Christ except by the Holy Ghost you have to receive the Holy Ghost and then and only then can the spirit give you the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ God be anointed no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals the we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we've accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened amen so let's go here to page9 so we want the words to be quickened amen amen all right um 119 and um and he's he's uh dealing with u uh we're going to all the way down to the very last paragraph Revelations 29b I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are of the synagogue of Satan uh they are the synagogue of Satan here here is a verse that will bear considerable thought not only because it is most peculiar in its contents but but also it is virtually repeated in an age that is over a thousand years later Revelations 2:9 I Know Thy works and thy tribulation and thy poverty but Thou Art rich I know the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan to to begin with the word Jews does not describe the religion of the Jewish people it refers only to the people of Judah and has the same precise meaning as if I were to say I was Irish born these people were saying that they were actually Jews real Jews by birth they were Liars they were not Jews by birth and they weren't Jews by religion if all this is true what were they they were a deceived people who were already part of the church they belonged to the false Vine now now as we you remember when when we first started I I I was told you there's going to be the two Vines amen that false Vine and it's all within the framework of the Christian church one church one woman two children one woman two children are you understanding so within the framework of the Christian Church there's already this false Vine now it says now they were not of the true church but of of the false church because God said they were the synagogue of Satan now the word for synagogue is not the same word we use for church in the Bible Church means the called out ones or the summoned ones the psalmist said about these elect people blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causest to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts Psalm 65 and4 but the meaning of synagogue is assembly or gathering this can be good or bad but in this case it is bad for these are they who whose assembling is not of God but of their own selves Isaiah said unto them they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever Shall Gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake uh Isaiah 54 and5 since the were uh surely against the True Vine God will one day deal with them in destruction now why do we have a people mixed within the framework of the church and calling themselves Jews the reason is this since they were Liars they could make any claim they wished they could say what they wanted as though it were a fact and then stick to it in this case they could be lying with a very powerful thought in mind was it not so that the Earthly church or the early church was almost if not entirely composed of Jews making them the original members of his body the TW apostles were Jews the later apostles were either Jews or prelit thus for men to swear they were Jews would give them preeminence and a claim to originality tell stick to it never mind Factor history just say it and keep saying it to the people and soon the people will receive it wow wow wow h h h how how how is it that we have got all of this religion we have got Christianity today and it don't even you don't even it don't look nothing like the Bible yeah somebody has said it and said it and said it and said it until people believe it and they can read it right in the Bible and think well they've got a better understanding about it than I do I apparently I don't know what I'm I'm just I'm following what they're saying no whatever it says is is what it is and those teachers are wrong wow wow wow wow this this going to come up but there there Ju Just real quick sister Keys If You' put Revelation 17 and8 and and um we're not going to get to it tonight but I just want you to look at this but the Beast the Beast is the power that's the anointing of the devil the Beast that thou sawest was and is not shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition now the Beast that was that's the that's the that's the world power that's Rome that thou sawest it was that was the last Roman power and is not that Roman the the the world power ceased and and yet it comes back and it shall descend it shall come back Ascend out of the bottomless pit what is a what is the bottomless pit brother brandom taught us the bottomless pit is religion without a foundation the bottomless pit is religion with no Foundation and then he says and shall go into predition it shall go into hell amen that's brother bram's interpretation of it and and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life when they Shall Behold the Beast that was is not and yet is can you say Amen so so what it went down in in Pagan Rome it came back in Pap roome amen so so this is what this is what we're dealing with here amen it would it happened in this day amen in that in in our generation in this Roman Empire it comes back Hallelujah and and if there's ever a church that is built without any kind of foundation we're living in it amen now let's let's continue reading now did you catch something there isn't that the same that that same spirit in uh right in the church today isn't there a group that claims they are the original and true church and that salvation is found only in her don't they claim that they have the Keys of the Kingdom which they received from Peter don't they claim that Peter was their first pope and that he resided in Rome when it was absolute there is absolutely no historical fact for it and and even her most educated and knowing adherence believe her lives Satan's synagogue if Satan be her father and he the father of Lies then it is not strange that those in his synagogue are liars also consider the the thought of blasphemy these are Satan's synagogue uh these of Satan's synagogue were not blaspheming God in this instance though that goes without saying but they were blaspheming the true church certainly as Cain persecuted and killed Abel because he Cain was of that Wicked one and as the dead formal judaic followers Jesus said they were of their father the devil tried to destroy the Christians in the first few years of the first age now this same group The False fine is even more strongly attempting to destroy the True Believer in the second age the Antichrist spirit is growing the group that inched its way ever so slowly into the church by its Deeds nanism no longer fears exposure but is openly organized in a group of its own assembling and is coming against the true church in undisguised hostility and Buddy it was a bloody it was a Satan was after that early church he says now when I say this was an organized Antichrist church I'm giving you the truth from authenticated history the first church founded in Rome we will Trace its history in the manian age had already turned the truth of God into a Lie by introducing a Pagan religion with Christian names and meaning by the second age it was so Pagan though claiming to be the true church that polycarp came about 1,500 miles at a very old age to plead with them to turn back they would not do it they had a solid hierarchy and a solid organization ation a complete departure from the word this then is Satan's synagogue full of blasphemy in which they were already the seeds in which were already the seeds of the doctrine of nianis which would shortly be the actual seat and power of satanic religion this is exactly right for Revelations 29b does not say these people are of the syn of Satan's synagogue it says they are Satan's synagogue the spirit of antichrist is not new this is not something that just came in in in the church ages it has been here all along to get a clear understanding of how it works how it goes against God and takes over the church look at the Old Testament and see there let us examine the spirit as it was manifest in Israel as she came out of Egypt to be the church in the wilderness just as the early church started out under the pure Ministry of the holy spirit with signs and wonders and manifestations such as prophecy tongues interpretation wisdom knowledge and healing so in in the days of Israel when they left Egypt they were under the leadership of the spirit of God manifesting in gifts God was the leader of the people actually he was their King he was a father King he took care of Israel and like a man cares for his family he fed them fought their battles smoothed away their difficulties settled their problems he just busied himself over them they were the only nation to which God to which he was truly God but one day they got to looking around and they saw the Philistines and other nations with Kings over them it caught their eyes and they decided that they ought to humanize their leadership so they wanted a king now God was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ but they got ahead of him Satan knew the plan of God so he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of God the word so when they when they approached Samuel and asked for a King Samuel was so dismayed that his heart almost failed him God had been leading his people through this consecrated spir uh scripture Vindicated prophet and he felt that he had been rejected he gathered the people and pleaded with them not to turn away from The God Who had carried them like children prospered them and blessed them but they persisted they said to Samuel you you've never been wrong in your leading you have never been dishonest in your financial dealings you have you have done the best to keep your best to keep us in line with the word of God we appreciate the Miracles and wisdom and provision and protection of God we believe in it we like it first furthermore we don't want to be without it it's just that we want a king to lead us to battle now of course when we go out to battle it is still Our intention to have the priest go ahead and with Judah following we will blow the trumpets and shout and sing We don't intend to stop any of that but we want a king who is one of us to lead us and God said to Samuel see they have not rejected you they have rejected me from ruling over them how tragic that was little did they realize that when they were asking when they were asking God to let them be like the rest of the world they were rejecting him because God had ordained that his people act different from the world and I just want to say we different from the world we're different amen you kids don't look at your parents and say I want to be like that no you're different you're not even close your setup is totally different from the from the setup of this Cosmos this world system this is this is God we you've got another leadership it's the spirit of divine love that is leading us brother bradam says what it is he says if you could see the funnel of it it's lve that's funneling right down into his church that we can walk according to his ways hallelujah it's not restrictions it's not it's not anything of that nature it is God's love to me and I my choosing to follow that love oh my it's just a great big love relationship between you and God and you children are blessed you're blessed to have amen parents that are wanting to follow the ways of the Lord amen and not just be religious but they are walking after the presence of God he says now he says God uh God had ordained that his people act different from the world and I now I'm saying you young people but I'm I'm saying for us all too I'm not just putting it out to you to it's every one of us but but sometimes we as the children like the children of Israel well we got our own Concepts the way we want things to go and how things should go and we we look out to the world especially when you get teenagers you want it this way or done that way God must be our leader amen they are not of the world they don't look like the world they don't act like the world they are crucified under the world and the world is crucified under them 2 Corinthians 6:17 through 18 wherefore come out from among them be ye separate sayeth the Lord touch not the unclean thing I will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty you see the one difference between Israel and the rest of the Nations was God put God to one side and Israel was like any other Nation when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside in the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it the world and the church are of the same lump just like Jacob and Esau we're of the same parents but the spirit of God makes the difference it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone can do that that's right the point is whether you have the spirit of God in you for without that Spirit you are repeate you are none of his amen not only not not too long ago I asked a woman if she were a Christian she said I will have you to know sir that I burn a candle every night what in the world has that got to do with it I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a Pentecostal that hasn't a thing to do with it it is the holy ghost or Parish well starting way back there in the first church the people got to thinking and reasoning how to improve on God the Deeds of the nicians begin showing themselves then a group formed they drifted away from the pattern of the word all it takes is just one word changed and that little leaven then leavens the whole lump he then offend he that offends in one point of the law is guilty of all Eve just changed one word and that will do it when sat when when that Satan centered group was formed it began to hate and to fight the True Believers insisting that they the aliens were the church of god notice how organization breeds hatred it destroys Fellowship it makes bitter bitterness that is what myrr means this is what samna was full of bitterness the root of bitterness defiles many so more so so more and more defilement was coming in each age would feel its scars the saman church had drifted far from the original it had become a hybrid it had hybridized itself the way Eve did you know that you know that a hybrid is what comes of two species mixing the result is no longer pure like the original it is a mongrel well when Eve allowed the Beast to mingle his seed with hers she produced a creature like called Cain that wasn't pure human he was of that Wicked one notice how different he was from Abel notice how different he was from Seth he hated God and would not obey the word persecuted and killed the righteous he set himself up above the word of God the church too has departed from what she originally was she is a hybrid that is the church nominal is a hybrid people say I'm Baptist it wasn't so in the beginning I'm Methodist it wasn't so in the beginning instead of the straight word of God instead of the Spirit-filled men in the church who were led by spirit-given Revelation there are now Creeds and bylaws the educated guesses of educated men learning has taken the place of Revelation reason has replaced Faith program replaced uh spontaneous praise in the Holy Ghost it wasn't so from the beginning the whole species has changed it has become a hybrid Church now then when the church becomes hybridized will it produce pure Christians it can't the life or the seed that brings Christians to birth is not in them light BR uh brings forth light Baptists bring forth more Baptists they act like Baptist Methodist bring forth Methodist they act like Methodist not one is known by the power of God nor can they be for it's not there they are known by their ceremonial worship of God and their Creeds and dogmas talk about a hybrid do you know the most famous hybrid in the world it has been with us for ages it's the mule it's a cross between a donkey and a horse he's a funny kind of animal he can't reproduce himself he has no life that can do that yet talk about work he can outwork the horse or the donkey but watch his nature he is stubborn you can never trust him he is a perfect picture of hybrid religion a cross between truth and darkness oh God for the horse is a p is a type of the True Believer and the ass a picture of the unrighteous one mix them and you have a sterile formal religion it hasn't the seed of life it is dead you it can talk about truth but it can't produce it it doesn't have God in its myth yet it gathers together and talks about God all the while systematically denies the power they will deny the word in the very name of the Lord now that that is that is quite that that's amazing that's amazing but this is what it produced this is when you mix well this is the way I think it well I I I you you you you can't mix what God's word says and what you think it you can't mix humanism in with the pure word of God it cannot produce anything but death you cannot produce anything but death when you do that that's the reason why we've got to stay with the word that's the reason why you can sit in a message church amen and and and not be able and you're just as sterile as sterile can be because you're taking what you think and what the prophet thinks then you're trying to mix it all together and and and it just it just ain't going to work it just won't work can you say Amen you can't do that amen now so it says and there is never it says they will deny the word in the very name of the Lord and we we'll get to that in just a minute until you can you you you can you can you can say that uh uh uh there's a trinity when there's not even a trinity found in the Bible you you can say the the still the biggest religion or the biggest denomination in Christianity is still the Catholic Church where where where where in the Bible do you do you see praying with to to to Peter or to Mary where where in the Bible do you see any kind of an intercessor or Purgatory where in the Bible and they are the largest denomination of the Christian faith the reason why the scripture says that the daughters will be thrown into the same bed with the with with mother is because they came out they came out but soon as they came out God give give them a revelation and what do they do they go right back and start organizing man's Creeds and once you get men involved in it amen and Men start trying to run the church and they're trying to to do this that and the other before you know it it you the the life of God leaves that church it's just a bunch of it's just a bunch of men trying to to to to get uh to to get members into the church because the life of God is not there we and and that's and that's where it's at it's got to be that real Divine relationship between me and God real Divine oh I I tell you if we let if we have that real Divine relationship between me and God even your natural thoughts would change amen your spiritual thoughts will definitely change but You' begin to you'd begin to sense the spirit of God in your every every uh uh daytoday walk with him the presence of God would be there convicting here and pulling you aside here and doing this here why because it's the presence of God living it's not a religion it's it's the power of life it's God's life living in human beings Hallelujah now now brother brandham is fixing to say now he's fixing to show that there was blood that was that was made available uh uh for the donkey amen and there's blood made available for uh uh the horse but there's no blood in the in the in the Old Testament that was made for the mule it says now they deny the word in the name of the in the very name of the Lord and there is never any hope for them do you realize that no organization or organized religion ever had a Revival never once they organized they died they can't come back no sir I can show you that in a type in Exodus 13-13 every firstling of an ass shall th Thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou will not redeem it then Thou shalt break his neck and all of the firstborn of the man among thy children Thou shalt redeem they ask can be redeemed every miserable sinner can be Redeemed by the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ or in rejecting Christ be rejected himself but you don't redeem the mule there is no Redemption for him there is no blood for him there can't be because the mule takes refuge in the church the ass takes refuge in the blood the mule has no seed in him that can be quickened but the ass has seed why why just a few weeks ago I read an editorial yes it was it was an editorial by an unsaved uh businessman not not by a Christian he said that he was amazed at the churches he could not understand them they had seminaries filled with professors who taught the word of God in order to destroy it now then this man could not figure that out he was appalled by it he said that could understand the atheist or the communist or the freethinker or someone else doing that but when the church itself destroyed the word of God it was tantamount to premeditated murder there is your hybrid religion wake up America before it is too late when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything it is like Eve when Cain was born she says I've gotten a man from the Lord now watch this he says now do you realize that she really meant that she thought that she had a man from the Lord you see once she had been deceived by taking the word of Satan instead of the word of God then she then thought that whatsoever or whatever she said was right if she said she had a man from God then she had a man from God God has set laws into his Universe a good seed can only bring forth good fruit evil seed can only bring forth evil fruit now each seed though diffic or different will utilize the same Earth nourishment moisture and sunshine but it will bring forth after its own kind notice the history of the of the can line notice the history of the Seth line only one difference between them the Original Seed nothing nothing else wow amen now any anyone got anything you want to say or any questions up to this point aren't you glad for the seed of God that's why we got to keep that word pure folks and in this message don't hybridize this message with something else Hallelujah I look I I look there at at the life of God Even in our in our our prophet he he is is his whole his whole being was that that word be kept pure you can hear it when his shaking when he in his bosom at at the at the beginning and and there in 48 at the first tape and you can hear it oh just radiating even greater in the last of his sermons saying stay with the word before he was saying the word is promised us the word is promised us oh we're in the and then when after the after the church re rejected it amen and they and and and they now he's starting screaming get back get back you're forsaking your very own life get back to the word and out of brother bram's very being oozed Redemption did you notice that just ooze while he was screaming out it was just bleeding wanting Redemption wanting there was such a love for him for his fellow man amen any anyone else anyone have anything you any questions yes line reproduce well that well that is that is good now it was in it was in a type it it was simply in a type uh that brother brandham was using that but the only way that you're going to ever get a mule is to hybrid is to take the word and to take man put it together and that's how it has happened all through the All Through the Ages they take the word of God put that in your heart so so while it cannot reproduce anything but yet it is you are you are still simply taking it you you are uh anytime you want a mule you're you're going to have to take the word of God and you're going to have to take a uh uh the words of a man and bring it together now so so you you understand that part now I I think though brother brandham is is bringing that in uh uh you know that about the mule and and typing him to Cain um I think what he is saying is there is the seed of the serpent that is going to be going down going to be going down through and but they themselves will take the word and and man's ideal and humanism bringing them together which will do nothing but produce death they will be teachers of death so so the seed of the serpent is still reproducing that that that seed is still reproducing but his children are are are taking that word and producing death in in their in their churches and in in religion and definitely in this in this other uh deal so you got to know in other words you got to know where to start and to stop your types you you see what I'm saying the Revival that brother Brandon was talking about is and and and not being able to produce not necessarily uh producing children but producing death so so when you take if our church here if if if our church here takes the word of of God and man man's ideas put it together it cannot produce Revival it will produce death it will stagnant if any family any family takes the word of God takes this uh uh uh man-made opinion put it this way it will die it cannot go any further you see what I'm saying now that doesn't necessarily that doesn't necessarily mean that you're not the seed of Christ that this church is not you know have have the seed of Christ in it it simply means that if you do it that way and I think we can all say Amen to that that we have tried it uh and we've all experience death when we hybridize the word of God in any area of our life it always produce death you can come back to repent and because you are a son of God you can come back repent wash yourselves and move on now is that is that does that answer your question or no well I don't I don't feel like I answered that too good we we'll get back to it I look atual you don't take dog you are going to Beed mule but if you take the word of God then you're the Seed of Abraham then you are a full-blooded horse or you're a full-blooded donkey because they're not mixing those two animals in the physical to make that working hor that working mule but in the spiritual realm each each Body of Christ is a horse or a donkey if you want to call it but in the spiritual Realm it looks more to me he's talking more in the spiritual realm that that mule can't produce so Cain could could not produce God he brought a sacrifice but it wasn't a right sacrifice he tried to worship a God but he couldn't worship God because he didn't have it in him he didn't have a seed in him to to come with the revelation of what God is that's that's that's a that's a good that's a better explanation the seat the seed of the the the seed of the serpent is not does not have the ability to produce the life of the word there's there's there's nothing to mix it with it will always go back and and and hybridize the word of God which will produce death absolutely but the seed of the serpent is the seed of the serpent is still is still multiplying they're they're still they are still here on the earth it didn't die with cane you know um so uh any any other any other y'all want to add to that um that that's a very good question actually MH another czy M well we we we know that it cannot produce we we we know that you it the anything but pure word is the pure word is the only thing that can produce pure Revival and so when you see the when you see the masses and those kinds of things coming then then you you you've got to know that according to the scripture that that we read uh that sister Keys put up there earlier that the whole world will follow after that Beast that that anointing so it's going to be this this this this this cane seed or this this this false Vine is going to grow until the whole world is full of that and so they will have their revivals and they will fill their stadiums they will have those things but it will not have anything to do with eternal life which goes back it cannot produce life as brother as brother williiam uh uh beautifully put it it cannot change it cannot change lives not not not not in a heart to go right back to the word of God to believe every word they can't produce those things so so yes it is it is a movement and it's under the name of God and it has been birthed out of the church but it is still a mule system it it can't it it it can't do it and so uh uh so the way you look at it when you when you're seeing all of these great revivals the scripture says that the that the righteous will scarly be saved then how and where shall the the The Sinner and the ungodly appear so that and and listen the scripture says that he's going to have to cut it short for the elect sake so so again thank God for a prophet or we would be those guys catching planes going down there and taking our shirts off and trying to get baptized and and uh no no the the Revival is in his word that's Hallelujah and Satan's generation will never look to a going back and dying to that word d out to that word amen all right good questions tonight any anything else before we before we go on any further any are we all understanding you young people understanding what we're reading man we like dumb questions yeah well well spiritually um well Cain or or Abel didn't not have any seed Abel was cut he was cut short he was killed there so so Cain was the one that carried the lineage of Adam on through but the question the legitimate question is is well you know where's who's where's the seed of The Serpent and where's the seed of of of um of Seth today and U because you know we need to make sure we're careful of who we marry we don't want want to marry the seed of the serpent um but actually we're all intermingled it's it's it's it's an intermingling uh so Cain's lineage seed's or uh U uh Seth's lineage it's all it's all there it it it had to have came over through the flood uh in the ark there was eight there was eight Souls that was there so the sons of Noah married uh the sons the daughters of of of U one of them married the wrong one amen and and so uh it it all intermingled so so to say today I I would say that we all um well we we all came from Eve that's for sure we we don't we don't know the exact that exact lineage as far as that goes you know Eve's the mother of us all so now so where does the seed of the serpent well just as Christ is now this the Royal seed or the spiritual Seed of Abraham so has Satan now anointed he has transformed himself into that angel of Light and he's got a seed here on Earth so it's a spiritual lineage you see what I'm saying so so we don't have to be a Jew to be a Christian no that you know the bloodline is is no long it's the Royal bloodline yes sir it's the blood of Christ that has come to redeem usall amen and so did that did that that answer your question in a well we got to tell me because I might be hearing it different okay sister Carol amen that's right listen you you you if not if not I mean I've got some wonderful family wonderful family that and and um um just you know in the charismatic move and and so you know I remember back when Trump boy I I had I had some really matter fact they're pastors there in town in in Tulsa and just tell me you got to follow this prophet and uh well man that Prophet was given I mean he had thus sayith the Lord that that Trump was going to get in and and uh and so I you know I followed it and boy I mean he was he was you know the the the one the one deal I mean he was lost in the spirit and I mean he gave a long prophecy of everything that was going to take place and I mean and it man it it looked like this guy was he was in another world and and the congregation was in another world and and and so I'm thinking man it was it was sort of making chills go up and down my spine and and then but but I had to come and but I had to come back to the word when you when you forsake the word you're just subject to anything that's and I look there and this the Trump was going to bring the Revival and the the this nation I'm thinking oh great day Hallelujah and and I you know I it was false didn't happen it didn't happen and um and he never apologized neither and he's still preaching and they's still say it say it over and over it don't make it don't you don't have to be accurate just keep what they're so blinded they are so deceived that no matter if the guy's a ranked liar claiming that God gave him the prophecy and yet they still Pat his his his wallet and bank account he still has thousands going to his church and and and he's still on the internet just all over the place he's a liar he's a deceiver but the thing is this is where we're at when you forsake the word you are game for anything amen that's right Hallelujah all right so so we are already at 8:30 guys and we didn't even we didn't make it through um you see y'all want y'all want to try another another page or do youall want um let's see um okay so we stopped up here at 12 did someone else have I'm sorry did someone else have something else they were another question or something Jesus Christ being the word himself and what he came to do you would think that the Sadducees and Pharisees would have been the ones that would have received him yeah yeah and yet he separated yeah Ministry of the word separated very true very true yes amen amen absolutely that is that is so true it's that Living Word that and and it's and and and and in and in all reality that is very that that's the son of man that that brother bradam said that had to return and he would when he would talk about the son of man returning he would always go back to to to Hebrews 4 the word that discerns and that that divides aund and and that's where we are the Living Word not a baptism of the Holy Ghost but brother bradam says the Holy Ghost himself returned back to the church The Living Word Among Us and thus dividing and separating and oh don't don't don't don't just don't don't just look out there and say Well they're deceived and I'm not brother you can be deceived sitting in this church here we've got that word must discern let that living word discern everything about you can you say amen amen that that's exactly right now let's let's look here um [Music] um okay so let's let's just read let let's just let's just re finish what this um um okay we're going to read down we're going to read down to the end of 26 here where we're already at 126 it says if you look at the statement we're we're in the first paragraph here statement of Eve real close you will notice that she had more of an understanding than most realized she did not attribute the son to Satan for that would have made him equal with God only God could create the egg in the womb of Mary Satan couldn't do that Eve knew that Satan can only pervert so he beguiled her with the wrong seed it was through it was the Serpent's Seed that brought forth Cain it was Adam's seed that brought forth Abel and Seth those seeds went through exactly the same process but the children were different for they came they were from different seeds she believed that Cain was from God she accepted the devil's lie as the truth of God that is exactly what we have now churches set themselves up as Fountains of truth but the truth is not in them yet they are begotten children swear by them and will even kill to uphold their error if you think this is an exaggeration read all of second Timothy in the chapter 3 the first five verses of the fourth chapter 2 Timothy 4:1 through 5 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long suffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist and make full proof of thy Ministry when the church allowed herself to move away from the original like Adam and Eve death set in there is no strength in her she has become a monstrosity the minute the church moved toward form and ceremony and toward priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decided leadership apart from the Holy Spirit and his word that very moment death entered and she started to get sick and as she got sick she changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument she could not produce nothing in the spirit for her hopes were built on program and not on faith in his word they sowed program so they reap program they sowed perversion so they reaped perverted children amen so we will stop here for tonight and then we will we will finish cuz there is a lot of other things and I uh some good stuff in these next deal but hey we've got we've got all year we can we can amen we we've already been doing this for what eight or nine weeks well even even beyond that because we we were on the um uh the Sevenfold personage for a long time too so um did you enjoy the reading [Music] tonight amen oh Sons and Daughters of God let us let us walk with God let us walk with god let's seek to please him with everything that is within us I I want to please the Lord as the song that we sing I just want to please the Lord I want it I want it to be I don't want to be one of those guys that are looking at the that are that are looking you know at the guys uh uh in that denomination or in that in that church you know across town at that church and and then justify my thoughts my motives my I I I want I want my motives to be justified by Jesus Christ himself and anything that is against that oh Lord God let me let me uh bow myself before God prostrate oursel I I tell you prayer is so important and so in in all of our walks with god let's seek to to honor him now if you're not walking with God and if you're not spending that time with the Lord then you're just going to follow your natural ways but if the Lord is but the Lord wants to lead every one of you he does there's then there's no there's no there's there there's no difference in young and old I I just don't think so I don't think there's any difference between preacher and and and and and the congregation God wants to speak to us all and lead us all he wants us all to walk with him he wants to he wants to be our influence he wants his presence to be with us and all that we do I want him to be pleased maybe we can sing that song tonight amen I don't know the de I just want to please the Lord be in his will in every way to be lost in his presence found in his [Music] likess oh yes oh I just want I want to please you Lord be in his [Music] will in every way to in his presence found in his light to hear I have found that not everyone's going to have those personal convictions like I have I have found that not everyone is going to feel the call to come into that place the way God might draw me he talks to us all I I'm not saying that he's not going to draw meat he's not going to draw dra you to prayer like he draws me to prayer but I am saying that I'm responsible before God for my heart and I'm going to follow God in my heart you're responsible before God in your heart and you've got to follow him see organized religion says all right this is the way it's all got to be done here's the list of rules this is the way it is and when you complete the 10 things here then you're okay religion has its own way of
