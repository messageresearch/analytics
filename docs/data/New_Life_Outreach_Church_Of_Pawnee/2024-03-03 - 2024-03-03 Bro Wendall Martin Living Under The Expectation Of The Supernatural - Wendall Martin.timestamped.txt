[3:28] for
[3:44] making himself a Doctrine and standing
[3:46] that Doctrine and then they got so much
[3:49] tuck away till the Holy Spirit couldn't
[3:51] get into the
[3:52] church they just become another Idol
[3:55] like a brass serpent it become an
[3:58] idolatry every fell said I am belong to
[4:01] this and I belong to that it was an
[4:03] idolatry what a mess we were in at the
[4:06] end time but God rich in his Mercy has
[4:11] sent back the Holy Spirit upon us and
[4:14] vindicating his word tonight as he
[4:17] promised he would do God promised he
[4:21] would do these things look what he did
[4:23] look what he did how now we can see how
[4:27] he promised each age a certain thing to
[4:30] happen and we find out that it happened
[4:33] just exactly like it and he said that he
[4:36] would do because he's rich in his Mercy
[4:38] to always have mercy to fulfill every
[4:41] word that he has promised he has to do
[4:43] it and always in order to stay God
[4:47] always he does this his word always
[4:50] comes to pass in its season his seed
[4:52] that he has sold into the Earth what did
[4:54] he do he put it here in the word and
[4:57] that's a seed and every time the age
[4:59] comes along that seed wrens up and then
[5:02] uh Reformation comes forth and he
[5:06] promised it and it does that now we did
[5:09] not deserve these things we did not
[5:12] deserve these blessings of God because
[5:15] we had went out after the things of the
[5:17] world went in the air of Cain Cain
[5:20] building a nice Altar and a nice Church
[5:23] putting flowers up on it and thought
[5:24] that's exactly what it was it was a
[5:26] bunch of apples or pears or pomeg grants
[5:29] or whatever it was his father and mother
[5:31] had eat in the Garden of Eden it run him
[5:33] out and so he offered that back to God
[5:35] and God rejected it but Abel by faith
[5:40] offered unto God a more excellent
[5:42] sacrifice than King and today the Bible
[5:45] said in Jude that they have run in the
[5:48] way of
[5:49] Cain perished in the gain sand of Kora
[5:53] see running the way of cing building
[5:55] altars building churches denominations
[5:57] making it flowerly big more members than
[5:59] the rest of them taking in things
[6:01] anything that come along and it jumped
[6:03] up and down or shook hands or was
[6:05] baptized a certain way or spoken tongues
[6:06] or run through the floor they put their
[6:08] name on the book that's right and then
[6:11] turn on the real truth that be preached
[6:14] and
[6:15] denied how can it be so notice what a
[6:19] mess we were in notice and the Bible
[6:22] said and they went in the way of
[6:24] balum and perished in the gain saan of
[6:28] Kora
[6:30] perished in the gain s what was the gain
[6:32] s of Kora well you think you're the only
[6:35] holy man well God's all of us are holy
[6:38] the whole church is all right ever all
[6:40] of us get together that's what we ought
[6:41] to do that's where they perish that and
[6:46] we truly deserved it we deserve to be
[6:49] that but God rich in Mercy has pulled us
[6:53] out of that chaos and let us see it
[6:55] before the thing hits here rich in his
[6:58] Mercy and sent us back a Revival of
[7:02] Divine Healing and the coming again of
[7:05] the power of God according to history no
[7:08] Revival ever lasted over three years
[7:11] this revival carried for 15 years it's
[7:14] been a burning fires around and around
[7:17] the world why because we deserve it God
[7:20] rich in his Mercy not because we desired
[7:24] it or because we deserved it rather just
[7:27] think of what it's done I think of one
[7:30] of your sisters right here in Phoenix
[7:33] that many of you know Miss Haddie
[7:36] walr she had cancer of the
[7:39] heart and she was in the prayer line up
[7:42] here when Brother Moore and I were here
[7:45] the first time about 15 18 years ago and
[7:50] she was dying with cancer of the heart
[7:53] and she should have been dead a long
[7:56] time ago but God rich in Mercy thank you
[8:01] Lord sent his power upon her and he
[8:04] saved her life and she's living
[8:07] today God rich in Mercy Congressman
[8:11] Upshaw a great man uh I think he was the
[8:15] president or something of the of the
[8:18] Baptist uh Southern Baptist convention
[8:21] at one time or vice president or
[8:23] something he had done all he was a good
[8:25] man he did all that he know how to do he
[8:27] went to every doctor nobody could do
[8:30] nothing for him he was bound down
[8:32] ministers had prayed for him he' had a
[8:35] gallon of oil poured on his head
[8:36] anointing of different ministers
[8:38] everywhere one night Los Angeles
[8:42] California walking up to the pull pit
[8:44] looking a bunch of wheelchairs about
[8:46] twice three times and watch sitting
[8:49] there all up and down the aisles back
[8:51] and
[8:52] forth and then there laid over there a
[8:55] cop with a little colored girl and
[8:57] little negro uh girl and her her mother
[9:01] was sitting by her and my brother had
[9:03] bringing the prayer line up and I was
[9:06] looking knowing not what was going on
[9:09] and I seen a doctor with Tardis shell
[9:12] glasses operating on a little negro girl
[9:16] for a throat condition and she paralyzed
[9:19] and I looked around I thought where is
[9:21] the child at I couldn't see her after a
[9:24] while way down there no hope lovely
[9:26] little girl about seven or eight years
[9:28] old to be she paralyzed the rest of her
[9:30] life there was her mother down there on
[9:34] her knees
[9:35] praying then I said this doctor operate
[9:40] on your little girl in descri she said
[9:42] that's right sir and she tried to get
[9:44] the baby to the platform they told her
[9:46] not to do it they tried to quieten her
[9:48] down by the time they got her quiet I
[9:50] thought well we'll get a chance to pray
[9:52] for her in a few minutes maybe people
[9:54] right here was there that night and I
[9:57] was looking out over the audience I I
[9:59] seen that little girl going down look
[10:03] like through a a little narrow road with
[10:06] a doll in her arms rocking that doll no
[10:10] matter how much the doctor said that she
[10:13] was going to be paralyzed arrest of her
[10:15] life God rich in Mercy sent down the
[10:19] Holy Spirit by a vision and that little
[10:21] girl got up out of there and she and her
[10:24] mother H hold her hands and walked down
[10:26] through that aisle praising God way back
[10:30] there said an old man Congressman Upshaw
[10:33] many of you knows his testimony he had
[10:36] been a good man tried all of his life 66
[10:39] years an invalent in a wheelchair pushed
[10:41] in bed crutches under his arms that he
[10:44] walked with never no more to walk normal
[10:47] and there he sat there looking on that
[10:49] all of a sudden I looked out and saw a
[10:52] vision Gary come walking down across the
[10:54] top of that
[10:56] audience bowing his head walk as good as
[10:59] anybody I didn't know who the man was I
[11:01] said there's a great man sitting back
[11:03] there he fell off of a wagon when he was
[11:05] a little boy or onto a hay frame and
[11:08] heard his back they board Holes in the
[11:11] Floor to keep the vibration when the
[11:13] people walk from striking on his back I
[11:17] said he becomes a great man and he keeps
[11:19] growing greater he's sitting in a great
[11:21] circle at the White House and then this
[11:23] man come and told me said that's
[11:25] Congressman upsh you ever hear him I
[11:26] said never heard of him and so he run a
[11:28] little ension mic back there and he was
[11:30] talking back and forth then I started to
[11:32] look around I seen the old Congressman
[11:34] coming walking towards me in a vision
[11:37] just as perfect and normal as he could
[11:38] be God rich in Mercy pulled him from
[11:42] that wheelchair and he walked without
[11:45] cutes till the day he
[11:46] died God rich in Mercy when doctors had
[11:51] fail when science had fail when
[11:53] everything else had failed God was rich
[11:57] in Mercy the congressman up y I think of
[12:00] myself as a little old boy I remember as
[12:03] a people call me today a woman hater the
[12:06] reason it was because I seen so much
[12:08] immorality out of women when I was a kid
[12:11] I hated them and I don't do that now
[12:14] because I know these some good ones but
[12:16] I remember how it was so bad so immoral
[12:21] and I thought my I I'll never be around
[12:25] where people's at I have no education so
[12:27] I won't get any and little old kid
[12:29] sitting there not even a shirt on with
[12:31] my uh coat pinned up like this with a
[12:34] safety pin and it real hot and the
[12:36] teacher said William aren't you hot with
[12:38] that coat on I said no ma'am I'm a
[12:40] little bit chilly and she made me go
[12:42] over to the stove and and put some wood
[12:44] in the stove and I like to burn up I I I
[12:46] didn't have no shirt that whole season
[12:48] through and I thought if I could ever
[12:51] get the money sometime it I could get a
[12:53] little uh get me a 3030 rifle i' come
[12:56] out west here and live out here and hunt
[12:59] for the rest of my life I didn't want
[13:00] nothing to do with people just stay away
[13:02] because they didn't like me and and I
[13:04] just stay away from them and then every
[13:06] time i' go downtown to talk to anybody
[13:09] see some Fellas on the street I knew I'd
[13:10] say hello there John Jim how are you oh
[13:13] hello see they didn't want to talk to me
[13:15] didn't want nothing to do with me
[13:17] because of my daddy and land that made
[13:19] whiskey and I I didn't do that it was
[13:22] nothing I done and I would have been
[13:23] that type but now I said to the wife not
[13:25] long ago my wall is plastered with the
[13:28] best guns that can be bought oh and I
[13:31] think of them old dirty clothes tonight
[13:34] I've got two or three good suits and no
[13:37] friends I have to hide out in the
[13:39] wilderness to keep away from people
[13:41] what's the matter is it because of my
[13:43] personality is it because of my
[13:44] education no God rich in Mercy saw me in
[13:50] that condition and he saved me I
[13:52] remember being led by the arms as a
[13:54] blind man I could not see everything
[13:57] from me was a blur I'd be blind the rest
[14:00] of my life but God rich in Mercy
[14:02] restored back my sight I'm 55 years old
[14:05] and still got good sight God rich in
[14:08] Mercy is the only thing that I can say
[14:12] once the church had no provided way of
[14:14] healing they had one but they turned it
[14:16] down but God rich in Mercy has sent them
[14:20] a gift of Divine Healing that is the
[14:23] holy spirit Among Us confirming the word
[14:26] with signs following God rich and mercy
[14:29] I have two or three pages here of these
[14:30] does but I ain't going to try to strike
[14:32] them because I'm I'm conscious that it's
[14:34] almost time to start that prayer line
[14:36] but God rich in his Mercy many of you
[14:38] here tonight the doctors turned you down
[14:40] there's people sitting them wheelchairs
[14:42] they'll probably never come out of there
[14:45] they were there to stay someone
[14:46] paralyzed in different way they would
[14:48] never couldn't come out there's no way
[14:49] for them to come out but God rich in his
[14:52] Mercy has provided an
[14:55] atonement don't turn it down receive it
[14:59] there's men out there with heart trouble
[15:01] there's people with Cancers if the
[15:02] doctors can do nothing with you're
[15:04] hopeless helpless in this world but God
[15:07] rich in his Mercy has sent down the Holy
[15:10] Ghost and right here now to confirm the
[15:12] word to prove that he's the same
[15:14] yesterday today and forever yes amen
[15:17] because we deserve it because God is
[15:20] rich in his
[15:23] Mercy
[15:24] amen now that's the one that's the
[15:27] person it's that Lord Jesus he is not
[15:31] dead but he has risen from the dead and
[15:33] he's alive forever more and he's the
[15:36] same yesterday today and forever still
[15:39] just as rich in his Mercy as he was to
[15:41] the woman that had a blood issue and she
[15:44] started through the crowd there was no
[15:46] hopes for her the doctors had done all
[15:48] they could do she had a blood issue she
[15:50] was dying and she touched the Master's
[15:53] garment God rich in Mercy turned around
[15:57] and told her I were cond I condition and
[15:59] she was healed of this Blood issue a
[16:02] little foul prostitute went up to a well
[16:05] one day to get some water no hope she'd
[16:07] been excommunicated from The Virgins
[16:09] from around the people her life was no
[16:11] good and she thought what's the use of
[16:14] trying I'm turned out there's nothing
[16:16] left for me but she looks standing over
[16:18] on the side or standing by the side of
[16:20] the well and there was a man sitting
[16:23] there who told her all things that she
[16:25] has ever done God rich in his Mercy that
[16:29] same God tonight's just as rich in his
[16:31] mercy and just the same as he was in
[16:33] them days God
[16:36] rich I think we have 200 prayer cards
[16:39] out here or what we've called out of
[16:41] them 200 we're going to call them and
[16:44] let the people line up we're going to
[16:46] pray for them but before we do it let
[16:49] there be some newcomers here that get
[16:52] away from all
[16:55] superstitions this is not a superstition
[16:59] it is a manifestation of a promise of
[17:02] God it depends on what
[17:04] you're don't virtue in any man there's
[17:08] no power in no man but we as Believers
[17:12] have authority not power but
[17:16] Authority someone asked me how long ago
[17:18] said brother brand you believe you got
[17:19] power to do this I I ain't got no power
[17:21] at all but I've got Authority every
[17:24] believer has it if you refuse it you'll
[17:27] stay where you're at but if you'll
[17:29] accept it it'll do the exceeding
[17:31] abundance because God is rich in his
[17:34] Mercy take a little policeman stand out
[17:36] you're on the street his clothes hanging
[17:38] half off of him he's just skinny the
[17:41] Cap's got his ears pulled down and he
[17:44] walk out there where cars are coming
[17:45] down that street at 50 mil an hour 300
[17:48] horsepower motors in them he hasn't got
[17:50] the power to stop a bicycle that's right
[17:54] but just let him Blow That Whistle and
[17:55] hold up that hand and watch the break
[17:57] squeak he hasn't got power but he's got
[17:59] Authority the whole city is behind him
[18:02] and when a man or a woman I don't care
[18:04] what condition you're in you've got the
[18:06] authority of God by
[18:09] promise because his rich and promise to
[18:12] do exceedingly abundantly if you say to
[18:14] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[18:16] in your heart but believe that what you
[18:18] said will come to pass you can have what
[18:20] you've said got no power but you got
[18:24] Authority remember when he told me back
[18:26] there I said you'll be able to reveal
[18:28] this secrets of the hearts you do you
[18:30] remember that many you Phoenix people he
[18:33] promised it what he promises he
[18:37] does now there's some of you here that
[18:39] hasn't got prayer cards and no doubt how
[18:41] many sick and don't have prayer cards
[18:43] raise up your
[18:45] hands all right if you want to know not
[18:48] Authority not power but the authority of
[18:51] the word the things that I do shall you
[18:54] also Jesus Promised in Luke
[18:59] 1730 that just before his coming there
[19:02] would be like the time of No Moses or
[19:05] Noah when they were eating and drinking
[19:08] and giving in marriage and knew not to
[19:10] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[19:12] he said to be that time then he said
[19:13] also as it was in the days of lot and
[19:17] said this will take place in that day
[19:19] when the son of man shall be
[19:22] revealed when the son of man is revealed
[19:26] in the last days now what he how the son
[19:29] of man revealed himself in the person of
[19:32] this Angel which was the son of man
[19:36] absolutely Abraham called him Elohim he
[19:39] was a son of man revealed himself just
[19:41] before the Gentile world was burned how
[19:44] did he do it to the
[19:46] believer to the make believer he sent
[19:48] two preachers down to preach to him but
[19:50] to the real believer he stood with his
[19:52] back to the tent and he said
[19:54] Abraham amen is Abram the day a few days
[19:58] before before that but now he Abraham

[20:37] our family relationship has ceased many
[20:40] many years ago how could this be and she
[20:42] laughed about it and the angel with the
[20:45] son of man with his back turned to the
[20:47] to the tent said why did Sarah laugh how
[20:51] can these things be what was it Jesus
[20:54] said in St Luke

[46:25] after prayer this morning so God bless
[46:27] you this
[46:31] morning before we go to prayer I do have
[46:34] a couple things to to bring before you
[46:37] all
[46:42] um brother William well knows this is
[46:44] the uncomfortable part of Deacon in
[46:48] um timing is interesting since brother
[46:51] Wendell decided to spend time talking
[46:52] about a Deacon's responsibility on
[46:54] Wednesday um a couple verses that I'd
[46:57] like to read first um in Luke chapter
[47:01] 16 starting at verse 10 it says he that
[47:04] is faithful in that which is least is
[47:06] faithful also in much and he that is
[47:09] unjust in the least is unjust also in
[47:11] much if therefore you have not been
[47:13] faithful in the unrighteous Mammon who
[47:15] will commit to your trust the true
[47:17] riches and if you have not been faithful
[47:19] in that which is another man's who shall
[47:21] give you that which is your own 1
[47:23] Corinthians 4 and: 2 says moreover it is
[47:26] required in stewards that a man be found
[47:28] faithful and Colossians 3: 23 says and
[47:33] whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to
[47:35] the Lord and not unto
[47:38] men so this is really more for the
[47:41] parents um and I count myself among you
[47:46] um we've had a couple issues that uh I
[47:48] would ask all of you to uh be speaking
[47:51] with your children about um first thing
[47:54] is we've had uh some issues that have
[47:56] been going on in the uh in the women's
[48:00] bathroom um the uh cleaning crew going
[48:03] in behind has found um things smeared on
[48:06] the walls in some of the Stalls um and
[48:10] uh some things scratched or carved into
[48:12] the walls um I'm assuming from my side
[48:17] that this is going to be the younger
[48:18] children that are doing it if it's older
[48:20] children you know better on your own but
[48:23] we're going to assume it's the younger
[48:24] children and so
[48:26] I have zero desire to set forth any type
[48:29] of rules about what age a child needs to
[48:31] be before they can go to the bathroom on
[48:33] their own that is fully up to parents so
[48:36] please talk to your kids if you think
[48:39] that you need to escort them to the
[48:42] bathroom obviously if this doesn't
[48:44] improve then we might have to put in
[48:46] some type of rules and guidelines about
[48:48] that um but this is to me this is
[48:52] parents talk to your kids obviously my
[48:55] daughter will be be getting an earful
[48:56] from me um just to make clear um at the
[48:59] moment there is not an issue in the boys
[49:02] restroom but take the time to talk to
[49:04] the boys too let's remind them not to
[49:06] get anything started to start any
[49:08] problems like this um second concern
[49:11] that we've had um are uh and this one I
[49:16] will talk directly to all the kids um I
[49:18] know all of y'all love the candy after
[49:21] Services I'm sure that you don't want
[49:23] that to go away um but we've been having
[49:26] an issue with candy rappers left lying
[49:27] all around on the ground outside um our
[49:31] pastor has been here on days in the
[49:33] middle of the week where he's been
[49:35] coming through and been picking up all
[49:36] the rappers all over the ground which
[49:38] obviously that is not our pastor's
[49:40] responsibility um he needs to be focused
[49:43] on taking care of the flock not the
[49:46] building he needs to be taking care of
[49:48] preparing the sermons visiting the sick
[49:50] praying all those things he doesn't need
[49:52] to be picking up candy wrappers outside
[49:55] um and and so uh all of you kids throw
[49:59] away the candy wrappers stick them in
[50:00] your pocket to throw away later bring
[50:02] them inside and throw away at the trash
[50:04] can by the door um once again parents
[50:07] when you're having the other
[50:08] conversations if you will go ahead
[50:10] behind and have those same talks um
[50:14] obviously we want to be teaching them to
[50:17] be good stewards of everything that's
[50:18] been given to us um you know we've we
[50:22] have to believe that the Lord believes
[50:24] that we're good stewards cuz we've been
[50:25] entrusted with a new bus now that's come
[50:27] along um but at the same time that means
[50:29] that we still need to keep caring for
[50:32] what we do have and we need to be
[50:34] teaching our children to care for it and
[50:36] take responsibility for those
[50:39] things so once again we'll now go before
[50:42] the Lord in prayer if you all will bow
[50:44] your heads with
[50:46] me Lord Jesus we come into your presence
[50:48] this evening Lord
[50:50] and Lord I pray that first off Lord that
[50:54] you would take control of the service
[50:55] service today Lord that Lord this is
[50:57] it's never a comfortable time to go into
[50:59] these types of announcements and these
[51:01] types of things at the beginning of
[51:02] service Lord but Lord I pray that you
[51:04] would help all of us to have uh the
[51:07] right kind of attitudes Lord Jesus help
[51:09] us all to to be able to enter into the
[51:11] service Lord to to Worship You Lord

[1:26:20] Acts the 2 chapter
[1:26:23] in the first
[1:26:25] verse
[1:26:27] amen but when and when the day of
[1:26:30] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[1:26:33] with one Accord in one place somebody
[1:26:37] say one
[1:26:38] Accord in one place one and suddenly
[1:26:43] there came a sound from Heaven I
[1:26:46] remember the sermon that brother uh John
[1:26:49] preached here uh some time back on
[1:26:51] sudden ly amen suddenly there came a
[1:26:55] sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty
[1:26:58] Wind and it filled all the house where
[1:27:02] they were sitting and there appeared
[1:27:04] unto them clothing tongues of uh like as
[1:27:07] a fire and it sat upon each of them and
[1:27:11] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:14] and began to speak with other tongues
[1:27:16] and the as the spirit gave them
[1:27:18] utterance and there were dwelling at
[1:27:21] Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every
[1:27:24] nation under
[1:27:26] heaven now when this was noised abroad
[1:27:28] the multitude come together and were
[1:27:32] confounded because they that every man
[1:27:35] heard them speaking his own language and
[1:27:39] they were all amazed and marveled saying
[1:27:41] one to another behold are not all these
[1:27:45] which speak galileans how hear we every
[1:27:48] man in our own tongue wherein we were
[1:27:52] born May the Lord add a blessing to his
[1:27:55] the reading of his word God bless you
[1:27:57] you can be seated here
[1:27:59] today want to uh speak here this morning
[1:28:03] on living under the expectation of the
[1:28:08] supernatural um living under the
[1:28:11] expectation expectation is is an
[1:28:14] anticipation of something happening it's
[1:28:18] a confident belief or a strong hope that
[1:28:22] particular event will happen so amen it
[1:28:26] is a it is a hope it is a
[1:28:30] suspense there there is a am man an
[1:28:35] anticipation of something an awaited
[1:28:38] event and so we uh as we as we come in
[1:28:43] the presence of God I I think there
[1:28:45] should be uh there should always be an
[1:28:48] expectation an expectation of the
[1:28:50] supernatural amen amen when we come here
[1:28:53] in the house of God it should never be
[1:28:56] nonchalant it should never be uh uh
[1:28:59] another day at work or a amen a business
[1:29:03] as usual but where God is there's always
[1:29:06] the Supernatural is that not what the
[1:29:08] prophet's said where God is you can
[1:29:11] expect the supernatural amen and so uh I
[1:29:15] I I've thought of the awaited event a
[1:29:18] wedding is is one that has a lot of
[1:29:22] anticipation and and hours of
[1:29:25] preparation amen a lot of lot of sweat
[1:29:28] and pressure and tears and and anxieties
[1:29:32] and frustrations and last minute fixes
[1:29:36] amen that comes with a with a wedding
[1:29:39] and and you sisters know that a little
[1:29:41] bit more than us guys if amen all we
[1:29:43] want to do is kiss our girl and uh but U

[1:31:31] so there is a there is a sense of uh
[1:31:35] amen uh uh uh a duty amen there there's
[1:31:40] a sense there that is that that is h a a
[1:31:45] preparing amen getting things together
[1:31:48] uh making sure all the plans are there
[1:31:51] wait waiting for that event I I think of
[1:31:54] another one is amen the birth of a child
[1:31:57] amen when a when a baby's fixing to be
[1:31:59] born there's been a lot of preparation
[1:32:01] that that has been taking place casually
[1:32:05] amen as you're getting the baby bed out
[1:32:07] or you're amen and you're getting things
[1:32:10] together but as as the day begins to get
[1:32:13] a little closer and that that
[1:32:16] expectation of that child is is no
[1:32:19] longer months and weeks but it's now
[1:32:22] days and you're you're not just waiting
[1:32:25] casually but you are under amen a a a a
[1:32:30] great expectation when that baby is
[1:32:33] going to come I I think here today amen
[1:32:38] that we should never forget that that we
[1:32:42] must prepare for the presence of God
[1:32:46] Amen in the Old Testament times they
[1:32:49] amen the priest could not just come into
[1:32:53] the presence of God Amen but they had to
[1:32:56] prepare there was a something there was
[1:32:58] a certain protocol that that they had to
[1:33:02] follow there amen they had to be dressed
[1:33:04] right they had to be cleansed there was
[1:33:07] a certain
[1:33:09] process even with the lamb amen if you
[1:33:12] look there in Exodus 29 and 19 it says
[1:33:15] and thou shalt take the other RAM and
[1:33:18] and we're just breaking in here amen and
[1:33:20] Aaron and his son shall put their hands
[1:33:23] upon the head of the RAM and they shall
[1:33:25] kill the RAM and take of his blood and
[1:33:28] put it on the tip of the right ear of
[1:33:31] Aaron and on the tip of the right ear of
[1:33:33] his sons and upon the thumb of of their
[1:33:37] right hand and upon the great toe of
[1:33:40] their right foot and sprinkle the blood
[1:33:43] upon the altar round about and thou
[1:33:45] shalt take the blood that is upon the
[1:33:47] Altar and of the anointing oil and
[1:33:50] sprinkle it upon Aaron and upon his
[1:33:53] garments and upon his sons and upon the
[1:33:55] garments of his sons with him and he
[1:33:58] shall be hallowed and his garments and
[1:34:01] his sons and his and his sons garments

[1:44:15] time will he restore the faith of the
[1:44:18] children back to the faith of the
[1:44:19] fathers the original of the word you see
[1:44:23] that's where our faith R lies upon
[1:44:28] that's we're talking about a living God
[1:44:32] we're talking about the same Pillar of
[1:44:33] Fire I'm saying the same Pillar of Fire

[1:44:39] uh uh the picture was taken over the
[1:44:40] head of brother bradam amen you know

[1:44:52] depends on which one you're looking at
[1:44:55] Hallelujah I'm looking at the pillar of
[1:44:57] fire and yes yes yes yes that Pillar of
[1:45:01] Fire is returning this day well come on
[1:45:03] church I'm not worshiping a man it is
[1:45:06] the pillar of fire over that human being
[1:45:10] that brought this message unto me oh
[1:45:14] young people amen this is a young man's
[1:45:17] gospel this is a young woman's gospel
[1:45:19] there is some
[1:45:21] that'll bring reality can you say Amen

[1:45:31] take you into a
[1:45:36] Rapture Hallelujah is to take you into a
[1:45:39] Rapture now brother Brandon would tell
[1:45:41] us what this is doing amen he tells us
[1:45:45] he says now this brings you right back
[1:45:48] to the spoken word and then you are
[1:45:52] God's word made manifest Jesus said the
[1:45:55] same thing he that believeth on me the
[1:45:58] things that who I am and what I come for
[1:46:02] and the purpose I do to bring a man back
[1:46:06] to believe the word of God and to take
[1:46:09] nothing else with it the works that I do
[1:46:14] he will do
[1:46:18] also oh y'all ain't hearing me amen what
[1:46:21] no what is it what's the purpose of that
[1:46:23] Pillar of Fire what's that purpose of
[1:46:25] that Pillar of Fire it brings you back
[1:46:27] it brings the word back it it opens up
[1:46:30] the original word seed and you can take
[1:46:35] that word into your heart and it will
[1:46:39] Hallelujah if the Malachi 4 seed and the
[1:46:42] revelations 107 seed that was
[1:46:45] predestinated in William bram's heart
[1:46:48] and it came and produced everything
[1:46:50] thing the Bible said that it would
[1:46:52] produce if you can take that word amen
[1:46:55] into your heart and say as the elect of
[1:46:59] God my faith has been turned back and
[1:47:03] that book has been given to me and that
[1:47:07] Revelation is real in me then you can
[1:47:10] stand up and say I believe uh and I'm
[1:47:14] expecting and I shall see
[1:47:19] God
[1:47:22] can you say
[1:47:23] Amen the
[1:47:24] expectation he said now he that
[1:47:26] believeth on me who I
[1:47:29] am what I come for and the purpose I do
[1:47:34] to bring a man back to
[1:47:39] expecting to
[1:47:41] believe the word of God and take nothing
[1:47:44] else with it the works that I do shall
[1:47:48] he do also and and then brother brandom
[1:47:51] says there you
[1:47:53] are well shout
[1:47:56] hallelujah
[1:47:57] hallelujah this is not just a figment of
[1:48:00] man's imagination there is a reason that
[1:48:05] God sent us this
[1:48:07] Prophet amen now just believing that God
[1:48:10] sent a prophet ain't good enough Amen to
[1:48:13] have Brother bram's picture on the on
[1:48:15] the on your wall is not good enough but
[1:48:19] the pillar of fire in that picture if
[1:48:23] the god of William brandom is your God
[1:48:25] if the anointing of that word is your
[1:48:28] anointing then you can expect God in
[1:48:31] your
[1:48:33] life hallelujah amen I know there's a
[1:48:37] lot of people that might worship him but
[1:48:38] I'm here to tell you I'm worshiping the
[1:48:40] god of William Brandon and I'm believing
[1:48:42] the message that William brandham
[1:48:43] brought to
[1:48:47] us someone says well he got it a a lot
[1:48:50] of places but he missed it I choose to
[1:48:52] believe that God put that Pillar of Fire
[1:48:54] over his head because God was confident
[1:48:57] that that man that he predestinated was
[1:49:00] going to lead us into a
[1:49:02] Rapture he didn't say that I'm going to
[1:49:05] show up to the seventh angel messenger
[1:49:07] and to a few other teachers he says I've
[1:49:10] got one messenger and he is the teacher
[1:49:13] he is the one to take us into a Rapture
[1:49:16] and brother I'm expecting a Rapture I'm
[1:49:19] expecting the supernatural
[1:49:20] I'm expecting God to be with me I'm
[1:49:23] expecting God to heal I'm expecting God
[1:49:25] to deliver I'm expecting God to F with
[1:49:28] the Holy Ghost because that Prophet came
[1:49:31] with thus sayith the
[1:49:37] Lord can you say
[1:49:39] Amen
[1:49:41] now it's the
[1:49:43] womb of the church that holds the
[1:49:46] seed and when the seed is within that
[1:49:51] womb it begins to
[1:49:53] create an expectation that's
[1:49:57] right but glory to God now when you're
[1:50:00] first pregnant anybody can say well you
[1:50:04] know say well I got the strip and it
[1:50:07] says I'm pregnant but I I need to go
[1:50:10] don't tell nobody yet don't tell nobody
[1:50:12] because I got to go see it from the
[1:50:13] doctor first and and they and they want
[1:50:17] to keep it secret I know I know some
[1:50:19] want to keep keep it secret I don't want
[1:50:21] him to know that I'm having my 10th
[1:50:23] child so I just want this to be a secret
[1:50:27] amen but after a while
[1:50:32] amen after a while the
[1:50:36] expectation after a while there is a
[1:50:40] declaration that something has taken
[1:50:43] place in the womb of that Mama that she
[1:50:47] can't deny it anymore she can't I I I'm
[1:50:49] I'm here to tell you I have got I am
[1:50:51] past Pentecost I am past humanistic
[1:50:54] ideas I'm a p Hallelujah I am past your
[1:50:57] opinions I am past amen what this one
[1:51:00] thinks or what that big preacher thinks
[1:51:02] I am past I have sealed the word of God
[1:51:06] in the womb of my heart I have no room
[1:51:09] for nothing else but thus sayith the
[1:51:13] Lord I have no room oh church I'm expec
[1:51:20] thing to give birth to that Supernatural
[1:51:23] word it is within
[1:51:29] me can you see man now Pentecost had to
[1:51:33] die in order for you to be married to

[2:07:55] purpose can you say
[2:07:58] amen glory to
[2:08:01] God now I remember when I was a kid I'll
[2:08:04] just tell y'all a story before I move on
[2:08:07] Amen my hair story wasn't in the
[2:08:09] notes and
[2:08:10] so I remember on the bus going to votch
[2:08:16] we were homeschooled I graduated at 16
[2:08:20] and um but I continued going to
[2:08:24] votek and uh we had to ride the bus for
[2:08:27] several miles from our little from
[2:08:30] sinina to
[2:08:33] Prior and um well I got known they they
[2:08:38] they would they would call me the
[2:08:40] preach well it wasn't that I was being a
[2:08:44] blabber mouth or anything like that it
[2:08:46] was just cuz I stuck to my
[2:08:49] myself uh quite a bit but they all
[2:08:52] started making fun and I remember a girl
[2:08:55] I would come over and try to sit on the
[2:08:57] front seat and that way I wouldn't have
[2:08:58] to worry about any other nonsense in the
[2:09:00] back a man I me the guys try to smoke
[2:09:02] cigarettes and try to do things and the
[2:09:04] and the bus driver was you know he would
[2:09:07] pull over and back then he could knock
[2:09:09] heads together can't do that today but
[2:09:12] and uh so I remember girls coming up I
[2:09:15] remember one girl especially trying to
[2:09:16] get my attention and asked me to her
[2:09:18] well she had her uh she had a mini skirt
[2:09:21] on and had her legs up there on my seat
[2:09:23] and so when I turned her around I mean
[2:09:25] Hallelujah and uh we're not Hallelujah
[2:09:29] Lord help me Jesus not hallelujah amen
[2:09:32] and so I I I'm looking and I'm and I'm
[2:09:36] I'm thinking how how disgusting and so I
[2:09:38] turn around and one boy came up during
[2:09:43] the during that year and he said what's
[2:09:46] different about you
[2:09:49] and I said 'well I know the Lord I'm a
[2:09:51] Christian and he said
[2:09:54] uh I I I want to be a
[2:09:57] Christian and I said you want to be a
[2:09:59] Christian I said well we can pray right
[2:10:01] here all you have to do is repent and
[2:10:04] ask the Lord to forgive you of your
[2:10:06] sins he said I'll do that well I was
[2:10:11] going to just take his hand and we were
[2:10:12] going to pray on the bus right he got
[2:10:15] down on the floor he knelt down on the
[2:10:17] on the floor
[2:10:19] and I led him through a sinner's prayer
[2:10:22] and he become my buddy and he
[2:10:24] says can I go to church with you and I
[2:10:26] said
[2:10:27] sure and I remember as 16 17 year old
[2:10:32] boy dad let me help him baptize him as a
[2:10:37] kid baptize that boy that I had led to
[2:10:42] the
[2:10:43] Lord and it was because of that others
[2:10:46] begin to ask questions and begin to to
[2:10:48] see what and and the reason I'm
[2:10:50] sidetracked here is because you have a
[2:10:54] purpose I I think how many's been
[2:10:56] enjoying the Wednesday
[2:10:57] nights it's not the preacher the the
[2:11:01] anointing is upon the bride the oneman
[2:11:05] ministry William brandham was the
[2:11:08] prophet to this age there can never be
[2:11:11] another Prophet we must line ourselves
[2:11:14] up with the message that was given only
[2:11:18] to that seventh angel messenger is that
[2:11:20] now what the scripture says unto the
[2:11:22] angel of Leota write these things then
[2:11:26] the leoan messenger now he's got that
[2:11:30] message he is delivering the message but
[2:11:32] once the message is delivered it's no
[2:11:36] longer in him it's now in you you you
[2:11:39] you you you you you you
[2:11:42] you it's no longer in the seventh angel
[2:11:46] messenger it is now now in the body of
[2:11:50] the
[2:11:52] Bride brother brenon would put it this
[2:11:54] way he would say Moses was God to the
[2:11:59] people he says he would come and the
[2:12:02] light the anointing would be upon him
[2:12:05] and it would shine until he have to put
[2:12:06] a veil over his face because the people
[2:12:09] were scared he says and then once he
[2:12:12] brought the word of the Lord to the
[2:12:15] people then he could take the veil back
[2:12:17] off
[2:12:18] because his glow was no longer there he
[2:12:20] says it was no longer in the prophet
[2:12:23] Moses now it's been delivered to the
[2:12:29] people when God gives us a messenger
[2:12:33] he's not up there to make himself look
[2:12:35] good he's given you the

[2:32:14] across through a bunch of cattle and she
[2:32:17] was afraid of cattle but he
[2:32:20] said but she said
[2:32:22] Levi I've just got to have a drink of
[2:32:25] water so he stopped the car and said
[2:32:28] before he could even get the car hardly
[2:32:30] stopped She Was Out and
[2:32:32] and and had that cutting across the
[2:32:35] fence and she had to have
[2:32:38] water and when God becomes that real to
[2:32:45] you
[2:32:50] when you start thirsting like
[2:32:52] that that it's either God or you'll
[2:32:56] die you can't stand it any longer than
[2:32:59] something's going to
[2:33:03] happen you get to
[2:33:05] business then with
[2:33:08] God and that's when it takes
[2:33:13] place I've got to have you or I die
[2:33:19] I've got to have a drink of that
[2:33:21] Supernatural
[2:33:23] because I'm a human we all know we're
[2:33:26] humans we all comb our hair we all go to
[2:33:29] work we're
[2:33:32] humans we got our jobs we got our we got
[2:33:35] our families we go to
[2:33:42] school but inside that body of yours is
[2:33:45] a predestination need it's
[2:33:48] so and it's
[2:33:51] thirsty it's longing for
[2:33:54] God it's
[2:33:56] thirsty it's got something it's
[2:34:00] craving you try it to satisfy it with
[2:34:03] pleasures and drown it
[2:34:05] out with your games and try to drown it
[2:34:08] out with your
[2:34:12] things but after a while you just get so
[2:34:15] thirsty
[2:34:21] you've got to have
[2:34:28] God after a while you can feel thirsty
[2:34:30] you've got to have the Holy Ghost or
[2:34:33] die you can't just go to church you
[2:34:35] can't just listen to a tape anymore
[2:34:36] that's church is fine listening to tape
[2:34:39] is good but to an unregenerated heart it
[2:34:41] means
[2:34:43] nothing even though that heart is
[2:34:45] predestinated
[2:34:48] ated Moses was born with a purpose
[2:34:51] predestinated to be a
[2:34:55] prophet but when he took a when he
[2:34:57] killed that Egyptian because of that
[2:35:00] something on the inside of him and then
[2:35:01] he ran away the prophet of God says 40
[2:35:03] years later Moses had already forgot
[2:35:07] about Egypt about being a deliverer it
[2:35:10] was not in him but when that came when
[2:35:13] that came real when that reality came
[2:35:15] down into h him at the burning bush
[2:35:17] there was nothing that was going to take
[2:35:18] it out of him
[2:35:21] anymore are you hearing
[2:35:23] me
[2:35:26] hungry are you thirsty for
[2:35:34] God I know he's
[2:35:37] near the Apostle Paul says fill after
[2:35:39] him while he is near reach
[2:35:41] him while he can be
[2:35:44] found he's not
[2:35:48] in no one could see the light except for
[2:35:50] when God allowed the picture to be
[2:35:53] taken but we knew the light was present
[2:35:55] because that Prophet was a had a
[2:35:59] transmitter to see in that other realm
[2:36:01] he seen the light the vision came before
[2:36:04] him it was just like seeing me seeing
[2:36:08] you he simply told what he
[2:36:11] saw you and I aren't prophets we can't
[2:36:14] see it
[2:36:17] but the prophet has already declared
[2:36:19] that he's
[2:36:21] here so we can live under
[2:36:26] expectation I'm not leaving until I get
[2:36:31] it I I'm not turning around until I get
[2:36:34] it I am going I
[2:36:38] must get something to drink if the
[2:36:40] musicians would
[2:36:44] come living under
[2:36:58] expectation Moses or
[2:37:02] Elijah he repaired the altar he told him
[2:37:05] to
[2:37:07] dig around with the
[2:37:10] trench put Barrel after barrel of water
[2:37:13] over the sacrifice and over I mean he
[2:37:15] made it
[2:37:18] and then he comes and kneels down before
[2:37:19] the Lord and says I've done all of this
[2:37:22] at your command I follow the
[2:37:27] vision I know what's going to happen
[2:37:29] next Let the Fire
[2:37:34] Fall the prophet has rebuilt the
[2:37:38] altar brought the supernatural before
[2:37:44] us
[2:37:46] and he says the bride must
[2:37:49] expect the fire to
[2:37:51] fall The Rapture is in
[2:37:55] order the presence of God Among the
[2:37:57] people and in the
[2:37:58] [Music]
[2:38:00] people is the Cry of the
[2:38:07] day it means I can expect right there
[2:38:10] beside the
[2:38:11] prophet I didn't even have the
[2:38:14] vision but I know he
[2:38:17] did and he rebuilt The Altar and he said
[2:38:21] now you can expect the fire to
[2:38:27] fall that's just as good to me as seeing
[2:38:31] the vision myself the prophet has spoke
[2:38:34] it he's never been wrong I can AC I can
[2:38:38] accept those words and expect the
[2:38:41] promise to come to
[2:38:43] [Music]
[2:38:44] pass
[2:38:46] oh that makes my heart just want
[2:38:50] to do a couple of Skips and some Pitter
[2:38:53] patters
[2:38:56] and it's an
[2:38:59] expectation are you
[2:39:06] thirsting are you feeling your hunger
[2:39:08] and your thirst with other
[2:39:13] things
[2:39:14] repent
[2:39:18] the Zeal of this age is
[2:39:24] repent if you're not where you need to
[2:39:28] be
[2:39:36] repent for God who was rich in
[2:39:40] Mercy for his great
[2:39:44] love has
[2:39:46] come to this
[2:39:52] age so that you could see clearly the
[2:39:56] path and there is still a
[2:39:59] lamb that is still
[2:40:01] bleeding there's plenty of
[2:40:04] blood you say brother Wendell I I I I
[2:40:08] I'm a backslider there's still plenty of
[2:40:10] Blood Brother W I've done some pretty
[2:40:12] bad things there's plenty of
[2:40:14] blood
[2:40:16] the elect of God will never exhaust the
[2:40:19] blood of Jesus
[2:40:22] Christ are you hearing
[2:40:26] me don't let anything keep you from a
[2:40:30] genuine repentance in your heart if you
[2:40:33] have
[2:40:35] failed come back to
[2:40:37] God don't leave don't step there in in
[2:40:40] condemnation don't sit there in in in
[2:40:43] well I get get get get out of
[2:40:48] this and let your soul begin to
[2:40:54] thrive and the only way that you can
[2:40:56] start
[2:40:57] expecting is to have all of your sins
[2:41:00] washed
[2:41:01] away the only way that you're going to
[2:41:03] be able to truly
[2:41:07] expect is when your heart isn't
[2:41:09] condemning
[2:41:10] you and everything between you and God
[2:41:12] is made
[2:41:14] right and you and stand up and say
[2:41:17] Satan I'm here with a
[2:41:20] purpose if you're a young man or a young
[2:41:22] woman that needs the baptism of the Holy
[2:41:25] Ghost I hope that that cry gets so great
[2:41:29] in
[2:41:33] you I
[2:41:36] [Music]
[2:41:37] pray that the Holy Ghost would do
[2:41:40] something so
[2:41:41] real in this service tonight's service
[2:41:45] in the Youth Camp that is
[2:41:47] [Music]
[2:41:49] coming I remember my
[2:41:52] [Music]
[2:41:54] niece Hannah
[2:41:58] she was not just a real outgoing
[2:42:04] person just sort of shy and even had a
[2:42:07] few complexes you know great piano
[2:42:10] player great just a real
[2:42:13] Precious just a real Precious dog of
[2:42:18] God but I
[2:42:22] remember she said I want the Holy
[2:42:25] Ghost she said I'm going to go down to
[2:42:27] Louisiana camp and I want the Holy
[2:42:31] Ghost and when she went down to that
[2:42:33] Campground
[2:42:34] she she was one of the first in the
[2:42:36] services and she was always the last in
[2:42:38] the services and and she had been
[2:42:40] fasting that entire time all through
[2:42:42] Camp all of her friends
[2:42:47] they would they enjoyed the services but
[2:42:50] they weren't quite thirsting like she
[2:42:51] was
[2:42:53] thirsting she went to Captain for a
[2:42:58] reason first service came and gone
[2:43:02] second service came and
[2:43:06] gone and we had received a a text or a
[2:43:10] call or something and said pray for
[2:43:12] Hannah she's still not satisfied she
[2:43:15] wants the Holy
[2:43:16] Ghost we begin to pray we're all
[2:43:19] praying and I believe mom wasn't that
[2:43:21] the last
[2:43:25] service the last
[2:43:27] service Hannah had been fasting Thursday
[2:43:31] Friday Saturday Sunday went through six
[2:43:36] services and at the end of that last
[2:43:38] service she's there at the
[2:43:43] altar you promised me you'd fill me with
[2:43:46] the Holy
[2:43:47] Ghost and the
[2:43:49] glory of God came down upon
[2:43:56] Hannah and filled
[2:43:58] Hannah with the baptism of the Holy
[2:44:02] Ghost she was
[2:44:05] thirsting she was
[2:44:09] thirsting and it got to the point she
[2:44:11] didn't didn't care if she had to cry in
[2:44:13] the fence wait through cows and maneu
[2:44:17] she had to get to the
[2:44:19] well I
[2:44:23] see if you want it you got to want it
[2:44:25] more than you want
[2:44:27] it you got get more more than you want
[2:44:30] to play drums or guitar piano singing a
[2:44:34] choir you got to want it more than
[2:44:36] playing basketball with your friends you
[2:44:38] got to want it more
[2:44:39] than having a business got to want more
[2:44:43] than preaching a sermon
[2:44:48] [Music]
[2:44:50] if you're thirsty there's a reason
[2:44:52] you're thirsty because your body is made
[2:44:54] up of water when you get dehydrated you
[2:44:58] got to have some thirst your mouth gets
[2:45:00] parched your lips will crack your tongue
[2:45:03] gets thick I've been
[2:45:07] thirsty can't hardly swallow anymore you
[2:45:09] feel like you're going to swallow your
[2:45:12] tongue but when you get the water it
[2:45:15] quenches The Thirst and on the inside of
[2:45:18] that predestinated Soul there's
[2:45:19] something that no one nothing else can
[2:45:21] feel but God nothing else can fulfill
[2:45:24] that
[2:45:26] desire I can't pump you up I can't give
[2:45:29] you desire either you got it or you
[2:45:32] don't if you've got something in here
[2:45:34] that is craving and you've tried it here
[2:45:37] and you've tried it there and you still
[2:45:40] end up empty and dirty
[2:45:42] and if you've got the craving
[2:45:48] there's more of God to be
[2:45:52] [Music]
[2:45:53] had why does the
[2:45:56] chicken not look up to the sky and just
[2:45:59] sit there and dream about flying he's
[2:46:01] got his head down
[2:46:04] pecking but why does the eagle in the
[2:46:07] chicken pin hatched under the egg or
[2:46:10] hatched under the H why was his heart
[2:46:12] always looking
[2:46:14] up
[2:46:18] chickens don't soar in the sky as Eagles
[2:46:22] do and because there was a cry in the
[2:46:25] heart of the eagle saying I want to go
[2:46:28] to the
[2:46:29] heavens God sent mama up to him and said
[2:46:32] Come On Son you're not a
[2:46:34] chicken and when he heard the Cry of
[2:46:37] Mama
[2:46:39] screaming and he looked up and saw that
[2:46:42] great Majestic
[2:46:44] bird chickens didn't see it chickens
[2:46:47] didn't
[2:46:49] hear Mama screaming like that and
[2:46:51] getting too close those chickens go to
[2:46:53] the
[2:46:54] CPE they're going to
[2:46:58] hide
[2:47:01] eagland you heard Mama saying come
[2:47:03] on come
