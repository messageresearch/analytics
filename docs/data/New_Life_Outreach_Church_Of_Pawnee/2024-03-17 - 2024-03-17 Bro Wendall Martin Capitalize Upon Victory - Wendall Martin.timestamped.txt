[39:16] means to gain further advantage of it
[39:21] means to build upon the
[39:24] victory that has been gained
[39:28] and so when we talk about
[39:30] capitalizing amen we're thankful for
[39:33] what God has done amen but we want to
[39:37] keep the victory after the meeting and
[39:39] we want to add to and so I thought we
[39:42] would just uh just speak on this simple
[39:44] thought here this morning amen as as we
[39:49] uh are thinking uh the Lord thanking the
[39:51] lord for what he has done for us in
[39:54] these meetings and I'm sure as we had
[39:56] the testim the other night amen the Lord
[39:59] has been truly truly been good to us we
[40:02] didn't even get to everyone that wanted
[40:04] to testify or that could have testified
[40:07] but the Lord has been good to us amen
[40:11] and and uh so we're but we're not
[40:13] wanting to just uh have uh uh thank God
[40:16] for a meeting ped we're not wanting to
[40:19] just have victories of Amen thank God
[40:22] for the victories but we want to build
[40:25] upon what God has given us in other
[40:28] words we we don't want to just receive
[40:31] something from the Lord only for the
[40:33] devil to take it away from us in 3
[40:34] months amen we don't want to receive
[40:37] something but we every Victory we got
[40:40] every Victory we get we want to keep
[40:43] that Victory and keep marching on and
[40:46] building upon what God has given us now
[40:49] building isn't going to be easy amen
[40:52] building isn't fast but when the when
[40:54] you're steady with what you doing than
[40:58] God Amen uh then then you will gain
[41:01] ground now Satan has capitalized on our
[41:04] mistakes for uh for for many years he
[41:08] capitalizes on your mistakes he he trips
[41:11] you up and then he when he gets the
[41:13] advantage of you then amen he finds your
[41:16] weaknesses and he just goes to work and
[41:18] he and it's steady steady steady steady
[41:21] and he's gnawing and he's getting and
[41:23] he's knowing and he's and he's not he's
[41:25] not necessarily amen looking for great
[41:28] ground but he knows that if he can just
[41:30] get a little ground at a time amen
[41:34] eventually the little inch of a ground
[41:36] will become amen a a great big acres of
[41:40] land can you say amen and so the
[41:43] Believers got to have that same
[41:45] mentality I am gaining ground every day
[41:49] it might be inch by inch it might be
[41:51] little here little there amen but we
[41:54] must not St still we must not be Idol
[41:59] when we get Victory we have got to
[42:02] capitalize on that Victory I'm not going
[42:05] back and defeat but I'm going to
[42:08] continue on Amen and build upon what God
[42:12] has given us can you say amen amen you
[42:15] got to build upon it amen now I I I know

[42:22] kingdom was greatly Disturbed this last
[42:25] week amen and when you get into when you
[42:27] get into prayer and and God does things
[42:30] for you you disturb the kingdom of Satan
[42:34] amen but when you when you know that
[42:37] Satan is is is uh is Disturbed and he's
[42:40] upset that's not the time to give back
[42:44] or to to to step a foot back but we've
[42:47] got to press onward amen until the the
[42:52] the the total victory has come and we
[42:55] don't we know that the total vict iory
[42:57] will be our body change we know that

[43:12] say amen amen I I I I I'm thankful for
[43:15] that here this morning now I I as we as

[43:47] got to set our gates and we've got to
[43:50] amen change your routines if we have to
[43:53] and amen but we refuse to go back to the
[43:57] rut of defeat and we're going to March

[44:19] was U near uh uh where where the British
[44:23] and the the Persians uh defeated

[44:31] feared you know General and and he had
[44:35] went through there conquering many many
[44:38] many people matters of fact uh there are
[44:41] uh strategist War strategist that still

[45:08] uh uh some of these Kings and some of
[45:10] these men these countries these armies
[45:13] started standing against him and
[45:16] eventually they started he he begin to
[45:18] lose a war here and he begin to lose

[45:42] eight million that was slaughtered
[45:45] during uh these wars that Napoleon was
[45:48] bringing against he was just a brutal
[45:50] man amen but and and and there was great
[45:53] fear against about Napoleon but you see
[45:57] it it took a country to begin to defeat

[47:59] and this is right before he passed away
[48:01] 12565 he says this is the day of
[48:03] salvation where God is calling men from
[48:07] the world from a life of sin to a life
[48:11] so it's not just calling us from sin
[48:13] he's not just bringing Victory but he's
[48:16] calling you and me to a life of service
[48:20] in other words we can't just sit back
[48:23] and let God uh uh and and depend on God
[48:26] to defeat the Devil for us amen we've
[48:29] got to realize that he's got to use
[48:32] bodies he's got to use vessels he's got
[48:34] to use boys and girls men and women
[48:37] there is there is a service that we must
[48:40] do the devil will not be defeated except
[48:44] by human beings amen you you see Satan
[48:48] come against the the human being he come
[48:51] against Adam and Eve Adam was given the
[48:54] authority over the Earth Satan came
[48:56] directly to deal with Adam and Eve
[48:59] because he was trying to take the
[49:02] possession of the earth well we know
[49:04] that he wanton we know they defeated him
[49:06] but you see through the new birth and
[49:09] through the power of the blood God's
[49:11] called you and me not just to stand back
[49:15] and ask him for victory but we have been
[49:18] given Victory so that we can defeat the
[49:22] enemy any place any time under any
[49:26] condition he's calling you and me can
[49:29] you say amen Amen brother brand would go
[49:31] on and say I'm thankful for the doors
[49:33] that are open I'm thankful that these
[49:35] young men can take this message and
[49:39] sweep it on to the coming of the Lord
[49:42] you see Satan hates the spirit of God
[49:45] and so he comes to try to stop the
[49:49] vessels in which the spirit of God
[49:51] dwells in amen now I I I want you to
[49:55] understand that amen brother Timothy you
[49:57] know he he how many enjoyed brother
[49:59] Timothy's preaching this last week amen
[50:02] but the devil fought him and amen he got
[50:05] he just got so sick couldn't even make
[50:07] it to their Wednesday night service amen
[50:09] why Satan trying to stop the vessel in
[50:12] which the victory comes amen you you
[50:15] don't you don't think that brother uh uh
[50:17] brother Andrew Clover isn't fought when
[50:20] he stands up there Wheeling that sword
[50:22] against the enemy so that you can be
[50:24] free amen Satan hates the vessels amen
[50:28] that the that the spirit of God is
[50:30] flowing through and he's going to fight
[50:33] he's going to fight but these men have
[50:35] to stand up and say no you're not taking
[50:38] ground from me I'm anointed to bring
[50:42] Victory and I want to say today amen
[50:45] that God's raising up you men and women
[50:48] that are standing up today and say no
[50:50] you're not taking Victory from me I am
[50:54] possessing everything that God says for
[50:57] me to possess can you say amen amen
[51:00] there in 2 Timothy 2 and3 it says Thou
[51:04] therefore endure hardness as a good
[51:07] soldier of Jesus Christ somebody say
[51:09] endure hardness amen that means the
[51:12] enemy is going to fight you that means
[51:14] the enemy is going to keep on nagging at
[51:16] you but if God's giving you the victory
[51:19] then stand your ground and don't you let
[51:22] the devil come back and take one inch
[51:24] from
[51:25] you amen he says no man that in that
[51:29] Warth entangleth themselves with the
[51:31] Affairs of this life that he may please
[51:34] him who had chosen him to be a soldier
[51:37] can you say Amen you're going to be
[51:40] withstood in every direction that you
[51:43] turn just because God's given you the
[51:46] land amen reminds me of Israel when
[51:48] they're in nehemiah's day when they
[51:51] returned from captivity now they had
[51:52] been in captivity for many many years I
[51:56] believe amen 70 years and so they were
[51:59] given favor by God Amen and and and and
[52:02] was actually amen given the authority to
[52:05] go back to Jerusalem but what happened
[52:08] was when Nehemiah come down and looked
[52:11] at the people he found that the people
[52:14] were living amen and the people of Judah
[52:17] were living in a city without walls
[52:20] without Gates they were poor they had
[52:24] nothing they were living
[52:27] like ppers when God had restored them
[52:31] back oh come on church amen yes they
[52:34] were Jews but you see the city of God
[52:37] was in vain was in Ruins amen there they
[52:40] were popers living in dilapidated homes
[52:44] living without victory yes they were
[52:47] back at home but they were in amen a
[52:52] chaos amen no walls for protection the
[52:55] enemy was living among the rubble the
[52:58] Bible says and you see Satan was sitting
[53:01] there enjoying every bit of
[53:05] it now the sad thing is is Israel begin
[53:09] to accept that as the way of
[53:11] life Israel says at least we're not
[53:15] under the dictates of Babylon anymore
[53:18] amen now they're living in the rubble
[53:21] their homes were in shambles amen are
[53:25] y'all hearing me you see they received
[53:29] Victory but they were not
[53:31] capitalizing on that
[53:34] Victory they just become complacent why
[53:37] because I'm going to tell you to go back
[53:38] and start rebuilding to stand up and
[53:41] rebuilding what God's G Hallelujah I'm
[53:44] thankful for what God done for me in
[53:45] that prayer line I'm thankful for what
[53:48] God done Amen in those services but
[53:51] brother I am going to capitalize on the
[53:55] victory and I'm going to build what God
[53:59] has called me to
[54:01] be well God delivered me from
[54:03] pornography you say well God's delivered
[54:05] me from Habits God's delivered that's
[54:07] wonderful amen now you can fulfill your
[54:12] purpose your purpose on Earth was not to
[54:15] be delivered from pornography your
[54:17] purpose on Earth was not to be delivered
[54:19] from Habits or not to be amen your
[54:21] purpose on Earth was to rule and reign
[54:25] in Christ Christ Jesus amen come on
[54:29] Church you pray and your prayers are
[54:32] answered to have a faith amen and bring
[54:34] about the supernatural presence of God
[54:37] that is what you're called for amen so
[54:40] many times we think amen we're just amen
[54:43] we're satisfied with just deliverance
[54:44] and we're satisfied amen for God coming
[54:47] down and touching us in a service amen
[54:49] oh my goodness that's not your purpose
[54:52] amen God sends a preacher your way and
[54:55] God sends the War of the Holy Spirit to
[54:58] break the yolks and the chains off of
[55:00] you so that you can fulfill your purpose
[55:06] we've got to capitalize on the victories
[55:09] that God gives
[55:12] us can you say
[55:14] Amen now Israel just accepted God given
[55:17] me Victory and now they're living in
[55:20] Jerusalem amen they're poor the city of
[55:24] God is in Ruins amen amen now amen they
[55:28] just accept it as the way of life and
[55:31] resign themselves to just deal with what
[55:34] they had and the sad thing is they
[55:37] become satisfied that's right all right
[55:41] satisfied I'm going to tell you
[55:42] something you can't you you can't become
[55:44] satisfied because Satan ain't satisfied
[55:47] until he's got you killed that's right
[55:50] Satan's not satisfied until he's got you
[55:52] totally destroyed come on church you've
[55:55] got to build those
[55:59] walls now now here the people of God
[56:03] were they were living in the ashes of
[56:05] God's City yes they were delivered from
[56:09] bondage but Judah I I I I'm going to
[56:12] stress it to you Judah was
[56:15] satisfied living in the
[56:17] rubble amen if only those broken walls
[56:21] could talk I thought many of times if
[56:23] those Broken Walls that had been broken
[56:25] down if they could only talk of the
[56:26] victories that had been that had taken
[56:29] place and amen the enemies that those
[56:31] walls had held out in the past and amen
[56:34] if those broken down walls could talk oh
[56:36] my just victory after Victory after
[56:39] victory that God had brought in the past
[56:42] come on church amen but in this last day
[56:45] God sent us a amen a prophet in the day
[56:48] to raise up those Hallelujah this is not
[56:52] a god of yesterday we're not serving a
[56:54] god of yesterday we don't belong in the
[56:57] ashes and the rebel of Christianity we
[57:00] are to rise under the power and the
[57:03] anointing of the Holy Ghost and we are
[57:06] to cast out devils and we are to heal
[57:09] the sick and we are to raise the Dead
[57:11] the power of God is to be in this
[57:16] church and I will not be satisfied until
[57:21] every one of us arising in the power and
[57:25] the anointing of the Holy Ghost that's
[57:27] why God Set Me Free that's why God came
[57:30] in the camp meeting that's why God deals
[57:33] is to anoint you to defeat that
[57:37] enemy that's right
[57:40] amen
[57:43] now with Broken
[57:46] Walls
[57:47] comes
[57:50] intimidation with Broken
[57:55] Walls you are
[57:57] intimidated by the enemy all
[58:02] around you've got your
[58:06] Victory but you have no
[58:09] protection so
[58:11] now man it's just a matter of time
[58:14] you're having a hide because you know
[58:16] that the enemy can come in and take you
[58:18] right back captive that's right amen can
[58:21] you say Amen the Bible says that they
[58:24] were mocked by the moabs
[58:26] the moabites they were mocked by the
[58:30] ammonites they were mocked by the
[58:33] Arabians these guys were mocking them
[58:36] and when Nehemiah came
[58:38] in man Nehemiah was
[58:42] upset Nehemiah says God's given you
[58:47] Victory and you're living
[58:49] here in the
[58:52] rubble is this what God's called you to
[58:55] do
[58:57] are you satisfied with this what can you
[59:00] say man and the people answered them
[59:03] back him back we're
[59:06] poor we have nothing to build
[59:09] with we have nothing we have we have
[59:13] nothing no Scholars we have no tools we
[59:17] have nothing and the Bible says that
[59:21] Nehemiah rallied the people around the
[59:23] cause and he be to express to the people
[59:26] people do you realize who you
[59:30] are do you
[59:32] realize who's
[59:35] God who who God called you to be yeah
[59:39] come on do you
[59:41] realize that you're the favored ones
[59:43] over the all of the earth that God's
[59:47] hand has called Abraham and separated
[59:50] you to himself do you realize that even
[59:54] in the impossible abilities the
[59:57] anointing is upon you to build those
[1:00:00] walls oh come on church amen and as he
[1:00:04] begin to express to them amen and they
[1:00:07] begin to reply we are as prey and amen
[1:00:11] and and and and they're going back and
[1:00:13] forth but but but but you see it was
[1:00:16] Nehemiah that stood there and pointed to
[1:00:19] his commission from the King he he
[1:00:21] brought out the letter amen and he says
[1:00:24] I've been given a commission from the
[1:00:26] the king that you are to build those
[1:00:29] walls I've got a letter from the King
[1:00:33] giving you authority to set those Gates
[1:00:36] I've been given you amen I've been given
[1:00:39] a commission to declare unto you that
[1:00:43] you have a right not to just survive but
[1:00:46] you have a right to build that City and
[1:00:51] to protect yours well praise the Lord I
[1:00:54] just want to say it was our Nehemiah in
[1:00:56] this day that is still screaming out
[1:00:59] today you've got a right to
[1:01:03] build that's right can you say
[1:01:07] Amen
[1:01:09] now the king willingly granted the
[1:01:12] request and amen we know the story and
[1:01:15] I'm not going to stay on it long amen
[1:01:20] but when the people found that the King
[1:01:22] was behind the
[1:01:24] Endeavor that it was just not an idea
[1:01:27] that Nehemiah had concocted youen but
[1:01:31] the king had authorized him to build the
[1:01:34] city the Bible says they begin to
[1:01:36] strengthen their
[1:01:37] hands and I want us to look here
[1:01:40] today and in as as we
[1:01:43] see man the enemy you say well a lot of
[1:01:45] people sick somebody brought sickness to
[1:01:48] the campgrounds this last week and I I

[1:02:11] sand balot and there was another man by
[1:02:13] the name of
[1:02:14] tayah that despised Israel and when
[1:02:17] Israel begin to build the ground or
[1:02:19] begin to build the walls they they as
[1:02:21] they begin to take courage and they
[1:02:24] begin to build and and and to rebuild
[1:02:27] the Bible says that sand ballot and toah
[1:02:30] were right there on them amen and just
[1:02:35] constantly amen there in Nehemiah the 2
[1:02:37] chapter in the 19th verse it says but

[1:02:49] to scorn despised us and said what is
[1:02:53] this thing that you do will you rebel
[1:02:56] against the king then answered I unto
[1:02:59] them and said unto them the god of
[1:03:03] Heaven he will prosper us therefore we

[1:03:34] today I want you to pick up your
[1:03:36] trial and get to building the
[1:03:39] walls I'm worthy of everything God says

[1:03:45] everything that God promised to this
[1:03:48] church has been promise and God will
[1:03:51] fulfill it in me I don't have the
[1:03:53] ability I don't have the wherewith but
[1:03:55] the anointing of the king is upon me

[1:16:30] change amen there we see Cain persecuted
[1:16:33] and killed Abel because the latter
[1:16:35] pleased God then we see a perfect
[1:16:38] picture in Abraham son of the flesh ish
[1:16:41] who teased and fought the son of Promise
[1:16:44] Isaac there was uh Esau who hated Jacob
[1:16:49] and would have killed him if God had not
[1:16:51] intervene in the New Testament we find
[1:16:54] Judas betraying Jesus while the
[1:16:56] religious hoarders of the first century
[1:16:58] attempted to to destroy the early
[1:17:00] Believers the children of this world

[1:17:22] Miracles and he will be condemned the
[1:17:24] the spirit of this world hates the
[1:17:27] spirit of God and because it cannot
[1:17:30] somebody say it cannot overcome the
[1:17:34] spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy
[1:17:38] the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth
[1:17:41] veils amen persecutions and trials are a
[1:17:44] natural normal part of Christian Life

[1:30:22] matter that's the trouble of it it's
[1:30:25] more sin not to do than it is to do when
[1:30:30] you know
[1:30:33] better I know I should be praying I know
[1:30:37] I should be dedicating I know I should
[1:30:39] be reading my Bible every day because
[1:30:41] all Christians read the read and pray
[1:30:43] every
[1:30:46] day it's more sin not to do than it is
[1:30:51] to do when you know better that's right
[1:30:54] he that knoweth to do good and doeth it
[1:30:56] not to him at is
[1:30:57] sin you got to make ready doing nothing
[1:31:02] is worst thing you can do do nothing
[1:31:05] about it you Southerners remember your
[1:31:08] history went up here when Grant was
[1:31:11] sitting just across the
[1:31:13] river and he had a boy out there on
[1:31:15] guard Duty and the rebels across the
[1:31:18] river and this boy walking along there
[1:31:20] kind of Dazed around with the dreams of
[1:31:22] his sweetheart he had left his post of
[1:31:26] Duty and went down to pick some violets
[1:31:29] to send to his
[1:31:30] sweetheart he didn't mean to do
[1:31:33] wrong he went then at that time there
[1:31:36] was a spy that was ready from the
[1:31:40] southern Army and they slipped in and
[1:31:43] they looked around they found out that
[1:31:46] the southern Army was two or three times
[1:31:48] the size of General
[1:31:50] GRS well what
[1:31:52] happened they the the boy come back on
[1:31:56] the post of Duty was not knowing what
[1:31:59] had happened but the Spy had already
[1:32:01] been there and what happened they
[1:32:03] stormed across the river drove them
[1:32:05] Plumb back up into the state and the boy
[1:32:09] was shot an hour later not because they
[1:32:12] didn't have no objection to him picking
[1:32:15] the violets they didn't it wasn't what
[1:32:18] he done it was the things he did not do
[1:32:24] he didn't stand to his post of Duty he
[1:32:27] didn't guard the post like he was
[1:32:29] supposed to and he spoiled the whole
[1:32:33] thing the responsibility lays at the
[1:32:37] Life Tabernacle and the other
[1:32:39] Tabernacles and churches in shreport
[1:32:40] Louisiana here God is here taking with a
[1:32:45] storm it ain't what you're
[1:32:47] doing than it is what you're failing to
[1:32:51] do let's do something about it
[1:32:54] let's dig with all of our hearts that

[1:33:06] can do then that's
[1:33:09] all that's

[1:33:21] wrong maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe
[1:33:24] there's maybe there's that internet
[1:33:26] maybe there's no sin going
[1:33:29] on but it's the
[1:33:32] thing that I'm failing to
[1:33:36] do it's the convictions of my heart or
[1:33:39] it's the things of God's word that I
[1:33:43] am not making it my priority and
[1:33:47] conviction his post of standing guard
[1:33:50] was
[1:33:51] important but he did not take make it
[1:33:54] important the general specifically put
