[Music] jur hallelujah how many can give him a hand clap of praise tonight amen amen we have him on record tonight telling us that he will never fail amen what a what an honor it is tonight to know that our lord Jesus has promised that he would be with us as I was with Moses he said so will I be with thee Joshua and a prophet of God come along and said he's right here with the church the same today as he was then and I tell you sometimes I I know we're all human here and we sometimes get to thinking about our lives and situations and it's one thing that's always astounded me that brother Bram said in the message as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee he said that Joshua had this comfort that he could look back and see all the mistakes Moses made but God never left him and he said if God never left Moses and all his mistakes then Joshua had that Comfort he'll never leave me in all of mine and amen that's a what a revelation friends that God has he's taken an oath with this church that he'll never leave you and he'll never forsake you he said I'll be with you always even Until the End Amen want to say God bless you all tonight and it is a real honor to be here with you again this weekend and I just pray something was said this morning to be a blessing to you and a help and amen an encouragement and amen you all uh just have to amen give us a little Grace sometimes the spirit of the Lord takes over and you just get to preach in a little bit and but I tell you there was a real Liberty here this morning and amen we do want to say we appreciate brother Wendell and his friendship and appreciate his stand for this word and appreciate what he means to the body of Christ and what he means to this local body and to you all as a church and amen we sure love and appreciate him and and his friendship and amen I was out there was riding around today and I got to thinking we're going to have to get back to them uh Pond hopping days amen we used to come out here and amen used to come out here and amen preach and amen next day or two go Pond hopping always had a wonderful time and sure love and appreciate you all and all of our friends here we say God bless you and amen appreciate brother Josh and his ministry and the Lord using him and I know he's been a real blessing to you all here in the assembly and Amen brother brother Josh has been a real friend to us and amen I think we've preached together and cried together and shouted together and amen just a real friend and we appreciate him and his family and sure glad to have my wife here in Malachi with us and also youall heard from Sister Destiny there and brother Benji had them with us God bless you all amen for those of you that don't know Sister Destiny's actually brother Wayne's niece so I know he's a dear friend of all of ours here and amen so we sure glad to have them here and maybe we go the word tonight if you have your Bibles for just a few moments we want to go to the Book of Psalms the 62nd chapter amen I I know it's a Sunday evening so amen we'll uh just take a few things here that's on her heart and pray it'll be a blessing to you and amen I told Brother Miguel in the back room I said you're a very gracious man haven't heard that sermon this morning twice so amen but amen I have to say he backed like he had never heard it so amen I got back here and I got to thanking man the Lord give me some of those things uh last year over in those meetings at brother Ben and brother Miguel and his family was there with us in the meeting and so we we sure appreciate you God bless you brother and your family amen Psalms chapter 62 and verse number five uh this is a very very familiar reading that David gives us here in Psalms 62 and5 he says my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation I love this he is my defense I shall not be moved in God is my salvation and my glory now listen what David says he says he is the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God how many knows that David actually was writing from not just a high point but many times in his life he was writing from a low point that actually God is my rock now you know the word Rock in the Bible brother BR picks it up and says Rock actually means Revelation so we could very easily say here that David is saying the revelation of my strength and my refuge is in God now in the Book of Proverbs just a book over I believe in Proverbs chapter 24 and verse number 13 Proverbs 24 and verse number 13 uh Solomon here writing he says this in Proverbs 24 and verse vers 13 He says my son eat thou honey because it is good and the honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy Soul when thou Hast found it then there shall be a reward now watch this and thy expectation shall not be cut off amen there there's going to come a reward to the expectation notice this unto thy soul and thy expectation shall not be cut off so in other words God does not have you expecting things but what he has the ability to bring an answer to the expectation one other place in Jeremiah chapter 20 uh it's a very very familiar reading I know we've probably been hearing this verse in Sunday school kids in Jeremiah chapter 20 and verse number n the Bible here says in Jeremiah 20 and9 then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name but listen what Jeremiah says but his word was in my heart as a burning fire and it was shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay amen notice this his word was in my heart as a burning fire and it was shut up in my bones amen from those verses tonight if I were to take a title I want to want to talk to you on this expectations lit by the message let's just bow our hearts together Heavenly Father Lord we are indeed grateful to be called your children Lord we're thankful for the faith that is in our hearts tonight to believe you and to trust you and Lord to be here tonight is such an honor in your presence Lord to be gathered together with Believers of like Precious Faith now Lord as we Endeavor to look into your word we invite the spirit of wisdom and Revelation into the building Lord may you drive out every SP that's unlike the Holy Spirit and Lord as we look at these things may quickening power come upon them oh God and Lord may they be made real realities to the hearts of your children forgive us of our failures and shortcomings Lord we are not just looking to be gathered together in church so we can say we've been there but Lord we're looking from an emus road walk tonight another Damascus Road where we would be transformed by your great Pillar of Fire move among us tonight we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory for Lord indeed we love you from the depths of our heart Lord we thank you for what you've sent in this generation and Lord we want to give our all to it we want to give everything we are to this great end time word that you've so graciously revealed to the hearts of your children feed the hungry hearted Eagles here tonight we pray in Jesus Christ's name and all the believer says amen amen God bless you you have your ceas tonight amen expectations lit by the message I I want tonight maybe to open by just making a couple comments to you here of some things that are very um special to my heart I want to say this about the message of the hour I believe the message of the hour amen has come by the Elijah amen that was promised and prophesied of Malachi 4 now I believe that this message has come amen for the purpose of putting you and I as Believers into an atmosphere of expectation I believe this message has come to grip us to move us to elect us amen to capture us to apprehend us Amen to select us to be a participant in the Rapture amen and in the resurrection now I'll say this the message of the hour has already come amen and it is here to set us in expectation for what God has promised us in his word now just to to lay a foundation here in 1953 brother Ram says I'll tell you what the church needs today amen is an oldtime Holy Ghost fire kindled under her amen fire will move the church and nothing else again he said seeing the Revival fires begin to dim Amen Let Us throw on the wood of the word that it might Kindle a new fire amen that our hearts would be full of zeal 1962 convinced and concerned he says what we need is lives amen lit what we need is lives lit a flame with the power and the resurrection of Christ amen shining forth the the same kind of light that he gave another place and just once more Lord he said send down a rain of God's holy fire amen Enlighten our souls Lord with the presence amen of Jesus Christ so here a prophet of God is saying Lord send down the holy fire from heaven amen that our souls might be lightened amen with the presence of Jesus Christ now you all know the Bible said that John actually he told them I indeed baptize you with water un repentance amen but he that cometh after me is mightier than I amen whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear now he shall baptize you with Holy Ghost and with fire so John was baptizing with water unto repentance amen but Jesus said when I come amen you will receive a baptism of Holy Ghost and Fire Paul comes along in Hebrews 12 and he says our God is a consuming fire somebody say well I want Jesus but I don't want his word am you can't have Jesus without having his word amen because they are the same and neither can you have the Holy Ghost without having fire amen because the Holy Ghost is the fire of God brother said see what God does is he cleanses His prophets by fire amen not by theology or some book of some kind amen but he cleans his people by fire that is Holy Ghost and Fire amen not by a declaration of Creeds or a book or something you've got to learn a bunch of Prayer amen but he cleans them by fire off of the altar amen that's how he sets him in order I find it very amazing that God cleans his people amen the same way he cleans His prophets amen he cleans His prophets by fire amen and he cleans his followers or his children the same way he cleans them by fire he said God does not cleanse by knowledge amen he cleans by fire he said getting a holy fire from heaven that takes the light off of your lips it takes the carnality out of you and it burns that stuff that draws to the world Amen and puts his presence in there amen and lives through that person amen so the Holy Fire of God Amen burns out everything in the temple of God that's unlike God that it could move in there and that you would actually become amen a direct reflection of the fire that's why Jesus said amen that you are the light of the world see you are a city that is set on a hill and it cannot be hid neither do men light a candle put it under a bushel amen but on a Candlestick that it giveth light unto all that are in the house he said now let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify amen your father which is in heaven how can good works amen come out of human beings that have been born in sin amen shaping in iniquity and come in the world speaking lies there's only one way that can happen church is there has to come a baptism of Holy Ghost and Fire Amen to remove the line from our lips amen the carnality from our nature amen the draws from our life that God Amen could inhabit himself in the temple and therefore we could be a direct reflection of him I love what the prophet of God says he said dear brother brandom do you believe that signs amen should follow all who have the Holy Spirit he said well Jesus said so in Mark chap 16 he said then if so amen what about the people who believe the message amen with all that's in them yet they have not these signs amen are they unbelievers or do they need the Holy Spirit he said if so please instruct us today on how to receive the Holy Ghost amen for we believe that you are God's mouthpiece for our day now he answers it and says you cannot receive amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost with without having an experience when it happens you cannot receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without having an experience when it happens you say well I believe every Speck of it he said the word is laying in there amen but it's waiting for the holy spirit amen to put it to work see but it takes the lighting of the candle amen so you are the candle that God is Desiring Amen to set on fire here's the candle with a wick in it with all the Tallow and everything it has to have in that candle but until the fire comes on it it will not shine any light he said no matter how perfect the candle is how perfect it'll burn and everything amen it's got to be Len and then it burns he said until the holy spirit with a fiery experience comes down amen and lights that candle then you haven't received the Holy Ghost listen folks we are not grandchildren unto God Amen we are children of God amen by a fiery experience of the Holy Ghost and Fire John said behold what manner of love amen the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called amen not the grandsons of God Amen but we should be called the sons of God Amen therefore the world knoweth us not amen because it knew him not brother comes along and thans it are to be and he says the only way you can be a son and a daughter of God is you have to have etal etal life see the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule he said and you are nothing amen but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God but now you are expressed after his word has come in you Amen to light up this age you are the expressing God's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of God see see what I mean you are now made you are sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God Amen to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate another place he said we have become from Mortal beings amen from time beans to Eternal beans when did this happen when the word of God lit our souls when the word of God lit our souls we become the Sons and Daughters of God with the attribute or the gene of God in us to be the Sons and Daughters of the father amen God in heaven crying amen AB by father listen folks we have not been set on fire by the music we have not been set on fire by a preacher we have not been set on fire by a gift amen listen we've not been set on fire by just the first pool or just the second pool but there was a third pool there was the opening of the word and that is what has led our souls amen and we are now on fire amen with a revelation of who we were Amen in God before there was one atom or one molecule and we are here on the earth tonight expressing him I love this word lit it means to provide with light or lighting it means to be illuminated to be ignited amen it means to be set on fire it means to be burning when something has been lit it has been ignited it has been set on fire and it is burning I love what Jesus says in John 11 he says I am the resurrection and the life see he that believeth in me amen though he were dead amen yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me amen shall never die amen believest thou this he said see you are in him amen and you are believing he said I chose this text tonight to show you where we stand amen we are believing in him now there's a big difference folks in believing in something and believing in something you say well that's the same thing actually it's not amen because there's many people that can drive by this church and they can look over here at this building and they can say I can believe in that church I believe in what they're doing amen but if you really believe in it amen you're not just driving by saying I believe in it the difference is you're actually in here believing in it see you're believing on him until you reach receive eternal life then the eternal life is God's life in you and you are believing in him see it's God in Christ and it's Christ in the church amen see it isn't you no more amen it's the word that's in you and the word is God see he that believeth in me not believeth on me amen but believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also he said why it's his life see it's his Dynamics and his mechanics that's in you that fires it off and makes it Go and Do The Works that it promised to do or my life in him hath quickened Me by his Spirit to make his word which is the mechanics amen work by the Dynamics I love what Paul says in Ephesians 1:18 he says that the eyes of your understanding would be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling what is the riches of the glory of the inheritance in the Saints look at this word enlightened it means to bring to light it means to cause something to exist amen and thus come to light and become clear to all who look upon it in Ephesians 3:8 Paul says unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles amen The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the the world hath been hid in God who created things by Jesus Christ who created All Things by Jesus Christ let me show you something here amen at one time no one could look upon this mystery at one time no one could see it but look what he says here he says in 2 Timothy 1:8 be thou not ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor me of his prisoner but be thou a partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel amen according to the power of God who has saved us and called us with a holy calling which is not according to our works amen but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus when before the world began amen this was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world ever began but is now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life immortality Amen to lie through the gospel in other words folks the mystery that was hidden in the mind of God is now revealed in the flesh of the Bride of Jesus Christ at one time it could not be seen at one time it could not be understood amen but tonight amen what was in God's mind amen is now in God's church and you are the expression of the attribute of the gene of God listen folks this message is more than just a book it's more than just a tape amen can I make an announcement to you it's the appearing of the Lord in our generation you say well the Lord is coming and sure he is but the prophet of God said there is an appearing of Jesus he said and there's a coming of Jesus he said now the appearing of the Lord is now when he is appearing among his people his spirit is working in them and proving that it's him with them amen getting them ready for the Rapture listen I know people say well amen you don't have to believe the message to go to heaven and I agree but if you're going in a Rapture amen you've got to have something that's going to put you in a condition Amen to take a Rapture amen and the Baptist Doctrine can't do it church amen the Pentecostal gifts can't do it it took the opening of the word it took the revealing of the son of man it took the Thundering of seven Thunders Amen to release an anointing from the word listen this message gripped you this re ation captured you this Revelation selected you listen it chose your body for the fulfilling of its promises in the age you're living in oh you can run but you can't hide amen you can run to the de deepest darkest desert but God will find you there David said if I make my bed in the belly of Hell amen he will find me because I am a part of the Covenant of God yes sir amen this is the appearing of the Lord what is his appearing doing it is getting them ready for the Rapture which is the coming of the Lord amen to catch away his bride amen I'll say this God sent us amen the message of the hour Amen to Enlighten the eyes of our understanding now I'll just say this the message of the hour amen it must be received as a Divine message Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 2:13 he says for this cause also we thank god without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which he heard of us you received it not as the word of man but as it is in truth the word of God now watch this which effectually worketh also in you that believe see the Bible says he that hath an ear Amen Let Him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches he said it may be that Millions will hear these words or will read them but how many will pay heed to them that we do not know but he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of truth amen will find the spirit of God enlightening him if your ear is open to the word then the spirit of God will make the word real to you amen and that is a work of the spirit he said I can teach you the truth but if you don't open your ear to hear it and your heart to receive it then you won't get the Revelation listen folks it's more than just Abracadabra abrao how make a Son of God out of you no it's the opening or the surrendering or the yielding of your ear and your heart to receive what is being spoken listen and somewhere amen between your head and your heart the Holy Ghost will get a hold of it and it'll become more than a good sermon it'll become more than a quo it'll become more than a cliche but the transforming power of God will take a Sunday night sermon and'll seek it into your heart and it'll become a revelation listen you are a part of the Church of the firstborn hell can come against it but there is nothing that can Prevail against this Revelation Hallelujah you say well I received the message well I'll just tell you this amen there's different degrees of reception I've been preaching since I was 13 been traveling around the world preaching since I was 16 amen I'll just say this I have preached in all kinds of churches and whether you believe it or not one of the hardest things I realized when I started preaching amen was not everybody believed what brother Bram said brother Austin that was the biggest shock to me you know amen cuz I've yet to find the Baptist that argue with what the Baptist Church believes about it I've yet to find a Methodist arguing or a Pentecostal about what their Church believes but I've been in message churches and they say we believe the message and and then I go in there and just start preaching and then all of a sudden we don't believe that and that was brother br's opinion you can't take this and leave that out and I found out amen there's different degrees of reception there are good Brothers amen the only reception they've given to this message is the fact that God sent a prophet amen there's other brothers who who have given the reception to the fact amen that there is a message and and we ought to study it amen there's brothers who Reed this message amen it's just a good idea but then there are those amen who have received this message as what it is listen it is the absolute Amen to this generation what level are you receiving this message at Amen to receive the full benefit of this message you've got to receive it at the same level that it's been sent to you at can I tell you what kind of message this is it's not an icicle message folks amen it's not an intellectual amen cold message amen this is a fiery message amen it has been birthed amen from the pillar of fire listen somebody say well our church is called I say just start preaching the message and if there's any fire in there to be lit this message begins to be preached it'll set a fire in that church listen folks I believe it's time Amen to let the fire of God Amen return to the church unhindered and unrestricted I say let it burn in the pull pits I say let it burn on the pews I say let it burn in our musicians I say let it burn in our singers let it burn in our young people let it burn in our deacons let it burn in our officers this is a fiery message it don't need nobody to correct it it just needs somebody that'll give it some room to burn like a house on fire in a windy day it's a fiery message and you cannot control fire it is a fiery it's a fiery message now I'll just say this in 1963 they told Brother random they said this he said now the people might say our church or our Brethren they say well the cooling off of the message the cooling off of the message and so forth but I love his politically correct answer he says it ain't cooled off a't that good sister Angie it ain't cooled off they say well the message is cooling down this message is not cooling down Saints as a matter of fact this message is getting hotter and burning brighter and stronger now than it's ever burned before the churches are cooling off amen but you got to get in Christ amen and not the church that's why you can't depend on the church's Revival if the church goes to a cool spot you cannot let your fire die amen because the church as a whole it's going through a cold spell you got to say Lord I'm going to feed this fire Amen on Monday morning I'm going to feed it on Tuesday I'm going to feed it on Thursday I'm going to feed it on Friday amen I'm not just feeding this fire on Wednesday and Sunday amen I'm going to throw some wood of the word on this fire see because this message amen is the fire of God I love what the prophet says God in every dispensation has sent forth someone Anointed with the holy spirit amen to bring forth his message for that age every time see and when man stepped across the message of the hour it brought death and Chaos Amen to the H to the whole human race he said now that's how much amen the message means and remember that it wasn't just a blank complete denial of what God said that he believed it was taking what God Said and whitewashing it over or just misconstruing it a little bit just adding a little bit to it or taking a little bit away from it now I'll say this amen we believe that the first church amen was established on the day of Pentecost how many agrees the first church was established on the day of Pentecost brother said Peter preached the inauguration sermon at the bakaro service when the church was born the the Christian church amen was born on the day of Pentecost and God desires that his church remain the same amen as he started it out amen he says now look but man amen has tinkered with it and put their own interpretations in it don't you never try to interpret the word of God you just say what it says and don't care how it is amen so just line up with it that's all don't you change the word the Bible said the scripture is not any private interpretation can I just say what a prophet said he said we have no right to say these things we just got to read it and say it exactly like it says and believe it the same way I don't care how ridiculous it seems you believe it anyhow do not Tinker with it just believe it anyhow I love this definition of the word tinker it means to attempt to repair or improve something in a casual or a lukewarm way so when you begin to Tinker with something you're trying to repair it you're trying to modify it amen but you're trying to do it in a casual way it's an attempt to mend something by tinkering can I say this you cannot you cannot improve a fiery message with a lukewarm YouTube channel oh God he you cannot fix a fiery message with a lukewarm YouTube approach well I'm just going to be a teacher here I'm going to tell you where brother BR missed it amen listen you're playing with fire amen but there's some people that knows this message is not cooling off it's the word of God to this generation when God sends his message to an age that message amen captures the elect it apprehends the elect and that message becomes amen the leadership of the lives of the elect of God Amen the elect of the age follows amen the leadership of the age he said now notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person amen relative to the word for that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say Amen to that age listen and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for God Amen by Revelation to the churches both the true and the false he said the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way see each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by the way of the messenger and those who hear are you hearing me now those who hear are not getting their own PR private Revelation nor is a group getting their Collective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God listen as followers of the message of the hour I believe the time has come Amen to remember what we're following you say well I don't think that's very important it is because if you know what you're following then you know what you're not following if you know what you're foll following then you can identify what you're not following and here's what Peter said he said we have not followed amen cunningly devis fables wherein we made known unto you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we're eyewitnesses of his majesty look at this word follow it means to follow out it means to follow one's Authority it means to comply with and yield to I love what brother Bram says he says I am thoroughly convinced that my message comes from God I am thoroughly convinced it's not my own fleshly mind puffed up it's the word of God I am thoroughly convinced absolutely convinced that it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I am thoroughly convinced that he's here right now I am thoroughly convinced that he is camped in here I am thoroughly convinced he will answer our prayer if we'll be concerned convinced and open our l to it see watch another place since the opening of those Seven Seals of them Angels just behind the mountain Yonder this book has become a new book it's the things that's been hid is being revealed as God promised in Revelation 10 he would do and we are amen the privileged people that God has chosen of the earth that we might see and understand these things which is not some mythical amen Earthly fleshly Mind of a person trying to make it up it's the word of God made manifest it's been proven that it's right amen not by science amen but proven by God how many can say we are now enjoying the message of the hour we are now walking in the evening light we are now believing the original identity of who we were from before the foundation of the world Listen the devil interpreted who you were amen for years and you believed it he said you was a drunk and you believed it he said you was a drug addict and you believed it he said you was a nobody and you believed it he said you was the scum of the earth and you believed it but oh it's high time Amen to change what you're believing about who you are the word says you're Overcomers the word says you're Victorious the word said that you would have a stable and a sound mind the word said amen that you would have joy unspeakable it would be full of Glory the word said you would not be drunk on wine but you would be filled with the Holy Ghost my goodness now enjoying our true identity the message of the hour has lit an expectation in us that what we read in the word can be fulfilled in our lives when I say expectation that is a strong belief somebody say strong belief that something will happen or will be the case in the future see it's a belief that someone will or should achieve something now I just got to say it folks our beliefs are strong what we believe is strong we don't believe weakness listen here the Bible said Romans 4:20 it says Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but he was strong in faith giving glory to God do you realize our beliefs are strong amen just like Father Abraham's in other words the prophet of God said this he said I would to God that you could come under the influence that I live under and my church lives under for we believe that God Is A Healer we believe that God is a savior and we believe that God gives the Holy Spirit and those three powerful beliefs in the Church of the Living God we believe he's a savior we believe he's a Healer and we believe he gives the Holy Ghost see that's our expectation that's what we get amen we get what we expect let me say this sometimes amen the only time that we come into the element of expectation is around the time of the Fall meetings or around the time of a special preacher or around the time of Youth Camp but according to the word that has lit our souls amen we are to live in the atmosphere and under the anticipation and expectation of what God can do anywhere any time in any service now I love it because when brother Bram preaches expectation he takes it from a man named Simeon and he says behold there was a man in Jerusalem Luke 2:25 whose name was siman and the same man was just and devout he was waiting for the consolation of Israel now look here and the Holy Ghost was upon Him skip down to verse amen the Holy Ghost was upon Him brother Bram said in that great evil day of formality and indifference the Holy Spirit could still amen rest on a man it was revealed verse 26 and it was revealed unto him amen by the holy ghost that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ the Holy Ghost settled on Simeon and begin to release unto him a revelation amen that built an expectation I'm not going to die until I see the Lord's Christ now look here that expectation brother Merl did not leave him hanging but that same Revelation from the Holy Ghost Amen in verse 27 it brought him to the temple oh Church there shall be a reward to my expectation and it shall not be cut off listen if you are expecting God he is not a God that says I'll give you this expectation but I have no ability to perform it but my Bible said that the Zeal of the Lord shall perform this in the camp of Israel listen folks if God promised you it's going to happen come hell or high water God will fulfill his word in the face of every devil there ain't a devil big enough there ain't a devil strong enough there ain't a devil bad enough Amen to defeat my God in fulfilling the promises of his word in the lives of his believing children an 80y old sage yeah that's what brother Bram called him with a white beard said I'm not going to die until I see the Lord's Christ brother B said Simeon did not reason it he believed it he said that's what you do you believe it see the Holy Spirit found a man to believe the message of that hour brother B said this he said it's the Holy Spirit today that's hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message you say what's the message can I say what a prophet said everything in the Bible everything in the Bible that was promised is to that believer listen and when you accept it in its fullness and God knows you'll do it oh God God knows you'll do it then he gives you the abstract to it I was a poet and didn't know it no just kid amen when God gives you the promise amen he gives you that and you accept it in its fullness listen then He gives you an abstract to that promise and then every promise that's made is your possession and the Holy Spirit is here Amen to Quicken that to you you say how's it going to happen brother Andrew wherever you go whatever you do what you expect amen brings your faith if you come here tonight saying I come for one sole purpose that is to contact Christ for my body or my soul you will go home just as happy as you can be for you will contact him now no matter what the opposition looks like here we go Church no matter what the opposition looks like amen Christ is the answer woo glory to God faith it brings Christ then Faith are you hearing me Faith knows no defeat somebody say faith is perfect can I say this one Faith brings things when there's no things to be brought Faith creates Faith takes doubt away it takes the negative and makes it positive he said so that old man had a basis for faith faith is not mythical it's something not mentally worked up it's an absolutely fundamental result amen that happens in a person's heart see so the foundation of our faith it must be a spiritual Revelation then we can expect the impossible amen I told you this morning take the limits off of God can I tell you something tonight it's time Amen to expect the impossible I said it's time to expect the impossible because faith is the foundation of our expectation which is a revelation and my Bible said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against the spiritual church that Jesus Built his own self what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying it's time Amen to quit coming to church with little old mediocre expectations and well maybe we'll just have a good service and maybe somebody will shout maybe somebody get a blessing I say it's time Amen to expect big things I say it's time oh glory to God God I say it's time Amen to expect the impossible you want to change the atmosphere in this church release your expectations unto the leadership of the Holy Ghost and let him lead you beyond your own sound barrier let him lead you beyond your own imagination let him lead you out into the Realms of spiritual Revelation where things become expectations yes sir amen expect big things amen you you didn't know you CL me but Char amen look at somebody and say expect big things some of y'all still looking at me somebody else you told the wrong person come on let's have church it's Sunday night brother Merl expect big things brother Merl I'm expecting big things you say brother there old praise God I am too I'm expecting big things in two weeks oh when Camp rolls around I'm sorry I've got the same expectations here tonight that I've got for the Youth Camp you know you know why because my expectations are not built on the shifting Sands of man's ideas my expectations are built on the revelation of thus saith the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen I say this we have a right brother Merl we have a right to expect the impossible you say why I told you this morning our God is the unlimited God can I tell you something tonight our God is the god of the impossible woo somebody shout hallelujah our god is the god of the impossible look here in St Luke chap 1:37 he says for with God Amen something or a few things shall be impossible no my Bible says with God Amen nothing shall be impossible look at St Mark chapter 9 and verse 23 Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe then all things are possible to him that believeth can I tell you what a prophet said he said you don't have to feel nothing he said you don't have to see nothing but you do have to believe something amen you don't have to feel nothing see nothing smell nothing sense nothing but you do have to believe something you know why because all things are possible to them that believe and Matthew 17 the father there with the epileptic child he took the child unto the disciples and they could do nothing for him so he brought him to Jesus and brother said this he said now you say all things are possible with God he said all things are possible to you Hallelujah did I read that right brother Colby all things are possible to you see to them that believe I love the next question he asked you believe that all things are possible to them that believe do you believe that can I tell you New Life Outreach God's power to perform the impossible is not coming in two weeks God's power to perform the impossible is not coming next week or on Wednesday night God's power to perform impossible is here brother R said you just take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise now listen watch it materialize no matter how it looks if it looks impossible if God said so he makes it possible another place second-handed robe 1956 in order to do the impossible you've got to call on God for power of God to perform the impossible I love this one if we be the messiah's servant then we have to have the messiah's power oh church if we be the messiah's servant then we have to have the messiah's power I love this when I have heard but now I see paragraph 55 you see when a man or a person has once really come in contact with god with that genuine revealed Faith now come on can I tell you what genuine revealed faith is amen genuine revealed faith is God is somebody say that with me God is God is say it again God is not God was brother can not God will be God is genuine revealed faith is this God is oh I got to thinking about that the other day then you know what I can say I can say God is here I can say God is my healer I can say God is my savior I can say God is my way maker I can say God is my Miracle Worker I can say God is my Rapture I can say God is my provider I can say God is my protector brother Kobe if God is I can say God Is My Everything Hallelujah you know what I say I say it's time to change your confession from God will be or God was to God is he is here right now he is here in power God is here to save God is here to deliver God is here to restore my mind God is here to calm my nerves God is here to break the chains of that addiction that's trying to drive me to a premature grave God is here and that becomes a genuine revealed Faith then there's no devil in hell or in this Dimension that can conquer a child of God that says God is hallelujah God is God is there's nothing no time nowhere can ever separate that man from his God now folks either we believe it or not and the Bible says that God can only lead a man as he will let him lead God can only work with anyone that will let him work with him listen in the church age book he gives us a very beautiful study on leadership he says I want to say that I believe in leadership but it's not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word I believe also that God has set men in the church who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order he said now here it is they were under the leadership speaking of Israel of the spirit of God manifested in gifts he said see God was the leader of the people he actually was their King he said he was a father King he just busied himself over them he said now God was going to humanize they were remember they were wanting human leadership so brother Kobe said God was going to humanize amen the leadership of himself listen to this Amen in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ but what they did was they got ahead of him now Satan knew the plan of God so he put it in the heart of the people to get ahead of God the word another place he said you put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it if you put the influence of the god of the impossible out of the church it is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it can I say it very plain the spirit of God makes the difference folks come on let's just preach the spirit of God makes the difference you say well I don't think it makes much difference I pray to God we never have one service where the spirit of God is not in attendance I pray he's here when we get out of our cars I praise here in the song service I praise here in the prayer request I praise here in the preaching I praise here in the specials I praise here in the young people I say oh God we want a Spirit-filled church a Spirit L spirit filled and word fed Church of the Living God hallelujah what are you saying I'm saying it very plain nobody wants to talk about it no more everybody just wants to re against it but let's just let the rubber hit the road preach a minute I'm feeling too good brother Donald they forgot there's a sin against the spirit yeah you know what Isaiah 63:10 says he said but they rebelled and they vexed his holy spirit therefore he was turned to be their enemy and watch this he fought against them look here in the New Testament in Matthew 12:31 wherefore I say unto you that all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto man now are we reading the same thing but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto man I know that I I picked that up that line devil he loves to tell God's children you blasphemed you blasphemed and you've crossed the line and you're finished well guess what I want to tell him he's finished he's finished come on church that devil tells you listen if you really blaspheme God why are you here come on come on if you're really black come on Church if you really blasphemed God why are you here brother Ram said if remember he called that woman up he said now the devil's telling you that God don't love you he said do you love God she said with all my heart he said see there had to be a God Amen create that desire in your heart to love him can I just say it to you and get it out there God ain't done with you god ain't finished with you I don't care what road you've been down I don't care what mistakes you made I don't care what sins and what habits and what addictions and what problems are binding your Liberty I come by to tell you God ain't done with you he's still a god of Salvation he's still a god of mercy and the devil is finished tonight because he is a liar you say blasphemy against the holy ghost look at this look at this look at this definition of blasphemy you know what it means brother it means slander it means empower ious and reproachful speech and it is injurious to Divine Majesty can I just say something we better ask the Holy Ghost to Bridle our tongues that's why Paul said in Ephesians 4:29 he said let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying listen that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption in 1 Thessalonians 5:19 Paul says again four four four powerful words he says this quench not the spirit are you reading what I'm reading quench not the spirit look at this word quench it means of fire or things on fire come on to be quenched to go out to suppress to stifle Divine influence so fire is actually a Divine influence in other words he's saying quench not the fire or quench not the Divine influence because whatever is influencing you is leading you remember he comes there at the end of his ministry and leadership in cenia California 1965 and he says this but now who leads you he said that's the question now now we're all led by something tonight we have to be he says we're L you know what a prophet said he said we today are God's spiritual church with a spiritual law that is written on the tables of our hearts and we are LED in a spiritual form he said now back there they looked up to see where the pillar of fire was the angel of the Lord he said but we don't look today because there's something that's happened and we know that he's here so the pillar of fire is put the whole move of God into action I'll say this we are following the scripturally identified Pillar of Fire of Exodus 13 He said Luther knew it was coming Wesley knew it was coming finny Knox and Calvin they knew it was coming he said they knew there would come a time that the pillar of fire would return back to the church they know there would come a time that these things would happen but they did not live to see it he said but they look forward to it now come on do you realize the expectations of one generation can be fulfilled in another hello the expectations of one generation can be fulfilled do you realize that Paul wrote to the Corinthians and the thalin and he said we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed he said we not all go by the way of the Great amen but we'll be alive and remain can I show you something there's not one thalin Alive Tonight folks there's not one Corinthian alive tonight so does that mean that expectation has been cut off I say no that means that expectation is going to be fulfilled in the Gentile bride that has been called out of leoa by the message of Malachi chter 4 oh church if you could only see that God can give a promise in one generation and he can fulfill it in the next the pillar of fire see he said that's some of the Mysteries this Angel is supposed to wind up amen all the mysteries of God he said see the pillar of fire returning back amen that's the thing that's supposed to take place now watch a prophet he said they look forward to it he said but we see it glory to God they were looking forward to it brother and we see it we see what they were expecting what do we see we see the pillar of fire revealing the word word by word stay with the Bible what are you saying I'm saying the pillar of fire moves forward brother bam said God's either going to lead the church the Holy Ghost is going to lead it or man's going to lead it now listen to what he says if you choose man go ahead God pulls his church right out and the pillar of fire moves on and the church moves with it he said see what Pentecost done was they stake down till they cannot move let me just say this the Pentecostal was the last great move but a prophet said that's not the latter reign of today he said the great Pentecostal Revival is now ceasing we see it everywhere the last great move the message has went forth everything's ready now waiting he said the church is Seal away the wicked are doing more wicked the churches are becoming more churchy here it is but the Saints are coming closer to God see so the Pentecostal move got so staked down in organization and denomination until it died and in 1965 you can hear it on the tape of invisible union he screams out these words he says God let it die God could have kept it alive but God let it die he said see what happened amen the shuck had to dry up to give forth a seed amen listen because there must come something that cannot be organized and die because organization spells death oh I wish I had the voice of a Thousand Angels tonight to say what a prophet was prophesying is fulfilled in this church tonight God I wish I was a preacher right now what a prophet was prophesying is right here in the flesh of every believer of this end time word he said what happened Pentecost represented Mary Mary the last stage of it now but Mary was not the seed Mary was not the seed yet the life of the seed was in her but it hadn't matured yet he said so it is with our great Pentecostal age we're living in there has got to come forth a word of God that's inner undenominational listen it's outside side of the Realms of denomination now I don't know I pray it's okay amen amen I it's just on my heart people say all the time they say y'all's a bunch of crazy people y'all believe crazy things and and what y'all believe is you know they say brother Dyan it's not even really in the Bible you know they say y'all believe all this stuff and all these promises and right Coe you're a preacher you've heard it amen all these things and all these situ and amen and you don't have no no scripture for it well I got to I got to sitting down one day and I just took time I didn't even get my computer or my my Bible out I just started writing down from memory amen scriptures that identify what we believe and who we are brother Merl can I give you just a few of them Joshua chapter 1 Psalm chapter 1 Psalm 27 Daniel 11 and 12 Hosea 6 Joel 2 Amos 3 habca 2 Zechariah 4 Zechariah 14 Malachi 4 Matthew 17 Mark 11 Mark 16 Luke 17 John chapter 12 14 15 16 Acts chapter 3 2 Corinthians chapter 3 chapter 15 Colossians chapter 1 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 Hebrews chapter 13 Revelations chapter 1 3 5 8 10 13 17 18 19 20 21 and 22 somebody tell me that what we believe is not in the scripture I say it's all in the scripture because you are the Virgin born bride who will not be tainted with a hands of denomination there will be no man handling in the Virgin birth of the word born bride of Jesus Christ the scripture today has thoroughly identified this great move of God let me say this very plainly and very boldly the same scriptural Ministry that was identified in Christ amen you say in Christ yes sir amen is now identified in the bride we see them happening like all the promises he says Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 oh how many more scriptures are you ready for this he says it would be endless if we begin to list all the scriptures amen that are pertaining to the pillar of fire that is that is returned to this bride to put the move of God into action those scriptures would be endless I got to thinking about that Josh amen where did I hear that word endless oh that's right it was in Hebrews chapter 7 when he was speaking about MDC and he said he would have the power of an endless life and then later the prophet of God said that MDC became Jesus Christ and he returns to the church amen to claim a body for a final move brother said now when we see him return in these last days this great move of God it's moving across the nations of the world what's it doing it's Gathering a people for the bride can I say it the way I'm feeling it we're going [Music] home we're going home Church the revelation of these scriptures has claimed your body listen the message has apprehended you can I say it the way brother B said it he said it's on the move move is on for the bride yes sir the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for some 2,000 years but it is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message somebody shout the Holy Spirit hly back in the church again Christ himself are you ready for this revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said it he promised it give me five more minutes on my batteries I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh through the bride's body yes sir you say brother Andrew what's happening can I say it to you you are what's happening glory to God you say what's going on in PA the Oklahoma I tell you what's going on the Bride of Jesus Christ is on the Move Hallelujah she's on the Move church and it's a scriptural move you say where are we moving to brother Austin you're not just fixing to move into a new house we're fixing to move into a brand new body we're fixing to change Dimensions when the old are going to become Young when the dead are going to raise Incorruptible I say as plain as I know how it's own church we're leaving here one of these mornings it's revealed in human flesh through the bride's body can I say it very plainly to you spiritual leadership come on has returned to the church in the form of a prophetic message to a prophetic class of people he said here it is the son of man in the form of prophetic message returning back again in his church in Prophecy the restoration of the or you got a few moments on this the restoration of the original word we spoke of it original Power this morning the restoration of the original word has restored original headship he said now United together under one headship like Israel of old somebody say original headship orinal are you ready for what it is it's one God Vindicated by a pillar of fire revealing himself through a profit to be the word okay let me make sure I got this right okay a digal headship is a prophet under the pillar of fire somebody say under let's say this together Prophet under the pillar of fire Vindicated by the word word that's original headship can you can you put that first picture up for me hello folks the expectation of it returning they were looking forward to it but their expectation has been fulfilled in your age we now have the original restored headship to the body brother said Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it then whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours if you can believe that picture then whatever God will lead your soul to believe is yours every repl The Souls of your foot amen can set upon by faith God gives it to you you say what is the leadership of God it is to follow the Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy Ghost listen folks he said this he said leave that up there for me he says and I believe as I am led to believe he said that is if the picture of the Angel of the Lord who comes and does it Discerning brother Merl struck my heart one day we have been led to believe what we believe church we have been LED Benji we have been led to believe what we have believed you say led to believe that's a phrase yes it is you know what it means it means to be influenced to a certain belief because of something seen something heard or something read you say preacher all you do is look at them pictures all you do is read them books all you do is hear them tapes you are exactly right because as a minister of God I'm leading the people to believe something I'm not leading you to believe me I'm not leading you to believe Josh Martin or any other preacher I have been called and ordained of God to lead you to believe that the god of the impossible has returned to the church by the message of the hour I'm sorry I'm getting long here but you give me some Grace I got to digging brother Merl I got to digging around in that led to believe phrase you know what I found I found out that when somebody says they're led to believe it's usually because of a conversation you know when I found the prophet said in 1953 in expectancy he said don't try to push yourself just simply believe are y'all ready for this and what he tells me I'll tell you woo Glory what he tells me I'll tell you 1959 speak to this mountain when he stands before me in that light that you see on that picture and reveals it every time is perfect with the scripture through and through that's the reason I know it's the angel of the Lord because he Bears record of his word and if that angel told me one thing that wasn't scriptural I would not believe him it has to be with the word first because God's word is eternal an angel could come and preach something else Paul said that and it wasn't right but if it's the word of God then the angel of God will verify that word every time to be the truth if it's a true angel from the Lord if it's something off color then don't you listen to it if it's something off color then don't you listen to it but if an angel comes and speaks and says exactly what the word says then that angel is from God can y'all give me that second picture oh there it is may say y'all believe some funny things no we don't I told you it's in the scripture do you see what I see I was out in Arizona the day and I I I was in a hurry and I was preaching along these lines and I didn't have this file of pictures with me so I just went on the internet real quick and I grabbed one and I mailed it over to brother Doug emailed it to him I said here here it is and brother Kobe I got to looking at it after I sent it to him and I said something's missing in that picture I said something's missing in that picture and I got to look him and then I looked at the website God forgive me I looked at the website that I actually pulled it from and I just Googled the picture real quick and the website I pulled it from it was it was oh God God forbid it was believe the sign I said well them bunch of devils and a bunch of reprobates I said there's something missing that picture so I went over there amen voice of God website and I found the original picture you know what I found missing I found the fact that there was a bunch of fishermen in a boat behind the prophet on the Ohio River them bunch of reprobates want to say what we believe has been hashed out of some corner somewhere and we're a bunch of Kool-Aid Drinkers and a bunch of Fanatics listen God even made a bunch of fishermen on the boat amen witness his dissension in the form of the pillar of fire to announce to this generation We're Going Home by the word of God Hallelujah right there he is baptizing on that was all free of charge on the Ohio River and he's fishing to take the 17th person down brother Benji you know what happened out of Heaven There come a pillar of fire the same Pillar of Fire you seen in that picture come out of the heavens and begin to talk to a prophet in the water and said it's John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ your message will forun the second coming of Christ he said and around on the world the Revival fires have been burning on every Hillside you know why because it's wood from the word that Lit your soul Church Hallelujah he stood on the Ohio River and had a conversation can you give me the next picture he stands in 1957 preaching in Lakeport California he say you're making this about brother random I'm making this about God he stands preaching in Lakeport California in 1957 and while he's preaching they snap this picture but go the next one there it is and when they snap that picture the pillar of fire oh God is surrounding a prophet in other words come on church do you all realize right now there's all kinds of thoughts and they're floating through this room and the only they're looking for is a mind that is yielded to pick them up do you realize there's depression thoughts right now do you realize there's negative thoughts brother Kobe and they're roaming through this room right now and they're looking for some feeble mind Amen to yield itself and to become a transmitter for those negative thoughts amen but here a prophet stands preaching amen showing you that he was not pulling these things out of midair showing you that it was not coming from just any Source the pillar of Fire was a bumper around the prophet in the pullit as he was preaching things from the word of God you say preacher you lost your mind amen God bless our brother Shawn Martin as just a young preacher kid brother sea it helped me see that as clear as I've ever seen it before he said brother Andrew the brother B said this way he said the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always listen I had preached this message when there was wide open Liberty and I preached it when it was tighter amen at 8 day clock amen but you know what I found I found if you'll just keep on preaching it the pillar of fire is still with it and before long he'll break through in the atmosphere and somebody will see God is can I say it God is still with this message standing there preaching about this picture last week and in in Arizona I didn't know it just standing there preaching brother brother Doug's wife sister Jennifer told him when they got home said said tell brother Andrew said while he was preaching I looked up and said when he showed that picture the pillar of fire went right across the platform hallelu folks we're not crazy a prophet had a conversation can you give me that last picture man sitting right present now 1963 was standing right there by me when seven angels come down from God visibly standing right there and told me about the end time and these Revelations and the things of the Book of Revelation the Seven Seals and said return home and one by one will bring the message 1963 absolute there stood Seven Angels standing right there commission me to go back and bring these messages and said one by one they would meet and tell what happened brother brother you ministering Brothers you know you preached before you you know what I'm talking about you tell people I got to go study yeah I got to go get my study can you imagine a prophet going to a study for seven days and there was a calendar appointment with the angel of the Lord you say you're crazy am I really and it did exactly that way and when they ascended up on high like that went 30 miles high and on the same day they took the picture of it science did and went around the world it's a paradox but it's an absolute listen to this it's tied me tighter into Jesus Christ come on winding my life into him folks this is not the cunningly devised fables this message is a supernatural Vindicated conversation between a prophet and the angel he said I almost come out and made the greatest mistake today he said I almost made the Antichrist Christ again brother merley said but he come in the room and he told me that that white horse rider was the Antichrist he stands there on the first Hill and he says I don't know what the second till is so he went back in the room and he had another conversation with the angel and he come out and he said here's what that second horse rider is he went back in the room come out here's that third here's that fourth went back in the room said here's that fth seal it's them Souls Of Martyrs under the altar went back in his room come back out from a conversation with the angel and said there's that sick seal it's the tribulation seal somebody say well you ever studied it you study the six seal I'll tell you what's powerful about it okay what's powerful about it is not what you find in it it's what you don't find you know what you don't find in it yourself it's a tribulation seal folks you're going in the rapture huj w we have had a Vindicated conversation recorded and I have been led to believe that what I say heaven backs up somebody said man brother Andrew that's some pretty big boldness it is because I say what a prophet said on tape I've been led to believe church that missing limbs will be restored I have been led to preach and believe that prodical will come home I have been led to believe I have been led to believe that our loved ones will appear someday behind us listen it's more than a conversation it's more than somebody just walking in and saying brother Austin you imagine if if if if I was if I was really trying to persuade you in your life and to do something and I was telling you do this do this do this do this and you weren't listening to me so I I mean I got to step it up because I mean you're not listening to me so I come over and I said I said an angel met me and told me to tell you oh dear God I've got to believe it now he's been talking to Angels you ain't got to believe nothing till you vindicate it by the word but when a prophet tells you something he talked to the angel of the Lord and it's already Vindicated and you can put everything you got on it and you won't lose nothing what are he saying I'm saying come on Haddie what was the Revelation what was the foundation what was the basis of your faith brother BR walked in there and I'm closing on this and throws him squirrels down on on Charlie Cox's table the T throws them squirrels down there and starts telling Charlie I was out in the woods talking to God about St Mark the 11th chapter and he said he was talking to me and he said we were we were fellowshipping on Mark 11 how these things could be and he said while we were fellowshipping he said he spoke to me and said who is it that does the speaking he said it's me he said you need squirrels speak he said I spoke and seven squirrels come into existence remember that now now can I show y'all something on the other side of the wall there's a little widow woman with not enough money to hardly pay the rent but she's hearing about a Vindicated conversation and what she's hearing is leading her to believe that her two boys that are on the other side of the building and laughing at this conversation can be saved glory to God they were led to believe and he looked at her and said Haddie do you believe that she said that ain't nothing but the truth he said ask whatever you will you want a million dollars it'll be right here on the table you want Little you want your little your sister to get up off the bed and be well she'll get up instantly whatever you ask in this atmosphere it's going to happened you know what she said she said this she said I want the salvation of my two boys won't you stand your feet with us tonight I say this to you we have been led to believe what we believe listen I Know The Enemy I Know The Enemy loves atmospheres like this he loves to he loves to he loves to put crazy ideas in your mind and tell you that you can't have these things they're not for you but I tell you tonight by the word of the Lord I have been led to believe believe that all things are possible to them that believe whatever you have need of if you'll ask it God is able as a matter of fact he's more than able he's more than able folks I'm just going to I'm gonna B brother brother Benji's testimony here tonight wasn't even raised in the message but the Lord the Lord got a hold of him and revealed this word to him now come on folks it's more than the ideas of a man somebody start talking to you about squirrels being spoken to existence and lights appearing and clouds and all kinds of things your mind starts saying what in the world but if you just look here it's all through the scriptures it's Exodus 4 it's Revelations 10 it's Luke 17:30 brother says here it is he says may they become born may they become burning torches to this dark hour we live in as we see that so-called civilization Smothers out the very light of God if it is possible he says but yet that torch will burn in the hearts of the people until Jesus comes God could take a an old men andite boy raised and set him on fire with the message of the hour and that torch can burn till Jesus comes what about you tonight brother Miguel he can take you and set you on fire and burn till Jesus comes Josh burn till Jesus comes young people Simeon you can take your life and set you on fire as as a as a as a little boy and you can burn until Jesus comes folks this is more than a Pentecostal Revival it don't burn down it burns up it burns up it just keeps on getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger do you love him tonight he says all that coincides this morning with the faith he says the Living Faith of the Living God in his church there is something in our heart how many can agree with this that speaks there is a land beyond the river he says I cannot put my finger on that land and neither can any man but there's something with in us that tells us the grave is not our goal dust Thou Art to dust thou returnest was not spoken of the Soul there is something within us it's a fire that's a burning it's a light that's been lit by God and no breezes can blow it out there's no cold spells in the church there's no indifference amongst the people there's no persecution of the world that can blow out a flame that God has lit for it's God's purpose are you hearing me tonight church
