through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in Heavenly through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perish though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom have not seen ye love in whom

you may be seated this morning my thought this morning Trials of your faith is tried and tested a Believer when they come to God and they recognize that they are Sons and Daughters of God you're going to be tested when Jesus Christ came out of his baptism he was tested Jesus had to be tested to be proven who he was he had to be an example he had to be a savior that was going to save the world if they chose him to be their savior he had to show the people that in this flesh we can be more than conquerors you're going to be tested you're going to have pain you're going to get old you're going to see wrinkles but he won't forsake you but there is a gold of God the brandom said 1 Peter 1 and7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than the gold of of perish the gold of God is a Christ Christlike character produces in the fiery furnace of fictions that is the right kind of gold I want to be that right kind of gold this morning I want the Lord to see himself in me church we should be desperate in the presence of to the Lord this morning it's time to go home I don't know about you but I'm glad for this year but the trials are harder the trials are coming more because there is a sea that's laying down inside of God's children and the devil does not want them to go in a Rapture he's going to fight you he's going to put things upon you he's going to make you think of your pains and aches he's going to get you young people all caught up into little things try to keep you away from the mind of God he's going to try to keep you away from listening to your parents he's going to do everything he can to Bald up this mind of yours so you don't think of God he's going to throw trials after trials upon you he's going to call you names he's going to get you to get mad at somebody else in the church he's going to try to get you to be a busy body he's going to try to get you to talk about people he's going to try everything he can to get you away from the power of God but oh saints of God if we're can sit back for a moment and just see the glory of God he had reserved a place in heaven for just you this morning oh you should be shouting with Glory quit thinking about your sickness quit thinking about the vital of your mind but think of him this morning and let him clean out your mind let him clean out your heart there be Victory and peace forever more into your life this morning so your trials sometimes is Jewels do you re realize that he said that it was more precious than gold your faith when it's been tried now don't think that fiery Trials come upon you us to prery us when you go through temptation just hold your ground hold to your ground church you're going to go through trials you're going going to go through tribulation you're going to go through these things cuz God is going to make you perfect he's going to make you Sons and Daughters of God that you was before the foundations of the world he's going to give you the power to be Overcomers he's going to give you exactly what you need to come through your trial he's going to give you an understanding Who You Are he's done everything for you and me everything he's not left nothing out the only thing that we've got to do is grab a hold to this right here and find the promises and if you don't understand get in the message of the hour and it will show you what God was trying to tell you about you Hallelujah but you're going to go through those trials you're going to go through tribulation you're going to feel like you're the only one that's going to through it but you're not there's not one person here is going to make heaven without trials not one of you young ladies here are going to go to heaven without going through trials you young men you're going to go through trials why cuz you're jewels of God you're Sons and Daughters of God and God promised he was going to have a children and he he promised that he was going to have a Garden of Eden and they were going to live there for a thousand years and he's going to do it Hallelujah I want to be a part of that today I want to be a part of God's family I'm tired of this world beating on me I'm tired that I pay a bill for $400 electric bill and next month it's $600 a month and then the next day it's this and that and bills keep coming and the bills keep coming and the trials keep coming you're working yourself to death you're working from sun up to sun down he's keeping you busy he's keeping you out of the out of the house keeping you away from the house so you can't read your Bible he keeps you on our phones he does everything he can to do what to keep you busy that's all he has to do in this age is keep you busy keep me busy because when you're busy you start thinking but when we're reading this we're being charged we're getting filled we're getting something from God that'll help us through that day of hard times when we're down in the valley down in the Grumps down to swimming Through The Valleys through the rivers and things and where Waters almost above our heads something all of a sudden you'll be swimming and all a sudden you step on a rock you you can stand up and you tread in water and then and you go again and you go under but you come back up cuz you're fighting these trials get hard I know they get hard to us I know we go through pressure I can't imagine getting one wrist broke and then just a little while longer getting the other one broke I can't imagine being 80 years old I can't imagine it but I know it's hard I can see it in my family church members 70 you're hard some of you can't even stand up and read the word with us cuz your body's aching why because there's testing you're going through a test in your old age that's why we need one another so much as all adults want these kids right here to exceed then quit putting them down when they make mistake lift them up sometimes we forget to get that big old beam out of our own eye that big old trial that we've got that we're not taking care of business in this on eye but we can see everybody else's faults we're worrying about other people worry about yourself because you're an individual God deals with individually you've got a road that youve got to go on I got to go on a road and this road is going to be hard it's not going to be simple I've got a of Journey of William Smith has to make and it's going to go up it's going to go down it's going to have to climb it's going to have to go through brush it's going to have to go through all kinds of trash to get to home but I'm home we're bound Church years ago when I was a kid my aunt was trying to teach me how to read and she had this book Homer bound they made movies out of it and things but this is a real true story about a two dogs and a cat and these cats didn't the cat didn't talk and the dogs didn't talk but this little family was going to go on vacation and so they took their animals to the grandparents that was about 30 to 40 miles away and they dropped him off in the backyard and loved them and kissed them and and you know how his animal lovers are and there they are they leave after a couple of days the grandma mother calls the the her son and says listen your oldest dog is not moving it's just sitting there on the back side of the house and it's he's he not eating he's not drinking water and I we're really concerned about your dog and they got they love their animals so much that they stopped their vacation and they said Mom we're on our way home we'll be there in a couple of days they're on their way home and this this male this this older dog gets up and he barks at the other two those three was always together they did things together in their backyard they played with each other the cat would run and the dogs would Chase and the dogs would run the cat would Chase they were just a little teeny animal family but one day that dog said my master did home this is not my home my home's over there somewhere and that book says that that that dog started walking around the fence line he found a place to get out and that little cat followed and the little dog followed and then they was on their way home but at that moment they didn't know that they were going to go through trials they didn't know that they were going to have to go through the rivers they didn't know that they were going to have to suffer to go home but they started on their Journey they didn't even know how to get there they didn't know what to do but they were going on Instinct sometimes our pastor doesn't know which direction to go but he's he's going on Instinct sometimes we just need to follow sometimes we just need to look at the headship in the church and just follow but this dog he starts going and before long they go through the rivers and they almost drown they go up in the mountains and lions almost killed them they went by traffic and the cars almost killed them they went into little towns and the dog catcher and the cat catchers tries to catch them but they're going through the there they were going home or bound they were on their way home but they had to go through these trials and they had to go through it some of them almost died I've heard testimonies in this church we almost got killed today in a car accident they get they get to Grandma's house and they look and they're gone and grandma says they left this morning I don't know where they went they looked all over the town they looked everywhere they couldn't find them babies so the dad says well we're going to go home now kids are crying every every body's all upset and crying but after about 3 or 4 days they're at home they're out there in the backyard and they all every once in a while look cuz they land goes like this and goes over to a hump the Daddy's out there cooking hamburgers and hot dogs and Mom's running back and forth and the kids are playing right there in the in the backyard not very Happ happy but one one afternoon while they were there they heard this this voice this this little bark that they could recognize I believe God can recognize your voice this morning church you're struggling through life you're struggling through things you're you're struggling you don't even know how you're going to make it but you're struggling this little fellow he's running and he's barking and the little boy goes daddy do you hear the bark I don't know that remember the dog's name and they all stopped and they're looking all of a sudden the little flappy ear starts to flapping that little dog runs into the little boy's arms and he's made it home all of a sudden the little girl's looking out and she's waiting to see her little kitty the Master's watching every day he's out in the field waiting for that lost one to come home maybe that backsliding one thinks that he's so religious that he's better than everybody else and he doesn't realize it but he's struggling he's trying to be the very best he can but life is getting him hard then all of a sudden they can see this little tail flopping in the wind like this she goes there's Miss Kitty there's Miss Kitty and you can hear a little meow she runs in the arms of her master she made it home the Daddy's looking he's looking at his oldest son and he's crying he's laying there crying cuz he's looking for his big dog he's looking over the horizon and he's waiting 20 minutes go by then all of a sudden they see these little ears flopping and the little body just go just as hard as he can home he's been through the battlefield he's been fighting all the way he didn't know at the beginning that he was going to be this way but he kept on going he should have never made it across the highway the first time he should have never made it through the river he should have never got away from the Bobcat he should have never got away from the bear but he struggled and he struggled but he come limping in the Paradise in the arms of his own Mighty God he was there but now he was saved now he's home but he struggled but he never got off course he stayed with the course he kept fighting and he kept fighting and he kept fighting to get home Hallelujah church just keep fighting God's got a plan for you he loves you church he loves you young ones you're going to go through trials you elderly you're going to go through it nobody loves me anymore I'm too old they don't want to come to my house in fellowship with an old man or an old woman anymore gra a hold to Jesus say oh you're my provider you're the one that I need to fellowship with Hallelujah and shame on me and shame on us not going to our elders and visiting them more often but oh praise God Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he didn't die in vain church he died for a purpose you have a purpose in life church every single one of you have a purpose you're going to be chasen you're going to get spanked you're going to get loved but you're going to be set aside once in a while in a place where you don't like to be because God's Building character in you character with that limp yes that character with that limp don't matter Jacob when he got a name changed he had a limp all the way back to home all the way until they put him in the grave he had that limp he wrestled with the Lord hallelujah he got his birth right Hallelujah let's fight let's when we going through our struggle let's fight you see somebody that needs needs something you're worrying about them get on your knees you really want to do something for somebody in this church get on your knees let's take that song serious I'm going to talk about you on my knees Hallelujah cuz there's only one that can change oh we can lead people to water but if they don't drink but if you're a real Horseman like my daddy was he'd always have a little bit of salt in his pocket and he'd grab that salt and he stick it in their mouth and get it rubbing in there and he would lead them right to water and guess what the first thing they would do they' get a drink because he was a Horseman a real preacher it's good horsemans ship they know how to get you thirsty get you salty and when you get salty every time them doors open they'll be here but so you want somebody to be here you want somebody to to be a closer walk throw a little bit of the Holy goes to let them get that salt in their mouth and that Holy Spirit Will fli into their body and something will happen to them and they won't miss a church service why because now God has changed them here I can wash a pig up but if that pig is a pig and that Nature's a pig it's going to go right back out in the water Walla but if you can get that nature change you and I had a nature change one day God couldn't even have fellowship with us when we were born he had to give us a nature change Hallelujah why CU he wanted Fellowship he wanted to have fellowship with you guys Hallelujah why because he loved you praise the Lord praise the Lord it says got sick sometimes God tries our faith do you believe that every son that comes to God must be tried think it not strange that fiery Trials come because it's only done to per perfect your faith draw you you closer to him sister Karen you're going through this trial because he wants you closer to him CU he knows you're going to go through it she threw a powerful uh quote the other day about how raising children woo while she's having this arm hurrying her in pain she's in the father's business Hallelujah there's an example young people hallelujah 1 Peter 5 and 10 it says but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Jes uh Christ Jesus after that he have suffered a while make you perfect established strong strengthen settles you have you ever been in a trial and oh you think it's oh man and all of a sudden the spirit of God comes down upon you and takes care of it and it just you're just in s situation and you know it was God he'll never forsake you he loves you three boys he loves you brother he loves you man doesn't matter what you do it's what you do when you get up you call upon his name and say oh god of Heaven forgive me doesn't matter if anybody else don't forgive you but it's him that can forgives you hallelujah it's not man's man wisdom it's God's power in you the hope of glory hallelujah we're individuals we think different we walk different anybody ever Walks Like Me you're crazy I waddle you don't want to waddle and you don't want to be like John Wayne but be yourself just be yourself because that's what God's coming for he's coming to get you Hallelujah he's coming because he created that person on the inside of you because he needed you he needed your personality sister Betty he needed your personality hallelujah praise be to God now listen but real children of Abraham Seed of Abraham believes that because you're dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise the same Holy Spirit was in Christ is in you and you believe the same thing so if you do not believe it remember there's something liking cuz the holy spirit will certainly agree with his his own word hallelujah his word will set you free Hebrews 11 and 17 by faith Abraham when he was tested offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son when that little Isaac come along God fulfilled his promise to Abraham and then he got to be around 16 or 18 years old lovely little boy who's 18 over here lovely little boy I was thinking about you when I read this at home and here was Abraham and Sarah in enjoying the blessings don't you do don't you enjoy the blessings when God promis you and he gives them to you Hallelujah I broke the I a little bit there Hallelujah and he says God said give Abraham some testing do you believe that children of God have testing and trials every son that comes to God must must first be tried and chasen chasen did you ever have any of it child training bringing you up giving you a little whatever he calls that stimulation once behind good spanking once in a while by the gospel makes you corrected I'm happy that my heavenly father gives weapons to those who are wrong and correct me when I'm wrong correct me when I'm wrong Lord give me weapons makes me straighten up walk like you should walk you believe that so why are we better than God why was brother William better than God cuz I didn't SP my child enough Mama did reason why you have Brianna is so sweet is because of mama mama knows mama knows what we need he told Abraham he's going to try him give him trials every Christian every Christian has to go through trials Peter said think of of it not strange beloved when Tri fiery Trials come upon you for for it's only done to prove your faith that's more precious to you than gold you're more precious than gold Hallelujah first Peter 4 and 12 it says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to to try you as though some strange thing happens to you but rejoice in in so much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed he may be glad also which exceeding Joy if he be reproached for the name's sake of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of the of God rest upon you oh I like that and their part he is evil speak of but on your part he is glorified oh saints of God look when you're sick sometimes how is it the righteous suffer wish we had a night to preach on it he said that how God does it for for his own Glory turns right back around and heals that and starts to test starts a testimony amen God's wonderful he'll throw a test on you you'll pass it and now you have a Victorious Life you have a Victorious path why and you have a testimony that you're Sons and Daughters of God if he gets the glory who gets the benefits yes you do you are witnesses on this Earth you're not just a instrument player but you're an instrument of God that God has chosen before the foundations of the world to testify to testify testify of what what what our Lord has done for me he's taken a man that used to drink cuss beat people up get beat up and take all that away and give me eternal life that's why I don't look back that's why I don't look back brother Merl some of you that come out of denominations I'm glad I came out of the barroom because I don't have all that religious stuff that you guys have to battle through who was a Baptist at one time brother BR says that's the hardest people to get to this message and look at you all blow you kiss cuz I went to a Baptist Church when I was little and I looked at that preacher and said you're a hypocrite come here I was his age don't know the Bible at all but I Knew by my grandpappy or my granddaddy and my grandma said smoking is wrong and I wish your mama and daddy would quit that's what they told me my grandma talked she had the thus say the Lord in my life so I went to church got me a brand new Bible you can sit down walked out the back door and there is a preacher I walked right up to him said you hypocrite you tell me I'm a sinner and I need Jesus you should have been there at the altar my grandma said smoking is wrong and you I don't want to be in your church never went back that's the only religious that I got turn me away from religion but oh when he come oh when he come the master of Heaven come down and I saw those Nails going into his hands I said oh I got a to serve a god like that I was wretched and blind and miserable but oh I cursed his name I cursed the name of God I did all kinds of trash but he still loved me brother da he was worthy he was worthy and I said Lord I'm not worthy to serve you but if you'll fix my broken heart he fixed it he gave me a family that led me oh sometimes you get mad at me and want to hit me I'd rather you hit me than go and talk to somebody else about me I really do so if you're one of those people that likes to go around telling everybody everything and it's about me if you really love God come hit me first hit me don't go tell somebody else because you might as well just get a gun and just shoot me because you just ruin my testimony and that's in the Bible look it up but we're going through trials we make mistakes and if we can look at each other and know that we are sons of God and we see somebody in The Fault we'll be going to them in prayer and saying oh God help my family I can't make it to heaven without my wife I can't help it I can't go without dawn I can't wait I can't go without 10 I can't wait for these boys I've got to have God in my life I got to have them in my life Lord help them Father what they're going through and God get that too far out of my eye so I can have peace Hallelujah part of being glorified having a testimony now Abraham God called him he was a father of many nations he was promised that he was going to have a son but when God come to him in a vision and said Abraham Abram I mean Abraham take your son your only begotten son and go out three days and I want you to lay him up on the Altar and kill him for a sacrifice here was a valley here was a test that Abraham had to look at and when he looked at it he was looking at the promise he wasn't looking at the circumstances he was looking at the promise and he got up the next morning he grabbed the lad he grabbed the wood he grabbed the donkeys he grabbed the men he he grabbed the fire he grabbed his knife and he started marching he went three days until God says that's the mountain and he stands there and he grabs the wood and he puts it in the lad he grabs the fire and he puts it on the lad he grabs his knife and he puts it in his sheep and he stands there and he looks at them men he says me and the lad are going to go up and sacrifice and we will be back he wasn't looking at the circumstances he wasn't looking at the sickness he wasn't looking at the broken arm he wasn't looking at the bad back he wasn't looking at the trials he was looking at the promise Hallelujah he was looking at the promise he was looking at First Peter 1 and four to an inheritance Incorruptible undefiled and fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you for me if he said it it has to come to pass if I have both arms off and both legs off and I'm willing here and I'm willing here and I'm still going fighting I'll be there because when I get my body change I get my fullness of adoption and my body's changed I'll have my legs back I'll have my arms back I'll have my right mind before the foundations of the world I will know who I am completely at that time but I have a promise I have the earnest of my adoption I am planning on I'm moving on forward and moving on with more power and more power and more power until this body is changed and when this body is changed no devil in hell will ever fiddle with me no more because I have a new mind I have a new heart and my soul is satisfied why because it kept fighting the soul keeps fighting and one day that black dog is going to be stomped in the ground and he's going to be pushed off the edge and and the white dog is going to rain forever more in his promise hallelujah hallelujah but he was tested I can imagine him getting up there and his mind is going through it but he's going through the motions knowing that God's going to do it I don't know how he's going to raise him up but he's going to die and he lays him up there and his son as he going up the mountain his son goes Daddy I we got the wood we got the fire you got the knife where's the sacrifice God will provide a lamb God will provide a lamb God has provided a lamb we just have to claim it Hallelujah and he lays him up on the Altar and his son's there just quiet he he knows his dad has a has to do something and he lays there and he ties him up up he gets him all stretched up and now he's got the sheath and he pulls his knife out and he sticks it up in the air and all of a sudden the greatest words you ever want to hear Abraham [Music] Abraham Kobe Caleb Sharon Joe John whoever you are in here don't touch that lad I know you love me you proven it you proven it little bride and about that time they heard and he looked over and God provided him a lamb for the sacrifice the only begotten son now is gone in his mind but he thought God was going to raise him up again but he kept hold of the promise if you don't know what the promise is you need to get in the book you need to get in the message of the hour and start finding out who you are and the promises you got brother W is studying and he's studying and he's doing all he can to get you to understand all this but if you haven't got off a first base you'll never understand this because you won't have the desire to he'll sit there Amen brother that's the truth amen go through this here out the other but if you started right and you're living right you're going to look at that and say praise be to God for a promise oh thank God for those that came out of this one oh thank God who came out of this one oh thank God who came out of this one thank God who came out of this one oh thank God who came out of this one thank God who came out of this one oh Hallelujah I come out of that one now I'm briide time Hallelujah and something on this inside of you will be thrilled because now I have come out of the last age into to God's unchanging hand he promised that last Church age that you're EOS and because you're EOS you're going to be just like your daddy an overcomer Hallelujah an overcomer he was called to be a father of many nations he was tested to see if he's going to be a father he was tested for 25 years and he had a son he was tested to kill him and he he was going to do it and God stopped him Hallelujah sometimes I was telling brother wle this year not long ago three times this has happened in my life when I deposit a $150 check in Mor a New Mexico for electric you have to put a deposit down and in one year you get it back if you're you're staying faithful with your your payments that year went by I had I had electric bill there was 150 bucks brother Kobe I did what my pastor said I paid my ties I gave my offerings then I started paying bills I didn't even have enough money to pay the electric bill I didn't have enough money to buy me food I paid everything else the day that I has posos to pay the $150 two months beforehand they gave me a check from the electric company for 150 bucks I already spent that I spent that on Friday night with my brother Dale and kids and we had ice cream and cake and uh nachos and all kinds of stuff went to the went to the post office to get my bills like I always did walked in there there's a letter from the phone I mean the electric company so we're sorry we didn't give you your $150 yet we're two months behind paid me this so dumbhead me go down there and said uh you guys don't owe me this I owe you guys 150 bucks she said oh no in not look William we never paid you I said well give me a 15 minutes and I'll be right back because I'm paying you I took that thing got paid my bills kept electric a year later it happened again they sent me another check for $150 I had $50 so I put that with that money and paid my elctric bill the next following year I had an $80 bill and they sent me another $150 I paid the bill and then I went to my brother's house and we partied I don't party anymore because I got married I can't go to my brother's house but you know I was getting desperate God come on the scene so when I paid my ties I paid these things off God has always blessed brother William when I did it he still blessed me because I'm his son but it's a whole lot better when you're living right and you're doing right and you're doing everything you can and he comes and gives you a big old hug and say I got it be little guy God little sister I got you but we're going to go through trials we're going to go through trials let me move up a little bit now notice just in a moment now we see in the election that God calls Abraham and notice the first thing when he calls man he calls for total separation from the world total separation from yourself Abraham as soon as he got his call he separated himself from the things of the world he left his hometown he left everything and he followed God and he was tested and tested and tested and tested until the day he went in the grave you and I are going to be tested every day of Our Lives amen every Christian in here that's born again when God calls you calls for total separation if he did if he didn't you got the wrong call see that's powerful now he says here I want to skip some of this but he was talking about child uh uh being chasing and trials and you're going through it and and child training and schooling and all these ex experiences that you have to go through as a son and then he goes on and he keeps on going you have to go through them trials and through tribulations suffer persecution then you're endure these things you are real children of God he says okay so we're going to move up a little bit bit farther and he says now but after death Faith sees the resurrection and God of Resurrection so when you are dead in this world to the things of the world you're looking at one thing Resurrection right you want to go home right and so here he stands and he's he's talking and he goes now that's the power of Faith to believe when he asked stand over behind the Dark Cloud that you can't see with your natural eye but Faith stands by you directs you to that God's resurrection and God of all wisdom oh ordain our path he stands just behind every trial I love that he said don't don't you to know that Peter said that every trial is worthy more to us than gold for it's working every son that comes to God must first be tried struggles chasing if you get a little heart broke over you get born again little trials that's upsets you somewhere and you run back into the world again it shows you wasn't a child to begin with you become a illegitimate child and not a child of God James 1 and2 James 1 and2 it says my beloved count it all joy when he fall into divver temptation knowing this that the trials of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that he may be perfect and endure waiting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God and giveth to all men Liberty and upbring up bringeth not did I say that word right yeah close enough it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that waver is like a wave of sea dive with a wind of toss I don't want to be tossed around I want to stand my grounds I want to stand on the promise of God and if it kills me I'm going to stand Hallelujah now Abraham had to be tested we have to be tested but there is one thing that I would like to say this morning that in the scriptures I read this morning or a little while ago then brother Brown came back and says but there is a gold of God do you know who that is only one person in here said me wow wasn't a trick but this piece of gold that God grabbed out of that ground he couldn't see himself in it when you first came to God you had crud all over you you had dross you had all kinds of malice you had all kinds of things that was blocking you away from a complete fellowship with God and so the master went to work he gets in into his shop and he gets that fire burning really hot in that oven and he gets that little Clump and he sticks it in there and he gets it starts getting where can squeeze it a little bit with his t uh tongues that he's got and he gets that thing out and he sits it up there on the Mallet and he starts beating it and he's beating it and then he beats it and then he beats it trials after Trials Come trials after Trials Come tribulation comes oh everything's upon you beating you he grabs it and he sticks it back in the fire some more H that furnace it gets hot and harder and he brings it back out and he beats it and he beats it and he beats it until one day he gets it about so big and he looks up and he sees himself that's the day we're going to cross the line into our new body and we're going to rain forever more and we're going to sit there in that wedding supper and we're going to be talking to all these brothers and sisters from the day of Pentecost all the way up to here and these folks are going to look at us and say wow you come out of this Michael tell me about it oh I gave my life to God I preach and the power of God come down and I laid hands on the sick and they were recovered but when they took me into Rome and put my head head in that block he chopped my head right off but oh you had the devil in your ear all the whole time you were born sicknesses and all kinds of trash happened to you buddy tell me someone tell me about it what a fellowship that's going to be we're going to be able to sit there at that long table one day with all those Church age brothers and sisters but see they can't get all their fulfillment until we meet them in the air with a body change then everything that we got here they'll have it here in glory because they came up for their day they had enough of the Holy Ghost for them to go when they died they had enough to stain them until all Church ages are done Hallelujah there's a type there we got little ones here they're way down at the bottom so every time we see one wrong hey you know you're

receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him Romans 833 who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify who is he that condemn it is Christ that died yay rather that he raised again who is even at the right hand of God who also make intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation distress or persecution or fame or nakedness or princel or sword as it is written for the sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter I love these last words nay in all these things we are more than conquerors to him that love us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angel no principalities no powers nor things present nor things to come no height no depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord I got two more is uh Isaiah 40 and 28 hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the musicians can come

have no might and increased strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the youth men shall utter fou but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings of eagles they shall run and not weary and they shall walk and not faint psalms 27 14 wait on the Lord be of good cheer and he shall strengthen thy heart wait I say on the Lord Joshua 1 and N
