[0:00] start this
[0:02] life and then you gave me wings to
[0:07] fly. And I learned to
[0:10] dream because you believed in
[0:16] me. There's no power like it on this
[0:21] earth. No
[0:23] treasury to it.
[0:28] The gift of a
[0:31] mother's
[0:33] [Music]
[0:38] love. Thank you for the sun
[0:43] day that fill the corners of my
[0:48] memory. Thank you for every selflessness
[0:54] unsung I know you did for me.
[0:59] Thank you for giving me the choice to
[1:04] search my soul till I could find my
[1:09] voice. And I thank you for teaching
[1:14] me to be strong enough
[1:20] to. You gave me the roots to start this
[1:25] life. And then you gave me wings to
[1:30] fly. And I learned to
[1:33] dream because you believed in
[1:39] me. There's no power like it on this
[1:44] earth. No
[1:46] treasure to
[1:50] it. The gift of a
[1:54] mother's love.
[1:58] [Music]
[2:06] I thank God for a
[2:12] mother's love.
[2:17] [Music]
[2:36] My sister's little
[2:38] boy came into the kitchen one evening
[2:40] while she was fixing supper and handed a
[2:43] piece of paper that he had been writing
[2:45] on. And after wiping her hands on her
[2:48] apron, she took the letter in her hands
[2:50] and she read it and this is what it
[2:53] said.
[2:56] For mowing the yard,
[2:58] $5. And for making up my own bed this
[3:01] week,
[3:03] $1. For going to the store, 50
[3:07] cents. And playing with little brother
[3:10] while you went
[3:12] shopping, 25
[3:16] cents. Taking out the
[3:18] trash,
[3:21] $1. And forgetting a good report.
[3:25] $5 and for the yard
[3:30] $2
[3:33] total
[3:36] 1475. Well, she looked at him standing
[3:38] there
[3:40] expecting and a thousand memories began
[3:42] to flash through her
[3:45] mind. So she picked up the pen and she
[3:48] turned the letter over and this is what
[3:50] she wrote to that little boy.
[3:54] months I carried
[4:03] you
[4:05] tonight with
[4:07] [Music]
[4:13] you for the time and the tears and the
[4:18] cost through the years. There is no
[4:23] charge when you add it all up. The real
[4:28] cost of my love is
[4:35] no fil with dread and the worry.
[4:42] No
[4:44] charge for advice and the love and the
[4:49] cost of your college.
[4:55] [Music]
[5:02] char. There's no charge in my soul. when
[5:08] you
[5:15] [Music]
[5:18] real looked up at her with great big old
[5:20] tears in his eyes and he said,
[5:23] "Mama, I sure do love you."
[5:26] And then he reached out and he got the
[5:28] letter, turned it over and he wrote in
[5:30] grand big
[5:33] words
[5:34] [Music]
[5:38] in all the
[5:41] rivers of my love.
[5:55] [Music]

[11:46] sister Linda with us. And
[11:52] uh and before we get started, I I just
[11:55] want you to know that uh uh they were uh
[12:00] two of the original founders of our
[12:04] church. Uh many years ago, I was I was
[12:08] 19 years old. Uh, brother Ronnie, you
[12:12] remember when I baptized you and and and
[12:14] how cold it
[12:17] was. And uh, so that has been back 36
[12:22] years ago. And uh, so it's just an honor
[12:26] to have brother Ronnie, sister Linda,
[12:27] they're dear friends of ours. And uh, so
[12:30] thankful that y'all came uh to spend the
[12:33] Mother's Day service with us. Um, okay.

[12:42] We we we want to say that we appreciate
[12:45] all of the work uh from Brother Harry
[12:48] and Sister Khalila. Uh they they've had
[12:51] such a hard job hunting everybody down,
[12:53] getting videos, clipping videos. I think
[12:56] I think uh Sister Kala had 40some videos
[12:59] to clip and to paste together and and um
[13:03] and and and trying to get this all done
[13:05] while the majority of us are gone. So,
[13:08] uh it's it's been quite it's been quite
[13:10] a time, but we we hope that you enjoy uh
[13:14] this that we put together. Why don't we
[13:16] just go to the Lord in prayer and ask
[13:18] his blessings upon our service. Father,
[13:21] we just want to thank you today for your
[13:23] your many blessings and your love to us,
[13:26] Lord. Father, we thank you for the women
[13:28] in our lives, Lord. There is there is
[13:32] nothing that we could say, Lord, to uh
[13:37] uh really express our love for our wives
[13:41] and our mothers and our grandmothers.
[13:44] And I I just pray Lord that you would
[13:46] you would bless them today. Now Lord
[13:49] bless uh our program. Just want you to
[13:52] be Lord uh exalted during it all. Father
[13:57] just ask that you would be pleased with
[14:00] everything that is done and said in
[14:02] Jesus name we pray. Amen. And amen. All
[14:07] right, we're going to we'll start the
[14:08] video
[14:17] there. Happy Mother's Day. We want to
[14:19] thank each of you mamas for everything
[14:21] that you do, for the example that you
[14:24] live for the next generation. We know
[14:26] sometimes you may feel like you haven't
[14:28] done much or sometimes you may even
[14:30] wonder about your purpose, whether
[14:32] you're making a difference in life.
[14:33] Today, we want to remind each of you of
[14:35] some of the ways that you've been used
[14:37] of the Lord and how much your family
[14:39] appreciates you for what you do.
[14:43] If there was one word to describe my
[14:45] mom, that word is amazing. Amazing seems
[14:48] fitting because there's so many other
[14:52] words that you can put with the word
[14:54] amazing to describe something or
[14:56] someone. And that's how I kind I feel
[14:59] about my mom. She's an amazing person.
[15:03] There's not one word that could describe
[15:06] her as a person, as a mom, as a friend.
[15:13] Mom, I hope that you have a wonderful
[15:15] Mother's Day. If only miles were
[15:18] measured in sidewalk squares this
[15:20] weekend so we could spend it together,
[15:23] but I hope you have a wonderful day.
[15:24] Anyway, I love you forever. Mother's Day
[15:28] Mom, sorry we can't be with you today. I
[15:30] hope you have a a wonderful day. Sure
[15:33] love you. Thank you for all you've done
[15:35] for us, boys and family, the church
[15:38] family. Always putting others first
[15:40] before your own needs and and wants. You
[15:44] know, homeschooling us. That's a big
[15:46] task with three hundred boys. I remember
[15:49] getting up late at night, seeing the
[15:51] light in the kitchen, peeking around the
[15:53] corner, you're grading our school, you
[15:55] know, making sure we're ready for the
[15:56] next day. It's always making sure we're
[15:58] we're provided for. Even today, we can't
[16:00] leave your house without toilet paper or
[16:02] water or something that you think we
[16:05] might need. Always putting others first,
[16:07] you know, and that's a quality that that
[16:10] has really stuck with me that that if
[16:13] you put others first, God will reward
[16:15] you and bless you. And another thing,
[16:19] always having a tape playing or as a kid
[16:21] growing up, a tape was always playing,
[16:22] always reading your Bible. I noticed the
[16:25] other day that you've recently got a new
[16:28] Bible you told me about. I think maybe
[16:29] last year or the year before. And I
[16:31] noticed that it's already worn out.
[16:32] Pages are already worn, you know, and
[16:35] you're still you you you're still living
[16:37] that example, putting God first, you
[16:40] know, and so that has always stuck with
[16:43] me, Mom, that that your love for the
[16:45] Lord, love for this message, and and I
[16:48] pray that you just have a wonderful day
[16:50] today. Uh, I think I've got the best
[16:52] mother in the world. And I'm not reading
[16:55] from a script. I I mean, I really mean
[16:57] that from my heart. I've always thought
[16:59] she was the best cook in the world.
[17:00] There's no one can talk mama when it
[17:03] comes to cooking. She's the best nurse
[17:05] in the world. And she didn't even have
[17:06] to go to college uh to learn how to take
[17:09] care of me, but she just knew how to do
[17:12] it. She was a good listener. things that
[17:14] she would say to me to encourage me uh
[17:17] and sometimes even reprimmend me. U you
[17:21] know the these things were stuck in my
[17:25] heart and uh they were a help to me. You
[17:28] know when my mother said you know she'd
[17:30] tell me that she's praying for me. I
[17:32] knew she was praying and I knew it
[17:35] wouldn't just be words, but it would be
[17:37] something that the Lord would be pleased
[17:39] with and would honor him and he would
[17:42] listen. And um she was just the the the
[17:47] best example of
[17:50] motherhood. And I want to just say happy
[17:54] Mother's Day, Mom. I sure love you.
[18:00] Okay. for our family. Yeah, I really
[18:04] like it. Happy Mother's Day, Katrina.
[18:08] Hello. I just want to share a few words
[18:10] about my mom. She is the best role model
[18:13] that there is. She has shown me what
[18:16] true love really is and how to be a
[18:18] great mother, grandmother, sister, and
[18:22] friend. She is the strongest woman I
[18:24] know, and I love every single thing
[18:26] about her.
[18:27] I can only hope that one day I can be
[18:30] half the mother that she has been to
[18:32] me. I thank God for her every day. Love
[18:36] you, Mom. Happy Mother's Day, Mom. Sure
[18:39] appreciate all the hard work and
[18:41] everything that you did in my life to
[18:44] get me where I am today. And um I know
[18:47] road wasn't always easy. you had a lot
[18:49] of kids and whatnot. But appreciate you
[18:51] always making time for me and making
[18:53] sure, you know, I had all the things I
[18:56] needed, you know, and all my name brand
[18:59] clothes and all my, you know, all just
[19:02] everything. You know, I know the
[19:03] sacrifice that you made and appreciated
[19:06] for it and I hope you have a good
[19:08] Mother's Day.
[19:15] Hi, Mom. I just wanted to say thank you
[19:18] for everything you did for me as a kid
[19:20] as far as teaching me how to
[19:22] pray and doing devotions daily and
[19:25] teaching me to be in my Bible and uh
[19:28] laying the groundwork for who I would
[19:30] become in the future. Happy Mother's
[19:33] Day. I love you.
[19:35] I love you, Mom. And I love that you uh
[19:39] take care of us and put us first and
[19:42] stuff and take us to the uh park and
[19:44] give us food and stuff and clothe us.
[19:49] I love you, Mom.
[19:52] I love you, Mom.
[19:55] Say it. Mama,
[20:01] happy Mother's Day.
[20:08] The word that best describes my mother
[20:11] is
[20:12] strong. My mama is not even 5 foot tall,
[20:16] but she's one of the strongest women I
[20:19] know. She has raised five children,
[20:22] including one special needs child. That
[20:26] took an incredible amount of strength to
[20:30] be able to do. And you might not be able
[20:33] to tell by looking at her today, but
[20:35] she's come through some pretty hard
[20:38] trials in life, but she displays her
[20:41] strength so well. And I just want to
[20:44] say, mama, thanks for not killing me
[20:47] when I was a teenager. I love you very
[20:50] much. And I wish you the happiest
[20:53] Mother's Day ever.
[20:57] Thank you, Mom, for homeschooling us and
[20:59] keeping us away from the influences of
[21:02] the public school and all the weirdos
[21:03] that work there. Uh, I know it sounds a
[21:07] struggle, especially with math, but I
[21:09] really appreciate it. Thank you.
[21:10] Especially with reading. Uh, love you,
[21:12] Mom. Happy Mother's Day.
[21:15] Hi, Mom. Just want to take a minute and
[21:17] say happy Mother's Day and thank you for
[21:20] everything you've done and are
[21:22] continuing to do for us. We all love
[21:25] you. Happy Mother. Happy Mother's Day.
[21:29] Hey, Mom. Happy Mother's Day. Um, sure.
[21:32] Love you and I really do appreciate you
[21:34] for all that you do for us and
[21:36] especially for putting up with me and
[21:39] you make the best chicken Alfredo I
[21:41] know. I mean, you make it a lot at
[21:44] events. So, it seems like it's the only
[21:46] thing you know how to make, but it's the
[21:48] best thing you make in my personal
[21:51] opinion. But, I sure do love you. you've
[21:54] taken care of me for this past 19 years
[21:57] and it's been really special to me. Love
[22:00] you.
[22:04] I love you, mama, and you're the best.
[22:07] I love you, mama. You are the best. Mom
[22:10] tell you you're the best. I love you,
[22:13] mama. Happy mother.
[22:17] Mom, I love you. I just want to say I'm
[22:20] thankful for you. I want to say thank
[22:22] you for always not being there for me,
[22:24] not giving up for me. Whenever when I
[22:26] was hitting my rough patches, I want to
[22:29] say thank you for even as an adult,
[22:31] you're always looking out for us and
[22:33] giving me shirts and food and just
[22:36] always making sure that we're taking
[22:37] care of still. I love you and happy
[22:39] Mother's Day.
[22:48] Happy Mother's Day. I love you, mama.
[22:51] Happy Mother's Day, Mom. I just want to
[22:54] say how thankful and appreciative I am
[22:56] for the legacy that you have built
[22:59] through the years of faith and trust in
[23:01] God's word. Uh through your devotion to
[23:04] God and your family, you have eternally
[23:06] impacted all our lives. We are all a
[23:10] product of answered prayers. To this
[23:13] day, I can remember hearing my name in
[23:15] prayer as you wept before God. And not
[23:19] only mine, but all of us siblings and
[23:21] then your grandchildren and then your
[23:23] greatg grandandchildren. And growing up,
[23:26] if you weren't doing chores, which you
[23:29] often were, you were always reading your
[23:32] Bible. And that's never changed. And we
[23:36] are uh we are all a product of your
[23:39] faithfulness to God. And I just pray
[23:43] that we can continue that legacy until
[23:47] Jesus comes. And we we will always be
[23:52] eternally grateful for your stand for
[23:54] Christ and your devotion to this family.
[23:57] I pray that you have a wonderful day.
[23:59] God bless you, Mom. Happy Mother's Day.
[24:03] Thank you for always pushing me to do
[24:06] better. Thank you, Katrina. Happy
[24:08] Mother's Day.
[24:11] Something I've noticed about my mom is
[24:12] that no matter how she's feeling, if
[24:14] she's sick or tired or she doesn't feel
[24:16] like it, she cooks and cleans and takes
[24:18] care of us. And she um organized the
[24:22] exercise class to like bring the ladies
[24:25] for her fellowship.
[24:28] She uh plays pianos all these years and
[24:32] sings um and blesses everybody.
[24:36] Um and she um she
[24:41] lets us keep um the cats.
[24:47] Uh really appreciate my mom. Uh thanks
[24:49] for everything that she's done and you
[24:52] helped us a lot uh getting us going in
[24:54] life and teaching us things, work ethic
[24:56] and stuff like that, getting us through
[24:58] schooling. So really appreciate it and
[25:01] uh uh it's really nice everything that
[25:03] you've done helping on the house and so
[25:05] that me and Rose could get married and
[25:07] things and getting us uh sent off to get
[25:10] started on life. So having a mom like
[25:12] you gets us started on the right foot.
[25:14] Thanks.
[25:16] My mom has really taught me how to enter
[25:18] in the presence of the Lord and stuff
[25:21] and the way that she um like she sings
[25:24] in service, the way that she's like she
[25:27] surreners and she gives her all and um
[25:31] like even when other people don't, she's
[25:33] always like willing to push through. Um
[25:36] I'm super thankful how mama has
[25:39] dedicated her time and effort into
[25:43] everything that she's done. every church
[25:46] function and how she's just taught us
[25:50] how to be servants
[25:52] and taught us just to really help people
[25:56] and
[25:59] stuff. This is Litita. I'm one of Carol
[26:02] Jean's girls. She is strength. She is
[26:05] honor. She is beautiful. She's one of
[26:07] the most helpful women I know. A
[26:10] businesswoman underneath that tough
[26:12] exterior is a gentle, smart, and elegant
[26:15] person. She's God-fearing. She's my
[26:17] prayer warrior. She's my
[26:20] mom. Happy Mother's Day to
[26:24] you. Thank you for this opportunity.
[26:27] A difference my mom did was
[26:31] um there was kids that would come to the
[26:33] house. She would cut their hair and let
[26:36] them spend the night and clean their
[26:38] clothes. always thought it was a little
[26:41] different as a kid, but I know she made
[26:45] a difference in their life. The mom, I
[26:47] appreciate that. I love you very much
[26:51] and happy Mother's Day. Hello. Happy
[26:54] Mother's Day, Mom. I just uh I just want
[26:56] to say I appreciate your willingness to
[26:58] help everyone in the church. Um and I
[27:01] appreciate your testimony and how it's
[27:03] helped me. I'm sure it's helped a lot of
[27:04] people in the church. And uh I think
[27:07] it's pretty cool how you went from being
[27:09] uh in the world and not believing in God
[27:12] really to a Sunday school teacher. And
[27:15] uh I love you. Happy Mother's Day.
[27:22] Love you, mama. Thank you.
[27:26] Sisters and I were discussing what makes
[27:28] our mama unique. And one of the things
[27:32] was that we all agree that she has this
[27:36] quiet
[27:38] strength. And she's probably the meakest
[27:41] redhead that you'll ever meet. But that
[27:44] doesn't mean that she's a pushover. You
[27:45] know, like when it really matters, she
[27:48] will fight for you. And I would even
[27:51] call her a mighty warrior when she's in
[27:54] your corner. And another thing was that
[27:57] we all agreed that she's a nurturer by
[28:00] nature. That she doesn't even have to
[28:02] think about it. She just gives love and
[28:06] comfort and strength to not only her
[28:10] children and grandchildren, but everyone
[28:13] that's around her. She just does it
[28:16] without ever thinking of receiving
[28:19] anything in return.
[28:21] And uh one more
[28:23] quality that we thought was that she's
[28:28] so smart and she's resourceful and she
[28:31] can figure out anything she puts her
[28:33] mind to do. Like she's done she's always
[28:37] helping somebody with something whether
[28:38] it's sewing or gardening or computers or
[28:42] just she doesn't have any limitations on
[28:46] what she can do. And um the last little
[28:50] point is that um that she's a real
[28:53] homemaker and not just in the way that
[28:57] we normally think of it, but in the way
[29:01] that she creates an atmosphere that is
[29:05] warm and welcoming and really makes
[29:08] people feel at home when they're with
[29:11] her. and they kind of chose me to be the
[29:13] little spokesperson
[29:15] um for this. But for on behalf
[29:18] of me and my sisters, I just want to say
[29:21] mom and that we love you and we really
[29:24] don't even know how to express the
[29:27] gratitude and the admiration that we
[29:29] have for you. And we hope you have a
[29:31] wonderful Mother's Day.
[29:59] Wonderful. Are you enjoying yourself so
[30:03] far? You sure love all of you mothers.
[30:08] You love him. Amen. Can you just stand
[30:11] for a minute and help us sing this? God,
[30:12] you're so good to me. God, you're so
[30:16] good
[30:18] to me.
[30:20] You always been so
[30:23] good to me. I'll sing it through
[30:27] eternity.
[30:28] [Music]
[30:30] God, you're so good.
[30:35] God, you're so
[30:38] good to me. You always been so
[30:43] good to me. I'll sing it through
[30:47] eternity.
[30:50] God, you're so good.
[30:53] I'll sing his praises.
[30:57] I'll sing his
[31:01] praises all night long and every day.
[31:07] I stand and worship
[31:11] you. You hold my
[31:15] true God. You're so
[31:19] good to me. You've always been so
[31:23] good to me. I'll sing it through
[31:29] eternity. God, you're so good.
[31:39] Amen. Amen.
[31:52] If I were to choose a word to describe
[31:55] my
[31:56] mom, I think I would choose the word
[32:00] resilient. Uh to be resilient means
[32:03] having the ability to recover quickly
[32:05] and easily from adversity, setbacks or
[32:08] difficulties. being able to adjust to
[32:10] change, withstand stress, and bounce
[32:13] back from challenging situations both
[32:15] emotionally and physically. And I would
[32:18] say that that's my mama in a nutshell.
[32:21] When Jesus was here on earth and he went
[32:24] through all the the struggles and trials
[32:26] and things as a man, he remained the
[32:29] same.
[32:31] And I think I think that's my mama.
[32:35] she um just keeps on loving,
[32:40] giving whether she's hurting, whether
[32:42] she it it she's just the same and I love
[32:45] that about her. One thing that stands
[32:48] out for me is
[32:50] her givingness.
[32:53] Um her selflessness, it seems like she's
[32:57] always willing to do something for
[32:59] somebody, especially her
[33:01] family. Um and us boys, we
[33:05] remember dad always getting upset at mom
[33:09] for cleaning my room when I was living
[33:11] at home. I remember coming home from
[33:14] work, just moving out of the house,
[33:16] coming back home and the house was
[33:18] cleaned, my laundry was washed and
[33:21] folded, there was dishes cleaned, you
[33:23] know, she was just
[33:26] always willing to give. And I never felt
[33:30] unloved by her. She always went up and
[33:32] beyond to make sure that her family, her
[33:35] boys knew that we were loved by her.
[33:38] Mom, I appreciate
[33:39] that. I wouldn't be here today. I
[33:43] wouldn't have the family that I have
[33:44] today if it wasn't for your love, your
[33:47] dedication, your devotion to this
[33:49] family, and most of all to the Lord. So,
[33:52] thank you for all that you've done for
[33:53] us. We sure love you, Mom. Happy
[33:56] Mother's Day.
[33:59] I appreciate you teaching me how to do
[34:02] my little
[34:04] I appreciate you doing school with
[34:07] us. Sus, what do you appreciate
[34:16] and mama? You appreciate mama. Okay.
[34:21] Happy Mother's Day. Happy Mother's Day.
[34:24] And
[34:25] I have such wonderful memories of my
[34:28] mother. And I realize that I'm a little
[34:31] biased, but to me, she was the mother of
[34:34] mothers. My my mom was
[34:38] shy and soft,
[34:41] uh, tender and a bit quiet.
[34:44] But my mother also had a very strong
[34:48] mind and a tough faith about her which
[34:52] made her so
[34:54] resilient and um she wasn't a pushover
[34:57] at all. She stood flatfooted upon her
[34:59] convictions and us kids knew exactly
[35:02] where she stood. You know she was able
[35:06] to withstand adversity.
[35:09] She stood by my dad through many
[35:13] difficulties and and yet she was able to
[35:16] keep her gentleness about her. And I
[35:18] guess that's probably something that has
[35:22] stood out to me and and been something
[35:25] that I have strived for in my adult
[35:28] life. And she was dad's biggest uh
[35:31] supporter in ministry. um whichever way
[35:34] dad the Lord led dad, she was going to
[35:37] back him up in prayer and in
[35:40] praise.
[35:42] And there was not a day that went by
[35:44] that as kids did not know uh mama's love
[35:48] for us. My friends were always welcomed
[35:51] by her. She always took the time to
[35:54] listen to to us siblings and to our
[35:59] friends. She'd listen to anybody. and um
[36:03] prayed with us all. And I I but I think
[36:06] the thing that stands out the most about
[36:08] my mother is is her devotion to God. She
[36:11] was a dedicated prayer warrior. Spent
[36:14] hours of time in prayer. She still
[36:17] stands out in the crowd today. She's
[36:19] just a very graceful lady. Um and she's
[36:23] still the same beautiful, graceful woman
[36:26] that I've known all of my life. And I
[36:29] love her very, very much.
[36:33] Happy Mother's Day,
[36:36] mama. I love you.
[36:43] You done the best.
[36:47] Happy Mother's Day to Betha. Thanks for
[36:50] being the best mother-in-law and loving
[36:51] me like one of your own. Happy Mother's
[36:54] Day, Mom. Thank you for all your
[36:56] patience growing up and your help with
[36:58] my schoolwork
[37:00] projects. I know I forgot to tell you
[37:02] till the last minute most times. Love
[37:04] you. Happy Mother's Day. Happy Mother's
[37:07] Day, Mom. I just wanted to pop on here
[37:09] real quick and say how much I love you
[37:10] and how much we appreciate you and thank
[37:13] you so much um for showing us what a
[37:15] godly mother is to look like. And
[37:18] through your actions, always just
[37:19] showing us how you love us and how a
[37:23] godly mother should be. And we love you
[37:25] and we hope you have a wonderful rest of
[37:27] your Mother's Day. Happy Mother's Day.
[37:32] Happy Mother's Day, Mom. Really
[37:34] appreciate all you do. Um, I just want
[37:38] to thank you for all the times growing
[37:41] up that you show us to work. Remember,
[37:43] you always working at the church as we
[37:45] were little kids and um just really
[37:48] showing us that you don't have to be
[37:52] always in the front line. You can be
[37:54] behind the scenes and still get the work
[37:57] done. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to say
[38:00] happy Mother's Day and we really
[38:02] appreciate you. Hey, Mom. Happy Mother's
[38:05] Day. Love you. Miss you. Wish we could
[38:08] be there with you today. Um, just want
[38:11] to say we appreciate you and thanks for
[38:14] raising us right. Have a good day. Love
[38:18] you. Hi, Grandma. Happy Mother's Day. I
[38:22] love you so, so much. I just want to let
[38:25] you know that I don't know where I would
[38:26] be in life without you. You've always
[38:29] shown me and our boys unconditional
[38:31] love. You're the best grandma I could
[38:33] ever ask for. I love you, Grandma.
[38:38] Here, Manny was my life at the end of
[38:41] the tunnel. She took me to church camp
[38:45] meetings, church meetings, and that's
[38:49] how I used to be the best because she
[38:52] took me places. So, if it wasn't for
[38:56] her, I don't know where I would be
[38:59] today, but I love you aunt Betty. A
[39:04] happy I just want to say thank you to my
[39:07] mom for everything that she's done for
[39:09] us and what she's taught us.
[39:12] Um, she was always a hard worker and she
[39:16] taught me and my sister to be the same
[39:18] way. and everything that she taught us
[39:21] when we were little shaped not just our
[39:23] childhood but also has affected the way
[39:26] that we care for our families today and
[39:29] what we do to provide for our children.
[39:31] And we just want to say thank you and we
[39:33] love you. One thing about a praying
[39:37] mom, life is miserable until you
[39:40] surrender. I love you, Mom. Thanks for
[39:42] never giving up on me.
[39:44] Happy Mother's Day, Mom. I just want to
[39:47] say how much I appreciate you and love
[39:51] you from the depths of my heart. You
[39:54] mean so much to me. Thank you so much
[39:56] for being a role model for me, being a a
[40:00] wife, um a
[40:03] mom, and most of all a good Christian
[40:09] lady. You're you've always just the way
[40:12] you've prayed. I've always wish I could
[40:14] be like that. your prayer life, your
[40:16] unwavering faith. I've just always
[40:19] looked up to you and as they say, you
[40:22] know, that song to be like Jesus, if I
[40:25] could just, you know, I see Jesus in you
[40:28] so much. If I could just be like my
[40:31] mom. So, thank you so much for always
[40:34] being my friend.
[40:36] you've uh always stood by my side and my
[40:42] shopping buddy and bailed me out of so
[40:45] many
[40:48] uh things I get myself
[40:50] into, helping me. So, I sure love you.
[40:55] You mean a lot. I hope you have a good
[40:57] day and I wish I could be there to
[41:00] celebrate you.
[41:03] Hey, and sure do love you and I really
[41:06] do appreciate you. And for these past 19
[41:08] years, you have brought a sort of
[41:10] antique craziness to my life and I sure
[41:13] do love you for it. And I do remember as
[41:16] kids, we would go to the doughnut shop
[41:17] early in the morning and that was kind
[41:19] of our thing. And I'd sure love some
[41:21] more donuts. But uh this time I'll
[41:24] probably have to take you. But I really
[41:27] do appreciate you and you've been the
[41:29] best ant that you can be and I love you
[41:31] for it.
[42:19] should have this
[42:21] prepared. If you know this this song,
[42:24] just help us
[42:26] uh help us sing it. I believe this is
[42:28] all of our our prayer for you mothers on
[42:31] Mother's
[42:34] Day. Lord bless
[42:37] [Music]
[42:39] you and keep

[46:12] amen.
[46:16] Amen.
[46:19] [Music]
[46:24] Amen. Amen. Amen. And that's our our
[46:28] prayer for you sisters. We've uh we've
[46:32] also we uh we've got a one more video
[46:34] that we want to do. We've asked some of
[46:35] the elders to uh elder sisters if they
[46:39] had a word of u encouragement or some uh
[46:42] some of their u their testimonies or
[46:46] things they'd like to say. And so u we
[46:49] appreciate you you sisters adding to it
[46:52] today. And so Clea, if you wouldn't mind
[46:55] playing
[47:06] that. First, I'd like to tell all my
[47:09] sweet sisters in Christ, happy Mother's
[47:11] Day. You guys are wonderful and great.
[47:14] And I'd like to share a couple
[47:16] experiences that I had being a mother of
[47:19] young children when we were living in
[47:22] Minnesota.
[47:23] And Robbie was five and I had stair
[47:26] steps of course. So I'm tagging along
[47:29] six kids in a snowstorm trying to get
[47:32] home and we got caught in a white out
[47:36] and it became drastic real fast and the
[47:40] temperature was like -60 outside and our
[47:43] car gave out on us and out of my
[47:47] 5-year-old's mouth said, "Mama, we have
[47:49] got to pray." and we stopped and we
[47:53] prayed. And I wasn't even a Christian at
[47:55] that time, but he told me we needed to
[47:57] pray. And we prayed and it wasn't but
[48:00] about 30 minutes, somebody was knocking
[48:02] on the window and it was a rescue squad
[48:04] to pick us up and get us where we're
[48:06] safe. Another experience that um I can
[48:10] remember is I was feeling really bad
[48:14] that I wasn't being a good mom. I wasn't
[48:16] being a perfect mom. I wasn't taking
[48:18] good enough care of my kids. And I was
[48:20] really, really doubting myself. And I
[48:23] had a pediatrician appointment with
[48:25] three of them that were sick at the
[48:27] time. And I was just stressed out,
[48:29] exhausted, tired. And I got to the
[48:33] pediatrician. Of course, we all know
[48:35] when we get our kids all cleaned up,
[48:37] nice and spotless to go to the doctor,
[48:39] by the time they get there, they're
[48:41] filthy. And I got in there and I got
[48:44] back to see the pediatrician and he said
[48:47] something and I just burst into tears.
[48:50] because I was just an imperfect mom and
[48:52] couldn't do nothing right with my
[48:54] children. And he looked at me and he
[48:57] says, "Whose children are these? These
[48:59] are your children. I will give you a key
[49:02] to help you raise these kids." And he
[49:05] says, "Every morning when your children
[49:07] wake up, give them a hug and tell them
[49:09] that you love them and Jesus loves them.
[49:12] And every time they go to bed at night,
[49:15] you give them a hug and tell them that
[49:17] you love them and Jesus loves them. It
[49:20] wasn't long until I was hearing Jesus
[49:22] loves you all through the day and
[49:24] getting hugs for my kids. And that just
[49:27] really boosted me boosted me up. So
[49:30] never get
[49:31] discouraged and keep your heads up. It
[49:34] is tough being a mom, even tougher these
[49:36] days. But the Lord loves you. And if at
[49:39] any time you feel discouraged, turn to
[49:41] one of your sisters in Christ or turn to
[49:44] the Bible and God will give you the
[49:46] wisdom that you
[49:48] need. I would like to start out as
[49:51] saying that the Lord has never ever let
[49:53] me down. He's always been my friend.
[49:56] I've been
[49:58] through a lot of trials, but God has
[50:01] always been right there with me through
[50:04] every trial. You got to learn to totally
[50:08] depend upon the Lord through everything.
[50:11] Through your children, your family, your
[50:13] husband, your walk with God, everything.
[50:17] That's what I did. I just totally leaned
[50:19] on
[50:20] God. I know you all know a lot
[50:24] about Joe
[50:26] and but no one knows the trials that I
[50:30] went through through this hard time with
[50:33] Joe. the times that I didn't know if I
[50:37] would wake up to him being dead or him
[50:41] calling through the night or the police
[50:44] knocking on my door. But God was always
[50:47] faithful. He always always was
[50:51] faithful. Mothers, please love your
[50:55] children. Teach them about
[50:58] God. Read to them. Show them scriptures.
[51:01] Show them the scriptures. Not just read,
[51:03] show them the scriptures in the word,
[51:05] what the Bible says. Let them know how
[51:09] much God loves them and how much God
[51:12] that how real God is. You
[51:15] know, I wish I could have done better
[51:18] than I did with when I my children was
[51:21] younger. I just can't tell you enough
[51:23] through all of my life. I've gone
[51:24] through a lot of things, different
[51:26] things in my life, but I can never say
[51:30] God let me down cuz he never has let me
[51:34] down. God bless
[51:37] you. I'd like to share with mothers a
[51:41] little
[51:42] thought
[51:43] that we think we have to make the
[51:46] biggest difference in our children's
[51:48] lives by doing big things. But really
[51:50] what it comes down to is all the million
[51:52] little things. Little things that you
[51:55] will do and not realize what a
[51:58] difference it makes in that child's
[52:00] life. I've had one of my
[52:04] daughter-in-laws say to me one day about
[52:07] how I listen to
[52:09] her and just let
[52:12] her vent, talk, or whatever.
[52:16] Um, she said her own mother didn't do
[52:20] that. And um, I didn't realize I had
[52:24] actually done that. And pray about
[52:27] everything. Just like you would talk to
[52:30] somebody in your family or your husband,
[52:33] even talk to the Lord like that. And you
[52:36] might say, "Well, I don't have time to
[52:38] be down on my knees praying." No, you
[52:42] have lots of time. Sister Brandham said
[52:45] she would pray ironing while she was
[52:48] ironing. And you know, back in that day,
[52:51] we didn't have permanent press. So, you
[52:54] ironed everything. She would spend that
[52:57] time ironing, praying for people and
[52:59] praying for her husband. And I know
[53:02] myself, you know, I'm going down the
[53:04] road in the car. Um, try not to worry
[53:08] because God can't work with worry. He
[53:10] works with you trusting him.
[53:14] you make
[53:15] your needs known to him and just trust
[53:19] that he's your father and he will hear
[53:23] you and work it all out for your good.
[53:26] When it comes to the children and even
[53:29] like discipline, uh I've had to learn
[53:32] that you got to pick your battles. You
[53:35] can't stress on every little thing. You
[53:37] got to remember you don't want to crush
[53:39] that child's spirit. You don't want to
[53:42] offend their guardian angel. We've all
[53:45] made
[53:46] mistakes. Uh I've made a lot of mistakes
[53:49] and I've told my children already, you
[53:52] know, that I'm
[53:54] sorry. Don't be the parent that's above
[53:58] saying you're sorry to your children
[53:59] about something. Happy Mother's Day,
[54:02] ladies.
[54:04] uh being a mother and a wife was my
[54:07] lifelong dream before it happened and
[54:09] the Lord blessed me with that
[54:10] opportunity and it has been my greatest
[54:13] joy and calling in life even though it
[54:15] has been hard at
[54:17] times. I just wanted to encourage you
[54:21] mothers that even in the hard times God
[54:24] can send you help. When I first got
[54:28] married, my mom moved out of state. And
[54:31] so the Lord provided me with two ladies
[54:35] that helped me tremendously. Merl's aunt
[54:38] Nonnie and my aunt Linda with so I could
[54:42] call to get all my questions answered.
[54:45] And we have a lot of ladies in this
[54:46] church who can answer y'all's questions
[54:48] if you have them.
[54:51] And I also wanted to let you know that
[54:54] no child and no parent is
[54:57] alike. You cannot compare yourself with
[55:01] others. You see all these things on the
[55:04] internet of these perfect families and
[55:07] all the stuff but you do not see the
[55:09] whole picture. It is not true. Everybody
[55:12] has their problems.
[55:14] We just have to trust God that he will
[55:17] give us the ability to deal with our
[55:19] own. I think he designed it that way so
[55:22] we would depend on him. There's no set
[55:26] way. So, we have to depend on him to
[55:27] make the right
[55:29] decisions. But, uh, I wanted y'all to
[55:32] know that you shouldn't be
[55:34] so hard on yourselves. I know it's easy
[55:38] to think that you're not doing this
[55:40] right and that you're a failure.
[55:44] and all this. But God sees your
[55:47] willingness and even if you make
[55:49] mistakes, he can turn those mistakes
[55:52] into good and teach your children
[55:54] lessons for life.
[55:57] And I just wanted to remind y'all that
[55:59] even though it seems hard right now and
[56:03] uh sometimes you think I can't do this
[56:07] or whatever, eventually you will miss
[56:11] those times cuz you won't always have
[56:14] those kids at
[56:15] home. And it's just a major major thing
[56:20] whenever you realize I wish I had that
[56:23] back. that I wanted to wish y'all a
[56:26] happy Mother's Day. Love you all.
[56:29] Have so many stories and references to
[56:34] what the Lord has done for me in my life
[56:38] and my children's lives that um I'd
[56:41] probably have to say if you're
[56:43] interested to come and talk to me about
[56:46] them. But the one that comes to mind
[56:49] right now would be the
[56:52] uh I rely totally on the book of James
[56:56] that's talks about trials and and how to
[56:59] act in trials and how to treat trials
[57:02] because there are building
[57:04] blocks and the story that goes with it
[57:07] for me is
[57:09] um Leita was 12 months old when I was
[57:13] diagnosed with cancer that and they told
[57:16] me I had a here to
[57:17] live. And I kept asking myself, not God,
[57:22] um, how do I watch these three little
[57:25] girls grow up and graduate from school
[57:29] and get married and become moms in a
[57:32] year?
[57:34] So my prayers and my going into the
[57:38] Bible and reading everything that that I
[57:41] could about trials and about prayer was
[57:45] um not for me but for my girls. I relied
[57:49] on prayer so much that that's what I
[57:52] want to tell you young mothers. Pray
[57:55] unceasingly. Pray every day. Pray while
[57:59] you're having good days and bad days and
[58:03] do it all. I just thank God. I thank God
[58:07] for each and every one of you. I love
[58:09] you. God bless you. And I thank you
[58:12] again in Jesus name.
[58:17] Amen.
[58:21] Well, did you enjoy enjoy that today?
[58:29] We are so thankful for the difference
[58:31] that that you mothers make and um and I
[58:36] thought it was special uh putting these
[58:38] this video here together and um we we
[58:42] didn't Sister Clea was worried about it
[58:44] being too long and and uh I said we'll
[58:48] just we'll just break it up with a few
[58:50] songs and I I think it's important to to
[58:53] have it all in there and Um, and I think
[58:57] I I sure appreciate um everyone who has
[59:02] made this possible. I'd like to just
[59:04] speak to you for a a few moments this
[59:07] morning. And um uh Proverbs 31 and 30
[59:12] says, "Favor is
[59:14] deceitful, beauty is vain, but a woman
[59:18] that fearth the Lord, she shall be
[59:21] praised. give her of the fruit of her
[59:24] hands and let her own works praise her
[59:27] in the
[59:29] gates. And uh as we as as the theme uh
[59:34] for this for the uh today's uh program
[59:38] was is you know making a difference and
[59:42] um I I think that there is there is no
[59:47] one that can make a difference in
[59:49] today's
[59:50] society like a godly mother. And
[59:53] something that is missing in our society
[59:55] are mothers. And um we have I think I
[1:00:01] think the the women's um liberation
[1:00:05] movement has has moved the pendulum so
[1:00:09] far off center that even they are um
[1:00:15] they are recontemplating things. as you
[1:00:18] look on the internet and you you read
[1:00:22] some of these who have who were a part
[1:00:25] of the feminist movement and and now
[1:00:29] there are a lot of those that are not
[1:00:32] mothers. They have uh pushed their
[1:00:34] career and they have uh really promoted
[1:00:39] uh you know their achievements and
[1:00:43] they've left motherhood behind and there
[1:00:44] are many of them you can find it on the
[1:00:46] internet. They're they're saying we miss
[1:00:48] the boat. We we miss the boat. We're
[1:00:50] old. We don't have a family. Um we we
[1:00:55] we've at the end of the day, we're not
[1:00:57] there's nothing there to um to to make
[1:01:01] us fulfilled. And a lot of these had
[1:01:03] reached the pinnacle making a lots of
[1:01:05] money. And so I I I want to say there is
[1:01:09] there is a it's a calling being a
[1:01:11] mother. and and the uh someone had had
[1:01:16] asked one time uh a kid a child was was
[1:01:20] asking you know how how do you spell
[1:01:23] mother and and my response was l o v e
[1:01:28] amen and uh they said that don't spell
[1:01:32] mother and and uh I said love spells
[1:01:36] mama mama is the epitome of of love and
[1:01:40] so it describes our love. And I I I
[1:01:44] think the most beautiful sight is a man
[1:01:46] is a mother that's reflecting love to
[1:01:49] her child
[1:01:51] because a father is a strong man. He is
[1:01:56] he is one that is that is uh got to go
[1:01:59] out and and he's a protector. He's a
[1:02:03] provider. Amen. He he is uh one that is
[1:02:07] built with broad shoulders and and he
[1:02:10] reflects a portion of God. He reflects
[1:02:13] the determination of God, the leadership
[1:02:16] of God, the strong characteristics of
[1:02:18] God. But but when it come to the
[1:02:21] tenderness of God, when it come to the
[1:02:25] divine love and the mercies and the
[1:02:28] compassions, God is is expressed through
[1:02:31] a woman. God's expressed through those
[1:02:34] tenderness that that a woman has. And
[1:02:38] yes, God has it. Amen. In God is
[1:02:42] expressed through her her tenderness,
[1:02:44] through her her her tears, her tears of
[1:02:47] joy, her her courage, her her relentless
[1:02:51] love and compassion for her family. the
[1:02:55] the uh what seems to be just a constant
[1:03:00] uh and and a fulfillment of her calling
[1:03:04] and and doing it even effortlessly. you
[1:03:06] know, no, no, no limelight, no big
[1:03:10] achievement awards, no big paychecks, no
[1:03:14] uh none of these uh uh things where
[1:03:17] they, you know, two two week, three
[1:03:19] week, four-week paid vacation where you
[1:03:21] take a where you take a break uh from
[1:03:24] your work. you mothers, there there's
[1:03:27] there's only one thing that can that can
[1:03:31] truly express
[1:03:33] um who you are, and that's love. You you
[1:03:37] love, you give. It's in a constant
[1:03:39] basis. Uh I when I go to work in the
[1:03:42] morning time, I I I'm I'm I'm home at 5
[1:03:46] 6 o'lock. Amen. And I don't I don't want
[1:03:49] to bring the work home with me. I want
[1:03:50] to come home and I want to I I I'm
[1:03:53] leaving the job. I'm coming home. I I I
[1:03:56] want to be free of that. But a mother,
[1:03:59] uh uh uh it's it's day and night. And I
[1:04:03] I I want you children. I I know there's
[1:04:05] a lot of uh families there there's
[1:04:07] families that are missing here today,
[1:04:08] but and and children, but I you you
[1:04:11] children that are here, how blessed you
[1:04:15] are to have a mother, a mother that's
[1:04:19] that's there uh in your night times when
[1:04:22] you're sick or when you're having a bad
[1:04:24] dream or everything about you. Amen.
[1:04:28] mother is involved in so many areas and
[1:04:31] I think that we need to uh uh love and
[1:04:34] appreciate our mothers. Can I hear an
[1:04:37] amen? I I think you I think you brothers
[1:04:40] ought to appreciate your wives. Amen.
[1:04:43] The the the love that your wife has had
[1:04:46] because your your your wife, Amen, she's
[1:04:51] really the backbone of your family.
[1:04:54] She's the magnet. He's the glue that
[1:04:56] keeps that family together. Um even even
[1:05:00] in the um um e even as as as you get
[1:05:04] older like my mother and father, my
[1:05:06] mother is still a magnet to all of us
[1:05:09] siblings and to our our grandchildren
[1:05:12] and and and it and it's something that
[1:05:14] God has specifically put and it's hard
[1:05:18] to do. And this is where the feminist
[1:05:20] movement has has missed the boat because
[1:05:23] they've taken they've taken the the the
[1:05:27] the true energy away from the family
[1:05:31] when they have taken the woman out of
[1:05:34] the home and and put her in the
[1:05:36] workplace because it's the family it's
[1:05:40] the family that really matters. Jobs are
[1:05:42] going to come and go. Amen. and and and
[1:05:46] you know 20 years from now um our robots
[1:05:49] may be doing all of the jobs. And so uh
[1:05:52] we but we we want we we the the family
[1:05:57] can only exist as long as there's
[1:06:02] motherhood. Nobody can take that place.
[1:06:06] Nobody can take your place. I I uh I
[1:06:10] heard a story uh or I read a story and I
[1:06:13] thought it was cute. An elementary
[1:06:15] school teacher had been teaching the
[1:06:17] children on magnets and and uh and the
[1:06:20] positive and negative ends of a magnets,
[1:06:23] you know, and and and how it picks
[1:06:25] things up and and it's the force inside
[1:06:28] a magnet to pick things up and and it's
[1:06:30] spelled with six letters, you know. And
[1:06:32] so, uh, after a while, the teacher
[1:06:35] wanted to give the students a test and
[1:06:37] and so she she threw in a little
[1:06:39] questions and he says, she says, "Spell
[1:06:41] something that that has six letters,
[1:06:45] starts with an M, and picks things up."
[1:06:48] And and 50% of the class wrote mother.
[1:06:53] Amen. Now, now she was looking for
[1:06:56] magnet, but 50% of the class wrote
[1:07:01] mother. It's it's something that that
[1:07:03] you are doing. I I read a statistic um
[1:07:07] uh you know or the on stay-at-home moms
[1:07:12] and and how they come up with with with
[1:07:14] their um uh their numbers, I don't know,
[1:07:17] but they they say that the the
[1:07:19] stay-at-home mom works over 96 hours per
[1:07:23] week. and um she's chef, housekeeper,
[1:07:28] nurse, custodian, teacher, financial
[1:07:31] manager, and million other things. And
[1:07:36] they said if she was fairly compensated
[1:07:38] for her labors, she would make at least
[1:07:41] in in today's in today's wages, she
[1:07:44] would wake at a minimum
[1:07:48] $119,000 per year if a mother was
[1:07:51] compensated. So, uh, I I I want to I
[1:07:55] just want to say you you uh you you
[1:07:58] brothers are getting off pretty uh Amen.
[1:08:01] You're getting off pretty pretty good.
[1:08:03] Amen. So, you mothers are important.
[1:08:08] Amen. Mothers are important. I think I
[1:08:11] think days like this here and and just
[1:08:13] having a you know uh a days where we
[1:08:16] where we honor you mothers is important.
[1:08:19] And we we put these days aside because
[1:08:21] we want you to know we genuinely love
[1:08:26] every one of you women in our church. I
[1:08:28] thank God for every one of you sisters
[1:08:32] in our church. Amen. The the the prophet
[1:08:35] would say the backbone of any nation is
[1:08:39] womanhood. And when it comes down to
[1:08:42] morals, you break motherhood, you've
[1:08:45] broke your nation. motherhood broken,
[1:08:49] you might as well just fold up. And all
[1:08:52] of the other nations have done it. And
[1:08:54] ours is no exception. Motherhood is a
[1:08:58] must. Womanhood is a must. Can you say
[1:09:01] amen? Amen. So, as we look, I I think
[1:09:05] that that brothers, it's important that
[1:09:09] we invest into our ladies and not just
[1:09:12] invest into our ladies on a on on
[1:09:16] special days like Mother's Day or their
[1:09:19] birthday, but it's important that we
[1:09:22] invest into our ladies on a daily basis.
[1:09:26] Amen. Now, remember, you're leaving at
[1:09:29] 6:00 and getting home at 5:00. Amen. And
[1:09:33] and and your wife has more than likely
[1:09:35] got your lunch together or or sent you
[1:09:38] off or Amen. Um uh and if she's really
[1:09:42] good to you, she might she might even
[1:09:44] fix your breakfast. Amen. Uh uh but you
[1:09:48] know but you've got your uh but but you
[1:09:52] know it won't be another hour or two and
[1:09:54] and she'll be up and uh and the kids
[1:09:57] will make sure that she's up and and and
[1:10:00] they're going to need to be fed and
[1:10:02] they're going to need to to be dressed
[1:10:04] and they're all going to need to have
[1:10:06] their schooling and and there's going to
[1:10:09] be activities throughout the day and and
[1:10:11] and and mama is I listen I I have tried
[1:10:15] Right. I love kids and I, you know, I I
[1:10:18] love having kids around, but there are
[1:10:19] sometimes these kids get on my nerves
[1:10:22] and I'm so glad they've got mamas. Amen.
[1:10:25] And uh uh but but the the these mamas
[1:10:30] have no other place to go. They they
[1:10:32] they are
[1:10:35] there

[1:10:40] 365 days out of the year with those
[1:10:44] children.
[1:10:46] Amen. Can I can I get any uh part class

[1:11:08] belittled. I I want to tell you we we
[1:11:10] need the dads. But this ain't Father's
[1:11:12] Day. This is Mother's Day. Amen. and and
[1:11:15] mothers standing men. If you've got
[1:11:18] women that are loving you and that are
[1:11:22] training your children, you should never

[1:11:29] Amen. Now, you you don't always feel
[1:11:33] pretty. She don't always feel Listen,
[1:11:36] Amen. with those kids chasing her and
[1:11:38] running her all over the place and and

[1:11:44] diaper and and this teenager's mouthing
[1:11:47] her and we've got every other thing

[1:11:53] to know that she's got some backup when
[1:11:57] you get
[1:11:58] home. She needs to know that dad is in
[1:12:02] her corner. Can I hear an amen?
[1:12:06] Amen. Women are the weaker vessel. They
[1:12:10] are Amen. They they are that one that
[1:12:13] has been called to nurture and
[1:12:17] strengthen your children and to teach
[1:12:20] your children. But you men must never
[1:12:24] ever forget that once she has spent all
[1:12:27] of her love and it and and and and she
[1:12:30] has given out of her love tank over and
[1:12:33] over and
[1:12:35] over, that love tank's got to be filled
[1:12:38] back up.
[1:12:40] Love. Well, hallelujah. Now, I know this

[1:14:24] and and you're not having to go out and
[1:14:26] do this and the other. You are blessed.
[1:14:28] And I want to say once again, brothers,
[1:14:32] investing love back into your family is
[1:14:37] important.
[1:14:40] Amen. I found as a young man, amen, that
[1:14:45] I can make my wife bitter and I can make
[1:14:48] my wife lovely and I've done many
[1:14:52] things. I've acted many ways that that
[1:14:55] have hurt her, scarred her and and and
[1:14:58] have even she's fought bitterness from
[1:15:02] the guy that really does love her. And
[1:15:04] the reason why is because this numb
[1:15:07] skull here thought that I just knew how
[1:15:10] to handle it all and I wasn't trying to
[1:15:13] think the thoughts of a woman.
[1:15:15] Hallelujah. It's dangerous going there.
[1:15:17] It is dangerous. But I am saying
[1:15:20] sometimes you've got to walk in your
[1:15:24] wife's footsteps. You've got to try to
[1:15:28] think her thoughts. And if you
[1:15:31] understand her, at least put your heart
[1:15:34] out there to understand her, you're
[1:15:36] you're going to have a woman, a man, who
[1:15:40] who is who who is smiling and who loves
[1:15:44] you and who is giving back to you and
[1:15:47] she'll Well, praise the Lord. Can you
[1:15:50] say amen? Hallelujah. Now, I know I know
[1:15:53] some men that is just constantly putting
[1:15:55] their wives down. I I know them. I mean,
[1:15:57] they're just constantly she's just this
[1:16:00] and and and you don't see her his wife
[1:16:01] smiling to very often. I I I I've seen
[1:16:04] those guys that those Amen. And and and
[1:16:07] I' and I've tried to pull them off to
[1:16:08] the side and some of them are elders.
[1:16:09] And I've tried to tell them, listen, if
[1:16:11] you want your girl to smile, you're
[1:16:13] going to have to crit quit your
[1:16:14] criticizing your girl and let her know
[1:16:18] that you're glad to have you her as your
[1:16:21] helpmate.
[1:16:24] Hallelujah. Now y'all's wishing I would
[1:16:27] have just followed my script but I just
[1:16:28] decided to preach. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:16:31] Amen. So giving w giving the honor to
[1:16:37] your wife. The scripture says amen. Uh
[1:16:40] uh wives love your husbands. Amen. And
[1:16:43] and husbands honor. Give that honor that
[1:16:48] love that nurture back to your wife.
[1:16:51] It's important. If we want the children,
[1:16:55] if we want our children to be satisfied
[1:16:58] and healthy, they need mamas. If we want
[1:17:02] mamas to be healthy, they need husbands
[1:17:06] that are on their side.
[1:17:09] Ain't chasing girls, ain't looking at
[1:17:12] pornography, ain't going out there
[1:17:14] chasing skirts. These are men that love
[1:17:17] their wives and their wives know that
[1:17:20] they are everything to them.
[1:17:27] Amen.
[1:17:29] Now, I know there's a lot of temptations
[1:17:31] out there. Hallelujah. There's a lot of
[1:17:33] temptations out there. There there's a
[1:17:36] lot of those hussies out there that that
[1:17:38] that want to split the marriage up and
[1:17:40] to steal the affection of you husbands.
[1:17:43] But I say in the name of the Lord, if
[1:17:45] you don't understand the importance of
[1:17:48] your family and the importance of your
[1:17:50] wife, you could lose your children
[1:17:53] because of it.
[1:17:55] We don't want to lose our children to
[1:17:58] the world or to
[1:18:00] hell. We want to raise them in the fear
[1:18:02] of the Lord. And I want to tell you,
[1:18:05] amen, the one that stops between them
[1:18:08] many, many, many, most of the time is
[1:18:11] going to be your woman.
[1:18:15] She's the one that's with them.
[1:18:18] Amen.
[1:18:19] Brother Brandham said he was given he's
[1:18:22] given a little story. He said, "I just
[1:18:24] talking a few moments ago to a young
[1:18:26] lady is discouraged, heartbroken. I was
[1:18:29] trying to tell her uh that that a a
[1:18:32] woman and a man are not separated.
[1:18:34] They're the self-same person. God made
[1:18:37] man both male and female. He was man.
[1:18:39] That's right. He separated them in the
[1:18:41] flesh and made them difference but
[1:18:44] joined them together in raising their
[1:18:46] children as one. So the man the mer the
[1:18:49] burly and the to and the woman is the
[1:18:52] love part of man. So they are together.
[1:18:55] God separated them but they are both the
[1:18:58] same person. M a n uh and and woman is
[1:19:02] called womb. Woman. Amen. That that's
[1:19:04] right. You know that because she was
[1:19:07] taken from man. She is a part of man. In
[1:19:11] in in life here in flesh they are
[1:19:13] separate but in spirit they are one. Was
[1:19:16] talking about men losing their affection
[1:19:18] for their wife and don't love them as
[1:19:21] they did when they were
[1:19:23] sweethearts. Shame on you. You ought to
[1:19:27] do it. She's always to be your
[1:19:31] sweetheart.
[1:19:34] Well, am I are we doing all right here?
[1:19:37] Hallelujah. Have I still got an audience
[1:19:39] here? Amen. She's always to be your
[1:19:42] sweetheart. Amen.
[1:19:45] Amen. Now, he said, "Absolutely. That's
[1:19:49] the part she should be. And you should
[1:19:51] treat her like that." Oh, never let that
[1:19:54] little honeymoon cease cuz it isn't
[1:19:57] going to in heaven going to be just
[1:20:00] perfectly. Amen. And so I I want to say
[1:20:03] I I want to have heaven here on earth.
[1:20:09] I got to tell you, I got to tell you, my
[1:20:11] wife, Amen, doesn't wear the the same
[1:20:14] size clothes she wore when we got
[1:20:17] married. Amen. And I don't wear my hair
[1:20:20] the way I did when she married me. Amen.
[1:20:24] And and uh uh there's a lot of things
[1:20:27] that have changed, but I tell you what,
[1:20:29] she is more beautiful today than than I
[1:20:32] I I love her more and think she's more
[1:20:34] beautiful today than the day that I met
[1:20:35] her. Yes, sir. You say, "Wow." Amen.
[1:20:40] Hallelujah. I I heard I heard an old man
[1:20:43] say one time, he said, "Those young men,
[1:20:44] they're they're looking for the you
[1:20:46] know, you boys probably don't remember
[1:20:47] it, but they, you know, the the old 16o
[1:20:50] Coke bottles." Amen. They were He says,
[1:20:52] "The the teenagers are looking for the
[1:20:54] 16 ounce Coke bottles." And he he says,
[1:20:57] Perry Green has said this, but so I
[1:20:59] guess it's okay to repeat it. He says,
[1:21:02] "I don't see nothing wrong with a 2L
[1:21:04] myself." Amen. Hallelujah. And uh
[1:21:07] there's more in the 2 liter bottles than
[1:21:09] there is the 16 ounce. And and you you
[1:21:12] get your Well, praise the Lord. You get
[1:21:15] your you get yourself Amen. Uh uh you
[1:21:19] quenches your thirst. And so you're
[1:21:21] going to find out that as I if you've
[1:21:24] got a spirit on you that's chasing these
[1:21:27] girls around all the time and you're
[1:21:29] chasing forms and figures, you you don't
[1:21:32] you're not going to realize it. You're
[1:21:34] stuck on that internet. You're looking
[1:21:36] at those magazines. You're doing things
[1:21:39] that Amen. And and you're trying to to
[1:21:42] to satisfy that demon that's got a hold
[1:21:45] of you. And it is a demon that's got a
[1:21:48] hold of you looking at those neck neaked
[1:21:50] women out there. And you've got a wife
[1:21:53] that's trying to please you and please
[1:21:55] your and please your family and raise
[1:21:57] them in the ways of the Lord. You're
[1:22:00] going to find out you're going to get
[1:22:01] old.
[1:22:03] Amen. What What is a What is a 55y old
[1:22:06] man got looking at
[1:22:09] those evil I don't know why I'm going
[1:22:12] here, but here I am going at those evil
[1:22:15] filthy hussies out there. Amen. And and
[1:22:19] you're a 55year-old man looking at a
[1:22:22] woman that that is that that that may be
[1:22:24] in the prime of her life and there's no
[1:22:26] telling how many abortions that woman
[1:22:28] has had. There's no telling how many
[1:22:30] souls, millions of of souls has been
[1:22:32] sent to hell because of that woman.
[1:22:36] And if you look in the mirror, you've
[1:22:38] got this fat gut and you're losing your
[1:22:41] teeth and you want your wife to keep on
[1:22:44] loving you.
[1:22:51] Hallelujah. So, I would say right now,
[1:22:53] don't pet the demon while your boys are
[1:22:55] young. Don't even start looking at that
[1:22:57] junk while you're young.
[1:23:00] Don't Don't even start when when a when
[1:23:03] a when a woman when when she marries
[1:23:05] you, she should never have to worry
[1:23:08] about you being about you h you you
[1:23:11] comparing her with some filthy woman
[1:23:14] outside there. And I'm here to tell you,
[1:23:16] I know this is a woman's world, and I
[1:23:18] know that's the way societyy's built.
[1:23:20] But I want to tell you, the kingdom of
[1:23:22] God is built for family. God invented
[1:23:25] the family. He created a man. He created
[1:23:28] a woman. And he blessed them with
[1:23:30] children. And if you want to be blessed,
[1:23:33] if you want to thrive, if you want to
[1:23:35] survive in this society, love your
[1:23:38] husbands and love your wives and raise
[1:23:42] your children to do the same.
[1:23:50] Well, can you say amen? Raise your
[1:23:53] children to do the same. Love them. love
[1:23:55] your wives. Amen. And and uh uh uh you
[1:23:59] you don't you know sometimes some some I
[1:24:01] wish I could say that I I've always been
[1:24:04] uh you know ne never never hurt my
[1:24:06] wife's feelings or never said something
[1:24:08] to hurt her. But I want to tell you when
[1:24:10] I do hurt her I I I want that girl to
[1:24:12] know that I'm sorry. I I want her to
[1:24:15] know that I love her. I I want and she
[1:24:17] does the same way for me. Amen. if she
[1:24:19] if if she feels like she she's hurt me
[1:24:22] in some way, my my wife will come and
[1:24:24] and and now she ain't as quite as quick
[1:24:27] as I am to do it. But man, it might take
[1:24:29] her a month or or no, I mean a couple
[1:24:31] days, but
[1:24:33] my but but she she's uh Can I hear an
[1:24:37] amen from any of you? Anyone ever have
[1:24:39] that problem? Amen. So So we we but we
[1:24:42] it doesn't matter. She's natured one
[1:24:45] way. I'm natured one way. And we have
[1:24:47] got to work together because family is
[1:24:53] the greatest
[1:24:55] institution on God's green earth.
[1:25:00] Apple is not the greatest institution.
[1:25:03] Amen. Prime and and and and whatever
[1:25:06] else out there Amazon is not the
[1:25:08] greatest institution. The greatest
[1:25:11] institution on earth is family. Amen.
[1:25:15] Amen.
[1:25:19] Now our theme this year is making a
[1:25:22] difference. The word difference is a
[1:25:25] point or way in which people or things
[1:25:28] are not the
[1:25:29] same. It's the state or condition of
[1:25:32] being dissimilar or
[1:25:35] unlike in Leosa our age where Christ has
[1:25:39] been pushed totally out of the church.
[1:25:42] If there is ever a people who makes a
[1:25:46] gender who's making a difference, that's
[1:25:49] you
[1:25:52] women. It's the thing that
[1:25:56] psychologists and and and great men have
[1:26:00] looked at and they're looking behind and
[1:26:02] they're seeing a lot of they're seeing a
[1:26:04] lot of things. uh uh and and and and
[1:26:09] looking at starting back from the 60s,
[1:26:13] the 50s and the 60s and coming all the
[1:26:16] way this way, the the the transition
[1:26:19] that has taken place from the family of
[1:26:22] back in those uh in that era to this
[1:26:26] family life that we have
[1:26:28] now. And and it is it's an incredible
[1:26:31] thing. And I and I want to just add this
[1:26:34] and I I I I I hope I hope I'm okay here
[1:26:38] this morning. Not not going to hold you
[1:26:40] just real long, but but I want you to I
[1:26:43] want you to think about this. Amen. You
[1:26:46] when you're throwing yourself in you you
[1:26:49] you you
[1:26:50] ladies, there are spirits that want that
[1:26:54] are out there to drive these women.
[1:26:57] Amen. To to keep the family from
[1:27:00] functioning the way God wanted it.
[1:27:02] That's just the truth. And so a woman
[1:27:05] that is standing in her place to stand
[1:27:08] behind her man, to love her children, I
[1:27:12] it's not an easy task. There are spirits
[1:27:16] that are there to fight you and to
[1:27:19] hinder you. But I want to tell you what
[1:27:22] you're doing. You're saving your your
[1:27:25] kids from the effects of the of this
[1:27:28] neurotic age. Now, I don't have time to
[1:27:31] go through all these statistics, but the
[1:27:34] statistic says a child that is raised in
[1:27:37] daycare compared to the child that is
[1:27:40] raised by a a a mama at home, it's out
[1:27:43] of this roof.
[1:27:46] Now, you think your kids are crazy right
[1:27:49] now. Hallelujah. Amen. And mas do think
[1:27:53] their kids are crazy sometimes. Amen.
[1:27:56] But but if you think that right now,
[1:27:59] what would happen if they had been in
[1:28:01] daycare?
[1:28:04] Amen. Now listen, what you are doing,
[1:28:07] you're making a difference. Amen. What
[1:28:10] you are doing, you are showing this next
[1:28:13] generation how they can win if they will
[1:28:17] do what is right. I am not an advocate
[1:28:21] for a mother to be out in the workplace.
[1:28:25] I've never been an advocate of that. I
[1:28:27] am not an advocate of that. Now, in
[1:28:30] order for that for for for you to have
[1:28:33] someone says, "Well, that's just
[1:28:34] impossible in these
[1:28:36] days. It's it's too expensive. We got to
[1:28:39] have man and woman." Amen. Not if you
[1:28:41] keep your taste, right? You don't have
[1:28:44] to have a boat and a four-wheeler and
[1:28:46] and golf all the time and and have every
[1:28:49] rifle known to mankind. You can live
[1:28:52] simple.
[1:28:57] so that your girl can take care of those
[1:29:00] children. Can I hear an amen?
[1:29:05] That's
[1:29:07] right. It's Go back and look. Go back
[1:29:10] and look. Go back and look at the curse.
[1:29:12] Go back and look at the covenants. It
[1:29:15] God did not say to Eve, "You're going to
[1:29:17] have to work by the sweat of your brow."
[1:29:20] He looked to He looked to the woman. He
[1:29:23] says, "Because of the sin that you have
[1:29:25] committed, you are going to travail in
[1:29:28] birth with pain."
[1:29:32] He looked to the man. Because of your
[1:29:34] sin, you're going to have to work by the
[1:29:37] sweat of your brow, and you're going to
[1:29:39] have to labor for your family. Right.
[1:29:43] Well, praise the Lord. So, these these
[1:29:46] men that don't want to work, Amen. You
[1:29:48] big bum. Get out there and work. I don't
[1:29:50] care what life is doing for you. Get out
[1:29:53] there and provide for your family. Good
[1:29:56] job, brother Wendle.
[1:29:58] Amen. Love your family. Fight for your
[1:30:03] family. Protect your family. And get out
[1:30:07] and provide for your family.
[1:30:14] Amen.
[1:30:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:21] I will show you this. I will share this
[1:30:23] statistic with
[1:30:25] you. Did you know that
[1:30:27] 71% of the women that are in the
[1:30:30] workplace, everyone say 71%
[1:30:34] of all the women in the
[1:30:36] workplace have children under the age of
[1:30:40] 18 at home.
[1:30:46] 71% that's nearly
[1:30:48] three4ers of all women that are working
[1:30:52] in the workplace have children at home
[1:30:57] under the age of
[1:31:01] 18. That's what the poll said.
[1:31:07] Now also this poll showed that the
[1:31:10] daughters of working
[1:31:13] mothers are more likely to advance in
[1:31:16] their own careers instead of having a
[1:31:22] family. And the sons of working mamas
[1:31:26] tend to choose an employed
[1:31:30] spouse. You say now what does this got
[1:31:32] to do with us?
[1:31:34] We are raising the next
[1:31:36] generation. Now, how do these how do
[1:31:39] these generations go? Let's see. I I
[1:31:40] know we are we are we are in we are Zen.
[1:31:44] What what's this? What's this
[1:31:45] generation?
[1:31:48] Zen I know there's a Gen X. There's a
[1:31:55] Huh? Gen Z. This is the Gen Z. Okay. All
[1:32:02] right. Hallelujah. I've got another
[1:32:05] statistic. Just hang on to just hang on.
[1:32:06] This is going to get good. Hallelujah.
[1:32:10] Hallelujah. There's there's there's the
[1:32:13] Oh, where's it at? Where's it at? I I've
[1:32:16] been I'm skipping around and now I'm
[1:32:18] trying to find where I'm at.
[1:32:20] Hallelujah.
[1:32:24] 70% of the Gen X claimed to be
[1:32:27] religious. Now, this was not this was
[1:32:28] not Christian. This was just some form
[1:32:31] of religion. Gen X. Who?
[1:32:37] We're Gen Z. Okay. Gen Gen Gen X would
[1:32:40] be me, right?
[1:32:43] Am I the Gen X or am I the millennial?
[1:32:51] That's me.
[1:32:53] Amen. Gen X Gen X had
[1:32:58] 70% who claimed to be religious.
[1:33:04] Gen Z. Well, who is Gen
[1:33:07] Z? That's
[1:33:11] okay. All right. Gen Z's now watch ZX
[1:33:16] 70% Gen Z's are
[1:33:21] 45% claiming to be
[1:33:25] religious. They are saying that the
[1:33:27] United States is no longer a Christian
[1:33:29] nation.
[1:33:32] Not because a preacher like me is saying
[1:33:33] they're just sin and filthy and they're
[1:33:35] all going to hell. That's what they are
[1:33:37] saying in the polls. We don't want
[1:33:40] God. We don't want his word. We don't
[1:33:44] want to adhere to the things that God
[1:33:46] has
[1:33:47] said. Where has the failure
[1:33:52] come? Because family has been broke
[1:33:56] down. And that that that that woman or
[1:34:00] man, boy that is that is watching your
[1:34:02] children out there. They don't care
[1:34:04] about that kid. Not like you do.
[1:34:08] They're not passing her the godly values
[1:34:11] down.
[1:34:14] And if you don't care about those godly
[1:34:16] values and you're caring more about your
[1:34:18] boat and you're car and I I I don't I'm
[1:34:20] saying boat. I don't know. I don't think
[1:34:22] any of us got a boat in here.
[1:34:23] Hallelujah. But I'm just I'm just And
[1:34:25] you you want your boat and you want and
[1:34:27] a woman don't want to stay home and take
[1:34:29] care of her man and she don't want to uh
[1:34:31] take care of her children and she wants
[1:34:33] to go out there and and and take on a
[1:34:36] man's place. And yes, you are taking on
[1:34:38] a man's place because I just showed you
[1:34:39] in the scripture that the man is to work
[1:34:42] by the sweat of his brow and the woman
[1:34:44] is to be a housemaker. That was the
[1:34:46] covenant in the garden.
[1:34:51] Good job, brother Wendle. Keep it up. I
[1:34:53] think I
[1:34:55] will.
[1:34:57] Amen. So, we've got daughters of working
[1:35:00] mamas who are saying, "We're going to
[1:35:03] follow. We're going to do that. Yeah,
[1:35:05] we'll have kids, but but Amen. We'll let
[1:35:08] someone else take care of our
[1:35:11] responsibilities." Do you see how
[1:35:13] important you are, mamas?
[1:35:15] Do you see how important it is? I know
[1:35:18] you get tired. My daughter-in-law
[1:35:22] Tina wrote something uh to my wife the
[1:35:25] other day and she didn't know that this
[1:35:26] was going to to she was going to be
[1:35:29] famous today, but this was her text. So,
[1:35:32] I had a pretty rough day today. Lol.
[1:35:34] Micah had an ENT appointment this
[1:35:37] morning, so had to hurry and get there
[1:35:40] to Still Water. Was running a tad late.
[1:35:43] Was going 40 and a 30 and got pulled
[1:35:45] over. Thankfully, the cops were nice and
[1:35:48] no ticket. Then went to Walmart to get
[1:35:51] groceries and had over $100 in wick and
[1:35:54] stuff and my wick card wouldn't work.
[1:35:57] Had to sit and figure it out with four
[1:35:59] kids that were just done
[1:36:02] shopping. You can imagine all the stairs
[1:36:04] I got. Lol. So, I finally got it figured
[1:36:07] out and had to rescan all of my
[1:36:09] groceries myself. Get to the van and my
[1:36:12] tire was flat as a pancake.
[1:36:15] Well, at this point, I felt I feel like
[1:36:17] crying. I went to the closest air pump,
[1:36:19] and that's
[1:36:21] $2.50 for air. After all that, feeling
[1:36:25] defeated, I look over and see this cup
[1:36:29] just randomly sitting in the bushes.
[1:36:31] Nothing in it. And she sent this she
[1:36:35] sent this
[1:36:36] picture as just this this this cup just
[1:36:40] sitting out there in in the bushes.
[1:36:44] Best mom.
[1:36:47] The best mom. Did Can Can y'all see I I
[1:36:49] If that If that wasn't a godsend, that
[1:36:52] that wasn't a godsend for you. God God
[1:36:55] letting God letting mama
[1:36:59] know. Didn't even have anything in it.
[1:37:02] But God just letting God just letting
[1:37:05] mama know that
[1:37:08] that I love you, girl. This is her. This
[1:37:11] This is the one who had it.
[1:37:13] quit speeding. Amen. And uh did y'all do
[1:37:16] y'all see that? Isn't that now Now that
[1:37:18] that was God that was God just letting
[1:37:20] her know right there in the bushes? Just
[1:37:22] just right there in the bushes. And God
[1:37:24] letting mama know that, hey,
[1:37:26] everything's going to be all right. You
[1:37:27] boys want to see that?
[1:37:29] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:37:32] So I I I and I want to tell you if the
[1:37:35] Lord didn't give you that that that that
[1:37:36] that cup, I I I think your husband would
[1:37:40] have told you, you're a good
[1:37:42] mama. Amen. I know Caleb and he loves
[1:37:46] his girl. And and I want to tell you uh
[1:37:49] to my daughter-in-law, you're a good
[1:37:50] mama. Matter of fact, I want to say to
[1:37:52] all of my daughters-in-law, I've got the
[1:37:55] best daughters-in-laws in all the world.
[1:37:59] Amen. They're good mothers. They're good
[1:38:01] mothers. They're good to their husbands.
[1:38:03] They're good to their children. And and
[1:38:05] and I I say God bless every one of them.
[1:38:09] Can you say amen? So making a
[1:38:11] difference. Amen. Now I I I'm going to
[1:38:13] I'm going to close this down right now.
[1:38:16] Amen. If you don't
[1:38:18] realize how how precious you are making
[1:38:22] a difference in our culture is means
[1:38:27] contrast. It means
[1:38:29] distinctness. To make no difference,
[1:38:33] amen. To make no difference, the
[1:38:35] dictionary says, is to have no effect on
[1:38:37] a person or situation. Full of
[1:38:42] apathy. You're in a state of not caring.
[1:38:45] The passion is missing or is being
[1:38:48] suppressed. The average, you're just the
[1:38:50] average
[1:38:51] run-of-the-mill. Amen. But I want to say
[1:38:54] let's look to the very goodness of the
[1:38:58] Lord that he has given
[1:39:00] us. You
[1:39:02] sisters are are are the ones that teach
[1:39:06] them about the Lord. Your selfless
[1:39:10] giving of
[1:39:11] yourself to your to of yourself to your
[1:39:14] children to your husband to the
[1:39:16] community and especially to the
[1:39:18] household of faith. And I when I say the
[1:39:21] household of faith, the scripture says
[1:39:24] to be good to the household of faith and
[1:39:27] and to to honor them. And the way that
[1:39:30] you love, you are showing them that
[1:39:33] eternal life is a dying to yourself and
[1:39:38] a living for
[1:39:40] others. Amen. The only thing you will
[1:39:43] take with you is what you do for Christ.
[1:39:48] Sister April, the only thing that you're
[1:39:49] going to take with you is your family.
[1:39:52] Not your riches, not not not your looks,
[1:39:56] not not not your
[1:39:58] prestige. The only thing you
[1:40:01] get is your
[1:40:04] family. And I bet that's the only thing
[1:40:06] you want is your family to be in
[1:40:09] eternity with
[1:40:12] you. That's all we get.
[1:40:16] We're not taking our
[1:40:19] tractors. We're not taking our
[1:40:22] houses. We're not taking our
[1:40:27] trucks. The only thing we're taking on
[1:40:30] the other side, folks. Not your
[1:40:32] millions, not your bank
[1:40:35] account. The only thing you're taking
[1:40:37] with
[1:40:41] you is the ones that you chose to invest
[1:40:44] in.
[1:40:45] your family.
[1:40:51] Today, Christianity has become selfish.
[1:40:54] There's really
[1:40:56] not much of a
[1:40:58] difference. Brother Brandon would say,
[1:41:00] "There ain't no one that'll just walk
[1:41:01] across the street and go help a neighbor
[1:41:03] anymore. Not without wanting to be
[1:41:07] paid." There's no one that wants to
[1:41:09] reach out a helping hand to someone
[1:41:12] that's in need.
[1:41:17] But a
[1:41:19] mother
[1:41:22] gives and
[1:41:25] gives and
[1:41:28] gives. I have a couple of scriptures
[1:41:30] here that I want to read to you and then
[1:41:32] and then I promise I'm closing. 2
[1:41:35] Corinthians
[1:41:36] 12:15. The Apostle Paul says, "I will
[1:41:39] gladly
[1:41:41] spend and be spent for
[1:41:45] you." Though the more abundantly I love
[1:41:48] you, the less I be
[1:41:50] loved. Sometimes you feel that
[1:41:54] way. I have spent. I will be spent. I
[1:41:59] will give of myself because I have found
[1:42:02] this in Christ.
[1:42:06] I don't want nothing in return. All I
[1:42:09] want is to give of myself. I want to
[1:42:13] fulfill a need. And you ladies show that
[1:42:17] in the way that you live. I I I love
[1:42:19] this. 1 Corinthians 16 and 15. He says,
[1:42:23] "I beseech you, brethren, you know the
[1:42:25] house of Stfanis that are the first
[1:42:27] fruits of Ai or they're the first
[1:42:29] believers that they have addicted
[1:42:31] themselves to the ministry of the
[1:42:33] saints.
[1:42:36] ministry Jesus said or or the the
[1:42:39] brother brother Brandham says the first
[1:42:41] thing I want to say is Jesus never lived
[1:42:43] for himself his life was spent for
[1:42:46] others that's perfectly eternal life and
[1:42:49] when you say you go to church and you do
[1:42:51] good things that's fine but when you
[1:42:53] live your life to yourself you haven't
[1:42:55] eternal life eternal life is living for
[1:43:01] others it proved it when he it come as
[1:43:03] the lamb of God. He lived and had
[1:43:05] eternal life because he did not live for
[1:43:08] himself. He lived for others. And you
[1:43:10] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:43:12] day at
[1:43:14] Calvary. You don't live for yourself
[1:43:17] anymore. You live for
[1:43:20] others. I want to say as you are living
[1:43:23] for
[1:43:25] others, you're having an effect upon
[1:43:28] them. You're making that difference.
[1:43:32] If there's some mamas that feel like
[1:43:34] sister Leah, well, all of these all of
[1:43:37] these elder ladies that that that that
[1:43:40] gave the these these ladies aren't
[1:43:42] talking out of off of a script. They
[1:43:44] were talking from their
[1:43:48] heart. Every mama feels like she's
[1:43:50] worthless a lots of
[1:43:53] times. A lot of mamas feel like they've
[1:43:56] missed the mark.
[1:43:58] Hey, I'm I'm I'm a 55 year
[1:44:01] old man and I've fixing to have 12
[1:44:05] grandkids. Got 10 of them and two more
[1:44:07] on the
[1:44:09] way. And I've got some other kids in
[1:44:11] here that I claim to be mine. Y'all call
[1:44:13] me
[1:44:15] Poppy. But I still look back from time
[1:44:17] to time and I think I could have been a
[1:44:19] better
[1:44:20] daddy. I could have been a better. But I
[1:44:22] want to tell you, if you've taught your
[1:44:24] children to love the Lord and you're
[1:44:26] teaching your children to love the
[1:44:29] Lord and you fail and you're willing to
[1:44:34] say,
[1:44:36] "Mama was wrong.
[1:44:39] I'm not condoning what you have done,
[1:44:40] but I maybe I've overreacted or maybe
[1:44:42] I've maybe you heard me or seen me or
[1:44:46] but I want you to know that I've asked
[1:44:49] the Lord to forgive me and I want you to
[1:44:51] forgive me. What are you teaching those
[1:44:54] boys and girls? You're teaching them
[1:44:55] what grace really is about. You're
[1:44:58] teaching your children. You're not
[1:45:00] always going to hit the mark, but
[1:45:02] there's always plenty of blood and
[1:45:04] there's always plenty of forgiveness.
[1:45:06] and God will always bring us
[1:45:09] back. But you're teaching them that your
[1:45:11] desire is to live for others. When
[1:45:14] you're bringing them to church, when
[1:45:15] you're bringing them when when you're
[1:45:17] when you're bringing someone's in need
[1:45:19] and and they're and they they are
[1:45:20] needing help and you bring your children
[1:45:22] over there as as as so many of you do
[1:45:25] and you you you just jump in and you're
[1:45:27] helping and you're giving, you're
[1:45:29] teaching them that
[1:45:31] Christianity is living for others.
[1:45:36] You're teaching them, and I we could
[1:45:38] just go on and on and on. You're
[1:45:40] teaching them the
[1:45:43] value that you are placing on
[1:45:47] brothers, on sisters, and when they get
[1:45:50] to that
[1:45:52] age, they'll have no problem identifying
[1:45:56] who they're associated
[1:45:57] with. They'll have no problem raising
[1:46:00] their children right in the ways of the
[1:46:01] Lord. There won't be questioning, won't
[1:46:03] be fighting, won't be none of that
[1:46:04] stuff. They're going to be right there
[1:46:06] together. And you know what's done? 90%
[1:46:09] of it. It's a godly
[1:46:12] woman. I say God richly bless you
[1:46:17] sisters
[1:46:19] today. If the musicians would
[1:46:30] come, those who make a
[1:46:33] difference. I believe it was sister
[1:46:35] Karen on here that says it's not doing
[1:46:37] big
[1:46:39] things. You might feel like, oh, I mean,
[1:46:42] I I wish I could do big things.
[1:46:44] Sometimes you look over to this other
[1:46:45] woman. She's got a personality that's
[1:46:47] out of this world and she attracts
[1:46:49] everyone and everyone's, "Oh my, oh my,
[1:46:52] sister so and so. She can get it done.
[1:46:54] Hey, if you need anything, go sister so
[1:46:55] and so." And sometimes you other sisters
[1:46:57] are saying, "Man, I try." Oh, wow. Hi
[1:47:02] you.
[1:47:04] Right. But the Apostle Paul says it's
[1:47:07] not wise to compare one another with
[1:47:10] each
[1:47:14] other. I don't ever remember my mother
[1:47:18] raising hammering a
[1:47:21] nail and she might have put pictures in
[1:47:24] the wall.
[1:47:25] I don't I don't remember my mother
[1:47:30] ever. I don't know. I don't remember
[1:47:32] even mowing the lawn. She might have.
[1:47:35] She
[1:47:39] has. I I don't remember those kinds of
[1:47:42] of things. But what I will say about my
[1:47:44] mother
[1:47:45] is dog gone
[1:47:47] it, she loved us kids.
[1:47:53] She prayed for us
[1:47:56] kids.
[1:47:59] So you you might not be handy with a
[1:48:02] skill stall and you might not be handy
[1:48:03] with maybe you're not even a
[1:48:07] decorator. But a decorator doesn't mean
[1:48:09] doesn't make you a
[1:48:11] homemaker. Decorations don't make you
[1:48:14] homemaker.
[1:48:25] The paint on the wall doesn't make you
[1:48:27] something special. Your furniture
[1:48:29] doesn't make
[1:48:31] you. What makes you a
[1:48:34] homemaker is you're a lady at
[1:48:38] heart. And I'm talking to you ladies and
[1:48:42] I'm
[1:48:44] saying that your families would not be
[1:48:46] who they are
[1:48:49] today if it had not been for your
[1:48:54] choice to love your
[1:48:58] families and to be homemakers.
[1:49:05] I'd like I I we've done this before and
[1:49:08] and I I understand
[1:49:14] that. And I know it's getting late, but
[1:49:16] we don't have a service tonight. And
[1:49:18] besides, you need all the lines to be
[1:49:20] out at your favorite eating place
[1:49:22] anyway, so that you won't have have to
[1:49:24] wait in line forever. I I'd like to have
[1:49:27] all of you mamas to come up to the
[1:49:29] front.
[1:49:32] I I I'd like to I'd like to have an
[1:49:36] honor line. You you mothers come up to
[1:49:38] the front
[1:49:40] then and just stand up up here to the
[1:49:42] front and let let
[1:49:45] us
[1:49:49] daddies children come up and shake your
[1:49:52] hands. You knew it was
[1:49:56] coming. But
[1:49:59] I I
[1:50:02] I I wanted to do a good job for y'all
[1:50:05] today. I I I hope you girls know where
[1:50:08] my heart is. And I'm trying to express
[1:50:10] the hearts of your your
[1:50:15] husbands. That's right. And y'all y'all
[1:50:17] just go and form a line on o on on
[1:50:20] around here in front and that
[1:50:21] way cuz I'm going to we're going to
[1:50:24] start a line in here. Y'all just bring
[1:50:27] your line right on together here. Any
[1:50:30] other mothers?
[1:50:32] Amen.
[1:50:35] Hallelujah. Aren't these just some
[1:50:38] beautiful ladies? They're not just
[1:50:41] beautiful. They're
[1:50:42] gorgeous. They're wonderful sisters.
[1:50:45] They're your mothers. They're your
[1:50:48] wives. If if I could get you brothers.
[1:50:51] Now, we we've got something special for
[1:50:53] you you ladies. And when y'all exit here
[1:50:56] in a minute, if y'all don't mind exiting
[1:50:59] back this way here, and we're going to
[1:51:00] give them to you as you're leaving. So
[1:51:02] So do you mind doing that, brother? And
[1:51:04] we'll just we'll just bring that right
[1:51:05] over here. And then uh what what
[1:51:18] [Music]

[1:51:34] Sunday school

[1:51:50] is this is not the hall of shame. This
[1:51:54] is the hall of honor right here. This we
[1:51:58] we're honoring these precious ladies in
[1:52:00] our lives. And u I figured you you young
[1:52:03] boys would be the first to jump up there
[1:52:06] and let
[1:52:08] but all right. Come on. Let's not be
[1:52:11] shy. Amen. Kobe, go ahead and and sing
[1:52:14] there.
[1:52:15] Thank
[1:52:16] you for giving to the Lord.
[1:52:24] I am the
[1:52:25] life that was changed.
[1:52:32] Thank you
[1:52:35] for
[1:52:37] You've got wonderful mothers.
[1:52:40] We thank God for you mothers. So glad
[1:52:44] you gave. Sorry for making you lose your
[1:52:46] place.
[1:52:49] Thank
[1:52:51] you for giving to the Lord.
[1:52:58] I am
[1:53:00] alive that will change.
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:07] Thank
[1:53:08] you for giving to the Lord.
[1:53:15] I am so glad you gave. We love you,
[1:53:20] mothers. Thank you.
[1:53:24] This is a woman's world. You could be
[1:53:26] out making money. You could be out doing
[1:53:29] careers, but you've chosen to love your
[1:53:32] husbands. I am the light. You've chosen
[1:53:35] to raise your children to love God.
[1:53:41] You're not part of that 40%.
[1:53:44] [Music]
[1:53:46] Your children
[1:53:49] are not part of that 60 70% who does not
[1:53:53] know or is not caring about God.
[1:53:58] You're blessed. Your families are
[1:54:00] blessed. Giving to the
[1:54:04] [Music]
[1:54:06] Lord. I am
[1:54:08] alive that was changed.
[1:54:13] Hallelujah.
[1:54:16] The term with a difference is having a
[1:54:18] new or unusual feature or treatment
[1:54:23] in this age.
[1:54:25] There's a there's a family with a
[1:54:26] difference. There's a church with a

[2:11:32] rest. Oh
[2:11:34] Lord, I give you
[2:11:38] [Music]
[2:11:43] thanks. If this generation is
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:11:47] different, it'll be because somebody
[2:11:50] made a
[2:11:54] difference. When you see children coming
[2:11:57] and sitting in church and loving
[2:12:00] God, tears streaming down their face
[2:12:03] when the presence of the Lord is moving.
[2:12:06] It's because there's somebody at
[2:12:09] home teaching those
[2:12:13] children to be receptive to his
[2:12:17] [Music]
[2:12:23] presence. Oh, good
[2:12:25] day. I want y'all to leave this building
[2:12:30] knowing that you're making a difference.
[2:12:34] [Music]
[2:12:37] Now
[2:12:39] listen, brother Brandham
[2:12:43] said, he made the
[2:12:45] prophecy. He said, "When the pope comes
[2:12:48] from out of the when when they bring in
[2:12:51] a pope from out of the United States,
[2:12:54] lift up your head."
[2:13:00] The council of churches will come
[2:13:02] together under that
[2:13:03] [Music]
[2:13:07] head. They'll form that image to the
[2:13:10] beast. But you and
[2:13:12] I are going in a rapture.
[2:13:19] And here we've got a generation that
[2:13:22] wants nothing to do with God
[2:13:28] because of the feminist
[2:13:31] movement that have rejected her role in
[2:13:34] this and the scripture and in her
[2:13:38] family. Don't get
[2:13:41] tired. Don't get
[2:13:43] weary. We're living in this world, but
[2:13:45] we're not of this world. Rapture time is
[2:13:47] upon us. Love your husbands. Love your
[2:13:51] children. Husbands, love your wife and
[2:13:53] your
[2:13:55] family. The rapture is upon
[2:13:58] us. They were saying they were saying
[2:14:01] all all of the every everyone was
[2:14:04] saying. Now, we've known that prophecy.
[2:14:07] We've known that prophecy that there
[2:14:08] would come a a a pope out of the United
[2:14:12] States. And so every time a pope would
[2:14:15] come, we would say, "Huh,
[2:14:18] maybe." But you you you go back and just
[2:14:21] anyone that was that whoever they were
[2:14:23] interviewing, all of the big dogs, all
[2:14:26] of the all of the guys in the know said,
[2:14:27] "No, it won't come out of the United
[2:14:28] States. No, this can't come because that
[2:14:32] superpower and we've got this and we got
[2:14:34] no there's there there was no one in the
[2:14:36] United States that is favored."
[2:14:39] But then after a day in the
[2:14:41] conclave and one of the bishops that
[2:14:43] came out, the cardinals that came out of
[2:14:44] there said it was like an anointing.
[2:14:47] There was like a pres. It was just like
[2:14:49] it was God doing it. And I'm saying,
[2:14:52] "Yeah, God's fulfilling his prophecy.
[2:14:54] God done told us back in
[2:14:56] 1954 through brother Brandham that there
[2:14:59] would come a pope out of the United
[2:15:03] States." And when this happens to begin
[2:15:06] to look
[2:15:09] We have got we have got a president in
[2:15:12] the White House
[2:15:14] now. That is he's he's
[2:15:18] he's going to do his convictions. And
[2:15:21] there's one thing that he is he is out
[2:15:23] to
[2:15:25] do. He is out
[2:15:27] to make sure Christianity
[2:15:30] is is on the up and up. Make sure that
[2:15:34] he's going to protect the Christians. Is
[2:15:36] that not what constantine done? Did not
[2:15:40] Constantine do that? Yes. Constantine in
[2:15:44] he stopped the he stopped all of the the
[2:15:46] the the the persecution to the
[2:15:49] Christians. And
[2:15:51] Constantine he says he says I'm I'm
[2:15:54] going to give religious I'm going to
[2:15:55] fight for the Christians. And then what
[2:15:56] after after a while what did he end up
[2:16:00] doing? He was fighting for certain
[2:16:02] Christians. They had to belong to this
[2:16:05] certain church. They had to belong to
[2:16:08] this. And then that there started the
[2:16:13] cru uh the the the the persecution of 68
[2:16:17] million believers. Constantine doing a
[2:16:21] good
[2:16:22] deed. It was the heathen that was
[2:16:25] persecuting us. But now after
[2:16:27] Constantine, it was the state that was
[2:16:30] going to make sure the Bible says. The
[2:16:32] Bible says there will come a time where
[2:16:34] you won't be able to buy or sell, right?
[2:16:38] You won't be able to do any of that
[2:16:39] without the mark of that beast. We've
[2:16:41] got a president who is willing to fight.
[2:16:44] We have now got a pope from the United
[2:16:46] States.
[2:16:47] I wouldn't doubt one minute that those
[2:16:50] guys don't just claim just ex come
[2:16:52] together just as as Revelations the 13th
[2:16:54] chapter said would happen. Yes.
[2:17:01] Are we that close? I don't know. We got
[2:17:04] us a pope in out of the state, out of
[2:17:06] the United States. We got a president
[2:17:10] that he don't care. He's going to he's
[2:17:14] going to do what he thinks is
[2:17:19] right.
[2:17:21] Mama, there's a reason that Satan fights
[2:17:23] you so
[2:17:24] hard. Daddies, there's a reason Satan
[2:17:27] fights you so hard.
[2:17:29] I believe with all of my heart that
[2:17:31] there were people in this building I I
[2:17:34] believe there could be all of us in this
[2:17:36] building here tonight that won't see
[2:17:37] death before the
[2:17:39] rapture. I believe that we've got those
[2:17:42] I am so convinced that we are that
[2:17:46] close. Aren't you glad that God sent us
[2:17:48] a prophet to show us these things?
[2:17:52] Keep our skirts clean, our garments
[2:17:55] clean. Let's let's let's let's stay
[2:17:57] righteous before God and your
[2:18:00] righteousness, your abilities as filthy
[2:18:03] rags. So don't don't don't lean on your
[2:18:05] good
[2:18:07] works. We're resting solely in the blood
[2:18:10] of the Lord Jesus
[2:18:12] Christ. Boys and girls, listen to mom
[2:18:14] and
[2:18:15] daddy. Mas and daddies, love God with
[2:18:18] all of your heart.
[2:18:21] coming a time here real
[2:18:23] soon. The next one of these days, we'll
[2:18:26] step into another dimension. And Len
[2:18:28] Poppy's not going to be fat and

[2:19:03] saying something to me and I was at the
[2:19:05] counter and I said, "Oh, I'm sorry. I
[2:19:07] just overlooked you." And I've been
[2:19:09] making those little quips. So,
[2:19:12] she's and uh this girl behind us, she
[2:19:15] says, "That is hurting her feelings."
[2:19:18] And you
