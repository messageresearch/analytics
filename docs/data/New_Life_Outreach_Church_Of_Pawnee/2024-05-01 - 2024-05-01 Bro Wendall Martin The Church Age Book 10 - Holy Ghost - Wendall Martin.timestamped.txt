[21:31] come from the genetics of
[21:33] God that that
[21:36] desire to please him and that desire for
[21:40] more of him that can only come from
[21:43] something that was predestinated on the
[21:45] inside of you and I'm so thankful amen
[21:49] for the predestinated seat of God within
[21:53] us that is guiding us and and leading us
[21:57] amen through this life praise the Lord

[24:04] verse and U and then we're going to get
[24:07] right on into uh the church age book
[24:10] we're going to be starting there at at
[24:13] 139 but we're just going to read the one
[24:16] verse
[24:17] there it says he that hath an
[24:21] ear let him hear what the spirit says
[24:25] unto the churches now I like that he he
[24:29] that has an ear now there's
[24:32] there's I guess everyone I've ever ran
[24:35] into has at least got one ear but amen
[24:40] this is not what he's talking about he
[24:43] that is been built to hear the things of
[24:47] the Lord amen so he that hath an ear
[24:51] spiritual ear let him hear what the
[24:53] spirit says unto the churches he that
[24:56] overcometh shall not be hurt of the
[24:59] second death let's go to the Lord in
[25:01] prayer father we just want to thank you

[25:56] your anointing would be with them Father
[25:59] we just ask that you would help us here
[26:01] today that you would strengthen hearts
[26:04] Lord open our ears to understand what
[26:07] you have to say and we'll give you glory
[26:10] and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus
[26:13] Christ can the church say
[26:15] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[26:19] seated here this evening amen we um so
[26:24] we're going to start reading here at um
[26:28] uh um here at in page
[26:31] 139 and uh that's going to be our
[26:33] reading for tonight um and this is going
[26:36] to be dealing um with the the Holy
[26:40] Spirit and
[26:42] um amen the only way that you can ever
[26:45] hear anything from the Lord is is to um
[26:50] be born again and and there is a
[26:54] difference between the word birth and a
[26:57] church birth bir amen the word birth you
[27:02] you are it is the seed of God that is
[27:05] that is energized amen and you begin to
[27:09] see things hear things uh believe things
[27:13] the way God believes things amen and so
[27:18] then you have um amen um a church a
[27:22] church birth if you want to it's a
[27:24] church experience to where you um amen
[27:28] you you go by knowledge everything is is
[27:31] is knowledge it's what you're learning
[27:32] you're learning about Christ you're
[27:35] learning how to act you're learning uh
[27:38] what the denomination teaches or what
[27:40] the certain congregation believes or
[27:43] amen and so there is learning in both
[27:46] sides amen but as we have as we
[27:50] have as we have brought out here in
[27:52] these last um several Wednesday nights
[27:55] amen the Tree of Life was the
[27:59] breathing Living Word tree of knowledge
[28:05] amen is is a reasoning of the word
[28:08] reasoning learning so while we learn
[28:12] amen it's not the same way as as what we
[28:16] would with the in the Supernatural realm
[28:19] amen with the with the new birth there
[28:23] is that living logos that is living his
[28:27] word through us it's it's more than just
[28:30] a knowledge there is revelation it's
[28:33] divinely inspired it's divinely put you
[28:37] were part of that word at the very
[28:40] beginning you can't help but believe
[28:43] that word because you and the word are
[28:46] one you came out of that word and so
[28:49] when the Holy that's the reason why
[28:50] you've got to receive the Holy Ghost
[28:53] amen you can have the genuine word seed
[28:55] on the inside of you be be be
[28:58] predestinated but if you don't have the
[29:01] Holy Ghost it's not energized it's not
[29:04] it's not being made real to you
[29:07] therefore a lots of times it becomes
[29:09] laws and regulations because it's not
[29:11] part of who you are yet amen but when
[29:15] you when you truly are born again you
[29:18] are oozing Redemption you are oozing the
[29:22] word of God it's who you are that's
[29:25] everything about you there's no second
[29:26] thoughts about it that that's who you
[29:28] are can you say amen and and matters of
[29:30] fact we you know I I'll um let's just as
[29:34] we stand here I've got I've got a couple
[29:35] of them that I might just read to you
[29:37] real quickly um uh there I want to read
[29:39] out of page 92 and um and and down on
[29:43] the third paragraph it says now to get
[29:47] the real meaning of what we're about to
[29:50] go into I must caution you to ever keep
[29:53] in mind that religion or spiritual
[29:56] matters if you like is composed Ed of
[29:58] two parts that intertwine but are as
[30:01] opposite as black and white religion and
[30:03] the spiritual world are made up made of
[30:06] two trees which had their roots in Eden
[30:09] both the tree of life and the tree of
[30:12] knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the
[30:14] midst of the garden and no doubt their
[30:17] very branches intertwined each
[30:19] other thus in the Ephesian church is
[30:22] that same Paradox the church is made up
[30:24] of good and bad two Vines make the
[30:26] church they are like wheat and tears
[30:29] growing up side by side but one is the
[30:33] true the other is the false now God will
[30:38] speak to each one he will talk about
[30:41] each one he will call them the church
[30:45] only the elect will know which is the
[30:49] true Spirit only the elect cannot be
[30:52] deceived Matthew 4 24 and 24 for there
[30:56] shall arise false Christ false prophets
[31:00] and shall sow sign great signs and
[31:02] wonders in as much if they were possible
[31:05] it would deceive the very elected so so
[31:10] we've got in in the in the church system
[31:13] in the church we've got the two trees
[31:15] can you say amen and and and but the
[31:18] elect is the only one that'll know why
[31:21] because you are of the one you are you
[31:25] have that Eternal Word on the inside of
[31:27] you amen they're in uh page 98 and I'm
[31:30] just and you don't have to turn there if
[31:32] you don't want to but um if you would
[31:34] like to it's page 98 and it'll be down
[31:37] to the third paragraph amen this comes
[31:41] to mind as well he says all right if the
[31:44] tree of life is a person then the tree
[31:47] of knowledge of Good and Evil is a
[31:49] person also it can't be otherwise thus
[31:53] the righteous one and the wicked one
[31:55] stood side by side there in the midst of
[31:58] the Garden of Eden Ezekiel
[32:00] 2813a thou Satan Hast been in Eden the
[32:05] Garden of God so so we can see that the
[32:08] two trees there is the there there are
[32:11] the two seeds now there's the seed of
[32:13] the serpent there's the seed of Christ
[32:16] seed of the serpent goes by
[32:19] knowledge understanding learning
[32:21] reasoning looking good play the part
[32:25] amen Cain was a religious person done it
[32:28] all but without divine revelation had
[32:31] had no understanding of the knowledge of
[32:33] God Amen but Abel on the other side he
[32:37] was born of that seed of God and he had
[32:40] a divine revelation about him amen it
[32:43] wasn't all in churchy it wasn't all just
[32:45] this that and the other there was a
[32:46] divine
[32:48] revelation he was a Son of God can you
[32:52] say Amen now how are we going to tell
[32:55] the difference once again how are we
[32:57] going to tell tell the difference
[32:58] between the two seeds amen and one more
[33:01] before we get started the page
[33:03] 106
[33:06] amen and we're going to start at the
[33:08] very last paragraph right in the middle
[33:10] of it amen he says he simply gave the
[33:14] word he said not to partake of knowledge
[33:18] partake of life now this is where it's
[33:20] so important now he gave the word
[33:23] brother Wendell isn't that
[33:25] knowledge he gave the word well that's
[33:29] why we come to church is to get more
[33:30] knowledge brother brandham says he gave
[33:33] the word and he said not to partake of
[33:37] knowledge partake of life life was the
[33:41] word of God death was anything that
[33:45] wasn't the word of God she allowed one
[33:48] word to be changed and right then Satan
[33:53] had her all right now let's go to page
[33:56] 139 and we'll get started started here
[33:59] now I want to hear what the spirit is
[34:03] saying to the church it's important that
[34:07] we hear we want not
[34:10] knowledge not not in what with this but
[34:15] I want to be able to hear with this I
[34:18] want to be able to understand with this
[34:21] and this is where they miss it this is
[34:25] where because everybody has ch Church
[34:28] everybody's got I mean we've got
[34:30] churches everywhere but God has got he's
[34:33] got something really incredible for you
[34:35] so this is going to be uh tonight's
[34:38] going to be basically about the Holy
[34:40] Spirit now let's go let's let's look
[34:42] here and as he starts Revelations
[34:45] 2:11 uh he that hath an ear let him hear
[34:49] what the spirit Seth unto the churches
[34:51] there is not one Church age where this
[34:54] verse is not mentioned every single age
[34:57] has the same admonition to the people of
[35:00] every age he that hath an ear let him
[35:04] hear what the spirit saith but it is
[35:07] absolutely impossible for all men to
[35:11] hear what the spirit says to the
[35:12] different ages 1 Corinthians 2
[35:16] and6 uh through 16 how be it we speak
[35:19] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[35:22] not the wisdom of this world nor of the
[35:25] princes of this world that come to not
[35:28] but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[35:31] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[35:35] ordained before the world unto our Glory
[35:39] oh I love that which none of the princes
[35:41] of this world knew for had they known it
[35:45] they would not have crucified the Lord
[35:46] Of Glory but as it is written iath Not
[35:50] Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered
[35:54] into the heart of men the things that
[35:57] God God has prepared for them that love
[35:59] him but he doesn't stop there but God
[36:03] has revealed them unto us isn't that
[36:08] wonderful by his spirit for the spirit
[36:10] searcheth all things yeay the Deep
[36:12] things of God for what man knoweth the
[36:14] things of a man saith the spirit of man
[36:16] that is in him even so the things of God
[36:20] knoweth no man but the spirit of God now
[36:23] we have received not the spirit of the
[36:25] world but the spirit which of God that
[36:28] we may know the things that are freely
[36:31] given to us of God which things also we
[36:34] speak not in The Words which man's
[36:36] Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[36:39] teacheth compar comparing spiritual
[36:41] things with spiritual but the Natural
[36:43] Things the natural man receiveth not the
[36:45] things of the spirit of God for they are
[36:47] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[36:50] them because they are spiritually
[36:52] discerned but he that is spiritual
[36:54] judgeth all things yet he himself is
[36:56] judged of no man for who hath known the
[36:59] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[37:02] him but we have the mind of Christ now
[37:06] that is a powerful reading there then he
[37:08] goes to Matthew the 13th chapter and 13
[37:12] to 16th verse therefore speak I to them
[37:15] in Parables this is Jesus because that
[37:19] they sing see not hearing they hear not
[37:24] neither do they understand and in them
[37:26] is fulfilled the prophecy of
[37:29] isaas which saith by hearing ye shall
[37:32] hear and not understand seeing ye shall
[37:35] see and shall not perceive for this
[37:38] people's heart is gross is waxed gross
[37:41] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[37:44] their eyes they have closed lest at any
[37:48] time they should see with their eyes and
[37:49] hear with their ears and should
[37:52] understand with their heart and should
[37:53] be converted and I should heal them but
[37:57] here again but blessed are your eyes for
[38:02] they see and your ears for they he then
[38:07] he goes to John 8:
[38:10] 42-44 Jesus said unto them if God were
[38:14] your father you would love me for I
[38:18] proceeded forth and came from God
[38:20] neither came I of myself but he sent
[38:24] me why do you not understand my speech
[38:27] even because you cannot hear my word you
[38:31] are of your father the devil remember
[38:33] the two trees and the lust of your
[38:36] father ye will do he was a murderer from
[38:39] the beginning and Abode not in the truth
[38:42] because there is no truth in him when he
[38:44] speaks a lie he speaks of his own for he
[38:48] is a liar and the father of it it is
[38:51] most evident from these scriptures that
[38:53] no man in him of himself can hear God
[38:56] the ability
[38:58] has to be given him of God Matthew 16-1
[39:02] 17 Jesus answered and said unto him
[39:04] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for
[39:06] Flesh and Blood have not revealed it
[39:08] unto thee but my Father which is in
[39:11] heaven putting these verses together we
[39:14] see there is only one group of people
[39:17] and that is a very special group who are
[39:19] able to hear what the spirit says in
[39:22] each age it is one special group that
[39:25] receives the Revelation for each age
[39:28] that group is of God because the group
[39:33] that cannot hear it is not of God uh
[39:36] John 8:42 44 like we've read the group
[39:41] that can and does hear what the spirit
[39:43] is saying and receives the Revelation
[39:45] thereof is the group that was described
[39:47] in 1 Corinthians 2:6 these they are the
[39:51] ones who have the spirit of God they are
[39:54] the ones that are born of God they are
[39:56] baptized Ed into the body of the Lord
[39:59] Jesus Christ by his Spirit they are
[40:02] baptized with the Holy Ghost to further
[40:05] bring out what we have just said and to
[40:08] all uh and to also use a scripture that
[40:10] should be born in mind as we talk about
[40:13] it is that is uh about who it is that is
[40:18] baptized with the Holy Ghost Jesus says
[40:21] in John 6:45 it is written in the
[40:25] prophets and they shall shall all be
[40:28] taught of God but turn to Isaiah 54:13
[40:32] when this was taken and it reads and all
[40:35] thy children shall be taught of the Lord
[40:39] the all of God are the children of God
[40:43] thus it is that EV that the evidence of
[40:46] being a true child of God whom the
[40:49] spirit has come upon and indwells is
[40:51] again set forth as one that is taught
[40:54] the word by the Holy Ghost
[40:57] to me that is so
[41:01] incredible you see you cannot be taught
[41:05] of the Lord matters of fact if you if
[41:07] you've uh let's just hold your place
[41:09] because we're going to come right back
[41:10] and finish reading but let's skip up
[41:12] here to page
[41:15] 152 and
[41:18] um let's see um we're going
[41:23] to
[41:24] 152 and
[41:28] uh we're going to go one two three
[41:30] four uh four lines
[41:34] down and we're going to start there in
[41:36] very plain language y'all got that all
[41:40] right in very plain language the true
[41:42] bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[41:45] eternally though not expressed until
[41:48] each come
[41:49] forth uh in in the designated decreed
[41:53] season each member came forth uh as he
[41:57] each member become come forth it become
[41:59] expressed and took its place in the body
[42:02] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[42:06] word seed bride though she is feminine
[42:09] in designation she is also called the
[42:11] body of Christ it is very apparent that
[42:14] she ought to be called that for she was
[42:17] predestinated in him came from the same
[42:19] Source was eternally with him and is now
[42:23] manifesting God in a many membered body
[42:27] whereas God once God was manifested in
[42:30] one member even our Lord Jesus Christ
[42:33] now then here we are coming to a
[42:35] conclusion as the Eternal logos God was
[42:40] manifest in the Sun and
[42:42] Jesus and in Jesus dwelt all the
[42:45] fullness of the godhead bodily and that
[42:47] Eternal one was the father manifest in
[42:50] flesh and thereby gained the title of
[42:52] son even so we somebody say even so we
[42:57] Eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[43:02] became the many membered spoken words
[43:05] seed manifest in flesh those Eternal
[43:08] thoughts now manifest in flesh are the
[43:11] sons of God even as we are so called we
[43:15] did not become seed by the rebirth we
[43:19] were seed and therefore were reborn for
[43:23] only the elect can be reborn because we
[43:27] were seed is the reason that we could be
[43:30] quickened in nonseed there is nothing to
[43:33] Quicken well shout hallelujah hallelujah
[43:38] amen so so as we as we are going now
[43:41] amen we've got the two seeds they're
[43:43] they're now running continuity and the
[43:46] and the one seed is projecting that
[43:49] Eternal logos in flesh others are
[43:52] satisfied with just becoming a a a
[43:55] routine
[43:57] istic and is Satan a man that is very
[44:00] religious but Satan is receiving all the
[44:02] glory Satan loves the honor Satan loves
[44:05] The Prestige Satan loves for people to
[44:08] set in message uh churches without the
[44:11] life of God and just sucking in like a
[44:14] sponge all of the knowledge and makes
[44:16] them all puffed up and feel like they
[44:18] are they have it together don't be one
[44:20] of those kind of people we want the
[44:24] genuine life of God pulsating from our
[44:28] souls amen the word of God can you say
[44:31] Amen so it's not in the knowledge now
[44:34] are you understanding have I made that
[44:35] clear the difference between the
[44:37] Revelation and the knowledge the
[44:38] knowledge is all appear here and it has
[44:41] no effects on with with anything about
[44:44] us Revelation places you in the
[44:48] scripture to where you are God's very
[44:51] own body here on planet
[44:55] Earth that's powerful F amen that's
[44:59] powerful all right okay so so let's uh
[45:02] we're going to go back we're on page 140
[45:04] and all the way down to the last
[45:06] paragraph now brother brandham is going
[45:08] to talk about tongues and and share why
[45:12] tongues is not the evidence he says now
[45:16] we can begin to see why tongues is not
[45:19] the evidence of being baptized with the
[45:20] Holy Ghost it doesn't say in any age
[45:24] that that he that hath a tongue let him
[45:27] say what the spirit is saying that puts
[45:30] tongues interpretation thereof and
[45:33] prophecy Etc aside as an Evidence the
[45:38] evidence is hearing and he's got that
[45:41] capitalized hearing what the spirit says
[45:45] the spirit is talking yes the spirit is
[45:48] teaching that is exactly what Jesus said
[45:51] he would do when he came John
[45:53] 14:26 he will teach you all things and
[45:57] bring all things to your remembrance
[45:59] whatsoever I have said unto you and that
[46:03] is just what happened that is how the
[46:06] gospels were written these men are
[46:09] recalled to their minds uh uh and and
[46:12] and said that let's see these men had
[46:16] recalled to their minds by the Holy
[46:18] Ghost the very words that Jesus spake
[46:20] that is why the gospels are accurate
[46:23] they are perfect but the spirit did not
[46:25] only bring all things to their minds but
[46:28] he taught them further on the truth they
[46:30] had already had that is how Paul
[46:32] received his Revelations he said
[46:34] concerning it I certify you Brethren
[46:37] that the gospel which was preached of me
[46:38] is not after men for I neither received
[46:41] it of man neither was I taught it of man
[46:44] but by revelation of Jesus Christ
[46:47] Galatians 1: 111 and 12 he was taught by
[46:51] the Holy Ghost one one day when Jesus
[46:54] was upon the earth a certain important
[46:57] man came to him and this man said Rabbi
[47:00] we know you're a teacher sent from God
[47:02] but you will notice that Jesus Cuts him
[47:04] short he turned to Nicodemus and the
[47:07] words he spoke May well be paraphrased
[47:09] thusly I'm not a teacher I am the
[47:12] sacrificial lamb for sin I'm making
[47:16] possible the New Birth by my spirit but
[47:20] there is one there is coming one who is
[47:22] the teacher he's the holy spirit so when
[47:26] Jesus was upon the Earth he came as the
[47:29] lamb and as the prophet but when he come
[47:32] back upon the church by his Spirit he
[47:35] became the teacher so so now he's making
[47:38] it clear now you cannot you see the Old
[47:42] Testament was already the laws of God
[47:45] and so the laws were being placed upon a
[47:47] people without the new
[47:49] birth and it they couldn't handle it
[47:52] they couldn't live it they couldn't
[47:54] manifest it and I I tell you you you
[47:57] when you see lots of times there's too
[47:59] too many people sitting in in in in in
[48:01] our church circles that don't have the
[48:04] new birth they sympathize with it they
[48:07] want it they know it's right but they
[48:10] can't live it and it's just it's just
[48:12] going to constantly malice going this
[48:14] way and bickering this way and that why
[48:16] why can't they stay on the straight and
[48:18] narrow is because they've never been
[48:21] reborn you've got to have a new birth or
[48:26] the word will never have its effect and
[48:28] that's why that's why all of you young
[48:30] people and and um uh and and the young
[48:33] married couples we don't want a
[48:36] knowledge we want a birth we want the
[48:40] power of the holy spirit so that we can
[48:44] truly Manifest this to to to to the
[48:48] generation that we're going to be
[48:49] raising up can you say Amen because only
[48:53] then can they tell the difference
[48:55] between someone that got it here and
[48:58] someone that's got it here how the world
[49:00] needs to see that amen our our workers
[49:03] need to see that our children need to
[49:05] see that uh everywhere we go they need
[49:08] to see that it's not here but it's right
[49:10] here and so Jesus Is Telling Nicodemus
[49:14] Hey listen I I I thanks thanks for
[49:17] thanks for your compliment but that's
[49:19] not what I'm here for I am here for you
[49:24] to be born again Nicodemus is saying now
[49:27] listen I how can I be born again how can
[49:31] I go back into my mama's womb the second
[49:33] time see he was a smart man he was
[49:37] trying to understand but Jesus was
[49:39] letting him know listen I am coming for
[49:43] a new race I'm the first of the new race
[49:47] I am the word made flesh and I am coming
[49:51] to bring many sons unto Glory there's
[49:54] going to be many after me
[49:57] that is going to be birthed of the word
[50:00] just as I was birthed of the word and
[50:02] they're going oh they're going to be my
[50:06] body here on the earth they're going to
[50:08] live my life they're going to manifest
[50:11] who I am in a many membered
[50:14] body oh don't you just love that amen
[50:18] now now he says
[50:20] here uh uh in the next paragraph he says
[50:22] to every age we hear the same truth he
[50:27] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[50:29] spirit says to the churches but only a
[50:33] Spirit-filled man can hear the
[50:35] Revelation for that age none other can
[50:38] no sir they cannot because it's exactly
[50:41] what Paul said in 1 Corinthians
[50:44] 26-16 now we ought to make now that's
[50:46] ought to make you rejoice there is a
[50:49] most peculiar Doctrine in the air that
[50:51] is causing much misunderstanding and
[50:53] hard feelings for when the Pentecostal
[50:55] say You must must speak in tongues or
[50:58] you haven't been baptized with the Holy
[51:00] Ghost they are either denying that the
[51:03] great men like Knox Moody Taylor um
[51:07] gforth and others did not receive the
[51:10] holy ghost or saying what they all
[51:13] secretly uh that they all secretly spoke
[51:15] in tongues and were not aware of what
[51:16] was going
[51:17] on now that is not true no sir this is
[51:22] that is gross error tongues are not the
[51:25] evidence of being spirit fi it is simply
[51:28] one of the nine manifestations me
[51:31] mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 there is
[51:34] no scripture that says you receive the
[51:36] Holy Ghost uh that that you receive the
[51:39] Holy Spirit speaking in tongues or that
[51:41] you receive the Holy Spirit by speaking
[51:43] in tongues but it does say that after
[51:46] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[51:48] they spake in tongues and later on says
[51:52] that they prophesied today amongst many
[51:55] uh folks it is taken for granted that
[51:58] all who claim to to receive the Holy
[52:00] Ghost by speaking in tongues speak in a
[52:02] spiritual in a genuine spiritual
[52:05] tongue but this is not so for many
[52:08] people speak in a known tongue but under
[52:11] the influence of a wrong Spirit now uh
[52:15] let's let's say we are in a meeting and
[52:17] people are all speaking in tongues how
[52:19] can you know which tongue is from the
[52:22] spirit and which one is from the devil I
[52:24] have been amongst the Heathen where
[52:26] where they their Wizards drank blood out
[52:28] of a skull and spoke in tongues and
[52:30] interpreted and prophesied they can even
[52:33] write in tongues now if tongues is the
[52:36] evidence is the evidence he's
[52:38] capitalized the of receiving the Holy
[52:40] Ghost then every tongue would have to be
[52:43] of God but it has to be admitted by
[52:47] tongue uh tongues evidence people that
[52:50] there are false and true tongues for God
[52:53] has the genuine and Satan has the false
[52:56] so question is this who knows what is
[52:59] real who understood the language to know
[53:01] what's spoken who has the gift of
[53:04] discernment to know now when we get
[53:07] those answers we will have something to
[53:09] go on but until then we have to wonder
[53:12] about the source of the tongues you can
[53:15] see right now that if you back up a
[53:17] tongue's evidence and don't know what is
[53:20] being sad you have to finally come to
[53:22] the place where all tongues have to be
[53:24] of God that would lead us then to
[53:26] believe that the devil cannot speak in
[53:29] tongues that and that is not so no not
[53:32] for a minute any true missionary on a
[53:36] foreign field knows all too well that
[53:38] the Devils uh Devils speak in other
[53:41] tongues and the same as I know by know
[53:44] it by experience Pentecostal theologians
[53:47] admit that they have no scripture
[53:49] setting forth that people speak with
[53:51] tongues when baptized with the Holy
[53:53] Ghost they admit that they infer it from
[53:56] the the experience is set forth in the
[53:57] book of Acts where in three out of five
[54:01] times people spoke with tongues they
[54:03] also say without any Scripture that
[54:06] there are two kinds of tongues one is
[54:08] the tongue you speak when receiving the
[54:10] Holy Ghost and it is the evidence while
[54:12] later on if you believe you can receive
[54:15] the gift of tongues whereby you may
[54:17] speak often however they say having
[54:19] spoken in tongues as the evidence of
[54:22] receiving may never speak again uh you
[54:25] may never speak again once more we are
[54:28] anxious to know where this is found in
[54:30] the word if it isn't there then God has
[54:33] not spoken it and woe unto him who would
[54:36] add to that word but there is something
[54:38] in the word about this very subject that
[54:41] they ignore completely 1 Corinthians
[54:44] 13 it mentions tongues of men and angels
[54:48] these would be known and unknown tongues
[54:51] modern Pentecostals say that they can
[54:54] receive the Holy Ghost speaking in un
[54:56] known or Angelic tongues they have the
[54:58] cart before the horse for in Acts two
[55:02] the people spoke in a perfect dialect
[55:05] which even unbelievers heard and
[55:08] understood now so so now he's he's he's
[55:11] bringing it out here and we're not going
[55:12] to get into we are going to get into the
[55:14] gifts a little bit more maybe this next
[55:16] Wednesday night but um but here's now
[55:19] here he's he's bringing this in
[55:22] that you you know
[55:25] the as he was just saying you know some
[55:28] feel like you've got to have uh uh you
[55:30] might just speak in tongues one time
[55:32] when you receive the Holy Ghost and um
[55:35] now the group that I came out of um they
[55:37] believe that if you had not spoken
[55:39] tongues within 24 hours that you had
[55:41] lost the Holy Ghost so you could get the
[55:44] Holy Ghost and then if you if you
[55:47] haven't spoken tongues within 24 hours
[55:49] you have lost the Holy Ghost amen how
[55:53] would you like to be under that kind of
[55:54] teaching
[55:56] amen you you understand how I was up and
[55:59] down up and down I I read something
[56:02] somehow or another I I I got I got a um
[56:06] uh something from a church page today
[56:08] where a a guy you know a guy had left
[56:10] the Pentecostal or the apostolic
[56:12] movement and he had come back home and
[56:14] and um and so he's uh so on on the
[56:18] thread he was asking I want you to pray
[56:20] that the Holy Ghost will keep me this
[56:22] time and and and one of the first ones
[56:24] is is is an older lady and saying son
[56:27] welcome back to the full the Holy Ghost
[56:29] can keep you
[56:31] again and I'm thinking again he the the
[56:35] Holy Ghost didn't keep him the first
[56:36] time so what makes him think he's going
[56:38] to keep him again right so so it it was
[56:42] it you see it's it's an in- andout it's
[56:44] a work related thing but when though you
[56:48] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:50] brother you are sealed until the day of
[56:53] your Redemption
[56:56] that's why we want the baptism of the
[56:57] Holy Ghost it's a seal of God that there
[57:01] is nothing the devil can do to take you
[57:04] out of that oh there there ain't there
[57:07] ain't no religion can take you out
[57:09] there's no trial can take you out there
[57:11] is nothing that can take you out of that
[57:15] of that genuine walk with God can you
[57:17] say Amen so so tongues come and go are
[57:21] there real tongues yes yes there is amen
[57:25] but just as the there is a real
[57:28] knowledge and there is a heaven or a a
[57:32] Heavenly real knowledge and then there
[57:34] is the tree of tree of knowledge of Good
[57:36] and Evil amen uh there is also real
[57:41] tongues and then there is there are
[57:44] these others you
[57:46] cannot put tongues as any kind of an
[57:49] Evidence you can only go to the word and
[57:54] that word birth is the only thing that
[57:57] God gave us as the evidence and and
[58:00] there there there is quite an Evidence
[58:03] there man you can hide it you can hide
[58:05] it from the preacher you can hide it
[58:06] from Mama you can hide it from Daddy you
[58:08] can hide it but listen the seed on the
[58:11] inside of you you know whether there is
[58:14] a genuine birth that has taken place on
[58:17] the inside and I believe I believe the
[58:19] world will know it amen there will come
[58:21] that time now let's go on down to the
[58:23] next verse it says now when God is
[58:26] silent we had better be silent but where
[58:28] he has spoken it we had better speak too
[58:31] and say what he has already said he's
[58:33] told us the evidence or what would
[58:36] happen after being baptized with the
[58:38] Holy Ghost now here he's going to tell
[58:40] us was that we would have the teacher
[58:43] come and teach all
[58:46] truth but that teacher was an inside
[58:49] teacher not an outside teacher if the
[58:53] spirit wasn't inside you you wouldn't
[58:56] hear the truth and receive it by
[58:59] Revelation if you heard it every moment
[59:02] of the day that's the sign of the
[59:05] indwelling Spirit uh uh that was the
[59:08] sign of the indwelling spirit in the
[59:09] days of Paul those who were filled with
[59:12] the Holy Ghost heard the word received
[59:15] it and lived it those who did not have
[59:18] the spirit heard it only as carnal men
[59:21] and put a wrong interpretation on it and
[59:23] went into sin that is powerful to me
[59:26] that deserves some marking right there
[59:28] that's a that's a powerful uh paragraph
[59:32] amen it says in every age and every age
[59:35] is the age of the Holy Ghost for the
[59:37] True Believer I say in every age the
[59:40] evidence was the same those who had the
[59:42] spirit the teacher heard the word of uh
[59:46] heard the word and that spirit in them
[59:48] took the word and taught it reveal it to
[59:51] them and they were of the group that
[59:53] heard the messenger and his message and
[59:56] took it and lived it I know it was a
[59:58] great Temptation it is a great
[1:00:00] temptation to refer back to the day of
[1:00:02] Pentecost and also to the uh to the day
[1:00:05] when the Holy Ghost fell in the house of
[1:00:07] Cornelius and then set those two
[1:00:09] identical experiences as the evidence of
[1:00:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but on
[1:00:14] each of the on each occasion the tongues
[1:00:16] were understood by the listeners this is
[1:00:19] a far cry from the modern Babel of
[1:00:21] confusion of Pentecostal meetings if
[1:00:24] this were not enough to persuade us to
[1:00:26] leave off such reasoning what will we do
[1:00:29] when we are confronted with the fact
[1:00:32] that people who have never spoken
[1:00:33] tongues have some of the other eight
[1:00:35] manifestations in their lives such as
[1:00:37] the word of wisdom Discerning of spirits
[1:00:40] word of knowledge Faith healing and even
[1:00:43] Miracles and this observation is even
[1:00:46] more interesting in the light that
[1:00:47] tongues is the least of the nine gifts
[1:00:50] and so we see people who do not nor ever
[1:00:54] have spoke in tongue T use greater gifts
[1:00:57] than those who do speak in tongues we
[1:01:00] must
[1:01:01] discount such a Doctrine even more
[1:01:03] completely than before so you can see
[1:01:07] now that we cannot afford to say what
[1:01:10] the Bible has not said when the
[1:01:12] scripture teaches us that the work of
[1:01:15] the Holy Spirit and the manifestation of
[1:01:18] the blessed person of that blessed
[1:01:21] person is to bring the truth of each age
[1:01:25] to the Sea of that age then we know that
[1:01:29] the spirit has to be abiding in the
[1:01:32] person or he cannot receive the truth
[1:01:35] for that time this is exactly correct
[1:01:39] and if these ages bring anything out
[1:01:41] they surely bring and bear out this
[1:01:45] truth can you say Amen now now before
[1:01:51] I'm I'm thinking we're going to I'm
[1:01:53] going to stop right here on this and I
[1:01:56] just want to read I want us to look at a
[1:01:57] few scriptures before we close tonight
[1:02:00] because I want us to now when we go now
[1:02:03] brother brandham is going to he's going
[1:02:04] to he's going to now going to turn his
[1:02:06] attention on the next on the next uh uh
[1:02:09] Wednesday night he's going to start
[1:02:10] turning his attention to those who say
[1:02:13] I've received the Holy Ghost because I
[1:02:15] believe and then he's going to so he's
[1:02:17] going to start now you can't say I
[1:02:20] believe so I've received the Holy Ghost
[1:02:22] you receed the Holy Ghost after you
[1:02:25] believe and then he'll start going
[1:02:27] through uh through that so if you want
[1:02:28] to read that uh throughout the week that
[1:02:31] that would be good too but we'll go back
[1:02:33] through there but now brother I I want I
[1:02:35] want to show why brother brandham says
[1:02:37] it's an inside teacher not an outside
[1:02:42] external
[1:02:44] teacher it's an inside
[1:02:47] teacher and so let's look and I think
[1:02:50] this would be good uh if we turn there
[1:02:52] um I've got about six of them to to to
[1:02:55] to to give to you tonight before we
[1:02:57] close Jeremiah 31 and33 and if you want
[1:03:00] to turn and Mark that so you'll know
[1:03:06] um I want to give you some Old Testament
[1:03:09] scripture and some New Testament
[1:03:15] scripture Jeremiah 31
[1:03:20] and33 and when you get there Say Amen
[1:03:26] praise the
[1:03:28] Lord it says but this shall be the
[1:03:31] Covenant that I will make with the house
[1:03:33] of Israel after those days saeth the
[1:03:35] Lord I will put my law in their inward
[1:03:39] parts and write it in their hearts and
[1:03:43] will be their God and they shall be my
[1:03:45] people and they shall teach no more
[1:03:49] every man his neighbor every man his
[1:03:51] brother saying know the Lord for for
[1:03:56] they shall all know me from the least of
[1:04:00] them unto the greatest saeth the Lord
[1:04:03] for I will forgive their iniquity and
[1:04:05] will remember their sins now all right
[1:04:10] that now this is this is all going back
[1:04:12] remember what brother Bram was saying
[1:04:14] the all of God all the children of God
[1:04:17] shall be taught every one of us there is
[1:04:20] not Hallelujah I don't care who you are
[1:04:23] whether whether you feel like you're
[1:04:25] smart or whe you feel like you're the
[1:04:26] dumbest in the church amen you've got
[1:04:29] the promise that all of God's children
[1:04:33] shall be Tau and it's not not
[1:04:35] necessarily that you can that you're
[1:04:37] going to understand the whole Bible it's
[1:04:39] not necessarily meaning what we're not
[1:04:42] you you can it's not how many Bible
[1:04:44] verses you learn it's not how much of
[1:04:46] the message you can quote it's not it's
[1:04:49] the divine revelation God placed the
[1:04:52] laws inside you
[1:04:57] no one even has to tell you that it's
[1:04:59] that it was those when brother Brandon
[1:05:02] was over there in Africa and there was
[1:05:04] those 30,000 people that accepted Christ
[1:05:08] and was born again no one had to tell
[1:05:12] all of those naked women and naked men
[1:05:17] they were all in that
[1:05:19] Stadium he says brother brandham says
[1:05:21] all of a sudden the women 30,000 of them
[1:05:25] imagine that the women started they they
[1:05:28] covered themselves and separating
[1:05:31] themselves from men men separating
[1:05:33] themselves from women they were all
[1:05:35] trying to what was it the teacher moved
[1:05:42] inside they never heard a sermon never
[1:05:46] heard a sermon about it it was the Holy
[1:05:50] Spirit that moved in they didn't hear it
[1:05:54] here they heard it
[1:05:57] here and that's where that's where it is
[1:06:00] oh my oh we we we we we have to it's not
[1:06:03] the preacher shouldn't be beating us and
[1:06:05] having to beat us and having to beat us
[1:06:07] it should be a part of who we are on the
[1:06:10] inside the word God God's not a cowboy
[1:06:13] he's a Shepherd my sheep hear my voice
[1:06:17] and they follow another voice they will
[1:06:20] not follow it's that simple so when the
[1:06:22] Holy Spirit it's not that we don't grow
[1:06:24] it's not that we don't and it's and and
[1:06:27] and you and it's good to be able to take
[1:06:29] what you have here and to see it here
[1:06:32] and then you can stand up and say yes
[1:06:35] yes you see what I'm saying so we we but
[1:06:38] but if but you can have it here all day
[1:06:40] long and if you don't have it here then
[1:06:42] there's nothing that can there's there's
[1:06:44] there's nothing that it does does you no
[1:06:47] good well glory to God and I tell you
[1:06:51] what am man the seed of God knows those
[1:06:53] things now let's let's look at another
[1:06:56] let's let's look at another place
[1:06:59] um amen uh let's
[1:07:04] see I've got another I thought I had
[1:07:07] a praise the
[1:07:10] Lord okay so we're in Jeremiah
[1:07:13] 31 and then
[1:07:16] um uh why we let's go to Ezekiel 36 real
[1:07:19] quick Ezekiel 36 and 25
[1:07:27] oh this is this is
[1:07:29] Rich so rich I love
[1:07:33] him amen I tell
[1:07:35] you I love him so
[1:07:38] much Ezekiel 36 and 25 he says then I
[1:07:43] will sprinkle clean water upon you and
[1:07:46] you will be clean from all this now this
[1:07:48] is this is before the blood of Jesus now
[1:07:50] and you will be clean from all your
[1:07:52] filthiness and from all your Idols will
[1:07:54] I cleanse you
[1:07:55] and a new heart also will I give you and
[1:07:59] a new spirit will I put within you I
[1:08:02] will take away the Stony heart out of
[1:08:04] your flesh and will give you a heart of
[1:08:06] Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[1:08:10] you and then what does it do and cause
[1:08:14] you to walk in my statutes and ye shall
[1:08:20] keep my judgments and do them oh bless
[1:08:24] the Lord
[1:08:26] he's going to put his Spirit within us
[1:08:29] it's going to ignite the seed of God
[1:08:32] then that living logos becomes part of
[1:08:35] you you become part of it now let's
[1:08:37] let's see what the Apostle Paul says
[1:08:39] here in the book of Hebrews the 8th
[1:08:45] chapter
[1:08:50] amen this is such a good teaching I I I
[1:08:54] I I didn't know whether we should wait
[1:08:56] until the others got here too because
[1:08:58] this is such a good teaching for uh for
[1:09:01] the Youth but it's good for us all I
[1:09:04] wish we had a few more people here
[1:09:06] tonight
[1:09:07] amen uh I mean not saying that we're not
[1:09:09] proud of you being here amen but uh uh
[1:09:13] but this is this is good so so so if if
[1:09:16] you like it then maybe y'all can
[1:09:18] encourage your uh your brother and
[1:09:19] sister that's not here you need to go
[1:09:21] back and listen to that amen praise the
[1:09:23] Lord
[1:09:26] all right Hebrews 8 uh uh 8 and10 for
[1:09:31] this is the Covenant that I will make
[1:09:33] with the house of Israel after those
[1:09:35] days now let me just stop right here
[1:09:37] okay so in all in in all of the
[1:09:40] covenants that has been made it's it is
[1:09:44] uh or in where they're talking about
[1:09:46] this Covenant the New Covenant that is
[1:09:48] coming always talks about the house of
[1:09:50] Israel so many people want to try to put
[1:09:53] it I don't care whether it's it's it's
[1:09:54] Joy
[1:09:55] to uh where it says you know uh where
[1:09:59] where it's talking about your sons and
[1:10:01] your daughters and and the spirit will
[1:10:03] be poured out it he's he's dealing with
[1:10:04] Israel he's dealing with well amen the
[1:10:07] Covenant was given to Israel the the
[1:10:10] original Covenant was Israel's Covenant
[1:10:12] but and this holy spirit that is going
[1:10:15] to be poured out remember was given to
[1:10:19] the Jews that second Covenant was given
[1:10:22] to the Jews but the Jews turned it down
[1:10:24] and the apostle Paul says I now turn to
[1:10:27] the Gentiles so so what the co what
[1:10:31] Covenant that the the Jew turned down
[1:10:35] the Jew wanted to keep the first
[1:10:37] Covenant of law of
[1:10:39] Moses and God was given them the
[1:10:42] Covenant of Grace they refused that
[1:10:45] Covenant of Grace amen and of course we
[1:10:49] understand by the other prophecies that
[1:10:50] the Gentiles it was all a plan of God
[1:10:52] God blinded their eyes to miss that
[1:10:56] Covenant so that you and I can be
[1:10:57] brought in glory to God so when you read
[1:11:01] these amen it's it's got a compound
[1:11:04] meaning it is it's it's it's it's it's
[1:11:06] it's a a New Zion the the Heavenly
[1:11:09] Jerusalem amen all right so let's let's
[1:11:12] continue on this is the Covenant I will
[1:11:14] make the house of Israel after those
[1:11:15] days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws
[1:11:18] in their heart and write them or in
[1:11:21] their mind and write them in their
[1:11:23] hearts I will be to them a God and they
[1:11:28] will be to me a people and they shall
[1:11:31] not teach every man his
[1:11:33] neighbor and every man his brother
[1:11:36] saying know the Lord for all somebody
[1:11:39] say all shall know me from the least to
[1:11:43] the greatest again brother bram's
[1:11:44] already dealt with the all it's only the
[1:11:47] children of God it's only the elect of
[1:11:49] God they're the only ones that's going
[1:11:51] to see it and the Holy Spirit is going
[1:11:54] to ignite that seed within them so that
[1:11:58] they can hear let's go to the 10th
[1:11:59] chapter Hebrews 10 and
[1:12:05] 10 we want to we sure want to uh keep
[1:12:08] brother Donald in our prayers I as he's
[1:12:10] going getting those those um that those
[1:12:15] uh teeth taken care of today I know it
[1:12:18] must be
[1:12:19] painful uh Hebrews 10 and 10 by the
[1:12:22] which will we are Sanctified through the
[1:12:25] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:12:28] once for all that's that water every
[1:12:30] priest standeth daily ministering and
[1:12:32] offering of times the same sacrifice
[1:12:35] which can never take away sins but this
[1:12:38] man after it offered one sacrifice for
[1:12:41] sins forever sat down on the right hand
[1:12:43] of God and from henceforth expecting
[1:12:46] till his enemies become his foot stol
[1:12:48] for by one offering he has perfected
[1:12:51] forever them that are Sanctified so the
[1:12:55] sin question is dealt with Christ has
[1:12:58] come the blood of Jesus has wiped out
[1:13:01] all of your transgressions the blood has
[1:13:04] totally eliminated every Everything the
[1:13:08] the middle wall of petition that was
[1:13:11] separating The Sinner this the the
[1:13:14] sinful son from his heavenly father that
[1:13:18] middle wall is now broke down Christ has
[1:13:23] paid the price he has paid the price for
[1:13:28] your sin now the Father and Son can come
[1:13:33] together there can be a
[1:13:36] reuniting to where the the Fallen Gods
[1:13:41] the Fallen miniature Gods can connect
[1:13:44] with the God Amen and they can Reign
[1:13:48] here on this in in this life Adam is
[1:13:52] back with Father Again reunited again
[1:13:55] and are you understanding so Christ tore
[1:13:58] down the middle wall of petition amen
[1:14:01] now you always were a son but you were
[1:14:04] in sin and there was no way that the
[1:14:06] Holy Ghost would ever come on you
[1:14:08] because the Holy Ghost is Holy and you
[1:14:10] are a sinner well glory to God but when
[1:14:14] the blood came in and took care of the
[1:14:15] sinner
[1:14:17] problem now there's no guilt now there's
[1:14:21] no sin now there's no wrongs you are
[1:14:25] just as righteous as God Is Right the
[1:14:29] Bible we just read it he has perfected
[1:14:32] forever that one
[1:14:35] sacrifice totally took care of you and
[1:14:38] your relation with God now watch that
[1:14:42] amen that's that that that's that's
[1:14:44] exactly what Jeremiah and Ezekiel were
[1:14:46] saying now watch he says for by once
[1:14:49] offering 14th verse hath he perfected
[1:14:51] forever them that are Sanctified now
[1:14:54] watch what's the holy ghost whereof the
[1:14:56] Holy Ghost also is a witness to us okay
[1:15:01] how do I know how do I know that my sins
[1:15:04] are forgiven because God has sent his
[1:15:07] holy spirit upon you it's no longer God
[1:15:10] on this side of the Great Wall amen and
[1:15:12] you on this side the wall has been taken
[1:15:14] down now the great Holy Spirit has come
[1:15:17] over and filled you with do you still
[1:15:20] have mind battles yep do you still do
[1:15:22] you still go through those days of of of
[1:15:26] brother you're going to have more mind
[1:15:27] battles now than you did back then
[1:15:29] you're going to have more trials now
[1:15:30] than you did back then because Satan
[1:15:32] knows that there is a miniature God on
[1:15:36] the earth that is going to wreak havoc
[1:15:38] to his kingdom and Buddy he's going to
[1:15:41] start fighting you like you've never
[1:15:42] been fought but don't worry you and Papa
[1:15:46] are back
[1:15:48] together you're not on this side and
[1:15:50] God's on this side he sends the Holy
[1:15:53] Spirit to you
[1:15:55] amen
[1:15:57] ah oh the devil says oh be you but you
[1:16:01] just tell that devil shut
[1:16:03] up you've got a weapon you've got the
[1:16:05] atomic weapon can you say Amen it says
[1:16:08] 15th verse whereof the Holy Ghost also
[1:16:11] is a witness to us for after that he had
[1:16:14] said before this is the Covenant that I
[1:16:17] will make with them after those days
[1:16:18] sayith the Lord I will put my laws in
[1:16:21] their heart and in their minds will I
[1:16:22] write them and their sins and iniquities
[1:16:25] will I remember no more now where
[1:16:27] remission of these is there is no more
[1:16:30] offering for sin you know what he's
[1:16:32] trying to say is there where the sin is
[1:16:36] gone so Christ didn't have to go back
[1:16:38] and redy and go back and lay down his
[1:16:41] life again he is so
[1:16:44] confident God doesn't have a second plan
[1:16:46] God doesn't say I might need somebody
[1:16:48] else to die or I might have to do God
[1:16:51] doesn't have to he done it
[1:16:53] once and and he done it for all he saved
[1:16:57] you once and he is able to keep you the
[1:17:01] blood that God shed on Calvary is he's
[1:17:05] it's you'll never exhaust that blood
[1:17:08] there you I don't care how many times
[1:17:10] you fallen today and how many times you
[1:17:12] fall tomorrow and how many times you're
[1:17:14] going to fall a year from now I just
[1:17:16] want to tell you the sin question has
[1:17:19] been dealt with the blood of Jesus
[1:17:22] Christ has taken care of all your
[1:17:29] sins Oh Glory to
[1:17:32] God now the seed was always in you the
[1:17:35] seed there there was always that
[1:17:37] something in you but it couldn't live
[1:17:41] but now when the Holy Spirit comes back
[1:17:43] upon you now it's written in your
[1:17:45] conscience it's written in your heart
[1:17:48] well praise the Lord amen you love it
[1:17:51] amen hallelujah now all
[1:17:57] right
[1:17:59] now so the Holy Ghost want to I didn't
[1:18:01] bring my
[1:18:03] hany the Holy Ghost is is uh
[1:18:07] again what we've just read here on the
[1:18:09] Holy Ghost has nothing to do with
[1:18:11] tongues or prophecy it has everything to
[1:18:14] do with writing my law in their mind
[1:18:19] inscribing my word in their heart that's
[1:18:23] the promise
[1:18:26] you say yeah but I want to talk about
[1:18:28] the tongues and I want to well there
[1:18:30] there are the scriptures amen they're
[1:18:32] they're in Isaiah 28 and8 uh we'll turn
[1:18:34] there real quickly I'm not going to hold
[1:18:36] you uh too much longer but let's let's
[1:18:38] look here at at at Isaiah 28 and 8 and
[1:18:42] this is a good one for for for uh for
[1:18:45] you to have in your in in your Bible
[1:18:47] brother brandham uses this a lot amen
[1:19:01] now he's he's he's talking we're fixing
[1:19:05] to see that there's the promise it's a
[1:19:08] prophecy that is to come to pass it's a
[1:19:10] prophecy I'm I'm sending it but it's
[1:19:14] going to fall it's going to fall on
[1:19:18] nonseed and and and and so let's read
[1:19:22] for all tables are full of vomit and
[1:19:24] filthiness
[1:19:25] so that there is no place
[1:19:27] clean Whom Shall he teach
[1:19:29] knowledge what's the Holy Spirit
[1:19:32] knowledge Whom Shall he make understand
[1:19:34] Doctrine them that are weaned from the
[1:19:37] milk and drawn from the breast for
[1:19:39] precept must be upon precept precept
[1:19:42] upon precept line upon line line upon
[1:19:45] line here a little and there a little
[1:19:48] for with stammering lips and another
[1:19:52] tongue will I speak to this people
[1:19:55] amen now brother brandom talks about
[1:19:57] that about the stammering lips and he
[1:19:59] shows them how how how it happens
[1:20:02] and speaking in tongues is he says they
[1:20:05] they and and he and he gives those
[1:20:07] illustrations as you've heard um um uh
[1:20:10] many times he says he says to whom he
[1:20:14] said this is the rest wherewith ye uh
[1:20:18] may cause the weary to rest this is the
[1:20:21] refreshing yet they would not hear but
[1:20:25] the Lord was unto them precept upon
[1:20:26] precept precept upon precept line upon
[1:20:29] line line upon line here a little and
[1:20:31] there a little that they might go and
[1:20:34] fall backward and be broken and snared
[1:20:38] and
[1:20:39] taken and we understand that that was a
[1:20:41] ful that the prophecy was fulfilled now
[1:20:45] the Holy Spirit came and they rejected
[1:20:48] it but the elect of the age did receive
[1:20:52] it the elect of the age did did can you
[1:20:55] say Amen now we so so we can see even in
[1:21:01] Joel's prophecy when when Joel amen you
[1:21:04] know the pouring uh uh my you know pour
[1:21:08] out my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[1:21:10] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[1:21:12] and the uh young man shall have visions
[1:21:15] and the old man and he says and and I
[1:21:18] will pour out amen as the former rain
[1:21:21] and the latter rain and brother brandham
[1:21:24] talk us he said now go back and look at
[1:21:26] the former Reign see what the former
[1:21:28] Reign says and when you go back and look
[1:21:30] at what the former Reign and you look at
[1:21:33] the meaning of that in there there in
[1:21:35] the Scripture it meant
[1:21:39] teaching so when the Holy Spirit was to
[1:21:42] come even fall in this last day the
[1:21:46] former and the latter Reign it would be
[1:21:49] a
[1:21:50] restoration of the
[1:21:53] teachings of the apostles amen then the
[1:21:57] latter Reign would come upon that and
[1:22:00] cause the word to live in you it first
[1:22:04] of all had to come in a profit form and
[1:22:08] in order for you to receive the word in
[1:22:11] its fullness and become word made flesh
[1:22:14] does that make sense or no amen so so I
[1:22:18] I'm thankful for that amen there
[1:22:21] Deuteronomy 32 and and and and one it
[1:22:23] says my do Doctrine shall fall or two 32
[1:22:26] and two my Doctrine shall fall as rain
[1:22:28] my speech shall dis steal as the
[1:22:30] Dew amen I'm so thankful for that amen
[1:22:35] Hosea Hosea 6
[1:22:37] And1 it says come and let us re or
[1:22:41] return unto the Lord he hath torn and
[1:22:43] will heal us he has smitten and will
[1:22:45] bind us up after two days he will revive
[1:22:48] us and in the third day he will raise us
[1:22:50] up and we shall live in his sight we
[1:22:53] went through the Dark Ages went through
[1:22:55] the Dark Ages amen but then all of a
[1:22:58] sudden here here here came two days
[1:23:01] started coming again and then the layot
[1:23:04] of see and age then the third day amen
[1:23:07] we were going to rise again after two
[1:23:09] days he will revive us in the third day
[1:23:12] he will raise us up and we shall live in
[1:23:14] his sight and then shall we know if we
[1:23:17] follow on to know the Lord he going
[1:23:20] forth as prepared as the morning and he
[1:23:22] shall come to us as the rain as the
[1:23:26] latter and the former Reign unto the
[1:23:28] Earth in other words he's going to come
[1:23:30] with Doctrine and with
[1:23:33] power right oh that makes me want to
[1:23:37] shout he's going to come with Doctrine
