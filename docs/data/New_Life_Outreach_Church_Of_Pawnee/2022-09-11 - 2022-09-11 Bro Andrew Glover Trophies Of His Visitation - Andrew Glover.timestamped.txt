[1:28:01] the visitation of the spirit of god
[1:28:04] quickens the seed of god and brings it
[1:28:06] to life now once you walked with a great
[1:28:08] big cigar in your mouth you had a bunch
[1:28:10] of cigarettes and you women had short
[1:28:12] hair and painted and carried on and wore

[1:28:24] more shorts for me no more liquor for me
[1:28:26] no more lying no more stealing the more
[1:28:28] this see the spirit that raised him from
[1:28:30] the dead dwelling in you will also bring
[1:28:33] your mortal bodies the dust of the earth
[1:28:36] into subjection amen you see what it is
[1:28:39] subjection to what to the word and who
[1:28:41] is christ christ is the word not in the
[1:28:44] subjection to theology but subjection to
[1:28:48] the word
[1:28:49] come on now if we're going to take a
[1:28:51] body change our bodies have got to be
[1:28:53] brought under subjection to the word see
[1:28:56] not a part of the word but the full word
[1:28:58] then you say well these things oh i
[1:28:59] think that's all right amen for women to
[1:29:02] wear slacks when the word said no it
[1:29:04] quickens you to that you are drowned oh
[1:29:07] god you are drawn to it see you become a
[1:29:10] part of the word i say it like this if
[1:29:12] there's ever been a time and then to
[1:29:14] realize the seriousness of the
[1:29:16] visitation of god the time is now if
[1:29:20] there's ever been a time to recognize
[1:29:23] that okay how can i say it lord to
[1:29:26] recognize the meetings that you're
[1:29:28] sitting in to recognize the sermons that
[1:29:30] you're hearing to move into the
[1:29:32] atmosphere that you're i'm not we don't
[1:29:34] know how many more of these meetings

[1:29:37] many more services we don't know how
[1:29:38] many more gatherings we're going to have
[1:29:40] why do we let one minute of it pass us
[1:29:42] by we ought to move into the atmosphere
[1:29:44] of it you see because this is not the
[1:29:46] ideas of a man being preached it's the
[1:29:49] gospel being preached like it was in the
[1:29:51] days of noah you know what it is it's
[1:29:53] fanaticism to the world amen but it's

[1:30:00] and the ark of safety is christ well i'm
[1:30:02] this close to a devil sometimes we'll
[1:30:04] cut his head off brother andrew i don't

[1:30:23] is that's a devil that's come in the
[1:30:25] church and a bunch of penny-wasted
[1:30:27] preachers that didn't have a backbone
[1:30:29] with nothing bow their knee and let that
[1:30:32] devil invade the pulpit and we got kids
[1:30:34] that's been raised in the message they
[1:30:36] don't even know what the prophet said i
[1:30:38] say it's time to take the gloves off and
[1:30:40] cut the head of that devil and bring the
[1:30:42] liberty bring the word back in the
[1:30:44] church until every heart every family

[1:31:15] further and say it's this message or
[1:31:17] nothing
[1:31:18] [Applause]
[1:31:20] you got to come subject to what the
[1:31:21] prophet said if you're going to move
[1:31:22] into the ark of safety in the age you're
[1:31:25] living in see it's a serious power see i

[1:32:24] preaching you as victorious just in the
[1:32:27] millennium he was not preaching you as a
[1:32:29] trophy of god just on the other side but
[1:32:32] brother william he was saying as long as
[1:32:34] they remain on the earth may they be
[1:32:37] trophies of the grace of almighty god
[1:32:40] may they be trophies of his visitation
[1:32:42] may they be more than just church
[1:32:44] members can i preach this morning may
[1:32:46] they be more than just singers may they
[1:32:48] be more than just clothers may they be
[1:32:50] more than just young people may they be
[1:32:52] a city which will be a light that will
[1:32:54] be set on the hillside come on you know
[1:32:56] brother said like this he said watch he
[1:32:58] reads matthew 5 ye are the light of the
[1:33:00] world you are a city that is set on a
[1:33:03] hill that cannot be hid neither do men
[1:33:05] light a candle put it under a bushel put
[1:33:08] it on the candlestick and give it the
[1:33:09] light and give the light unto all that
[1:33:11] are in the house so let your light so
[1:33:13] shine before men that they may see your
[1:33:16] good works come on what did peter say he
[1:33:19] said evil doers will always speak
[1:33:21] against the move of god they will always
[1:33:23] speak against the works of god if you're
[1:33:26] waiting on the critic to be quiet before
[1:33:28] you recognize that this is god you'll
[1:33:30] never recognize because you'll criticize
[1:33:33] for they can't criticize no more but
[1:33:35] somebody's going to recognize somebody's
[1:33:38] going to recognize this is more than a
[1:33:39] bunch of quotes this is more than a
[1:33:41] bunch of pictures this is more than a
[1:33:43] bunch of tapes this is elohim returning
[1:33:45] to this age in the power of this
[1:33:47] resurrection in the power of his
[1:33:49] anointing to lead you to a body change
[1:33:52] to lead you from the realm of mortality
[1:33:54] to the realm of immortality to lead your
[1:33:56] corruptable to incorruption to lead your
[1:33:59] sickness into health this is the
[1:34:01] visitation of god in this generation
[1:34:04] you remember the prophet of god said he
[1:34:05] was driving down the road and he said
[1:34:07] there was a sign a billboard and the
[1:34:09] billboard said hungry three miles he
[1:34:12] said see if i needed an automobile he
[1:34:15] said it would have never done no good he
[1:34:17] said but i was hungry and he said when i
[1:34:19] saw the sign he said the advertisement
[1:34:22] paid off and the advertisement pulled me
[1:34:24] to the restaurant he said in this age it
[1:34:27] pays to advertise he said that it won't
[1:34:29] it pay christians to advertise
[1:34:33] come on now he said what is the
[1:34:35] advertisement you got to have like the
[1:34:37] things in the world it'll never attract
[1:34:39] the attention of the people now if a man
[1:34:41] would have been looking for an
[1:34:42] automobile he would have went on past
[1:34:44] the sign oh god if he had been looking
[1:34:46] for an automobile he went on past the
[1:34:48] sign if he had been looking for another
[1:34:50] church service he wouldn't pass the sign
[1:34:53] if he would have been looking for
[1:34:54] another idea he would have went on past
[1:34:56] the sign but i heard a prophet say
[1:34:58] you're getting your last sign
[1:35:01] come on now if you pass this sign
[1:35:04] there's no more signs coming according
[1:35:06] to the bible the final sign would be the
[1:35:09] sign of jonas which would be the sign of
[1:35:11] the resurrection which would be the sign
[1:35:13] of the son of man the messianic sign
[1:35:15] returning this church listen if you pass
[1:35:17] this side there is no more signs coming
[1:35:20] it's the end
[1:35:21] come on it's the end are you hearing me
[1:35:24] it's the end if a man would have been
[1:35:26] looking for something else he would have
[1:35:27] never come so i believe that the
[1:35:30] christian is god's billboard i believe
[1:35:32] each one of you is god's billboard and
[1:35:34] we don't have so much carrying on about
[1:35:35] what we do just simply live a life such
[1:35:38] a life that'll make people hungry to be
[1:35:40] like you how many knows that a trophy
[1:35:43] must be advertised
[1:35:45] it must be displayed nobody receives a
[1:35:47] trophy and wants to hide it come on now
[1:35:50] nobody receives a trophy and goes and
[1:35:52] puts it under their bed or goes and puts
[1:35:54] it in their closet amen but when they
[1:35:56] receive a trophy they want everybody to
[1:35:59] see they want everybody to hear they
[1:36:02] want everybody to behold
[1:36:05] are you hearing me trophies must be
[1:36:07] displayed i love the definition of the
[1:36:09] word trophy it is something that is
[1:36:11] gained that is achieved or is given in
[1:36:14] victory or conquest especially when
[1:36:17] preserved or mounted as a memorial thy
[1:36:20] spirit rope though god thy visitation
[1:36:23] will preserve my spirit thy visitation
[1:36:27] of god will preserve the spirit of the
[1:36:29] believer who receives that visitation
[1:36:32] and by receiving that visitation you
[1:36:34] will become more than just a member of
[1:36:36] new life outreach you will become more
[1:36:38] than just a person sitting on a pier
[1:36:41] carrying a quote book reading a few
[1:36:43] scriptures you will become oh god you
[1:36:46] will become a trophy of the dissertation
[1:36:48] of the angel and the age that you're
[1:36:50] living in you will be put on display it
[1:36:53] is something that's given as a
[1:36:54] representation of the memorial as a
[1:36:56] medal now listen now come on hunters it
[1:36:59] is a game animal
[1:37:01] it is a game animal or a fish amen and
[1:37:04] is mounted for a trophy it's usually
[1:37:07] used attributively so a trophy is
[1:37:10] connected to an attribute well thank god
[1:37:13] for a prophet who said god's secret
[1:37:15] mystery was in the back part of god's
[1:37:17] mind there was something he was trying
[1:37:20] and was going to achieve a trophy is an
[1:37:23] achievement oh god a trophy is something
[1:37:26] that is mounted it is something that is
[1:37:28] put into the onlooker's view it is
[1:37:30] something that somebody can look at
[1:37:33] and they can see it's a trophy see he
[1:37:36] had a motive in doing it in order to let
[1:37:38] himself be expressed because first there
[1:37:41] wasn't a moon a star an atom a molecule
[1:37:44] or anything but he was god see and god
[1:37:47] is an object of worship and there wasn't
[1:37:49] nothing to worship him so in his great
[1:37:52] mind he wanted these attributes to be
[1:37:54] expressed in him was love in him was to
[1:37:57] be a father in him was to be a son in
[1:38:00] him was to be a savior in him was to be
[1:38:02] a healer all these great attributes we
[1:38:05] see were in god
[1:38:08] listen you didn't put them in him they
[1:38:10] were already in him the only thing you
[1:38:12] did was you pulled them out of him and
[1:38:14] become a trophy of the attributes that
[1:38:16] was in him from before the foundation of
[1:38:19] the world no wonder a prophet could
[1:38:21] stand and say you are trophies of his
[1:38:24] visitation your eyes have seen things
[1:38:26] your ears have heard things your heart
[1:38:29] has believed things your mouth is
[1:38:31] confessing things that has not been
[1:38:32] thought of seeing spoken heard since i
[1:38:35] put this mystery in the back part of my
[1:38:37] mind but in the end times there would
[1:38:39] come a voice called the voice of the
[1:38:41] sabbath angel who would break into the
[1:38:43] mind of god and would begin to declare
[1:38:45] the thoughts of god and you would become
[1:38:47] more than just tears you would become
[1:38:49] more than just showers you would become
[1:38:51] more than just dancers you have become
[1:38:53] trophies by the visitation of the mind
[1:38:56] of god in the age of living

[1:39:32] come into you to light up this h
[1:39:37] the word that's in you
[1:39:39] is the lie of the age
[1:39:42] the word has come into you to light up

[1:40:46] reveal them hoping there would be eyes
[1:40:48] upon the earth to see what he was
[1:40:50] revealing he revealed that brother josh
[1:40:53] knowing when the revelation broke there
[1:40:55] would be eyes to see it there would be
[1:40:57] ears to hear it there would be a heart
[1:40:59] to receive it there would be a mouth to
[1:41:01] confess it come on can i go a step
[1:41:03] further there would be a body to
[1:41:05] manifest it
[1:41:07] there would be a body oh god there would
[1:41:10] be a body on the earth in position to
[1:41:12] receive the word and to manifest the
[1:41:15] promise of that word listen to the word

[1:43:47] eagles being born under the influence of
[1:43:50] the holy ghost listen i am not a starchy
[1:43:52] stiff self-righteous aristocratic
[1:43:54] message believer i am a son of god we're
[1:43:57] the gene of god i've been lit by the
[1:43:59] power of god i'm not staying here i'm
[1:44:01] not getting cold i'm not getting formal
[1:44:04] you can die in the smoke but there's
[1:44:06] some people here who was born in the
[1:44:08] fire and the smoke will kill them they
[1:44:10] got to be under the influence where
[1:44:12] there's power to lift them out of
[1:44:13] situations where there's power to raise
[1:44:16] them out of circumstances
[1:44:20] somebody needs to cut that devil's head
[1:44:21] off and be a man about this message and
[1:44:24] say what the prophet said
[1:44:26] [Applause]
[1:44:29] well don't say nothing all right that's
[1:44:31] what the pentecostals did and that's why
[1:44:33] they got televisions in their home
[1:44:35] come on somebody because nobody took a
[1:44:38] stand to express god in the age we're
[1:44:40] living
[1:44:42] listen
[1:44:43] this may not be popular but it's a truth
[1:44:45] anyhow god needs more than your feet he
[1:44:48] needs more than your hands he needs more
[1:44:50] than your eyes he needs your voice to
[1:44:52] say what a prophet has already said
[1:44:56] [Applause]

[1:45:01] said and you're not hug

[1:45:06] don't push me
[1:45:08] i am saying what he's saying
[1:45:10] i am saying what he said the problem is
[1:45:12] you've been taking what a man said he
[1:45:14] said instead of hearing for yourself
[1:45:16] what he said what a man said he said
[1:45:18] ain't what he said a man never said okay
[1:45:21] brother man never said god please play
[1:45:23] in heaven he said god was the father of
[1:45:25] truth come on somebody but a man got
[1:45:28] involved and twisted things it's got
[1:45:30] people believing all kinds of crazy
[1:45:31] things and we got young people sitting
[1:45:33] in pews ripped on pornography
[1:45:37] come on somebody you know why because
[1:45:39] you silence the watchman in the tower
[1:45:41] every devil in hell will infiltrate that
[1:45:44] church but there are some thoughtful
[1:45:45] ministry there are some young men there
[1:45:48] are some young women there are some
[1:45:49] believers here who have not come to this
[1:45:52] age to express a man's idea brother
[1:45:54] manuel we have come to this age to
[1:45:56] manifest the foul god
[1:46:03] well brother andrew i think it's getting
[1:46:04] a little too quiet amen i'll tell you
[1:46:06] what something the other day has it ever
[1:46:08] dawned on you we are not following the
[1:46:10] pillar of us we are following the pillar
[1:46:12] of fire
[1:46:14] but we're not following a stick of ice
[1:46:16] we are following the pillar of high you
[1:46:18] know what the pillar of fire does the
[1:46:20] pillar of fire comes into a room and it
[1:46:22] begins to whirl the pillar of power
[1:46:24] begins to move it begins to go up and
[1:46:26] down the aisles it begins to go in
[1:46:28] between the pews and it begins to brood
[1:46:30] and your seed only inside of you begins
[1:46:33] to yield to the fire of god and that
[1:46:36] seed becomes expressed
[1:46:39] are you hearing me you didn't come here
[1:46:41] just to manifest the church you didn't
[1:46:42] come there just to manifest an office
[1:46:44] you come here to be a trophy
[1:46:50] real preacher i don't like that i done
[1:46:52] said it i meant it i stand behind it and
[1:46:54] i represent it
[1:46:55] [Applause]
[1:46:56] what a prophet taught
[1:46:59] well somebody shot glory outs on me my
[1:47:01] or something it's the truth anyhow there
[1:47:04] is no devil safe in the house of god
[1:47:08] don't say nothing don't say nothing okay
[1:47:10] we won't say nothing before long that's
[1:47:12] why you got girls wearing makeup again
[1:47:14] those won't nobody say nothing that's
[1:47:16] why we got deacons married three and
[1:47:17] four times because what nobody say my
[1:47:20] question is how long is it going to be
[1:47:22] before there's so many elephants in the
[1:47:23] room we can't even shout no more because
[1:47:25] we won't say anything about the devil
[1:47:27] that's trying to steal the sound
[1:47:30] but i think it's time to take your
[1:47:32] credit and kick that devil back to the
[1:47:34] hell that he come out of i think it's
[1:47:36] time to take back your possession i
[1:47:38] think it's time to take back your tour
[1:47:40] come on by the way i think it's time to
[1:47:42] take our dance back i think it's time to
[1:47:44] take a shot back i think it's time to
[1:47:46] take the ability to take the gloves off
[1:47:48] and just say what the prophet said it's
[1:47:51] time to take it back
[1:47:55] keep that devil out of here i said
[1:47:58] some of y'all right now won't kick that
[1:48:00] name cause he's telling you well if

[1:48:03] going to torment you if you come against
[1:48:05] me i'm going to entice you can i let you
[1:48:07] in a little secret that devil's going to
[1:48:09] torment you whether you kick him or not
[1:48:11] so i decided i'm going to kick him and
[1:48:13] give him a run for his money
[1:48:16] i'm gonna kick you in the prophets
[1:48:18] you're gonna kick him in the pews and
[1:48:20] we're gonna kick him back into hell we

[2:52:33] and um
[2:52:35] we've we've met them
[2:52:37] uh
[2:52:38] some years back and
[2:52:40] and um we're just
[2:52:43] delighted that they're here with us this

[2:52:48] and um
[2:52:50] so how how long have you all been
[2:52:51] married now uh tomorrow will be 30 years
[2:52:54] 30 years tomorrow isn't that wonderful
[2:52:58] amen
[2:53:03] and i'm glad i'm glad we get to do this
[2:53:06] here this is going to be the first vowel
[2:53:07] renewal and then here uh you know in a
[2:53:10] week or so we're also going to have our
[2:53:11] first wedding we've had weddings since
[2:53:14] since we've been here but it's been
[2:53:15] other places
[2:53:17] and so uh we're just we're just glad to
[2:53:19] do that this will be the you'll be the
[2:53:21] first
[2:53:24] and um
[2:53:26] as i as i begin to think about
[2:53:28] about
[2:53:29] marriage and i just wanted to express
[2:53:31] this before we do the vowels
[2:53:34] is is
[2:53:35] you know
[2:53:36] marriage is an incredible thing and the
[2:53:38] devil is is
[2:53:39] is doing everything in his power
[2:53:42] in this hour
[2:53:43] to to
[2:53:45] minimize
[2:53:46] and destroy the family
[2:53:50] and
[2:53:51] you young men and
[2:53:53] and and you young ladies and
[2:53:55] you know it's it's it's it's easy to uh
[2:53:59] look at that pretty girl and that
[2:54:01] handsome guy
[2:54:03] and uh
[2:54:04] and
[2:54:05] and say boy i want that one and the
[2:54:07] other one said yeah i want you to
[2:54:12] but the facts are
[2:54:14] here in oklahoma there are more divorces
[2:54:17] than there are marriages
[2:54:20] half of the half of the marriages end up
[2:54:22] in divorces
[2:54:24] this is this is an incredible thing
[2:54:27] and so
[2:54:28] what
[2:54:29] when you see somebody like this a couple
[2:54:32] like this 30 years of marriage
[2:54:35] it's somebody that has been committed
[2:54:38] a husband to his wife
[2:54:40] and a wife
[2:54:42] to her husband
[2:54:43] because it does take submission to one
[2:54:45] another even though our brother is the
[2:54:47] head it takes love between the two
[2:54:51] can you say amen
[2:54:53] and we need these kind of examples
[2:54:56] and it and it
[2:54:57] it it makes me think of the
[2:55:01] um
[2:55:02] they're in first john 4 and 16 it says
[2:55:04] and we have known and believe
[2:55:06] the love that god hath to us
[2:55:10] god is loving he that loveth or dwelleth
[2:55:13] in love dwelleth in god
[2:55:15] and god in him
[2:55:17] herein
[2:55:18] is our love made perfect
[2:55:21] it's a relationship it's something that
[2:55:24] that
[2:55:26] your love can only be made perfect
[2:55:28] through fellowship and what we're seeing
[2:55:31] today
[2:55:32] i i in a minute when we do the vows i i
[2:55:34] have a feeling that you love more today
[2:55:36] than you did the first day
[2:55:38] and and and there's there's there's that
[2:55:40] something way down what is it it's been
[2:55:42] the fellowship over the years
[2:55:44] brother branham talked about the man
[2:55:47] his name was oswald smith
[2:55:50] he says when you're first married
[2:55:52] it's easy to quit
[2:55:53] talking about the pretty girl and
[2:55:55] and that you're married it says when
[2:55:57] you're first married you don't have much
[2:55:59] investment yes she's pretty
[2:56:01] yes it looks like a good thing and
[2:56:05] but if it doesn't work out it'd be easy
[2:56:07] enough to
[2:56:08] to walk away and
[2:56:10] he says after 10 years and then
[2:56:13] it'd be a little harder and
[2:56:15] 20 years it'd be
[2:56:17] and and this man was already 50 years in
[2:56:19] marriage and he says
[2:56:21] i've already been 50 years i can't live
[2:56:23] without her
[2:56:25] and and that's the way i am with my wife
[2:56:27] my wife and i have been married now for
[2:56:29] 33 years
[2:56:31] and i got to say today i would never
[2:56:32] want life without my wife
[2:56:35] and how how beautiful she is and i say
[2:56:37] today i love her more today and she's
[2:56:40] more prettier pretty to me today
[2:56:42] than she's ever been
[2:56:44] amen
[2:56:45] that's right
[2:56:47] and so
[2:56:49] amen
[2:56:51] and and so oswald said and then when the
[2:56:53] children come along and then when you've
[2:56:54] got so many things invested in one
[2:56:56] another it would just absolutely
[2:56:59] be hard
[2:57:01] amen
[2:57:02] brother branham loved this
[2:57:04] this uh this poem this is like that like
[2:57:08] to that above we share our mutual woes
[2:57:11] our mutual burdens bear
[2:57:14] offer each other
[2:57:17] often for each other flows a
[2:57:18] sympathizing tear
[2:57:20] if we asunder part it gives us inward
[2:57:23] pain
[2:57:24] but we shall still be joined in heart
[2:57:26] and no we'll meet
[2:57:27] again
[2:57:29] brother branham in the in the revision
[2:57:32] church age he said also in this ephesian
[2:57:34] age the true church had lost its first
[2:57:37] love
[2:57:38] the love was typified
[2:57:40] as the love of bride and groom at their
[2:57:43] marriage
[2:57:44] and early years of wedded life and then
[2:57:46] there's a cooling of that complete love
[2:57:49] and that abandonment of love
[2:57:52] and he's talking about how the church
[2:57:53] began to cool off
[2:57:55] and sometimes
[2:57:56] and i and there's a reason i'm i'm
[2:57:58] saying this publicly like this because i
[2:58:00] want all of us today in our marriages
[2:58:05] as he's as they're renewing their vows
[2:58:08] let's never let our love cool off to one
[2:58:10] another
[2:58:12] let's let let's always be sweethearts
[2:58:14] and as our brother and sister is
[2:58:16] renewing their vows
[2:58:18] i think that it would be
[2:58:20] a good thing can you say man
[2:58:22] for all of us
[2:58:24] brother bradham says hatred
[2:58:26] had a beginning
[2:58:27] so it must have an end
[2:58:30] love has no beginning
[2:58:32] so it has no end
[2:58:34] hatred is forever
[2:58:36] love is eternal
[2:58:38] hatred begins and hatred will end
[2:58:41] love never did begin
[2:58:44] and it never will end
[2:58:46] it's eternal
[2:58:47] [Music]
[2:58:49] it says and when a man loves a woman and
[2:58:52] marries her because she's just pretty
[2:58:54] there'll be an end to that
[2:58:57] but when a man finds a woman that he
[2:58:59] loves he don't know why but he loves her
[2:59:02] and she finds the man that she loves
[2:59:05] no matter what he looks like
[2:59:07] hey man you're going a little bald but
[2:59:08] it don't matter amen
[2:59:10] [Music]
[2:59:12] i had to point that out
[2:59:15] she probably didn't see it amen
[2:59:19] he loves her
[2:59:21] she loves him
[2:59:23] that's an eternal mate in glory
[2:59:27] death nor nothing else can ever separate
[2:59:30] them
[2:59:31] because they are from eternity they step
[2:59:34] out into space of time
[2:59:37] and will return back to eternity
[2:59:39] eternity has dropped down in a body
[2:59:41] called time
[2:59:42] and then it goes right back into
[2:59:44] eternity again
[2:59:46] it cannot perish
[2:59:48] it's a forever thing
[2:59:50] isn't that a wonderful thing
[2:59:53] and
[2:59:54] as we
[2:59:57] express our i go through these vows here
[3:00:02] 30 years later
[3:00:05] i
[3:00:06] wonder brother jeff if you just repeat
[3:00:08] after me
[3:00:10] i jeff
[3:00:12] take thee ruth
[3:00:15] to be my wedded wife
[3:00:18] to have and to hold
[3:00:21] from this day forward
[3:00:24] for better or for worse
[3:00:28] for richer or poorer
[3:00:31] in sickness and in health
[3:00:34] to love and to
[3:00:36] cherish till god by death
[3:00:41] does separate us
[3:00:44] therefore i pledge my faith
[3:00:48] [Music]
[3:00:51] amen
[3:00:53] i had to throw that in there because at
