========================================

do you all live in your home oh boy well I'm preaching to a perfect group here amen I don't even know why we're having this Father's Day I'm here to tell you there are times when things just ain't peachy at home but Mama's got to have respect for her man and Daddy's got to have a respect for Mama there's an investment that is involved here now you all might not understand it because you're not married yet and you don't but I want to tell you it takes the statistics say and the divorce rates say that not everybody is like your mom and dad the statistics are telling and not statistics the records declare amen that they're willing to give up walk off but Daddy's got an investment in the family 's got an investment in the family and we're not walk it's not easy to walk away can you see man you see life is so much more now so I think Dad invest in in mama and while he's investing in mama he's investing in you amen have you ever heard that you ever heard the phrase happy wife happy life Hallelujah amen Investments Investments investing when he's investing in Mama He's investing in you as children Hallelujah now but fathers are more than that father's amen they equip the sons and the daughters for the struggle of life and there is where the father steps in that he's not he doesn't have the prettiest of words in fact many times he might hum all around trying to come up with the right words it's not the dad a man is is polished the fact is that that is The Rock of jabbar's or whatever that one here's that rock that defends he's that man that is standing there a man that is that is causing a man the the waves to to stop at the door can you say man amen there is no one that can equip a son like a father there is no one Hallelujah there's no one that can get angry and mad and throw temper tantrums like Papa Bear amen there's no one that can amen uh uh especially when his when his son his uh child your child is done wrong and they man he'll pound the fist on the table and they man and declared to the world I will kill them you know and now and and all of that because it's Amen that's that that's that Papa Bear coming out with any but then at the same time after he cools down and he begins to think about things he understands a man that that that you know there you you that life isn't fair and that the boys are going to have to go through life and there's going to be struggles and there's going to be things and they make can you say amen and and he knows that there is training that is taking place to his offspring he knows that this is a situation that they've got to hit man so what does he show him how to what does he show him to do he shows them how to go with the punches he shows them how to amen dodged the punches he shows how to a man to rise and amen in Victorious what can you say amen so after he cries with you a little bit and pounds his fist he just looks back at you up and back up at you and says suck it up buttercup amen we can cry for a little bit but we're going to have to get life back to going amen this ain't gonna kill you let's just get back and get it going we gotta we gotta figure out how we're going to make it investment investment has another meaning it's investment is to endow somebody with a rank or position or class so when a father is is is investing in you is is showing the son or the daughter how to navigate through this life but the Father endows the Son he endows him with himself in other words he's giving him a front row seat he's giving him well praise the Lord he has given him a front row seat to manhood a father is a father's one that gives the the backstage pass or behind the scenes knowledge of the play that is at hand a father is not is not one that is perfect it's not one that makes the perfect decisions it's not one but a father is one that is looking for that way to find the answer he's looking for that way to remedy the situation he's looking to God for well praise the Lord and that boy and that girl that is in the home are watching that man it is a father to show you how it is done well praise the Lord life in this easy in this evil age of Sodom and Gomorrah is not an easy life but there's a father there even with his mistakes even with his UPS his Downs it's a father that is showing you how to remedy the situation Hallelujah willing to say I'm sorry willing to come before the Lord and say I want to I I'm asking God for help willing to say I've blown it but I'm not going to stay in this pick style I'm not going to stay in this mess we're not here to stay we're not building a house in the wilderness we're going on to the promised land it's a Father's Heart that is being exhibited amen when the church trouble is all around and everything is all they men look like it's wanting to fall apart but a father is going to stand there and say Jesus answers Jesus is there and we're going to make it through how are you going to do it Dad I don't know I don't know I'm torn up too but I'm here to tell you just follow my footsteps because I'm trying to follow his footsteps a father is one who blows it blows it blows it big and cries and the family is hurt but he's one that says listen guys hey man I'm a better man than that I'm going to rise to the occasion we're going to make it through a father is warned that when Mama messes up majorly or maybe you as the children rest up majorly amen that steps up with the compassion and say listen we're going to make it through divorce isn't the answer and amen running away isn't the answer we are see it's a fun he does not have all the answers but he's got the instinct to lead he's got the instinct to say we're going to make it through you say brother Wendell this is not really a deep sub this is a very deep subject today you can look at your band and you can scowl at him and you can be bitter because he just doesn't do things the way you want it done your family is still intact you ought to give that man a hand clap statistics says one in four nearly 20 million American children are raised in a home without a father or a father figure compared to the 1960 we're just one out of ten in the same in the same study children without fathers are far more likely to substance abuse violent gun crimes as well as Petty crimes they are far more likely to be abused and neglected at home girls without fathers in the home are seven times more likely to become pregnant teenagers now and I didn't bring all the statistics because I have some other stuff I'm wanting to say I I listen I could go there's some stuff that'll blow your mind and yet Society has tried to take that man and disqualify him minimize him make him listen if you don't have Dad you're going to suffer praise the Lord now I I want to apologize right now to you man because you men were amen and me on Mother's day but these women ain't a man of nothing Hallelujah if you've appreciate your man while I'm bragging on your men say Amen ladies there's a lot more ladies than my wife here say Amen ladies amen we've got to appreciate what God has given us oh now the men are turning red thinking oh man you're doing this this is just making us no man you see the father puts the child leap years ahead in The Game of Life the father who is willing to invest his time a father who loves his wife a father who is willing to go to work a father who is willing to be transparent let the kids see man that he makes mistakes a father well praise the Lord he is Furnishing the boy he is setting the boy up for the future he is empowering the boy to become a man what praise the Lord now I'm using boys and men I'm talking about girls too and and women it's the it's the it's the it's the man that places them in society by showing them how to live in society again it's not a lot of words and it's not how you got to do this and you got to do that either man usually he he ain't the one to do a lot of that kind of I had just a lot of mumbo jumbo to him amen so don't wait for his words just watch his life well Hallelujah Hallelujah now now amen my boy said well we never had that in the dad and hallelujah amen they had a lecture every time they turned around there was a lecture coming amen apple don't fall too far from the tree I remember I remember my grandfather I was I was a teenager and my grandfather still lecturing my dad amen amen a leader a leader is one who loves the leader is one that's not looking out for himself a leader is one that is looking out for the family and wanting that family to succeed he worried about how pretty he looks he ain't worried about amen the money in the bank account there's one thing that he is worried about he has got his family and this family must succeed in this sin driven world [Applause] and because of that leader that father he is setting up the family for success he is placing that boy in a high standing in society now what you all don't understand you teenagers might not understand how that your parents you you you you you might not see it but you are elevated you are elevated far above the other young people in society and you don't even know it because there has been some principles that is laid out there that says I must keep them at all it was all I've done I've got to keep them in this section here to raise them to be princes to raise them to be gods to raise them Hallelujah you were created to be a God not a capital G A minor God you're in the image of God and you ain't letting those kids be a part of society just flopped her all around there and but they're setting you up for a marriage that'll last they're setting you up a man for uh putting you on a in a position to where you know how to run in life you know how to walk you know how to handle yourself praise the Lord Hallelujah amen so when a father has endowed manhood or Womanhood upon the boy or girl what what this is saying is he has provided manhood he has supplied he has furnished What It Takes he has equipped the young man for adulthood so now that doesn't mean that the young man goes out and he knows everything that just simply means that he knows how to fight he knows who he is
