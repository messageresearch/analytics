allegiance to the lamb and um amen so thankful for that appreciate that brother Caleb and um amen how many appreciates the Lord tonight as he has he been good to you this week amen he has truly been good amen let's look here in uh The Book of Revelations the 3D chapter and we're going to read verse one and two um as brother Kobe said we're just so thankful for what uh the Lord is is doing for Dad and and we certainly appreciate the the the prayers the card and um uh those who have went by to see him and and um uh those those things mean a lot to to anyone but you know especially um with that with that Parkinson's it just it those little things just really does a lot uh those little little tidbits that that that really um encourages and so we want to to say thanks uh to all of you for that and and uh as as um as brother Kobe said there's just you know he's uh just doing so well and so so we're we're thankful he still has some fluid on his lungs um and they're trying to get that off um but uh getting him uh to where he can move around a little bit is is going to help that out a lot so we just ask for your continued prayers for Dad how many appreciates Brother Martin we sure do thank the Lord for Dad let's look here at Revelations 3 the first chapter and unto the angel of the Church of Sardis write these things saith he that hath seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and are dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before the Lord or before god let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you for your word and we thank you for everything that it means to us it's our inheritance it's our stay it's Lord Lord you you've given us these things that as we put on the the the church page today keeping our Doctrine simple and and I believe brother brandham always done that just always believe the Bible and Lord if we could do that in every area of Our Lives what a what a Powerhouse the church really truly is that Lord but we we have to believe your word word and we're asking Lord that this would be more than just a reading but we're asking Lord that divine revelation would would infiltrate our souls and Lord let us see Lord the the workings of hell and also the workings of God we love you Lord we thank you for your words help us tonight now in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here tonight now we're going to um we're going to be reading uh starting here at page uh 254 and we're going to go down to the first paragraph so uh how many how many enjoyed the um the the film on um on Sunday night and um you know we uh with with the film uh we could see such what a what a mighty thing uh it was and how that God um raised up a Luther to um to to bring about a Reformation but um and it and it truly was glorious but as we have just read Amen in the in the scriptures that that um they were already even though God done great things amen it says you have a name that you live and are dead Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain that are ready to die and so we're going to see that the that that the Revival and death the cycle of Revival and death has has been throughout all of the churches been down through the church ages God would send a Revival and we're fixing to go in through this here tonight God sent a Martin Luther amen but it didn't take long until they denominated around what what God had done and as soon as they denominate they lose the life of God and and I and and that is and and the cycles of Revival and death happens in our our personal walks too how many how many can say Amen to that that God can send a Revival and if we're not careful we'll denominate around that now we we we don't call it denominate because we're just individuals but we think we've got it all down pat and we lose our sincerity and we're we're we're no longer Walking with God we're thankful for what God has blessed us with and we sort of we sort of lay ourselves or put ourselves in that position to uh and and and God wants to keep right on moving on with us and taking us on in a a a closer walk with us in other words we never come to a standstill we must never in our personal walk come to a standstill Lord let me always continue to grow let your spirit always lead me on Amen so as as we read we we read last week of of um Martin Luther and and what God had done through him and what the age created now let us look now we're going to try to read uh 10 pages tonight so we're going to start at 10:54 or 254 and we're going to try to make it to 264 if we don't make it there then that's fine too but um if we did it would be a perfect stopping point so that the next week we can get into the names and um which I really love I I love that portion of the church age book and uh listen I believe in predestination folks I believe that there are some names that are put on that Lamb's Book of Life that that that'll never come off and then there we're going to find out next week amen that there are some names that are put on the book of life that will come off then there's other names that are on that that that have never been put on The Book of Life and so um it'll be it's it'll be a wonderful teaching and that will probably take a couple of um Wednesday nights on that because he deals a lot with it all right let's let's start in spite of Luther's constant teaching against outside interference in the local church matters he was not able to clear men's minds of the bishop Archbishop concept of church government thus the church took one step in the right direction but re but still remain Shackled so in short order she was again imprisoned in the same dungeon whence she had attempted to escape steal the cup of the Abominable Works was not yet full not only did Luther through poor judgment in sight to battle and thereby caused the death of multitudes but zwingli's party persecuted unto prison The Godly Dr Hub and though it did not commit him to the stake it was actually responsible in great measure for his eventual death death by fire and Calvin did no less for he demanded the arrest of Serv uh cetus who had seen and taught the Oneness of the godhead the state then tried him or tried this brother and to Calvin's dismay he was burnt at the stake if there was ever a time of denominational Zeal it was at this tragic time the words of cinius describe much of this era commus wrote the one thing needful he compares the world to the Labyrinth uh rinth and shows uh that the way out is by leaving what is needless and choosing the one thing needful Christ the great number of teachers he says is the reason the multitudes of sexs um for which we shall soon have no names left each Church reckons itself as the true one or at least as the purest truest part of it while among themselves they persecute each other with the bitterest hatred no reconciliation is to be hoped for between them they meet enmity with ir uh reconcilable enmity out of the Bible they forg their different Creeds these are their fortresses and bull Works behind which they entrench themselves and resist all attacks you realize that what Satan does he does that he's doing this in a as a church against church denomination against denomination but it's the same Spirit that'll work with individuals against one another you know hurt feelings and then Satan will entrench one way or another and and we'll we'll get all of our reasons together and the other side will get all their reasons together and and instead of just letting Christ uh uh uh instead of us being a Brotherhood it's it's it's lobbing at one another instead of just walking in the harmony of of love the beautiful Harmony of love that God gives us amen so so we'll see that here in this area because they were the same they were the same but each were trying to pull their own Direction because there was a great big pull away now you got to remember the anointing of the day brought them out the people were seeing the the the the uh fault of the Roman Catholic Church and they were leaving it in droves and so now here's these teachers looking for ways to to to pull their Direction and and before you know it we had them pulling this way they couldn't agree with Luther on this and they couldn't agree with this one and couldn't agree with that and before you know what we had we we had multiple denominations that were just like the mama and they were persecuting each other just like the Catholic church was them as they were coming out it's it's an incredible thing and they couldn't they couldn't catch uh uh what it is and so u i I just think that it's it's it's it's part of who we are and that's why we should strive every day God fill me with the baptism of the Holy Ghost let your Holy Spirit forever more live in me and through me amen it says now out of the Bible they forged their different Creeds and these are their fortresses and bullworks behind which they entrench themselves and resist all attacks I will not say that these confessions of faith for we can admit in most cases that they are so are bad in themselves they be uh they become so however in that they feed the fire of enmity only by putting them away altogether would it be possible to set uh to set to work on healing the wounds of the church to this Labyrinth of sex and various confessions another belongs the love of disputation what is attained by it has has a single learned Strife ever been settled never their number has only been increased Satan is the greatest sophist he has never been overcome uh in Strife of words in Divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of God each one Chatters as he pleases or kills Time by learning dis uh disquisitions and disproving the views of others of the new birth and how a man must be changed into the likeness of Christ to become partakers of the divine nature second Peter 1 and4 scarcely anything is said of the power of the keys the church has almost lost the power of binding only the power of loosening remains the sacraments given as symbols of unity of love and of our life in Christ have been the made the occasion of the bitterest conflict a a cause of mutual hatred a center of sectarianism in short Christendom has become a labyrinth the faith has been split into a thousand little Parts you are made a heretic if there is one of them you do not accept what can help only the one thing needful return to Christ looking to Christ as the only leader and walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we all reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith Ephesians 4:13 as the Heavenly Master Built everything on the ground of scriptures so should we leave all particularities of our special confessions and be satisfied with the revealed word of God which belongs to us all with the Bible in our hands we should cry I believe what God has revealed in this book I will obediently keep his commands I hope for that which he has promised Christians give ear there's only one life but death comes to us in a thousand forms there's only one Christ but thousands Antichrist so thou knowest oh Christendom what is uh the one thing needful either thou turnest back to Christ or thou goest to destruction like the Antichrist if Thou Art wise and wil live follow the leader of life but you Christians rejoice in your being caught up hear the words of your heavenly leader come unto me answer with one voice even so we come how many can say Amen to that now I just said in that era in this era gave tremendous growth to the denominational Spirit if the Christian attitude or if the Corinth attitude of I am of Paul I of sephus was ever exhibited it was now there were the Lutheran hites the Zang zwing party Etc such fragmentation of the body was deplorable they were living a name but were dead certainly they were dead they they died the minute they organized the great groups organized and tied themselves in matrimony to the state that did it they were finished here were those Lutheran who had criticized the Roman Church they knew the unrighteousness of political and spiritual unions yet Luther as when Peter was overbalanced by the judaizers judees went right ahead and made the state in uh made the state instead of God the defender of Faith this is the first denomination of repute that came out of the Harlot but when Luther died it was not long until it had a hierarchy like the one it had fought this move of God by the time the second generation come along was right under back under the wing of her mother she had uh she had gone back and did not even know it they had taken on their own name name above his name they were living their own name too all the denominations are doing the very same very thing today that they are living their own name and not the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's that is easily seen for every church is known by the way it worships but none are known by the power of God there's your test I want you to notice right there that this era did did not have the signs and wonders amongst them they gave up the power of God for the power of the state they clung to their own name they made their names great it was the old Spirit of getting everyone into its fold today the Baptists want the Methodist to come over to the Baptist the methodists are out to proelite the Presbyterians the Pentecostals want them all each claims to offer the most and to hold out the greatest hopes a sword of Door to Heaven or at least the way of a more abundant entrance how tragic it all is this denominational Spirit has made all the denominations write their manuals teach their Creeds set up their office offices and church governments and then each claims that she and she alone truly speaks for God as she is the best qualified now if that isn't exactly what the pope and the Roman Church are doing they are right back there with their mother the Harlot and don't know it in closing our comments on this verse thou has a name thou livest and are dead I cannot impress upon you too strongly that this age though it brought the reformation and was most sternly rebuked by God instead of being praised because it sold the seed of denomination that was organ that or organized right back to the Harlot after God had opened the door of escape and when the move away from the Catholic Church took place it was not truly spiritual as a whole but more political most of the people took up their protestantism because as I have stated they hated the Roman system of political and financial bondage thus instead of this being a great spiritual move with all the earmarks of the Holy Spirit influence as when God used purely uh as as when God used purely spiritual means to accomplish his ends at Pentecost it was indeed a work wherein the wrath of man praised God and the results paralleled the history of Israel when she left e Egypt and wandered in the desert not making it to the canaan's land however much was accomplished in that where the Yoke of Rome was even partly broken men could now receive the word of God and yield to the influence of the spirit without such great fear as forly this opened the door to the great missionary age that followed the Jezebel of thyra was in no mood to give up her hold upon the people and thus we see her daughter aaliah raise her head in the sardian age at with the hopes that she would be able to strangle the true seed by her schemes of organization you know aren't you glad for a prophet I'm so glad for the for this for a a prophet that could just bring these things out so beautifully and clearly the warning Revelations 3 and 2 Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain for they are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God I wish it could be said that the sergeant Ian Church age in the sardian age was a restoration instead of a Reformation I cannot say that the word does not call it a restoration but certainly calls it a Reformation had it been a restoration the age would have had another Pentecostal age but it was not the best it that can be said of it was strengthen that which remains that is ready to die there was something missing my yes there was certainly there certainly was this age had justification but it had missed sanctification and the baptism with the Holy Ghost that is what God's original plan was that was what they had at Pentecost they were Justified they were Sanctified and were filled with the Holy Ghost why listen to me the reason for being justified and Sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized with the Holy Ghost that is a reason that there is a church it is the temple filled with God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on Earth causing him to do the mighty Works which he did came back upon the church at Pentecost so that they could work The Works he did so that they did The Works he did this age did not have those works all they had the written word but not the revealed word this was the Reformation period but fear not little flock God says I will restore Hallelujah and this reform was going to be the the start of it he was going to according to to his promise take the church back uh from the uh depths of Satan in the dark ages to the depths of God that they had at Pentecost and in the very and the few first few years of the existence of the church now be careful and get this it says in the second verse that I have read for I have not found thy works perfect before God do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it is unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age it was just the starting of getting back that's why I said the Bible called it Reformation not restoration it had started out in the doctrine of justification which meant salvation was all of God oh how Luther preached the sovereignty of God and election he knew it was all Grace he separated the church from the rule of by the ecclesiastical uh hierarchy he tore down the idols he cast out the confessions to the priest he denounced the Pope it was wonderfully good as he started but God has said 1500 years before Luther you're going to start things but your age uh will see it all unfulfilled I'm leaving that to later hallelujah our god reth he knows the end from the beginning yes Luther was his messenger he didn't look like it as we examine the flaws but there was a man called Jonah he had flaws in his too he was a prophet though you and I might not want to say so on the Bas of basis of how he acted but God knows them that are his and he has his way just as he did with Jonah he had his way with Luther in that age and he will have his way until the consummation praise the Lord now this is an unfulfilled this was an unfulfilled age it was an age of reformation but that is how God wanted it I want to illustrate to you the way that I did to a very wonderful Lutheran brother who is a president of a very fine Seminary out west I had been invited to his place to have dinner with him and to speak with him concerning the Holy Spirit he was puzzled about many things and he said to me what have the Lutheran God I said well you have Christ he said we want the Holy Ghost do you think we've got it I said potentially you are believing unto it he said what do you mean potentially we are hungry for God we read a book on Pentecost and the gifts of the Spirit so some of us flew out to California to see the author when we got there he told us that though he had written the book he did not have the gifts now when he when we saw the operations of gifts in your ministry we wanted to talk to you for you must know something about them now this brother Seminary is out in the country and surrounded by many acres of Farmland on which the students can work and thereby pay their way through college he also has factories along the way along with the farm to give added employment so using his fields to illustrate my case I said once there was a man who went forth on his own ground to plant a field of corn he pulled up the stumps and cleared off the rocks and plowed and disced it and and then uh planted his corn each morning he looked across the field but one morning instead of barren ground he saw myriads of little blades coming up and he said praise God for my Field of Corn I then asked did the man have corn he said well in one way he did I said potentially yes and that was you Lutheran in the Reformation putting forth your blade see the corn began to grow after it rotted in the ground during the Dark Ages after several joints were were fine large stocks and one day a tassel of silk appeared then and that tassel of silk looked down at the blades and said you old formal Lutheran haven't anything look at us we're the Breeders the great missionaries our day is the missionary era that and that tassel age was the Wesleyan age and they were the greatest missionaries and even excelled us in our age what did that age do it scattered like pollen in the breeze now what is the next step logically we think that is the actual forming of the harvesting of the grain the completed cycle but not so there is another stage that stage is when the husk or chaff is is formed to cover cover the seed that is exactly what happened in this spiritual cycle at the turn of the 20th century in the start of the lsan age there was widespread belief the Holy Ghost was falling exactly as he did at Pentecost people were talking in tongues claiming the B to be baptized of the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues but I have walked in the grain Fields many times and there in the late summer I have plucked the heads of Wheat and rubbed them in my hand to get some grain when to my surprise there wasn't any corn of wheat in that chaff though indeed it surely looked as if wheat were there this is a perfect picture of the so-called Pentecostal move this and that this is a proven fact is found in uh that these people organized on a Doctrine bound themselves right back as did organization ahead of them proving that instead of being the real seed they were the chaff or the protecting cover for the wheat seed which should come this chaff stage was the danger period when Jesus spoke that Jesus spoke of in Matthew 24:24 deceiving the very elect if it were Possible Oh man felt that this husk this so-called Pentecostal age was the true seed but it proved to be just the carrier uh to carry the life over into the age in which the true restoration comes when the bride when the wheat bride is manifested in the power spoken by Ezekiel 47: 2:5 then he brought me out of the way of the gate northward and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way which lookth Eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right side and the man that had the lion in his hand went forth Eastward and he measured a cubic a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters and the waters were to the ankles and again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees and again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters were to the loins afterwards he measured a thousand and it was a river that I could not pass over for the waters were risen Waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over and the way that it was done was by God's perfect will and programming the Lutheran had the Holy Ghost potentially under justification Methodist had it potentially under sanctification and today it is brought back a restoration the Holy Ghost is here Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die now the ideas expressed in in the two words watchful and strengthen are are these to watch contains not only the idea of being awake but to be alert to be otherwise insinuates danger and loss to strengthen means more than to just give strength it means to fix and establish for permanency these two commands refer to what is left of the truth which itself is ready or about to die these expressions or this expression of the spirit comes before me as an illustration a group of slaves in total bondage physically and morally have risen up and escaped their captors indeed that is what the Sardis means the escaped ones they are pursued and their great and glorious gains are all but lost they have not been retaken but about all that can be said is that they have escaped not clean escaped as some were uh according to the word he says they had lost much of their Liberties now the Lord says you are potentially back in captivity see that you don't go back to keep from going back become alert and remain every watchful concerning the things of your captivity or you will lose all strengthen yourself now in what you have left in such a manner as to permanently establish what you have and thus ensure against future laws this will be your opportunity to fulfill what you have not fulfilled but did they go on no sir they did not heed the voice of the spirit and another age went into cap activ ity and God raised up others who would carry out his will God bypassed the Lutheran denomination as he has all others they will never come back God had to go on and in a new age bring forth F bring further truth and a little more restoration isn't that powerful that that's that's just powerful when you organize and and and and again I again I I think in Reading in in Reading uh uh the church age book we we need to always I I think we can take everything that we have read from this church age book and apply it to our personal lives and I think it's so important that we do because they were living in a day where they had natural choices for themselves to make and they were going to govern their actions their beliefs their lives according to the way that they to to the doctrine that they set up in their in in in their minds and when they accepted um Church anity which is what they done over the spirit of the Lord leading them further into greater truth leading them further into a greater walk with God they were satisfied with with their w w with their little drawn up Creeds that they that they felt comfortable with Y y'all understand what I'm saying and can that happen in the message well I'm I'm I'm I'm here to tell you it has happened see now the message itself is not a denomination but there are still those who have built by taking uh teachers taking what they want out of it and building their Creeds and almost every one of them well all of them that you that you see that have had that that teachers that have taken and and and and built a denomination around their deal it ends up it ends up it ends up full of strife it ends up full of death is that right I I've been around the message a long time now and every one of those guys that have ever done it amen it ends up they start out going so good and then ends up the whole thing all falling apart amen and especially after the founder dies and when the you know when when the when whether it be Joseph Coleman or levale or maybe I shouldn't be mentioning names but but you see those those groups that followed them and it's hard for them to come back it's hard for them to come back and accept what what what brother brandham had taught because they had their own interpretation of what brother brandham had taught instead of just believing the prophet that God gave us and so that's the reason why our hearts should always be God let me let me have open-minded let my heart be wide open to the message of the hour let your word have its perfect effect in my life I don't want to be one of those that's just along the Wayside God's called me no this message will not denominate that's right it will not denominate there's going to be a brad that's going to walk with her Lord she's going to walk in humility she's going to have a peace with God and is going to be the all the virtues of God flowing through her the powers of God are going to be living in her we're not going to be looking to this great one or that great one we have went through all of those ages we are now following the Holy Spirit right on into the Rapture glory to God Amen I'm so glad for that today so so now remember as as we as we looked here now this is all in that man age and so we go all the way up to when God sends us the prophet you you go go from all of these denominational cycles that are going through but remember as soon as you build your Creed and set your doctrines amen you you you're effectively dying you're killing your experience because God cannot be put in a box he's just not going to be put in a box amen all right so um so we're going to uh okay so now we're down here at at the um the first paragraph of 261 judgment Revelations 3:3 remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I come upon thee I want to read another translation uh uh whis of of this verse be remembering therefore in the way in what way you have received the truth as a permanent deposit and what way you heard it and be safeguarding it and have a change of mind at once it is very evidence from this verse that God had given them truth as a permanent deposit it was received and ir and is irrevocably theirs now now remains to be seen what they will do with it whether they will regard it or not that is true they had been given the basic truth of the whole gospel the just shall live by faith salvation is of the Lord they had heard the truth of the Bible which cast down the doctrines of Rome and said it not all papal Authority they knew the truth that the church does not save they understood the Lord's Supper they had light on water baptism they put out the images truth why they there never was an age with any more men with so much light to shed they had enough illumination to completely overhaul the old system and start out fresh and let God lead them line upon line precept upon precept they received the truth they wanted it and heard it but the question was how did they hear it did they hear it to build upon or was it with the same attitude that many Greeks had something to discuss and theorize over evidently the rich word of Truth was being heard in an academic manner rather than for the Practical outworking for God was demanding a change of mind concerning it if this is the word of God which indeed it is then it must be obeyed failure to obey would bring judgment when the guards of the Sacred Temple were found sleeping they were beaten and their garments burned what shall the Lord do with those who in this age have relaxed their guard I will come on thee as a thief ancient Sardis was constantly harassed by Bandits that swooped down from the hills and pillaged the people thus they only knew too well what the spirit was saying in that the coming of the Lord is as a thief vigilance and preparation alone will suffice to be ready for his coming now we know that this is a message for the false Vine for the coming of the Lord will be as it was in the days of Noah the eight saved were well aware of the impending flood and became a and being aware were prepared and saved but the world of the ungodly was swept away though they daily were in contact with the righteous and heard the truth they turned it aside until it was too late those completely carnal people in that ancient period type out today the nominal Christians whose lives are full of Earthly things they take pleasure in them to such an extent that they have no desire for the spiritual and are not at all aware of nor ready for his appearing the theology the eulogy that's what it isans Revelations 3:4 thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy you know when when you read that after hearing this other and then to say that God's got a predestinated group doesn't that just make your heart just Rejoice because you can see it in this day that we're living in that there are still those of us that are saying I want my garments white guys this ain't this this this this this is this is not common folks this is not common you to have that desire to be right with God is don't take that lightly how we should say thank you Jesus you know it goes back it goes back to what brother brandom had had had made a comment and I I I've quoted over the years because it was such a unique comment he says the blood does not save you you are saved by predestination the blood simply keeps you clean okay in other words if your name was not put there on that Lamb's Book of Life in the first place and the genetics of God were not placed in your heart the world has the blood of God at their disposal they have the word of God at their disposal they have the message of the hour it's all over the internet but only the elect have that something in their heart that they must be right with god oh how we should thank the Lord for that it says of course as we're um we're at the uh first paragraph of 263 of course the word names mean people as it says in Acts 1:5 concerning those in the upper room the number of names together were about 120 but to me it goes far beyond just signifying people it brings out the truth that is set forth in every age which was spoken to us by our Lord with great emphasis it is this the church system of these ages is made up of two Vines true and false god in his own Sovereign purpose has put them all together calling them the church see in this age how he has rebuked them saying unto the church which is not churches are ins Sardis but lumping them together the church which is I Know Thy works you are dead your works are unfulfilled and then he goes on thou this church in Sol has a few people in you that are right and not wrong like the majority these walk in clean garments they are worthy of me now these people that were the true saints of God were walking all pleasing unto the Lord their garments were clean you see in those days the garments would sweep along on the road and pick up dirt and defilement and they these were watching how they walked so that they were not corrupted by the world they were in the spirit and walking in the spirit they were holy and Without Blame before him thus they were fulfilling their purpose for that is what Ephesians 1 and4 says is the purpose of God for us that we should be holy and Without Blame before him now from this verse which shows the elect to be a few names you can clear you can see clearly what we have been teaching about this age it was chaotic it was unfulfilled it was split scores of ways and God rebuked it almost in its entirety it was weak and sickly and ready to die it was not the Glorious era of the carnal-minded Protestants that the carnal-minded Protestant historians have tried to make it one quick look at that tree saw it was cankered and blighted denuded of leaf and Barren of fruit except for some deformed and warmy fruit that was fast dropping to the ground but hold a minute look closer there at the top in the light of the sun were some first fruits a few names perfect in him for they were born of him filled with him walking with him by his word someone shout hallelujah thank God for those few they shall walk with me that is what God says he will bestow upon them that U that walk upright bestow upon them for this upright walk this that is part of their inheritance that he reserves for them if they were willing to walk with him through the toils and snares of life and be honored to him he was going to reward them he is not forgetful of our labor of love God will recompense us for our efforts to please him yes they had walked through the world and had not partaken of it they had not let the world's systems overcome them when the El estrous names of the age had yielded to the banishment of state and chosen political mindedness rather than spiritual mindedness and were on their way back into the world these few stood for the word of God and thereby honored the Lord now he would honor them in return for they shall walk with him in white they had identified themselves with him on earth now he would identify himself with them in the New Jerusalem how marvelous will be that identification it makes me rejoice and yet makes me weep to think of his condens for you will knowe that he is not dressed in another in another color different from the Saints as Earthly leaders would do so do no they are like him he is like them they are like him even as John said they shall see him as he is for they are worthy do you realize who was saying this it is Jesus the worthy one himself that is the only one this is the only one who is accounted worthy to take the book out of the hand of him who sits on the throne and now this worthy one is saying to his Saints you are worthy here is this one the only one qualified to judge and indeed all judgment is committed unto him and he says you are worthy these words are as astounding as as are the words in Romans 833b God says I am righteous the way translation there in the white light of God's righteousness hear the sweet voice of Jesus as he says these are mine they are righteous they are worthy they shall walk with me in white you know I when I was reading that I just I I wanted to cry how is it that God can and you know we look at ourselves and we see such imperfections we see we see we know us we know our mind battles we know the things that that we Face we know we we we know we we we know the Frailty of who we are but he when he looks he's looking upon a heart that loves him and if you notice all through the church ages he's always pointing out every one of those ages you're mine your mind I and he and he sent those Messengers to make sure that the elect knew who they were I think it's beautiful I I think when I when I look at this when when I look at and and here we are today Satan fights so hard especially in this age of mental illness Satan wants to take that because he's not he's he's not just hitting those guys outside outside the bride and and with mental illness and and trying but he's working on your mind too and the only thing that keeps you sane is the power of the holy spirit in your life but just because you've got the Holy Ghost doesn't mean that Satan's not just constantly just hitting you hard you're not worthy you're not loved you're not appreciated you're not and it and and and and I tell you what I I would if we we took a poll tonight and and if we were all honest there would probably be 95 to 100% of us all all raise our hands feeling like we we we we we are unworthy or we're unloved or we're Satan fights those things or or fights us with those things in our mind but I I I I look at this at these Church ages and I look at the opening of the seals and I I see I I see how God has come and just remove the the remove the curtain so that you could see it and to me it gives you that peace it gives when Satan's fighting you so hard it's like God Is providing the bride that antidote to that spirit that wants to to make every one of you go insane and he's opening it up and he's saying I have been there through every one of these ages and I have kept them and I want you to take this Revelation this revelation of of what I think about you this Revelation don't look at your your inabilities don't look at your uh your peculiarities don't look at at at at any of those things keep your eyes upon me I will lead you through to this Rapture it's a promise he can't lie he's never lost one and he ain't going to lose you never lost one and he's not going to lose well that should just make us all just Rejoice Hallelujah he loves his own and again this is not a learning this is the holy spirit this is the great Shepherd and saying your mind Satan stay away from him can you say Amen yes amen so so um now we're going to stop right there and then in this next in this next week we're going to start um um on this other U that I've I've always loved this portion of the church age book over the years and so I I hope that you'll enjoy it as well um did you enjoy the reading tonight amen now is there is there anyone that has anything that want to they want to offer I mean we uh we got a little bit of time here um any anything that you all want to add to the uh the reading tonight or or or a question I wonder um uh I'm always I'm always want to make sure you kids are all are all up to date on stuff too uh but have you have you young people been catching the gist of what of what the church ages are about are y'all appreciating them sort of yeah sum are yeah I understand I understand I was you know uh the um the beautiful thing is is is we're now we went through the Dark Ages and as brother brandom has just put it out there and he's and and we're and again it's going to really get into it in that much the more um how that to me it's it's it's it's going to get it's going to get glorious because as as he said about the Lutheran Church that God planned it that way God planned that it was going to only go so far and then would fall back and then it would go so far and it would fall back and and he he begins he begins to talk about how that he he he had to raise this one up and had to raise that next group up and had to make in order to come to your age of rapture he had that's that that's been his whole design his whole design was to come to the restoration age that we're living in now and we're blessed to be in that age where the restoration is coming where the bride's coming and what's going to bring on the Rapture the the the Rapture is not a set time the Rapture is the elect understanding what God has been doing and building that faith in our hearts and we'll get to that point to where we will not be we'll be walking with God and and and and we'll be gone and I believe that's what God is doing he's want not not denominating around him uh William brandom no way brother Brandon was just a vessel that God used to bring the message but brother and and and but the life is in the message brother brandom's in the grave and he's waiting to come out of the Grave can you say Amen oh bless the Lord what a glorious gospel what a what a glorious God Amen so any anyone have a h have something to say Amen you want to add to to what we've uh what we've said or you got a question amen Len that influences 1964 and uh go along with that they are worthy and that he talked he read the scripture where the where the angel or the seraphim or cherubim with the uh tongs uh took a coal from off the altar yeah and touched Isaiah's lips yeah and said your iniquity is taken away isn't that beautiful and that just hit me so strong when you read yeah that about these and Sardis are worthy yes that is so true took the Coes from off the Altar and touched his lips thine iniquity you know and and um uh it we won't be in this next one but it'll be I believe it's in this Sardis age where brother Brandon will talk about that's I think it's the exact I think it's in this one where we've got to be sufficiently impressed with the word in our age because that word is the Revelation the Revelation is is what is is transforming this bride we are not just part of the Shu we are the restoration of the word seed Hallelujah I I I heard someone say and I agree that true justification could not happen under Luther because true justification he still had so much of all of the brought so much of Mama's ways true justification could only come through the restoration of the word and we are receiving the bride will not be manhandled at all the bride will not have a portion of word plus wendle Martin's opinion a portion of the word plus Merl igate's opinion we have got the word and the word alone and that's what is bringing about this Rapture through uh uh through that word is that isn't that beautiful true justification because we we're not we're not listening to Mama's ideas Daddy's ideas or what this one thinks or what that one thinks we're just staying right there with the Vindicated word of the hour this is the purest form since Pentecost I say I say even the more pure amen because it was not because they didn't know even even the Apostle Paul didn't even know that it was going to go down through the Dark Ages th those those early Saints didn't know they were looking for the coming of the Lord to be happening in their day but here we are amen looking and we see the full scope of things and how God has how how God has brought it out and to me it it produces a faith greater than anything else I I just I just tell you amen we should expect miracles we should expect the supernatural we should expect because the supernatural God Is With Us amen I'm expecting I'm I'm expecting the the the the areas where we're needing miracles in our church I'm expecting it I don't know when or how but I'm expecting it to come I'm expecting joints to be to to to to grow I'm expecting eyeballs I'm just expecting anytime to hear those kinds of things because we're living in the with a supernatural God this is Rapture age that's right that means that means the groom and the and the bride amen are hand in hand that right amen oh believe it keep that keep that Doctrine simple believe believe with everything that is within you oh that old devil that wants to tell you well just I rebuke that devil every time I I pray I I'm serious every time I pray is God take that hard heart of unbelief from me I want no unbelief in my heart I want a pure heart to believe every word amen anyone else have something to say as the musicians come praise the Lord Mitch brother Mitch I remember when I first read that a part there greatest yeah's a lot of yeah and if you'll notice he has never he has never lost with a debate never it's what the prophet said there in that book so he he's old always got a way of being able to outwit out out talk and and yeah you're right yeah that's right yeah y the Lord rebuke you as you go along more yeah yeah yeah yeah amen but the lamb has taken the book and he is worthy amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord you know I love him I love him with all of my heart I I I I just want to and I want to love you more and it's a constant washing but I'm glad Christ doesn't have to die millions of times but it's a constant washing it's us taking God's word letting the Holy Spirit convict our hearts and choosing not to push him aside like the Lutheran and like this one and like the Pentecostal remember whenever you push the conviction aside then then the holy SP Spirit stops walking with you so lord always give me that heart of conviction always don't ever don't ever quit don't don't don't ever stop convicting my heart and Lord Jesus forgive [Music] me for allowing my ears to to just grow deaf to your word grow deaf to your Holy Spirit nudging me you're wrong or you need to get right the question is not is not it's not whether there's not blood for any of us or forgiveness for any of us cuz there is he's there's forgiveness for everyone of us the elect is the reason the blood was shed and the blood will never lose its power but we get hardened hearts in this old evil world and it's so easy just to ignore the Holy Spirit that's right I don't want to get there I don't I don't want to stand before the Lord on that day and the Lord say you made it but you you didn't you didn't wash your garments you didn't you didn't bring me much on with your attitudes with your this with that I I want him I want him to say hey come sit on the throne with me I gave you my blood I gave you my word and you were diligent to overcome I want that again the devil wants to work on us all and say yeah that'll will never happen but I believe it will happen because there's something in my heart that is screaming out I must overcome amen do y'all have that is that is that something in y'all's Hearts the job I want to overcome do you think you think the devil's children has that desire no I just don't think that but he wants to give us pleasures and things and just keep our mind occupied preoccupied to where we don't see our [Music] purpose and I'm just feeling the presence of the Lord in this hour that is saying hey hey I'm here I love you follow me I'm so glad for that in
