It gives us a a real there's a divine essence that has that has come to us in this generation. And man, it it it creates a it produces something that religion cannot produce. And listening to the young people sing here this morning, it it produces young people that has an experience with God. Seeing you elders here, it's it's produced something within you. And that's that gives us a a great hope in this generation where where it's just a godless generation. But to see the Holy Spirit here living his word through his people, it's it's a wonderful thing, isn't it? &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for that rest. Amen. It's good to good to see everyone here this morning. And um we um uh we've got a real special treat here this morning. We've we've got Sister Mary with us. This this is Sister Leah's mom. And uh and so uh I know I know she must be really proud of Sister Leah's family and and uh all of her all of course brother Merl's family too. I mean, I guess he had something to do with this, but uh but uh her her three granddaughters here uh married to preachers and and u serving the Lord that this this was all her grandchildren singing this morning in the specials and so uh oh great grandchildren. Boy, you're old. No, no. Amen. Uh but we're just really delighted to have Sister Mary with us this morning and always look forward uh every time she gets to come to Oklahoma and u and so we just say God bless her and brother and sister Gadman. We just always love having them with us [Music] and uh I I hope they don't get a complex coming this way. you know, I mean, there are friends and he struggled so much this last year with in his body and and uh they come back through Oklahoma and and she was she was in the emergency room most the day yesterday with a with a kidney stone and oh, I heard she suffered just really sick, but she's here today. And so, we just say God bless you. Amen. And uh so if you have your Bibles, why don't we turn to the book of Philippians, the 2 chapter, and that way you can have your seats. Um we if I've overlooked anybody, we we just say God bless every one of you. Appreciate you musicians. And um u brother Joe's got a friend there. God bless you, sis. Good, good to have you this morning. Amen. There in Philippians the 2 chapter and the first verse it says if there be therefore any consolation in Christ any comfort of love any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels of mer and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord and of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in loneliness of mind. Let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men, being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and become obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we want to thank you today for your blessings and and the opportunity to come together with our with with the redeemed of the Lord and and we just ask Lord that you would bless everyone that is that has been faithful to come and bless our visitors, Lord. And God, we we ask that your presence would be here and and that it would be felt among us all. And I pray Lord that you would direct our thoughts and let us speak only as the oracles of God that have been revealed in in our day today. And ask Lord that your word would take on flesh among us. And Father, if there be any sick among us, we ask that you would heal them. Lord, we're missing a few here this morning. And we ask Lord that you would be with those Lord. Be with all of the sick ones. And Father, we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated here this morning. I want to take this this thought. Thought it not robbery to be equal with God. They were let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus the man the the man God man who being in the form of God. Brother Brandham talks about God changing forms &gt;&gt; and that he thought it not robbery and that word robbery might not be there's two meanings that that are in that Greek word and um one is in the illegal sense of robbing somebody but then there was another one which pertains to this one that word thought it not robbery to be equal with God. thought it uh not a treasure to be clutched and retained at all hazards to be equal with God. So though Christ was in the form of God, the logos of God, Amen. He was the visible expression, the the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. That would reveal himself to the prophets, that would reveal himself to Moses in the burning bush. Amen. But he in this form, Amen. Though he was in the form of God, thought it not a treasure to be clutched or retained, Amen. at all hazards to be equal with God. But he was willing to take on the form of a man. He was Amen. to come and to reveal himself because God is always revealing himself. Every time God and he's revealed himself in many ways, the prophet would tell us that God hides himself always hides himself behind a veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was the great pillar of fire. He was the tree of life in the garden. He He was the whirlwind that appeared to Job and spoke. He was the the rock that followed the children of Israel in the wilderness. He was the Amen. the the mana. Amen. the bread of life that fell from heaven. So God reveals himself in many forms and he's God. He can reveal himself in in however way he wants to reveal himself. But God has always had a desire to to reveal himself to humanity as a human. Amen. And that was exactly what God was doing. Amen. men tends to look at the form that God is revealed in and and then um they they they worship the form and they don't find God. You you can see that in Amen. as they they worship the creation and never find God. They you know they they the natives worship the sun. You've got India worshiping uh the many different animals. You've got uh um you know many you know worship the totem post. Some Amen. There's there's some that that worship the planets. We've got we've got uh many Catholics worshiping Mary. There's there's always Amen. It because men are to are uh men and women were created to be worshippers. God wants to be worshiped. But identifying where God is is so important because God is not necessarily in the form. God is in his word that is being expressed through the form. &gt;&gt; Amen. God. You see, that's where the ch the the the people could not understand when when Jesus come to earth, they could not understand God being expressed in the form of a man. &gt;&gt; And they they say you make yourself God. Amen. You we we we don't know anything about you. You have a devil. you've got. But yet he was the very expression of deity. He was the very expression of the logos. He was the manifestation. He was God in in a human form. Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now that first theophonic uh form of God or the theophonic body of God was the logos, that pillar of fire. It was the Christ, the living word, that that that God had had all of those thoughts and all of those attributes in the back of his mind. He he he he had those eternal thoughts and you were there in those thoughts. You were there with God. You listen, you're not you're not an afterthought of God. You're the original thought of God. &gt;&gt; You're not a wannabe God. You are the very expression of the thoughts of God. So, so when God thought these things, God was forever that invisible God with Amen. that that that spans from uh uh eons and eons of time. But you see, or before time, but when God spoke there, out of God comes this great logos, that great pillar of fire. And that filler of fire was sitting there hovering and God emptied himself. All of his thoughts, all the deity of God comes in the expression of that pillar of fire. Now God would forever more, Amen. be synonymous with that pillar of fire. God lived in that pillar of fire. That pillar of fire held every thought. That pillar of fire had every attribute of God within it. Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; That would now be the physical expression of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh, I I just love it when I think about it. But you see, God's goal, Eman, was to come in the form of a man. And he promised, I will raise up uh from the woman's seed a serpent bruiser, a a a a people who would be deceptionp proof. And Amen. And we understand that that could only happen if the pillar of fire would come in the form of a human uh uh human being in order to take the sins of the human race and to redeem them back to God. And we can see it all throughout the scripture. We don't want to go it go into great detail, but you can see, Amen. God appeared when God appeared to Abraham as Melkisedc. He appeared in the theophony. Amen. A form of a man. He appeared to Abraham as a man. &gt;&gt; He had dust on his clothes. &gt;&gt; Amen. He ate bread and he and and and he ate meat and he drunk milk. Well, praise the name of the Lord. The prophet of God says, you see, when God came down, he called he called a couple of the angels and he says, "Come on down. We're going to we've got to go down and visit earth." And what did he do? He he picked up a piece of dust and blew into it and said, "Gabriel, step into that one." Amen. Told him to step into that one. And then he created another one. And God himself stepped into that body. And when Abraham seen this coming, these three men coming, Amen. What did he say? My Lord, &gt;&gt; he saw. Amen. God, oh, glory to God. I think we need to see God in his form today because God's got a form on the earth. God always veils himself. God is going to be revealed. A but he hides himself from him h from the world and and reveals himself to the elect. When God Amen. When Moses wanted to see God, he says, "God, if I could see you," and God says, "No man can see my face and live." Amen. But he put his hands over over the eyes of of Moses and he walked past him. And the Bible says when he saw the glory of God, he saw God as a man. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Well, praise the Lord. When the king of Babylon, he's looking down as he threw Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the in the flames of the fire. And when he looked down there, he says, "Did you how many people did we throw in there?" Amen. We threw three. But I see the son of God like as unto a man. &gt;&gt; So God in all of these theophonic forms, God was declaring his desire to be a man. &gt;&gt; Did you know that God still veils himself today? And many people miss they miss the expression of God because they have got something in their mind and they don't truly understand. Ezekiel, Amen. When Ezekiel looked at God and the vision and he saw the cherubams and he and he saw the four living amen creatures and the Bible says he saw a throne and he saw a man sitting up on the throne. So when we say that Jesus of the New Testament is the expression of God of the Old Testament, are you hearing me? It's God revealing himself in the form &gt;&gt; of a man. When God would manifest and God would declare himself to earth, &gt;&gt; God has a voice. How many believes God has a voice? &gt;&gt; Because Moses heard his voice lipped to ear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God can write &gt;&gt; because he wrote the Ten Commandments. &gt;&gt; He wrote the Ten Commandments. But when God wanted to reveal himself to earth, he would always use a man. &gt;&gt; God would raise up prophets that would come in in in in their specific generations. Any time you ever seen a prophet come to earth, Amen. If there was a prophet on the earth, you had better perk up your ears because God's fixing to talk. God's fixing to say something. God's got something that he's wanting to declare to his people. Well, glory to God. Amen. I know Pentecost has made a has made, you know, a mess of things and all their guessings and all of their prophecies and all of their and I just want to tell you, amen, 99.9% of it is just all a bunch of nonsense. It's a it's a bunch of hogwash. I'm not saying that God, amen, doesn't use prophecies and God doesn't speak in his body, amen, through the gifts. I I I I'm not I the word says he does. But I want to tell you, when a word prophet steps upon the earth, God's got something to say. And we ought to say, "Lord, let me hear. Don't let me just here a little bit here and a little bit there. But let me catch what you are saying because there is a farm that God has placed on the earth to speak through. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So when he talks to humanity, he would raise up a prophet. Oh, glory to God. what it must have been like if I if if you were if you would have been there I in in in Egypt as slaves &gt;&gt; and to have Moses coming and speaking in the first uh the first person &gt;&gt; hallelujah and the children of Israel hearing the prophet step up and say amen uh uh uh Pharaoh let my people go and he's standing standing there in the amen in the place of God or he's standing there anointed by God. Amen. Why? Because he was the form the pillar of fire that had met him in in the burning bush is now within him speaking declaring the words of life. And the authority of God is with him. The anointing of God is with him to deliver God's people. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, God God is has always in a form. And I I I I think of as a play as the prophet would would would explain, Amen. that that morphe and and and how that God would would reveal himself and the different forms and and and he would brother Brandon would say there amen there would be many characteristics that would be played by by the one individual as as in a play. Amen. And and sometimes you've got one person he's the villain one time and then he's the he's this and he's that. Amen. different forms, but there's only that one person that is playing it. &gt;&gt; Well, aren't you glad for that? Aren't you glad that God can just reveal himself however he wants to do it? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and they would and they that one person he was using Romeo and Juliet and Amen. and how they you know this one played this in in his daughter's play and how that Amen. There was one person that played two or three different roles. Amen. And they were dressed different. Amen. They had different rows. They they Amen. different characters, but it was all the same one that was being that was expressing itself. Amen. Well, can you say amen? I just want to let you know God is big and God can be what he wants to be. Amen. And it's God's character. Now, the form in itself is is not what God wants us to look at. God's wanting us to look at the essence. Amen. Of his character behind that form. &gt;&gt; You see many times, Amen. preachers get it mixed up and and different ones get it mixed up. If the anointing of God is upon them, then they begin to think something great of themselves. Amen. The the form is not what God is. Amen. That the form without God is nothing. &gt;&gt; But it's the essence of the character. Jesus was not just another man. It was the essence of the character of God that was within him that was declaring something is different &gt;&gt; about that man. &gt;&gt; Now within his character is father son within the character of God is redeemer, &gt;&gt; savior, healer. within that character of God. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God revealed himself uh uh to to to Israel as Jehovah. Then he further reveals himself Jehovah Gyra. And then he further reveals himself as Jehovah Shalom. And then he further reveals, Amen. Brother Brandham would say it's the same God just revealing himself in a deeper expression of furtherance of his character. It was God reveal well praise the Lord. So to Abraham he was the provider. He was the one that took that lamb. Amen. And and created a lamb because he was in need of a lamb. Amen. But to the others, he revealed himself as Jehovah Shalom because God was wanting to express himself as a peacegiver, as a healer. Am I going too slow? I want you to understand that these forms that God comes in is a furtherance of his expression. Right. &gt;&gt; Now the word form comes from that word morphe and it simply is the form or the shape or the appearance that expresses the essential nature of something. Amen. It's the way of things strikes the eye. Brother Brandham would put it this way this way here in the unveiling of God. He says the Greek word means something that could not be seen yet it's there and then it's changed and the eye can catch it. So the invisible God wanting to express himself in a certain way. Amen. Then it's and then it declares itself. And he uses the illustration. He said like Elijah at at Dothan the servant couldn't see all those angels around there. God just changed. Amen. Not brought the angels down. He changed the seeing of that servant. And there was the mountains full of angels and fire and horses of fire and chariots of fire all around his prophet. He changed the seeing. The thing was already there. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God is Hallelujah. God's always been here. God was here. Amen. before the prophet came. But the prophet came to express. Somebody say express. He was a form in which God would come in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was the fulfillment of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; He was the fulfillment of Revelations 10. He was the full quit. Can you say amen? But you see, he's only partial fulfillment because the other part of it, I send unto you, Elijah the prophet, and he will turn you back to the fathers, back to the Bible, back to the manifestation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Oh, I I I think it's so beautiful because God is always wanting to be known by to his elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, thus the Greek word for form, Amen, is the outward expression which a person gives of his inmost nature. Now, I want you to think about that because the character played will be the expression of the perfect perfect essence. The character played is not something posed from something without someone making themsself the form of God. But when God comes in and expresses himself through a form, it is God &gt;&gt; because his his his his actions, his words, his deeds, everything is coming from that inner expression that God is giving from within him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, when you say that you're a Christian, when you say that you're a son and daughter of God, &gt;&gt; you know what that that's why the Apostle Paul, Amen, tells there in in Corinthians, "Know ye not that you are the temple of the living God? Know ye not that God's got another form?" They they Amen. They're trying to say, "Oh, we got to have something to pray to. We got to pray to Mary. We got to pray to Venus. We got to pray to this." Amen. In in that pagan Rome, but it was the Apostle Paul that stood up, amen, even on Mars Hill and said, "You're way too superstitious. You're serving all of these gods. You're praying to all of these gods. And you've even got this one, Amen, sign up here, amen, uh, to the unknown God." He says, "Don't you know that God is in another form? He's in another form. God, that invisible God is living in humanity. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? forms, actors, God living himself through when a movie is being uh made about a I don't know a hero that that actor that is going to play um I don't know I I I don't I don't watch I don't watch that uh TVs and stuff but I I seen one that that was I watched a little something that came on my phone about I guess they must have made something of of u of President Reagan &gt;&gt; and um and and and the actor they were interviewing and he was saying I I I had to delve in to his per I my personality had to become his personality. Amen. And he said, "I learned his laugh and I learned the way he looked and I I I I I got into his jokes and I I looked at his policies." So everything So when that man was playing a the character of Ronald Reagan, what you saw was the expression of a man who is already dead. &gt;&gt; But you can see the expression. I'm getting somewhere. I got to build my case to you here this morning. When you sip at and you looked at that player, and I don't know his name, wouldn't know him from anybody. Amen. But when you looked at that man, you did not see his personality. You did not see what his ability is. You saw that of Ronald Reagan. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when God takes you, you are just an actor. Amen. You are just the the form. I'm not not talking about a Pharisee actor. Amen. I'm talking about you are the form that is going to express that invisible God. He's not someone that died. He's living his life through his church. The works that I do shall you do and even greater because there will be more of you. &gt;&gt; I am going to live in you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You see? Amen. Until that actor becomes one in spirit and action with the hero. So the shape someone shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The shape of the physical object is not the point at hand. &gt;&gt; They rejected Jesus because they didn't like the form in which God came in. Oo, we got to be careful &gt;&gt; because we want to put God in a certain form. And I want to tell you about the time you've got God all boxed in right here, you're going to find he's in another form over here. &gt;&gt; We're going to find out. But it's always consistent with the logos. For the logos, the living word, is the one that is taking on form, different forms, many forms. Well, can you say amen? Let me just put it this way here today. He is living in a mother form. He is living in a father form. He is living well. Come on, church. Amen. It is God's expressions. &gt;&gt; He's living in the five-fold ministry form. He's living every form. It's got to go back and look at the essential character behind that form. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you just love him? &gt;&gt; Jesus is now the word living in a body. So when you looked at Christ, Amen. Again this expression of being that carries in itself the distinct nature and character of that great logos to whom the expression pertains and thus it permanently identified himself with that nature that character. It was the mold or the way or the manner in which the essential being of God expresses itself. If we don't if we fail to miss this then if we fail to if we fail to see this my friends there's no peace unless you can identify yourself as the body the form &gt;&gt; which God is living in &gt;&gt; there is nothing there you you you see what I'm saying because Jesus was 100% man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And 100% God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet taught us. That's what the Bible taught us. He was all man and yet all God. &gt;&gt; Some people look at at Jesus and say, "Well, why did he why did he have to pray?" Amen. They've got It's the second It's the second uh person of the Godhead praying to the first person of the Godhead. &gt;&gt; Well, if the second person of the Godhead has to pray to the first person of the Godhead, I'd say let's do away with the second person of the Godhead. &gt;&gt; I want I just want to go straight to the top. Hallelujah. Let's go straight to the top. But you see, it wasn't the second person of the Godhead. It was the humanity. It was the vessel. It was the body in which the first person, the only person, the ultimate God lived in. &gt;&gt; And the man Jesus had to pray for the father that dwelt in him to have his will in him. &gt;&gt; And he had to pray often. Jesus had to pray often. The Bible says Jesus often, Amen, uh uh uh stole away to himself early of the mornings and would spend time in prayer. Why? Because he's a man. He says, "I do nothing except the father first show me." What was he doing? He wanted the will of God in his life. I think that should be an example for every one of us. I want the will of God in my life. If God says his spirit is in me and I have become the expression of God on the earth, then God let me be the perfect expression. Let my will be surrendered to your will. Jesus had a will that was contrary to God's will. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Nevertheless, not my will &gt;&gt; but thy will." &gt;&gt; He didn't want to go to Calvary. &gt;&gt; He was a man. But he was an expression. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That form wasn't expected. Have you thought about it? Jesus appeared in the most holy city, Jerusalem, among God's most holy chosen people, the Jews. Hallelujah. He come to those who worshiped him. And John 1:14 says, "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory." &gt;&gt; And and and yet the Bible says there in John 1:10, he was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. &gt;&gt; He came to his own, and his own received him not. Now, God had already been building when he appeared. When he when he appeared to Abraham, form of a man. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? When he appeared, Amen. to Moses, the form of a man. When he appeared in the fiery furnace, the form of a man. When they saw the vision of of one sitting on the throne, it was in the form of a man. And when the man Christ Jesus came, &gt;&gt; Yeah. They rejected him &gt;&gt; because they did not like his form &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Did you know that God that that that God is always progressive? &gt;&gt; That God Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now man man man likes when Jesus came they said we we follow the God of Moses. Moses is our prophet. &gt;&gt; And he said, "If you believed Moses, &gt;&gt; you would understand who I am. &gt;&gt; For Moses declared who I all of the Old Testament oracles, all of that in in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. All of that was pointing to a future expression. It was pointing to a future. But you see, you are back in that other form. And here I am in the expression that I have promised to reveal myself in. And you can't see me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I wonder today if we don't see the expression and truly identify with that expression, if we could only understand that within your sick body is the logos &gt;&gt; and why God is living in your sick body and chose your inability because he's wanting to express himself &gt;&gt; as healer. &gt;&gt; Now, I I I preached here a couple couple weeks back on the right thoughts, thinking the right way, having the mind of God within you. And this is where I thought I would just go a little bit further because if you don't choose the thoughts of deity, if you don't choose, and this is the where Jesus had to say, who was in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but become the form of a servant. Amen. After the fashion of a man, amen. I want to say today, you are predestinated to be conformed to that word image. So though you are in the form of a man, there is the form of the logos on the inside of you that is taking your body back to Eden again, taking you back to perfection again, taking you back to deity again, taking you back. You've got to see the form of God in you. &gt;&gt; You see, amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I say you got to watch what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; You got to watch what you're what you think about. You got to watch what you entertain. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't entertain spirits. You entertain God in the form that he's in. &gt;&gt; And he's in his bride. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the Jews couldn't understand him. They didn't see him. They knew him not. But yet, First John 1 and1, and I I I like this. I've I've used this a lot lately. That which was from the beginning, which we heard and which our eyes seen, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life. &gt;&gt; See, they were rejecting. But yet here's one the elect that was saying the word of life. We've slept with him. We've ate with him. We've the form that God was living in. We were there. Can you say amen? Amen. Hopefully I'm not too scattered this morning, but the farm Hallelujah. When I look upon you, Amen. I want to say a my hands have handled. Amen. My ears have heard. I have looked upon God's form. Can you say amen? Oh yes. It's not the form of a prophet. It's the form of the bride. Amen. They are the ones that have been called out. You are the ones that God says, "I'm going to rapture and manifest my glory through." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, there was no one twisting the arms of the early church, &gt;&gt; but Jesus would just pass by and call them and they would respond. Amen. Bible says there in in Matthew 4:18, he he came by Peter and Andrew and casting their nets and &gt;&gt; Amen. and and he just simply says, "Follow me." And the Bible says straightway they dropped their nets and followed him. &gt;&gt; James and John. Amen. There in the 21st verse of the same chapter. Amen. There he was. And the Bible says they were mending their nets and he called them and they immediately left the ship &gt;&gt; and their father and followed him. &gt;&gt; Then he comes up and they Amen. uh there there in in the 21st verse or or no Matthew 9 and9 he comes up and he says you know he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saidf follow me and he arose and followed him &gt;&gt; there was a predestinated seed on the inside that see the expression of God &gt;&gt; and that was something that would be there oh can you say and he arose and followed. &gt;&gt; Now, there were plenty others, amen, that would say, "I want to follow you, too." Luke 9 27 to or or 57-62 would talk about it. Amen. And and and and they would say, "Let let me follow you wherever you go." I I I I I see something. I I see the They were attracted by the supernatural. They were attracted by They weren't attracted by his words. They were attracted Amen. by the form in which God was being expressed in. They fell in love with the form. A Amen. And and he said, "Listen, if you follow me, foxes have dens, birds have nests, but the son of man has no place to go. I have no place that I I can even lay my head." Amen. He says, "Come follow me." Amen. And it's all in those verses right there. He says, one says, "Oh, well, let me go bury the dead." He says, "Let the dead bury their own dead." Amen. And the other one says, "Well, I I need to get married and I've got to take care of this." He says, "What are you talking about?" Amen. He done three or four of them sitting right there. But you see, there was God being expressed and the elect was saying, "Let me let me be a part of what you are doing." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. The perfect expression of the perfect essence. This expression of God was not something from without. He wasn't pressured or persuaded from an outside force. Jesus proceeded from the very depths of his person. God was savior at heart. He was the most holiest of his of his divine attributes being expressed. love, the very bond of perfectness, divine holiness, mercy was being expressed through Christ when he laid down his life and he proceeded from the very depths of that perfect being and that great eternal logos, the creator of all things come in the form of a man to redeem man so that he could live within. Someone should shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As light comes from fire and thirst is quenched from water. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. So is it when that eternal essence of God comes on the inside of you, you the He's the light of the world and you become the light. &gt;&gt; You give you you. He doesn't come in you and then you become a man of the example of depression and discourage and sickness. No, I'm the light of the world. And you become the light of the world. The expression that is being expressed through me. I am mercy. I am compassionate. I am am the very heartbeat of God. So will you become because the logos is living in you. I know some of us are we we're all born different. Some of us are born melancholy. Some of us Amen. There's there's there's the four prime personalities that that one of us that we exist. Some of us have all four. Amen. We We're all born with with with that. There's those that's got the drive to take part and you ain't going to listen, he ain't going to follow you on nothing unless you can convince him around way that it's his idea, then it's going to go and you got to and you got to deal with that. I mean, this guy is is he's he's hallelujah going to do his own thing. God built him that way. There's there's the others that just have the limelight. They got to dress nice. They got to look nice. Amen. and and they're going to just walk outside there and they might not have a dime to their name, but they'll walk out there and they'll just look like I've got it put together. Amen. That's a lot of those guys are poets. A lot of those guys are Amen. that they're they're just expressive. Got to express. Then there's the other kind that's just really quiet. Amen. And man, he wants to he wants to be in the in the circle, but man, he's just he wants to do something, but and don't ever ask that person to lead something because they'll just fall apart, wet their pants, everything right there. Amen. And it's and it's not who they are. That's the way God made them. There's going to be are you that this is the this is the human anatomy. This is who we are. Amen. We're we're we're born. But when the Holy Spirit comes into us, we are no longer dependent on our personality, it's the word of God, the living Christ within us. Are are you hearing me? And then what does it do? It makes us all flow in together. It brings well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a person that is all that that is that is naturally uh born negative, Amen. That person is going to have a choice whether they are going to express their negative self or they're going to express the deity of Christ. &gt;&gt; It's their choice. Can you say amen? That's the reason why the Apostle Paul says, "I died daily. I died daily." That's why Jesus said, "Unless you take up your cross and follow after me, you're not worthy of me. You've got to die to your personal uh uh uh yourself. &gt;&gt; So that one that's just constantly negative can't say nothing good about nothing. I mean it could be someone give them a th and and and and instead of just saying thank you, there's got to be some kind of nonsense out of their mouth. &gt;&gt; What form are you expressing? On the other hand, there's that one that's meek and mild. And the one that's more meek and quiet and mild. That one there is is the one that's going to fight a whole lot of complexes. I'm not loved. I'm not good enough. I'm not that no one likes me. That well, praise the Lord. And there's some of you that are in this building that that that have to fight those thoughts. But you're not to express. This is the beautiful thing. Jesus was the was the germ seed of God born from a virgin birth. But yet he still had to be filled with the Holy Ghost at the River Jordan. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Now I want I want you to hear me. But the the purpose for the perfect form, the purpose for the for the form of deity, the the in a body, the purpose was for redemption so that you in your current form, in your current personality, God would raise you up and express himself through the body of the redeemed. [Applause] See, some of us with the with the with the with a big personality and take charge, we look to the ones that that struggle. Maybe they're a little more quiet and they fight their mind battles and we look at them as if they're a no. Listen, but I'm not going to pick on the guy because that, you know, the guy that's that's just he's got to constantly say sorry. Now, now the quiet one says sorry in their mind all the time. Anyways, they're just sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry for living. Sorry for this, sorry for that. Oops, didn't mean to. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Hallelujah. But but then the other guy that's the big tick charge guy. Amen. He's making a big doofus of himself half the time and he has to say sorry. &gt;&gt; What am I getting at? What I'm saying is there is no in any any of these personalities that we have. There is none of them. We're just like Abraham and Sarah. God had to come to those who could not produce it &gt;&gt; because it had to be God's word taken for in an old man, an old woman who was never able to have children. So God chooses us with all of our and I say personality flaws &gt;&gt; because each one of us look at ourselves and we think that we're just the biggest doofus around half the time. And yet God takes that form redeemed form &gt;&gt; that redeemed form. Behold, I send. Listen to the text. Behold, I send to you, Elijah the prophet, &gt;&gt; and he will turn your hearts back to the purpose of the logos. &gt;&gt; He will turn your hearts back to the faith of the fathers. He's got one purpose to tell you, you have a place in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And that as his word takes form in you, well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's some there's some that as soon as they get a little cough, oh, oh, I've got laryngitis. Oh. Oh. And then you start thinking about that and then that thought begins to take you to another feeling that you had that you've always had but your mind didn't let you but all of a sudden your mind starts playing and you got this and you got that you got this and right &gt;&gt; whereas that's the reason the scripture or the the prophet would say the right mental attitude will bring all of God's promises and the right confession Passion will bring your body in line with the word [Applause] &gt;&gt; because deity is expressing itself in another form. &gt;&gt; I I I think I think this is powerful because my the form that I'm in, God has redeemed me. He's redeemed my soul, but he's left me right here with me. I wish he would have saved me and then put me in a another body, but he saves me and leaves me with my biggest enemy, &gt;&gt; me. But the beautiful part is it's another form of God &gt;&gt; expressing himself &gt;&gt; through Abraham and Sarah expressing himself through a through a a a helpless Hebrew children expressing himself through through a a a prophet that has no power to deliver himself from a lion's den expressing himself oh church of the living God expressing himself. Are you understanding? Amen. And so he takes I say today the church the church thinks it not robbery though we're in this body in this flesh this word has been placed in my heart and I'm standing up and said I am the redeemed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, a body hast thou prepared? When ye come into the world, sacrifices and offerings thou wouldest not have, but a body thou hast. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, if God is still yet revealing himself in this form there in 1 Corinthians 12 and 27, you are the body of Christ and members in particular. 1 Corinthians 12:12, "For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one spirit are we baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been made to drink into that one spirit." So what he what what what he's saying is you are that body. It is God now worshiping with his people. It's not God's not wanting to be the object of worship. God is wanting to worship with his people. And you could see that in the throughout the scripture. Amen. There there as he a as he uh John 14:17. Even the spirit of truth and the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him. But you know him for he dwells with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come. Who is doing the talking? &gt;&gt; It's the logos. It's the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The world sees me no more, but you see me. And because I live, you shall live also. And in that day they shall know that I'm in my father and ye in me and I in you. It will be God worshiping among his people. &gt;&gt; You say, "I I can't I can't accept that. You're you're just bringing God down. You're you're bringing God down right to our level." No, it's God bringing you up to &gt;&gt; his level. &gt;&gt; They couldn't see it. They couldn't see it. But yet Psalms 2020 22:22, this is talking about Jesus. Amen. It was a logos. I will declare thy name unto my brethren, and in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. Psalms 22:25, my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation. And I, this is logos, this is this is the logos speaking the great pillar of fire. And I will pay my vows before them that fear thee. Isaiah 8:18. Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and wonders in Israel for the Lord of hosts which dwelleth in Mount Zion. Now, there's some of you that might be saying that has nothing to do. You're trying to make the Apostle Paul brings it in right here in and he takes all three of these all three of these scriptures here. Hebrews 2 and 11. For both he that sanctifith and they who are sanctified are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. And again, I will put my trust in him. Talking about God, the whole God. This is talking about that great pillar of fire living in you. And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, behold, I and the children which God has given me. For as much as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Don't you love that? &gt;&gt; Let this mind be in you. What mind? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He that was in the form of God says, "Listen, I'm willing to put that all aside to take on a body to be an expression so in turn they can put on my mind and become an expression &gt;&gt; of greatness." &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. That one that is on the inside of you is the voice is the same voice that was walking in the Garden of Eden. That one that was on the inside of you was the one that was screaming, "Wait, wait. I can't let you go." And that great funnel of love came back down. And God provided a remedy. It was that same one inside of you that came making the provisions. &gt;&gt; So that he could have this form. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, Jesus wasn't the first form of the logos. The logos was there in the beginning, that great pillar of fire. He comes down all through these other things. But his goal, his desire. Oh my. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham, when he would talk about Jesus, Amen. The prophecy, he says, he says he he Jesus was the answer of the prophet's prophecy. Here he comes riding on the f of an ass. What an attraction. God was fulfilling his promised word. The hour had been waiting for 4,000 years. Amen. Well, can you say? Amen. It was the presence of God that had an effect upon him that brought about the deliverance. And I just want to say today, amen, on the day of Pentecost, Jesus, the living word, was waved over the people. Amen. That Christ, that living word was laid. He had paid the price of redemption. He had cleared the way, amen, for that great pillar of fire to not just live in a form of Jesus, but now is living in the form of his bride. He paved that way. Hallelujah. So all men and women could come to him. He was waved over. Waved at the day of Pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind. And the way he was waved over the people, the Pentecostal people that was raised up at Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and to be waved again. We realize in the last day according to Luke 17:30 in the Sunday again in the day when the sen of man will be revealed or waved over the people. Who is that son of man in the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; That's the word that's being waved over the people. If all the teaching that we have and the confirmation of the word of God by the word of God by signs by wonders we see in the book of Luke here that we've just quoted Luke 17 and 30 Malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of men is dead. The son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right among us giving us life. And as Christ was the first one to raise from the prophets and so forth, although typed in many places, he was the first fruits of those that slept. In the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church, there will be a sheath waved again in the last days. Waving of the sheath. What was the sheath? The first one to come to mature. The first one that proved it was a wheat. That proved it was a sheath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The first one. Yeah. The first one. So if he says there's a first one, &gt;&gt; then there's got to be a second one &gt;&gt; and a third one. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are y'all hearing me? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Because there's some more sons and daughters of God &gt;&gt; right here that he's going to live through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, "Hallelujah. I'm sure you see what I'm talking about." It was waved over the people in the first time. There will come forth a for the bright age for a resurrection out of denom dark denomination will be a message with the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its power. Someone shout hallelujah. Behold I send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn your hearts your hearts. The word has already been spoken about there's going to come a bride. There's been churches churches. brides, brides, but there is one that is coming that will not fail, will not fall. Are y'all hearing me? It doesn't mean that we're all going to be born perfect. No. We're going to be living in the worst of the ages. We're going to be living the worst of times. We're going to be fighting the worst of the devils, but there's going to come one that will not fail. Why? She's found her identity. She is the form of the logos. She is the manifestation of the son of man. She is that living word in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If God can so take a prophet and so declare his word and his counsel through the divine words, I believe all of this message is right. &gt;&gt; Every bit of it. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why did God have to come in the revealing of the son of man and not just the baptism of the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Why? Because there had to be a perfect church. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be a church without spot, wrinkle, or blemish that is going to make the rapture. &gt;&gt; So, a perfect essence through the form of a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So that the words God God ain't going to speak any other way. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he has a five-fold ministry." He sure does. &gt;&gt; He sure does. And the five-fold ministry better line what they're saying up with what God has given to us through that seventh angel message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If there come anybody that tries to say, "Well, no, no, we don't believe it that way or we don't believe it that way." No. All it takes is one word. &gt;&gt; One word. We We want the whole book. &gt;&gt; Someone say, "Give me the whole book." &gt;&gt; I want the full revelation. I want the full manifestation. I only the full revelation will give you the full manifestation. &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew who he was and therefore he had faith. And when you know who you are, therefore you have faith. Let the sick say, "I am holy." &gt;&gt; Let the weak say, "I am strong." &gt;&gt; Let the discouraged say, "I am the bride of Jesus Christ." Declare the full counsel of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, when God raised Jesus from the dead, it would have been a lot easier for him. Amen. You know, to just let him to do something without without him being dead for three days. But it took a miracle to take that cold, stiff body that cold, stiff form &gt;&gt; that God had used. It took a miracle for him to raise him up at the third day. Someone says, "I just don't see how I just don't see how we're going to make this rapture. I don't see how. It looks so impossible." But he says on the third day, after three days I will after two days and in the third day I will raise them up. And here we are. Hallelujah. We have come. We have come through. Are you hearing me? We're at the end of the season in this third day we are living in. There has been a promise that miracle power is going to kick into that form. And that form is not going to be a dead form, but it's going to be a living form. Hallelujah. The bride is going to come into her ministry. Oh, church of the living God. Amen. I I I I I I wish I was a better preacher. I wish that I could Amen. uh uh put things out there more clearer. But I guarantee you one thing here. If I'll just be faithful and be the voice that God has asked me to be, or not the voice, I'm not even the voice. &gt;&gt; I'm just the microphone. Amen. Reflecting the seventh angel's voice that has come to declare that says you don't have to be in the old dead form. God's chosen your form to reveal himself through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he says that's what he's proved. Hallelujah. Ether proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself. the dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus cold, stiff, dead and in the grave, shaken to life and rise again and roll away the stone. I am he that was dead. So dead till the sun said he was dead. The moon said he was dead. The stars said he was dead. All nature said he was dead. And now the whole world has to recognize he is alive again. Where's he at? Where's he at? He's alive again. Where's he at? He says he's not only the mechanics, God's word. He was the dynamics to prove it. And as he being the groom, the bride has to go come forth &gt;&gt; cuz it's part of him. It can only be the manifestation. Someone says the manifestation &gt;&gt; of the fulfilling of the revelations. Are you understanding? It's got to be the manifestation of the revelation. The revelation had to come in order for there to be a manifestation. That's why we come to church every as much as we do. That's why we're doing these things. Why? We We just got to keep hitting it and keep on hitting it and keep on hitting it. Hallelujah. And we got to keep on preaching it and preaching it and preaching it. And you know, every time I'm doing that, you know what I'm doing? I am declaring that revealed word, that open book. I'm declaring that over you. It's a declaration. As there has been an open book, there shall also be a bride. &gt;&gt; There shall also be a bride. Well, glory to God. He's not looking at you. He's looking at the sacrifice. Amen. He's looking. He has declared you the form in which he wants to declare his word. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Now it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the bride. It can only manifest if it does something different from the groom. It isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. She is him. Someone say I am him. &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; when he takes on that form, the form becomes synonymous with the one that is living within it. &gt;&gt; Jesus becomes synonymous. He was only here for 33 years, but Jesus is forever synonymous &gt;&gt; with that logos. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the word comes to you and comes in you, you become that living manifestation. If the musicians would come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She is flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. Yes. &gt;&gt; As a man and woman are one and the woman taken from his side. She has had and has and taken a spirit the feminine spirit from him. The flesh from his side both mechanics and dynamics the wife. The spirit of him and the flesh of him put it together and it's made the mechanics and the dynamics. Hallelujah. He says, "How can good man do anything else besides the power that has been released to them? He said, "I'm going to set up a box up here to represent that." And if God sends a certain spirit among them, that's the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that works among them. And we'll prove that through the by the church history and by the opening of the seals and the power that let loose. Watch exactly that the church responded to the anointing and they could not do they couldn't do nothing else. [Music] They become so wrapped up the Holy Spirit with them. They become so much at one that they could not do anything but reflect him. [Music] Did you see how he put it though through the opening of that word? He will prove youth by the history by the opening of the seals the powers that let loose which exactly the church responded to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else. They were God's form. All right. God bless you. [Music] Redee close. Her Lord has made. [Music] He's heard voice heed the call. Transformation abides in. Oh, she stand [Music] clothed in righteousness. Oh, glory to God. Her Lord has made her clean. She's heard. [Music] And she's heeded the call. Transformation abides in her soul. I stand redeemed. I stand. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Oh my Lord has made. Oh yeah. And I've heard the voice and I've heeded the call. Transformation [Music] abides in my soul. Christ the mystery of God revealed. He said the word moves on down into the body from the head. What is it? It's the same word. Nothing can be added or taken from it. So that same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one. They are husband and wife. They're flesh of his flesh. Word of his word, life of his life, spirit of his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. How do you know? It bears the same record, the same fruit, the same word. It manifests Christ. Same life, same God, same spirit, same word, same book, same signs, same things that I do shall you also. Oh, hallelujah. My notice the vindicated word in his body is his very victory and the reason of his death. The reason for the first form, bodily form, was for this last form. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Can you imagine? We are just the next step could be stepping in to your new body. You just don't know how close we are, friends. We're we're so close. And it's Jesus the logos and logos thought of not robbery. And I say today, if God is redeemed and I am his righteousness, then I'm going to declare I am the righteousness of God in Christ. He's not going to be grumbling through me. The Bible says he's going to be singing in the midst of the church. &gt;&gt; He's not going to have that old negative attitude. Although he is living in your flawed redeemed, [Laughter] but his spirit is so powerful. He's already made the He is so He is so confident. God doesn't have the little man syndrome. You know what the little man syndrome is? You know, just got to squawk loud and make people feel like they've got some authority. God is so confident that he says every name that is written in that book shall somebody say &gt;&gt; shall &gt;&gt; be redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every name. And he says, I put that name before the foundation of the world. All that the father hath given me. the word made flesh will come to me and I will not lose them one and I will raise them up. That means there's going to be some that's going to go into a state of impossibility. They're going to go down into the ground and there ain't going to be nothing left of them but a spoonful of dust. But I will even go back to that spoonful of dust and will raise them up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am that confident. I am that confident in my word. I And I'm going to declare to you today, I am not Amen to declare my my my old nature. Hallelujah. And when the Apostle Paul says you've got to die daily so that you can be raised daily, then so be it. God, let me die daily. Let me die daily. Let me die to my negative self. Let me die. Amen. To to to those uh uh uh th those old things around me that the the complexes. God, let me die to those things. I don't care what I see in the mirror or hear in my head. Amen. Or even hear from people around me. Don't let me don't don't don't don't don't let me look at that. I am the image of the invisible God. I am the power of the invisible God. His live his power, his mercy, his glory, his peace lives in me. Express that through me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, can you shout hallelujah? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am redeemed. I am redeemed. I am the one that he has called to express his glory through. How about that song? I I that fast one. I am redeemed by love divine. Oh, glory, glory. For Christ is mine unto him. I now resign. Yes, I have been. I have been redeemed. Oh, that's the thing that comes out of your mouth. I'm redeemed by love divine. Oh, glory, glory. Hey, Christ is mine. Oh, unto him now. Oh, I now resign. I have been. I have been. Oh, let's sing it again. Well, I am the love divine. [Music] Oh, glory. Oh, glory, glory. And unto him I now resign. Yes, I have been. I have been redeemed. There's a scripture that says, "And let the redeemed of the Lord say so." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many's ready to say so? &gt;&gt; I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; I am a son of God, &gt;&gt; daughter of God. I am the heir to the throne. &gt;&gt; Well, oh. Oh, now we don't want to take, oh, you're making yourself God. He lives in your body. &gt;&gt; It's no wonder. Do you all remember brother Brandham talking about the Reader's Digest had and and and being a prophet that brother Brandon would even use this story was incredible. But he said they had the faith healers and and so uh they were testing see if see if it was real or fake. And they had a they had a some kind of a meter or detector. And they said they had these ones that that had been going around praying for people. And he said when they put their hands upon the sick, they said there was a light that radiated from the hand into the body and they would be healed. He says, "Well, that's scriptural for that's that great light that I see." He lives in you. &gt;&gt; That great pillar of fire is in you. No wonder he says, "Lay hands on the sick and they will recover." The only thing that would keep that away is the lack of faith. Did you know unbelief is faith in the negative form? &gt;&gt; If you don't believe God can heal you, then you believe that the sickness is greater. &gt;&gt; You believe the sickness is going to take you out. You believe the sickness. You can't believe that God can heal because you've got too much faith in the sickness. Turn it around, son and daughter of God. God lives in you. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Wow. The situations around me are just all this and that and the other. Hey, turn it around, amateur creator. &gt;&gt; Create. Create. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God bless you. I love him. Hallelujah. What are you playing? I love him for he is mine. &gt;&gt; I love him. &gt;&gt; I love him for he is mine. [Music] I love him cuz he is divine. [Applause] I love him forever. It's true.

You have fashioned us. You have slid your wedding band of predestinated unmmerited grace and favor. You have brought a messenger to us, the Chamberlain that has told us your heart and all about you, all about your love for us. It's our heart's desire to please you, [Music] Lord Jesus. Not my will but thine be done. Live through me. Let me be an expression, the expression. Let me be the expression of your word for this hour. Let it be with every man and woman, boy and girl in this building. We thank you for it, Lord. We love you. Oh, we love you. And we give ourselves to you. We ask Lord that you would be with your people as we dismiss. We ask Lord that you would bless the food and that you would sanctify it to the health and strength of our bodies. that you would bless all of those who have prepared the food today. Let your presence be with us, Lord, as we leave this place, but not your presence. For you are with us and in us that we would come back tonight with our hearts eager to hear your word. Bless brother Gadman, Father, and see us preparing for this evening. Thank you for all things in the mighty name of Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. [Music] In light of you [Music] when I found [Music] &gt;&gt; God bless you as a brother's dismissound. [Music] become shadow. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I worship you. [Music] I worship you.
