come up hither they're in Revelations come up hither and the heavens were opened up and I believe that's what God is calling us to today up into those heavenly places with Christ Jesus amen if you have your Bibles let's look here in the Book of Revelations the first chapter and um um we are we we've been on uh this this thought here this the mysterious one in the midst of the candlesticks and um amen um and I trust everyone's got their Bibles I see some with phones come to church with Bibles and we've been teaching the kids lately to they need to be able to find scriptures in Bibles amen mamas and daddies and grandpas and grandmas need to teach their children how to look in Bibles and amen that way we know what we what we have and I you kids have really impressed me at how quick they have been able uh to get to these scriptures last last Wednesday night it was just whoa amen and so we we appreciate that that means there's some Sunday school teachers and mamas and daddies that are helping them praise the Lord all right let's look here we're going to we're going to start here back we're going to go back oh it's good to see brother and sister gadman God bless you and amen and I heard him pray and had already forgot to tell him amen we we're so glad to have them here tonight um let's look at Revelations 1 and um amen um let's just look at the seventh verse behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the Earth shall well because of him even so amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end saith the Lord which is which was which is to come the Almighty I John who also am your brother and companion and tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in The Isle that is called Patmos for the word of God for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last uh and and what thou seest write in a book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia and Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thotara Sardis Philadelphia and laodicea and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being interned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with the golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow his eyes were as flames of fire his feet like undefined brass and they burned in a in a furnace as if they burned in a furnace and his voice is the sound of many Waters he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell dead at his feet and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death let's go to the Lord in prayer this evening father we just want to thank him thank you for your love thank you Lord for coming this evening to talk with us and to share your your gospel with this Lord thank you for the revelation of this last day that you have given father we love you so much and it's such a privilege for us to come and to sit at your feet tonight and we're asking Lord that you would help us and take away our tiredness and and father I pray that that the that the Lord Jesus would just walk these aisles and would make himself real to us and may the glory of God just be among us tonight Lord those that aren't here I ask that you help them and encourage and heal and we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you amen uh good to have uh brother Harry and and sister Stephanie and the youngins back home and uh amen they were going on vacation and so we were sure glad to see them back home here this evening praise the lord well so um we're we're still on this mysterious one in the candlesticks and um um it's important I I wanted to just take take the time as we have um as we've been going through um this this seven-fold uh personage of Christ brother Branham says amen that this these first couple chapters are really um it's it is it is God expressing the deity of Jesus Christ Jesus is showing that that he is not the second person of the godhead that he is not the third person but he is the God God has glorified the body of Jesus Christ amen and amen they're they're in Acts 2 and 36 and and I'll wait for for you to find it in your Bibles um Acts 2 and 36 we we find that um that that God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ amen they're in Acts 2 and 36 and when you get there you can say Amen amen um we um and we'll read there now it says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ amen so both Lord and Christ I want us just to look real quickly let's go to Matthew 28. and 18 uh while we while we're here in man um this is Jesus talking as he is fixing to leave and Matthew 28 and and 18 he he tells them amen and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me now he has resurrected so now he is he is declaring to to his disciples all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me so so what does that mean what what does that mean to you kids what what would that mean when all power another place he said in Heaven and Earth is giving none to me amen that that that that means all of God is living in that glorified body amen now they're in the book of Philippians the Bible says he was exalted and said at the right hand of God and was given far above all principalities Powers dominions and and and and uh he was given a name that is above every name so all of God is now in Jesus Christ y'all understand that in the 19th verse it says go ye therefore teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things where whatsoever I have commanded you lo I am with your way even unto the end of the world now so now we've got the trinitarians that are trying to uh say there are three Gods now now Jesus has just declared all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me now then he turns right around to the next scripture and says go baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost now if all power is put in Jesus would Jesus turn around and say Amen but there's three equal ones in heaven that have power there's no three equal people in Heaven Nor God's in heaven that has power Jesus is the only one that has power now now this is this is important because when you go to um after he tells them to baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost if you go to Acts 2 and and a 38 amen and we can turn there too praise the Lord it's good to see brother John tonight amen we don't always get to see him on Wednesday nights praise the Lord it says then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost is that what he said no repent be baptized every one of you in the name of what Jesus Christ for the remission of sins man so so you've got amen so you've got the invisible God amen there you've got the invisible God that that fills all spaces all times all places then you say Amen he's invisible right amen just just to prove a point let's go to First Timothy uh one let's let's look here at First Timothy one because I think I think this is a we've got to have scripture for what we believe Hallelujah so if we go to First Timothy 1 and I believe it is it is the 17th chapter I just dropped my lid on that praise the Lord yeah yeah uh First Timothy 1 and 17. now are y'all there man hey give these kids a hand clap these kids are just awesome now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise God Amen so if there's three of them we've only got one wise one all right but there's only one wise God and he is eternal he is Immortal he is invisible the honor and Glory forever and ever can you say Amen so we've got the invisible God that is going to be manifested in three amen he's going to be manifested so I'm going to put I'm going to put this right here father man then we'll have Sun and then we'll have Holy Ghost amen now it is this is the invisible God being manifested or being declared a man being um uh uh the the great God over us which was Lord in the Old Testament he was called Jehovah he was called lord he was called Almighty amen this is this is this is this is that God that led Israel it was God above above us amen but now that God is looking for he's he's building a body so that he can become material Among Us amen he is he is now now the remember the scripture says here a Deuteronomy you can just write this down for those that are taking notes Deuteronomy 6 and 4 hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord Jesus said there in Mark 12 and 29 the first of all the Commandments is hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord can you say Amen now now the scripture says that now they're now then there's God revealed in the Sun and and if you would look there in first Timothy um I believe it's first Timothy 2 and 5. yes First Timothy 2 and 5. there is one mediator or one God one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus so now God has is moving and living in a flesh he's living in a fleshly body praise the Lord amen I'm getting somewhere so now it is God it was God expressing himself Amen in in three offices it is God the invisible God over Israel now it's God living in the people can you say Amen now when God wanted to express himself in the Old Testament amen he actually revealed himself through the logos which was that great Pillar of Fire now so when you look at God at the beginning if I could if I could put it uh in in that way if you if you were to look at in in the beginning the invisible God and then brother Branham says when God spoke then out of God came amen the invisible God came a physical form or or a a tangible form which was the logos God would forevermore live in that Pillar of Fire that's the reason why you seen the pillar of fire we don't have one in here uh the pillar of fire over brother branham's head that's the reason why when he would appear to Moses and the burning bush I mean man it was it was God in the fire amen sitting in the bush that was talking to Moses it was God Mountain on fire and God spoke out of the the Fire on the Mountain to the people amen it's it it was it was it was a tangible form of God and that's actually what he revealed himself to over the people as the fatherhood amen he would come in that Pillar of Fire on in in the uh to that Old Testament Church he appeared in the pillar of fire uh to in in uh in in um Elijah amen it was the great Pillar of Fire and it was God in a tangible form can you say Amen now no beginning of days no ending of days it is the great God now when Jesus comes it is now God made flesh let's look here let's look here in uh there in Saint John the first chapter we all know it amen Saint John 1 and 1. praise the Lord Matthew Mark Luke John and John 1 whoa amen praise the Lord Saint John 1. it's in the New Testament some of you old ones are I was thinking man I'm glad you said that because I couldn't find John amen Hallelujah now so Saint John 1 1 in the beginning was the word amen was the logos the word or the logos was with God and the Word was God so the pillar of fire was God's form that God lived in amen so now you have the invisible God the invisible then when he spoke then he become a Halo God is now living inside that light this is it right here God is living that Halo that is over brother branham's head that is God that that is God living in that Halo amen now now do I I I put some scriptures down here amen because um they're they're in Hebrews 12 and 29 and you can just write it down Amen in your notes for our God is a consuming fire amen and we just went through some of these others when when uh when God made Covenant with Abraham remember that he put him to sleep there in in Genesis the 15th chapter 8 through 17 and when he put him to sleep and and and and and uh after Abraham had had sacrificed all of the animals then God puts him to sleep and then the Bible says a burning lamp went in between all of the sacrifices as God made a covenant with him when Ezekiel seen God he saw that whirling Pillar of Fire but when Ezekiel saw him he saw he saw uh uh uh it amen uh God in a man amen he saw he saw the pillar of fire that was that was coming within a man being molded within a man so there was a man he said there was a fire going up there was a fire going down amen so it was God showing that he wanted to become human amen are you hearing me now I want us I want you to catch this as we as we are going because amen the great uh and and a few let's go back to Saint John for a moment you know we we read that there in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and then you go down to the 14th verse and the Word was made Flash so the great logos of God Amen come and lived within the body of Jesus Christ amen now now I this is this is because he's a redeemer God wanted to redeem he wanted to bring all of you children he wanted to bring all the mamas and daddies he wanted to bring everyone back to himself and the only way he could do this was to become a human can you say Amen so now does that make us two Gods no it's the invisible God within the pillar of Fire it's the pillar of fire that is now in the sun in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh is that right now that body but now this this body of Jesus it was sick it could it could uh it Jesus had headaches Jesus had everything just like you and I had Jesus could not he says could not do anything unless God told him to do it amen he couldn't he couldn't he couldn't heal the sick unless God told him to do it he could not pray for the sick unless God told him to do it Jesus was subject to that Pillar of Fire that lived on the inside of him Jesus prayed and said if it when he didn't even want to go to the cross Jesus was saying listen I know you're wanting me to go to the Cross but I'm asking if there is any way possible let this pass from me I don't want to die Jesus didn't want to die as a human but he was subject unto God man why because this perfect son was going to pay the price for every one of you and it was that perfect son and the cross that was going to enable the great Pillar of Fire to move on the inside of you and live through you can you say Amen do you all understand that so that's the reason why amen there is one God one mediator the man Christ Jesus amen there in second Corinthians 5 and 19. let's look here at that real quick before we move on into their our lesson for tonight second Corinthians now any and if you got questions and I I just want I um I wanted to go over this just take her time and make sure you kids are getting it anyone else want to add anything remember on these Wednesday nights you're welcome to talk amen second Corinthians 5 and 19. to wit that Christ or that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself by uh uh let's see to himself not imputing their trespasses and hath given unto us the ministry of reconciliation can you say Amen now if the 18th verse says all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ so God looking for a remedy there was only one way as we've already been going through it there's always there's only one remedy and that is to satisfy the the uh the the the dissatisfied the righteousness of God and the Judgment of God somebody had to die for our sins and whoever died had to had to be perfect because if he was a sinner then he would have to die for his own sins and the only way that we could be saved was for a perfect man to step forward and say I will die in the place of Luke Luke is guilty but I am not so I can go and righteously I can die for him take his sins upon me and then Luke can be free Hallelujah that's the way it was with all of us that was God in Jesus reconciling the world to himself amen now so we we we're thankful for that now the Holy Ghost amen well the Holy Ghost is the same thing as as as the the Holy Ghost is is the Messiah amen the Holy Ghost is is the anointing amen the Holy Ghost is it would be the pillar of Fire so we find out the Holy Ghost is the same thing as the father as we have did as we have shown to you over and over again amen Mary shall conceive of the Holy Ghost Mary shall conceive of the Holy Ghost which was the father of Jesus Christ can you say Amen now now that light now remember that same light came on the day of Pentecost that great Pillar of Fire amen this great Pillar of Fire that was here the tangible part of God now here we have the invisible God God created the pillar of fire lived inside that Pillar of Fire revealed himself throughout the entire Old Testament through that light that's the way he died but in the light he could not redeem he could not die he could not save so God then builds a body Jesus moves on the inside of Jesus to come and pay your penalty so now there's no sin held against any of us he took it no one can go to hell because Jesus died and went to hell for you know there's a lot of people that's died and there's a lot of people that went to hell but God then raised Jesus up from the grave to declare that your sacrifice has been accepted all right any questions any questions right right now Hallelujah all right so now what's the Holy Ghost Got to Do with It now that you are now that you are clean now that there's no sin held against you praise the Lord isn't it wonderful to know that now okay but just because you've been forgiven you've still got you have still got the desire to sin you can say Jesus forgive me for lying for telling a lie amen and you're forgiven but then the next day if you're a liar you're going to lie again I could die for Luke but that don't mean that tomorrow he ain't going to do the same thing again praise the Lord so what God does he comes and washed us with his blood now he has Groove all the Devils out of us he has cleansed us up Hallelujah he's taken the cup amen he has washed it with his detergent and now the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire that lived in the body of Jesus can now come in and live in you now it's God's holy life living through you it takes away it takes away all the powers of sin in your life yes you're still walking in a muddy world you still get mud on your feet you still get mud on your clothes amen but you see you're you're not a pig a pig wants to live inside the mud in the pig pen the Pig loves mud and and no matter what you do how much you clean it up it still loves mud and there's too many people amen while we're here there's too many people that get all cleaned up with the blood of Jesus and then they go right back out there again and they're getting all and they love it they just they just go dive like a pig right back in the mud they go back out and they keep smoking they keep drinking they keep doing those things because by Nature they are sinners Jesus does not want to just shed his blood to forgive Jesus wants to change the nature so that we can come back into fellowship with God again man it's not good enough just to be forgiven we want God's spirit God's life living through us amen any questions amen anything you want to add brother brother William sure yeah that was that was Jehovah living in that body yes it was a sinless body that's right that's that's exactly right but in but but Jesus fulfilled all of the Old Testament types and as a high priest then he was he was not going to be able to come into service until he was at the age of 30 years old and he would have to have as a lamb he would have to be washed and then he would have to be anointed for service amen so he didn't enter in his ministry until 30 years old but he was that brother Branham says that was Jehovah God laying in that Manger it was God that ate and slept it was God that that that done those things amen so so you're you're exactly right and but but the but but the anointing that the dove that came in and God saying this is my beloved Son hear ye him the man he was fulfilling the law uh all he was fulfilling so many laws and of of the sacrifice and the priest of that right there in that Jordan amen anybody else have anything they want to add praise the Lord now um so we we know that that light and when Jesus comes when Jesus comes he's going to reveal God Amen and they're in in first Timothy 6 and 14 and and we'll we'll wait for you to turn there because I want you to turn on that one uh First Timothy 6 foreign don't wait till the end for you kids to ask questions if you've got questions make sure y'all are asking them amen praise the Lord all right um 6 and 14 first Timothy that uh that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebukable until the peering of our Lord Jesus Christ which in his time he shall show who is the blessed and only potent potentate the King of Kings the Lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in light so let's let's go back and look at this again at the peering of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now remember Lord Jesus Christ baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost Lord Jehovah father son Jesus the body Christ the anointed one Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost that's the reason why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ one it was the Lord Jesus Christ who died it is the Lord Jesus Christ who Rose it's the Lord Jesus Christ that we will bow down to worship when we get to Heaven There is no Lord father Jesus Son Holy Ghost the Christ it is one in Jesus Christ amen now amen so it says at the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ he Jesus will show or manifest openly amen who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and Lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honor and power Everlasting amen when Jesus appears he's going to reveal who lives in that light amen are you hearing me he's going to reveal that invisible God it will be in the body of Jesus Christ all right Hallelujah so we all right amen so I wanted to go I wanted to go over that because amen this body is God's body of redemption now what we are looking at here in this Sevenfold personage of Christ that we've been looking at the last couple uh Wednesday nights is we are finding that he is no longer a lamb he is no longer a high priest he has moved his his role now not as the intercessor but now he is stepping into the role of Judge same God amen now remember we already went through all the scriptures there is only there is no other savior that beside me I am the only savior is that right then he comes in the body of Jesus Christ as your savior now he's going to step forward as a judge and you'll notice now the the mercy is over but God is still living in a body hello Mercy's over amen but God is still living in a body what we are seeing here amen with his head uh you know as as we look like uh uh last Wednesday night the man that his head was white as snow now I wonder if any of you kids can tell me amen what that represented amen you remember any of you adults yeah and represented wisdom yeah it represented the judge now now remember judges dating back way back to the 16th century amen uh they they would uh back into the 1600s they they wore white wigs and uh and and many nations still wear white wigs today amen the judge would come in in a white whip this this represented impartiality amen he you know he he represented the law and it distinguished him from anyone else in in in the in the audience he was there as a judge he he respected no person amen he was sworn to be uh non-biased he was or or prejudiced his decisions are to be based solely upon the law amen though he'd be a common man the judge is a common man just like you he might be your best friend you might play golf with him you might deer hunt with him you you you might he might be your father he might be your brother but when he steps in as judge and puts the wig on he is not going to he is he is not going to respect your person because you're his friend he's not going to respect your person because uh you're a brother he is now judged and he is one thing to do to respect the law when he puts the judge your hat on if you're guilty you'll be condemned amen now now it's incredible because the scripture shows they're they're in in Revelations the first chapter it says he comes with he comes with uh with clouds of glory and all I shall see him brother random says that's not when he when when we go up to meet him that's when he comes as the world leader and all eyes will see him all eyes will stand there amen there on the Judgment Day he comes in the clouds and all of the earth will see him amen and he'll have this white judge this white hat on Amen remember we just read that back in in uh uh in Daniel where the scripture says and I'll just read it to you uh we I we we all read it the other night but it but it says um let's see uh seven and nine I be held till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did set whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head was like pure wool now he's talking about the Ancient of Days amen this is this is the lordship this is the Father the Jehovah the Lord the Almighty this is amen this this is that God is he's letting him see a figure of him his throne was like a fiery flame his wheels as a burning fire that will that the pillar of fire and a fiery stream issued forth from before him and thousands thousands ministered unto him brother Branham says that's you and I we've already been caught up in the rapture now we've come back he is going to be the real the the the world judge the white Throne judgment is set amen and and and ten thousand uh times uh ten thousand stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open and I beheld them because the voice of the great words which the horns spake and I beheld till the Beast was slain and his body destroyed and came and given to the Burning Flame and concerning the rest of the Beast they had their Dominion taken away yet their lives were put on for a season in time and I saw in the night visions behold one like the son of man coming with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him and uh brought him near before him and there was given him Dominion Glory Kingdom that all the people Nations languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away his kingdom which shall not not be destroyed now here we are again we're talking here's the Ancient of Days here's the son of man all right but now are there two gods or is there one so if we've already declared and the Apostle Paul and the Apostle Peter and all of the Old Testament all declared as only one God then we've got to understand this is God showing wait a minute this is God showing what he's doing through the body of Jesus Christ praise the Lord amen okay now so we have this old board here we've I've had this long time actually I used that magic eraser on this the other day and so it took all of that pretty film off of it amen it had I couldn't get the words off the other so now here here he is standing now y'all don't be laughing at me Hallelujah amen amen so so here is this here's this wigged one here here's here's this wig one all right praise the Lord now he when we see him well he looks he he looks he looks pathetic okay now he's got the white wig one the son of man Jesus Christ has the white wig on now in the Book of Daniel it shows that the invisible one had the wig on but when we look there in the book of of of uh uh the Revelation it says that the son of man Jesus had the wig on it is God in the body of Jesus Christ he is now the judge now the girdle was once is is around the waist amen it holds the the the ephod on Amen so the ephod would come and hang down below His Garment or as down low and then this this girdle was put here to hold on the Priestly robes because and it also it was it was thick enough to to where they could pick up the lambs and it was it would protect it would protect their back as and that's the priest always wore that that girdle but now in this one the girdle is missing and now it is wrapped around his shoulders now it is wrapped around amen his his chest area he is now a judge he's now got uh I mean that's that's a pathetic looking amen Hallelujah he now has a wig on is that better that's even worse amen amen so he's wearing the wig just like the old judges did amen and he's standing there it is the great Eternal one coming as the judge to punish those who have rejected can you say Amen so now listen we want him while he's still got Mercy we want him while he is still amen God uh while his blood is still there now what was the next thing we seen the other night Flames his eyes were his flames of fire now think of it his eyes were once dimmed with tears he cried as they beat him he cried as he looked over Jerusalem and said Jerusalem Jerusalem he cried at Lazarus grave Jesus wept amen as as they as they whipped him and humiliated him he looked at him through eyes of compassion and said father forgive them but on that day there will not be a tear on that day it'll be flaming fire amen he's going to be judged can you say Amen now so tonight let's look uh for for a few moments at his feet like under brass amen now why would his feet be like brass anyone anyone have a guess amen why would his feet be like brass judgment brass represents judgment so write that down in your books or in on your papers brass represents judgment amen now now when we think about brass uh the Bible says his feet was like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace amen so now brass is well known for its hardness and and and brother Branham would say now this brass has stood the test of the fire a test that no other has gone through the brass signifies Divine judgment now does does anybody any anybody in the Old Testament can can anyone name where brass was used in the Old Testament and I'm just only I'm only just going to go through this uh through breast tonight huh yes Brazen Starbucks so we'll use that for a moment so the Brazen serpent how many remembers why the Brazen serpent was was was built any of you kids know why have y'all learned that why was there a Brazen why did God tell Moses to make a Brazen serpent ER that's exactly right so that that's right they had rebelled against God they were sinful they they rebelled against Moses and so fiery serpents had came out and was killing thousands of them thousands of them were dying Moses come to God to that Pillar of Fire that's that's that's the word of God he always when Moses would come and and visit that Pillar of Fire and he would tell them amen now now there was no Bloodshed Jesus wasn't born yet so there was no forgiveness of sins so what God done is God gave a a fig pre-figure of what Christ would do he said he said make a snake of brass now why would he say snake anyone anyone why would he make a snake with brass Hallelujah let me send judged but but why wouldn't it why why would why would it why a snake well now on the surface you would think that it would just uh uh because it's getting bit by snakes but no that's not the reason because sin came through the serpent sin came through the serpent so God said I want you to build a serpent made of brass which would mean sin judged praise the Lord and they would take this Serpent and he says I want you to lift it up really high so that everyone that's looks they will live anyone that looked at this Brazen serpent The Serpent of brass they would they would they might be dying just fixing to die and as soon as they looked at that snake they were totally healed praise the Lord sin was judged what's another place what's another thing in in the Old Testament that God used brass on man the Brazen altar so when God was going to put a a uh when in in the Tabernacle Amen to come and see God God showed three compartments and so that was a beautiful Masterpiece I hate to erase it amen so we had so these were the outer courts this is when this is where they would bring in and in order to come to God you had you had a Brazen you you had a a Brazen altar that you would have to come and you would slay the lamb now first of all you would you'd have to wash the Lamb with the brazenol uh labor then you would have to come in after the lamb has been washed and purified then the lamb would be slain now I want to I want us to think because there's there's there's three compartments this here is this here would be the blood of Jesus this is justification praise the Lord ah Wendell then sanctification and this here was the holy of holies which represented the Holy Ghost so you would have to come in with the blood of the Lamb right here you'd have to go in through the with the blood of the Lamb they would slay it right here in here you would have as you're coming into here you would have the Brazen the Brazen labor this is where you looked in the washing of the Water by the word as you come into here amen this in here is where the Holy Ghost is at this is where God dwelt this is where this Pillar of Fire lived okay now now I I without without getting too too much into that before you could come to God God always used brass and he always slayed a lamb to judge sin you kids understand that it represented so that Brazen serpent that was lifted up that was a type of Jesus now Jesus wasn't sin Jesus became sin Jesus became your sin your sin yours yours yours yours yours yours he became all of our sin and they put him on the cross so that his men in the Bible said Jesus says if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me those that will look to Jesus can be saved what does it take to be saved a real repentant heart and believing that Jesus died for you the righteous God took on a body and died for you he become your sin Luke he become your sin he took all of your sin on him so that all of his righteousness can come back on you so how many is repented of their sins Hallelujah then you are just as righteous as God is did you know the Bible says that somebody says well if I could just be like God you are you're just as righteous as God is when your sins have come into judgment Jesus Paid the price for you now what all did those guys have to do with that Brazen serpent all they had to do is to now there was a lot of them that weren't going to look because they were rebellious they were rebellious and they weren't the reason the snakes come is because they're rebelling against God's Prophet rebelling against God's word so when the prophet comes in and says here's the serpent look and live thousands of them said we ain't doing it but as many as would look they were healed that's all they had to do was to look and live Jesus if when we want to come into before God all we have to do is come with our sacrifice Jesus has already died Jesus has already paid the price for that everyone amen you say okay now what else do I have to do brother Wendell do I have to have do I have to believe in Jesus Plus do good works no no do I okay so so in order to be saved brother Wendell I have I have to believe in Jesus I have to believe in the sacrifice plus girls wear long hair then I can be saved right no no no you have to look to Jesus alone there's no good works that you can do to Merit salvation you must look to Jesus alone it's not what Jesus done plus what you've done no no it's believing what Christ has already paid for you Hallelujah you say that's too simple go ahead well it was judgment yes yes his sins had had came in and there was a significance to that he was under the Judgment of God and the Philistines had now come in and and had had bound him up and and that's exactly right but he was the elect so the elect is calling out to God even in their in their in their in their sins brother Brandon preached that message a couple times just once more and God heard his request God heard his cry can you say Amen now now do you all understand that you're saved not by works but you're saved by the blood of Jesus Christ amen now some of you you kids have any questions the adults have any questions amen so you're saved by the blood of Jesus Christ now you say it now if then we're saved by the blood of Jesus Christ then why do we come to church every Wednesday and every Sunday and why do we why do we wear our dresses and our long hair and why do we do those kinds of things then if we I mean then the rest of the church world must be right the must the rest of the church world they're right they're saying all I have to do is believe in Jesus and then it don't matter I can be a homosexual I can be I can be uh a lesbian I can be uh transgender no no why did the blood come because God had his children that wanted to do right but they couldn't because they were Bound by sin they were Bound by sin we wanted to do right God's children wants to do right God didn't save us say I'm going to shed my blood now you had better do this and this and this and this and this no no it's our it's it's something about that seed of God on the inside of you but you were never free to do it it's like a seed in the ground amen you got the seeds in the ground it's under the ground as long as there's no daylight that seed will never grow but when sunlight comes Hallelujah then the seed germinates and begins to rise toward the Sun and then before you know it you've got a flower here it's because there is always in the seed but it never could grow because of the darkness amen now here come God God come and washed us scrubbed us right so that his holy spirit can come and live on the inside of us now it's the holy God living in US aren't y'all thankful for that that's why we've got to have the Holy Ghost is that the Holy Spirit can live his life in me you couldn't do it as long as you're a sinner you couldn't do it but when Jesus came paid the price God couldn't even look at you y'all know that God would not even look at you until Jesus come to bridge the gap God's holy your sinner God's up here you're down here there was no it's sort of like it's sort of like the Republicans and Democrats there ain't no meeting in the middle amen but then Jesus came and took you a sinner and took the hand of a holy God and through his body he brought you and God right back together Hallelujah now you're free to love him you're free to worship him you're free to is that right you understand amen it's my desire to please my father amen I wanted to please my father but I I had to have a lot of his forgiveness too amen so so remember I was always a son and you kids might do things that your mom and daddy don't care for your mama might oh she might be screaming at you sometimes but you know what you're always her son she'll never say you ain't my son because you make me look bad and you make me mad and oh right you're still her son even though she's having to whoop you you're always her son and every night just because you're dirty that doesn't mean you're not her son or your daughter she just makes you go get in the shower every man and wash up amen before you go to bed is that right sometimes you kids don't want to go to the shower amen especially the girls boys you know we're always clean but so there was a joke amen so Jesus was made flesh Jesus took our Jesus Took the Judgment of God all of God's Wrath was poured out on Jesus are y'all hearing me amen you kids understand him all of God's Wrath was poured out on Jesus all this all the sin was paid for through him amen now here was the deal here's here's here's the deal Satan knew God's law and Satan had you in a prison cell he had he had you there to where there was no way that you were going to get out you were God's Sons you were God's amen Adam and Eve here's here's the first man the first woman amen they sin now when you sin the wages of sin is death now every one of God's children were in bars you're in jail every one of you they went to jail and you were born in jail all of God's people were born in jail born you're you were prisoners to sin there was no hope for you Satan is the Jailer amen so here here is Satan with his with his pitches his horns and well I don't even look like Satan that looked like a gerbil amen so here's here's the bad devil right there he's got you he's got you all all in jail and he knows that a Kinsmen redeemer is the only one that is going to be able to get you free God looks over here God the great invis or the great Pillar of Fire he can't do nothing because a righteous man's got to die and every man that is born is that is born of a woman is born speaking lies shaping an iniquity and there's no hope so God comes down God builds him a body in in a in in a little baby right here in a in a Manger it is born he grows up he pays the ransom and then God comes in opens the prison doors for you so that you can come out and be free amen Jesus became your sin so that you can come out of the jailhouse you're still looking at me puzzled amen you'll understand now what's going to happen for those who refuse to come out for those who refuse there's nothing left but judgment amen if they choose to still be Sinners if they choose to steal a man to not accept the blood of Jesus Christ what we have just seen now is he is now the judge he's got the wig on he is standing there with a book amen he is he is standing there saying listen I was once your mercy I was once there trying to help you I sent you preachers I sent you mamas and daddies I sit and you refused now Jesus Is Standing There Eyes Of Fire got the wig on as a judge his feet is brass and he is now going to bring judgment to all of those who have who have refused to accept him amen amen the Bible says those feet of brass will crush his enemies and there will be no hiding of that judgment there will be no longer the mediator his interceding days are over can you say amen hallelujah now he'll be the judge of the Earth right now he's still the mediator and you think why does God allow those transgenders why does God allow all those filthy things to go on is because God is still standing there interceding he's still standing there waiting for the very last of his sons to come in he's still sending preachers out amen that's why we come to church that's the reason why it's so important for us make sure you tell your friends about Jesus tell your friends about what God is doing get him in this church now if they stay that's up to God if they want to accept it that's up to God but our job is to get him in here and try to preach that gospel is the best we can and to try to tell them about the about the Lord Jesus Christ the best we can is that right because the day will come where he's not just going to sit there in Mercy right now there's trampling all over God they're trampling all over his word right now they're saying if he was God come on they think he's a myth but one day Arnold Schwarzenegger who just got up and said heaven and hell are just myths one day Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to find out that there is a real God and Mercy's over and now he's going to stand before God as the judge and you can't ask forgiveness then these transgenders and all of this kind of stuff that's going on around here all this filthiness in the world it might look like God's just where is God God is looking he's looking for his own he's sending you a mom and a daddy and he's sending you preachers amen he's sin and he's and he's and he's trying to let you know hey get get in get in Christ get forgiveness of your sins ask the Lord for his mercy and his help amen can you say Amen because the Day's coming where the book of Mercy will be over now when that book is open now it's going to be it's going to be another book open and it's going to be a book of judgment can you say Amen amen those lgbtq activists are going to be amen they're going to be screaming for Mercy someday for every child's mind that they have warped they're going to be they're going the wicked will have no place amen those feet of brass are going to crush the Antichrist it's going to crush all amen all of the and it's going to crush amen everyone that is that has taught against the things of God every porn star they met every Shameless vulgar uh uh sodomite we'll all have to stand someday I say today don't you be a part of her I know I'm I'm doing it simple for these kids but listen to me adults have enough of that amen God sent his blood for you he said his blood for you to bring you out so that you won't have to be a part of the Wrath that is to come can you see him man they'll all be screaming for Mercy right now they're Shameless right now they act like amen that they're God Hallelujah amen uh Tina sent me a deal the other day you know of a concept that they're trying to come up with and and I'm sure some of y'all's already seen it but they but but but the big wigs are that the big minds are talking about this whether it's it's in incubator it's it's it's it's these are little uh it's a it's a setup where the incubator you take the semen of the of of the of whoever you want you know you can and and uh and and you know it's an artificial womb it's an

you can take your seed and you can mix it with with others and and they're saying that you can you're literally if if you've got if you've got if you've got um um sugar diabetes that runs through your genetics then you can do uh you can alter the gene and and take that out and put something else in it until there's going there can be perfect human beings and they're and they're and they're bringing this kind of nonsense and the you know they're they're this concept that that these that these wealthy men are trying to come up with and and and how that you know it's just it's an incredible thing to to to to think that they're even thinking that way see they're trying they're trying they're trying they're trying but the only way that you're ever gonna you're ever going to fix the world problem is to fix the sin problem and Jesus became sin so that he can fix it but no one wants to look to Jesus they want to fix it themselves amen so I say today amen let's come to Christ is that right the judge of all mankind he will come he's going to crush his enemy he's going to destroy the church systems amen he's going to destroy the modernist he's going to destroy the the the the the the the the you know those that have worked their way those who have found other religions he's going to he'll stand there that day and there'll be no mercy for any of them that body that is interceding for you today will become judge if the musicians would come praise the Lord oh let's run to Christ huh amen let's run to Jesus come to Christ amen so what is the father Son and the Holy Ghost what was the father Lord Jehovah the son Jesus the sacrifice the Holy Ghost the Messiah the pillar of Fire the logos the anointing can you say Amen did you know that the same the same holy ghost that that come in in in Jesus day on him is the same Holy Ghost that's upon you amen he is I'm so thankful for that tonight amen I'm so thankful I love him love him with all my heart and I don't want any of us to be to be lost and um we don't want we don't want anyone to make to miss this rapture and I I asked the Lord for every one of us don't let us just sit here in a sit here in a church and not have a not have a a revelation if there's anything that we should be asking for as God let me not try to understand with my own mind give me spiritual Revelation all reveal yourself to me let me let me see it the way that you wrote let your let your let your mystery become become reality in my mind and heart man praise the Lord I love him tonight love him with all my heart I say while we while he's still there with Mercy let's let's run to him while there's Mercy let's ask the Lord to help me if you've got habits if you've got sins that you're dealing with remember sin will keep you away from God but the Blood come in Amen to reunite you [Music] and if you try to keep the blood out of it you you don't you don't come in and confess it then you've still got the block Christ means nothing but if you can ever get that you come to Christ let him bring you us your you and before God when you come in there and the presence of the Holy Spirit he can take all Sin from you so take all unbelief from you he'll worship he'll wash your wide like snow amen aren't you glad for a great the great high priest glad for Jesus Christ I don't want to be rebellious dear Lord no don't let me be rebellious let me walk with him fellowship with him praise the Lord amen I love him for he is mine [Music] I love him foreign [Music] that want to cry it's now got eyes of Fire when the Rapture takes place brass that once represented forgiveness sin judged bring judgment to the world oh my the priest the girdle that was once worn around the waist is now up here around the shoulders [Music] judged friends don't play with God oh don't play with God [Music] it'll be the same body Jesus God will never go without a body again [Music] the body came redeemed and to pull your every one of you lost Sons and Daughters back home don't look lay on a Sia don't look at all of the sin and refuse and enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season and refuse to look up except don't sit there in that prison house don't get accustomed to this world and then fool yourself and say I'm fine o sons of God the whole world is saying I'm flying the Bible says they're trampling the blood of Jesus Christ under their feet [Music] but you see that same old pig that I talked about earlier that you can go get out of the mud and wash it up and put perfume on it [Music] put a little bow on it make him look good you can bring that pig in the house say all right you're gonna be my little cat you see he's still a pig at heart and if you ever leave the door open you just watch out you might have him a hundred miles from the old mud pit that he was in but if you ever let your your sprinkler go too much in your lawn and you get a little bit of a muddy area in your grass you know where that Pig's gonna go he's gonna go Waller in that thing and he'll just sit in that thing and he'll just dig before you know it the pig pen 100 miles away is coming right there in that nice little front yard because the pig is a pig amen but when Jesus comes he don't want to just wash us he wants to take the heart of the pig out and put the heart of the kitty cat in [Music] it's just a purr now you just got your big old fat thing on your lap that's what God's done for us remember we've got an eternal seat on the inside here now this here this comes from the sexual birth and speaking lies we've got a nature of sin within us God changes that all of a sudden our desire is not for the pig anymore not for sin anymore our desire isn't for this world and sodom's conditions our desire is to please the Lord amen I love him I love it tonight [Music] oh yes I want to be on this side with him ministering unto him while he is while he is you know bringing the wrath of God to the people in judgment is that right the scripture says that when he come and judges the world you're going to be riding with him on white horses he's not coming to judge you've already been judged it's been judged through Jesus Christ you've accepted that said in the Throne of judgment with him praise the Lord praise the Lord and all the people that have seen your life all the people that have seen Christ lived through you they'll be judged by the life that you lived in front of them oh it's an important thing friends can you save Matt we didn't get to the voice of many Waters but brother Branham said oh he said the voice many Waters that's seven
