aren't you glad for the Lord Jesus here to today amen so thankful for his love to us and amen his his uh greatness Amen to his to his elect it's good to see everyone out in in the house of the Lord today and um uh again as brother Merl had said good to see brother and sister Applegate and and all the way from [Applause] Henrietta and just good to see everyone here today today amen why don't we look here in the scriptures and um we'll look here at Ephesians the first chapter um amen we definitely um are thankful in this season we have so much to be thankful for and um amen um this this time that has been set aside uh to you know to go back and and um down memories Lane and and think of what God has has done in sending us Jesus Christ that virgin born son of God and um I'm I'm thankful for that today thankful to know that amen uh that that he couldn't uh stay in heaven without us amen that that he had to come to redeem me and you and so we're thankful to him for that we're going to look in Ephesians 1 and 1 and uh we're going to go to the fourth verse it says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and I'm I'm want to really deal with the Saints here this morning um to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he ha chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen now if you would look at the original it it actually the in love belongs with the fifth verse so it actually should say that we should be holy and Without Blame before him period in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will let's go to the Lord in in prayer father we want to thank you for all all of your goodness for all of your grace thank you Lord for being so good to us and good to our families and thank you Lord for giving uh eternal life to us Lord through Jesus Christ and we're asking Lord that you would be with us here this morning as we as we set at your feet we ask Lord that you would speak to us and Lord let the words of life have come from your gracious lips and Lord let it settle in our spiritual ears down into our hearts father we thank you for it thank you for all that you mean to us now Lord I'm asking that you would help us today help me to get out of the way Lord and Lord and just allow you to use this my my voice and my body father and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here this morning amen we want to um think along these lines as as I'm just going to uh think about this to the Saints amen which are at Ephesus to the faithful which are in Christ Jesus and the positive word that that God has has placed over the bride we' I've used that word quite a bit lately they were from some quotes that brother brandham had uh that brother brandham had talked about that we're living in the days of positive word amen where it's no longer a shadow of the hand amen but we have gotten so close to the light that we are clearly seeing the object of that amen that the light has been shining upon the Old Testament had the had the types and the Shadows but Jesus was the anti-type or he was the positive word amen so everything of the Old Testament they seen the Shadows of the positive amen they could they could see that God was looking for a redeemer that God was redeeming God they could see the heart of God Amen but when Jesus game he was the very object amen that that um uh they were looking for so it is today there has been a amen there has been a promise looking to a a perfect Church looking to a Rapture looking to the sons of God coming into their position but we're living in a day not of just in the shadows of yesterday but we're living in a positive because we are here Amen in the Fulfillment so it's no longer a shadow of things to come amen a shadow of a church that is going to be raptured but we are living in the days of the Fulfillment amen so this day of rapture requires a perfect Faith now the reason that God sent us a prophet to bring things more positive to you is because there's got to be a positive faith in the positive word each generation had to believe their age they had to believe the message for their age and so God in this age as it has come and become more clearly it's coming from you know justification sanctification uh there was the isusa street baptism of the Holy Ghost but there was that there was the promise coming closer and closer and closer and when God wanted to bring it to this day God says I'm going to send a prophet to where there is absolutely no doubt no Shadows anywhere of who you are and and and and what I've got for the day I don't want no guessing amen because this is going to require a perfect faith my wife's been listening to the perfect amen perfect faith lately amen and I I I'll hear it and I I told her the other day as well add Messiah to that too and amen because perfect faith and the Messiah is a are are are incredible uh passages where where brother bradam is is is is declaring amen that there is a people again on the earth with that Faith they've got a perfect word which is giving perfect faith and therefore God's got Messiah is right here little Messiah is under the great Messiah little Messiah is UN anointed under the great word for the day amen to fulfill God's words how many believe that God has got all power right here in in in Le odys the anointing of the holy spirit is right there with you you do not you do not have anything second class you have the very dynamics of God now whether you want to believe that and accept that and appropriate that that is up to you but I'm here to tell you what God has sent to Earth is the greatest thing of all time Amen to take you into a Rapture now now I I I want to to really look at that because you you know uh the Jesus told his disciples there in Matthew 5:37 he says let your yay be yay and your Nay be nay amen don't let your yes don't let it be yes and no amen that's double-mindedness that's amen you just you just don't know amen but 2 Peter 3 and9 says the Lord is not slack concerning his promises somebody say the Lord is not like concerning his promise he does not say yes no maybe yes no amen the scripture says there in fact in 2 Corinthians 1:18 it says But as God is true our word toward you was not yay and nay for the Son of God Jesus Christ who was preached unto you by us even by me and sylvanus and timotheus that uh was not yay and nay but in him was yay for all somebody say all oh aren't you glad for that well I wish God could do this but I amen I I just don't know if God can perform Miracles all the promises of God in him are say it with me are yay and in him amen now amen so when God gives a promise then we need to step up to the plate and say I believe that I accept that I want that promise to become positive in my life hallelujah how many's ready to step up to the plate and say God Amen I want you to give me what everything that you have given us now amen it's important because we've got in in uh in Congress you know uh we've got the the the amen uh what what do they call that the uh the uh propitiation or the Appropriations Committee amen that that has been uh uh you know the president and the Congress they come up with a funding and amen and they they select what this funding is all go to and then there's the Appropriations amen that that oversees that and so the money is there but it requires someone to come up and say listen it's already been voted on it's already been accepted it's already been approved I need the money to fund this certain program or I need the money uh uh for the uh you know for uh for the military for this for that amen and it's already there but I want to say here today that God in his own will God had no other counsel God in his own will has already appropriated everything that you need in this Earth's Journey all the way from amen the time of your birth all the way to the time of the Rapture and your body change there is nothing in between that God has not already appropriated for you in this journey aren't you glad for that whether you need healing this morning you can stand up to the plate and say God Amen I'm just asking for my healing it's already mine it's already paid for it's already taken care of I am here believing what you have to say your promises are yes and forever settled amen hallelujah amen forever settled the scripture says Thy word is forever settled in the heavens amen Jesus says let thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it already is in heaven he's already appropriated it now let my heart come in line with that that word and say so be it unto me if you're needing healing this morning so be it unto me if you're needing the baptism of the Holy Ghost so be it unto me Amen to the Saints which are at Ephesus amen now there's there's a lot of um learned theologians that amen uh or most of them say that the two to the Saints of or to Ephesus not in the original text amen that it was actually written to Le osia and and um uh so there's there's been I but I I thought even if if if they are true it is quite an appropriate it is quite an appropriate uh uh uh thing because Le oosa is having an Ephesus can you say amen amen but when we think about the Saints when Paul started this epistle Amen to Ephesus he pinned to the Saints which are at Ephesus amen Saints God's chosen God's elect amen the word Saints comes from the Greek word hagios amen and and it it literally means sacred it it means physically pure morally blameless ceremonially consecrated amen so when God is looking and and when the Apostle Paul is wanting to place the Saints now this was not just a the the an average letter this was not you know to to the the Corinthians that that he was constantly having to correct and and and get on to him but this was the positioning this this is the positioning uh a a letter of the New Testament positioning the church where they belong and when he starts out he he is saying that this is not to amen uh h a church member this is not to uh The Sinner this is not to a wannab be this is to God's very elect that he has purchased with his own blood can you say amen amen so so that word Saint would be the the the great uh uh doctrinal word of the epistle and I and I want us to look at it for just a few moments because I find this uh uh very peculiar when the Paul was was was looking for the term to to uh uh Express what the believer is in the sight of God Amen and Holiness and Purity and amen there there were no other words in the Greek language that the Apostle could take and he he took that word hagos which was right out amen of of Amen it's a term right out of the Pagan Greek religions there there was no other word for Holiness there was nothing else that could be used there amen there were well there were four other words of uh uh that that related to Holiness but nothing as Purity to the it always was the the the Holiness of a god it the Holiness of a deity the Holiness of a but the Apostle Paul would would would take it beyond that and and to let you know that the god you're serving is not just the holy God Amen the the righteous God which he is he's not just the amen the the the the pure God but the one that God has Redeemed by his blood amen has taken in the Purity or the righteousness the the amen the glory of that God that they are worshiping now now no other no other place could give that to you again amen the pagans would use it to amen it it was to uh uh devote something to a God Amen it always had an object in mind in other words the temple is Holy therefore separated uh uh for the gods or the gift that you brought to the temple is Holy and separated to the God Amen or the sacrifice is considered holy and separated to their deity but when the Apostle Paul took it he says the Saints are holy and pure and separated unto their God Amen it was something that the other pagans could not do because their sacrifices their gods their their their temples had nothing to be able to touch the heart of a man but the blood of Jesus Christ is so powerful that it makes you as holy as God is Holy amen uh brother Michael
