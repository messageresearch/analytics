[36:53] remainer the service into your hands
[36:56] name of the Lord Lord Jesus Christ we
[36:57] pray amen you may all have your
[37:02] seats I
[37:04] will so this before I uh left for the
[37:09] afternoon I was talking with uh brother
[37:12] William and um I was talking about that
[37:14] I had two different thoughts that I was
[37:16] uh thinking about and um neither one of
[37:19] them were finished thoughts um and I
[37:23] wasn't sure which direction we were
[37:24] going to be going and so uh went home
[37:26] with my family and spent a little bit of
[37:29] time looking in at one thought and I was
[37:32] putting some more quotes and verses and
[37:34] things with it but it was never quite
[37:37] coming together and um I spent the most
[37:40] of my time at home trying to work on
[37:42] that and it just wasn't connecting like
[37:45] it was supposed to and about five
[37:47] minutes or so before we were supposed to
[37:48] leave to head back I started looking at
[37:50] the other thing and um things started
[37:53] stacking up and I just kept thinking
[37:54] about it on the way here and so any
[37:56] ended up
[37:57] going that thought Direction and so
[37:59] we'll see how the Lord works with it and
[38:02] it's going to seem very confusing as we
[38:04] start because after having read those
[38:06] verses uh the title for tonight's sermon
[38:09] is going to be the fourth servant and
[38:11] every one of you is sitting there going
[38:13] how in the world do any of these things
[38:15] tie together and Lord willing we'll find
[38:17] out um and we'll see see how it goes so
[38:25] um brother random talks in the sermon
[38:29] the Queen of Sheba and he says but that
[38:32] little Queen wanted it but the first
[38:34] thing she wanted to know was it
[38:36] scriptural or not she studied all the
[38:38] scriptures then she said I'm going to do
[38:40] another thing I'm I'm a queen and if
[38:42] that message is right I'm going to
[38:44] support it and she ladened camels with
[38:46] gold and M frankincense and all kind of
[38:48] costly apparel and such she said if it's
[38:51] right if that God is re a real God then
[38:54] I'm through with this thing I've been
[38:55] serving and and I'm going to support it
[38:57] with everything I've got that's the
[38:58] attitude listen God's not concerned so
[39:01] much about your money but he wants you
[39:02] to support him with all that you are he
[39:04] doesn't want 10% of your money so much
[39:06] as he wants your time your talent your
[39:09] testimony and all that you are to be
[39:11] given into his hand so he can control
[39:13] you he wants to be your lord not only
[39:15] your savior but your lord lordship to
[39:18] govern and she said I'll support it if
[39:21] it's right if it's not I can bring my
[39:22] money back home that's a good sensible
[39:24] thing for a lot of Americans to listen
[39:26] to
[39:27] and he talks about it as well in the
[39:29] sermon a greater than Solomon is
[39:31] here brother brandom speaking said she
[39:34] said if that's not right I'll bring my
[39:35] money back if it is right I owe
[39:37] something to it that's the way we should
[39:39] feel if this be God not only our money
[39:41] our money is little but we owe him our
[39:43] hearts our time our talents and
[39:45] everything that we have we owe it to God
[39:47] if it's right let's go into it with
[39:49] everything we got if it isn't right go
[39:51] find what is right and then get into it
[39:54] that's right so we're going to start out
[39:57] a little bit different this evening um
[40:00] and I am going to of the the four boys
[40:03] that are sitting here on the the front I
[40:05] need three
[40:08] volunteers okay Aaron it's one Simmy
[40:12] it's two Paul all right we've got three
[40:15] all right boys come on up and then I'm
[40:17] going to draft brother Robert to come up
[40:22] here and so that's right be J walk up
[40:27] here come up to the front come on so
[40:30] we're going to have these boys acting
[40:32] out a little bit of something for us and
[40:35] they have no clue what they're doing
[40:36] there they have no script and so
[40:39] everything is well but as soon as I
[40:40] begin to tell the story they're all
[40:42] going to know exactly what their parts
[40:44] are and what they're supposed to do
[40:47] so there once was a rich
[40:51] landowner and this Rich landowner was
[40:54] going to go onto a trip
[40:57] he was going to go away and so he called
[40:59] his three most trusted
[41:01] servants and he was going to give them
[41:03] money to take care of his business and
[41:06] to run his business while he was gone
[41:09] and so he went to each one of his
[41:13] servants you get to pick them out so the
[41:15] first servant that came up he went and
[41:18] he gave him five talents for him to use
[41:22] to gather his to to to used while he was
[41:26] gone to the second one he gave two
[41:28] talents and then to the third he gave
[41:31] one
[41:32] Talent now after he had given his
[41:37] talents he went on his journey you can
[41:39] go just sit on the platform for a minute
[41:41] he went on his journey and he left his
[41:43] three servants to do the work and now
[41:47] the first servant that had the five
[41:50] talents which one of you is
[41:52] that Simmy all right so Simmy you were
[41:55] thinking about how you could increase
[41:57] that and you decided you know I bet you
[42:02] if I go spend some time with Brother
[42:03] Steve we're going to be able to do some
[42:05] business together and we'll be able to
[42:07] have an increase so go ahe and go go
[42:09] over to Brother
[42:11] Steve then who had the two talents all
[42:14] right so Paul had the two talents and he
[42:17] was thinking about it and you know he
[42:20] really for some reason his mind kept
[42:23] going to to music and worship and so he
[42:25] decided deed that he was going to go
[42:26] spend some time with brother Colby and
[42:29] he was going to find a way to get
[42:30] increase there and so he went to to see
[42:32] brother
[42:33] Colby and Aaron Aaron had been given the
[42:37] the one talent and Aaron wasn't quite
[42:40] sure exactly what to do he wasn't
[42:42] exactly quite exactly sure about how to
[42:44] handle it but he decided to go home and
[42:47] just kind of tuck it under his pillow
[42:49] for the moment you can just go back to
[42:50] your seat on the front row for a moment
[42:52] and so he went and he just kind of stuck
[42:54] it under his pillow stuck it
[42:57] under his bed wherever while he tried to
[43:00] figure out what he was going to do how
[43:02] he could do anything to actually receive
[43:06] an
[43:06] increase and time passed and as it went
[43:11] the rich landowner brother Robert
[43:14] returned from his trip and when he got
[43:17] back he immediately called his his three
[43:19] Faithful Servants to return to them so
[43:22] that way he could find out how they had
[43:23] done all you guys come on up
[43:26] come on
[43:29] back and the the Lord called up and the
[43:33] first servant brother Simi comes forward
[43:36] and go on
[43:39] over and he presented back all that he
[43:42] had gained and through his time with
[43:45] another brother through his time he had
[43:47] been able to invest those wisely and so
[43:50] he had grown his five talents into 10
[43:54] talents and then we had brother Paul
[43:57] that went up and he had spent time with
[43:59] brother Colby and they had been able to
[44:01] invest in different things and he had
[44:03] grown his his two talents into four
[44:06] talents he had doubled what he had and
[44:08] then we had Aaron come up and Aaron had
[44:12] had his coin hidden he hadn't never been
[44:14] quite sure what to do or how to invest
[44:16] it and unfortunately Aaron drew the
[44:18] Short Straw of this story and he was the
[44:23] servant that ended up being cast out
[44:25] because he had been faithless he hadn't
[44:28] actually used the talent that God had
[44:30] given him and so brother Robert gave
[44:33] that extra talent to Simi because he had
[44:36] been proven so trustworthy he got in
[44:39] excess he went even Beyond to go here's
[44:41] another talent because I know you
[44:42] already did well with these you can keep
[44:43] working with
[44:45] more I'll take all those back right now
[44:49] thank you brother Robert and thanks to
[44:52] these three gentlemen they are going to
[44:54] get I didn't have dollar with me but
[44:57] they're each going to still get payment
[44:59] for services
[45:01] rendered s you can go back thank you
[45:05] appreciate you
[45:07] guys yes you get some too all right and
[45:13] so we all know this this Parable that
[45:17] that that that Jesus put forth we've all
[45:19] heard it multiple times we've all gone
[45:22] through this about what we're supposed
[45:25] to do
[45:26] with our talents and God has given each
[45:28] one of us talents and and skills and
[45:31] abilities and some are even get blessed
[45:33] to have gifts and callings that are
[45:35] placed on their lives to go this is what
[45:37] you're supposed to do but even if it's
[45:38] not one of the uh what you would call
[45:40] the the the spiritual gifts or things
[45:42] each one has been given talents and
[45:45] skills that are just for them to go this
[45:49] is what you're able to do this is what
[45:52] you are created to do different than
[45:56] anyone else you're given away where you
[45:58] look at the world a little bit different
[46:00] than anyone now maybe maybe the way you
[46:03] look at the world is very similar to
[46:05] certain other brothers or sisters around
[46:07] you but you still look at it through a
[46:09] little bit different lens through a
[46:11] little bit different way because that's
[46:12] how you're created that's what God made
[46:14] you to be and so God has given you these
[46:16] talents that are to be invested that are
[46:19] to be used wisely for his kingdom and we
[46:23] can go through it and I know the the
[46:25] boys probably felt silly as they were up
[46:27] here going through the the motions and
[46:31] Aaron I'm sorry that you got the Short
[46:32] Straw we know that you're not one
[46:34] that'll hide under the bed um and so
[46:37] they each had their talents and they
[46:39] each you know they each had a talent
[46:41] that they were willing to help act out
[46:43] the story for us that they were willing
[46:45] to to step into this I have I have a a
[46:48] daughter that loves to draw she loves to
[46:51] be artistic now I don't know exactly how
[46:54] that is going to develop as she
[46:55] continues to grow I don't know where
[46:57] it's going to go but it's a talent that
[46:59] is in her whether that'll become a
[47:01] talent that becomes really impressive or
[47:06] whether it just stays something where
[47:07] she likes to Doodle or she likes to draw
[47:10] in the borders of her book or likes to
[47:12] do these different things that's between
[47:15] her and God to figure out but she has a
[47:18] talent she has a desire to do certain
[47:20] things brother Colby has a talent when
[47:23] it comes to being a musician he has a
[47:26] talent when it comes to worship he has a
[47:28] talent in what he's able to offer in
[47:31] these things and he then is going to be
[47:33] responsible for that talent and each one
[47:36] of it has these talents that are in our
[47:38] lives even when we feel like well I
[47:40] don't have any talents I'm not a singer
[47:43] I'm not a worship leader I'm not a
[47:45] musician I'm not a minister I'm not a
[47:49] run right down and you go I have no
[47:51] talents I don't know what to do I'm not
[47:55] the person that is ever going to be up
[47:57] in front and being lauded for everything
[48:01] that I'm able to do or my
[48:03] ability you know I saw sister Carol
[48:06] raise her hand as I started talking
[48:08] about that and I'll be the first one I
[48:10] think most of us have talked about this
[48:11] before that sister Carol has the talent
[48:15] to just get in and
[48:19] work especially in today's society that
[48:22] is a talent to have somebody that will
[48:24] just get in and get done and just try to
[48:27] do things and try to serve those around
[48:30] her that is a talent that is a talent
[48:32] that she has developed over time and
[48:35] grown and worked with I work with lots
[48:38] of teenagers I've seen plenty that don't
[48:40] have that Talent it's a talent that she
[48:43] has worked with and each one of us has a
[48:45] talent there are certain people in here
[48:47] I'm sure that are true prayer warriors
[48:49] that can go in and they can
[48:52] spend hours in prayer before the
[48:56] Lord I don't have that
[48:59] talent I can
[49:01] pray but I am not a person that easily
[49:04] slips into that kind of thing I am not a
[49:06] person that easily presses into that
[49:09] type that is not the gift that was
[49:12] placed in me that is not the gift or the
[49:14] talent that was given to me but there
[49:16] are those that have that kind of talent
[49:18] there are those that that have a talent
[49:22] to reach out to their brothers and
[49:24] sisters around them and maybe they're
[49:26] like hey I'm good at sending a text to
[49:28] people I'm good at just sending a quick
[49:30] message to be like hey I missed you at
[49:32] church hey I haven't T I'm sorry I was
[49:35] busy I didn't get a chance to talk to
[49:36] you on Sunday but I just want you to
[49:38] know that I'm thinking about you that
[49:40] I'm praying for you there are different
[49:42] ones that have things that you might not
[49:45] even classify as a talent but to God
[49:49] he's given them this ability he's given
[49:50] them this talent that this is what
[49:53] you're supposed to do this is what I'm
[49:55] call calling you to do with
[49:58] it brother brandom said in the sermon
[50:00] Watchman what of the night he says yours
[50:03] ago there was a writer Fanny Crosby she
[50:06] was blind she didn't sell her Birthright
[50:08] like many fine singers today in the
[50:10] television of movie World sold out their
[50:12] Birthright for just a few Boogie wogie
[50:15] songs or rock and roll but miss Crosby
[50:17] was a different woman they come to her
[50:19] one day and said why don't you write
[50:21] modern poetry why don't you write songs
[50:23] for the entertainment world she said I
[50:25] give all my talents to God so well you
[50:28] believe there'll be a heaven then saides
[50:30] said you think you'll be there she yes
[50:34] said now what when you get there if you
[50:35] remain blind how will you know him she
[50:37] said I'll feel the nail scar in his
[50:39] hands she turned went walking back
[50:41] walking back in the room and when she
[50:43] did she raised her hands and began to
[50:45] praise God when they walked Outdoors the
[50:48] song strucked her she said I shall know
[50:49] him I shall know him and Redeemed by his
[50:51] side I shall stand I shall know him I
[50:54] shall know him by the the prince of the
[50:56] nails in his hands and today brother and
[50:58] sister she's walking on the streets of
[50:59] Glory with a far better sight than
[51:02] anybody on this Earth ever had she sees
[51:04] him knows him and standing Redeemed by
[51:06] his side oh if ID asked her tonight
[51:08] Fanny Crosby what does Christ mean to
[51:10] you she'd sing this song for me she
[51:12] something like this see one of her
[51:13] famous old songs I was thinking of a
[51:15] while ago she said nothing in this world
[51:17] I have all is in him what was that song
[51:19] now I was thinking a few minutes ago
[51:21] that she sing that was such a beautiful
[51:23] song however I remember singing I'll
[51:25] think of it in a few minutes that she
[51:26] said he means more than this world to me
[51:29] whom have I on Earth beside thee whom in
[51:31] heaven but thee pass me not oh gentle
[51:33] Savi hear my humble cry while on others
[51:35] Thou Art calling do not pass me
[51:38] by what would it mean to you and I who
[51:41] can work and labor and serve the Lord
[51:43] Jesus in the way that we do God bless
[51:46] you I remember my mom talking we used to
[51:50] when I was younger we would get these uh
[51:52] books that would be um the
[51:56] biographies of famous Christians and my
[52:00] mom and and I read the one about Fanny
[52:03] crossby
[52:05] and I remember talking with my mom about
[52:07] it and she was like it was super in
[52:10] interesting for the first half and the
[52:14] last half was ju just kept saying
[52:16] basically over and over and Fanny Crosby
[52:19] got with this publishing company and she
[52:21] wrote this song and this song and this
[52:22] song and this song and this song and
[52:24] this song and this song and this song
[52:25] and then she left that publishing
[52:27] company and she went to this publishing
[52:28] company and she wrote this song and this
[52:30] song and this she wrote a lot of
[52:33] songs but there wasn't anything like
[52:36] amazing and dramatic at the end of her
[52:39] life that would be exciting to read
[52:40] about because she had surrendered her
[52:42] all to Christ it was just I'm going to
[52:44] keep writing songs I'm going to keep
[52:45] surrendering my gift and so if you
[52:48] looked at it from the worldly standards
[52:49] it wasn't an exciting end to her life it
[52:52] was just she wrote song after song after
[52:56] song after song they kept going and she
[53:01] kept writing because she kept
[53:03] surrendering her Talent she kept giving
[53:06] her gift to the Lord and the Lord kept
[53:09] using it and it didn't bring her in
[53:12] millions of dollars it didn't make her
[53:14] wealthy it didn't do any of those things
[53:16] but she had this talent that she didn't
[53:18] stop even at the end towards the end of
[53:21] her life she continued writing she
[53:23] continued writing and when a publishing
[53:25] company didn't want to use her anymore
[53:27] she would go to somebody else because
[53:29] she had more to write she was still
[53:31] being inspired she had more that was
[53:33] going she wasn't going to these
[53:35] different publishing companies because I
[53:36] can get a better contract there I can
[53:38] make more money there she was just going
[53:40] someplace that would let her publish
[53:43] what she had that would let her publish
[53:46] what was coming from her heart because
[53:48] that was the talent that God had put
[53:50] there that was what God had inspired her
[53:53] to do that's what God had called her to
[53:54] do and no it didn't make for an exciting
[53:59] biography but it's going to be
[54:02] considered valuable on the other side
[54:05] it's going to be held up as this is
[54:07] somebody who used her gift correctly
[54:09] this is somebody who used her Talent
[54:11] correctly and maybe she didn't receive a
[54:13] ton of accolades on this side but on
[54:15] that side she has on that side she did
[54:18] because she surrendered it
[54:24] all
[54:29] brother brandham was talking the sermon
[54:33] earnestly contending for the
[54:35] faith and he said now hearing this our
[54:39] brother on those birds like that that is
[54:41] a spiritual gift try to impersonate it
[54:43] once see how you get along God has given
[54:46] that to the brother I heard this young
[54:48] man singing that song yielded Lord to
[54:50] thee and how that brother Cobble sitting
[54:52] there told me he just converted out of a
[54:54] nightclub he and his wife and how that's
[54:56] singing try to impersonate that it's a
[54:59] gift it comes from God now the gift was
[55:01] in him when he was born the gift was in
[55:03] the other man when he was born but what
[55:05] they use it for what goes every man will
[55:08] have to answer for his
[55:10] talent God gives men talent and they
[55:13] have to use it some can preach like a
[55:15] house on fire and the other different
[55:17] things but God requires these talents
[55:19] and I'm so thankful to know that these
[55:20] two Brethren sitting back here have
[55:22] yielded their talents which they could
[55:24] be out here in a nightclub and
[55:25] everything else using those talents but
[55:27] they surrendered them to the Lord Jesus
[55:29] Christ to win souls and I'm happy for
[55:31] this this morning and my brethren may
[55:33] the Lord ever continue the little
[55:35] brother here the song leader brother
[55:36] cell many others here God has given you
[55:38] Talent maybe you say well brother
[55:40] brandom he hasn't given me nothing you
[55:42] don't know maybe see you just go to try
[55:45] something maybe you've never went and
[55:46] testified to somebody try that everybody
[55:49] can't do that maybe you can't something
[55:52] else that you could do there's something
[55:53] you can do that you can put it to God
[55:56] but now the thing you have to do do what
[55:58] the brother singing his song yield the
[56:01] man who could whistle and impersonate
[56:02] little birds that I ever heard well then
[56:04] that man yielded himself to it give into
[56:06] it the man who could sing he yielded
[56:08] himself he give into it now for these
[56:10] things here of the gospel and the
[56:11] manifestation of Visions I just yield
[56:14] myself and give into it and that's what
[56:16] does it see it's not me it's him and
[56:18] it's something that you can't help the
[56:20] man can't help because he was born to
[56:22] whistle like birds why he's just bornn
[56:24] that way the man that sang was the same
[56:26] way and to see Visions is just common to
[56:28] me as it is to them to do that you see
[56:31] what I mean it's all together it's for
[56:33] one edification of the glory of Jesus
[56:36] Christ the son of
[56:39] God each one of us has talents and often
[56:42] these talents are not what we would
[56:45] consider to be
[56:47] talents when you if you tried to ask the
[56:49] world okay what talent does this person
[56:52] have or what talent does that person
[56:53] have a a lot of people they'd look at
[56:55] and go oh they don't have
[56:58] talents they can't they can't do
[57:00] anything really worthwhile it's
[57:02] like they're just a whatever they just
[57:05] have this they just have that but yet
[57:07] God has created each one of us
[57:09] especially to have a talent each one of
[57:12] us to have what I truly believe is every
[57:15] one of us has multiple
[57:18] talents we're not just gifted in one
[57:21] single area we all have multiple things
[57:24] that God has created us to be able to do
[57:27] now I may not be able
[57:30] to sing so well that I can go out and
[57:33] get a record deal and I can be somebody
[57:36] that can do this or do that but God has
[57:39] still called me to use the voice that he
[57:41] did give
[57:43] me I may not be able to as I've started
[57:46] learning to play a guitar I may not be
[57:48] able to play a guitar close to anything
[57:50] anyone else in the congregation can do I
[57:52] may not be able to play a guitar that
[57:54] would ever get get me on any type of
[57:56] record or anything like that but God's
[57:59] called me to use what he's given me
[58:02] however small or large it may be whether
[58:05] it's I was given the one Talent or
[58:07] whether it's I was given the five
[58:09] talents we're called to use it we're
[58:12] called to use however God has brought it
[58:15] to us whatever is within us however
[58:18] strong or powerful it may be when I was
[58:21] talking about my daughter enjoying to
[58:23] draw and be artistic she may never be
[58:27] able to make a drawing that would sell
[58:30] and make
[58:30] money she may not have that level of
[58:34] talent but she's called to use the
[58:37] talent that she has if the best she can
[58:39] do is make a nice picture that she gives
[58:42] to a friend on a bad day that makes that
[58:44] person feel a little bit better then
[58:46] that's what she's responsible to do God
[58:49] calls us to use the talents at the level
[58:52] that we're
[58:53] given if one of the sisters is good at
[58:58] baking and you enjoy it and something
[59:00] that you go
[59:02] into you're not good enough that you
[59:04] want to sell it or anything like that
[59:05] but you like to give it to someone else
[59:07] in the church occasionally you like to
[59:09] provide a little encouragement do this
[59:11] do
[59:12] that it's a talent that you're using and
[59:16] so each one of us has I truly believe
[59:19] multiple talents God didn't create you
[59:20] with you're a one andone this is the
[59:23] only thing you were created for
[59:25] this is the only reason you have to live
[59:27] is this one thing God doesn't make us
[59:30] that
[59:32] singular God has made us with so many
[59:35] facets and so many differences within
[59:37] our lives and God is calling us to use
[59:39] each one of those to the best of our
[59:42] ability to use those talents to be like
[59:44] the man with the five talents and I'm
[59:47] not even sure that five is a good number
[59:49] most of us probably go above five if you
[59:51] start to cover
[59:53] everything you you know everyone that's
[59:55] a parent God has given you a talent to
[59:58] raise your children on to raise your
[1:00:02] children
[1:00:05] specifically and for every mom here God
[1:00:08] has equipped you to raise your children
[1:00:11] even if you feel like you don't know
[1:00:13] what you're doing even when you feel
[1:00:15] like you have no clue how to handle the
[1:00:17] situation for every dad God has equipped
[1:00:20] us to raise our children now I'm not
[1:00:23] equipped to raise brother col's kids
[1:00:25] those are not my kids I am not equipped
[1:00:28] to raise them I'm called to raise my
[1:00:30] kids yes sir even when I don't know what
[1:00:33] I'm doing and I have no clue God is
[1:00:36] there to equip us and has given us that
[1:00:39] skill that talent to raise our
[1:00:43] children God has given us what we need
[1:00:46] for the situations that are coming
[1:00:48] through and we're then responsible to
[1:00:50] use that talent and that
[1:00:53] ability true you know when brother
[1:00:54] Wendell talks about getting his sons to
[1:00:57] be business owners and brother Colby
[1:01:00] running the electric business and these
[1:01:01] different things like he has been given
[1:01:04] skills and abilities and talents to go
[1:01:07] into that now he may never be called to
[1:01:10] be a multi-millionaire business
[1:01:13] owner God may not have equipped him to
[1:01:15] hit that level but God has given him a
[1:01:18] talent up to a certain point and he is
[1:01:20] responsible to use his talents up to
[1:01:23] that level for the told me I'm sorry I'm
[1:01:25] picking on you tonight but he is he's
[1:01:27] called to use what he's been given and
[1:01:29] what he's equipped
[1:01:31] with I've worked at Chick-fil-A for
[1:01:34] years I've been in the the business at
[1:01:37] different restaurants for years and I
[1:01:39] have certain talents and certain
[1:01:41] abilities that have come out over time
[1:01:44] which I then use within the restaurant
[1:01:46] and the role that I'm
[1:01:47] in I'm not responsible to go out and own
[1:01:52] my own restaurant at this time
[1:01:55] that's not what God has impressed on me
[1:01:57] to do that's what not God has pushed me
[1:01:59] so at the moment I don't know that he's
[1:02:01] equipped me to be in that place which is
[1:02:03] fine if that's not what I'm called to do
[1:02:06] I'm called to work where I'm at with the
[1:02:08] talents and abilities that he's given
[1:02:11] me we can look at the same thing when
[1:02:13] we're looking at you know the ministers
[1:02:17] I'm not called to preach in the same way
[1:02:18] that brother William does I'm not called
[1:02:21] to preach in the same way that brother
[1:02:22] Wendell does I don't have have that type
[1:02:25] of ability that type of talent it's not
[1:02:28] put in me I'm called to be who I am I'm
[1:02:31] called to minister the way that I do I'm
[1:02:33] called to speak the way that I do and
[1:02:35] it's different and that's
[1:02:39] okay I may not be called to travel all
[1:02:41] over the place and you know be like
[1:02:43] brother Josh being gone from home for a
[1:02:45] month traveling because he's ministering
[1:02:47] everywhere or like my father-in-law
[1:02:49] Brother David that travels every other
[1:02:51] every weekend or every other weekend and
[1:02:53] is all over the place
[1:02:55] and that's fine I don't want that
[1:02:56] calling I like being home they're
[1:02:59] welcome to
[1:03:00] travel but God has placed different
[1:03:02] callings and different talents on each
[1:03:09] one brother brandom said in the sermon
[1:03:12] conferences and he said that's why we
[1:03:14] have so much tomat today on the radio
[1:03:16] and television of men like men who has
[1:03:19] got talents singers like Ernie Ford and
[1:03:21] Elvis Presley those boys who is selling
[1:03:23] out their birth rights for a mess of
[1:03:25] pottage they get out there and all you
[1:03:26] have to do is be a jok stir or turn some
[1:03:29] crack or something like that to make the
[1:03:30] American public laugh when you know
[1:03:32] you're only trying to quieten them and
[1:03:34] you know behind it all we know that
[1:03:36] judgment is at hand that's right might
[1:03:38] as well face it we're at the end of the
[1:03:39] road Brethren and all the Ernie Ford
[1:03:41] jokes and the Elvis Presley rock and
[1:03:43] rolls and all this stuff it's another
[1:03:44] Nebuchadnezzar's Feast it won't do a bit
[1:03:47] of good judgment is going to
[1:03:50] strike brother random says in the sermon
[1:03:52] three kinds of believers
[1:03:54] he says' but they sell out like Judas
[1:03:56] that's the make believer some of them
[1:03:58] are highly talented people and this make
[1:04:01] believer watch that guy that's the
[1:04:02] shrewd guy this little guy that fills up
[1:04:04] quick and jumps up and runs out every
[1:04:06] little phrase that he don't like you
[1:04:08] don't pay no attention to
[1:04:13] him he's just an unbeliever to begin
[1:04:15] with but when you see this guy a make
[1:04:18] believer hangs on see that's the Judas
[1:04:21] that's him like great talents I'm going
[1:04:23] to call names here which I really
[1:04:24] shouldn't do it but I'm going to call
[1:04:25] them anyhow so that you'll know like
[1:04:26] Elvis Presley Red Foley Ernie Ford Pat
[1:04:29] boom Elvis Presley a Pentecostal Pat
[1:04:32] Boon a Church of Christ Red Foley a
[1:04:34] deacon in the Church of Christ and I
[1:04:36] think erus Ford is Methodist and all
[1:04:38] those people with those talents smart
[1:04:40] out on television people saying well
[1:04:42] aren't they religious they sing songs
[1:04:44] that don't mean one thing yes sir
[1:04:46] deceiving the world what do they get out
[1:04:48] of it Judas got 30 pieces of silver
[1:04:51] Elvis a fleet of Cadillacs and 100 or
[1:04:53] two 100 50 million or a million dollar
[1:04:55] on records and things like that Pat Boon
[1:04:57] and the rest of them I don't care what
[1:04:58] church they belong to and everything
[1:05:00] it's hypocrisy it's a makeb believe it's
[1:05:02] a front that their life proves it that
[1:05:04] isn't right then there are those with
[1:05:06] the talents that is a great organizer
[1:05:08] worldly Vision they preach the gospel
[1:05:10] claim to Smart men intellectuals listen
[1:05:13] a man that's trained in that field he is
[1:05:14] not a preacher he's a lecturer that's
[1:05:16] what the trouble today we have lectures
[1:05:18] Jesus never said go and train to do this
[1:05:21] he said go preach the gospel and these
[1:05:23] signs shall follow the preaching see
[1:05:26] that's not to learn to make a lecturer
[1:05:28] who can stand and just mind put them
[1:05:29] flowery things in make you feel like
[1:05:31] you're sitting right in the presence of
[1:05:32] an archangel that isn't it having forms
[1:05:35] of godliness you see that's a lecturer
[1:05:37] not the Holy Spirit In Action some
[1:05:39] little fellow that wouldn't know as ABCs
[1:05:41] might come down with the power of Faith
[1:05:42] with the word and make the Holy Spirit
[1:05:44] do
[1:05:45] things that that man knows nothing about
[1:05:48] and deny it see there you are great
[1:05:50] people yes sir then they are organizers
[1:05:53] they are prosperous successful Smart in
[1:05:56] worldly wisdom that's
[1:05:58] right let's turn to Revelations chap
[1:06:18] 3 Revelations chapter
[1:06:21] 3 very s familiar scripture we'll start
[1:06:24] at verse
[1:06:27] 14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[1:06:29] the leodan write these things sayith the
[1:06:33] amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:06:35] beginning of the creation of God I know
[1:06:38] thy Work thy works that thou art neither
[1:06:40] cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot
[1:06:44] so then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[1:06:46] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[1:06:48] out of my mouth because thou sayest I am
[1:06:51] rich and increased with goods and have
[1:06:53] need of nothing
[1:06:54] and knowest not that thou art wretched
[1:06:56] and miserable and poor and blind and
[1:06:58] naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:07:01] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:07:03] rich in white rment thou mayest be
[1:07:05] clothed that the shame of thy nakedness
[1:07:07] do not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:07:09] isav that thou mayest see as many as I
[1:07:11] love I rebuke and chasten be zealous
[1:07:13] therefore and repent behold I stand at
[1:07:16] the door and knock If any man hear my
[1:07:18] voice and open the door I will come into
[1:07:20] him and will suck with him and he with
[1:07:21] me to him that overcometh will I Grant
[1:07:24] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[1:07:26] also overcame and am set down with my
[1:07:29] father in his throne he that hath an ear
[1:07:31] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:07:34] the
[1:07:39] churches there's a story that I remember
[1:07:42] hearing over the years it's not anything
[1:07:45] that brother brandham told this is just
[1:07:46] a a story that different ministers have
[1:07:49] said over time or different ones have
[1:07:52] have spoken about
[1:07:55] but there was an incredibly large group
[1:07:58] of people
[1:07:59] assembled on one side of the group stood
[1:08:03] a
[1:08:04] man
[1:08:05] Jesus on the other side of the group
[1:08:08] stood
[1:08:09] another
[1:08:10] Satan separating them running through
[1:08:13] the group was off
[1:08:17] fence both Jesus and Satan began calling
[1:08:20] the people in the group and one by one
[1:08:22] each having made up his or her mind each
[1:08:24] went to either Jesus or
[1:08:28] Satan this kept going on and eventually
[1:08:32] Jesus had gathered around him a group of
[1:08:33] people from the larger crowds as had
[1:08:36] Satan but one man joined neither group
[1:08:38] he climbed the fence that was there and
[1:08:40] just sat on it then Jesus and his people
[1:08:43] left and disappeared and so too did
[1:08:45] Satan and his people and the man was
[1:08:48] left sitting there on the fence all
[1:08:50] alone and then Satan came back
[1:08:54] walking back into the scene looking
[1:08:56] around like he had lost
[1:08:57] something the man on the fence said are
[1:09:01] you looking for something or did you
[1:09:02] lose something and Satan looked at and
[1:09:04] was like nope you're right there come on
[1:09:07] the man on the fence said I didn't
[1:09:10] choose either side I stayed right here
[1:09:12] and Satan looked at was like yeah but I
[1:09:13] own the fence come with
[1:09:16] me so when we look at
[1:09:19] this to me it fits with the idea of the
[1:09:22] lukewarm that's talked about in
[1:09:24] Revelations of thinking that you can be
[1:09:27] in the middle of the line thinking that
[1:09:28] you can
[1:09:29] go neither side I don't have to be cold
[1:09:32] or hot I'm not fully sold out to Satan
[1:09:36] I'm not fully sold out to God so I'm
[1:09:38] safe right in the middle on the
[1:09:41] fence not realizing that the lukewarm is
[1:09:46] what God spews out to him it's worse
[1:09:50] than the
[1:09:52] cold it's worse than the
[1:09:55] hot but yet that's where so many people
[1:09:57] think they're
[1:10:01] safe kylin I'm going to borrow you for a
[1:10:07] moment so
[1:10:10] I titled this
[1:10:12] sermon the fourth
[1:10:15] servant come on up
[1:10:17] kylin titled this the fourth servant
[1:10:20] because in the story that we all know so
[1:10:22] well Jesus talks about three
[1:10:25] servants you have the two servants that
[1:10:27] go and use all of their talents and you
[1:10:30] have the one servant that doesn't use
[1:10:33] his
[1:10:35] talent and I'm not trying to add to
[1:10:38] scripture so pardon me hopefully you can
[1:10:41] all excuse where we go with this
[1:10:44] but imagine for a moment if we had a
[1:10:47] fourth servant that was called the kylin
[1:10:51] you are our fourth
[1:10:52] servant and he was called in and the
[1:10:55] master went and gave him his talents and
[1:10:57] he was given four
[1:10:59] talents and
[1:11:00] so kylin was thinking about okay what do
[1:11:04] I do to develop these talents what what
[1:11:07] can I do to bring in an
[1:11:12] increase but I don't want to lose
[1:11:15] everything and so what if
[1:11:17] I save two
[1:11:20] behind or one behind and I only use some
[1:11:24] and so he decided that he was going to
[1:11:26] go spend some time with brother Joe
[1:11:28] Green so go ahead and go over and hang
[1:11:31] out with brother Joe and so he
[1:11:33] went but he wasn't G to give quite
[1:11:38] everything and so he spent some time
[1:11:40] with with brother Joe
[1:11:42] and he worked with the ideas that the
[1:11:46] two came up with and then the the land
[1:11:49] owner came back and the fourth servant
[1:11:52] returned come on back back
[1:11:54] kin to
[1:11:57] show what he had done and so he gives
[1:12:00] back what he was given and His Four
[1:12:03] talents have turned into
[1:12:05] six because he was willing to give up
[1:12:08] two to try to make them better to try to
[1:12:11] use
[1:12:12] them but there was two that he decided
[1:12:15] to hide away because he wasn't sure how
[1:12:17] to use them he wasn't sure if they were
[1:12:18] really talents or
[1:12:20] not maybe he was embarrassed because
[1:12:24] they weren't really good talents you
[1:12:26] know these these were kind of bent they
[1:12:28] had notches cut out of them they had
[1:12:29] different things they weren't they
[1:12:30] weren't pretty talents and so I don't
[1:12:33] really want to surrender those or use
[1:12:36] those thanks for the help
[1:12:39] buddy and
[1:12:41] so I think all too
[1:12:44] often we as Christians fall somewhere
[1:12:46] into that mix where we're more like a
[1:12:49] fourth servant we're not going and
[1:12:53] hiding away all our talents we're not
[1:12:56] refusing to try to serve the Lord we're
[1:12:58] not refusing to give
[1:13:01] him what we
[1:13:03] have we're just not quite sure about
[1:13:06] giving everything come
[1:13:09] ond let's turn to Acts chapter
[1:13:17] 5 and this is kind of where I got the
[1:13:19] idea
[1:13:22] of a fourth
[1:13:24] servant it's a story we all know well
[1:13:27] it's the story of annias and
[1:13:30] saf so Acts chapter 5 starting at verse
[1:13:33] one it says but a certain man named
[1:13:35] ananas with saf his wife sold a
[1:13:39] possession and kept back part of the
[1:13:41] price his wife also being privy to it
[1:13:45] and brought a certain part and laid it
[1:13:46] at the apostles
[1:13:49] feet so the chapter before we're not
[1:13:53] going to read it but just pause for a
[1:13:54] moment people were selling off their
[1:13:56] land and possessions and then were
[1:13:58] giving the money to the apostles to help
[1:14:03] take care of the the church that was
[1:14:04] growing to be able to they would then
[1:14:06] have funds to live off of they would
[1:14:08] have funds to help take care of the
[1:14:09] widows and the orphans and different
[1:14:10] ones they were selling their extra
[1:14:14] possessions they weren't necessarily
[1:14:16] selling the house that they were trying
[1:14:17] to live in CU they still had to live
[1:14:20] somewhere but if a person had extra
[1:14:22] property or had some type of extra
[1:14:24] possession they would sell it and then
[1:14:26] give that to the church give that to the
[1:14:31] apostles and ananas and saf heard about
[1:14:35] this they knew that this was going
[1:14:37] on and they
[1:14:40] decided that they would look bad if they
[1:14:43] sold their property and didn't give
[1:14:46] money to the
[1:14:47] church but they didn't want to give it
[1:14:49] all I mean they had worked this they had
[1:14:52] earned this this was their their
[1:14:54] money they wanted to keep some of it
[1:14:56] they didn't want to surrender everything
[1:14:57] or give everything
[1:15:02] away and sometimes this is one of those
[1:15:04] where you go
[1:15:05] into what's not said or what's in
[1:15:08] between the lines as brother Brandon
[1:15:10] would talk about in
[1:15:11] scripture I think if ananas had come to
[1:15:14] Peter up front and said hey I'm going to
[1:15:16] give you half the money because I'm
[1:15:18] keeping the other half for me there
[1:15:20] would have been no
[1:15:22] problems
[1:15:24] Peter would have been like thank you we
[1:15:26] appreciate you giving to the church
[1:15:30] Peter wouldn't have yelled at him for
[1:15:31] not giving the whole amount if he
[1:15:33] admitted it right up front but ananas
[1:15:37] wanted to look as holy as everybody else
[1:15:39] he wanted to look as good as everyone
[1:15:42] else and so he comes
[1:15:44] in and puts it down and I don't know
[1:15:47] whether it's just no explanation let me
[1:15:49] put it down and just let everyone think
[1:15:51] what they will or whether it's he
[1:15:53] actually spoke and said here's the money
[1:15:55] from my sale of the
[1:15:57] property scripture doesn't say
[1:15:59] specifically how he did that part you
[1:16:01] can imagine it in your own mind but that
[1:16:04] was what the message came across as the
[1:16:06] message came across that this is
[1:16:11] everything and starting at verse three
[1:16:13] it says but Peter said ananas why hath
[1:16:15] Satan filled thine heart to lie to the
[1:16:17] Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the
[1:16:19] price of the land whilst it remained was
[1:16:22] it not thine own and after it sold was
[1:16:24] it not in thine own power why hast thou
[1:16:27] conceived this thing in thine heart thou
[1:16:29] Hast not lied unto men but unto God and
[1:16:32] ananas hearing these words fell down and
[1:16:34] gave up The Ghost and great fear came on
[1:16:36] all them that heard these things and the
[1:16:38] young man arose wound him up and carried
[1:16:41] him out and buried
[1:16:43] him now we often talk about ananas
[1:16:46] ananas and Safara to show that God knows
[1:16:49] the secrets of our hearts God knows
[1:16:51] exactly what we're doing
[1:16:54] even when we think we're doing things in
[1:16:57] secret but I want to look at this from
[1:16:59] that other angle for a moment because I
[1:17:02] think sometimes we can begin to fall
[1:17:04] into that idea of being like
[1:17:09] ananas to where we go these are my
[1:17:13] talents I'm going to give these two
[1:17:16] up I'll give this Talent OR these
[1:17:20] talents or I'll give these to God to use
[1:17:24] but I I'm not ready to give up these
[1:17:28] talents like I said whether that could
[1:17:30] be because we're embarrassed because
[1:17:32] maybe it's something we don't really
[1:17:33] think is a talent we don't think it's
[1:17:35] worth anything so why would we give it
[1:17:37] to God if it's
[1:17:39] worthless maybe it's something that we
[1:17:42] just feel like we don't have time to do
[1:17:46] I don't know we can go through all kinds
[1:17:47] of reasons of why we wouldn't give the
[1:17:50] talent to God and not necessarily all
[1:17:53] the reasons are that man I want to use
[1:17:54] this for my own gain and my own
[1:17:56] Improvement I want it to be all about me
[1:17:59] not about
[1:18:01] God but we can get up caught up into so
[1:18:04] many silly reasons to go why God would
[1:18:09] never use
[1:18:11] this this isn't worth anything it's not
[1:18:15] valuable like I said when I described I
[1:18:18] keep I feel like I keep going back to my
[1:18:20] daughter again but when I talk about her
[1:18:22] wanting to be artistic she may never
[1:18:25] have a talent to sell a thing she may
[1:18:28] never have a talent that almost anyone
[1:18:31] else would look at and go yes that's a
[1:18:34] talent of being
[1:18:36] artistic and so maybe because that she
[1:18:38] decides well I'm going to I'm going to
[1:18:40] be that one that is the light hidden
[1:18:42] under a bushel I'm going to be that one
[1:18:44] that I I hide it away because it's not
[1:18:47] valuable it's not
[1:18:49] important but yet God's calling her to
[1:18:51] use that for him to use it for his
[1:18:55] kingdom to use it in some way for him
[1:18:58] when brother Brandon was talking about
[1:19:00] those that have talents and he said have
[1:19:02] you tried testifying to someone because
[1:19:04] not everybody
[1:19:06] can I had never caught that till I was
[1:19:08] going through those quotes and I was
[1:19:09] like wait brother brandham said not
[1:19:12] everybody can
[1:19:13] testify I thought that was like the most
[1:19:15] base thing everyone of us could do and
[1:19:18] in a way all of us can but some people
[1:19:22] have a talent to testify and connect to
[1:19:25] people far better than some of the
[1:19:27] others that you know to use the phrase
[1:19:29] there's some that go in that it's almost
[1:19:31] like the bull in the China shot thing
[1:19:33] you know you're going to hit people over
[1:19:34] the head with a 2x4 to try to get them
[1:19:35] to accept Christ and then you've got
[1:19:38] some that come in and and you know when
[1:19:41] brother brandom I love the story where
[1:19:43] he talks about he was going hunting and
[1:19:47] he was with another brother and they
[1:19:49] went to ask this Old Gentleman if they
[1:19:52] could hunt on his property yeah and he
[1:19:55] just starts talking to him about his
[1:19:57] apple tree and starts talking to him
[1:19:59] about uh you know can I have an apple
[1:20:01] well yeah Hornets are eating them you
[1:20:03] may as well have one um and then talking
[1:20:05] to about how old the apple tree and well
[1:20:07] you know the leaves are starting to fall
[1:20:08] off well yeah it's about Autumn this is
[1:20:10] this is normal and going through all
[1:20:12] these different
[1:20:13] things and just talking to him talking
[1:20:16] to him talking to him and he never beat
[1:20:19] him over the head with you need to
[1:20:21] accept Christ come on
[1:20:23] but the way brother brandom said is you
[1:20:25] give them you give that cow enough rope
[1:20:28] and it'll hang itself and so he just
[1:20:31] kept kept feeding it out kept feeding it
[1:20:33] out until finally the man had to admit
[1:20:38] well there's some intelligence that is
[1:20:40] telling that te that tree that the sap
[1:20:42] should go down to the
[1:20:43] roots and it's
[1:20:46] not as brother brandom said you can't
[1:20:48] just put a bucket of water on a wooden
[1:20:49] post and the water run down and it'll
[1:20:51] come back up
[1:20:53] so it's not just nature telling it to do
[1:21:00] this now when I read that I'll be the
[1:21:05] first one to say that I look at that and
[1:21:08] I go wow I don't know if I could testify
[1:21:10] to somebody that way yeah come on now I
[1:21:14] know brother Brandon was a prophet I
[1:21:17] accept that but he also had a talent for
[1:21:20] connecting to people yes had the gift of
[1:21:23] the prophetic gift but he also had the
[1:21:25] way God designed him he could connect to
[1:21:27] someone and he knew the right approach
[1:21:30] to take he didn't come in talking to
[1:21:32] this guy about
[1:21:36] cars he was an old farmer so here let's
[1:21:39] talk about the apple tree let's talk
[1:21:42] about what's growing here let's talk
[1:21:43] about what's
[1:21:46] natural there are some of those that
[1:21:48] some of us that have that talent that we
[1:21:51] can testify and we can connect to people
[1:21:55] and lead them to Christ in a way that
[1:21:59] others can't because others are the ones
[1:22:01] wielding the 2x4 to hit people over the
[1:22:03] head now there are people out in the
[1:22:05] world that need a 2x4 over the head we
[1:22:08] understand that and so all of us can
[1:22:11] testify but the 2x4 doesn't work for
[1:22:14] most people there like one in a million
[1:22:16] out there that needs the
[1:22:17] 2x4 you need to have that other people
[1:22:20] have that Talent where they can connect
[1:22:22] to a person
[1:22:23] and they can begin to tell them how the
[1:22:25] gospel relates to their
[1:22:28] life and those are
[1:22:32] talents and those are talents that we
[1:22:34] might not think of as talents until
[1:22:36] brother Branham mentioned it and said
[1:22:39] have you tried testifying if you don't
[1:22:41] think you have a
[1:22:43] talent before I read the quote how many
[1:22:45] in here thought testifying is a
[1:22:51] talent okay I I got a couple hands but
[1:22:54] not many that wasn't something that most
[1:22:57] of us immediately categorized yes that's
[1:22:59] a special talent that God gave somebody
[1:23:01] is to be able to
[1:23:03] testify now if I asked who many thought
[1:23:06] how many think singing is a talent I'm
[1:23:08] gonna get a lot more hands because
[1:23:10] everybody immedately goes oh yeah that's
[1:23:12] that's a talent that is a true
[1:23:15] Talent so God gives each one of us
[1:23:17] talents and a lot of times they can be
[1:23:19] that talent that is not recognized that
[1:23:22] is not
[1:23:24] identified and all too often it's too
[1:23:26] easy for us to become the fourth servant
[1:23:30] that we're willing to surrender
[1:23:34] some but I don't want him to come back
[1:23:36] and find me with nothing so let's Hide
[1:23:38] Away these talents so part of me is like
[1:23:41] the servant with only one
[1:23:43] talent because in your mind you're still
[1:23:45] thinking well you know he's the master
[1:23:47] that he reaps where he did not seow and
[1:23:50] he does all these different things and I
[1:23:52] got I can't come in empty-handed I have
[1:23:54] to have something to offer so I'll risk
[1:23:57] these two if I get increased great but
[1:23:59] if I lose them I've still got two to
[1:24:02] give back at least I'm not giving him
[1:24:08] nothing it's all too easy for us to slip
[1:24:10] into that kind of mindset to slip into
[1:24:12] the mindset of being the fourth servant
[1:24:15] where I'm not only hiding the only
[1:24:19] talent I have I'm not refusing to give
[1:24:21] God anything
[1:24:24] but I am refusing to give him
[1:24:26] everything for whatever reason it may
[1:24:29] be whether it be completely selfish I
[1:24:33] want this to be all about me or whether
[1:24:35] it be something more silly where it's
[1:24:37] like I'm embarrassed by this I'm afraid
[1:24:41] people may laugh at me if I tell them I
[1:24:43] have a talent in modeling with
[1:24:51] Play-Doh
[1:24:54] think about whatever it might be but you
[1:24:56] can become embarrassed to go well that's
[1:24:58] not I mean that's not singing That's not
[1:25:00] playing the piano or playing guitar or
[1:25:03] being up in front where everybody looks
[1:25:05] at
[1:25:06] you it's not even the one that every
[1:25:09] Christian will acknowledge is so amazing
[1:25:11] to be a prayer
[1:25:13] Warrior I mean we know that was in the
[1:25:15] background but every person knows prayer
[1:25:18] Warrior that is a high
[1:25:20] calling that is something
[1:25:24] special and my talent isn't that so
[1:25:27] would God even want it is it not that
[1:25:30] important is it something that doesn't
[1:25:41] matter sometimes we begin to fall into
[1:25:43] the
[1:25:44] mindset of that
[1:25:47] fourth servant
[1:25:50] because we're getting tired
[1:25:54] because we've been doing something for
[1:25:55] so
[1:25:57] long that we're just getting worn
[1:26:01] out Galatians chapter 6 verse 9 says and
[1:26:06] let us not be weary in welld doing for
[1:26:08] in due season we shall reap if we faint
[1:26:11] not as we have therefore opportunity let
[1:26:14] us do good unto all men especially unto
[1:26:16] them who are of the household of
[1:26:18] faith in 2 Thessalonians chapter 3 and
[1:26:22] verse
[1:26:24] 13 it says but ye Brethren be not weary
[1:26:28] in well-doing
[1:26:34] if you've been doing something for a
[1:26:36] while you've had a talent that you've
[1:26:38] surrendered to God for quite some time
[1:26:41] you can begin to get tired you can begin
[1:26:44] to get worn out and begin to want to
[1:26:45] move into the mindset of that fourth
[1:26:47] servant to go God I just want this back
[1:26:50] I can't use it now I'm just I've poured
[1:26:53] out everything I don't have anything
[1:26:55] else to
[1:26:56] give brother Merl's been leading songs
[1:26:59] for years he's been leading worship for
[1:27:02] years and I'm sure there have been times
[1:27:04] I don't know if he's in this place right
[1:27:05] now but I'm sure at some point there
[1:27:07] have been times where he went I'm tired
[1:27:10] I don't want to do this
[1:27:12] anymore brother Colby and Sister Mary
[1:27:14] have been leading the teenage youth
[1:27:16] group for quite some time and I'm sure
[1:27:20] there are weeks where they're kind of
[1:27:22] tired of giving up their Tuesday
[1:27:25] night to go be with our teenagers I have
[1:27:29] one in the class so I understand I give
[1:27:32] mine over
[1:27:34] too but I'm sure there are times where
[1:27:36] they're like we'd like our Tuesday night
[1:27:37] to ourselves we'd like our Tuesday night
[1:27:40] either with our kids or just the two of
[1:27:42] us getting to get
[1:27:44] away they have both been playing
[1:27:47] instruments and being part of worship
[1:27:49] here at the church for
[1:27:51] years and I'm sure there are times when
[1:27:54] they begin to go I have to get up and
[1:27:56] play the piano
[1:27:58] again I have to lead worship
[1:28:01] again can I just get a week off can I
[1:28:05] just get a month off can I just step
[1:28:10] away and not to say that there is
[1:28:13] anything wrong with taking a vacation or
[1:28:15] taking a
[1:28:17] break but there's a difference between
[1:28:19] going I need a short break to regain
[1:28:23] energy regain strength whatever and
[1:28:26] there's difference between going I will
[1:28:27] never do this again I want my talent
[1:28:31] back I don't want to surrender this to
[1:28:34] God anymore because I'm
[1:28:38] tired we go through seasons of weariness
[1:28:40] we go through Seasons where we're tired
[1:28:43] and we have
[1:28:45] to recuperate and we have to focus on
[1:28:47] all right God I need you to refill me so
[1:28:50] that I can keep pouring out
[1:28:54] right and that's fine for a
[1:28:58] season but to go into the mindset that
[1:29:01] it's so easy to get into to go you know
[1:29:04] I never see anybody
[1:29:07] else joining the team to help mow the
[1:29:09] lawn out here so I'm just tired I'm done
[1:29:13] I never see anybody else coming in to
[1:29:14] clean the church it's always these four
[1:29:18] sisters or these Six Sisters these eight
[1:29:20] sisters or whatever it is I'm done I'm
[1:29:22] tired of always being the one to do it
[1:29:24] always tired of being the person to do
[1:29:26] this role or this
[1:29:30] piece taking a vacation taking a break
[1:29:34] because I need to
[1:29:36] recover because I need to focus on I
[1:29:40] need God to refill me right now you know
[1:29:43] brother kby leads worship there are
[1:29:45] times he needs to step back to get his
[1:29:47] refilling so that he can then pour back
[1:29:49] out because he has to spend
[1:29:52] time and going okay Lord what song
[1:29:54] should I lead brother Merl the same way
[1:29:57] what songs will help set the atmosphere
[1:30:00] what songs will help bring the people
[1:30:04] up and allow the Holy Spirit to come
[1:30:07] down so that the minister is able to
[1:30:10] preach and there's freedom and people
[1:30:13] are willing to
[1:30:15] receive this is not an easy role that
[1:30:18] they have this isn't an easy job
[1:30:23] when you may go well this is one of the
[1:30:24] Glamorous ones they get up in front
[1:30:25] they're in the camera they get to be in
[1:30:26] the Limelight they're up in the
[1:30:28] center but there is a lot of
[1:30:30] responsibility there's a lot of work
[1:30:32] behind the scenes is there in their own
[1:30:35] prayer is there in their own study is
[1:30:37] there in their own time trying to find
[1:30:40] the leading of the Lord for how the
[1:30:42] worship should
[1:30:46] go sometimes we begin sometimes it's
[1:30:48] easy to forget that that is a Ministry
[1:30:50] in it of itself that they may not be up
[1:30:52] here delivering the sermon but they're
[1:30:54] helping to get everything
[1:30:55] set it's the same thing for the
[1:30:57] musicians that surrender that are here
[1:31:01] every service that get here an hour
[1:31:04] early before pretty much anybody else so
[1:31:06] that they can have some time to pray so
[1:31:09] that they can have some time to read
[1:31:10] their Bible before they get up to be
[1:31:13] playing before service to help set the
[1:31:15] atmosphere before the worship even
[1:31:18] begins they can get tired yes they can
[1:31:22] get worn
[1:31:26] out the people that are cleaning the
[1:31:29] church can get tired and worn out the
[1:31:31] sisters that are cooking every Sunday so
[1:31:34] that we can all gather together can get
[1:31:36] tired and worn
[1:31:38] out the brothers that are cleaning and
[1:31:41] working on the out on the yard and
[1:31:44] making sure everything's mowed and
[1:31:45] making sure it's everything trimmed and
[1:31:46] doing all these things can get tired and
[1:31:49] worn
[1:31:50] out the brothers that are doing
[1:31:52] maintenance inside the building can get
[1:31:54] tired of always having to come in and
[1:31:58] deal with this or do touch-ups here or
[1:32:01] do a repair here or do this or do
[1:32:08] that and you begin to get that desire to
[1:32:11] be like the fourth servant and go I want
[1:32:14] to hide that Talent away I don't want it
[1:32:15] to be used
[1:32:16] anymore because I've used it so much
[1:32:19] I've used it so long
[1:32:23] and either you're beginning to feel
[1:32:25] unappreciated or you're beginning to
[1:32:27] feel just empty because you've poured
[1:32:29] out time and time
[1:32:32] again it's easy to fall into that fourth
[1:32:36] servant mindset of well I'll still give
[1:32:39] this to God I will still come in and I
[1:32:42] will still sing and worship as part of
[1:32:45] the congregation I will be happy sitting
[1:32:47] there I will still do this but I won't
[1:32:51] won't do that anymore I will do this but
[1:32:53] I won't do
[1:32:55] that whatever it might be and each one
[1:32:57] of us has different place in our lives
[1:33:00] where we can go and it doesn't even have
[1:33:01] to be about in the
[1:33:04] church are there talents that are we're
[1:33:07] using
[1:33:08] outside as we're rubbing shoulders with
[1:33:10] the world these are talents that we're
[1:33:13] using that are allowing us to minister
[1:33:15] to those around
[1:33:17] us but we're going okay I want to pull
[1:33:19] that back because I'm tired of it I'm
[1:33:23] tired of being known as the guy that is
[1:33:26] always singing worship songs at the
[1:33:29] jobsite the guys keep making fun of me
[1:33:31] so I'm just GNA be quiet I'm not going
[1:33:33] to do anything
[1:33:36] anymore then they'll leave me alone and
[1:33:37] I can just work that's what I'm here for
[1:33:39] I'm just I'm here to
[1:33:45] work each one of us can have our own
[1:33:48] thoughts because each one of us has our
[1:33:50] own talents and the talent that I might
[1:33:53] think about pulling back is not the same
[1:33:56] talent that sister fresa might be going
[1:33:59] well I want to pull that
[1:34:01] back it might not be the same talent
[1:34:03] that brother Joe or brother Ken or
[1:34:05] brother
[1:34:06] Colby because God has created each one
[1:34:08] of us different and has created each one
[1:34:11] of us with our own blending of talents
[1:34:13] to make us who we
[1:34:15] are brother William and sister Sharon
[1:34:17] have their special talents that God has
[1:34:19] created them with and designed them with
[1:34:21] with and God has called them to use
[1:34:23] those
[1:34:24] talents and yes like I said there are
[1:34:27] seasons where you step away because you
[1:34:30] need to recharge you need to
[1:34:32] refill and that's
[1:34:35] okay we all know about how Elijah went
[1:34:38] and was underneath the Juniper Bush and
[1:34:41] was
[1:34:42] sleeping because he just needed to rest
[1:34:45] and God allowed him to sleep fed him
[1:34:48] allowed him to sleep some more fed him
[1:34:50] again and and then had him travel again
[1:34:53] that's
[1:34:54] right there are times we need to be
[1:34:56] under that juner bush and that we need
[1:34:59] to be resting and we need to be
[1:35:04] recovering but Elijah didn't stay hidden
[1:35:07] away and never come out and use his
[1:35:11] callings and talents
[1:35:13] again he went he stepped away and he
[1:35:16] rested he stepped away and did got the
[1:35:19] recovery that he needed and then he went
[1:35:21] back out onto the field because that's
[1:35:23] where he was called to
[1:35:28] go we don't want to be the fourth
[1:35:30] servant because the fourth servant is so
[1:35:32] tempting because we're still involved
[1:35:36] we're straddling that fence where we're
[1:35:38] still using certain talents we're still
[1:35:40] giving certain things to God we're still
[1:35:42] going see Lord I'm still serving
[1:35:45] you and I'm not trying to say that if
[1:35:48] you're in that place that that means
[1:35:50] that you're lost right let's be very
[1:35:53] clear on
[1:35:55] that I'm not saying that you're now like
[1:35:58] ananas and you're going to be thrown out
[1:35:59] and dropped dead right there because you
[1:36:01] only gave
[1:36:03] half but yet God is calling us to
[1:36:06] surrender everything God is calling us
[1:36:07] to give him our
[1:36:10] all and it's tempting to fall into that
[1:36:13] fourth servant
[1:36:15] slot for whatever the reason whether
[1:36:18] it's because we're tired because we're
[1:36:20] embarrassed because were
[1:36:22] upset or because of any other reasons
[1:36:25] that you can think of where you go I
[1:36:27] don't want to give
[1:36:29] this to be
[1:36:32] used I'll serve God I'm using these
[1:36:35] gifts for you Lord I'm doing what you're
[1:36:38] calling me to
[1:36:42] do but I'm not giving up those last two
[1:36:44] talents I'm not giving up that last one
[1:36:46] Talent I'm not giving up those last
[1:36:48] three talents or whatever it might be
[1:36:56] when Jesus tells the story he makes it
[1:36:58] very black and white for us you either
[1:37:00] have a person that's given their all or
[1:37:02] you have somebody that's given
[1:37:04] none but yet too often especially in
[1:37:07] this leoan age we go that lukewarm route
[1:37:11] and go I'll give
[1:37:13] some I'll give this much but I'm not
[1:37:16] going to give it
[1:37:18] all because of these reasons because of
[1:37:21] those reasons because of this
[1:37:24] hurt somebody teased me for that
[1:37:27] talent and so I don't want to get teased
[1:37:31] again somebody made fun of me for that
[1:37:33] and so I don't want to put it back out
[1:37:35] there and get made fun of
[1:37:37] again and yet God's still looking at
[1:37:40] you he's going sister Lona I made you
[1:37:45] special I created you just to be you and
[1:37:48] this is what I put in you and this is
[1:37:51] what what you're supposed to be
[1:37:53] using looked at brother Caleb sitting in
[1:37:56] the back and went brother Caleb these
[1:37:57] are the talents I gave
[1:37:59] you and I'm calling you to use all of
[1:38:02] them not just those two or those three
[1:38:06] but I'm calling you to surrender them
[1:38:08] all and these might be talents that
[1:38:11] never get any type of
[1:38:14] recognition because they're not at that
[1:38:17] skill level or whatever it's like I've
[1:38:19] given you this much artistic ability not
[1:38:22] this much artistic ability I've given
[1:38:24] you this much musical ability not this
[1:38:28] much whatever it may
[1:38:31] be you're just responsible to use the
[1:38:34] talents that you have been given and the
[1:38:36] ability that you have been
[1:38:42] given the three servants are easy to
[1:38:45] understand they were easy to lay
[1:38:48] out the one with five talents you used
[1:38:50] all five five received back the one with
[1:38:53] two talents used all two got back the
[1:38:55] one with one used none and so he lost it
[1:39:02] all but yet it's far too easy and I'm
[1:39:05] preaching it myself as much as anyone to
[1:39:07] use some
[1:39:08] talents and to want to hide others
[1:39:11] away either because we fail to
[1:39:14] surrender or because we're hurt or
[1:39:17] because we just don't see the value in
[1:39:19] it because we don't think it's important
[1:39:21] enough that God would want to use
[1:39:28] it brother brandom said in the sermon
[1:39:31] Investments as the musicians will go
[1:39:33] ahead and
[1:39:35] come he says I'm showing you a real
[1:39:37] investment to make put your life your
[1:39:40] time your money your talent put
[1:39:42] everything you got in Christ God
[1:39:45] guaranteed this to us by raising him
[1:39:47] again we'll rise in the last day he
[1:39:49] promised what more could you look
[1:39:51] forward to tell me any investment you
[1:39:53] could make would pay off like that tell
[1:39:55] me what you can invest in this morning
[1:39:57] and make $10 million and tomorrow be a
[1:39:59] corpse what good would it do you what
[1:40:02] profit a man if he gained the whole
[1:40:03] world and lose his
[1:40:07] soul 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and: 10 it
[1:40:10] says according to the grace of God which
[1:40:12] is given unto me as a wise master
[1:40:14] builder I have laid the foundation and
[1:40:17] another buth thereon but let every man
[1:40:19] take heed how he builth thereupon for
[1:40:22] other Foundation can no man lay than
[1:40:24] that is laid which is Jesus Christ now
[1:40:27] if any man build upon this Foundation
[1:40:29] gold silver precious stones wood haste
[1:40:33] double every man's work shall be made
[1:40:36] manifest for the day shall declare it
[1:40:38] because it shall be revealed by fire and
[1:40:41] the fire shall try every man's work of
[1:40:43] what sort it is if any man's work abide
[1:40:46] which he hath built thereupon he shall
[1:40:47] receive a reward if any man's work shall
[1:40:50] be burned he shall shall suffer loss but
[1:40:51] he himself shall be saved yet so is by
[1:40:56] fire when we surrender our talents to
[1:40:59] the Lord we're building with gold and
[1:41:01] silver and precious gems and everything
[1:41:03] that will hold up to the
[1:41:06] Flames when we choose to withhold our
[1:41:09] talent or when we choose to use the
[1:41:11] talent for our own desires we're
[1:41:14] building with the wood and hay and
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:19] stubble scripture doesn't say that we're
[1:41:21] lost because we chose to do that doesn't
[1:41:23] say that we've lost our Salvation
[1:41:25] because we couldn't fully give over that
[1:41:28] Talent we were building with the wrong
[1:41:30] thing says it'll be burned but we'll
[1:41:32] still have our
[1:41:36] salvation but how much better is it when
[1:41:39] we can build and use our talents and
[1:41:41] build in the right way so there's
[1:41:44] actually a structure that we can offer
[1:41:47] and it's not for our Glory we go Lord
[1:41:49] this is yours
[1:41:51] I gave the talent to
[1:41:53] you and you provided the
[1:41:58] increase this wasn't because of my own
[1:42:01] wisdom my own smarts my
[1:42:05] own thoughts that I was able to become
[1:42:08] better with this talent and become
[1:42:11] successful with it it's because I
[1:42:13] surrendered it to
[1:42:15] you and you were responsible for giving
[1:42:18] the increase you were responsible for
[1:42:21] bringing it
[1:42:22] back twofold fourfold
[1:42:26] tenfold because I gave it to you and I
[1:42:28] surrendered it to
[1:42:30] you it's easy to get tired it's easy to
[1:42:35] get poured out and
[1:42:38] empty in this world
[1:42:41] as we're continually giving we're
[1:42:44] continually reaching out to those around
[1:42:47] us but
[1:42:49] yet
[1:42:51] God wants to refill us so that we can
[1:42:53] keep using the talents for him he wants
[1:42:56] to refill us so that we can keep giving
[1:42:59] it not leave the battle not go I'll
[1:43:02] never do this for him
[1:43:04] again but to go okay let me rest you
[1:43:07] under the juniper
[1:43:10] tree let me allow you to rest let me
[1:43:13] feed you let me restore
[1:43:16] you so that you can then bring that
[1:43:18] Talent back in you can then begin using
[1:43:21] it again the way that you're supposed
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:27] to each one of us has those talents and
[1:43:29] each one of us is at a different place
[1:43:31] in our journey maybe maybe you are at
[1:43:35] the point right now where you're like no
[1:43:37] all my talents are being used for the
[1:43:39] Lord the way that I should wonderful
[1:43:42] praise the Lord for
[1:43:45] it but I think most of us could probably
[1:43:47] say
[1:43:48] that there's something in our life
[1:43:50] there's some talent that okay maybe the
[1:43:53] Lord could use this a little more than
[1:43:54] I'm allowing
[1:43:57] him maybe we're thinking okay I've tried
[1:44:00] to draw that
[1:44:02] back and maybe I need to rethink about
[1:44:05] why I'm doing it is it just that I need
[1:44:07] to rest so that I can go back or is it
[1:44:11] that I'm trying to take it away so it
[1:44:12] can't be used
[1:44:14] anymore each one of us are at different
[1:44:17] stages in our journey each one of us are
[1:44:18] different places and how we're being
[1:44:22] used but God is calling us to be like
[1:44:26] the first two servants in the story to
[1:44:29] give your talents completely and fully
[1:44:32] over to him to use them completely for
[1:44:36] his glory for the furtherance of his
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:41] kingdom don't be the fourth
[1:44:45] servant it's easy to fall into that trap
[1:44:48] because it's not the servant that does
[1:44:50] nothing
[1:44:52] it's the servant that doesn't give it
[1:44:54] all to
[1:44:57] him brother kobby what are we
