[28:22] through my trial. There's a reason I'm
[28:25] facing [music] these things.
[28:29] And maybe we can just go to the Lord and
[28:32] [music]
[28:33] just tell him, "Father, we
[28:36] we do love you
[28:39] and we're so thankful [music] for your
[28:42] blessings upon us and the call upon our
[28:46] lives.
[28:49] And Lord, sometimes we [music] talk
[28:51] about the goodness of the Lord and the
[28:54] blessings of the [music] Lord and
[28:57] but Lord we also know that there is a
[29:02] Lord [music] there there is a cross and
[29:07] that we carry and there is a
[29:10] surrendering of our will to you.
[29:14] And father,
[29:18] we love you with all of our heart and we
[29:21] want to follow your
[29:23] your bloody footprints as it would.
[29:28] Lord, to Calvary,
[29:32] we want to walk where you walk. We want
[29:34] to die
[29:36] to our wills as you had to
[29:39] so that your spirit can [music] have
[29:41] preeminence in our lives.
[29:45] And we ask Lord that you would
[29:48] take us in in every situation. Maybe
[29:51] there may be trials coming our way and
[29:53] we've looked and we've wondered.
[29:56] We've prayed. [music] We've
[29:59] But Lord, maybe you're molding something
[30:01] within us. And if that's what you're
[30:02] doing, we say, "Lord,
[30:05] our will is [music] your will. Our
[30:09] desires is that your will would be
[30:11] performed through us and in [music] us,
[30:13] Lord.
[30:15] Now, Lord, we just ask that you would
[30:17] take this service tonight and that you
[30:20] [music] would
[30:22] anoint it, that you would bless it to
[30:24] our hearts.
[30:26] Lord, you speak to us, Father, as
[30:29] [music] we sit at your feet.
[30:33] Lord, as we have sung all of these songs
[30:36] and wanting to do your will,
[30:40] Father, we mean that from our heart now.
[30:44] We'll give you glory and honor in Jesus
[30:46] name we pray.
[30:48] Amen. And amen.
[30:52] God bless you tonight. It's so good to
[30:54] be in the house of the Lord.
[30:57] Really good to see Sister Susie and
[31:01] and [applause]
[31:02] uh this young lady over here. Amen. And
[31:07] uh just good to good to see everyone
[31:10] here in the house of the Lord today. And
[31:13] um we're um uh so thankful for God's
[31:17] God's blessings. I love these this this
[31:20] fall weather. And u so we're we're um
[31:25] we're sure excited about this weekend
[31:27] and and uh at the fall at the fall
[31:29] fellowship. We're just believing for
[31:31] good old sunshine and some warmth. Amen.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; And it's going to be a wonderful time.
[31:39] Let's look here in the book of uh
[31:40] Matthew the 4th chapter. We've uh we're
[31:44] so blessed to see u
[31:48] uh
[31:50] Weston and uh Amen. We're just so glad
[31:54] to see him baptized the other night and
[31:57] that just really uh touched my heart.
[32:00] Touched all of our hearts actually. And
[32:02] so good to see you tonight, Weston. Just
[32:05] good to just good to see everyone here
[32:07] this evening. Amen. Let's look here in
[32:10] in Matthew 4 and 18. And Jesus walking
[32:15] by the Sea of Galilee saw two men, Simon
[32:19] Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a
[32:21] net into the sea, for they were fishers.
[32:25] And he sth unto them, "Follow me,
[32:30] and I will make you fishers
[32:33] of men."
[32:34] And then I'd also like to look here in
[32:36] Ezekiel
[32:38] the 22nd chapter and we'll start at the
[32:41] 29th verse. [snorts]
[32:44] We're just going to break in here. He
[32:46] says, "The people of the land have used
[32:48] oppression and exercised robbery and
[32:51] have vexed the poor and needy. Yay, they
[32:55] have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
[32:58] And I sought for a man among them that
[33:01] should make up the hedge and stand in
[33:04] the gap for me before me for the land
[33:08] that I should destroy it.
[33:11] But I found none.
[33:14] I want to take a a thought here tonight.
[33:17] Follow thou me. And we just ask God's
[33:20] blessings upon the reading of the word.
[33:22] You can be seated here this evening.
[33:26] a very uh simple uh thought here
[33:29] tonight.
[33:31] We read I think the greatest
[33:36] gift that any of us could have. Amen.
[33:39] The greatest honor that any of us could
[33:41] have
[33:43] would be to hear those words follow thou
[33:46] me.
[33:48] the
[33:51] I believe God is still looking for
[33:54] people who will follow him. There are
[33:57] disciples and then there are there are
[34:01] church members, churchgoers, church
[34:03] attenders
[34:05] and um and I I would almost say that
[34:10] amen there are disciples and then there
[34:12] are Christians. Amen. Today Christian is
[34:16] is very loosely used
[34:19] but a disciple of Jesus there's only one
[34:23] way to be a disciple and that's to
[34:26] follow Jesus
[34:28] and the scripture says broad is the way
[34:30] that leads to destruction and many there
[34:33] will be that goes to that but he says
[34:38] but narrow is the gate to eternal life
[34:40] and Jesus says I am the way I am the
[34:43] truth truth and I am the life.
[34:47] So as we as we look today, if there's
[34:50] ever a time that we um we need men and
[34:56] women who follow the Lord and that have
[34:59] the that come under the anointing or the
[35:03] uncctioning of the Holy Spirit for this
[35:05] day. I believe the message of the hour
[35:07] and is still calling as it has in every
[35:10] age. follow thou me. Just as it was with
[35:14] Jesus, amen, there uh on the shores of
[35:18] Galilee. And and he would he would say
[35:21] he would go, Amen. to these men and
[35:25] follow me. If you were to read the next
[35:26] verse, and the Bible says they drop
[35:28] their nets and they followed the Lord.
[35:32] He would go and and and would call
[35:35] others and they would drop what they
[35:37] were doing and they would follow the
[35:38] Lord.
[35:40] There were other ones that Jesus said,
[35:42] "Follow thou me."
[35:44] And he they would say, "Well, let me go
[35:47] first bury my father." And he would say,
[35:50] &gt;&gt; "Let the dead bury the dead.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Follow thou me."
[35:54] &gt;&gt; There would be others that would say, "I
[35:56] I've just had a wife and I and and I've
[35:59] got to," he says, "follow thou me."
[36:03] So there there the the the call is going
[36:07] forth today.
[36:09] We understand that there were many more
[36:12] who who went with Jesus that was in the
[36:16] attendance in the services, but there
[36:19] were very few that could be called the
[36:21] disciples of Jesus. And so I want to
[36:25] deal with that for a few moments
[36:26] tonight. Not going to hold you long, but
[36:29] disciples, I want to be a follower of
[36:33] Jesus Christ.
[36:35] We we understand that today the the the
[36:38] demon powers are greater than any other
[36:41] time. Brother Brandon would say that the
[36:42] whole world is going to go insane.
[36:45] Amen. And and we understand that Satan's
[36:50] Eden must come to maturity. And it has.
[36:54] Satan's Eden has come to its maturity.
[36:57] And we understand through the prophetic
[36:59] words that it must. Prophecy has already
[37:02] been spoke. The words have already been
[37:05] declared. Jesus has already foretold in
[37:08] the book of Revelations. We have found
[37:10] Amen. Even the Apostle Paul's writings
[37:13] perfectly depicting our day.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Perfectly depicting our day. Amen. And
[37:20] that there would be a day of religion
[37:23] having a power having a form of
[37:25] godliness but denying the power thereof.
[37:29] that there would be a day, amen, of of
[37:32] of selfishness,
[37:35] amen, disobedient to parents, and it
[37:38] would be and he would go on down through
[37:40] all of those things. And we we can see
[37:43] that this generation is so self-indulged
[37:47] that that there is not even there's for
[37:50] the most not even a desire to see Christ
[37:54] anymore. Amen. They've got their own
[37:56] humanistic ways. They've got their own.
[37:59] But yet the disciples, the disciples, as
[38:02] the apostle Paul would say, I want to
[38:05] know him and the power of his
[38:09] resurrection.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; I want to know him in that power. AND IN
[38:15] ORDER TO FIND THE POWER OF THE
[38:17] RESURRECTION, then there must first of
[38:19] all, Amen. being be a following of him
[38:24] into Amen. Calvary. Can you say amen?
[38:28] Yes, sir.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus or Satan has his own uh uh uh
[38:33] you know, his own tutorship. He's got
[38:36] his own disciplehip program. And amen,
[38:39] we understand he's the ruler of
[38:41] darkness. He's the prince of the air.
[38:43] He's the he he's he's the prince of
[38:46] principalities. And he's got his demonic
[38:49] powers. Amen. And they they are very
[38:52] real. They are very persuasive. And they
[38:55] have a great zeal because they have a
[38:59] disciplehip program.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; And so Satan, amen, is using technology.
[39:06] He's using um everything that he can to
[39:11] to attract. And we understand he has
[39:15] three elements. Jesus gave us the
[39:17] prophecy. He told us that there was
[39:19] going to be the three areas that he is
[39:21] Satan is going to fight us. Amen. It's
[39:25] going to be through the lust of the
[39:26] flesh. It's going to be the lust of the
[39:29] eyes and it'll be the pride of life.
[39:32] This is where Satan is is is working. We
[39:36] can see it on the billboards. We can see
[39:38] it on the magazines. We can see it on
[39:40] the internet. We can see it on the on
[39:42] the games, on your phones, on on on TV.
[39:46] You you can see that Satan has got a
[39:49] campaign. Amen. to to uh attract you to
[39:55] his direction.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; And and I'm sure that if if any of you
[40:00] have have looked when Amen. any anyone
[40:03] that comes to Christ and and comes to
[40:06] the message of the hour and we can show
[40:08] them Revelations 10:7, we can show them
[40:11] Malachi 4. We can show them uh uh Luke
[40:15] 17:30. We can show these scriptures and
[40:18] we can we can we can plainly uh declare,
[40:22] Amen, that this has been fulfilled. The
[40:24] scriptures are fulfilled. And you'll
[40:26] watch those individuals that'll start
[40:28] out so happy, start out so thankful,
[40:31] start out, but when they when they when
[40:34] they get on the internet and they want
[40:35] to start punching in. Amen. And and and
[40:38] then they come back and say, "Oh, you're
[40:41] an occult. Oh, WE CAN'T FOLLOW THIS. OH,
[40:46] I don't want anything to do with this."
[40:47] And we say, "This is the fulfillment of
[40:49] scripture."
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and they have to they they
[40:52] they turn away and they they walk away
[40:56] because amen of the pressure and and and
[41:01] the lack of of of willingness to lay it
[41:05] all down on the ground, lay it all down
[41:08] on the altar in order to be resurrected
[41:11] with Christ.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; But it's the same it's the SAME REALITY
[41:16] THAT YOU HAD TO HAVE WHEN JESUS WAS
[41:18] HERE. All right.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; I just want you to KNOW THAT
[41:21] &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS WAS ON THIS EARTH.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He wasn't a cult.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS NOT PART OF THE RELIGIOUS
[41:28] PROGRAMS.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS NOT PART OF OF OF the
[41:32] religious sinners. He was not a part of
[41:35] them all. IN FACT, THEY CALLED HIM a
[41:37] devil. In fact, they call him a fortune
[41:39] teller.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, when Jesus was was was CALLING
[41:45] THESE DISCIPLES, AMEN. THERE WAS GOING
[41:48] TO BE THERE THERE THERE WAS GOING TO BE
[41:51] A A A A A PRICE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO
[41:54] HAVE TO PAY. There there there WAS GOING
[41:57] TO BE A DECISION THAT THEY HAD TO MAKE.
[42:01] They had to think this through. THEY HAD
[42:03] TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. AMEN. What what
[42:06] what what they were doing because Amen.
[42:10] There were going to be many tests. And
[42:11] when Jesus says you've got to take up
[42:14] your cross and you've got to follow me,
[42:16] Amen. He meant it. Maybe they didn't uh
[42:19] weren't going to Calvary to be crucified
[42:21] that day, but they WERE GOING TO HAVE TO
[42:25] endure the persecution. And I just want
[42:28] to say, Amen. Jesus never did tell his
[42:31] disciples, Amen, those that he asked to
[42:34] be a Christian, those that he asked to
[42:36] follow, he never he never gave them big
[42:39] promises. He never told them, Amen, that
[42:42] you're going to make a lot of money. He
[42:44] never told them that you're going to,
[42:47] but he told them it's going to be a road
[42:49] of sorrow. It's going to be a road of
[42:52] persecution. And he says, "Unless you
[42:55] are willing to leave your mother and
[42:57] your father and your husbands and your
[42:59] wives and your children and you're
[43:02] willing to LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND, THEN YOU
[43:04] ARE NOT WORTHY to follow ME." AMEN.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS WOULD TELL HIM RIGHT UP FRONT,
[43:10] "AMEN. If you are going TO FOLLOW ME,
[43:12] YOU'RE GOING TO have to MAKE A DECISION
[43:14] TO FOLLOW ME." AMEN. Or you will not
[43:18] last the journey.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say today, it is still the
[43:22] same. I don't care what religion is
[43:24] trying to offer.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; We don't care uh what the Christian
[43:28] world has turned this religion into. I
[43:32] say there is A LIVING CHRIST. I say that
[43:35] he is worth following.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; I say Jesus is worth following here
[43:39] tonight. Can you say amen?
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand that when
[43:44] we Amen. we become ACCUSTOMED TO THE
[43:47] EVIL of the age. Amen. And sometimes we
[43:50] we we can we we uh uh uh the world it
[43:54] seems. Amen. They don't know what
[43:56] Christianity is. They don't. They they
[43:58] they think it's just coming and giving
[44:00] your heart to the Lord or shaking a
[44:02] preacher's hand or or even getting
[44:04] baptized and then that's that's what
[44:06] religion is. But religion is is is dying
[44:09] to yourself. Dying to what you think is
[44:12] right and a willingness to follow the
[44:14] Lord Jesus Christ.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; A WILLINGNESS TO FOLLOW HIM and his
[44:18] word. But the scripture says in in in in
[44:22] 2 Thessalonians 2:9, it says, "Even him
[44:25] who's coming is after the working of
[44:27] Satan with all power and signs and lying
[44:30] wonders with all deceivleness of
[44:32] unrighteousness and them that perish
[44:34] because they receive not the love of the
[44:36] truth that they might be saved." This is
[44:40] the era that we're living in. AND SATAN
[44:43] BEGINS TO INFLAME THOSE those senses.
[44:46] Amen. But I I just want to let you know
[44:49] there's going to be some disciples
[44:53] &gt;&gt; and these men and women are going to
[44:55] become the body of the Lord Jesus
[44:58] Christ. And I want you to know here that
[44:59] today you are his body.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; That's why you must die as he has died.
[45:06] Just as he had to surrender his will to
[45:09] the father, so must the elect surrender
[45:12] their will to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, can you say amen?
[45:17] &gt;&gt; We're living in this day of of of of
[45:20] great uh uh uh it's it's it's
[45:23] imprisonment, if you will. Amen. Where
[45:26] people are are are are totally
[45:28] imprisoned in THEIR SPIRITS. THEIR SOULS
[45:31] ARE TOTALLY LOCKED UP. AND it and it
[45:33] reminds me of the of the dream that
[45:35] Brother Brandham would have. Amen. That
[45:38] of of people hopelessly imprisoned
[45:41] behind mammoth bars. and and a woman in
[45:43] the prison is is pleading with brother
[45:45] Brown to deliver deliver us from this
[45:48] and said this is a house of hell. You've
[45:51] been misunderstood and and and you've
[45:54] misunderstood these people too AND THESE
[45:57] ARE FINE PEOPLE. And I looked over there
[45:59] and and and and like a great big cell or
[46:02] big walls. Amen. down beneath a great
[46:05] big cave and great iron bars eight or 10
[46:08] inches thick and people out of their
[46:11] minds twisted arms and legs and beating
[46:14] their heads like that and she SHE WAS
[46:16] CRYING DELIVER these people brother
[46:18] Brandham said help us we're in trouble
[46:21] she herself I know her she belongs to
[46:23] the to the church of Christ or the
[46:25] Christian church called the church of
[46:27] the brethren and I looked around and I
[46:29] said I wish I could and I I go on and
[46:32] looking around and my little body. Them
[46:35] great big iron bars, those people, poor
[46:37] people in there, and you couldn't get to
[46:39] them iron bars. Uh uh you know, them
[46:42] iron bars was setting so close together.
[46:45] And I looked and they were beating their
[46:47] heads like they were out of their mind.
[46:49] And I seen some lights flickering around
[46:52] in there. And I looked up and there
[46:54] stood the Lord Jesus with the lights of
[46:57] rainbow around him. And he was looking
[46:59] right straight at me. And he said,
[47:01] "Deliver those people." and he went
[47:04] away. AND I THOUGHT, HOW COULD I DELIVER
[47:08] THEM? I haven't got strength enough in
[47:10] my arms to break those bars. So I said,
[47:14] HOUSE OF HELL, GIVE WAY in the name of
[47:19] Jesus Christ.
[47:22] AND HE SAID, "ALL THE CREAKING AND THE
[47:23] POPPING AND THE ROCKS ARE ROLLING AND
[47:25] THE BARS ARE FALLING and people running
[47:27] and screaming delivered and screaming at
[47:30] the top of their voice and was all
[47:32] delivered." And then, amen, he he he
[47:36] says NOW WHEN HE WAKES UP, AMEN. and
[47:39] he's under this great this great burden
[47:42] because he's understanding that
[47:45] Christianity
[47:46] that his ROLE WAS NOT JUST to be a
[47:49] preacher
[47:50] &gt;&gt; was not just to be AN EVANGELIST WAS NOT
[47:53] JUST TO BE THE TYPICAL BUT GOD REQUIRED
[47:56] FOR A TOTAL surrender of his life
[47:59] &gt;&gt; because he was going to represent God
[48:03] upon this earth. Now I want you to
[48:06] understand here today, God doesn't just
[48:09] save you, but God wants you to be a
[48:12] disciple.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; AND TO THOSE DISCIPLES, HE TURNED TO
[48:16] THOSE DISCIPLES AND SAID, "THE WORKS
[48:18] THAT I DO SHALL YOU DO ALSO."
[48:22] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD ALSO SAY, "AMEN." BROTHER
[48:24] BRANDHAM SAYS, "THE GREATEST WORKS THAT
[48:26] A BELIEVER COULD EVER do would BE SET
[48:29] THE CAPTIVES FREE. THE GREATEST MIRACLE
[48:32] WE COULD EVER PERFORM, AMEN, would be to
[48:37] give and impart eternal life to those
[48:40] who, Amen, who do not HAVE LIFE.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST GIFT, THE GREATEST
[48:46] OPPORTUNITY THAT WE COULD EVER HAVE IS
[48:49] FOR THE TEACHER TO LOOK BACK AT his
[48:52] pupil and say, "I have prepared you for
[48:55] this hour.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; I HAVE PREPARED YOU. I HAVE TAUGHT YOU.
[49:00] I HAVE SHOWN YOU HOW TO BOTH SURRENDER
[49:05] YOURSELF IN DEATH and I've also shown
[49:07] you how you can raise to the right hand
[49:10] of the father.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; I say this this disciples. Amen. That
[49:16] God is calling for disciples today. And
[49:18] to me, amen. To me, there's a telltale
[49:21] sign of any disciple. Amen. A disciple
[49:25] is a learner. He's a pupil. He's he's
[49:27] one WHO PURPOSED US TO FOLLOW AFTER ONE
[49:30] WHO WALKS WITH JESUS. AMEN.
[49:34] A A DISCIPLE IS ONE WHO IS TAUGHT BY THE
[49:36] LORD. GLORY TO GOD. I I believe that
[49:39] every good student. Amen. THE THE THE
[49:42] DESIRE OF EVERY GOOD STUDENT IS IS IS TO
[49:45] FOLLOW THE PATTERN OF THE teacher and
[49:47] LEARN ABOUT THE FATHER'S business and
[49:50] learn it and do it just like he done it.
[49:52] How about it? Yes.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; I I I JUST I JUST NEVER I JUST NEVER
[49:56] SEEN JESUS COMING up to the blind and
[49:58] saying, "Listen, you know, it's going to
[50:00] be all right. After a while, I'm going
[50:01] to give you eternal life on the other
[50:03] side. Jesus came to heal the sick right
[50:06] now.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus came to impart salvation right
[50:10] now. Jesus came to do these. And there's
[50:13] not a greater honor than to THAN TO HAVE
[50:16] THE LORD TO CHOOSE US AND TO EMPOWER US
[50:21] &gt;&gt; TO [screaming] FOLLOW HIM AND WALK IN
[50:24] his footsteps.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? The actions of a
[50:29] disciple. Amen. Gives them away as where
[50:32] there's an apple tree. Amen. You're
[50:35] going to have apples everywhere. You're
[50:36] going to have apples in the tree. You're
[50:38] going to have apples. Amen. ON THE
[50:40] GROUND UNDER the tree, you're going TO
[50:42] HAVE APPLES. WHY? BECAUSE APPLES, apple
[50:45] trees produces apples. AND A DISCIPLE OF
[50:49] JESUS CHRIST HAS GOT ONE DESIRE, and
[50:52] that's to do the will of the Lord.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; To do the will of the Lord. Now, YOU
[50:56] LISTEN TO ME. THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[50:58] THERE'S GOT TO be a desire now. Amen.
[51:01] WHEN THERE WERE THOSE DISCIPLES THAT
[51:02] SAYS, I'VE GOT TO GO BURY. But there
[51:04] were those who had dropped their nets,
[51:06] dropped, and that meant that meant
[51:08] everything. That's how they made their
[51:10] living. They dropped it all. Luke, HE
[51:12] WAS THE PHYSICIAN. BUT WHEN JESUS CAME,
[51:15] AMEN, to Luke OR WHEN WHEN G AND AND AND
[51:18] he surrendered his his life, Amen, to to
[51:21] the Lord. But he was with Paul. But you
[51:23] you look there AT THESE OTHERS. AMEN. I
[51:26] BELIEVE IT WAS WHAT WAS WHAT WAS
[51:27] MATTHEW, wasn't he? Uh Amen. uh uh uh uh
[51:30] HE HE WAS SOMEBODY OF GREAT IMPORTANCE,
[51:33] but he WAS WILLING TO DROP IT ALL, LAY
[51:36] IT ALL ON THE GROUND SO THAT CHRIST
[51:39] COULD be glorified in him.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. You look there at Luke. You look
[51:45] there at Amen at Paul or at at uh at
[51:48] Matthew. You look there at at at these
[51:51] great men. You look there at John. and
[51:54] and whatever they found in this Christ
[51:56] was exactly what they wanted. It was ex
[51:59] they were willing to drop everything to
[52:02] follow him.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Brother, if you if you if you're not
[52:05] willing to forsake all of the world and
[52:08] forsake all of sin and forsake all of
[52:11] yourself, then you are not worthy of the
[52:16] Lord Jesus Christ.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; CHRISTIANITY IS NOT WHAT he can do for
[52:22] me. RIGHT.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; CHRISTIANITY is me following him.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I I I I want us to really
[52:32] think about that. Amen. The phrase
[52:34] follow me is found 20 something times in
[52:38] the four gospels. The Holy Ghost is
[52:42] Amen. IS IS CALLING OUT TO THAT ELECT.
[52:45] AMEN. Follow thou me. Well, praise the
[52:49] name of the Lord. I I I I WANT I WANT TO
[52:51] BE A FOLLOWER.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; How many wants to be a follower of
[52:55] Jesus?
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be a I I I want to be a
[52:59] follower of the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[53:02] want to be Amen. I I want to uh I I I
[53:06] want to surrender everything that I've
[53:08] got.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO FOLLOW, BROTHER BRANDON
[53:12] WOULD SAY, THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[53:13] predestinated something on the inside of
[53:15] our hearts. Amen. There's got to be
[53:17] something. And he would talk about the
[53:19] deep calling to the deep. He would call
[53:21] he would talk about the sunlight
[53:23] attracting Amen. the uh uh you know the
[53:26] sunlight attracting the seeds in the
[53:27] ground and it producing the weed or the
[53:29] apples or it it producing amen. And
[53:32] that's really the way it is with Jesus
[53:34] Christ the word when Christ comes. Amen.
[53:37] There's something already on the inside
[53:38] of your heart and it just says amen to
[53:40] it.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; It says amen to it. Well, praise the
[53:43] Lord.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I I I WANT TO SAY JUST BECAUSE
[53:46] YOU ARE THE predestinated seed does not
[53:48] mean that everything is easy. It doesn't
[53:50] mean that Amen. life is a flower bed of
[53:53] vasees. It it means that there's going
[53:55] to be a Amen. a a lot of of trials and
[53:58] tribulations. Can you say amen?
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus even said there in Luke 20
[54:04] 14 and I believe 24 uh uh 14 and 24 14
[54:08] and 25 maybe. Amen. and and and he he he
[54:12] said that, you know, he talked about the
[54:13] great multitudes that were that that
[54:15] were coming and and and he and he turned
[54:19] unto them and he and he said TO THEM,
[54:22] "IF ANY man come to me," AMEN. AND HATES
[54:26] NOT HIS FATHER, his mother, HIS WIFE,
[54:30] HIS CHILDREN, AMEN, and brethren and
[54:33] sisters. AND HE GOES ON DOWN THERE AND
[54:35] AND HE THEN HE SAYS, "And even his own
[54:38] life, Okay.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, he says you cannot be my disciple.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he says, "AND WHOSOEVER
[54:48] DOES NOT BEAR HIS cross come after me
[54:52] cannot be my disciple." Now to that that
[54:56] uh wonderful young lady that I told here
[54:58] a while back. Amen. There's only one
[55:00] kind of a Christian and that's a
[55:02] disciple. THERE'S ONLY ONE KIND OF A
[55:05] CHRISTIAN AND THAT'S THOSE THAT FOLLOW
[55:07] JESUS. Can you say amen? Now, Jesus
[55:11] didn't when he Amen. And and and and let
[55:15] me just put it this way. It doesn't mean
[55:16] you've got to we're all going to go
[55:18] shoot ourselves or we're all going to go
[55:19] die physically, but that does mean that
[55:22] we have to die to our sin nature.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; That we have to surrender our wills. And
[55:28] even though we've been born again and
[55:30] died to our sin nature, there's many of
[55:32] times where we have to still surrender
[55:34] our will to the Lord Jesus Christ. Yes.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, I WANT US I WANT US TO JUST
[55:41] STOP AND THINK HERE TONIGHT. I KNOW IT
[55:42] MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT different thought.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want us to really stop to
[55:46] consider not everybody is called to
[55:49] follow Jesus.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; AND ONLY THOSE WHO HAS NO OTHER WAY TO
[55:55] GO. ONLY THOSE WILL FOLLOW AFTER JESUS.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I I'VE GOT TWO SCRIPTURES THERE
[56:02] THAT I CAN SHOW YOU. AMEN. two groups of
[56:04] people and and when when Jesus, you
[56:08] know, he was talking one time and and in
[56:10] John 6 and 60 and he and he and he and
[56:13] he and he mentioned he he was he was
[56:15] preaching and and and it says, "And many
[56:18] therefore of his disciples when they
[56:20] heard this said, this is a hard saying,
[56:24] who can hear it?"
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says the 66th verse,
[56:29] "And from that time many of his
[56:31] disciples went back and walked no more
[56:33] with him." But then Jesus then said
[56:37] Jesus to the 12, "Will you go away
[56:39] also?"
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Then Simon Peter answered and said,
[56:42] "Lord, to whom shall we go?
[56:46] &gt;&gt; For thou hast the words of eternal
[56:49] life?"
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Two two people. There's one
[56:54] THAT CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HIM.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; And there's the other. It's just a
[56:59] religious following.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; It's just something to to make their
[57:03] life better maybe. Or they Amen. They're
[57:06] following it for the prestige or
[57:08] whatever. But you see, Jesus is wanting
[57:10] somebody who is willing to lay their
[57:13] life down for the cause. Because you
[57:16] say, "Brother Wendle, man, Christianity
[57:20] isn't dos and don'ts." And I agree,
[57:22] Christianity is not dos and don'ts.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; But I will tell you this. If you ever
[57:27] find a revelation of who Jesus is, you
[57:30] will walk with him.
[57:33] Jesus and the revelation that Jesus had,
[57:37] his revelation
[57:40] &gt;&gt; SO SET HIM apart
[57:42] &gt;&gt; from anybody else. Can you say amen?
[57:46] Even if we were TO RETRACE HIS FOOTSTEPS
[57:49] TO GETHSEMANE, THAT'S WHERE THE GARDEN
[57:51] the garden of Gethsemane.
[57:53] Amen. There is is that there in
[57:55] Gethsemane is where is where Jesus
[57:58] surrendered his will.
[58:00] And I and I've said and I've always said
[58:03] the crucifixion took place there in
[58:05] Gethsemane.
[58:06] Now you say, "No, the crucifixion was on
[58:08] Mount Calvary."
[58:10] BUT YOU SEE THERE at Gethsemane was
[58:13] where Jesus will was surrendered.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; JESUS BATTLED A GREAT BATTLE at
[58:20] Gethsemane before he went to Mount
[58:21] Calvary.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; JESUS KNOWING WHAT WAS AHEAD OF HIM.
[58:27] AND JESUS ASKED HIS DISCIPLES TO COME
[58:29] AND PRAY WITH HIM. He [snorts] took
[58:31] Peter, James, and John up there in the
[58:34] garden. Amen. And asked them to pray.
[58:36] And then he goes up there a little bit
[58:38] further. He starts praying and he and
[58:40] and the Bible says that Jesus was in
[58:43] such agony. He was in such agony because
[58:46] he was going to be dying and he knew he
[58:49] knew the suffering that he was that it
[58:50] was going to come on him. Amen. The
[58:53] Bible says that his water and his blood
[58:56] had separated in such a way. Amen. That
[58:59] he sweated blood. Blood drops of sweat
[59:02] was coming down. Amen. Science says that
[59:06] he had gotten so he had gotten under
[59:11] such stress. HE WAS UNDER SUCH AGONY
[59:14] WITH HIS WILL. HIS WILL WAS AMEN. HE WAS
[59:18] STRUGGLING SO HARD. YES, I'M TALKING
[59:20] ABOUT JESUS, the perfect son OF GOD.
[59:22] JESUS HAD TO SURRENDER EVERYTHING ABOUT
[59:25] HIM.
[59:27] AMEN.
[59:28] Then he comes to his friends. Amen. and
[59:31] his pupils, those that he's been
[59:33] training and they're sleeping. And he
[59:36] says, "Do you not understand the urgency
[59:38] of the hour? I'm not going to be with
[59:41] you always."
[59:43] And they said, "I'm sorry." And they he
[59:45] wakes him up and they go back to
[59:47] praying. He goes back to praying. But
[59:49] finally Jesus reached that point to
[59:52] where he could he could he could lose
[59:56] himself and he died to his nature. And
[59:59] he said, "Father,
[1:00:02] not my will,
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; but thy will be done."
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding that the power
[1:00:11] Jesus didn't LOSE POWER? JESUS HAD
[1:00:14] POWER.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; JESUS WASN'T BEGGING FOR SOMETHING THAT
[1:00:20] HE DID NOT HAVE.
[1:00:23] But Jesus willingly surrendered himself
[1:00:28] to the will of God,
[1:00:30] to the will of the father. Can you say
[1:00:33] amen?
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; And I think it's interesting because if
[1:00:35] you were to read there, Sister Keys, if
[1:00:37] you'd put that up there, John 18 and4.
[1:00:41] Amen. He he he um he's he's talking
[1:00:45] about this is him. Amen. Jesus knowing
[1:00:49] all things that should come to him went
[1:00:52] forth and asked. Now, this is Judas.
[1:00:54] Judas has already went up there. He's
[1:00:55] brought he's brought the disciples or
[1:00:57] he's he's brought the the angry mob, all
[1:01:00] of the soldiers, spears, swords. They're
[1:01:02] coming to grab to take Jesus. And he
[1:01:05] went forth and said unto them, Whom seek
[1:01:07] ye? And they answered him, Jesus of
[1:01:11] Nazareth. And Jesus said unto them, I am
[1:01:15] he. Judas also, which betrayed him,
[1:01:18] stood with them. And as soon as he had
[1:01:21] said unto them, I am he, they went
[1:01:25] backward and fell on the ground. I want
[1:01:27] you to look at the power that Jesus had.
[1:01:32] Jesus the the author. He had power. He
[1:01:35] had authority. Amen. Keep that up there,
[1:01:37] sister Keys. AMEN. THEY WENT BACK. THEY
[1:01:40] FELL BACKWARD TO THE GROUND. THIS POWER
[1:01:44] JESUS DID NOT lose his power.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Right? Are are YOU UNDERSTANDING ME?
[1:01:50] MATTER OF FACT, IF YOU WERE TO IF IF IF
[1:01:52] YOU WERE TO look there at Matthew uh
[1:01:53] we'll come back to that in just a
[1:01:54] minute. But if you were to look there at
[1:01:56] Matthew 26 and 53, HE SAYS, "THINKEST
[1:01:59] THOU THAT I CANNOT PRAY TO MY FATHER,
[1:02:03] AND HE SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE ME MORE THAN
[1:02:06] 12 LEGIONS OF ANGELS,
[1:02:08] but how shall the scriptures be
[1:02:12] fulfilled
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; that thus it MUST BE?"
[1:02:17] NOW JESUS IS SAYING,
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; "I CAN CALL ANGELS AND ALL OF Y'ALL
[1:02:23] WOULD BE A GRIEF SPOT RIGHT NOW,
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; but scriptures couldn't be fulfilled
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; unless I surrender my will."
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I want us to really think about
[1:02:35] this for a moment. Not going to hold you
[1:02:36] long tonight. Now
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; scriptures can only be fulfilled
[1:02:42] when there are followers
[1:02:45] of Jesus
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; who was willing to follow the road and
[1:02:50] retrace the steps that he took.
[1:02:55] While some of us why some of us we we
[1:02:58] just it's the easy things. We we don't
[1:03:02] want to give up vaping or we don't want
[1:03:04] to give up our grudge or we don't want
[1:03:07] to give up our you know our our our our
[1:03:11] pet feelings or for you girls you don't
[1:03:14] want to quit cutting your hair or Amen
[1:03:16] or or or or what you know what whatever
[1:03:19] it may be in those LITTLE THINGS I'M
[1:03:22] TALKING ABOUT THIS MAN HAD TO LAY HIS
[1:03:26] LIFE DOWN.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; He was the healer. He was the deliverer.
[1:03:33] He had he had the throngs
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; and HE HAD THE POWER WITH GOD.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; how that the prophet would tell us power
[1:03:48] without character
[1:03:50] is satanic?
[1:03:52] SEE, GOD HAS WANT IS IS IS WANTING TO
[1:03:57] INVEST HIS POWER IN HIS CHURCH. AND HE
[1:03:59] HAS INVESTED HIS power in his church.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; But you see, there's got to be some
[1:04:06] character that charact. What can you
[1:04:08] say? Amen. Now, now Jesus would go on in
[1:04:11] that 55th verse and he would say, "And
[1:04:13] at the same hour said Jesus to the
[1:04:16] multitudes or you come out as against a
[1:04:18] thief with swords and staves to take
[1:04:21] me." Now this is another account that to
[1:04:24] take me I set daily with you teaching in
[1:04:26] the temple
[1:04:28] and you laid no hold on me. But all this
[1:04:32] is done that the scripture of the
[1:04:35] prophets might be fulfilled.
[1:04:39] And then look, then all the disciples
[1:04:42] forsook him
[1:04:45] and fled.
[1:04:47] Now think about it.
[1:04:50] I I I want us to just just as I as as I
[1:04:59] looking there at the scriptures.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; And Jesus talking about follow thou me.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; It just behooves us to look and it and
[1:05:12] and retrace.
[1:05:15] Now, history say or the scriptures share
[1:05:17] that the next place that Jesus is going
[1:05:19] to go, they come and took him. They took
[1:05:21] him to the high priest. Amen. There's
[1:05:24] where the religious preachers are at.
[1:05:26] There's where the they they made fun of
[1:05:28] him and demanding him to prophesy. Luke
[1:05:31] 22:63 said they mocked him and and
[1:05:35] smoteed him and they blindfolded him and
[1:05:37] demanded him as they struck him in the
[1:05:39] face. Prophesy. Who is it that smoked
[1:05:42] thee? Amen. and many other blasphemously
[1:05:47] uh things blasphemously spake they
[1:05:49] against him. Amen. You got to follow him
[1:05:52] there. There's going to be there's going
[1:05:53] to be those that are just the preachers
[1:05:55] are going to come against this message
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; and what God's doing.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying if we're going to follow
[1:06:02] his footsteps,
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; the next place you're going to go,
[1:06:04] you're going to go to Herod's court.
[1:06:07] Amen. Or or to Pilate's Hall.
[1:06:11] And there's where the criticisms and the
[1:06:13] flogging and the the falsely accused AND
[1:06:17] PILATE SAYING, "I HAVE POWER OVER YOU. I
[1:06:20] CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT." AND JESUS
[1:06:22] LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID, "YOU HAVE
[1:06:24] [screaming] NO POWER over me."
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Other than that which God gives you.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIMES IT'S IN THIS ERA AREA OF
[1:06:36] OUR LIVES that the devil is fighting us.
[1:06:41] And Satan says, "I've got power over
[1:06:43] you.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; I've got power over you." But there's
[1:06:48] where we follow the footprints of Jesus.
[1:06:51] And Jesus says, "You have no power." And
[1:06:53] I want to say, "No power over you."
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Satan has no power over God's elect.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU UNDERSTANDING ME? WHAT I AM
[1:07:04] SAYING IS THAT WE ARE LIVING IN THE TIME
[1:07:07] OF SCRIPTURES BEING fulfilled and there
[1:07:10] must be genuine disciples
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; that's going to follow after Christ.
[1:07:15] Because sometimes sometimes walking
[1:07:18] through those valleys, Amen. Sometimes
[1:07:21] when it seems like we're all alone,
[1:07:22] sometimes when we're in the dark,
[1:07:24] sometimes that's when a Psalms 23, amen,
[1:07:29] rings out the best. The Lord is my
[1:07:31] shepherd. I shall not want. He leadth me
[1:07:35] beside the still waters. He restoth my
[1:07:39] soul. He feeds me. Amen. In the presence
[1:07:42] of mine enemies. See? SEE, IT'S IT'S US
[1:07:44] SURRENDERING OURSELVES TO HIM.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[1:07:52] Following the Lord, I think is so
[1:07:54] important.
[1:07:56] After you get through Pilot's hall,
[1:07:57] you're going to go to Herod's court. And
[1:07:59] Herod's was excited. Herod was happy. Uh
[1:08:04] uh you can put that up there, sister
[1:08:05] Keys, there in Luke 23 and8. Herod was
[1:08:08] happy that they brought Jesus in. He had
[1:08:10] heard so many things. And when Herod saw
[1:08:13] Jesus, he was exceeding glad for he was
[1:08:16] desirous to see
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; of a long season because he had heard
[1:08:22] many things of him and he had hoped to
[1:08:25] have seen some miracle done by him.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There Jesus is standing before him
[1:08:35] and he's wanting they're wanting him to
[1:08:37] perform a miracle. And the Bible says
[1:08:40] Jesus answered not a word.
[1:08:44] If you read on down in that same book
[1:08:46] there in that same book you read, then
[1:08:49] you're going to find that the the the
[1:08:52] scripture says Pilate and Herod were
[1:08:55] were enemies.
[1:08:57] They wouldn't even talk to one another.
[1:08:59] But the Bible said because of this,
[1:09:02] Jesus brought these two enemies together
[1:09:06] and they were friends,
[1:09:09] they joined together to fight against
[1:09:12] that word made flesh.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; I have a point. I have a reason for
[1:09:17] going to where I'm going.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:09:19] In order for the will of God to be
[1:09:22] performed, to be fulfilled in our in our
[1:09:26] day,
[1:09:28] that's going to require some disciples.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Some real men and women, boys and girls
[1:09:34] who are willing to follow after the Lord
[1:09:36] Jesus.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:09:41] dominion belongs to that eternal seed.
[1:09:45] And to me, the greatest dominion of all,
[1:09:47] what proves Jesus, what proves Jesus
[1:09:50] besides the resurrection, what proves
[1:09:51] Jesus to be who he was was the ability.
[1:09:54] He had power. I mean, just just his
[1:09:56] presence and answer, and who you asking
[1:09:57] for? And all the soldiers, they all fell
[1:09:59] back. They all fell down. Hallelujah. He
[1:10:02] had power with him. He said, "I've got
[1:10:04] 12 legions of angels that I could have
[1:10:05] at my disposal right now."
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; I mean, they're all around. You all
[1:10:09] don't see them, but they're on every
[1:10:11] tree. They're all over these. They're
[1:10:12] lurking everywhere. They can have your
[1:10:15] bacon right now.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; But Jesus
[1:10:22] had dominion,
[1:10:24] brought his will under control,
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; and said, "Not my will,
[1:10:30] but thy will be done."
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; I want his will. And many times
[1:10:38] I think of I think of Ecclesiastes 11:9.
[1:10:43] It says, "Rejoice to you young people.
[1:10:45] Rejoice, oh young man, in thy youth,
[1:10:49] and let thy heart cheer thee in the days
[1:10:52] of thy youth. Walk in the ways of thine
[1:10:55] heart, and in the sight of thine eyes,
[1:10:58] but know thou, for all these things God
[1:11:02] will bring thee into judgment.
[1:11:05] Therefore remove sorrow from thine
[1:11:07] heart, and put away evil from thy flesh.
[1:11:12] Okay.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; For childhood
[1:11:15] and youth
[1:11:17] are vanity.
[1:11:19] Can you say
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Surrendering to the Lord,
[1:11:24] his His presence coming upon you,
[1:11:28] laying yourself upon that altar,
[1:11:32] gifts
[1:11:34] of God laying within the elect.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus could not. Now, he performed
[1:11:42] miracles. He done he done wonderful
[1:11:43] things. But Jesus main purpose for
[1:11:45] coming was not to heal
[1:11:48] Lazarus and the blind man. And and Jesus
[1:11:51] Jesus purpose was to redeem you.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; And when it came down to that, it came
[1:12:00] down to him having to surrender
[1:12:02] everything he had because of that. The
[1:12:07] Bible says that he has been raised,
[1:12:10] exalted, and given a name above all
[1:12:13] names.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; I say tonight
[1:12:18] as we come to this finality of
[1:12:21] redemption,
[1:12:23] there is going to be a people
[1:12:26] that is not going to see death.
[1:12:30] And I believe that we are
[1:12:35] I I believe that that that there's a lot
[1:12:38] of you sitting here today I believe that
[1:12:40] are not going to see death. I believe
[1:12:43] the rapture is that close.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; I believe the scripture has told us that
[1:12:50] when you see that fig tree bud, lift up
[1:12:53] your head, redemption draws nigh. That's
[1:12:54] talking about Israel. We've got we we've
[1:12:57] got all of these prophetic things that
[1:12:58] have come about. We we're here
[1:13:03] and I I believe the greatest triumphant
[1:13:07] march that is that is processional that
[1:13:10] has taken place is fixing to take place.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; It was a great it was a great
[1:13:18] processional. Amen. When Jesus and and
[1:13:21] and and all of those saints walked in,
[1:13:24] those Old Testament saints. But brother,
[1:13:27] there ain't nothing like the bride of
[1:13:28] Jesus Christ that's fixing to walk in.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, I I I, as the Apostle Paul
[1:13:38] would say there in Galatians 2 and 20, I
[1:13:41] am crucified with Christ.
[1:13:43] Nevertheless, I live.
[1:13:47] Yet not I, but Christ lives in me.
[1:13:52] THE LIFE WHICH I NOW LIVE IN THE FLESH,
[1:13:55] I live by the faith of the son of God
[1:13:58] who loved me and gave himself for me.
[1:14:01] Well, can I hear a great big amen?
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because we have surrendered
[1:14:06] ourselves to the Lord. And only when you
[1:14:09] surrender yourselves to the Lord, you've
[1:14:12] got to die. And only then when you die
[1:14:16] can you rise up in the newness of life.
[1:14:18] And when God can come and fill you with
[1:14:21] his Holy Spirit.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Spirit comes, everything
[1:14:26] becomes brand new.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Brand new. Everything is brand new.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; The way you think is brand new. You
[1:14:33] ain't turning the Christianity is not
[1:14:34] turning over a new leaf. Christianity,
[1:14:37] Amen, is the very nature of Jesus Christ
[1:14:39] coming on the inside of you and him
[1:14:41] living his life through you. Amen.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Sin is no longer sin. Amen. You have no
[1:14:48] desire for that. You have one desire,
[1:14:50] and that is to walk with Jesus Christ.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And there's plenty of blood there. If
[1:14:55] you should fall and make a mistake, you
[1:14:58] should fail. And you should say, "Oh my,
[1:15:00] I have I have fallen short." Amen. But
[1:15:03] God's grace is right there for every one
[1:15:05] of us. And saying, "I'm my blood will be
[1:15:08] there to take you all the way.
[1:15:10] My grace is sufficient in your time of
[1:15:13] need.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen?
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; We're in this dark room. WE'RE IN THIS
[1:15:18] WE'RE IN THIS UH THIS WORLD IS LIKE A
[1:15:21] DARK ROOM. Uh we're WHERE THE THE
[1:15:24] DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEGATIVES ARE ARE are
[1:15:27] are taking place. Amen. As the old 35
[1:15:31] millimeter cameras, well, all you know,
[1:15:32] all of the old cameras used to have that
[1:15:34] negative. Amen. those negatives that
[1:15:37] you'd have to go in and to that dark
[1:15:39] room and then all of the all of the
[1:15:41] negatives. Amen. Then it would come out
[1:15:43] to the positive. And what God seen of
[1:15:46] you, every one of you that were on his
[1:15:49] book before the world ever began, God
[1:15:52] seen you in your perfection. God seen
[1:15:54] you in glory. GOD SEEN YOU. HE'S ALREADY
[1:15:57] GOT A place reserved at his banqueting
[1:16:01] table for you.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to set with the
[1:16:05] literal, amen, the literal Jesus Christ.
[1:16:10] Some people try to make it say, "Oh,
[1:16:12] well, you know, you we're not going to
[1:16:14] see a literal body." And the and and and
[1:16:17] then there's, you know, and and they
[1:16:18] say, "Uh, you know, the marriage supper,
[1:16:21] that was just all figurative." And then
[1:16:22] we're in the marriage supper right now.
[1:16:25] You know, we're feasting. And I and I'm
[1:16:27] thinking, I don't know what kind of a
[1:16:28] message you heard, but I've never heard
[1:16:30] that from the prophet.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says that it'll go for miles.
[1:16:34] That table will go for miles and miles
[1:16:36] and miles. And I've got my name at that
[1:16:40] table. [cheering]
[1:16:42] [applause]
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT YOUR NAME AT THAT TABLE. You
[1:16:47] say, "Well, Brother Wendell, I what if I
[1:16:49] don't CONTINUE TO FOLLOW?" AMEN. GOD
[1:16:51] [screaming] KNOWS EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE,
[1:16:54] AND IT DON'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF A TRIAL
[1:16:56] CAN COME YOUR WAY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE
[1:16:58] THERE.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; The testing's come. The testing's go.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're in that you're in that
[1:17:06] dark room
[1:17:08] that Romans Romans the 7th chapter puts
[1:17:11] it puts it uh very good in the 22nd
[1:17:15] verse. Amen. He says, "For I delight in
[1:17:18] the LAW OF GOD AFTER the inward man."
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; I DELIGHT AFTER THE LAW OF GOD. AMEN. In
[1:17:26] the law of God after the uh uh THE
[1:17:28] INWARD MAN. BUT THERE IS A ANOTHER LAW
[1:17:33] THAT IS WORKING IN ME. AMEN. I see it's
[1:17:38] working in my members. And I Amen. that
[1:17:41] there in uh Romans 7 and 23. AMEN.
[1:17:46] WARING AGAINST THE LAW [screaming] OF MY
[1:17:49] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[1:17:52] the law of sin which is in my members.
[1:17:55] What is he trying to say? Amen. There is
[1:17:58] always that something gnawing in your
[1:18:01] mind. ALWAYS TELLING YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT
[1:18:04] THE REAL DISCIPLE. That he chose this
[1:18:06] one sitting on this side of you and that
[1:18:07] one sitting on that side of you. But
[1:18:09] you're not the disciple. But it's time
[1:18:11] for you to look at him. Amen. And remind
[1:18:14] him of a song that that that that Merl
[1:18:17] Haggard wrote. I'm not the running kind.
[1:18:20] Hallelujah. Amen. I am not running. I'm
[1:18:23] not turning aside. [screaming] I'm not
[1:18:25] looking to the left OR THE RIGHT.
[1:18:28] TRIALS COME, BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS
[1:18:31] PRESSURE, AMEN, THAT THESE THINGS THAT
[1:18:34] COME AGAINST ME AND THEY BUFFET MY SOUL.
[1:18:37] AND I SIT THERE SOMETIMES, AMEN, AND
[1:18:39] AGONY [screaming] AND WONDERING IF GOD'S
[1:18:41] FORGOT ABOUT ME AND WONDERING IF I'M
[1:18:44] GOING TO COME THROUGH. I WANT YOU TO
[1:18:46] KNOW GOD [screaming] IS DEVELOPING
[1:18:48] CHARACTER IN YOU. YOU ARE HIS SUBJECT.
[1:18:53] YOU [screaming] ARE HIS SON AND
[1:18:55] DAUGHTER. HE IS LEADING YOU, THE
[1:18:58] DISCIPLE, unto that throne of glory.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; What you're going through is nothing
[1:19:08] more
[1:19:10] or nothing less than Jesus had to go
[1:19:12] through.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; You say nothing less.
[1:19:17] Jesus had to surrender his will.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; And you must do the exact same thing.
[1:19:25] Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; You've got to surrender your will
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; in order to follow the Lord.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen?
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:41] The apostle Paul there in Romans 12 and
[1:19:44] one. I beseech you therefore, brethren,
[1:19:47] by the mercies of God that you present
[1:19:50] your bodies
[1:19:52] a living sacrifice,
[1:19:55] holy and acceptable
[1:19:58] unto God, which is your reasonable
[1:20:01] service.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; What he has done, he's the master,
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; The servant isn't isn't above his
[1:20:08] master.
[1:20:12] We're not above the Lord.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; THE LORD JESUS HAD TO surrender
[1:20:19] everything. WE CALL HIM LORD BECAUSE HE
[1:20:22] SURRENDERED.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; And therefore, God
[1:20:28] exalted him
[1:20:31] up into the heavens higher than the
[1:20:33] heavens of heavens.
[1:20:35] He's exalted above every name.
[1:20:41] And everyone that is going to come and
[1:20:45] reign with HIM IN HIS THRONE AS THE BOOK
[1:20:47] OF REVELATION SAID WE WILL.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; We must come the way that he came.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; WE MUST OVERCOME AS HE OVERCAME. CAN YOU
[1:20:58] SAY
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN?
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; So the trials, the tribulations, the
[1:21:02] hardships, count them all with joy.
[1:21:05] I will follow Jesus Christ.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; I will not look to the left or the
[1:21:13] right. I will not be disenfranchised. I
[1:21:18] will not be Amen. UH PULLED THIS WAY OR
[1:21:21] PULLED THAT WAY. I WILL [screaming]
[1:21:23] FOLLOW HIM WITH ALL of my heart. So help
[1:21:26] me God. So help me. WHEN THE DEVIL'S
[1:21:30] FIGHTING YOU, AMEN, AND TORMENTING YOU
[1:21:32] AND TRYING TO PULL YOU THIS WAY AND PULL
[1:21:33] YOU THAT WAY, YOU JUST REMEMBER SATAN IS
[1:21:36] NO LONGER YOUR LORD. JESUS CHRIST is
[1:21:39] your Lord
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; and you follow him
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; and you walk with him.
[1:21:47] Can you say amen?
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:50] Be not conformed to this world, but be
[1:21:52] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:21:54] mind.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? that you may prove
[1:21:58] what is that good
[1:22:01] and acceptable
[1:22:03] and perfect
[1:22:05] will of window
[1:22:09] will
[1:22:11] of God.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; What was his first deal? Lay yourself on
[1:22:15] the altar. Offer your bodies as a living
[1:22:18] sacrifice.
[1:22:21] Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; So tonight,
[1:22:27] midweek,
[1:22:30] the devil can fight one way or fight
[1:22:32] another way, but that's all right. Amen.
[1:22:35] As Kobe sung that song, I have decided
[1:22:37] to follow Jesus.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; I have decided to follow Jesus. No
[1:22:43] turning back. No turning back. No. No
[1:22:45] one goes with me. Still, I'll follow. Is
[1:22:48] that right? Now, I'm not talking about
[1:22:51] I'm not talking about just coming to
[1:22:52] church and living a good life. I'm
[1:22:54] talking about knowing him in the power
[1:22:57] of his resurrection. I am dying in order
[1:23:00] to find the power that is in that
[1:23:03] resurrection. The the the gospel is the
[1:23:06] death, burial, and resurrection. It's
[1:23:10] the death, burial, and resurrection of
[1:23:12] Jesus. AND IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE BORN
[1:23:15] AGAIN, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A DEATH,
[1:23:16] BURIAL, AND A RESURRECTION.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [applause] AMEN.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; The gospel is quite simple. I deny
[1:23:24] myself.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Denying myself.
[1:23:30] Well, I've
[1:23:33] quit smoking and I've
[1:23:36] I've started living for the Lord and I
[1:23:38] and those are wonderful.
[1:23:42] Those are good.
[1:23:44] But the moment you stop, then you're no
[1:23:46] longer a disciple. The scripture says
[1:23:49] that there were many of those disciples
[1:23:52] who said this is a hard saying who can
[1:23:56] hear it and they followed him no more.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; In the children in the wilderness, the
[1:24:05] children of Israel had to follow that
[1:24:06] pillar of fire. And when they refused to
[1:24:09] follow the pillar of fire, they were
[1:24:10] left in the wilderness
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; without the presence of God.
[1:24:15] What is what has the church done
[1:24:17] throughout all these church ages? The
[1:24:18] pillar of fire has come. Amen. It's
[1:24:21] brought us in and then they would stop
[1:24:22] and denominate. And the pillar of fire
[1:24:24] says, "Sorry, I'm not a denomination.
[1:24:26] I'm going I've got a purpose for
[1:24:28] redeeming you. I'm taking you to glory."
[1:24:31] Stopping they they lost out. Amen. He'd
[1:24:34] raise up another group and they would
[1:24:35] follow for a while and then they'd stop
[1:24:37] and said, "This is God." And then they
[1:24:40] God just kept on moving until now here
[1:24:42] we are in this seventh church age and
[1:24:44] God has still moving. He's not dead.
[1:24:47] He's still moving and he's going to keep
[1:24:49] on moving until we make a rapture.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; And until then, we're going to see signs
[1:24:55] and wonders and miracles. We're going to
[1:24:58] see the glory of God. We're going to see
[1:24:59] it. Why? Because there are some people
[1:25:01] who have surrendered their wills to
[1:25:03] Christ.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen?
[1:25:08] Amen. There there in the book of of of
[1:25:11] um uh of Romans the the fourth chapter,
[1:25:13] I believe it is. Amen. That Jesus was
[1:25:16] declared to be the son of God by the
[1:25:18] resurrection from the dead. And so IS
[1:25:21] THE CHURCH DECLARED TO BE THE SON OF GOD
[1:25:23] BY the resurrection OUT OF THESE DARK
[1:25:25] DENOMINATIONALISM. AMEN. OUT OF THIS OUT
[1:25:27] OF THIS DARK PRISON HOUSE OF SIN, GOD'S
[1:25:31] WORD IS COMING. AND THIS DAY, THERE'S
[1:25:33] GOING TO BE SOME BODIES. THERE'S GOING
[1:25:34] TO BE A SON AND A DAUGHTER OF GOD THAT
[1:25:36] IS GOING TO STAND UP IN THIS DAY AND
[1:25:38] WE'RE GOING TO DECLARE THE MESSAGE OF
[1:25:40] THE HOUR AND WE'RE GOING TO SAY, "AMEN.
[1:25:42] YOU HOUSE OF HELL, [screaming]
[1:25:44] GIVE WAY IN THE NAME OF JESUS."
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; HE'S ANOINTED US FOR THIS. HE'S ANOINTED
[1:25:50] US TO HEAL THE SICK AND RAISE THE DEAD.
[1:25:52] HE'S ANOINTED US.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE AMEN. BUT THE IT TAKES THE
[1:25:59] DYING [screaming] OUT. IT TAKES A
[1:26:01] CRUCIFIXION.
[1:26:02] IT TAKES a time.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Here I am, Lord, surrendering everything
[1:26:10] that I've got to you.
[1:26:13] Sometimes it takes it takes a lot of
[1:26:16] faith.
[1:26:18] Amen. To stand up and say, you know
[1:26:20] what?
[1:26:23] I'm not going to sit in this house of
[1:26:24] gloom anymore. That's
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; right. I'm going to get up
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Spirit is the He's the
[1:26:32] resurrection and life.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; He doesn't live in a house of gloom and
[1:26:36] doom.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen?
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Well, you're living in a three- room
[1:26:42] house right now.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to refuse depression.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to refuse sickness.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ref I'm going to rise up
[1:26:50] and I'm going to let this sow. I'm going
[1:26:52] to let this sew. I'm going to open up
[1:26:54] the curtains and let sunshine into this
[1:26:56] soul.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Let the sun shine in. Can you say amen?
[1:27:01] This woe is me attitude is for the
[1:27:03] birds, man. There ain't no woe is me
[1:27:06] there. Jesus don't He didn't have a woe
[1:27:08] is me when he went to Calvary. Jesus was
[1:27:11] fulfilling scripture.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; AND THERE AIN'T NO [screaming] WOE IS ME
[1:27:15] ATTITUDE IN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:27:17] WE'RE FULFILLING SCRIPTURE.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN PROPHESIED THAT WE'RE GOING TO
[1:27:22] GO THROUGH IT. IT'S BEEN PROPHESIED
[1:27:23] [screaming]
[1:27:23] WE GOT TO GO THROUGH THE SQUEEZE. IT'S
[1:27:25] BEEN PROPHESIED THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE
[1:27:27] 200 MILLION DEMONS THAT'S GOING TO COME
[1:27:30] AGAINST YOU. BUT IT'S ALSO [screaming]
[1:27:32] BEEN PROPHESIED THEY SHALL NOT HAVE A
[1:27:34] HOLD OF YOU. [cheering]
[1:27:36] [applause]
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL NOT HAVE CONTROL OF YOU.
[1:27:41] YOU'RE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. THAT'S
[1:27:44] RIGHT.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; The crucifixion didn't defeat the
[1:27:52] purpose.
[1:27:54] The crucifixion fulfilled the purpose.
[1:28:01] [snorts]
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And he and he's a loser. The the the And
[1:28:04] I know I know he's got to be pretty
[1:28:06] smart. Satan is he's got to be pretty
[1:28:07] smart. He's, you know, he's got a lot of
[1:28:09] people following him.
[1:28:13] But it's like the Democrats. They've all
[1:28:14] got the
[1:28:17] Maybe I shouldn't have said. Let's
[1:28:18] retract that. It's just like these
[1:28:19] political parties. They they they they
[1:28:21] they hang on to the same old playbook
[1:28:24] that they've been using for teen years.
[1:28:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:34] And Satan thinks that he can destroy
[1:28:36] you. And he comes and he put and the
[1:28:37] more pressure he puts on you,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; the greater glory he's got. He's just
[1:28:42] pushing you to your destiny.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; He's pushing you to your purpose.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; So the APOSTLE PAUL SAYS, "THEREFORE,
[1:28:51] [screaming] I WILL GLORY." SOMEBODY SAY,
[1:28:54] "GLORY
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; IN MINE INFIRMITIES.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; I'll glory in them. I'M GOING TO GLORY
[1:29:00] IN MY TRIALS. I'M GOING TO GLORY IN MY
[1:29:02] PERSECUTIONS. I'M GOING TO GLORY WHEN MY
[1:29:04] MIND FEELS LIKE IT'S ABOUT TO FALL
[1:29:06] APART. I'M GOING TO GLORY IN THEM
[1:29:07] BECAUSE I KNOW [screaming] WHAT THEY'RE
[1:29:09] DOING. THEY ARE TAKING ME TO my eternal
[1:29:12] hope and that GLORY BEYOND THE RIVER.
[1:29:16] OH, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? CAN YOU SHOUT
[1:29:19] [screaming] HALLELUJAH? [cheering]
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE UNDER AN ANOINTING.
[1:29:23] YOU'RE UNDER A MANDATE FROM GOD TO CAST
[1:29:26] OUT THE DEVILS. YOU'RE UNDER [screaming]
[1:29:28] A MANDATE FROM GOD.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A CRUCIFIED
[1:29:34] LIFE.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:40] AMEN.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're at a Gethsemane here
[1:29:44] tonight. Maybe you're there where you
[1:29:45] can't hardly go any further. Hallelujah.
[1:29:48] Stay there.
[1:29:50] Maybe you can't get your friends to pray
[1:29:52] with you. Maybe you can't get [laughter]
[1:29:56] no one to understand the agony that
[1:29:57] you're in. Hallelujah.
[1:30:00] Amen.
[1:30:04] But it's in those dark times
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; that God comes shining through.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; God bless you if the musicians would
[1:30:13] come.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:18] Glory to God.
[1:30:22] Amen.
[1:30:24] Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:30:27] Follow thou me.
[1:30:30] Follow me.
[1:30:34] He's the shepherd. He knows where he's
[1:30:36] taking you. He knows what he's got for
[1:30:38] you. [snorts]
[1:30:40] We're going to follow him.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; I'll go with him
[1:30:45] through
[1:30:47] the trial.
[1:30:51] I'll go with
[1:30:54] them through
[1:30:57] the trial.
[1:31:03] I'll go with
[1:31:06] him through
[1:31:09] the trial.
[1:31:15] I'll go with him
[1:31:19] with him [singing]
[1:31:22] all
[1:31:25] the way.
[1:31:28] Where you lead [singing and music] me,
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; I
[1:31:37] I'm going to follow you, Jesus.
[1:31:40] Where you lead me.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; It's where you lead [music] me.
[1:31:52] Where you lead me.
[1:31:56] I
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; many times it's
[1:32:10] your crosses may [music] be different.
[1:32:13] Your cross is different than Jesus.
[1:32:16] He was the [music] perfect son of God
[1:32:17] who gave his life for all of us.
[1:32:22] For me as a young man
[1:32:26] having a
[1:32:27] being a songwriter
[1:32:30] musician [music]
[1:32:32] had to turn my focus.
[1:32:34] I had to say no.
[1:32:37] even [music] given a given a shot
[1:32:41] to go perform
[1:32:46] and one of our nation's most prestigious
[1:32:48] [music]
[1:32:51] country
[1:32:56] platforms, the Grand [music] Opry.
[1:33:05] But that wasn't God's will for me.
[1:33:08] I had to I had to die to that.
[1:33:21] I had to die [music] to that
[1:33:26] those feelings of wanting to get out and
[1:33:28] make a bunch [music] of money.
[1:33:31] Nothing wrong with making money. If
[1:33:34] you're going to make a If you're going
[1:33:35] to make money, you might as well make a
[1:33:36] bunch. Amen.
[1:33:40] But God don't want us chasing the mighty
[1:33:41] dollar.
[1:33:45] But I had to
[1:33:48] I had to lay it all down.
[1:33:52] [music] And one of the times when I was
[1:33:54] in my
[1:33:57] hardest of struggles,
[1:34:00] hardest of struggles,
[1:34:04] Oh, I was struggling [music]
[1:34:07] because the money was there and the
[1:34:09] opportunity and the green light. I had
[1:34:11] it. It was there. [music]
[1:34:28] And I was just I I I'd already made up
[1:34:30] my mind. And I'd already I mean I my
[1:34:32] mind was well I I thought it was made
[1:34:35] up. I
[1:34:38] It's going to be a walk in the park,
[1:34:40] man. I've been waiting for this for a
[1:34:43] long time.
[1:34:47] I get a phone call.
[1:34:52] Someone out of town, not even knowing
[1:34:54] what they don't even go to church here.
[1:34:57] His first question or his first remark
[1:35:00] was, [music] "Brother Wendle, how are
[1:35:02] you?" "Fine.
[1:35:06] I am grieved in my spirit
[1:35:11] that you would put God and your ministry
[1:35:14] on the sideline just so that you can go
[1:35:16] out and make some [music] money."
[1:35:21] And did he wear me out?
[1:35:26] And did he make me mad?
[1:35:37] [music]
[1:35:41] I was in my Gethsemane.
[1:35:45] [music] I was in my time that God had me
[1:35:47] right there.
[1:35:49] I'm going to tell you, you don't go to
[1:35:50] just Gethsemane one time in your [music]
[1:35:52] life. There's going to be many of times
[1:35:53] in your life where you're going to be at
[1:35:55] that garden and you're right there.
[1:35:57] You've got to make your crossroad.
[1:35:58] You've got to make your decisions. You
[1:36:00] are there.
[1:36:06] You've got to make that choice to follow
[1:36:07] the Lord.
[1:36:11] You got to make that choice.
[1:36:17] I can say I've got it. I've gone through
[1:36:19] through life many of times. I've I've
[1:36:21] experienced it many of times. So, I know
[1:36:22] what I'm saying here tonight.
[1:36:27] There may be somebody here, maybe you're
[1:36:29] at your crossroads.
[1:36:33] Maybe you've already given your life to
[1:36:34] the Lord, but you're you're needing to
[1:36:37] keep on following.
[1:36:39] Maybe you've [music] been serving the
[1:36:40] Lord for a long time, but God's dealing
[1:36:43] with your heart tonight, saying, "Hey,
[1:36:45] I'm over here.
[1:36:49] Just follow on [music] to and know the
[1:36:51] Lord.
[1:36:53] Do you love him here tonight?
[1:36:57] [music]
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Scripture says, "Some through the fire,
[1:36:59] some through the floods,
[1:37:03] some through great trial." [music]
[1:37:07] Maybe that's not scripture. Maybe that's
[1:37:08] a song. I don't know. Amen. But all
[1:37:11] through the blood. Is that a scripture,
[1:37:12] brother Merl? [music]
[1:37:18] But we going to go
[1:37:22] don't want to attribute something to God
[1:37:23] that wasn't put in the book, but we go
[1:37:27] through it, don't we?
[1:37:31] But just to know that I'm a son of God.
[1:37:33] No matter where I'm at or what I'm going
[1:37:35] through, I might be having I I might be
[1:37:38] having a migraine out of of just just
[1:37:41] about out of my head. just just just
[1:37:43] about to just about to blow off. It
[1:37:45] seems I bet I can know that faithful is
[1:37:48] he. [music]
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; I can go through those trials and but I
[1:37:56] know my anchor holds.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say [music] amen?
[1:38:02] World's in an upset condition right now.
[1:38:04] Amen. with with uh with this shutdown
[1:38:07] [music] and of food stamps and and a lot
[1:38:10] of government jobs. It's it's affected.
[1:38:11] Even brother Nathaniel, he's on furlow,
[1:38:16] no pay,
[1:38:19] ain't going to get reimbursed.
[1:38:23] I mean, things
[1:38:29] things can [music] get tough for the
[1:38:31] righteous,
[1:38:33] but this is where we [music] see the
[1:38:35] supernatural come in.
[1:38:40] I'm not a fan. I'm just not a fan of
[1:38:42] Republican or Democrat. [music] I'm just
[1:38:44] not a fan.
[1:38:50] But I am a fan [music]
[1:38:52] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:38:56] [applause]
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And when I don't understand it, I can
[1:39:03] [music] still trust him.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; You understand? When you can't trust
[1:39:06] your government, you don't know who you
[1:39:08] do.
[1:39:11] You can put your trust in Jesus. Even
[1:39:12] though Jesus is holding his hand back
[1:39:14] for a minute, you can know that it's
[1:39:16] [music] going to be all right. I'm not
[1:39:18] in a Democrat's hand. I'm not in a
[1:39:20] Republican's hand. I'm in the Lord's
[1:39:22] hand.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; I've made my vow to him
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; because of him. I have [music]
[1:39:32] confidence.
[1:39:34] God bless you tonight.
[1:39:37] All [singing]

[1:39:42] where he leads me.
[1:39:46] [singing]
[1:39:47] I

[1:39:54] where he leads [singing]
[1:39:57] [music]
[1:39:58] me. I
[1:40:01] will [singing] follow.
[1:40:05] [music]
[1:40:06] Where he leads me,
[1:40:11] where he leads me, I will follow.
[1:40:19] I'll go with him.
[1:40:23] With him
[1:40:27] all [singing] the way.
[1:40:32] Hallelujah.
[1:40:35] Well, [music] praise the Lord. Do you

[1:40:58] And Lord Jesus, [music] it's an honor to
[1:41:01] follow you.

[1:41:17] We thank you for it all, Father.
[1:41:20] Our desire is to follow you,

[1:41:25] you here tonight.
[1:41:28] We're coming [music] back to Calvary
[1:41:30] again. And when you say, "Lord,
[1:41:33] this was the place where it all this is
[1:41:35] where it all happened. This is where
[1:41:36] [music]
[1:41:37] our salvation was was bought. This is
[1:41:41] where you willingly laid [music] down
[1:41:43] your life for us.
[1:41:47] We're going to retrace those steps.
[1:41:51] Lord, we want to die right there at
[1:41:53] Calvary with you.

[1:42:08] no matter what the enemy brings [music]
[1:42:10] against us, we know that no matter what
[1:42:13] you allow,
[1:42:16] your divine [music] grace, miracles, the
[1:42:18] supernatural will be with us.
[1:42:22] [music] We thank you for it, Father.
[1:42:25] We love you with all of our heart
[1:42:30] in [music] Jesus name.
[1:42:34] Hallelujah.

[1:45:03] [singing]
[1:45:06] As we dismiss, we'll

[1:45:13] step across the aisle and tell somebody
[1:45:16] you love them. Not in a
[1:45:19] not in a loud [music] noisy way, but a a
[1:45:21] brotherly way. And I think that should
[1:45:23] be in any kind of service when we're
[1:45:25] greeting one another. It shouldn't be
[1:45:26] loud and boisterous. It shake someone's
[1:45:29] [music] hand if they want to do that in
[1:45:30] music. And
[1:45:35] but just shake your [music] neighbor's
[1:45:37] hand.
[1:45:39] There's not too many of us.
[1:45:42] And I'm glad to be associated with every
[1:45:44] one of you.
