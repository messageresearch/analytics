Praise the Lord. good to um uh serve the Lord and know him in the power of his resurrection. No matter what the the the future holds, we we know that he is uh doing something very special in our lives. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh we're we're going to look here um Daniel 3 and 1. It says Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits and he set it up in the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent together the princes, the governors and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Then the princes, the governors, the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all of the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. They stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Then in Herald cried out, to you it is commanded, oh people, nations, and languages, that at one time ye hear the sound of the cornet, the flute, harp, uh the sacbut, the sultry, doulamer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down, and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. And whosoever fallth not doubt and worship uh worshipeth the same hour will be cast in the midst of the burning fiery furnace. Therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the cornet flute harp sack but sultry and all kinds of music all the people the nations and the languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Wherefore at that time certain Chaldans came near and accused the Jews. They spake saying and said to King Nea Nebuchadnezzar, "Oh king, live forever. Thou, oh king, hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, heart, sac, sultry, doulamer, and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image. And who so fleth not down and worshipeth that he should be cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. There are certain Jews here who um whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon. Shadrach, Meach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have not regarded thee. They serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. And they brought these men before the king. And Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, "Is it true, oh Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego? Do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? Now if you be ready that at what time ye hear um all of the music and fall down and worship the image which I have made. Wow. But if you worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour in the midst of the burning fiery furnace. Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, "Oh Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter, if it be so that our God uh our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, oh king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we just want to thank you today for your goodness, for your blessings. Thank you, Lord, for always being faithful to us. For Lord, when things around us get a little shaky or we're in the trial or Lord, the circumstances around us may be uncertain, you have always been good to us, Lord. And Father, we ask here today that your Holy Spirit, Lord, would would accept our love and our praise as we have given it to you. And Lord, we ask that you would speak to our hearts. And Lord, that you would establish our hearts in you. Father, we love you with all of our heart in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated here tonight. Amen. We have for a title, we rejoice in the day of small things. And of course that is coming from a scripture. Amen. There in that was being spoke of a man. Um talking of to Zerubabel who hath despised the day of small things. &gt;&gt; And um u and so we we don't want to despise the day of small things. We don't want to as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego had had uh uh were definitely the minority in this situation. They were they of all the nations of the earth. Now, Babylon was the greatest nation of all the earth. And and all of the nations were required to come in for this. This was a this was not just a little backyard um potluck. this this here was a uh this was a major thing &gt;&gt; and um but yet the three young men there they stood their purpose they stood their convictions and we find that this day though they were totally outnumbered and though they were totally in the minority this particular day Amen. man is a day that is forever engraved in history &gt;&gt; because this is the day where three men brought the son of God down to earth and and he visibly manifested his glory in a pagan nation. Amen. And brought the king to his knees. &gt;&gt; It it was it was a time where it it it was all of the other Jews. Amen. They all had fallen. They were all bowing. They They felt Amen. They They fell under the pure pressure. But these men, they stood there for their convictions. &gt;&gt; Amen. And And God would come in a great and mighty day. So, Amen. The question is IS WHO HAS DESPISED the day of small things? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD CAME IN. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "IT'S not by might nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS IN THIS IT WAS IN THIS DAY THAT of overwhelming uh um uh pressure upon them that they stood up and and God came in such an incredible way. And we understand that they turned the the heat up seven times more. Amen. And when they threw the men in, it even killed the guys that were that were uh throwing them in the fire. It killed all of the guards. Amen. Because it was so hot. And and and so they throw him in the fire. And and the um Amen. the 20 the the 21st verse. Amen. It it says, "Then these men were bound in their coats and their hoses and and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace." Therefore, because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the fiery furnace. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste and spake and said unto the counselors, "Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?" And they answered and said unto the king, "True, O king." He answered and said, "Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire. &gt;&gt; They have no hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God." Then Nebuchadnezzar came to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said, "Shadrach, Meshack, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth and come hither." Then Shadrach, Meach, and Abednego, come forth in the midst of the fire. And the princes and the governors and the captains and the king's counselors being gathered together saw these men. Now, it started out they were the least. It started out a day of small things, but it ends up a pretty big day. &gt;&gt; And he says, "TOGETHER SAW THESE men upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an air of their head singed, neither were the coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them." Then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted him, and has changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own god." &gt;&gt; We can see here that there was a amen the how God can turn things around for when God with God. Amen. And the minority becomes a majority. &gt;&gt; The minority becomes a majority. And sometimes we feel like we're in the minority in our situations. But remember, with God, you're the majority. &gt;&gt; It didn't matter all the kings. It didn't matter all the kingdoms. It didn't matter. Amen. All of the counselors and all of the music. It didn't matter how how how much they were dancing and how much they were doing their little voodoo. Amen. When it come DOWN TO IT, ONE, THE PRESENCE of God coming on the scene because there were three men that held to their guns in conviction, it forever more changed the history. And that story has been told thousands of years. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? YOU SEE, BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY, I WANT YOU TO NOTICE he does it that way in EVERY AGE. HE DOES IT EVERY TIME BY the same method. He has to take believers and then in order to have believers to meet that word, he's got to predestinate it to that age. You see it? He's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age. Did it get you? Did you do you feel it? Do you see it? Do you UNDERSTAND IT? THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. He's predestinated to this by his fornowledge. And it has to come. The rapture IS IS GOING TO BE A SEASON where Amen. YOU ARE LIKE THOSE THREE HEBREW children in the midst of this world. AMEN. THE ODDS ARE GOING TO BE STACKED AGAINST YOU. But I'm here to tell you, don't despise the day of small things. &gt;&gt; Amen. as the day started, amen, on that fateful day. Amen. We're the greatest nation putting on that incredible event. But those three guys, well, thank God for those three guys that stunk to their guns. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You see, THERE'S THERE'S THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT as as we have stolen Amen. or or or used this this slogan, who hath despised the day of small things. IT WAS ACTUALLY SOMETHING that as the spirit of the Lord had said to Zerubabel as he was trying to build the temple. AND HE WAS SO discouraged at the rebuilding of this temple because Amen. He it seemed like he was all alone and there were amen the enemy and and the forces against him. It it just really discouraged him. AND WHAT GOD HAD TOLD HIM, HE SAID, "LISTEN, AMEN. THOUGH GREAT MOUNTAIN, though you be great, who shall stand before the God of Zerubabel?" THERE IS A GREAT MOUNTAIN. AND THEN HE LOOKS TO Zerubabel and he says, "Not by might NOR BY POWER, BUT BY MY SPIRIT, SAYS THE LORD. FOR IT IS NOT GOING TO BE A DAY OF SMALL things too very long. I'm fixing to show my power. Well, praise the Lord. AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS AS HE WAS TYPING OUT, AMEN. typing out the seven church ages and Amen. And he SAYS AS THE CAPSTONE IS COMING DOWN, THERE'S GOING TO BE A SHOUTING GRACE, GRACE. AMEN. Unmmerited favor. The church is going to see, amen, the supernatural power of God IN THEIR LIVES JUST AS ZERUBABEL. Now we understand, AMEN, THAT OUR ZERUBABEL was Malachi 4, the restoration as Malachi, Amen. four had or as as Zerubabel had lay had to relay THE FOUNDATION, BUILT UPON THE OLD FOUNDATION, AND WAS NOW PROPHESIED TO LAY THE CAPSTONE, THE HEADSTONE. AMEN. SO WAS IT PROPHESIED IN OUR DAY THAT THERE would be a restoration that there would be a Zerubabel a prophet message. Amen. To lay AGAIN THE OLD FOUNDATION but also this WOULD BE THE CAPPING OFF of the church. This would be the time where the church WOULD RISE IN ITS POWER WHERE SONS OF GOD WOULD COME BACK INTO AUTHORITY. WHERE THERE WOULD BE A DOMINION. AMEN. AND WE reign upon this earth. And I believe that day is right here where we are at. Amen. Don't get disillusioned by things around you. Don't get delusion. Amen. Disillusioned by losing your job or wondering about this deal with the government. Amen. Let me TELL YOU SOMETHING. GOD IS IN CONTROL. GOD HAS GOT TO ALLOW THESE THINGS TO COME. THERE'S GOT TO BE DARKNESS IN ORDER FOR the light to prevail. &gt;&gt; There's got to be these things in our lives. Amen. But remember, we stand upon thus sayaith the Lord because there is a divine purpose RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW THAT IS TAKING PLACE in your situation and in the bride of Jesus Christ. Now remember the church is not this building. The church is made up of individuals. individuals that the Holy Spirit is building up, THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT is maturing because we are at the we ARE AT THE CLOSING. WE ARE AT THE FINISH LINE. We are here at THE VERY END. AND GOD IS LOOKING FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE GOING TO STAND BY GOD IN FAITH. And you're going TO SEE A GRACE upon your life like you've never seen it before. Amen. Now in the identified ages uh uh Christ of all ages 64. Amen. Brother Brandham said to redeem anything is to bring it back. Where it's fallen from and went from redeem it. Bring it back. The way you look or or or or who you are and or what your name IS THAT WAS GOD'S THINKING BEFORE THE foundation of the world. So he's he's he's telling you, AMEN. YOUR SITUATION RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU ARE, God knew you. You were in HIS THINKING. AND JESUS CAME NOT TO SAVE THE WHOLE THING. He wanted to, but he come to redeem or to bring back them that was in his thoughts before the beginning. That's the reason he was the word made flesh. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. The word, GOD'S THINKING OF HOW HE WOULD DO IT. HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF in Jesus Christ. It was God becoming material. Can you say amen? Amen. So he's saying now there's a purpose for every one of us and THAT IS REDEMPTION. ANOTHER PLACE HE SAYS GOD WHEN WHEN HE WAS AN ALIEN WHEN I WAS AN ALIEN FROM HIM AND SO HE SO LOVED ME TILL HE STOOPED DOWN TO GET ME AND picked me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Did those three young men look at it as if God's wanting to use them? DID DID WERE WERE THEY JUST AMEN. LISTEN, I AM SURE I AM POSITIVE THAT THOSE MEN WEREN'T THINKING THAT GOD WAS using them for some special purpose. THEY WERE IN THE TRIAL OF THEIR LIFE. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? BUT THE PROPHET SAYS GOD DIDN'T JUST SAVE [screaming] YOU. HE PULLED YOU OUT SO THAT HE CAN SHOW his glory in your life. I just want to tell you, Amen. It would make YOU WANT TO SHOUT AND REJOICE a little bit more if you BEGIN TO SEE YOUR LIFE IS totally in HIS HANDS. YOUR SITUATIONS ARE TOTALLY IN his hands. HE DESIGNS IT. HE ALLOWS IT. HE BRINGS THESE THINGS IN SO THAT his glory can be revealed in you. Can you say amen? He says he's got a purpose in doing it. He's seen something in me. He's seen something in you. He had a reason to save you. Look at the people unsaved today. Look at the millions he could have took besides you, but he took you. AMEN. NO ONE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. You're in God's economy. NO ONE CAN DO IT. THAT'S HIS love to you. &gt;&gt; That's his love to those three Hebrew. Hallelujah. Amen. Every kid, every kid in Sunday school has taught about Shadrach, Meak, AND ABEDNEGO. THAT'S GOD'S love to those three men that he chose to stand against the odds. And in this finality of redemption, the message IS SO CRUCIAL. THIS MESSAGE IS crucial to you as the elect.

HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOUR POSITION, YOUR PLACE, you setting IN THE POSITION THAT GOD HAS ORDAINED FOR YOU in your promised land is so important. Just as the natural Exodus had to take place before there could be a Messiah there. They they were in the wrong land. Israel was in the land of Egypt. They were in the wrong land in order to receive THE MESSIAH. SO GOD HAD TO DO SOMETHING. AMEN. AND CAUSED THE PEOPLE TO COME BACK TO THEIR LAND. AND THERE IS WHERE GOD'S promise was and God raised up a Moses for that. Well, can you say amen? EVEN IN OUR DAY, EVEN IN OUR OUR OUR GENERATION, AMEN. You listen. JESUS, LET'S JUST GO BACK. JESUS COULD NOT EVEN COME TO to to become the Messiah unless Israel was in the promised land. There was no other way around it. Amen. Because the land was just as important to God AS THE MESSIAH.

Amen. &gt;&gt; So the patriarchs knew that. Amen. Jacob says, "Don't leave my bones here in e in Egypt." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joseph said, "Don't leave my bones here in Egypt. Take me back. THE PROMISE IS COMING. &gt;&gt; TAKE ME BACK TO that homeland because there is where the Messiah." Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, WHY DID GOD HAVE TO HARDEN PHARAOH'S HEART? WHY DID GOD ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? &gt;&gt; Why did God HAVE TO HARDEN Pharaoh's heart? IS FOR ISRAEL TO BECOME AMEN. TO PUT THE THE PEOPLE BACK IN THEIR PROMISED LAND SO THAT he could bless them and bring forth the Messiah to them. HALLELUJAH. SO, THERE HAD TO BE, "WE DON'T WANT TO STAY IN this world. &gt;&gt; Come [snorts] on. &gt;&gt; I don't want to stay in this world. I know you don't want to stay in this world. And we've been promised a homeland. We've been promised a rapture. AND WE'RE PREPARING. NOW, NOW, NOW THERE'S THERE'S A LOT GOING ON." AMEN.

Nero was quite certain that the most important things happening in Rome were his words and his laws and Amen. and the things that he accomplished. Amen. Nero was was the great emperor in Rome. But in all reality, the really big things now that we look back through history, there was the saints gathering in catacombs, in prayer meetings, calling unto God, and there was a supernatural something that was taking place that was fixing to birth a worldwide move. Amen. Well, can you say amen? You see, Amen. I I I have a few things here down through history. The the Medici brothers, Amen, must have seemed like they were the key figures in Europe.

I WONDER IF THE REAL NEWS IS A BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST WHO WAS BEING PREPARED TO GO IN A RAPTURE FOR A BODY CHANGE. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Being prepared. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist must have seemed very small and insignificant to Herod. There Herod prouncing around with all of his pomp and power and whenever he went around people bowed and you know waiting for a no a nod from the trearch and and yet and this Herod ended up killing John ended up killing John for his message. But when Jesus was telling the disciples after he was telling the disciples, he's saying, "Listen now, I know you all are looking at John and he's been in prison and he's but there is not a greater there is not a greater man born of a woman than that John the Baptist." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For he was called to forerun the the the coming of the Lord. Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, now, now think about that.

Totally overshadowed that old man by the name of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Totally overshadowed him. &gt;&gt; They were DOWN THERE WITH ALL OF THEIR WITH WITH ALL OF ALL OF THAT. AND here Abraham WAS CONSIDERED SO WEIRD AND SO INSIGNIFICANT. AND IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF LOT. AND EVEN Jesus would say that it would be the same AS THIS DAY &gt;&gt; AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF LOT. WHEN WHEN WHEN SODOM AND GOMORRAH [screaming] AND ALL OF THE SIN AND THE PLEASURE HAD OVERSHADOWED Abraham and his promise, &gt;&gt; so is the son of man going to return and talk to you and give life to you &gt;&gt; just like he spoke to Abwell.

Can you say, "Amen." You see, many times we despise these things. And the way we despise them is we don't see our trials or the situations the way that we should. You see, we're looking at these things as why me? But this is where you've got to start looking through the open book. If you're taking your sickness as if why me? Where's God? You're missing the point. You're not a child that has to be instructed. You're the beautiful lady. YOU'RE THE BEAUTIFUL BRIDE OR YOU'RE THE matured son. You're not under a tutor.

And you know that the word of God tells you that you've got to have a positive attitude and you refuse to get up and open your shades. Hallelujah. Turn the lights on and get that gloomy spirit out of that house so that you amen can pro show forth a miracle. AMEN. BUT IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SIT THERE AND LAY THERE AND WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW THE DEVIL TO JUST AMEN JUST ROT AWAY AT OUR FAITH. BUT IT'S THE IT'S THE DAY OF SMALL [screaming] THINGS. SERUM, I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG MOUNTAIN, BUT IT'S A DAY [screaming] OF SMALL THINGS. OH, CHURCH, NEW LIFE OUTREACH. I KNOW THE MOUNTAINS MAY LOOK BIG, BUT IT'S A DAY OF SMALL THINGS. GET THE [screaming] SMALL THINGS. THERE'S GRACE FOR THE SMALL THINGS. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A DAY of eternal victory in your life. [applause] IT'S THOSE DAYS of those little things that gnaw at our conscience. Amen. That's eroding our faith. &gt;&gt; Come on now. But you see, don't forget the fact Trump's in the headlines and he's loving it. He just loves it. And just in case y'all don't know, there had never been a war. Amen. There would have never been a war if he had been president. Amen. Just in case he's not told you that. [snorts] There he's got all kind He's just He's proud of himself and he he's Hallelujah. And there's a lot of headlines of hate and a lot of headlines of love. &gt;&gt; But in between that, Trump isn't the focus of the hour. &gt;&gt; Russia is not the focus of the hour. In fact, in fact, the Bible says in these days it's going to be wars and rumors of wars and there's no peace negotiations going to do anything. &gt;&gt; And the prophets already told us that our economy is going to tank. It's got to tank. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. SO WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND done and you're looking back, when you're looking back, &gt;&gt; will it matter? I TELL YOU WHAT.

And and and I could just go on and on and on. I was just looking up 93. It was quite an eventful deal. There was quite a there was it was quite an eventful deal. No one even knew the little lay member. How many's ever heard of John um John Lei? Well, we all know John Lay. John Lay is the little old guy that got a big belly on him now, but man, he's not a preacher. He's not he's he's not John Lei just had a burden for the Chinese to get the message into the Chinese. John Lei would take time off of work, take his vacation time, and he would stack his his his suitcase full of message books. Amen. And would go into China. And the Lord would blind the eyes of those guys as he was taking these messages into China. Done it over and over. And he was going around just he had had a few of these message books.

There were all of these things going on and yes he was cheating on his wife with all of those women BUT WE AIN'T ALL OF THAT WAS GOING ON. No one even knew the name of brother John Lei. He still lives today. &gt;&gt; What was the big thing? One soul is worth 10,000 worlds. &gt;&gt; John Lelay BROUGHT THE MESSAGE. HE WAS NOT EVEN A PREACHER. &gt;&gt; YEAH. But he didn't despise the day. &gt;&gt; He didn't despise the day of small things. Listen to me, young people. Don't despise the day of small things. Those small prayer meetings will lead to huge power. That small dedication to the Lord. Amen. And that keeping yourself not not not not as close to the world as you can, but as far away from the world as you can. and walking with God in humility and prayer and consecration. Listen, you cannot put a seed of CONSECRATION INTO THE GROUND AND you not reap the eternal glories of God. You cannot DO IT. DON'T LIE, DON'T LET THIS UH UH uh devil lie to you. AMEN. IF YOU DEDICATE YOURSELF TO GOD, GOD [screaming] WILL MEET YOU. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; HE WILL [screaming] MEET YOU. &gt;&gt; BUT SOMEBODY'S GOT TO NOT THEY'VE GOT TO QUIT. AMEN.

But brother Brandham uh but you remember when he was preaching that that service and and um um uh birth pains, birth painans. Now, now, Brother Brandham is is is is wanting to preach birth pains and um and and and he he can't get his book. He can't find the scripture. Y'all remember that? &gt;&gt; He's looking for the scripture and he can't find the scripture. And uh and and his his wife had just bought him a new Bible and and he's man, he he asked the other brothers. He says, "I man, there it is. The page there's here's this page." And I turn it over and there they did not put that page in my Bible. and uh uh and and and just couldn't find him, you know, and if he was fumbling around for a long time and it was a Catholic priest. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I think sometimes we get we get too we get too upset too easy. &gt;&gt; We get too fuzzled too easy when God may be just want maybe in that little small thing right there. &gt;&gt; Right. this Catholic priest that brother Brandham says he had been watching him throughout the meetings and he said this guy is for sure not agreeing with me you know I mean and I would say that was probably true SO BUT HE COMES over with his Bible he comes he gets up comes across he said there's 200 preachers up there he says he comes over and you can hear him on the on on the on the dealers and and and just saying stay steady my son you know and uh the Lord is wanting to do something or something like he said, "Read out of my book." Well, Brother Brandham reads it. He gets he he reads the scripture he's wanting to read. Then he hands it back over to the priest and and and then he he goes on preaching and buddy did he preach a message. How many's ever heard birth painans? Oh my word, brother Brandham. It was it was beautiful. If you've not listened to birth pains lately, you need to go back and listen to birth painans. It was just an incredible message. Well, he comes the next day and then the Holy Spirit hits him and says, "This day, this scripture is fulfilled." Now, here he Now here he is. Jesus was handed he was handed the book by the priest. He read the book. Amen. And then he wrote he he read he read this the anointing. The spirit of the Lord is upon me anointed me to preach the gospel. And when he got through, he gave the book back and he said, "This day, this scripture is fulfilled, the spirit of the Lord come upon him and said that was prophetic that had to take place." Are y'all understanding me? And it become a major. Then you go back and listen. Go back and listen. Amen. in Jeffersonville when he preaches this day this scripture is fulfilled AND HE STANDS UP THERE UNDER THE SIGN OF MELCHAZDC, REMEMBER? AND HE TURNS HIS BACK TO THE AUDIENCE and begins TO TO PERFORM THE THE THE SON OF MAN SIGN RIGHT THERE. AND HE SAYS, [screaming] "THIS DAY, &gt;&gt; this scripture is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It never could have happened &gt;&gt; if it hadn't been for that one service." Sister Ma was so embarrassed. She got she told Brother Brandham on the way home, she said, "I was sweating. I was so embarrassed to watch you fumbling around. I just bought you that Bible." And they're of all Bibles. Amen. And when they went and looked that because it was a new Bible, it the pages were glued together. They were stuck. But see, God allowed that. &gt;&gt; God, you you know, you may be walking in a day. You may you [gasps] you may be thinking, "WHERE IS GOD?" YOU MAY BE THINKING, "WHY?" YOU [screaming] MAY BE ASKING, "WHAT? WHERE'S THIS GOING?" WHEN GOD IS LOOKING FOR YOU TO stand up in the off in in the in the opice of an open book, not a closed book. Closed book, you don't understand what's going on. Closed book, you you're just you're just hitting in the dark LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER NOMINAL CHRISTIANS. THIS ain't you. &gt;&gt; The revelation is here. You understand sicknesses are here to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; AND THAT YOU YOURSELF, NOT A PREACHER, YOU are going to overcome that devil. [applause] &gt;&gt; See, back in Pentecost, we were all following. We was all following the guys with the gifts. &gt;&gt; Prophesy over me. Hey, hey, hey, hey, lay hands over me. But the bride, it's not a one-man ministry anymore. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THE OPEN BOOK. WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ANGEL OF GOD. WE'VE GOT THIS BOOK AND IT HAS it has solidified our hearts. &gt;&gt; We know who we are. &gt;&gt; We not standing here just going, I don't know. I don't know. I just wish God I just wish God would do something. I just I don't know where I'm at. DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OH, COME ON. YOU DO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. YOU KNOW THE ENEMY IS FIGHTING. YOU KNOW THAT SATAN IS COMING AGAINST YOU. AND YOU know that the anointing IS UPON YOU TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY RIGHT NOW. [applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And if the prophet had to dedicate his life and dedicate and and be constant in prayer and consecration, if Jesus had to be constant in prayer and consecration, then I think that it should become a very much of a routine for you and me. &gt;&gt; Consecration before God. Some of you teenagers are here and maybe you're still trying to find purpose. [snorts] Maybe maybe you don't really know what you want to be yet. You don't know whether you're going to be a rocket scientist or a a policeman. And those are those are fine. Those are good times, though. I mean, well, they're not they're not good times. A lot of agony sometimes that you young men, young women go through in your minds, a lot of questions, a lot of things swirling. But I can remember back as a young man if there's anything that that helped me as I I chose the path of dedication, consecration, prayer. I didn't quite understand it all. I wasn't in the message, but that was something that I'd seen in mom and dad and the anointing upon their lives and the and the power of God in their lives. And I wanted that kind of a life upon me. And I knew that daddy couldn't give it to me and mama couldn't give it to me and my preacher couldn't give it to me. I knew that it could only come through a yielded vessel. And I I I say there was not a better time to do it than at this stage of life. Now, it's it's hard because you're fighting a lot of mind battles and there's a lot of things that you go through in your mind and sometimes when you're praying, Satan's telling you that you're you're a loser and you're always going to be a loser and you're praying, you know, but he but he's he's a he's a liar, man. Someone said one time, "Do you know c can you tell when when the devil's lying?" And I said, 'Well, well, what what tell me said, "When he opens his mouth." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, the devil's always going to lie. He's always going to God's not going to tell you you're worthless. &gt;&gt; The anointing would not even come upon you and then tell you you're worthless. &gt;&gt; The anointing will tell you you need to come up higher. The anointing will tell you you need to you need to quit doing this. The anointing will tell you, "Hey, you need to straighten up here. God's real." &gt;&gt; And God will God will come upon you and he'll begin to he'll he'll he'll he'll weed things out in your life. You won't even have to have a you won't even have to have a preacher to it. It's it that that Holy Spirit will produce holiness in your life. &gt;&gt; It'll produce holiness in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'LL MAKE GOD'S way the absolute, it'll make God's way your only way that that you'll ever want to live. SO, SO AS AS YOU BEGIN TO CONSECRATE YOURSELF, and I don't think you're too young to do it. I know the Holy Spirit really started dealing with my life when I was 11, 12 years old. Amen. And about that time to where the spirit of the Lord really dealt with me. And and and mom's advice was was Wendle, if while the Lord's dealing with you, you need to really spend time in prayer. Get get along. Get alone. And uh uh I shared a room with my brother and and so lots of times I was in the closet. Hallelujah. And I I I'd go in there and I'd pray, but I was still a little inhibited thinking that he was listening to me praying or someone else was listening to me praying besides God. And uh and so I I so I I got me a key to the church and got my back and I would drive down to the church on a daily basis and I'd go down and I had my time of prayer. What was I doing? I was taking advantage of the day of small things. I wasn't a preacher. I wasn't even writing songs. I was learning the guitar. I was But I wanted I wanted God's approval in my life. If you feel the anointing upon your life, and I believe there comes a time in you young people's lives where you're going to feel that anointing because you're the elect of God. And when the anointing comes down upon your lives, don't despise that little something that God is doing and and and and and doing in your heart. I'm telling you, once you get to where you're you you know, you you ask you you can ask ask Dylan now that he's working full-time, it's a little bit harder to pray, right? Ask Austin now that he's married full-time. Hallelujah. And uh Rose says, "No, you should be asking me." Amen. And uh uh but it is it is there is not a better time to root yourself in the things of God than right now. &gt;&gt; There's not a better time. And in order to walk with God, you've got to root out those things that are displeasing, that you know are not right. When you start walking with God, you start praying. I promise you, if you've been telling lies, the Holy Spirit's just going to in your soul. He's going to tell you, and you are either going to quit praying or you're going to have to go make some confession to mammas and daddy or whoever. say, "Listen, I I I've been alive." &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S THAT DAY OF SMALL THINGS. GOD'S REVEALING those little foxes, those little things in your life that if you'll take care of those things right now and you begin to repent right now and you start walking with God right now, there is no telling what God can do for you. Amen. When when you become a young man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Right. &gt;&gt; I WAS I WAS ALREADY I WAS ALREADY SAVING SOULS HERE IN PAWNE. YOU KNOW, I WAS 19 YEARS OLD uh driving driving that car. We was talking about that back in the office. And congratulations, brother Caleb, on that nice fancy car he's bought. Amen. We're we're we're thankful for brother Caleb. [applause] and uh yeah, you know, looking at his car and then we got this, you know, one of them's got a F-250 and then there's or F-150 and uh I've got the 250 and uh but and they've got they've got these, you know, all all these all these young people with their cars and nice cars and I said, I remember when I was 19, we uh we had just gotten married and we were we were driving back and forth from from Prior, Oklahoma to Pawne. We were just doing uh prayer meetings, Bible studies up here. And uh uh there was hardly ever a time that our car didn't break down and we'd be stuck on the highway. Uh we didn't have phones with lights, folks. That that was that was way back in the pre Amen. It was it was a it was that day with no lights. Amen. No lights, no cell phones. And uh uh it would be dark out there on that highway. uh whether you was going to, you know, to Cleveland or whether you was going out there on the turnpack and and I and I remember that. BUT BUT THAT WAS BUT THAT WAS BUT WE WERE DOING SOMETHING FOR THE LORD. Doing something FOR THE LORD. NOW THAT WAS A DAY OF BIG things for me. See, I had all we we had been praying and and those kinds of things and I was BEING ABLE TO HELP. NOW TO SOMEBODY ELSE, NO, it wasn't a day of big things for them. They were thinking, "Ah, you know, give that little boy something to do. Get him out of our hair. Amen. But see, I was taking that seriously AND I WAS BAPTIZING PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I was I I was I was I was I I was I I was putting them uh uh leading them to the Lord, doing everything I could. I HAD SOMETHING in my hand to do and I wasn't looking at, well, what about that preacher? What what that's not THE CASE. THE DEAL IS I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO. &gt;&gt; AND IF I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO, THEN LET ME DO IT WITH ALL OF MY HEART, MY MIND, my soul. &gt;&gt; Let me do it with everything. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So I say today as we are preparing to close and my message has gone a little bit differently than what I had planned, but amen. in this day of preparation for the rapture. It's the little things, girls, when y'all's doing your wedding. It's the little things that y'all want done. Right. Right. Hallelujah. Don't look at me as if y'all don't want [laughter] I've married a few people. Us guys don't care. you girls. Amen. And it's usually always, "Brother Wendle, don't keep us up there a long time." Amen. Now, BUT YOU'VE GOT ALL OF THESE preparations that you are doing. It's the little things that make up the wedding. Now, listen. The Lord Jesus is coming. He ain't marrying the girl down the road. He's marrying you. &gt;&gt; He's coming after you. And I understand that that that the that that the union is taking place here, but I'm saying that we're fixing to see him face to face. &gt;&gt; We're fixing to see his face. We're going to know exactly what he looks like. and we shall be like him &gt;&gt; for we shall see him as he is. &gt;&gt; Don't despise the day &gt;&gt; of small things. &gt;&gt; Oh, I could go on and on and on. Masams and daddies, don't despise it. Love these children while you've got them. They grow up quick. They grow up quick. Love them while you've got them. and make sure and all of you I you you get them name brand clothes if you want to get them give them buy them cars whatever you got to want to do but if they don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ by the time they move out of their your house &gt;&gt; it's going to be tough &gt;&gt; and I'm here to tell you take this very serious and it's not and tell them, "I've told you you need to do that. Go read that book. Go listen to that message." They need to see it in your life. &gt;&gt; They need to see it in your life. No schooling. Well, schooling is it. Schooling's it. Amen. By by you living that life. It's those small things that we live leave undone. &gt;&gt; It's those little prayer meetings that we live leave undone. It's that little uh devotion time that we live leave undone. And it and it and it and it's so easy for for us to do that. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, we're going home. &gt;&gt; We're going home. And I want to say here today, may we live under the anointing and influence of the Almighty God. Hallelujah. Well, glory to God. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; if the musicians would come. [crying] I think about these things sometimes. I think about those those things like that that I heard a story. Jason Jackson told me a story one time of his mother when she was a girl. Y'all heard Jason Jackson story of his mother when she was a girl. a girl um seven or eight years old and uh uh she she had uh her heart was racing so fast and they get her to the hospital and her and her and and her heart's quit her heart quits beating. They got they it it happens so quick that the doctor pulls out his pocketk knife, cuts her open, and starts massaging her heart. I said, "You're kidding." He said, "That's the absolute truth." But he saved her life. And and he done it so quickly and instinct. It was just so it was it was they said that was the only way it it could go. And I thought, why would the girl why would why why would that happen? And then why would God save spare the little girl? Why would God knew that Jason was going to be a a wonderful preacher of this message. It was a little thing there. It was just a little girl and and you can overlook that thing. But if that girl would have died there, what about all of the all of the hundreds of souls that Jason, Brother Jason Jackson, he's preached here for us. Wonderful preacher. We just don't Don't under over Don't ever underestimate [music] what God is doing right now in you. Right now, your situation. Maybe you can just right now in your situation. Maybe you're [music] looking at a bunch of small things. Has God put them in your life to show his glory through you? I say so. I say [music] so. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Satan has tried to take you out. Satan's tried to destroy you. Satan's [music] tried to take away your faith. But you can't be because you're the anointed of God. &gt;&gt; You're the anointed of God. You're just as predestinated and anointed as Jesus Christ was. &gt;&gt; Satan has not taken you out and he cannot take you out. We have a purpose. Let us rise. You say, "Well, you know, even, you know, if you get in trouble or you get, you know, something, well, you know, it's just No, God's allowed. God's talking to you. He's talking to you young people. You get in trouble on something or you get this, that, and the other, you know, what whatever he's he's talking to you. Don't despise that day. Let anything that God allows in your life, let it be that he's bringing you closer because this is bigger than Donald Trump [music] and this is bigger than the prime minister of Japan. This is bigger than the big beautiful bill. What's happening in this building here tonight is big. This is big. This is big. [music] This is the one that God come to earth for. He come to earth for you. All of this others cannon fodder. It's all going to burn. It's all going to burn. &gt;&gt; They'll still be having politics and having their wars and they're, [music] you know, shutting down the government. They'll do it again next year and and we may be gone by then. and they'll just they'll keep on doing it. That's just bunch of bozos. The big thing, the big thing is you cotton. The big thing is [snorts] that [music] boy right there. You're the big thing. You girls are the big thing. And God has seen [music] fit to bring you into this place because he's fixed to take us into a great This ain't [music] this ain't a lie. This ain't this ain't a fairy tale. There is another land that is greater than this. There's trees and birds, beautiful sky. There'll be no more sickness. There'll be no more little boys hoping to grow [music] up. You'll be grown. There ain't going to be no more grandpas and grandmas over there cuz you're going to be the same age of these as the young men. But today's the day that we want to take care of business, work for the master while we can. Can you [music] say amen? There is come many a day when no hard [music] break shall [singing] come. No more clouds in the sky. Tears to dim the eyes. All is [singing] peaceful. on that. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a day. Glorious [singing] day that will be. Oh, what a day [singing and music] that will be when my Jesus &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When I look [singing] upon his face, the [music] one [singing] who save when he takes [singing] me by the hand, leads me through. What a [singing] day. Glorious day. &gt;&gt; Oh, there [singing and music] will be no sorrow left, no [music] more burdens. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; No more parting [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; forever. I will be &gt;&gt; with the one. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. [music] Oh, [singing] what a day. &gt;&gt; Will my Jesus, &gt;&gt; oh God, when I look, [singing] &gt;&gt; the very one who saved me. [music] me by &gt;&gt; when he [singing] takes me by the hand. me through the pro. [music] Brother Brennham would say with the weakness of no support of organization, no support of denominations, no support of ecclesiastical setup, but in simplicity and the power of the Holy Spirit that fell on Pentecost with the same message that Peter had on the day of Pentecost. Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins. You won't be harnessed up like a bunch of those theologians with your collar turned around and a bachelor of art degrees. But brother, you'll have something in your hand. And long as the spirit of God will get into that word, it'll conquer and bring back those sheep, lost sheep that's gone astray. Amen. Confess our weaknesses. Throw off your doctrine of divinity. Throw off your knowit all, your membership. Strip yourself before God spiritually speaking. Call yourself unworthy. Then God can go to using you. Just don't say it from your mouth, but bring it from your heart. David, they had to strip. He had to strip [music] himself. He was the weakest among the whole crowd. Think of the maybe 10,000 or a 100,000 soldiers on the hill. All of them trained. All of them with PhDs. Every one of them was spears. They were soldiers. Each one of them was corporal soando, private so and so. Even to the privates, general so and so, lieutenant so and so, great for star fourstar general saw bishop. Yes, your honor, sir. Every one of them standing there, trained men. And the enemy standing on the hill and said, "You bunch of cowards." That up come in the camp. Up in the camp come a little stoop shoulder. Oh god. Brother Brandham says up in the camp come a little stoop shoulder. Oh god. Little ruddy looking fella. little slingshot over his back with a raisin pie in his hand for [music] his brother. And that giant came out and made a cry once too often. that David with that shepherd's sling expressed to the whole Israelite army the faith he had in their God. Now there was a Goliath on the other side. He stood out there and made his boast many times bigger than David. He had fingers 14 in long. He was a mammoth big fella, the Philistine giant. Here was David, the smallest one. He was even too little to be in the army. Too much of a run. They they couldn't use him. So his brothers were out there in the army. Then Goliath made his boast. But [music] David, now remember, it was revealed to David. He was anointed. He It was revealed to David. He thought, "Here's the armies of the living God standing in their own land, and there's a boasting uncircumcised Philistine out there. We'll call him cancer tonight. We'll call him paralytic." Why? David was no match for him. Not of any kind of a weapon. He was no match. The man's probably standing [music] 14, 15 foot high, a spear like a weaver's needle, probably 20 foot long, the blade on it maybe 4 foot across, and a little David standing there [music] with a little piece of leather, goat skin or sheep skin with two pieces of string tied to it. But it was revealed to him. Revelation struck. Amen. He said, "The God that took me out of the paw of the bear, that took me out of the paws of the lion, how much more will he deliver this uncircumcised Philistine in my hand?" His brother is way more able to do it. Saul head and shoulders above his army. But you see, it wasn't revealed to them. There it is. They believed it could be done. They believed that God could do it, but it wasn't revealed to them. But it was revealed to David. There's the difference right there. If it's absolutely revealed to you that God's going to heal you, you're going to get it. You're going to get it. I don't care what's wrong with you. What's the odds? You may be worse than David and Goliath, but if it's revealed to you, &gt;&gt; notice when it's revealed, David become fearless. He said, "Today I'll cut your head off." Amen. quickly. Our God by grace in that crucial moment when the decision had to be made, that same God that produced the grace in that day and dropped that little seed of faith and that little hunchback looking boy, seeing in his heart, that same God [music] in this crucial moment could take that woman from the wheelchair, that man there, if you can believe it with all her trouble, then that little grain of faith is revealed. Can you say amen? I say today. Don't look at the big mountain because [music] this is the making of a big a big thing. This is a big thing. This is our day for deliverances. This is our day for the Holy Ghost. This is our day for boys and girls to enter into ministry. You say ministry? Yes. Ministry doesn't start when you're bald and gray like me. Ministry starts when you accept his spirit into your life and willing [music] to walk with him. His holy spirit will be right there and he'll be leading you and guiding you. Oh, glory to God. And then [music] this day, we're in our final day. And then he's going to catch us all home and we're going to have rewards. There will be no more sickness, no more sin, no more devil, no more temptation, no more mind battles. Hallelujah. And no more mirrors cuz we won't need them anymore. We'll be perfect. Hallelujah. Oh, what a day that [music] when my Jesus, when I look, the very one to [music] save me. When he takes me by the hand and leads me through the lamb. What a day. [singing and music] Glorious day. Bless the Lord. God bless you. [music] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Sorry for messing up the New Mexican restaurant dinner date. Amen. But God's got something really special. Am I Am I as Are we all clear tonight? &gt;&gt; Where you're at right now, it's [music] you're either going to look through this closed book or you're going to look through this open book. And brother, if you see how the story ends and you see how what spirit is in our [music] age, brother, there there should be no defeatism. &gt;&gt; There should be no defeatism. It should be a day of great exploits. God bless you. Love you. Press the battle. Amen. Right now, right there, where you are, keep that sword in your hand. Don't you lay that sword down for nothing. Don't lay that sword [music] down for nothing. Young people, don't be looking to the right or the left. Keep your hearts pure. [music] Keep your hearts holy. Don't be looking out outside this this this message for boys [music] and girls, boyfriends, girlfriends. Do not get disillusioned [music] in any way. Stay the course. You're the main deal that's going [music] on in this land today. God's preparing you to go home. God bless you. God richly bless [music] you. Father, we thank you. Thank you for your divine grace. Thank you for your divine mercies. Thank you for this divine message. And Lord, we pray that the anointing of your Holy Spirit would take these words that I I ministered [music] here tonight and may it bless the people. May it be something that [music] they can think on. Lord, you see Brother Nathaniel and Sister Katrina are sick. And I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would [music] heal them, Lord. That you would make them whole. Satan, you're a defeated foe and you are cursed in the name of [music] Jesus. Father, you see Aunt Angie and and Lord, that illness there, Lord, that's been bothering her. Father, I I Lord, I'm just speaking to that devil. You have no holds in the name of Jesus. Those that are in distress in their bodies, Lord, we are looking to you. We're believing you in the name of Jesus. We refuse despair. [music] We refuse to lay down our weapon. Father, I thank you [music] for it. I thank you for it, Lord Jesus. We want to give ourselves to you tonight these days of [music] small things. Maybe they're big mountains and maybe it might seem like you're so far away, but you're right there in that fiery furnace with us. Lord, we thank you for every miracle you are [music] performing and the great victory that will be wrought, we love you, Lord in the name of Jesus. Amen [music] and amen and amen. What a day that will be when my Jesus Oh, and [singing and music] I knew &gt;&gt; the very one who saved me. [music] [music] leads me through. God bless you. We love every one of you. [music] &gt;&gt; I have been hurting for quite a bit in my tailbone. I'm here to tell you I have suffered like I Oh, this has [music] been this has been rough. And I had a I had a really really rough day the other day. Sister Katrina [music] text me early one morning, yesterday morning. She said, "In the middle of the night, you were on my mind and the scripture came to me." And she shared the scripture, "Not one bone, not not one of his bones will be broken." speaking of Christ, not one of his bones will be broken. And she said, "I've been [music] praying for you for complete healing." Now, guys, you just don't know. You just don't. I'd never even imagine a tailbone could a broken tailbone could hurt like this. My there was no I I I was [music] sitting all day long yesterday and all day long today and brother I have not had no pain. I've not had pain. [applause] [applause] It was it was night and day. It was I went to bed and throughout the night hurting and I texted Katrina and I said, "You ain't gonna believe this." Might have been a small thing for her to pray. Might have been insignificant. Might have been a But God used [music] her &gt;&gt; for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't God wonderful? when he takes me by the hand, leads me through. God bless you. We'll let you dismiss yourselves tonight. What a day, [singing] glorious day that will be. Oh, what a day that will be. When my Jesus I shall see. When it loo up on his face, [music]
