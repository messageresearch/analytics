[52:27] we just thank you for all of your love
[52:29] to us and we'll give you glory and honor
[52:33] in Jesus name we pray can the church say
[52:37] Amen a amen God bless you I want to
[52:42] minister this morning uh take a title on
[52:45] a positive
[52:46] faith and um God's people have always
[52:51] been in the
[52:52] minority and um you know it it doesn't
[52:57] matter um what what part of the the uh
[53:03] uh Earth's history you've been in God's
[53:06] people has always been a
[53:09] minority and um they've always been
[53:11] rejected of the world they've always
[53:14] amen um they they they've just always
[53:17] not really quite fit into the world and
[53:21] Society but they're loved of God Amen
[53:25] God's God loves his people I I I I just
[53:28] I I I I don't believe that we're serving
[53:30] an Angry God here this morning I don't
[53:33] believe we're serving a God that's
[53:35] schizophrenic I believe that God's love
[53:37] is very real very genuine I believe that
[53:41] God loves you with an Undying Love here
[53:45] and um sometimes we we Believers I I I
[53:49] think we sometimes we we have to hang
[53:51] our head a little bit in shame because
[53:54] amen when we look at our struggles of
[53:56] faith and we look at our struggles well
[53:59] can God do it and and because I I want
[54:02] to say God is Not Just wanting to do it
[54:06] God is not just able to do it but God is
[54:09] willing to do it God is willing to meet
[54:12] you at your point of need and amen and I
[54:16] I I I believe that God's word and God's
[54:20] love will never fail his people amen the
[54:25] revealed word of God Amen is his word
[54:28] made positive so when God comes in a in
[54:32] a special age and he begins to say
[54:35] things in that particular age He is
[54:38] wanting that particular word to be
[54:42] positive to the bride so when God sends
[54:46] us a messenger and that messenger amen
[54:49] if he comes with the with the uh uh uh
[54:53] the words of promise and the divine
[54:56] heing Ing and the Miracles and the
[54:58] supernatural that is a positive to the
[55:02] elect that that word has came out of the
[55:06] scripture and is and is here on Earth
[55:09] today to be made real I believe those
[55:12] words are still circling the globe today
[55:15] I believe that we can still reach out
[55:17] and take the words of God and make them
[55:19] power in our lives H how many times have
[55:23] you done that you know how many times
[55:25] have you have you reached out in in a in
[55:28] a time of need and and you've just
[55:30] reached out and say God I believe it and
[55:33] and God brought the answer to you you
[55:35] brought the words off of the page into a
[55:39] positive in your life amen and so as we
[55:44] as as we look here at this scripture
[55:47] that we had read we are the setting amen
[55:52] is of a is of the amen the the the woman
[55:55] of zerath
[55:56] this woman is in a is in a dire need it
[56:01] must have been a a a a really hot
[56:04] morning amen as uh amen right about the
[56:08] the the breaking of the day now there
[56:11] had been a famine in the land and amen
[56:15] and and the the uh water that had not
[56:18] rained in in three years there there had
[56:22] been such a a drought upon the land and
[56:27] and and the Widow of zerath must have
[56:30] been amen as the prophet would say she
[56:33] she must have been up praying all night
[56:35] on this this particular morning when
[56:38] this Prophet came up to see her amen and
[56:42] a and and the prophet had even spoke
[56:45] three years earlier that it wasn't going
[56:47] to rain there was going to be no
[56:49] moisture there would be no due upon the
[56:52] land amen until he had called for it and
[56:56] and you see it was it was a it was
[57:00] because of Sin Sin had brought about
[57:03] this famine in the land and and and and
[57:06] the land had had suffered because of it
[57:10] and there was no rain there was no crops
[57:12] there was no cattle there was no oil
[57:15] there was no amen there was nothing and
[57:19] this woman and her son was fixing to die
[57:23] amen they were they were fixing to die
[57:26] now now I I want us to to to to look at
[57:30] this because amen you see
[57:34] sin it it sin will hinder us every time
[57:38] and we're living in a Land of sin I just
[57:40] want to stop here for a moment you see
[57:43] the curse that is Upon Our Land today is
[57:48] because of
[57:50] sin this that because there has been the
[57:54] amen the church world the amen the
[57:57] political world all around the world
[58:00] they have forsaken the words of life
[58:03] amen when they forsake the words of life
[58:06] then there is nothing else and the
[58:08] scripture says in these last days even
[58:10] that there would be a Great Famine that
[58:13] would come upon the land he says it
[58:16] wouldn't be a famine of of bread and
[58:18] water but it would be a famine of
[58:21] hearing the words of God Amen that there
[58:25] would be a famine so in this case as I
[58:28] as we go through this story here for a
[58:30] few moments you can put yourself in that
[58:34] situation because we are living in a
[58:37] Land of Great
[58:39] Famine amen you you you you look around
[58:43] there's no spiritual life hardly
[58:46] anywhere there amen and and and many of
[58:48] times that affects you in your spiritual
[58:52] life amen you you that there is know
[58:56] you're not living in a land where where
[58:58] everyone loves to pray and everyone
[59:00] loves where there's prayer meetings
[59:01] going on all the time like it used to be
[59:04] that you're not living in a land where
[59:06] amen Revival Services went for three and
[59:08] four weeks at a time amen because the
[59:11] hunger for the word of God is no longer
[59:14] there well I amen you you might as well
[59:17] shout amen because it's no longer there
[59:20] and that affects that can affect your
[59:23] family that can affect you as a person
[59:25] that can affect your church that can
[59:27] affect everything around you because
[59:29] we're living in a land where there is
[59:33] amen a famine but that famine was called
[59:36] on Amen uh by the word of the Lord you
[59:39] see Ahab was one of those political guys
[59:42] that amen he had no backbone he had no
[59:46] conviction had no real real love for God
[59:50] and and and he he had uh married into uh
[59:55] uh a a a a a pagan amen and and married
[59:59] Jezebel and you see Jezebel brought in
[1:00:03] uh all kinds of idolatry and sin into
[1:00:08] into the nation of Israel amen now and
[1:00:11] the people had fallen in in great moral
[1:00:15] Decay now the prophet would tell us that
[1:00:18] Ahab was one of the most wicked kings
[1:00:21] that had that had ever come to Israel
[1:00:24] and when he had married Jezebel
[1:00:26] amen she was the daughter of a of a
[1:00:29] Phoenician King amen and she herself was
[1:00:33] a priestess and so she brought in amen
[1:00:37] the Pagan worship and built temples and
[1:00:39] shrines and amen uh to baale and and and
[1:00:43] it was it was quite a deal so Jezebel
[1:00:46] had run the country amen and and she was
[1:00:51] a as I said here a couple weeks ago she
[1:00:53] was a a proud and strong strong woman
[1:00:57] amen a a strong minded woman she was
[1:00:59] determined and driven and and and and
[1:01:02] and she she had a desire what seemed to
[1:01:06] break the back of Israel she had a
[1:01:10] desire to destroy the power of God in
[1:01:14] Israel amen it it looked like amen she
[1:01:17] was hellbent to come in well can you say
[1:01:20] amen amen and the the as we look there
[1:01:25] at this little shom my woman this little
[1:01:28] woman was affected she was not an
[1:01:31] unbeliever she was not amen a pagan she
[1:01:35] had not bowed her knees to bail she had
[1:01:38] not kissed his lips she had not done
[1:01:41] these things but here she was amen with
[1:01:45] her with her son dying and amen she was
[1:01:48] at her very last meal and it seemed like
[1:01:51] the effects of the famine in the land
[1:01:54] amen where all had come in on her and
[1:01:57] she felt amen that God had forsaken her
[1:02:02] well do you ever feel like you've been
[1:02:03] there amen where it looks like it's all
[1:02:06] caved in on you amen you're the one who
[1:02:09] loves God you're the one that's trying
[1:02:11] to serve him you're the one and yet here
[1:02:13] we are Amen in this famine but I just
[1:02:16] want to tell you this morning amen God's
[1:02:19] got a propit for you God's got a
[1:02:21] positive word for you God's got a
[1:02:24] positive faith for you you to rise above
[1:02:27] it all oh can you say
[1:02:29] amen amen that's right so Ahab there he
[1:02:33] was he was very easy to persuade he was
[1:02:36] manipulative amen and and and and he was
[1:02:39] he he followed the polls he he done
[1:02:41] those kinds of things and and I and I
[1:02:44] want to say here this morning amen you
[1:02:47] know it's easy to go with the flow you
[1:02:50] you young men i i i God's looking for
[1:02:53] separators God's not looking looking for
[1:02:56] mixers God's looking for separators how
[1:03:00] many knows what Ahab done wrong in the
[1:03:02] first place he should have never married
[1:03:06] a pagan girl in the beginning he should
[1:03:09] have never went to well praise the Lord
[1:03:13] amen you you shouldn't be a boy if
[1:03:16] you're a Christian boy you have no
[1:03:17] business out there amen running around
[1:03:20] with a girl with amen with with with
[1:03:22] bright lips and amen and and and and
[1:03:26] stirrups hanging off her ears and and
[1:03:28] and all of those kinds of things amen
[1:03:30] you have no what are you doing flirting
[1:03:32] around with a girl that that that that
[1:03:35] is not even amen uh uh your uh you know
[1:03:39] of your belief or amen that follows the
[1:03:42] word of God Like You Believe amen I want
[1:03:44] to tell you if your heart is chasing
[1:03:47] after those girls and chasing after amen
[1:03:50] uh uh H H uh forms and and and and
[1:03:53] looking at things on your phone and
[1:03:55] things you're not supposed it shows what
[1:03:59] your heart is it showed the heart of
[1:04:04] Ahab ahab's heart was not for God his
[1:04:09] heart was for something else and I I I

[1:25:04] sincerity God was checking where she was
[1:25:07] at well bless the Lord and she
[1:25:10] surrendered everything to that prophet
[1:25:14] and God in return says your coverts are
[1:25:18] not going to go dry they're not going to
[1:25:21] be empty well praise the name of the
[1:25:24] Lord amen you see it was right there at
[1:25:27] that crucial time amen when it was so
[1:25:31] horrible to watch the child laying there
[1:25:33] but she continued to believe God Amen
[1:25:36] she tried to sleep all night amen but
[1:25:38] she seen the groans of and heard the
[1:25:41] groans of her baby but when God came on
[1:25:44] the scene it sustained her and the
[1:25:46] prophet and her house the whole
[1:25:50] famine now brother brandham would say
[1:25:53] see had been gradually getting lower and
[1:25:56] lower in the meal that night she knew
[1:26:00] that when she went to bed her little boy
[1:26:03] his father was gone she was a righteous
[1:26:05] woman a God-fearing woman that night I
[1:26:07] can see them as they nap down to pray
[1:26:09] and they they looked at his little
[1:26:11] pajama arms and they were threadbear and
[1:26:13] his little face and was marred with
[1:26:15] Hunger she give her part to him because
[1:26:18] she knowed he could he just a little
[1:26:20] longer and they'd both be gone there was
[1:26:23] no bread in the lamb there was no meal
[1:26:24] there was no oil there was no rain but
[1:26:26] yet she trusted God she couldn't sleep
[1:26:30] every once in a while he'd turn over and
[1:26:33] say mama won't you go out into the
[1:26:35] cupboard and and and look one more time
[1:26:37] and see if there's one bite of that
[1:26:39] bread left I'm so hungry I can't sleep
[1:26:42] how she had bite her lips until they
[1:26:45] would bleed she'd go out in the kitchen
[1:26:48] and raise her hands and say oh Jehovah
[1:26:50] I'm a widow who believes in you you took
[1:26:52] the little boy's father your servant up
[1:26:55] to heaven to be with you if you don't
[1:26:57] help me it won't be long until we'll be
[1:26:59] visiting him nevertheless whatever you
[1:27:02] do I love you just the same and I trust
[1:27:06] you and it seems when a person has done
[1:27:09] all that they can do and they have
[1:27:12] fulfilled every request that God has
[1:27:14] asked them to do and still he is
[1:27:17] silent when you have done all of that

[1:27:24] silent just be sure that you're that you
[1:27:28] know God remember faith is silently
[1:27:31] waiting he's only testing your faith to

[1:27:49] God and he let them walk into the fiery
[1:27:52] furnace before he ever moved but he
[1:27:54] stayed but they stayed waited silently
[1:27:58] assured that everything is all
[1:28:01] right he says oh there it was when they
[1:28:05] walked into that fiery furnace under the
[1:28:07] trial under a test they held true to the
[1:28:11] end but God was there just in a spare of
[1:28:14] a moment and he delivered them and they
[1:28:16] know that they were prayed up their sins
[1:28:19] were confessed they know they had met
[1:28:21] every requirement and yet he seemed to
[1:28:23] be silent he is only silent to test you

[1:35:13] are all tests in our lives I don't know
[1:35:16] that's kind of stuff's not in my notes
[1:35:17] but amen testing is important testing is
[1:35:21] important well somebody say testing is
[1:35:24] important amen when God when God's not
[1:35:28] answering you like you should when God's
[1:35:30] not hearing you what you think the way
[1:35:32] and he's not responding the way that he
[1:35:34] should and when you think that amen
[1:35:36] God's not where is he at I want to say
[1:35:39] God is waiting God is testing and God's
[1:35:44] wanting to promote some Sons and
[1:35:46] Daughters to a higher position in
[1:35:48] him a higher Place amen that's what we
[1:35:52] want amen men Lord plant my feet on
[1:35:56] higher ground not staying right where
[1:35:58] I'm at take me higher in
[1:36:01] you
[1:36:03] amen the
[1:36:05] test
[1:36:07] now a a positive
[1:36:10] word brings positive
[1:36:13] faith if faith comes by hearing and
[1:36:16] hearing by the word of God and we are in
[1:36:20] a
[1:36:22] famine for the hearing of the word of
[1:36:26] God I want you to understand the Bible
[1:36:29] says in the last days there in Amos
[1:36:31] there will be a
[1:36:33] famine and yet Jesus says faith can only
[1:36:36] come by the hearing of the word of
[1:36:40] God Amen that goes that that that takes
[1:36:43] us back to Malachi the 4th chapter that
[1:36:46] there would be a restoration there would
[1:36:49] be a prophet to come back and build the
[1:36:52] altar br bring the words back where they
[1:36:56] belong so that our faith can rise in
[1:37:00] this day now listen the day that we're
[1:37:03] living in Zechariah 14:6 it and it shall
[1:37:07] come to pass in that day that the light
[1:37:09] shall not be clear nor dark and it shall
[1:37:12] be one day that shall be known unto the
[1:37:14] Lord not day nor night but it shall come
[1:37:17] to pass that at the evening
[1:37:20] time it shall
[1:37:23] be
[1:37:25] light light Thy word is a
[1:37:29] lamp to my feet and a light to my
[1:37:35] path now testing on that word because
[1:37:39] that word faith can can only rely upon
[1:37:42] the word of God and we don't want it to
[1:37:45] rely on position rely on on on music
[1:37:48] rely on on on anything else it relies
[1:37:53] upon that one word and we our thoughts
[1:37:56] should be centered around that
[1:37:59] word amen amen so our
[1:38:04] positive a positive faith comes from
[1:38:07] positive
[1:38:09] thoughts positive thoughts what what
[1:38:11] brother wend we are you saying mind over
[1:38:13] matter no I'm just saying I'm just
[1:38:14] taking amen Philippians 4 Philippians
[1:38:18] 4:8 whatsoever things are lovely
[1:38:22] whatsoever things are of good report
[1:38:25] whatsoever things amen are pure th what
[1:38:29] think on these things think on these
[1:38:33] things so so here it is when you're in
[1:38:36] the struggle when you're in the trial
[1:38:38] when when when things are a little tipsy
[1:38:41] Topsy keep our eyes keep our minds keep
[1:38:46] our thoughts upon the promises of
[1:38:49] God yes sir Hallelujah because you're
[1:38:52] anointed for it absolutely anointed for
[1:38:55] this day absolutely I'm not saying that
[1:38:57] you're amen that you're a high roller I
[1:39:00] am saying the authority belongs to the
[1:39:03] Sons and Daughters of God so we must
[1:39:07] keep our minds not as the as as the
[1:39:11] meagerly who are who are dying from the
[1:39:13] from from the plague but we got to stand
[1:39:17] there and say God you've given me a
[1:39:20] promise
[1:39:23] amen I'm going to keep my eyes on you
[1:39:26] can you say amen amen
[1:39:30] now when we when we
[1:39:34] look especially when it comes to our
[1:39:37] healing amen we've got to drive that
[1:39:40] steak in the ground where you met the
[1:39:42] Lord you got to go you got to find out
[1:39:44] where where where he's at and if you
[1:39:46] haven't then then then you need you
[1:39:48] you've got to find that you've got to
[1:39:51] reach heaven you've got to know that you
[1:39:53] know that you know you've got to reach
[1:39:56] heaven and there might not be anything
[1:39:58] that even takes place then there might
[1:40:01] not be amen but at least you know you've
[1:40:06] got a positive
[1:40:08] Faith you have prayed through just like
[1:40:10] the Hebrew boys
[1:40:12] amen it was they had prayed through they
[1:40:16] know that God was with them live or die
[1:40:19] amen swim or sink God was with them and
[1:40:23] then you drive that you drive that steak
[1:40:26] into the ground and anytime that Satan
[1:40:28] tries to pull you back you just tie
[1:40:29] yourself to that steak amen right there
[1:40:32] that's the place that God met me well
[1:40:34] that's what you have to do with the
[1:40:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost come on you
[1:40:37] there ain't there ain't nobody that's
[1:40:39] that's that's that's received the
[1:40:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost that the devil
[1:40:42] hasn't caused you to doubt whether
[1:40:43] you've got it there there is nobody in
[1:40:46] this building amen genuine Spirit-filled
[1:40:49] people that that that the devil doesn't
[1:40:52] try to beat you up and try to make you
[1:40:54] think but you've got to drive your steak
[1:40:56] in the ground and you've got to say this
[1:40:59] is when God told me this is when God
[1:41:02] filled me this is when God anchored my
[1:41:05] heart and I'm not going to move from it
[1:41:08] in in any way I I I know that I'm living
[1:41:11] in a godforsaken land but I'm not
[1:41:15] godforsaken I know that healing is is is
[1:41:18] not abundant around the country anymore
[1:41:21] Divine Healing but I I am a Son of
[1:41:28] God can you say
[1:41:30] amen amen we've got to change that Amen
[1:41:35] brother Brandon would say we he we want
[1:41:36] to change from hope today to positive
[1:41:40] Faith amen he said there's only one way
[1:41:42] we can get positive faith and that's by
[1:41:44] positive thinking on positive things the
[1:41:47] word of God that's right amen now he
[1:41:52] says if you know that you have met his
[1:41:55] requirements you've done all that you
[1:41:56] know to do then Faith doesn't waver it
[1:41:59] just sets still and thinks positive God
[1:42:03] or faith takes its a Everlasting grip
[1:42:06] around the Rock of Ages and it doesn't
[1:42:09] move well glory to God I I I I like this
[1:42:12] amen because brother bram's telling the
[1:42:14] opposite the other side of the story to
[1:42:15] this little woman he said when this
[1:42:17] little woman knowed that she had met all
[1:42:19] these requirements and still God was
[1:42:21] silent seemed like he didn't even care
[1:42:23] for her he didn't uh he didn't care
[1:42:26] whether she lived or died and but all
[1:42:29] the time God was working she didn't know
[1:42:33] about it but God told Elijah he dried up
[1:42:36] the brook he reached out his hand he
[1:42:39] stopped the brook from running and
[1:42:41] Elijah said Lord why did you stop and he
[1:42:43] says I've commanded a widow woman to
[1:42:46] feed you he's already commanded her and
[1:42:49] she didn't know
[1:42:51] it he might have commanded of you a
[1:42:54] little testimony of your healing and you
[1:42:56] might not know it just hang
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:04] [Applause]
[1:43:06] on you might not know about it just
[1:43:09] that's what I told Daddy the other day
[1:43:11] just hang on the Miracles around the
[1:43:14] corner you say well I don't believe it
[1:43:16] well if it could happen amen when our
[1:43:18] Prophet was on the earth I'm a Son of
[1:43:20] God I can believe you say well he's an
[1:43:23] old man yes he is but so was brother
[1:43:28] da well can you say man you all you can
[1:43:31] say all but brother W you saying that
[1:43:33] kind of stuff you're a preacher and if
[1:43:34] it don't really come to pass amen don't
[1:43:36] you know what kind of oh that's the same
[1:43:38] kind of skepticism that that one guy had
[1:43:40] that boy amen that was that was all
[1:43:43] twisted up and torn up and couldn't move
[1:43:45] from his from his uh his neck down amen
[1:43:49] and and and and when somebody had prayed
[1:43:50] for him amen he says well give me he
[1:43:52] says now he says give me he's telling
[1:43:54] brother brandham Give Me A Sign amen and
[1:43:58] brother brandham what did he do he gave
[1:44:01] him scripture and he showed him the
[1:44:04] scripture and says here it is Son and he
[1:44:07] went back and started confessing to the
[1:44:10] all of the church and and and the
[1:44:12] neighborhood and the community I am
[1:44:14] healed I am healed finally the church
[1:44:16] and leaders got together and said listen
[1:44:18] you're making a mockery of God you're
[1:44:20] making a mockery of this church I'm
[1:44:22] asking we're we're demanding you to quit
[1:44:25] that amen and right then as they were
[1:44:28] there just on him and on him and he was
[1:44:31] standing or sitting there amen laying
[1:44:34] there uh amen and trying to defend his
[1:44:38] faith all of a sudden his faith came
[1:44:41] into action and God healed him and he

[1:57:39] him he had said when I when I'd looked
[1:57:41] I'd seen the most prettiest women bunch
[1:57:44] of women clean
[1:57:46] dressed I've ever seen in my life but
[1:57:48] each of them looked like was dressed
[1:57:50] different they all had long hair hair
[1:57:52] and
[1:57:54] sleeves they were longer sleeves and
[1:57:56] skirts so forth young
[1:57:58] women they'd look I'd say maybe
[1:58:02] 20 now I have my Bible
[1:58:04] open and if you say what are you looking
[1:58:07] at I'm I'm looking at a clock what are
[1:58:09] you looking for I'm I'm looking for
[1:58:11] people looking at people what are you
[1:58:13] looking at I'm looking at the Bible
[1:58:15] that's what I'm telling the truth that's
[1:58:17] what I see I can I can only say what I
[1:58:21] seen I don't know what all about it I
[1:58:24] just have to tell you what I
[1:58:26] seen But when this bride when she was
[1:58:29] looking the one talking to me and I I'm
[1:58:32] I'm standing there and her eyes she was
[1:58:35] the cleanest sweetest looking people I'd
[1:58:37] ever seen in my life he's talking about
[1:58:41] you little
[1:58:46] bride look like I I could have been a
[1:58:50] dozen or I don't know how many
[1:58:53] was a breast but there was just in a
[1:58:55] group of them she passed by sweetly with
[1:58:58] with air and I her eyes up watching as
[1:59:02] she
[1:59:03] passed oh she was beautiful I looked at
[1:59:06] her and as she passed
[1:59:08] by he said now we shall we shall
[1:59:12] [Music]
[1:59:17] review now
[1:59:26] I think in the
[1:59:28] [Music]
[1:59:30] teaching when brother Brandon was
[1:59:32] talking about the book of Ephesians
[1:59:33] paralleling with
[1:59:35] Joshua when Joshua placed the people in
[1:59:38] that
[1:59:39] land it by the Holy Ghost it there was
[1:59:42] no questioning about it was it was it
[1:59:44] was divinely appointed and the book of
[1:59:47] Ephesians does that to us too the book
[1:59:49] of Ephesians just the if
[1:59:52] if if
[1:59:53] you look at Ephesians it is God
[1:59:56] establishing he's not talking to one of
[1:59:59] be's girlfriends he's not talking to the
[2:00:01] to to the Natural Church he's talking to
[2:00:05] a
[2:00:06] group that he has forn he's telling them
[2:00:10] you were predestinated you were chosen
[2:00:13] in Christ you were I want you to see
[2:00:15] this this is your this is
[2:00:19] your inheritance
[2:00:25] this is this is yours and I and I and I
[2:00:27] and I I I want us to to really see that
[2:00:30] because when we see ourselves as that
[2:00:32] bride of Ephesians then we can also
[2:00:35] stand there and say
[2:00:37] everything that has been placed at my
[2:00:41] disposal every promise that has been
[2:00:44] given through the
[2:00:46] lips of that messenger you say you're
[2:00:48] putting a lot through the messenger god
[2:00:49] put a lot in on that messenger
[2:00:53] now man's made things of of brother
[2:00:54] brandom I understand that they they you
[2:00:57] know they're just a lot of cuckoo out
[2:00:59] [Music]
[2:01:01] there but so did they with with with
[2:01:05] Martin Luther the one you know we've
[2:01:07] been talk we're starting to talk about
[2:01:09] church age book when they done it but
[2:01:13] that doesn't change the fact that God
[2:01:14] worked and God left us something and it
[2:01:17] doesn't matter all of this other
[2:01:19] nonsense around it and and you know to
[2:01:21] be honest there's a lot of people that
[2:01:23] have a right to to
[2:01:25] criticize they
[2:01:28] do but I've been a
[2:01:30] [Music]
[2:01:32] student as I told you earlier I'm not
[2:01:34] the sharpest knife in the in the
[2:01:38] drawer but I have been able to
[2:01:41] take these words that have been brought
[2:01:44] To Us by the prophet and go back to
[2:01:45] scripture with
[2:01:49] it it was God's spotlighting
[2:01:53] promises for you and me to
[2:01:57] believe some say well he didn't know
[2:02:00] much anything about the end time prophec
[2:02:01] he didn't said nothing about I mean
[2:02:04] there's just you
[2:02:06] know about when Israel accepting Christ
[2:02:10] and all of this and it just a little
[2:02:11] vague and that that's not to
[2:02:13] [Music]
[2:02:15] me but he's given me something to
[2:02:17] believe and that'll take me up in a
[2:02:20] ratcher there'll be another Elijah that
[2:02:22] comes in and takes care of getting the
[2:02:23] Jews
[2:02:24] [Music]
[2:02:27] ready but what I'm saying is there's a
[2:02:30] positive
[2:02:32] word for positive Faith do you believe
[2:02:36] that
