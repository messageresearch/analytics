[38:16] here's my cup Lord let's sing that song
[38:19] [Music]
[38:22] here's my God
[38:25] Lord
[38:29] I live
[38:32] [Music]
[38:38] come and quit
[38:43] this
[38:45] thirsting of
[38:48] my soul yes my Lord
[38:56] [Music]
[39:07] thank you
[39:09] [Music]
[39:27] a true understanding of
[39:30] what the Lord wants to do for us
[39:33] we really wouldn't seem to fill my cup
[39:37] we'd sing fill my truck
[39:42] because he wants to bless us
[39:45] remember him said he wants to give you
[39:46] the Holy Ghost more than you want to
[39:48] receive it
[39:50] he said he wants to heal you a thousand
[39:52] times more than you want to be healed
[39:54] that's the God we serve tonight
[39:58] I'm so glad we don't serve a dead God
[40:00] and God is someone's imagination but we
[40:03] serve the Living God tonight
[40:05] amen you know I've said it before I
[40:08] heard Brother David Tyler one time said
[40:10] it it just always stuck with me said he
[40:11] was over in India
[40:13] and he watched a man fashion out of God
[40:15] with his hands he said he set that God
[40:18] down and began to worship it
[40:21] brother David's father said I was
[40:23] looking at that and I thought I'm so
[40:24] glad
[40:25] that I don't serve a God I made with my
[40:28] hands
[40:29] but I serve a God who made me with his
[40:31] heads
[40:36] we're his people
[40:38] and all he ever asked us to do
[40:42] was to believe him
[40:44] if those can believe
[40:47] all things are possible the dead can be
[40:50] raised blinded eyes can come open the
[40:54] lame can get up and walk
[40:56] because that's the kind of God that we
[40:58] serve
[40:59] amen and not only can he heal our
[41:01] physical bodies but our Spirituals
[41:04] he can lift us out of depression
[41:06] [Music]
[41:07] bipolar
[41:09] come on some schizophrenic
[41:11] amen sometimes sickness is not always in
[41:14] the flesh people deal with battles and
[41:16] there's minds and
[41:18] but our God can deliver everyone
[41:20] we can leave these meetings this week
[41:23] completely restored
[41:26] you say how could you say that because
[41:28] that's what my daddy said he said in his
[41:31] word I will restore saith the Lord
[41:35] and there's one thing about my daddy he
[41:37] don't lie
[41:39] oh praise the Lord
[41:43] we're greet you in the name of the Lord
[41:45] Jesus and counted just an honor to be
[41:47] able to be with you once again this year
[41:49] and We Trust something to be said to
[41:51] help you and just a wee bit nervous and
[41:53] try to open up the meetings but we Just
[41:56] Surrender ourselves to him that he would
[41:58] just maybe speak something to you
[42:00] tonight amen thank you brother Wendell
[42:02] for having us the nice place to stay and
[42:05] the food and all that's done for us may
[42:07] the Lord richly bless each of you if you
[42:10] have your Bibles tonight we want to read
[42:11] from two places we want to read from
[42:12] Matthew chapter 16.
[42:15] starting at verse 24 and then we'll
[42:17] we'll have a word of prayer and be
[42:19] seated and I'd like to read from Judges
[42:21] chapter 16.
[42:24] certainly kind of an honor to be here
[42:26] and so happy that my wife Cheryl is able
[42:29] to come with us this week
[42:32] it's always good to have her with us and
[42:37] amen
[42:40] Matthew chapter 16 verse 24.
[42:52] then said Jesus unto his disciples
[42:56] If any man will come after me
[42:59] let him deny himself
[43:02] and take up his cross
[43:04] and follow me
[43:06] for whosoever will save his life shall
[43:08] lose it
[43:10] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[43:13] shall find it
[43:17] for what is a man profited
[43:19] if she if he shall gain the whole world
[43:23] and lose his own soul
[43:25] or what shall a man give in exchange for
[43:29] his soul
[43:31] let's bow our heads
[43:36] Heavenly Father
[43:38] Lord as we've gathered here from many
[43:41] different places this evening
[43:44] Lord we come for one purpose and that's
[43:46] to lift you up
[43:48] for you said Lord if I be lifted up I
[43:50] will draw all man unto myself
[43:54] and Lord we know in a Congregation of
[43:56] this size there's many needs
[43:59] but Lord we serve the god who's able to
[44:01] meet every need
[44:03] and I pray tonight Lord that this
[44:05] thought that you placed upon our heart
[44:07] would cause us Lord to look deep into
[44:10] ourselves
[44:11] and to see what it is that we really
[44:13] want to accomplish in these meetings
[44:16] oh God may it be that when all things
[44:18] are said and done and the bibles are
[44:20] closed May each of us leave here closer
[44:23] to you Lord
[44:24] for truly that's why we come that we can
[44:27] be fashioned into an image that you
[44:29] would be pleased to dwell in the father
[44:31] we asked your blessings upon brother
[44:33] Wendell and the officers here of the
[44:34] church and my Minister and brothers that
[44:36] you'd use them in a great way
[44:38] Lord that signs and wonders would be
[44:40] brought at their hands that this
[44:42] community Lord this Pony Nation would
[44:44] know
[44:45] that we serve the Living God
[44:48] the Lord we commit this service into
[44:50] your hands This Night For Your Glory
[44:51] bless you children father that when we
[44:54] leave the building may we say did not
[44:55] our hearts burn within us as you spoke
[44:58] with us along the way granted Lord we
[45:01] pray for we ask these things in Jesus
[45:03] name and the bride says
[45:05] and may God bless you may be seated now
[45:07] I want to read from judges it's where we
[45:09] want to take our thought from tonight
[45:10] but Judges chapter 16 starting at verse
[45:13] 27.
[45:18] and the Bible says this now the house
[45:20] was full of men and women
[45:22] and all the Lords of the Philistines
[45:24] were there
[45:26] and there were upon the roof about 3 000
[45:29] men and women
[45:31] that beheld by Samson made sport
[45:35] and Samson called unto the Lord and said
[45:37] oh Lord remember me I pray thee and
[45:40] strengthen me I pray thee only this once
[45:42] oh God
[45:43] that I may be at once Avenged of the
[45:46] Philistines for my two eyes
[45:49] and Samson took over the two middle
[45:51] pillars upon which the house stood
[45:54] and on which it was born up of one with
[45:56] his right hand and the other with his
[45:58] left and Samson said let me die with the
[46:01] Philistines
[46:02] and he bowed himself with all his might
[46:05] and the house fell upon the Lords and
[46:07] upon all the people that were therein
[46:10] so the dead which he slew at his death
[46:13] were more than they which he slew in his
[46:17] life
[46:18] his greatest Victory came
[46:21] from his death
[46:23] may the Lord add his Blessing to the
[46:24] reading of the word I want to speak to
[46:26] you for a few minutes this evening on
[46:28] this day
[46:30] I will give my all
[46:33] this day
[46:34] I will give
[46:36] Mao
[46:39] you know I wonder how Samson must have
[46:41] felt
[46:43] when he was escorted into the arena that
[46:46] day
[46:48] being led by a child
[46:51] a man who once had strength that he
[46:54] could pick up Gates and pack them up on
[46:56] a hill weighing two tons a piece I think
[46:58] it was and setting them down and now he
[47:01] is being led by a child
[47:04] bound
[47:05] Ed
[47:07] to hear the chants and the laughs of
[47:10] those that God had raised him up to
[47:12] destroy
[47:14] to feel the spit and the wine on his
[47:16] face as they made sport out of Samson
[47:21] the brother better said Jehovah never
[47:23] lost the victory but it was Samson that
[47:26] lost the Victory and let me say tonight
[47:29] and let me be honest with you I may have
[47:32] lost the victory now and then
[47:34] but I want you to know that Jehovah
[47:36] never has I may have stuck my toe but
[47:40] Jehovah never has I may have lost the
[47:43] battle now and then but I want you to
[47:45] know tonight that my God has never lost
[47:48] a battle
[47:50] Hallelujah so tonight I'm not trusted in
[47:52] myself I'm not trusted in my ability but
[47:55] I'm trusting in a God who can not fail
[47:59] and even though I may lose a battle now
[48:01] and then I serve a captain Hallelujah
[48:06] and we've already won the war amen
[48:09] you see God had raised him up to destroy
[48:12] Philistines but Samson lost his vision
[48:16] he had forgotten what he was put here on
[48:19] the earth to do
[48:21] and let me say tonight God just didn't
[48:23] call us to come and sit on the Pew God
[48:25] didn't call us just to be some kind of a
[48:27] religious something or another but he
[48:29] places on this Earth the Sons and
[48:31] Daughters of God and he never placed us
[48:33] here to lose he never placed us here to
[48:35] give up he never placed us here to turn
[48:37] back but he placed Us in because he
[48:39] predestinated us before the foundation
[48:42] of the world that this would be our day
[48:44] our time our season our hour that we
[48:47] would bring forth the manifestation of
[48:49] the word of God hallelujah
[48:52] amen when we come through those doors we
[48:55] need to come through I've come for a
[48:57] purpose I was born for a purpose and
[48:59] they ain't nobody can take my place
[49:03] nobody can ever take your place God
[49:06] placed you here for a purpose
[49:08] but you see he forgot that something he
[49:11] let something get between him
[49:14] and his God
[49:16] he had forgotten who he was
[49:21] amen
[49:22] it's not all the time a woman
[49:25] sometimes it can be other things
[49:28] well that got quiet but it's true
[49:31] amen
[49:33] sometimes they let other things come
[49:34] between us and our God
[49:37] like our job our career
[49:40] come on
[49:42] he forgot who he was
[49:45] and as they spit on him and as they
[49:47] threw wine on him and the Roar and the
[49:50] laughter of the crowd he began to
[49:54] remember
[49:56] you know I wonder what point it was that
[49:59] Simpson decided he had had enough
[50:02] and sometimes you just need to be sick
[50:05] and tired of being sick and tired
[50:08] sometimes you just need to declare war
[50:11] on that job that's bothering you
[50:14] on that thing that's holding you oh that
[50:16] sickness on that barrier you need to
[50:19] declare a world and to say no more I
[50:21] have come to defeat you
[50:24] you've pushed me down you beat me down
[50:27] but I say no more
[50:29] I've had enough I am a Son of God I am a
[50:32] daughter of God Amen and I have rights
[50:35] that's given to amen I have rights
[50:38] that's been given to me by Jesus Christ
[50:41] Hallelujah
[50:43] amen
[50:44] Samson had enough of being jerked around
[50:48] and I pray that something in this
[50:50] message tonight will cause you to
[50:52] remember
[50:56] the prophet said God stirred up the
[50:59] Ephesians by telling them to remember
[51:04] God told them to remember he said
[51:06] evidently something that left their
[51:07] minds they had forgotten something but
[51:09] he told them to turn back in their minds
[51:12] to the point of origin the origin of the
[51:15] first age was Pentecost they had fallen
[51:17] from it they had forgotten the glory and
[51:19] The Wonder of it
[51:21] and I say if you're here tonight and
[51:23] maybe you have forgot the glory and The
[51:25] Wonder of this message of understanding
[51:28] that God shouts you out by a prophet we
[51:31] never come looking for God he'd come
[51:33] looking for us
[51:36] God sent Elijah to find you amen
[51:41] and if you remember a time when you were
[51:43] closer to God
[51:45] a time when you was on fire
[51:49] a time when you was more committed you
[51:51] was more surrendered
[51:55] what's happened to the prayer lives
[51:57] what's happened to the fasting
[52:02] we want revivals with no fasting
[52:06] we want healings and deliverances with
[52:08] no prayer meetings
[52:11] well it's getting quiet but
[52:14] it's open tonight amen
[52:19] but if you can remember a time that you
[52:21] was closer to God
[52:24] said God never left Samson Samson left
[52:27] God
[52:29] 's never left us he said I'll never
[52:31] leave you nor will I forsake you it
[52:34] ain't God it's us
[52:38] and if you can remember a time then I
[52:41] say to you let this be the meetings this
[52:43] week a time of renewal let this be a
[52:46] time of recommitment a time of
[52:48] dedication a time of consecration a time
[52:51] let it be a time to light the fire again
[52:56] to be touched by a fire that the world
[52:59] will know that you're burning amen
[53:03] amen
[53:05] Samson begin to remember
[53:08] the victories he began to remember the
[53:12] power
[53:13] the feeling of being in Fellowship
[53:17] with God
[53:19] do you remember
[53:21] maybe you're here tonight maybe it's
[53:23] this is for you
[53:25] you remember you say yes
[53:28] yes I remember bro I remember
[53:32] what what what shall I do
[53:35] why don't you do what he did
[53:37] he began to pray
[53:40] and the prophet said he began to pray
[53:43] right
[53:44] this wasn't a God blessed Mama God bless
[53:46] Daddy thank you for the day and jump
[53:48] into the bed prayer
[53:51] but he began to pray from the very
[53:53] passion of his heart he began to pray
[53:56] let me die with my enemy Lord avenge my
[54:00] two eyes you see this wasn't just a weak
[54:03] prayer he realized if God entered this
[54:06] prayer it meant his very life but he was
[54:09] willing to pay the price this day I will
[54:12] give my all
[54:14] that I can accomplish what God put me on
[54:17] the earth to do
[54:20] I don't want to get there that day
[54:22] brother Kitty and the Lord said you
[54:24] failed to do what I called you to do but
[54:26] when I get there that day I want to hear
[54:28] him say Well done
[54:31] [Applause]
[54:35] he began to pray from the very passion
[54:38] of his heart
[54:39] he realized what he was asking he knew
[54:42] what it was going to take
[54:45] God told the Ephesians look at what she
[54:47] once was in your heart and in your mind
[54:50] and in your life
[54:53] and then go back
[54:55] to that
[54:57] you remember
[54:59] you remember that night you met him
[55:04] remember where he brought you from
[55:07] I do
[55:15] remember said you must die with your
[55:17] enemy that's right you must die to the
[55:20] enemy that's got you in this condition
[55:22] whatever's holding you down whatever is
[55:24] holding you back whatever's tripping you
[55:26] up whatever is beating you down this is
[55:29] the weak
[55:33] to get the victory
[55:36] you see before there could be a victory
[55:38] there has to be a Victor and we know
[55:40] we've got what Hallelujah Jesus Christ
[55:43] is the victory
[55:45] Simpson was willing to pay the price to
[55:48] get the power of God back out he began
[55:50] he's seen what he was raised up to do
[55:52] not be a showman not just to be a
[55:54] message follower
[55:56] but to be a servant amen to have himself
[55:59] so that the power of God could flow
[56:02] through him that's what God's looking
[56:04] for in this hour he's looking for some
[56:06] conduits
[56:09] you know what a conduit is it's a
[56:10] channel
[56:12] I used to work with a Vietnamese surgeon
[56:14] and he used to say no conduit no conduit
[56:20] he was a vascular surgeon he said if
[56:22] there's no Channel you can't do it no
[56:25] conduit no conduit
[56:28] and that's the way it is amen God's
[56:30] looking for a channel God's looking for
[56:32] a young person an old person a mama a
[56:34] daddy a brother a sister somebody that
[56:37] he could get into his hands amen and the
[56:39] Holy Spirit can flow through this that
[56:41] he go Hallelujah the only eyes God has
[56:44] is your eyes the only lips he has is
[56:46] your lips your hands your feet amen and
[56:49] God he's made us a co-parter with him in
[56:51] this pile of redemption that he would
[56:53] use his body on the Earth
[56:56] to find that last seed amen
[57:02] amen
[57:05] amen he was willing to give everything
[57:09] to get back to the place
[57:11] where he wants was
[57:14] can I say to us tonight myself do I say
[57:17] to us are we willing
[57:20] to give a self-sacrifice
[57:23] to have a move of God
[57:27] well I'm waiting for Brother Sean I'm
[57:29] waiting for Brother John waiting for
[57:30] Brother and oh no
[57:32] maybe God's waiting on you
[57:36] a self-sacrifice well I want to be
[57:39] healed why do you want to be healed for
[57:41] what are you willing to do
[57:45] but remember I'm talking about the girl
[57:46] down in Arkansas that was blind and her
[57:48] daddy got the money and she got
[57:49] separated from me you know the story and
[57:52] she said if you give me to the Healer
[57:53] I'll find my daddy myself
[57:55] I'd rather been prayed for this girl and
[57:57] God opened her eyes and she began to
[57:59] scream remember since she read and then
[58:01] the people said I who is what's blind
[58:04] can now see
[58:06] and the prophet said there was an old
[58:07] fella standing there with a with a the
[58:10] third foot standing there with an old
[58:11] club and he said I know who you are
[58:13] brother Branham
[58:18] I Know Who You Are
[58:20] I've been standing here three days in
[58:23] the rain
[58:26] just to be prayed for sometimes people
[58:29] can't set 30 minutes they start looking
[58:31] how long is he going to preach but here
[58:33] was the man with a twisted up foot but
[58:36] he was willing to stay there three days
[58:38] because he knew there was a God who
[58:41] could do something for him if you
[58:43] believe there's a God who could do
[58:45] something for you then I say to you
[58:47] reach out to him tonight
[58:50] call him on the scene tonight
[58:58] how bad you want a move of God
[59:01] how much do you want God to move in your
[59:03] life are we willing to push our plates
[59:05] back
[59:07] are we willing to spend time in prayer
[59:19] Samson said
[59:22] Samson said
[59:23] come on let me die
[59:25] with the Philistines
[59:27] he bowed himself with all of his might
[59:31] he wouldn't pretended
[59:33] he wasn't going through the motions just
[59:35] raising his hand
[59:38] he meant it
[59:40] with all his might his cry was sincere
[59:43] his heart was honest and the prophet
[59:46] said Christ will appear before any
[59:49] honest heart no matter how insignificant
[59:51] you may seem to be
[59:56] Hallelujah God don't need a prophet to
[59:59] call him on the scene God don't need a
[1:00:01] pastor to call him on the scene he just
[1:00:03] needs someone with an honest heart this
[1:00:05] is God I believe you can do something
[1:00:08] for me
[1:00:09] [Applause]
[1:00:12] he bowed himself with all of his might
[1:00:14] and the Bible said the house fell upon
[1:00:16] the Lords upon all the people that were
[1:00:19] therein so the dead which he slew at his
[1:00:22] death
[1:00:23] were more than that which he slew in his
[1:00:26] life
[1:00:27] three thousand lives
[1:00:31] after a completely surrendered life
[1:00:36] he had his greatest
[1:00:39] victory
[1:00:43] he fulfilled what God sent him to do
[1:00:47] after
[1:00:49] a fully surrendered
[1:00:51] life
[1:00:58] I will give
[1:00:59] Mao
[1:01:01] the prophecy here not long ago in
[1:01:03] Switzerland standing up there in that
[1:01:04] big high Ops Mountain I was thinking
[1:01:06] about Arnold Von Winkler and many of you
[1:01:09] know the story what a gallant hero he
[1:01:11] lives the many years in Switzerland and
[1:01:13] how the Swiss nation was being invaded
[1:01:15] by a mighty Army and the cities were
[1:01:17] being taken and the Gallant blood of
[1:01:19] that Swiss the people congregated from
[1:01:21] the mountains to The Valleys with such
[1:01:23] little weapons as they could defend
[1:01:25] themselves with
[1:01:27] and when they stood there on that field
[1:01:29] and they looked approaching them and
[1:01:30] when they were approached this great
[1:01:32] army they were outnumbered 50 to 1.
[1:01:37] and they were they wasn't soldiers
[1:01:40] they wasn't trained they didn't know
[1:01:43] what to do they didn't have M16s they
[1:01:45] had holes and rakes and pitchforks had
[1:01:48] shovels
[1:01:49] [Applause]
[1:01:52] that's what they had against an army
[1:01:54] that they were outnumbered 50 to one
[1:01:58] they didn't know what to do this Army
[1:02:01] that was invading was well trained every
[1:02:03] man was like a brick wall
[1:02:07] coming right at them
[1:02:09] coming right at this bunch of farmers
[1:02:16] who the only battle they ever had was
[1:02:18] trying to get the cow out of the barn
[1:02:25] and when they were standing there with
[1:02:26] their Spears moving up one great man
[1:02:28] stepped out
[1:02:32] we don't need a house full we just need
[1:02:35] one
[1:02:38] one great man stepped out on a Van
[1:02:40] Winkle and as he stepped out there in
[1:02:42] the presence they were hopeless
[1:02:43] everything they could think of was lost
[1:02:45] they would simply have to go down their
[1:02:47] homes be lost their families would be
[1:02:48] killed the fatherless would be destroyed
[1:02:50] there was nothing they could do it was
[1:02:52] hopeless
[1:02:54] then Arnold Von Winkler stepped out and
[1:02:56] said Swiss Brothers this day
[1:02:58] I will give my life for Switzerland and
[1:03:01] the homelands and they said what will
[1:03:04] you do Arnold he said over on the hill
[1:03:06] you're under I've got a wife I got two
[1:03:09] girls that I love with all my heart
[1:03:12] but this day I will never see them again
[1:03:17] grab your weapons grab your weapons and
[1:03:20] follow me
[1:03:22] and he screamed and threw up his weapon
[1:03:24] and said Make Way for Liberty and he
[1:03:26] started towards that Army he went right
[1:03:27] towards the thickest of the Spears and
[1:03:30] when he got right down to where they was
[1:03:31] a hundred Clement Spears to catch him
[1:03:33] and as he cut me through up his hands
[1:03:35] and said Make Way for Liberty and he
[1:03:36] grabbed a big arm full of those Spears
[1:03:38] had threw them into his chest and each
[1:03:41] one of those switch soldiers followed
[1:03:42] behind him he broke the ranks of the
[1:03:45] enemy and they won a victory like has
[1:03:47] never been won before well I say tonight
[1:03:50] God get us heroes in this meeting that
[1:03:53] are willing to break the ranks of this
[1:03:55] enemy every barrier every hindrance may
[1:03:58] be broken by the power of almighty God
[1:04:00] if we have to pray we'll pray easily at
[1:04:02] the fast will Fast if we have to cry
[1:04:04] we'll cry whatever it takes this day
[1:04:10] if we have to repeat we'll repent
[1:04:12] whatever it takes to bring the victory
[1:04:15] [Applause]
[1:04:18] today
[1:04:20] and today you can mention his name in
[1:04:22] Switzerland and their eyes will color
[1:04:24] with tears and their cheeks will flush
[1:04:26] for their hero
[1:04:28] that was one of the greatest heroes to
[1:04:30] my opinion that's being in Army life
[1:04:34] that's heroism
[1:04:36] seldom compared with and never exceeded
[1:04:39] until one time there was a small thing
[1:04:41] that was the small thing he said
[1:04:43] when the sons of Adam stood in the
[1:04:45] corner
[1:04:46] and the sons of Adam's race and they
[1:04:48] were defeated
[1:04:49] and God sent them law and they couldn't
[1:04:51] keep it they went after something else
[1:04:53] he sent them prophets and they wouldn't
[1:04:54] keep it and there was ignorance in the
[1:04:56] illiteracy and sin and sickness and
[1:04:58] disease breaking down the whole human
[1:05:00] race every Hope was gone that the human
[1:05:03] race could be saved then In Heaven There
[1:05:05] was one who stepped out and said this
[1:05:08] day
[1:05:09] I'll give my life for Adam's race and
[1:05:12] when he looked over the Earth he saw
[1:05:13] where the greatest fear man had was and
[1:05:15] that was death and he read to a certain
[1:05:17] place called Calvary and there he caught
[1:05:20] Death In His bosom that he ascended up
[1:05:23] on high and he said wait Over Yonder
[1:05:25] till you're a dude with power from on
[1:05:27] high he sent back the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:29] said follow me and fight with everything
[1:05:32] you've got to fight with
[1:05:34] [Applause]
[1:05:36] Jesus came he suffered he took the hard
[1:05:40] rugged route he took the route of
[1:05:42] persecution he took the route of death
[1:05:45] this day I will give my all
[1:05:49] for Adams
[1:05:50] race
[1:05:53] and are we
[1:05:54] are we
[1:05:56] this day
[1:05:58] willing to do
[1:06:00] to take the same wrath that he taken are
[1:06:02] we willing to die are we willing to give
[1:06:04] ourselves up to God all the world and
[1:06:07] the things of the world
[1:06:09] to serve you
[1:06:14] are we willing
[1:06:16] you see the Holy Ghost is a gentleman
[1:06:18] he'll not knock your door down
[1:06:20] you must open the door
[1:06:23] you must be willing
[1:06:28] such examples of ultimate sacrifice
[1:06:31] but you see sometimes we think because
[1:06:33] we can't give big
[1:06:35] that our contribution is small so it
[1:06:38] doesn't matter because I I couldn't do
[1:06:40] something like Arnold done I couldn't do
[1:06:42] something like one of these preachers
[1:06:43] could do so you know it don't it don't
[1:06:45] really matter
[1:06:46] sometimes we think because we can't give
[1:06:48] big things that we should give nothing
[1:06:50] at all
[1:06:52] but that's wrong thinking
[1:06:54] because you see what made
[1:06:56] what may not seem like much to you
[1:06:59] is literally everything
[1:07:01] to someone else
[1:07:05] in a soup kitchen in New York
[1:07:07] where they fed the poor they would have
[1:07:09] donations to help feed the poor and
[1:07:12] clean it up after one of the meals
[1:07:14] there was beside a plate 83 cents
[1:07:17] with a note
[1:07:21] and the note said
[1:07:23] please forgive me for the 83 cents
[1:07:26] but it's all I have
[1:07:30] he didn't give a hundred dollars right
[1:07:34] he didn't use Apple pay
[1:07:37] 83 cents
[1:07:39] because that's all
[1:07:43] right
[1:07:50] please forgive me for the 83 seats
[1:07:55] but it's all
[1:07:56] that I have
[1:07:59] look I may not Minister like these
[1:08:01] brothers
[1:08:01] I may not have a Ministry like that I
[1:08:04] may not able to be steamed to just sing
[1:08:06] like some of these people I may not be
[1:08:08] able to pray like someone else
[1:08:10] but let me say when these meetings come
[1:08:12] to the close this day I have given my
[1:08:16] hope
[1:08:18] everything everything
[1:08:19] I have given it
[1:08:25] my Lord
[1:08:29] and George told the story the story of
[1:08:31] King George when they let the school out
[1:08:33] because they was kind of having a parade
[1:08:36] and they gave the little children a flag
[1:08:39] and they were to sing a song when the
[1:08:41] king went by
[1:08:43] and so when it got back to the classroom
[1:08:44] the teacher counted the kids there's a
[1:08:46] little girl missing so she went to find
[1:08:48] her
[1:08:49] and she found her down beside a box of
[1:08:51] mailbox or something like that and the
[1:08:53] little girl's crying
[1:08:55] she said honey are you okay she said yes
[1:08:58] Ma'am
[1:09:00] why are you crying this someone been
[1:09:02] mean to you oh no ma'am no it's been
[1:09:04] well honey why are you crying
[1:09:07] did you see the king yes ma'am I I saw
[1:09:10] the king did you wave your flag with
[1:09:12] everything that was within me did you
[1:09:14] sing that yes ma'am I sung the song
[1:09:17] then honey why are you crying she said
[1:09:19] teacher I saw the king I waved my flag I
[1:09:23] saw my song but she said I was so little
[1:09:27] I saw him
[1:09:29] but he couldn't see
[1:09:33] the brother said that may be true for
[1:09:35] King George
[1:09:37] but it ain't terrific
[1:09:42] he says everything
[1:09:51] he sees the spot that that some people
[1:09:54] would look over but to him it means so
[1:09:56] much
[1:09:58] how do you write notice all she ever
[1:10:01] said when brother Venom told the
[1:10:03] testimony all she said was that's
[1:10:05] nothing but the truth
[1:10:08] but it broke God on the scene
[1:10:10] the puppet said you want a million
[1:10:12] dollars speak it it'll be on the table
[1:10:16] said about the salvation of my two boys
[1:10:18] and they fell across their lap
[1:10:22] the Bible said Jesus said over against
[1:10:24] the treasury and beheld how the people
[1:10:26] cast money into the treasure and many
[1:10:28] that were Rich cast in much and there
[1:10:30] came a certain poor Widow and she threw
[1:10:33] in two mites which make a farthing about
[1:10:35] a half a penny
[1:10:37] a half a penny
[1:10:39] and he watched her and he called unto
[1:10:41] him his disciples and he said unto them
[1:10:43] verily I say unto you this poor Widow
[1:10:46] has cast more in
[1:10:49] then all they which have cast into the
[1:10:52] treasury
[1:10:55] Casper she didn't even put in a penny
[1:10:59] but he said she has put more in than
[1:11:02] everybody else has put in this day
[1:11:05] for all they did they cast from their
[1:11:08] abundance
[1:11:09] from their abundance they might have
[1:11:11] been on the cell phone you know making a
[1:11:13] big business deal or whatever they had
[1:11:14] in the pocket a few hundred just stood
[1:11:16] in and just kept on going but not her
[1:11:20] came in maybe a song stooped over just a
[1:11:24] little purse a Granny's purse you
[1:11:26] remember granny had those purses
[1:11:28] she's holding on to it like a treasure
[1:11:30] because that's what it was to her it was
[1:11:32] a treasure
[1:11:34] she opened it up carefully
[1:11:37] maybe a little bit embarrassed
[1:11:41] and she put it in the Treasure and
[1:11:43] quickly closed the purse to leave
[1:11:46] but Jesus called his disciples said this
[1:11:48] poor Widow has cast more in than all
[1:11:51] they which have cast into the treasury
[1:11:52] for all they did was cast into their
[1:11:54] abundance but she of her walked she of
[1:11:58] her won't nobody made her do it no
[1:12:01] matter if they asked you get what do you
[1:12:03] give it to us
[1:12:04] no
[1:12:06] no she wanted to do it and that's the
[1:12:08] way we need to come to this meeting I
[1:12:09] Want To Praise Him I want to worship him
[1:12:12] I want to see my brother help I want to
[1:12:14] see my sister deliver I want to see a
[1:12:16] move of God you've got to come with the
[1:12:18] world
[1:12:20] but she of her won't get cast in all
[1:12:23] that she had even all her living
[1:12:28] they gave him their abundance it didn't
[1:12:29] mean as much
[1:12:31] but she gave
[1:12:33] her all
[1:12:35] too much seems like nothing
[1:12:37] but I'm so glad with God
[1:12:40] little as much
[1:12:41] if God is in it you see God don't need
[1:12:43] something big
[1:12:45] he just needs something
[1:12:47] yielded
[1:12:53] that would be on a coffee cup
[1:12:57] he said for whosoever shall give you a
[1:12:59] cup of water to drink in my name
[1:13:01] because you belong to Christ fairly I
[1:13:03] said unto you he shall not lose his
[1:13:06] reward
[1:13:08] compared to what others was given her
[1:13:10] seems so unimportant so insignificant
[1:13:13] but to the one who knows the heart he
[1:13:16] knew he knew
[1:13:18] that she had given all right
[1:13:22] and God help me that when we leave these
[1:13:24] meetings
[1:13:25] that he knows
[1:13:28] I've gave
[1:13:30] mom
[1:13:34] you see contributions to this treasure
[1:13:36] was voluntarily it could be paid yearly
[1:13:39] by the Jews for the service of the
[1:13:40] temple and the support of the poor
[1:13:43] nobody forced her to do it she wanted to
[1:13:45] do it
[1:13:46] but think about it if anybody was poor
[1:13:49] it was this woman she didn't even put in
[1:13:52] a penny
[1:13:55] but look at her attitude she thought
[1:13:57] someone was worse off than me perhaps
[1:14:00] they're worse off of me she never
[1:14:02] thought of herself she was thinking of
[1:14:04] others
[1:14:06] and that's perfectly
[1:14:08] eternal life it's not living for
[1:14:10] yourself
[1:14:11] it's living for others you see we are
[1:14:14] living in a selfish society today
[1:14:18] that's right that's why when the lot
[1:14:20] turns green they blow the horn behind
[1:14:22] you automatically because they think
[1:14:24] their part is more important than yours
[1:14:29] they'll say say Amen or else one I don't
[1:14:32] know
[1:14:36] do you know in 2013 Webster every year
[1:14:39] Webster dictionary picks a word of the
[1:14:41] year
[1:14:42] that reflects the mindset of the people
[1:14:45] and they'll pick one for for this side
[1:14:47] of the world and one for the other side
[1:14:48] of the world but in 2013 they picked one
[1:14:51] word that represented the entire world
[1:14:55] you know what that word was
[1:14:57] selfie
[1:15:07] I saw the other day where a woman in
[1:15:09] Texas married herself
[1:15:12] because she said she could find nobody
[1:15:13] that loved her as much as she loved
[1:15:15] herself
[1:15:17] of course if it ends up in a divorce I
[1:15:19] don't know how they split that up
[1:15:25] that's Plum funny I'm sorry they had a
[1:15:28] cake they had a preacher they had
[1:15:30] bridesmaids everything but a groom
[1:15:36] and then Jessica brought me a story well
[1:15:38] where a guy over in Italy married a
[1:15:40] pizza
[1:15:41] she said Daddy look at this this man
[1:15:43] married a pizza
[1:15:45] I said my Lord honey that marriage will
[1:15:46] be still in three days
[1:15:50] [Applause]
[1:15:55] you're going to Pizza marriages do you
[1:15:56] think
[1:16:01] amen
[1:16:03] I'm sorry she never thought of herself
[1:16:07] her thinking was of others and the
[1:16:09] prophet said that's perfectly eternal
[1:16:10] life when we don't live for ourself
[1:16:13] living for others God help me to be like
[1:16:16] that let us not be a people that has
[1:16:18] this attitude what's in it for me what
[1:16:20] can I get out of it but let us come with
[1:16:22] an attitude not only what I can get but
[1:16:24] what Can I Give
[1:16:26] [Music]
[1:16:27] when I was a little boy my daddy had a
[1:16:29] picture in our room of John F Kennedy
[1:16:31] and under the picture was these words
[1:16:33] ask not what your country can do for you
[1:16:35] but ask what you can do for your country
[1:16:38] [Applause]
[1:16:40] and let's not be a people you know that
[1:16:42] that just gives out their access but let
[1:16:44] us be a people who give their all and
[1:16:46] not so much what I can get but when I
[1:16:48] come what can I give to this meeting
[1:16:50] what can I do to help these brothers
[1:16:52] what can I do to help that sister
[1:16:56] because we're a body we need each other
[1:16:59] don't you see friends what Satan's
[1:17:01] always tried to do what's the divide and
[1:17:02] conquer
[1:17:03] he said the American Indian lost this
[1:17:06] country because they were divided among
[1:17:08] themselves
[1:17:10] and there's never been a time I'm I'll
[1:17:12] be 64 in just a few days I've never seen
[1:17:14] a time in my life that this nation is as
[1:17:16] divided as it is right now it's the same
[1:17:18] tactic and now it's moved over into the
[1:17:20] message where he's trying to divide us
[1:17:23] but I say stay behind him stay with
[1:17:26] Christ the word
[1:17:27] [Applause]
[1:17:35] let it not just be a hymn
[1:17:38] let it be a commitment
[1:17:43] but I you know I can't sing like this
[1:17:45] brother and I can't pray like that
[1:17:47] sister
[1:17:48] but whatever you got
[1:17:50] just give it to Jesus like the little
[1:17:51] boy's lunch the prophet said he prayed
[1:17:53] the hooky his mama fixes some biscuits
[1:17:55] and some fish
[1:17:57] and he went over to the meeting and they
[1:17:59] said send the people away they're taking
[1:18:01] feet he said go among the people find
[1:18:03] something to feed him with and he found
[1:18:04] this little boy
[1:18:06] said what you got in that bag little
[1:18:07] fella
[1:18:08] says my lunch
[1:18:10] some biscuits and fish just enough for a
[1:18:13] little boy
[1:18:14] what are you going to do with it well I
[1:18:17] thought about eating it
[1:18:19] well would you give it to Jesus
[1:18:25] Jesus
[1:18:27] wants my lunch
[1:18:29] what's he gonna do with this lunch
[1:18:32] he's going to feed
[1:18:34] this multitude
[1:18:46] Jesus is going to feed this multitude
[1:18:49] with my lunch
[1:18:51] well it ain't much
[1:18:52] it's all I've got
[1:18:54] but if Jesus can use it
[1:18:57] I'll give it to him yeah
[1:19:04] he says those who's in that little boy's
[1:19:06] hand it was still his lunch it was just
[1:19:08] a little boy's lunch just enough to feed
[1:19:10] himself but when he give that what he
[1:19:13] had to Jesus when he'd give it over to
[1:19:15] Jesus what did he do Oh my he fed a
[1:19:18] multitude
[1:19:19] and when they got done what was it if I
[1:19:21] remember right 12 baskets I believe it
[1:19:23] was that they picked up a clock was left
[1:19:25] over and he goes home throws his lunch
[1:19:28] up on the counter and his mama said
[1:19:29] Junior didn't you eat today so oh mama
[1:19:32] did I eat
[1:19:38] oh God
[1:19:42] like the little the widow woman
[1:19:45] she's down in the Middleboro just enough
[1:19:46] left to make one cake
[1:19:50] and she's going to fix it and wasn't
[1:19:51] even going to eat it herself
[1:19:55] you're probably going to tell her son
[1:19:56] she wasn't hungry
[1:19:59] I had a moment like that God missed her
[1:20:01] soul
[1:20:03] was born poor I see my mama act like she
[1:20:06] wasn't hungry so we'd have something to
[1:20:08] eat
[1:20:09] and perhaps this way she was she thought
[1:20:12] I just
[1:20:14] I'll just make the cake for junior and I
[1:20:15] tell him Mama's not hungry
[1:20:18] then I'll set him on my lap and we'll
[1:20:19] wait for death so she mixed up the oil
[1:20:21] and the flower and all to make the cake
[1:20:23] and she goes out into the into the yard
[1:20:26] to pick up two sticks but little did she
[1:20:28] know that God had already ordained a
[1:20:30] prophet to go to her house
[1:20:33] and she went out to pick up those two
[1:20:35] sticks what did they represent a
[1:20:37] sacrifice Calvary
[1:20:40] and as she turned to go back into the
[1:20:42] house she heard a voice
[1:20:44] said would you bring me a drink
[1:20:47] you see he was just she probably had
[1:20:49] more water than she had food
[1:20:52] and he was a condo fella she said oh oh
[1:20:54] oh yes sir I'll I'll give you some water
[1:20:58] I'll share my water with you we're going
[1:21:00] to die anyway I'll I'll sacrifice my
[1:21:02] drink of water to you
[1:21:06] so when she turned to get the water
[1:21:09] then she heard and
[1:21:12] bring me a cake
[1:21:15] now
[1:21:16] he's not just asking for water but he's
[1:21:19] asking for everything
[1:21:21] she has
[1:21:23] and see this wasn't for herself if it
[1:21:26] had just been for her readily but now
[1:21:28] she's faced with decision and am I going
[1:21:30] to give this kind old man that cake
[1:21:33] that I was going to give my son
[1:21:40] yes
[1:21:42] but she was willing
[1:21:44] to give everything to this man
[1:21:49] and when she did
[1:21:52] you see he wasn't just asking for water
[1:21:54] now he's asking for all she had and she
[1:21:57] thought this day
[1:21:59] I'll give it all the way
[1:22:01] and when she committed to surrendering
[1:22:03] what she had to the prophet there came
[1:22:07] the words that every True Believer longs
[1:22:10] to hear thus saith the Lord
[1:22:17] brothers did maybe you're called like
[1:22:19] that this morning to give up your
[1:22:21] what your unbelief to give up everything
[1:22:22] you've got to take the all in the word
[1:22:25] and mix it together and put it on an
[1:22:27] altar of self-sacrifice you'll find out
[1:22:29] it's a color God on the scene as certain
[1:22:31] as I'm standing in this Pulpit I
[1:22:33] surrendered life that's willing to give
[1:22:35] everything we'll call God on the scene
[1:22:37] every time
[1:22:40] I wonder today if God leads us to a life
[1:22:42] of complete surrender and service to him
[1:22:44] I wonder if our Spirits then sometimes
[1:22:46] don't rebel I wonder if we're lamb see a
[1:22:49] lamb is obedient a lamb is
[1:22:50] self-sacrificial it doesn't it doesn't
[1:22:52] take it claims its own it can lay right
[1:22:55] down and Shear the wool off of it that's
[1:22:56] the only thing it's got but it never
[1:22:58] says anything about it it just
[1:23:00] sacrifices everything it's got that's a
[1:23:02] lamb it gives everything away itself and
[1:23:06] all it is and that's the way a real
[1:23:08] Christian is
[1:23:09] their self-sacrifice thinking themselves
[1:23:13] self-sacrificing themselves rather
[1:23:15] carrying nothing for this world
[1:23:18] but giving all they've got
[1:23:22] to God
[1:23:27] amen
[1:23:29] there was a man
[1:23:32] had a little girl
[1:23:35] she was dying on life support
[1:23:39] and this man said father
[1:23:41] I give her to you
[1:23:44] because I can't help her
[1:23:46] I give her to you
[1:23:48] you see as long as that man helped that
[1:23:51] little girl's life all he had was a baby
[1:23:54] girl on a ventilator
[1:23:57] but when he gave her to God
[1:24:01] God raised her up
[1:24:03] and gave her back to that man and healed
[1:24:07] her and restored her you say how do you
[1:24:10] know that
[1:24:11] because I was the man it was my little
[1:24:14] girl and when I gave her to God a few
[1:24:17] years later I was out and the Lord spoke
[1:24:19] to me and said because you gave me
[1:24:21] Jessica I gave Jessica back to you and I
[1:24:24] say give that wayward son give that
[1:24:26] Wayward Daughter give that arthritis
[1:24:28] give that sugar diabetes give that fear
[1:24:31] give that depression whatever it is just
[1:24:34] give it to God and see what God's able
[1:24:36] to do with it
[1:24:43] could have just a little bit more time
[1:24:48] a few years ago
[1:24:51] I was able to go down to Tennessee
[1:24:52] Stadium the volunteer football stadium
[1:24:56] I really don't care much about Volunteer
[1:24:58] football I couldn't even tell you who
[1:24:59] plays
[1:25:00] but I had the opportunity I thought it'd
[1:25:02] be nice to go see that Stadium it's a
[1:25:03] huge Stadium holds what was it 96 000
[1:25:05] fans or 105 000 something like that
[1:25:09] so I take this tour
[1:25:11] and so they would go into the locker
[1:25:13] room
[1:25:14] and when we go into the locker room this
[1:25:16] is nice carpet
[1:25:19] but man I'm telling you that coverage is
[1:25:21] oh
[1:25:22] it's kind of I thought man and they come
[1:25:24] in here with cleats on
[1:25:26] but they just kind of sunk into it it
[1:25:28] was just so thick
[1:25:29] and I was looking around brother Kelly
[1:25:31] and they had all these names above the
[1:25:33] locker and I got the looking and there
[1:25:35] was Peyton Manning and Reggie White and
[1:25:38] men who had played for Tennessee who had
[1:25:40] done great things for Tennessee and they
[1:25:42] had their name above the locker so that
[1:25:44] when you had that Locker you could look
[1:25:45] up and say I I've got Reggie watch
[1:25:47] Locker I've got Peyton Manning's locker
[1:25:49] and I was looking at it and I thought
[1:25:50] you know God's got a locker room
[1:25:54] he's got a Moses and the Daniel and the
[1:25:56] David
[1:26:00] say if God was able to use that man God
[1:26:02] can use me
[1:26:08] and I got to look it around and out here
[1:26:10] there was two double doors and above it
[1:26:12] there was a sign
[1:26:13] and the sign said this day I will give
[1:26:16] my all for Tennessee
[1:26:18] and there's a picture there and what
[1:26:20] those ball players do when they run out
[1:26:22] onto that field
[1:26:23] they get in that locker room and they
[1:26:25] start they start jumping up and down and
[1:26:26] they start packing each other on the
[1:26:28] pads and smacking each other in the
[1:26:29] helmet
[1:26:31] so don't be beating on each other but
[1:26:33] that's the way we ought to come to
[1:26:34] church is excited excited don't knock
[1:26:37] your neighbor out now I'm not saying
[1:26:38] that but what I'm saying is we ought to
[1:26:40] come through these doors excited
[1:26:43] pumped up amen oh fire
[1:26:46] [Applause]
[1:26:48] you know I got on fire one time
[1:26:55] I was out burning some leaves I don't
[1:26:56] know ragged pair of pants and I was
[1:26:59] kicking them up into the leaves up into
[1:27:00] that fire and I stand there on a hole
[1:27:02] like this
[1:27:03] and all of a sudden my legs started
[1:27:05] getting warm I thought man my legs off
[1:27:06] of one
[1:27:07] another
[1:27:09] I looked down and said Jimmy crickets
[1:27:11] I'm on fire
[1:27:15] do you know what I've done
[1:27:17] I said
[1:27:19] my goodness look at that
[1:27:23] Rich it's almost up to my knee
[1:27:27] what's Cheryl going to say
[1:27:30] no I didn't do that at all scream like a
[1:27:32] wall
[1:27:39] get off my britches I'm not kidding I
[1:27:40] was on fire
[1:27:42] and friends when we're on fire let me
[1:27:44] tell you from the front row to the back
[1:27:45] road somebody knows it
[1:27:47] oh God left me with the fire Hallelujah
[1:27:50] that the world could see that I'm
[1:27:52] burning that the world knows I'm burning
[1:27:55] Hallelujah let him know I've met the god
[1:27:57] of fire I met the God who changed me who
[1:28:00] saved me who delivered me Hallelujah
[1:28:03] who's gonna change my body let the world
[1:28:06] know you're on fire
[1:28:13] and I was looking at these pictures that
[1:28:16] they had them everywhere and they had a
[1:28:18] picture of what these guys would do is
[1:28:20] that when they would run out that door
[1:28:21] they would be there and the doors would
[1:28:24] open and they would run out onto the
[1:28:26] field of 96
[1:28:28] 000 screaming fans
[1:28:31] but when they went out those doors they
[1:28:33] would open they would smack that sign
[1:28:35] this day I give my all for Tennessee
[1:28:38] this day
[1:28:40] going out that
[1:28:44] I've got a sign above my garage
[1:28:47] coming out of my laundry room through
[1:28:48] the end of the garage says this day I
[1:28:51] will give my all for Jesus Christ
[1:28:57] because
[1:29:00] when I saw that brother window I thought
[1:29:02] I thought these guys
[1:29:05] they're willing to give their all for
[1:29:07] Tennessee they're willing to go out
[1:29:08] there to sweat
[1:29:10] to get bruised to get blooded to break
[1:29:13] bones to be paralyzed even some of them
[1:29:17] have died all for the sake of give them
[1:29:19] six Tennessee
[1:29:22] and I thought oh God if they can do that
[1:29:24] if they can slap that sign and run out
[1:29:26] onto that field God give me Grace
[1:29:28] Hallelujah that when I come through
[1:29:30] those doors back there I will say this
[1:29:32] meeting this night I will give my all if
[1:29:35] I have to sweat I swear if I have to cry
[1:29:38] cry amen when I come through those doors
[1:29:40] I want to be the best day man that I can
[1:29:43] be the best Hallelujah I can be I want
[1:29:45] to give my all for Jesus Christ and when
[1:29:49] this meeting is over I can save this day
[1:29:51] this day this day I gave my own
[1:30:01] for Jesus Christ
[1:30:04] you know why
[1:30:07] he gave us all for me
[1:30:11] this day whether I feel good or whether
[1:30:15] I don't whether my back's hurting or
[1:30:17] whether it ain't this day feelings
[1:30:20] emotion has nothing to do with it I have
[1:30:22] been called To Praise My Lord the Bible
[1:30:25] said that everything that half breath
[1:30:27] praise ye the Lord
[1:30:32] do you realize every time you praise the
[1:30:35] Lord you're giving the devil a black eye
[1:30:36] every time you're praised in the midst
[1:30:38] of your trial in the midst of your
[1:30:40] troubles and you throw up your hand and
[1:30:42] you begin to praise God and thank you
[1:30:44] for his goodness and his healing and his
[1:30:46] virtue and it's Deliverance you know
[1:30:48] what you're doing you're stopping that
[1:30:49] devil under your feet
[1:30:52] [Applause]
[1:30:57] when Ali my youngest was a little old
[1:30:58] girl I was preaching up in Kentucky
[1:31:00] we're standing outside after service I
[1:31:02] was talking to the Brother Ali was
[1:31:03] standing beside me she's about this high
[1:31:05] right here she's standing beside me and
[1:31:07] I was talking to the brother and now he
[1:31:09] goes
[1:31:10] I thought what in the world I said
[1:31:13] and I said something else he goes
[1:31:16] I said
[1:31:18] I said something else she goes
[1:31:21] I said Ali what are you doing you're
[1:31:22] ruining my Ministry
[1:31:25] behave I said what are you doing she
[1:31:28] goes it's a bug Daddy it's a bug and I
[1:31:31] look down this bug was running around
[1:31:32] it's just trying to stomp it oh that's
[1:31:34] what you need to do you need to realize
[1:31:36] the devil he ain't nothing but a bug
[1:31:39] the Bible said every devil every devil
[1:31:42] the message says every devil is under
[1:31:44] our feet under our feet amen you need to
[1:31:47] tell him you're under my feet oh boy and
[1:31:50] I come to stomp you down
[1:31:53] all right
[1:31:55] this day I will give my all for Jesus
[1:31:58] Christ
[1:32:00] Jesus hold the cross look at him hang in
[1:32:03] there they'd beat him till they couldn't
[1:32:05] beat him anymore his blood pouring out
[1:32:07] his sweat pouring out his tears he
[1:32:10] helped nothing back
[1:32:13] he never gave him his excess he never
[1:32:16] gave him his abundance he gave his all
[1:32:20] everything he had and the dying Thief
[1:32:23] watching him one began to mock him he
[1:32:26] said get us down if you are who they say
[1:32:29] you are Jesus never answered him a word
[1:32:35] but the other Thief
[1:32:37] notice his attitude he said leave him
[1:32:40] alone
[1:32:42] he's done nothing wrong we are getting
[1:32:44] what we deserve
[1:32:47] and he began to notice as we close he
[1:32:50] began to give Jesus his praise he gave
[1:32:53] Jesus his confession he gave Jesus his
[1:32:55] proper place what he was able to forgive
[1:33:00] and he said to him remember me
[1:33:06] remember me
[1:33:10] this dying thief on a cross didn't have
[1:33:14] money
[1:33:15] didn't have a checkbook
[1:33:16] all he had was the words of his heart
[1:33:24] leave him alone he's done nothing wrong
[1:33:25] we're getting what we deserve
[1:33:30] he began to praise him
[1:33:32] he's beginning to give him his proper
[1:33:33] place
[1:33:34] and then he said would you remember me
[1:33:41] Jesus in his dying moments on the cross
[1:33:44] he pushed up
[1:33:47] and trying to breathe in
[1:33:49] he said
[1:33:50] this day
[1:33:52] this day
[1:33:56] you
[1:34:00] with me
[1:34:07] this day

[1:34:14] said listen
[1:34:16] what God's only trying to do as we come
[1:34:18] book close
[1:34:20] he's trying to find one person
[1:34:23] he can get in his hands
[1:34:27] he's always tried to do that all done
[1:34:30] through the Bible he found in Isaiah one
[1:34:32] time he found a Jeremiah
[1:34:34] you've got to give your all to God
[1:34:38] your reverence your respect your
[1:34:40] everything that you are just be nothing
[1:34:43] just see how little you are and that's
[1:34:46] what God wants us to do
[1:34:48] that's real
[1:34:50] humility
[1:34:52] is just simply giving God everything
[1:34:56] we are
[1:35:05] but said Lord
[1:35:06] they come for self-sacrifice
[1:35:09] that come to fill that hot burning fire
[1:35:10] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll
[1:35:13] light up the Cross of Christ in their
[1:35:14] hearts and will fill them with power and
[1:35:16] glory and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:18] granted Lord
[1:35:22] you've got to come
[1:35:24] the way Jesus came
[1:35:26] through a self-sacrifice given your all
[1:35:30] to God walking up to Calvary to be
[1:35:33] crucified with him and Rise Again to
[1:35:35] where His Garment of sacrifice and death
