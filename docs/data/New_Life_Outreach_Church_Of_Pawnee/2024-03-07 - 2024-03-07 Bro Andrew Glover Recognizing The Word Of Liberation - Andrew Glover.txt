then we're going to look in the book of Hebrews the fourth chapter we'll begin in the book of Exodus the 2 chapter tonight and we do want to say we appreciate brother Wendell appreciate brother Colby brother Josh the assembly here for their vision for these meetings and amen just to see what the Lord Has Done amen it's a wonderful thing to see how the Lord has bless the meetings here in the camp

ministering with him once again and amen I believe it's just going to be a good weekend don't you amen the book of Exodus the 2nd chapter and in the 23rd verse the Bible here says and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage I want you to notice they were not just crying in vain but their cry Was Heard and the Bible says God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant so when they begin to cry God begin to remember his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them another word for respect is favor so God had favor faor unto them now in the book of Hebrews the 4th chapter the book of Hebrews the 4th chapter I want to look at the 12th verse it's a very a very familiar scripture to us as Believers here tonight in Hebrews chapter 4 and verse number 12 Paul here writing in Hebrews 4 and12 and he says for the word of God is quick and Powerful somebody say powerful powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword and piercing even to the dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen the word of God is quick it is powerful sharper than any two-edged sword it is piercing even to the dividing of sunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon amen we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God Amen I want you tonight by the help of the Lord for just a few moments on this opening night tonight if I would speak to you here I want to speak to you on recognizing the word of Liberation amen recognizing the word of Liberation when you look at that word Liberation it is the act of setting someone free from imprisonment from slavery or oppress ression it is to release it is freedom from limits on thoughts or behavior so when something is liberated it is liberating the way you think and it is liberating the way you act amen Liberation will release you from the limits of thought amen and Behavior now in 1947 the message the angel of God brother says this may every heart here be circumcised May the ears be circumcised to hear the word of God and circumcise the lips of the servant to speak that which is right and may great Powers be brought forth this afternoon in Liberation for the people may everyone that comes to the platform come with that one single mind this is my time and I shall be liberated this is my time and I shall be liberated if others are so can I amen amen I love that if others have been liberated amen that it was not just for one generation but it is for all generation amen so can and I may they not be silent but in the City walk the streets and Testify the next week giving praise and glory to God and may it start even in the merchants and all father until there is a Great Awakening here that they might know that the spirit of God still has the preeminence anywhere amen I want to say the spirit of God has the preeminence anywhere any place any time amen under any condition so we may not be in our home churches we may not be around our our normal friends but we're here to tonight and the same spirit that has the preeminence there has the preeminence here and he said and you can Pierce into the darkest places and pull amen those out who were crying amen the spirit of God can Pierce into the darkest of places and can pull those out who are crying now when you start talking about this you know that we're talking about the word right and the word amen is a Searcher Jeremiah 23:24 says can any hide himself in secret places amen that I shall not see him sayith the Lord do not I feel the Heaven and Earth sayeth the Lord in Amos 9 and3 the Bible said though they hide themselves in the top of caramel I will search and take them out fence and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea amen then will I command The Serpent and he shall bite them now watch this he's telling them that God is the Searcher amen and he knows where his children are amen as well as he knows where his children's enemies are amen and the enemies cannot hide no more than the child can hide amen a child can run from God but if his name is on the Lamb's Book of Life amen God is going to get a hold of him and he's going to claim him and change him for his purpose amen and the same devil amen that does not want you to fulfill your purpose amen that devil cannot hide from God either amen because God said if he goes to the Bottom of the Sea amen he will not defeat me I will move up on a serpent amen deide him in the bottom of the sea listen my God will not be defeated he is a deliverer he is a Savor amen he is a redeemer amen and his spirit is here tonight and he has the preeminence wherever his word has the preeminence he has their preeminence there Paul says he that searcheth a heart amen knoweth what is the mind of the spirit amen because he maketh intercession for the Saints according Amen to the will of God so we can all agree amen that the word liberates the church amen it's not the preach it's not the Deacon it's not the Evangelist it's not even the prophet amen it's the word that brings The Liberation on the church and the prophet said brother we ought to preach amen The Liberation from sin amen I think if there's ever been a time to declare amen that there's a generation that can live above unbelief they can live above doubt they can live above confusion amen I say now is the time to declare it amen cuz we have received the message of the hour and the message of the hour is more than a Doctrine amen it's more than a religion amen it is the word of Liberation and if that word finds preeminence in a meeting it'll Liberate the young it'll Liberate the old come on there ain't no devil can hide amen from the word of Liberation I believe we ought to preach the word of Liberation I believe we ought to pull on the word of Liberation now you know what that word pull means it means to exert Force Amen on someone or something amen so as to cause movement towards oneself it is an act of taking a hold of something and exerting Force to draw it toward one a force drawing someone or something into a particular direction amen or course of action can I say this we exert force on God Amen by crying out to him the way that we exert some force on God is we cry out to him as a Believer then we have a right Amen to pull on God Amen or to draw from God the desire of our heart brother said every True Believer is in the hand of God how many True Believers have we got and can and can DW from his love and his power and receive the full benefit amen of all that God is to the believer amen let me say this we're not just pulling on the word we're not just pulling and pulling and pulling amen but I believe we are pulling and receiving amen amen I believe we're pulling on the word of Liberation and we are receiving Liberation I believe we're pulling on the word of healing and we are receiving healing we are pulling on the Word of Deliverance and we are receiving Deliverance listen amen this is not a meet built upon a bunch of emotion amen it's built upon the word amen and the word alone and the reason why is because the word will defeat the Devil anywhere anytime any place under any condition if somebody will preach the word and somebody will pull on the word then the liberating spirit of God will come into the meeting and will liberate from the front to the back from the left to the right I believe it's time to get free again I believe it's time to let the word amen have its way in our lives and free us from Fear free us from doubt free us from confusion free us from skepticism free us from all kinds of unbelief and come back to the Liberty where in Christ has made us free amen I don't think we're just pulling I believe we're pulling and receiving and whatever we are drawing from God Amen is coming from an unseen resource amen and it's coming through Christ brother man preaches a beautiful sermon he calls it Awakening Jesus he said it must have been a hard day for him he was tired his body was worn out you know as he went along amen the people drew God out of him I love that the people drew God out of him they drew their desires from him now the Bible says in the beginning was the word right and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so when you saw Jesus you seen the Flesh of God when you saw Jesus all that was in God he poured into Jesus Christ so when you saw Jesus you were not just pulling up on the flesh amen that come from the womb of Mary amen CZ he was not a part of Mary she was only an incubator amen but you were pulling from the spirit amen and the spirit has the preeminence anywhere and the prophet of God said they drew their desires from him now I believe that our desires will be met in these meetings I don't believe we drove 14 15 five or six or however many hours to get here and just leave here without our desires I believe our God is in the building tonight amen to manifest our desires amen according to his will and his will is his word brother said God don't clown for people he's got a purpose of doing things amen God don't just do things at random or to please unbelievers amen but he works his will amen men to fulfill his promises amen when God begins to work he is not working according to the Motions of the crowd or according to the way somebody feels but he is working according to his purpose which is his will which is his word and listen friends there's nothing can defeat that word amen that word is a saving word that word is a Redeeming Word and if you'll begin to pull on that word you will exert force on God and he will come into this camp meeting this weekend he will tear the walls of Jericho down he will open up the Red Sea he will break the backbone of the devil he will shut the mouths of the Lions he's God and he's God alone and he can do what he wants when he wants how he wants because he's God and there's no God above him and there's no God beside him and there's no God with him my God is God and he's God Alone he's got everything I have need of I need Joy pull on him I need an answer pull on him I need a Vision pull on him I need direction pull on him he alone has the vision of Our Lives he is work his will to fulfill his promises 2 Chronicles 15:15 the Bible said all Judah Rejoice at the oath for they had sworn with all their hearts and sought him with her whole desire and he was found of them I love what David said in Psalms 27:4 he said one thing have I desired one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple in Psalm 63:1 David again says oh God Thou Art my God and early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee how many says that to me Lord my soul is thirsting for thee amen My Flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is now here's what David wanted to see he wanted to see thy power amen and thy Glory he wanted to see the power of his word and the manifestation of the glory of his presence so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary in Isaiah 269 amen with My Soul have I desired thee in the night yay with my spirit Within Me will I seek the early for when thy judgments are in the earth amen the inhabitants of the world will learn amen righteousness I love Psalms 38 ver9 David again here says Lord amen All My Desire is before thee amen All My Desire is before thee listen why come all the way down here and have a meeting with our heart all closed up amen why try to hide things from God and hide things from the anointing and hide things from the spirit I think we ought to say on the first night God I'm opening up every door of my heart you walk in the door of private life you walk in the door of Faith you walk in the door of Pride every door of my heart I'm opening up to you amen I don't want to leave here with any secrets I don't want to leave here with with anything amen I want to leave here with my desires Amen manifested in my life as you have promised your word is able to do Lord All My Desire is before thee and my groaning is not hid from thee look at this word desire it is wish it is longing of one's heart it is the appetite look at this word groaning it is sign or groaning it is expression of grief or physical distress remember said see if your desires is in your heart is Right amen then your appetite's right then you will eat and do the right thing because it's in your heart to do it now let me say this feeding on the word amen puts faith in people's hearts Amen to believe for the manifestation of their desires amen at the same time that they're asking it can I say this to you amen I I it's in here so I might as well preach amen we're living in the season amen where prayer request can turn into testimonies in the same service we're living in the season we're expectation can become manifestations in the same service listen we're living in the season amen where the deaf are hearing and the bind are sin and the dead are being raised and demons are being cast out and the sick is being healed and power manifestation of God is coming into manifestation do you know why amen because this is the generation of an open book this is the generation of the third pull and there is a direct connection between the third pull and the desire of your heart are y'all hearing me amen this is the season where you can come in a prayer line and ask for a prodal and before the service is over they can be in the building this is the season where you can come up in a prayer line and say I got a cancer in my body and before you get back to your seed it can be gone are you hearing me this is the season where the desires of your heart are not remaining desires but they are becoming manifested desires Hallelujah Lord trust and he said you'll put Faith in the people's heart and know that I haven't misled them or said one thing wrong I said it just the way it come to me the best that I know in my heart Lord watching over my words and weighing them knowing that you've confirmed that to me as I have said seven times and knowing immediately after that on the first human being I ever spoke to amen she got the desire of her heart amen the moment that she spoke you know what he's talking about he's talking about hady R and he's talking about his new min hisory which was the third pool that when he went down there and told about those squirrels being spoken to existence amen hady R had a desire in her heart amen listen William brandham had no ability Amen to go do something for those boys those boys were bound under unbelief they were bound under confusion they were bound under doubts amen but the word of Liberation had come into the midst and there was little Fifth Gospel that recognized if he created squirrels he can create a desire in in the heart of my boys oh may I announce to you that same God is in this building tonight and if he did it for Hattie If He Did It for the squirrels if he did it in the meeting if he did it in the If He Did It for the little fish he can do it for you because he's the god of Liberation and his word can go in the darkest of places and pull you out brother said the very moment she spoke at the very moment she got the desire he said now Lord there's many desires here this morning you have to anoint your servant Lord if you'll just send the anointing and let me have it this morning if anyone should need you to speak Lord when they speak or whoever you wish and let it come to pass then let me say this there is a direct connection between the third pull and the receiving of the desires of your heart are you hearing me amen it was just a few years ago Amen brother Timothy in your church at a little girl come up amen for prayer for her brother it wasn't four Services later he showed up but the same night that she was Desiring the salvation of his soul was the same night he come walking in the building listen I've seen it with my own eyes in South Carolina years ago in a prayer line where brother jeel a woman come up and said Lord I need prayer Brothers I need prayer Lord I need you to move my husband's left me her babies are starving her pills are backing up amen we begin to pray that man was a drunk he was out in the world but about 20 minutes later I looked up in the back and here he comes staggering in the church that he used to be a deacon in come staggered and their drunk but today he's still serving God Amen because there is a Liberation in the power of the word of God if we'll just preach this message it'll liberate every home if we'll just preach this message it'll liberate every church if we'll just preach this message it'll liberate our young people it'll liberate our elders amen CU this message has come as the answer to the devil's question as the power of God under salvation listen we're not here just pulling pulling pulling we're receiving under the operation of the Holy Ghost the energy of God is in the building amen and we are believing that when people's Faith amen gets up to a place they will get the blessings to realize it's theirs then the same operation of the holy spirit will be operating in the church like it did back there can I say this as God reveals himself and we receive Faith by the revelation of himself we receive what we have needed of in other words the prophet said May Our Lives be so fitted with that word that the word will become flesh Among Us and will give the people Faith to draw from their account in heaven now do you all realize you got an account and it's not done with Wells Fargo and it's not with City Bank amen but you got an account in heaven and the prophet of God said which Jesus settled for them a long time ago for their sins and their sickness for their Journey now if you go on a journey am mean you can plan that Journey plan what you're going to do plan where you're going to stay plan how you're going to get there you can make all kinds of plans for the journey amen but the deciding factor on if the car is leaving the garage or not is is there enough money in the bank to make the trip out there and make the trip back amen so you got to start calculating numbers y'all know what I'm talking about amen trying to get everything together amen cuz you got to have enough funds to get where you're going and get back where you come from amen listen but when it come time for your journey amen God didn't put it in Wells Fargo he didn't put it in City Bank amen but that day on Calvary according to Isaiah 53 Calvary was formed and there was an atonement made and there was a deposit put into every account for the sin of Our Lives for the sickness of our bodies listen we're not a bunch of poor peasants we are the sons and daughters of God under the Dominion of a king and he owns the cattle on the Thousand Hill listen he didn't save you to lose you he didn't didn't find you to lose you he didn't teach you to swim to let you drown but he called you and he chose you and he sustained you and he anointed you for a Time such as this listen you got the checkbook C the check I said you got the checkbook it's time to write the check everything you need in this journey amen is in your account tonight can I say this to you it was not deposited the day you got saved it was not deposited amen the day the doctor said there was something on the scan it was not deposited amen the hour that you heard about the message but before the foundation of the world there was a predestinated seed that was deposited on the inside of your soul and that is your right to every Redemptive blessing you are not a serpent seed you are a son and a daughter of the most high God if anybody got a right to believe for the impossible you got a right to believe if anybody got a right to preach the unsearchable Riches of Christ we got a right to preach it brother because we are a part of Heaven's bank account there's healing in the account there's joy in the account there's victory in the account there's power in the account there's miracles in the account there's a power of the Holy Ghost in the account won't you draw from it tonight w't you draw from your account you need healing get it out of the bank you need salvation get it out of the bank it's already in there I didn't put it there God put it there Isaiah 53 he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed brother BR said like this brother wend all in the same day by the same man come on Church all in the same day brother Nathaniel by the same man so there is no question on is there insufficient funds amen he didn't give it to three different gods and say deposit this in Katie's account he didn't give it to three different gods and say deposit in Mah's account amen but the same day he died was the same day that he deposited everything Hallelujah was the same day he deposited everything that you would have need of for this journey here proba God said Inseparable it runs parallel one to the other he said the blood was coming from his back and the blood coming from his wound he said now watch now think about this young people the blood was coming from his back and then there was blood coming from his side he said but watch it all mixed together and run off of his feet I ain't got time to preach here for an hour it all mixed together and where did it run off of his feet and what is the foot a sign of it is a sign of judgment so when the blood from his back amen run down the side and the blood from his side met the blood from his back the blood for your healing and the blood for your salvation met together and they met on his feet so that means he's already judged your sin he's already judged your sickness he's already judged everything that the devil would try to hold against you I might as well say it you're free tonight by the blood of Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost I think it's high time to clown up on top of the mountain and say by the word of Liberation the blood has Set Me Free I'm free from sickness I'm free from sin I'm free from depression I'm free from complexes well it's a good night to get free again I'm free devil you can't hold me no longer the price has been paid the money is in the bank the salvation's in my soul the healings in my body devil get out of here there's money in the bank [Applause] come on I said there's money in the bank well brother Andrew I don't know if I can enjoy this meeting God put the money in the bank so you could come to Oklahoma camp and enjoy the liberty of the word of God watch your prophit salvation healing peace satisfaction Joy everything we have need of this Earthly Journey was met in Calvary even the Rapture is right in you now let me say something because it's in you there's something calling because it's in you there's something calling now watch a prophet and things that are to be he said there's something in us that calls somebody say calls to live and there's something in us that calls to do right he said then God will call somebody on the platform or the pit that will preach the absolute truth why because it shows then if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out out so when the word of Liberation comes into the building amen and begins to be preached amen if you are a real child of that word then something in you begins to cry out in other words it's call and response I'm getting in another sermon here amen but let me say like this the pro of God I heard him pray the other day brother Joel he said I'm thankful to be in a meeting he said and to preach to people he said that the word responds to glory to God that's Shout T right there amen we're always talking about respond to the word respond to the word amen but what if I told you tonight that you are a people that the word responds to you so it's not oh God it's not just you responding to the word but the word comes in here and the word responds to you you say Lord I need healing and the word comes right to where you're sting and puts healing in your body you say Lord I need the Holy Ghost and the word comes right to where you're sitting and baptizes you every fire of your being with the Holy Ghost the word says I need deliverance and you say God I need it and the word comes walking right down Hallelujah and gives you a Deliverance you know why because you're not just a people that responds to the word but the word responds to you the word responds to you and you say this God take it away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me now this is my note in other words liberate me you're the only one that can do it Lord so since you're here just go ahead and do it why because it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's gone to prepare see you got to be a real word bride of Christ now can I say this we are not an emotional bride we are not serving God when the emotions are high and bellyaching when they're low we are a word bride so the word dictates Our Praise come on now come on the word dictates our feelings brother Merl the word dictates the way we think about things the way we remember things the word comes into our midst and somebody recognizes that it's more than just a spit and sweating preacher but it's the word of Liberation and it's a quick word it's a powerful word it's an absolute word and when you to hear that word you may be in the lows of rose and the devil said he going to get you amen but I tell you what my God can do my God can get on that serpent that's CAU you and cause that devil to turn loose of you and release you from the bottom of that situation and you'll come right back up to the top and you'll say I'm stronger now than I've ever been before I want to say this devil you will not bury this bride you will not bury this revival you will not bury this generation we have been born by the Breath of God there is is a wind of God there is an authority of God in this bride and she knows she knows what she's hearing is the word let me just say this we have the Vindicated identifying characteristic of the true Ministry you know what it is preach the word preach the word now come on if we're going to preach something let's just goad have church okay preach the word because the word is the only thing that will separate you from the thing that's trying to condemn you the Bible said preach the word you be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine now watch this the true fivefold ministry will preach the absolute truth which is the word in John 8:31 Jesus said if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free let me just back up here and get real Elementary for a second ye shall know the truth Lord how shall we know the truth okay God will send a preacher and the preacher will preach the absolute truth and you will be delivered by the preaching of the absolute truth so can I just goad and say it in other words if you get a microphone and you get a pullit preach the message oh God I'm going to get in trouble but I'm here I might as well preach is it too much to ask anymore just preach the message leave your ideas and your feelings and your Traditions out of it and just say what a prophet said until the pillar of fire comes in the building and begins to manifest itself in power and deliverance I say the devil don't like it but we love it we're going to say what a prophet said until ever devil is defeated I want to go on record I stand with this message I stand with William Brandon I stand with what he taught on every subject from 37 to 65 from Genesis to Revelation when it looks like it's his opinion I still stand with him because the pillar of fire stood with him and if the pillar of fire stood with him you better believe this old country boy or stand with him cuz whatever he said got backed up whatever he preached the angel amen and that same Angel is in this building tonight so we stand with the message of the hour this Youth Camp stands with the message of the hour we don't stand with your ideas we don't stand with your opinions but we stand with the say Lord through the seventh Angels message because it's the truth I said it's the truth I think that devil got out of here it's the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free I want you to remember that the word make it's only showing what's coming this week in the spiritual if the son therefore shall make make you free ye shall be free indeed look at this word make to set at Liberty are you ready for this from the Dominion of sin now brother ask a very simple question you know what he says he said what is the truth now there's a lot of people got a lot of answers but brother brandham answered it so let's just say what he said okay and he said Thy word is the truth brother said Janice and jambers whed Moses remember that and the Bible said as they stood Moses in the last days they would reappear those Spirits again now when are those Spirits going to reappear just before the liberation of the people he said Hallelujah The Liberation time is here so when you see Janice and jambers appear again to withstand Moses you can automatically look and say the hour of Liberation is here the protag God said see why because if you believe in the truth then the truth will will always speak for itself you never have to strain truth are you ready for this truth will always be truth can I say this this message is the truth regardless of what anybody says anybody thinks anybody interprets this message is the truth now can I go on and say this it's the truth on the mountain it's the truth in the valley it's the truth in the hospital it's the truth in the church it's the truth Truth at school it's the truth at Youth Camp wherever this message is it's the truth you can put it in a jail and it's the truth you can put it in the pits of hell and it's still the truth because truth never changes ah Hallelujah he said I wish to preach the truth he said the truth will never make you popular but the truth will make you honest and I'd rather be honest and popular because why let me just go brother W can I preach the message of the hour is the absolute period period the might as well preach the message of the hour is the absolute period you said you're getting out there it's the absolute truth so how can something be the truth and not be the absolute I know oh God he say oh the message is the truth but brother B missed it here brother said something no you don't believe it's the truth because if the message is the truth then it's absolute truth and absolute means it's Unlimited in its power come on church it's not checked it checks you don't check this message this message checks you come on young people you don't check your come on oh come on we might as well preach amen amen we check our lives by this message we do not check this message by our lives well I think it's okay to go here and I think it's okay to wear this and I think it's okay to listen that amen but I believe the message is the truth no you don't because you're reducing the power of the message to change every aspect of your life let me say this if this message can't change your dress and it can't change the music and it can't change the places you go and the things you look at how in God's name is it going to change your body but I believe this is a changing message I believe it changes habits I believe it changes nature I believe it changes attitudes I believe it changes dress I believe it changes clothes I believe it changes music and one of these days it's going to change my body in the moment in the twinking of an eye if it liberated me here if it liberated my soul what's it going to do to my body some morning God oh Merc I'm just going to preach young people they say well brother brother B preached some truth no he preached all truth brother B said God would let me tell you part truth and not the rest of it truth he wouldn't stand for that God is all truth brother said now watch his truth and his love and attitude is that it's the same towards you as it is to another believer before you so when you come on the scene God didn't change his attitude concerning you but he's got the same attitude toward you as he did to those before you watch this if God can heal one person with cancer he can heal every one of you with cancer he has healed every one of you that's got cancer the only thing you have to do is just accept it and I'm just just servant here in Vindication that he through Grace might come down on me and speak through this channel to vindicate his presence with you are y'all ready for this he isn't dead he isn't in a grave and need neither is he on the cross come on he's not in a Manger he's not as a boy in the carpenter shop he's not in Gethsemane tonight he's not on his way to gotha he's not on Mount Calvary he's not in the Tomb in Jerusalem can I go ahead and say it he's not even in the pits of Hell tonight taking the keys of death hell and the grave away from the devil but my God tonight has ascended but he's descended Amen to the right hand of the father and he sits there in power and authority tonight over every devil over every Spirit listen my God is not a weak God he's a mighty God he's a powerful God he's a moving God he's a god of his word and watch the spirit comes to the word I love what the prophet of God said he said look at John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth he'll not speak of himself but whatsoever he says he shall hear and he shall speak now watch he will show you things to come can we say this together the spirit of Truth is come the spirit of truth of Truth is come it's not coming or has been here he's here the spirit of Truth is come now look at this word come it is from one place to another and it is used of both persons arriving it means to appear I love this it means to come forth it means to show itself to find a place of influence so when he the spirit of Truth has come now watch this the spirit always comes to the word so when he the spirit of Truth is come where will he come he will not come to my feelings he will not come to my traditions he will come to the word and then the word will find an influence among the Believers of that word can I say this we're not under man's influence we're not under a Church's influence we're not under a little group of people's influence we have Arisen to the top of Mount sign and we are under the influence of the spirit of Truth are you with me we're under the influence of the spirit of truth then whatever we say is coming from the vision whatever we preach is coming from the message because the message of the hour amen is the only thing that will break the strength of the devil let me say what the pr of God said now let me let me just back up here and say this Satan don't want the spirit of Truth preached and he don't want you to hear it but another thing he don't want you to do is he don't want you to pull on it because there is a reason why and the pr of God said thou oh God has come into the midst of the people and their faith has drawn out Supernatural words explaining to them their life of what they have done what they must do and what will be so we are under the influence of the spirit of truth that knows what has been he knows what is and he also knows what will be so we're not serving a God that can only see one section of time in other words we're not serving a god that is looking at you the way he's looking at your past he's oh God he's not looking at you as if he's looking at your past if you're past is underneath the blood he does not see your past when he looks at you the only thing he sees is the blood so God can see your past but he can also see your present so he's looking at you but he's not looking at you just in your present can I tell you why because he's the spirit of Truth and he's come out of your future come on Church he's come out of your future and has walked into your present as the defeater of your past as the danger of your present to introduce you to your future church and living God if you can ever see what this message is it is an unlimited it is a finite message if we'll just take the limits off of God you'll hear these words you never even done it in the first place if you'll take the limits off of God you'll hear these words that day on Calvary every sin was kettled every sickness was healed if you'll just hear the spirit of Truth you know what he'll say he'll say I seen you over there oh come on church and you know who's doing that not me that's you the part of God said the people pulling you people's the one I have not one thing to do with it it's just the gift of God that I yield myself to and you draw from it yourself you out there in the meetings you can sit and begin to pray to God and watch him turn right around and say something to you and tell you what you was praying about and what you ask for other day a young sister told me she said brother Andrew you just preaching a meeting in the church the other day and said you were talking about the you were talking about the Lord and and how there's a future and she said in my heart I said Lord I got some questions about the future home she said brother Ander no more than when you said that she said you turned and looked at me and said now the Lord can answer those questions about the future home I didn't know her questions but listen there's an unseen Force are you hearing me come on are oh you said that's spooky that's not spooky that's Supernatural and the supernatural transcends the natural listen we got to get out of this natural Services come on we come on might as well preach amen we got so settled down and so spooky that anything that comes along now we're PL scared to death and before long if we're not careful every Supernatural manifestation is going to scare us until we ain't nothing but a bunch of dead Church of Christ amen sitting around talking about God moving in brother bram's days but I come here to tell you tonight amen there is a yum and it's the word of God it's the message of the hour and we ought to check every visitation we ought to check every dream we ought to check every Vision we ought to check every sermon we ought to check everything by the message of the hour and if it passes the message we ought to hold it up before the people and say the shout of the king is in the camp but if it's against the word amen repent of the thing Let It Go and move on for the glory of God I don't think we ought to make our churches natural because of scarecrows scarecrows will always be here but his brother Donnie Reagan says scarecrows they don't scare crow they scarecrows but they don't scare Eagles and last time I checked I'm not a crow I am an eagle I got Eagle DNA I got eagle feathers I got eagle eyes I got an eagle message I'm under an eagle anointing I refuse to be bound down to some chicken mentality we're Eagles we're Eagles Carter spread your wings as an eagle and remember who you are oh Satan don't want this message preached because when that word comes in the church he says now what something's fixing to happen cuz there's the word there's the promise and the power the word the promise and the power to sling it that's what we need today is a man that'll take God's word with the power of the Holy Ghost behind him to press it out there and watch it come to pass I don't think he's talking about something way off in the future I think he's talking about this day press the word out there and watch it come to pass can I say this that's God's Army we're soldiers here tonight in the army of the Living God now I want I want to break into something here in Revelation one you will read there about the Sevenfold personage of Christ go read it when you get time in Hebrews 4:12 the Bible says for the word of God is quick it is powerful and it is sharper than any two-edged sword it is piercing even to the dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart in Revelation 1:16 and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword his countenance was as the son Amen shineth in his strength brother picks this up in the patmas vision and he said it is the word it is performing where unto it was sent for it is the word is full of power the word is full of power somebody say well we ain't going to be a word only church well I agree that there's spirit and word but if the word is full of power then what you're saying is you ain't going to be a power only church come on Church there's power in the word have we let the devil so back us up in a corner that we got to have some feeling or some gift or some sensation Amen to move us to the promises of God I say God forbid if the devil ever put us back in some Pentecostal confusion we are the BL of Jesus Christ Anointed with a pillar of fire we believe in the manifestation of God we believe in the power of God coming in the church by the word William brandom said the the seventh angel will turn our hearts back to the word and I say thank God we are a word church with a word anointing with a word presence because the word of God is the truth wherever you put it it's the word full of power it is the same spirit that was in Jesus the word is present again in the church in this last stage as a last sign trying to head the people off from judgment for they reject him the word are now already come into judgment crucifying him aresh now watch Paul said that the word came in power as well as voice so there's a power in the church but there's got to be a voice that will channel that power come on Church the power has returned to the church but there's got to be a voice to clearly identify the power are y'all with me in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel when he shall begin to sound he will not just be a Moses brother Levi he'll be a Joshua and he will positionally place us amen not in Hybrid Power or denominational power but Timothy he'll put us right in the middle of the original Power with the same signs with the same wonders with the same manifestation with the same kind of spirit on the same kind of people acting the same kind of way listen y'all just forgive me if I shout a minute I've been restor restored I've been restored back to the original seed with the original life with the original anointing and it's got power and it's got voice now watch a prophet the word preached what is the word the truth what is the message Christ who is Christ the word what is the word the absolute what are we hearing this weekend abs solute truth are you hearing me watch The Prophet actually demonstrated itself now here's how it is it's like a flaming sword cutting sword it went into the consciousness of men and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases and set the captives free what did that the word was like a surgeon's knife now watch and that knife has got to be able to go between the soul and the Spirit come on come on now young people you're a trium being you got flesh you got a spirit and you got a soul the two most deceiving stages can be between the spirit and the Soul Brother BR showed it to us in the message he said you can get the Holy Ghost on your flesh and your spirit and die and go to hell he said because the soul has to receive the Seal of the Holy Ghost that's why I'm telling you young people you better get more than so and so spoke over me or so and so said or so and so saw or brother so and so or my favorite singer or my favorite preacher you better get the Holy Ghost in the depths of your soul it's the only thing that will keep you it's the only thing that will rescue you in the Midnight Hour it's the only thing that'll deler you you better get the Holy Ghost beyond your flesh you better get it beyond your spirit you better get in the depths of your soul where you can say no matter what comes my way none of these things move me I have an absolute I have the truth I'm far on a [Applause] message say what you want to but one of these mornings brother Daniel the Holy Ghost is going to lift us out of this Dimension and we're going to be changed in the moment in the twinkle of an eye I'm talking about the keeping power of the Holy Ghost now somebody say everywhere those early Believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and God confirmed that word with signs following are you ready for this the sick were healed the Devils were cast out and they spoke in new tongues don't you take that out of the word that's in the word and you got to be a real word bride of Christ and to cast out devils and to speak in new tongues and to see the sick healed it takes the power of God but it took a prophet with the voice of the seventh angel to harness the power and say now we're not a bunch of wild beasts out here running around trying to do something we have a clear-cut decision from God we know what we're doing we know why we're praying how we're come on we didn't even know how to pray until this message come our way we didn't know how to believe until this message come our way come on y'all know what I'm talking about without this message every time God said no we'd be back out in the world and God don't love me and God don't care for me but because God sent a prophet I feel like preaching because God sent a prophet we now know when God says no that don't mean he don't love us that don't mean he's against us that means we got great faith to still trust him to still believe him even when he says no come on the power of the Resurrection is in the church but it took a voice it took a voice to bring some Direction that power I don't know why I'm here but I'm here I believe in the power of God but I believe in Direction now I'm running out of time that word was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians are you ready for this there had to come a voice to bring direction to the power to release it to the bride now watch a prophet and in this last stage it is here stronger and greater than everwhere in the true word bride oh little little minority hold on to that word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying we are not looking for the bride's Revival we are not trying to manufacture the bride's Revival right here we are in the middle of the bride's Revival this is your Revival you say what is it it is the word manifested In the Flesh of the Bride re said I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man in human flesh through the bride's body except his call now watch what a prophet was doing I'm I'm I'm turning the corner here a prophet was channeling you to accept his call to come back to God's provided way is that okay he was showing you that God has a provided way can I say this and God's provided way is the best way will you always remember that that God's provided way is the best way J you don't have to go find a way you don't have to go look for a way work up a way hunt out a way God has provided a way and it's the best way and a prophet says there's no better way for the baby to get what he wants than to cry for it see now watch as Dr Bosworth used to say the baby that cries the loudest gets the best Camp I mean gets the best service the baby that cries the loudest gets the best service that goes for God's children he said oh man get up and say you and G well you know father I'm here tonight if you want to give me the old ghost all right I'm here if you want to heal me I'm sitting here but if you don't well that's all right it's your will Lord he's done rot outed here in the Bible this is your will now watch this this is his will right here and if you want me to have it I'll have it but nevertheless if you don't well that's all right you'll never get nowhere but let that one get there and cry out like buddy Robinson he stopped in the middle of the corn field and he tied up his mule and he said Lord if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when you come back here you will find a pile of bones laying right here I'm going to stay here till I get it that's business watch God always recommends to his children his believing children to always go in his provided way that's God's idea to recommend to his children his provided way are you ready for this cry for what you have need of now I'm I'm I'm going somewhere with this cry for what you have need of he wants you to cry out he wants you to cry out what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying an intellectual pool is not going to do it intellectual approach is not going to bring God in this meeting but a cry from a believing child will pull God right into this building ream said cry for your needs amen cry until the promised word is Vindicated then you've got it and you don't have to worry no more now brother says very beautiful he says if a little baby sees a cookie and he wants it he just cries and cries and cries and kicks and screams and hollers and turns red in the face why cuzz his mama got got him a cookie and it's all over see he got what he saw he wanted Oh Glory to God before the baby got it he saw it before the baby possessed it he saw that there was a potential of him to have it so he be to use his god-given way to cry out until he got a hold the mama to bring into his possession what he saw by faith well somebody give me some shout room the house of God do you realize that baby has no physical way to get up and go exert force on Mama but the baby's cry come on Church the baby's cry has so much power that when that cry goes out it hooks to a heart strings of that Mama and begins to pull on that Mama until that Mama goes into action and the only thing that will liberate that Mama from hearing that baby's cry is to manifest The Cry of the Soul Church Living God you want the Holy Ghost cry out for it you want Deliverance cry out for it you want a miracle cry out for it you want a healing cry out for it you want a breakthrough cry out for it you want a Deliverance cry out for it you want healing cry out for it come on church I think it's time to throw away the pacifiers and throw away all the man-made ideas and come back to the message of the hour raise a flesh with the devil and pull on God oh somebody shout pull on God what are we going to do we're going to pull until we receive the Fulfillment of what we're Desiring now amen the devil Devil's messing we going to preach cry he says until the word is Vindicated now watch the trouble of it is we get a cookie and think that's all there is no there's a whole table full we get so we can speak in tongues we say oh brother that's it oh no that ain't that's just some of it that's right oh I got happy enough to shout there's some more of it but there's a whole lot more of it just keep on crying out until see that's God's provided way for his people is to take his word somebody say take his word and hold on to it until it's Vindicated to you in other words can you say this with me when you begin to to cry God begins to answer when you begin to cry hello when you begin to cry God begins to answer when you begin to cry God begins to hear watch the Bible in judges three Israel cried to the Lord and the Lord raised up a deliver in judges 6 Israel cried to the Lord and the Lord raised up a prophet to lead them out can I can I can I take can I take five minutes here that the Lord sent a prophet under the children of Israel because the midianites my new ministry the god of Heaven who had all the prophets paragraph 84 to speak of the coming of the Lord Jesus and Jesus when he come he fulfilled every prophecy many of them was fulfilled at the cross where he deposited into your account when you was wounded for our transgression when David said my God is th forsaken me are y'all ready for this are you ready for this remember this okay when God sends a prophet a prophet speaks and God makes that truth brother silus when God sends a prophet the prophet speaks and God makes that truth if it's God that's where he had to say to know them if they spoke what they said come to pass they believe but if not I'm not with him now look if God who spoke in the holy prophets talked about the coming of Messiah to the glory and honor of God he said now watch if I know who would be president next fall and would tell it that would be prophecy that's right but God doesn't prophesy like that that's just to be playing but God does something to glorify him so when God speaks that Prophet picks up the thoughts of God and he speaks those thoughts now listen I'm I'm getting ready to close and when he speaks if it's coming from God then whatever he says God makes that the truth can I say this from 47 to 65 is the truth the church age book is the truth the seal book is the truth Church order is the truth come on Daniel 70 weeks is the truth the adoption series is the truth come on Church come on I'm preaching to you now are you hearing me it's all the truth when a prophet speaks if he come from God what he says God makes it the truth now watch you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so the prophet is not here today but there is a five-fold Ministry who is saying what he said and what he said was the truth and when they say what he's saiding the same liberating power comes into the building and begins to liberate the church are you all hearing me tonight are you hearing me I say it's time to speak what a prophet has already said and watch Liberation power break out in the church watch oh God I'm out of time Psalms 34:6 this poor man cried are y'all ready for this what's your idea of crying why that's a poor cry it's Malachi back there cry buddy are are you hearing me your idea of crying is just right but look here this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles look at this word cry it means to recite so when you recite something that means you've already heard it when you recite it in other words you're saying what he said on the tapes you begin to cry out you begin to reide you begin to read to cry to Proclaim to speak with a loud voice remember said watch says recite or repeat what's been told or heard remind God of his Covenant Moses when he had vision from God the Lord appeared to him he quoted back his Word of Promise Moses was right on his road down in the absolute he said tith to the word of God and plead that promise in the third seal now if the churches oh my if the churches watch a prophet if the churches today amen would forget their Creeds forget their dogmas and just take the Bible and plead the proph promise that it would come affected to them listen young people don't you ever let somebody tell you we need to get away from a prophet's message and just get back to our Bible because what they're saying to you is get away from absolute truth and come over to our opinions and our ideas so we can dictate your life and dictate your faith but I'm going to say what a prophet said he said get away from the Creeds get away from the dogmas get away from the Traditions you want to talk about going back to your Bible let's talk about going back to your Bible a prophet led us back to the Holy Bible and we can stand on every scripture and say it's thus sayith the Lord we can stand on every promise and say it's thus say come on Church we're not going down we're riseing up we are a generation who has been born from the genes of the word of God and whatever situation we get in we don't bely ache we cry we recite what a prophet said we speak what a prophet said say it say it say it well brother Ander I'm too weak say it well brother and I'm defeated say what the prophet said okay let me show you something you said brother and I'm too weak and here comes the devil you're too weak you're too puny you're too insignificant you'll never make it you'll never come and you start saying that you know what happens before long you'll be lower than a snake's belly but change your cry and start saying there's an invincible Army did you see the change in the atmosphere because it's the truth it's the absolute truth and when that is spoken over your life it'll free you from every complex it'll free you from every fear I come here tonight to say this in closing say what a prophet said over the church and watch the chain fall say what a prophet said and watch Demons back up say what a Prophet said and watch Miracles and healing and power and deliverance and manifestation say what he said until every devil is defeated and the power of God breaks out [Applause] again I say say what a prophet said recite it rehearse it play it speak it read [Applause] it you know why brother Jonah because it's the truth brother Dylan it's the truth and you know what it'll do it'll still be the truth on your bad days it'll still be the truth thas on the days you don't feel like you're saved you don't feel like God did anything for you but the message will still be the truth and it'll still be the truth it'll always be the truth come on change your vocabulary young people and say what a prophet said oh somebody shout hallelujah hallah cry out speak the word in other words Israel it's still raining Israel was in the mud pits of Egypt beaten oppressed slaves confused bleeding hurting in a terrible condition right but there was a vision given and the vision said God will raise up a deliverer God will raise up a deliverer so when Israel begin to cry out to God they were not going why why their cry was not confusion their cry was God you said you would raise up a deliverer come on Church The Cry was coming from their bondage but the cry was not confusion the cry was the rehearsing of the word of God that Moses spoke over there young people I know the world is falling apart I know Leota is on its way down but I didn't come here to why over you I come here to cry over you and to say what a prophet said he said before one bomb ever HS this nation you'll be at the Merit supper of the Lamb he said there will be a people on the Earth who will live so close to God to the devil don't know what to do with them he said there would be a Victorious word born church and you are she and when that word begins to be spoken over your life I've got to skip over this when that word begins to be spoken over your life you receive that word that word becomes your cry it becomes your confession it becomes your voice it becomes your language it becomes what you say in the morning it's what you say in the evening it's what you say when you feel it it's what you say when you don't it's what you listen to when you're depressed it's what you listen to when you're happy what happens is the message of the hour becomes your cry now Bon Barda Sat by the highways side one day begging and the Bible said he began to cry out you know what he done brother said he said the Lord did not hear his voice the Lord didn't hear his voice he said what the Lord heard was his faith but BR said now look where that was coming from oh God he said in barnes's heart was this revelation If He Did It for the woman with the issue of blood then he can do it for me you remember my opening quote May the power of Liberation come into the building and may this be the single mind if he did it for others he can do it for me barus begin to cry out the confession of the revelation of the woman issue of blood and he began to say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me B said in other words he had a revelation that if God was in Jehovah he was in Jesus he was in Jesus and all the stories his mama told him as a child about deliverance from Egypt and bread on the ground and shoes on the feet that didn't come from Grandma's Almanac that came from the word of God and barus be to cry off that word can I say this to you and all the sudden say the reality sets in on him he's passing by the first night of this meeting let me say this to you let the reality set in on you it's already set in on you that you're at Camp maybe not but when you get in that bed it will it's already set in on you that you're here okay can I close by saying this but now let it set in on you that he's here it's already set in on you that you're here R aah you're here you're here you're physically here but now let the Revelation set in on you that he's here and if he's here then all things are possible he is passing by Brother BR said like this brother Jordan he said there was a committee he said that had set up and their whole purpose was this quieten down all that nonsense crying quiting down all that crying but when Bemus could not physically see Jesus but he began to hear a noise oh God let me just pre-warn you there's going to be a lot of noise around here this weekend when he begin to hear a noise something begin to pulsate who is that who is that I cannot physically see him but would somebody tell me who that is and somebody just quietly might be maybe walked by and said it's that Jesus of Nazareth who it's Jesus of Nazareth it's it's that fanatic it's that Holy Roller it's that it's that crazy message you know they all talk about you mean he's here yeah he's he's right down there well barus how are you sure that that's him and you can't see him because I heard wherever he is there's a lot of noise I heard wherever he is there's a lot of noise and I also heard that I don't have to physically touch him I don't have to physically touch him I just got to release my faith I just got to release my faith in his presence and my faith will touch him and it's Jesus kept on walking by they said sh sh cting down quit saying brother I'm saiding quit reading all them quotes quit talking about that message quit quoting all them quotes just cting down but they kept on preaching and they kept on screaming and they kept on crying and they kept on saying what a prophet said they kept on confessing what the word of God said until oh Hallelujah until all of a sudden Jesus stopped he stopped and he said he said bring him here he said barus my son you have been healed go your way how did he get it he began to cry out won't you stand your feet with us tonight now brother said if that blind Beggar's Faith stopped him on the road to Calvary somebody say this with me on the road on the to Calvary that means he's not got there yet I know it's simple that means brother Peter he's on his way that means that the atonement is still by blood of bulls and goats that means he's on his road to Calvary and barus sits there by the highways side begging insignificant poor don't have nothing and begins to cry out and the pro of God said if that blind Beggar's Faith stopped him on the road to calary then how much more will your faith stop him tonight are you ready for this when he's trying to get to your heart when he healed barus he y'all just forgive me the Bible said for the the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the shame and it sat down at the right hand of God on high right the whole time he was walking to Calvary you and I was on his mind the whole time he's walking to Calvary he's thinking about you he's thinking about this meeting he's thinking about delivering somebody he's thinking about saving somebody he's thinking about somebody sitting in a meeting and hearing that while he's hanging on that cross the blood is going to run from his back and the blood is going to run from his side and it's going to meet in the middle and it's going to run down on his feet and the people who hear that their sins are going to be judged their sickness is going to be dealt with are y'all ready for this and he still had time for barus thank you Lord he said what happened God provided a land for that Blind Man's eyes God provided a lamb for barus his eyes you ready for this that same Lamb's provided for you tonight it's provided for anything you have need of and he's passing this way can I show you something barus pulled on him on his way to Calvary and got a healing you're pulling on him as after he's been to Calvary been in the borrowed grave been in the regions of the Lost ascended back up empty paradise and reign as the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ if he could do that for bmus on his way to Calvary what can he do for you this [Music] weekend what could he do for you this weekend if you would let everything out of your mind accept this he's [Music] here he's passing by he's here I want you to Bow your hearts with us tonight it's provided for anything that you have need of Hallelujah how many tonight can say Lord all my desires is before you all my desires are laying before you tonight on this first night of the meeting Lord I'm open in my heart I'm open in my life I'm opening up all the doors I need you Lord Hallelujah as you begin to cry out as you begin to plead the promises as you begin to confess the word as you begin to recite the things that you've heard it literally moves God into action can you recognize him tonight can you you recognize him as the word of [Music] Liberation Hallelujah God bless you there God bless you hands up all over the building God bless you sis he is The Liberation the word is in our midst he's here tonight the message is the absolute truth now the reason you're here tonight is not because just somebody registered you somebody put your name on the bus list or the van list somebody made you come no the reason you're here tonight is because there's something in you calling out to live there's something in you calling out to do right there's something in you calling out to walk in faith Faith to walk in Revelation now God calls somebody to the pull pit to preach the absolute truth and what they're preaching is a sword and it's sharp it's two-edged it's quick but it's a surgeon's knife and it knows how to perform surgery it knows how to cut between the spirit and the Soul between the joints and the marrow and the bone it knows how to go in there and cut things out it knows how to circumcise the heart of a Believer and if you're a real child of God you say these words Lord take it away from me how many can say tonight on this first night Lord whatever the word this weekend discerns in my life whatever that surgeon's knife Cuts in my life cuts out God take it from me take it from me Lord take it from me Lord Heavenly Father Lord

night may they see the word of Liberation may they see that liberating word has the power Lord maybe some of them there's limits on their thoughts Lord they think this as far as they can go they think they've got all that they can get they think that God don't love them they think that the world's against them they think that their family is against them they think this is against them they think that Lord but Lord this word is a liberating knife tonight and when it begins to cut Lord it'll cut all the limits off of their thoughts and they'll begin to think that which is pure and that which was holy and that which was of good things Lord there may be thoughts on their behavior Lord there may be rather limits on their behavior but Lord when that word begins to discern oh God they want to act like the bride they want to manifest the power of God oh they want to enjoy their salvation they want to praise you without any restrictions they want to love you without any any restrictions oh God they want to worship and freedom they want to praise and freedom but the devil's doing everything he can to suppress and suppress and suppress but Lord May that word of Liberation may it liberate them tonight God in their worship this weekend Oh God maybe there's a spirit pressing on their confession limiting their confession maybe there's certain things they've been taught that they really can't confess because maybe brother Bram was his opinion or they really can't believe that because that was his idea Lord I rebuke those oppressive spirits and father I invite you as the surgeon take the knife in your hand this weekend take the two-edged sword and Lord we've we've called out to you we've cried out to you we've invited you to come here this weekend we've invited you to deal with hearts we've invited you to deal with lives we've invited you to deal with our hearts and our lives now Lord when the the word begins to go forth may we not take offense to it may we not get mad at

love him here tonight oh my just keep on praying those who want to pray you just go right on presence of the Lord is here tonight hallelujah oh I'm so thankful for it I think a message like tonight is so crucial because I I was raised in Pentecost and we felt we had the truth and we had a lot of wonderful gifts and a lot of gifted men and a lot of wonderful prophecies and man and the problem was instead of depending on the vitamins of the food and man and doing what it take took to to understand who we were and to believe the word and we were like some of you guys that amen drinking the energy drinks these days that's and those energy drinks will kill you if you're living on that stuff it'll kill you it puts a buzz in you but it don't last long it gives you a little bit of an emotion but it won't keep you gifts are never meant to satisfy you thankful for the gifts but this message is what stabilized this boy Hallelujah I remember as a a as a as a kid amen just praying that my pastor would have a word of the Lord for me I'd just pray and I'd I'd sat there outside his office all by myself when no one was there in the church and I'd say God if you just speak to my pastor to encourage me and and you know what the Lord would give something to my pastor for me and oh it was so good but a couple days later I was needing to know it again I I was needing someone else to say something you see I become addicted to a small fix but see God's given us Malachi 4 a word prophet and if we can take what that word Prophet brought us it'll stabilize you and buddy I had my ups and downs and those that amen that knew me back then I I was high and I was low and I it was it was but brother Hallelujah I remember when I was was 23 24 when the message was given to me presented to me I sat down and cried like a baby I cried as I read this there was something that was telling me who I was as I was listening there was something that was telling me what I was created for and there was no highs that could take me any higher and there was no lows that could separate me there was no man's prophecy that would separate me there was no no opinion here and opinion there to tear me back and forth as I it's my nature amen I I'm sort of timid I want to fit in I want to belong but brother when I found the message of the hour oh that's what I want to belong to amen hallelujah now I'm [Applause] thankful I appreciate prophecies I appreciate dreams and I think I think they're in the church today need a line them up with Malachi 4 he taught us how to use them you know well praise the Lord Brother random says now if you miss it one time he says you need to stop go and pray for that lion devil to get off of you so I believe the Holy Ghost still works today I'm come on someone says well no one can be accurate No one brother Brandon was the only one accurate well then don't prophesy amen because I believe in a accurate holy ghost that can give an accurate prophecy that can give an accurate Hallelujah but when it all said and done give me this word that is hallelujah when I'm feeling really high and I want to dance and Shout well I'm just going to dance and Shout because the Bible says I could do it but there's some times I wake up and I don't feel like I've got the Holy Ghost there's times I wake up and I don't know if I am a believer I I mean the devil's beating me all around but you know what I do I go right back to what that message said that there is a predestinated seed on the inside of me whether I feel it whether I understand it there's something within me that is screaming out amen can you say Amen [Music] Hallelujah you know what I found out the devil can't whoop me all over the stump anymore I'm here the devil don't play fair buddy that old devil man he'll come in and tear you up you're not going to be in the bride you'll never make the Rapture you're mistake how many of you young people have been told that this week just this week I only want I

brother Craig Boer said one time someone was trying to say well if you had a choice what would you accept the Bible or the message of the hour brother Craig says well matters of fact he answered that question right here at this at this camp and he said well it depends on if you want a closed book or an open book if you want the book that everyone has guessed at for thousands of years exclude the prophet but if you want to know what the book means you need to listen to the voice of the Prophet well it's pretty [Laughter] simple hallelujah amen well Glory I've been under all those other other
