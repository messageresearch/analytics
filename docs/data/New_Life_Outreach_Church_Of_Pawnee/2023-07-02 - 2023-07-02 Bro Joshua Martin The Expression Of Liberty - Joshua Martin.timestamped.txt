[33:05] Lord we ask these things in your
[33:07] precious name amen
[33:10] you you may be seated if I had a simple
[33:13] subject tonight it would be the
[33:15] expression of Liberty
[33:17] you see the meaning of Liberty is the
[33:20] quality or state of being free freedom
[33:23] from physical restraint celebrity ain't
[33:26] something in our imagination or
[33:28] something that we work up or or a
[33:31] sensation or a feeling but Liberty is
[33:34] something that is a reality you see
[33:37] Liberty ain't something that uh in our
[33:39] imagination but it's an expression if
[33:41] you've ever been set free every time
[33:44] that you walk down the road you're
[33:45] expressing your freedom you're
[33:48] expressing your Liberty The Way You Walk
[33:50] is expressing something the way you talk
[33:52] the way you act is expressing something
[33:55] it's something that is real something
[33:57] genuine you see the stars are expressing
[34:00] a light that is greater than them
[34:02] they're not expressing it in their own
[34:04] ability in their their their their own
[34:06] power but there was an unseen force that
[34:09] they are expressing you see the radio is
[34:12] expressing an Unseen World electricity
[34:15] is expressing an unseen force you you
[34:18] might not be able to see it but they're
[34:20] expressing an Unseen World bringing into
[34:23] reality where you can see it with your
[34:26] natural eyes you see brother Branham
[34:28] says we wouldn't know God was God if
[34:31] there wasn't a son he says when he said
[34:33] let there be light we will know he was
[34:35] God unless there was a light and he says
[34:37] it may have taken a lot of years but
[34:39] once that come to pass that was a
[34:42] Vindication that he was who he said he
[34:44] was because his word started to express
[34:47] itself you see whenever you take a yeah
[34:50] whenever the the word took on form it
[34:52] started to declare to the world that
[34:55] there was a God speaking with power
[34:57] speaking with the Lord with authority
[35:00] speaking with Dominion you see brother
[35:01] Branham says this now Peter speaking
[35:04] here we can find out that in the
[35:06] beginning when God said let there be
[35:07] light and there was light that's the
[35:09] interpretation to it when God says
[35:12] anything and it was manifested then
[35:14] that's God's interpretation that his
[35:17] word is right see when he said let there
[35:20] be light the and that was in his
[35:22] thinking before that uh before there was
[35:25] such a thing as light but when he said
[35:26] let there be a light the light sprung
[35:28] into the skies that's the interpretation
[35:31] nobody has to interpret that for God
[35:34] said so and there it was when God speaks
[35:37] and it manifests itself that's the
[35:40] interpretation of his word why can't men
[35:43] see that he says why don't people say
[35:45] that so whenever his word took on form
[35:48] and started to express itself that was a
[35:51] manifestation of what God was saying and
[35:54] I thought my you know brother Bradham
[35:56] says that anybody can argue scripture
[35:58] anybody can say scripture is false but
[36:01] until that word goes from letter form to
[36:04] manifestation he says they can no longer
[36:07] argue that it's real or not because
[36:09] there's an expression there's a life
[36:12] that has been changed there's somebody
[36:14] that was abound by alcohol Bound by
[36:16] addictions Bound by drugs and now their
[36:19] expressions is changed by another Power
[36:22] you know you think of the the man that
[36:24] was born blind he couldn't see all of
[36:26] his life the third come a time where he
[36:28] started to express another Authority he
[36:31] started to express a supreme power that
[36:34] went beyond a man's ability that went
[36:37] beyond a man's word to uh to a supreme
[36:40] word you know I love the story the Bible
[36:43] says that the scribes went up to his
[36:45] parents and says is that your boy that
[36:48] was sitting by the that was sitting by
[36:49] the gate that was blind and now he is
[36:51] healed how did this happen and they said
[36:54] he is of age go ask him in other words
[36:57] he is old enough to express what he
[37:00] feels and I thought that's the way it is
[37:02] with the bride of Christ the brightest
[37:04] come of age and she's expressing not her
[37:08] own ability she's not expressing her own
[37:10] power but she's come of age she's
[37:13] maturing inside of this world and she's
[37:16] expressing another power she's a player
[37:19] expressing another Authority from
[37:21] another world and they come up to this
[37:23] boy and says you know how did you get
[37:26] this how did you get your sight how do
[37:28] you see and the Bible says he looked at
[37:31] him and says Jesus healed me and they
[37:33] said don't you know that he's a liar
[37:35] he's a fortune teller he's this and he
[37:37] looks at him and says whether he be a
[37:39] sinner or not I don't know all I know is
[37:43] I was blind but now I see that
[37:46] expression ended all arguments that
[37:49] expression ended every debate that they
[37:52] had because there was a life that was
[37:55] changed by the power of the gospel and I
[37:58] say this when there's somebody that is
[38:00] living in overcoming life and expressing
[38:03] the true power of the Holy Ghost that is
[38:06] lighting up the world saying there's a
[38:09] God in the middle of Pawnee Oklahoma not
[38:12] because of a word but because of an
[38:14] expression the word has come inside out
[38:17] of a body and is expressing that other
[38:20] the same yesterday today and forever
[38:23] once said Jesus apart was the word
[38:26] inside of him expressing itself and
[38:29] that's what the brightest to be is an
[38:31] expression When God says anything it's
[38:34] got to express itself because whenever
[38:37] he said let there be light obviously it
[38:39] wasn't the devil coming and creating
[38:41] light because he's going to do the exact
[38:44] opposite so what was it it was the word
[38:47] coming with power taking on a form and
[38:51] expressing the power you see look at
[38:53] Psalms 97 and 6 the heavens declare his
[38:57] righteousness and all the people see his
[39:00] glory so how is the righteousness being
[39:03] declared to the Earth because there's
[39:05] the heaven that was created by the word
[39:08] of God how did the heavens get there in
[39:10] the beginning God created the heavens
[39:12] and the Earth so his word went forth and
[39:16] took on form and materialized and that
[39:19] material and that form is now declared
[39:22] to the Earth that there is righteousness
[39:24] oh my so if the Earth if the heavens is
[39:29] doing that and the Earth is doing that
[39:31] and the nature is doing that what about
[39:34] the bride of Christ that has been
[39:36] redeemed by the blood of Christ that's
[39:38] been redeemed and broke from addictions
[39:40] you see the skies have never been set
[39:43] free the trees has never been set free
[39:46] the Earth has never been set free but
[39:48] there's a body there's a group that has
[39:51] been set free you are glorifying the
[39:54] power of almighty God because you're
[39:56] expressing that there's another
[39:58] Authority on Earth this ain't something
[40:00] from a man but this is an authority that
[40:04] is breaking Every Chain breaking every
[40:06] addiction breaking every stronghold and
[40:09] I say this evening wherever you're at if
[40:11] you need healing in your body if you
[40:13] need a feeling of the Holy Ghost the
[40:16] same God that filled the Pastor fill the
[40:18] deacons fill the preacher is the same
[40:21] God that is wanting to express his power
[40:24] through a young person through a mama
[40:26] through a daddy Hallelujah he needs
[40:29] somebody to express his life through
[40:33] Hallelujah he needs somebody
[40:37] to himself through you look at first
[40:39] chronicles 16 and 23 singing to the Lord
[40:42] all the Earth show forth from day to day
[40:45] his salvation he is speaking to the
[40:48] Earth here saying it to the Lord you
[40:51] Earth and so forth from day to day his
[40:54] salvation declare his glory among the
[40:57] Heathen His Marvelous Works among all
[41:00] nations so we're speaking of the Earth
[41:03] but he wasn't satisfied with just the
[41:05] Earth declaring his glory he wanted the
[41:08] body to declare to to declare his glory
[41:12] see without him saying Expressions you
[41:15] will never know anything existed without
[41:17] a thought taking on a form there would
[41:20] never be reality you see Thomas Edison
[41:23] created the light bulb but without a
[41:25] light bulb it was just a good thought
[41:26] Alexander Graham Bell created the
[41:28] telephone but without the telephone it
[41:31] was just a good thought so there needed
[41:33] to be something that took on form that
[41:36] was in his mind so once it comes from
[41:39] his mind that took on form and started
[41:42] to express what was on the inside of his
[41:45] mind you see the definition of
[41:47] expression something that manifests or
[41:50] embodies something something that
[41:52] manifests and so you can't see
[41:54] electricity until there's an expression
[41:57] electricity has been here forever long
[42:00] before Benjamin Franklin discovered it
[42:02] you see Benjamin Franklin then a Creator
[42:05] create electricity he just discovered
[42:08] something that was here all alone but
[42:10] before he could Discover it he had to
[42:13] tap into something and bring it down to
[42:16] reality he needed something needed a
[42:18] desire to tap it and bring it down to
[42:21] where he was and that's the way that's
[42:23] how we got electricity you got panels
[42:25] you got light switches you got power
[42:27] plants it's somebody that is bringing
[42:30] electricity to reality so you can
[42:33] experience it that's the way it is with
[42:35] the things of God if you've got a desire
[42:38] there's no way to channel the thanks of
[42:41] God where it's not just at the church
[42:43] not just the prayer meetings not just
[42:45] the Bible studies not just on Sundays
[42:47] and Wednesdays we thank God for that but
[42:50] there's an expression that can live in
[42:52] our homes that can live on the job site
[42:55] we don't got to be a hypocrite when
[42:57] we're at the job site we're at the
[42:58] workplace there can be an expression the
[43:01] ghost the further than just the church
[43:04] setting farther than just the fellowship
[43:06] hall there can be an expression of God
[43:09] living every day of our life through
[43:11] this Fallen body
[43:13] through this Fallen body what made that
[43:17] man's testimony so great he was in a
[43:20] fallen condition that was changed the
[43:23] man that was born blind he was in a
[43:24] condition where he could not help
[43:26] himself so when somebody that could
[43:29] change his circumstances that was a
[43:31] great testimony come on somebody you
[43:34] know hurt somebody say I heard about as
[43:36] Tim Schultz said you know many people
[43:38] many young people want to go out and get
[43:40] addictions be addicted to drugs and
[43:42] alcohol so they could have a testimony
[43:45] he says that's a great testimony but
[43:47] it's a greater testimony when you're in
[43:50] the midst of perversion in the midst of
[43:52] drugs in the midst of alcohol and you're
[43:55] still not being defiled in the midst of
[43:58] a perverted day you're expressing the
[44:01] power of Jehovah come on somebody
[44:04] there's an expression on Earth letting
[44:07] the world know that there's a God you're
[44:10] lighting up pH by your expressions
[44:14] but there has to be an expression you
[44:17] see it takes an expression for people to
[44:19] see what is here and what they lack your
[44:23] silica Galatians 5 and 25 if we live in
[44:26] the spirit let us also walk in the
[44:28] spirit in other words if you're
[44:31] proclaiming to live a certain way and
[44:33] your walk is different you've got the
[44:35] wrong spirit
[44:37] come on somebody if you claim to be a
[44:39] Christian and you're living a different
[44:41] life that means you're walking in a
[44:44] different Spirit but if we live in the
[44:46] spirit let us also walk in the spirit
[44:49] let us talk in the spirit you know
[44:51] brother Branham says we claim to have
[44:53] Christ with us but he says the places
[44:55] you go will Christ feel welcome he says
[44:59] the things you look at the the books you
[45:01] read will Christ feel welcome they'll
[45:04] read those books with you
[45:05] come on somebody the music you listen to
[45:08] Will Christ feel welcome listening to
[45:10] that music if we're living in the spirit
[45:13] let us walk in the spirit let us talk in
[45:16] the spirit let our actions be walking in
[45:19] the spirit you see with the random types
[45:22] just like the moon he says we're to be
[45:24] like the Sun and the Moon he says
[45:25] whenever the sun goes down or goes away
[45:27] the mood comes up and reflects the same
[45:31] power that the sun has but it's in a
[45:34] lesser form it ain't that it's a
[45:36] different son or a Different Light it's
[45:37] the same Sun but in a lower form brother
[45:40] Branham says this oh I think of that I
[45:43] think of it in Genesis when God made the
[45:45] sun made the moon and now the Moon is
[45:47] the wife of the sun now when the Sun
[45:49] goes that goes away the Moon reflects
[45:52] the light of the sun is that right on
[45:54] the earth now when Jesus was taken away
[45:57] we are his bride which is the Moon to
[46:00] reflect the light of the Gospel we can't
[46:02] reflect it until he Shines on us and
[46:06] when we get the gospel shining on us
[46:08] then we shine it out to so send the
[46:12] light to the world it's my prayer Lord
[46:14] that we can reflect the light of the Son
[46:17] of God in his power and his resurrection
[46:19] in the fullness how marvelous but before
[46:23] the before the moon can reflect the
[46:26] power it's got to have its shining upon
[46:28] it and too many people want to reflect
[46:31] the power of God but it does not have
[46:34] the power of God on the inside you see
[46:37] it's impossible to live an overcoming
[46:39] life without the power of God it's
[46:41] impossible to live an undefiled life
[46:44] without Liberty First coming on the
[46:46] inside but once Liberty comes on the
[46:49] inside then it's impossible not to live
[46:52] an overcoming life what's the Bible say
[46:55] not by might not by power but by my
[46:57] spirit saith the Lord so this goes
[47:00] beyond a mental power this goes beyond
[47:02] psychology this goes beyond an emotional
[47:05] work up to a reality where we're
[47:08] expressing the realities of Jesus Christ
[47:12] oh my look at Genesis 1 and 16. God made
[47:15] two great lights the greater the the
[47:18] greater light to Rule the Day and the
[47:20] Lesser light to rule the night he made
[47:22] the Stars also and so it's something
[47:25] that either the God is putting into
[47:27] place though whenever it's daytime the
[47:30] Sun is up but at night time when it's
[47:32] dark the moon has a responsibility as
[47:35] well the Bible says we're living in the
[47:37] most darkest age that there is but he
[47:40] has a light on earth that is the moon
[47:42] that is reflecting the same power you
[47:45] may feel helpless you may feel hopeless
[47:47] you may feel like a nobody but God has
[47:50] equipped you to reflect the light in the
[47:53] middle of the darkness it's not your own
[47:56] light but it's the power of Jesus Christ
[47:59] expressing its Health through a body
[48:04] um I hope this is okay to save them it's
[48:06] the power of the Resurrection it's still
[48:08] on Earth calling the dead back to life
[48:11] you know I've given the example before I
[48:13] think a couple of times I this just
[48:15] stood out to me whenever I was studying
[48:16] again but whenever Christ went to
[48:18] Lazarus it says Lazarus come forth he
[48:21] brought him to life but he was still
[48:23] bound
[48:25] so in order for Lazarus to get Liberty
[48:28] he didn't of Jesus himself and didn't go
[48:31] up and take away the grave clothes here
[48:34] he commissioned somebody to go up and
[48:37] take the grave clothes off Wade looks to
[48:39] some preachers and he says loose him and
[48:42] let him go so it was the same power
[48:44] Jesus had these men now had to go and
[48:49] loosen Lazarus come on now it wasn't
[48:52] that they possessed the same the
[48:54] greatness of it but they had a portion
[48:57] of it and the same power that Jesus had
[49:00] to say Lazarus come forth they now had
[49:03] to go and lose him loose Lazarus and let
[49:06] him go
[49:07] come on now you know the example of the
[49:09] the the the the the the the cup you can
[49:11] go to the ocean get a cup full of water
[49:13] you don't possess all of the ocean but
[49:16] all that is in the ocean is now in China
[49:19] back up and watch brother Branham say
[49:21] all thy was in God he poured into Christ
[49:23] although it's in Christ he pours into
[49:26] the church it's a lesser form but the
[49:29] moon has a Ministry the Moon is
[49:32] proclaiming to the Earth no matter how
[49:35] dark it is there's still an expression
[49:38] come on somebody no matter how dark it
[49:41] is the sun is still shining and it don't
[49:44] matter where you're at this evening God
[49:47] has a light that is expressing itself in
[49:50] the darkest of the days in the middle of
[49:53] the Valley of the shadow of death God
[49:55] has a light that is expressing itself
[49:57] and you're expressing their life you
[50:00] look at Matthew Proverbs 14 hear the
[50:03] light of the world a city let us set on
[50:05] a hill and cannot be hit neither do men
[50:08] light a candle and put it under a bushel
[50:10] but on a Candlestick and it giveth light
[50:13] unto all that are in the house let your
[50:16] light shine before me
[50:18] that they may see your good works and
[50:21] glorify the Father which is in heaven
[50:24] and so now he has went from the from the
[50:27] sky is glorifying God the Earth is
[50:30] glorifying God now there's a body on
[50:33] Earth that has the same light that the
[50:35] sun has and now was glorifying God
[50:39] come on now how is that happening by
[50:41] expressing the same power that oh my
[50:46] what's the Bible say well the candle is
[50:49] not lit by an accident but it's lit for
[50:51] a purpose that is to light up the area
[50:54] that it is in and then he turns around
[50:57] and he says let your light shine before
[51:00] men don't hide that you're a Christian
[51:02] don't hide the true message believer but
[51:06] Express the light that you now see if
[51:10] it's ever a time not to be ashamed of
[51:13] this message this is the time if there's
[51:15] a time not to be ashamed of Malachi 4
[51:18] this is the time you're the only
[51:21] expression of light that is on the earth
[51:24] let your light shine Show the power of
[51:27] this a message show how God can keep
[51:30] marriages together show how God can keep
[51:33] young people from pornography from drugs
[51:36] from alcohol Express the light you're
[51:39] the expression of Jesus Christ upon the
[51:43] Earth
[51:44] let your light man let your life shine
[51:47] before the man
[51:49] that they may see your good works it's
[51:52] not that your good works is what is
[51:54] saving you but your good works can save
[51:57] somebody else
[51:58] if you ever think about that if your
[52:01] good works can save somebody else what
[52:04] will your bad Works do
[52:06] think about it now if your good works
[52:09] that's the people know that there's a
[52:12] God what does our bad Works do
[52:15] it's a sobering plot but if we can live
[52:18] a life above reproach what is that doing
[52:21] for the gospel you see our life ain't to
[52:24] express theology it's not to express
[52:27] some intellectual conception but our
[52:30] life is to express Jesus Christ you see
[52:33] we're on Earth for more than just have a
[52:35] family to have children have a job uh
[52:38] that all comes with it but we are to be
[52:41] on earth to be an expression brother
[52:42] Branham says the word God's billboard
[52:45] our lives are to make the people thirsty
[52:48] for a living God he says her life ain't
[52:50] to express theology but it's to point to
[52:53] a living reality of Jesus Christ he says
[52:57] your God's eye you're you're God's
[52:59] advertising agent he says he was driving
[53:02] down the road one day and he sees the
[53:04] billboard he says on that billboard it
[53:06] had one word it said hungry
[53:09] and he says right below that it had to
[53:11] have words that says three miles ahead
[53:14] he says that wasn't to attract the ones
[53:17] that was looking for a car he says that
[53:19] wasn't to attract the ones that was
[53:21] looking for a hotel that was to attract
[53:24] the ones that was hungry and he says
[53:26] yeah you might not even been hungry but
[53:29] once you've seen that it put the thought
[53:31] in your mind come on somebody you know
[53:33] what I'm talking about you're to attract
[53:35] the ones that is hungry for the things
[53:38] of God you're to attract the ones that
[53:41] is thirsty and looking for a savior
[53:43] looking for a redeemer you know every
[53:45] time a man takes drugs he's looking for
[53:48] a satisfaction every time a prostitute
[53:51] goes with the man she's looking for
[53:54] something and you've got Hallelujah
[53:56] you've got what the world is looking for
[53:59] the Thirsty they're hungry be God's
[54:03] billboard you're the expression to let
[54:06] them know that God can deliver from
[54:08] drugs you're the express to let them
[54:10] know God can deliver from alcohol you're
[54:13] the expression to let them know God can
[54:16] deliver from pornography you're the
[54:19] expression of God on Earth
[54:22] Hallelujah you're God's billboard
[54:26] let that sink in your God's billboard
[54:30] there's many Billboards out there
[54:31] brother Branham says that he says
[54:34] surprisingly that was a good billboard
[54:36] he says most of the time there are
[54:38] Billboards of naked women uh cigarettes
[54:42] of drinking he says but this was a
[54:44] billboard that had a good purpose to it
[54:46] and there's many Billboards out there
[54:48] there's many Billboards that are
[54:50] pointing to Hell saying that I try drugs
[54:53] try alcohol try pornography but in the
[54:55] midst of the perversion there's a
[54:58] billboard that is letting the world know
[55:00] that there's a God on Earth brother
[55:03] Branham says this give us Faith Lord as
[55:06] a little rude expression a while ago
[55:08] that that I made about the power of God
[55:10] being in us and all the fibers to be the
[55:14] light of God in the darkness and sin had
[55:16] choked up in the little pores in a in in
[55:19] US of our soul let the Holy Ghost this
[55:22] morning spread forth in our being
[55:24] pressing Faith out into our outermost
[55:27] being that our whole bodies lives of so
[55:30] saturated with the power of God so
[55:33] people will see that Jesus Christ lives
[55:36] in his church
[55:38] her whole bodies the lives be saturated
[55:40] with the power of God so that the world
[55:43] will see that Christ lives in his church
[55:46] you see we don't need to force
[55:47] Christianity down people's throats we
[55:50] just need to be billboards
[55:53] we need somebody that's not ashamed of
[55:55] it you know remember the story brother
[55:57] Branham tells suburbs and the end upon
[55:59] he says there was a man he was good
[56:02] friends with he said he was one of the
[56:03] best hunters he says he would never get
[56:05] lost in the woods because he knew his
[56:07] directions but he was a cruel-hearted
[56:09] man he would just shoot funds for the
[56:12] fun of it he would shoot fonts to make
[56:14] brother Branham uh to get under her skin
[56:17] he says brother Branham says it's okay
[56:19] if you want to shoot a farm that's fine
[56:21] but don't shoot a bunch of him you know
[56:24] but either he goes on to tell the story
[56:25] that he was hunting one day and he and
[56:28] they were looking they couldn't find no
[56:30] deer and he looked behind him and burnt
[56:32] how this little call there was a phone
[56:35] call and he would blow that little
[56:37] whistle and it will make the sound of a
[56:39] fawn and he says he blew that whistle
[56:42] and there was that Doe that stepped out
[56:44] of the woods he says there was nothing
[56:46] there because they were hiding because
[56:48] they knew he was there but once he made
[56:51] that sound of the of the baby it stepped
[56:54] out into the open for all the world to
[56:56] see and brother Branham says Bert lifted
[56:59] up his gun he was like he pulled back
[57:01] the lever and was about to shoot and
[57:04] brother Branham says oh my how are you
[57:06] why are you so cruel he's thinking in
[57:07] his heart why is he so cruel why is he
[57:11] going to do that now he would say that
[57:12] brother Branham says that Bertman looked
[57:14] at him and say you're just a
[57:15] chicken-hearted preacher that's all you
[57:17] guys are as chicken-hearted preachers
[57:19] and brother Brandon says I can't look he
[57:21] turns around and he was waiting for the
[57:23] shot waiting for the shot waiting for
[57:26] the shot he looked back and the gun
[57:28] barrel was shaken he started to cry he
[57:30] threw down his gun and he says Billy
[57:32] tell me about this Jesus brother Branham
[57:35] says he didn't have to explain it to him
[57:37] there was an expression in that Mama
[57:40] the mama was willing to forsake all for
[57:44] her baby and that right there started to
[57:46] express to that man that was a
[57:49] cruel-hearted man the God loves him
[57:52] if animal now the nature can do that if
[57:55] a dog can do that what about the pride
[57:58] of Christ that has been set free from
[58:01] addictions
[58:04] um I hope this is okay tonight brother
[58:05] Branham says this each one of you from
[58:07] tonight on remember you are God's
[58:09] Billboards you're God's advertising
[58:11] agent now the world will look at you to
[58:14] see what Christ is so we don't want to
[58:16] smear a big lot of stuff on there that
[58:19] that testify of things that we really
[58:22] are not let's be that and then when we
[58:25] are that the world was seen the Christ
[58:27] is in you and me you know brother
[58:30] Branham says that there wasn't thousands
[58:33] that got saved at one time because of
[58:34] Stephen
[58:35] but thousands got saved because of
[58:38] Stephen you may see how does that work
[58:40] it was the Apostle Paul who was saw that
[58:43] was holding the coats of the ones that
[58:46] were stoning Stephen but in the midst of
[58:49] the persecution Stephen was still
[58:51] preaching he was still testifying and
[58:54] thou right there forever stood in the
[58:57] heart of Saul and it was because of
[58:59] Stephen that there was a many there's
[59:01] thousands people are still getting saved
[59:04] today because of the Apostle Paul
[59:07] come on now this wasn't a preacher he
[59:09] wasn't a Sunday school teacher he
[59:11] probably couldn't even sing but it was
[59:13] somebody that was expressing the power
[59:17] of God that there was a murderer there
[59:19] was a murdering Christians that gave us
[59:22] life to Christ because of that
[59:25] you see but before you can be an
[59:28] expression you gotta have that
[59:30] expression inside of us you see uh well
[59:33] we're an expression of what he has done
[59:35] for us but too many times we get laxed
[59:38] about it you see we're going to be
[59:40] celebrating Fourth of July you know that
[59:42] way I think it's Tuesday we're going to
[59:44] be celebrating Fourth of July and this
[59:46] day we reflect on what our forefathers
[59:48] did for us but you notice we didn't get
[59:51] a freedom of worship by accident we
[59:54] didn't get a freedom of speech by
[59:55] accident we didn't get all the freedoms
[59:58] that we have by accident we're not
[1:00:00] living under the brother the role of
[1:00:03] Britain by accident but it was some men
[1:00:06] that had a vision it was the man that
[1:00:08] says you know what I'm going to risk my
[1:00:10] life and stand up against the Tyranny
[1:00:12] you notice they wasn't giving their life
[1:00:14] for themselves because if they died they
[1:00:18] wasn't going to live in Liberty anyways
[1:00:19] but they was giving their life for the
[1:00:22] future Generations they was giving their
[1:00:25] life for the the for their families for
[1:00:27] for their wives for their children for
[1:00:29] their grandchildren they were they had
[1:00:31] the future of America in here in their
[1:00:34] mind and so right now we're expressing
[1:00:37] what they had in their mind but what is
[1:00:40] so sad about it is America is going down
[1:00:43] so fast and what happened is that today
[1:00:46] the Americans today have lost the Zeal
[1:00:49] that they had back then they've lost the
[1:00:52] fight that they had back then so all of
[1:00:55] the all of the men that lost their lives
[1:00:57] is now going down the tubes because some
[1:01:00] men today have lost this deal for it
[1:01:03] what happens if you forget where you
[1:01:05] come from you're going to go right back
[1:01:07] to it
[1:01:08] come on somebody watch the Bible tell
[1:01:10] why tell the children of Israel and
[1:01:12] beware lest you forget have I brought
[1:01:14] you out of the land of bondage beware if
[1:01:18] you forget you're going to go right back
[1:01:20] to it you look at America today it's
[1:01:22] going right back to where we come from
[1:01:25] and you see the same thing it's
[1:01:27] happening today we had a man called
[1:01:30] Christ Jesus give us a life for the cry
[1:01:33] for for the bride for the church but we
[1:01:36] have lost the Zeal that the that the
[1:01:39] early Apostles had and now what is
[1:01:41] happening we're going right back to the
[1:01:43] bondages that we was brought from
[1:01:46] whether the addictions that we was
[1:01:48] brought from if we're not careful we're
[1:01:51] going to lose the fights lose the Zeal
[1:01:53] just like America has lost the Zeal oh
[1:01:57] my you see that's why the devil's number
[1:02:00] one focus is taking your Liberty away
[1:02:02] because how can you claim the promises
[1:02:05] of God if you're bound how can you
[1:02:07] rejoice him the victory Of God if you're
[1:02:10] defeated how can you rejoice in
[1:02:12] Deliverance if you're still bound you
[1:02:14] look at Revelations 3 and 21 to him that
[1:02:17] overcometh will I grant the sins with me
[1:02:21] and my throne even as I also have
[1:02:23] overcome and sat down with my father in
[1:02:27] his throne that's why we have to have
[1:02:29] Liberty because without Liberty there's
[1:02:32] no overcoming power you see so the devil
[1:02:35] is coming after us to make us look warm
[1:02:38] to make us hormone to make us powerless
[1:02:40] because in that condition there is no
[1:02:43] Liberty you see the when a country loses
[1:02:46] the Liberty they lose their Spirit
[1:02:49] whenever they lose their Spirit they
[1:02:51] lose their Zelda facts when they'll lose
[1:02:53] their Zeal to fight they just become
[1:02:55] pushovers you notice whenever a country
[1:02:58] is defeated by another country they lose
[1:03:01] their language the the country that took
[1:03:04] them over they now become their language
[1:03:06] they're now their Enforcer they're now
[1:03:08] telling them what to do it's not that
[1:03:11] they want to but they're under a thumb
[1:03:13] of another oh come on now and that's
[1:03:16] what happens you can come to church
[1:03:18] every day of your life and listen to a
[1:03:20] tape read your Bible but without Liberty
[1:03:23] you're always going to be under the rule
[1:03:25] of another you're you're talking like
[1:03:28] you don't want to talk you're looking
[1:03:29] the things you don't want to look at
[1:03:31] you're under other you're under the
[1:03:34] thumb of another but the same Liberty
[1:03:37] that fell in your early experience can
[1:03:40] fall again and bring you out and give
[1:03:43] you Liberty once again you see that's
[1:03:46] exactly what the devil is trying to keep
[1:03:48] you from if he can keep you from your
[1:03:51] Liberty you can't express the Liberty
[1:03:54] that God has on Earth remember you're
[1:03:57] the only expression that there's a God
[1:03:59] on Earth so if he keeps you away from
[1:04:01] Liberty you can express the power of God
[1:04:05] oh my you see you you start to go back
[1:04:09] you start to drift to things you would
[1:04:11] never go to your CED he uses innocent
[1:04:14] things to take Liberty Away by the
[1:04:17] Branham says then every little jot and
[1:04:19] everything must be faithful always a
[1:04:21] little Vine the little fox the spools
[1:04:23] the vine sometimes you leave it's not
[1:04:25] the big things you do it's the little
[1:04:27] things you leave undone remember a chain
[1:04:30] is only a strongest at its weakest link
[1:04:34] so he says it's not the big things that
[1:04:36] you've done it's the little things that
[1:04:39] you haven't done it's the little
[1:04:41] complexes you haven't destroyed it's the
[1:04:44] little bitterness you kept alive it's
[1:04:46] the critical spirit you refuse to deal
[1:04:49] with it's those little things that that
[1:04:52] the devil is throwing upon you that is
[1:04:54] taking your Liberty away and you don't
[1:04:57] realize it at the time but the roots are
[1:04:59] getting deeper they're getting deeper
[1:05:01] they're getting deeper and overnight you
[1:05:03] just wake up and you realize that you're
[1:05:06] bounds you're addicted and it's because
[1:05:08] the little things are starting to put
[1:05:10] root in your garden
[1:05:13] you see you know our Gardens out there
[1:05:15] right now
[1:05:16] you're not going to get the rocks out of
[1:05:18] there by accident
[1:05:20] you're not going to get the weights out
[1:05:22] of there by accident but if you keep the
[1:05:24] weeds in there it's going to take over
[1:05:26] the garden it's going to take over the
[1:05:28] plants it's going to take over the
[1:05:30] fruits it's not that you put in there
[1:05:32] but they got their unaware and you did
[1:05:34] not do you do not you wasn't responsible
[1:05:37] and pulling them out and the devil's
[1:05:39] going to try to throw anything he can to
[1:05:42] mess up the garden and so your fruit
[1:05:44] ain't the fruits of the spirit but your
[1:05:47] fruits is of something else you see if
[1:05:50] our fruits it's not of the spirit then
[1:05:52] we're under the wrong spirit I know that
[1:05:55] the Dad read the scripture this morning
[1:05:57] but Psalms 112 and 14 unto the upright
[1:06:00] there will rise of light in the darkness
[1:06:02] he is gracious full of compassion and
[1:06:06] righteous and so this just struck me he
[1:06:09] is gracious full of compassion and
[1:06:11] righteous so the influence that the
[1:06:13] light brings is putting a different
[1:06:16] action than what the darkness brings if
[1:06:19] you're following me now they the
[1:06:21] influence that is now arising upon the
[1:06:24] church is another influence than what
[1:06:27] the world has and now the righteous the
[1:06:29] gracious and they're compassionate they
[1:06:32] didn't get that way by accident but
[1:06:34] there was an influence that they come
[1:06:36] under and our actions are not to express
[1:06:39] the flesh but we're to come under
[1:06:42] another influence and express the power
[1:06:45] of Jesus Christ you see we have to
[1:06:48] conquer our emotions conquer our
[1:06:51] feelings conquer our flesh because our
[1:06:54] flesh will give us a complex well I'm
[1:06:56] not pretty enough I'm fine I'm too fat
[1:06:59] I'm too skinny it ain't right there he's
[1:07:01] taking away the Liberty that God has put
[1:07:04] on you you know my complex whenever I
[1:07:07] was younger was I was so dark everybody
[1:07:09] thought I was a Mexican and that was the
[1:07:11] complex that I fought with and that was
[1:07:14] keeping me down whenever I would get up
[1:07:16] the scene how to fight that complex when
[1:07:18] I get up the preach out of five complex
[1:07:21] and if I let my flesh control me it
[1:07:24] would take my Liberty away because I
[1:07:27] thought I look like a Mexican it was
[1:07:29] something that the devil seen a weakness
[1:07:31] he seen something that I was tenderized
[1:07:34] towards and he was using that to pull my
[1:07:37] Liberty away and the devil would do that
[1:07:39] anyway you can he can he will come and
[1:07:42] say you're too smart you're too dumb
[1:07:44] you're too pretty you're too ugly you're
[1:07:46] too skinny you're too fat if we don't
[1:07:48] control our emotions he's taking away
[1:07:51] our Liberty and if he takes away the
[1:07:54] Liberty you're not expressing the light
[1:07:57] of God come on somebody we're not to
[1:08:00] express our emotions or feelings we're
[1:08:03] not to express our flesh but words of
[1:08:06] Express the Living God inside of the
[1:08:09] flesh that is proving that he's the same
[1:08:12] yesterday today and forever you see what
[1:08:16] happens in a complex jealousy will come
[1:08:19] and then since you can't look like that
[1:08:21] one you're not going to tear that one
[1:08:23] down because you can't be like that one
[1:08:25] something innocent that starts out to be
[1:08:28] your best friend a complex is your best
[1:08:31] friend that one don't like it so don't
[1:08:33] go talk to them you're going to get hurt
[1:08:35] so don't talk to that one oh that one
[1:08:37] don't like you better stay away from
[1:08:38] that one the complex is your best friend
[1:08:41] then what happens that complex ain't
[1:08:44] just happy with hurting you now you've
[1:08:46] got to Heart the other person that
[1:08:48] you've got a complex with and now you're
[1:08:50] going to look at that one and say you
[1:08:52] know what I'm not pretty like her so I'm
[1:08:54] going to tear her down I can't play
[1:08:56] basketball like that one can so I'm
[1:08:59] gonna tear him down it's a complex hope
[1:09:02] you're following me tonight it's a
[1:09:04] complex that is being brought on by the
[1:09:07] flesh but we've got the power by the
[1:09:10] spirit that's tear down every complex
[1:09:13] every insecurity every anxiety where we
[1:09:17] can express then not the power of the
[1:09:20] flesh but the power of Jesus Christ you
[1:09:24] see a complex I think I given this
[1:09:26] multiple times but a complex puts you in
[1:09:29] a Walt City you know I think I've given
[1:09:31] this here multiple times so just bear
[1:09:33] with me a complex you know that in the
[1:09:35] Bible talks about when Samaria was
[1:09:37] sieged and inside of this city was a
[1:09:40] bunch of people inside of the walls
[1:09:42] because there was somebody they thought
[1:09:45] was on the outside that was trying to
[1:09:48] kill them and inside of this city the
[1:09:50] famers started to take place and a
[1:09:53] drought started to take place because
[1:09:54] they cut off the water supply they cut
[1:09:57] off the food resources because they
[1:09:59] thought somebody was out there and you
[1:10:01] notice that the Bible puts this scene
[1:10:03] the Bible says that it got so bad inside
[1:10:07] of the city that the mothers were eating
[1:10:09] their own children
[1:10:11] you see that's what happens in a complex
[1:10:13] you're trying to protect yourself but
[1:10:16] you're hurting the ones around you
[1:10:18] you're hurting the family you're hurting
[1:10:21] your children you're hurting your life
[1:10:23] you're gonna come on somebody that's
[1:10:25] what a complex is you draw up within
[1:10:28] yourself trying to protect yourself this
[1:10:32] city was trying to protect themselves
[1:10:34] but at the same time their family was
[1:10:37] suffering they're the loved ones were
[1:10:40] suffering because they thought something
[1:10:42] was trying to hurt them
[1:10:44] I'm preaching now that's exactly what a
[1:10:47] complex does but you notice what happens
[1:10:50] there were some lepers that were setting
[1:10:52] on by the gates they wasn't allowed to
[1:10:55] be and be inside be inside the city with
[1:10:57] the rest of them there was some
[1:10:59] Castaways there were some nobodies but
[1:11:02] they had enough guts about them to say
[1:11:04] shall we sit here till we die if we go
[1:11:08] in the city we're going to be killed if
[1:11:10] we go outside of the gates we're going
[1:11:13] to be killed let us make a choice let's
[1:11:16] turn away from the city from death and
[1:11:20] go outside of the walls I think it's
[1:11:22] time that we make a decision I'm not
[1:11:25] turning back to my complex I'm not
[1:11:28] turning back to the flesh am I going to
[1:11:31] sit here till I die or am I going to
[1:11:34] find Liberty and the Bible says they
[1:11:37] walked outside of the city and there was
[1:11:40] nobody there there was inside of a city
[1:11:43] in a famine inside out of a city with
[1:11:46] the uh with a drought inside of a city
[1:11:48] eating their babies and there was
[1:11:50] nothing on the outside and let me say
[1:11:53] this the pastor loves you your sister
[1:11:55] loves you your Daddy loves you it's a
[1:11:58] complex that is built up a wall City
[1:12:01] keeping you from your Liberty but are
[1:12:04] you going to sit there till you die walk
[1:12:07] out of the city tonight walk out of the
[1:12:09] gates and accept your Liberty you don't
[1:12:12] gotta stay in that anxiety you don't got
[1:12:15] to stay in the complexes that the devil
[1:12:18] is throwing upon you you have to walk
[1:12:21] out you're going to make a decision you
[1:12:23] see those lepers do we're going to sit
[1:12:25] here and die why do I sit here whenever
[1:12:28] I can make an advance to my freedom
[1:12:31] human they might not have got there
[1:12:33] right away but they was making good
[1:12:35] answers their money got scared halfway
[1:12:37] there and stop it says I don't know
[1:12:40] should we do this but there was father
[1:12:42] alone than what they was 10 minutes ago
[1:12:44] oh and they kept on walking oh I don't
[1:12:47] know there might be somebody out there
[1:12:49] but there were father alone than what
[1:12:52] they just were and every time they took
[1:12:54] a step there was getting closer to their
[1:12:57] Liberty that was getting closer to food
[1:12:59] that was getting closer to water you
[1:13:02] might have to press your way through
[1:13:04] that complex but every step you take
[1:13:06] you're getting closer to your Liberty
[1:13:09] you might have to press your way past
[1:13:12] that anxiety but every step that you
[1:13:15] take your stepfather away from that and
[1:13:18] closer to your Liberty and the Bible
[1:13:21] says you shall know the truth and the
[1:13:24] truth shall make you free and why is
[1:13:27] this a message it's the truth that has
[1:13:29] come to the bride to let you know
[1:13:31] there's no Spirit there's no chain
[1:13:34] there's no addiction there's no
[1:13:36] complexes that can keep you away from
[1:13:40] your Liberty but you've got to make a
[1:13:42] choice and see I'm not going to sit here
[1:13:44] Penny longer I'm making a step closer to
[1:13:48] my Liberty so that I can express
[1:13:52] I can express the power of God brother
[1:13:54] Josh that brother did me wrong that
[1:13:57] sister Demi wrote that one did me wrong
[1:13:59] who cares
[1:14:01] come on somebody who cares if they did
[1:14:04] you wrong the Bible says forgive them
[1:14:06] the Bible says not just seven times but
[1:14:09] 70 times seven you know what that means
[1:14:11] that's a lot of forgiven that we got to
[1:14:14] do in order to get out of the city
[1:14:17] I'm preaching now so in order to get out
[1:14:20] of your city you're gonna have to
[1:14:21] forgive somebody in order to get out of
[1:14:24] that City the step you might have to
[1:14:26] take is to come up to a brother and say
[1:14:29] I'm sorry I've had an art against you
[1:14:31] but somebody else they might in order to
[1:14:35] get out of a city couldn't walk down and
[1:14:37] say you said something to hurt my
[1:14:38] feelings
[1:14:40] I need to make this right so I can get
[1:14:43] out of my city no matter where you're at
[1:14:45] the same now you've got to make advances
[1:14:48] to get out of that City because inside
[1:14:51] of the city is death inside of the walls
[1:14:54] is death but outside of the walls is a
[1:14:57] liberty outside of the walls is
[1:15:00] fellowship outside of the walls is a
[1:15:03] freedom of worship you want to worship
[1:15:05] God like you'd never have before come
[1:15:08] out of the walls you want to rejoice and
[1:15:11] shout and dance like never before come
[1:15:14] out of the walls you want to see God
[1:15:16] inside of your life inside of your
[1:15:19] family come out of the walls
[1:15:22] come out of the walls and express a
[1:15:26] higher power
[1:15:30] you may feel surrounded remember the
[1:15:32] story of Elijah he and her servant come
[1:15:35] out of the house and they were
[1:15:36] surrounded by the syrians and the
[1:15:38] servants that my master were about to
[1:15:40] die were surrounded there's there's a
[1:15:43] lot of them and he stops and Elijah says
[1:15:46] there's more with us than there are
[1:15:48] within
[1:15:49] he said what
[1:15:50] have you seen the armies out there and
[1:15:53] there's only two of us and he says Lord
[1:15:55] open this boy's eyes his eyes come open
[1:15:58] and there was Chariots of Fire all along
[1:16:01] the mountaintops thus surpassed the
[1:16:03] armies of the syrians and if we can just
[1:16:06] realize that there's Chariots of fires
[1:16:09] all around us brother Branham says this
[1:16:12] what the love of God
[1:16:14] I have God is doing right now moving
[1:16:16] around in this building what an
[1:16:18] atmosphere this is an atmosphere that I
[1:16:21] wish I could live in forever for this
[1:16:23] sweet humble feeling what is it angels
[1:16:26] are walking up and down the aisles all
[1:16:29] around these posts around this tent on
[1:16:32] the outside angels of God are moving
[1:16:34] their great wings are spread you may say
[1:16:37] well that's just for brother Branham
[1:16:39] brother Branham says the angel of the
[1:16:41] Lord accompanies this message always now
[1:16:43] maybe so not hope so but whenever this
[1:16:46] message is being preached there is a
[1:16:49] liberty that is wanting to be expressed
[1:16:51] through your life
[1:16:53] through your heart the Bible says in
[1:16:55] second Corinthians 3 and 17 now the Lord
[1:16:58] is the spirit and we're the spirit of
[1:17:00] the Lord is there is Liberty there was
[1:17:03] Freedom there's healing the captives are
[1:17:05] set free anxiety is broken second
[1:17:09] Timothy 1 and 7 for God hath not given
[1:17:12] us the spirit of fear but of power of
[1:17:15] love and of a sound mind so the fear
[1:17:18] that is trying to trap Your Mind Trap
[1:17:20] your body the spirit of the Lord has
[1:17:23] full control over so that you now can
[1:17:26] express the love whether Branham says
[1:17:28] this you don't want you see the the
[1:17:30] trumpet sounded and he can go free it's
[1:17:32] God's grace it's the Year of Jubilee the
[1:17:35] completion the day of sin is over
[1:17:37] brother I tell every one of you servants
[1:17:40] seeing tape invisible audience everyone
[1:17:43] that are serving sin the day of sin is
[1:17:46] over Jesus died you don't have to serve
[1:17:49] sin no more he says you don't have to be
[1:17:52] bowed down the Creeds and denominations
[1:17:54] he who the son has set free is free
[1:17:57] indeed if you want to be free in the sun
[1:18:01] Cut Loose from all those things and
[1:18:03] serve him come on Amen
[1:18:06] if you want to be free you've got to cut
[1:18:09] it
[1:18:10] you've got to make a choice you may say
[1:18:13] brother Josh how I now go Thee I thought
[1:18:15] the Lord delivers us he does but you got
[1:18:17] to allow him to
[1:18:19] true come on now you've got to allow him
[1:18:21] to be your portion you've got to allow
[1:18:24] him to be your God you've got to allow
[1:18:26] him to be the Lord Mighty Empire of the
[1:18:28] Bible says in Psalms 24 and 8 who is
[1:18:30] this king of glory the lord strong and
[1:18:33] mighty the Lord Mighty in battle he's
[1:18:36] open-minded eyes he's open death ears
[1:18:39] he's seen that he he's caused the
[1:18:41] cripples to walk he's brought back the
[1:18:44] Dead
[1:18:45] but should God allow him to work in your
[1:18:47] life it's an incredible thing that the
[1:18:50] maker of heavens and earth the one that
[1:18:52] said let there be light let there be a
[1:18:54] son that cause Lazarus from the dead and
[1:18:57] we can contain him in our own lives
[1:18:59] think about it you contain him are you
[1:19:02] you keep him from working the miraculous
[1:19:05] in your life
[1:19:06] because you refuse hope this is okay
[1:19:11] we keep him in a little room and say you
[1:19:13] can work in this but don't touch my
[1:19:15] bitterness you you you you could work on
[1:19:18] this part but don't touch my hard
[1:19:19] feelings don't touch that heart don't do
[1:19:22] this right there you're keeping him from
[1:19:25] bringing forth a liberty
[1:19:27] but the Bible says that wherefore God
[1:19:30] also has exalted him and given him a
[1:19:33] name which is above every name fill up
[1:19:35] the name of Jesus every knee shall bow
[1:19:38] of things in heaven things and Earth and
[1:19:40] things under the Earth Romans 8 and 37
[1:19:43] ain't all these things we are more than
[1:19:45] conquerors
[1:19:46] through him that love this I know these
[1:19:48] are scriptures we all know but there's a
[1:19:51] true power to it if we can just catch it
[1:19:53] if we can let the maker of heavens and
[1:19:55] earth inside of my ship let him control
[1:19:58] Peter you've got to stop trying to
[1:20:01] control the ship it was Peter that says
[1:20:03] I'm a fisherman I can do this and he
[1:20:06] quickly realized he did not have the
[1:20:08] means to bring forth the Liberty but
[1:20:11] there was one in the boats that have the
[1:20:13] ability to bring forth Liberty you
[1:20:15] remember the story when the waves and
[1:20:17] the the the winds and the storms are
[1:20:19] blowing rain was falling Peter was
[1:20:22] trying to control the ship and the maker
[1:20:24] of the Winds was in the boat oh Peter
[1:20:27] had to do was let him control it you see
[1:20:30] that's the thing though we don't like
[1:20:32] giving up is control
[1:20:34] peanut butter Branham says you you uh me
[1:20:37] and whenever somebody's in a car and
[1:20:39] you're in the passenger seat and you
[1:20:40] ever you feel like they're going too
[1:20:42] fast you're stomping on the floor he
[1:20:44] says you're trying to steer he says you
[1:20:46] like to be in control of things
[1:20:48] but many times in order to get our
[1:20:51] Liberty we got to lose control and say
[1:20:53] God deal with this
[1:20:56] I can't do it because remember before
[1:20:58] you can be an expression you've got to
[1:21:01] have Liberty for yourself
[1:21:05] remember the the quote by the Bible
[1:21:07] talks about in Mark Mark 11 and 2. and
[1:21:10] he saith unto them go your way into the
[1:21:12] village over against you and as soon as
[1:21:15] you be entered into it you shall find a
[1:21:17] cold side whenever I and we're on every
[1:21:20] man sets loose him and bring him and if
[1:21:24] any man say unto you why do you why do
[1:21:27] you this say that the Lord hath need of
[1:21:30] him and straightway he will send him
[1:21:33] hither and they went their way found the
[1:21:35] coats hide by the door without in a
[1:21:38] place where two ways met and they loose
[1:21:42] him but you notice that code had a
[1:21:44] purpose long before he was ever on the
[1:21:47] earth you looked at Luke 4 and 18 the
[1:21:49] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[1:21:52] has anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:21:54] the poor he has sent me to heal the
[1:21:57] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:21:59] the captives recovering of sight to the
[1:22:01] blind the set of Liberty them that are
[1:22:04] bruised it was this coach's
[1:22:06] responsibility to bring forth Liberty
[1:22:09] you look at Zechariah 99 Rejoice greatly
[1:22:12] o Daughter of Zion shout oh daughter of
[1:22:15] Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto
[1:22:17] thee he is just having salvation lowly
[1:22:20] riding upon an ass upon a coat of the
[1:22:23] fold of an ass but before he could bring
[1:22:26] Liberty to the captive he had to be set
[1:22:28] free
[1:22:30] come on now he was predestinated he was
[1:22:33] called he was chosen among all of the
[1:22:36] donkeys to bring forth Liberty but he
[1:22:40] was bound still
[1:22:41] but he needed the preacher Christ didn't
[1:22:44] go up and loose him but he commissioned
[1:22:46] somebody else to to go up and loose them
[1:22:49] loose their coat so the Liberty can be
[1:22:52] brought
[1:22:53] this is the preacher tonight I might not
[1:22:56] be the physical body of Jesus Christ but
[1:22:58] we're under a commission to lose you and
[1:23:01] let you go so that you can fulfill the
[1:23:04] purpose you're not that that coats way
[1:23:07] wasn't on Earth to be bound his whole
[1:23:09] life he was on Earth to bring forth
[1:23:11] Liberty you're on Earth to bring forth
[1:23:14] Liberty But first you got to be
[1:23:17] liberated Moses couldn't Express Liberty
[1:23:20] until he was loosed what happened the
[1:23:23] burning bush had what Moses needed the
[1:23:26] Liberty that Moses needed was in the
[1:23:29] burning bush but the Liberty didn't just
[1:23:31] stay in the burning bush but delivered
[1:23:33] it I was inside of the burning bush come
[1:23:35] on side of Moses and now the Liberty
[1:23:38] started to express itself he would go up
[1:23:41] and say Pharaoh let my people go it was
[1:23:44] the Liberty that he experienced he was
[1:23:46] now expressing whenever he come to the
[1:23:49] Red Sea he says you know what I am
[1:23:51] liberated and I have caught I'm called
[1:23:54] to liberate the people he will he would
[1:23:57] stretches his staff over the Red Sea
[1:23:59] because he was liberated whenever they
[1:24:02] needed water and he would smack the rock
[1:24:04] because he was liberated whenever he
[1:24:06] would they they needed Manna From Heaven
[1:24:08] he did a favor because he was liberated
[1:24:11] the armies of Gideon they was
[1:24:14] outnumbered but they was just expressing
[1:24:16] the Liberty the Gideon had found behind
[1:24:19] the red the The Wine Press you notice
[1:24:22] the message that the angel brought
[1:24:25] liberated Gideon from complexes from
[1:24:28] insecurities you're like a judges Sixth
[1:24:31] and fifth six and fifteen and he said
[1:24:33] unto me oh my Lord where will shall I
[1:24:35] save Israel behold my family is poor in
[1:24:38] Manasseh I am the least in my father's
[1:24:41] house and the Lord said unto him surely
[1:24:43] I will be with thee Thou shalt Smite the
[1:24:46] midianites as one man
[1:24:48] he called him a mighty man of Valor that
[1:24:52] message liberated him from his complexes
[1:24:55] that was the Liberty that David found
[1:24:59] that liberated the armies of Israel you
[1:25:01] notice the Bible says that after that
[1:25:04] after David cut off Goliath's head the
[1:25:07] Bible says that the men of Israel seen
[1:25:10] that and chased the Philistines they
[1:25:12] chased the Philistines out of the land
[1:25:14] because of because David found a liberty
[1:25:19] he couldn't have done that unless he was
[1:25:21] anointed by by the prophet but once he
[1:25:25] found the Liberty
[1:25:26] the children of Israel found their
[1:25:28] Liberty you look at first Samuel 17 and
[1:25:31] 51 therefore David ran and stood upon
[1:25:34] the Philistine took a sword drew it out
[1:25:37] of the sheath therefore it slew him cut
[1:25:39] off his head there with when the
[1:25:41] Philistines saw their Champion was dead
[1:25:43] and they fled and when the men of Israel
[1:25:46] and of Judah Rose and shouted and
[1:25:49] pursued the Philistines and so they came
[1:25:51] to the valley
[1:25:53] what was then they seen somebody with
[1:25:56] Liberty being expressed that they said
[1:25:58] you know what if David did it I can do
[1:26:00] it too I'm going to express Liberty like
[1:26:04] David
[1:26:05] and you see the Bible says we're bought
[1:26:07] with the price there was a man that paid
[1:26:10] the price for our Liberty and since he a
[1:26:13] liberty we now can have Liberty and the
[1:26:16] Bible says glorify God in your body in
[1:26:19] your body in your Fallen flesh glorify
[1:26:23] God in your Fallen Humanity glorify God
[1:26:26] in your Fallen States glorify Gods
[1:26:30] because there was one that brought
[1:26:32] Liberty but you got to fight for it this
[1:26:35] ain't something that's going to come
[1:26:36] while you're sitting at a picnic you've
[1:26:39] got to fight for your Liberty remember
[1:26:41] the remember Switzerland was being
[1:26:43] attacked there wasn't a fighting people
[1:26:45] they didn't have an army they didn't
[1:26:47] have weapons or they had with stones and
[1:26:49] and rakes and shovels but there was
[1:26:52] willing to fight for their Liberty and
[1:26:54] there stood a man that says today I give
[1:26:57] my life for my country and you know how
[1:26:59] the story goes he ran down the hill and
[1:27:02] he went to the deepest of the Spears and
[1:27:04] said make way for Liberty from the
[1:27:07] brainum sets he threw Spears into his
[1:27:09] chest and says Make Way for Liberty and
[1:27:13] right there brother Branham says that
[1:27:15] made a hole in the front lines and then
[1:27:18] the rest of the army was behind them
[1:27:20] with their clubs with their with
[1:27:23] their with their pitchforks and they
[1:27:25] swung the battle and they'd never had
[1:27:27] another war in Switzerland since well
[1:27:30] was it a man found Liberty and once he
[1:27:32] found Liberty the rest of the armies
[1:27:35] found Liberty Christ has given a
[1:27:37] slippery you still gotta fight the
[1:27:40] armies of Switzerland they still had a
[1:27:41] fight but now there was a hole that they
[1:27:44] could fight through and my brother
[1:27:45] praying that makes a drama he dramatizes
[1:27:48] it and he says that was a minor thing he
[1:27:51] says the children of Adam the race of
[1:27:53] Adam was up against the walls they
[1:27:55] couldn't get past the sin barrier but
[1:27:58] there stood up a man that says today I
[1:28:00] give my life for Liberty and he says
[1:28:03] Christ ran to the deepest of the Spears
[1:28:06] and says Make Way for Liberty and he
[1:28:09] says he put a hole and they are I put a
[1:28:11] hole in that military and he says fights
[1:28:14] with what you've got we're not going to
[1:28:17] get Liberty by accident Christ gave us
[1:28:19] Liberty but we gotta fight for it we've
[1:28:22] got to be willing to press and press
[1:28:24] press through the Mind battles press
[1:28:27] through the complexes press through the
[1:28:29] anxiety press through the bitterness so
[1:28:32] that we can experience and express
[1:28:34] Liberty
[1:28:37] as the musicians come
[1:28:40] we got to express it
[1:28:42] before we can express it
[1:28:44] we got experience it
[1:28:47] Galatians 5 and 1 Stand Fast therefore
[1:28:50] in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath
[1:28:52] made us free be not entangled again with
[1:28:56] the Yoke of bondage he didn't say lay
[1:28:59] there in the Liberty set there in the
[1:29:01] Liberty he says you're going to have to
[1:29:03] stand
[1:29:04] Stand Fast it's not going to be easy
[1:29:07] there's going to be times you feel like
[1:29:09] running but you got to make a stand
[1:29:12] how did Stonewall Jackson
[1:29:14] get his name Stonewall history says
[1:29:17] though whenever everybody was running
[1:29:19] the enemy was approaching his men was
[1:29:22] running and they turned around and
[1:29:24] Stonewall Jackson was still standing
[1:29:26] there and one man says mine he's
[1:29:28] standing like a stone wall it was in the
[1:29:31] midst of the heat of the battle that he
[1:29:34] refused to turn around and run I left
[1:29:37] out brother Harry brought forth the the
[1:29:39] armor
[1:29:40] he had the breastplate the shoes the
[1:29:42] shield the soil the helmet but there's
[1:29:44] nothing on your back
[1:29:45] you got everything that you have need of
[1:29:48] to stand and fight but once you turn
[1:29:50] around and run you're on your own
[1:29:53] but if you stand fast in the Liberty
[1:29:55] we're not giving any inch to the devil
[1:29:57] not the complexes not to insecurities
[1:30:00] not to bitterness but we're standing
[1:30:02] fast in the Liberty
[1:30:05] now God has given us amen can we stand
