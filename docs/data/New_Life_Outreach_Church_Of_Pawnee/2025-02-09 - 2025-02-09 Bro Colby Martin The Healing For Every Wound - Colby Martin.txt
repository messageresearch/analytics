where would I be you only know I'm glad you see through Eyes Of Love a hopess case such an empty [Music] place if not for Grace how many's thankful for Grace here tonight thank God for his grace amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles I would like to turn to Psalms 103 and as you're turning I have a few quotes I'd like to read says and when I see the angel take his chair maybe lean back toward his back toward the tent and Sarah listening through the tent and you know kindly Eve ear dropping you know and listening through the tent she was kind of in an awful mood that morning and don't you see things when you come to church in that kind of a mood you just no need of trying it just might as well stay home you won't get anything out of it but when you come to church come prayed up come in the atmosphere come expecting he says if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on God and off the things of the world go about your business go to church go to washing of dishes what whatever you are keep your mind on him all day and all night long then God will do something you're drawing close to him and you got the world shut out just you and he are together David spoke that he was write his Commandments upon the bed post and meditate on them day and night that's what the church ought to do would keep your heart tuned in with God day and night for then for it's then when he appears Solomon said as a man thanketh in his heart so is he begin to think that you're one of his children and that you're saved and he's good to you and you love him and he loves you don't just wait until you go to church or some convenient hour just keep him on your mind all the time amen if we um can turn to Psalms 103 and verse one 103 and verse one how many loves him here tonight when you're there say Amen says bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all of thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases if we could turn to Psalms 147 and verse three Psalms 1 47 and verse three said he Health the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds if I also con turn to a few more Psalm 17 and verse 22 17 and verse 22 it says a merry heart death good like a medicine but a broken Spirit dth the bones one more then I'll let you have your seats Jeremiah 30 and verse 17 Jeremiah 30 and verse 17 says for I will restore Health unto thee and I will heal thee of thy wounds sayith the Lord gracious Heavenly Father how we love you tonight Lord want to thank you for your mercy and your goodness your Amazing Grace and your love that you've shed and you've shown to each one of us Lord I pray that you'll just be with us in this remaining part of the service Lord just bless the reading of your word and your precious and lovely name we pray amen you may be seated here tonight I appreciate Dad singing his song I haven't heard that in quite some time but that is going to be my topic for tonight is something that I've been dealing with in my own heart for some time now it's the healing for every wound the healing for every wound and some of us have had broken bones I would imagine some of us have had stitches um seeing my my cousin have that that sledding accident and the stitches that it took place to to to to try to heal the wound that she had and you know some of us might have even had a gunshot wound and I was preaching in Arkansas and I hit on that I asked if somebody has ever had a gunshot wound here and I had a person actually raise his hand he's like I've been shot his wife yelled out yeah twice like wow okay so there's people that I have have wounds in their bodies but the wounds and the healing that I want to address tonight and Lord will and I want to go along my testimony if I may but it goes beyond the physical it goes beyond your body and it goes to the sense of the spirit the realm of the memory in your in your conscience and your affections they are the hidden wounds that are within our hearts they are wounds that that can't be stitched they can't be bandaged they they can't be stapled they can't be taken care of with with the natural tools that we have in this world today and we like to talk about old physical wounds like like there's some crazy thing that took place to get this wound and seeing Simeon you know with his scar and and the story that he has from getting scoped you know as young men we can tell a dramatic story and how how heroic we were to get that scar amen right but it just takes a split second recollection of a hidden womb within us that can cause pain it maybe memories of abuse in your life maybe it's memories of ridicule or or criticism maybe it could be neglect it could be hatred it could be physical abuse that took place it maybe emotional abuse maybe even spiritual abuse that has taken place where do you get hidden wombs you get them every where you get it through Society or through parents or through family children brothers sisters Aunts Uncles your wife your husband friends acquaintances church members even pastors one thing is for certain everybody has or has had a hidden scar an emotional scar in your life or at least one you may be masking it by wearing a fake facade around people but deep down inside your heart you're hurting there's something that has taken place that has traumatized your life ain't that right another thing is certain emotional wounds take longer to heal Than Physical wounds it says a soldier comes back from war and he has shrapnel in his body he's limping he's got bandages on his right arm and around his head give it six to9 months he'll be physically okay but the emotional wounds from the ravages of War will be with him for a long long time this story is being told by the grandson's perspective it says here my grandfather on my mother's side fought in World War II in the South Pacific he says I remember growing up excuse me he saids I would stay at their house quite often and on a few occasions I remember him having nightmares of killing Japanese soldiers he was in the 70 that was in the 7s and the war was in the' 40s just recently he had one of his legs amputated and during recovery from surgery someone walked into his hospital room and he was hiding behind his bed hiding from Japanese soldiers he was in his 80s and the war was 60 years ago so we understand that emotional scars can last a long long time but no matter the source of the scar there is healing for every wound how many can say Amen to that Psalms 11981 says my soul fainteth for thou for thy salvation but I hope in thy word my eyes fail for Thy word saying when will thou comfort me Psalms 3418 says the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken spirit and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit the ESV version says there the Lord is near to the Brokenhearted and he saves the crushed in spirit there is healing for every hurt he is the Hope for every need amen we heard that this morning he is Jehovah Gyra he will provide Jehovah Nissi the Lord that gives victory of Deliverance Jehovah sha the everpresent one he is Jehovah Shalom the Lord is our peace and in Exodus 15 it says I am Jehovah Rafa which means I am the god that Health thee Psalms 147 and3 says he heals the broken in heart and he binds up their wounds you see our sin situation required a savior but our emotional situation requires a Healer there's times in our life we don't realize that we need a healing from a past wound there's times in our life that we thought we have gotten over something in our life and then something triggers it to allow it to resurface again you thought you were past a sin or or a mistake you thought you got forgiveness in some area or you thought you got past the pain and the hurt of a situation in your life until something brings it back up again and you realize you've never dealt with that situation hello somebody we can repent and be born again of water and spirit and that takes care of our sin situation but what about the scars in our hurts inside God just doesn't want to take care of our sin situation but he wants to heal our hearts hello somebody God says that I can forgive you in an instant and I can wash away your sins I can fill you with my spirit but there's so much more that I want to do I want to heal your hurts and I want to heal your wounds and I want to give you a joy and a peace and a happiness that you've never experienced in your life let me tell you something as long as you continue to hide hurts within your heart you're never going to truly experience what God has for you you can always wear a smile and you always think you're You're great and you're fine and you're happy until something triggers it then you go back to a place that you thought you were rid of too many times we let God deal with the sin part of our life but we never let him deal with the hurts and that always leads to frustrations because we still have wounds let me tell you something these wounds I'm speaking from experience here these dark scars these hurts if they're not taken care of you will never have a complete breakthrough hello somebody you say brother kby that can't happen brother brandham dealt with cases like this in the message the second Miracle he begins to Desert a lady and she is dealing with a nervous condition and she also has cancer and he continues to deal with her and he tells her she had a dog scare as a child hello somebody says this here but you had so many good teachings you've had so many Sorrows too haven't you lady had a great scare once in your life something seemed like when you was a school girl I believe it was a dog or something along he said I can see something bark and go on and you jump and scream you were just a little child and down comes Life coming down recently you've been real nervous oh but there's something else moving up Sister he says I'm sorry yes I believe you know it it's cancer and I come here for just a moment but he be begins to pray for this lady now he's identified what has taking place right and now he begins to pray says Thou demon in the name of Jesus Christ come out from this woman everyone keep your head bowed he said there it goes there it goes lady keep your head bowed now there it goes once you identify something within your life you can have a complete experience Amen brother brandom also tells here another story he said about a certain lady married to a man by the name of brother huff and this couple had a set of twins brother Brenham says these twins were staunch Christians and brother Brandon brings out the story in the message in uncertain sound he says one little girl going to school she got a complex the girl tells her the girls tell her well why don't you smoke like we do and you think you're better than we are why don't you go to the dances now they didn't go to the dances neither did they smoke or drink and they made fun of her the healthier girl she said huh well let them jump in the river I'm the one serving Christ they don't want to let them go ahead but the other one she be to think oh maybe I could do something and she built a complex and got nervous brother the brandom says here she went insane and they had to put her in an institution for two years complexes will destroy you emotional scars of abuse and things that ain't handled will destroy you do you not realize that there could be situations in your life that affect you as an adult that happened as a child come on somebody fight complexes if I wonder if people love me wonder if I'm ever going to be good enough wondering if I'm ever going to get a healing in my body all because of something that took place as a child I struggled for the longest time with certain family members because of the stuff that I've done years ago and every time I was around them I wondered if they loved me and I I wondered if they have forgiven me how many's ever been there you know what fixed it is becoming completely honest and say Lord I need your help you know I was driving back I was on the road with my family and I got a call from this family member it happened 20 years ago but it still haunted me and has still affected me I always wondered if they had forgiven me 20 years ago things that happened and I got a call just randomly out of the blue from this individual saying Colby just letting you know I forgive you randomly out of the blue 20 years of wandering if if if if if I've gotten over this 20 years in a random call you can ask my wife I woke her up crying she was sleeping I woke her up crying saying I got my answer I didn't know come on somebody God can heal a lot of times as church members we can Mi we can mistake feeling for healing hello somebody we can mistake us getting a feeling here and if falling upon our spirit map we can Rejoice we can shout we can dance but we never truly allow God God to come down deep within the heart we we we we mistake emotions for a complete delivery Deliverance hello somebody and because of it we live our life on a roller coaster by midweek we're up here we're doing great we feel like we've gotten something from the Lord we're doing fantastic by Sunday what happens you're back down again then you go to church and you feel something within your heart we have based our deliverance on feelings that's why we don't base our Salvation on feelings we got to know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we have the Holy Ghost within our heart because on the good times we praise him on the bad times when we don't feel nothing we praise him because our salvation is based more than what our body is telling us we base it upon something that has a sure Foundation we don't base it off emotions even though emotions is great I want to cry in the presence of the Lord and I want to be able to dance in the presence of the Lord but we can't base what we have On Emotion because emotions will be like this a roller coaster hello somebody maybe I'm just preaching to myself let me skip some of this here brother brandom continues with his story here and he's talking to that twin girl and then saying Asylum he said I keep talking with her oh but the grace of God he did just in a few minutes the Holy Ghost begin to move him I said Margaret you don't know me but I said all your life said you been big enough to know about boys you've had in your mind you're going to marry a preacher you wanted to marry a preacher and she started to smile he said that caught see I seen the Holy Spirit had it then I said thus saith the Lord it is over what took place was that Spirit had to be identified they had to get to the root of the problem to realize that there is things in her life as a child that has triggered complexes that's triggered emotion that has kept her insane but once brother brand identified it and was able to pinpoint what took place what happened he can say it is over I found out that you can never truly get help from God unless you first ask him for help God wants to help God wants to give you a deliverance and a peace like you've never had but you got to get to a point of desperation to where God I I need you you've got to get it out the Bible talks about the problem of stuffing it inside Psalms 3 in verse one says I will take heed to my ways that I sin not with my tongue and I will mouth and I will keep my mouth with a bridal while the wicked is before me I was dumb with silence I held my peace even from good and my sorrow was stirred my heart was hot within me while I was musing the fire then I spake with my tongue he saying holding on to hurts it's like carrying hot colds within your heart hdden wounds and you try to stuff them down they don't heal they Fest her and pushing her hert aside doesn't get rid of it it only makes it worse I hope this is okay David said while I kept things to myself I felt weak inside he said I moan all the day low he said it's emotionally draining ain't that right finding out that people deal I'm almost through people deal with things or hurts in different ways there are some people that try to forget it there are some people that CH to drugs and alcohol some just turn their back on God and question what they believe people do different things but none of them truly work I found out that hurt people hurt people hurt people hurt people and when a person is so hurt deep inside they buil an emotional wall around that area and because they never want to be hurt like that again so they put up defenses around that area I look this up and it's called a defense mechanism you watch an individual that has been hurt in the past and you watch watch how they are happy and they're lifting up their hands in church and they're sociable and all of a sudden this person begins to change someone that was once happy is now depressed someone that was once a social butterfly is now a recluse they are pulling away from church get togethers they don't want to visit family anymore and when they do come to church they're no longer allowing themselves to be free in worship when a person is going through this and something triggers in their mind what happens they run to a place that makes them feel safe hello somebody you run to addictions to give a temporary peace really ain't that what addiction is they make you feel good for the moment but it don't show you the aftermath of what addictions can do to you we want to run to a place where we feel safe or we been hurt in an area so we build up walls and then when that area is struck again we run to a space in our life to where we feel safe to where we're never going to be hurt like that again people run to drugs that helps you forget about your problems for the moment people run to alcohol it helps you you drowned out your sorrows and your pain people run to pornography because it it it helps for the moment makes you feel good for the moment they run to habits they want to feel safe no matter the outcome they run to a shell when they feel pain this is called a split condition I found out having a relationship with the lord requires us to fully trust in God and if you don't fully trust God you will go back to the conditions that you can trust hello somebody if you don't have your full trust in God you're going to run back to the conditions that you do trust that where you feel safe Peter dealt with this he dealt with a rejection complex how many people likes to be rejected I mean yeah I do I wake up every morning and say I want to be rejected it's my goal in life to see how many people can reject me in one day no everybody loves to be accepted everybody doesn't like to be rejected so Peter was facing a rejection complex and we can see how Peter he was zealous for the Lord he loved the Lord he makes the statement that wherever you go Lord I will go I will die for you Lord but still understand in this moment of weakness he still faced a rejection complex he didn't want to feel rejected he wanted to feel accepted he wanted to be accepted so we begin to see the story of Peter how he's standing beside the fire when Jesus walks in and Peter denies Christ what happened Peter goes to his safe place in his condition remember remember they they approached him the people around the fire said hey ain't you the guy that followed Jesus well well no no no he didn't want to be rejected he wanted to be accepted so he what happened he went to a safe place in his condition and in this condition there was another identity called Peter the fisherman who didn't know Christ hello somebody he went to an area because look they found Peter naked on the boat fishing he went to an area where he felt safe to where he knew that he can trust in this condition but what happened on the day of Pentecost when the fire the tongues came down upon him what took place the coward Peter became a man that was zealous for the Lord full of Courage the next thing you see is Peter standing out saying this is that what took place it took him from the condition in the identity of Peter the fisherman that didn't know Christ to Peter the fisherman or not the fisherman but Peter the one that knew Christ he came out with a boldness but just because you have the Holy Ghost doesn't free you of hurts am I the only one that's ever experienced that you could be saved and still have the wounds and the hurts and the pains from the past where you need God to come in and completely perform surgery upon your heart brother Robert probably knows this but there is a process since he's good with computers there is a process that a computer goes through when it crashes is called the rebooting process pardon me and what it does it refreshes all the system memory registers making them ready to start over again it makes it look good makes it look clean but if you have a piece inside the motherboard that's toxic no matter how many times you reset your computer until you change the piece inside of that motherboard it's always going to go back to that toxic setting you can reboot it and you can reboot it and you can reboot it and it looks good it looks great but after time what takes place it goes right back to that toxic condition so what they have to do is unplug the equipment and they have to go to the motherboard and you will find things that look like discs they are called Cash memories I assume sister Leah knows that too she's good at computers as well and once you replace the faulty piece the computer will start working like it's supposed to they see the mind is like a computer the average human brain has the ability to store the equivalent of 2.5 million gigabytes of digital memory that it's a lot that's a lot of memory how many gigabytes you know 2.5 million gigabytes how much is that on a regular computer is there any computer that can hold that there's none there's none so you can see we can store a lot of good and we can store a lot of bad here and it's amazing brother Dyan how you could be 99% good memories but it's that 1% of bad that can completely destroy all the good memories hello and it's in this moment of pain Satan came in and changed out a fault a good piece with a faulty piece so you come to church and in the presence of the Lord you get the reboot that you so desperately need you feel good you feel great You Feel clean you like yes yes I needed this I feel awesome but then something will trigger an emotion or a feeling or a pain then you go back to that faulty setting again hello somebody then you'll come back you'll get rebooted only to fall back to that faulty setting again we all need a good rebooting and a good refreshing daily don't we Paul said I Die daily but some of us need the great physician to come into our heart and take out that faulty piece and replace it with something new again we can come to church and feel the presence of the Lord but until we deal with that faulty toxic peace within the motherboard which is our heart no matter how many times we get a rebooting in the presence of the Lord until you change out that faulty piece you're always going to go go back to that setting a complex a pain a hurt you know like I said maybe I should look at the wall and preach to myself because this is something I've been dealing with something that the Lord has been showing me in my heart you can come to church you can have a position you can have a role you can sing you can do whatever you want to do but until that faulty peace is replaced within your heart no matter how many times you try in your own ability until God performs surgery and places a new piece within that heart you're going to keep falling to addiction after addiction to pornography to drugs to alcohol trying to drown out the pain but there is a God that's a Healer that can perform surgery on that toxic peace do you love him know with in my own heart I needed that had to come to a place of complete honesty to where God I needed God I I need you God I need you we allow the cares of this world to to put heaviness upon us we allow cares of this world and if we're not careful we'll be so weighed down with the cares of life to where we don't see any way out and it's in these moments of weakness where the devil will come in and will place things within your life he'll bring up memories things that you thought you forgotten he'll bring it up in these moments of weakness in your moments of pain your moments of hurting he'll Place resentment he'll Place bitterness let me tell say something bitterness is a poison resentment is a poison not only does it affect you but it poisons those that you talk to it can poison your spouse it can poison your brother your sister your F your family church members bitterness resentment can utterly destroy you see brother brother Kobi how do you know this because I have been there I face bitterness I've seen things that happen in this church as a child you know dad never dad never told us anything he always kept it to himself but as a kid you see things that take place things that transpire and as a young man I had bitterness against people that I didn't even know why I had bitterness against I just seen things that happen because people like I said hurt people hurt people and who is the number one person that is attacked first in a church the pastor and as a pastor's son you get to see a lot of fun things you get to see the good side of it you get to see the bad side of it the older I got I got to see more of the bad side and I had a lot of bitterness that I placed within my own life bitterness will what destroy you hurt people what hurt people hurt people and I had to come to a place to where I had to quit giving power over to that Spirit of bitterness you have the power within your heart to release bitterness but the the more you feed it the more it grows and it grows it's like a weed in a garden I found out I found out from brother Dave Morris about six years ago that you don't cut off a weed at the ground brother Merl what do you do you pull it up well I was talking about a garden about weeds and I told him yeah what you do is you go in there you cut it down well he got up there corrected me and said no no no no you don't cut it you don't cut it down at the ground you pull it up by the roots and a lot of times we deal with situations within our life and we cut it off at the ground thinking it's okay because once you cut it off at the ground you don't see it anymore but what takes place when you cut it off it begins to grow it begins to grow it begins to grow so you got to take that situation that root of bitterness anxiety resentment whatever you're dealing with and you got to pluck it up by the roots and say Lord I've had enough of this perform surgery Upon This Heart Romans 12:2 says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God that phrase but be transformed by the renewing of your mind we can we can we can say it this way but be transformed by replacing the old data on your mind's hard drive taking everything out of here how do you take something bad out out of your life you replace it with something good is that all right you want to get rid of junk food you got to replace with something good you want to get rid of bad memories you got to replace with something good brother Colby how do you allow that in your life by taking out the junk that you watch the junk that you listen to the junk that you read and you put the word of God in its place and you allow God to begin to perform surgery Upon Your Heart by using his word you realize that we can let Spirits continue on in our life by allowing movies that we watch and things that we read and things that we listen to can allow that Spirit to stay in powered within our life you want to destroy the power of the enemy in your life put something clean in your life put the word of God in its place instead of the magazines listen to brother brandom instead of the filthy music and watch God begin to transform your life right here right here I'm GNA can skip over some of this stuff we need to let God start the healing process today it doesn't matter who we are it doesn't matter where you've been it doesn't matter the scar it doesn't matter the sin it doesn't matter how far you have fallen somewhere along the way there's healing today you can heal your broken hearts your bitter memories your damaged self Ste you can you can have it healed today you can have it heal today want to say I was born in in a good family I had a good mom and Dad we did but as a child I faced a rejection complex I my personality I want to be accepted as a the first born I wanted to be accepted I didn't like the feeling of letting my father down and I face that as a kid I heard at a young age I ran to addictions to help my life ran to Aras as a nine-year-old boy to make myself feel safe because I didn't feel loved even though I was loved I was loved but as a young man I didn't feel loved me what I was facing in my life and when I got married because I didn't feel loved I didn't know how to love and I've cost a a lot of pain and hurt in her life and every time I would try to open myself up to love I would make a mistake and then run deeper and deeper to the areas that I felt safe cost a lot of pain I didn't know how to love my wife I didn't know how to love my children I was afraid of hurting them I was afraid of getting too close and things happening because of the safe areas and my addictions that I had I was afraid of opening up just to hurt them not realizing me staying closed did hurt them I didn't understand why I couldn't break through the addiction I couldn't understand why I couldn't break through the the fence mechanisms the walls that I had built up to not cause the pain anymore and then I realized a few years back something hit and I realized that it was something as a child that took place in my life that I have never never let go of I struggled in my Ministry I struggled with a complex that I wasn't good enough that I could never be good enough that my father didn't love me even though he did I got the best of parents here but as a child scarred as a child reflected my every area as an adult and I had to address the situation I remember dad probably knows we dealt with this about three years ago and realizing that he didn't know he didn't know you know what's crazy is the person that has hurt you or you think they've hurt you does doesn't have a clue that it happened hello there's areas they think they think it's over and they think it's done they didn't realize that they've hurt you and you hold on to things not realizing that it's a trick of the enemy to prevent you from living to your full potential as my wife and daughter come now the musicians can come as well but they're going to be singing aong song for us tonight I'm going to read this story and it's a little lengthy but bear with me I I pray this has been okay but I'll read this story it says Rico balanced the ceramic Bowl in her tiny hands as she carried it to the kitchen it was her mother's favorite a white bowl with tiny blo blossoms painstakingly painted up the sides her mother only brought it out on the most special occasions along with the gold platter her father had created Rico loved to run her fingers over the slightly worn edges as she listened to the stories about their family in Japan dreaming of all the hands through which this bowl had passed her favorite story was there when God restored her family after they after they had been separated during the war their Joy at being reunited after being so broken hearted was tangible even to her today was her mother's birthday which Rico thought qualified as a special occasion the 5-year-old girl had climbed the cabinets and brought out the dish all on her own she couldn't wait to fill it with her mother's favorite treats and present it to her Rico's foot caught on the edge of the kitchen rug and she stumbled the floral Bowl slipped from her fingers and crashed against the tile floor the bowl laid in shards at her feet Rico sank to her knees gingerly picking up a brokenhearted shaped piece she be to cry a warm hand rested on her shoulder blurry through the tears Rico saw her grandfather's wrinkle face and kind eyes staring down at her I try to be careful she sobbed I just wanted to do something special for Mama's birthday now it's broken and I can't fix it no her grandfather's voice soothed her but I know someone who can here help me pick up the pieces Rico and her grandfather set each piece on a tray and carry them out to the garage where her father worked on a project her Pace her face ped with fear worrying that her father would be upset that she had broken her mother's favorite Bowl instead he smiled at her and wrapped his daughter in a hug and he picked up the broken pieces and examined them he says what have we here I broke Mama's bow rle explained with a Qui over in her lip well then her father spoke rolling up his sleeves we fix it but it won't be the same as it was before it'll be even better Rico watched and wander as her father a talented artist mixed a gold lacquer with a few scoops of rice flour to make an adhesive he placed the broken shards of the bow together with the glue she watched in amazement as The Bull took shape gold gleaming from the cracks her father had been right somehow it was more beautiful than it had ever been in the first place this technique is called Kint Sugi in Japan her father explained as he worked it is believed that when broken items are repaired with gold or silver like this that the flaw becomes a unique piece of the object's history and the uniqueness adds to his Beauty but papa there's a missing piece her fingers traced an empty hole where a heart-shaped Shard was missing can kits Su Guai fix that that's all right I'll make a new one he crafted a gold heart from the dust and filled the space until they [Music] glowed I've never seen something so beautiful Rico exclaimed as her fingers clasped over over her own heart but but will Mama still be mad her grandfather who had been watching from a nearby sto shook his head there will be things in our life that will break no matter how careful we are just like this ball but it doesn't mean they can't be fixed what was once broken can become something beautiful listen listen to this [Music] song healer healer of my heart you are

could do surgery on our hearts he can take those things amen and he can bring that Grace you know we're every one of us as Mortals were born with imperfections it's just all there is to it and we're so easy to be scarred and we're so easy it's easy [Music] to not be able to see things from another person's perspective even and understand from a from that other person's perspective and sometimes we can we can cast our own opinions and our own thoughts the way we see things and not totally understand where someone else is coming from and I think that in in all of our Lives the same Grace that God's given us and because if we really want to truly be honest the we don't quite all of us but we can say that we not a person in this building that quite lines up with God's expectation for us and and I think that there that's that's why love I I seen the deal that was playing before church here old on the projector in and dealing with love in one of those quotes and and the love that God gave and reaching out to me then Lord let me have that same love and reach out to my other brother to my sister to to those around me [Music] because when you look at the you can have gifts and talents you can have you can um and as brother Kobe was sharing his testimony here tonight talented musician wonderful singer I [Music] mean the things that Kobe's had going for him in his life is just just incredible he's just he's gifted but how Satan can build a complex and and try to and and and you might look and think wow everything is is is just beautiful I wish I could have that I wish I had that personality wish I had this I wish I wish and yet Satan can come in and and through complexes and and so it's not it's not how many gifts we have it's not where we fit in in in in the status what we need is to understand that God understands us right where we are and that God has made us exactly the way he wants us God's made you exactly the way he wants you God built brother Kobe exactly the way he wants him God built brother Michael exactly the way he wants see God made brother Merl brother Joe God's made us Caleb he's made us all but yet if we're not careful Satan will come in and we'll develop things and complexes and we'll do this and we'll do those as our brother was saying tonight but I think there's a divine grace upon us all down inside the dirt down inside the dessert the dirt is the maker of our soul the one who loves us the one who will never throw away that that God Treasures God Treasures that person that you are are here tonight he Treasures you he Treasures every one of you kids amen he Treasures you Treasures you brother Luke Treasures you for who you are what a masterpiece Treasures you L what a masterpiece aren't you glad for that oh I'm glad to have have my part glad to have it I remember calling Mom one time and telling her if I could just I was crying Sean he could teach and Sean just had it all together he could sit and study and me I was so scatterbrained and and when he lived in Oklahoma I mean you'd go over to his house and then have all these all these books this this before the days of the of of the computers and he' have all these books and the highlighters and he's just sitting there and I look at his technique and I'm looking at me and I think H and I'm I go home and I sit down and try my best I called Mom and I said Sean's just got it all he he can do it all mom started laughing she said you know Sean just talked to me the other day and said if I could just be like Wendell Wendell Wendell he's just the preacher and I said he did not he said yeah he did he just called me and told me if I could just be like wend his gift and boy he can love the way he can do this and that he can interact he's just I don't have that I just feel like I and I thought oh God God's made us all different God's given us all gifts God loves every one of us so when we judge ourselves we judge ourselves according to him by no one else around us cuz he's the one that's making something beautiful out of our Lives aren't you glad for that did you enjoy the word of the Lord here tonight I fairly enjoyed the word of the Lord and I just want the church to know that this Daddy has always been proud of his oldest son I've always always loved and admired Kobe and I've appreciated him I do I I I just so much appreciate brother kobby you know I appreciate I I I he and Mary have become such pillars in our in our church and in the music and and the gifts that they have brought we wouldn't be who we are today if it wasn't for brother Kobe and Sister Mary that's just the truth and I I you never have to worry about brother Kobe and sister married they've always been dependable they're always right there wanting to see the work of the Lord go forward and I just I can't say enough I couldn't say enough of what I I think about brother Kobe and Sister Mary and and the gifts that they have and the abundance of awards and rewards that await on the other side for this for for these this man and woman of God and how many loves brother Kobe and Sister Mary [Applause] and with all my heart with all my heart I loved him and you say some as I as I talk to parents today and I that's one thing that I always go back to listen make sure make sure that your child understands that you love them and make sure don't take that for granted don't take those things for granted because I think that it is a it is a very it's it's of utmost important to knock out those Devils right now when the devil is trying to build a wedge or trying to do something in someone's life can you say amen and children should be open with their parents and their amen and and and the grace of God always flowing and that's that's something that we're so thankful for and I say today it's it's good for you you children that have had your parents raised up in the message to to be able to to be able to appreciate that that that consistency can you say Amen to that amen and so amen we're just so thankful I I appreciate the word of the Lord tonight I I I appreciate I think I think a message like this tonight and the testimony that brother Kobe gave I think it was very needed and very much a blessing to so many of us and I there's that song that I have a father amen I have a father he calls me is [Music] own your never leave me no matter where I
