[45:56] a struggle of course brother Tim Jes had
[45:58] passed away and then the co had left uh
[46:02] uh sister Joanna with uh just really
[46:05] damaged kidneys and and things and so um
[46:10] and we you know uh I was sort of given
[46:15] the responsibility of um and and the
[46:18] privilege of of guiding the church a
[46:22] little bit and helping them through that
[46:24] through that those Stormy Waters and and
[46:27] brother black uh was one that that stood
[46:32] up stood with us and and said I'll help
[46:35] in any way that I can over there in no
[46:39] and um uh he and his family come and
[46:42] preached over
[46:44] there uh uh weekend after weekend and
[46:49] and I appreciated brother black for and
[46:52] his family for
[46:54] giving
[46:56] uh all that that they had to to help the
[47:01] uh the church there and and uh being
[47:04] willing to to help guide them through
[47:07] and and I appreciated that in in brother
[47:09] black he has he has a Ministry of that
[47:13] that is um that is very an encouraging
[47:17] Ministry and so we've been wanting to
[47:19] get brother black back over this way for
[47:22] uh well for some time and so uh um we're
[47:26] we're thankful that brother black is was
[47:29] was able to come and be a part of our uh
[47:34] our fellowship today and also to
[47:36] minister the word uh to us here this
[47:39] morning so I just feel like we're just
[47:41] really uh we're just really blessed
[47:44] amen and um and we are looking forward
[47:48] to the uh to our fall
[47:50] fellowship and uh looking forward to
[47:53] what God uh has in store for us now you
[47:57] know there's there's some that um and
[48:01] rightfully so that that that feel that
[48:04] maybe we shouldn't have um these kind of
[48:07] fellowships on a
[48:09] Sunday and I know a lot of people who
[48:12] dismissed their services and and put um
[48:16] and and put Games and Things ahead of
[48:20] God and
[48:22] um but you know I I I will want us to
[48:26] have church here this morning and and I
[48:29] I I want us to to enjoy ourselves and I
[48:33] want us to enjoy our our service around
[48:35] the bonfire
[48:36] tonight and
[48:39] um but we're we're we're thankful also
[48:42] for our kids and sometimes we do the
[48:44] youth camps and uh it's for the 13 years
[48:47] and older and so we've wanted to do a
[48:50] little bit of something that we could do
[48:52] for the uh for our young for all ages
[48:55] and and um uh where where the young ones
[48:58] could still have fun and the old ones
[49:00] have fun and well and and us adults to
[49:03] be able to enjoy ourselves in Fellowship
[49:05] as
[49:06] well and um uh I see this no different
[49:11] as as boys out uh in the parking lot of
[49:15] of of the Bram Tabernacle in between the
[49:17] services they would have their service
[49:19] at 10:00 in the morning come out and
[49:21] then go back at 7:00 that evening and in
[49:24] between time the boys would be throwing
[49:27] balls and and keeping themselves active
[49:31] and and um I I think that here this this
[49:36] afternoon being able to Fellowship
[49:39] around the one another's company and um
[49:43] and the different ones that will that
[49:45] may be coming in and fellowshipping with
[49:47] us I I just I just like for it to just
[49:50] be a one wonderful day just a just a
[49:53] glorious day to where we can uh just in
[49:59] in encourage our Youngs and they love
[50:02] bonfires and and I like bonfires too
[50:06] amen and um and so uh the good thing is
[50:10] is a lot of these these young ons
[50:12] especially these boys they've been out
[50:14] every almost every day of this this last
[50:17] week uh helping getting things set up
[50:20] and uh uh they'd get out there in the
[50:22] morning times and work until it's dark
[50:25] and so we we appreciate all of the
[50:27] Brotherhood among among our our young
[50:30] ones that uh helped us to uh to build
[50:35] the slide and to and to to build you
[50:38] know just I we we appreciate it and um
[50:43] uh so uh I think it's brother Merl that
[50:46] said this kind of a thing doesn't
[50:48] doesn't just doesn't just happen there's
[50:50] a lot of work that goes into that and uh
[50:54] uh so we and we appreciate the these
[50:58] these kids for jumping out in and and
[51:01] also appreciate the ones who came out
[51:04] and was just so willing to give of their
[51:06] heart and say I I want to put my my
[51:09] shoulder to the will I've got a I've got
[51:11] kids too and and uh I I want to I want
[51:15] to be a part of the blessing I think
[51:17] we're blessed I I I I I think we're
[51:19] blessed with young people I think we're
[51:22] blessed with leadership who who love
[51:25] young people and amen and that is
[51:29] investing into the Next Generation Now
[51:32] the older we get we don't really uh the
[51:36] older I get amen and losing the energy
[51:39] and and um uh I could find a lot better
[51:43] things to be doing with my evening times
[51:46] than to be coming down and helping um
[51:49] these youngans amen but when you know
[51:52] that you are investing into this this
[51:55] next
[51:56] Generation it it it it's it's wonderful
[52:00] because you want these kids to receive

[52:37] a Preachers Wives amen and and you say

[52:52] natural element to it and for me to want

[52:57] there were Elders in my life amen that

[58:30] me where they were before I got them
[58:32] that's where they're
[58:33] at you know I've often wondered does
[58:35] that mean our theophany on the other
[58:37] side's bald and every time one hair goes
[58:38] he gets one hair you know I'm not sure
[58:40] how that worked exactly but you know I
[58:42] know when we get on that other side
[58:43] brother we're going to be perfect we're
[58:44] going to no more ailments there no more
[58:47] pains there and I'm looking forward to
[58:49] that I'm looking for a time because you
[58:50] know you want to serve the Lord in the

[59:00] meeting on that one and I'm looking
[59:01] forward to that amen praise the Lord I
[59:05] want to me you on a little thought of
[59:06] take it back and uh go to St Matthew
[59:09] chapter 18: 10 through
[59:12] 14 take it back you know I believe God's
[59:15] given us promises in this word and I
[59:17] believe that he will give it to you but
[59:18] you got to be willing to go take it back
[59:20] from the devil you know the devil will
[59:22] take as much as you'll give him it's
[59:24] like having an employer uh when you work
[59:26] in employ an employer and you employers
[59:28] forgive me but if you have an employer
[59:31] sometimes they will take as much as you
[59:32] give yeah but they won't give you
[59:34] nothing back you know as much as you
[59:36] give listen give me a little more give
[59:38] me a little more and I made a joke to
[59:40] our dealership manager because it showed
[59:41] this man sit standing in front of a car
[59:43] a fancy expensive car and he says if you
[59:45] work hard you work long hours you give
[59:48] up everything that you've got I'll buy
[59:50] an extra another one next year you know
[59:53] in the world there's things like there
[59:54] where you can invest all you can and and
[59:57] you know they'll they'll take as much as
[59:59] you can give well with God God will give
[1:00:02] you the more you can give to God the
[1:00:04] more God will give back to you and in
[1:00:07] this service you will get exactly what
[1:00:08] you put into it you come expecting to
[1:00:10] see God come and speak God will come on
[1:00:12] the scene for you amen uh let's go to St
[1:00:15] Matthew chap 18:
[1:00:18] 10-4 it says take heed that you despise
[1:00:20] not one of these little ones for I say
[1:00:23] unto you that In Heaven There Angels do
[1:00:25] always behold the face of My Father
[1:00:27] which is in heaven for the son of man is
[1:00:30] come to save that which was lost how
[1:00:33] think ye if a man have a hundred sheep
[1:00:35] and one of them gun astray does not he
[1:00:37] leave the 90 and9 and goeth into the
[1:00:40] mountains and seeketh that which has
[1:00:41] gone astray and if so be that he find it
[1:00:44] verily I say unto you he rejoiceth more
[1:00:47] for that sheep than of the 99 which went
[1:00:49] not astray even so it is not the will of
[1:00:53] your father which is in heaven that one
[1:00:55] of these little ones should perish and
[1:00:57] we'll go to one more scripture in
[1:00:59] Ephesians chap 1 and Verses 4 just one
[1:01:02] scripture
[1:01:04] there says according as he has chosen Us
[1:01:07] in him before the foundation of the
[1:01:09] world that we should be holy and Without
[1:01:12] Blame before him in love let's go to the
[1:01:15] Lord in prayer heavenly father I I
[1:01:17] humble myself before you this morning
[1:01:19] and Lord I ask you that you would just
[1:01:21] use this yielded vessel this morning
[1:01:23] that you could speak to hearts Lord Lord
[1:01:25] we are here to Worship You Lord Lord I
[1:01:27] ask you to come and speak to us in Jesus
[1:01:29] name amen God bless you you can be
[1:01:32] seated I think I'm gonna move this thing
[1:01:33] up here that might
[1:01:36] help let me assure you this morning that
[1:01:39] the Lord is it's not his will that
[1:01:41] anyone would perish the Lord has got a
[1:01:44] perfect will for our life and the enemy
[1:01:46] will do his best to steal away your
[1:01:48] confidence because you know it don't
[1:01:50] matter what you're doing if the Lord can
[1:01:52] take your confidence away from you and
[1:01:54] what you're doing you will not be
[1:01:56] successful it's a job no matter what it
[1:01:58] is how simple it is you if you're
[1:02:00] constantly doubting yourself because you
[1:02:03] take somebody that has confidence in
[1:02:05] what they're doing they'll be the best
[1:02:07] that they could possibly be at that so
[1:02:09] always remember the devil will try to
[1:02:11] take away your confidence you know when
[1:02:13] I've talked to salesmen I I've helped
[1:02:15] helped salesmen to to see how the road
[1:02:18] to sell and how to sell vehicles and how
[1:02:20] to do certain things and I've heard a
[1:02:22] lot of people say you can't be a
[1:02:23] Christian and be car salesman but I have
[1:02:25] proven that to be wrong you can do that
[1:02:28] and you can be a Christian you can do
[1:02:30] that with Integrity because you know
[1:02:32] what I'll tell you somebody that that
[1:02:33] that's that that's a robber that's
[1:02:35] somebody that works on the clock and
[1:02:36] you'll hide and not do your job not do
[1:02:38] the best you can you are a robber
[1:02:40] because you're not doing the best the
[1:02:42] scripture says do all that you do
[1:02:44] heartedly as doing it for the Lord and
[1:02:46] not for man you know we we should be the
[1:02:49] best of the best at everything that we
[1:02:51] do if you're sweeping the floor you
[1:02:53] should do that in the name of the Lord
[1:02:55] in such a way that God could bless that
[1:02:57] you know and so the Lord has shown me on
[1:02:59] how to help salesmen and I don't see
[1:03:02] their confidence is gone they've lost
[1:03:04] their confidence and what it is whenever
[1:03:06] you have a product and you're presenting
[1:03:09] that product to somebody you want to PR
[1:03:11] to present it in such a way they realize
[1:03:15] this thing I can't do without this
[1:03:17] product is so good I can't do without
[1:03:20] this thing and brother and sister the
[1:03:22] gospel is so good it's got to be
[1:03:24] presented in such a way that said I've
[1:03:27] got to have that but you know somebody
[1:03:29] can lose their confidence in it they can
[1:03:32] lose that steill in it the product's not
[1:03:34] wrong the the person has lost their
[1:03:37] confidence and you know we got to have
[1:03:39] confidence in what God's given us do you
[1:03:42] believe that you've got to have
[1:03:44] confidence in what it is because the
[1:03:45] devil he can't tell you it's wrong he
[1:03:47] won't tell you the message is wrong
[1:03:49] he'll lose your confidence for you that
[1:03:52] you can receive those promises and
[1:03:53] that's where you've got to take it back
[1:03:55] you know each of us has got an
[1:03:57] identity and it's an identity that God
[1:04:00] has called us to and the identity of who
[1:04:02] you are is who God says you are but the
[1:04:05] devil will try his hardest to make you
[1:04:07] present a different life to where you
[1:04:09] are manifesting something different and
[1:04:11] then after you leave a a a the presence
[1:04:14] of some people and maybe you said
[1:04:17] something you just didn't mean to say
[1:04:20] and then you say God forgive me I did
[1:04:22] not mean to say that and you will beat
[1:04:24] yourself to pieces I want slow down just
[1:04:27] catch this for just a moment the devil
[1:04:30] will try so hard because you'll you'll
[1:04:32] see your brother or your sister maybe
[1:04:34] they say a certain thing a wrong way he
[1:04:36] will try to cause you where you see
[1:04:38] their identity of something else on you
[1:04:41] know what that brother ain't quite what
[1:04:42] I thought he was that sister ain't quite
[1:04:44] what I thought they was because you know
[1:04:46] what they fail you know brother B says
[1:04:48] you can kill a man by speaking against
[1:04:50] him because you kill his influence
[1:04:52] that's right this right here brother and
[1:04:54] sister is the greatest weapon that we
[1:04:56] have in this life is because it's our
[1:04:58] words and the way we talk about one
[1:05:00] another so let not just St not just
[1:05:03] grabbing your identity of who you are
[1:05:05] but the identity of who your brother and
[1:05:08] sister is because you know many times as
[1:05:10] I'm saying you're fighting this F
[1:05:12] because you're you've got to go you want
[1:05:14] to become what this word says you are
[1:05:16] but we are fighting a devil and he will
[1:05:20] come to try to divide and conquer and
[1:05:23] cause you to look at your brother in a
[1:05:25] way that he he he may look at himself do
[1:05:28] you realize you can nobody can ever
[1:05:30] criticize you like you all right you
[1:05:33] know the real
[1:05:34] you we know the real us when we look in
[1:05:37] that mirror and we see who we are we say
[1:05:39] God thank you for your grace thank you
[1:05:41] for your mercy because you know what
[1:05:43] it's a daily walk while we're saying God
[1:05:45] I can't even walk without you holding my
[1:05:47] hand I need your mercy in my life so how
[1:05:51] in the world can somebody ever look that
[1:05:53] down on on somebody else come on brother
[1:05:56] and sister we've been given the greatest
[1:05:57] thing in this life of the message of the
[1:05:59] hour but the greatest that is something
[1:06:00] that was here before even the message
[1:06:02] got here it's the Holy
[1:06:04] Spirit Well we will have that Holy
[1:06:06] Spirit on the inside of us brother and
[1:06:08] that spirit inside of you is what makes
[1:06:10] you who you are you take a dog you know
[1:06:13] how you know he's a dog because he acts
[1:06:15] like a dog and that means he's got a
[1:06:17] life of a dog inside of him he wags his
[1:06:19] tail he sticks his tongue out he does
[1:06:21] all kinds of stuff that dogs do because
[1:06:23] he's a dog he's got the life of a dog in
[1:06:25] him that's the evidence of it you don't
[1:06:27] have to go up there with the stethoscope
[1:06:28] and stick your your your your
[1:06:30] stethoscope in your ear and say I wonder
[1:06:31] if this guy's alive all right you just
[1:06:34] let a cat out the
[1:06:36] door the Instinct just comes right out
[1:06:38] of him amen this precious dog that would
[1:06:41] never hurt a fly let a cat out there oh
[1:06:44] yeah you know what I'm talking about
[1:06:46] brother and sister that's the way it is
[1:06:48] with a Christian it should not be that
[1:06:50] somebody has to put the stethoscope on
[1:06:51] you to see if you're a Christian or not
[1:06:54] there should be something inside of you
[1:06:56] that is pulsing I'm talking about a love
[1:06:58] brother Brenham talked about that spring
[1:07:00] and he saw that spring just up bubbling
[1:07:02] and just a bubbling and just a bubbling
[1:07:04] said what is it that makes you what is
[1:07:06] it that makes you bubble it's because
[1:07:08] the deer drink from you the rabbit drink
[1:07:10] no not them is it because I drink from
[1:07:12] you no what is it something inside me
[1:07:15] just makes me Bubble brother and sister
[1:07:17] I'm here to tell you I've been serving
[1:07:19] the lord since I was 19 years old don't
[1:07:20] tell me that's something that just
[1:07:22] enthusiasm that wears down 19 years
[1:07:25] later or 20 21 years later I'm getting
[1:07:27] older 21 years
[1:07:30] later that thing still bubbling on the
[1:07:32] inside of me to where you can have this
[1:07:35] you know I've thought many times have
[1:07:37] have a little Eagle sitting inside of a
[1:07:40] shell and he would hear the noise of
[1:07:42] wings flapping on the outside and he
[1:07:45] would hear a Revival on the outside of
[1:07:48] his shell he would hear the flapping of
[1:07:50] the Wings he would hear the screams of
[1:07:52] all these things and that little eagler
[1:07:55] sitting inside this shell and he's
[1:07:57] wondering what's it like out there I
[1:08:00] hear that there's a Revival out there I
[1:08:02] hear that somebody can have that
[1:08:04] unexhausted Fountain inside of them that
[1:08:07] will Bobble on the inside what's it like
[1:08:09] because I am trapped inside this shell
[1:08:12] and I'm trying so hard I want Revival

[1:08:34] think about is god brother and sister

[1:08:39] you serve god with this right here
[1:08:41] you'll be up and down up and down up and
[1:08:43] down up and down you'll go around the
[1:08:45] circle round the circle round the circle

[1:09:20] know what we as the Bride of Jesus
[1:09:21] Christ Our Life should be everywhere we
[1:09:24] go but we are walking on that rock we're
[1:09:28] standing on that rock no matter who we
[1:09:30] interact with they should about to say I
[1:09:32] want that I want that I may not agree
[1:09:36] with what they say I may not agree with
[1:09:38] how they dress I may not agree about how
[1:09:41] they wear their hair but I'm going to
[1:09:42] tell you that's the spirit of Christ cuz
[1:09:45] I'm tell what your spirit is the
[1:09:47] greatest gospel you'll ever have you can
[1:09:50] quote the quotes all you want to but if

[1:09:54] you're bitter I all you are that's right
[1:09:56] and that's the saddest thing to see is
[1:09:57] people that will have this message and
[1:09:59] they're the most bitter people you ever
[1:10:00] talk to but here tell brother B said you
[1:10:03] ever notice there some people you just
[1:10:04] can't stand to be around like you just
[1:10:06] feel nervous it's the atmosphere like

[1:10:09] right but you get around other brothers
[1:10:11] yeah get around other sisters and
[1:10:13] there's just a love you love to be
[1:10:16] around them what is it it's the
[1:10:19] atmosphere brother and sister our spirit
[1:10:21] that we have brother said I would rather

[1:10:25] right Spirit then to have the right
[1:10:28] Doctrine and you got the wrong Spirit

[1:10:47] tire this morning okay the greatest
[1:10:50] thing you could ever have brother and
[1:10:51] sister is the way you treat people
[1:10:55] people do not care how much you know
[1:10:57] until they know how much you
[1:10:59] care that's
[1:11:02] right yes sir our life we can have such
[1:11:05] a spirit on us brother and sister
[1:11:07] because there is a dying world out there
[1:11:09] families are broken and they don't know
[1:11:12] what to do there's fathers out there
[1:11:14] there's mothers out there they got all
[1:11:16] these bills they got to pay and I don't

[1:11:24] weak they're scared they're they're
[1:11:26] scattered yeah and they don't know what
[1:11:29] to
[1:11:29] do but we know what to
[1:11:32] do brother and sister you are the gospel
[1:11:36] it's not a oneman Ministry anymore this
[1:11:38] is a many membered body where the life
[1:11:41] that you're living where you are walking
[1:11:43] in the spirit you are walking in the
[1:11:45] grace brother and sister where you can
[1:11:46] bring peace to someone's
[1:11:48] home amen that's the greatest I would
[1:11:50] rather have that than restoring a leg or
[1:11:52] something
[1:11:55] amen the devil will try to take your
[1:11:57] confidence away he'll try to take it
[1:12:00] away and you know what we are not a
[1:12:01] cookie stamp church and I thank God for
[1:12:04] that is there some water up here brother
[1:12:06] oh it's right here I see it I should
[1:12:07] have put my glasses on
[1:12:10] huh I think I need some stronger
[1:12:12] ones but you know what we are we were on
[1:12:15] a battlefield yeah and on this
[1:12:17] battlefield that we're on right now you
[1:12:19] get Battle
[1:12:21] Scars yes sir and you know when you're
[1:12:22] in the heat of the battle there's
[1:12:24] sometimes you don't know what to do okay
[1:12:27] there's sometimes you got to make a
[1:12:28] decision and maybe nobody else agrees
[1:12:30] with what your decision is but you got
[1:12:33] to make the right decision because you
[1:12:34] know what you've got to be the one that
[1:12:36] lives with
[1:12:37] it we God will honor your decision of
[1:12:40] what you take and what I Take God will
[1:12:42] honor that and that's why it's so so
[1:12:45] important that we are led by the spirit
[1:12:48] because you know what a lot of the
[1:12:49] bondages that we can put ourselves we
[1:12:51] find ourselves under we say that devil
[1:12:53] put me under this bondage but a lot of
[1:12:54] times it's our own decisions that got us
[1:12:56] where we're
[1:12:56] at brother and sister we got to take
[1:12:59] some accountability you know you get a
[1:13:01] lot of credit card debts said that devil
[1:13:03] put me in all this credit card
[1:13:04] debt that old devil was the devil that
[1:13:08] pulled that wallet that card out of your
[1:13:09] wallet and swipe it or was it you that
[1:13:12] did that come on somebody we got a hat
[1:13:16] rack out there we'll go put our Halos
[1:13:18] out there and put them out there and we
[1:13:19] we'll pick them up after service but you
[1:13:21] know what it's our own decision
[1:13:24] God is a good provider God will meet
[1:13:26] your needs God will give you everything
[1:13:28] that you have need of but I believe we
[1:13:29] must be a good Steward over what God has
[1:13:32] given us and whenever you are a good
[1:13:34] Steward of what God is God is faithful
[1:13:37] that he will meet those need it may be
[1:13:39] right on the due date but God will give
[1:13:40] you the money to get it paid amen I
[1:13:43] don't believe that the shin out woman
[1:13:46] was was was drawn in credit card debt to
[1:13:49] the point where she said I just got to
[1:13:50] buy that newest skirt I just got to get
[1:13:52] that and then I'm so poor now I've got
[1:13:54] me my son's going to starve to death and
[1:13:56] we're going to eat our last meal I'm
[1:13:57] sorry I don't think it was that way I
[1:13:59] believe that was and she's waiting on
[1:14:00] the the Shak glory to come I know it may
[1:14:02] sound funny but brother and sister we
[1:14:03] find ourselves a lot of times we put
[1:14:05] ourselves in those situations then we
[1:14:07] say oh God deliver me now you know what
[1:14:09] we got to take some mature
[1:14:11] accountability to we're saying Lord help
[1:14:14] me to do this mature ride help me be a
[1:14:16] mature Christian help me to grow up in
[1:14:18] this thing and be someone that you can
[1:14:20] count on God I believe that sh out woman
[1:14:22] was doing the best she could do with
[1:14:24] what she had and God let her go to a
[1:14:26] point where she said I don't feel God I
[1:14:28] don't see God I'm paying my ti I'm
[1:14:30] giving the offering a little bit that I
[1:14:32] have I'm doing everything that I know to
[1:14:34] possibly do and I don't know what to do
[1:14:37] this woman saw her son
[1:14:39] dying this woman saw her son that was so
[1:14:42] weak day by day by day getting weaker
[1:14:45] and weaker and weaker and weaker and
[1:14:47] she's saiding but I'm holding on to a
[1:14:49] promise that we've got a word here that
[1:14:51] says God is faithful he is is Jehovah
[1:14:53] jyra he is a God he is Jehovah Rafa he
[1:14:57] is Jehovah sha she didn't have all the
[1:14:59] quotes all she had was just that little
[1:15:00] bit of word and she was holding on to
[1:15:02] that promise and little by little
[1:15:05] watching her child die how easily could
[1:15:07] she should have just let down the bars
[1:15:08] and say I'll just go with the world how
[1:15:09] easily would have been her and say you
[1:15:11] know what there's nothing to this
[1:15:12] message but something inside her says
[1:15:15] I'm staying with this word my finances
[1:15:18] may be tight we're dealing with
[1:15:20] starvation right now we're doing all
[1:15:21] these things but I'm staying with with
[1:15:23] this word and here it come one day one
[1:15:25] cool morning may she what even expect it
[1:15:27] here come a prophet of God and I want to
[1:15:29] catch someone stop you this is not even
[1:15:30] on my nose by way this Prophet if you
[1:15:33] look at the scriptures he says you go to
[1:15:35] this widow woman I have commanded her to
[1:15:38] sustain thee yeah if you were to go ask
[1:15:41] this widow woman has the Lord told you
[1:15:42] to sustain the prophet today I have no
[1:15:45] idea what you're talking about he ain't
[1:15:46] said nothing to me but what was it this
[1:15:49] woman had something inside her it was a
[1:15:51] respect to the word it was a respect to
[1:15:55] the presence and this woman was she felt
[1:15:57] alone she felt by herself she felt like
[1:16:00] you know what I don't know how I can do
[1:16:01] this but she was walking in what she
[1:16:04] knew and here it come a moment a
[1:16:06] visitation come across her way and she
[1:16:08] had respect that visitation and God
[1:16:11] honored go he said give me a cake how
[1:16:14] many knows the
[1:16:15] Scriptures it was a it was a visitation
[1:16:18] that God crossed her path and her
[1:16:20] attitude her respect to the presence of
[1:16:23] God in that moment God met her requests
[1:16:26] God met her needs there was a little
[1:16:28] woman that heard a prophet of God one
[1:16:30] time talking about the third pole and
[1:16:33] things that were taking place and
[1:16:34] something inside of her said it ain't
[1:16:37] nothing but the truth and because of her
[1:16:39] attitude toward the M of God he said ask
[1:16:43] what you will and it'll be done for you
[1:16:45] you asked for a million dollars right
[1:16:47] now it be right here but what did she
[1:16:49] say I want the salvation of my boys oh
[1:16:52] brethren and sister it is our respect to
[1:16:55] the move of God well you got to walk
[1:16:57] with the spirit it's not just in church

[1:28:13] anyone's ever seen before we're in this
[1:28:14] other side by side we're deep in the
[1:28:16] mountains and I go over this hill and we
[1:28:18] start going down this Valley and I saw
[1:28:20] trees that were cut and that were
[1:28:21] falling
[1:28:22] over and I felt The Voice come down to
[1:28:25] me and speak to me and said these trees
[1:28:26] weren't Born This
[1:28:28] Way chopped
[1:28:30] down something happened to them these
[1:28:33] little trees are deep inside these Woods
[1:28:36] here
[1:28:37] and something inside me said what if
[1:28:39] it's some just like a person just like a
[1:28:42] sheep that they're so deep inside there
[1:28:45] that nobody even knows what they're
[1:28:47] going through they're suffering they're
[1:28:49] wounded they're hurt and there's like no
[1:28:52] nobody hears me yeah nobody hears My Cry
[1:28:54] in these in these mountain and the lord
[1:28:56] gave me this scripture I not to read it
[1:28:58] with
[1:29:01] you it's in Matthew chap 9:
[1:29:06] 35-38 it says and Jesus went about all
[1:29:08] the cities and Villages teaching in
[1:29:10] their synagogues and preaching the
[1:29:11] gospel of the kingdom and healing every
[1:29:13] sickness and every disease among the
[1:29:15] people but when he saw the multitudes he
[1:29:18] was moved with compassion on them
[1:29:20] because they fainted and were scattered
[1:29:22] abroad as sheep having no Shepherd then
[1:29:25] said he unto his disciples the Harvest
[1:29:27] truly is plenteous but the labors are
[1:29:30] few pray ye therefore the lord of the
[1:29:32] Harvest that he will send forth labors
[1:29:34] into the
[1:29:35] Harvest this was a people that was
[1:29:38] scattered they were weak they were
[1:29:40] fainted and they were as if they didn't
[1:29:42] have a shepherd and they were so beat
[1:29:44] down and brother and sister my heart
[1:29:46] becomes so heavy of sin how many people
[1:29:48] do we pass every day that are just like
[1:29:51] this
[1:29:52] scripture where they're alone they need
[1:29:55] they need help brother and sister may we
[1:29:58] be that help in this hour you are the
[1:30:02] laborers I'm the labor brother wend you
[1:30:05] are the laborer help us Lord that we
[1:30:08] could be faithful laborers before the
[1:30:10] Lord to where our neighbors can see what
[1:30:13] we Rejoice about because it's so easy to
[1:30:16] put it on the preacher and say the
[1:30:18] preacher got to do the preaching but
[1:30:19] you're the one that does the preaching
[1:30:21] do you know that you are the Vindication
[1:30:23] that he's this man's preaching the right
[1:30:26] message
[1:30:29] how because he's preaching the word and
[1:30:32] you are taking that word and you're
[1:30:34] walking with it we are the Vindication
[1:30:37] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:30:40] today and forever Amen brother and
[1:30:42] sister in this hour it don't go anybody
[1:30:45] can jump and shout when things are going
[1:30:47] good yeah but it's whenever you are
[1:30:50] walking in the valley when you're
[1:30:52] walking by yourself and you say you know
[1:30:53] what I don't feel a thing but I know
[1:30:57] this message is true it's whenever you
[1:31:00] keep
[1:31:01] pushing
[1:31:03] amen I pray that I'm getting this over
[1:31:05] cross okay
[1:31:09] okay listen what brother R says he says
[1:31:11] did you know that God knew that we'd be
[1:31:13] standing here 10 million years before
[1:31:15] the world was ever founded did you know
[1:31:18] he knew we'd be standing here this
[1:31:20] morning then vinity of God knowed every
[1:31:23] fly every Gat every time they'd bat
[1:31:25] their eyes and how much Tallow that
[1:31:28] would produce before the world was ever
[1:31:29] form God knew it now you say well if he
[1:31:32] knows it then why are you preaching
[1:31:35] that's part of God's program preaching
[1:31:37] is his program when he looked upon the
[1:31:40] apostles he looked upon the Harvest he
[1:31:42] said the Harvest is r and the labors are
[1:31:45] few pray the Lord of the Harvest that he
[1:31:48] will send forth labors into his Harvest
[1:31:50] so many remember that well why would
[1:31:54] they have to pray to the Lord of harvest
[1:31:56] to send forth labors in the Harvest if
[1:31:58] the lord of the Harvest was standing
[1:31:59] there knowing it would be done why it's
[1:32:02] because God arranged it now listen God
[1:32:05] so arranged it that this program cannot
[1:32:08] move without you and I and as long as
[1:32:11] we're not doing what God leads us to do
[1:32:14] we're paralyzing his program but when
[1:32:17] the church moves by the anointing of the
[1:32:19] Holy Ghost then we're in the God's Will
[1:32:23] and then we're doing God's program
[1:32:25] brother and sister you can paralyze the
[1:32:28] move of God in your life because we have
[1:32:30] got to follow his Spirit whenever you
[1:32:32] are led by the spirit you are moving
[1:32:34] God's program how many of you believe
[1:32:36] you can be led by the spirit you can be
[1:32:38] led by the spirit not just this brother
[1:32:41] you can be led by the spirit where you
[1:32:42] hear that word that's what that

[1:33:41] our home should be consecrated to where
[1:33:43] that spirit that house is a spirit of a
[1:33:46] habitation of the spirit where God can
[1:33:48] come and dwell in that house but you've
[1:33:50] got to consecrate that that house to
[1:33:52] your to the Lord you have got to brother

[1:33:56] and where to I say conquer conquer the
[1:33:58] spirits that try to come against the
[1:34:00] home because he'll try to come against
[1:34:02] Mommy and Daddy he will try to cause
[1:34:05] arguments and divisions inside the home
[1:34:08] you know it breaks my heart brother wend
[1:34:10] when I hear around the message message
[1:34:12] families that bicker and fight all the
[1:34:15] time yeah but then in church oh praise
[1:34:18] God yeah I'm not saying don't praise the
[1:34:21] Lord brother I'm talking about that's
[1:34:23] why the real gospel meets the road is in
[1:34:26] your house when the doors are shut when
[1:34:29] it's you and you and God alone when you
[1:34:32] have the choice you can either pick up
[1:34:35] your phone and start looking at that
[1:34:36] filth or that nonsense or you can say I
[1:34:39] have the power to lay it down you know
[1:34:43] what we want miracles of seeing the the
[1:34:45] blind being restored and that people
[1:34:47] raiseed out a wheelchair I want to see
[1:34:48] people have the power where they lay the
[1:34:50] old l life down and the new life being
[1:34:54] taken up all right that's right brother
[1:34:56] and sister you know I hear talk
[1:34:58] sometimes around the meeting sometimes
[1:35:00] of not not you in particular I'm talking
[1:35:02] about but around people the one that
[1:35:04] will jump and Shout the most listen to
[1:35:06] how they talk after the
[1:35:08] meeting listen me brother and sister
[1:35:10] because that's where the rubber meets
[1:35:12] the road of the real you the real you
[1:35:15] and I you know brother R talked about
[1:35:17] one of the greatest confusions to me
[1:35:19] when I come to message I sure didn't
[1:35:20] understand how the world could a woman
[1:35:23] preach prophesy speak in tongues
[1:35:27] somebody come up there and that woman
[1:35:29] preacher pray for somebody and they be
[1:35:31] healed how in the world could that
[1:35:33] happen anybody ever see that they
[1:35:36] absolutely because God is Not
[1:35:38] vindicating that woman as being in her
[1:35:40] position rightful position God was
[1:35:43] honoring
[1:35:45] faith and the rain falls on the just and
[1:35:48] the
[1:35:49] unjust so don't think you're something
[1:35:51] because you're shouting and jumping when
[1:35:53] the holy spirit's going it's what you do
[1:35:55] with this right here cuz if you use this
[1:35:58] thing and you tear your brother and your
[1:35:59] sister down and you're talking gossip
[1:36:01] inside the church and you're talking bad
[1:36:02] about the pastor don't even begin to
[1:36:04] tell me how spiritual you are because
[1:36:07] you know what a man will speak from the
[1:36:09] abundance of his heart you get around
[1:36:11] somebody very long you will know what
[1:36:13] they've been thinking about because they
[1:36:14] will talk about it and they will begin
[1:36:16] to edify so you can be the greatest
[1:36:18] preacher on the Earth but if you're
[1:36:19] using this and you're tearing down your
[1:36:20] brother and your sister
[1:36:26] amen I believe you believe the same
[1:36:28] thing and I'm also say anybody else does
