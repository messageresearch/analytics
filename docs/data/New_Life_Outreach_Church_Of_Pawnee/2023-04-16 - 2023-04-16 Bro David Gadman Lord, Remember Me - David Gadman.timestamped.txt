[28:43] so they set me up with some other tests
[28:45] and stuff um
[28:48] this was happening during the week of

[29:07] presence of the Lord was so strong in
[29:09] the building and I could just I could
[29:11] just feel such a sweetness the power of
[29:14] the Lord and
[29:16] it was
[29:18] at the end of the service my cousin I
[29:21] had talked to her she was staying with
[29:22] me and we had been up late the night
[29:23] before and I just told her what the
[29:25] doctor had said and that I had to go
[29:26] through some tests and
[29:28] um
[29:31] she came up and she asked if she could
[29:33] pray for me she just felt led and she
[29:35] laid her hands on me and prayed and I
[29:38] knew that I was healed

[46:41] which were hanged railed on him saying
[46:43] if thou be the Christ
[46:45] save thyself in US
[46:48] but the other answering rebuked him
[46:50] saying that's not thou fear God
[46:53] seeing that thou art in the same
[46:55] condemnation and we indeed justly
[46:59] for we receive the due reward of our
[47:01] Deeds but this man hath done nothing to
[47:04] miss
[47:06] and he said unto Jesus Lord
[47:09] remember me when thou comest into thy
[47:11] kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I
[47:15] say unto thee today
[47:18] shalt thou be with me in Paradise may
[47:21] the Lord add His blessings to the
[47:23] reading of the word you may be seated

[47:31] it'd just simply be Lord
[47:33] remember me
[47:36] Lord remember me
[47:38] and just just before we get started here
[47:41] I was thinking you know just we've been
[47:43] just traveling kind of evangelizing and
[47:47] you know I pray like brother like
[47:48] brother uh Wendell was saying this
[47:50] morning you know it just ain't getting
[47:52] up going somewhere you know because hey
[47:54] we could stay at home
[47:56] I told Brother Dale I said hey you you
[47:58] glad you're you you uh glad you're off
[48:01] the Evangelistic field he said yes sir
[48:04] he said I got tartar living out of
[48:05] suitcases
[48:07] I said that's what we've been doing for
[48:08] about a month and a half
[48:10] I told my wife I said man I should have
[48:12] took that church in Michigan
[48:13] you know I said but but just where
[48:16] you're calling I mean whatever you're
[48:17] called to do amen I'm glad my wife she
[48:19] likes to go with me amen keep me out of
[48:22] trouble
[48:23] amen so she sat back there she's looking
[48:25] amen but I but we're in there in there
[48:28] and I said I sure I want to be dedicated
[48:31] amen I want to be prayed up it's not a
[48:34] game with me amen and I thought you know
[48:37] and so as we was going and then it we
[48:39] got to you know and as we was going
[48:41] along we spoke there and for brother
[48:44] Jeremy and and Amarillo and then we went
[48:47] on there to uh Flagstaff and seemed like
[48:49] sister Joanne uh brother Dale's wife
[48:52] said My Brother David you just don't
[48:53] know what you said today or tonight so
[48:56] man we just we've been
[48:58] what brother Dale's been uh preaching on
[49:00] and everything then we got to a place
[49:02] and preached a Friday night Saturday
[49:04] night and Sunday morning there at uh in
[49:06] Camp Verde and there's a sister that
[49:09] called my wife
[49:10] after we left there and she said you
[49:13] just don't know what Brother David
[49:14] preached on see we was praying and said
[49:17] I said my pastor said we was praying
[49:19] said we our church needed something
[49:23] needed to read I said I needed something
[49:25] she said you know how it is and it ain't
[49:27] that I'm not saved I said I'm saved and
[49:30] I love the Lord I love this message but
[49:32] it seemed like something she said I
[49:34] needed a breakthrough
[49:36] amen she said I was praying
[49:38] said I didn't know said I was praying
[49:40] said Lord help have my pastor invite
[49:43] somebody that'd help us amen said I
[49:46] didn't know it was you but I heard you
[49:47] was coming and it's like God this may be
[49:49] it he said Friday night is all right but
[49:51] it's that Saturday night she got her
[49:52] breakthrough I thought my God I didn't
[49:55] know nothing about that but I thank God
[49:57] that God's still in the saving business
[49:59] amen he's still in the Reviving business
[50:04] hallelujah hallelujah so Lord remember
[50:08] me
[50:09] let me read you a question and answer
[50:11] 1959 the prophet of God as we as we get
[50:14] into this all right he said therefore
[50:16] the question is
[50:19] that a man is saved
[50:21] I believe if he's looking towards
[50:23] Calvary
[50:24] we got to look towards Calvary we can't
[50:27] look anywhere else but we got to look
[50:28] toward Calvary
[50:30] amen because hey that that's the that's
[50:32] that's the proof uh Calvary and not only
[50:35] Calvary but he proved who he was on
[50:38] Easter morning amen because hey the
[50:41] scripture said Paul said in the word if
[50:43] he wasn't risen then our preaching is in
[50:46] vain all this is in vain but he proved
[50:48] what he was talking about on Easter
[50:50] morning
[50:52] thank God the Sun is up the sun is risen
[50:55] and me and you can go free
[50:59] amen so he said I believe he is if he's
[51:02] looking toward Calvary and dies in that
[51:04] estate certainly I believe you'll be
[51:07] saved
[51:08] I believe he'll go through though if he
[51:11] had if he had not the opportunity
[51:13] before but depends on you go back to the
[51:17] dying Thief at the cross
[51:20] but remember that was his first and last
[51:24] chance
[51:26] that was his first and last chance
[51:29] said you got one tonight
[51:33] don't wait till that time
[51:36] because it may not be that way with you
[51:40] he said that was he said he might saved
[51:42] he said I believe he is he said go
[51:44] through he'd be saved he said but you go
[51:46] back to that Thief at calm on the cross
[51:49] he said but remember that was his first
[51:51] and last chance
[51:53] oh he said oh my you got one tonight
[51:56] amen we all got tonight tonight could be
[52:00] your night amen this could be somebody's
[52:03] last service tonight amen and so I got
[52:06] to preach tonight like I'm a dying man
[52:08] preaching to a dying congregation
[52:12] Hallelujah

[52:21] some things I said sometimes you don't
[52:23] know what people go or our house to do
[52:27] things and or how to go about the
[52:28] leadership of the Lord until you've
[52:30] grown through some things
[52:32] and then you begin to look at situations
[52:34] a little bit different
[52:37] amen we're all human beings
[52:40] amen we all make mistakes there's only
[52:43] one that's unforgivable and that's
[52:45] blasphemy

[52:49] breath

[53:10] his first and last chance you got one

[53:22] it may not be that way with you hey I've
[53:25] known a lot of people that didn't know
[53:27] just snucked out just like that and they
[53:31] did not have an opportunity to repent
[53:33] and as the tree falls that's how it lays
[53:39] you say well I fished with a prophet I
[53:42] hunted with a prophet we need an
[53:43] experience with God not just fishing and
[53:45] hunting or whatever but we need an
[53:47] experience with God we need a Calvary in
[53:49] our lives
[53:50] first we need a Gethsemane not by will
[53:53] but thy will be done

[54:11] but they're too much of a chance to take
[54:14] a chance on

[57:13] life Lord on the inside of the inside
[57:15] something that's bubbling over
[57:20] so we found out
[57:22] that many found Resurrection in life
[57:25] so did Jairus
[57:27] amen
[57:29] you know God comes comes a time in your
[57:31] life where you have to make a decision
[57:34] hey man and that's what Jairus you
[57:37] remember he was a secret believer he
[57:39] didn't want nobody to know that he
[57:41] believed in the Lord Jesus amen but
[57:45] Jesus forced the issue on him
[57:47] oh sometimes he'll force the issue on me
[57:50] and you amen you believe this message is
[57:52] right or you don't
[57:54] amen you believe he was a prophet or you
[57:56] don't believe he was a prophet and every
[57:58] now and then he'll and every now and
[58:00] then God are forced to issue on you and
[58:03] he forced issue on Jairus there he was
[58:05] because the priest that said if you
[58:07] claim anything about Jesus we'll disown
[58:10] you you won't have one of our car
[58:12] Fellowship cards and all that and Jairus
[58:15] came because they called the doctors
[58:17] because his little girl was dying
[58:22] there's was can you imagine
[58:24] your little girl or whoever it may be
[58:28] I couldn't imagine one of my grandkids
[58:30] laying at the point of death
[58:32] amen I preached a message one time where
[58:35] remember watch wife amen and the prophet
[58:39] of God said I could see Miss lot and
[58:41] she's leaving amen her home where lot
[58:45] came home to us hey we gotta move again
[58:49] she just got hooked up with a good great
[58:51] societies the Stitch and soul parties
[58:54] and all that and the prophet of God said
[58:56] it like this there's nothing that could
[58:59] get to a grandma like a cry for
[59:01] grandchildren
[59:02] and that's what Miss lot was going out
[59:04] what was the command don't look back
[59:07] amen but then she was going out she
[59:10] began to hear the screams of her
[59:12] grandkids Sonata
[59:17] she turned to look
[59:21] could you imagine your mama's mama daddy
[59:26] she turned to look back
[59:30] God help us
[59:31] amen not to look back but let us keep
[59:34] pressing on Amen so the it was forced on
[59:38] Jairus amen the doctor came in there
[59:41] said I'm sorry jars he said but there's
[59:43] nothing else we can do we've done all we
[59:46] can do we ain't got the Medicine we
[59:48] don't know what's going on oh we know
[59:50] she's dying and we can't help her no

[59:56] around probably crying you know come on
[59:58] mamas come on Grandma's you know how it
[1:00:00] be

[1:12:12] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:12:15] iniquities something that we know to do
[1:12:17] and not do it or something that we know
[1:12:19] we shouldn't do and keep on doing it and

[1:13:50] peace was upon him and by his stripes we
[1:13:54] are healed the footnotes in my Scofield
[1:13:56] bible says it like this the literal
[1:13:59] rendering is horrible
[1:14:01] there's a movie what was about 2000 or
[1:14:05] the year 2000 or maybe Mel Mel Gibson I
[1:14:08] think it was the passion
[1:14:11] I don't know if anybody ever seen it but
[1:14:13] uh even that probably didn't depict a
[1:14:16] picture of what my Lord and your lord
[1:14:18] looked like
[1:14:19] spat upon beaten to them I said my
[1:14:22] footnotes there and I said it says
[1:14:23] little the little rendering is horrible
[1:14:25] so mark from the form of a man was his
[1:14:28] aspect that his appearance was not that
[1:14:31] of a son of man
[1:14:33] not human
[1:14:34] the effects of the brutalities described
[1:14:37] in Saint Matthew
[1:14:39] I mean death
[1:14:42] was death it was ultimated like this it
[1:14:46] occurred through a combination
[1:14:48] of constrained blood circulation organ
[1:14:52] failure failure and I officiation
[1:14:56] as the body strained under the own way
[1:14:59] under their own weight
[1:15:02] can you imagine constrained
[1:15:05] blood circulation
[1:15:07] organ failure and affixiation
[1:15:11] how did they would nail them to the
[1:15:12] cross and have they been their legs
[1:15:14] rather window and they would suffocate
[1:15:17] in their own fluid but it was in them
[1:15:20] times that they would raise up to kind
[1:15:22] of catch some breath so they could
[1:15:25] breathe and it was that time brother
[1:15:27] Kobe that he would raise up and try to
[1:15:30] get to go farther and then come back
[1:15:32] down
[1:15:33] then he'd raise up again and he said
[1:15:36] forgive them and he come back down
[1:15:40] and he'd raise up again said father
[1:15:43] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:15:45] do and come back down and he did that so
[1:15:47] me and you could sit here tonight
[1:15:51] Hallelujah
[1:15:55] they said if they that the criminals
[1:15:57] didn't die very soon
[1:15:59] it was they were it was hasten their
[1:16:01] death was hastened but they would hasten
[1:16:04] it by shattering their legs with an
[1:16:06] armed Club
[1:16:09] can you imagine
[1:16:11] but when it came to our Lord
[1:16:13] the Bible says not a bone and his body
[1:16:15] was broken
[1:16:19] Hallelujah
[1:16:20] can you imagine
[1:16:22] all the spit
[1:16:24] the blood
[1:16:26] the thorny crowns
[1:16:28] constrained
[1:16:30] circulation in the blood
[1:16:32] organ failure
[1:16:36] oh we ought to put it plain that it
[1:16:39] wasn't a pretty picture
[1:16:43] the brother Brandon said they shut the
[1:16:45] Quince with something wrapped around
[1:16:47] but he was put to an open shame
[1:16:51] can you imagine
[1:16:53] so that me and you could sit here
[1:16:54] tonight and raise our hands and sing
[1:16:57] Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound

[1:17:13] Hallelujah said they would hasten it by
[1:17:16] shutting their legs with an orange club
[1:17:18] which prevented them from supporting the
[1:17:20] body's weight
[1:17:21] and made inhalation more difficult
[1:17:24] accelerating both affixiation and shock
[1:17:31] that's awful
[1:17:33] amen the psalmist David said it like
[1:17:36] this under the anointing
[1:17:37] he said my bones are out of joint
[1:17:41] his hands
[1:17:44] were out of joint his arms were out of
[1:17:47] joint his shoulders were out of joint
[1:17:49] this pelvis was out of joint and there
[1:17:53] was no action of heart the action of the
[1:17:56] heart was affected amen and David said
[1:18:00] on the anointing my bones are out of
[1:18:02] joint and I poured out like water my
[1:18:05] heart is like Wax and it's melted in the
[1:18:08] midst of my bowels

[1:18:15] he was suffered
[1:18:19] streamed
[1:18:20] exhaustion
[1:18:23] an extreme thirst
[1:18:25] but he did it
[1:18:27] that we can go free

[1:20:56] then when it got rough
[1:20:58] he said he didn't see no Footprints
[1:21:01] beside him he said Lord did you leave me
[1:21:03] did you forsake me he said no my son
[1:21:06] that's when I picked you up in my arms
[1:21:08] and carried you oh hallelujah how many
[1:21:11] times me and you had to be carried amen
[1:21:14] me and you had to be carried along oh
[1:21:16] he's a kind compassionate friend tonight
[1:21:20] hallelujah amen he'll bring all my
[1:21:23] troubles quickly to the end he will
[1:21:24] deliver
[1:21:26] amen he will deliver make my troubles
[1:21:28] quickly to the end the world to evil
[1:21:31] allures me all around us it's worse now
[1:21:33] than it ever was then there's more
[1:21:37] things to get your young people's mind
[1:21:39] off the Lord than anything else
[1:21:42] back in our day it was hard but it ain't
[1:21:45] hard as like as is now so many spirits
[1:21:47] why because the lead has come off of
[1:21:49] hell and demon powers are streaming in
[1:21:51] every direction that's why we need to
[1:21:53] come to the house of God
[1:21:55] that's why we need one another that's
[1:21:58] why we need prayer and fellowship with
[1:22:00] one another
[1:22:05] brother Brown told us one I think it is
[1:22:08] going to be on the camp
[1:22:09] told this one said there was a I guess
[1:22:12] maybe like a youth deal today this young
[1:22:14] girl is going to put some sheets on the
[1:22:16] bed make the bed she said call that
[1:22:19] young lady back says he's seen that lied
[1:22:21] over
[1:22:23] the man said it like this
[1:22:25] and I got it the quote before me I can
[1:22:27] pull it up if you want me to
[1:22:29] it might not be perbatim but it be said
[1:22:32] that she had made a profession when she
[1:22:35] was 12 but she wasn't a Christian made a
[1:22:37] profession when she was 12 years old got
[1:22:40] baptized but you see the reason I say
[1:22:42] she wasn't a Christian because she never
[1:22:44] did attend church
[1:22:47] I thought my Lord then how important it
[1:22:50] is to come to the house of God
[1:22:52] amen never did attend church well I live
[1:22:55] stream amen hey that might be all right
[1:22:58] if you're sick or whatever amen the
[1:23:00] devil's made it good for us that we can
[1:23:02] stay home in our pajamas and drink our
[1:23:04] hot chocolate amen they need our popcorn
[1:23:07] but there's nothing like coming to a
[1:23:09] live service and entering an end with
[1:23:11] fellowship and worshiping Amen in the
[1:23:14] presence of almighty God
[1:23:16] Hallelujah
[1:23:18] amen
[1:23:20] Hallelujah the world to evil allures me
[1:23:24] my heart is tempted to sin
[1:23:28] now I must tell Jesus
[1:23:31] he'll help me
[1:23:33] over the world
[1:23:37] amen
[1:23:40] in Matthew's account
[1:23:42] it tells about the chief priests and the
[1:23:45] scribes and the elders mocked him
[1:23:48] Mark the self the suffering savior
[1:23:50] saying he trusted in God let him deliver
[1:23:53] him now
[1:23:54] if he will help him for he said I am the
[1:23:57] son of God
[1:23:58] the Bible also said there in Saint
[1:24:00] Matthew's account the thieves also which
[1:24:02] were crucified
[1:24:04] amen with him cast the same in their
[1:24:07] teeth
[1:24:08] you know there's always there's two
[1:24:10] kinds of responses that you usually get
[1:24:13] and the two kinds is number one the
[1:24:16] first Thief is we all can be like this
[1:24:18] we can we can rail against God me and
[1:24:22] you can and say hey if you are such a
[1:24:24] great and powerful and and loving God
[1:24:26] while I'm in Wyoming why I'm in this
[1:24:29] hellish mess
[1:24:31] we can be like that
[1:24:34] and then the second one his attitude was
[1:24:36] a whole lot different than that first
[1:24:38] one
[1:24:38] he said hey we can another he
[1:24:41] acknowledged that he was a sinner I mean
[1:24:43] you can do that and and we don't desire
[1:24:46] any good thing hey the Bible said we
[1:24:48] read it that he was that hey we we
[1:24:50] receive Justice for our dues we received
[1:24:53] the new Justice for our Deeds this guy
[1:24:56] he ain't done nothing to miss
[1:24:59] and he cried out for mercy
[1:25:01] and said help me
[1:25:03] cried out for mercy and help in the time
[1:25:05] of desperation see the world is full of
[1:25:08] the first kind
[1:25:10] who think that God owes them everything
[1:25:14] put your finger in a bucket of water the
[1:25:16] prophet of God said take your finger out
[1:25:17] find out where you put it he said that's
[1:25:19] how much God don't need you but you sure
[1:25:21] do need him
[1:25:26] amen the world they're further who
[1:25:28] thinks of the god oh but only a few
[1:25:31] that are of the second kind
[1:25:33] is a God I know I deserve
[1:25:37] what I get Lord
[1:25:39] but Lord just have mercy
[1:25:41] you remember there was two guys that
[1:25:44] went to the temple to pray
[1:25:46] a Pharisee and Republican
[1:25:48] the Pharisee said Lord
[1:25:51] he held his head high said how fast
[1:25:53] twice the week I've done all these
[1:25:55] things I probably ties of all of them
[1:25:57] all I own I thank you Lord that I ain't
[1:25:59] like this one this one and I thank you
[1:26:01] that I ain't like that Republican
[1:26:03] and that Publican didn't even raise his
[1:26:05] head
[1:26:05] just kept his head bowed and smoked his
[1:26:07] breasts and said God be merciful to me a
[1:26:10] sinner
[1:26:11] oh God I don't deserve nothing Lord I
[1:26:14] deserve to die I
[1:26:17] know would you be merciful to me tonight
[1:26:19] nor would you remember me
[1:26:23] see both are suffering the pain of
[1:26:25] crucifixion fiction both the guilty of
[1:26:27] crimes receiving the new reward of their
[1:26:30] deeds both see the sign over Jesus's
[1:26:33] head King of the Jews
[1:26:35] they hear the words from his mouth
[1:26:37] father forgive them
[1:26:39] both of them want to be desperately
[1:26:41] saved from death
[1:26:43] and most of us have these things in
[1:26:46] common with the two thieves
[1:26:49] let's see the difference
[1:26:52] between
[1:26:53] the two
[1:26:54] the first one ain't she the Christ
[1:26:58] well that's what it says and we heard
[1:27:00] people say these things ain't you the
[1:27:01] Christ ain't you doing all these things
[1:27:03] save yourself and us too
[1:27:06] yeah see it's a picture a spiritual
[1:27:08] destitute
[1:27:10] a worldly man a matter of total
[1:27:12] indifference to him that is suffering
[1:27:14] the new reward of his deeds right and
[1:27:16] wrong
[1:27:18] praise and blame good and bad or of no
[1:27:21] interest to him
[1:27:23] his objective is to save his Earthly
[1:27:26] skin
[1:27:27] that's all he wants to do
[1:27:29] he knows he got in trouble he knows he's
[1:27:31] done wrong but all he wanted to do is
[1:27:33] save his Earthly skin
[1:27:35] here Lord
[1:27:38] hey I don't care right and wrong good
[1:27:41] and bad blame whoever praise whoever
[1:27:43] good and bad that's no interest to me I
[1:27:46] just want to come down off this cross
[1:27:49] he he see he he might he might even be
[1:27:52] he might even believe Jesus was the
[1:27:54] Messiah I don't know he he might even
[1:27:56] believe the message was right just like
[1:27:58] me and you we believe that he is Lord
[1:28:00] tonight amen he is Lord he is Lord he
[1:28:03] has risen from the dead and he is Lord
[1:28:05] we believe this message is right come on
[1:28:07] if we got any sense of balance we know
[1:28:08] this message is right
[1:28:10] but it's just a matter of convenience to
[1:28:13] him oh God don't let this message just
[1:28:15] become a matter of convenience to us
[1:28:17] amen where Hey listen I'm backsliding I
[1:28:20] better put on a tape and press play so I
[1:28:23] can become under the token they ain't
[1:28:24] the token what is the token the very
[1:28:27] Life of Christ on this way in a
[1:28:29] believer's life
[1:28:31] amen
[1:28:34] this guy it's just a matter of
[1:28:37] convenience to him he'll take anybody as
[1:28:39] a king
[1:28:41] who can get him off the cross
[1:28:43] Jesus all he is to him is just another
[1:28:46] Patsy to serve his own worldly purposes
[1:28:50] the second one
[1:28:52] he suffers
[1:28:54] and he and the suffering this first one
[1:28:58] the suffering interrupts his goals and
[1:29:00] pleasures
[1:29:01] so why not try God
[1:29:03] and maybe he can get me out of trouble
[1:29:05] he can get me out of this financial mess
[1:29:08] out of this sickness out this crummy
[1:29:11] marriage but he's got no Spirit of
[1:29:13] Brokenness he's got no guilt no Penance
[1:29:16] or humility he only sees Jesus as a
[1:29:18] possible
[1:29:20] power to get him off the cross he don't
[1:29:22] see him as a king to be followed never
[1:29:24] entered his mind to say he was sorry and
[1:29:27] he should change but the second one he
[1:29:30] is not suckered in by the Other Fellers
[1:29:32] uh uh railing oh God help us not to get
[1:29:35] well and uh caught up in the other
[1:29:38] people's uh whatever they're going
[1:29:39] through however that and they may say
[1:29:41] this and that let us not get caught up
[1:29:43] in that
[1:29:44] amen but we have to stand our ground and
[1:29:48] not be sucked in by the people other
[1:29:50] brothers and sisters amen all around us
[1:29:53] why what doesn't he do you not he even
[1:29:56] tells another don't you fear God don't
[1:29:58] you know what hey we deserve to die we
[1:30:01] did this and we've done all this and we
[1:30:03] deserve to die
[1:30:05] amen we deserve all this
[1:30:07] we need to deserve to die
[1:30:09] amen we deserve all this
[1:30:14] amen and he's looking
[1:30:16] and I imagine that Thief brother Michael
[1:30:19] if he could tell us testimony he'd tell
[1:30:22] us things didn't make us our hair stand
[1:30:24] up on the back of the head what he's
[1:30:26] seen he didn't mix in all sorts of
[1:30:28] society he had all things amen he he got
[1:30:32] caught up with a crowd amen the
[1:30:34] so-called crowd so-called what he
[1:30:36] thought was his friends he got caught up
[1:30:38] in that all kinds of societies
[1:30:41] amen but he began to look at something
[1:30:44] brother Wendell and he began to look at
[1:30:46] the Lord's Behavior
[1:30:49] I've never seen a man carry a cross
[1:30:52] with such behavior and
[1:30:54] as
[1:30:57] he thought why who is this guy
[1:31:00] he began to think
[1:31:02] I've never seen anybody
[1:31:04] on the way to their crucifixion on the
[1:31:07] way I've never seen I've seen all kinds
[1:31:09] of people
[1:31:10] but I've never seen one like this guy
[1:31:12] that bore a cross like this before
[1:31:16] this warming fashion he probably thought
[1:31:19] who is this Meek and Majestic person
[1:31:23] any seen people Weeping at the foot of
[1:31:26] the cross
[1:31:28] they probably thought itself
[1:31:30] he's seen all that he thought about
[1:31:31] would there be anyone that would weep
[1:31:33] for me
[1:31:35] he's seen all them people weeping either
[1:31:37] of God whether it be anybody that would
[1:31:39] weep for me
[1:31:42] oh my
[1:31:44] who could this be
[1:31:48] pilate wrote the king of the Jews they
[1:31:51] probably thought is this who he is is
[1:31:52] this him
[1:31:54] is who it really is
[1:31:58] they probably they they probably heard
[1:32:01] it in the from the lip of his enemies
[1:32:03] because it was there was Crisis enemies
[1:32:06] all around
[1:32:07] uh mocking him and making fun of him
[1:32:09] said hey you'd say you're the king come
[1:32:12] off the cross
[1:32:14] hey just like today
[1:32:16] you know the internet's good
[1:32:19] it got all kinds of bad things against
[1:32:20] this message but it gets a lot of people
[1:32:22] checking into it
[1:32:24] so hey could it really be all that bad
[1:32:26] you take a you take a tree that's got a
[1:32:29] lot of rocks at the bottom of it you
[1:32:31] know what that means that means there's
[1:32:32] a lot of good fruit in that tree where
[1:32:34] people are taking rocks and trying to
[1:32:35] knock that fruit out
[1:32:37] hallelujah amen oh man he break in to
[1:32:42] look at it he said is this who he really
[1:32:44] is this who he is is this the one
[1:32:48] this him
[1:32:52] there he was
[1:32:54] there was no one else around
[1:32:56] all his disciples had forsaken him
[1:32:58] Christ that is
[1:33:00] John might have lingered in the distance
[1:33:02] just a little ways off
[1:33:04] there's some women that stood maybe
[1:33:07] stood far off Judas had just sold them
[1:33:09] out
[1:33:11] Peter had denied him
[1:33:14] and he said Lord
[1:33:16] would you remember me
[1:33:19] but you remember me Lord
[1:33:22] no one had surrounded him this thief
[1:33:25] there was everybody around Jesus mocking
[1:33:28] him despising him weeping
[1:33:30] like I said all the disciples had
[1:33:32] forsaken John might have lingered of
[1:33:34] this and he just said Lord
[1:33:36] don't you remember me
[1:33:38] no one had surrounded him
[1:33:40] there's people all around us tonight
[1:33:42] that believe

[1:35:08] foot of the cross
[1:35:15] there was no special meeting going on
[1:35:20] there was no special prayer request for
[1:35:22] him
[1:35:24] nobody read up said hey we got a special
[1:35:27] prayer request

[1:36:29] remember me
[1:36:32] and Jesus says today you'll be with me
[1:36:34] in Paradise then brother Joe all of a
[1:36:36] sudden he bows his head that Thief
[1:36:39] and he's dead
[1:36:41] somebody said you know what
[1:36:43] dying is like
[1:36:46] when some of us was real little
[1:36:48] maybe you visit your grandmother
[1:36:50] and y'all would stand over there for a
[1:36:52] long time and you got real sleepy and
[1:36:53] you fell asleep on the couch
[1:36:56] and your mom and dad came and picked you
[1:36:57] up took you out to the car and when you
[1:37:00] woke up
[1:37:01] was in your bed

[1:37:24] this wasn't real after all Hallelujah
[1:37:30] Hallelujah
[1:37:32] he bows his head and he dies
[1:37:34] then all of a sudden brother Durant he
[1:37:36] opens up his eyes
[1:37:37] and Jesus says there's my buddy
[1:37:41] fits his arm away and said welcome home
[1:37:43] my son

[1:38:09] brother Wendy would it be somewhere over
[1:38:11] there sitting around that table

[1:38:13] me and said Brother David we made it we
[1:38:16] made it we made it I can say brother

[1:38:43] I want my name wrote
[1:38:46] I want him to remember me
[1:38:48] when the role is called
[1:38:51] he said and it throws me into
[1:38:52] desperation that is like Paul
[1:38:55] said after I preached the gospel shall
[1:38:57] be a stowaway so I'll be cast off he
[1:39:00] said it could happen
[1:39:03] think about it
[1:39:04] what was brother Wendell talking about
[1:39:06] being dedicated that's ministers
[1:39:09] hey man
[1:39:10] all that he said it could happen Paul
[1:39:13] said I've got to bring this body under
[1:39:15] subjection to what the word he was
[1:39:17] preaching
[1:39:18] because that very word that he would
[1:39:20] preach would meet him at the day of
[1:39:21] judgment
[1:39:22] amen remember I said it could happen he
[1:39:25] said so it throws me into a desperate
[1:39:26] stage desperations to think after all
[1:39:29] these years of preaching what could I
[1:39:32] could I I a place come where I could
[1:39:34] fail him
[1:39:37] what's the next move what must I do next
[1:39:40] and it throws me into a nervous stage
[1:39:42] that what can I do it throws me to the
[1:39:44] mountains into the valleys and it's hard
[1:39:46] because when I'm with the people I got
[1:39:48] to be all things to all men that I might
[1:39:50] win some to Christ yet with a token
[1:39:52] always before me

[1:41:20] mighty Ah that's all right come on
[1:41:22] follow me you're noble come on that's
[1:41:24] all right father oh hallelujah amen he

[1:41:32] snow he don't have to ask anybody about
[1:41:34] it
[1:41:35] oh it can do it because it's sovereign
[1:41:39] he said listen closely now
[1:41:42] that was proved at the cross when there
[1:41:44] was a violence Thief
[1:41:46] he deserved to die God had never came
[1:41:49] across his mind he never thought nothing
[1:41:51] of it there on the cross went through
[1:41:53] those bloody lips in between the groans
[1:41:56] that came a sound Lord be merciful to me
[1:41:59] and there came another one back through
[1:42:01] blood tears Agony Grace took a hold and
[1:42:04] said today shalt thou be with me in
[1:42:07] Paradise Grace did that how could that
[1:42:09] Thief help himself no more than Adam and
[1:42:11] Eve could help himself no more than he
[1:42:14] could help herself no more than you can
[1:42:15] help yourself no more than I could help
[1:42:17] myself when no more that we could jerk
[1:42:19] ourselves up the milky white way with
[1:42:21] her bootstraps we couldn't do it but the

[1:46:45] listen to this
[1:46:47] he said after 40 Years of faithful
[1:46:49] service to the Lord
[1:46:50] as a missionary to Africa
[1:46:53] Henry Morrison and his wife were
[1:46:54] returning to New York
[1:46:57] as a ship near the dock Henry said to
[1:47:00] his wife look at that crowd they haven't
[1:47:03] forgotten about us
[1:47:06] however unknown to Henry the ship also
[1:47:09] carried president Teddy Roosevelt
[1:47:12] returning from a big game hunt trip in
[1:47:14] Africa
[1:47:15] Roosevelt stepped out from the boat with
[1:47:18] great Fanfare as people were cheering
[1:47:20] flags were waving bands were playing and
[1:47:23] reporters waiting for his comment
[1:47:26] Henry and his wife solely walked away
[1:47:29] unnoticed they held a cab which took
[1:47:32] them to the one bedroom apartment which
[1:47:34] had been provided by the mission board
[1:47:36] over the next few weeks Henry tried but
[1:47:39] failed to put the incident behind him he
[1:47:42] was sinking deeper into depression when
[1:47:45] one evening he said to his wife this is
[1:47:47] all wrong this man comes back from a
[1:47:49] hunt trip and everybody throws a big
[1:47:51] party we give our lives to in faithful
[1:47:54] service to God for all these many years
[1:47:55] but no one seems to care
[1:47:58] his wife costed him that he should not
[1:48:01] feel this way Henry plot I know you're
[1:48:03] right but I just can't help it it just
[1:48:06] isn't right that's why I said then said
[1:48:08] Henry you know God doesn't mind if we
[1:48:10] honestly question him you need to tell
[1:48:12] this to the Lord and get this settled
[1:48:14] now you'll be no
[1:48:16] you you'll be useless in his ministry
[1:48:19] until you do
[1:48:21] any more Morrison then went to his
[1:48:23] bedroom got down on his knees
[1:48:26] and he began to pour out his heart to
[1:48:29] the Lord Lord you know our situation and
[1:48:31] what's troubling me
[1:48:33] we gladly served you Faithfully for
[1:48:34] years without complaining but now God I
[1:48:36] just can't get this incident out of my
[1:48:38] mind
[1:48:39] after about 10 minutes of favorite
[1:48:41] prayer Henry return to the living room
[1:48:43] with a peaceful look on his face
[1:48:45] his wife said it looks like you resolved
[1:48:48] the matter what happened Henry replied
[1:48:51] the Lord settled it for me I told him
[1:48:54] how bitter I was that the president
[1:48:56] received a tremendous homecoming but no
[1:48:58] one even met us as we returned home when
[1:49:02] I finished it seemed as though the Lord
[1:49:03] put his hand on my shoulder and simply
[1:49:05] say but Henry you're not home yet
[1:49:16] said it's not yet time to congratulate
[1:49:18] ourselves
[1:49:20] neither is it time for us to tell
[1:49:23] ourselves that we have done enough
[1:49:25] Heaven is a home and as long as we're
[1:49:27] not yet there we have to keep pressing
