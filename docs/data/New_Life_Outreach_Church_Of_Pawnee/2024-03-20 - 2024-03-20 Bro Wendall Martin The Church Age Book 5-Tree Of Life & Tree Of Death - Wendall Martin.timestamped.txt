[15:05] and um uh when you're talking about the
[15:08] tree of life and the tree of death
[15:10] and and um but uh amen it's so good I I
[15:16] I probably won't have too much to add to
[15:18] it and uh uh we might uh stop for a
[15:23] comment occasionally but if there's ever
[15:24] anybody who who um uh have questions uh
[15:29] on on these Wednesday nights especially
[15:30] when we're doing these kind of teachings
[15:33] raise your hand and ask amen if you if
[15:35] you got any kind of questions at all and
[15:38] um and so we will um uh we I know that
[15:44] we'll all enjoy it let's look here at at
[15:46] Revelations 2 and
[15:48] 6 um let's see let's let's let's go down
[15:52] to the sth verse and he that hath an ear
[15:56] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[15:58] the church Church es to him that
[16:01] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[16:03] tree of life which is in the Paradise in
[16:07] the midst of the paradise of God Amen
[16:10] let's go to the Lord in prayer father we
[16:13] just want to thank you today for your
[16:16] blessings upon Our Lives thank you for
[16:18] the power of your holy spirit that you

[16:29] the needs that are here Lord you you see
[16:33] um those that are still recouping from

[16:45] father that you'll be with brother Mitch
[16:47] and so glad that he and sister Denise
[16:49] are out of the hospitals Lord just
[16:52] thanking you for that and just asking
[16:54] that you would help them to recover Lord
[16:56] we're as we read tonight the church age
[16:59] book we just ask that your blessings
[17:02] would be here your spirit would sanction
[17:03] it and we'll just give you glory and
[17:06] honor in the name of the Lord Jesus
[17:08] Christ can the church say
[17:11] amen and amen you can be seated
[17:16] tonight um so if on your in your church
[17:20] age book um we're going to read here at
[17:25] um
[17:27] 97 and um
[17:29] so uh those that brought you Church age
[17:34] book amen U
[17:37] 97 we will we will start to read and and
[17:41] um brother brandom is going going to
[17:43] deal with the the uh tree of life and
[17:46] the tree of um death the knowledge of
[17:52] Good and Evil and so um as a preface to
[17:56] this um we
[17:59] everything about
[18:02] um of course we know that the Bible is a
[18:05] book of redemption and Revelation is the
[18:09] Book of Revelations is just is is really
[18:12] magnifying the end product of redemption
[18:15] and and what God has done to to bring
[18:19] the church into that rapturing condition
[18:22] and I think we all know that every human
[18:25] being um was in need of redemption and
[18:29] and that we were all born in sin yet
[18:33] there was one that was not born in sin
[18:38] amen because he was virgin birth so amen
[18:42] there's something about that virgin
[18:44] birth the Virgin birth had to come amen
[18:48] because we were all born in uh through
[18:52] sex and so um and and you know you it it
[18:57] makes you wonder why I remember as a kid
[19:00] wondering why I would have to be born
[19:03] again Nicodemus even asked that he says
[19:05] how can I be born again how can I go
[19:07] back and enter into my mama's womb the
[19:10] second time and so Jesus was saying no
[19:14] you've been the first birth wasn't the
[19:16] right birth amen so the second birth is
[19:20] what is going to correct the first birth
[19:23] and so um so we were born sexual amen
[19:28] which is of death and disease and and
[19:31] sorrows and so but Jesus did not have to
[19:35] be born again why because he came the
[19:38] spoken word uh the way that he was
[19:41] supposed to so amen so the reason why
[19:45] the scripture says there in in in 1
[19:48] Peter 3 and and um 20 uh or 1 and 23 I
[19:53] believe it is that um amen being born
[19:57] not of sexual seed but of Incorruptible
[20:00] seed Eternal seed by the word of God
[20:04] which is by the word that is preached to
[20:06] us so as we as we read this along
[20:09] through here I want us to keep um those
[20:13] those things in our mind because um and
[20:17] we're going to find out that the Tree of
[20:19] Life in the beginning um amen and and
[20:25] matters of fact I don't think brother
[20:26] brandham is is actually going to deal
[20:29] with that at the very beginning so what
[20:31] we might do let's let's look here at
[20:33] Genesis the um the third
[20:36] um the let's just look at it here at the
[20:41] um uh the 2 chapter and the eth verse
[20:45] and then we'll get it started
[20:49] here it says and the Lord God planted a
[20:52] garden Eastward in Eden and there he put
[20:55] the man whom he had formed out of the
[20:58] ground the Lord God uh out of the ground
[21:02] made the Lord God to grow every tree
[21:05] that is Pleasant to the site and good
[21:07] for food so I just want you to look
[21:09] there out of the ground everybody say
[21:11] out of the ground and if you're marking
[21:13] it amen you can just Mark that out of
[21:16] the ground every tree is good for food
[21:20] and uh Pleasant to the
[21:22] sight then he goes and says the tree of
[21:26] life also in the midst of the garden and
[21:30] the tree of the knowledge of Good and
[21:32] Evil so he's talking every ground out of
[21:36] the tree or out of the garden every tree
[21:39] out of the the ground was good for food
[21:42] but then the Lord also had some other
[21:45] trees in there now amen um and go to the
[21:50] 16th verse and the Lord commanded the
[21:52] man saying of every tree of the garden
[21:55] thou mayest eat freely but of the tree
[21:59] of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[22:02] not eat of it but in the day that thou
[22:05] eat eatest their R Thou shalt surely die
[22:10] then you go on down to the third verse
[22:13] or the third chapter and the first verse
[22:16] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[22:19] beast of the field which the Lord God
[22:21] had made and he the serpent the one that
[22:25] was more subtle than any Beast now that
[22:27] word subtle is is um he's had a lot of
[22:31] knowledge he's crafty he's he's very
[22:33] smart he can communicate he can talk and
[22:37] so uh and he said the serpent yay hath
[22:41] God said ye shall not eat of every tree
[22:45] in the garden and the woman said unto
[22:47] this serpent she's talking to him we may
[22:51] eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[22:53] garden but of the tree which is in the
[22:55] midst of the garden God ha said You
[22:57] shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[23:00] touch it lest you die and the serpent
[23:04] said this is that Beast under the woman
[23:07] ye shall not surely die for God doth
[23:11] know that in the days that you eat
[23:13] thereof then your eyes will be open and
[23:15] you shall be as God's knowing good now
[23:20] let's go to our church age book and
[23:21] we'll just we we'll get started here
[23:24] amen now brother brandham is going to
[23:27] he's he's the the scripture we opened up
[23:29] in in Revelations 2 and 7 um he he's
[23:33] reading he's reading there to him that
[23:36] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[23:39] tree of life which is in the midst of
[23:40] the paradise of God he said this is the
[23:43] future reward and this is this this is
[23:46] the um second paragraph of
[23:48] 97 uh uh this is a future reward to all
[23:52] Overcomers of all ages when the last
[23:54] call to battle has been sounded and when
[23:57] our arm armors have been laid down then
[24:00] we will rest in the paradise of God and
[24:03] our portion shall be the tree of life
[24:05] forever the tree of life isn't that a
[24:08] beautiful figure of speech it is
[24:10] mentioned three times in the Book of
[24:12] Genesis and three times in the Book of
[24:15] Revelation in all six places it is the
[24:18] same tree and symbolizes the same thing
[24:22] so now for you kids so brother brandham
[24:25] is letting us know that this is not a
[24:28] natural tree all of the trees that were
[24:30] in the ground all them that were planted
[24:33] is good for food it was good to look at
[24:36] amen you can eat of every one of those
[24:38] trees but there's also the tree of life
[24:42] and the tree of death so so these are
[24:46] not these are going to be a figured of
[24:48] speech this is this is something that is
[24:50] going to be held a mystery of course
[24:53] until um these last days when the Lord
[24:57] reveals to us what was taking place now
[24:59] brother brandom is fixing to show us
[25:01] what this tree of life was he says now
[25:04] what is the Tree of Life well first of
[25:07] all we would have to know what the tree
[25:10] itself stands for in numbers 24 and 6 as
[25:14] balum described Israel he said there
[25:17] were trees of lion allows uh which the
[25:21] Lord hath planted trees throughout the
[25:23] scripture refers to persons as in Psalms
[25:26] 1 thus the Tree of Life must be the
[25:31] person of life and that is Jesus now in
[25:36] the Garden of Eden there were two trees
[25:39] standing in the midst of it one was the
[25:42] tree of life and the other was the tree
[25:45] of knowledge of good of evil and evil
[25:48] and man was to live by the tree of life
[25:51] but he was not to touch the other tree
[25:53] or he would
[25:55] die but man did partake of the other
[25:58] tree and and when he did Death entered
[26:02] into him by sin and he was separated
[26:05] from God now back to the tree there in
[26:08] in Eden that tree was the source of Life
[26:12] uh which was the source of life was
[26:14] Jesus in John chapter
[26:17] 6-8 Jesus sets himself forth as the
[26:20] source of eternal life he called himself
[26:23] the bread from Heaven he spoke of
[26:26] himself and and that if any if a man ate
[26:29] of him he would never die he proclaimed
[26:33] that he knew Abraham and that before
[26:36] Abraham he was he prophesied that he
[26:40] himself would give them Living Waters
[26:43] that if any man drink he would never
[26:45] thirst again but would live eternally he
[26:48] showed himself as The Great I Am he is
[26:52] the bread of life The Well of Life The
[26:55] Eternal one the Tree of Life he was back
[26:59] there in Eden in the midst of the garden
[27:03] even as he will be in the midst of the
[27:06] paradise of God now this doesn't mean
[27:09] that that Jesus you say well I thought
[27:13] Jesus was only 33 years old that he had
[27:16] a time that he was born and then he had
[27:18] a time that he ended and that is correct
[27:21] he wasn't back there in his physical
[27:24] form in the body of Jesus he but he he
[27:29] was in the he was that logos which was
[27:33] the spirit of God Amen so he was there
[27:37] in word form right amen now now if we
[27:42] want to stop right there for a moment
[27:44] and let's just cheat and go we're going
[27:46] to we're going to try to make it all the
[27:47] way to 107 tonight okay but let's go to
[27:49] the 106 real quickly and then we'll
[27:53] we'll catch um that this might be
[27:56] something for you young ones uh 106 and
[27:59] we're going to do 1 2 3 the third
[28:02] paragraph it says now right here someone
[28:06] is going to ask me the question did God
[28:08] tell Eve uh to watch out for the serpent
[28:10] or the serpent would seduce her now
[28:12] listen God didn't have to say one thing
[28:15] about what would happen he just get the
[28:18] point of the story he simply gave the
[28:21] word he said not to partake of knowledge
[28:25] but partake of life life was the the
[28:28] word of God death was anything that was
[28:31] that wasn't the word of God she allowed
[28:35] one word to be changed and right then
[28:37] Satan had her God could have said don't
[28:39] pick more fruit off the trees than you
[28:41] can eat Satan could say look that is
[28:44] quite right you see if you pick too much
[28:47] it will rot but here is a method for
[28:48] preserving the fruit and yet at the same
[28:51] time you can pick all you want so you
[28:53] see you can have your way and God's way
[28:55] at the same time the devil would have
[28:57] had a right there he that is guilty of
[29:00] one point of the law has broke the whole
[29:02] law don't fool with that word that is
[29:07] exactly what happened in the Ephesian
[29:08] Church age uh before it ran out in um in
[29:13] 170 ad so what did that tree produce the
[29:17] tree of knowledge produced death Cain
[29:19] killed his brother Abel the wicked
[29:21] killed the righteous now so let's go
[29:23] back to the other so as we deal with
[29:25] these two trees now we're going to see
[29:29] amen one is the life of God which is the
[29:32] word of God the other is the life is
[29:36] death which is Satan coming against the
[29:40] word of God so you're going to have in
[29:43] the garden we have two figurative
[29:45] speeches amen we've got two spirits that
[29:49] are at work in the Garden of Eden that
[29:52] is that is trying to find its way and to
[29:57] keep those two people in the Garden of
[30:00] Eden amen so we got one we got two
[30:03] spirits that are that are trying to
[30:05] attract that are trying to pull amen we
[30:09] have the word of God that man is to live
[30:11] by and then we've got Satan trying to
[30:13] substitute it amen y'all understand that
[30:16] now all right so let's let's go on down
[30:19] to um let's see here uh are we in one
[30:23] let's see we're in 98 and we're at the
[30:26] second paragraph now so some have the
[30:28] idea that the two trees in the garden
[30:30] were just two more trees liken to the
[30:32] rest of those that God had placed there
[30:35] but careful students know that this is
[30:37] not so when John the Baptist cried that
[30:41] the ax was laid to the root of the all
[30:43] trees he was not talking of Simply
[30:45] natural trees but spiritual principles
[30:49] in 1 John 5:11 it records this is the
[30:52] record that God hath given us eternal
[30:56] life and this life is in his son Jesus
[31:00] in John 5:4 ye will not come to me that
[31:04] you might have life thus the record
[31:07] God's word States plainly and clearly
[31:10] that life eternal life is in the sun it
[31:14] is in no other place 1 John 5:12 he that
[31:18] hath the son hath life he that hath not
[31:20] the Son of God hath not life since the
[31:24] record cannot change and taken from or
[31:27] added there unto then the record stands
[31:30] that the life is in the Sun and since
[31:33] this is so the tree in the garden has to
[31:35] be Jesus all right if the tree of life
[31:39] is a person then the tree of knowledge
[31:42] of Good and Evil is a person also it
[31:45] can't be otherwise thus the righteous
[31:48] one and the wicked one stood side by
[31:51] side there in the midst of the Garden of
[31:54] Eden Ezekiel
[31:56] 2813a th Satan has been in Eden the
[32:01] Garden of God so now here we've got it
[32:04] the stage is set we've got we've got the
[32:07] eternal life that is God then we've got
[32:10] the spirit of Satan amen that has that
[32:13] has came into God's garden and is trying
[32:16] to sub subdue uh uh what God has started
[32:21] and I think brother Bram is I think
[32:22] you're going to uh en enjoy this and
[32:25] even you young people now any anyone
[32:27] have any questions so
[32:29] far any questions as we go just throw
[32:32] them out there and and then we can make
[32:33] it a group a group setting if we need to
[32:36] you kids are we all right amen all right
[32:39] okay so let's go uh let's just continue
[32:42] on now here is where we received the
[32:45] true revelation of the serpent seed here
[32:47] is what really happened in the Garden of
[32:49] Eden the word said that Eve was beguiled
[32:52] by the serpent she was actually seduced
[32:56] by the serpent it it says in in Genesis
[32:59] 3 And1 now the serpent was more subtle
[33:03] than any beast of the field which the
[33:05] Lord God had made this Beast was so
[33:08] close to a human being and yet was pure
[33:11] animal that he could talk or he could
[33:14] reason and talk he was an upright
[33:16] creature and was somewhat in between a
[33:19] chimpanzee and a man but closer to a man
[33:23] he was so close to being human that his
[33:25] seed could and did mingle with that of
[33:29] the woman and cause her to conceive when
[33:32] this happened God cursed the serpent he
[33:35] changed every bone in in the Serpent's
[33:38] body so that he uh so that he had to
[33:41] crawl like a snake and S and science uh
[33:45] can try all it wants to it won't find
[33:48] the missing link God saw to that man is
[33:51] smart he can see an association of man
[33:55] uh with animal and he tries to prove it
[33:57] out of evolution tion there isn't any
[33:59] Evolution but man and animal did mingle
[34:03] that's one of the mysteries of God that
[34:05] has remained hidden but is here but is
[34:07] here it is revealed it happened right
[34:10] back there in the midst of Eden when Eve
[34:14] turned away from life to accept death
[34:18] amen so so now are are are we are we
[34:21] catching the picture here now we've got
[34:24] all of the we've got all of the the um
[34:28] the trees in the garden I mean here's
[34:29] here's here's all of the trees and uh
[34:33] and and it's just beautiful trees
[34:35] everywhere you've got all the all these
[34:36] fruit trees everywhere but in the midst
[34:39] of the garden God's giving a
[34:41] warning now you're going to have
[34:44] life in the midst there's going to be
[34:48] life and there's going to be death I'm
[34:51] want just going to put it as persons
[34:52] here all right so that you can see it
[34:55] there's going to be two spirits there's
[34:57] going to be life and death you can
[34:59] partake of life that's my words you can
[35:02] stand there and my spirit will be there
[35:04] with you right amen but there's also I'm
[35:08] letting you know there is an evil one
[35:11] out there that is going to try to take
[35:13] you away from my word and he will seduce
[35:17] you why was this amen because Adam Adam
[35:22] was the son of God Adam and Eve was the
[35:26] son of God ad
[35:28] Adam was God's man on
[35:32] Earth all
[35:35] right amen if you wanted to get anything
[35:39] done this man and his wife had the
[35:43] authority of the
[35:44] earth now Satan has already has already
[35:48] been kicked out of heaven before this
[35:50] even taken place this is this is this
[35:52] has already been taken place so now God
[35:54] is letting them know now listen there's
[35:57] an evil Vil one there's an evil one
[35:59] among you and you've got to be careful
[36:03] don't make make sure you choose life and
[36:07] not
[36:08] knowledge right all right so you've got
[36:12] to choose life over knowledge because
[36:15] Satan is going to try Satan's trying to
[36:18] get into mankind he has seen that what
[36:22] God done God created him a body and God
[36:26] is now living his life he was going to
[36:29] live his life here on
[36:32] Earth now Satan's already according to
[36:34] Isaiah the 14th chapter Isaiah he's
[36:37] already saying I want to exalt my Throne
[36:41] I want to be as God I want to have a
[36:43] Dominion the only problem is Satan's a
[36:46] created being Satan cannot
[36:48] create so Satan can't so he's looking he
[36:52] sees what God has done he sees that God
[36:56] created a body
[36:58] of his own nature of his own self amen
[37:02] and and he and he gave that man a wife
[37:05] and he knew he had already heard to
[37:08] multiply and to replenish the Earth so
[37:11] now Satan is going to try to get in here
[37:15] and and to take advantage of
[37:17] Eve so now here's where we're at he's
[37:20] going to try to take advantage of Eve
[37:22] the only he can't create himself in Eve
[37:25] he can't do it but if he can find
[37:28] another animal amen now this is and if
[37:32] you they in your you kids in school I'm
[37:35] sure you've already got there to where
[37:37] they're saying there is a missing link
[37:38] between animal the the panzee and
[37:41] Humanity there is that Missing Link it's
[37:44] it's it's there you've got the
[37:46] chimpanzee that's really smart but then
[37:48] you've got but there used to be a beast
[37:52] that could and
[37:54] did uh uh talk like a man Walk Like a
[37:58] Man communicate like a man and that that
[38:02] a Satan came in and and anointed him to
[38:08] do what he' done to Eve now any any
[38:10] questions here uh before we go any
[38:13] further anything else you want to add to
[38:16] and uh feel feel free to do so so so
[38:19] here we go Satan is competing with God
[38:22] God knows it but man's own free moral
[38:24] agency man can choose one way the other
[38:28] he's either going to choose what God
[38:29] tells him to do or he's going to listen
[38:32] to another voice and God's saying I want
[38:36] you to listen to me I want you to listen
[38:39] all right amen
[38:41] now let's see um uh let's let's go back
[38:45] and read one more time there at the last
[38:48] the last CH uh the the 98 and the last
[38:51] paragraph here is where we receive the
[38:54] true revelation of the serpent seed here
[38:56] is what really happened in the in the
[38:58] Garden of Eden the word says Eve was
[39:00] beguiled by the serpent she was actually
[39:02] seduced by the serpent it says in in
[39:05] Genesis 3:1 now the serpent was more
[39:07] subtle than any beast of the field which
[39:10] the Lord God had made so now the devil
[39:12] has is now entered into that serpent
[39:15] amen he's now that serpent is not a
[39:18] snake it's not a snake he's a beast amen
[39:22] he was the top the scripture says he's
[39:24] the top of all all the cattle of the
[39:26] field all the Beast of the field he was
[39:29] the top there was no one there was no
[39:32] one any higher than the human being and
[39:36] God now Satan has anointed him and he is
[39:39] he's talking perversely to her and
[39:42] trying to uh uh to to to break the word
[39:46] of the Lord now let's just go on this
[39:48] Beast was so close to human and yet pure
[39:50] animal that he could reason and talk he
[39:53] was an upright creature and was somewhat
[39:55] in between a chimpanzee and a man but
[39:57] closer to a man he was so close to human
[40:00] that his seed could and did mingle with
[40:03] that of the woman and cause her to
[40:04] conceive when this happened God cursed
[40:06] the serpent he changed every bone in the
[40:10] Serpent's body so that he had to crawl
[40:12] like a snake science can try all it
[40:15] wants to and it won't find the missing
[40:18] link God saw to that man is smart he can
[40:22] see an association of man uh of man with
[40:25] animal and he tries to prove it out of
[40:27] EV Evolution there isn't any Evolution
[40:29] but man and animal did mingle that's one
[40:32] of the Mysteries that God has remained
[40:34] hidden uh but here it is revealed it
[40:36] happened right back there in the midst
[40:38] of the Eden when Eve turned away from
[40:40] life to accept death now what God said
[40:44] to them in the garden uh notice what God
[40:47] said to them in the garden Genesis 3:15
[40:50] I will put enmity between thee and the
[40:52] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[40:55] and it shall bruise thine head head and
[40:58] thou shalt bruise his heel if we give
[41:01] credit to the word the woman did have a
[41:04] seed then the serpent must have surely a
[41:08] seed also if the seed of the woman was a
[41:11] male child apart from the man then the
[41:15] seed of the serpent will have to be in
[41:17] the same pattern that in that is another
[41:20] male must be born apart from human male
[41:24] instrumentality uh there is no student
[41:26] who does not know that the seed of the
[41:28] woman was the Christ can you can you say
[41:30] Amen to that amen no student who does
[41:34] not know that the seed of the woman was
[41:36] Christ who came by the instrumentality
[41:39] of God apart from Human intercourse it
[41:41] is just as well known that the predicted
[41:44] bruising of the Serpent's head was in
[41:46] actuality a prophecy concerning what
[41:49] Christ would accomplish against Satan at
[41:52] the cross there at the cross Christ was
[41:55] bruised uh Christ would would bruise the
[41:57] head of the of Satan while Satan would
[42:00] bruise the heel of the Lord this portion
[42:03] of the scripture is the revelation of
[42:04] how the literal seed of the serpent was
[42:06] sown in in the earth even as we have the
[42:09] account in Luke 1:
[42:12] 26-35 wherein it set forth the exact
[42:15] account of how the serpent or the seed
[42:18] of the woman came into physical
[42:19] manifestation apart from the
[42:21] instrumentality of the human male in the
[42:24] sixth month of the Angel G Gabriel or in
[42:28] the sixth month the angel Gabriel sent
[42:30] from God unto a city of Galilee named
[42:34] Nazareth to a virgin espouse to a man
[42:38] whose name was Joseph of the House of
[42:40] David and the virgin's name was Mary and
[42:43] the angel came in unto her and said hell
[42:47] Thou Art highly favored and the Lord is
[42:51] with thee blessed art thou among women
[42:55] when she saw him she was trouble at his
[42:58] saying and cast in her mind what manner
[43:00] of salutation this should be and the
[43:03] angel said unto her fear not Mary for
[43:07] thou has found favor with God behold
[43:10] Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[43:13] bring forth a son and thou shalt call
[43:16] his name Jesus and he shall be great and
[43:19] shall be called the son of the highest
[43:22] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[43:25] Throne of his father David and he he
[43:27] shall reign over the house of Jacob
[43:28] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[43:31] be no end then said Mary unto the angel
[43:35] how shall this thing be seeing I know
[43:38] not a man in other words I'm not married
[43:41] and the angel said unto her the Holy
[43:44] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[43:48] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[43:51] therefore also the holy thing which was
[43:54] born of thee shall be called the Son of
[43:58] God now as the seed of the woman was
[44:01] literally God producing himself in a
[44:03] human flesh so the seed of the serpent
[44:07] is literal is the literal way that Satan
[44:10] found his uh found he was able to open
[44:14] the door to himself into the human race
[44:17] it was impossible for Satan for he is
[44:20] only a created spirit being to reproduce
[44:24] himself in the manner which God
[44:26] reproduced himself self so the Genesis
[44:28] account tells how he produced his seed
[44:32] and introduced or interjected himself
[44:35] into the human race also recall that
[44:38] Satan is called the serpent it is his
[44:41] seed or injection into the human race
[44:44] that we are speaking of now before Adam
[44:47] ever had a carnal knowledge of Eve the
[44:49] serpent had the knowledge ahead of him
[44:53] now watch that the serpent had the
[44:56] knowledge
[44:57] ahead of him all right and that one born
[45:02] of it was Cain Cain was uh born of
[45:07] begotten of that Wicked one 1 John 34 uh
[45:11] 3:12 the holy spirit in John could not
[45:14] even uh could not in one place call Adam
[45:17] the wicked
[45:18] one uh for that is what he would be if
[45:22] heaed Cain and in another place called
[45:25] Adam the son of God which he was by
[45:29] creation Luke 33 Luke 3:38 Cain turned
[45:33] out in the character of like his father
[45:36] a bringer of death a murderer his utter
[45:39] Defiance of God when faced by the
[45:42] almighty in Genesis 4 and 5 verse uh 4
[45:46] verse 5 verse 9 verse 13 and 14 show him
[45:51] to be absolutely unhuman likee in
[45:54] characteristics seeming even to surpass
[45:57] any account we have in scripture
[45:59] concerning a confrontation of Satan by
[46:02] God now we read but unto Cain and to his
[46:06] offering he had not respect and Cain was
[46:09] very wroth and his countenance fell and
[46:11] the Lord said unto Cain where is thy
[46:13] brother and he said I know not am I My
[46:17] Brother's Keeper and Cain said unto the
[46:19] Lord my punishment is greater than I can
[46:22] bear behold thou has driven me out this
[46:24] day from the face of the Earth and from
[46:27] thy face shall I be hid I shall be a
[46:29] fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and
[46:32] it shall come to pass that everyone that
[46:33] findeth me shall slay me now now this is
[46:38] this is he's he's he's he's he's
[46:40] resisting God he's he's been a smart
[46:42] elic with God God's asking him where his
[46:44] brother is I don't know him I'm a
[46:45] Brother's Keeper and then when God gives
[46:47] him the punishment now he's turning it
[46:49] on God and saying H now here I am you're
[46:52] driving me away and you're there's no
[46:54] repentance it's it's it's you're doing
[46:56] this to me you're you see what I'm
[46:58] saying he's very very
[47:01] very um indifferent with God now it says
[47:06] notice the exact way the record of God
[47:09] sets forth the account of the births of
[47:11] Cain Abel and Seth Genesis 4 1 and 2 and
[47:16] Adam knew his wife now I want you to
[47:19] catch that knew his wife once now watch
[47:22] this and she conceived and bear Cain and
[47:26] said I gotten a man from the Lord and
[47:28] she again bear his uh brother Abel now
[47:34] Genesis 4:25 and Abel or and Adam knew
[47:37] his wife again and she bare a son and
[47:41] called his name Seth there are three
[47:44] sons born from two acts of carnal
[47:47] knowledge by Adam since the Bible is the
[47:50] exact and perfect word of God there is
[47:52] no mistake but a record for our
[47:55] illumination since three Three Sons were
[47:57] bornn from two acts by Adam you know
[48:02] positively that one of those three was
[48:05] not the son of Adam God has recorded
[48:09] this in the exact manner to show us
[48:12] something the truth of the matter is
[48:15] that Eve had in her womb two sons twins
[48:20] from separate impregnations she was
[48:23] carrying twins with s with Cain's
[48:26] conception
[48:27] sometime previous to that of Abels so
[48:30] those twins again see those twins again
[48:34] the perfect type as always to those who
[48:36] think that this is not possible let it
[48:39] be known that their medical records are
[48:40] replete with cares with cases where
[48:43] women have carried twins who were of
[48:46] separate OVA and separate uh
[48:49] insemination with the fertilization of
[48:51] the eggs being days apart not only so
[48:55] but some of the records show that the
[48:56] Twins were fed by separate males recent
[49:00] uh recently worldwide coverage was given
[49:02] to a Norwegian mother who was suing her
[49:05] husband for support for herself and her
[49:08] twins one of which was White and the
[49:10] other black she admitted that she had a
[49:14] negro lover the two conceptions were
[49:18] about 3 weeks apart in Bowmont Texas
[49:21] 1963 the records again set forth a
[49:24] multiple birth where in pregnancies were
[49:26] many days apart in fact so much so that
[49:30] the woman almost died with the one
[49:33] child in child birth now everyone uh uh
[49:38] everyone okay from here where we're at
[49:41] amen so so we can understand here we got
[49:45] it Tree of Life tree of
[49:49] death God's way for life was going to be
[49:53] to speak the womb into the womb of the
[49:55] woman to bring Eternal to keep life and
[50:00] and and there would never it would it
[50:02] would be we would all be born basically
[50:05] uh like Jesus came to the Earth amen we
[50:08] would there there wouldn't be no U uh
[50:11] but there'd be no sorrow there'd be none
[50:13] of those things we would be speaking uh
[50:15] word life into existence now um but but
[50:20] because we listen to Satan because Eve
[50:24] listened to Satan he gave her a more a
[50:29] more pretty way he came with knowledge
[50:32] and said listen hey you're created
[50:35] beautifully you're created to produce
[50:38] hey do you realize and he began to sweet
[50:41] talk this woman seduced her and had a
[50:45] baby with her now now again it's not
[50:49] it's not a snake having sex with a woman
[50:52] and it's not the devil having sex with a
[50:54] woman that's not possible amen but the
[50:57] Beast was a manlike creature that was so
[51:03] close to the human life can you say amen
[51:07] amen and and this is where we are today
[51:10] are we doing all right so far any
[51:13] questions all right well let's go on
[51:17] Amen now if I get U it says now why did
[51:21] why did this have to be so why was it
[51:25] the seed of the serpent
[51:27] uh must come this way Man was created
[51:31] for God man was to be the temple of God
[51:36] the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit
[51:38] was man the temple now catch that man
[51:43] the temple God created man to be his
[51:49] Temple acts 746 through 51 who found
[51:54] favor before God and desired to find a t
[51:56] Tabernacle for the god of Jacob but
[51:59] Solomon built him in house how be it the
[52:01] most high dwelleth not in temples made
[52:02] with hands as saith the prophet Heaven
[52:05] is my throne and Earth is my foot stol
[52:09] what house will you build me sayith the
[52:10] Lord or what is the place of my rest
[52:13] hath not my hand made all these things
[52:16] you stiff necked and uncircumcised in
[52:18] heart and ears you do always resist the
[52:20] Holy Ghost as your fathers did Satan has
[52:23] known this all along he also so wants to
[52:27] indwell man even as God so does but God
[52:31] is reserved to himself that right Satan
[52:34] cannot do that God Alone appeared in
[52:37] human flesh Satan could not and cannot
[52:40] do that he does not have the creative
[52:43] Powers the only way Satan uh for Satan
[52:47] to accomplish what he wanted to do was
[52:49] to enter in enter the serpent in Eden
[52:53] even as he entered by evil spirits into
[52:56] the
[52:57] swine at G gadara God does not enter uh
[53:01] God does not enter animals but Satan can
[53:04] and will to accomplish his ends he could
[53:07] not have a child directly by Eve as God
[53:11] did by Mary so he entered into the
[53:14] serpent and then beguiled Eve and she
[53:18] and he seduced her by her did Satan have
[53:22] a child vicariously Cain bore the full
[53:25] spiritual characteristic of Satan and
[53:27] the animalistic sensual fleshly
[53:29] characteristics of the serpent no wonder
[53:32] the holy spirit said that Cain was of
[53:35] that Wicked one he
[53:38] was amen all right so how are we doing
[53:41] amen any anything anyone wants to
[53:46] add I had a
[53:51] question
[53:55] brother
[54:04] yeah I always thought that we're at that
[54:07] that's what it comes into my mind yeah
[54:08] and so it blew me away because I know
[54:10] Prophet God is the truth yeah but I just
[54:14] thought well you know there there there
[54:17] is a difference in um in in
[54:21] possessing and um and then
[54:24] influencing God Came Upon that donkey
[54:27] and and used him but God did not enter
[54:29] in because remember the Holy Ghost could
[54:32] not even enter into none of those
[54:33] prophets so you God cannot enter into
[54:37] anything unclean he enters into us
[54:41] because of the blood of Jesus Christ so
[54:44] therefore we could receive the Holy
[54:46] Ghost but but on the but but to even the
[54:49] prophets the prophets the Holy Ghost
[54:51] didn't enter into they he they just it
[54:54] was an anointing that Came Upon them and
[54:56] so that was to uh that's that's what
[54:58] that's what had to have happened there
[55:01] yeah it was the anointing upon them
[55:07] speaking
[55:12] huh I don't guess I know what that word
[55:25] is
[55:29] okay
[55:33] between yeah okay so so let's you see
[55:36] that's the thing that that's the reason
[55:39] why that they're saying that there is an
[55:42] evolution and to them the missing link
[55:45] they're still trying to find that and
[55:47] and and and I have some pictures here
[55:50] that but they wouldn't have been they
[55:51] wouldn't have been decent for the uh for
[55:54] our audience here tonight but you know
[55:55] we're
[55:57] their the evolution guys are saying okay
[55:59] so so here it's came came came came here
[56:01] so you've got you've got the monkey and
[56:03] then you've got it on up then you then
[56:04] you got the chimpanzee and then they've
[56:06] got this big question mark and then and
[56:09] then here comes the human and then
[56:10] here's the man and so they're trying
[56:15] they're trying to figure that out but
[56:17] the Bible declares what that was there
[56:21] truly was there truly was one between
[56:25] the chimpanze and the man yes but you'll
[56:29] never find that one because he was put
[56:32] on his belly he was stripped of his
[56:34] hands and his feet and his legs and so
[56:37] now uh you you'll never you'll never
[56:40] even come close to finding that serpent
[56:44] that serpent was was a was a a giant of
[56:49] a
[56:50] man um 8 nine 10 10t tall he was a giant
[56:55] he was a giant of a man but yet he was
[56:58] he was uh he had Beauty he was able to
[57:01] talk he could communicate with with Eve
[57:05] and he literally talked her in to
[57:09] believing him over the words of her
[57:12] husband and so again there's there and
[57:16] and and and you know that's the reason
[57:18] why that's the reason why our Prophet
[57:20] said don't you let Satan talk you out of
[57:23] one word of this Bible no not one word
[57:26] of this Bible because that's what Eve
[57:30] done Eve according to the prophet Eve
[57:35] had already
[57:36] fallen before the physical act had
[57:39] already taken place she fell because she
[57:43] believed that serpent over the word of
[57:45] God her nature changed before that even
[57:48] took
[57:49] place that's what he said so so then it
[57:53] it sold the rest of us in and she
[57:55] followed she she you know of course we
[57:58] we'll read on that so does that answer
[57:59] your question so we're not we're it's
[58:02] it's this is not Evolution no Evolution
[58:05] at all but right here we've got what
[58:08] science is looking for what they are
[58:11] trying to find they'll never be able to
[58:13] find because but God's hit it right here
[58:15] in the scripture this is what they're
[58:18] looking for any other questions real
[58:23] quick all right I want cuz I want us to
[58:26] I I want us all to to be on the same
[58:28] page
[58:29] here okay um all right let's start there
[58:33] at that next paragraph now I want to go
[58:35] into a certain proof that we have that
[58:38] there is a definite Infinity between man
[58:41] and animal now brother bandam is fixing
[58:43] a show he's he's going to show us now um
[58:46] H how
[58:47] that they can interact it is a physical
[58:50] thing do you know that you can take
[58:53] embryo cells from an unborn fetus and
[58:56] he's talking about an animal and inject
[58:59] them into human beings then those
[59:02] thyroid cells will go right to the human
[59:05] thyroid the kidney cells will go right
[59:07] to the human kidneys do you realize how
[59:10] stupendous this is some intelligence
[59:13] guides those animal cells exactly to the
[59:16] right place that intelligence accepts
[59:19] those cells and puts them in exactly the
[59:22] right place there is an Infinity between
[59:25] animal and man
[59:26] they can't
[59:28] intermingle and and reproduce that has
[59:30] been tried but in the garden that
[59:34] intermingling did take place and the
[59:36] chemical Infinity which still exists
[59:39] proves it for back in Eden the serpent
[59:43] was an upright creature he was close to
[59:46] man he was almost man Satan took
[59:49] advantage of the serpent of the
[59:51] Serpent's physical
[59:53] characteristics took advantage of the
[59:56] Serpent's physical he took advantage of
[59:58] the Ser physical
[1:00:00] characteristics to uh use to use him to
[1:00:05] beguile Eve then God destroyed the
[1:00:08] pattern of that serpent no other Beast
[1:00:11] can commingle with man but the infinity
[1:00:14] is there now that we have come this far
[1:00:18] let me try to crystallize your thinking
[1:00:20] on this subject so you can see the
[1:00:22] necessity of our going into the serpent
[1:00:24] Seed doctrine as I have we start with
[1:00:26] the fact that there are there were two
[1:00:28] trees in the midst of the garden the
[1:00:30] tree of life with Jesus the other tree
[1:00:33] is definitely Satan because that is what
[1:00:36] came forth of the fruit of that
[1:00:39] tree now then we we know that both of
[1:00:43] these trees had relationship to man or
[1:00:47] they would never have been placed there
[1:00:49] so y'all yall catching there now this is
[1:00:51] this is this is so important now so
[1:00:53] we've got Christ we've got Satan
[1:00:56] and their and and and their Christ
[1:01:00] created man to have dominion oh if we
[1:01:04] could understand what the Holy Ghost has
[1:01:05] done to us today when you receive that
[1:01:07] new birth Christ has Authority back in
[1:01:12] his church that's what he created you
[1:01:15] for the only thing that keeps us from
[1:01:18] from really coming to our fullest
[1:01:20] potential is is a faith to really step
[1:01:23] out and to believe God to believe that
[1:01:26] God's created me for this purpose that's
[1:01:29] right those scriptures that are put in
[1:01:30] there that said whatsoever things you
[1:01:32] say you can have that was what God gave
[1:01:36] adam amen that's what God gave Adam's uh
[1:01:39] to to his sons Adam's race and that's
[1:01:42] what the new birth is to restore us back
[1:01:45] to today sometimes we go on emotions and
[1:01:47] feelings and things that's then it all
[1:01:49] comes with it but that's not the Holy
[1:01:50] Ghost the Holy Ghost is the Dominion
[1:01:52] that he's given in you to stand up and
[1:01:55] take authority over God's word or o over
[1:01:58] over Satan's kingdom and whatever he
[1:02:00] wants you to rule and Reign here on this
[1:02:02] Earth he wants that even now that's why
[1:02:05] he says you'll lay hands on the sick you
[1:02:07] will can you say amen amen now he says
[1:02:13] um okay so we start with the fact that
[1:02:15] there are two trees in the garden the
[1:02:17] tree of life with Jesus the other tree
[1:02:19] is definitely Satan because there was
[1:02:22] there came forth fruit of that
[1:02:24] tree um they must have had part in The
[1:02:27] Sovereign plan and purpose of God and
[1:02:28] their relationship to
[1:02:30] Mankind and to himself or we could never
[1:02:34] impute omniscience to
[1:02:36] God uh this is all true so far is it not
[1:02:39] now the word most definitely sets forth
[1:02:42] that from the before the foundation of
[1:02:45] the Earth the purpose of God was to
[1:02:47] share his eternal life with man
[1:02:50] Ephesians 1 4-11 according as he has
[1:02:53] chosen Us in him before for the
[1:02:56] foundation of the world that we should
[1:02:58] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:03:01] love having predestinated us unto the
[1:03:05] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:03:07] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:03:10] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:03:12] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[1:03:15] accepted in the Beloved in whom we have
[1:03:17] Redemption through his blood the
[1:03:19] forgiveness of sin according to the
[1:03:21] riches of his grace wherein he hath
[1:03:24] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:03:26] prudence and having made known unto us
[1:03:28] the mystery of his will according to his
[1:03:30] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:03:32] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:03:35] fullness of times he might gather
[1:03:38] together in one all things in Christ
[1:03:40] both which are in heaven which are on
[1:03:43] earth even in him whom also we have
[1:03:46] obtained an inheritance being
[1:03:49] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:03:51] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:03:54] counsel of his own will and then in
[1:03:57] Revelations 13:8 it says all that dwell
[1:04:00] upon the Earth shall worship him Satan
[1:04:02] whose names are not written in the Book
[1:04:05] of Life of the lamb slain before the
[1:04:07] foundation of the
[1:04:08] world but that life could not and would
[1:04:12] not be shared in any other way than
[1:04:16] through the way of God manifest In the
[1:04:19] Flesh this was a part of his eternal and
[1:04:22] predestinated purpose this plan was to
[1:04:25] be to the praise of the glory of his
[1:04:27] grace it was the Plan of Redemption it
[1:04:30] was the Plan of Salvation now listen
[1:04:33] closely God being a savior it was
[1:04:36] necessary that he predestinate a man who
[1:04:39] would require salvation in order to give
[1:04:42] himself reason and purpose of being I
[1:04:45] love that this is 100% correct
[1:04:49] multitudes of scriptures bear it out as
[1:04:52] does the very pointed verse of
[1:04:54] Revelations or Romans
[1:04:57] 11:36 for of him and through him and to
[1:05:02] him are all things to whom be glory
[1:05:06] forever amen man could not directly come
[1:05:10] and partake of that uh Tree of Life in
[1:05:13] the midst of the garden that eternal
[1:05:16] life of that tree had to become flesh
[1:05:18] first but before God could raise and
[1:05:21] save a sinner he had to have a sinner to
[1:05:24] raise and save man had to fall The Fall
[1:05:29] which was caused which would be caused
[1:05:31] by Satan had to have flesh to make fall
[1:05:35] Satan had to come through flesh also but
[1:05:39] Satan could not through human flesh to
[1:05:41] make the fall as would Christ come in
[1:05:44] the human flesh to restore the Fallen
[1:05:46] but there was an animal the serpent so
[1:05:49] close to that Satan uh so close to man
[1:05:53] that Satan would get to that Beast and
[1:05:55] through that
[1:05:57] Beast would get to the human flesh and
[1:06:01] cause this fall and inject himself into
[1:06:04] the human race even as Jesus would one
[1:06:07] day come and inject himself into the
[1:06:09] human race into human bodies even to the
[1:06:12] extent of a resurrection wherein we
[1:06:15] would have bodies like unto his
[1:06:17] glorified one
[1:06:18] Hallelujah thus what God worked out here
[1:06:21] in the garden was his predestinated plan
[1:06:24] and when Satan brought about that which
[1:06:26] was necessary to the purpose of God then
[1:06:29] man could not get to the Tree of Life In
[1:06:32] The Garden certainly not it wasn't time
[1:06:36] but an animal animal had the cause the
[1:06:39] animal had caused the
[1:06:41] fall uh had it not let animal life be
[1:06:46] shed and uh see but an animal was taken
[1:06:49] and his Bloodshed then God had communion
[1:06:53] with man
[1:06:54] again there was to come a day when God
[1:06:57] would appear in flesh and by means of
[1:06:59] his humiliation he would restore Fallen
[1:07:02] man and make him a partaker of that life
[1:07:06] eternal once you see this you can
[1:07:09] understand the serpent seed now and know
[1:07:12] that it was no apple Eve ate no it was
[1:07:15] the degradation of humanity by the
[1:07:18] intermingling of the seed amen y'all
[1:07:21] y'all understand am I am I reading too
[1:07:24] fast all right
[1:07:27] amen so that that that was very
[1:07:30] beautiful that that's powerful brother
[1:07:33] Bram showing how that the purpose of God
[1:07:36] manifested and let me just say this even
[1:07:39] sometimes we get we get upset with
[1:07:41] ourselves because we've got we've we've
[1:07:44] got that seed predestinated seed on the
[1:07:46] inside of us and many times we fail many
[1:07:49] times we come short and and and we we
[1:07:52] get so disheartened but just remember
[1:07:55] Even in our failures the way we have our
[1:07:58] failures God's grace is still so
[1:08:01] exhibited in and through you God
[1:08:04] bringing you out of the hospital that's
[1:08:06] showing his love and mercy amen God God
[1:08:10] restoring you and forgiving you and
[1:08:12] giving you Grace to get up and press the
[1:08:14] battle that is that that is a reflection
[1:08:18] of the kindness of the heart of God for
[1:08:21] you don't it's it's God's pleasure to
[1:08:24] love you
[1:08:26] it's God's honor to love you this is
[1:08:28] what God allowed you to be birthed in
[1:08:31] this kind of a condition in the first
[1:08:33] place so he could show you that despite
[1:08:36] yourself and despite your Frailty and
[1:08:39] despite your
[1:08:41] weaknesses his love will win out that's
[1:08:45] your time to say
[1:08:46] hallelujah his love will win out
[1:08:51] hallelujah amen all right y'all ready to
[1:08:53] go on any questions
[1:08:56] so so you're understanding two Spirits
[1:09:00] the two Spirits like I was trying to
[1:09:01] tell you you've got life God's word
[1:09:03] you've got knowledge Satan trying to
[1:09:06] explain what every oh my and and and and
[1:09:09] that's the reason why uh on on Sunday I
[1:09:12] was you know I was telling you kids amen
[1:09:15] listen and especially for you you young
[1:09:17] you young ones that are that are coming
[1:09:19] in and developing your habits you know
[1:09:22] you you you you've got to look at God's
[1:09:24] word amen you've got to look at God's
[1:09:27] word prayer life must be an absolute the
[1:09:30] Bible study must be an absolute Church
[1:09:32] attendance must be an absolute now does
[1:09:35] does everyone in the church going to
[1:09:36] follow that no no no they don't have
[1:09:38] those kinds of principles but you can
[1:09:42] and you must they'll give an account
[1:09:44] before God on that day for for whatever
[1:09:47] verse whatever scriptures that they want
[1:09:48] to just minimize but I'm saying for you
[1:09:52] young people if if we go another gener
[1:09:55] eration you you you watch you watch the
[1:09:58] generation that that that that just
[1:09:59] minimizes this when they want to admin
[1:10:02] the the next generation is going to
[1:10:03] follow that follow what they think is
[1:10:07] right or they're going to follow life
[1:10:09] right and that's why it's important I
[1:10:12] Don't Preach Church attendance and those
[1:10:14] kinds of things to change people it's
[1:10:16] not going to change them it will I
[1:10:19] cannot change anybody and if they ain't
[1:10:21] been changed they'll never be changed
[1:10:23] but what I am saying there is a Young
[1:10:26] Generation that is coming up and you've
[1:10:29] got to choose yourself
[1:10:35] life and if this old man decides to go
[1:10:38] do whatever he wants to do I hope my
[1:10:41] grandchildren won't follow me follow
[1:10:46] life don't follow a man and say well Dad
[1:10:49] does it Grandpa does it this one no no
[1:10:52] no no no follow the word word am stay
[1:10:57] with that word because you will give an
[1:11:01] account before God someday make it your
[1:11:04] conviction that's right that's I'm never
[1:11:07] going to change anybody and I want to
[1:11:09] tell
[1:11:11] you you you you old ones that setting
[1:11:13] your ways you're setting your ways and I
[1:11:15] can show you scripture and a lot of you
[1:11:17] might might have seen scripture after
[1:11:18] scripture after scripture and you're not
[1:11:20] going to change amen until you are
[1:11:23] changed until you're willing to stand
[1:11:25] and say okay this old man has got some
[1:11:28] attitude problems or this old woman has
[1:11:30] got has has got some Faith problems
[1:11:32] whatever we've got to choose that and
[1:11:36] you will but I'm telling you this next
[1:11:38] this this young crop you choose it right
[1:11:42] now choose to believe God regardless
[1:11:45] right now while you're young because you
[1:11:47] ain't got a lot of years that's already
[1:11:49] pulled you this way right amen and so I
[1:11:54] think this teaching is is so important

[1:12:00] life amen all
[1:12:02] right let's see where are we at now we
[1:12:05] on the um 104 and the first
[1:12:10] paragraph it says
[1:12:12] now I know in answering one
[1:12:17] question another question or another one
[1:12:19] is apt to come up and people ask me if
[1:12:22] he fell that way what did Adam do for
[1:12:26] God lays blame on
[1:12:28] Adam this is simple the word of God is
[1:12:31] forever settled in heaven before one
[1:12:33] Speck of stardus was made that word
[1:12:37] God's law was exactly as it is written
[1:12:40] in our Bible now the word teaches us
[1:12:43] that if a woman leaves her husband and
[1:12:45] goes with another man she is an
[1:12:47] adulteress and she is and is no longer
[1:12:50] married and the husband is not to take
[1:12:52] her back that word was true in Eden as
[1:12:56] it was true when Moses wrote it in the
[1:12:58] law the word can't change Adam took her
[1:13:02] back he knew exactly what he was doing
[1:13:05] but he did it anyways she was part of
[1:13:08] him he was willing to take her
[1:13:10] responsibility upon himself and he would
[1:13:13] not let her go so Eve conceived by him
[1:13:18] he knew she would he knew exactly what
[1:13:21] would happen to the human race he sold
[1:13:24] the human race into sin that he might
[1:13:27] have Eve for he loved her and those two
[1:13:31] sons were born sons that would be
[1:13:34] fathers of the human race was uh that
[1:13:37] was even now polluted and what does the
[1:13:39] record say of them read the record John
[1:13:42] uh Jude 14 and Enoch also the seventh
[1:13:46] from Adam prophesied Genesis 5 is is the
[1:13:51] chapter of genology of Enoch it gives
[1:13:54] the Gen ology lesle number one Adam two
[1:13:58] Seth three enus four Canaan five
[1:14:05] Mahal six Jared seven Enoch notice that
[1:14:10] Cain is not mentioned the time or the
[1:14:14] line of Adam goes through Seth if Cain
[1:14:18] were the child of Adam the law of the
[1:14:20] birthright would have given Cain the
[1:14:23] right in the lineage also it must be
[1:14:26] noted carefully that in Genesis 5 and3
[1:14:30] it says that men that Adam lived in 130
[1:14:34] years and beget a son of his own
[1:14:37] likeness remember that a son of his own
[1:14:38] likeness after his image and called his
[1:14:41] name Seth nowhere does it say that Cain
[1:14:45] was in Adam's likeness yet he would have
[1:14:49] to be if he were his son for the law of
[1:14:53] reproduction is emphatically
[1:14:55] that each brings forth after its kind it
[1:14:59] must also credit the fact that in both
[1:15:02] genealogies genealogies in Genesis and
[1:15:04] Luke Cain is missing if Cain were the
[1:15:08] son of Adam it would be said of him
[1:15:11] somewhere that Cain was the son of Adam
[1:15:14] which was the son of God it does not say
[1:15:17] that for it cannot say that of course
[1:15:21] students for a long time have set forth
[1:15:24] to lines of men one of which was The
[1:15:27] Godly line found in Seth and the other
[1:15:30] the ungodly line founded by Cain it is
[1:15:34] strange but true these same students
[1:15:36] have never told us how it was that Cain
[1:15:40] was the kind of person he uh he was
[1:15:42] while Abel and Seth were of the
[1:15:44] spiritual Godly line
[1:15:48] factually Cain uh should have been
[1:15:51] spiritual and Abel less spiritual Seth
[1:15:55] even more so right on Down the Line
[1:15:57] because each succeeding generation has
[1:16:00] gotten uh has always gotten further away
[1:16:02] from God but no Cain comes as a wicked
[1:16:06] as wicked as no man ever has been
[1:16:09] described for he violently was
[1:16:11] understands God and the word now let
[1:16:13] this be known scripture does not play
[1:16:16] with words whatever is in the record is
[1:16:19] there for the anointed eye to see it is
[1:16:23] there for a purpose in that word it says
[1:16:26] Genesis 3:20 Adam called his wife's name
[1:16:29] Eve because she is the mother of what
[1:16:33] all living but nowhere or but no
[1:16:37] scripture ever says that Adam is the
[1:16:40] father of all living if there is not
[1:16:44] this connotation to be placed see if
[1:16:47] there if there is not this connotation
[1:16:49] to be placed in Genesis 3:20 why would
[1:16:52] it be mentioned that Eve is the mother
[1:16:54] of all and no word said about Adam the
[1:16:58] fact is that though Eve was the mother
[1:17:00] of all living Adam was not the father of
[1:17:03] all living in Genesis 4 And1 Eve said I
[1:17:07] have gotten a man from the Lord she does
[1:17:10] not credit Adam with the fatherhood of
[1:17:12] Cain but in Genesis 4:25 she says for
[1:17:18] God uh sayth she hath appointed another
[1:17:23] seed uh instead of Abel which Cain slew
[1:17:27] she does not say that God had given her
[1:17:29] another seed that would have been Christ
[1:17:32] for he is
[1:17:34] given this son Seth was the appointed
[1:17:37] seed instead of Abel she recognized her
[1:17:40] son that came by Adam she does not
[1:17:43] recognize uh Cain for he came by The
[1:17:46] Serpent and when she says another seed
[1:17:49] instead of Abel she was saying that Cain
[1:17:53] was different from Abel for if they were
[1:17:56] of the same father she would have said I
[1:17:59] have been given some more seed I don't
[1:18:02] believe anything I I I read uh I don't
[1:18:05] believe everything that I read but it is
[1:18:08] certainly a curious thing that March 1
[1:18:11] 1963 issue of Life reports the
[1:18:13] psychiatrist as saying exactly the same
[1:18:16] thing that we're
[1:18:18] discussing now I know that all psychist
[1:18:22] psychiatrists don't agree with each
[1:18:24] other but here it is the fear of snakes
[1:18:27] is not a conscious revulsion but an
[1:18:30] unconscious one if it were natural a
[1:18:33] natural fear people would just as
[1:18:36] happily stand fascinated before the
[1:18:37] gorilla or lion cages their unconscious
[1:18:40] thoughts would keep them staring at
[1:18:42] snakes The
[1:18:44] lure that lure of the snake is
[1:18:47] unconsciously sexual that has been
[1:18:50] through the ages as seen by the people
[1:18:52] in generation after generation going
[1:18:54] through the same thing snakes have
[1:18:56] always been always will be repulsively
[1:18:59] attract attractive the snake has always
[1:19:02] stood for that which is both good and
[1:19:05] bad it has been uh has been a filic
[1:19:10] symbol Through the Ages just exactly as
[1:19:14] the Garden of Eden description we find
[1:19:17] the serpent personification of
[1:19:19] passionate evil it is almost Universal
[1:19:22] among the various uncultured tribes uh
[1:19:25] tribes that the snake is associated with
[1:19:27] sex and often worshiped in conjunction
[1:19:30] with it the study of sexology brings
[1:19:33] that out in many
[1:19:34] instances now I would like to show where
[1:19:37] these people got that from saying they
[1:19:39] are uneducated and never read the Bible
[1:19:42] but even as the story of the flood is
[1:19:45] known throughout the world so is the
[1:19:48] truth of the fall of Man known they knew
[1:19:51] what happened there in Eden amen now are
[1:19:55] you are you catching that so far so it's
[1:19:58] it's it's it's uh uh even the world
[1:20:03] knows that the world sees that amen now
[1:20:08] we're going to go right on in uh again
[1:20:10] we read this earlier but we're going to
[1:20:12] um we're going to come through this they
[1:20:14] knew what happened in our in Eden now
[1:20:17] right here someone is going to ask me
[1:20:19] this question did God tell Eve to watch
[1:20:23] out for the serpent or the serpent would
[1:20:25] seduce her now listen God didn't have to
[1:20:28] say one thing about what would happen
[1:20:30] just skip the point of the story he
[1:20:33] simply gave the word he said not to
[1:20:38] partake of knowledge partake of life
[1:20:42] life was the word of God death was
[1:20:45] anything contrary or anything that
[1:20:48] wasn't the word of God how many got how
[1:20:51] many gets that I want you to catch that
[1:20:54] now death is anything contrary to God's
[1:21:00] word oh and if the holy spirit is in our
[1:21:03] hearts the holy spirit is to direct us
[1:21:06] and tell us now there's there's a lot of
[1:21:07] things that's not going to be directly
[1:21:09] in the Bible we're we're going you know
[1:21:10] we're going around today in just this
[1:21:12] cess pool of leay Osa but I believe the
[1:21:15] holy spirit that that Holy Spirit is
[1:21:17] there to guide us that tree of life is
[1:21:20] there to guide us we're going to set
[1:21:22] before that tree of life on that day but
[1:21:23] right now we've got his spirit that is
[1:21:25] that is leading us can you say
[1:21:28] Amen she allowed one word to be changed
[1:21:31] and right then Satan had her God had
[1:21:34] could have said don't pick more of the
[1:21:36] fruit of the trees than you can eat and
[1:21:38] Satan could say look that is quite right
[1:21:41] you see if you pick too much it will rot
[1:21:43] but here is a method for serving the
[1:21:45] fruit and and at the same time pick all
[1:21:48] you want so you see you can have your
[1:21:50] way and God's way at the same time the
[1:21:53] devil would have had her right there he
[1:21:56] that is guilty of one point of the law
[1:21:58] hath broken the whole law don't fool
[1:22:01] with that word somebody say don't
[1:22:04] fool with that word I don't care what
[1:22:08] you think I don't care how reasonable
[1:22:11] your way sounds if it's contrary to the
[1:22:14] written word stay away from it amen that
[1:22:19] is exactly what happened in the Ephesian
[1:22:21] age before it ran out in a in 1 70 AD
[1:22:25] what did the tree produce the tree of
[1:22:28] knowledge produced death Cain killed his
[1:22:31] brother Abel the wicked killed the
[1:22:33] righteous it is a pattern or it set a
[1:22:36] pattern and it will keep that pattern
[1:22:38] until the restoration of all things as
[1:22:40] spoken by the prophets the tree of
[1:22:43] knowledge produced clever men men of
[1:22:45] renown but their ways are the ways of
[1:22:48] death God's people are simple but
[1:22:51] spiritual minded well that makes me want
[1:22:53] to want to shout simple people God's got
[1:22:55] simple people but spiritual mining
[1:22:58] leaning towards God in nature calmly
[1:23:00] tilling the soil caring for truth rather
[1:23:03] than wealth the seed of the
[1:23:05] serpent has bought tremendous Commerce
[1:23:08] wonderful inventions but it but with it
[1:23:11] all comes death the gunpowder and atomic
[1:23:14] bombs kill in war in the peace time
[1:23:17] their mechanical inventions such as a
[1:23:19] car kill even more in the time of Peace
[1:23:22] than do the inventions of War destroying
[1:23:24] the time of trouble death and
[1:23:26] destruction are the fruit of her labors
[1:23:28] but they are religious they believe in
[1:23:31] God they are like their father the devil
[1:23:33] and their ancestor Cain both of them
[1:23:36] believed in God they go to church they
[1:23:39] mingle with the righteous as do the
[1:23:41] tears mingle with the wheat in in so
[1:23:44] doing they corrupt and produce uh a
[1:23:47] nickan religion they spread their poison
[1:23:49] and effort to destroy the seed of God
[1:23:52] even as Cain killed Lael there there is
[1:23:54] no fear of God Before Their Eyes God
[1:23:57] lose but God loses none of his own
[1:24:00] Hallelujah he keeps them even in death
[1:24:03] and as promised in the day in the last
[1:24:06] day he will raise them up to him that
[1:24:09] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[1:24:11] tree of life which is in the midst of
[1:24:14] the paradise of God what a thrilling
[1:24:16] thought that is the Tree of Life In the
[1:24:18] Garden of Eden which was not could not
[1:24:21] be
[1:24:22] approached unto because of the fall of
[1:24:25] Adam is now given to the Overcomer the
[1:24:28] Flaming sword of the guarding cherubim
[1:24:30] has been sheathed but it is not sheath a
[1:24:33] its blade was Bloody with the blood of
[1:24:35] the Lamb let us meditate upon this truth
[1:24:38] and a while truth a while as we consider
[1:24:41] why the tree was denied to Adam and his
[1:24:43] descendants but now allowed again God's
[1:24:47] intention for his creation man is to
[1:24:51] express his words in Genesis Adam was
[1:24:55] given the word to live by a life lived
[1:24:58] by that word would be the word expressed
[1:25:01] that is that is true is it not but
[1:25:06] Adam but did Adam live by that word no
[1:25:09] because he was to live by every word he
[1:25:12] failed to take heed to every word then
[1:25:15] there arose Moses there was a mighty a
[1:25:18] Great and Mighty Man he was yet he also
[1:25:21] failed to live by every word and the
[1:25:23] prophet the type of the great prophet to
[1:25:25] come failed in Anger to obey the word
[1:25:28] and there was also David the great king
[1:25:30] of Israel a man after God's Own Heart he
[1:25:33] failed by adultery when he was attempted
[1:25:37] he was but eventually in the fullness of
[1:25:38] time there came one the head even Jesus
[1:25:43] who also must be tempted to see if he
[1:25:46] would live by every word that proceeded
[1:25:48] out of the mouth of God and then was
[1:25:50] Satan foiled for here was one who lived
[1:25:55] by it is written and that Masterpiece of
[1:25:58] God overcame the ref by reflecting God's
[1:26:01] word and this then this was manif uh
[1:26:05] then was this manifested perfect one
[1:26:07] given to the Cross as the perfect Lamb
[1:26:10] of God for the perfect sacrifice and on
[1:26:13] the tree he received the wounds of death
[1:26:15] unto death that we by him and because of
[1:26:18] him might eat of the tree of life and
[1:26:21] then the Tree of Life given with an able
[1:26:24] us to overcome and express the word of
[1:26:26] God now to these sons of God who by him
[1:26:29] overcome are given the privilege of
[1:26:32] paradise of God and constant Fellowship
[1:26:34] of Jesus Christ there will never be
[1:26:38] more uh there will never more be any
[1:26:40] separation from him whether he goes his
[1:26:43] bride will golu what he is she shares
[1:26:46] with his beloved he shares with his
[1:26:48] beloved you on a joint a relationship
[1:26:51] the secret things will be revealed the
[1:26:53] dark things things will be made plain we
[1:26:55] shall know as we are known we shall be
[1:26:58] like him this is the heritage of the
[1:27:01] Overcomer who is overcome by the blood
[1:27:04] of the lamb and the word of testimony to
[1:27:07] Jesus Christ how we long for that day
[1:27:10] when the Crooked roads will all be
[1:27:12] straightened we will be with him time
[1:27:15] Without End May that day hasten its
[1:27:18] appearance and may we hasten to obey his
[1:27:21] word and thereby prove our worthiness to
[1:27:23] sh sh his glory he that hath an ear let
[1:27:27] him hear what the spirit sath un the
[1:27:29] churches how tragic it is for the first
[1:27:31] days that did not listen to the spirit
[1:27:34] instead it listened to man but thank God
[1:27:37] in the last day in the last age there
[1:27:40] will be a group rise up the true Bride
[1:27:44] of the last days she will listen to the
[1:27:46] spirit and in the day of gross Darkness
[1:27:50] the light will return by the pure word
[1:27:53] and we will return to the power of
[1:27:56] Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus
[1:28:00] Christ
[1:28:03] amen hallelujah oh how
[1:28:08] glorious how
[1:28:10] wonderful amen Overcomers he's
[1:28:14] overcome amen he conquered us and purged
[1:28:19] us he's living his life through us that
[1:28:22] tree of life is is Among Us the tree of
[1:28:26] knowledge amen is is an incredible tree
[1:28:30] amen man has produced a lot of crazy
[1:28:33] things amen but they'll never produce
[1:28:37] life all right any anybody else uh any
[1:28:40] any questions on
[1:28:42] this praise the Lord any any
[1:28:47] comments
[1:28:53] Hallelujah
[1:29:04] yeah yeah you know I had never I had
[1:29:07] never seen that uh I and I've read this
[1:29:10] so many times but I I think that was new
[1:29:13] to me that was I just read
[1:29:16] it yeah that's right it was an animal
[1:29:19] that sinned and it would be an animal
[1:29:20] give us life until until Christ come to
[1:29:23] Reed
[1:29:24] redeem amen his seed amen praise the
[1:29:29] Lord now now if it was just an apple now
[1:29:33] the rest of the have you kids have y'all
[1:29:35] ever have you kids ever seen the I mean
[1:29:38] when you all think about Adam and Eve
[1:29:40] and the and eating the fruit um in your
[1:29:42] little Bibles does it what does it show
[1:29:46] you anyone ever
[1:29:48] seen do y'all ever read children's
[1:29:50] Bibles
[1:29:53] amen
[1:29:56] huh yeah yeah I I had some pictures I
[1:29:59] was going to I was going to send sis
[1:30:01] claya and I forgot but you know I
[1:30:03] remember as a kid and and um you know it
[1:30:06] had this had this snake hanging out of
[1:30:08] an apple tree and it was over talking
[1:30:12] and telling Eve this is some good stuff
[1:30:15] this is some good stuff and so uh that's
[1:30:20] that's the way that's the way they all
[1:30:22] teach it that's the way they all teach
[1:30:24] it um that's that's the way all religion
[1:30:28] teaches it
[1:30:30] uh snakes don't
[1:30:33] talk they that that that's exactly right
[1:30:36] well okay
[1:30:39] so I like what brother brandom would say
[1:30:41] he he would say if it was an apple that
[1:30:44] brought the sin then we need or if it
[1:30:47] was the Apple that made Eve know that
[1:30:49] she was naked we need to pass the apples
[1:30:51] back around amen amen now we we have a
[1:30:56] lot more we could say on that but I just
[1:30:58] and and and it will be brought in some
[1:31:00] more during on through the church ages U
[1:31:03] but but I thought brother brandom laid a
[1:31:05] real good um uh foundation for that uh
[1:31:08] as we get ready to
[1:31:10] dismiss now God being a good
[1:31:15] God God being a fair God God God is not
[1:31:21] he he he's not going to
[1:31:24] in other words the punishment's got to
[1:31:26] fit the
[1:31:27] crime now I can't see that a good god a
[1:31:32] good a good father that loved his
[1:31:34] children that says all right you eat
[1:31:36] this apple then you're going to then
[1:31:38] you're going to die and um and and and
[1:31:42] and then at the end I'm going to send a
[1:31:44] lot of my own children to
[1:31:48] hell it wasn't it wasn't the fact that
[1:31:53] the Apple was involved it was it was but
[1:31:56] but here's the
[1:31:57] deal Satan was that tree of life or tree
[1:32:01] of
[1:32:02] death he
[1:32:04] knew not the apple he knew that if the
[1:32:08] poisonous breath of Satan got into the
[1:32:12] spirit of man it would kill them that's
[1:32:16] right it was more than just a punishment
[1:32:18] it was God
[1:32:20] saying if you listen if you partake you
[1:32:25] will
[1:32:27] die are you seeing the difference now
[1:32:29] it's not a good loving God saying you
[1:32:31] eat that Apple so help
[1:32:35] me no God knew the spirit of that Wicked
[1:32:38] he had already dealt with him that
[1:32:40] Spirit of that Wicked one if you listen
[1:32:42] to him and you eat of that it'll kill
[1:32:46] you you hear you see what I'm saying so
[1:32:50] so and and and then so that's number one
[1:32:53] but when when so when God gave the
[1:32:55] punishment look at the punishment when
[1:32:58] God gave the punishment unto Eve the he
[1:33:01] did not curse her mouth for eating an
[1:33:05] apple he cursed her
[1:33:10] womb because she listened to the voice
[1:33:14] of that serpent that's right and done
[1:33:17] what God said not to
[1:33:20] do are are y'all understanding so so her
[1:33:23] he didn't curse her mouth he cursed her
[1:33:27] womb and said in sorrow thou wil
[1:33:30] conceive and thou shall have so so I
[1:33:33] think I I I think that that is that that
[1:33:36] that is uh something that you you got to
[1:33:39] keep in mind and you can see these
[1:33:41] things uh so how many how many
[1:33:43] understands does that does that make it
[1:33:44] real clear on the serpent seed to you
[1:33:45] guys I mean it to me to me the serpent
[1:33:48] seed is
[1:33:50] just it it opens the whole Bible up you
[1:33:53] understand why we needed a virgin birth
[1:33:55] you understand why Christ had to come
[1:33:58] you you understand why we had to be born
[1:34:00] again you understand all of these things
[1:34:03] amen praise the Lord if the musicians
[1:34:04] would come are there any other uh
[1:34:07] questions any any questions from you
[1:34:09] kids uh any any
[1:34:12] questions any any anything that you all
[1:34:15] want to add to it you
[1:34:20] adultss 3020 that that first there kind
[1:34:24] of ties
[1:34:27] in the the adulterous woman yeah yeah
[1:34:32] yeah maybe you can put that up to Sister
[1:34:33] CLE wipes her uh eats
[1:34:37] her yeah such is the way of an
[1:34:40] adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth
[1:34:44] her mouth and saith I have done no
[1:34:48] wickedness and so this is a figurative
[1:34:51] speech going back again this is a fig F
[1:34:53] of speech it's it's it's an adulterous
[1:34:56] woman is a woman that is not living true
[1:34:58] to her vow to her husband and so the
[1:35:02] scripture is is saying she's she's she's
[1:35:05] partaken of the
[1:35:06] fruit wiping her mouth that figuratively
[1:35:10] and saying I have I have done no wrong
[1:35:13] and so uh so yes that is that is that is
[1:35:17] very
[1:35:17] good and to and to even prove and and
[1:35:20] again I you know this uh we've done a
[1:35:22] whole lot of reading tonight we'll get
[1:35:24] on into it maybe even just take a a
[1:35:26] service and just preach on the serpent
[1:35:27] seed sometime but um
[1:35:32] Jesus even even said to the Pharisees he
[1:35:35] says you you generation of snakes you're
[1:35:39] of your father the
[1:35:41] devil uh they said we be not born of
[1:35:45] fornication he said he said they said we
[1:35:47] be not fornication we be of a Abraham's
[1:35:50] seed and he says if you were of
[1:35:51] Abraham's if you were abraam 's children
[1:35:54] you would do the works of Abraham
[1:35:56] Abraham believed
[1:35:59] me and and and they and they went on he
[1:36:02] says but then he but then he brings it
[1:36:03] on down and he says he says you you do
[1:36:07] not hear because you can not hear
[1:36:11] because your father is the devil and so
[1:36:16] uh uh there's there's there's several
[1:36:17] scriptures in there like that and and
[1:36:20] and so it's a it's a very plain deal
[1:36:23] that the beginning was not the eating of
[1:36:26] an apple but it was a sexual adulterous
[1:36:29] relationship between Eve and that
[1:36:33] serpent not a snake not a snake he was a
[1:36:37] beautiful handsome fell that could talk
[1:36:41] reason
[1:36:42] seduce and tricked her she she was
[1:36:45] deceived he tricked her into believing
[1:36:49] that he was right and not
[1:36:52] God oh oh God don't ever let us be
[1:36:55] tricked Amen in into those things amen
[1:36:59] anything else real
[1:37:01] quick praise the
[1:37:03] Lord
[1:37:07] yes yeah I know you've said this before
[1:37:09] but that the closest thing to human DNA
[1:37:13] is snake they found in science year
[1:37:16] years later but that even though you
[1:37:19] know the serpent with a beast was
[1:37:22] changed all the way to snake which is
[1:37:24] like yeah extreme but that that DNA is
[1:37:27] still the closest DNA to a human that is
[1:37:31] crazy that that is good I forgot about
[1:37:34] that they say the snake organs are the
[1:37:37] snake organs are the closest to human
[1:37:39] organs really different orans you know I
[1:37:43] remember Alba coming coming home from
[1:37:45] school one time and uh she was all
[1:37:48] excited you know when she come in she
[1:37:50] said we learned that snakes used to have
[1:37:51] arms and legs
[1:37:54] and that there's there's little there's
[1:37:55] there's little areas there and and U she
[1:37:58] was she was ready you know she was
[1:38:00] telling well of course that's the way it
[1:38:01] was
[1:38:03] [Laughter]
[1:38:08] in yeah yeah that's right it's it's
[1:38:11] incredible if you look if you look
[1:38:14] science has to testify of of God and uh
[1:38:17] uh people can say what they want to say
[1:38:22] but uh
[1:38:24] it's sad it's sad when there are so many
[1:38:26] blinded people that can't see that can't
[1:38:28] see these wonderful Revelations all I
[1:38:31] can say is he has hid it from the wise
[1:38:32] and The Prudent and he revealed them
[1:38:35] unto babes such as would
[1:38:38] learn those that are
[1:38:43] willing Infidel or maybe maybe he was a
[1:38:46] preacher I don't know you'd have to mind
[1:38:49] uh tell me but uh when he was pressed
[1:38:52] about by that man where's where's the
[1:38:56] serpent yeah remember that
[1:39:00] yeah I don't remember I just I just
[1:39:03] vaguely remember that yeah but he he was
[1:39:06] but the Lord showed him you know yeah
[1:39:08] you know yeah I I can't yeah yeah that
[1:39:13] would be something to to look
[1:39:17] up yeah yeah yeah I remember I'm I'm
[1:39:21] trying to piece it I'm trying to
[1:39:36] um we've got we've got an amber alert or
