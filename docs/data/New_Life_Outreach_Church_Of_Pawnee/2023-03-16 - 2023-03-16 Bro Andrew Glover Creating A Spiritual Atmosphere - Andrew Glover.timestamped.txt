[1:09:27] place and suddenly there came a sound
[1:09:30] from Heaven as of a Russian Mighty Wind
[1:09:33] and it filled all the house where they
[1:09:35] were sitting and there appeared in them
[1:09:38] cloven tongues like as a fire
[1:09:40] and it sat upon each of them
[1:09:43] and they were all Fields somebody say
[1:09:45] field

[1:09:48] and began to speak with other tongues as
[1:09:51] the spirit gave them utterance amen we
[1:09:54] asked the Lord this evening that you had
[1:09:56] the blessing to the reading of his word
[1:09:57] as you can be seated here this afternoon

[1:10:12] believe that we have come here this
[1:10:14] weekend to have a spiritual meeting amen
[1:10:17] and I believe if we're going to have a
[1:10:19] spiritual meeting then we've got to have
[1:10:20] a spiritual atmosphere if you're going
[1:10:22] to have a natural meeting then a natural
[1:10:24] atmosphere will be okay if you're going
[1:10:26] to have an intellectual meeting then an
[1:10:28] intellectual atmosphere will be okay but
[1:10:29] we've come here amen for a spiritual
[1:10:32] meeting and we must have a spiritual
[1:10:34] atmosphere now the prophet of God
[1:10:36] actually would say in Tulsa Oklahoma
[1:10:38] 1960 in a prayer he says Wake the people
[1:10:41] up to a spiritual atmosphere he said oh
[1:10:44] it takes that to bring children into the
[1:10:46] kingdom he said it takes the spiritual
[1:10:48] atmosphere again and is there anything
[1:10:50] too hard for the Lord he said that's the
[1:10:52] way the Christian ought to do today is
[1:10:54] keep yourself prayed up under a
[1:10:57] spiritual atmosphere always see never
[1:10:59] seen the bad side but looking to the
[1:11:02] good side amen because you are children
[1:11:04] of God expecting His blessings amen
[1:11:07] never looking to the bad side never
[1:11:09] looking to the negative if never looking
[1:11:10] to what has gone wrong what is going
[1:11:13] wrong or what could go wrong amen but
[1:11:15] always looking at the positive because
[1:11:17] when you see the positive you know the
[1:11:19] one that is a competent the positive is
[1:11:21] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ so
[1:11:23] and then we're not looking to the
[1:11:25] negative we're not looking to doubt
[1:11:26] we're not looking to ideas we're looking
[1:11:28] to the positive and the positive is
[1:11:30] Jesus Christ and because we are looking
[1:11:33] to him there is an expectation that is
[1:11:35] in the heart of every believer remember
[1:11:36] said just as you expect amen that's what
[1:11:39] you're going to get how many agrees with
[1:11:41] me what you expect is exactly what
[1:11:43] you're going to get but if you come to
[1:11:45] the meeting expecting to see the glory
[1:11:47] of God moving the power of God Sinners
[1:11:49] being saved filled with the holy ghost
[1:11:51] sickness being healed amen then watch
[1:11:53] what God shows you if you come here amen
[1:11:56] expecting to see the glory of God he
[1:11:58] will show you his glory if you come here
[1:12:00] expecting to receive a healing in your
[1:12:02] body amen he will give you the healing
[1:12:04] in your body if you come you're
[1:12:05] expecting to receive the Holy Ghost amen
[1:12:08] he still gives the Holy Ghost one ever
[1:12:10] you come here tonight amen expecting God
[1:12:13] to do he is the same yesterday amen
[1:12:15] today and forever well brother Andrew
[1:12:17] I've tried before we'll try again amen I
[1:12:20] I tried one time and I didn't get very
[1:12:22] far we'll try again because we serve a
[1:12:24] God Amen that does not give up he does
[1:12:27] not give in amen he does not come up
[1:12:29] against our position and say well it's
[1:12:31] too hard I don't think we can overcome
[1:12:33] amen but there's a word for every one of
[1:12:35] us here tonight and that is persevere
[1:12:37] amen if you need the Holy Ghost I
[1:12:39] challenge you to persevere this weekend
[1:12:41] if you need Deliverance I challenge you
[1:12:43] to persevere if you need a miracle I
[1:12:46] challenge you to persevere amen if
[1:12:48] there's an old besetting sin and a habit
[1:12:50] amen that has attached itself to your
[1:12:52] life I challenge you by the authority of
[1:12:54] the Holy Ghost persevere amen and God
[1:12:57] will give you Deliverance he will give
[1:12:59] you the miracle he will give you the
[1:13:00] answer he will give you the Breakthrough
[1:13:02] amen because he is God and what his word
[1:13:04] said he would do he is here to do that's
[1:13:07] why we need a spiritual atmosphere I
[1:13:09] believe amen that there's a hunger in
[1:13:11] the heart of every young person sitting
[1:13:13] here tonight and that is a hunger for
[1:13:15] the supernatural how many beliefs in the
[1:13:17] Supernatural you you know what
[1:13:19] Supernatural it's something that
[1:13:20] transcends or transceeds Amen to natural
[1:13:23] and we are hungry for the supernatural
[1:13:25] now it takes a spiritual atmosphere Amen
[1:13:28] to feed the hunger for the supernatural
[1:13:31] let him say without one fear to know
[1:13:33] that I have to answer it that day of
[1:13:34] judgment if I make this statement
[1:13:36] because he's here he said I feel him I
[1:13:39] see the reaction of his word to them
[1:13:41] that's filled with the spirit they're
[1:13:42] children of God he said they eat not the
[1:13:44] bread alone but by the words it proceeds
[1:13:46] out of the mouth of God when the word
[1:13:48] Goes Forth the hungry children say thank
[1:13:51] you Father
[1:13:53] thank you Father oh I love you father he
[1:13:56] said I love you brother I said eating
[1:13:57] not only he meant biscuits and grits and
[1:14:00] brown gravy but they're feeding on the
[1:14:02] Eternal Word of God filling their soul
[1:14:05] with a spiritual atmosphere amen then
[1:14:07] the atmosphere is not just coming in the
[1:14:10] church he meant by the music that's
[1:14:11] being played amen the atmosphere is not
[1:14:14] just coming in the church amen by the
[1:14:16] people that's here amen but the
[1:14:18] atmosphere comes in the church by the
[1:14:19] word amen and as you feed on the word
[1:14:22] you will become the word and as the word
[1:14:24] comes into your heart amen the word will
[1:14:27] satisfy the desire for the supernatural
[1:14:29] let me just go ahead and say this we are
[1:14:31] not following a natural message we are
[1:14:33] not falling a natural idea but we are
[1:14:35] following a supernatural God and he is
[1:14:38] restored and revealed the full word and
[1:14:40] that word is coming to the church amen
[1:14:42] it's not come just to make us feel good
[1:14:44] it's not come just to make us have a
[1:14:46] better approach Amen to a scripture than
[1:14:48] somebody else amen but this message has

[1:14:53] release a supernatural attribute on the
[1:14:55] inside of every believer listen I'm

[1:15:21] that he would do you didn't come up

[1:15:28] just looking for somebody who will let
[1:15:30] him come into their heart by the
[1:15:32] revelation of the word that they're

[1:16:18] been LED here by Jesus Christ who is the
[1:16:20] same yesterday today and forever and God
[1:16:23] does not lead you somewhere without
[1:16:25] there being something to satisfy amen
[1:16:27] the desire he's leading you by I say oh

[1:16:40] not revive us again amen that thou
[1:16:42] people may rejoice in thee amen we're
[1:16:45] not rejoicing in just the ideas of a man
[1:16:47] we are rejoicing in the revelation of
[1:16:49] the word that's been revealed in the age
[1:16:51] we're living remember said if you
[1:16:52] neglect to satisfy thirst for water or
[1:16:55] food you will die and if you neglect
[1:16:57] that first and you for God you will
[1:16:59] spiritually die he said you call for
[1:17:01] revivals amen you wait for your church
[1:17:03] to have a Revival well that ain't the
[1:17:06] Revival for you oh no the Revival ought
[1:17:09] to begin right in you when you begin to
[1:17:11] thirst for god listen friends you think
[1:17:13] the Revival started when you put on the
[1:17:15] parking lot and you got in the building
[1:17:17] and you sit down amen but in reality the
[1:17:20] Revival started amen when something in
[1:17:22] your heart said I gotta get to Oklahoma
[1:17:24] I gotta get in those meetings I gotta
[1:17:27] get into the spouts where the Shekinah
[1:17:29] glorious Point amen something began to
[1:17:31] pulsate in your heart come on church
[1:17:33] amen that was not a campfire drawing you
[1:17:36] and then that was not a preacher amen
[1:17:38] probing at you to get down here but it
[1:17:40] was a Revival amen that is here for you
[1:17:43] to receive I know some of y'all need a
[1:17:45] Revival amen some of us need a
[1:17:47] refreshing some of us need to renew it
[1:17:49] and I'll tell you the only way it's
[1:17:50] going to come it'll come by the
[1:17:52] supernatural World they've been coming
[1:17:54] into our souls and feeding our souls the
[1:17:57] word
[1:17:58] the Revival ought to begin right in you
[1:18:00] when you begin to thirst for God there
[1:18:02] might not be another member of the
[1:18:04] church amen wanting that Revival but if
[1:18:06] it breaks out in you oh come on if it
[1:18:09] breaks out in you he said it'll break
[1:18:11] out in other places I say oh God let a
[1:18:13] Revival break out here this weekend
[1:18:15] that'll burn in every Church it'll burn
[1:18:17] in every home it'll burn in every school
[1:18:19] I'ma we're not just coming down here
[1:18:21] once a year amen to get a little bit of
[1:18:23] excitement and a little bit of emotion
[1:18:25] amen but I believe we can receive
[1:18:27] something here this weekend that'll
[1:18:29] carry us from time back into eternity I
[1:18:32] believe we can gather here this weekend
[1:18:33] and receive a visitation from the
[1:18:36] almighty God and it'll take us through
[1:18:38] every trial it'll take us to every
[1:18:40] disappointment it'll take us through
[1:18:42] every hard time because there's a word
[1:18:44] and it's an anchoring word it's a word
[1:18:46] of Revival listen if we're going to have
[1:18:48] that Revival then we got to get in the
[1:18:50] spirit of Revival
[1:18:52] if we're going to have Revival we got to
[1:18:54] get in the spirit of Revival you know
[1:18:55] brother I'm saying if you're going to
[1:18:56] have a dance you got to get in the
[1:18:58] spirit of dancing if you're going to
[1:19:00] have a ball game you got to get in the
[1:19:02] spirit of the ball game he said then we
[1:19:04] can never have a Revival Amen in
[1:19:06] Shreveport or anywhere else until the
[1:19:09] church gets in the spirit of the Revival
[1:19:11] until the church gets in the spirit of
[1:19:14] Revival God can come and perform
[1:19:16] Miracles he can sow under stretch forth
[1:19:18] his hand he can heal the sick and The
[1:19:20] Afflicted and the preacher can preach
[1:19:22] the gospel as hard as he can but they'll
[1:19:25] never be a Revival until the church gets
[1:19:28] in the spirit of Revival then what is
[1:19:30] Revival a Revival is an improvement in
[1:19:33] the condition or strength of something
[1:19:35] in the religious sense it is The
[1:19:38] Reawakening of a religious fervor now
[1:19:40] look how the world defines Revival
[1:19:42] especially by a series of Evangelistic
[1:19:45] meetings amen so the world's idea of a
[1:19:48] Revival amen is get a bunch of people
[1:19:50] together amen have a special preacher
[1:19:52] sing a few songs and that's a Revival
[1:19:55] but the Prophet come in this age and
[1:19:57] said that's not a Revival that's a
[1:19:59] protractive meeting he said that's just
[1:20:01] the ability he meant to get a crowd of
[1:20:03] people together he said see but a true
[1:20:05] Revival is not a false Revival it's a
[1:20:08] true Revival now you know what you know
[1:20:10] there's true and false revivals right
[1:20:12] amen there's a false Revival and a false
[1:20:15] Revival comes amen when you try to move
[1:20:17] the people apart from the word you get a
[1:20:20] false Revival when you try to move the
[1:20:23] church apart from the lord well I'm here
[1:20:24] some might as well preach amen you get a
[1:20:27] false Revival when you try to move the
[1:20:29] people into a higher Dimension with God
[1:20:31] apart from this message amen you can
[1:20:34] only go as high as the message and the
[1:20:36] age you're living in and this message
[1:20:38] well I'm going to preach amen this
[1:20:40] message is not a better idea this
[1:20:42] message is not a book on the Shelf it's
[1:20:44] not something you should just play at
[1:20:46] night when you can't go to sleep and you
[1:20:47] need to hear amen and saw a holy voice
[1:20:50] amen this message is your guy this
[1:20:52] message is your compass if you want to
[1:20:54] get out of layout to see you you better
[1:20:56] get under this message if you want to
[1:20:58] see the future home you better get out
[1:21:00] of this message this message is Jesus
[1:21:03] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:21:05] forever and I refuse Amen to let some
[1:21:08] devil reduce this message amen down to
[1:21:10] just a bunch of people sitting around
[1:21:12] amen arguing about how God used to move
[1:21:14] I propose to you that what God used to
[1:21:17] do he's right here this weekend to do he
[1:21:20] was God in Jeffersonville he was God in
[1:21:22] Arizona he was caught in Canada but he's
[1:21:25] God right here in Oklahoma this weekend
[1:21:27] and he's here to confirm his word by the
[1:21:30] power of this word by the reality of
[1:21:33] Jesus Christ coming in this room will
[1:21:35] confirm this message is more than a man
[1:21:37] it's more than an idea it's the voice of
[1:21:40] God
[1:21:42] this message is the saith the Lord now
[1:21:47] you say brother Andrew we got to move
[1:21:48] the people well we can't do it with the
[1:21:50] message well maybe the message you're
[1:21:52] preaching he can't
[1:21:54] but the message I'm preaching emptied
[1:21:56] seven truckloads full of wheelchairs
[1:22:00] well brother Andrew we can't move the
[1:22:02] people with a message well the message
[1:22:03] I'm preaching went around the world
[1:22:05] seven times
[1:22:08] and was never defeated once see a false
[1:22:12] Revival comes by trying to move the
[1:22:14] people apart from the word amen but now
[1:22:17] watch a true Revival comes by people
[1:22:20] coming back to the word the prophets
[1:22:22] should every fresh and true Revival will
[1:22:25] be because men have gotten back to the
[1:22:27] word for their age from the very first
[1:22:29] book in the Bible Genesis to the last
[1:22:32] book of Revelation there is only one
[1:22:34] reason for God's displeasure and that is
[1:22:36] leaving the word and there's only one
[1:22:39] remedy to regain his favor is to come
[1:22:42] back to the word then the word is the
[1:22:44] anchor or the absolute or the typos to
[1:22:47] this generation without this word we
[1:22:49] don't have a Revival without this
[1:22:51] message you're wasting your time here
[1:22:53] this weekend amen listen if we lay this
[1:22:56] message aside we should have spent our
[1:22:58] money to go to Dollywood we should have
[1:23:00] spent our money to go to California or
[1:23:02] go to Disney World Without this message
[1:23:04] this is another building you're another
[1:23:06] young person I'm another person picture
[1:23:08] but if this message is a truth and it
[1:23:11] comes into this Dimension it's just not
[1:23:13] just a youth camp this is not just
[1:23:15] another bunch of preachers it's just not
[1:23:16] just a bunch of young people this is
[1:23:18] Rapture and Faith it's Rapture and Grace
[1:23:20] it's Rapture anointing it's the
[1:23:23] releasing of the prisoners from the
[1:23:25] bondage of the slave owner it's the
[1:23:27] releasing of Liberty and healing it
[1:23:29] listen I want to say it as plain as I
[1:23:31] can this message is nothing but the
[1:23:33] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:36] confirming his presence confirming his
[1:23:38] actions listen he's still moving he's
[1:23:41] still healing he's still saving he's
[1:23:43] still delivered
[1:23:46] we are not looking for a Revival we are
[1:23:49] the Revival we're not looking for the
[1:23:51] word we have become the word
[1:23:55] a true Revival comes when men will get
[1:23:58] back to the word for their age come on
[1:24:00] church we got to get back to what a
[1:24:02] prophet tone I don't care what you I
[1:24:04] don't care what your favorite grandma
[1:24:06] said favorite preacher favorite Almanac
[1:24:08] favorite and then you got to get back to
[1:24:10] what a prophet said
[1:24:12] it's the only thing that'll stand when
[1:24:14] two hundred thousand thousand demons are
[1:24:16] surrounding your life is what a prophet
[1:24:18] is taught it's the only thing that will
[1:24:20] break through in the night seasons and
[1:24:22] give you a Revival is what a prophet is
[1:24:23] saying listen we've had all kinds of
[1:24:25] revivals I I pray this is okay we've had
[1:24:28] all kinds of revivals remember to say

[1:24:33] revivals intellectual revivals yet in
[1:24:36] all those revivals he says we haven't
[1:24:38] had a Revival yet in all the revivals we
[1:24:42] haven't had a Revival yet he said we
[1:24:45] talk about Revival but we ain't had no
[1:24:47] Revival yet he said we've had a lot of
[1:24:49] protracted meetings then you come over
[1:24:51] to 1963 in the third seal he said that's
[1:24:54] the reason today that the revivals were
[1:24:56] supposed to have we haven't had a real
[1:24:58] stirring he said we have denominational
[1:25:00] revivals but we haven't had a real
[1:25:03] stirring no no don't think we got
[1:25:05] revivals we haven't oh they got millions
[1:25:07] and millions and millions of church

[1:25:11] nowhere see the bride hasn't had a
[1:25:15] Revival yet amen see there's been no
[1:25:17] Revival there now watch what he says no
[1:25:20] manifestation of God Amen to stir the
[1:25:22] bride see we're looking for it it'll
[1:25:25] take those seven unknown Thunders back
[1:25:27] there Amen to wake her up amen he will
[1:25:30] send it he promised it he said now she
[1:25:32] was dead I know sometimes people say
[1:25:34] well brother Andrew you got to be
[1:25:36] careful about preaching to young people
[1:25:37] but you see you got the wrong guy up
[1:25:39] here amen because I know that we got

[1:31:39] go ahead and say this this bride is not
[1:31:41] asleep
[1:31:43] this ride is not still waiting to be
[1:31:45] awakened but the prophet of God set the
[1:31:47] wake of the Bride will be those Thunder
[1:31:49] those seven Thunders now Revelation 10 3
[1:31:51] cry with a loud voice that's when a lion
[1:31:53] roars and when he had cried seven
[1:31:55] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[1:31:57] the seven Thunders had other voices I
[1:31:59] was about to write amen and I Heard a
[1:32:02] Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up
[1:32:04] those things which the seventh unders
[1:32:06] uttered and wrath him not now if you
[1:32:09] really wonder I'm gonna make it real
[1:32:10] quick here if you really want to break
[1:32:11] into this amen the Thunder is the voice
[1:32:14] of God contrary to what anybody else
[1:32:16] says amen the prophet of God you got the
[1:32:18] table on your phone you can go read it
[1:32:20] the voice of God is the thunder John 12
[1:32:23] first seal glorify thy name the voice of
[1:32:26] God is the thunder he said then it was
[1:32:28] in the untimed period of Jesus that
[1:32:30] those seven Thunders come forth what was
[1:32:32] in those Thunders no one knows but we
[1:32:34] need to know come on young people we
[1:32:36] didn't know it back then but we need to
[1:32:38] know it well but then there were young
[1:32:39] people we don't need them but a prophet
[1:32:41] didn't say the old people need to know
[1:32:43] and the young people need to catch up he
[1:32:45] said we need an orange so there's no age
[1:32:47] limit on the revelation of this word
[1:32:49] that is coming in the age we're living
[1:32:51] in amen old people can know it but 12
[1:32:54] year old boys can know it older sisters
[1:32:56] can know it but 10 year old girls cannot
[1:32:58] it's the prevailing power to overcome
[1:33:01] laodicea it's the prevailing power come
[1:33:04] on you want to overcome the devil get
[1:33:06] under the revelation of the word of God
[1:33:08] and the age of living and that devil
[1:33:10] will have to chase you down
[1:33:12] that devil chases you around and chases
[1:33:15] you around amen won't you chase him down
[1:33:17] sometime once you get under the message
[1:33:19] and Chase that devil down that devil
[1:33:21] chases you a depression chases you a
[1:33:23] fish chase you that amen I tell you
[1:33:25] what's not going to deliver you it's a
[1:33:26] feeling I tell you what's not going to
[1:33:27] leave you as a sensation but I will tell
[1:33:29] you what deliver you is a quickening
[1:33:31] power coming up on the word of God and
[1:33:34] the age you're living in and you'll let
[1:33:36] that devil sparing the face and say the
[1:33:38] God in Me is no match for you big boy
[1:33:43] come on these aren't just clothes these
[1:33:46] are living realities I heard a prophet
[1:33:48] say Aaliyah I heard a prophet say that
[1:33:50] you can live so close to God that the
[1:33:52] devil don't know what to do with you I
[1:33:54] heard a prophets hey you can live in the
[1:33:56] presence of God 24 7
[1:33:59] 365. it does not come on you can put us
[1:34:02] in the water put us in the whales barely
[1:34:04] we'll still be the Revival put us on the
[1:34:06] mountain put us in the valley but it's
[1:34:08] in school put us in work put us in
[1:34:10] college wherever you put this bride
[1:34:12] she's on fire because the word
[1:34:17] the word the unchanging God with
[1:34:20] unchanging ways
[1:34:22] hell God young people you want something
[1:34:25] to shout about shout about this message
[1:34:27] you want something to dance about dance
[1:34:29] about the seventh angel you want
[1:34:31] something to scream your lungs out
[1:34:32] scream that God has fulfilled his word
[1:34:35] and has restored us to the divine order
[1:34:41] we're not looking for the message we are
[1:34:44] the message we're not looking for the
[1:34:46] revelation we are the revelation
[1:34:49] and there's no such prevailing Force as
[1:34:53] the force of Revelation now the part of
[1:34:55] God said like this he said when
[1:34:56] theologians and people have departed
[1:34:58] from the word God always somebody say
[1:35:01] always God always sent his word back to
[1:35:03] the people but by a prophet
[1:35:07] all right
[1:35:08] then the messenger Malachi for you all
[1:35:10] know that right Malachi 4 behold I sin
[1:35:13] unto you
[1:35:15] a lie to the prophet Revelation 10 7 in
[1:35:18] the days of the voice of the seven
[1:35:19] things when he shall begin to sound see
[1:35:21] he's going to do two things one
[1:35:23] according to Malachi 4 he's going to
[1:35:25] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:35:27] fathers the second thing he's going to
[1:35:29] do is going to reveal the mysteries of
[1:35:31] the seven thunders in Revelation 10
[1:35:33] which are the revelations contained in
[1:35:36] the Seven Seals now it will be these
[1:35:38] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:35:41] will literally turn the hearts of the
[1:35:43] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:35:45] there is no age limit on the revelation
[1:35:47] of this message there is no age limit on
[1:35:50] the revelation of the atmosphere of the
[1:35:53] supernatural Gods you can dwell in
[1:35:54] because it's not a emotional Revival
[1:35:57] it's not a musical Revival it is a word
[1:36:00] revival can we agree that bride's
[1:36:02] Revival is a word's Revival listen if
[1:36:05] you showed up here tonight and your
[1:36:07] Revival is music what are you going to
[1:36:08] do if the power goes out and they can't
[1:36:10] play the music if you showed up in your
[1:36:13] Revival was in your favorite preacher
[1:36:14] and you got here and he wasn't here what
[1:36:17] are you going to do go sit in your dorm
[1:36:18] and eat Doritos for the rest of the
[1:36:19] weekend amen you're Revival is not in
[1:36:21] the music your Revival is not in just a
[1:36:24] preacher your Revival is in the word
[1:36:26] then wherever the word is we can have a
[1:36:28] Revival if there's one there or 200
[1:36:31] there we can have a Revival among our
[1:36:33] revivalists not coming from the music
[1:36:35] our Revival is not coming from Sensation
[1:36:38] our Revival is coming from the word that
[1:36:40] has been restored through the voice of
[1:36:43] the seventh angel It's Shouting Time
[1:36:45] It's Hallelujah time the word is back in
[1:36:48] the church the Invincible Army is not
[1:36:50] coming she is here
[1:36:54] the bride's Revival is a word Revival
[1:36:57] education can never bring life it takes
[1:37:00] the spirit of God to bring life and that
[1:37:02] life must not come just out of the
[1:37:04] intellect's Revival it's got to come out
[1:37:07] of the Bible the word Revival and that
[1:37:10] word is the same
[1:37:12] brother that word is the same yesterday
[1:37:15] today and forever and when it falls
[1:37:18] today and it quickens you get the same
[1:37:21] results that you did in Acts the second
[1:37:24] chapter it always has always will be
[1:37:26] because it's the spirit of God that
[1:37:29] conditions the atmosphere
[1:37:32] the spirit of God conditions the
[1:37:34] atmosphere and then he says see it takes
[1:37:37] atmosphere to do things the spirit of
[1:37:40] God conditions the atmosphere because it
[1:37:44] takes an atmosphere to do things now
[1:37:46] when you look at this word condition
[1:37:47] Webster says it means to bring something
[1:37:50] into the desired state for use now you
[1:37:53] all know amen the product of God said
[1:37:55] that Samson knew in his present
[1:37:56] masculine condition he could not produce
[1:37:58] the strength of the challenge of the
[1:38:00] hour he said men and women brothers and
[1:38:01] sisters let me say this the church in
[1:38:04] its present denominational condition
[1:38:06] cannot produce the strength Amen to
[1:38:09] challenge the time he said to call at a
[1:38:11] time but thank God he would send the
[1:38:13] seventh angel who would have the voice
[1:38:15] of Revelation and he would call the
[1:38:18] bride out of the church he never said
[1:38:20] the bride was not in condition he said
[1:38:22] the church was not in condition and the
[1:38:25] seventh angel called The Bride out of
[1:38:27] the church amen to put her into
[1:38:28] condition by the restoration of the word
[1:38:31] to meet the child challenge every hour
[1:38:32] listen I said like this there's a reason
[1:38:35] why the Prophet come in this age and
[1:38:37] preached a sermon called Church order he
[1:38:39] said because the atmosphere must be in a
[1:38:42] condition Amen to be to receive and to
[1:38:44] produce what God is sending now the
[1:38:46] promise said is this okay he said now I
[1:38:49] said like this he said I believe that
[1:38:50] worshipers coming in they should be met
[1:38:52] he said see with hospitality notice this
[1:38:55] he said oh my in the love to see the
[1:38:57] church Living God go on he said now
[1:38:59] these worshipers should not talk one
[1:39:00] with another and be talking across
[1:39:02] making noise in the church brother
[1:39:04] Andrew why are you preaching this
[1:39:05] because we need an atmosphere amen I say
[1:39:07] thank God for a prophet who could even
[1:39:09] put the atmosphere in order that God
[1:39:11] could come down and feel welcome in
[1:39:14] now y'all know I'm preaching to you
[1:39:16] tonight amen thank God for a prophet
[1:39:18] that even got the atmosphere back y'all
[1:39:20] imagine coming in here tonight amen and
[1:39:22] they start the service and bends back
[1:39:24] her heart brother Jason and Colby's
[1:39:26] heart up here amenities house amen and
[1:39:29] Josh is hard over here well how did your
[1:39:30] trip go how oh where'd y'all stop and
[1:39:33] eat amen what kind of atmosphere would
[1:39:34] that be in amen but you come in here and
[1:39:37] there's music playing amen then there's
[1:39:39] a song leader who begins to sing what
[1:39:41] are they doing they are conditioning the
[1:39:42] atmosphere amen they're preparing an
[1:39:45] atmosphere to welcome the word into
[1:39:47] because the prophet said the most
[1:39:49] important part of the service is the
[1:39:51] word amen then when you receive a word
[1:39:53] if it's going to be a manifested word
[1:39:55] it's going to be received in an
[1:39:57] atmosphere that it can manifest itself
[1:39:59] in now when you want to see this amen
[1:40:01] the proud of God said when the word
[1:40:03] falls into the ground and it's quickened
[1:40:06] he said it will produce the same results
[1:40:08] in the church today that it did in Acts
[1:40:10] the second chapter
[1:40:12] now come on Amen all the way back
[1:40:14] thousands of years ago
[1:40:17] the word fell into the upper room and It
[1:40:20] produced in the atmosphere because it
[1:40:22] was an atmosphere that was prepared to
[1:40:25] produce the word him said like this he
[1:40:27] said you'll get the same results amen
[1:40:30] that they got an acts of the second
[1:40:31] chapter and I find it very amazing that
[1:40:34] when you start studying these things you
[1:40:35] will find that there's actually three
[1:40:37] ingredients if I could say it that way
[1:40:39] I'm not a cook but there's three
[1:40:40] ingredients they meant to see results
[1:40:42] amen the first one is our approach the
[1:40:46] second one is our attitude and the third
[1:40:48] is our atmosphere somebody say with me
[1:40:50] our approach our attitude and the
[1:40:53] atmosphere now the problem God said you
[1:40:56] must come by the right approach Psalm 65
[1:40:58] verse 4 David said blessed is the man
[1:41:00] whom thou chooses and calls us to
[1:41:02] approach to thee that he may dwell in
[1:41:04] the courts that we shall be satisfied
[1:41:05] with the goodness of the house even of
[1:41:07] the Holy Temple remember says it like
[1:41:09] this he said God has a way of Repro of
[1:41:12] approach he said now if you're going to
[1:41:14] visit a king there's a way to approach a
[1:41:16] king the boy who wants to approach a
[1:41:18] young lady Amen to get acquainted with
[1:41:19] her there's a certain approach you can't
[1:41:21] just come up there and say hey there I'd
[1:41:22] like to meet with you and shake your
[1:41:24] hand he said she she isn't very much of
[1:41:26] a lady amen she'll let you know where to
[1:41:28] get on and off at that's right there's a
[1:41:30] certain way you want to approach it you
[1:41:31] want to come with respects to that lady
[1:41:34] and so forth so right there the prophet
[1:41:36] connects respects with your approach it
[1:41:38] was not a coincidence he preaches an
[1:41:40] entire tape called respects and says if
[1:41:43] you're going to approach God you've got
[1:41:44] to come through the channel of respects
[1:41:46] listen if you want to receive something
[1:41:48] from the spirit of God you've got to
[1:41:50] respect the spirit of God if you want to
[1:41:52] receive something from these meetings
[1:41:53] you've got to respect these meetings I'm
[1:41:55] not talking about the walls I'm not
[1:41:57] talking about the concrete I'm talking
[1:41:59] about the person who is coming to visit
[1:42:01] you in these meetings his name is the
[1:42:04] Lord Jesus Christ and if you want an
[1:42:05] audience with him you've got to respect
[1:42:07] him you got to worship him you got to
[1:42:10] adore him come on well brother Andrew I
[1:42:12] don't feel like worshiping it ain't
[1:42:13] based on how you feel rather than I
[1:42:15] don't feel like getting in it ain't
[1:42:16] based the way you feel amen there's a
[1:42:18] word here and it's an anointed word and
[1:42:21] if you will surrender yourself to the
[1:42:23] anointed word that word will come in a
[1:42:25] cold atmosphere it'll come in a it'll
[1:42:27] come in a divisive atmosphere
[1:42:30] wherever you welcome the word the word
[1:42:33] will work
[1:42:34] wherever you welcome the word the word
[1:42:37] will work if you put in the fiery
[1:42:39] furnace it'll work there if you put it
[1:42:41] in the Lion's Den it'll work Fair
[1:42:42] wherever you respect the word and
[1:42:45] receive the word you'll see a
[1:42:47] manifestation of that word there's
[1:42:49] always approach to all things he said
[1:42:51] then there's a way to approach God and
[1:42:53] if we don't know the approach to God
[1:42:55] we'll never be able to get an audience
[1:42:58] with God
[1:42:59] that's who we're here to see is God
[1:43:01] that's who we're here to have a com have
[1:43:03] a conference with is God and if we don't
[1:43:06] find the approach we'll never be able to
[1:43:08] talk to him if we don't find the
[1:43:10] approach or the same will never get an
[1:43:12] audience with him amen but if there's an
[1:43:13] approach then there's a people to find
[1:43:15] that approach and there's a God to talk
[1:43:17] to he said you come God provided
[1:43:19] approach one time and see what happens
[1:43:22] now this word approaches a very powerful
[1:43:24] definition to me because it means to
[1:43:26] draw closer to it makes it means to make
[1:43:29] advances to especially in order create a
[1:43:32] desired result
[1:43:34] if you're approaching something you've
[1:43:36] got a desired result already in mind
[1:43:39] you're expecting to get out of what
[1:43:40] you're approaching come on if you if
[1:43:43] you're approaching a judge and then
[1:43:44] you're expecting to get a you're
[1:43:46] expecting to get a good verdict you're
[1:43:47] expecting to get a good word so you've
[1:43:49] already got a desire amen so you're
[1:43:52] approaching him in a way that is
[1:43:54] conducive to get the desire and the
[1:43:56] results you're desire I'm on church I'm
[1:43:58] gonna come on young boys go talk to that
[1:44:00] young lady amen you go talk to her
[1:44:02] you've got one thing in mind you want to
[1:44:03] get to know her you want to shake her
[1:44:05] hand you want to meet her you want to
[1:44:06] what church do you go to you don't just
[1:44:08] walk up and say well like the prophet
[1:44:10] said amen how you do like to talk to you
[1:44:12] he said see that's not an approach now
[1:44:15] come on friends how are we approaching
[1:44:17] these meetings are we just approaching
[1:44:18] as another Youth Camp are we just
[1:44:20] approaching as well as 2023 it's Mars
[1:44:23] it's time we all go down to Oklahoma I
[1:44:26] say if that's the way you've come you'll
[1:44:28] leave that way but if you come here with
[1:44:30] Your Mind Set On Jesus with your heart
[1:44:32] focused with a spirit of person
[1:44:34] appearance upon your heart amen you will
[1:44:36] pressure come on I'll tell you this if
[1:44:38] you're going to get an audience with God
[1:44:39] it's not going to be easy
[1:44:42] if you're going to get an audience with
[1:44:44] God you're gonna have to fight two
[1:44:45] Devils you're gonna have to fight
[1:44:47] through Spirits you're gonna have to
[1:44:48] fight through unbelief amen but if you
[1:44:50] can fight for it come on church right
[1:44:53] now the devil does not want this meeting
[1:44:54] Amen to go to the next level this devil
[1:44:57] does not want you to receive your
[1:44:59] Miracle he wants us to be just another
[1:45:00] Youth Camp and just another song and
[1:45:03] another sermon and another get together
[1:45:04] but I propose to you that this is a
[1:45:07] life-changing weekend I propose to you
[1:45:09] that this is a weekend with a god of
[1:45:11] gods we're the King of Kings where the
[1:45:13] Lord of lords can come into a building
[1:45:15] he can change Hearts he can change lives
[1:45:18] come on bet you got to know how to
[1:45:19] approach it anybody want to leave here
[1:45:21] with a miracle you gotta know how to
[1:45:22] approach the god that gives Miracles
[1:45:24] anybody want to leave here with an
[1:45:26] answer you got to know how to approach
[1:45:27] The God Who can give you the answer if
[1:45:30] you find the right approach
[1:45:32] if you can find the right approach you
[1:45:35] will find amen the desire and the result
[1:45:38] you say brother I'm a sinner I'm not
[1:45:40] worthy to talk to God well that devil
[1:45:42] that told you that is a liar because a
[1:45:45] prophet said that God has provided an
[1:45:48] approach through the shed blood of the
[1:45:50] Lamb
[1:45:54] been with fat blood amen there's some
[1:45:57] cold air coming up here if you can turn
[1:45:58] it off would be great with fat blood you
[1:46:01] can approach god with that blood you can
[1:46:04] actually come to him and he will not be
[1:46:06] seeing you he will be seeing the blood
[1:46:08] in other words the prophet said the way
[1:46:10] to approach God to his people is through
[1:46:13] the shed blood it has been from that day
[1:46:15] till this day the same thing the
[1:46:18] shedding of blood brings the approach to
[1:46:20] God Hebrews 9 22 says almost all things
[1:46:23] are purged by the law with purged with
[1:46:25] blood and without the shedding of blood
[1:46:28] is no remission then without the blood
[1:46:30] we can't have a youth camp come on
[1:46:32] Church without the blood I cannot tell
[1:46:35] you that you can leave here change
[1:46:36] without the blood I cannot tell you amen
[1:46:39] that a miracle can take place but
[1:46:41] because there is a blood there is a
[1:46:44] position there is a proper possibility
[1:46:46] oh God there is an approach see River
[1:46:49] said see he's behind the blood now
[1:46:51] speaking of God he said I'm behind the
[1:46:53] blood now I'm the strength Giver I'm the
[1:46:55] satisfier I'm the all-sufficient one I
[1:46:58] am your approach who is our approach he
[1:47:00] says the Lord Jesus see then God provide
[1:47:03] an approach and through that approach
[1:47:04] the blood we can come to a new birth
[1:47:09] what if Christ had found so much fault
[1:47:11] in you that he wouldn't have died for
[1:47:12] you but see he was God's approach see
[1:47:16] our approach to God is through him see
[1:47:18] if you approach something finding fault
[1:47:21] with it how do you expect to get a good
[1:47:22] result from it
[1:47:24] come on church if you approach something
[1:47:27] find and fault in it how you go well
[1:47:30] well well well we might as well pretend
[1:47:32] we were here amen if you come in here
[1:47:34] already critical how do you expect to
[1:47:35] get a blessing
[1:47:37] well it's just going to be the same old
[1:47:39] way and they're going to sing the same
[1:47:40] old song and they're going to do this
[1:47:41] amen that's not the approach that's a
[1:47:43] critical approach and if you come a
[1:47:45] critical approach relief with a critical
[1:47:46] result amen but if you come God's
[1:47:48] provided approach if you come to the
[1:47:50] approach if there's no one good except
[1:47:53] Jesus Christ there's no one deserving
[1:47:55] but him there's no one that is entitled
[1:47:57] but him then you leave a different way
[1:48:00] because you come the right approach
[1:48:02] there is an approach to all things I
[1:48:04] love this and I found this today brother
[1:48:05] Colby I thought it's powerful there is
[1:48:07] an approach to war and I believe that
[1:48:10] this is I think it's what hand-to-hand
[1:48:11] combat amen it's wartime amen it's time
[1:48:14] to fight back against the devil it's
[1:48:17] time to drive back against that evil one
[1:48:18] and the father of God said do you know
[1:48:20] there's an approach to war in the army
[1:48:23] of God it is first by music
[1:48:27] well there goes every critical devil
[1:48:29] about music just got all watered up
[1:48:30] right there amen the approach to war is
[1:48:33] first by God through music he said the
[1:48:36] singers went before the ark and they're
[1:48:38] rejoicing in the singing then come the
[1:48:40] ark which was the word and then the
[1:48:42] battle see that's the reason we come in
[1:48:44] service at night what do we do we sing
[1:48:46] the hymns of the Lord he said and then
[1:48:48] the ark the word read the word and then
[1:48:51] the battle that we're in but the great
[1:48:52] Banners are flying tonight the name of
[1:48:55] Jesus Christ the Lord God is exalted and
[1:48:58] may the enemy be put to fight and God
[1:49:00] win the victory tonight and save souls
[1:49:03] and heal the sick and Afflicted calls
[1:49:05] those who are weary and stoop low to
[1:49:07] raise up their hands and rejoice and get
[1:49:09] great Glory unto himself the prophet of
[1:49:12] God is showing you the approach to God
[1:49:13] is to the blood the approach to it
[1:49:16] changes through the New Birth the
[1:49:17] approach to war is through worship and
[1:49:20] the word
[1:49:21] you say well I don't think so I don't
[1:49:23] think the approach is very important all
[1:49:25] right we'll go talk to a judge and walk

[1:49:30] your hoodie on come on walk in there

[1:49:37] that judge ain't gonna see you he's
[1:49:39] going to tell you to get out of there
[1:49:40] because there's a way to approach now if
[1:49:43] we get the right approach then the next
[1:49:45] thing is we got to come with the right
[1:49:46] attitude amen come in the right approach
[1:49:49] amen and come with the right attitude
[1:49:51] come by the right approach with the
[1:49:53] right attitude you say but then I don't

[1:51:49] based off of the word that is a positive
[1:51:52] attitude
[1:51:53] come on church if you come the right
[1:51:55] approach amen the blood will change your
[1:51:57] attitude if you come the right approach
[1:51:59] amen the new birth will change your
[1:52:01] attitude if you come the right approach
[1:52:03] it won't be a church attitude it won't
[1:52:06] be a church atmosphere it'll be a word
[1:52:08] attitude it'll be a word approach
[1:52:14] you gotta come with a right you got to
[1:52:15] come by the right approach you got to
[1:52:17] come with the right attitude listen this
[1:52:19] the Bible says in Matthew 25 15 25 then
[1:52:22] came she speaking of the seraphenician
[1:52:24] woman and she worshiped him saying Lord
[1:52:27] help me but he answered and said it is
[1:52:29] not meat to take the children's bread
[1:52:33] and they cast it to dogs
[1:52:35] and she said well ain't nobody going to
[1:52:37] talk to me like that
[1:52:39] because I'll have you know whose church
[1:52:41] I go to and I'll have you know what
[1:52:43] family I come out of and I'll have you
[1:52:45] know who I am no she had the right
[1:52:48] attitude you know why because she come
[1:52:50] the right approach she said Lord that's
[1:52:53] the truth but even the dogs leap the
[1:52:56] crumbs which fall from their master's
[1:52:58] table she knew if she was going to get
[1:53:01] an audience with God she had to have an
[1:53:03] attitude change she had to have an
[1:53:05] approach she had to have a change and
[1:53:08] the prophet God said see you put me on
[1:53:10] record tonight in these recorders I have
[1:53:12] no apology for this remark I'm fixing to
[1:53:14] make I believe and can prove that right
[1:53:17] mental attitude towards any Divine
[1:53:20] promise of God will bring it to pass see
[1:53:23] the right mental attitude he said but
[1:53:25] you got to have the right attitude the
[1:53:28] attitude is what brings the results well
[1:53:30] I thought it was the approach amen the
[1:53:32] approach is an advance Amen to create
[1:53:35] the result that you're Desiring amen but
[1:53:37] the next thing is the right attitude
[1:53:39] dude amen save the right attitude if you
[1:53:42] say yes yes I believe it but I don't
[1:53:43] know now that's not the right attitude
[1:53:46] the right attitude you want to put this
[1:53:48] down y'all too the right attitude is to
[1:53:50] receive it and say it's thus saith the
[1:53:53] Lord and then it's right
[1:53:55] then what is an attitude an attitude is
[1:53:58] a settled way of thinking or feeling
[1:54:00] about someone or something it is
[1:54:03] typically it is typically one that is
[1:54:06] reflected in a person's Behavior so an
[1:54:09] attitude does not change amen but it's
[1:54:11] settled
[1:54:13] come on now an attitude does not change
[1:54:16] with the conditions of things but an
[1:54:18] attitude finds a finds a stability and
[1:54:21] anchors itself there listen the part of
[1:54:22] God goes on to say before you come in
[1:54:24] this prayer line he said all right
[1:54:26] you're the patient aren't you yes sister
[1:54:28] before I take a hold of your hand I want
[1:54:30] to talk to you just a little bit of
[1:54:31] course you're just a little nervous kind
[1:54:32] of saying now here here's where the
[1:54:34] operating in the first pool which was
[1:54:36] what the sign in the hand which was
[1:54:37] contacting the disease and before he can
[1:54:40] operate in the first pool he said I want
[1:54:42] to get you in the right attitude of God
[1:54:44] mentally speaking amen towards God's
[1:54:47] promise before I pray for you Abraham
[1:54:49] said like this watch them on a platform
[1:54:51] sometime in a healing service and watch
[1:54:53] the attitude they come in here the other
[1:54:55] night I remember the lady come up here
[1:54:56] with just about well I didn't have
[1:54:58] enough Faith hardly get to the platform
[1:54:59] she had been in the prayer line after
[1:55:01] prayer line and I know the woman wasn't
[1:55:03] going to get well I seen her coming up
[1:55:05] there I knew it wasn't she didn't have
[1:55:08] the right attitude when she come up to
[1:55:10] get well
[1:55:12] oh come on church she was in the
[1:55:14] presence of a prophet of God she was
[1:55:16] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:55:18] but her attitude was wrong and he said
[1:55:20] she couldn't get healed because she had
[1:55:22] the wrong attitude she can't do it I
[1:55:25] said the Lord bless you Sister may go on
[1:55:27] and may God heal you it's all I could
[1:55:29] say it's just not there why she had been
[1:55:31] here and there and everywhere you can't
[1:55:33] do that you got to take God in his word
[1:55:35] because if you come in the right
[1:55:37] attitude no one ever come to Christ in
[1:55:40] the right attitude but what went away
[1:55:42] was what they asked for no one ever come
[1:55:45] to Christ with the right attitude but
[1:55:47] what they went away with what they come
[1:55:49] to ask God for he said now that can be
[1:55:51] done if our attitude towards him if we
[1:55:54] come to see him and to love him and to
[1:55:56] worship him then God is obligated to
[1:55:59] give us some things we desire and he
[1:56:01] will withhold no good thing from them
[1:56:03] that walk right up towards him see
[1:56:05] notice this it's the power of the right
[1:56:07] attitude amen you got to come by the
[1:56:09] right approach amen I know it's the
[1:56:11] first night I'm laying some word in here
[1:56:13] you got to come by the right approach
[1:56:15] you've got to come by the right attitude
[1:56:16] remember said look at this God so loved
[1:56:18] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:56:20] son whosoever believeth in him should
[1:56:21] not perish but have everlasting life he
[1:56:24] said that's a little piece of scripture
[1:56:25] just a teeny little one inch square on
[1:56:27] just a piece of paper yet if the right
[1:56:30] attitude is taken to that scripture it
[1:56:33] would change the Eternal destination of
[1:56:35] this world
[1:56:37] foreign
[1:56:38] Church the right attitude towards one
[1:56:41] scripture could change the entire
[1:56:44] Eternal destination of the world come on
[1:56:46] then what about you it's not just
[1:56:48] feeding off a one word of John 3 16 but
[1:56:51] the lamb has descended with an open book
[1:56:54] and a seventh angel who was a prophet of
[1:56:56] God has received the word of God and has
[1:56:59] preached the Revelation my own church we
[1:57:02] ought to change our attitude towards
[1:57:03] Malachi Thor we ought to change our
[1:57:05] attitude towards Luke 17 30. we ought to
[1:57:07] change our attitude towards Revelation
[1:57:09] come on we ought to say oh God this
[1:57:11] weekend change my attitude towards every
[1:57:14] scripture in the word
[1:57:16] [Applause]
[1:57:18] oh brother Andrew I'll tell you what
[1:57:20] amen I'll tell you what I'm here for
[1:57:22] this weekend praise God I'm here for
[1:57:24] that third pull brother I'm here for
[1:57:25] that spoken word brother I'm here to
[1:57:27] move mountains well let me just tell you
[1:57:28] what a prophet said he said God give me
[1:57:30] power to move mountains I tell you I'll
[1:57:32] do something for you Lord if you let me
[1:57:34] move mountains no he wouldn't because he
[1:57:36] can't even move himself to the right
[1:57:37] attitude so he would never move
[1:57:39] mountains for God
[1:57:43] with the wrong attitude you can't even
[1:57:45] move mountains for God come on he said
[1:57:47] he can't even move himself uh Josh you
[1:57:50] got that amen tape back there
[1:57:52] with the wrong attitude he can't even
[1:57:54] move himself into position to even
[1:57:56] receive from God come on friends I think
[1:57:58] we've been letting some things go I
[1:58:00] think we ought to get an attitude change
[1:58:04] your attitude Robert Andrew it's just
[1:58:06] brother Wendell that's your pastor
[1:58:08] change your attitude remember then it's
[1:58:09] just brother Andrew that's your pastor
[1:58:11] change right whatever it's just our
[1:58:13] brother so and so change your attitude
[1:58:18] maybe you can clean it up in the morning
[1:58:21] change your attitude
[1:58:22] whatever Lander I don't know well come
[1:58:25] by the right approach with the right
[1:58:26] attitude in the right atmosphere rubham
[1:58:29] said like this he said look when Jesus
[1:58:31] went in jairus's house he said he went
[1:58:33] in there and they laughed in the scorn
[1:58:34] but when he had put them all out now
[1:58:37] Jesus here shows you that atmospheres
[1:58:39] are not made atmospheres are created
[1:58:44] atmospheres are not made they are
[1:58:47] created because the people in there that
[1:58:49] could help me make an atmosphere he had
[1:58:51] to put them out because the way they
[1:58:53] were approaching him and the attitude
[1:58:55] they had about him he said I can't
[1:58:57] perform in here I can't operate so we
[1:58:59] put the game Sayers and the and the
[1:59:01] unbelievers out and he created his own
[1:59:04] atmosphere and the father God said watch
[1:59:06] each one of you is a Creator do you know
[1:59:09] that each one of your people that's born
[1:59:11] again is a Creator then we must create
[1:59:14] an atmosphere you just keep believing
[1:59:16] and create the atmosphere and never let
[1:59:19] any doubt come around you no matter what
[1:59:22] the circumstances is you push away down
[1:59:24] and you walk right on through it you
[1:59:26] just refuse it do not give doubt no
[1:59:29] grounds at all
[1:59:30] then what is the atmosphere it is a
[1:59:33] surrounding influence or an environment
[1:59:35] then the problem God shows us that a
[1:59:37] spiritual atmosphere is an atmosphere of
[1:59:40] worship and believing he said see oh my
[1:59:42] amen you're going to go to a dance one
[1:59:44] man step say well now he don't know
[1:59:46] whether he wants to dance or not and
[1:59:47] let's go over here playing the music
[1:59:49] near my God to thee huh what an
[1:59:50] atmosphere for a dance he said well
[1:59:52] that's not a lot different than
[1:59:54] atmosphere should go into a church for a
[1:59:55] service to God just that contrary see
[1:59:58] the only thing to bring the right
[2:00:00] atmosphere is then for the dance to put
[2:00:02] on your own music that makes dances now
[2:00:05] watch this and everybody get to thinking
[2:00:07] what a good time they're going to have a
[2:00:10] dancing
[2:00:12] where did oh God
[2:00:14] where did the atmosphere start for the
[2:00:17] dance it started in their thoughts now
[2:00:19] I'm not preaching psychology I'm
[2:00:21] preaching with a prophet saying it
[2:00:23] started in their thoughts they started
[2:00:25] thinking what a good dance we're going
[2:00:27] to have what a loopy time we're going to
[2:00:29] have wanna what a rock and roll time
[2:00:31] we're gonna hat right they started
[2:00:33] thinking that and so forth and they'll
[2:00:35] be having a big whooping up time but you
[2:00:37] put the right kind of music on the piano
[2:00:39] and the right kind of music on the organ
[2:00:42] and everybody in the atmosphere that
[2:00:45] Jesus Christ is there and he's going to
[2:00:47] meet everything they have need of Amen
[2:00:49] something will go to taken place amen
[2:00:51] notice this atmosphere the hardest thing
[2:00:54] there is to do is to get the people in
[2:00:56] the atmosphere of worship he said the
[2:00:59] atmosphere believe him but I propose to
[2:01:01] you what a prophet said If the message
[2:01:03] of the hour comes into a supernatural
[2:01:06] atmosphere it will produce a bride's
[2:01:09] Revival he said like this that's a
[2:01:11] paraphrase we need to produce the word
[2:01:13] again put it on a cross on a nail I'm on
[2:01:15] church if you want to produce this word
[2:01:17] today don't carry it up to Golgotha and
[2:01:19] put it on a cross brother Kevin it will
[2:01:21] produce itself there because there's not
[2:01:23] an atmosphere to produce the word he
[2:01:26] said but put it in the heart of a
[2:01:28] Believer on the right atmosphere it'll
[2:01:30] produce exactly what it says it will do
[2:01:33] it's going to be in the right atmosphere
[2:01:35] you lay it in a seminary or a bible
[2:01:37] school that don't believe in signs and
[2:01:39] wonders you'll never see it Break Forth
[2:01:40] but you gotta put it in the right
[2:01:42] atmosphere can we ask brother random
[2:01:44] what kind of atmosphere what kind of
[2:01:46] atmosphere brother Brandon a surrendered
[2:01:49] atmosphere
[2:01:53] you put this word in a surrendered
[2:01:56] atmosphere it will produce he said if it
[2:01:59] stays there it'll go to taken life if
[2:02:01] you take any promise of God and place it
[2:02:04] in the right atmosphere it will produce
[2:02:06] exactly what the life is in the seed
[2:02:11] wherever you put this message I'm not
[2:02:14] going to preach all night I'm close in a
[2:02:15] minute wherever you put this message it
[2:02:18] will produce the life that's in it
[2:02:22] I don't know well I know you're the
[2:02:24] carrier of the seed
[2:02:27] you are carrying the word seed on the
[2:02:30] inside of you
[2:02:32] now brother Andrew why would you say
[2:02:33] that well because acts the second
[2:02:35] chapter there was a hundred and twenty
[2:02:37] Believers you know what they were
[2:02:39] carrying they were carrying the seed of
[2:02:41] the promise of the father from Luke the
[2:02:43] 24th chapter in their wombs but the
[2:02:46] problem with God said there had to be an
[2:02:47] atmosphere created for the promised word
[2:02:49] of the father to be fulfilled in listen
[2:02:52] this it's the attitude of the people
[2:02:54] that brings the results that's the
[2:02:55] reason that Pentecost they had to go
[2:02:57] into an upper room and pray until the
[2:02:59] Holy Ghost came because they got in one
[2:03:01] place one Accord see it's the atmosphere
[2:03:03] that brings the results do you believe
[2:03:05] that do you believe that
[2:03:07] can you take a prophetic challenge right
[2:03:09] now can you take one from a prophet he
[2:03:12] said let every man and woman in this
[2:03:14] building this morning boy or girl get
[2:03:15] everything from their minds but the Lord
[2:03:18] Jesus and believe that he stand in
[2:03:20] prison right now and you'll see
[2:03:22] something happen that'll cause headlines
[2:03:25] in the newspaper in the morning see it's
[2:03:27] the atmosphere it's the atmosphere that
[2:03:30] brings the miraculous and wonders and
[2:03:32] powers of God Among the people it's the
[2:03:34] atmosphere of the people and when people
[2:03:36] get to a place to reason and wondering
[2:03:38] and stood and take an altar up they
[2:03:40] don't know where they stand he said see
[2:03:42] get in one Accord in one place and
[2:03:44] settle down with one motive and one
[2:03:46] objective then you're going to see
[2:03:49] something happen come on church we
[2:03:51] didn't just come here to hear about
[2:03:52] something happening we come here to see
[2:03:54] something happen
[2:03:57] brother sister I propose to you that
[2:04:00] Bible days are here again
[2:04:02] I propose to you that's a god of history
[2:04:04] is the god of right now I propose to you
[2:04:07] if you'll get your mind on the
[2:04:09] Revelation that Jesus Christ the son of
[2:04:11] God is raised from the dead and he's
[2:04:14] here in the rooms of his resurrection I
[2:04:16] propose to you blinded eyes can come
[2:04:18] open I propose to you that deaf ears can
[2:04:21] be unstopped I propose to you if a dead
[2:04:24] can be raised I propose to you that
[2:04:26] Sinners can be turned into Believers I
[2:04:28] propose to you that prodigals can come
[2:04:31] home apropos to you that all things are
[2:04:34] possible
[2:04:36] I'm not a crazy man I've been under the
[2:04:39] blood I've been through the approach it

[2:06:43] thing I can say is what the blood speaks
[2:06:45] the only thing I can hear is what the
[2:06:47] blood is sounding forth and the blood is
[2:06:50] sounding forgiven

[2:07:58] you get well I just tell you this
[2:07:59] there's two seats to this ride's revival
[2:08:02] you can find the first one in the Book
[2:08:04] of Psalms it's called The Seed of the
[2:08:06] scornful
[2:08:07] so you go sit and see the scoring full
[2:08:10] and everybody that shouts everybody that
[2:08:12] dances everybody that Praises god well
[2:08:14] they ain't got no right to do that and
[2:08:16] they ain't got no right to say that amen
[2:08:18] and then you get in the other seat it's
[2:08:19] found the book of Ephesians you know
[2:08:21] what it's called seated in Heavenly
[2:08:23] places if you will change your seat from
[2:08:26] the seat of the scornful to the seat of
[2:08:28] heavenly places it'll change the way you
[2:08:30] see this weekend come on church if
[2:08:33] you're in the seat of the scornful it's
[2:08:35] another Youth Camp I'm another preacher
[2:08:37] it'll be another prayer line it'll be
[2:08:39] another shout in Hallelujah service but
[2:08:41] if your change seats to the seat of
[2:08:44] heavenly places it'll be the
[2:08:46] resurrection it'll be the supernatural
[2:08:48] it'll be the Shekinah Glory it'll be the
[2:08:51] answer to the devil's question it'll be
[2:08:53] the releasing of the Revelation it'll be
[2:08:55] the porn out of the earth to anoint
[2:08:58] David to be king
[2:09:01] change your seat
[2:09:06] change your seat get out of that old
[2:09:09] seat of the scornful
[2:09:12] feels pretty good to sit up front down
[2:09:14] in Austin feels pretty good to sin in
[2:09:17] Heavenly places I'm gonna borrow my
[2:09:19] buddy brother Ron saying right now if
[2:09:20] all these people are getting on your
[2:09:22] nerves stand up stand up with them
[2:09:24] foreign
[2:09:25] you need to change your seat

[2:09:31] front row seat
[2:09:32] remember what are you getting at I'm
[2:09:34] saying if you can get your heart focused
[2:09:36] through the right approach with the
[2:09:39] right attitude in the right atmosphere
[2:09:45] you will see the result yeah but Andrew
[2:09:48] what are you getting at I'm closing
[2:09:49] right here give me five minutes
[2:09:50] remember said let their faith just meet
[2:09:52] the condition and it will be
[2:09:54] for thou is said in the heart if I
[2:09:57] believe so shall it be make the whole
[2:10:00] atmosphere here Lord a creative
[2:10:03] atmosphere
[2:10:06] I took time today
[2:10:08] Brother Joseph I took time today to read
[2:10:11] to the prophet of God's teachings on
[2:10:12] atmosphere he called it a Heavenly
[2:10:14] atmosphere he called it a perfect
[2:10:16] atmosphere he called it a living
[2:10:19] atmosphere he called it a surrendered
[2:10:21] atmosphere he called it a spiritual
[2:10:23] atmosphere he called it a supernatural
[2:10:25] atmosphere he called it a creative
[2:10:27] atmosphere
[2:10:29] what is a creative atmosphere one mind
[2:10:32] and one Accord in one place
[2:10:35] okay
[2:10:36] so brother Andrew
[2:10:38] this is my Approach
[2:10:40] my attitude
[2:10:41] an atmosphere
[2:10:43] do those really determine the results
[2:10:44] I'll see well can we ask a lady named
[2:10:47] Martha
[2:10:49] Martha was sitting there while Mary was
[2:10:53] doing her normal daily routine her
[2:10:56] activities
[2:10:57] and the prophet of God said why Martha
[2:10:59] was sitting there here come Jesus and
[2:11:02] she went out to meet Jesus
[2:11:04] in other words brother Manuel she didn't
[2:11:06] say Jesus you come to me
[2:11:10] I mean Lord I made it all the way out
[2:11:12] here to Pawnee Oklahoma now if you're
[2:11:13] going to meet me come on down here Lord
[2:11:16] but she got up and went out to meet
[2:11:18] Jesus
[2:11:20] brother Ben said because she had read
[2:11:22] the story of the shunamat woman
[2:11:26] oh God he said now notice this he said
[2:11:29] he didn't have no absolute speaking of
[2:11:31] Elijah he knowed he had power by the
[2:11:33] vision to give her a child but now what
[2:11:34] did he do the cinema woman remember he
[2:11:37] said he took his staff and went down in
[2:11:38] the room and shut all the doors and
[2:11:40] taken everybody else out come on that's
[2:11:43] the same thing Jesus did when he raised
[2:11:46] jairus's daughter he put all the
[2:11:48] unbelievers out and said the atmosphere
[2:11:50] is not conducive to a resurrection the
[2:11:53] atmosphere is not in condition to
[2:11:55] receive life so all these gangstayers
[2:11:57] have got to go and let those who believe
[2:11:59] stay here and Elijah stood there and he
[2:12:02] went over there walked up and down the
[2:12:03] room he said he had an absent if he
[2:12:05] could only contact it he said now what
[2:12:07] did he do he went around went over there
[2:12:10] and laid himself on the baby got back up
[2:12:11] went away and the baby moved got warm
[2:12:14] went back over he said what was it Lord
[2:12:16] what do you say he said now notice this
[2:12:18] when he turned he saw this and he saw
[2:12:20] the little boy running playing jumping
[2:12:22] with a rope something other like that
[2:12:23] and he throwed himself upon the baby and
[2:12:26] he stuck his nose opponent's lips his
[2:12:29] lips upon its lips and the power of God
[2:12:32] raised up the baby life he said what was
[2:12:34] it the woman's absolute was the prophet
[2:12:37] and the prophet's absolute was God and
[2:12:40] together with the word he said I am the
[2:12:43] resurrection and the life I see the
[2:12:45] power of God the Creator can do it see
[2:12:48] she raised up again the baby remember
[2:12:50] said see watch that tells whether you're
[2:12:53] going to the right absolute or not if
[2:12:55] you can read it in the scripture amen
[2:12:57] Martha's absolute was coming from what
[2:13:00] she read in the scripture let's just
[2:13:02] shoot them out woman he said something
[2:13:04] that Christ has ordained or commissioned
[2:13:06] us to do he said don't let somebody
[2:13:08] twist it around you stay right with it
[2:13:11] he's your absolute young people let me
[2:13:13] say with everything within me this
[2:13:15] message is not an opinion it's an
[2:13:17] absolute
[2:13:21] thank you and if you can tie your faith
[2:13:24] to it if you can tie your desires to
[2:13:27] John if you can tie your life to it
[2:13:29] it'll pull you through every situation
[2:13:31] it'll pull you through every dark hour
[2:13:33] it'll pull you through every depression
[2:13:35] it'll pull you through every anxiety
[2:13:37] it'll pull you through ever nervous this
[2:13:39] message is an absolute Anchor Church
[2:13:42] thank you
[2:13:45] I leave your fish if Martha could read
[2:13:48] in the Bible
