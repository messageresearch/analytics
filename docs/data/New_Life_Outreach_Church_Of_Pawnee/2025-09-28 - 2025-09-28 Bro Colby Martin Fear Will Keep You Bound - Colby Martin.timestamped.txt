[38:41] with a meloyy.
[38:45] You surround me with
[38:49] a song
[38:52] of deliverance
[38:56] from my eneies.
[39:01] Till all my fears are gone. I'm no
[39:05] longer a slave to fear. Oh, I'm no
[39:08] longer
[39:10] a slave
[39:12] to fear.
[39:16] I am a child
[39:19] of God.
[39:22] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[39:28] Thank you, Lord, for I am a child of God
[39:35] from my mother's womb. Oh, from my
[39:38] mother's womb. Thank God he's chosen me.
[39:44] Yes, your love has called
[39:49] my name. I've been born again. Oh, I've
[39:53] been born again
[39:56] into this family.
[40:00] Your blood flows through
[40:03] my vein. Are you thankful for that? Oh,
[40:06] I'm no longer a slave. Oh my. Thank you,
[40:12] Lord.
[40:14] Oh, I am a child of God.
[40:20] For I'm no longer a slave to fear,
[40:29] for I am a child of God. You split the
[40:34] seas.
[40:38] You split the sea so I can walk right
[40:42] through. He did that for you. My fears
[40:46] are drowned in perfect love.
[40:50] [Music]
[40:52] You rescued me so I can stand and say
[40:58] I am a child of God. I'm no longer Oh,
[41:04] I'm no longer
[41:08] Yes. Yes. Yes. to fear.
[41:12] Oh, I am a child
[41:17] of God.
[41:19] I'm no longer a slave to fear,
[41:27] for I am a child
[41:31] of God.
[41:35] [Music]
[41:36] Are you a child of God here this
[41:38] morning?
[41:40] If you are, you don't have to be bound
[41:42] by fear. Fear is a liar. Thinking of
[41:45] that song this morning. Fear is a liar.
[41:47] and it is a liar. Amen. We must cast our
[41:51] fears into the fire. Amen. God bless you
[41:54] here this morning. Like to say it's good
[41:56] to be back in the house of the Lord and
[41:58] appreciate brother Caleb stepping up and
[42:00] and helping us out here this morning. I
[42:02] thought he did a good job and um
[42:06] appreciate our musicians. Tell you,
[42:10] Amen. I appreciate them. There was a
[42:12] time when it was just me and Mary. So we
[42:16] we we can never leave because we didn't
[42:18] have any backup musicians. So it's it's
[42:20] really nice to see the next generation
[42:22] stepping up and and and giving their
[42:25] talents to the Lord. I think they're
[42:26] fantastic musicians. Amen. Well, God
[42:29] bless you here this morning. I'd like to
[42:30] turn if we may to First John 4:1.
[42:33] Appreciate Brother Nathaniel as well.
[42:35] Sister Clea's gone, so he's bouncing. If
[42:37] you can see from my angle, he's bouncing
[42:39] from screen to screen. So, Amen. I
[42:42] appreciate him as well. Amen. Amen. But
[42:46] first, John 4 and1,
[42:50] when you're there, say, "Amen."
[42:53] Brother Nathaniel, can we turn to verse
[42:55] four? I took out the first three verses
[42:57] here.
[42:59] Amen. Says, "Ye are of God, little
[43:02] children, and have overcome them because
[43:05] greater is he that is in you than he
[43:08] that is in the world." If we can stay in
[43:11] the same book, same chapter, but drop
[43:12] down to verse 18. 1 John 4 and verse 18.
[43:18] Amen. I know we can. We got the screen
[43:21] here, but I'll wait for y'all to turn in
[43:23] your Bibles. Amen. 1 John 4:18, it says,
[43:27] "For there is no fear in love, but
[43:30] perfect love casteth out fear, because
[43:33] fear has torment. He that fears is not
[43:37] made perfect in love." One more passage
[43:39] of scripture. Let's turn to a very
[43:42] familiar passage. Psalms 23. We're going
[43:44] to read the whole chapter.
[43:47] Amen. Psalms 23 and verse 1-6.
[44:00] When you're there, say amen.
[44:03] Amen. Psalms 23. The Lord is my
[44:05] shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me
[44:09] to lie down in green pastures. He
[44:11] leadeth me beside the still waters. He
[44:14] restoth my soul. He leadth me in the
[44:17] paths of righteousness for his name's
[44:19] sake. And this is the scripture I want
[44:21] to get to. Says, "Yay, though walk
[44:22] through the valley of the shadow of
[44:24] death, I will fear no evil." Say that
[44:26] with me. I will fear no evil, for thou
[44:30] art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they
[44:32] comfort me. Thou preparest a table
[44:35] before me in the presence of mine
[44:37] enemies. And thou anointest my head with
[44:40] oil, and my cup runth over. And I love
[44:42] this. Surely goodness and mercy shall
[44:45] fall on me all the days of my life, and
[44:48] I will dwell in the house of the Lord
[44:51] forever.
[44:53] Amen. May the Lord add his blessings to
[44:54] the reading of the word as you have your
[44:56] seats here tonight. And I do have one
[44:58] more passage of scripture. Ephesians 6
[45:00] and 10. Ephesians 6 and10. and then we
[45:03] can get started. Amen.
[45:09] Sister Loretta, how how far are you
[45:11] alone?
[45:13] So, you got about three weeks left.
[45:15] Let's remember Sister Loretta in our
[45:17] prayers. Amen. I know I know Brother
[45:19] Josh wants to be here for her, but was
[45:22] thinking about you this morning. So,
[45:24] let's pray the Lord just continues to
[45:25] keep his hand upon you. Amen. But
[45:28] Ephesians 6 and verse 10 says, "Finally,
[45:30] my brethren, be strong in the Lord and
[45:32] in the power of his might. Put on the
[45:34] whole armor of God that ye may be able
[45:37] to stand against the ws of the devil.
[45:39] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[45:41] blood, but against principalities and
[45:43] against powers, against the rulers of
[45:46] darkness of this world, against
[45:49] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[45:52] Wherefore taking you unto you the whole
[45:54] armor of God that ye may be able to
[45:57] withstand in the day evil day and having
[46:00] done all to stand. Stand therefore
[46:03] having your loins gird about with truth
[46:05] and having on the breastplate of
[46:07] righteousness and your feet shaw with
[46:09] the prop preparation of the gospel of
[46:11] peace.
[46:13] and above all taking the shield of
[46:15] faith, wherewith ye should be able to
[46:18] quench all the fiery darts of the
[46:20] wicked, and take the helmet of salvation
[46:23] and the sword of the spirit, which is
[46:26] the word of God. And this morning, just
[46:30] for a uh a simple text, I know we've had
[46:33] a lot of ministers speak along these
[46:34] lines, but fear, fear will keep you
[46:37] bound. Fear will keep you bound. And I
[46:40] believe our battle is not in this
[46:43] physical world. It it's it's in the
[46:46] supernatural, the spiritual world. And
[46:49] if we could see into the other dimension
[46:51] right now, we we could see that there
[46:53] are angels present. And I believe the
[46:55] the angels or have surrounded us here
[46:58] this morning. But also there are demons
[47:00] and they are fighting for your thoughts
[47:03] and your emotions and your heart. It is
[47:06] a spiritual warfare. Get that right. So
[47:08] the greatest battle ever fought is it's
[47:10] in our mind. Brother Brandham taught us
[47:12] that it's in our thinking. And so the
[47:14] Bible tells us the different types of of
[47:16] weapons and protections that we will
[47:19] need to deal with the enemy. Um but
[47:22] through the lack of knowledge or
[47:23] understanding, the people perish. That's
[47:25] why it's so important that you you know
[47:28] your Bible. That way whenever the enemy
[47:31] attacks you in a certain area, you have
[47:33] the knowledge of the scripture to combat
[47:35] the devil in that area. And we see that
[47:38] Jesus defeated the devil by using
[47:40] scripture. And if it worked for him and
[47:43] if it was good enough for him, I believe
[47:45] it's good enough for us here this
[47:47] morning. Amen. Now, let me say this that
[47:50] we don't need a head knowledge of the
[47:52] scripture, but what we need is a
[47:54] relationship with the author of the book
[47:57] to where it's not just a duty to read
[48:01] this Bible. It's not just a duty to
[48:03] study it, but it's a love affair.
[48:06] When when you love someone, you you go
[48:10] up and beyond to express that love. And
[48:12] I believe that if you love Christ, you
[48:15] would get up and you would read this
[48:16] word and you would devote your life to
[48:18] the word because this is how you get out
[48:21] of here. This is how you defeat the
[48:23] devil. Ain't that right? And so this
[48:26] morning I want to talk a a little on
[48:28] spirits and want to keep our guard up
[48:31] against because there are many spirits
[48:34] that we we fight on a daily basis. How
[48:37] many can say amen to that? It seems like
[48:39] when when your eyes first open and your
[48:41] feet hit the floor, Satan is is
[48:44] attacking.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; That's why we must start our day out
[48:47] with dedication and devotion to the
[48:49] Lord. Give your day to God. Amen. And
[48:52] let that be the starting point of your
[48:54] day where you wake up and you feel his
[48:57] presence. Amen. Where it's not waking
[49:00] up, getting a cup of coffee or brushing
[49:02] your teeth. I heard brother Robert
[49:03] showers or uh dresses in the shower.
[49:06] Amen. But we start out our day with God
[49:09] being at the helm of our thoughts and at
[49:12] the helm of our heart to where God, I I
[49:14] need you in the decisions that I'm
[49:15] making. Ain't that right? Now, if I can
[49:18] say this here this morning, I I know
[49:20] we're a small group, and I appreciate
[49:22] your patience. I I I uh won't keep you
[49:24] long, but if I can have your attention
[49:26] here this morning, we don't have to be
[49:29] succumbed to the spirits of the age. We
[49:32] don't have to bow down to the devil. We
[49:34] We don't have to give in to the enemy.
[49:36] We don't have to listen to his lies. We
[49:38] don't have to let him pollute our mind
[49:40] and our our thoughts. We don't have to
[49:43] give him the time of day. Hallelujah. We
[49:46] have the power to prevent the thoughts
[49:48] from our we have the power to to not
[49:52] entertain the thoughts of the devil.
[49:55] We don't have to give him authority. You
[49:58] think about it. When a thought enters
[50:00] your mind and you begin to entertain
[50:02] that thought, what's going to happen?
[50:04] &gt;&gt; What will happen?
[50:07] Hello, somebody.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't let him pollute your
[50:12] thoughts and your mind. But one spirit
[50:15] that I feel is really fighting us today
[50:17] is fear. We don't need to live in fear.
[50:22] Ain't that right? It says in the Bible a
[50:24] a total of 365 times that do not fear
[50:28] and fear not and be not afraid. That is
[50:31] that is for every day of the year. It is
[50:33] a reminder from the Lord to live without
[50:36] fear.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. What you fear will come upon you
[50:41] if you're not careful. Job 3:25 says,
[50:43] "For the thing which I greatly feared
[50:46] has come upon me. That which I was
[50:48] afraid of is come unto me." Brother
[50:50] Brandham says here in perfect faith in
[50:53] the book of Job, it says here Job feared
[50:56] and what he feared actually happened.
[50:58] What brought it? It was his fear. That's
[51:01] what made it happen. His faith would
[51:03] have kept him from it, but his fear
[51:06] brought it to him. And he also says
[51:07] here, the worst thing that the devil can
[51:09] put upon you is fear. So fear is one of
[51:13] the worst things that Satan can place
[51:16] upon an individual. Brother Brandham
[51:18] talks about cancer and he says what you
[51:20] fear, if you fear cancer, he says cancer
[51:24] will come upon you. Your fears will
[51:26] bring what you fear into manifestation.
[51:29] Ain't that right? So whatever you fear
[51:31] here this morning, combat that thing.
[51:34] Don't give into fears. If you do, what's
[51:36] going to happen? It will be made
[51:38] manifest in your life. Look at the
[51:40] people in 2020 and how everybody was so
[51:44] afraid of CO. They they locked
[51:46] themselves in their house never to get
[51:47] out. And and what happened? The ones
[51:49] that never got out. The ones that stayed
[51:52] locked in, they still ended up with CO.
[51:55] What they feared was brought into
[51:57] manifestation. We should not live in
[52:00] fear. I I pray I can get my point across
[52:02] here this morning that we should not
[52:04] live in fear. But many people do,
[52:06] sinners and Christians alike are
[52:09] tormented with fear. And we see as long
[52:12] as you obey the spirit of fear, it keeps
[52:16] you from fully trusting in God. It keeps
[52:19] you from fully obeying what God has for
[52:22] you. As long as you're living in fear,
[52:25] you're not obeying the scripture. The
[52:28] Bible says we don't have to live in
[52:30] fear.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; We don't have to give into the spirit of
[52:33] fear. Ain't that right? But as long as
[52:36] you live in fear, you will never be
[52:38] effective in the kingdom of God. You
[52:40] will never be able to use the gifts that
[52:42] God has given you. You will never be
[52:44] able to be used of God the way you need
[52:46] to be because you have now subjected
[52:49] your heart to fear.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you can never say you
[52:55] can't. Or when you say that, that means
[52:57] you are are fearful of trying. And you
[53:00] will never know what you can do until
[53:02] you get past the the spirit of trying.
[53:06] That fear of trying. And there are many
[53:08] types of fear today. And I'm going to go
[53:10] through them real fast. I can't say
[53:12] these names. I'm not that smart. But
[53:13] we're going to run through them just
[53:14] real quick. I'm going to pronounce their
[53:16] meanings. There's fear of bathing.
[53:19] Man, does anyone have a fear of that? I
[53:21] hope not. Hope not. You got a fear of
[53:23] bathing?
[53:25] Fear of darkness, fear of heights, fear
[53:28] of flying. There's fear of pain, fear of
[53:31] open spaces or crowds, fear of needles,
[53:34] fear of riding in a car, fear of men,
[53:36] fear of air, fear of choking, fear of
[53:38] anger, fear of flowers, fear of people,
[53:40] fear of being touched, fear of water, my
[53:42] favorite, fear of peanut butter. My fear
[53:46] of spiders. Amen. I don't like spiders.
[53:50] Fear of numbers. Fear of thunder and and
[53:52] lightning. Fear of outer space. Fear of
[53:54] of untidiness. Fear of imperfection.
[53:56] Fear of failure. Fear of humanlike
[53:59] figures. Oh man. Fear of being alone.
[54:02] Fear of bacteria. Fear of gravity. Fear
[54:04] of stairs. Fear of of pens and needles.
[54:07] Fear of books. Fear of plants. Fear of
[54:08] smelling bad. That's my fear. I don't
[54:10] want to sound like it's smelling bad.
[54:12] Fear of ugliness. Oh boy. Fear of being
[54:16] ridiculed. Fear of mirrors. Fear of
[54:18] snow. Fear of spending money. I don't
[54:20] have that fear. Amen. Fear of colors,
[54:24] fear of clocks, fear of time, fear of
[54:26] food, fear of confined spaces, fear,
[54:28] fear of being trapped, fear of climbing,
[54:30] fear of clowns, fear of computers, fear
[54:31] of dogs, fear of demons, fear of making
[54:34] decisions, fear of madness, fear of
[54:35] trees, fear of dentists, fear of houses,
[54:38] fear of accidents, fear of home, cats,
[54:40] vomiting, crowds, insects, teenagers.
[54:42] There's
[54:44] Amen. I think that's every parent's
[54:46] fear. Amen. Fear of horses and fear of
[54:50] marriage. Fear, fear of knees, fear of
[54:53] speaking in public, fear of women,
[54:54] touch, sun, blood, reptiles, the number
[54:57] 666, fear of long words. And if you
[55:00] could only look at the at the word
[55:01] that's described in this, it's the
[55:03] longest word out of them all. And it's
[55:05] fear of long words. Water, illness,
[55:07] doctors, insects, uh, germs, my
[55:10] goodness. Night, fear of being without
[55:12] your phone, fear of hospitals, diseases,
[55:15] dark, weight gain. Yeah. Figure eight.
[55:18] and and rain, fear of eyes, snakes,
[55:20] birds, smells, shellfish, paper. I mean,
[55:23] you can go on and on and on and on. I'm
[55:26] so glad that these fears have a name.
[55:29] I'm so glad that these fears have a name
[55:31] because every name has to bow to the
[55:33] name of Jesus Christ here this morning.
[55:35] So, we can continue on and they have
[55:37] name after name after name and
[55:39] definition of of sleep and speed and
[55:41] monsters. But to this morning, whatever
[55:44] you fear has to bow to the name of Jesus
[55:47] Christ here this morning. We don't have
[55:49] to let this fear, whatever you're
[55:51] facing, sir and overtake your life, but
[55:55] allow yourself to surrender to God. Give
[55:59] it to God.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:02] My goodness, we got so many more holes
[56:04] and fear of beautiful women and germs
[56:06] and witchcraft and the color yellow and
[56:09] and foreigners and animals and vacuum
[56:11] cleaners. We can continue to go on and
[56:14] on and on. If I can say this, fear has
[56:16] torment. I would imagine every one of us
[56:19] has had some kind of fear before or
[56:20] you're facing fear today. And we can all
[56:23] say amen to this. Fear does have
[56:24] torment. It will torment you. It will
[56:27] take your sleep. It it takes your
[56:29] thoughts. it. If you're not careful and
[56:31] you submit yourself to that spirit of
[56:33] fear, it will take your mind. It causes
[56:36] people to go insane. But this isn't from
[56:39] God, but from your enemy, the devil. God
[56:42] does not torment you. He gives you
[56:44] peace. It is God that gives you peace.
[56:47] The devil wants to torment your mind. He
[56:49] wants to plague your mind. He He wants
[56:51] to take your sanity and your peace and
[56:54] your joy, but it's not from God. God
[56:56] gives you a spirit of peace. And if you
[56:59] only allow him to come in and take out
[57:01] that fear, God will restore your joy
[57:04] again. He will restore your mind again.
[57:07] You say, "Brother Kobe, I I feel like
[57:08] I'm losing my mind. I'm going crazy."
[57:10] Give it to God, man. Trying their self
[57:13] with all these different kind of drugs
[57:14] and and medicines to try to to try to
[57:17] calm depression and anxiety. But there's
[57:20] something that's better than anything
[57:21] the doctors can give you. It's Jesus
[57:23] Christ. He is the one that can take the
[57:26] fear. He can take the anxiety, the
[57:29] oppression, whatever you're facing this
[57:31] morning. Oh my. Jesus says here in John
[57:34] 10:10, "The thief cometh not but to
[57:36] steal and to kill and to destroy, but I
[57:39] come that you might have life, and that
[57:42] you might have it more abundantly. I am
[57:45] the good shepherd, and the good shepherd
[57:47] giveth his life for his sheep." He goes
[57:50] down to verse 14, says, "I am the good
[57:53] shepherd and know my sheep." Oh, thank
[57:56] God for that. And am known of mine. But
[58:00] why do people have fear? Because fear is
[58:04] the working of Satan to keep you from
[58:06] fully trusting God. When you live in
[58:09] fear, you can't trust God. Hello,
[58:12] somebody. When you live in fear, you
[58:15] can't trust God. There's fear of death
[58:18] now and fear of accidents, fear of being
[58:20] robbed, and fear of losing your home.
[58:22] And the list of fears is never ending as
[58:25] long as you are afraid. And you give
[58:28] power to that devil. You say, "Brother
[58:30] Kobe, I can't seem to to get rid of it."
[58:33] Or what kind of power are you giving it?
[58:38] Hallelujah.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Only you can entertain that thought.
[58:42] Only you can feed that thought and let
[58:44] it grow in your mind because it starts
[58:46] out as a seed, something very small. How
[58:49] does a seed grow?
[58:53] I'm going to open this up. This is class
[58:55] participation here this morning. How
[58:57] does a seed grow?
[59:00] Water, sunshine. That's right. The right
[59:04] ground. How does a seed grow in your
[59:06] mind?
[59:10] What you listen to,
[59:12] what you watch. You say, "Brother Kobe,
[59:13] I'm I'm fighting depression." Okay. You
[59:16] say, "I I can't seem to get rid of this
[59:18] depression." What are you watching?
[59:21] What are you listening to?
[59:23] What are you reading? What are you
[59:26] allowing your mind, your body to be
[59:29] subject to?
[59:31] You say, "I want this depression." Now,
[59:32] why don't you put on some godly music in
[59:34] your home? Why don't you get rid of all
[59:36] all those soaps or whatever they watch
[59:38] these days? All the things that keep you
[59:40] depressed and that keep you you battered
[59:42] down. The music that you listen to. I'm
[59:44] a big fan. Well, not a big fan, but I I
[59:47] do like a few songs of Forest Frank, but
[59:50] if that's all I ever listen to, do you
[59:52] really think it's going to help me
[59:53] overcome the spirits of the age?
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Do you really think me wanting to lose
[59:59] weight right here, eating junk food all
[1:00:02] the time, and I'm always always
[1:00:03] complaining that I can never lose
[1:00:04] weight, but I have a burger and a shake
[1:00:06] in my hand, Patrick? Yeah.
[1:00:09] Do you really think I have a right to
[1:00:11] complain if I'm not taking the proper
[1:00:13] steps or proper channels to to lose the
[1:00:16] weight? We're always complaining to God,
[1:00:17] but God, why haven't you you got me out
[1:00:20] of this depression? And God, why are
[1:00:22] these chains of anxiety still in my
[1:00:23] life? What are you doing about it? You
[1:00:25] have a job to do.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; You have to do something. God wants to
[1:00:30] take it out of your life, but you got to
[1:00:32] quit feeding the seed and kill it.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Destroy it. Let God come in and take the
[1:00:38] root out.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; But you will never get over your fears
[1:00:44] without God. Why do you think you need
[1:00:46] the new birth? And why do you think you
[1:00:49] need the Holy Ghost? You need a a
[1:00:51] stability at the helm. You need someone
[1:00:53] there that can govern you when you're
[1:00:55] going down the wrong path or you feel
[1:00:57] the thoughts coming in your mind. You
[1:00:59] need someone there to tell you that,
[1:01:01] hey, that's wrong. Hey, you got to let
[1:01:03] that out. Hey, you got to let that
[1:01:04] bitterness go. Hey, that fear that
[1:01:06] you're holding on, I'm here. I'm the
[1:01:08] captain. I'm at the helm. Let it go.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; He is the stability in your life.
[1:01:15] Without God, fear will reign in your
[1:01:17] life. Remember, the heart does need a
[1:01:19] captain.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; You have two captains. You got fear or
[1:01:25] faith. You got the devil or you got God.
[1:01:28] What are you going to be governed by? I
[1:01:30] hope this is okay this morning. But what
[1:01:33] you fear will
[1:01:36] become your master.
[1:01:39] We see that Satan is at work in the
[1:01:40] world today with with murder and with
[1:01:44] hate and with wars and with sickness. A
[1:01:46] and the church h has become accustomed
[1:01:50] to the onslaught that the devil is
[1:01:51] throwing at us. He we have been
[1:01:53] accustomed to living in defeat. Oh my.
[1:01:56] We have been accustomed to living bound
[1:01:58] and to living sick and to living in
[1:02:00] condemnation. But I think here this
[1:02:02] morning, we got to say enough is enough.
[1:02:05] We got to say enough is enough. I know
[1:02:07] we've grown accustomed to the change
[1:02:08] that we have been in, but I'm here to
[1:02:10] tell you there is a chain breaker this
[1:02:12] morning, and we don't have to leave this
[1:02:14] house, this church the same way.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; We can allow God to come in and break
[1:02:19] the chain. I I know, I know, I know I'm
[1:02:22] probably beating a dead horse here this
[1:02:24] morning, but pride, pride, pride will
[1:02:26] leave you bound.
[1:02:29] It will leave you in in in a state that
[1:02:32] you've been in year after year after
[1:02:34] year. It's time to swallow up pride
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; and say, "God, I can't do this on my
[1:02:40] own." And God, I I need help here this
[1:02:42] morning. We get so so used and we we
[1:02:45] want to we want to be looking good and
[1:02:47] we don't want people thinking that we've
[1:02:48] done something wrong by by coming to the
[1:02:50] altar and by by confessing our sin.
[1:02:53] That's pride.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Satan loves pride. What got him kicked
[1:02:56] out of heaven? Yeah,
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; pride.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; And if he can keep pride in the heart,
[1:03:02] God will never allow you will never have
[1:03:04] a full breakthrough. But I'm here to
[1:03:06] tell you this morning, release the pride
[1:03:08] and you can let the fears go as well.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Boy, I hope this is okay here this
[1:03:13] morning. It's it's been my heart.
[1:03:16] Matthew 6 and 24 says, "No man can serve
[1:03:18] two masters,
[1:03:20] for either he will hate the one and love
[1:03:22] the other, or else he will hold on to
[1:03:24] the one and despise the other." You
[1:03:27] cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore,
[1:03:29] I say unto you, take no thought for your
[1:03:32] life, what you shall eat, or what you
[1:03:34] shall drink, nor yet for your body what
[1:03:36] you shall put on. Is not the life more
[1:03:39] than meat and the body than raignment.
[1:03:42] If we can also turn to Matthew 6 and30
[1:03:46] because people are worried about the
[1:03:48] unknown.
[1:03:50] In Matthew 6:30 says, "Wherefore, if God
[1:03:52] so clothe the grass of the field, which
[1:03:54] today is, and tomorrow is cast into the
[1:03:57] oven, shall we not much more clothe ye,
[1:04:00] oh ye of little faith?" Therefore, take
[1:04:02] no thought in what shall we eat, or what
[1:04:05] shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be
[1:04:07] clothed? For after all these things do
[1:04:10] the Gentiles seek, for your heavenly
[1:04:12] Father knoweth that ye have need of all
[1:04:14] things. I love this next part of
[1:04:16] scripture says, "But seek ye first the
[1:04:19] kingdom of God and his righteousness,
[1:04:22] and all of these things shall be added
[1:04:24] unto you." First John 4 and 18 says,
[1:04:27] "For there is no fear in love,
[1:04:30] but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:04:34] because fear hath torment. He that
[1:04:35] fearth is not made perfect in love."
[1:04:38] Verse 19 says, "We love him because he
[1:04:41] first loved us." Are you thankful for
[1:04:43] that here this morning? But we know we
[1:04:46] are in an age that 200,000,000 demons
[1:04:50] have been released. I'm about to bring
[1:04:53] this to a close here in a few minutes.
[1:04:54] So bear with me. Now,
[1:04:57] these demons have been released for the
[1:04:59] sole purpose of destroying you and
[1:05:02] getting you off of your path to get you
[1:05:05] comfortable service after service and
[1:05:08] year after year in the condition that
[1:05:10] you're in. And I understand the cares of
[1:05:13] life can put us to sleep and it we can
[1:05:18] become laxed and we can become tired.
[1:05:20] And I'm thinking of you sisters and my I
[1:05:23] have high respect for you mothers and
[1:05:25] you sisters here this morning.
[1:05:28] But taking care of your husband and your
[1:05:30] house and your children. I I can see my
[1:05:33] my wife I'm just speaking from my heart
[1:05:35] for a minute. I I I wish my wife was
[1:05:37] here to to give her the flowers she
[1:05:39] deserves. I found out I don't know how
[1:05:43] to iron a shirt. I should try this
[1:05:45] morning.
[1:05:48] Do what?
[1:05:50] Well, I have it on so I'm not taking my
[1:05:52] jacket off,
[1:05:54] but I have high respect for her and
[1:05:57] seeing
[1:05:59] what she deals with and the weight. I'm
[1:06:01] so, you know, I thank God every day for
[1:06:03] her that I I wouldn't be here if it
[1:06:06] wasn't for her. We're going on on 15
[1:06:09] years of marriage. It's hard to believe.
[1:06:11] Thank you. 15 years of marriage. And
[1:06:15] honestly, if it was up to her, she
[1:06:16] probably would already left. But I'm so
[1:06:19] glad that God kept us together. Amen.
[1:06:23] But seeing the weight that's on her
[1:06:25] shoulders and what she does and how she
[1:06:27] cries and the insecurities that come.
[1:06:30] And it's in these moments, these moments
[1:06:32] of weakness where Satan will come in and
[1:06:35] he will plant thoughts that that that
[1:06:37] that that that
[1:06:39] husband doesn't care and that God
[1:06:41] doesn't care and they plant fear and
[1:06:43] anxiety and depression that nobody cares
[1:06:45] for me and nobody loves me and that God
[1:06:48] has forgotten about me. Let me tell you
[1:06:50] something. God has not forgotten about
[1:06:52] you. Hello, somebody. He has heard your
[1:06:55] prayers and he has seen the tears
[1:06:57] because it's in those moments that I
[1:06:59] know as as a husband I face the fears of
[1:07:02] am I a good enough husband? Am I a good
[1:07:05] enough father? Have I done everything I
[1:07:07] can? And that now that my children are
[1:07:09] hitting the teenage years have I done
[1:07:11] everything I can to to put the gospel in
[1:07:14] their heart where Satan's going to come
[1:07:16] in and fight. Have I done enough? Have I
[1:07:18] done enough? It's a fear. It's anxiety.
[1:07:22] I faced the fears of of of not being
[1:07:25] loved and not not not really, you know,
[1:07:28] may maybe I the world would be a better
[1:07:29] place without me or or or maybe the the
[1:07:32] family would be better without me.
[1:07:35] I face those fears. And it's in those
[1:07:38] times of fears, if you're not careful,
[1:07:41] you'll begin to entertain the thought of
[1:07:43] suicide.
[1:07:45] I hope this is okay. You say, "How do
[1:07:47] you know, brother Kobe? I fought it. I
[1:07:50] faced it. I almost gave into the fears
[1:07:53] of not being good enough. But let me
[1:07:55] tell you something. Those are lies
[1:07:58] straight from the pits of hell. Those
[1:08:00] are a fear that Satan puts upon you.
[1:08:03] Remember, God does not give you the
[1:08:05] spirit of fear, but of power and of love
[1:08:09] and of a sound mind. It is God that
[1:08:12] stabilizes your mind, stabilizes your
[1:08:15] marriage, stabilizes your family. It is
[1:08:18] God that keeps his hand upon your life.
[1:08:21] It is God. God dictates our life, not
[1:08:24] fear.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; In a world that has gone insane, that
[1:08:30] has lost their mind. In a world that's
[1:08:32] governed by fear, the bride has a
[1:08:35] testimony that she has a sound mind here
[1:08:38] this morning.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; It's not your abilities.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; It's not your gifts. It's not your good
[1:08:46] looks. It's not prestige. It is God.
[1:08:50] What do you think the world has gone and
[1:08:52] say they're living off fear by what they
[1:08:54] watch? Have you noticed today that seems
[1:08:57] like every new movie that comes out,
[1:08:59] it's a horror film. What is it doing?
[1:09:01] It's plague of the minds with fear.
[1:09:04] People are living in fear. But the bride
[1:09:07] does not have to live in fear. She is
[1:09:09] being governed.
[1:09:11] Governed by God.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; I hope that's okay. Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; But there are three realms that I
[1:09:22] that we fight that the spirits can go
[1:09:24] into. We understand a dad did a a heavy
[1:09:27] study on this a while back, but it's the
[1:09:29] body, it's the spirit,
[1:09:32] and it's in your soul. What is in your
[1:09:36] soul will govern your five senses of
[1:09:40] your spirit and five senses of the body
[1:09:43] because we are governed by what? taste,
[1:09:45] smell, touch or feel, hearing and
[1:09:49] seeing. Correct? Can anyone tell me what
[1:09:51] the five manifestations are of the
[1:09:53] spirit man?
[1:10:00] Okay.
[1:10:02] Okay.
[1:10:05] Okay.
[1:10:07] Okay. We understand that what that dad
[1:10:10] taught us that all of these are going to
[1:10:13] the soul.
[1:10:14] Out of the abundant out of the abundance
[1:10:16] of the mouth the heart or out of the
[1:10:19] abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:10:20] speaketh. What you have here is what
[1:10:23] will come out here. Ain't that right?
[1:10:25] Brother Bram says here now you've got
[1:10:27] your senses. You got see, taste, feel,
[1:10:29] smell, and hear. They're they're all
[1:10:31] right. But don't trust them unless they
[1:10:35] agree with the word. They're all right.
[1:10:36] But if they disagree with the word,
[1:10:38] don't listen to them. Now, imaginations,
[1:10:40] conscience, memories, reasons, and
[1:10:43] affection, they're all right if they
[1:10:45] agree with the word. But if your
[1:10:48] affection doesn't agree with the word,
[1:10:50] get rid of it. You blow a a flu real
[1:10:53] quick. That's right. See, if your reason
[1:10:57] disagrees with the word, get away from
[1:10:58] it. That's right. The engine, your
[1:11:00] memory, your imaginations, your
[1:11:01] conscience, anything disagrees with that
[1:11:04] on the inside, get rid of them. That's
[1:11:07] good advice. If there's anything that's
[1:11:09] going on in your life that's keeping you
[1:11:11] away from God, get rid of it.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; But we see here that we are fighting.
[1:11:20] I'm at 30 minutes. Give me a few more
[1:11:22] minutes here. We see that we are
[1:11:24] fighting a real enemy. Ain't that right?
[1:11:27] And he does have a real influence.
[1:11:31] He is real. His presence has been made
[1:11:34] known. We we can see him in the world in
[1:11:36] a powerful way today, can't we? But we
[1:11:39] don't have to fear him. But we can't go
[1:11:41] through life pretending that he does not
[1:11:43] exist. You say, "Brother Kobe, spirits
[1:11:47] don't influence." Well, I'm my old man.
[1:11:49] Are you really your old man?
[1:11:53] Hello, somebody.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; What about the conversation that
[1:11:57] happened in heaven where where God
[1:11:59] asked, "Who will go and deceive Ahab?" A
[1:12:02] lion spirit came and said, "I will."
[1:12:05] What happened when that spirit went into
[1:12:07] the 400 prophets of Baal?
[1:12:12] They lied, didn't they? And we see that
[1:12:14] there's a lot of deception going on in
[1:12:16] the land today. Just bear with me as I
[1:12:18] as I get through this here, where people
[1:12:20] feel that they're all right in the
[1:12:22] condition that they're in. And and they
[1:12:24] feel like they have the right to correct
[1:12:25] what the prophet said. But I'm telling
[1:12:27] you here this morning that these are
[1:12:29] spirits from the pits of hell.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Satan is the only one that can plant
[1:12:36] doubt in your mind. Cast that spirit
[1:12:39] out. 2 Corinthians 10:3 says, "For
[1:12:42] though we walk in the flesh, we do not
[1:12:44] war after the flesh. For the weapons of
[1:12:46] our warfare is not carnal, but mighty
[1:12:49] through God to the pulling down of
[1:12:50] strongholds, casting down imaginations,
[1:12:53] and every high thing that exaltth itself
[1:12:55] against the knowledge of God, and bring
[1:12:57] it into captivity. Every thought, every
[1:13:01] thought, fear, anxiety, depression,
[1:13:05] suicide, whatever it is, well, I I'm not
[1:13:07] good enough. every thought to the
[1:13:10] obedience
[1:13:12] of Christ.
[1:13:14] Brother Brandham says here, "Now today,
[1:13:15] so many people are listening to enticing
[1:13:18] spirits in thestead of taking the word
[1:13:21] of God." Spirits, they're in the world.
[1:13:23] They're demons. They go into places and
[1:13:24] and get amongst ministers. They get
[1:13:27] amongst church members. They get amongst
[1:13:29] good people that cause them to do things
[1:13:32] and they say things and do things and
[1:13:34] teach things and practice things that's
[1:13:36] contrary to the word of God. If I can
[1:13:38] say this, why would we want to allow an
[1:13:41] entrance for the devil to come in when
[1:13:43] we're trying to keep him out?
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Why do we allow the devil to come in
[1:13:52] without a fight?
[1:13:55] You say, "Brother Kobe, how's that
[1:13:56] possible? If I'm fighting spirits in my
[1:13:58] home, I got to look as the husband of
[1:14:00] the home, what am I am I allowing to
[1:14:02] come into my home?"
[1:14:05] Okay. What movies have I allowed to come
[1:14:07] into my home? Okay. What music have I
[1:14:09] allowed my children to listen to? What
[1:14:11] things are they reading? What what
[1:14:13] things are are they thinking about?
[1:14:14] Because if there's a spirit of of of of
[1:14:18] contentment in the house, where does it
[1:14:19] come from?
[1:14:22] Okay, it comes from the devil. How is it
[1:14:25] controlling my house, my home, my
[1:14:27] marriage, my family? What am I doing to
[1:14:30] prevent it? There's a lot of times we
[1:14:32] allow things to come into our home and
[1:14:34] into our heart, into our mind without
[1:14:36] putting up a fight.
[1:14:41] You say, "Brother Kobe, if we put up a
[1:14:43] fight, will we have a perfect marriage?"
[1:14:44] I wish we would. I wish our marriage
[1:14:47] would be perfect. I I wish I could say
[1:14:50] me and my wife's never fought. I I wish
[1:14:52] I could say that that my that me and my
[1:14:53] children have never got into it. But if
[1:14:55] God is at the helm, there's forgiveness.
[1:15:01] There may be times we fight out of fear.
[1:15:04] There may be times we fight out out of
[1:15:06] things that are or whatever is going on
[1:15:08] in our life. But if God's there,
[1:15:09] forgiveness is there.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I'll I'll get away from that.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; But you become what you eat. You become
[1:15:18] what you watch. Brother Brandham says
[1:15:19] here, brother, with when this old heart
[1:15:21] gets right with God, the eagle spirit
[1:15:23] begins to move up and you climb above
[1:15:25] these things of the world. The trouble
[1:15:27] of it of it is is we're not attending
[1:15:28] prayer meeting and attending church and
[1:15:31] doing what's right. We're staying whole
[1:15:33] to to to see some movie play or
[1:15:35] something like that on televisions or
[1:15:37] uncensored programs, some of these dirty
[1:15:39] jokes and things they're cracking.
[1:15:41] That's the wrong thing to put our young
[1:15:44] generation of people to. Used to be it
[1:15:46] was wrong for the people, holiness
[1:15:48] people to go to the movies. The devil
[1:15:51] pulled one on them. He put one right in
[1:15:54] the house. That is right.
[1:15:57] Now it's no longer a a big old TV
[1:15:59] screen.
[1:16:01] It's this right here.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Hope this is okay. Fear comes from this.
[1:16:06] The news all the time. News after news.
[1:16:10] Do we find anything edified out of the
[1:16:12] news anymore? What is the news there to
[1:16:14] do? To install fear.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Movies. It's easy. If I can say this,
[1:16:21] and forgive me if I'm just being too
[1:16:22] blunt with this, it's now easy enough
[1:16:26] to find pornography
[1:16:29] right here.
[1:16:31] At my age, we didn't have phones.
[1:16:34] Honest, if I can just be honest, if
[1:16:35] there's things that we were fighting at
[1:16:36] that time, we had to go to the store and
[1:16:37] buy magazines or whatever else. Now,
[1:16:39] it's right here. It's right here.
[1:16:42] Everything is at the push of a button
[1:16:44] right here. Things you can watch, things
[1:16:46] you can listen to, right here. Just as
[1:16:48] it's easy enough to see the pollution of
[1:16:51] the world right here on your device,
[1:16:53] it's easy enough now to get the message
[1:16:55] of the hour.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Just as Satan is throwing all his
[1:16:58] tactics through this device, God is
[1:17:01] throwing tactics through this device as
[1:17:03] well, saying, "Here's the message of the
[1:17:05] hour." You're fighting depression.
[1:17:07] Listen to the message.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; But movies are are now are
[1:17:14] indoctrinating our young people. I'm
[1:17:16] almost done. as the musicians get get
[1:17:18] ready to come. They're starting to push
[1:17:20] homosexuality where where kids think
[1:17:22] it's normal now to have two dads a two
[1:17:25] mothers. And if I can say this, music is
[1:17:28] also indoctrinating our young people.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Indoctrinating society. I'm still
[1:17:35] speaking on fear. Bear with me now.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Satan is pushing an agenda to keep you
[1:17:41] bound to this world. And he's used
[1:17:44] whatever tactic he can to keep us
[1:17:46] suppressed, to keep us down, to keep us
[1:17:49] bound. But I'm here to tell you this
[1:17:51] morning, you don't have to be under that
[1:17:53] suppression any longer.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:18:01] People are living out what they watch
[1:18:02] and what they read.
[1:18:05] You say, "Brother Kobe, music don't
[1:18:07] influence." Well, I beg to differ.
[1:18:10] People are listening to a song and they
[1:18:12] go out and and live out that song. And
[1:18:15] we can see in the Bible when Saul was
[1:18:17] possessed by a demon, David would play
[1:18:19] music and that spirit would leave. Ain't
[1:18:22] that right? Just as bad music can
[1:18:24] influence demonic forces and it can fuel
[1:18:27] that fear,
[1:18:29] good music, oh my,
[1:18:32] can bring a troubled heart that's
[1:18:34] struggling with fear, that's struggling
[1:18:36] with the thoughts of the everyday
[1:18:38] living. It can bring a a spirit within
[1:18:41] that home to calm the mind and the
[1:18:42] heart. Oh my.
[1:18:45] You got to understand here this morning.
[1:18:49] That we're in an age of of of of
[1:18:51] technology where it's just keeping us so
[1:18:53] busy.
[1:18:55] Don't have time for God anymore, but we
[1:18:57] can sure go watch a football game. We
[1:19:00] don't got time anymore, but I can I can
[1:19:02] sure go out and play golf. Spend four
[1:19:04] hours at a golf course. We we we we we
[1:19:06] we don't have time to to pray and
[1:19:08] dedicate our life, but we can sure do
[1:19:10] this and to do that. I think it's time
[1:19:12] that we bring dedication back into the
[1:19:14] home and to the church again.
[1:19:16] It's time that the church is not living
[1:19:18] under the thumb of the devil anymore.
[1:19:19] Come on, somebody. I know this is simple
[1:19:21] here this morning, but I'm I'm trying to
[1:19:23] tell you that fear fear fear is a tactic
[1:19:26] that we don't have to live by anymore.
[1:19:30] Oh my.
[1:19:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I hope this has
[1:19:35] been okay.
[1:19:37] Amen. Amen. I'm so glad
[1:19:41] you say, "Brother Colobby, I want to be
[1:19:42] free."
[1:19:44] If you want to be free here this
[1:19:46] morning,
[1:19:48] they're the chain breaker. Oh my.
[1:19:51] There's someone here. It's not you, not
[1:19:54] your pastor,
[1:19:56] it's not your husband or spouse. It's
[1:19:58] it's God himself. Only God can break you
[1:20:01] of the chains. Only Only God can deliver
[1:20:03] you of the of the fear that you have in
[1:20:05] your mind.
[1:20:07] Ain't that right?
[1:20:09] Skip through some of this real quick.
[1:20:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:20:17] You love him here this morning.
[1:20:20] Amen. God
[1:20:22] God is good.
[1:20:25] Amen. Amen.
[1:20:30] You say, "Brother Colby, I
[1:20:35] make mistakes and I've I've
[1:20:38] I've made a lot." Well, you're looking
[1:20:39] at a person that's made a lot.
[1:20:44] You see, Brother Kobe, I can't get past
[1:20:45] the condemnation of of what I've done,
[1:20:48] and I
[1:20:50] I wish I can get past it.
[1:20:53] God can get you past that condemnation
[1:20:55] here this morning. I faced it for many
[1:20:58] many years of condemnation things I've
[1:21:00] done and of of the things I've I've said
[1:21:04] thought complexes from things that I've
[1:21:07] done in my life and I I I I wish I can
[1:21:10] say I would never make a mistake again
[1:21:14] but I don't have to live by the fear of
[1:21:16] condemnation.
[1:21:17] Hello somebody.
[1:21:20] As long as we're in this flesh we are
[1:21:23] going to make mistakes.
[1:21:25] You're going to see something you
[1:21:26] regret. I don't care if you're as as
[1:21:29] awesome as our deacon, brother Harry.
[1:21:32] Nothing ever gets under his skin. I wish
[1:21:34] I had I wish I was Brother Harry.
[1:21:37] But things get under my skin. And as
[1:21:40] long as we're in this flesh, we're going
[1:21:41] to fight things that are mine. We're
[1:21:44] going to fight fears, brother Joe. We'll
[1:21:46] face we'll fight fears. But what makes
[1:21:48] us different from the world is we are
[1:21:51] not giving oursel over to that fear.
[1:21:55] If it was how the world lives without
[1:21:58] God, it's easy to give into the fear,
[1:22:00] the anger, the resentment, the the
[1:22:02] bitterness, the hatred that we see in
[1:22:03] our society today. It's easy to do it.
[1:22:06] What makes us different is God is right
[1:22:08] here. God is right here. And when we go
[1:22:12] through something in our mind and it
[1:22:13] feels like we're going to lose control,
[1:22:15] it is God that steers the ship. Oh, I
[1:22:19] wish we could see that here this
[1:22:20] morning.
[1:22:24] Oh my.
[1:22:27] I will skip through all of this here.
[1:22:29] Can we bow our heads here tonight?
[1:22:31] Heavenly Father, we love you.
[1:22:35] And Father,
[1:22:37] you've told us that we don't have to
[1:22:41] live in a spirit of fear that it's not
[1:22:44] from you, Lord, but you've given us a
[1:22:46] sound mind.
[1:22:49] And Lord, I know every individual in
[1:22:51] here has faced some kind of fears before
[1:22:56] of not being accepted or loved, not
[1:22:59] being good enough,
[1:23:02] face the thought of, well, what what
[1:23:04] what's going to happen when I do have
[1:23:06] children or or the children I do have?
[1:23:09] What have I done enough, Lord? And we
[1:23:11] can, if we're not careful, the fears
[1:23:13] will drive us insane, Lord. But we
[1:23:16] understand that this is a tactic from
[1:23:18] the devil, but it's not from you. And
[1:23:20] this morning, Father, if anyone is
[1:23:22] facing fear and anxiety and oppression
[1:23:25] or depression here this morning, Lord,
[1:23:28] whatever form of fear may be in their
[1:23:31] hearts, I pray that you perform surgery,
[1:23:34] Lord, and cut it out. Root out the
[1:23:37] bitterness, the anxiety, Father, the
[1:23:39] resentment, whatever, whatever it is,
[1:23:41] Lord. Whatever fear is plaguing the
[1:23:43] hearts of your people, we're not
[1:23:45] ordained to be held down by fear. God,
[1:23:48] you put us here to overcome it, not be
[1:23:50] controlled by it. And here this morning,
[1:23:52] Lord, I pray that every heart which is
[1:23:54] open up to you, Lord, examine the
[1:23:56] hearts, Father, from the youngest to the
[1:23:59] oldest, from the front, from myself,
[1:24:01] Lord, in the front all the way to the
[1:24:02] back with brother Harry, Lord, Sister
[1:24:05] Stephanie, Father, there in in the in
[1:24:08] the Sunday school or the the nursery.
[1:24:10] Lord, I pray from back there to up here,
[1:24:12] Lord, that you examine every heart.
[1:24:16] You see, every life, Lord, we want to
[1:24:18] please you, Father.
[1:24:20] Our heart is to please you, Lord.
[1:24:24] We don't want nothing to stand in
[1:24:27] between you and you and us. Father, take
[1:24:30] everything out. Lord, my heart is open.
[1:24:33] Take out any anything, Lord. any off
[1:24:36] that I may have, any complexes I may
[1:24:39] have, any fear Lord that I may have,
[1:24:43] take it out, Lord, here this morning,
[1:24:45] Father. May there be a liberty in this
[1:24:47] church once again. May there be a
[1:24:49] liberty in the hearts of your people,
[1:24:51] Lord.
[1:24:53] Thank you, Father. We thank you for your
[1:24:56] mercy and your love.
[1:24:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:25:03] Amen. And how does that song start? That
[1:25:05] ver first verse.
[1:25:09] Oh, fear
[1:25:12] is a liar.
[1:25:16] It will take your breath, stop you in
[1:25:20] your steps.
[1:25:22] Fear
[1:25:25] is a liar.
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:29] It will rob your rest, steal your
[1:25:33] happiness,
[1:25:35] cast your fears
[1:25:39] in the fire,
[1:25:42] cause fear,
[1:25:45] he is alive. Can we do verse one now?
[1:25:49] When he told you you're not good enough.
[1:25:53] When he told you you're not right.
[1:25:56] When he told you you're not strong
[1:25:58] enough to put up a good fight.
[1:26:02] When he told you you're not worthy. When
[1:26:06] he told you you're not loved. When he
[1:26:10] told you you're not beautiful. You'll
[1:26:13] never be enough of fear.
[1:26:19] is a liar. Yes, he is. He will take your
[1:26:24] breath, stop you in your steps.
[1:26:29] Fear
[1:26:32] is a liar.
[1:26:36] He will rob your rest, steal your
[1:26:40] happiness,
[1:26:42] cast your feast
[1:26:46] in the fire,
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:49] fear,
[1:26:51] he is a liar. Verse two, when he told
[1:26:56] you you were troubled, would he forever
[1:27:00] be alone?
[1:27:02] When he told you you should run away,
[1:27:05] you'll never find a home. When he told
[1:27:09] you you were dirt, I've been there and
[1:27:12] you should be ashamed.
[1:27:15] When he told you you could be the one,
[1:27:19] grace will never change or fear
[1:27:24] is a liar.
[1:27:26] [Music]
[1:27:30] [Applause]
[1:27:44] Hey.
[1:27:49] [Music]
[1:28:08] [Applause]
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:29:00] Down.
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:18] [Applause]
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:32] In the fire
[1:29:35] cause fear,
[1:29:38] he is a liar. Verse three,
[1:29:41] let your fire fall and cast out all my
[1:29:45] fears.
[1:29:48] Let your fire fall. Your love is all I
[1:29:51] fear.
[1:29:54] Let your fire fall and cast out all my
[1:29:58] fear.
[1:30:00] Let your fire fall. Your love is all I
[1:30:04] fear. But fear is a liar. Oh, fear
[1:30:10] is a liar.
[1:30:13] He will take your breath, stop you in
[1:30:17] your steps.
[1:30:20] Fear
[1:30:21] [Music]
[1:30:22] is a liar.
[1:30:26] He will rob your rest,
[1:30:29] your happiness.
[1:30:31] Cast your fear
[1:30:35] in the fire.
[1:30:38] fear.
[1:30:41] He is a liar.
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:46] Can we go to G?
[1:30:48] Oh, greater is he that is in me.
[1:30:53] Greater is he that is in me. Oh, greater
[1:30:58] is he that is in me
[1:31:02] than he that is in the world. Oh, now
[1:31:06] Satan's like, Roaring Light, home to and
[1:31:13] fro,
[1:31:15] seeking whom he made a vow. The Bible
[1:31:20] tells us so.
[1:31:23] And many souls have been his prey. The
[1:31:28] fall has some weak hour.
[1:31:31] But God has promised us to his
[1:31:36] overcoming power. Oh now greater is he
[1:31:41] that is in me.
[1:31:44] Greater is he that is in me. Oh greater
[1:31:49] is he that is in me than he that is. God
[1:31:53] bless you. Now turn around and greet
[1:31:55] someone as you leave. For the day of
[1:31:58] Pentecost,
[1:32:00] a rushing mighty wind.
[1:32:04] It blew into the upper room and baptized
[1:32:10] all of them.
[1:32:12] And with the power gater there, he
[1:32:18] f.
[1:32:20] And I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm
[1:32:24] going to let the whole world know. Oh,
[1:32:28] greater is he that is in me.
[1:32:32] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:32:36] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:32:41] is in the world. Oh, greater is he that
[1:32:46] is in me.
[1:32:48] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:32:52] Greater is he that is in me.
