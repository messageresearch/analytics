[40:30] we're so thankful uh for that let's look
[40:33] here in in uh uh Luke 2 and
[40:37] 1 and it come to pass in those days that
[40:41] there went out a decree from Caesar
[40:44] Augustus that all the world should be
[40:46] taxed and this taxing was first made
[40:49] when serenus was governor of Syria and
[40:53] it went and all went to be taxed and
[40:55] everyone into to his own City and Joseph
[40:58] also went up From
[41:00] Galilee out of the city of Nazareth unto
[41:03] Judea unto the city of David which is
[41:07] called Bethlehem because he was of the
[41:10] house and lineage of David to be taxed
[41:13] with Mary his espoused wife being great
[41:16] with child and so it was that while they
[41:20] were
[41:21] there the days were accomplished that
[41:24] she should be delivered and she brought
[41:27] forth her firstborn and wrapped him in
[41:29] the swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[41:32] Manger because there was no room for
[41:34] them in the
[41:36] end and there were in the same country
[41:39] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[41:42] watch over their flock by night and lo
[41:45] the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and
[41:48] the glory of the Lord Shone round about
[41:51] them and they were sore afraid and the
[41:54] angel said unto them fear not for behold
[41:56] I bring Good Tidings of bring you good
[42:00] tidings of great joy which shall be to
[42:02] all people for unto you is Born This Day
[42:06] in the city of David a savior which is
[42:08] Christ the lord and this shall be a sign
[42:11] unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped
[42:15] in swaddling clothes laying in a
[42:18] manger and
[42:20] suddenly there was with the angel a
[42:23] multitude of the Heavenly Host praising
[42:26] God and saying glory to God in the
[42:28] highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[42:32] toward men and it came to pass as the
[42:34] Angels were going
[42:36] away from them into heaven the Shepherds
[42:39] said one to another let us go even unto
[42:43] Bethlehem and see this thing which has
[42:46] come to pass which the Lord hath made
[42:48] known unto us and they came with haste
[42:52] and found Mary and Joseph and the baby
[42:54] laying in the manger and when they had
[42:56] seen it they uh they made known abroad
[43:00] the saying which was told them
[43:02] concerning this child and all they that
[43:05] heard it wondered at those things which
[43:08] were told by the Shepherds but Mary kept
[43:10] all these things and pondered them in
[43:12] her heart and the Shepherds returned
[43:15] glorifying and praising God for all the
[43:17] things they had heard and seen as it was
[43:20] told unto them let's go to the Lord in
[43:23] prayer father we just want to thank you

[45:22] what is
[45:24] man and
[45:26] I it's it's a different thought maybe I
[45:30] I don't know you know you but I I want
[45:33] to think about amen
[45:38] the the Monumental thing that that took
[45:42] place 2,000 years
[45:45] ago today Christmas has become a
[45:49] celebration and it's
[45:52] become uh a tradition of uh lights and
[45:58] and Santas and Christmas trees and and
[46:02] um there gift swapping and and a lot of
[46:05] these things that man has nothing to do
[46:09] with the birth of Jesus
[46:11] Christ has nothing at all to do with
[46:15] salvation in fact these Christmas trees
[46:19] and lights and gift swapping was taking
[46:24] place hundreds and hundreds of of years
[46:27] before the Christ was ever
[46:29] born amen and it was a pagan the Pagan
[46:35] church that instituted this into
[46:38] Christmas amen it was Pagan worship it's
[46:42] the Pagan it's it's the Pagan uh
[46:46] Catholic Church that brought this in
[46:49] amen the first 300 years after Christ
[46:54] was born after he was crucified and
[46:58] resurrected there was not one
[47:01] celebration of
[47:02] Christmas so I want to make that clear
[47:05] this morning celebration started with
[47:08] the Catholic
[47:09] church now amen is there is there reason
[47:14] to
[47:16] celebrate amen uh yes we celebrate
[47:19] Independence Day we celebrate our
[47:23] nation's
[47:24] birthday we celebrate your birthdays we
[47:30] we celebrate Lincoln's birthday as a
[47:33] nation we celebrate Lee's birthday and
[47:38] and Washington's
[47:40] birthday amen but this is a little
[47:45] different
[47:46] situation this is when God came to Earth
[47:51] to redeem us this is not a cele
[47:56] celebration this is when God took on a
[47:59] body created a body this is when God
[48:05] himself became a man this is
[48:11] worship this is why we worship this is
[48:16] why we come to church this is why were
[48:20] able to pray before you could not even
[48:23] pray amen and have your no sin prayers
[48:26] are he are heard from God outside of the
[48:29] blood of Jesus Christ amen but it was
[48:32] because of the great thoughts of God
[48:36] that we come to church you see we don't
[48:39] come to church and celebrate I'm not one
[48:42] that cares for the song celebrate Jesus
[48:46] celebrate I am not one for those kinds
[48:50] of uh amen uh uh worship songs that that
[48:55] that one wants to Simply uh uh just give
[48:58] us give us something to to to um uh you
[49:03] know bring into the human realm because
[49:07] listen anything that is that is
[49:10] concerning God and concerning salvation
[49:14] it should be of worship it should be of
[49:18] the deepest of
[49:20] sincerity this is the time that God came
[49:25] to Pardon man from their sins and to
[49:29] loose us from the powers of hell can you
[49:34] say Amen aren't you glad that we're not
[49:37] celebrating Christmas we are worshiping
[49:41] the king we are worshiping King lamb
[49:45] here this morning now the Heathen they
[49:48] bring the reving spirit to the church
[49:51] and everything is a party until the
[49:54] church becomes a party until amen uh the
[49:58] church services become a party and
[50:02] everything is a party until Hollywood
[50:05] has replaced the sacred worship I hope
[50:07] I'm doing okay amen I've only been
[50:09] preaching five minutes and some's
[50:11] already getting a little scared of what
[50:13] I'm going to be saying this morning but
[50:15] amen but I I I want to say here this
[50:18] morning I would rather worship than I
[50:22] would to amen uh uh uh uh uh to to to to
[50:28] take on with the Santa Clauses and the
[50:30] and the and the gift swapping and the
[50:33] and and and and the stage shows and the
[50:36] programs and all of this just give me
[50:39] the lovely Lord Jesus give me the love
[50:43] that passes all understanding give me
[50:46] the relationship between me and God Amen
[50:49] that I can love my brother amen and they
[50:52] can love me give me what Christmas is
[50:57] genuinely about let me find that baby in
[51:02] my heart can you say amen amen you see
[51:07] there's a
[51:09] sacredness and a
[51:11] worship that should go with
[51:14] Christmas I believe Christmas should
[51:16] have come with a fresh amen consecration
[51:19] to the Lord of thanking God for the gift
[51:22] of eternal life amen because that's
[51:25] truly what Christmas is all about Amen
[51:28] brother Brandon would say now in in a
[51:30] few weeks amen or even right now there's
[51:33] reindeers and Santa Clauses and jingle
[51:36] bells and all kinds of things hanging up
[51:39] which is Pagan ceremony it's an article
[51:42] of the Catholic church people paying
[51:44] great prices and swapping presents all
[51:47] things like that is Pagan Christmas is a
[51:50] day of worship amen and by the way
[51:53] Christ wasn't born on the 25th of
[51:55] December either he couldn't have been if
[51:58] you've ever been in Judea the hills are
[52:00] full of snow worse than it is here amen
[52:03] born in April when all nature comes
[52:05] forth but it's their tradition and why
[52:08] do we do those things because we follow
[52:11] the traditions of men instead of The
[52:13] Commandments of God something like that
[52:16] wouldn't matter but they just make a uh
[52:19] a a commercial day out of it it's a
[52:21] disgrace it's a shame for them to do
[52:24] such things as that a pagan ceremony
[52:27] when Santa when when did Santa Claus
[52:30] have anything to do with Jesus when did
[52:32] the Easter rabbit or
[52:35] chicken excuse me uh uh colored up with
[52:38] some kind of ink or something or some
[52:41] kind of little white rabbit have
[52:43] anything to do with the resurrection of
[52:45] Jesus Christ don't you see how the
[52:47] commercial world that's the reason they
[52:49] sell these old rock and roll books and
[52:52] dirty pictures and vulgar and things
[52:54] like that that is because the nature of
[52:57] the people crave for such nonsense
[53:01] that's right it's because there's
[53:03] something wrong in the heart they've
[53:05] never entered into the rest with God and
[53:08] ceased from these things when they come
[53:10] into that and receive the Holy Ghost
[53:13] then they're finished with the world and
[53:16] the things of the world can you say amen
[53:18] amen so I say today amen you know uh uh
[53:23] uh let's look at the real Christmas why
[53:26] don't we why why why don't we look here
[53:30] real real sincerely in our heart and say
[53:33] Amen Lord I I what I want more than
[53:36] anything else is my child to have
[53:38] eternal life amen what I want more than
[53:42] anything else is for my babies to know
[53:45] the real reason amen not all this
[53:49] Christmas tree nonsense and all of Amen
[53:52] all of this h h h stuff where we where
[53:55] where we just fit right in line with all
[53:58] amen of the of the norm of of
[54:02] leot Amen Let me take this time to
[54:06] reflect what Christmas is really about
[54:10] amen when God so loved the world that he
[54:15] come and took on a body so that he could
[54:19] pay the price for my sin let me tell
[54:23] them that there's some all is so worth
[54:26] something to God that he came took on a
[54:31] body to understand them and love them
[54:35] and die for them and bring them back to
[54:38] Heaven Hallelujah
[54:42] that's
[54:44] man your Christmas toys are going

[56:05] them can you say
[56:07] amen amen sir we would see Jesus he says

[56:20] June July or whatever it is just so you

[56:40] celebration and you hear people say

[58:02] disciples is trying to describe what it
[58:05] was like when they walk with Jesus and
[58:08] he and and he says that which was from
[58:10] the beginning which we have heard which
[58:12] we have seen with our eyes and we've
[58:14] looked upon and our hands have handled
[58:19] of the very Word of Life for the life

[58:26] bear witness and we show unto you that
[58:29] eternal life which was with the father
[58:33] and was
[58:34] manifested unto
[58:36] us there there the great Eternal
[58:41] Creator he he come and he lived in a
[58:46] body and we handled this great Eternal
[58:52] Word we had in the beginning was the the

[59:25] he was more than just a teacher but he
[59:27] come to my mother-in-law who was dying
[59:30] and God healed him they could turn
[59:33] around and say Amen we were on that boat

[59:40] boat up and going he tried so hard and
[59:43] when he worked and worked and worked and
[59:44] worked and couldn't and finally when all
[59:47] hope was gone we went down to the battle
[59:49] of the ship and we said Jesus do do you
[59:51] care that L we perish and we walk
[59:54] watched him stand up and wipe the sleeve
[59:57] from his eyes and put his put his foot
[1:00:00] on the brow on the bow of the boat and

[1:10:26] I'm giving you the authority I'm giving
[1:10:28] you the Dominion I'm giving you what it
[1:10:31] takes and the reason that God does
[1:10:34] nothing that's the reason that God does
[1:10:37] nothing outside of a man he always works
[1:10:40] through a
[1:10:41] man because he has to use a man he had
[1:10:45] to use a man a man is what he had to use
[1:10:49] to display his attribute of
[1:10:52] Savior he had to make him in his image
[1:10:56] make him something like him and put him
[1:10:59] on free moral agency and let him act in
[1:11:02] way that he wanted
[1:11:04] to he could take his choice he knew that
[1:11:07] man by giving him that choice would
[1:11:10] fall and so being that he had to do that
[1:11:14] he turns back around and makes the man a
[1:11:18] partner to him and does nothing except
[1:11:21] he does
[1:11:22] it through a
[1:11:29] man are are are y'all just catching that

[1:20:34] man it's just like man to
[1:20:37] turn the
[1:20:41] good into
[1:20:44] evil it's just like man to search for
[1:20:48] his own
[1:20:51] way because his heart is
[1:20:53] evil he's
[1:20:56] unregenerated I'm trying to tell to you
[1:20:58] children about
[1:21:02] Christmas
[1:21:03] evil man
[1:21:06] take the goodness of God and trample it
[1:21:10] under the
[1:21:13] foot they made
[1:21:16] Idols they worshiped
[1:21:19] cows they made Idols of brass
[1:21:23] Stone and Wood
[1:21:28] Silver and even when Jesus came in the
[1:21:31] body in the in the person of Jesus
[1:21:36] Christ he even looked over
[1:21:39] Jerusalem and he says oh if you would
[1:21:41] have only known your
[1:21:42] day I'm the god that created
[1:21:47] you I'm the god that talked to
[1:21:50] Abraham remember
[1:21:53] when Isaiah said come let us
[1:21:57] reason I've created a path I'm here I
[1:22:02] want to fellowship with you he's
[1:22:05] weeping I'm the pillar of fire I'm the
[1:22:09] one that led you out of Egypt and
[1:22:11] brought you to this land he's weeping
[1:22:14] he's agonizing over over Jerusalem he's
[1:22:17] looking and he's saiding oh oh if you
[1:22:20] would have known the day of your
[1:22:22] visitation
[1:22:23] the
[1:22:24] hour your hour is here and you don't
[1:22:29] know it can you say
[1:22:32] man but you see it had to be that
[1:22:36] way because Jesus was born to
[1:22:43] die I look and
[1:22:46] I think of what
[1:22:48] Redemption
[1:22:50] means and and even
[1:22:53] there in First Peter 1 and8 it says in
[1:22:56] whom having not seen you
[1:22:59] love in whom though ye see him not yet
[1:23:03] believing you rejoice with joy
[1:23:05] unspeakable and full of
[1:23:07] Glory receiving the end of your faith
[1:23:10] even the salvation of your
[1:23:12] souls of which salvation the prophets
[1:23:14] have inquired and search diligently who
[1:23:17] prophesied of the grace that should come
[1:23:19] unto
[1:23:20] you searching what or what matter of
[1:23:23] time the spirit of Christ which was in
[1:23:26] them did
[1:23:28] signify when it test testified
[1:23:30] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[1:23:32] the glory that should follow unto whom
[1:23:35] it was revealed that not unto themselves
[1:23:37] but unto they unto us they did Minister
[1:23:40] these things which are now reported unto
[1:23:42] you by them that have preached the
[1:23:45] gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost uh
[1:23:48] uh Holy Ghost sent down from heaven
[1:23:51] which things the angels deern start to
[1:23:52] look
[1:23:55] into you see the
[1:23:59] Salvation they knew it was coming now
[1:24:01] they all knew it was coming they've been
[1:24:03] prophesying and they was
[1:24:04] thinking
[1:24:06] what who who would this come to when
[1:24:11] will this
[1:24:14] happen and what were they looking for
[1:24:16] they were looking for that man they were
[1:24:20] looking for the time that God would
[1:24:21] become
[1:24:23] a
[1:24:23] human they were looking for scriptures
[1:24:26] like first 1 Timothy 2 and5 there is one
[1:24:31] God and there's one mediator between God
[1:24:35] and
[1:24:36] man the
[1:24:38] man Christ Jesus who gave himself a
[1:24:42] ramom for
[1:24:44] all they were they were looking for that
[1:24:46] one for that one according to 2
[1:24:48] Corinthians 5:19 to what God was in in
[1:24:53] the
[1:24:54] man
[1:24:56] reconciling the
[1:24:58] world unto
[1:25:02] themselves they were looking for that
[1:25:04] time now stay with me a little longer
[1:25:06] I'm not going to hold you too
[1:25:08] long the angels are by bystanders
[1:25:12] they're looking the prophets have been
[1:25:14] looking the angels are wondering what
[1:25:18] what kind of
[1:25:20] people would this be
[1:25:23] this one that is made lower than the
[1:25:26] Angels the angels are ministering
[1:25:29] Spirits they stand around the throne and
[1:25:31] worship day and night saying holy holy
[1:25:34] holy they do God's bidding they carry
[1:25:37] messages of judgment and of
[1:25:41] Victory and though God loves those
[1:25:46] angels and though those angels never
[1:25:51] sinned
[1:25:55] those angels
[1:25:56] stood those angels stood when man
[1:26:01] didn't oh yeah they had a
[1:26:05] choice Lucifer already drag out a third
[1:26:09] of the
[1:26:10] Angels they
[1:26:16] stood and though God loved those
[1:26:21] angels the heart throb of God was man
[1:26:24] there you go amen though God loved his
[1:26:28] angels there you
[1:26:31] go oh God as I'm thinking here today I
[1:26:36] I'm telling you it's it's quite an
[1:26:38] incredible
[1:26:39] thing Hebrews 1 and5 would say For unto
[1:26:43] which of the Angels said he at any
[1:26:46] time Thou Art my
[1:26:49] son this day have I begotten thee and
[1:26:53] then again I will be to him a
[1:26:58] father and he will be myself
[1:27:04] son and then
[1:27:06] again he's he's quoting back when he
[1:27:09] bringeth the first begotten into the
[1:27:11] world he
[1:27:12] saith let all the angels of
[1:27:16] God worship
[1:27:21] Him
[1:27:23] this
[1:27:25] man this man was
[1:27:28] such was such the love of God was such
[1:27:33] an expression of God that God would even
[1:27:36] tell the
[1:27:44] Angels worship
[1:27:47] him God would so love this
[1:27:54] Christ
[1:27:57] child that now the world would worship
[1:28:01] God when they worshiped Jesus Christ
[1:28:05] amen can you say Amen Hebrews
[1:28:09] 1:3 but to which of the Angels he's
[1:28:12] asking the question again but to which
[1:28:14] of the Angels said he had any
[1:28:17] time sit on my right hand until I make
[1:28:21] thine enemies thy foot
[1:28:22] stool he says are they not all
[1:28:25] ministering Spirits sent
[1:28:27] forth to minister for
[1:28:31] them who shall be
[1:28:34] hes now he's talking to you and me so
[1:28:37] now he's he's talking about the angels
[1:28:39] that he was made lower than the angels
[1:28:41] and yet God exalted him and given him a
[1:28:43] name above all names and said if you
[1:28:45] want to worship me worship the
[1:28:47] lamb but then he turns around and says
[1:28:50] are they not all ministering Spirit sent
[1:28:52] forth to for them who shall be
[1:28:57] HS of
[1:28:58] Salvation when God exalts
[1:29:02] him God exalted
[1:29:08] you do you understand why God had to
[1:29:10] come in a
[1:29:11] body God done this God was so pleased to
[1:29:15] come among us because he wanted you you
[1:29:18] see only a human being could restore
[1:29:21] back the human prise yes sir only a
[1:29:25] human only a human being could restore
[1:29:27] genuine
[1:29:30] worship we were all under the curse and
[1:29:33] the penalty of
[1:29:37] sin oh but God
[1:29:39] said I'm going to give you a sign yes
[1:29:43] this is going to be a sign of my
[1:29:45] love even the angels have desired to
[1:29:47] look on this the prophets have desired
[1:29:50] to see this
[1:29:52] this will be the sign of signs it will
[1:29:54] be the most incredible of all no Genius
[1:29:58] of man will ever be able to compare to
[1:30:00] it no Genius of man will ever be able to
[1:30:03] take from it amen even in today when the
[1:30:07] genius of
[1:30:09] Satan and the genius of the Heathen
[1:30:13] church has tried to
[1:30:16] replace this man with all of
[1:30:20] its Pagan worship yeah that it pull out
[1:30:25] of the ancient Pagan
[1:30:29] books hundreds of years of the
[1:30:34] past it'll never compare to it the labs
[1:30:37] of science will never be able to produce
[1:30:40] the
[1:30:41] cold the inventors of all times will
[1:30:44] never be able to create a product like
[1:30:46] the Virgin birth the Virgin birth gave
[1:30:49] us the product the Virgin birth brother
[1:30:51] John went God took and placed his seed
[1:30:56] into the womb of of of of uh uh not not
[1:31:01] Eve Amen in the womb of Mary and right
[1:31:04] then hallelujah that was a promise yeah
[1:31:08] that was a promise that was a promise
[1:31:11] that's how that's reason I can stand up
[1:31:13] here and preach for 30 something years
[1:31:15] saying that Jesus is coming and Jesus
[1:31:18] word is true is because God proved it in
[1:31:20] a little baby
[1:31:22] boy God done it God done it to save you
[1:31:26] Luke God done it to save you Aaron and
[1:31:29] simy and kyin God came on Earth to pay
[1:31:34] the price to save all of
[1:31:39] God's
[1:31:43] Sons he will be a
[1:31:45] sign can you say amen amen it'll be a
[1:31:50] sign of Deliverance it'll be a sign of
[1:31:52] peace this baby will be a sign of
[1:31:55] Victory because when this virgin
[1:31:57] conceives God will once
[1:32:00] again dwell in a
[1:32:04] body he will live among
[1:32:08] man what does this
[1:32:10] do as I am
[1:32:15] descending what does this
[1:32:20] do
[1:32:23] come
[1:32:26] on it doesn't create
[1:32:33] celebration it creates worship
[1:32:40] yes have you ever thought about
[1:32:43] Ephesians 4 and
[1:32:46] 6 it just sort of sums it up Sister Keys
[1:32:49] If You' put that up
[1:32:50] there
[1:32:53] one God and Father of
[1:32:58] all who was above
[1:33:01] all and through
[1:33:06] all and in you
[1:33:15] all is the
[1:33:17] father he was above
[1:33:20] us you you can see him all through the
[1:33:24] nature you can see him through the plant
[1:33:26] life you can see him through the sun
[1:33:28] rising and setting you can see God you
[1:33:30] can see God in so many
[1:33:35] areas but he's not just the father above
[1:33:38] all and through
[1:33:40] all he's
[1:33:42] now in the
[1:33:47] church His blessings are upon the church
[1:33:53] I think the
[1:33:56] sincerity Even in our little church
[1:33:59] here they see the children smirk and
[1:34:03] while a man of God's trying to
[1:34:05] preach come with attitudes or I don't
[1:34:08] know what what's what's going on but
[1:34:10] they in serious service and they're
[1:34:12] smirking and looking at each other and
[1:34:14] doing these kinds of things where's the
[1:34:18] respect where's the
[1:34:20] respect
[1:34:25] what does Christmas
[1:34:27] mean what does salvation
[1:34:30] mean

[1:34:37] game is not this

[1:40:07] the Holy Spirit yes Jesus has shed his
[1:40:12] blood the water has been washed in the
[1:40:14] days of Noah yes and then the Earth is

[1:40:42] lived in man suffered with man to redeem
[1:40:46] man now watch this this is for us today
[1:40:49] this is right now this is before we we
[1:40:51] even get on the other side the holy
[1:40:53] spirit's doing it within us right now
[1:40:55] that's the reason our soul can be
[1:40:56] changed that's why God comes and lives
[1:40:58] within us justification it's the blood
[1:41:01] the water and the spirit amen when a
[1:41:04] birth comes it's got to have blood water
[1:41:08] spirit when Christ comes in us that has
[1:41:10] to be justified Sanctified and then
[1:41:12] baptized he goes now he comes down and
[1:41:14] lives suffered with man to redeem man
[1:41:17] and the Holy Spirit comes into man and
[1:41:20] drives that that Blackness and sin away
[1:41:22] from him and brings it back into perfect
[1:41:25] Fellowship a part of God and now we by
[1:41:28] the blood of Christ who cleanses us from
[1:41:31] sins become Sons and Daughters of God
[1:41:34] who is God the one that stood there and
[1:41:37] rode the Stars off his hands and rode
[1:41:39] the worlds out of his hands and made the
[1:41:41] things which do not appear deity deity
[1:41:44] himself lives in man the Creator that
[1:41:47] made heavens and earth is now living in
[1:41:56] inen brother brandom says you'll never
[1:41:58] be able to have too much fellowship with
[1:42:01] God God Longs for his
[1:42:05] creature who he created in His image to
[1:42:08] fellowship with him wouldn't you love to
[1:42:11] have lived in that time of the Great
[1:42:13] Fellowship God had with Adam and Eve in
[1:42:15] the Garden of Eden to come down in the
[1:42:16] cool of the evening talk with them and
[1:42:18] fellowship with them would that be
[1:42:22] marvelous we all would like to have that
[1:42:24] in
[1:42:25] time now I Believe by God's word I can
[1:42:27] prove to you that we can come right back
[1:42:30] on them terms again with God tonight
[1:42:34] right straight back to that kind of
[1:42:40] Fellowship now as I
[1:42:44] close he's
[1:42:46] restored
[1:42:49] Fellowship you you can walk with God in
[1:42:52] the cool of the evening Adam
[1:42:55] communicated with God before he had a
[1:42:59] body and then God put that body in the
[1:43:02] spirit or or put that spirit in the
[1:43:06] body and then the body went wherever the
[1:43:10] spirit
[1:43:11] went it was the spirit man that was
[1:43:15] fellowshipping with Spirit
[1:43:17] God so brother Brandon would say if he
[1:43:19] would put it last a week understand it
[1:43:21] he would say so God's the great Pillar
[1:43:23] of Fire And The Souls of man is like a
[1:43:27] the little Cloud he said so the little
[1:43:30] cloud and the pillar of fire would come
[1:43:33] together and
[1:43:36] fellowship and the body just tagged
[1:43:39] along because the
[1:43:41] body is what the spirit lives in that's
[1:43:45] the soul that God's redeemed so we can
[1:43:48] fellowship with God since the price has
[1:43:50] been
[1:43:52] paid we can kneel down in prayer we can
[1:43:55] sit and
[1:43:56] pray it don't matter whether you have
[1:43:58] your eyes open when you're praying or
[1:43:59] whether you have your hands crossed when
[1:44:01] praying whether you're laying in your
[1:44:03] bed praying or what what it is is not
[1:44:06] saying words it's
[1:44:11] Fellowship you can be on your knees for
[1:44:13] a whole hour and not
[1:44:15] Fellowship you can have your hands
[1:44:17] crossed and kneel down and not
[1:44:19] Fellowship okay but God has provided a
[1:44:24] way to bring this body scooted out of
[1:44:27] the way and all of the sins held against
[1:44:29] us all of the sins held against us all
[1:44:32] of the sins held against us so that we
[1:44:36] can fellowship with
[1:44:40] Papa once

[1:53:43] saor
[1:53:44] know
[1:53:47] God's name
[1:53:54] [Music]
[1:53:59] I
[1:54:01] think as brother Brenham would say
[1:54:06] tonight we want to find and prove in the
[1:54:10] scripture where the correct place where
[1:54:13] God meets and worships with the
[1:54:16] [Music]
[1:54:18] people and of course he told us that was
[1:54:22] in Jesus
[1:54:25] Christ he was the go
[1:54:28] between he was the
[1:54:31] body another place it says I do believe
[1:54:33] in purgatory but I believe it's right
[1:54:36] now your soul you purge your own
[1:54:39] soul Purgatory means to purge when you
[1:54:42] see that you've done
[1:54:44] wrong get out there and clean it out of
[1:54:47] You by confession and crying and fasting
[1:54:51] and
[1:54:52] praying someone's even laughed at me
[1:54:54] when the Lord came here not long ago and
[1:54:56] gave me a vision I always wanted to see
[1:54:59] about The Binding that serpent I
[1:55:00] wondered how
[1:55:02] to I should step out like that and
[1:55:05] that's what I've wanted all my life then
[1:55:08] I began to fast and pray they said what
[1:55:11] do you do that for I said in there he
[1:55:14] said I was not sincere enough and after
[1:55:18] he' come that I wanted to purge
[1:55:21] myself not wait till you
[1:55:24] die not let and let some priest try to
[1:55:27] purge
[1:55:28] you purge your
[1:55:31] [Music]
[1:55:32] souls so no other no greater time than
[1:55:36] Christmas to make that real true
[1:55:39] dedication to the
[1:55:41] Lord and say God has provided a
[1:55:47] place Santa Claus
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:56] H
[1:55:58] [Music]
[1:56:01] nonsense but he's provided a
[1:56:07] place to where we can Purge our souls
[1:56:09] and say Lord here I
[1:56:11] am take all the junk out of
[1:56:16] me take all the junk out of me
[1:56:22] they don't care whether you're just a
[1:56:24] little
[1:56:26] child or
[1:56:29] whether maybe the oldest in here today
[1:56:32] would be brother
[1:56:37] Torrance we still have that meeting
[1:56:40] place in Jesus
[1:56:45] Christ if you're not walking with God
[1:56:47] the way you should and you've just
[1:56:48] allowed come on folks don't don't don't
[1:56:51] be Arrogant with
[1:56:52] God don't don't be playing the games if
[1:56:56] you're wrong you got a bad attitude get
[1:56:59] it
[1:57:00] right if you're sinning get it right if

[1:57:25] won't repent they just ain't they ain't
[1:57:27] in

[1:57:36] have more mistakes than the Serpent's
[1:57:41] children he said Jacob was lot worse off
[1:57:44] than Esau that's
[1:57:48] right but Jacob had it
