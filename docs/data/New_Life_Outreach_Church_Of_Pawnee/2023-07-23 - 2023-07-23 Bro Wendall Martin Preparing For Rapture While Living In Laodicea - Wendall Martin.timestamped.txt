[39:38] Lord a hard life and because of it Lord
[39:41] he's he's paying the consequences Lord
[39:46] but oh God
[39:48] you can so touch that soul and touch
[39:50] that body Lord
[39:52] as he's only in his 30s father and
[39:56] I pray that you would
[39:58] Lord just speak the words of life and
[40:02] bring him out Lord and make him a
[40:05] testimony for your grace
[40:07] I pray Lord that you would be with
[40:09] everyone that is that that is again
[40:12] struggling with sickness and just be
[40:15] with them this morning
[40:16] we love you Lord
[40:18] as we stand here this morning Lord I
[40:21] take this this time very seriously and I
[40:27] pray Lord that you would you would just
[40:30] speak only I would speak only as you
[40:32] would speak Lord
[40:34] I pray that you would help us to hear
[40:35] what you have to say
[40:37] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:40] can the Church Say Amen
[40:42] and amen God bless you you may be seated
[40:46] here this morning
[40:49] praise the Lord
[40:51] amen
[40:54] we are thankful for God's love to us and
[40:59] for a thought here this morning I want
[41:01] to speak on
[41:03] amen a subject of uh preparing for
[41:07] Rapture while living in laodicea
[41:11] and um as we look here in the world
[41:17] systems the kingdoms of this world we we
[41:20] see the maturity of the two spirits
[41:23] amen here on this earth right in the
[41:27] face of this rapture
[41:29] amen there's the spirit of lawlessness
[41:32] and then there is the spirit of
[41:33] preeminence
[41:35] of Christ
[41:36] lawlessness is the state of disorder due
[41:39] to disrespect for the law
[41:43] and we can see uh exactly that that this
[41:47] is where we are at
[41:49] of course brother
[41:51] Branham gave us the at predicted 65
[41:55] years ago
[41:57] uh they're in uh it's if I can if I can
[42:03] find it I thought that I'd brought it in
[42:04] here just in case I I wanted to share it
[42:08] with you
[42:09] amen and uh but he but he talks of the
[42:13] um but he talks now that we are the the
[42:16] world is heading for a state of total
[42:20] lawlessness amen and how that there
[42:24] would come a time to where the spirit
[42:27] would be so prevailing that the spirit
[42:30] of iniquity Iman the scripture says that
[42:34] it is the mystery of iniquity and that
[42:38] this Myst this mysterious Spirit of
[42:41] iniquity in this day would unfold and we
[42:45] would we would truly see the Expressions
[42:50] that was behind that spirit and that is
[42:53] lawlessness
[42:55] preeminances is the superiority or the
[42:58] supremacy the predominancy of Christ
[43:02] amen it it is the authority of God's
[43:06] word and so when you are when the word
[43:10] is having a preeminence in you then that
[43:14] word is in fact uh having Authority and
[43:18] you are coming under the authority of
[43:22] God's word
[43:23] so we're living in a time to where amen
[43:27] again lawlessness the spirit that is a
[43:32] man that has brought us into a state of
[43:34] disorder disarray amen uh due to the
[43:39] respect of the word and we have at the
[43:43] same time the preeminances of Christ to
[43:47] bring us into a Rapture now this is
[43:49] quite a paradox because both Spirits are
[43:52] here at the same time both Spirits are
[43:55] here right here we are we are seeing it
[43:58] here in in the world now you say how can
[44:02] there be a Rapture in this environment
[44:03] brother Wendell amen I as we as we all
[44:07] know the scripture but I just want to go
[44:09] through some of these uh scriptures for
[44:11] just a moment as we look here in the at
[44:15] the Prophecies of scripture concerning
[44:18] this day they're in second Thessalonians
[44:20] 2 and 3 it says let no man deceive you
[44:22] by any means things for that day the
[44:25] Rapture shall not come
[44:29] except there come a falling away and the
[44:33] man of sin be revealed the Son of
[44:36] Perdition who opposes and exalts himself
[44:41] above all that is called God or that is
[44:44] worshiped so that he as God sets in the
[44:47] temple of God showing himself that he is
[44:50] God remember you not that when I was
[44:53] with you I told you these things now you
[44:56] know what withholdeth that he might be
[44:58] revealed in his time for the mystery of
[45:01] iniquity does already work now he is
[45:06] saying that the mystery of iniquities
[45:07] already there in the first age
[45:10] but he is saying that it's going to
[45:12] become so bold it's going to become so
[45:15] out in your face that you're going to
[45:18] see the effects of that spirit that is
[45:23] mysteriously been working down through
[45:26] the Church of all the ages
[45:28] man it's that that is already there and
[45:31] he says only he who now lets will let
[45:35] until he be taken out of the way then
[45:38] shall the wicked be revealed whom the
[45:40] Lord shall consume with the spirit of
[45:41] his mouth and he shall destroy with the
[45:43] brightness of his coming even him whose
[45:46] coming is after the working of Satan
[45:47] with all power and signs and lying
[45:50] wonders with all deceivableness of
[45:52] unrighteousness in them that perish
[45:55] deceivableness of unrighteousness
[45:58] because they receive not the love of the
[46:02] truth that they might be saved and for
[46:05] this cause God shall send him strong
[46:08] delusion that they should believe a lie
[46:11] that they all might be damned who
[46:14] believed not the truth but had pleasure
[46:16] and unrighteousness so here is the
[46:18] deceivableness of unrighteousness amen
[46:21] and the be and and because they received
[46:24] not the love of the truth because the
[46:27] the word did come and they rejected that
[46:31] word amen for this calls God himself
[46:34] shall send strong delusions and they
[46:37] shall believe a lie and be damned can
[46:40] you say Amen now this is supposed to be
[46:42] right before the coming of the Lord let
[46:45] no man deceive you again the first verse
[46:47] that I I read to you for that day shall
[46:50] not come except there come a falling
[46:52] away first amen and so then we look here
[46:55] in in second Peter 2 and 1. it says but
[46:58] there were false prophets among the also
[47:01] among the people even as there shall be
[47:04] false prophet or teachers among you who
[47:07] privately or privilege shall bring
[47:09] indemnable heresies and denying the Lord
[47:12] that bought them and bring upon
[47:14] themselves with destruction and many
[47:17] shall follow their pernicious Ways by
[47:20] the reason of whom the way of truth
[47:22] shall be evil spoken of Amen going on
[47:25] down to the 12th verse for the sake of
[47:27] time but these As Natural brute beasts
[47:31] made to be taken and destroyed
[47:34] speak evil of things that they
[47:37] understand not and shall utterly
[47:39] depperish in their own corruption and
[47:43] shall receive the reward of
[47:44] unrighteousness as they can it pleasure
[47:47] to Riot in the daytime have we not seen
[47:50] some rioting going on in the daytime of
[47:53] Our Generation spots they are blemishes
[47:56] sporting themselves with their own
[47:59] deceivings while feasting with you so so
[48:04] now we find that this spirit is not
[48:07] necessarily going to be on the outside
[48:09] of the church but now we're finding that
[48:13] it's on the inside of the church the
[48:16] church is condoning such Behavior
[48:19] well praise the Lord amen the church has
[48:22] been condoning such behavior of
[48:24] lawlessness when it rejected the word
[48:28] back in 325
[48:30] at DC can you say amen amen it it's it's
[48:35] been the spirit of iniquity that has
[48:38] been working through the church to
[48:41] disallow the headship of the word down
[48:45] through the Seven Ages it's only coming
[48:48] into its fullness or its manifestation
[48:51] in this hour that we're living in this
[48:55] is the Harvest Time what was done in
[48:59] seed form is now coming in reality right
[49:03] here in our land
[49:05] can you say Amen so what we are seeing
[49:07] here it says now sporting themselves in
[49:10] other words they're coming in and and
[49:12] and they're proud to be associated with
[49:15] the Christian church yet they believe
[49:18] not the word he says having eyes full of
[49:21] adultery cannot cease from sin beguiling
[49:25] unstable Souls a heart they have
[49:28] exercised with Covetous practices curse
[49:31] children so this is going to become the
[49:34] norm of the church it is a lawless
[49:37] Church it is a people without any
[49:42] authority of the word therefore they
[49:45] cannot cease from sin amen second
[49:47] Timothy the third chapter the first
[49:49] verse know this also that in the last
[49:52] days perilous times shall come men shall
[49:55] be lovers of their own selves Covetous
[49:58] monsters proud blasphemers disobedient
[50:02] to parents unthankful Unholy without
[50:06] natural affection truce Breakers false
[50:09] accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of
[50:12] those that are good traitors headache
[50:15] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[50:19] lovers of God and here it goes he's
[50:21] linking it right back to the church
[50:22] having a form of godliness and denying
[50:28] the power thereof where is the power he
[50:32] says the gospel is the power of God unto
[50:37] salvation so when you lose the
[50:40] preeminence of the word then you are
[50:43] Lawless
[50:46] and God is choosing to Rapture you in a
[50:51] lawless generation
[50:53] ah Hallelujah can you say Amen having a
[50:58] form but denying the power from such
[51:00] turn away six verse four of this short
[51:02] are they which creep into houses and
[51:05] Lead silly captive silly women leading
[51:07] with sin slid away with diverse lusts
[51:10] ever learning never able to come to the
[51:13] knowledge of the truth now as Janice and
[51:15] Chambers withstood Prophet or Moses so
[51:19] do these also resist the truth men of
[51:22] corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the
[51:25] faith they shall proceed no further for
[51:28] their Folly shall be made manifest unto
[51:31] what oh man so it's now coming to light
[51:38] manifesting in this Harvest Time amen
[51:42] now Revelations 18 describes total
[51:45] lawlessness it describes a world that
[51:48] would come to a climax of sin and and
[51:51] perversion that the spirit of
[51:54] lawlessness and moral decay under the
[51:58] scientific religion amen and it would
[52:01] lead to a cage of every hateful and
[52:04] unclean bird as we look there at Rome
[52:06] Revelations 18 and 1 after these things
[52:09] I saw another Angel come from Heaven
[52:11] having great power and the Earth was
[52:14] lightened with his glory and he cried
[52:17] mightily with a strong voice saying
[52:19] Babylon the great is Fallen now who is
[52:22] this Babylon the great Revelation 17 and
[52:25] 5 says it was mystery Babylon the great
[52:29] the mother the great and the
[52:31] mother of harlots it's the church amen
[52:36] now it's not the bride the church church
[52:38] is going into total apostasy but the
[52:42] bride is going to be coming under the
[52:46] preeminence of Christ and his word
[52:51] and he will take her home well glory to
[52:54] God Amen he says Babylon the greatest
[52:58] Fallen has fallen and has become the
[53:00] habitation of devils the whole of every
[53:03] foul Spirit a cage of every unclean and
[53:06] hateful bird for all the nations have
[53:08] drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
[53:10] fornication and the kings of the Earth
[53:13] have committed fornication with her the
[53:15] merchants of the Earth are wax Rich
[53:17] through the abundance of her Delicacies
[53:19] I heard another voice from Heaven saying
[53:22] come out of her my people be not
[53:27] partakers of her sins that ye receive
[53:30] not her plagues for her sins have
[53:33] reached unto heaven and God hath
[53:35] remembered her the iniquities can you
[53:38] say Amen so this church has has taken on
[53:42] that Spirit The Mystery of iniquity has
[53:45] worked in mystery Babylon for 2 000
[53:50] years it has it has come but now amen
[53:54] there is a revealing of what is taking
[53:58] place and God is saying I want you to
[54:02] come out of that system I want you
[54:06] Hallelujah I'm fixing to burn the
[54:09] I'm fixing to burn the harlots I'm
[54:12] fixing to burn the Earth and I'm going
[54:15] to take you home with me
[54:19] hallelujah what praise the Lord
[54:22] now now this is exactly what is here we
[54:26] are this revelation of Revelation 18
[54:29] correlates exactly with Revelations 3 in
[54:33] the last age of laodicea
[54:36] thou sayest Thou Art Rich thou sayest
[54:41] that thou have need of nothing but I say
[54:45] you're naked blind miserable and
[54:48] deceived can you say Amen now this is
[54:50] not Daniel's day this is not Moses day
[54:53] this is not Abraham's day this is not
[54:56] Luther's day this is not Wesley's day
[54:58] this is the seventh Church age
[55:02] the rapturing age
[55:05] hallelujah what can you say man
[55:08] in this age the church
[55:11] would be declaring that they are just
[55:14] fine
[55:15] the church it would be thou sayest they
[55:19] are saying well praise the name of the
[55:21] Lord thou says see they were speaking
[55:25] they were saying amen they were talking
[55:28] as the mouthpiece of God but though they
[55:32] say it does not make it right
[55:35] though they say it amen that we are rich
[55:38] and that we're increased though the
[55:40] Catholic Church says it though the
[55:43] Protestant Church says it amen and she
[55:46] says that she speaks for God Amen that
[55:48] she is the assured voice of the Lord she
[55:51] says I'm rich I'm increased I have need
[55:53] of nothing amen that is her
[55:55] self-estimate
[55:57] why because she is Lawless
[56:01] she is not taking the words of the
[56:05] husband supposed husband
[56:08] she is taking her own estimation of what
[56:12] she is
[56:13] well praise the Lord
[56:15] amen he says you need my word she says
[56:18] I'm fine with helpful work he says you
[56:20] can only be clothed by my word she says
[56:23] amen that I am clothed I have everything
[56:27] I have need of nothing
[56:31] are you following my drift
[56:33] now the sentence has been passed the
[56:37] verdict is given she is no longer the
[56:40] mouthpiece of God though she maintains
[56:43] that she is God says I wish you were
[56:47] either hot
[56:48] or code
[56:50] I wish you were either for my word or
[56:54] against my word
[56:55] but to say that you have my name
[56:58] and do nothing with it
[57:01] I will spew you you make me sick we'll
[57:04] praise the Lord
[57:06] amen now I want you to think about that
[57:10] because she says it amen now yet in this
[57:14] layout of see a lukewarm age
[57:18] self-efficient age is when God's going
[57:21] to take give us a Rapture amen where
[57:24] mediocrity is the norm we're reading and
[57:27] quoting is a common
[57:29] occurrence and with no life behind it
[57:32] where amen where where there's where
[57:34] there's nothing there no life no no no
[57:38] Vigor no desire no no push
[57:42] for the word of God
[57:46] it's an age where the people
[57:48] are more interested in houses and land
[57:51] it's an age where the people are so
[57:53] caught up into debt that there's no time
[57:56] for prayer there's no time for reading
[57:59] there's no time for training our
[58:01] children in the ways that the prophet
[58:03] gave us and the word of God gave us
[58:06] there's no time for these things because
[58:08] it's a lukewarm age it's an age where
[58:10] everyone really thinks that they've got
[58:12] it all put together and they don't
[58:14] really need the preeminence of the word
[58:17] amen are you hearing me let me just put
[58:20] it very plainly to you this morning amen
[58:23] overcoming quiet power requires a
[58:27] disciplined life
[58:29] overcoming power requires a discipline
[58:32] in life you see you structure your life
[58:35] around what you deem is important
[58:41] the Lord
[58:42] man if if sports are important then you
[58:46] structure your whole family around
[58:47] Sports amen you you did your discipline
[58:51] amen your structure it's a discipline of
[58:54] thought it's a it's a discipline of
[58:56] action you are you are focused in on
[58:59] that one well praise the Lord many
[59:02] people have many different uh desires
[59:05] they have many different things that
[59:06] they're looking to amen but you you look
[59:09] there at a champion boxer a champion
[59:12] boxer is it has got a disciplined
[59:16] routine he's got a structure about him
[59:19] because he knows in order to be a
[59:23] champion he's got to do what it takes to
[59:27] win
[59:29] man now why are we coming to church and
[59:32] why do we read and why do we pray and
[59:33] why do we do these things is because
[59:35] we've got one desire and we're
[59:38] structuring our life around that desire
[59:42] we are disciplined to this rapture
[59:49] Hallelujah
[59:50] man now champion boxer he he he's a
[59:54] strict diet
[59:55] he trains with strict training amen he
[59:59] denies himself anything contrary to the
[1:00:02] root that is required to take him to the
[1:00:05] championship
[1:00:08] well praise the Lord
[1:00:10] I wonder what's really important in this
[1:00:11] day that we're living in
[1:00:13] I wonder what's any more important is it
[1:00:16] really the building up of business is it
[1:00:18] really the things that we put together
[1:00:20] as as important or is there one thing
[1:00:23] that's really important and that is
[1:00:26] winning the prize
[1:00:29] winning this Rapture what can you say
[1:00:32] amen amen the Apostle Paul there in
[1:00:36] Philippians 3 and 8. I'm going to read
[1:00:37] it from the Amplified version he says
[1:00:39] but more than that I count everything as
[1:00:43] loss compared to the Priceless privilege
[1:00:45] and the Supreme advantage of knowing
[1:00:48] Christ
[1:00:49] Jesus my Lord and of growing more deeply
[1:00:52] and thoroughly acquainted with him a joy
[1:00:55] unequal for his sake I have lost
[1:00:58] everything and I consider it all but
[1:01:01] garbage so that I may gain Christ
[1:01:05] going down to the 12th verse said he
[1:01:07] says not that I had already attained it
[1:01:10] this goal of being christ-like or have
[1:01:14] already been made perfect but I actively
[1:01:17] press on so that I may take hold of that
[1:01:21] Perfection for which Christ has took
[1:01:23] hold of me and made me his own
[1:01:27] are are y'all catching me here today
[1:01:29] amen I actively press to lay hold on
[1:01:33] that Perfection it's his brothers and
[1:01:35] sisters I do not consider that I have
[1:01:37] made it my own yet but one thing I do
[1:01:42] forgetting what lies behind and Reaching
[1:01:46] Forward to what lies ahead I press on
[1:01:51] toward the goal
[1:01:53] now now now there's a reason why it's a
[1:01:56] press there's a reason for the structure
[1:01:58] there is a reason for the training is
[1:02:00] because you're living in a world where
[1:02:03] there's not champions
[1:02:07] and there's only going to be one of us
[1:02:09] there's only going to be the bride that
[1:02:11] is going to come out the champion in
[1:02:13] this life what can you say amen amen the
[1:02:16] Rapture is not for everyone the prize is
[1:02:19] not for everyone you are living in an
[1:02:21] age of lawlessness
[1:02:25] it's the spirit that you are having to
[1:02:28] resist well praise the Lord
[1:02:31] amen now I think if we're going to win
[1:02:34] this prize amen then we've got to
[1:02:37] remember what the prize is what is the
[1:02:40] price the price is us getting back to
[1:02:44] where Adam was before he fell
[1:02:48] it was lawlessness that brought Adam
[1:02:52] into the state that we're in right now
[1:02:56] it was a lawless act it was standing
[1:02:59] coming against the word of God the
[1:03:02] preeminence will praise the Lord
[1:03:05] and it was because a man of lawlessness
[1:03:08] that we are here that we are fighting
[1:03:11] what we're fighting for but Christ has
[1:03:14] come to take us back
[1:03:19] I tell you what until you make it your
[1:03:22] now he's made it his price the scripture
[1:03:24] says who for the joy that was set before
[1:03:27] him he endured the cross despising the
[1:03:32] shame what was he doing he was paying
[1:03:36] the price for you to come back
[1:03:42] okay
[1:03:44] well praise the Lord
[1:03:46] amen are y'all catching my draft now now
[1:03:49] now now Christ
[1:03:52] endured the cross because he saw the joy
[1:03:56] that was ahead of him
[1:04:00] in other words he saw you brother John
[1:04:03] he saw me amen he saw every one of you
[1:04:07] he saw you back in your position of
[1:04:11] authority in a world
[1:04:15] where law is the order
[1:04:19] Hallelujah
[1:04:20] now you say law
[1:04:23] amen
[1:04:24] is it too childlike
[1:04:26] is it too childlike to think
[1:04:32] that all things can come under the
[1:04:34] authority of the law
[1:04:38] is it too childlike to think
[1:04:40] that the Sons and Daughters of God will
[1:04:43] become so at one with God again till
[1:04:45] their words will become law
[1:04:49] is it too childlike to think that the
[1:04:52] authority of God can come back in human
[1:04:56] vessels again and we live in a perfect
[1:05:00] world without sin demons and devils
[1:05:05] is it true childlike to think that we
[1:05:10] are going back to Perfection
[1:05:15] [Applause]
[1:05:19] he's gonna have to take you out of this
[1:05:20] lawlessness
[1:05:22] and take you back to that place of
[1:05:24] authority I'll praise the name of the
[1:05:27] Lord
[1:05:28] amen yes sir now look here Hebrews 2 and
[1:05:32] 6 but one in a certain place testified
[1:05:36] saying what is man the thou art mindful
[1:05:39] of him or the son of man that thou has
[1:05:41] visited him now that was made him a
[1:05:45] little lower than the Angels thou
[1:05:47] crownest him with glory and honor and
[1:05:51] did set him over the works of thine
[1:05:54] hands
[1:05:55] and thou has put
[1:05:58] all things somebody say all things
[1:06:02] in subjection under his feet for in that
[1:06:07] he put all somebody say ow in subjection
[1:06:12] under him he left nothing that is not
[1:06:17] under him somebody say he left nothing
[1:06:22] but now
[1:06:24] we see not yet all things under him
[1:06:28] now he's saying he was created for that
[1:06:30] purpose
[1:06:31] but now
[1:06:33] now we see not things everything not yet
[1:06:36] under him but he said but we see Jesus
[1:06:43] well praise the Lord
[1:06:45] now now here you are created you were
[1:06:48] created for Authority you were created
[1:06:50] for a Dominion you were created to not
[1:06:53] have sickness you were created not to
[1:06:55] have well praise the Lord you were
[1:06:57] created to rule the devil
[1:07:00] you were created to rule the Earth
[1:07:03] created to stand as God stands you would
[1:07:08] be his body here on the Earth
[1:07:12] but now we find ourselves even lower
[1:07:14] than the angels now we find ourselves
[1:07:17] with no Authority under us amen there's
[1:07:20] not not everything's under a shed but we
[1:07:23] see Jesus why do we see Jesus we're not
[1:07:27] looking at our inabilities anymore we're
[1:07:30] not looking at the lawlessness anymore
[1:07:32] we're not looking at the failures
[1:07:34] anymore we are looking at the one who is
[1:07:38] taking us back to our position
[1:07:47] but we somebody say but we see
[1:07:50] Jesus
[1:07:52] now as long as he has the preeminence
[1:07:57] he's going to lead you right back
[1:08:00] but we see Jesus who was made a little
[1:08:02] lower than the angels He was made of man
[1:08:04] for the suffering of death crowned with
[1:08:07] Glory and Honor that he by the grace of
[1:08:10] God should taste death for every man for
[1:08:13] it became him this is when you need to
[1:08:16] say hallelujah
[1:08:17] for whom are all things and by whom are
[1:08:20] all things in bringing many sons
[1:08:25] unto Glory
[1:08:27] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:08:29] perfect through sufferings so Christ the
[1:08:33] lamb paid the price
[1:08:36] so that Christ the word could have the
[1:08:40] preeminence back in the church
[1:08:49] all of this is done
[1:08:52] in the age
[1:08:54] of lawlessness
[1:08:57] this is all done
[1:08:59] to when no one can say you're wrong
[1:09:02] no one can say you're right
[1:09:05] no one can say anything because you're
[1:09:08] right in your own sight
[1:09:10] lawlessness
[1:09:12] work doesn't have preeminence
[1:09:15] God doesn't have preeminence now the law
[1:09:19] of the land no longer has preeminence
[1:09:23] it's the state
[1:09:24] the mystery of iniquity is no longer
[1:09:27] mysterious
[1:09:29] mystery babbling the great is no longer
[1:09:32] mysterious
[1:09:34] it is now the realities that we're
[1:09:38] living in
[1:09:39] if the preeminence of Christ was once
[1:09:42] mysterious
[1:09:45] the preeminence of Christ is becoming
[1:09:48] realities in you today can you say Amen
[1:09:53] now how will there be a Rapture in this
[1:09:56] environment
[1:09:57] the Rapture is in the three stages
[1:10:00] it's hearing the shout
[1:10:02] which was Luke 17 30 in the days of the
[1:10:06] revealing of the son of man as it was in
[1:10:08] the days of Sodom
[1:10:10] when God came down Prophet God came down
[1:10:12] as Sodom is fixing to burn he did not go
[1:10:15] to Sodom to reveal himself he came to
[1:10:18] his prophet Abraham who had the promise
[1:10:21] of a body change he came and said listen
[1:10:24] can I hide anything
[1:10:27] from Abraham seeing that he will command
[1:10:31] his family
[1:10:35] he will structure them he will build
[1:10:38] them in that environment
[1:10:41] of the promise
[1:10:44] now
[1:10:45] he comes to Abraham and says Abram
[1:10:49] Sodom is fixing to burn
[1:10:52] then he says and you're fixing to have a
[1:10:55] body change
[1:10:57] Sarah's fixing to have a baby
[1:11:00] now Sarah's laughing and saying how can
[1:11:02] this be
[1:11:04] can you say Amen she had woke up in a
[1:11:06] bad mood that morning am I going too
[1:11:07] slow here tonight or this morning she
[1:11:09] woke up a little bit in a bad mood and
[1:11:12] now I hear Abraham he's he's over here
[1:11:14] visiting a stranger again always talking
[1:11:17] about the supernatural always talking
[1:11:19] about an angel always talking about God
[1:11:21] appearing and now here's this man
[1:11:23] sitting here Abraham has asked her to go
[1:11:25] feed or to get get the get the calf
[1:11:28] ready get the milk ready get everything
[1:11:30] ready Sarah is in a bad mood
[1:11:34] but in order for the preeminence of the
[1:11:37] word to take place in her womb it must
[1:11:41] take place in her heart
[1:11:45] lot is fixing to burn Sodom is fixing
[1:11:49] about the scripture says as it was in
[1:11:52] the days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:11:56] revealing
[1:11:58] what is the shout message it is the
[1:12:00] revealing of the son of man it is the
[1:12:04] revelations being made unclear it is to
[1:12:08] Revelations 10 1-7 it is the anointing
[1:12:12] the mighty Angel the great Angel of the
[1:12:15] Covenant
[1:12:17] coming down with an open book
[1:12:20] and giving it to the seventh angel who's
[1:12:23] declaring the mystery of God that is the
[1:12:26] shout
[1:12:29] well praise the Lord
[1:12:31] somebody's glad you heard the shout
[1:12:33] how many glad God came to you and said
[1:12:35] hey you now listen I'm going to give you
[1:12:37] I'm going to I'm going to reveal the
[1:12:39] whole mystery to you sodom's fixing to
[1:12:40] burn
[1:12:41] lot didn't hear it lot didn't hear it
[1:12:44] Abraham heard it
[1:12:47] and he says that promise that you've
[1:12:49] been waiting on well I didn't hear that
[1:12:51] Abraham heard that
[1:12:55] and I just want to tell you Abraham woke
[1:12:58] up one morning with a brand new body and
[1:13:00] so did his wife Hallelujah you say now
[1:13:03] now now oh yeah amen what did the king
[1:13:05] say I love that girl she's I want her
[1:13:09] can you say Amen so you see but now
[1:13:12] that's the first stage that is as he is
[1:13:14] descending that's the reason is it is a
[1:13:17] mystery of the rapture
[1:13:20] it's Christ doing all three
[1:13:24] but it is a it is a revelation of his
[1:13:29] word
[1:13:32] but what's the second what's the second
[1:13:34] stage of this rapture
[1:13:36] hallelujah it's that voice
[1:13:39] it is the preeminence
[1:13:42] of the word in his body here on the
[1:13:47] Earth
[1:13:51] you see Pentecost where the world thinks
[1:13:54] that it's going to be a Rapture amen and
[1:13:56] and and the the little the the the the
[1:13:58] little pixie thing is going to come and
[1:14:01] raise uh wave the magic wand and and
[1:14:04] we're all going to fly away and we're
[1:14:06] going to we're going to uh no no no no
[1:14:09] you see the ones that's going in Eden
[1:14:12] the one going back to Eden are those who
[1:14:15] have heard the voice of the Lord and
[1:14:17] have come under the preeminence of that
[1:14:19] word it's those that have taken the word
[1:14:22] of God believe the word of God instill
[1:14:25] that word within their heart
[1:14:27] can you say man that's the purpose when
[1:14:30] you see yourself in that Revelation that
[1:14:33] you are that purpose
[1:14:36] now the prophet would say there it is he
[1:14:40] is sending a Vindicated prophet
[1:14:42] he is sending a prophet after almost 2
[1:14:44] 000 years he's sending someone who is so
[1:14:47] far from organization and education and
[1:14:48] the world of religion that has John the
[1:14:50] Baptist and Elijah of old
[1:14:52] he will hear only from God he will have
[1:14:54] thus saith the Lord and speak for God he
[1:14:57] will be God's mouthpiece And he as it is
[1:15:00] declared in Malachi 4 and 6 will turn
[1:15:02] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:15:03] fathers he will bring back the elect of
[1:15:07] the last day they will hear a Vindicated
[1:15:10] Prophet that was given the truth as as
[1:15:12] it was with Paul he will restore the
[1:15:15] truth as they had it and those he left
[1:15:17] with him in that day will be the ones
[1:15:20] who manifest the Lord be his body be his
[1:15:24] voice and perform his Works Hallelujah
[1:15:28] do you see it
[1:15:30] and you say man
[1:15:32] the preeminence
[1:15:34] that word taking that place within our
[1:15:36] hearts preparing can you say Amen
[1:15:40] placing the value upon that word
[1:15:44] placing the value upon that revelation
[1:15:48] because it is the revealing of Christ it
[1:15:52] was the revealing of his word it's the
[1:15:55] revealing of who you are you're the
[1:15:59] reason the word came
[1:16:05] when Christ came when God came and
[1:16:08] appeared unto Adam he called his name
[1:16:10] Adam
[1:16:11] Where Art Thou
[1:16:14] he knew who Adam was he came with his
[1:16:17] name what praise the Lord there are some
[1:16:20] names that are written on that open book
[1:16:22] and it's the mysterious one that is
[1:16:25] calling your name he is not saying
[1:16:27] Wendell Martin or amen because there's
[1:16:29] Hallelujah believe it or not there's two
[1:16:31] Wendell Martins in the world I know for
[1:16:33] sure hallelujah amen I went to go get a
[1:16:36] gun and they wouldn't let me have it and
[1:16:39] matter of fact I had I had the ATF and
[1:16:42] these guys all calling me Hallelujah so
[1:16:44] I thought I'd get on the internet and
[1:16:45] see what was going on there's a Wendell
[1:16:47] Martin and he's in prison in uh in
[1:16:50] Florida hallelujah amen thank God for
[1:16:54] for Social Security numbers amen but you
[1:16:56] see God
[1:16:58] has calling his people by his
[1:17:02] what you are his word
[1:17:09] you were predestinated to be here on
[1:17:12] this Earth at this time
[1:17:15] and when that word that is preached to
[1:17:17] you in this generation you'll understand
[1:17:19] it you'll see it you'll grab it with
[1:17:22] everything that you've got because you
[1:17:24] are the rapturing generation
[1:17:26] Moses didn't question God he was
[1:17:29] predestinated of God to do it when God
[1:17:31] appeared to him Abraham did not question
[1:17:34] God he was predestinated of God to be
[1:17:37] that prophet
[1:17:39] no I did not question God in the midst
[1:17:43] of all the science there was something
[1:17:45] in the heart that says I believe it when
[1:17:48] everyone else says you are absolutely
[1:17:50] crazy and When God says this is a
[1:17:53] rapturing church it's because you are
[1:17:57] predestinated to it
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:03] What God Says
[1:18:06] [Applause]
[1:18:08] can you say Amen
[1:18:10] Luther knew who he was
[1:18:12] Wesley knew who he was
[1:18:15] your Prophet knew who he was but now the
[1:18:18] revelations got to fall into the body
[1:18:20] you've got to know who you are
[1:18:24] and let that same revelation
[1:18:27] become preeminent in you
[1:18:31] preeminent in you
[1:18:33] what what what what what does that mean
[1:18:34] brother Wendell that means when the
[1:18:37] angel of the Lord appears to marry and
[1:18:40] says you're the girl
[1:18:42] and Mary says
[1:18:44] how can I be the girl
[1:18:46] I've never known a man
[1:18:49] and then the angel says ha but you are
[1:18:52] highly favored of the Lord
[1:18:54] you are the one that is to bring forth
[1:18:56] this Christ child and the Holy Spirit is
[1:18:58] going to overshadow you
[1:19:00] and she quit questioning and she looked
[1:19:03] around and she says
[1:19:04] I'll take that Revelation and let it
[1:19:08] have preeminence
[1:19:11] in me
[1:19:13] I will believe that
[1:19:15] I will accept that
[1:19:20] brother how else is God going to do that
[1:19:22] in you except you accept the Revelation
[1:19:25] when it is given unto you
[1:19:29] oh come on church it's been like that in
[1:19:32] every age it had they had to accept it
[1:19:34] in the first and the second and the
[1:19:35] third and the fourth they had to say
[1:19:37] what God was doing
[1:19:39] a man the prophet would say Paul said
[1:19:41] that the word come in power as well as
[1:19:43] voice the word preached actually
[1:19:45] demonstrated itself like a flame-cutting
[1:19:48] sword it went to the consciences of men
[1:19:50] like a surgeon's knife it cut out the
[1:19:53] diseases and said captives free everyone
[1:19:56] everywhere those early Believers went
[1:19:58] they went preaching the gospel the word
[1:20:00] and God confirmed that word with signs
[1:20:03] and wonders the sick were healed the
[1:20:05] Devils were cast out they spoke in new
[1:20:07] tongues that was the word in action and
[1:20:10] that word has never failed in the mouths
[1:20:14] of believing Christians and in this last
[1:20:17] day somebody say and in
[1:20:20] this last day
[1:20:22] it is here stronger and greater than
[1:20:27] ever in the true word bright
[1:20:35] why is it here stronger than ever is
[1:20:38] because this is the day of the revealing
[1:20:43] this is the day of Revelations 10 where
[1:20:46] the Thunders are unveiled
[1:20:50] and we see the mystery of what God has
[1:20:54] been doing
[1:20:55] and then we take that mystery into our
[1:20:57] heart we accept it we believe it and it
[1:21:02] becomes part of our lives our words our
[1:21:05] actions
[1:21:07] everything about us is every action
[1:21:11] about us every thought about us
[1:21:13] everything everything that we it don't
[1:21:15] matter we're in the Lion's Den we're
[1:21:17] coming out it don't matter we're in the
[1:21:18] whale's belly we're coming out it don't
[1:21:21] matter where we are because there is a
[1:21:23] revelation in the church it's not
[1:21:25] something in the future it's not
[1:21:26] something in the past I am that
[1:21:28] revelation
[1:21:30] I am that body of Christ going into a
[1:21:34] rapture
[1:21:37] can you say man
[1:21:39] amen says in the last days it's your
[1:21:42] stronger and greater than ever in the
[1:21:44] true word bride oh little flock you
[1:21:46] little minority hold to that word fill
[1:21:48] your mouth and heart with it someday God
[1:21:50] will give you the kingdom can you say
[1:21:52] Amen
[1:21:53] so The Voice
[1:21:55] of preeminence of the word is in his
[1:21:59] body
[1:22:00] you under your message
[1:22:04] become the final voice
[1:22:07] to the final eight
[1:22:09] you taking the Revelation and eating
[1:22:14] that book that Revelation you become
[1:22:19] what you eat
[1:22:22] [Music]
[1:22:24] can you say Amen
[1:22:26] now
[1:22:28] the way you live your life
[1:22:30] is your voice
[1:22:32] where you put your emphasis
[1:22:35] shows whether the voice has the
[1:22:37] preeminence
[1:22:38] go ahead praise the Lord
[1:22:40] if you're living in Malice and
[1:22:41] bitterness and hatefulness all the time
[1:22:44] you've not you've not become the voice
[1:22:46] you've not heard the shout
[1:22:48] you hear the shout you'll become that
[1:22:51] word
[1:22:55] praise the Lord
[1:22:57] oh man God's wanting preeminence what
[1:22:59] did what is the threefold purpose amen
[1:23:02] God revealing himself in a man Jesus
[1:23:06] Christ
[1:23:07] revealing himself making himself known
[1:23:10] in a body of dust
[1:23:14] then having the preeminence in his
[1:23:18] church
[1:23:19] and through that preeminence will then
[1:23:22] Rapture you take you back to the eating
[1:23:25] condition in the beginning
[1:23:29] I want to tell you a lawless church will
[1:23:31] not be a part of the Rapture it's going
[1:23:34] to be a Rapture the Rapture church is
[1:23:39] going to be where the word has taken the
[1:23:43] preeminence in it's not my opinion it's
[1:23:46] not your opinion it's the words opinion
[1:23:48] the word has the preeminence
[1:23:55] the Brenham
[1:23:57] would say
[1:23:59] for he said when the Holy Ghost has come
[1:24:01] he will bring these things that have
[1:24:03] taught you to your memory
[1:24:05] and we'll show you things to come
[1:24:08] that's the kind of tutor we've got
[1:24:11] the Holy Spirit to reveal and to bring
[1:24:15] the disciplined book of the father
[1:24:18] and reveal to you what God's plan is
[1:24:26] Hallelujah
[1:24:28] the discipline book of the father to
[1:24:32] reveal what God's plan is
[1:24:35] in other words that book
[1:24:38] is is is is part of the key
[1:24:42] it's the key to the rapture
[1:24:45] amen
[1:24:47] he says then when we step across them
[1:24:49] boundaries and turn away from it with a
[1:24:51] stiff neck
[1:24:52] and what does the Holy Spirit thing when
[1:24:54] he stands before the father to bring a
[1:24:56] character to him can you see brother
[1:24:58] sister while we're not progressing like
[1:25:01] we ought to it's our character that is
[1:25:05] tearing us down
[1:25:07] now we're children
[1:25:09] when we're born again we're a child of
[1:25:11] God we're children disobedient children
[1:25:14] but I wish I had the voice and could
[1:25:17] stand here and and the time we would lay
[1:25:20] on it for hours of the Disobedience of
[1:25:22] the church to God and how the holy
[1:25:24] spirit is bringing that word back and
[1:25:27] forth
[1:25:29] well praise the Lord
[1:25:31] don't forget there's two resurrections
[1:25:37] those that have allowed the word to have
[1:25:39] the preeminence there will be in that
[1:25:40] first resurrection according to
[1:25:42] scripture
[1:25:43] there will be more in that land and the
[1:25:45] second Resurrection but they're not
[1:25:47] going to rule and reign
[1:25:49] well glory to God
[1:25:52] amen what is discipline
[1:25:54] discipline is to regulate
[1:25:56] it's to bring into order
[1:25:58] discipline to give direction
[1:26:01] to train
[1:26:04] with a firm hand
[1:26:06] discipline a disciplined life is one of
[1:26:09] self-control
[1:26:11] self-government
[1:26:12] self-discipline
[1:26:14] obedience
[1:26:16] controlled Behavior
[1:26:19] bringing you into line a firm hand
[1:26:23] a Desi a disciplined life
[1:26:27] to discipline is to discipline yourself
[1:26:30] for a Cause
[1:26:33] what can you say man that means to train
[1:26:35] the oneself to do something in a
[1:26:38] controlled or a habitual way
[1:26:40] successful people
[1:26:42] follow a plan
[1:26:44] Hallelujah
[1:26:48] amen
[1:26:49] and you must discipline yourself
[1:26:52] amen into adopting regular working
[1:26:56] methods now now I I want you to think
[1:26:59] about this because
[1:27:00] what we see what we find lacking in too
[1:27:04] much of the church is the word is not
[1:27:08] our Center focus every day of our life
[1:27:13] we've got the basics laid down
[1:27:16] but what God is wanting is you to take
[1:27:20] his word for every aspect of your life
[1:27:28] praise the Lord
[1:27:30] that's the reason why he only gets
[1:27:34] three services and out of us uh a month
[1:27:39] some of us he gets you know one service
[1:27:41] or once every two months or whatever
[1:27:43] because the priority is not rapture
[1:27:49] the priority
[1:27:51] is to fit him into the mix
[1:27:58] Hallelujah as we've been teaching now
[1:28:00] for the last two and a half months on
[1:28:02] that mysterious one and who that
[1:28:05] mysterious one is of Revelations the
[1:28:07] first child the second chapter first
[1:28:09] chapter second whichever one that is
[1:28:12] amen we find that that that
[1:28:16] Revelation is Christ in you
[1:28:23] well praise the Lord
[1:28:25] now
[1:28:27] so the working methods it's following a
[1:28:30] certain program to discipline is a
[1:28:33] certain schedule it is a certain method
[1:28:37] and if it's not
[1:28:39] well let me just pick on something easy
[1:28:40] I if if it's not
[1:28:44] if work
[1:28:46] w-o-r-k
[1:28:49] labor is not important to you
[1:28:54] and if it's not your priority
[1:29:01] well praise the Lord
[1:29:03] it will not fit into your schedule
[1:29:07] as priority
[1:29:11] and call me here this morning am I doing
[1:29:12] all right in Hallelujah
[1:29:15] amen yes you know you should go to work
[1:29:17] yes you know others do it yes you know
[1:29:21] the Bible says you should but because it
[1:29:24] is not your priority you are not
[1:29:28] disciplined to get up and go to work
[1:29:33] it's not an absolute to you
[1:29:37] we know it's what men do
[1:29:40] we know that that's how you get your
[1:29:42] money we know
[1:29:46] but when it's not the priority
[1:29:51] believe me there will be plenty of
[1:29:52] things to come up
[1:29:54] to distract you
[1:29:56] from going to work
[1:29:59] well glory to God
[1:30:08] now what makes you do this
[1:30:10] it's become part of your schedule it's
[1:30:14] part of Who You Are
[1:30:16] it's be why you have got strong
[1:30:19] convictions about it
[1:30:21] I will live
[1:30:23] under a bridge
[1:30:26] if I don't work
[1:30:30] my family will be upset if they can't
[1:30:33] have McDonald's occasionally
[1:30:35] if I don't go to work
[1:30:38] then you become structured
[1:30:44] then you become well praise the Lord I'm
[1:30:46] still talking about this you discipline
[1:30:48] yourself that means when you when the
[1:30:51] alarm clock hits and you're trying to
[1:30:53] and you're trying to find that alarm for
[1:30:55] the tenth time and you finally get up
[1:30:58] why
[1:31:00] Hallelujah
[1:31:02] because you've got some absolutes in
[1:31:04] your life and you've got to go to work
[1:31:05] in order to get a paycheck
[1:31:07] now for those now you say well that
[1:31:09] that's that that there's a lot of people
[1:31:11] that has never had that kind of
[1:31:12] discipline
[1:31:13] and it's because they don't think that
[1:31:14] work is really all that important and
[1:31:16] believe me it'll go from a toe wake to
[1:31:18] an to a migraine to a this to that to
[1:31:22] what got no gas in the car well my tires
[1:31:24] halfway flat I can't make it to where I
[1:31:26] mean hello I've heard it all
[1:31:30] I've been pastoring a long time now I've
[1:31:32] heard it all
[1:31:36] elujah
[1:31:38] but now someone that does have those
[1:31:40] ethics
[1:31:41] and how does have that absolute in their
[1:31:43] life
[1:31:44] then they become
[1:31:46] they they become structured around that
[1:31:49] vision
[1:31:50] they become structured and disciplined
[1:31:53] are y'all understanding me so then it
[1:31:56] doesn't matter amen I'm going to get up
[1:31:59] and go to work whether I had a migraine
[1:32:01] or not and I learned to just push
[1:32:02] through it
[1:32:03] I had to get up and go do these things
[1:32:04] just push through it why
[1:32:06] amen this is because I had a
[1:32:09] responsibility
[1:32:10] and my number one response to my my
[1:32:12] number one thing that kept me going even
[1:32:14] with all my backaches and when the when
[1:32:15] the doctor was would love to have given
[1:32:17] me a disability and all of that I said
[1:32:19] I've got three boys and they're going to
[1:32:21] see me working every day
[1:32:22] and praise the Lord amen it's important
[1:32:27] it's important to me therefore I put
[1:32:30] that thing I put it I disciplined myself
[1:32:34] whether I had headaches whether I had
[1:32:36] backaches whether I oh come on Church

[1:33:26] this and my wife was driving me around
[1:33:28] to the jobs amen

[1:33:35] bed I wasn't going to be there I had
[1:33:38] [Applause]
[1:33:42] I'm just using something that all of us
[1:33:43] guys can understand what about your
[1:33:46] spiritual walk
[1:33:52] what about this rapture
[1:33:57] what about walking in perfect love
[1:34:00] before God and man
[1:34:05] what about that word having preeminence
[1:34:09] in you
[1:34:15] if the rapture's not our priority
[1:34:18] the shout means nothing more than just a
[1:34:21] wonderful little message
[1:34:23] and the voice we're waiting for that to
[1:34:25] come and you don't realize that that
[1:34:26] word you are you become
[1:34:30] that letter read and known of all men
[1:34:39] and it ain't just what you're saying

[1:35:03] victory for our for for for ourselves we
[1:35:07] know what the key of Victory is but

[1:35:19] church and we'll go through the
[1:35:20] religious worship do you really think
[1:35:21] that this is all this is you do you
[1:35:23] really think the gospel has it just been
[1:35:25] has it just been diluted down to some
[1:35:27] good church services are we not
[1:35:29] preparing to leave this place is not
[1:35:31] this the place for the authority of the
[1:35:34] sons of God and we're setting here just

[1:36:34] and yet we're saying we're increased
[1:36:36] with goods and have need of nothing
[1:36:40] we have placed our value on something
[1:36:45] other than this rapture
[1:36:54] there is not a scripture in the Bible
[1:36:57] more clear
[1:36:58] than Church attendance

[1:39:55] it but that's Bible anyways
[1:39:57] and it's the Lawless spirit that will

[1:40:42] you're saying what you got off the
[1:40:43] Rapture no no no no we're still in the
[1:40:46] second phase of the Rapture to where the
[1:40:49] word is now living having preeminence in
[1:40:54] you
[1:40:58] it's those that are taking that word
[1:41:01] this this is happening
[1:41:03] there'll be a shout there'll be the
[1:41:05] voice then there's the Trump there's the
[1:41:07] dead raised
[1:41:13] amen Christ is God revealed threefold
[1:41:18] purpose
[1:41:19] is that right

[1:41:23] having preeminence in his church his
[1:41:27] body taking us back
[1:41:31] we'll praise the Lord
[1:41:34] so disciplined Saints
[1:41:37] a disciplined Christian gives complete
[1:41:40] adherence to the word and that that
[1:41:42] discipline again what does that
[1:41:44] discipline mean it means he or she has
[1:41:46] learned to discipline his or her
[1:41:50] emotions
[1:41:53] all right
[1:41:54] I'm not talking about mind over matter
[1:41:56] I'm talking about the word having
[1:41:59] preeminence
[1:42:00] I'm talking about getting in prayer
[1:42:03] dedicating ourselves this ain't mind
[1:42:06] over matter okay I'm gonna be good I'm

[1:42:15] where you're putting them out there
[1:42:18] if you want a successful marriage you
[1:42:21] will put your priorities in prayer
[1:42:25] if you want a successful walk with God
[1:42:28] you'll put your priorities with prayer
[1:42:31] watering that word
[1:42:34] to be made
[1:42:37] you see
[1:42:38] you see the Paradox here you're living
[1:42:41] in the age of lawlessness
[1:42:43] and these doors here
[1:42:45] does not exempt you
[1:42:48] from that spirit that used to be mystery
[1:42:50] iniquity
[1:42:52] it's no longer mysterious
[1:42:54] the veil's been taken off the book
[1:42:56] we see what the devil has done
[1:43:00] throughout the church ages distracting
[1:43:03] us in many many many forms away from the
[1:43:07] word
[1:43:11] yeah
[1:43:14] and yet in the midst of lawlessness
[1:43:17] God's got a bride
[1:43:19] in the midst of lawlessness
[1:43:22] God's got a bride
[1:43:24] that is subjecting him herself
[1:43:27] to his word
[1:43:29] Hallelujah
[1:43:34] come on
[1:43:35] discipline is required for shutting down
[1:43:38] your attitudes
[1:43:43] discipline is required for shutting your
[1:43:46] mouth
[1:43:47] discipline is required for shutting the
[1:43:50] computer off
[1:43:52] discipline is required
[1:43:55] for saying yes ma'am to Mom
[1:43:57] discipline is required for for Walking
[1:44:01] with God in a pure heart requires
[1:44:06] boy must be doing pretty good because
[1:44:08] you're listening pretty hard
[1:44:12] discipline is required to forgive it's
[1:44:14] seven times seventy
[1:44:17] in one day
[1:44:19] and wake up the next morning with
[1:44:21] mercies renewed and have to forgive
[1:44:22] another Seventy Times Seven and for that
[1:44:25] day and then wake up and the nurse
[1:44:27] mercies are renewed again
[1:44:29] 70 times 7. it takes disciplined heart
[1:44:32] to come before God and say
[1:44:36] I want to be that
[1:44:38] I want to live that
[1:44:41] I want to be everything that you want me
[1:44:43] to be
[1:44:44] well praise the Lord
[1:44:46] amen
[1:44:47] brother Branham says now how can the
[1:44:49] church
[1:44:51] be adopted when
[1:44:53] they can't come to discipline
[1:44:56] we've got to be disciplined first God
[1:44:58] could not trust this power with the
[1:45:00] church it's hard to tell what you do
[1:45:02] with it
[1:45:03] How could a father trust his business to
[1:45:05] a boy that might simply pollute his own
[1:45:08] inheritance he couldn't do it the church
[1:45:10] has got to come to a place to where it's
[1:45:12] discipline
[1:45:13] God's on that work right now
[1:45:16] discipline
[1:45:18] can you say man
[1:45:20] all right amen someone say hallelujah
[1:45:24] good job brother Wendell
[1:45:27] thanks
[1:45:30] the third pool operates
[1:45:35] it can only operate
[1:45:38] amen by a structured life
[1:45:43] as I'm as I'm beginning to descend here
[1:45:46] I find
[1:45:49] that a lot of times if we don't have
[1:45:52] structure in our personal walks
[1:45:56] if we don't have structure in our
[1:45:58] personal lives
[1:46:01] and and and I mean Beyond just
[1:46:04] eating drinking and going to work and to
[1:46:07] church
[1:46:08] that we miss out on some of the most
[1:46:10] valuable things
[1:46:11] and overcoming because the words got to
[1:46:14] have that effect in here
[1:46:16] amen
[1:46:17] you've got to have that effect right
[1:46:19] here
[1:46:20] and that comes by a real genuine prayer
[1:46:23] really putting it down there you know
[1:46:25] the Bible says that this almost the
[1:46:29] psalmist said I fasted
[1:46:31] and prayer returned to my bosom
[1:46:35] give me that desire back
[1:46:37] you understand
[1:46:38] because the key the key is putting that
[1:46:40] emphasis we get you you say brother
[1:46:42] Wendell
[1:46:44] you're putting it pretty rough on us all
[1:46:45] I'm trying to tell you you're living in
[1:46:48] a god-forsaken world
[1:46:51] and if we're not disciplined we'll just
[1:46:53] be another religious group
[1:46:58] Baptist Pentecostal Methodist message
[1:47:03] and we'll miss the importance
[1:47:05] of why God brought this word to us
[1:47:09] he didn't bring it to us so that we're
[1:47:10] different he brought it to us to
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:14] us to place that word in US
[1:47:19] to have the preeminence in us well we're
[1:47:20] not questioning it and when it's not
[1:47:23] working in us you know when it's not
[1:47:25] working you know when you're losing your
[1:47:26] temper you know when you're not walking
[1:47:28] with God
[1:47:29] and if that prayer is not where it needs
[1:47:32] to be then sometimes good fasting
[1:47:35] just fasting and getting a hold of God
[1:47:37] and say Lord here I am
[1:47:38] I need you
[1:47:40] I need you help me Lord
[1:47:42] can you say man
[1:47:44] brother Brandon says no
[1:47:45] he's talking about that that third pull
[1:47:47] he says here's the secret of this
[1:47:50] the word is in the bride as it was in
[1:47:52] Mary the bride has the mind of Christ
[1:47:55] for she knows what he wants done with
[1:47:59] that word
[1:48:00] she performs the command of God of the
[1:48:03] word in his name for she has thus saith
[1:48:05] the Lord then the word is quickened by
[1:48:08] the spirit and it comes to pass like a
[1:48:09] seed that is planted in watered it comes
[1:48:12] to full Harvest serving its purpose
[1:48:13] those in the bride do only his will no
[1:48:19] one can make them do otherwise they have
[1:48:21] thus saith the Lord
[1:48:23] or they keep still they know it has to
[1:48:25] be God in them doing the works
[1:48:27] fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:48:29] complete all his work while while in his
[1:48:32] Earthly Ministry so now he he works in
[1:48:34] and through the pride she knows that
[1:48:37] somebody say I know that
[1:48:39] for it was not yet time for him to do
[1:48:41] certain things that he must do now but
[1:48:43] he will fulfill through now somebody say
[1:48:46] he
[1:48:48] will fulfill
[1:48:50] through the bride me
[1:48:53] that work which he has left for this
[1:48:55] specific time
[1:48:56] can you say Amen
[1:48:58] God is Not mocked
[1:49:02] what a man sows
[1:49:07] very true
[1:49:09] if you sow to the spirit
[1:49:16] you so do the supernatural
[1:49:21] you suck you sow to this word
[1:49:24] you're going to reap that Supernatural
[1:49:27] Harvest
[1:49:29] [Laughter]
[1:49:31] well glory to God can you say Amen
[1:49:35] amen God's not mocked the scripture the
[1:49:38] scripture there in Colossians 1 and 29
[1:49:40] and wherefore also I I also labor
[1:49:44] striving according to his workings
[1:49:47] which worketh in me what
[1:49:52] um I want that word to have that effect
[1:49:55] in me
[1:49:56] Hallelujah now this is not law because
[1:50:00] it can only be through him
[1:50:03] but if I'm ever going to control this
[1:50:04] Earth if I'm ever going to be put back
[1:50:06] to a position of authority I'm going to
[1:50:08] have to let that word have that
[1:50:09] Authority in me
[1:50:11] well praise the Lord
[1:50:13] and God loves to test his people
[1:50:15] amen if you believe in healing then act
[1:50:18] like he like it like you believe it
[1:50:22] don't be going around in the Molly grubs
[1:50:24] what relationship does faith have with
[1:50:26] fear
[1:50:28] what relationship does doubt have within
[1:50:31] uh with with faith can you say man
[1:50:34] how can Prevailing Faith in a prevailing
[1:50:38] word be sorrowful and sad and despondent
[1:50:42] faith in a prevailing word says God's
[1:50:46] got my answer his word is going to have
[1:50:50] preeminence in me
[1:50:56] brother Joe's going for his test
[1:50:57] tomorrow the second test to amen look at
[1:51:00] his lungs and I say we are we have a
[1:51:04] Prevailing Faith in a prevailing word
[1:51:07] from a prevailing God
[1:51:12] no matter what we feel it don't matter
[1:51:14] what we see it's what God Said
[1:51:18] God loves to test his people
[1:51:24] he wants to see if
[1:51:25] you're going to put the word first
[1:51:28] if you're going to believe him well
[1:51:30] praise the Lord
[1:51:31] stand up there
[1:51:34] amen some of us haven't felt good in a
[1:51:36] while but we're going to keep on
[1:51:38] confessing that word
[1:51:40] and we're gonna believe that word it's a
[1:51:42] Prevailing Faith and a prevailing word
[1:51:45] in a body of Flesh
[1:51:48] but that Prevailing Faith and that
[1:51:49] prevailing word and this Earthly flesh
[1:51:52] is going to be manifested through me
[1:51:57] can you say man
[1:52:00] amen
[1:52:01] premature Graves the prophet says
[1:52:03] there's premature Graves
[1:52:05] because the word didn't have preeminence
[1:52:09] in lives
[1:52:14] well glory to God
[1:52:16] amen that's right
[1:52:18] amen Mass fact brother Brandon used that
[1:52:21] premature grade 37 times he used it 37
[1:52:24] times and he talks about how it's a
[1:52:27] fight of Faith defying every demon of
[1:52:29] doubt and storming that storming of the
[1:52:30] mind and you've got to resist him
[1:52:33] he says maybe it's just one nurse
[1:52:35] amen time of Nursing and you you don't
[1:52:38] get enough strength just stay there draw
[1:52:41] from him until you are walking until
[1:52:43] cancer is gone refuse to see me
[1:52:46] the cancer refused to see anything
[1:52:48] that's contrary to the word it's not so
[1:52:50] everything like Jonah the lying vanities
[1:52:53] oh I you know I won't even see them I
[1:52:56] won't recognize them no sir I see what
[1:52:58] God Said don't see the amorites don't
[1:53:01] see the graveyard don't see the things
[1:53:03] see the promises of God God promised us
[1:53:05] it's up to us to it's up to God to take
[1:53:08] care of it yes sir now I know that
[1:53:11] death's got to strikes everyone death
[1:53:13] comes to us all but sometimes it's just
[1:53:16] because of unbelief we give up and go to
[1:53:19] a premature grave God don't want us to
[1:53:22] do that he wants us to trust him and
[1:53:24] believe him and say it so and stay with
[1:53:27] it
[1:53:30] instead of saying I'm dying I'm dying I
[1:53:32] ain't going to make it stand up there
[1:53:34] like to see Abraham and say give him a
[1:53:37] mountain
[1:53:39] give me my Mountain I'm living under
[1:53:42] that anointing Revelations 10 has come
[1:53:46] to me
[1:53:51] God let your word have preeminence in
[1:53:53] everything of my faith let your word
[1:53:55] have preeminence over my mind let your
[1:53:57] word have preeminence over my body let
[1:53:59] your word have preeminence in me
[1:54:03] it's the anointing of the day
[1:54:09] can you see man
[1:54:12] amen
[1:54:13] he wants us
[1:54:15] now
[1:54:17] he said Lazarus died that's true he rose
[1:54:19] again
[1:54:21] and lived a normal life for many many
[1:54:22] years because of the Resurrection
[1:54:24] Jesus gave him and then of course he
[1:54:26] died again because he will come forth in
[1:54:28] the resurrection Jesus said he would
[1:54:30] come forth in that Resurrection
[1:54:32] but he has to go go to his rest like all
[1:54:36] human beings
[1:54:37] but until that time comes
[1:54:41] somebody say until that time comes
[1:54:44] let's not be cheated out of life
[1:54:48] for the service of God
[1:54:51] because it's Satan's business to cheat
[1:54:54] you out of it
[1:54:57] that means I've got a set time that I
[1:55:00] got to go amen
[1:55:02] but until then
[1:55:03] I'm going to enjoy life until I don't
[1:55:06] care how much this back tells me of this
[1:55:07] I don't care what my what what what what
[1:55:09] what this one and that one tells me I
[1:55:12] don't care what what this whatever
[1:55:13] symptoms my body is telling me I'm going
[1:55:16] to stand right there and I'm going to
[1:55:17] say I'm overcoming I am believing you
[1:55:20] ain't cheating me out of it you ain't
[1:55:22] cheating me out of my joy you ain't
[1:55:24] cheat me out of my faith you ain't
[1:55:26] cheating me out you ain't cheating me
[1:55:28] out of the time with my boys and my
[1:55:31] girls and my and my grandchildren you
[1:55:34] ain't going to cheat me out of that time
[1:55:36] the word is having preeminence in me I'm
[1:55:40] going to enjoy everything that I've got
[1:55:47] amen
[1:55:49] well can you say Amen
[1:55:51] you see what I'm saying what I'm doing
[1:55:53] is I'm bringing out some just some
[1:55:54] little things in our lives that we
[1:55:57] attend
[1:55:59] to discount
[1:56:01] and not let the word have the
[1:56:03] preeminence
[1:56:07] we want preeminence
[1:56:10] if musicians would come
[1:56:13] praise the Lord
[1:56:17] Hallelujah
[1:56:23] brother Bradham says there are many that
[1:56:25] are sick and needy in the land
[1:56:26] and that's the future home of the Bride
[1:56:28] by the way
[1:56:29] he says they haven't completed their
[1:56:30] journey and our great enemy not only our
[1:56:33] enemy but your enemy has come to beset
[1:56:35] them and to stop their their lives and
[1:56:38] to send them to a premature grave
[1:56:41] we're asking for them today that you and
[1:56:43] your mercy and Grace Lord will extend
[1:56:45] their days
[1:56:46] to the allotted time
[1:56:49] can you say man
[1:56:51] Lord I'm going to believe you
[1:56:55] I'm gonna I'm gonna throw my everything
[1:56:56] behind it
[1:56:58] enough of my attitudes
[1:57:00] enough of these attitudes
[1:57:04] amen
[1:57:06] pastors aren't supposed to be Doty
[1:57:08] grandpas
[1:57:10] God's not supposed to be dirty grandpas
[1:57:13] it's the word
[1:57:15] and if you expect to make a rapture
[1:57:17] get your attitude in line
[1:57:21] get your act again
[1:57:24] amen
[1:57:26] because we want that word to have the
[1:57:27] preeminence
[1:57:31] you want that word to have that
[1:57:32] preemness
[1:57:34] [Applause]
[1:57:38] brother Branham says now on this last
[1:57:40] stage
[1:57:41] the spirit he has cried after this last
[1:57:43] age you have the word and we have how
[1:57:45] many beliefs we got the revelation
[1:57:47] you have more Bibles than ever but
[1:57:49] you're not doing anything about that
[1:57:51] word
[1:57:52] except dividing and hacking it into
[1:57:54] pieces
[1:57:55] taking what you want leave out what you
[1:57:57] don't want you're not interested in
[1:57:59] living it but debating it
[1:58:01] he said I would sooner you were cold or
[1:58:04] hot
[1:58:05] if you were cold and rejected I could
[1:58:07] stand that
[1:58:08] if you would get white hot to know its
[1:58:11] truth and live it I would praise you for
[1:58:12] that
[1:58:13] but when you simply take my word and
[1:58:15] don't honor it I in turn must refuse you
[1:58:19] I will spew you out for you nauseate me
[1:58:23] on down he says then what is the wrong
[1:58:26] with the these people of the last day
[1:58:29] they have gotten away from the word they
[1:58:33] are no longer fervent about it
[1:58:35] they are lukewarm
[1:58:38] about it
[1:58:44] but the apostle Paul to Timothy 4 and 15
[1:58:47] says meditate upon these things
[1:58:50] give thyself holy to them
[1:58:55] that thy profiting may appear to all
[1:59:00] take heed unto thyself
[1:59:04] and unto the doctrine
[1:59:07] continue in them for in doing this Thou
[1:59:11] shalt both save thyself
[1:59:14] and them that hear thee
[1:59:18] Lord
[1:59:21] I want
[1:59:23] I want
[1:59:26] that word
[1:59:28] in every part of my life Lord pull back
[1:59:33] the scales now the scale's already been
[1:59:35] pulled back if you listen to the message
[1:59:36] at all you know what the prophet says
[1:59:38] you don't have to you don't have to
[1:59:39] guess that but it's that religious
[1:59:42] spirit of laodicea that wants to come on
[1:59:45] us saying I don't have need of anything
[1:59:47] I'm fine
[1:59:50] and Christ is standing there knocking
[1:59:54] you've got to fight that you said I've
[1:59:57] got to fight that yes
[1:59:59] both The Virgins were asleep
[2:00:02] [Music]
[2:00:04] it's the spirit
[2:00:07] but here's the paradox
[2:00:09] the Rapture the preeminence of the word
[2:00:12] is taking place right in the midst
[2:00:16] of lawlessness
[2:00:21] to me it's a beautiful Paradox it's a
[2:00:23] how God can pull it off the only way God
[2:00:27] can pull it off is there's an eternal
[2:00:28] seat on the inside of you
[2:00:30] and you're willing
[2:00:32] to humble yourself to that word and say
[2:00:34] take your word and scrub me clean me
[2:00:36] with your word Lord
[2:00:38] clean me with your word is that right
[2:00:41] is that right
[2:00:44] I I just I just believe it
[2:00:48] I believe this this message here is just
[2:00:50] as important as
[2:00:52] as telling us our place
[2:00:55] believing the word we put that oh I
[2:00:57] don't drink I don't smoke but yeah but
[2:00:59] you won't believe him for nothing
[2:01:01] but yeah you subtract his word for this
[2:01:03] but yeah but you said nothing whether
[2:01:05] you don't know
[2:01:07] no
[2:01:08] no no
[2:01:09] time for lawlessness
[2:01:12] he says it don't excuse it
[2:01:16] this is his work
[2:01:18] I didn't say it
[2:01:20] the prophet said it
[2:01:23] God's word said it
[2:01:25] and we stand here saying Amen to it
[2:01:29] is that right
[2:01:31] I say Amen to it by living it
[2:01:36] [Music]
[2:01:41] renew me
[2:01:43] in thy spirit
[2:01:46] [Music]
