And and uh and uh just just going to uh just to have a [music] wonderful day of Thanksgiving. And um so we uh I know everyone will enjoy themselves today. Let's look here in the book of Hebrews, the 11th [music] chapter. And um man, we're um uh it's it's been good to I I didn't mention it the other night, but it's been good to have brother Kevin home. &gt;&gt; And uh [applause] you know, we we sure love brother Kevin and and good to see brother Connor. miss him when he's not here.

And so uh and for elders, that's that's quite a feat. Amen. I think they're all in their 70s and 80s and and uh but we're just we're just really glad to to have y'all every time you come. Amen. There Hebrews 11 and8 it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed. and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Abraham the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which has foundations whose builder and maker is God. Now, if if we were to uh go on down to the 13th verse, just to save time, these all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them a far off, were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is in heavenly. &gt;&gt; Uh wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a city. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I also want to look here in Isaiah the 11th chapter and the 10th verse. Amen. Isaiah and 11. This was a promise to those who those heavenly citizens. Amen. We were from a heavenly race lost here on this earth and but God has given us. Amen. in Isaiah 11 and10. And in that day they there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an in sign of the people to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious. Got one more scripture John 12 and32. Amen. And then we'll have let you have your seats. Amen. So he's going to raise out the root of Jesse shall come. Amen. An insign, an emblem. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going to be a symbol of victory, a banner of of that country. John 12 and32. And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we want to thank you today for your your goodness, your grace, your mercy upon our lives. I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would just satisfy every longing of every heart. I pray Lord as we come in your presence Lord and we we come with reverence and Lord and and and great submission to you and we ask Lord that you would speak to us and encourage our hearts now Lord we just depend upon you today and Lord we thank you and look to you in Jesus name. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated. Amen. We are thankful today uh for his word. &gt;&gt; I I have as a as a title, maybe I could title my thoughts here this morning, the emblem of the homeland. Amen.

NEVERTHELESS, DEATH REIGNED FROM Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that is to come. Hallelujah. Now, this was this was God's first emblem that failed. BUT THE PROPHET WAS SAYING GOD WAS GOING to raise another emblem. And it was GOING TO BE GOD HIMSELF. It was GOING TO BE GOD. ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? ADAM FAILED. AMEN. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SIGN. IT WAS A [screaming] BEAUTIFUL EMBLEM. IT WAS A BE OH, IT WAS WONDERFUL. HALLELUJAH. BUT THE EMBLEM THAT GOD WAS GOING TO RAISE, THEY COULD KILL HIM. THEY WOULD MOCK HIM. THEY WOULD SCOURGE HIM. THEY WOULD [screaming] MAKE FUN OF HIM. BUT THAT WORD MADE FLESH. IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN THAT ONE THAT FELL IN THE GARDEN OF. ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? &gt;&gt; AMEN. Jesus isn't another good man. HE'S NOT A PREACHER. HE'S NOT A POPE. HE'S NOT JUST A PROPHET. JESUS WAS GOD HIMSELF. HE WAS GOD'S EMBLEM [screaming] TO THE WORLD THAT THERE IS LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. There is life. That's it. &gt;&gt; I've come to bear life. Amen. The Pharisees, they were going after, they were they were interested in washing pots and living holy on and fasting and they were doing this and that just as a show. Amen. But Jesus says, "Inside you, you're just full of dead men. You are supplers. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're whitewashed on the outside and you look pretty, but on the inside of you, you're dead." &gt;&gt; But he says, "But I've come to give life I've come that you might have life more abundantly. I'VE NOT COME FOR YOU TO LIVE IN THIS CIVILIZATION ALONE. I'VE I'VE NOT COME TO JUST GIVE YOU NICE HOUSES. I'VE NOT COME JUST FOR YOU TO RAISE FAMILIES. [screaming] I'VE COME THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE LIFE MORE ABUNDANTLY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'VE [screaming] COME THAT YOU CAN HAVE A PEACE THAT GOES BEYOND AN IMMORTAL MAN. &gt;&gt; I've come to give life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm still on the topic of thanksgiving. THANKSGIVING. BECAUSE IN THIS LAST DAY, AMEN, WHEN IT ALL SEEMED THAT RELIGION HAD TAKEN OVER AGAIN, WHEN IT SEEMED, AMEN. THAT THE THAT ALL OF THE CATERPILLAR, THE CANKER WORM AND THE PALMER WORM HAD [screaming] EAT UP THE TREE, GOD SENT US A MESSAGE FROM ABOVE &gt;&gt; TO DECLARE [screaming] HE'S ALIVE TODAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It was it was [snorts] the brazen SERPENT THAT WAS RAISED UP. It was an emblem of mercy and healing and peace for those who had who had been bit. Those who were dying. They could look. Keep it up there, Sister Keys. THEY COULD LOOK AND AND THEY WOULD LIVE. It was God's emblem. &gt;&gt; But then they turned around and they took the emblem of healing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they begin to worship it. worship &gt;&gt; and they began what can you say amen made denomination around it &gt;&gt; Jesus came and then what did they do they turned Jesus God's great [sighs] &gt;&gt; until we have what 30,000 denominations today &gt;&gt; turn it into a creed and turn it into a church joining turning it into a money-making scheme that's all the church has become a money-making scheme &gt;&gt; come Come on. Let's see. [panting] Jesus is not money making schemes. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm way off my notes. [laughter] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, when it looked all hopeless, when it looked like everyone had gone after emotion, WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE EVERYONE HAD GONE AFTER THE THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR, WHEN PREACHERS HAD FALLEN, AMEN. WHEN WHEN OUR WHEN OUR CHURCHES WERE NO LONGER LOOKING LIKE CHURCHES ANYMORE. COME ON NOW. HOLINESS WAS GONE. AMEN. WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE WOMEN DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE A WOMAN [screaming] AND A MAN DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE A MAN AND FATHERS DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE FATHERS. HALLELUJAH. GOD [screaming] RAISED UP AN EMBLEM IN THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. [screaming] &gt;&gt; SO THAT YOU WOULD KNOW A LIVING GOD, A LIVING CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? when death reigned. Hallelujah. Now something has gone arry. Hallelujah. But that 15th verse of amen there in Romans 5 and 15. But not as the offense so also was the free gift. For it, if through the offense of one, many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many. Not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift. For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification. For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, amen. Death knows no boundaries. You can sit in this church here. You can be faithful as faithful can be. You can pay your ti. You can come to this church and never miss a service. Amen. For for 30 years and not have the life of God. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That emblem is an emblem of life. God so loved. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; GOD SO LOVED THAT he gave. &gt;&gt; Can you say man? Hallelujah. God raised God raised it today. Amen. That emblem, that banner, that great great emblem right there. Hell knows about it. believers know about it. &gt;&gt; Because there's a correlation between the believer and hell. Hell once held the believer. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; But life come to set us free from the powers of hell. &gt;&gt; Life come to bring me back. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it came for. Hallelujah. Amen. God raised his son. Amen. and that bloody cross would forever. The prophet would say that's how Rahab's house stood on the walls of Jericho when all the rest of it fell because there was a scarlet thread down the outside. &gt;&gt; God honored that scarlet thread. AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL NOT TO BE SLAIN in Egypt, the older son, BECAUSE THERE WAS BLOOD ON THE DOOR. AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSES THE CHURCH TODAY IN THE LAST PLAGUE OF DEATH. THE CHURCH IS THE ONLY ONE THAT'LL LIVE TODAY AND NOT GO OUT INTO UNIVERSALISM AND SO FORTH OUT INTO THIS MODERNISTIC SOCIAL GOSPEL IS THOSE WHO'S GOT THE BLOOD ON THE DOORPOST OUT HERE. THE BLOOD OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST BORN AGAIN. THEY KNOW WHERE THEY'RE STANDING IF THEY'RE REALLY BORN AGAIN. THEY'RE NOT BEING IN UH THEY'LL NOT BE ENTANGLED WITH THE EVERY YOKE AND EVERY DOCTRINE AND TOSSED ABOUT HERE AND THERE AND EVERY CULT. They know where they're standing in Christ through the blood. &gt;&gt; On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, the emblem &gt;&gt; of suffering &gt;&gt; and shame. The suffering you were taking, the suffering, the dying that you were going, YOUR YOUR MISERY THAT you were to take. Jesus took the misery, the suffering, the hurt, the pain, the heartache upon himself. &gt;&gt; So that we in turn can have life &gt;&gt; that we in turn can be can can live. Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now, I just want you to remember now, am I doing all right here this morning? I want you to remember our homeland is not here. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God. Amen. Sister Kaylee, the next time you're feeling all down and lonely and Amen. and rough and waking up on the wrong side of the bed and having a bad hair day and all of that all at one time. Hallelujah. Remember, this is not our homeland. &gt;&gt; This is not our homeland. [applause] I'm living in this world, but this is not my homeland. I I I I can Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, we get beat up. Oh, we get Oh my. But you see, God knew that we were going to be two naturatured. You're of Jesus. But the Apostle Paul says, "I'm willing in spirit, but my flesh, my flesh." In another place, the Apostle Paul says, "I die daily." What are you, are you with me? So there there there is that that is of an eternal. Brother Brandham says when when he was born again, he he become he had two natures. One of earth to die and one of heaven to live. We've got we WE KNOW WE SOMETIMES WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE in between. But I'm here to tell you IF THERE'S EVER A TIME FOR US TO MAKE THAT OUR EMBLEM, NOT OLD GLORY AND NOT OU AND NOT NOT OSU AND NOT WHATEVER THE BANNERS THEY WANT TO PUT UP AROUND. AMEN. SOME HALLELUJAH. I'M I I'VE SEEN A LOT OF EMBLEMS PUT up in a LOT OF BEDROOMS AS I'VE WORKED OVER THE YEARS, BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE GREATEST EMBLEM [screaming] YOU'LL EVER HAVE IS NOT SOMETHING OF MICHAEL JORDAN BACK WAY BACK 30 YEARS AGO. THE GREATEST EMBLEM YOU'LL EVER HAVE IS THE GREAT SON OF GOD THAT CAME AND HE WAS HE WAS ELEVATED [screaming] BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH FOR YOUR SHAME, YOUR SIN, YOUR SICKNESS. [applause] A right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. Now, Amen. You see our homeland. You say, "Now, Brother Window, can you give me some scripture?" Why, of course. Amen. They're in there in in in Galatians 4 and 26. And you can go and put these scriptures up keys. Thank you. Amen. For finding that. That's a beautiful picture. Galatians 4 and 26. But Jerusalem, which is above, is free, &gt;&gt; which is the mother of all God's predestinated seed. [laughter] It's free. &gt;&gt; You're living in America, but you're not free. Just just just go without paying your house taxes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just go without Yeah. It's not free. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there is a Jerusalem which is from above. Not earthly, not not not natural Jerusalem. There is a Jerusalem. And then he would say, "And it is the mother of us all. All God's elected. Can you say amen? Amen. He says, "Now, but ye are come." Amen. Uh uh there Hebrews 12:22, "Ye are come unto Mount Zion, unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn." Who's the firstborn? the inside. I will raise up an insign and the Gentiles shall Well, &gt;&gt; I hope y'all putting it all together. Hallelujah. Well, can you say amen? He says to the general assembly of the church of the firstborn, Jesus Christ, which are written in heaven, AND TO GOD THE JUDGE OF ALL, TO THE SPIRITS OF JUST men made perfect. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. which are written in heaven. When is your names written in heaven? The Bible says you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world. That's in Ephesians 1 and4. The Bible says there in Revelations uh uh the the 13th chapter that your name was written in the lamb's book OF LIFE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. He also says the same THING IN REVELATIONS THE 17TH CHAPTER. THERE IS AMEN RECOGNITION. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE'S names who are already in that land. You needed TO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE. YOU HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY [screaming] TO COME ON. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE SLAVES. YOU WERE BORN HERE. YOU WERE STILL YOU [screaming] WERE BORN IN SIN AND SHAPING IN INIQUITY. YOU HAD TO HAVE SOMETHING TO REPRESENT the land you came from. &gt;&gt; And that's why God in this last day didn't send a preacher, &gt;&gt; didn't send a pope, he sent a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that prophet come commissioned from the other land. &gt;&gt; He [laughter] he visited the other land. He come back AND SAID, "I SEEN y'all in THAT OTHER LAND." ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? THERE HAD TO be an emblem. When Satan tore down the emblem, he tore down Christ and he hid him in a dark tomb. And now it looked like all hope was gone. &gt;&gt; It looked like all Now the disciples are walking down the road to Emmas. We had hoped. We had hoped. We had hoped. But now he's dead. When it looked like it was dead, [clears throat] God says, "No, he has to die to carry your sins to Hades." Now you Now he's going to rise again as an everlasting symbol &gt;&gt; of life. &gt;&gt; That's it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Down through the church ages, we have we WENT THROUGH WHAT PENTECOST WAS, THE BOOK OF ACTS. That was that was God's emblem. &gt;&gt; God living in humanity. Then through the dark ages, denominations come in 3 325 AD. Here come amen the council of churches. And they begin to Amen. We don't believe in this. We don't believe in that. We they took no longer praying to the invisible God, living true to his word. Now they're putting up Peter and Mary and all of these others so you can bow down to a physical image, an idol, and worship. &gt;&gt; God would never &gt;&gt; never come back to an idol. Man is greater than any piece of brass, any piece of wood, any any car. Man would be greater than any metal. Are you hearing me now? God God would live in Jesus Christ. And then he would come pay the price for you and for me, wash away our sins, empower us, deputize us with the Holy Spirit from that land, and we would now become living monuments, living idols. we would become living, WALKING, TALKING. OH, COME ON [screaming] NOW. [applause] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ANOINTED WITH THIS. YOU'VE GOT THE SAME BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT JESUS HAD. [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; JESUS HAD IT WITHOUT MEASURE. YOU'VE GOT IT WITH MEASURE. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DID GOD WHAT DID SATAN DO? He got their attention going back to a to a to to to St. Mary to an image of Peter and Paul, an image of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; And what God's image was, God wanted to live in you. &gt;&gt; He would live in me. He would live in you. What can you say? Amen. &gt;&gt; He would live. He would live in us. He would live in humanity. It would be a representation that they're from another land. &gt;&gt; You'd be different. Now you're no longer in the prison cells. Now you're walking with a Now you're walking with a with a promise. You've got the very guarantee in your hand. The token, the emblem of eternal life is within you through the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Prophet would say it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection. It's a perfect place calling everyone of his sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; You thought and you accepted the message. It's the other way around. The message is accepting you. &gt;&gt; It's the message &gt;&gt; calling your name. &gt;&gt; It's the emblem saying, "I still live." Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you love him today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The blood of Jesus. Think of it. The dripping bloody word. The blood. The word of God bleeding. The blood to wash the bride in. Yes, sir. She stands perfect, virgin, unadulterated. She never sinned in the first place. You were just trapped. You were born in Satan's prison houses. But there is a soul that is a citizen. And the prophet would say she was trapped into it. See, there's the father's house that he's going to prepare. &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; As I begin to bring my thoughts to a finish here now, when God sends his word to us, he sent his word to heal. He sent his word to deliver. If you're homeland is not heaven, the word of the king means nothing to you. If the homeland is not that new Jerusalem, the words of the king You would trade that out for a denominational creed or you'd trade that out for well mama thinks and daddy thinks and I think &gt;&gt; because that message came to us all. &gt;&gt; It came to the world. &gt;&gt; But only the elect would hear it. &gt;&gt; Am I making sense? &gt;&gt; The prophet would say, "It's in the name of the Lord I say this." He get the Protestant church the same thing and she won't do it. The messages have shook everywhere and she won't do it. She's going to have her own dogmas and creeds. I don't care how much you explain it. &gt;&gt; But then on the other side, God's got an elect that is going to take that word &gt;&gt; and all hell is going to be against it. And yet that believer is invincible. &gt;&gt; The prophet would say Satan has tried to spray it like he did Eve. He tried to spray it, but he failed with his repellent on here. He was a predestinated seed. They couldn't take him in. They couldn't make him a Pharisee and a Sadducee. They couldn't make him belong to any organization. He was God's predestinated spoken word. And Satan could not throw his unbelief on him. He had a repellent on him. God, spray us with a repellent is my prayer. That's right. He says, "Then the spirit moved on him and sent him to Calvary to the CROSS TO BRING LIGHT IN THIS day and light to all the predestinated seeds to the church of this day, transforming sons and daughters of God into his presence." &gt;&gt; CAN I HEAR A GREAT BIG AMEN? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. We're going to a land. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I said we're going to a land. &gt;&gt; GOD SENDS US THESE THINGS. God sends us these things to us. Amen. For a reason. Oh, can you say amen? There was a chaplain one time that that was there that was a chaplain there in World War I. And when he had come home, he was telling a story to brother Brandham. And he he would he said that Sergeant had asked him one day to go with him out and and and and survey the the damage that was done on the on the on the battlefront. It it had been it was just it was just rough. There was they've been fighting with the gas and I mean everything was dead. Everything was dead. just um that it would it was it was it was a bad it was a bad time just and uh you know he he would when he went out you know he had even said they thrown that ma mustard gas and chlorine gas and it said just burnt all he said The leaves were off the trees, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There wasn't a living thing anywhere. &gt;&gt; And the soldiers were in such a a bad frame of mind. They'd been fighting and and it was just He says, "But on on on an Easter morning," he said, "I walked through the little the little area with the where the soldiers were at, where the wounded boys." [snorts] So I walked with a nurse and she was giving those wounded boys an American rose. You know one an American used he said them boys would grab the rose and would just start screaming and crying because they knew that it come from home. It was sent from home. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; The little rose, it would cling to it because it was an emblem &gt;&gt; from the homeland. &gt;&gt; Are y'all catching my thoughts here this morning? &gt;&gt; Do you realize that this message that we have received The message that we have received in this day is a rose &gt;&gt; from the homeland. It's a rose saying the king lives &gt;&gt; when he's reading the hearts. When God is coming in and giving visions, when God is opening up the mysteries of his word to us, when God, it's God's day. Here's a rose that never will wilt. &gt;&gt; What you're believing is genuine. What you're believing is real. Your fighting is not in vain. your warfare, your struggle. &gt;&gt; It'll soon be over. Fight the fight. &gt;&gt; KEEP YOUR WEAPON IN YOUR HAND. The king is going to reward you someday. You have served the king and we've had communion with one another before and we've we've we love communion times. Usually the pastor will serve communion. We work hard to get the wine and sister Leah makes the bread and we It's wonderful time. But on that day, he ain't going to be asking you to make bread. And he ain't going to be having the deacons to get the wine. And there's not going to be servants. The Bible says the king himself, &gt;&gt; Kevin, the king himself will set you down &gt;&gt; and will serve you. &gt;&gt; The king &gt;&gt; while the rest of the world is looking at this gospel as if it's a myth. And you how do we know that they think it's a myth? because they don't they don't they have changed anything they wanted to change out of here. &gt;&gt; They don't believe this Bible is true. &gt;&gt; If they did, they live by &gt;&gt; women would look like Bible women. &gt;&gt; Men would look like Bible men. &gt;&gt; Preachers would preach like Bible preachers. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The church would be a Bible church. &gt;&gt; But they've ripped out. Say they don't. It's just it's just Christianity has become no better than Buddha Buddhaism or &gt;&gt; whatever. It's just I don't know why belong to a dead philosophy. &gt;&gt; But Jesus is coming this day to declare that he lives that he does know your heart. &gt;&gt; That he does know your cries. He stood up service after service, city after city, nation after nation, declaring over and over, I know your name. I know your address. I know your heart. I know where you come. It was God's rose. It was the voice of the king. It was a servant from the king running with a banner saying, "He lives." &gt;&gt; It was a It was Oh, if I had a flag, hallelujah. [laughter] It was It was A MESSENGER, OUR PROPHET MESSENGER RUNNING WITH THE BANNER. THE [screaming] KING LIVES. &gt;&gt; He lives. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED. DON'T DON'T FALL. DON'T FALL SHORT.

He's not waiting to see if you hold out to the end. &gt;&gt; He [snorts] knows you're one of his. and he's going to see to it that you hold out to the end. He's going to bring you home. &gt;&gt; Do we have any elders that are a little bit weary? Maybe you're some elders weary. You got some aches and pains. Oh, just hang on, elders. We're almost home. &gt;&gt; Any of you mamas that get really discouraged? You just you just feel like you're about to fall apart. Maybe your hormones are just going crazy. Hallelujah. Amen.

Grass gone, trees gone. It was just a in the war zone and and and but there was no sign of life. No sign of it was just destruction everywhere.

VICTORY. [music] &gt;&gt; My savior. [singing] &gt;&gt; He sought me. &gt;&gt; HE BOUGHT ME. [music] OH YEAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; OH, he loved me. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I knew him and all my love. [music] He love you. He did not die to make us feel good in our minds and [music] we're thankful for that. But [snorts] I hope this message never [music] becomes one of those I don't want to I don't want this message ever swinging [music] over into that self-improvement &gt;&gt; that think good of yourself and inside you is good. You're as worthless as worthless can be. And there ain't none of you that's any higher than that. &gt;&gt; We're all worthless. &gt;&gt; In this flesh, there [music] is nothing good. &gt;&gt; So, we don't need no [music] self-improvement. We needed salvation. &gt;&gt; And Jesus came [music] to redeem us. And that soul within this worthless being is worth [music] 10,000 of these human worlds. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; All the money, all the wealth, all the faith. Put put 10,000 of those worlds. Put 10,000 of these globes together &gt;&gt; and it might start comparing to one soul. So Jesus came [music] not to make life easy. There's nothing in this life that is that's eternal. But what makes life easy is having this wonder inside. Brother Michael that is saying you come from another land. Then when you're going [music] when you're hurting, when you're sick like dad, sick like sisterhu Angie. Amen. When you're sick [music] like some some of these others, you may be fighting. Don't matter. We're going to believe God. &gt;&gt; God's going to bring us out. &gt;&gt; But God never did promise that we're going to live forever here in this mortal [music] world. I'm glad that there's coming a day when oh glory is going to burn. &gt;&gt; You say, "I thought you was patriotic." My patriotism goes beyond this world &gt;&gt; to that other kingdom. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I'm about my father's business. I come from my father and I'm going back to my father and [music] I'm coming here for a limited time to get all of these earthly get get all these eternal beings out of their earthly thoughts." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, victory in Jesus my savior forever. &gt;&gt; Forever. &gt;&gt; He sought me. He come to look for me, brother Wall-E. And he bought me with his redeeming [singing] blood. He loved me. [singing] I knew him. &gt;&gt; In other words, he loved me before [music] I knew him. Air before. He plunged me to victory his cleansing. Well, glory to God. Well, I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Well, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Hallelujah. One of them. I'm one of them. Oh, I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them. Well, there are people [music] almost everywhere with hearts on A FLAME. WITH THE POWER THAT FELL AT Pentecost and made them clean, it is burning now within my heart. Oh, glory to his name. I'm so glad I can say WELL [screaming] I'M one of them. I'm one of them. Why can't you sing it with conviction that that I can say hallelujah? ONE OF THEM. I'M ONE OF THEM. WELL, I'M so glad that I can say [music] I'm one of them. Let's sing another verse of that. Well, though these people may not learn it, nor boast the worldly flame, they have all received their Pentecost, baptized in his name, [music] and are telling now both far and wide his POWER IS YET. WELL, [screaming] I'M SO glad [music] [singing] I want you to reach over to your neighbor. Say, I'm one of them. I'm one of them. So glad. Well, I'm so glad. I can say I'm one of them. Hallelujah. [music] I'm one of them. One of them. Well, I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them. Well, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one. Oh, let's sing that LAST PART AGAIN. YES, I'M SO GLAD I can say [music] I'm one of them. [singing] Hallelujah. [applause] [music] Hallelujah. WELL, HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Glory to God. Are you thankful tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. [music] And I love you. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. I love you.

[music and singing] Glory to God. my soul and he loves you. as we leave to go eat. May this day that we have [music] sort of just set aside, we usually set aside a Sunday dedicated for a a Thanksgiving meal and a to reminisce [music] on God's goodness to us. As you're sitting there eating today, first of all, we say [music] thank you to all of you who made the meal wonderful. But that man or woman that you're sitting across from, how blessed we [music] are to have citizens, fellow citizens from that country sitting beside you, across from you. So good to have [music] fellow citizens, men and women of the same f precious faith, the same father. Here we are all sitting, [music] feasting around the spiritual table and speeching and around the natural table together. Let's [music] embrace each other like we've never done before because each of us hold the word of promise. Don't let any odds be between any of us. And if there is some monster, we we we've got to we can't hang on [music] to those things. Let's not allow anything. Make sure make sure that [music] we're all going to be there on that day. Only perfect love is going to enter there. Help us Lord. God bless you today. We thank the Lord for his goodness. Let's bow our heads. Father, we ask Lord that your Holy Spirit that we feel here in a wonderful way this morning would so [music] go with us, Lord, throughout the day and throughout our week as we begin to counter [music] blessings. Maybe this year, Lord, the theme isn't around a health and prosperity, which we are very [music] thankful for all of that. And we definitely don't want to downplay that as if it means nothing. But Lord, we're looking at our souls and that was lost and how good you've been to us [music] in our generation. [snorts] to send us an emblem from home, the homeland, and let us know that you're very much alive after 2,000 years. The Son of Man [music] is still at work in our lives. We thank you for that. We thank you for brotherhood. Thank you Lord for all of what it means to have friends [music] be a part of the family of God. We ask Lord that if we've been a little bit rough around the edges that you would help us to take our [music] hiss of our common faith and dip it into your blood and scrub out all the stains and all of the ilk that we have allowed crust over our hearts. Take every stain [snorts] away from us. Let there be a genuine love for you, [music] a genuine love for the brothers and sisters. We thank you for it, Father. And Lord, [music] I ask that you would move, bless the meal, bless those who have provided it. Lord, ask Lord that you would [music] cause the milk that the mill to be strength to our bodies, strength for our souls and and we'll give you glory and honor till we come back tonight. [music] Lord, just keep your hands upon us in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. As we prepare to dismiss, we would like any songs that you might have this evening of thanksgiving [music] testimonies. Think back. Think deep. [music] Think back what God's done for you and where he's brought your soul. If you have a few of those things. [music] And I've asked brother [music] Harry to to talk to us uh a little bit this evening on about Thanksgiving and not going to be a full-blown sermon, [music] but a and we're just going to have I believe it's going to be a wonderful evening. I I want us to go down deep now. Dog gone. I was a Pentecostal boy. I had seen miracle of every kind by the age of 16. I had witnessed dead raised, blind eyes open, deaf ears unstopped. I believe I'd witnessed cancers. I'd seen all of that. But this boy was in such a [music] confused state. But this message came and given me a clarity. [music] It's become it's become my rock. I've seen many more healings and miracles since that time. But this is my rock. this message. We say God bless you. We let you dismiss yourselves, reverence, fear of the Lord. And um you know, I think we'll just have brother that way I can shake your hands on the way out. Amen. So we'll let we'll let you dismiss there, brother Harry. God bless you. Amen. You're the [music] [music] I love you. Yes. [music]
