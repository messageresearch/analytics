[33:24] truth for the day in which you live
[33:26] somebody say the re deceiving now
[33:29] remember we we just read uh uh I believe
[33:32] it was two Wednesday nights ago where it
[33:36] says only a special class amen can hear
[33:40] he that hath an ear brother brandom says
[33:43] that is a spiritual ear that is only
[33:46] given to the elect others it just can't
[33:49] they cannot hear it and so um and so
[33:53] here it is receiving amen we we don't
[33:56] want to just be hear we want to receive
[33:59] that word so that it can have an effect
[34:01] in our lives it says so it's the
[34:03] receiving of the word of the truth in
[34:05] which you live Jesus never did stress
[34:09] the importance of the works as he did
[34:12] the word he knew that if the people got
[34:15] the word The Works would follow that is
[34:18] Bible now Jesus knew there was going to
[34:22] be a terrible drift away from the word
[34:25] in per uh pergan 8 age which was as yet
[34:30] 200 years off from the Pat's
[34:32] Vision he knew that drift would cause
[34:36] them to go into the Dark Ages he knew
[34:40] that the way man originally got away
[34:42] from God was by leaving the word if you
[34:45] leave the word you've left God thus he
[34:50] is presenting himself to the church at
[34:52] pergamus and indeed to all churches of
[34:55] all ages I am the word
[34:58] if you want deity in your midst then
[35:02] welcome and receive there's a difference
[35:04] in welcoming and receiving we got to
[35:07] welcome but then receiving is bringing
[35:10] it on down for myself it's one thing to
[35:13] say hello and another thing to receive
[35:15] you into my home amen so so we we don't
[35:20] want to say amen and and then the word
[35:24] still being separate we want that word
[35:27] becoming one with us that's the only way
[35:30] that the word of this generation will
[35:32] have any effect in our lives amen so if
[35:35] you want deity in your midst then you
[35:36] welcome and receive the word don't ever
[35:40] let anyone get in between you and that
[35:42] word that which I am giving you the word
[35:45] is a revelation of myself I am the word
[35:49] remember that yeah I wonder if we are
[35:52] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[35:54] our midst let me give you a thought here
[35:56] how do we pray we pray in jesus' name
[35:59] don't we we every prayer is in his name
[36:02] or there isn't any answer yet in first
[36:05] John 5:14 we are told this is the
[36:07] confidence that we have in him that if
[36:10] we ask anything according to his will he
[36:13] heareth us and if we know that he hear
[36:16] us whatsoever we ask we know we have the
[36:20] petitions that we desired of him now we
[36:23] ask what is the will of God there is
[36:25] only one way to know his will
[36:28] and that is by the word of God
[36:30] Lamentations 3:37 who is he that saith
[36:34] and it cometh uh and it cometh to pass
[36:36] when the Lord commandeth it not there it
[36:38] is if it isn't the word you can't have
[36:42] it so we can't ask unless it's in the
[36:44] word we can't petition or ask unless
[36:46] it's in his name there it is again Jesus
[36:49] the name is the word will you can't
[36:52] separate God and the word they are one
[36:54] now then this word he has left behind
[36:57] the printed page is part of him when you
[37:00] accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled
[37:03] life he said that his word was life John
[37:06] 3 or 6 uh
[37:08] 663b but that is exactly what he is John
[37:13] 146 I am the way the truth and the life
[37:17] Romans 8 and9 be if any man have not the
[37:20] spirit of Christ he is none of his there
[37:22] it is he is the spirit and he is life
[37:25] that is exactly what the word is that is
[37:28] exactly what Jesus is he is the word so
[37:30] when a spirit born spirit filled man in
[37:35] faith takes that word into his heart and
[37:38] places it upon his lips why that is the
[37:41] same as deity speaking Every Mountain
[37:45] has to go Satan cannot stand before that
[37:49] man can someone shout hallelujah
[37:53] hallelujah if the church way back there
[37:55] in that third age had only held on to
[37:58] the revelation of the Living Word you've
[38:00] heard me mention that many of times uh
[38:02] since we've been reading Living Word the
[38:05] logos not a letter living the spirit of
[38:09] the Bible Living Word in their midst the
[38:12] power of God would not have faded as it
[38:15] did in those Church ages and right today
[38:18] when the church returns to the word in
[38:21] faith we can say without doubt that the
[38:24] glory of God and the wonderful Acts of
[38:27] God will be in her midst again one night
[38:30] I was seeking the Lord and the Holy
[38:32] Spirit told me to pick up my pen and
[38:35] write and I grasped the pen to write and
[38:38] his Spirit gave me a message for the
[38:40] church and I want to bring it to you it
[38:42] has to do with the word and the bride
[38:44] somebody say has to do with the
[38:47] word word and the bride now don't let
[38:51] that for don't don't put the word
[38:54] separate from
[38:56] you youen man that's the reason we had
[38:59] to have this word brought to us it's a
[39:02] uniting time we are in a marriage we
[39:05] have we are no longer courting we're no
[39:07] longer dating we are no longer amen the
[39:11] boyfriend in one house the girlfriend in
[39:13] another house the bride and the word has
[39:17] United together we are married we are
[39:20] producing children word children we're
[39:23] going to produce a Rapture and it's
[39:25] going to because be because of the Union
[39:28] between the bride and the word that's
[39:31] how we're going to produce these new
[39:33] bodies amen amen so here is what I'm I
[39:38] I'm trying to say to you the law of
[39:42] reproduction is that each
[39:44] species uh brings forth after its own
[39:46] kind even according to Genesis 1:11 and
[39:50] God said let the Earth bring forth grass
[39:52] and the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[39:54] tree uh yielding fruit after its whose
[39:57] seed is in itself upon the Earth and it
[40:00] was so and whatever life was in the seed
[40:03] came forth into a plant and then into
[40:06] the fruit the very same law applies to
[40:11] the church today whatever seed started
[40:14] the church will come forth and be like
[40:18] the Original Seed because it is the same
[40:21] seed in these last days the true bride
[40:25] Church Christ seed will come to The
[40:28] Headstone she will be a super Church a
[40:31] super race as she nears him they in the
[40:35] bride will be so much like him they will
[40:38] be e they will even be in his very image
[40:41] this is in order to be United with him
[40:44] they will be one they will be the very
[40:46] manifestation of the word of the Living
[40:49] God oh Hallelujah denominations cannot
[40:52] produce this it's the wrong seed they
[40:54] will produce their Creeds and their
[40:56] dogmas and mix with the word this
[40:59] monging brings forth a hybrid product
[41:02] the first son Adam was the spoken seed
[41:05] word of God he was given a bride to
[41:09] reproduce himself and that's why the
[41:13] bride was given to him to reproduce
[41:16] himself to produce another Son of God
[41:20] she fell she fell by hybridization she
[41:23] caused him to Die the second son Jesus
[41:26] also a spoken seed word of God was given
[41:29] a bride like as was Adam but before he
[41:33] could marry her she also had fallen she
[41:37] like Adam's wife was put to the test
[41:41] whether she would believe the word of
[41:42] God and live or doubt and die now live
[41:48] believe and live or doubt and die she
[41:53] doubted she left the word she died from
[41:57] a little group of the true seed of the
[42:01] word God will somebody say God will
[42:06] present Christ with a beloved bride she
[42:09] is a virgin of his word she is a virgin
[42:12] because she knows no man-made Creeds or
[42:14] dogmas by and through the members of the
[42:17] Bride will be fulfilled all that was
[42:21] promised of God to be made manifest in
[42:23] the Virgin The Word of Promise came to
[42:27] the Virgin Mary but the Word of Promise
[42:30] was he himself to be made manifest God
[42:36] was made manifest he himself acted at
[42:40] that time and fulfilled his own Word of
[42:42] Promise in the
[42:44] Virgin it was an angel that had brought
[42:47] the uh her the message but the Angel's
[42:49] message was the word of God Isaiah 9
[42:52] and6 he fulfilled at that time all that
[42:56] was written of him because she accepted
[42:59] his word to her oh accepted his word to
[43:05] her the members of the Virgin bride will
[43:08] love him they will have his potentials
[43:11] for he is their head and all power
[43:14] belongs to him they are subject to him
[43:17] as the members of our bodies are subject
[43:20] to our heads notice the harmony of the
[43:24] father and son Jesus never did anything
[43:26] until till it was first showed him by
[43:29] the Father John
[43:31] 5:9 this harmony is now to exist between
[43:36] the groom and his bride he shows her his
[43:39] Word of Life she receives it she never
[43:42] doubts it therefore nothing can harm her
[43:47] not even death for if the seed be
[43:49] planted the water will raise it up again
[43:51] and here is the secret of this the word
[43:54] is in the bride as it was in Mary the
[43:57] bride has the mind of Christ for she
[44:00] knows what she wants what he wants done
[44:03] with the word she performs the command
[44:06] of the word in his name for she has thus
[44:09] saith the Lord then the word is
[44:11] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[44:13] pass like a seed that is planted and
[44:16] watered it comes to full Harvest serving
[44:19] its purpose those in the bride do only
[44:22] his will no one can make them do
[44:25] otherwise they have thus sayeth the Lord
[44:28] or they keep still they know that it has
[44:32] to be God in them doing the works
[44:35] fulfilling his own word he did not
[44:38] complete all his work while he was here
[44:41] in his Earthly
[44:43] Ministry uh so now he works in and
[44:45] through the bride she knows that for it
[44:49] was not yet time for him to do certain
[44:51] things that he must now do but he will
[44:54] now fulfill through the bride the work
[44:58] which he left for this specific time now
[45:02] how is this word going how is this bride
[45:07] going to fulfill it's got to be God's
[45:11] word in
[45:13] her
[45:15] manifesting in other words she becomes
[45:19] impregnated with that word amen now it
[45:22] was God him Jesus said you know the
[45:24] apost or brother Brandon was just saying
[45:26] it was God
[45:28] himself in Mary amen it was an angel
[45:31] that spoke it but he took the words of
[45:34] Isaiah 9:6 and placed them in the wombs
[45:39] of her mind and it dropped down into her
[45:42] heart not into her womb it would drop
[45:45] down into the womb of her mind and it
[45:48] came on down into her heart she accepted
[45:51] it and then God's creative word produced
[45:54] Jesus
[45:55] Christ can you say Amen now now there's
[45:59] got to be and I want to I I want to deal
[46:02] uh uh a few moments tonight we don't
[46:05] want that word to be circling this room
[46:08] tonight amen these the the words of God
[46:11] the words of that Prophet are circling
[46:12] the globe I don't want it to just be
[46:14] circling the globe I want to be a
[46:17] receptor to where that's that comes
[46:19] right down into my heart I want to see
[46:22] the Supernatural and the only way that
[46:25] I'm going to see the supernatural in me
[46:28] is for me to grab that and bring it down
[46:31] into my heart now Brothers there's only
[46:33] one way that you're going to do that it
[46:35] comes through the Mind
[46:40] first it comes through this mind here
[46:42] and there's where too many of us miss it
[46:46] this is why we miss our healing this is
[46:49] why we miss our Miracles is because when
[46:52] the healing presence of God is here we
[46:56] we accept other things in our mind and
[47:00] we marilize the word of God instead of
[47:04] saying I don't care what the doctor says
[47:06] I don't care what I feel I don't care
[47:09] what situation let me let me let me tell
[47:11] you friends amen if we're going to see
[47:14] the supernatural it's got to come out of
[47:16] here in here and down
[47:20] here and if we shut this off amen and if
[47:24] you have uh I I would encourage everyone
[47:26] to go back there amen and listen and and
[47:29] and listen to that uh the greatest
[47:31] battle ever fought and don't just try to
[47:33] listen to it all in one day but I I'm I
[47:36] I am saying listen to 30 minutes of it
[47:39] one day and then go and and and if
[47:41] you've got to go back and listen to that
[47:43] 30 minutes uh uh two or three days go
[47:45] back and listen to that amen and then
[47:47] when you do start start 15 minutes into
[47:50] the sermon and go another 30 minutes and
[47:53] and and just dissect that again and then
[47:56] and then start the I just it's going to
[47:58] be it it'll take you about as long as it
[47:59] is to do this church age book hallelujah
[48:01] amen but I want you to catch because
[48:05] brother Bram was in a he was in a rim
[48:09] when he was dealing with this it is a
[48:12] prophet telling you how he operates in
[48:16] that Supernatural real it was a prophet
[48:19] telling us sometimes we we we're wanting
[48:22] something real big and and big old huge
[48:25] thing to come but but he's letting us
[48:27] know that you've got to receive it right
[48:31] here right here and this is the carnal
[48:33] part of you amen this right here is the
[48:36] carinal part where you refuse well I
[48:38] don't feel good you're either going to
[48:40] have to refuse it or accept
[48:43] it you you're well well my children are
[48:46] you know are are lost you're either
[48:48] going to have to refuse it or accept it
[48:51] you're going to have to take God's word
[48:53] in every situation if we want to see the
[48:57] Supernatural how many wants to see the
[48:58] supernatural the only way it's going to
[49:01] happen is for the supernatural to get
[49:03] from here from here to here to
[49:07] here now I in the greatest battle I'm
[49:10] just going to read a little bit to you
[49:12] here it says one night what drew me to
[49:15] this conclusion here I was standing with
[49:17] brother wood and brother sofman and it
[49:19] was about 10:00 at night and I was
[49:21] looking towards the skies and and and
[49:24] and a great a came over me and I said
[49:25] just look all the great Heavenly Host I
[49:28] said everything is perfectly in harmony
[49:31] brother wood said looking at at at the
[49:34] two little stars so close together it
[49:36] made it look like a light and I said oh
[49:38] you know brother but brother wood
[49:40] according to science in that Dipper the
[49:43] Little Dipper and the Big Dipper those
[49:45] Stars don't look over 2 inches apart and
[49:48] they are farther away from each other
[49:49] than we are from them and if it would
[49:52] start towards to the Earth it would take
[49:54] at 1,000 M an hour it would take hundred
[49:56] and hundreds of years for them to reach
[49:58] the Earth and I said in all this great
[50:00] vast system yet they tell us that they
[50:02] look through the glasses can see 120
[50:05] million years of light time away from
[50:07] there and there are still Moons and
[50:09] stars yet God made every one of them he
[50:12] sets in the midst of them and I said
[50:13] somewhere in there I I had pointed out
[50:16] to me one time in the obervatory the
[50:18] Zodiac beginning with the Virgin coming
[50:20] down through the cancer age on down uh
[50:22] until the last was the lion Leo the Lion
[50:25] the first coming of Christ by the Virgin
[50:27] the second coming of the Christ by the
[50:29] lion of the tribe of Judah I said I've
[50:31] tried my best to see the Zodiac but I
[50:33] can't see it but it's yet it's there and
[50:35] those who are trained can see it job saw
[50:38] it men who used to look it it it was a
[50:40] Bible at one day but in that whole great
[50:43] mass of millions and billions of light
[50:45] years God sits in the midst of it all
[50:47] and he looks down Paul is in there my
[50:49] mother's in there somewhere looking
[50:52] down I I thought of the order of of the
[50:55] heavenly host and how that none of them
[50:56] is out of place and every one of them
[50:58] keeps its time perfectly God's Great
[51:00] Army I thought of the soldiers how that
[51:03] if the moon would ever would happen to
[51:05] get out of order the Earth would be
[51:06] covered again with water in just a few
[51:08] minutes the Earth would be just as it
[51:10] was when God decided to use it to have
[51:12] us here on with uh without form and void
[51:16] and darkness and water up on the face of
[51:18] the Earth and and if that Moon would
[51:19] ever move it would do the same thing
[51:21] again rocks the moon rocks a little bit
[51:24] back from the earth and the tides come
[51:26] up when it goes down it it just follows
[51:28] the tithe it's God's Great Army and when
[51:30] I thought about this being God's Great
[51:32] Army we went to bed and I began to think
[51:35] that one that that not one of those get
[51:38] out of order they're all set in place
[51:40] and if there's a moving anywhere it's
[51:42] for a cause and will affect the earth I
[51:44] I I we we just see the results of it now
[51:47] for some of them moving into another
[51:49] spot and it's a fact and it's effect on
[51:51] everything and I thought then if that
[51:54] great Heavenly Host like like that has
[51:57] to keep its place to make everything in
[51:59] order how about the disorder of the
[52:01] Earthly
[52:02] host how when one gets out of order how
[52:05] it throws the whole things out of cater
[52:07] the whole program of God is upset when
[52:09] one member gets out of order we should
[52:11] con uh should continually strive to keep
[52:13] the order of the spirit I I would to God
[52:16] this morning that we could bring this
[52:18] down to a real healing service that we
[52:20] could keep this part this group that
[52:22] that we have gathered under the roof
[52:24] this morning in such a Harmony that the
[52:26] whole the Holy Spirit would place every
[52:28] member of the body here in such a
[52:30] Harmony till it would be such a
[52:32] spontaneous healing of soul and body if
[52:35] we'll just hold our positions now as I
[52:37] said the in the beginning this lady who
[52:40] had the cancer Dr Dr HRI was was going
[52:42] to take off that God the the god that
[52:46] caused the fluttering noise to come into
[52:47] the clinic and took this cancer without
[52:49] even leaving a scar don't you know the
[52:52] same Gods here the only thing he's
[52:54] waiting for is his arm Army to get to
[52:57] position like the stars to get to your
[53:01] position can you say Amen now brother
[53:04] brandham would say the church can never
[53:07] progress until it knows what grounds
[53:09] it's progressing on and to me this is
[53:11] what this church age book is so
[53:13] incredible
[53:15] for and and and the revelations of the
[53:17] Mysteries he says I believe that before
[53:19] anyone can ever move or have a real
[53:21] confidential Faith it's first they have
[53:24] to know where they stand
[53:27] and how to stand if they're going to
[53:29] make their stand I believe that's
[53:32] essential you cannot just uh uh you
[53:35] cannot just headlong plunge into
[53:38] something with faith when you don't know
[53:40] where you're plunging you've got to know
[53:43] if our faith is set right and in the
[53:46] right position it gives a constant
[53:50] satisfaction can you say Amen
[53:53] now as we as I was as I was reading the
[53:56] other night the last maybe it was the
[53:58] last service and I was and and and the
[54:01] Holy Spirit just settled down on that on
[54:03] that spot right when we we were reading
[54:06] that where brother where brother Brandon
[54:08] was saying you've got to make it yours
[54:11] you've got to believe it and receive it
[54:14] he says believing it is not enough
[54:17] receiving it well that that that that
[54:20] that done something to me I felt the
[54:22] Holy Spirit just settled down in the in
[54:24] the building and and you all noticed
[54:26] that too you could feel just a a real a
[54:28] real settl of the spirit of the Lord
[54:30] come down and and so as I've went back I
[54:35] it it it's it's really uh uh come to my
[54:37] mind and in my spirit and and I I I
[54:41] thought now how can we go from just amen
[54:44] believing it to receiving it and as I
[54:48] begin to look as some of y'all read on
[54:51] your quotes today Amen on the Mind
[54:55] brother brandham says it starts with the
[54:58] mind your mind has got to be as a man
[55:01] thinketh in his heart so is he the mind
[55:05] has to open it up in order for that word
[55:07] to become faith in the in in in and I'm
[55:10] going to be quoting a bunch from the the
[55:12] greatest battle ever
[55:13] fought he says now there's where the
[55:16] battle begins right in the mind now
[55:18] remember it's not Christian Science Now
[55:20] mind over Miner the mind accepts the
[55:24] life which is the word of God and there
[55:27] brings the life just your thought
[55:30] doesn't do it but the word of God
[55:32] brought through the channel of your
[55:36] thought so taking that word and
[55:39] meditating upon it he says he says now
[55:43] just your thought doesn't do it but the
[55:45] word of God brought through the channel
[55:46] of your mind it's not it's not the
[55:48] thought as Christian Science makes it
[55:50] mind over matter no that isn't it your
[55:54] mind accepts it and grasps it now what
[55:58] what is your mind controlled by your
[56:01] spirit or if he meant your soul and your
[56:05] soul catches the word of God and that's
[56:09] the thing that's got life in it it
[56:11] brings life into you so your soul is the
[56:17] one that dominates your soul is the is
[56:19] the one that has the New Birth your soul
[56:22] is created in the image of God your
[56:24] spirit man is simply the nature of your
[56:27] body but that Spirit mind is your mind
[56:31] that's the one that's in between the
[56:32] body and the Soul it's the in between
[56:35] world it's what has to come in through
[56:37] here in order to get down to the
[56:41] soul so when you now whatever that
[56:44] desire is amen if you're a sinner you do
[56:48] your your your your mind is is roaming
[56:51] on girls pornography uh alcohol this
[56:55] that it is it is it is bringing other
[56:57] things through the filter of of your
[57:00] mind down into your soul to be satisfied
[57:03] when you're born again amen there is a
[57:06] cry for the supernatural there is a cry
[57:10] to overcome there is a cry to be what
[57:14] God created you to be Therefore your
[57:19] mind begins to reach out for those
[57:22] things you're you're now looking at the
[57:24] scripture and you're listening to the
[57:26] messages and you're you're coming to
[57:28] church and that mind is is your your
[57:31] your soul is bringing everything through
[57:34] the filter of your mind and you're now
[57:37] accepting truth and rejecting doubt
[57:41] you're now accepting healing and
[57:43] rejecting doctor's reports you are now
[57:46] you you see what I'm saying because your
[57:48] soul is is that is in the image of God
[57:53] is
[57:54] longing amen to express itself and the
[57:59] only way you can do that is bringing
[58:01] your mind under that control and brother
[58:03] brandham says those right thoughts will
[58:05] eventually bring your body right in line
[58:08] with
[58:09] it can you say Amen now he says it
[58:12] brings it in he says oh brother then
[58:14] what what takes place when life comes
[58:17] into uh down that channel into you the
[58:21] word of God is Manifest in you if you
[58:24] abide in me my words abide in you then
[58:27] you shall ask what you will and it will
[58:29] be done then what does that do from the
[58:32] middle of the heart amen and the so
[58:34] there it goes forth feeding every
[58:36] channel the trouble of it is we're
[58:38] standing in here with a lot of Doubt
[58:41] trying to accept what is out there
[58:43] you've got to stop that come down that
[58:46] Channel with the true word of God and
[58:48] then it goes out itself automatically
[58:51] it's what's on the inside that's the
[58:53] thing that counts is the inside can you
[58:56] say Amen now now he would say now he
[59:00] said well I don't steal or drink or
[59:02] don't do those kinds of things he said
[59:04] that has nothing to do with it amen
[59:06] there's got to be that hunger down on
[59:08] the inside
[59:10] now so I I want to deal with our mind
[59:13] for just a minute and this is where we
[59:14] miss it many times and I I just want to
[59:16] because I'm I'm not going to keep you
[59:17] long
[59:18] tonight but I want you to catch I want I
[59:20] want that word I want listen Malachi 4
[59:25] is to bring us back to that word it's to
[59:28] rebuild the stones that were taken
[59:31] down amen but what good is the stones to
[59:34] be
[59:35] rebuilt if we're not worshiping at those
[59:38] stones if we're not worshiping at that
[59:40] altar revealed word has come we've got
[59:44] to make that revealed word ours now and
[59:48] the way it happens
[59:50] it's we we we miss it brother randam
[59:53] says when they when they applied the
[59:54] blood he says you were to take now this
[59:57] was an incredible thing this was the
[59:59] this was the time of The Exodus this was
[1:00:01] the time where Egypt where Egypt was
[1:00:03] fixing to lose their Hol as taskmasters
[1:00:04] were fixing to die this was this is the
[1:00:07] time that the first that the death angel
[1:00:08] was coming and and God says I want you
[1:00:10] to slay the lamb and I want you to apply
[1:00:12] the blood and he says I want you to take
[1:00:15] hup brother Bram says hup was just a
[1:00:19] common
[1:00:20] weed yes if was a weed you went out in
[1:00:23] the front yard and you plucked it up an
[1:00:25] old common
[1:00:26] weed and you took the blood of that
[1:00:29] precious lamb and you applied it over
[1:00:31] the doorpost and the Lin of the
[1:00:35] door your mind is an everyday
[1:00:40] thing but your mind is important it's
[1:00:44] what God is using to get down into your
[1:00:47] heart right when you're listening to
[1:00:49] those tapes if you ain't got your mind
[1:00:52] into those tapes those tapes do you no
[1:00:54] good right
[1:00:57] right if you're reading and you're just
[1:01:00] trying to read the Bible in a year and
[1:01:03] you're not really comprehending it's not
[1:01:06] coming it's just it's it's it's shutting
[1:01:08] off it's not getting down to here it's
[1:01:11] got to come through this mind and I'm
[1:01:15] going to give you a bunch of quotes on
[1:01:16] this all right and if you want to write
[1:01:18] some of them down I think they're I
[1:01:19] think they're powerful I sent some of
[1:01:20] them to y'all today amen he says the
[1:01:23] biggest part of our faith is mental
[1:01:27] Faith H by hearing the word it brings us
[1:01:32] to a mental recognition of the word but
[1:01:36] if this coming from above oh brother if
[1:01:38] it ever strikes this there is a Godly
[1:01:42] spiritual Faith then what does that
[1:01:45] Faith do that Faith recognizes only the
[1:01:48] word but he says it starts here
[1:01:52] hallelujah you know want to know what
[1:01:54] are the battles that fought
[1:01:56] I believe in healing and then tomorrow
[1:01:58] morning when you don't get when when you
[1:01:59] don't feel
[1:02:02] good or when things go you and all of a
[1:02:05] sudden you you're just your mind is just
[1:02:07] going this way and that way and no no no
[1:02:09] no no no no no either you believe this
[1:02:11] word or you
[1:02:12] don't and that word is either going to
[1:02:15] be the door brother brandom says you're
[1:02:17] either going to accept or reject
[1:02:21] whatever down into your heart can you
[1:02:23] say Amen another place he say say and
[1:02:26] when the word itself is pouring into our
[1:02:28] faith our mental Faith becomes a
[1:02:31] spiritual Revelation upon this
[1:02:34] Foundation I'll build my church see not
[1:02:37] upon the mental conception of church
[1:02:39] joining a mental conception of that but
[1:02:41] upon the Revelation amen another place
[1:02:44] he says number one coming to you your
[1:02:46] mental Faith right here comes the Holy
[1:02:49] Spirit coming down into your mental
[1:02:51] Faith making it a spiritual Faith the
[1:02:55] spir spiritual Faith then only
[1:02:58] recognizes the word now you can
[1:03:02] understand why the Apostle Peter there
[1:03:03] in First Peter 1 and 13 wherefore gird
[1:03:07] up the loins of your
[1:03:11] mind GT up don't let just anything come
[1:03:15] through your mind because it's going to
[1:03:18] affect God's word in you amen uh uh
[1:03:23] Proverbs 12:5 the thoughts of the right
[1:03:26] of the righteous are right there in
[1:03:28] Philippians 4 and 6 be careful for
[1:03:30] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[1:03:32] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:03:34] requests be made known unto God the
[1:03:36] peace of God which passes all
[1:03:38] understanding should keep your hearts
[1:03:39] and Minds through Christ Jesus finally
[1:03:41] my brethren whatsoever things are true
[1:03:43] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:03:45] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:03:47] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:03:49] whatsoever things are good report if
[1:03:50] there be any virtue if there be any
[1:03:53] praise think on these
[1:03:56] things praise the Lord that's amen Still
[1:04:01] Still quoting from the greatest battle
[1:04:02] ever fought he says that word if you can
[1:04:05] ever get everything out of the way all
[1:04:07] of the conscience all senses and just
[1:04:10] let the word come in the word will
[1:04:12] produce just exactly here see what's
[1:04:15] covered o over with see uh see what it's
[1:04:18] covered over with it says well these
[1:04:22] consciences thoughts uh senses the
[1:04:26] so forth don't don't have anything to do
[1:04:28] with it brother brandom certainly it
[1:04:30] does now now once again amen now want
[1:04:33] you to read there I'm stuttering a
[1:04:34] little bit and now let me let me see if
[1:04:36] I can get it better the well these
[1:04:38] conscience which is thoughts and senses
[1:04:41] and so forth don't have anything to do
[1:04:44] with it brother brandom I believe I
[1:04:46] believe the Bible I believe the word
[1:04:47] that don't matter he says certainly it
[1:04:50] does but if you let the word come in and
[1:04:54] cover it with the conscience
[1:04:56] then it can't grow it'll be a deformed
[1:04:59] word so you've got the word coming but
[1:05:03] we're allowing the things and that's
[1:05:05] Hallelujah you allow things in your mind
[1:05:08] you allow that's that's the reason why
[1:05:10] again going back to the sports channels
[1:05:11] going back to whatsoever we put in our
[1:05:13] mind our phones the internet and things
[1:05:16] like that it hinders it clogs up and
[1:05:19] deforms can you say amen amen because
[1:05:21] remember as a man thinketh so is he now
[1:05:26] now brother uh brother brandham would
[1:05:27] say on still in the in the greatest
[1:05:29] battle he says you can have little
[1:05:31] consciences thoughts little feelings
[1:05:35] little Sensations and all these things
[1:05:36] has nothing to do with it that's just
[1:05:38] little Sensations things but when it
[1:05:40] comes to reality your mind opens it up
[1:05:44] your mind either accepts it or rejects
[1:05:48] it that's it friends God let none of
[1:05:52] them miss it see if your mind that that
[1:05:55] opens it's it's your mind that opens up
[1:05:59] the door or closes the door I I I tell
[1:06:03] you do do you do you see how how letting
[1:06:06] your mind go crazy letting your mind go
[1:06:09] wild letting your mind dwell on things
[1:06:12] that it shouldn't dwell on Amen how it
[1:06:14] keeps you out of that Supernatural he
[1:06:17] says when it comes to the reality your
[1:06:20] mind opens it up your mind either
[1:06:22] accepts or rejects it that's it friend
[1:06:24] don't let nothing in miss it it's it's
[1:06:25] your mind that opens up the door or
[1:06:27] closes the door and listens to your
[1:06:30] conscience listens to your memory
[1:06:32] listens to your affections but when your
[1:06:35] mind closes itself to these things and
[1:06:38] lets God the spirit of his word come in
[1:06:41] it blows the rest of that stuff out
[1:06:44] every doubt is gone every fear is gone
[1:06:47] every sensation of Doubt is gone every
[1:06:49] feeling is gone there is nothing
[1:06:52] standing there but the word of God and
[1:06:54] Satan cannot battle against that no sir
[1:06:57] he cannot battle against it now we know
[1:07:00] that that is the truth can I hear an
[1:07:03] amen amen we know that that is a truth
[1:07:06] another place he said what was the
[1:07:07] matter you had to open the Channel first
[1:07:11] you got to get the soldier the Holy
[1:07:13] Spirit placed in the Battlefront to take
[1:07:15] God's word and there's only one way to
[1:07:17] get the spirit out of the
[1:07:18] [Applause]
[1:07:20] Soul open the door and let the Holy
[1:07:24] Spirit the the mind's going to either
[1:07:26] keep the Holy Spirit locked up or it's
[1:07:28] going to open it up and say I'm going to
[1:07:29] let you have your way in my
[1:07:31] life amen you have to open the Channel
[1:07:34] first you got to get the soldier the
[1:07:36] Holy Spirit place at the front of the
[1:07:37] battle uh to take God's word he's the
[1:07:39] word he stands there there's nothing
[1:07:41] going to stop it every other channel is
[1:07:43] cleared out it's just like an old boiler
[1:07:45] when the flu is stopped up you put a
[1:07:47] fire it'll blow your thing
[1:07:49] up it says that's that's what's matter
[1:07:52] with so many blowed up Christians is
[1:07:54] because they don't clean the channels
[1:07:55] out they don't go down to the inside
[1:07:58] you've got to get it clean your
[1:08:00] conscience your memories your thoughts
[1:08:03] laying aside everything coming from the
[1:08:05] inside of that unadulterated word that
[1:08:08] it is the truth can you say am man when
[1:08:12] your mind opens up that door or closes
[1:08:16] that door listens to your conscience
[1:08:18] listens to your memory listens to your
[1:08:21] affections but when your mind closes
[1:08:22] itself to all to these things and let go
[1:08:25] God the spirit of his word come in it'll
[1:08:29] blow the rest of the stuff out every
[1:08:32] doubt is gone every fear is gone every
[1:08:35] sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling
[1:08:38] is gone there's nothing standing there
[1:08:42] but the word of God and Satan cannot
[1:08:45] battle that no sir he cannot battle
[1:08:50] against
[1:08:51] that can you say Amen so so now once
[1:08:55] again it's not that there's you're going
[1:08:58] to find all kinds of quotes we've heard
[1:09:00] it over and over you cannot be healed by
[1:09:02] mental faith brother Brandon say you
[1:09:04] just can't mental Faith does not heal
[1:09:07] you so you can't do it here but what
[1:09:09] brother brandom so what we do is we
[1:09:11] don't pay any attention to our
[1:09:15] thoughts we're not paying any attention
[1:09:17] to what we're listening to and the on
[1:09:19] the job we're not paying it's creating
[1:09:23] thoughts we're not paying any attention
[1:09:25] to to what we're looking at it's
[1:09:27] creating thoughts we're not paying
[1:09:29] attention to anything of those
[1:09:32] things but now remember it's got to come
[1:09:36] through that channel and lots of times a
[1:09:38] lot of this is shutting off that Faith
[1:09:42] down in our heart that can bring about
[1:09:45] that word that God's wanting brought
[1:09:47] about can you say Amen now he did say he
[1:09:51] says your intellectual Faith might
[1:09:53] believe it fine but unless the faith
[1:09:54] goes down into your heart your
[1:09:56] intellectual faith can accept it do that
[1:09:59] just keep believing it amen with all
[1:10:01] your heart until God does reveal it to
[1:10:04] you just keep believing it till God
[1:10:07] reveals it amen he even goes even goes
[1:10:10] to say this on on mental faith and I he
[1:10:13] says but I say tonight just closing I
[1:10:15] want to talk to you a moment and say
[1:10:17] this if you can't receive Faith to be
[1:10:20] healed instantly then you take the
[1:10:23] adopted baby root do do did you ever
[1:10:25] hear of the adopting of a baby he says
[1:10:28] if you take a young woman maybe she's
[1:10:31] married and she and her husband she's
[1:10:32] scared she isn't going to have a baby
[1:10:35] she wants one she's so scared she won't
[1:10:37] have it and she won't because just like
[1:10:40] job the things that I feared most has
[1:10:42] come upon me but you take that same
[1:10:44] woman now if there's doctors which
[1:10:46] probably sitting here by nurses you can
[1:10:49] take that same woman and let her adopt a
[1:10:51] baby and she will have one herself it
[1:10:54] quietens her and if you haven't got
[1:10:56] enough Faith to receive it right now as
[1:10:59] a miracle then take the adopted at baby
[1:11:02] attitude lord it's mine because you
[1:11:04] promised it I will go from here tonight
[1:11:07] praising you just the same as I was well
[1:11:10] watch what happens you'll receive it it
[1:11:13] has to happen God has promised it can
[1:11:16] you say Amen so he says if there's just
[1:11:18] one little speck of faith that you'll be
[1:11:21] all right you just believe it and go on
[1:11:24] thinking so he is saying that even even
[1:11:27] if it doesn't even come just
[1:11:29] supernaturally during a
[1:11:31] service train your thoughts to believe
[1:11:36] the word
[1:11:39] [Music]
[1:11:40] regardless train your thoughts to
[1:11:43] believe it amen can you say Amen now he
[1:11:48] says uh it's that's why many times I
[1:11:50] tell the people go on start praising the
[1:11:52] Lord because that's that adopted baby
[1:11:55] because it's their
[1:11:57] intellectual until it comes into their
[1:12:00] soul that they're healed then Faith
[1:12:03] makes it right you got to know what
[1:12:05] you're doing you've got to have
[1:12:07] confidence in what you're doing and
[1:12:10] that's the way it is with us sons of God
[1:12:12] it might not be just a supernatural
[1:12:15] lightning bolt coming down and saying
[1:12:17] you're healed or God's got your children
[1:12:19] or God's got your job situation or God's
[1:12:22] going to but you just go right on
[1:12:24] trusting him you train your mind and
[1:12:26] don't you let don't let that wandering
[1:12:27] mind go this way or that way or the
[1:12:29] other way you train that mind I'm going
[1:12:31] to bring everything in line right here
[1:12:34] amen keep that channel open because what
[1:12:36] we're looking for is to get out of this
[1:12:39] and drop it right on down into that
[1:12:42] Soul he says then God is your joy God is
[1:12:45] your strength knowing the message
[1:12:47] knowing the truth that it's our
[1:12:48] sufficiency now he is my all sufficiency
[1:12:51] in him all things I have need of is in
[1:12:54] him that's our strength My Help Cometh
[1:12:57] From The Lord you Christians Look to Him
[1:12:59] for your joy Look to Him for your
[1:13:01] strength Look to Him for your happiness
[1:13:03] he's my peace he's my joy he's my love
[1:13:06] he's my life that's a covenant and that
[1:13:10] is the token up on the
[1:13:13] door oh praise the name of the Lord what
[1:13:16] what what is it the message has come the
[1:13:20] message is in action in your life amen
[1:13:24] now now brother brandham would talk
[1:13:26] about amen he would talk about Mary and
[1:13:29] and and when that amen who knew the
[1:13:32] scriptures uh who else knew the
[1:13:34] scriptures that she was thinking you
[1:13:35] know and and and and when the word was
[1:13:37] coming to her he says she she never
[1:13:40] waited little Mary didn't she had to
[1:13:43] believe something that had never
[1:13:45] happened but look at her little childish
[1:13:47] heart I'm going to think her to be just
[1:13:50] a young woman about 18 20 years old she
[1:13:53] had never taken the the second thought
[1:13:56] but as soon as she seen and know that
[1:13:58] there was was an angel of the Lord and
[1:14:00] know these things and told her exactly
[1:14:02] according to the
[1:14:03] scripture that she had been thinking on
[1:14:05] and told her her name she knowed that
