since I've seen him on the base and uh he's sort of a jack of all trades amen but um so we're we're just very delighted uh for the presence of the Lord amen good to see Dad here this morning and um amen we missed him the last couple services so it's really good to see you Dad amen look here at psalms 27 and 4 One Thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all of the days of my life and to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock I would also like to look here in First Corinthians 7 and 35 amen and um um just a a verse here 7 1 Corinthians 7 and 35 and this I speak for your own profit not that I may cast a snare upon you but that which is come that ye may attend um upon the Lord without distraction amen so we we have heard there's one thing I've desired of the Lord and that will I seek after here it says I'm I'm saying something for your own benefit here that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction one more verse here in 2 Corinthians 11 and and 1 it says I would to God that you could bear with me a little in my Folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I've espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ I want to minister this morning on created to minister to our Lord let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you Lord for being with us and the presence that we feel here this morning and Lord we ask that your the Holy Spirit would just continue to be among us and just settle all of our hearts Lord so thankful to see these young people feeling better Lord there are some Lord who are still out we just ask that you would be with them this morning and may your angel Lord just just go by those addresses and and touch those young people and father we ask that your spirit would be here with us and that you would anoint me Lord and help me father as I need your help this morning and I pray Lord that you would be with the people and that you would help them and that you would raise us all up and into your into your presence of all things possible Lord we love you with all of my heart in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen God bless you you can be seated here this morning one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life and to behold his Beauty I think there is not a greater call that we have than to be called The Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's not a greater benefit that we have than to Amen to have this honor of of being privileged to carry his name amen and and we're thankful to that and the Apostle Paul was talking there in the second verse that I had read to you he says I I I I'm I'm saying something for your benefit amen he said if you're if you're married to the in the natural amen there will be a lot of distractions you caring for your natural husband your your wife your children but he says if you're married to Christ amen you you uh have one thing upon you and that is amen your attention is to him and to him alone amen and then he writes in the second uh letter to Corinthians and he and he and he tells them amen uh I I I I want you as I have espoused you as a chased virgin to one husband amen I want you to really take this seriously Amen Brother Steve and sister Karen it's good to see you guys back amen from Ohio um we we we want you to I I want you to really take take certain here is I have given you to Christ that you would really be careful because as Satan amen slipped a good one on Eve he'll try to do the same thing for you and I I say today amen that we we want to serve god without any kind of distraction in our in our Our Lives now there's going to be distractions amen we're living in an age of uh Plum full of distractions we're living in a world just Plum full of chaos but but I'm so glad that the prophet would tell us that even amen he says we see those hours that were in and the stage and we see uh what it was and the Holy Ghost rebuking the age that that put him out but in all of that did you notice to him that overcometh you he says even in that worldly Wicked Church age him that overcometh we find here that God always had Overcomers and he had Overcomers in every age there always there's always every time in every age there's been on the earth God has always had somebody who could put his hands upon amen as a witness in this earth he has never been without a witness oh doesn't that make you just want to shout hallelujah he says though sometimes it got down to just one amen somebody overcome and now like the Saints of old can you say Amen so I say today in the midst of the perversions there is still desire now predestination produces desire because there is there is something about a woman that come Eve came out from Adam amen she she was part of Adam when Adam looked at Eve amen he had said your bone of my bone your Flesh of My Flesh amen so there was something unique about Adam Amen in fact you know uh Eve's Eve's name was not given to her until after she produced her children amen her name was Adam Adam Adam Where Art Thou amen what was it she was simply the feminine part of Adam God separated the feminine spirit and put it in the body that he had made out of Adam's Rib well praise the Lord and so you were created to minister under Christ amen you're not created to go to church you're not created Amen to be a to to join some kind of a religious faction you were created to minister oh so many times people think amen that ministering under Christ means going amen you got to go to church and you got to do this and you got to do that God is wanting your heart God created you he created your spirit he created your heart because he wanted fellowship with you amen the scripture says that God created a help meet unto amen for Adam it was a help there was a cry there was she was built with desire to fulfill her husband oh that just makes me want to shout do you realize amen that God put you here in Le osia to give him praise do you realize that God put you here in this wicked Church age Amen to to to to honor him and to love him and to refresh him amen and to be his praise and his Joy his love his glory here on this Earth do you realize that you don't have to beg God for anything do you realize amen that it was God's divine plan to put you here and God is loving you God loves you with oh hallelujah amen oh you might feel like you you you wish you had more love from your wife or you had more love from your husband but I want to tell you right here amen God is given you all of his love amen all that he has he has given to this church amen if she can just reach out and understand what she was created for can you say amen amen desire I think desire is a great thing desire comes amen from that from that from that seed that God placed within you you know I looked up desire and it and it means to to want something strongly it means to have an appeal a longing a craving a yearning a need Amen in other words there must be something or there must be someone that is worthy of that desire amen there there in other words there there's a there there is something out there amen that is creating a strong pulsation in your heart amen for more of them amen and to be close to them well praise the Lord amen I we can't get we can't get all him off the phone enough amen he is with that with that with that girl of his all the time amen why because he has found an object he has found a girl amen that is worthy of his love and his attention well then I want to say amen I i' I'd be worried if it wasn't that way amen if if if she doesn't mean anything to you then you should never ask her to marry well praise the Lord amen don't get married unless you love the girl don't get married unless you love the man but you see it's that love when you can't do without well praise the Lord amen hallelujah and I want to say that that little love affair should never change that should never change I don't care whether amen Mama's old and amen you've been with her for 50 years and she's gray and false teeth and amen and in a can amen but that should never change that love relation reltionship should never change because you have found something of value that has fulfilled your heart can you say amen amen hallelujah amen so we as we are likened unto that woman that is in love this attraction is not amen shared by everyone excuse me amen this attraction is not shared by everyone uh uh uh when I amen when my wife and I had met and u i was flirting around with her and and she was sort of flirting with me too praise the Lord and uh uh you know the the the girls that I was raised up with they come and told her they said listen amen now my wife she was a Baptist and uh we met her at a when when when she was 14 years old we we had taken the tent uh uh over to the uh Kenwood and and had the those tent meetings there matters of fact that was the time that brother Donald uh about the time that we met brother Donald too and uh uh anyways we you know well my wife came praise the Lord and so she was 14 years old and and uh now she wasn't she wasn't uh she she she had pants and earrings and cut hair and and and all of that kind of thing amen but God saved her amen and I I fell in love with her I remember going up to my mom and you see that girl over there amen I'm going to marry her my mama amen she slapped me so hard I'm sure I still got a an imprint on my face Hallelujah now she says that didn't happen but come feel the imprint amen but you see H there you know the but but the thing was four years later I married my I married that girl now those other girls that I was raised with they said now listen you don't know Wendell amen that you just listen you Hallelujah and but yet all of the things that those other girls that I was RA you know hey you know I rubbed their face in snow and mud and we just I mean we were we were just like brothers and sisters and there was nothing about me that those girls found attractive hallelujah amen but my wife found something in me Hallelujah that was attractive and and uh amen we we we have been married for 36 35 years and uh amen and July 1 is going to be 36 years but you see there was an attraction to her towards me now listen I am not the same goodlooking boy that I was amen all of those well 40 years ago amen I'm better looking but no I but I I I've got my bald head I've gotten fat amen and and and and and none of us neither one of us looked the same that we had like we were amen 40 years ago when we had first met but I will say this there is a love that is greater toward my wife today amen than there was H 40 years ago amen there is a love well can you say amen amen so there are distractions the distractions to try to abort or to amen cause us to divorce cause us to Amen to to not see and not be fulfilled and not be but you see I have made a commitment to her I have given her my all and I refuse to look at her negatives I refuse to look and allow things in my heart amen that would bring disparaging thoughts toward her I gave her my heart I gave her my life I'm giving her everything that I've got and I want to say today that's the love that God has toward you he loves you with an eternal love he loves you despite your faults and your and your failures he's given you everything that he's got man it's a love and me to him it's a love Hallelujah when I don't get my wants it's a love that goes beyond my wands when when it seems like I'm going through the valley oh how I love him I was created to minister to him Solomon in the Song of Solomon he had this he wrote Of This Love Affair between the bride and Christ Song of Solomon one and two let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than Wine because of the Savor of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee draw me somebody say draw me and we will run after thee the king have brought me into his Chambers and we will be glad and rejoice in thee we will remember thy love more than Wine the upright love thee well can you say man a genuine heart genuine worship now Satan takes the Mind Satan and that's that's our problem with marriage today amen we we Satan has so put it on Amen and and so pointed and it you know it's just you know we fall into the Trap of the of the satanic anointing and the hour that we're living in no no Nation Falls from without they fall from within and the greatest detriment to this Amen to America and to the world Amen is is is the promoting amen of of of of of sexuality the promoting and and the and and and the amen the putting forth these naked women and and and the pretty forms and and the things that that boys and girls have to see amen from their from from just a little baby as they're growing up these things become natural and Satan Works through those sensual thoughts and and sensual eyesight and and feelings but you see that's not love at all amen love is amen how how pretty her lips are love isn't how pretty the form is love is a spiritual thing love has nothing to do whether amen your your your woman's fat or whether she's skin whether she's tall or whether she's short love is a spiritual thing you cannot put your hands on love amen you can't go buy 25 cents amen of Love or $5 of love amen love is a spiritual thing and when you fall in love amen when there is a true genuine love it's not because Mama's cute it's not because she a sweetheart it's because you have found something that your soul can't do without Satan attracts the mind and sight and if you boys aren't careful Satan can get you even at a young age looking at stuff you shouldn't and if if you boys do that kind of a thing you ought to be ashamed of yourself and if there's teenagers that do that kind of a thing if there's men that do that kind of a thing you ought to be ashamed of yourself Satan wants to go after the mind the sight and there ain't no way no way amen this would almost sound like like a cuss word but no way in hell no way here on Earth no way in the heavens that you would ever find a girl that can ever be like that that old those old filthy hussies amen that are on that internet there there is no way there's no way that those filthy women would ever would ever even come close to any of the girls any of the women sitting in this church here today there is no way amen now but with Satan anoints your eyes and begins to anoint your mind and anoints your Sensations amen and pulls you out there on those you're living in a world Amen that is Anointed by evil spirits and those evil spirits are bringing things into your into your natural realm amen and call and and and what are they doing they're distress rating you from your real purpose they're distracting you from your real love they're distracting you from a girl that can satisfy you and love you well can you say Amen you see these things are meant to to to pull you off and the Apostle Paul is saying I I've done my best to keep you a virgin I've done my best to keep you true I I I I espoused you to one that loves you that created you that would be with you and keep you through sickness and health and through rich and poor he'll be with you amen but I have this I have this thought that Satan is going to distract you and pull you off this way and pull you off that way but he says get your eyes get your thoughts in control with that love well praise the Lord distractions distractions are everywhere and praise the Lord you love him in the animal world World who's the who's the good looking one who's who's who's the trophy well in the animal world do you do you guys have a dough on your wall or do y'all have a on your wall in the animal world well can you say am man now why is it Satan has anointed Satan has anointed women amen and made them a lot more purtier in this last day that than than he has uh any other time amen as it has been said you can go look at the Prest amen the the the beauty queen go look at the beauty queen of the 19 uh what was it 1913 or 1922 some somewhere in there hallelujah amen go go get go look at the beauty queen and and she was she was the national chick okay amen and you look at her back then and you look at the ugliest girl around that you could find in America today that ugly girl would put the Hallelujah a shame come on is because Satan amen now that's not there's nothing wrong with beauty and we love pretty girls I'm listen I'm glad that my girl is pretty amen I'm glad you know I'd be bad if she had two noses and three eyes amen but I I appreciate my wife but now but now here's the thing Satan has brought things and progressed things and has made things s amen until the eyes it's the it's they have taken the eyes off of the real Incorruptible value of the lady of the man and they have put it upon what they can see what they can feel hey well can you say amen amen so that is way Satan is doing this today the original sin was that great big beast of a man amen he such a hunk that caused Eve Amen to fall in adultery with him and it's that same devil today that wants to try amen to bring our relationships and our marriages and amen and and and our relationships and keep them in turmoil but I want to say God's got a love that he has placed and you need his love for your wife you need his love for your husband you need his love amen on anything you do you've got to have that Divine character that comes from him all right hallelujah amen let's go move on so Satan chooses the eyes God chooses the heart and it's that heart that God deals with can you say Amen it's the heart that he reveals himself to I I want us to just stop for a few moments here this morning I want you to look at where you are today here in 2025 I I want you to look at what God has done in Redemption and how he has brought Redemption all the way amen from from the fall with a partial revelation of himself came a a partial amen atonement it was the partial Revelation that produced a lamb it was God Amen that looked down at Adam and Eve when they had fallen amen and there they are they are they're being kicked out of the garden and as they're walking out then God's heart of Love stops them he says come back here I can't stand to just see you walk away amen without some kind of atonement and what did he do amen he goes and and kills amen an animal and he takes the bloody skins and he puts it over them amen and it was a declaration amen right now I don't have a body right now I cannot redeem you amen I you you you have fallen and it's going to require a Kinsman but he says there's going to come a time when I will come and redeem you but for right now I want you to know that there is righteousness for you that there is love for you well can you say amen amen oh under partial Revelation came a lamb I I I begin to think about that here this morning amen the partial word with the partial word means an underdeveloped bride if you've only got a little bit of of of word amen you've only got you've got an immature bride there was no way that anyone under the Old Testament blood of bulls and goats could ever come into maturity under the the the shadows of blood of bulls and goats amen God's desire was for Redemption what was Redemption to bring them back to the Adam and Eve at the beginning God would raise prophets God would raise sages and they would begin to talk about that one that was to come there's coming a redeemer there's going to come one that's living in the in a body like yours he's going to be he's going amen To Love Oh Glory to God it's going to be God in a body he's going to love like God he's going to give like God he's going to heal like God he's going to redeem like God he's going to can you say Amen but it was only through the the partial amen Revelation and partial atonement part paral maturity but you see I I want you to look at this as as we as we keep in mind that you are created to love him amen now thousands and thousands of lambs were killed for the atonement thousands and thousands and thousands of lambs all throughout the Old Testament and the Old Testament believer was accepted by God through those Lambs but this partial word could only provide a substitute when I say a partial word amen the law was just partial word amen the the the Abraham had a partial word the prophets had a partial word but you see those Old Testament saints were looking at a promise that there would come a just one there would come one who could stand stand up for the human race and say I am willing to redeem her Hallelujah well can you say Amen now there would come little types partial they would begin to see a little bit amen here would come a Naomi and a Ruth talking about the Jews amen would would would also bring in the Gentiles there would be a Boaz that would be willing to Mar his own inheritance in order to redeem there there would be all of these things of the Old Testament well Hallelujah but you see it was always a looking forward it was always it's going to come it was always well praise the Lord Isaiah in the 53rd chapter he would say he's a man of Sorrows he's a man of regret they plucked his beard from him they they spat upon him who should declare his generation he he was cut off out of the land of the living surely Heath borne our sorrows Heath carried our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was put upon him well praise the Lord there were all of these impartial words but when Jesus came he was the Fulfillment of all of those things can you say Amen when Jesus was crucified on Calvary now I want you to remember this the Old Testament blood of bulls and goats come to a an ending when Jesus while he was up there suspended Between Heaven and Earth while he was being crucified when he died the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom no man was able to go behind that Veil any no mortal man not even a priest could go back behind that Veil only the high priest could go back behind that Veil where The Mercy Seat was and where the amen the pillar of fire would come down over the well can you say man but now I want you to be careful I want you to catch this now because when Jesus he was the Fulfillment of all the impartial scripture all of the bits all of the pieces everything throughout 4,000 years had all come to comption in the body of Jesus Christ oh now it was good to see a man Healing The Sick it was good seeing a man raising the dead but there had been people raised from the dead before there had been people heal healed from the sick before but when Jesus was crucified on Mount Calvary it was a witness that all the partial was fulfilled in that perfect lamb now it was one thing for me to declare it you declare it all of us to shout hallelujah about it but the Bible says when he raised up from the dead the all of those Old Testament Saints raised up from the dead all of those ones who had been believing God using the impartial using the blood of the Bulls and the goats they had to go down into the grave amen there was nothing about a bull and a goat but you see it was a testifying that there was going to come a kinsman redeemer oh you say what is a kinsman redeemer you see there was something missing from him amen he had a bride somewhere he had a woman somewhere she was a fallen woman and he was willing to come and look for his [Applause] bride oh can you say Amen when he raised from the dead all of those Old Testament Saints Heen what did they do they came and showed themselves all throughout Jerusalem amen they was appearing to everybody said can you imagine Here Comes Abraham walking up to you can you imagine amen here is Jeremiah and Ezekiel and they're testifying this is the one will blessed be the name of the Lord but he didn't just stop and give his life amen I believe that while he was there in the grave amen when that blood cell was broke out of that blood cell came a bride can you say Amen a bride was birth when he was put to sleep just as Adam when Adam was put to sleep amen a bride came from Adam amen a living bride born that could love him and refresh him and serve him oh can you see amen and I want to say on the day of Pentecost amen the rushing Mighty Wind the life of God come down upon that 120 amen now it is not just the man Jesus Christ but there is a bride on the earth that can Minister unto him the prophet would say notice how appropriate it was showing that Jerusalem was ceasing when it was in effect until that hour the blood of the Lamb was all right until that day but now at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done and there's a new one the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they were condemning and doing the very thing there that they had to do can you say Amen up until Jesus crucifixion partial word partial Redemption but when Jesus came John had already been told now stay with me because I'm fixing to get into my I want to get into my main thought right here for the next uh 15 minutes or so man John had said to whom the spirit descends upon and remains you'll know that that is the Messiah now the holy Spirit would come upon the prophets and then would leave right you could not have the perfect Holy Ghost dwelling in you under the blood of bulls and goats but God's perfect son came amen and God bear witness of him he paid the price of redemption and now the same holy ghost that was in the perfect son on the day of Pentecost is now in that Perfect Bride now there's where you're going to you going to say the bride is not perfect I want to tell you you are just as perfect as Jesus Christ is because it was the perfect blood of the perfect God living in the perfect Jesus Christ and it brought you back oh you were divorced you were separated you had nothing but he after his love went after you to bring you back unto him amen can you say amen amen now hallelujah oh my brother brand would say when the when the veil was rent at Calvary The Mercy Seat come into Plain View but what happened it was hanging on Calvary dripping in Blood and as they had took the blood year after year a a at the cleansing of the sanctuary and sprinkling of The Mercy Seat there God with his Great Mighty stroke of lightning power split the old Badger Veil from top to bottom and The Mercy Seat come into Plain View and the real genuine Lamb of God was hanging in plain view on Calvary the real Mercy Seat when God had paid the price himself and became one of us and was manifested himself as a man to get acquainted with us and we to be acquainted with him The Mercy Seat was in plain view of all Israel on the day of atonement and there Jesus says it is finished what do you mean it is finished does that mean I okay I'm I'm dying now no the Redemption had been paid what Adam could not do Adam couldn't redeem his wife well praise the Lord amen now the Bible says that Adam was not in the transgression it was Eve that was in the transgression but when Eve fell Adam could not have her living out there in Doom and him living in Paradise she was part of him Adam couldn't say well that's you know good riddens hos still of Easter baby Hallelujah she was part of him and every man toward his wife is not looking at his wife in judgment because when you look at her in judgment you're in under judgment too she is you you are her the both become one and when Eve had fallen and when Eve was was subject what can you say am man Hallelujah there she had partaken of the seed of that serpent what did he do he out of love put his seed in that womb and they both walked out can you say Amen just showing that as the bride walked out of paradise so was God going to walk out of paradise he was going to leave the Throne of Heaven he was going to live in a body he was going to hurt like you hurt he was going to be sick like you're sick he was going to suffer like you suffer he was going to have headaches like you have headaches he was going to die like you die but he was going to redeem you and bring you back oh God oh God we should never look at our wives the Apostle Paul says don't provoke your wife to bitterness and don't be bitter against them don't don't do those things but love them as the weaker vessel love them and as Christ for Love's sake as the word took on because word was doing nothing but condemning we found that through the law it was under nothing but condemnation but what the law could not do the word took on a body when the word says this is my law and when the bride was looking at the law and saying there's no way I can be that that's when the word took on a body to pay the price of their transgressions God's not looking at you this morning with eyes of Amen accusation and eyes of Amen h torment and eyes of punishment he's looking at you with eyes of Mercy I love [Applause] you I love you can you say amen hallelujah when I am able to forgive my wife and we don't always see eyes eye and I got to say sometimes her eyesight's better than mine Hallelujah and I don't always she doesn't always make me happy and there's plenty of times that I could hold grudges against her and she could do that to me but it's my privilege as Christ so loved the church and gave himself for it that he now watch this watch how it all it all together he the word took on the Flesh and as Christ so loved the church that he gave himself for it so that he could wash it with the washing of the Water by the word it was through his blood his sacrifice his atonement that he could come in and say now I will per perfect that which concerns you you will come to your fullness you will be everything I've ordained you to be I love you I'll bring you to myself wasn't going to sit there and accuse and accuse and accuse and say get up get up get up get up come on come on come on there's no way but the Blood Washed all of that away and the middle waterer partition was tore down Adam's not looking at the girl and saying listen you're the reason all of the Brokenness the middle wall of partition is tore down price is being paid he's not looking at her with eyes of hello come on he's looking and say don't worry about the past I love you I love you I won't embarrass you amen I'll embarrass you no come on I need I need someone you can you you GNA be my bride Hallelujah I love you I got to have this hand amen don't worry about your past don't worry about all of the mistakes all that junk back there it was my love I took on what I had to do to destroy everything are you hearing me and what is he doing he is not keeping her here he's taking her back to Paradise he's bringing her back to the place that he had prepared for her before the foundation of the world oh God she he loves her that he gave his life for her now your love amen to him your love to Jesus is I want to serve you and love you and give myself to you with everything that I am it's because he reached out to you that you can now serve him in love thank you amen hallelujah he he done it can you say Amen so then where's all the law where where's all of the the list of Commandments on the refrigerator telling you you better you better you better you better you better you better you better not you better not you better you better you better not you better oh all of those the Bible says all of the ordinances that were held against us were all put away through his blood and now because I from the beginning came out of his that rib was right next to his heart and when I that's what he had of me in the beginning that's how he loved me in the beginning that's how he seen me in the beginning oh can you say Church of the Living God you've got to accept that Grace and you got to walk with God Amen and the more you accept him and the more that you feel his love the more you can return that love to him can you say Amen now brand would saying God be blessed for seeing this wonderful Heavenly light in this last day because the churches is doing the same thing today now I want you to see this I'm putting the two together now until that hour that the organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing the word from then on comes the word and the word only from the old Pascal lamb passed away amen Christ become our lamb at the day of crucifixion and the day that the denomination has crucified the word of God and accepted a Creed instead of the word that's the day when the word comes into full effect and that's just been recently amen what is he trying to say as the imperfect came into the perfect so has it been today as Christ has comeing this last day and revealed himself as in no other day what is it a a declaration of it's a declaration that it's going home time it's a declaration that that the old prostitutes are washed away from you it's a declaration that you're going back to that Garden that you left in the beginning can you see man so the imperfect word could only bring an imperfect brother Bri and immature and we've seen the seven Church ages amen we've seen the seven Church ages and we are we have come through the ages of all of the denominations and in this last age where Christ is totally put out but at the time of his first crucifixion that was the Declaration that the God of all glory had come to maturity in a body and when the denominations have put the word out in this day it's a declaration that the Bride of all ages has come to an age of accountability and maturity and that he is ready to take her home back where she came from that should make you want to shout amen created Created to minister created to love him created Oh Glory to God I don't I don't I I don't know where you are there I know there's some single mamas here there's I I I know there's there's there's been relationships that have been all messed up I understand that but I just want to tell you there ain't no messed up relationships on on the other side I guarantee you there's no Brokenness on the other side I guarantee you there's no what can you say amen hallelujah amen oh because you have caught his eye but I just want to tell you it's not that he's looking at you see God is not looking at the sensual God's not going by eyesight God's not going by ears or feelings God's going by that eternal love and that love amen you came from his heart in the beginning and his that heart will always love you can you say Amen oh great God Of Heaven how we should love him how we should adore him he loves his people love him he says God begin to brood and I'm I'm closing now brood over that and after the fall and he brought up an Enoch and Elijah a Moses he brought up Prophet after Prophet trying to restore that image again finally upon the Earth come the genuine image of God himself again which was God the logos made flesh dwelt Among Us and now that same logos has a part he's got a bride and the same logos this word cannot be tampered with it's brooding over the church today church is today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation which the prophets were carriers to that seed the church denominations have been carrier to the seed now now notice quickly but that like the shuck hugs and holds in the seed now and then leaves her Jesus was God his father was the great logos himself he could not pour it in all into Moses for he was a prophet he could and the word of the lord always never fails comes to the prophet there's no place no time in in the Bible or since the Bible that the correct interpretation of the word comes to a theologian it's not in the scriptures never did the Pharisees or never the Sadducees never did God raise up Prophet out of any of them and never did he in these last days are you hearing but when that word comes as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man behold I send you Elijah the prophet before that great and Tre Dreadful day of the Lord what is God saying there's been a lot of partial there's been a little bit of this been a little bit of this but but when the all not just the partial but when the fullness of the Revelation comes then there will be a complete then there will be not a word condemning it was always word made flesh it's the word taking on flesh it's you the bride in full adornment of his word now the scripture says there in Song of Solomon he said we have a little sister who has no breast what shall we do in the day that she what shall she do in the day that she has spoken for so here comes and and the Bible's not a dirty book what she what the Bible is saying is we have a little sister that has not matured she wants to be a bride but she can't give suck to a baby she can't give nourishment to a child and that's been the church that was prophetic of the church for all of these ages because only partial word could give par could could give a portion of maturity but when the perfect word comes this lady is not one that's hiding in a corner and and saying no one look at me I hope I'm not spoken for I I have nothing thing to offer she is a matured lady she is a matured woman she is wearing the Royal garments of his righteousness which is the fine linen of his word she is perfect he has made her perfect oh [Music] [Applause] can you say Amen now true story over there I believe it was in India there was the the the the woman or maybe it was Africa there was a family that was had a there mom and dad had a couple of daughters or had had several daughters and uh one you know all of the daughters had gotten pretty well had all gotten married off and and and they all they were some pretty girls but there was just one girl that was just very plain and and she had a great inferiority complex her sisters were all beautiful and the guys were all coming around and wanting them and and but she just she just always stayed in the background and she never never done um just never came out never really fixed herself up never when you would see her in the markets and and around her hair was just it just done anyway and she just she just looked she just looked like a servant more than she did a a daughter the other girls they have Diaries over there still do and and so when a guy would come in and wanting to ask for the for the the girl's hand you know if he comes and and and and ask you to be his uh wife then he would go talk to your dad and maybe he would bring a a pig or chicken or something whatever your value would be you know and so and then if someone would come over to this other one and say hey another man come in and might might give a cow and so then she could look at you and say you got the you got the chicken mine gave me my daddy a cow for me and you know that but that's the way they done it they they gave diaries for them so get this this this is true story this is this is in several magazines there was this there is this um but there was this prince who had come and was just just coming through the The Villages and just checking everything out and will he come across this woman he seen her there in the marketplace and their hair was sort of just tied back wasn't just wasn't fixed up sure was just really plain she was just really no one paid any attention to her but there was something about the girl that caught his eye and and she so we asked around where she comes they go well she lives out there on a certain farm and so he goes and he talks to the to the dad and says does does your daughter live here I seen would you mind me talking to her well he she heard him talking to to to her dad he she was back in the in the back of the Hut and she heard her and they she looked at herself and she said oh my goodness so when her dad came back he says she says no I no you'll get to know me and just you'll do away with me like everyone else has done I don't want nothing and and their dad says listen this man really is interested in you he's a prince I won't you so she finally comes out and talks to him and she wouldn't even look at him and she was just so she was just so ashamed of herself and and man the the the man love what what he had to what he was talking to and so finally um they began a relationship and and as he began to quarter over over time she began to to get confidence but what what really made the difference for her is when he asked her about marriage and she says I would be willing if my dad will and so he comes in and he says I want to marry your daughter and her dad says man you know what what would you have to give and he says I what what is the other's gift well I've got a chicken I've got a this and I've got a cow and I've got and and I think he had been given three cows for one girl the man looked at him and says I'll give eight cows the girl started crying just crying nobody in the entire Village had ever paid eight cows for a girl so they got married moved off and and uh well the reporter that was that was writing this story had heard of this and he goes back finds out where this is gets where and and and and as he's going through there he found he he he walks into this Marketplace and there is this woman that is of a such pristine confidence very well-dressed beautiful woman the says she was beautiful and there were people following her people stopping to talk to her bowing to her and he asked who is this and the guy that was giving him the tour says she's the girl you're looking for you see something had happened within that year it wasn't that she changed she was still the same woman with the same hair but something had changed she was the last one she was the one that was overlooked she was the one that everyone sort of just she was the one but that man seen value in her and brought the value from her and gave amen eight cows as a dowy to her father and you know what it was amen Time After Time After Time After Time it was her prince telling her you're beautiful you're mine you're lovely oh how I appreciate the way you do the dishes oh how I love the way you're doing your hair oh how I love that dress on you it was the prince that brought the value of that woman out of her are you understanding me and it is Jesus Christ he's not giving you partial Revelation but it is God who has comeing this last day and say I love you you are beautiful to me you are lovely to me I love the way you worship I love the way you pray I love the way you
