we're in or how great the struggle is we can have a peace in the Lord Jesus Christ because we have found it through him am and as we read a little bit tonight um in the church age book as and and a little bit through the fox's book of Martyrs we'll find that peace is not consistent on or it does not depend upon having everything going our way peace is being in love love with the Lord Jesus Christ and loving him with everything that is within us that is what the gospel brings to us and we're so thankful for that here tonight good evening good to see everyone in the house of the Lord today and um amen I don't see Dylan is is he still trying to get his nose taken care of still still bleeding a little bit okay well devil um we're just believing for victory for brother Dylan here the

blessing to to my wife and myself and to the church and and uh we we love our sister and um so we hope you had a wonderful day today glad we get to celebrate it with you tonight in church amen and U well we uh uh we're just looking forward to what God has in store how many believes there's a Rapture right just right close to us amen that that Rapture is just so close we're going to step into that into that other rim and I know that's going to happen here really soon let's let's look here in in um Revelations 2 and nine I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews but are not but are the synagogue of Satan amen not of the synagogue but they are the Temple of the devil fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that he uh that ye may be tried you shall have tribulation 10 days and be thou faithful unto death I will give thee a Crown of Life let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you tonight for your many blessings that you have given us we thank you for your love to us and Lord things happen as our as our brother there in in in um Fort Smith Lord and and their their uh baby and oh God I just the devil is always trying to to do something to to hurt the children of God but father we look to you tonight and we thank you for being with

strengthen him and make him whole Lord Lord oh God let let all of them know that you are with them this evening father we look to you here for our for this need or our present need Lord is to hear your word and to understand your word Lord I think that's a greater need than any need Lord is for our ears to be able to hear and understand what you are saying to us tonight be with us tonight Lord as we read and comment I just pray that you would be in everything that is done and said we'll give you glory and honor in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this evening amen we are on the uh 127th page uh in the smaran church age and um so we we dealt last week um amen with the synagogue of Satan and we're going to continue um with um with tonight and and it'll be along the lines of persecution and so um and so we want to understand that there are there are are are two uh there are two groups now so with it's not just it is not just the Christians versus the Jews it's it's not just the Christians um the elect that that is vers that versus Satan but now we have got the true Christian Church the false Christian church and that have that have aligned themselves up amen they've already started aligning themselves up with the Jews uh with with the Jewish religion with uh Amen Brother David it's good to see you here tonight and amen and we want to say uh congratulations to the Lancaster family good to see these Lancaster boys uh to their baby sister and itn't she just a cutie and uh so we're just we're just so blessed we're we're so proud for the Lancaster family we love them so deeply and and um and so we're we're thankful for your prayers uh Sister Sister U you know she she she had it with no medicines or anything like that and and uh uh these these girls around here are tough and so uh you know I tell them I said if you've got it available use it but uh but uh these uh sister uh these sister Stephanie did not do that and then um um but she said she she really didn't feel just a whole lot until at the very end and so we're we're just thankful for I mean she felt the pressure and all of that but just wasn't an extreme pain until the end and that's what we were praying for is the Lord would would help her and and give her a good delivery so if they're watching tonight we say God bless you brother Harry and sister Stephanie amen and uh we love them so so as as we were saying there Satan was is now beginning to come and he's and and and now we have got the synagogue of Satan with the and the synagogue of and the the the church themselves amen there is they are now claiming the same Christ they are now claiming the same blessings amen but one is following the word and the one is trying to appease the world because they were quite frankly they were tired of the persecution they were tired of the trials and the and and the things of that nature and so uh they they were they were compromising already they had left the life of the word and trying to fit in with the world trying to fit in with the things of of the world and so um we say that we and and this wasn't anything new because the Apostle Paul had already had already predicted and I already said there in in the Philippians you know he said some indeed cre uh uh Philippians 1 and 15 some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife and some of good will one preached Christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add Affliction to my bonds you know uh but the other of love knowing that I'm set for the defense of the Gospel what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretense or in truth Christ is preached and therein I do Rejoice yay and Will Rejoice so and and and then we find that as Paul Paul is is is coming down to the last part of his life he's saying that Deus has forsaken me having loved this present world and his departed unto thessalonica Paul Paul brother brandham says this was not he was not going out to the bars he was not going back out into the world he said he simply amen he loved the ways of the world he loved the ways of man's uh um uh opinion and and and U um love love their um their their kind words over the words of God Amen and so this this was already a falling away but remember as long as the lion anointing was there through that Prophet there Satan couldn't have its way into the church but once the Apostle Paul had had had passed on now amen and he's given his life um he he the church the lion is gone and now it's the it's that Ox anointing that is now steing in now persecution is fixing to come uh with with great fierceness so this is where you're going this is where the seals and the church ages blend in together it was the lion under that first seal that that that was that Prophet lion the Apostle Paul uh was there now it's the ox that Ox is the slaughter is is is sacrificial it's an animal of Amen of of giving of uh you know giving its life and and so and even even the Apostle Paul you know uh there in second Timothy he says the Alexander the coppersmith has has has done me much evil and U you know another place he says no man has stood with me but all men have forsook me and uh then he says but I pray God that it might not be laid to their charge not with standing the Lord stood with me and strengthened me and that by my preacher might be fully known that all the Gentiles might hear I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will perserve me until his Heavenly Kingdom uh to whom be glory uh for all uh forever and ever and and so we we can see even in Galatians old foolish Galatians who have Bewitched you that you should you know leave this gospel of Christ to another not that there is another there is no other gospel but you are following somebody else and so we could see in the days of Paul and so as we read this last we're not going back over the last night's uh the last reading but as the last reading last Wednesday night we found that they were of the synagogue of Satan and and and they were bringing in the persecutions and so amen I want us to look at this now as we as we uh start here in page 20 uh 127 the first uh paragraph he says you tamper with God and you reap exactly what you've injected man ought to learn that from nature he has tampered with nature he has injected his own ideas and nature and rearranged the molecules Etc and now he's reaping a whirlwind just look how they have bred the chicken it ISO so highly bred that it is a laying machine uh that lays itself out it's no good for food is soft and poor eating they inject substances into the meat we eat because of that the human body is changing so the women are getting narrower in the hips and broader of the shoulders and men are getting just the opposite now if you fool with nature and get a monstrosity and a backfire What will what will happen if you change the truth into a lie the answer is you will breed an antichrist Godless system of religion that is so perverted it will not look like or produce uh what the original did the only answer that God has for a situation like that is the Lake of Fire the poor samian age was dying what when it died it never came back no age never comes back no Revival comes ever comes back it can't have the life of God in it by the natural generation it takes a regeneration from above this last age started with the fires of Pentecost Revival and they organized it right back instead of taking the word they took their own ideas and did what uh just what every age has done substituted the manual for the word just you step outside that manual and see what happens you're dying or you're out brother they will persecute you and blame it on God how they love their Organization no wonder they are the second generation Pentecostals and since God doesn't have children they are just uh children of their father and known by their Creeds and form of worship they talk about what used to be but they can't produce it once they had the lightning but about all the uh all that is left is the thunder but let them talk to you about the glories of their movement and they will say yes sir I want you to know that this is a move that no man started it came spontaneously the spirit fell all over the world yes sir we got what they had at Pentecost this is was not of man but of God then why didn't they keep it that way if God started it how come God couldn't keep it and finish it amen to that if God didn't write a handbook of Creeds and formulas and dogmas to start it then what right did they have to do that God has poured his Spirit upon Baptist Methodist nazarenes and Advan Adventist uh Presbyterian Brethren Church of God several names so Etc all these Brethren were brought up on different doctrines bylaws Church manuals Etc God swept it all to one side he destroyed their dispensational theories and restored the gifts of the Spirit proving that he is the same yesterday today and forever but did those Pentecostals learn their lesson about Organization no sir they organized right back and have their uh and have written their own textbooks by laws in church manual Fellowship book Etc with one idea in mind that is to prove that they now have all the truth they know all the truth and are therefore the elite of God who know the way and can show it under others as God's appointed guides they uh but they haven't got it they have hybridized themselves like the very groups they came out of if they want to be in the bride they are going to have to come out exactly as their forefathers did can can I hear an amen amen now listen God God pulled us out God pulled us out don't let us organize around our our certain beliefs there is nothing in a belief and and and a Doctrine that'll ever produce Christ you've got to believe the word of God and walk with God it's not in what you believe it's who you're walking with and that's so important amen because we can come I believe this I believe this I believe this I believe this and the spirit of God doesn't have any have any right away in your life the spirit of God can't convict you and and and and and and and and walk with you on a daytoday basis brother you've denominational IED somewhere because God wants to walk with his people can you say amen he says they're all like the rest the Revival is over they're trying to live a name and are dead they took organization and all the while talking about the spirit of God they talk about the evidence of the Holy Spirit but they forget that the devil can talk in tongues too the utter confusion of Babel is in their midst and they call it the spirit of God once again we see man telling God instead of God telling man now we're going to come back to that a little bit later on Amen now he's going to explain and I I I think this is incredible he says now you might desire to SC me right here for what I have said all right they call themselves Pentecostal and Full Gospel let them prove it at Pentecost the fire came in a cloud and separated over each of them like a tongue and fell on each one where is that fire they spoke in tongues at Pentecost and the people who listen understood where is that the whole multitude of Believers acted like one family Pentecostals are as badly divided up divided as any group in history no man Durst join himself to the early church only God added they have as many goats among them as any they claim to be Full Gospel but they can't prove it their churches are as empty of power as any of them if they are Full Gospel uh Full Gospel then we had better admit the Bible made a mistake when it describes the Full Gospel men at Pentecost they sing there's been a change in me they are right but the change has not been for the better it is time to get back to God they have a name that they live but are dead tongues isn't the evidence of Revival it is the evidence of death tongues proclaimed the evidence that the ceremonial religion of the Jews was over and that a new era had begun tongues today is ringing down the curtain on the Gentile Church ages and the the gospel is going back to the Jews people are talking about tongues heralding in a great spiritual move they have missed the boat the truth is that it is the writing it is writing the Finish to all of man's ideas programs and kingdoms the kingdom of God will be ushered in wake up people of God wake up can you say Amen so so what was what was taking place now brother brandham is taking this and he's and he's pointing us back to uh when Daniel interpreted the tongues when when uh when the kingdom was fixing to be uh ripped away from jerus and and and when when the when when there he was in his drunken stew and and and there he he had he had taken the vessels from the the holy vessels from the Temple of Jerusalem and he had taking them in and was drinking out of these holy vessels amen these were that were Sanctified and sacred unto God and he was defiling the things of God Amen and saying that it didn't matter and that's when that's when the uh and and and he done that on purpose in his in his drunken stew he says bring in those vessels amen until there was no difference between the holy and the profane didn't the scripture say something about that too amen woe to them that that that that that call the holy profane and the profane holy that's when amen the writing was upon the walls and all of The Magicians couldn't figure it out all of the susers couldn't figure it out and in fact they were all going to die amen but but when Daniel came out Daniel had the interpretation to to the the tongues that were there upon the wall and what did it do it pronounced judgment upon that Kingdom it pronounced this night the kingdom will be taken away from you so brother Ram is is is is putting them together and he's saying now when the when Pentecost came it was a declaration to the Jewish dispensation you have in fact crucified the word and God Has Come amen and speaking in tongues God is declaring you're finished he says now it's coming at the end of the Gentile dispensation and everyone is wanting to Rally around this and they're missing the full the whole point of why in the last days I will pour out of my spirit it is saying that it is a it is the ending of of denominationalism it's an ending of of World Systems it's an ending of and it is an ushering in of the great Millennium it's a it's death to the church but it is life unto the bride amen so Satan wants to come in and mix that up and so now we've got now you know when people say you know that that uh uh you know I've I've got the Holy Ghost because I speak in tongues well uh you know I I'm sorry but uh amen that that's not that show me any kind of scriptural evidence that speaking in tongues is a sign that you've got the Holy Ghost and I'll I'll take you back to to um Corinthians 1 Corinthians the 12th chapter and says do all work miracles of course no do all prophesy no do all speak with tongues no he's just he's just taken that entire chapter that says not all is an ear not all is an eye not all is this not all is that amen and so then he comes back around and says okay so it's all going to speak with tongues and yet the church wants to say that's the sign of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah the scripture says that they will come to him in that day and I believe it's the people from this generation will come to him from the in that day and that will say Amen have we not cast out Devils have we not prophesied in thy name and he will say depart from me you workers of iniquity who done not the will of my father for I never knew you amen so we're we're thankful for the gifts and we're going to get into that a little bit later on as he as he goes on down but let's let's just continue to reading now he says if you don't think this is true then just just listen to this all over the world in both Pentecost and fundamental groups they are organizing the businessmen they have invaded the pull pit without a call from God they have styled themselves the fish ERS of men and founders of a move of God they say the gifted Ministry of Ephesians 4 and 10-13 that God gave the church has failed and they are taken over well let's praise the Lord there's some of that going on today here we are right in the midst of the Fulfillment of Prophecy called The Gang sayings of Kora they don't even know that uh that they have fulfilled it they are blindly going on preaching experience for truth may God have pity on it May their eyes be open before it is too late oh listen to me when did Prestige of money and social leadership and business ability and sheer mental prus ever qualify a man for Spiritual leadership or give any weight to the word of God when in any way materially or human values begin to show as the media by which God works instead of the Holy Spirit alone then we are fighting against God not for him now I want to I want this on record right here I'm not speaking against Elders in the church no sir and that Elder can be as poor as any man was ever poor or be the richest in the world as long as he's an elder in heart indeed I would not hesitate to ordain any man that has the real spiritual qualities of an elder or Deacon unless of regardless of his finances or social position when you see a social or financial structure com into the church that divides hies folks in any way that is not of God it is it is another sign of the time in uh uh it is another sign of the time in this physically rich but spiritually impoverished lotsy and CH age in which we are now living it says I Know Thy poverty did you notice their that their poverty is linked up with the synagogue of Satan in the same verse yes it is the rich powerful organization that has the wealth and always pushes out the little people that serve God when the spirit of God moves into the heart of men who is it that leaves the buildings and the property the little flock always loses out to the big organization where do the people go then then go they worship in homes old store buildings and basements just as they did when they were in the went to the catacombs these people were poor in the world's Goods certainly but they were rich in the spirit I know they're blasphemy Now isn't it isn't the thought here that these Liars are blaspheming God though that goes without saying but they are blaspheming the true church it all it it is always thus the Jews at Jerusalem blasphemed the church at the beginning the Gentile polytheists did likewise if anyone is going to be evil spoken of it will always be to the true uh the TR true seed in Nero's Day the Christians were blamed for every Calamity even for the burning of Rome in communist countries the little flop is always the first to be exterminated though actually insignificant in size though the Christians are fine loyal people who do only good they will always be persecuted to the end that they might be physically destroyed the the reason this is so is because they are a rebuke to the Godless now listen to that the reason this is so is because they are a rebuke to the Godless like a sore thumb they stand out before the wicked and and though the righteous intend no harm to the wicked but want to do only good invariably they find they are embroiled as the uh as as John the Baptist with Herod for John did not want to harm either Herod or his wife but to save them from the wrath of God this was not only thoroughly un misunderstood and absolutely withstood but John was put to death because of it for all the good the people of God do they are still put to public shame and to death surely there must be some Sinister force behind a people who would be so void of conscience that they would return evil to those who did them good yes there is such a force it is Satan the answer lies in the next verse 10 years of tribulation there in Revelations 2:10 fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer because the devil behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried ye have tribulation 10 days be thou uh faithful until the end and I will give thee a crown of life every time the Lord uses those words fear not there is an engagement at hand which will involve Great danger and suffering and deprivation now he does not say in a blunt Curt manner tribulation is coming that would frighten one but like as a mother who is about to turn out the light says gently to her child lest he be frightened now don't be afraid the light will go out and it will be dark but remember I am here with you so we says don't be afraid of man or what he can do to you I am with you and my grace is sufficient for you when you pass through the waters they will not overflow you not even in death are you defeated you are more than conquerors the great Apostle Paul knew from experience the reality of those words and he wrote in Romans 8:35 to39 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation and or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Pearl or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord no we are not to fear his love cast out all fear aren't you glad for that Hallelujah I believe he's still with us today I I I believe he's still very concerned about us today very concerned about you children about you mamas and daddies he's concerned about us all amen all right let's um are we doing okay am I am I reading too fast all right amen um let's see here okay so now now notice what he says the devil will cast some of you into prison that you might may be tried the Jews were doing that right then the Pagan priests were doing that right then the governors who tried to Curry favor with the public because the people like the arena hurled the Christians by the thousands to their death destroyed them by lions and Gladiators what has the devil to do with this why blame him oh yes but it is the devil's hatred behind it all he is behind it all for he hates God what God has set his heart on Satan is bound to try to destroy that's a good place to Mark right there what God has set his heart on Satan is bound to try to destroy but watch here are some illumination if Satan is behind the Jews who are hailing Christians into court then the Jews are not of God's religion but the Devils their Gathering is also of the synagogue of Satan and if the Roman Catholic Church killed the multitudes of Believers in the Dark Ages yes and in all ages then they are of the devil and belong to Satan also amen and then I I if and if you think this shocking just wait until the prophecy of Revelation 13 is fulfilled it is strikingly true that the United States of America is in that chapter the very number 13 is a symbol of this nation it's started with 13 colonies it's 13 or its flag has 13 stars and 13 stripes there is her Destiny in the 13th chapter in this image this is that is mentioned in this chapter will be found all the wickedness of the Beast that was before it as the Beast Rose and the at the Nan Council so the image will come out of the uh the World Council of churches with all ungodly and satanic power to vent the anger of the devil upon the True Vine of God it will it it will be a Repeat Performance of all diabolical cunning and cruelty uh cunning and cruelty those who fight the humble of God and scoff and Destroy let them do it and do it they will and all in the name of God in religion but they lie they're not of God they are of their father the devil they by their deeds against any people expose themselves for what they are let them organize and repudiate the little A Flock but but uh they but further reveal to all that they are of the devil they are of the false Vine the vine that murders their hatred proves who they are the Nick and Antichrist church is who they are they shall they shall be cast into prison yes they are held into court and falsely accused and tried and impr prison of course it is all done in the name of religion and decency and outraged innocency all done for a good cause that makes me think of the Supreme Courts ruling on prayer and Bible reading in the scrs who's behind it Satan is it is just another angry Outburst against God Thou shalt have tribulation for 10 days and here is a prophecy and with it is is a means of determining the lifespan of the samran church age uh Diocesan the cruestv god that except for the mercy of God would have wiped out all believers it was the bloodiest in history lasted 10 years the 10 days of Revelations uh 2:10 from 32 to 312 but be be thou faithful unto death he does not say be faithful until death but unto death you might have to seal your testimony with your blood thousands yay Millions have died during all the ages they have died in the faith like Antipas the faithful martyr they held not their lives unto death often we think that it would be most impossible it would be impossible to be a martyr but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarp and all Martyrs did you hear that the same faith that we have today is the faith the same faith that they had the Supreme now here it is I love it this is this is good might mark this down I I'd Mark what we just read there the the same uh see we but but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to tr Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the polyc carps and all Martyrs the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour blessed be God forever how is it that we stand what how is it that you're standing tonight in your trial how is it that my father can still get up there and and dare to sing like he did this last Sunday morning and while while he has served the Lord all of those millions and years don't you think the devil's not there saying you know what is this the best you can get from God in your later years you you you've given everything to you gave him your all from your very Youth and now this is what God's given you at your at your end and yet dad will still stand there and give God and say through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God you've gone through your testings and your trials and Satan's done every which way to turn you around come on we fight we fight hard but the same faith that was in those guys back then's the same faith that you're using today that'll stand Amen in fact I would say as the prophet would say Amen this is the hardest of Ages because it's not we're fixing to read now we're I I'm uh um I'm trying amen I'm just going to read down to the rewards for overcoming which is another paragraph and then I want to read to you a little bit from the um the fox's book of Martyrs and just Lord sort of let you know what what they went through as they were there but that same faith is the faith that you're standing with here tonight amen all right let's let's let's read this last little part here I will give thee a crown of life since not even a cup of cold water given in the name of the Lord fails to receive a reward how great shall be the reward to him that gives his life as a martyr for the name of Jesus of the Lord Jesus perhaps we can get a small idea if we compare this crown with the crown one in a race 1 Corinthians 9 and 24 Paul says know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receives the prize so run that ye may obtain a crown given to the winner of the Olympic race was a Garland of olive branches but the crown spoken of here in Revelation given to a martyr is the crown of r royalty Jesus calls it the Crown of Life The One Crown is for those who have striven the other is for the ones who have given both crowns are Incorruptible they uh they will not perish the winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joy of the plotts of the world their Glory will fail but those who live their lives for God either by daily striving or shedding their blood blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the Crown of Life all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God I say Amen to that the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal Kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up our in heaven those good Treasures that are available to the faithful Saints I I think I think that paragraph right there is so important all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God and the recompense of God is taken too lightly amen and so we we want to now as as the as the uh Prophet was talking how Satan was after amen that that church and and you you know um uh you know there was uh James the great according to St Matthew in the history of the Apostles acts the the acts of of the of the Holy Spirit uh James the son of jeedy the the elder brother of John relative of Our Lord um for his mother Shalom was a cousin German to the Virgin Mary he said the accounts given us by an eminent primitive writer uh Clemens Alex zrus ought not to be overlooked James was led to the place of martyrdom and his accuser was brought to repent of his conduct by the apostles extraordinary courage and undaunted and fell down at his feet to request his pardon professing himself a Christian and resolving that James should not receive the crown of martyrdom alone hence they were both beheaded at the same time thus did the first Apostolic martyr uh cheerfully and resolutely received that cup which he told our Lord our savior he was ready to drink isn't that something here's another account of Phillip I'm going to go run through these real quick this is all out of the fox's book of martys so Philip was born in Betha Betha in Galilee now these are these are Bible characters here and was first called by the name of disciple he labored diligently in Upper Asia and suffered martyrdom in in hopus in Fr frag he was scored thrown into prison and afterwards crucified in ad 54 Matthew uh he was a toll gatherer was born at Nazareth and he wrote his the gospel in Hebrew which afterwards translated Greek by James the Le the scene of his labers was partha in Ethiopia in which uh latter country he suffered mared him slain with with a harbard in the city of nababa in ad60 um James the last they I mean every one of these Mattheus uh he was the one who took uh judas's place he was stoned in Jerusalem and then he was beheaded Andrew uh he was uh Andrew was the brother of Peter and he preached the gospel to many Asia to Nations and Asian Nations but on his arrival at adessa he was taken and crucified on the on a cross the two ends of which were fixed transversally in the ground and hence the uh and hence the derivation of the term uh St Andrew's cross uh it goes on down there I mean all of the apostles were martyred the only ones that was not the only one that was not martyred was was the um John who wrote uh The Book of Revelations now I want to get on into the persecution in this church age that brother uh that we just read and so um this is all around that same time it says Mark Marcus um aelius followed about the year of the Lord uh 161 I know this is a little bit ahead of uh the the Smur and church age but it's right around that same area a man of nature more Stern and severe although in the study of philosophy and in counsil government no less commendable yet towards the Christians sharp and Fierce by whom was moved the fourth persecution the cruelties used in this persecution were such that many of the spectators shuddered with horror at the sight and were astonished at the Intrepid of the sufferers some of the mar ERS were obliged to pass with their already wounded feet over thorns and Nails sharp shells Etc upon their points others were scourged until their Senus and veins lay bare after suffering the most excruciating torturers tortures that could be devised they were destroyed by the most terrible deaths uh germanicus a young man but a true Christian being delivered to the wild beast on account of of his faith behave with such astonishing courage that several pagans become converts to to a faith which inspired such fortitude uh here's an account of polycarp's martyrdom as we are writing to you this is and actually poop was martyred there in samna and so this is the brothers from the samna church he says we we are writing to you Brothers with an account of the martyrs especially the Blessed polycarp whose death brought to to the persecu uh to a close uh almost all the events that led up to it reveal it to be another martyrdom in the Divine pattern that we see in the gospel for he waited for his betrayal just like the Lord did so that we might follow him in looking after the needs of others as well as ourselves true love desires not only one's own salvation but the salvation of all our brothers all the martyrdoms which God allowed to happen remember that The Devout will ascribe all things to his sovereignty were blessed and Noble we could not admire their honor their patience their love for the Lord or who could not admire they were whipped to shreds till their veins and arteries were exposed and still endured patiently while even those that stood by cried for them they had such courage that none of them let out a sigh or a groan proving that they suffered such torments were absent from their bodies or rather the Lord then stood by them and talked with them by the grace of God they despised all the cruelties of this world redeeming themselves from Eternal punishment by the suffering of a single hour the fire of their Savage executioners appeared cool to them because they fixed their eyes on their escape from the Eternal unquenchable fire and the good things promised to those who endure things which Ear Has Not Heard nor eyes seen nor the human heart imagined but re what were revealed to them by the Lord they were no longer men they had already become angels in the same way those who were condemned to the wild beast endured Dreadful torture some were stretched out on beds of spikes others were subjected to all kinds of torments all in the devil's attempt to make them deny Christ in in all that the devil attempted he failed thank be to God the heroic uh germanicus encouraged the Weak by his own endurance and fought bravely the wild beast when the proconsul tried to persuade him to cooperate for the sake of his own youth he drew the wild beast toward himself and provoked it in order to escape more quickly from this wicked World seeing all this the am the amazed crowd of Spectators cried out down with the atheist and those who do not believe in the Roman gods go get polycarp and by the way when quentis the F fresan handed himself over for martyrdom with some others the proconsul persuaded them to take the oath and sacrifice this is why we do not approve of voluntary martyrdom something the gospel does not teach us to do so he was saying and I read I read in another account here that these that there were some men that that that were encouraged by this and and um um uh they were going to just put themselves out there to be killed so that they could be a murderer but they weren't true Christians they were among them but when they came in and when they when they got to the to to to the persecution uh they they persuaded them to take an oath and a sacrifice and the Christians looked at them with great disdain and said how could you do that and it was quite the Christians looked at these men as if they were such traitors to portray Christ not not betray them but to betray Christ and um uh there was there was amongst the the Christians it was a big big thing to see them walk away and to uh to yield to to these others that were trying to get them to turn from Christ he says and and as far as uh uh it says and when he polycarp when he heard about this the redoutable uh polycarp was not in the least upset and was happy to stay in the city but eventually he was persued to leave he went to friends in the nearby country where as usual he spent the whole time day and night in prayer for all the people and for the churches throughout the world 3 days before his he was arrested while he was praying he had a vision of his pillow under his head in Flames he said prophetically to those who were with him I will be burnt alive those who were looking for him uh were coming near so he left for another house and they immediately followed him and when they could not find him They seized two young men from his own household and tortured them into confession and uh uh the the governor uh was was impatient to bring polycarp to the stadium so that he might fulfill his special role to share the sufferings of Christ while those who betrayed him would be punished like Judas the police and the horsemen uh came with the young men at supper time on on the Friday uh with their usual weapons as as if coming against a robber now some of these words police uh Sheriff some of those say things have been changed to fix to to to to match our modern language okay so it wasn't that there were Poli in those days it uh they they have they have taken the fox this the fox's book of Martyrs and has and have just sort of put into modern terms so that we could understand it and so uh but they did not they did not take in any of the Integrity away from it he says um the police and the horsemen came with the with with the young men young man at supper time on body with their usual weapons as if they were coming out against a robber that evening they found him lying in the upper room of a cottage he could have escaped but he refused saying God's will be done when he heard that they had come he went down and spoke with them they were amazed at his age and steadfastness and some of them said why did we go to so much trouble to capture a man like this immediately he called for food and for drink for them and asked for an hour to pray un interrupted so he's going to feed his enemies he says they agreed and he stood and prayed for uh so full of the grace of God that he could not stop for two hours men the men were astounded and many of them regretted coming to arrest such a Godly and venerable old man when he was finished praying they put him on a donkey and took him into the city as polycarp was was being taken into the arena of a voice came to him from Heaven be strong polycarp and play the man no one saw no one saw who had spoken but our brothers who were there heard the voice and when the crowd heard that polycarp had been captured there was an uproar the proconsul asked him whether he was polycarp and on hearing that he was uh that he was he he tried to persuade him to a apostasy saying have respect to your old age swear by the fortune of Caesar repent and say down with the atheist and polycarp looked grimly at the wicked Heathen multitude in the stadium and gesturing towards them saying down with the atheist swear urged the proconsul reproach Christ and I will set you free 86 years have I served him polyc clarp declared he has done me no wrong how can I blaspheme My Savior and my king I have wild animals here the proconsul said I will throw you to them if you do not repent repent call them polycarp replied it is Unthinkable for me to repent from what is good to turn to what is evil I will be glad though be uh though to be charged from Evil to righteousness if you despise the animals I will have you burned you threaten me with fire with which burns for an hour and is then extinguished but you know nothing of the fire of the coming judgment and eternal punishment reserved for the ungodly why are you waiting bring on whatever you want and it was all done in the time that it takes to tell the crowd collected wood and bundles of sticks and the shops and uh from the shops and the public baths the Jews as usual Were King to help when the pile was ready polycarp took off his outer clothes and undid his belt and tried to take off a sandal something he was not used to as the faithful always raced to do it for him each wanting to be the one to touch his skin this is how good his life was but when they went to fix him with nails he said leave me as I am for he that giveth me strength to endure the fire will enable me not to struggle without the help of your nails so they simply bound him with his hands behind him with a distinguished Ram chose uh like a distinguished Ram chosen with a great from a great flock of sacrifice ready to be acceptable uh acceptable burnt offering to God he looked up to heaven and said oh Lord God Almighty the father of your beloved and blessed Jesus Christ by whom we have received the knowledge of you the God of angels powers and every creature and of all the righteous who live before you I give you thanks that you count me worthy to be numbered among your martyrs sharing the cup of Christ the resurrection and the resurrection to eternal life both of soul and body through the immortality of the Holy Spirit may I be received this day as an acceptable sacrifice as you the true God have predestined and revealed to me and now fulfilled I praise you for all these things I bless you and glorify you along with the Everlasting Jesus Christ your beloved Son to you with him through the Holy Ghost be glory uh both now and forever amen then the fire was lit and the fire and the flame blazed furiously we who were privileged to witness it saw a great miracle this is why we had been preserved to tell the story The Fire shaped itself like into the form of an arch like the sail of a ship when filled with the wind and formed a circle around the body of the Martyr inside it looked like not it looked not like flesh that is burnt but like bread that is baked or gold and silver glowing in the fire we smelled a sweet scent like fragrance or some other sweet precious other precious spices eventually when those wicked men saw that his body could not be consumed by the fire they commanded an executioner to pierce him with a dagger and when he did this a dove flew out uh and such a great quantity of blood flowed that fire that the fire was extinguished the crowd were amazed at the difference between the unbelievers and the elect of whom the great polycarp was surely one having in our own times been an Apostolic and prophetic teacher the bishop of The Universal Church in Samina for for every word he uh spoke either has been uh either has been or shall be accomplished when the enemy saw The Wonder of his monorom his blameless life and now crowning with immortality he did his utmost to stop us keeping any Memorial of him or taking possession of his holy body he inspired Nikas nikitas the father of Herod along with the Jews to ask the governor not to hand over his body for burial uh they might turn from worshiping the crucified one only to start worshiping this one they did not realize that it was impossible for us to abandon Christ who suffered for the Salvation of the world were to worship any other amen wasn't that quite a reading sir amen praise the Lord I'm want to give you a few other examples here I want to bring polycarp in is right in the middle right in there with that it says metrodorus a minister who preached boldly and pianus who made some excellent apologies for the CHR Christian faith were burnt likewise or likewise burnt uh carpus and Papalis two worthy Christians and an a antonica a Pious woman suffered martyrdom in uh at per pergamus in Asia U felus an illustrious Roman Lady of a considerable family and the most shining virtues was a devout Christian she had seven sons whom she had educated with the most Exemplar exemplary uh piety Jarius the eldest was scorched and pressed to death with weights Felix and Phillip the next two had their brains dashed out with clubs sanus I fourth was was murdered by being thrown into a precipice and the three younger Sons Alexander Vitalis and Marshall were beheaded and the mother was beheaded with the same sword as the three latter Justin the celebrated philosopher uh fell a martyr in in his in this persecution uh you know he he they just they just went from uh uh just from Person to Person to Person to Person of of these ones who willingly and I I could get I mean I've got I've got 15 pages that I've just of nothing of just a portion of this book and and I would encourage those who who have not read the fox's book of Martyrs Read that read what this is this is our heritage this is what our forefathers done this is this is what they gave their life they gave their life so that you and I what what would what would have happened if if they had not given their life what if what if Satan would have put this put this gospel out and then we get we get so frustrated and so easily beet we get we get so wrapped up in the little things of life and and um you know and Satan and and and he and he tries to push us this way and push us that way but I just want to tell you you're of a greater Faith you're of a greater Faith than any devil that wants to try to pull you one way or another amen and um um so uh you know I I I just I don't want to just continue reading this whole this this whole time and I don't want to be too voring for you guys um but here's here's a few inscriptions that they found um you know despite the awful story of persecution that we read here the inscriptions bre breathe forth peace and joy and Triumph and here are a few and so they're just given us a few things in scriptions that they found uh from people that that have passed on want of you know what the what the family said apparently over name PL or over the graves here lives Marsha put to rest in a dream of Peace Lawrence to his sweetest son born away of angels victorious in peace and in Christ being called away he went in peace uh remember when reading these inscriptions the story of skeletons tell the persecution and torture of fire but the full force of these uh is seen when we contrast them with the Pagan uh the Pagan things it's live for the present hour since we are sure of nothing else I lift my hands unto the gods who took me away at the age of 20 though I had done no harm once I was not now I am not I know nothing about it it is no concern of mine traveler curse me not as you pass for I'm in darkness and cannot answer the most frequent Christian symbols on the walls of the Catacombs are the Good Shepherd with the Lamb on his shoulder a ship under Full Sail Harps anchors crowns Vines and above all the fish amen isn't that something yes sir amen so you know I I I thought I would go ahead and and and bring this bring some of this in and um and share it with you guys tonight did y'all enjoy the little bit of reading we had there from polycarp and the church ages and uh there's there's there's a lot really a lot of of other really incredible things that you could read at home in the church age uh or in the um in in the uh Fox book of Martyrs I thought this was particular interesting because this is that that that suan age and and it was brother Brandon would would bring it in um and there's even uh even the one that that the cruelest of all the Emperors I think there was a total of of what they called U uh 10 uh persecutions what they would call persecutions were the seasons that they went through those dark ages and just and just really hammered these um and and and slaughtered the Christians and so um I just thought that that would be good to bring in tonight amen so um are there any questions or any comments here this evening amen praise the Lord anything that y'all want to add uh to this amen hopefully it wasn't too much reading tonight praise the Lord um okay so um uh sister uh um let's see did I bring my phone Josh would you get my phone phone there on on the desk um the question that sister um U oh Brianna Brianna brought to us the night uh was actually some quotes and so she she she uh she sent these to me and so um I thought that I would just read them to you quickly and um praise the Lord amen okay so um in just a minute well it's not going to bring it up okay so she had asked about the uh Abel's children and uh and uh Seth's children and so uh and I and so it it and it read something like this well Abel's children were humble Farmers Shepherds pastors you know Shepherds Farmers humble didn't claim to be smart but they just they just with the word what did they produced at the end time a prophet it did a prophet what for the last times when Noah stood in at the door uh building on that Ark he said it's coming a rain he was called a fanatic but he was a prophet another one was the humble little race produced a prophet and that prophet in the days of Abel's children produced a prophet that showed the Last Day signs and give the warning and so um so that's where sister Brianna was coming the other night about the difference you know uh that with the spiritual lineage come from Abel's children or from Seth and um and so uh uh but here's here's the deal I I think I I um from from everything that the scripture says the scripture had said that the um that after Seth was born then man began to call upon the name of the Lord and so when you look at that and then look at all of the other quotes where brother brandham when he would compare the spiritual lineage uh with the Serpent's lineage he would always use that of Seth lineage and not of Abel so I think that that was that was um uh just just misspeaking when when he had mentioned that because we have dozens of of quotes where we where we're talking about Seth so in my opinion it's it's like it's like um uh him saying 700 prophets instead of 7,000 prophets and he said it several times and this was this was said the same uh in the same tape so he said 700 uh uh that had not bowed you know to Baal or kissed his lips and he said that a couple of times in that in that sermon but but we know when he came back later and said oh no no they they thought there was something spiritual being stated there and he goes oh no I just misspoke that um it was really 7,000 and so I think that that's the same this is the same here is is that it's because the um there there is there is not brother brandham never says anything else about it about Abel having children uh about abble having uh a wife but it does say something about Seth children then men began to call upon the name of the Lord so whether or not that that is what brother bradam meant I can't tell you that um but I do know that that is um when they when he talked about Abel um and then going straight into Noah it was Abel's children that brought on Noah well that was Seth's children that actually brought in Noah so um so that that's that that's that's where she was at so I I uh so those of us that were looking at sister Brianna the other night and just wondering now where would you get Abel's children well that was actually a quote so so we appreciate uh Brianna bringing that in to us just in case anybody wanted to know that looks like they've already stepped out but um all right so is there uh anything else anyone want to say yes amen yeah yeah yeah yeah do you have that won't you read thats her priest viated law and andle their from my sabbaths and I am profane among them amen well that's that that's where that's where the synagogue of Satan had been that's where they had reached got to that point where they had taken it all in and and uh and brother that that's where we are at today until until the gospel of Christ means nothing like it was in that early church amen praise the Lord all right any anything else anyone wants to add real quick amen all right well if the musicians would come um I I um am thankful to God now we want to we we want this living Christ to be so so living in us we we we don't want a a dead Christ and if it's tradition we're not fighting for tradition and I'm definitely not I am not fighting for a tradition of the of the message Church u i there there is nothing in in in uh I don't want a message tradition there's nothing there that I want what got my attention was when tradition had had left me high and dry in the Pentecostal move and it I what I found in this message was a living Christ what I found in this message was a reality and I I don't ever ever ever ever want that reality to leave me I want the realities I want to be able to look at the word and believe that that word is still very much alive and and that God is still very much able to fulfill his word I don't want to explain nothing away I don't want a faith that says well that was for that day and that I want to say that God is here he's living and I want my I want my body my mind I want my actions I want everything to be that that that that came out of the book in the beginning let me be a continu ation of the book of Acts let me be a continuation of the realities of Christ live in me flow through me believe through me amen that's what he wants he wants that through US amen glory to God Amen well let's stand to our feet as we as we prepare to dismiss amen he's alive and when living in [Music] me to tell the word that he is the [Music] same he's the same yesterday and today and forever Jes is alive and way oh [Music] he's living in me to tell the world that he is [Music] oh he's the same yesterday and today and forever Jesus is aive and well amen he's not alive because we say he's alive he's alive because he is alive in reality we know he's alive because he proves himself alive God wants to hear our prayer God wants to answer our prayer and we're living in a day of great deceit we're living in a day where deception has finally taken over just as it did in the days of Adam and Eve it has come back and that reality is Among Us Eve truly believed the words of the serpent that same instructor that same teacher Knows No Boundaries I don't care whether you belong to an Assemblies of God or a Baptist or a Catholic or [Music] Episcopal he don't care what's over your door whether it be a message [Music] Church he's there sewing his seeds into our hearts and our minds now brothers sisters we must always stay close to God let the living logos live his word through us let his word so live and abound in US oh God Purify Me Oh God let my heart let my heart always be true to you oh Lord please correct me when I'm wrong please show me Satan makes everything look so innocent makes everything look so until many will say I I'm a real good Christian Jesus said because you've not done the will of my father I I I'm going to tell you I never knew you let's make sure we know him let's make sure he knows us let's do that now these folks gave their lives and the grace of God was so upon them the mercies of God were so with them and those same Mercies the prophet said is right here with us today we're not living our life in a going to the Lions but we're living in Le osia where it's just a big swamp you can't tell the difference between the right and the wrong you can't tell the difference it's just a but somebody's going to hear the writing on the wall somebody's going to walk with god let's walk with him can you say Amen let's do that I want to hear him say Well done well done and I believe we're going to hear him say it because his grace is going to be with us and bringing us into that reality God bless you father we thank you today for your love thank you for all that you are and what it means to us to serve you just reading a a small portion of Fox's book of Martyrs and we we can see very clearly that we are this gospel meant so much to them that not even the sword would would turn them away the the great beasts the lions that would devour them burning to the stake they nothing would turn their hearts because it was a living God all the pagans around they noticed there was something different about these people I pray Lord that we would never question our faith may we examine to make sure that we're in the faith but then never to question that you are with us let us always repent and let your Holy Spirit bathe us daily with your blood [Music] oh God keep our hearts pure and honest let us walk with you undefiled of this world and when we get sin Upon Us Lord oh we're so thankful for your blood now Lord we thank you for these things thank you for your spirit tonight be with your people be with our sister Stephanie Lord and the B baby and just ask Lord that you'd cause that baby's Lord everything to just work exactly the way it's supposed to so we can go home we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray amen and amen praise the
